SUBJECT:  ISRAEL\'S POLICY ON SOUTHERN LEBANON 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL KIMCHE BRIEFED AMBAS- 
SADORS FROM UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND UNIFIL CONTRIBUTOR 
COUNTRIES JUNE 12 ON SOUTHERN LEBANON.  KIMCHE REITERATED 
ISRAELI POLICY IN SOUTHERN LEBANON LEADING UP TO THE 
WITHDRAWAL, THEN EMPHASIZED THAT ISRAEL WAS NOW OUT OF 
LEBANON AND, THEREFORE, NO LONGER IN CONTROL.  AS A RE- 
SULT, ALTHOUGH ISRAEL WAS TRYING TO BE HELPFUL, ISRAEL 
FELT THAT UNIFIL MUST WORK OUT THE PROBLEM OF THE FINNISH 
HOSTAGES WITH THE SLA DIRECTLY.  IF ISRAEL SOUGHT TO 
CONTROL EVENTS AND FORCE LAHAD TO RELEASE THE FINNISH 
SOLDIERS, ISRAEL WOULD, IN EFFECT, BE BACK IN LEBANON. 
THERE WOULD BE NO MORE SLA AND LAHAD WOULD BE FINISHED. 
SEVERAL AMBASSADORS SAID THEIR GOVERNMENTS CONSIDER 
ISRAEL TO REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY OF THE UNIFIL 
SOLDIERS, AND MADE STRONG STATEMENTS OF PRINCIPLE AGAINST 
THE HOLDING OF HOSTAGES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
- 
3.  MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL DAVID KIMCHE INVITED THE AMBAS- 
SADORS AND CHARGES FROM THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBER 
STATES AND THE CONTRIBUTORS TO UNIFIL TO A BRIEFING JUNE 
12 ON ISRAEL\'S POLICY IN SOUTH LEBANON.  THE BRIEFING 
INVITATION WAS STIMULATED BY THE PRESENT CRISIS BETWEEN 
UNIFIL AND THE SOUTH LEBANESE ARMY.  KIMCHE SOUGHT TO 
PLACE THE ISRAELI REACTION TO THE CURRENT CRISIS IN THE 
BROAD CONTEXT OF ISRAELI POLICY. 
- 
 
4.  ISRAELI POLICY ON SOUTHERN LEBANON 
-   ---------------------------------- 
KIMCHE OPENED BY NOTING THAT THERE IS A CABINET DECISION 
ON SOUTHERN LEBANON THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE BASIS OF 
ISRAELI ACTIONS, UNTIL THERE IS A CABINET DECISION TO 
CHANGE IT.  THE DECISION INCLUDES THE  FOLLOW- 
ING ELEMENTS:  A) THE IDF IS REDEPLOYED ALONG THE INTER- 
NATIONAL FRONTIER, AND NO IDF UNITS WILL REMAIN IN 
LEBANON ON A REGULAR OR PERMANENT BASIS.  B) THE IDF RE- 
TAINS FREEDOM OF ACTION AGAINST TERRORISTS BEFORE, DURING 
OR AFTER THEIR ACTIVITIES AGAINST ISRAEL.  C)  A SECURITY 
ZONE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, WITH ISRAELI LIAISON WITH LOCAL 
FORCES WHICH ARE DEDICATED AGAINST TERRORISM.  D)  IF THE 
LOCAL FORCES ARE ATTACKED THE IDF MAY RESPOND TO PROTECT 
THEM. 
- 
 
5.  ISRAEL\'S RELATIONS WITH THE SLA 
-   ------------------------------- 
KIMCHE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL HAS HELPED AND 
CONTINUES TO HELP THE SOUTH LEBANON  (SLA), 
BUT NO LONGER CONTROLS THE SECURITY ZONE.  HE SAID THE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SLA IS ONE OF LIAISON AND ADVICE, 
BUT IT DOES NOT PERMIT ISRAEL TO GIVE ORDERS, AND THE SLA 
IS NOT A DE FACTO ISRAELI FORCE.  THE SLA IS LEBANESE, 
COMMANDED BY A LEBANESE GENERAL, AND IT BEHAVES AS THE 
LEBANESE BEHAVE, NOT AS ISRAELIS WOULD.  THIS MEANS THAT 
THE SLA OFTEN ACTS IN A MANNER WHICH IS  DISTASTEFUL TO 
ISRAEL. 
- 
 
6.  THE \"UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT\" WITH UNIFIL 
-   -------------------------------------- 
KIMCHE SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF  ISRAEL DEPLORES \"THE 
UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT\", AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT SETTLED. 
HE SAID ISRAEL HAS GIVEN THE FOLLOWING ADVICE TO THE SLA: 
A) NOT TO HARM ANY OF THE HOSTAGES; HE SAID THE SLA HAS 
COMMITTED ITSELF TO DO NO HARM TO THE FINNISH SOLDIERS, 
AND THIS IS BEING OBSERVED.  B) ISRAEL HAS ADVISED LAHAD 
TO RELEASE THE HOSTAGES IN THE FRAMEWORK OF TALKS WITH 
UNIFIL.  HE SAID THAT THE ISSUE MUST BE RESOLVED BY UNIFIL 
AND THE SLA DIRECTLY.  ON NO ACCOUNT, HE EMPHASIZED, SHOUL 
ISRAEL BE A DIRECT PARTY.  ISRAEL IS OUT OF LEBANON; IF 
IT WERE TO DEAL DIRECTLY THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT ISRAEL 
IS STILL IN.  KIMCHE VOLUNTEERED THAT IT IS TRUE THAT 
ISRAEL STILL HAS LIAISON OFFICERS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON, BUT 
HE ASSERTED THAT THE NUMBERS ARE FEWER THAN THOSE WHICH 
WERE ACCEPTED IN THE MAY 17 AGREEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN 
WELCOMED BY MANY STATES INCLUDING EGYPT. 
- 
 
7.  THE UNIFIL-SLA MEETING 
-   ---------------------- 
KIMCHE SAID THAT THE MEETING BETWEEN GENERALS LAHAD AND 
PONS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  HE SAID THEY DIS- 
CUSSED THE RELEASE OF THE CAPTIVES; THE GOVERNMENT OF 
ISRAEL THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE MET FROM THE VERY BEGIN- 
NING, BUT THIS MEETING AT LEAST WAS HELD IN A GOOD 
ATMOSPHERE.  THE GIST OF THE MEETING WAS:  LAHAD ASKED 
UNIFIL FOR THE ELEVEN SLA TROOPS TO BE BROUGHT TO A 
NEUTRAL PLACE WHERE IT COULD BE DETERMINED WHETHER THEY 
HAD IN FACT DEFECTED OR HAD BEEN CAPTURED AND TURNED OVER 
TO AMAL.  HE SAID THAT IF THE ELEVEN STATE THAT THEY HAD 
DEFECTED, THE FINNS WILL BE RELEASED IMMEDIATELY BY LAHAD. 
IT HAD ALSO BEEN AGREED DURING THE MEETING TO APPOINT 
LIAISON OFFICERS BETWEEN GENERALS PONS AND LAHAD, AND 
UNIFIL HAD SECURED THE RIGHT TO VISIT THE FINNISH 
SOLDIERS EVERY THREE OR FOUR DAYS.  KIMCHE SAID, OF COURSE 
HE HOPED THE PROBLEM WOULD BE SOLVED BEFORE THAT TIME 
LIMIT.  KIMCHE CONCLUDED THAT HE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS NOW 
UP TO UNIFIL TO BRING THE ELEVEN TO A NEUTRAL SPOT, 
PERHAPS NAQURA. 
- 
8.  GENERAL REMARKS 
-   --------------- 
KIMCHE OFFERED THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL REMARKS:  SINCE 
THERE IS NO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN LEBANON, ISRAEL UNDER- 
STANDS THE NEED FOR UNIFIL TO HAVE RELATIONS WITH THE AMAL 
MILITIAS.  IN FACT HE SAID THIS IS A POSITIVE THING.  IN 
THE PAST UNIFIL HAD SAID THAT IT COULD DEAL ONLY WITH THE 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON.  BUT SINCE THAT PROVED 
IMPRACTICAL, AND UNIFIL IS NOW DEALING WITH AMAL, IT 
SHOULD ALSO DEAL WITH THE SLA.  HE SAID THIS NOW SEEMS TO 
BE IN PROGRESS.  ISRAEL, HE SAID, WOULD LIKE A STRONG CEN- 
TRAL GOVERNMENT IN LEBANON, AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
LIAISON WITH THE LEBANESE ARMY.  BUT THIS IS NOT FEASIBLE, 
AND THERE IS LITTLE HOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE FORESEEABL 
FUTURE.  KIMCHE THEN DESCRIBED THE INTERFACTIONAL FIGHTING 
WITHIN LEBANON,  NOTING THAT IT APPEARS THAT ALL FACTIONS 
ARE NOW FIGHTING WITH ALL OTHERS, FOLLOWING A RECENT 
REPORT OF A SHIA-DRUZE CONFLICT THIS MORNING. 
- 
9.  JAZZIN 
-   ------ 
KIMCHE SAID THAT JAZZIN COULD BE THE NEW FLASHPOINT.  HE 
SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL HAD NEVER TOLD OR 
ADVISED THE SLA TO GO TO JAZZIN, AND FURTHER 
ADVISED THE SLA THAT IF IT DECIDED TO GO TO JAZZIN, 
ISRAEL WOULD NOT HELP THE SLA BECAUSE JAZZIN IS OUTSIDE 
THE SECURITY ZONE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL HAD PROPOSED 
TO UNIFIL THAT IT DEPLOY TO JAZZIN, SINCE IT HAD FORCES 
CLOSE BY.  HE SAID THE GOI WOULD WELCOME A UNIFIL DEPLOY- 
MENT TO JAZZIN AND WOULD ADVISE THE SLA TO WITHDRAW IN 
THAT CASE.  THE UN SECRETARY HAD THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD 
IDEA AND TRIED IT OUT WITH PRESIDENT GEMAYEL.  GEMAYEL 
ALSO, ACCORDING TO KIMCHE, THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA 
BUT DECLINED TO REQUEST A UNIFIL PRESENCE IN JAZZIN 
BECAUSE HE KNEW HE COULDN\'T GAIN THE SUPPORT OF EITHER 
SYRIA OR HIS OWN PRIME MINISTER.  HE SAID THIS ALSO 
DEMONSTRATES THE WEAKNESS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON. 
- 
10.  THE FINNS VERSUS THE SLA 
----------------------------- 
KIMCHE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW THE FACTS.  HE SAID THE 
INVESTIGATION WAS UNDERWAY, BUT IT APPEARED THAT THE UN 
STILL BELIEVES THAT THE ELEVEN SLA TROOPS DEFECTED. 
THE GOI, HE SAID, IS SKEPTICAL; IT BELIEVES THEY WERE 
ABDUCTED FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS WHICH KIMCHE ADMITTED 
WERE CIRCUMSTANTIAL:  A) ALL OF THE ELEVEN LEFT THEIR 
FAMILIES BEHIND.  KNOWING THAT THE SLA IS NOT A GENTLE 
FORCE, THEY WOULD CLEARLY HAVE BEEN AFRAID FOR THEIR 
FAMILIES IF THEY HAD VOLUNTARILY DEFECTED.  B) SHORTLY 
AFTER THE SLA ELEVEN WERE MOVED TO TYRE, AMAL LEADER 
NABIH BERRI SAID THAT HE WOULD EXCHANGE THE ELEVEN 
PRISONERS FOR THE SHIA PRISONERS HELD IN ISRAEL.  KIMCHE 
SAID IT WOULD BE RARE INDEED TO OFFER TO EXCHANGE 
DEFECTORS FOR OTHER PRISONERS.  C) HE THEN SHOWED A TV 
FILM MADE BY A SYRIAN CREW JUST AFTER THE ELEVEN REACHED 
TYRE.  THE CAPTIVES WERE SHOWN BEING HELD UNDER ARMED 
GUARD, SULLEN, APPARENTLY FEARFUL, AND RESPONDING TO 
ORDERS BY THEIR GUARDS.  KIMCHE SAID THIS APPEARED NOT TO 
BE THE DEMEANOR OF PERSONS WHO HAD VOLUNTARILY DEFECTED. 
- 
11.  KIMCHE CONCLUDED THIS SESSION BY NOTING THAT ISRAEL 
MAY NEVER KNOW THE TRUTH, BUT THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAE 
WANTS THE FINNS RELEASED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  HE SAID 
THAT ALL THAT ISRAEL WANTS IS PEACE ON THE NORTHERN 
FRONTIER. 
 
12.  AMBASSADORS\' COMMENTS 
-------------------------- 
THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THERE WAS A PRESS REPORT 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL WOULD CONTEMPLATE A MOVE OF 
UNIFIL TO THE BORDER UNDER AN ARRANGEMENT AGREED TO WITH 
THE SLA.  KIMCHE SAID THE UN HAD PRESENTED SOME IDEAS TO 
THE GOI ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A UNIFIL DEPLOYMENT TO THE 
BORDER WITH THE DE FACTO COOPERATION OF THE SLA.  NO 
DECISION HAD BEEN REACHED, AND THE SUBJECT WAS NOT 
THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED IN THE RABIN/URQUHART MEETING 
YESTERDAY.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT IN THE MEANTIME, UNTIL 
SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT IS WORKED OUT, ISRAELI POLICY, AS 
DETERMINED BY THE CABINET, REMAINS.  HE ADDED HOWEVER, 
THAT ISRAEL IS PREPARED TO CONSIDER ANY IDEAS FOR 
STRENGTHENING THE STABILITY OF THE BORDER AREA. 
- 
13.  THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE EC-10 HAD MET 
AND HAD MADE A GENERAL STATEMENT ON LEBANON.  HE SAID THE 
FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE TEN CONSIDERED THE INCIDENT VERY 
SERIOUS.  THEIR OPINION WAS THAT EVERY MEASURE SHOULD BE 
TAKEN TO FREE ALL HOSTAGES.  AMBASSADOR TALIANI ADDED A 
PERSONAL NOTE SAYING THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO 
ACCEPT ISRAELI DISCLAIMERS OF RESPONSIBILITY IN VIEW OF 
THE FACT THAT ISRAEL HAD ARMED AND EQUIPPED AND CONTINUED 
TO PAY THE SLA.  KIMCHE REPLIED THAT GIVING ASSISTANCE 
DOES NOT MEAN CONTROL.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE SAID, THE 3,000 
SOVIET ADVISERS IN SYRIA DO NOT MEAN THAT THE SOVIET 
UNION CONTROLS SYRIA.  HE SAID IF ISRAEL ACCEPTED THE 
ITALIAN AMBASSADOR\'S PREMISE, THE IDF WOULD BE DOOMED TO 
STAY IN LEBANON IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CONTROL. 
- 
14.  THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR STATED THE STRONG DESIRE OF 
HIS GOVERNMENT TO HAVE THE FINNISH TROOPS RELEASED AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE.  HE ADDED THAT HE FELT THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
OF ISRAEL HAS A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RELEASE. 
 
15.  THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR INTERVENED AGAIN TO NOTE THAT 
IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO ACCEPT THE TAKING OF 
HOSTAGES.  HE SAID HIS MAJESTY\'S GOVERNMENT WAS VERY 
EXERCISED OVER THE HOSTAGE ISSUE.  HE SAID ANY ACTION THAT 
ENCOURAGES THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES IS BAD BOTH IN THIS CASE 
AND IN THE GENERAL SENSE.  KIMCHE SAID HE AGREED THAT ANY 
TAKING OF HOSTAGES IS BAD.  HE CONCEDED THAT PERHAPS 
ISRAEL COULD SEND IN ITS TROOPS TO FORCE THEIR RELEASE. 
BUT IF THE IDF DID GO IN, IT WOULD MEAN THE END OF THE 
SLA, AND THE GOI WOULD HAVE TO BE BACK IN LEBANON TO STAY. 
HE SAID ISRAEL HAS GIVEN STRONG ADVICE TO LAHAD THAT IT 
WAS WRONG TO HOLD HOSTAGES.  BUT HE ADDED THAT THE ELEVEN 
SLA TROOPS MAY ALSO BE AS MUCH HOSTAGE AS THE FINNS.  HE 
SAID THEREFORE THE ONLY LINE OF ATTACK IS TO FOLLOW UP ON 
THE LAHAD  PROPOSAL.  HE THEN URGED THE CONTRIBUTORS 
TO UNIFUL TO PRESS THE UN TO HAVE THE AMAL BRING THE 
ELEVEN TROOPS TO THE NEUTRAL ZONE SO IT COULD DETERMINE 
IF THEY WERE VOLUNTARILY DEFECTORS OR IN FACT CAPTIVES. 
 
16.  THE AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT 
WELCOMES THE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM LEBANON, BUT ADDED 
THAT THE CONTINUING PRESENCE OF LIAISON OFFICERS LEAVES 
THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL CONSIDERABLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT PRESENT.  HE SAID THE HOSTAGES SHOULD 
BE RELEASED WITHOUT CONDITIONS IMMEDIATELY. 
- 
17.  COMMENT - THIS WAS THE THIRD OF A SERIES OF MEETINGS 
THAT KIMCHE HAS HAD WITH THIS GROUP ON LEBANON.  KIMCHE 
STATED THE CASE WITH CLARITY AND PRECISION, BUT HIS 
AUDIENCE WAS NOT CONVINCED.  CONCERNING THE HOSTAGES, HE 
REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT ISRAEL COULD BE EITHER IN 
LEBANON OR OUT, AND IF OUT, ISRAEL COULD NOT FORCE LAHAD 
TO DO WHAT HE DIDN\'T WANT TO DO.  BEHIND THIS DENIAL OF 
CONTROL OF LAHAD IS KIMCHE\'S CONVICTION THAT TO TRY TO 
FORCE LAHAD WOULD MEAN THE END OF LAHAD AND LAHAD\'S FORCES 
CLEARLY THIS IS A CARD WHICH ISRAEL HAS NOT BEEN WILLING 
TO PLAY.  IT IS ALSO CLEAR, AS KIMCHE IMPLIED SEVERAL 
TIMES, THAT ISRAELI POLICY ON SOUTHERN LEBANON IS SUBJECT 
TO CHANGE AS THE TACTICAL SITUATION SHIFTS.  BUT ISRAEL IS 
STILL COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING LAHAD IN GENERAL AND IN HIS 
CONFRONTATION WITH UNIFIL, AND IS UNWILLING TO FACE THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE SLA.  IF THE SLA 
SHOULD CRUMBLE, THE PERES GOVERNMENT\'S LEBANON  WITH- 
DRAWAL DECISION, UP TO NOW A VERY POPULAR ONE, COULD 
SPRING AGAIN INTO THE CENTER OF POLITICAL  CONTRO- 
VERSY HERE.  CERTAINLY SHARON AND HIS ALLIES WOULD MAKE 
THE MOST OF IT TO WEAKEN THE PERES GOVERNMENT AND FURTHER 
INHIBIT ITS ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD ON EITHER THE EGYPTIAN 
FRONT OR THE PEACE PROCESS ISSUES NOW UNDER DISCUSSION.

SUBJECT:  ISRAELI WHITE PAPER ON PLO OUTLOOK AND GOALS 
 
1.  THE GOI HAS LAUNCHED AN EXTENSIVE PUBLICITY 
CAMPAIGN TO DOCUMENT THE GOALS AND METHODS OF THE 
PLO.  MFA SOURCES HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A PAPER ON 
\"THE PLO\'S OUTLOOK AND GOALS IN THE WAKE OF THE 
HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT\" WHICH IS BEING MADE PUBLIC 
AS PART OF THAT CAMPAIGN.  THE TEXT IS BELOW IN PARA 
2.  KEY POINTS (SUPPORTED BY QUOTATIONS FROM PLO 
SOURCES) ARE: 
 
- -- ARAFAT\'S GOALS IN THE FEBRUARY 11TH AGREEMENT 
ARE DESCRIBED AS: 
 
-        -- PREVENTING HUSSEIN FROM ENTERING THE 
PEACE PROCESS ON HIS OWN. 
 
-        -- PREPARING THE GROUND FOR A RETURN OF THE 
PLO TO JORDAN. 
 
-        -- ACHIEVEMENT OF U.S. RECOGNITION WITHOUT 
ACCEPTANCE OF 242 AND 338. 
-- 
- -- THE FEBRUARY 11TH AGREEMENT \"DOES NOT DEVIATE 
FROM PLO POLICY\". 
 
- -- THE PLO\'S GOAL REMAINS \"THE DESTRUCTION OF 
ISRAEL\". 
 
- -- \"THE ARMED STRUGGLE\" REMAINS CENTRAL TO PLO 
POLICY. 
 
- -- THE PLO REJECTS JORDANIAN INTERPRETATIONS OF THE 
FEBRUARY 11TH AGREEMENT. 
 
- -- THE PLO SEES \"LAND FOR PEACE\" AS ONE STAGE, 
LEADING TO THE EVENTUAL DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT: 
 
\"CHAPTER 1:  THE POLITICAL DIMENSION - THE PLO\'S 
OUTLOOK AND GOALS IN THE WAKE OF THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT 
AGREEMENT (11 FEB 1985) 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT AND ITS MEANING AS 
VIEWED BY THE PLO 
 
1.  ARAFAT SIGNED THE AGREEMENT WITH HUSSEIN FOR 
THREE PRIMARY REASONS: 
 
A.  TO ENSURE THAT HUSSEIN WOULD NOT ENTER INTO 
SEPARATE NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL; 
 
B.  TO PREPARE THE GROUND FOR THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF 
A PLO PRESENCE IN JORDAN, FROM WHENCE THE 
ORGANIZATION WAS EXPELLED IN 1970. 
 
C.  TO WIN US RECOGNITION, WITHOUT HAVING TO ACCEPT 
THE US\' PRECONDITIONS, NAMELY, ACCEPTING UN 
RESOLUTION 242 AND RECOGNIZING ISRAEL\'S RIGHT TO 
EXIST, AND TO ACHIEVE US AGREEMENT TO THE CONVENING 
OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE AT WHICH THE PLO WILL 
HAVE A STATUS EQUAL TO THAT OF THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS. 
 
THE EXPULSION OF THE TERRORISTS FROM LEBANON, 
INITIALLY BY THE IDF AND LATER BY SYRIA, BROUGHT THE 
PLO TO ONE OF THE LOWEST POINTS IN ITS HISTORY; NOT 
ONLY WERE PLO MEMBERS DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE 
EAST, BUT WHEN ARAFAT WANTED TO CONVENE THE PALESTINE 
NATIONAL COUNCIL, HE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING AN 
ARAB COUNTRY WILLING TO HOST IT AND, IN THE END, ONLY 
JORDAN AGREED TO DO SO.  FOR ARAFAT, THE AGREEMENT 
WITH HUSSEIN THEREFORE MEANS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE 
RETURN OF THE TERRORISTS TO JORDAN AND THE GRADUAL 
STRENGTHENING OF THEIR PRESENCE THERE, WITH THE 
INTENTION BEING THAT JORDAN SERVE AS A BASE FOR 
INCREASED TERRORIST ACTIVITY AGAINST ISRAELI TARGETS, 
FOR THE INCITEMENT OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE 
TERRITORIES AGAINST ISRAELI RULE, AND FOR THE 
STRENGTHENING OF THE PLO\'S POSITION IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL ARENA.  IN HIS BOOK, \'THE JORDANIAN 
AGREEMENT\', WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN AMMAN IN JULY 
1985, KHALED AL-HASSAN, HEAD OF THE INFORMATION 
DIVISION OF \'FATAH\', SPEAKS OF THIS GOAL: 
 
-   \'THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE TO THE RETURN OF THE 
PLO TO AN AREA WHICH BORDERS ON THE HOMELAND, AND TO 
AN ESCALATION OF THE ARMED STRUGGLE, WHICH IS ONE OF 
THE FIXED PRINCIPLES OF THE PALESTINIAN ACTION 
STRATEGY.  THE ONLY POSSIBLE PLACE IS JORDAN, SINCE 
THE BORDERS OF EGYPT, SYRIA, AND LEBANON HAVE BEEN 
CLOSED FOR REASONS WHICH THERE IS NO NEED TO GO 
INTO.  THE RETURN TO JORDAN IS A STRATEGIC INTEREST 
AND NEED OF BOTH PALESTINE AND JORDAN.  THE RETURN TO 
JORDAN NECESSITATES AN AGREEMENT TO ORDER RELATIONS 
(BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES??)\'. 
 
2.  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT CONTAINS NEITHER 
CONCESSIONS NOR MODERATION ON BASIC PLO POSITIONS. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT DEVIATE FROM 
PLO POLICY AS APPROVED BY THE ORGANIZATION\'S 
AUTHORIZED INSTITUTIONS - AND ESPECIALLY THE 
PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL - AND AS ENSHRINED IN THE 
DECISIONS OF THE ARAB SUMMITS.  INDEED, A STATEMENT 
WHICH THE PLO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ISSUED ON 18 
FEBRUARY 1985, AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT, 
SAID THE FOLLOWING: 
 
-   \'THE JOINT ACTIVITY OF JORDAN AND THE PLO IS 
BASED ON PALESTINIAN LEGITIMACY - WHICH IS EXPRESSED 
IN THE DECISIONS OF THE PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL, 
ESPECIALLY AT ITS 16TH AND 17TH SESSIONS, ON ARAB 
LEGITIMACY - WHICH IS EXPRESSED IN THE DECISIONS OF 
THE ARAB SUMMITS, IN PARTICULAR RABAT AND FEZ, AND ON 
INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY - WHICH IS EXPRESSED IN THE 
DECISIONS OF THE UN.\' 
 
SINCE THIS STATEMENT WAS PUBLISHED, SIMILAR DECISIONS 
HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY A NUMBER OF PLO AND \'FATAH\' 
INSTITUTIONS. 
 
3.  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT HAS NOT PRODUCED ANY 
CHANGE IN THE PLO\'S STRATEGIC AIM, WHICH REMAINS THE 
DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A 
\'DEMOCRATIC, SECULAR\' STATE ON ISRAEL\'S RUINS, WITH 
THE ACHIEVING OF THIS AIM BEING CARRIED OUT IN 
STAGES.  EVIDENCE FOR THIS CAN BE FOUND IN THE 
DECLARATIONS OF THE AL-HASSAN BROTHERS, CONFIDANTS OF 
ARAFAT: 
 
A.  HANI AL-HASSAN, ARAFAT\'S POLITICAL ADVISOR:  \'AS 
LONG AS THE PALESTINIAN DEMOCRATIC STATE HAS NOT BEEN 
ESTABLISHED ON ALL OF PALESTINE, THERE CAN BE NO 
ABSOLUTE AND FINAL SOLUTION TO THE PALESTINIAN 
PROBLEM.  I AM SPEAKING ALSO OF THOSE LANDS WHICH 
WERE PALESTINIAN BEFORE 1948, FROM THE RIVER TO THE 
SEA; THIS IS THE STRATEGIC GOAL.  CLEARLY, SUCH A 
GOAL IS NOT ATTAINED ALL AT ONCE, BUT RATHER IN 
STAGES.\' (AL-SAYAD, 15.4). 
 
B.  KHALED AL-HASSAN:  \'THE CONFLICT IS LONG AND 
ALL-ENCOMPASSING, AND ITS OUTCOME WILL BE DETERMINED 
ONLY BY THE ELIMINATION OF EITHER ARAB NATIONALISM, 
OR ZIONISM.  THERE IS A CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THESE 
TWO MOVEMENTS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED THROUGH THE 
ELIMINATION OF ONE OF THEM.  HOWEVER, SINCE WE SEE NO 
POSSIBILITY OF QUICKLY ACHIEVING THE FINAL AIM, WE 
OPERATE THROUGH THE POLICY OF STAGES, UPON WHICH THE 
PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL DECIDED IN 1974\' (AL-ANBA, 
KUWAIT, 24.5). 
-- 
4.  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT HAS PRODUCED NO 
CHANGE IN THE PLO\'S VIEW OF TERROR, WHICH IT REFERS 
TO S THE \'ARMED STRUGGLE\'.  FOR EXAMPLE: 
 
-   1.  HANI AL-HASSAN:  \'THE ARMED STRUGGLE SOWS, 
AND THE POLITICAL STRUGGLE REAPS, AND HE WHO SOWS 
NOT, REAPS NOT\' (RADIO MONTE CARLO, 16.3). 
 
-   2.  NABIL SHA\'AT MEMBER OF THE \'FATAH\' CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE:  \'SOLELY POLITICAL SOLUTIONS CANNOT BE 
SOUGHT WITHOUT CONTINUING ARMED STRUGGLE\' (ASH-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT, 18.8). 
 
B.  MOREOVER, THE \'ARMED STRUGGLE\' IS OF CENTRAL 
IMPORTANCE; IT MUST BE CONTINUED, EVEN ESCALATED AS, 
FOR EXAMPLE: 
 
-   1.  ABU JIHAD, HEAD OF THE MILITARY ARM OF 
\'FATAH\' AND RESPONSIBLE FOR WEST BANK AFFAIRS:  \'THE 
CONDUCT OF SEA WARFARE BY PALESTINIAN FIGHTERS IS AN 
EXPRESSION OF THE FIRM DECISION TO CONTINUE AND 
ESCALTE THIS ARMED STRUGGLE, WHATEVER THE 
DIFFICULTIES MAY BE . . . POLITICAL ACTIVITY WAS 
NEVER AN OBSTACLE TO THE CONTINUATION OF MILITARY 
ACTIVITY, BUT RATHER A MEANS TO ADVANCE AND DEVELOP 
IT\' (AL-ANBA, 24.2). 
 
-   2.  AHMAD ABD AL-RAHMAN, ARAFAT\'S SPOKESMAN: 
\'THE REVOLUTIONARY MARCH WILL CONTINUE, DESPITE THE 
DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES, IN ORDER THAT THE ARMED 
STRUGGLE ADVANCE WITH RANKS UNIFIED, AS THE ARMED 
STRUGGLE IS THE ONLY WAY TO PALESTINE.  THERE IS NO 
OTHER ROUTE TO PALESTINE EXCEPT FOR ARMED STRUGGLE\' 
(FILASTIN ATH-THAWRA, 16.3). 
 
-   3.  THE FATAH \'REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL\':  \'ARMED 
STRUGGLE IS THE PRIMARY FORM OF THE PALESTINIAN 
STRUGGLE TO REALIZE NATIONAL GOALS.  ON THE BASIS OF 
THIS STRUGGLE, THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL HEREBY 
DECIDES TO APPROVE THE PLAN, WHICH WAS ACCEPTED BY 
THE CENTRL COMMITTEE, TO ESCALATE THE ARMED STRUGGLE 
IN THE OCCUPIED LAND\' (CONCLUDING STATEMENT AT THE 
END OF DISCUSSIONS IN TUNIS, 6.4). 
 
-   4.  HANI AL-HASSAN:  \'THE FUTURE WILL IN THE END 
PROVE THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF CONTINUING THE ARMED 
STRUGGLE, BECAUSE IF WE ARE NOT, THAN NEITHER SHALL 
WE BE SUITABLE CLAIMANTS TO REPRESENT THE PALESTINIAN 
PEOPLE\' (ASH-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, 16.4). 
 
-   5.  ARAFAT:  \'THE MOST RECENT GUERILLA ACTION, 
WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT OFF THE COAST OF PALESTINE 
(SINKING OF THE ATAVARIUS ???) WAS NOT THE LAST, 
RATHER IT CONSTITUTES THE BEGINNING OF A SERIES OF 
ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WHICH WILL HURT ISRAEL\' (AL-RAI 
AL-\'AM, 25.4). 
 
-   6.  KHALED AL-HASSAN:  \'WHAT IS NEEDED TODAY IS A 
CHANGE IN THE SCOPE AND CHARACTER OF MILITARY ACTION 
INSIDE ISRAEL.  I AM NOT CALLING FOR SIMPLY ANOTHER 
SUICIDE ACTION, RATHER, AN ACTION WHICH WILL HAVE A 
VERY MAJOR IMPACT ON THE ENEMY FROM THE MATERIAL, 
MORALE, ECONOMIC, AND SECURITY POINTS OF VIEW\' 
(AL-ANBA, 12.6). 
 
-   7.  THE PLO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, AND THE CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE OF \'FATAH\':  \'STEPS MUST BE TAKEN WHICH CAN 
LEAD TO THE CREATION OF SUITABLE CONDITIONS FOR THE 
INTENSIFICATION OF THE PALESTINIAN ARMED STRUGGLE, IN 
ALL ITS FORMS, IN THE OCCUPIED ARAB LANDS\' (DECISION 
AT THE CLOSE OF THEIR MEETING, 23.9). 
 
5.  THE JORDANIANS, AND IN THEIR WAKE THE AMERICANS 
AND EUROPEANS, INTERPRETED THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT 
AGREEMENT AS A PLO CONCESSION ON SEVERAL CENTRAL 
POINTS: 
 
-   A.  ITS APPARENT ACCEPTANCE OF UN RESOLUTION 242. 
 
-   B.  ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF \'LAND FOR 
PEACE\'. 
 
-   C.  ITS ABANDONING THE OPTION OF AN INDEPENDENT 
PALESTINIAN STATE. 
 
-   D.  ITS CONCEDING THE RIGHT TO SOLE 
REPRESENTATION OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. 
 
THE PLO REJECTS THESE JORDANIAN INTERPRETATIONS AND 
INSISTS THAT NO CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN ITS 
POSITIONS ON THESE ISSUES.  FOLLOWING ARE THE CLAIMS 
AND COUNTER-CLAIMS: 
 
-   A.  UN RESOLUTION 242 
 
-        (1)  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT DETERMINES 
IN SECTION 1:  \'LAND IN EXCHANGE FOR PEACE, AS CITED 
IN THE UN RESOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTIONS.\' 
 
-        (2)  IN HIS SPEECH BEFORE THE AMERICAN 
ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE ON 31.5, KING HUSSEIN SAID: 
\'THE PALESTINIANS ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT UNITED 
NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 242 AND 
338 . . . AS A BASIS FOR A SETTLEMENT.\' 
 
-        (3)  HOWEVER, THE PLO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, 
IN ITS APPROVING OF THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT 
(18.2), REJECTED RESOLUTION 242. 
 
-        (4)  ARAFAT HIMSELF CONDITIONED THE 
ACCEPTANCE OF 242 ON AMERICAN RECOGNITION OF THE 
PALESTINIANS\' RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION (INTERVIEW 
WITH THE \'WASHINGTON POST\', 15.5).  WHEN ASKED (BY A 
CORRESPONDENT FROM THE \'WALL STREET JOURNAL\', 7.6), 
TO REITERATE KING HUSSEIN\'S STATEMENTS ((2) ABOVE), 
HE RESPONDED:  \'NO, NO I WON\'T REPEAT IT.  I\'M NOT A 
MONKEY.  I GIVE MY OWN POLITICAL DECLARATIONS\'. 
 
-        (5)  THE PLO DOES NOT ACCEPT THE 
ABOVE-MENTIONED CLAUSE OF THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT 
AGREEMENT AS REFERRING EXPLICITLY TO 242, BUT RATHER 
TO ALL UN AND SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS DEALING 
WITH THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT, COLLECTIVELY.  THUS, 
FOR INSTANCE, KHALED AL-HASSAN, SAID:  \'THE REJECTION 
OF 242 AS THE ONLY BASIS FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION 
MOST DEFINITELY STILL EXISTS.  BUT RESOLUTION 242, 
WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER WITH A SERIES OF OTHER DECISIONS, 
IS NOT TO BE REJECTED . . . ALL THESE DECISIONS 
TOGETHER MEAN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT 
PALESTINIAN STATE, THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION, 
RETURN OF THE REFUGEES, AND RECOGNITION OF THE PLO\' 
(AL-ANB, 11.6). 
 
B.  \'LAND FOR PEACE\' 
 
(1)  IN HIS SPEECH BEFORE THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE 
INSTITUTE (19.3), TAHER AL-MASRI, THE JORDANIAN 
FOREIGN MINISTER, SAID:  \'THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 
JORDANIAN-PALESTINIAN AGREEMENT IS THAT IT OBLIGATES, 
PUBLICLY, THE PLO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, TO ACCEPT THE 
PRINCIPLE OF \'LAND FOR PEACE\'. 
 
(2)  HOWEVER, THE PLO\'S INTERPRETATION OF \'LAND FOR 
PEACE\' IS DIFFERENT THAN THE JORDANIAN 
INTERPRETATION.  ABU JIHAD SAID THE FOLLOWING IN 
KUWAIT (18.5):  \'THE PLO\'S FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH TO 
THE \'LAND FOR PEACE\' QUESTION IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT 
OF JORDAN\'. 
 
(3)  THE PLO DOES NOT SEE THE FORMULATION \'LAND FOR 
PEACE\' AS SIGNIFYING AN EXCHANGE - MAKING PEACE WITH 
ISRAEL IN RETURN FOR GETTING BACK THE TERRITORIES - 
RATHER AS PART OF THE \'THEORY OF STAGES\', THAT IS TO 
SY THE CREATION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE ON ALL LAND 
FROM WHICH ISRAEL WITHDRAWS, AS A STEP TOWARD THE 
CREATION OF A SECULAR-DEMOCRATIC-PALESTINIAN STATE ON 
THE ENTIRE TERRITORY.  THE PLO VIEWS THE FORMULATION 
\'LAND FOR PEACE\' AS PARALLELLING DECISIONS OF THE 
PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL AND THE FEZ SUMMIT.  THUS, 
ARAFAT SAID:  \'LAND FOR PEACE - ON THIS THERE IS ARAB 
AGREEMENT AT FEZ\' (ROZ AL-YUSUF, 12.5).  KHALID AL 
HASSAN SAID THE FOLLOWING:  \'EVERYONE WHO ACCEPTED 
THE DECISIONS OF THE PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL, AND 
THE THEORY OF STAGES, AND ALL WHO ACCEPTED THE FEZ 
DECISIONS, WHICH WERE APPROVED BY BY THE PALESTINE 
NATIONAL COUNCIL (PNC), CANNOT OPPOSE THE SENTENCE 
\'LAND FOR PEACE\', AS AT ITS HEART IS THE \'THEORY OF 
STAGES\'\' (AL-ANBA, 12.6). 
 
C.  AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE 
 
-- (1)  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT STATES (CLAUSE 
3):  \'THE PALESTINIANS SHOULD EXERCISE THEIR 
INALIABLE RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION, WHEN THE 
JORDANIANS AND PALESTINIANS MANAGE TO ACHIEVE THIS 
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN ARAB CONFEDERATION THAT IS 
INTENDED TO BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TWO STATES OF 
JORDAN AND PALESTINE.\' 
 
-- (2)  THE JORDANIANS PRESENT THIS CONFEDERATION NOT 
AS COMPRISING TWO INDEPENDENT STATES, RATHER AS A 
FEDERATION HAVING ONE SOVEREIGN, ONE ARMY, AND ONE 
GOVERNMENT, WHICH IN FACT MEANS THE PLO\'S GIVING UP 
THE OPTION OF AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE. 
 
-- (3)  IN HIS SPEECH BEFORE THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE 
INSTITUTE (19.3), JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER TAHER 
AL-MASRI SAID:  \'THE MEANING OF THE 
JORDANIAN-PALESTINIAN AGREEMENT IS THAT THE PLO NO 
LONGER DEMANDS AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE\'. 
 
-- (4)  HOWEVER, THE PLO PRESENTS THE CONFEDERATION 
AS BEING COMPOSED OF TWO INDEPENDENT STATES, WITH THE 
INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE HAVING TO COME INTO 
BEING \'BEFORE\' THE ESTABLISIMENT OF THE 
CONFEDERATION.  THUS, KHALED AL-HASSAN SAID:  \'THE 
CONFEDERATION WILL BE BETWEEN TWO SOVEREIGN STATES. 
A PALESTINIAN STATE WILL BE ESTABLISHED \'BEFORE\' THE 
CONFEDERATION, EVEN IF THE CONFEDERATION IS 
ESTABLISHED FIVE MINUTES AFTER INDEPENDENCE\' 
(COTIDIENNE DE PARIS, 25.3). 
 
-- (5)  THE PLO LEADERS EMPHASIZE THAT IN ADDITION TO 
THE AGREEMENT WITH JORDAN, HUSSEIN SENT A \'MEMORANDUM 
OF CLARIFICATION\' ON 4.3, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE 
\'PALESTINIAN PEOPLE\'S RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION 
RESIDES IN A UNITED STATE OF PALESTINE HAVING A 
CONFEDERAL CONNECTION TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF 
JORDAN\'. 
 
-- (6)  THE JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER\'S DECLARATION 
THAT THE PLO GAVE UP THE OPTION OF AN INDEPENDENT 
PALESTINIAN STATE (SEE ABOVE, (3)), WHICH HE REPEATED 
AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON (5.6), DURING 
HUSSEIN\'S VISIT TO THE US, PRODUCED ANGRY REACTIONS 
FROM THE PLO: 
 
-   (A)  ABU IYAD:  \'ACCORDING TO THE KING\'S 
DECISIONS, AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE MUST 
FIRST BE DECLARED, AND ONLY AFTERWARDS WILL THE 
CONFEDERATION WITH JORDAN BE ESTABLISHED\' (REUTER, 
6.6). 
 
-   (B)  KADDOUMI:  \'THE PALESTINIANS MUST REALIZE 
THEIR RIGHT TO INDEPENDENCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION, 
AND ONLY AFTERWARDS WILL THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE 
DECIDE IF IT IS INTERESTED IN CONFEDERATION WITH 
JORDAN\' (IN STOCKHOLM, 6.6). 
 
-   (C)  HANI AL-HASSAN:  \'THE AMMAN AGREEMENT IS 
EXCEEDINGLY CLEAR; IT SPEAKS OF ARAB CONFEDERAL UNION 
BETWEEN TWO STATES -- JORDAN AND PALESTINE\' 
(AL-BIYADER AL-SIYASI, 15.6). 
 
D.  PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATION 
 
(1)  THE HUSSEIN-ARAFAT AGREEMENT STATES IN CLAUSE 
5:  \'PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE HELD WITHIN THE 
FRAMEWORK OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE, TO BE 
ATTENDED BY THE FIVE UN SECURITY COUNCIL PERMANENT 
MEMBER-STATES AND ALL PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT, 
INCLUDING THE PLO, WHICH IS THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE\'S 
SOLE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE WITHIN A JOINT 
DELEGATION -- A JOINT JORDANIAN-PALESTINIAN 
DELEGATION.\' 
 
(2)  SOME SAW THE REFERENCE TO A JOINT DELEGATION AS 
A DEVIATION FROM THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE FEZ SUMMIT 
(1974), WHICH GRANTED THE PLO SOLE RIGHT TO REPRESENT 
THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. 
 
(3)  BUT THE PLO REJECTS THIS REASONING AND INSISTS 
THAT IT ALONE HAS THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THE 
PALESTINIANS.  THE \'FATAH\' CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S 
\'MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING\' (20.3) SAID AS 
FOLLOWS:  \'THE PLO, AS A SOLE AND LEGAL 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, IS THE BODY 
RECOGNIZED BY THE ARABS AND THE WORLD AS HAVING SOLE 
LEGITIMACY TO NEGOTIATE WITHOUT GRANTING POWER OF 
ATTORNEY, OR AGREEMENT, OR PERMISSION TO ANY OTHER 
PARTY TO PARTICIPATE WITH IT IN REPRESENTING THE 
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE IN ALL MATTERS.\"

SUBJECT:  ISLAMIC GROUP, HAMAS, OUTLAWED 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  ON SEPTEMBER 28, THE ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTRY 
ANNOUNCED THAT THE PALESTINIAN (SUNNI) MUSLIM 
FUNDAMENTALIST ORGANIZATION, HAMAS, HAD BEEN 
OUTLAWED.  ACCORDING TO THE IDF ANNOUNCEMENT, MEMBERS 
OF HAMAS, OR THOSE WHO SUPPORTED OR PARTICIPATED IN 
ITS ACTIVITIES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DETENTION AND 
PROSECUTION. 
 
3.  THE SPIRITUAL LEADER OF HAMAS, SHEIKH AHMED 
YASSIN, HAS BEEN IN ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION FOR A 
NUMBER OF MONTHS.  HAMAS EMERGED AFTER THE OUTBREAK 
OF THE PALESTINIAN UPRISING. ALTHOUGH IT EMERGED FROM 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, ITS AIMS INCLUDE A MUSLIM 
PALESTINIAN STATE AND IT PROMOTES VIOLENCE AS A MEANS 
OF ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE AND OF \"PURIFYING\" MUSLIM 
SOCIETY.  HAMAS IS STRONGEST IN GAZA BUT ITS 
INFLUENCE HAS SPREAD TO THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK. 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO MOSHE DAYAN, DEPUTY TO GOI CIVAD 
COORDINATOR SHMUEL GOREN, AND CIVAD ANALYSTS, HAMAS 
HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY IN STRENGTH IN GAZA IN RECENT 
MONTHS.  IT HAS INCREASINGLY TARGETED SO-CALLED 
COLLABORATORS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ENGAGE IN 
ACTIVITIES DEFINED BY THE ORGANIZATION AS 
ANTI-ISLAMIC.  ACCORDING TO THE IDF, HAMAS IS ALSO 
STRENGTHENING ITS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND 
REMAINS HARDER TO PENETRATE THAN OTHER PALESTINIAN 
ORGANIZATIONS.  IDF ANALYSTS HAVE ALSO ASSERTED THAT 
HAMAS HAS BECOME A MAJOR INFLUENCE IN GAZA AND, 
BECAUSE OF ITS WILLINGNESS TO USE VIOLENCE TO 
INTIMIDATE OTHER PALESTINIANS, MAY HAVE BECOME THE 
DOMINANT FORCE THERE. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  EARLIER IN THE UPRISING, SOME ISRAELI 
OCCUPATION OFFICIALS INDICATED THAT HAMAS SERVED AS A 
USEFUL COUNTER TO THE SECULAR ORGANIZATIONS LOYAL TO 
THE PLO.  A NUMBER OF PALESTINIANS LOYAL TO THE PLO 
ALLEGED THAT THE IDF WAS USING HAMAS FOR SUCH A 
PURPOSE.  OUTLAWING THE ORGANIZATION INKCATES THAT 
THE IDF NO LONGER SEES -- IF IT EVER DID -- UTILITY 
IN ALLOWING HAMAS TO OPERATE.  THE ISRAELIS MAY HAVE 
BEEN PARTICULARLY TROUBLED OVER THE DIFFICULTY OF 
PENETRATING THE ORGANIZATION.  AS HAMAS HAS DIRECTED 
MORE VIOLENCE AGAINST ALLEGED COLLABORATORS, IT IS 
LIKELY THAT THE OCCUPATION AUTHORITIES DECIDED ACTION 
WAS NEEDED TO DISCOURAGE ITS FURTHER GROWTH. 
 
6.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  WHILE A NUMBER OF OUR 
PALESTINIAN INTERLOCUTORS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HAMAS HAS 
GROWN IN STRENGTH, PARTICULARLY IN GAZA, WE DO NOT 
BELIEVE THAT IT CLAIMS THE ALLEGIANCE OF A LARGE 
SEGMENT OF THE PALESTINIAN POPULATION.  WE SUSPECT IT 
REMAINS LESS INFLUENTIAL IN THE WEST BANK. 
NONETHELESS, THE CHRONIC NATURE OF THE UPRISING 
COUPLED WITH STRINGENT ISRAELI SECURITY MEASURES, 
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO GREATER VIOLENCE WITHIN THE 
PALESTINIAN COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY IN GAZA.  IN 
ADDITION, ISRAELI DETENTION/EXPULSION OF MANY 
PALESTINIAN SECULAR NATIONALISTS HAS LEFT THE STREETS 
OPEN TO YOUNG TOUGHS WHO FIND IT ATTRACTIVE TO CLAIM 
RELIGIOUS, AS WELL AS NATIONALISTIC MOTIVES TO 
JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS.  END COMMENT

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY  AN ISLAMIC JIHAD ACTIVIST LAID OUT AN 
UNCOMPROMISING VIEW OF HIS ORGANIZATION\'S OPPOSITION TO 
THE PEACE PROCESS AND FUTURE AIMS.  WHILE CRITICAL OF 
PALESTINIANS ENGAGED IN THE CURRENT DIALOGUE, THE 
ACTIVIST ASSERTED THAT HIS GROUP WOULD NOT EMPLOY 
VIOLENCE TO STOP THE PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IN THE EMBASSY\'S FIRST CONTACT WITH ISLAMIC JIHAD, 
POLOFF MET WITH ACTIVIST \"MAHMOUD\" DURING A NOVEMBER 21 
VISIT TO GAZA.  THE MEETING WAS ARRANGED THROUGH AN 
EMBASSY JOURNALIST CONTACT WHO HAS LINKS TO BOTH ISLAMIC 
JIHAD AND \"HAMAS.\"  POLOFF\'S JOURNALIST CONTACT TOLD 
POLOFF THAT HE HAD TRIED TO SET UP MEETINGS WITH ISLAMIC 
JIHAD REPRESENTATIVES BUT THAT THE ORGANIZATION HAD 
REFUSED TO MEET WITH AMERICANS.  UNBEKNOWNST TO POLOFF 
AND GAZA JOURNALIST CONTACT, THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ACTIVIST 
SHOWED UP AT THE JOURNALIST\'S OFFICE AFTER POLOFF AND 
CONTACT HAD RETURNED FROM MEETING \"HAMAS\" LEADER MAHMOUD 
AL-ZAHAR.  POLOFF TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
PROBE ABOUT ISLAMIC JIHAD POLICY TOWARD THE PEACE 
PROCESS. 
 
4.  REFUSING TO DIVULGE HIS REAL NAME OR THE BRANCH OF 
ISLAMIC JIHAD HE BELONGED TO, \"MAHMOUD\" SAID HIS 
ORGANIZATION TRADITIONALLY SAW NO BENEFIT TO MEETING 
WITH USG REPRESENTATIVES GIVEN THE \"CRIMINAL\" APPROACH 
THE US HAS TAKEN TOWARD THE ARAB/ISRAELI DISPUTE AND THE 
ISLAMIC WORLD.  NONETHELESS, HE AGREED TO LAY OUT 
ISLAMIC JIHAD\'S POSITION ON THE CURRENT PEACE PROCESS 
LEST THERE BE ANY MISUNDERSTANDING.  THROUGHOUT THE 
SESSION, \"MAHMOUD\" REMAINED CORDIAL AND CALM, ALLOWING 
POLOFF TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS. 
 
NO COMPROMISE 
------------- 
 
5.  IN A GIVE-AND-TAKE THAT LASTED ONE-HALFHOUR, 
\"MAHMOUD\" OFFERED A SCATHING INDICTMENT OF CURRENT US 
EFFORTS TO DIVIDE THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND OFFER NOTHING 
MORE THAN \"CRUMBS\" TO PALESTINIANS IN THE FORM OF 
AUTONOMY AND PERHAPS EVENTUAL CONFEDERATION WITH 
JORDAN.  ISLAMIC JIHAD, HE SAID, TOTALLY REJECTS ANY 
APPROACH THAT LEAVES ISRAEL IN CONTROL OF ANY 
\"PALESTINIAN TERRITORY-\"  ISLAMIC JIHAD\'S GOAL IS AN 
ISLAMIC STATE ENCOMPASSING ALL OF THE WEST BANK, GAZA, 
AND ISRAEL IN WHICH ISRAELI JEWS WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE 
AS \"PROTECTED SUBJECTS\" AS THEY HAD UNDER MUSLIM RULE 
FOR CENTURIES. 
 
6.  \"MAHMOUD\" ASSERTED THAT, IF NECESSARY, HIS CHILDREN 
AND GRANDCHILDREN COULD LIVE WITH THE STATUS QUO. 
ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC JIHAD, THE END OF ISRAEL AS A 
JEWISH STATE IS INEVITABLE.  HE SAID MUSLIMS HAVE ONLY 
TO LOOK TO THE END OF THE BRITISH, IRANIAN, AND SOVIET 
EMPIRES FOR RECENT EXAMPLES OF EVENTS THAT WERE ONCE 
THOUGHT \"UNIMAGINABLE.\"  MUSLIMS RETAIN THE KORAN AS AN 
UNCHANGING LODESTONE AND CAN BE VERY PATIENT, HE SAID. 
 
NO VIOLENCE TO OPPOSE PEACE PROCESS 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. ASKED IF ISLAMIC JIHAD WOULD USE VIOLENCE AGAINST 
THOSE PALESTINIANS ENGAGED IN THE CURRENT DISCUSSIONS 
WITH ISRAEL, \"MAHMOUD\" SAID ISLAMIC JIHAD, WHILE 
CONTINUING TO CRITICIZE CURRENT EFFORTS, WOULD NOT 
ACTIVELY OPPOSE PALESTINIAN EFFORTS TO GET A SOLUTION. 
HE SAID THE ORGANIZATION, IN ANY CASE, WOULD NOT USE 
VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHER PALESTINIANS.  HOWEVER, IF 
PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATIVES DID ANYTHING THAT SMACKED OF 
A SELLOUT OF ANY ASPECT OF PALESTINIAN INTERESTS, 
ISLAMIC JIHAD WOULD BRING TO BEAR \"ALL OTHER INFLUENCES 
IT HAD.\"  HE REPEATED THAT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD IS NOT 
A COURSE ISLAMIC JIHAD WOULD PURSUE. 
 
8.  COMMENT:  THE COMMENTS BY THIS ISLAMIC JIHAD 
REPRESENTATIVE LEAVE NO ROOM FOR COMPROMISE, IN CONTRAST 
TO THE BIT OF DAYLIGHT SUGGESTED BY \"HAMAS\" LEADER 
AL-ZAHAR (REF).  DESPITE STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE 
CURRENT PEACE EFFORTS, BOTH ISLAMIC ORGANIZATIONS HAVE 
TOLD US THEY WILL NOT USE VIOLENCE TO STOP THE PROCESS. 
WHETHER THOSE DISAVOWALS HOLD UP IN THE FACE OF PROGRESS 
IN THE NEGOTIATIONS REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  GAZAN CONTACTS CLAIM THAT A \"MINI-WAR\" BETWEEN HAMAS 
AND THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION (IJO) HAS BEEN TAKING 
PLACE OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS.  THESE CONTACTS TOLD 
POLOFF THAT THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE TWO ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS HAS RESULTED IN SEVERAL CLASHES 
WHICH HAVE LEFT TWO HAMAS MEMBERS AND ONE IJO MEMBER 
DEAD.  THE DISPUTE HAS ALSO RESULTED IN A \"BATTLE\" FOR 
CONTROL OF MOSQUES IN GAZA.  ONE SOURCE ASSERTED THAT 
HAMAS ACTIVISTS HAD RECENTLY DESTROYED A LIBRARY 
BELONGING TO THE IJO. 
 
3.  ONE SOURCE OF FRICTION, ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACTS, 
HAS BEEN HAMAS ATTEMPTS TO ENLIST IJO SUPPORT IN ITS 
RECENT CLASHES WITH FATAH (REPORTEDLY OVER THE PEACE 
PROCESS) WHICH RESULTED IN SEVERAL KILLINGS AND 
CASUALTIES DURING THE PAST THREE MONTHS.  THE IJO 
APPARENTLY REJECTED THESE EFFORTS AND INSTEAD BEGAN A 
SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ONE OF HAMAS\' LEADERS, MAHMOUD 
AL-ZAHAR, ACCUSING HIM IN A WIDELY-DISTRIBUTED PAMPHLET 
OF BEING AN \"ISRAELI COLLABORATOR.\" 
 
4.  THE TWO GROUPS ALSO REPORTEDLY DIFFER OVER THE 
EXTENT TO WHICH ISLAM SHOULD DIRECT THE POLITICAL AGENDA 
OF FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS IN GAZA.  IJO AND THE OTHER 
ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP IN GAZA, \"AL-DAWAH\" (A 
SUNNI GROUP UNRELATED TO THE SHIA GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR 
TERRORIST ACTS IN THE GULF), REPORTEDLY HAVE ATTACKED 
HAMAS FOR ITS WILLINGNESS TO FAVOR \"POLITICAL\" 
ACCOMMODATION OVER THE UNCOMPROMISING REJECTIONIST 
APPROACH OF THE MORE FUNDAMENTALIST IJO. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  GAZAN CONTACTS TOLD US THAT HAMAS HAS 
SIGNALLED RENEWED INTEREST TO PARTICIPATE IN A MUNICIPAL 
COUNCIL IN GAZA, IF THAT ISSUE SURFACES AGAIN.  ISRAELI 
OFFICIALS, TOO, HAVE ASSERTED THAT HAMAS IN GAZA HAS 
RECENTLY SHOWN A PRAGMATIC STREAK ON POLITICAL ISSUES. 
WHILE THESE REPORTED IJO CLAIMS ON HAMAS ORIENTATION MAY 
BE JUSTIFIED, HAMAS CONTINUES TO EXERCISE ITS MILITARY 
AND REJECTIONIST SIDES AS WELL.

SUBJECT:  HAMAS ARRESTS:  THE POLITICS OF PRESSURE 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  PALESTINIAN MILITARY LEADERS DESCRIBED 
THE JUNE 26 ARREST OF 40 HAMAS ACTIVISTS AS A 
NECESSARY STEP TO FORCE HAMAS TO CEASE VIOLENT 
ACTIVITIES IN GAZA AND ENTER THE POLITICAL PROCESS. 
THE ARRESTS, AUTHORIZED BY PLO CHAIRMAN ARAFAT AT A 
LATE NIGHT JUNE 25 \"SECURITY COUNCIL\" MEETING, WERE 
IN REACTION TO HAMAS LEAFLETS CLAIMING 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JUNE 25 DONKEY CART SUICIDE 
BOMBING (WHICH SLIGHTLY GRAZED THREE ISRAELI 
SOLDIERS).  CHARGES WILL NOT BE BROUGHT AGAINST MOST 
OF THOSE DETAINED, ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, AND 
MOST WILL BE RELEASED \"WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.\" 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  ON JUNE 27, EMBOFF MET SEPARATELY WITH CHIEF OF 
PALESTINIAN SECURITY FORCES NASSER YUSIF AND 
CIVILIAN POLICE CHIEF GHAZI JABALI TO DISCUSS THE 
ARRESTS OF HAMAS ACTIVITIES EARLY ON JUNE 26.  WHILE 
THEIR VIEWS SOMETIMES DIVERGE WIDELY, IN THIS 
INSTANCE THEIR COMMENTS WERE SIMILAR:  IN PLO 
CHAIRMAN ARAFAT\'S EYES,  HAMAS\' CLAIM OF 
RESPONSIBILITY (DISAVOWED LATER IN A SECOND LEAFLET) 
FOR THE JUNE 26 DONKEY CART SUICIDE BOMBER NEAR KHAN 
YUNIS WAS PROOF OF THE VIOLATION OF THE UNWRITTEN 
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PA AND HAMAS TO REFRAIN 
FROM VIOLENT ACTS WITHIN GAZA.  ARAFAT FELT HE HAD 
TO TAKE A STAND.  IN A \"SECURITY COUNCIL\" MEETING 
LATE JUNE 25, ARAFAT ISSUED THE ORDER TO ARREST 40 
MEMBERS OF HAMAS, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT BY ALL 
BRANCHES OF THE PALESTINIAN ARMED FORCES EARLY JUNE 
26. 
 
PA SECURITY CHIEF ON HAMAS ARREST 
--------------------------------- 
3.  OF THE 40 ARRESTED, YUSIF DESCRIBED 18 OF THEM 
AS THE BULK OF THE GAZA-BASED POLITICAL LEADERSHIP 
OF HAMAS (INCLUDING AHMED BAHER, MAHMOUD ZAHAR, AND 
MUHSEN ABU EITA);  THE REST WERE VARIOUS ACTIVISTS 
ON WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A LIST OF \"USUAL SUSPECTS.\" 
BOTH SOURCES TOLD US THAT ARAFAT PERSONALLY CHOSE TO 
CONCENTRATE ON THE POLITICAL RATHER THAN MILITARY 
LEADERSHIP OF HAMAS, ALTHOUGH YUSIF SAID THAT HE HAD 
COUNSELED ARAFAT TO ARREST THE MILITARY LEADERS 
INSTEAD.  BOTH JABALI AND YUSIF BELIEVE THAT HAMAS 
CARRIED OUT THE DONKEY CART INCIDENT AND THAT THE 
BELATED DENIALS WERE MERELY IN REACTION TO THE 
PRESSURE OF THE ARRESTS. 
 
POLICE CHIEF VIEWS 
------------------ 
4.  JABALI SAID THAT THE ARRESTS WERE A \"POLITICAL\" 
STEP.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHER CIVILIAN 
AUTHORITIES HAD NOT BEEN INVOLVED.  NO CHARGES HAD 
BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE DETAINEES.  HE PREDICTED 
THAT MOST -- BUT NOT ALL -- WOULD BE RELEASED WITHIN 
48 HOURS, A VIEW SECONDED BY YUSIF.  JABALI 
DISMISSED THE RUMORS OF IRREGULAR TREATMENT OF THE 
HAMAS ACTIVISTS IN HIS CUSTODY, SAYING THAT HIS 
POLICE HAD MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT THAN 
\"SHAVING THE BEARD OF SHEIKH AHMED\" (BAHER).  \"BUT I 
CAN\'T SPEAK FOR THOSE BEING DETAINED BY THE SECRET 
POLICE,\" HE ADDED. 
 
POLITICAL IMPACT OF ARAFAT\'S STEP 
--------------------------------- 
5.  YUSIF CRITICIZED HOW THE ARRESTS WERE MADE, 
SAYING THAT LEGAL WARRANTS COULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED 
AND CHARGES BROUGHT, BUT HE AGREED WITH JABALI THAT 
THE ARRESTS THEMSELVES WERE A NECESSARY STEP.  BOTH 
PREDICTED THAT BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE HAMAS WOULD 
BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE 
PA.  BOTH NOTED THAT HAMAS HAD NOT CUT OFF TALKS IN 
RESPONSE TO THE ARRESTS. 
 
6.  RESPONDING TO EMBOFF\'S QUESTIONS, JABALI 
COMMENTED THAT HE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR A POSSIBLE 
BACKLASH FROM HAMAS, BUT HE EXPECTED THAT THE IMPACT 
OF THE ARRESTS WOULD MOSTLY BE POSITIVE, RATHER THAN 
NEGATIVE.  JABALI AND YUSIF SAID THAT THE TIMING HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JULY 1 \"DEADLINE\" FOR 
REDEPLOYMENT NEGOTIATIONS, AND BOTH PREDICTED THAT 
GAZA WOULD REMAIN CALM IF THAT \"DEADLINE\" WERE 
MISSED, SINCE THE PA IS IN FIRM CONTROL OF THE 
SECURITY SITUATION.  JABALI EXPESSED MORE CONCERN 
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE WEST BANK, WHERE 
HAMAS ACTIVITISTS ARE UNDER LESS PA CONTROL AND 
PRESSURE. 
 
A DISSENTING VIEW 
----------------- 
7.  SAMIR SIKSEK, YUSIF\'S DEPUTY, EARLIER OFFERED AN 
INTERPRETATION OF THE ARRESTS WHICH DIVERGED GREATLY 
FROM THAT OF HIS BOSS AND OF JABALI.  IN HIS VIEW, 
ARAFAT HOPED TO GOAD HAMAS INTO A VIOLENT REACTION 
TO PROVIDE AN EXCUSE FOR THE ISRAELIS TO SLOW 
NEGOTIATIONS.  THAT WAY, ACCORDING TO SIKSEK, IF 
WHAT THE PALESTINIANS CONSIDER THE \"DEADLINE\" OF 
JULY 1 IS MISSED, ARAFAT COULD BLAME HAMAS AND 
PRESERVE HIS OWN POPULARITY.  SIKSEK ARGUED THAT THE 
ARRESTS WERE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ARAFAT\'S ARBITRARY 
AND AUTOCRATIC RULE WHICH SHOULD CONCERN THE UNITED 
STATES, IF THE USG IS STILL PROMOTING PALESTINIAN 
DEMOCRACY.  (COMMENT:  IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT 
SIKSEK RARELY MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRITICIZE 
ARAFAT AMD THAT HE DID NOT EXPRESS THESE VIEWS IN 
FRONT OF YUSIF.  END COMMENT.)

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 
(PA) AND HAMAS APPEARS IMMINENT.  REPORTEDLY, AFTER 
A LOCAL HAMAS DELEGATION MET WITH OUTSIDE LEADERS, 
CONSENSUS WAS REACHED ON THE ORGANIZATION\'S NEED TO 
MOVE FROM ARMED OPPOSITION TO ISRAEL, TO POLITICAL 
OPPOSITION IN ORDER TO AVOID BECOMING IRRELEVANT. 
HAMAS LOST SUPPORT IN GAZA AFTER THE ISRAELIS AND 
THE PA SUCCEEDED IN CEMENTING THE LINK BETWEEN HAMAS 
MILITARY ACTIONS AND THE CLOSURE ON GAZA AND OTHER 
ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUMBER OF 
HAMAS MEMBERS WHO BELIEVE THAT POLITICAL 
PARTICIPATION IS THE ONLY WAY FOR HAMAS TO REGAIN 
POPULAR SUPPORT AND TAKE ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN 
PALESTINIAN PUBLIC LIFE INCREASED.  THESE MODERATES, 
HOWEVER, FACE HAMAS RADICALS INSIDE GAZA AS WELL AS 
ABROAD, WHO REMAIN COMMITTED TO CONTINUING ARMED 
STRUGGLE AGAINST ISRAEL AND WHO HAVE TRIED TO CAST 
SUSPICION ON THOSE WHO WANT TO TRY OTHER METHODS. 
EVEN WHEN THE ORGANIZATION TAKES A FORMAL DECISION 
TO ABJURE MILITARY OPERATIONS, THE POSSIBILITY OF 
ROGUE OPERATIONS REMAINS HIGH. 
 
 
GAZANS WELCOME RESPITE FROM ATTACKS 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.  PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) OFFICIALS AND PRIVATE 
GAZANS AGREE THAT PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR HAMAS MILITARY 
ACTIONS HAS DECREASED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT MONTHS 
(REF A).  UNTIL THE GOI IMPOSED THE LATEST CLOSURE 
(WHICH HAS ALREADY LASTED MORE THAN A MONTH) GAZANS 
HAD BECOME USED TO A MEASURE OF NORMALCY IN THEIR 
DAILY LIVES AND A CHANCE TO ENJOY SOME OF THE 
VISIBLE IMPROVEMENTS IN GAZA.  THESE INCLUDED THE 
ABILITY OF THOSE WITH PERMITS TO GO TO THEIR JOBS IN 
ISRAEL.  GAZANS HAVE ALSO WELCOMED THE SIGNS OF 
INCREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN GAZA.  INCREASED 
CONSTRUCTION IS THE MOST FREQUENT EXAMPLE.  WHILE 
UNSURE WHO WILL LIVE IN ALL THE BUILDINGS GOING UP, 
GAZANS SEE THEM AS PROOF THAT PEOPLE WITH MONEY HAVE 
FAITH IN THE AREA\'S FUTURE. 
 
 
PA CAPITALIZED ON GOI PENALTIES 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  PALESTINIANS ARE UNANIMOUS IN THEIR BELIEF THAT 
CLOSURES IN RESPONSE TO TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE A FORM 
OF COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEY 
GRUDGINGLY AGREE THAT THEY WORKED.  ATTACKS STOPPED 
DURING CLOSURES, AND THE PUBLIC SUFFERING FROM THE 
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES, LED MANY TO RESENT THE 
ATTACKS THAT BROUGHT THE CLOSURES.  PA OFFICIALS AND 
GAZANS WITH CLOSE CONTACTS TO HAMAS OFFICIALS 
BELIEVE THAT ARAFAT WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE GAZANS THAT 
HAMAS IS NOT ONLY CAUSING ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS ON 
PALESTINIANS THROUGH ITS MILITARY ACTIONS, BUT HAS 
ALSO FAILED--UNLIKE THE PA--IN THE PRIMARY 
PALESTINIAN GOAL OF REGAINING TERRITORY FROM ISRAEL. 
ALTHOUGH MOST GAZANS EXPECTED A LENGTHY CLOSURE 
AROUND THE JEWISH HOLIDAYS, THE GOI PUBLIC 
ANNOUNCEMENT, THAT THE CURRENT CLOSURE (SCHEDULED TO 
BE LIFTED OCTOBER 17) IS IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC 
THREATS FROM RADICAL GROUPS, INCLUDING HAMAS, KEEPS 
THE LINKAGE FRONT AND CENTER. 
 
 
WHAT HAMAS WANTED FROM THE PA 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  HAMAS MEMBERS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEIR 
STANDING AMONG GAZANS HAS FALLEN.  THAT, ALONG WITH 
THE PA\'S DEMONSTRATED READINESS TO ENGAGE THEIR 
MILITARY WING, ARREST AND ILL-TREAT THEIR MEMBERS 
(INCLUDING THEIR POLITICAL SPOKESMEN), PRESSURE 
THEIR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND SHUT DOWN THEIR 
PUBLICATIONS, LED THEM TO NEGOTIATIONS.  HAMAS HOPED 
TO GAIN FACE-SAVING MEASURES IN EXCHANGE FOR HALTING 
ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS.  ACCORDING TO PA OFFI 
CIALS, THESE INCLUDED THE RELEASE OF ALL OF THEIR MEMBERS 
IN DETENTION (REPORTEDLY, EVEN THOSE SENTENCED BY 
THE SECURITY COURT); A GUARANTEE OF MID-LEVEL 
POSITIONS IN THE PA; A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SEATS AFTER 
PALESTINIAN GENERAL ELECTIONS; AND PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE 
OF RESPONSIBILITY  FOR THE BLOODY CLASH IN 1994 
WHICH LEFT 16 PALESTINIANS DEAD. 
 
 
OSLO II DRASTICALLY ALTERED THE BALANCE OF POWER 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6.  AS THE OSLO II NEGOTIATIONS GOT UNDERWAY, 
PRESSURE ON HAMAS TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE 
PA MOUNTED.  WHILE PA OFFICIALS (INCLUDING PA 
SECRETARY GENERAL TAYYIB ABDURRAHIM, JUSTICE 
MINISTER FREIH ABU MIDDEIN AND PALESTINIAN POLICE 
COMMANDER NASIR YUSIF) ALL MAINTAINED THAT HAMAS WAS 
READY TO COME TO CLOSURE WITH THE PA, PROVIDED IT 
DID NOT HAVE TO PUBLICLY SWEAR OFF ALL MILITARY 
ACTIONS AGAINST ISRAELIS AND WAS PROMISED A REAL 
VOICE IN THE AUTHORITY, ARAFAT WITHHELD AGREEMENT ON 
A DRAFT ACCORD THAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED.  YUSIF TOLD 
US OCTOBER 12 THAT ARAFAT HAD REFUSED TO SIGN IN THE 
BELIEF THAT HE COULD GET WHAT HE NEEDED FROM HAMAS 
WITHOUT MEETING MOST OF THEIR DEMANDS.  YUSIF 
BELIEVED THAT SUBSEQUENT EVENTS HAVE PROVED ARAFAT 
RIGHT. 
 
 
PA AND HAMAS REPORTEDLY NOW ON THE BRINK OF 
ANNOUNCING AGREEMENT 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  THE CONCLUSION OF THE OSLO II AGREEMENT 
APPARENTLY BOLSTERED THE MODERATES IN HAMAS AND A 
TEAM OF HAMAS SUPPORTERS WAS DISPATCHED TO KHARTOUM 
TO GAIN CONCURRENCE FROM HAMAS LEADERS ABROAD.  ABU 
MIDDEIN TOLD US LATE OCTOBER 12 THAT THE TEAM HAD 
BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  SIMILARLY, GAZA REUTERS CHIEF, 
TAHER SHRITEH, TOLD US OCTOBER 13 THAT A SENIOR PA 
OFFICIAL HAD TOLD HIM THAT THE HAMAS DELEGATION HAD 
RETURNED FROM SUDAN WITH A NEW DRAFT AGREEMENT, AND 
THAT AFTER A MIDNIGHT MEETING WITH PA OFFICIALS, 
BOTH SIDES WERE WILLING TO SIGN IT.  SHRITEH SAID 
BOTH SIDES WERE UNWILLING TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS 
NOW, BUT HE EXPECTED AN ANNOUNCEMENT, IF NOT TODAY, 
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
 
8.  IN THIS REGARD, IN PUBLIC REMARKS OCTOBER 13, 
HAMAS LEADER MAHMOUD ZAHAR ALLUDED TO HAMAS\' (AND 
OTHER PARTIES) OBJECTIONS TO THE DRAFT PARTIES LAW 
(SEPTEL), HE SAID \"WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO 
PARTICIPATE IN ANY ELECTION, BUT NOW WE CANNOT SPEAK 
ABOUT ELECTIONS EXCEPT AFTER KNOWING WHAT ARE THE 
DETAILS OF SUCH ELECTION.\"  RESPONDING TO A QUESTION 
ABOUT WHETHER HAMAS WOULD PARTICIPATE IN A 
GOVERNMENT WITH THE PA, ZAHAR REPLIED, \"THIS 
ACTUALLY WILL DEPEND ON THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION. 
SO NO OBJECTION ACTUALLY TO RULE EVERYTHING IN THE 
PROCESS OF RECONSTRUCTION.\"  ASKED WHETHER HAMAS 
TERRORISM WOULD END AT SOME STAGE, ZAHAR SAID \"WE 
HOPE SO....\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 

9.  ZAHAR\'S REMARKS ARE NOTEWORTHY COMING IN THE 
DIRECT WAKE OF THE HAMAS DELEGATION\'S RETURN FROM 
SUDAN.  HAMAS\' AGREEMENT TO REFRAIN FROM MILITARY 
OPERATIONS WILL BE KEY TO IMPLEMENTING OSLO II.  IT 
IS WORTH REMEMBERING HOWEVER, THAT IN ADDITION TO 
ROGUE IZZADIN AL QASSAM CELLS, ELEMENTS IN 
PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD REMAIN COMMITTED TO ARMED 
STRUGGLE AGAINST ISRAEL.  OPERATIONS LIKE THE 
JANUARY ATTACK AT BET LID MAKE CLEAR THAT EVEN WITH 
HAMAS FORMALLY ON BOARD, OTHERS COULD PUT A SPANNER 
IN THE WORKS OF OSLO II IMPLEMENTATION.

1.  (U)  THREE HAMAS ACTIVISTS ESCAPED FROM THE MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE WING OF GAZA CENTRAL PRISON OCTOBER 22.  TWO OF 
THEM, YUSEF MALAHI AND OSAMA ABU TAHA, HAD BEEN IMPLICATED IN 
LETHAL ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELIS AND HAD BEEN SENTENCED TO 12 YEAR 
SENTENCES BY THE PALESTINIAN SECURITY COURT.  THE THIRD, IMAD 
AQIL, HAD BEEN ARRESTED WHILE ATTEMPTING TO CARRY OUT A SUICIDE 
ATTACK AGAINST AN ISRAELI SETTLEMENT IN GAZA.  AQIL TURNED 
HIMSELF INTO POLICE A LITTLE OVER 24 HOURS AFTER THE ESCAPE. 
 
NOWHERE TO RUN 
-------------- 
 
2. (C)  THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) ATTORNEY GENERAL KHALID AL 
QIDRAH TOLD POLOFF OCTOBER 23, (EVEN BEFORE AQIL TURNED HIMSELF 
IN) THAT A SEARCH AND INVESTIGATION WERE UNDERWAY AND HE DID NOT 
EXPECT THE TWO REMAINING ESCAPEES TO REMAIN AT LARGE FOR LONG. 
\"GAZA IS SMALL AND THEY ARE WELL-KNOWN.\"  GAZA REUTERS CHIEF 
TAHER SHRITEH, WHO MAINTAINS CONTACTS WITH HAMAS MEMBERS, 
DISAGREED WITH AL QIDRAH ABOUT WHETHER ABU TAHA AND MALAHI COULD 
REMAIN AT LARGE FOR LONG.  CITING WANTED PALESTINIANS\' ABILITY TO 
AVOID CAPTURE UNDER ISRAELI RULE, HE ADDED THAT EVEN TRAPPED IN 
GAZA, UNLESS THE TWO TURNED THEMSELVES IN, THE SEARCH COULD BE 
LENGTHY.  BOTH AL QIDRAH AND SHRITEH SAID THEY BELIEVED THAT SOME 
OF THE GUARDS WERE PROBABLY SYMPATHETIC TO HAMAS AND HELPED IN 
THE ESCAPE.  LOCAL MEDIA REPORTED THAT FIVE PA MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO THE 
ESCAPE. 
 
GOI KEEPS AN OPEN MIND, BUT WARY OF PA/HAMAS INTENTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3.  (C)  ARAB AFFAIRS ADVISOR SHALOM HARARI (PROTECT) TOLD POLOFF 
THAT THE GOI HAD NO \"PROOF\" THAT THERE WAS PA COLLUSION IN THE 
ESCAPE, OR EVEN THAT SENIOR OFFICIALS IN HAMAS SUPPORTED THE 
ESCAPE.  HE SAID THE GOI WOULD WATCH TO SEE HOW THE INCIDENT 
PLAYED OUT, BUT THE FACT WAS THAT SUCH THINGS HAPPEN.  HE 
RECALLED A 1987 PRISON BREAK BY FOUR ISLAMIC JIHAD TERRORISTS WHO 
ESCAPED FROM AN ISRAELI PRISON INSIDE GAZA.  \"THEY JUMPED OVER 
TWO FENCES AFTER GETTING OUT OF THE PRISON!  IT HAPPENS.\" 
 
4.  (C)  ACCORDING TO HARARI, THE GOI REMAINS SUSPICIOUS BECAUSE 
ARAFAT IS AT SUCH A DELICATE POINT IN HIS NEGOTIATIONS.  THE 
CLOSURE ON GAZA WILL CONTINUE TO BE TIGHT BECAUSE ARAFAT HAS NOT 
REACHED FINAL AGREEMENT WITH HAMAS.  \"THEY HAVE NOT DECIDED TO 
END ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELIS.\"  ARAFAT IS MAINTAINING AN 
\"EXTREMELY COMPLEX BALANCING ACT\" AND THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
HIM TO MISCALCULATE.  ON THE ONE HAND HE HAS THE GOI, THE USG AND 
PALESTINIAN PUBLIC OPINION WHICH NO LONGER SUPPORTS THE SUICIDE 
ATTACKS, AND ON THE OTHER THE STRATEGIC NEGOTIATIONS WITH HAMAS. 
FOR THESE NEGOTIATIONS HE MUST LOOSEN AS WELL AS TIGHTEN THE 
NOOSE AROUND HAMAS.  A MISTAKE ON THE STRENGTH OF THE NOOSE COULD 
LET AN ATTACK SLIP THROUGH. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C)  HARARI WAS SURPRISINGLY CHARITABLE IN DESCRIBING ARAFAT\'S 
NEED TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN TOUGHNESS AND FLEXIBILITY IN HIS 
DEALINGS WITH HAMAS.  THE DOMINANT AND AUTHORITATIVE ISRAELI 
POSITION AT THIS TIME, VOICED BY RABIN AND OTHERS IN THE POLICY 
LOOP, IS THAT ARAFAT\'S SECURITY EFFORTS HAVE SLACKENED IN RECENT 
WEEKS AND THAT HE MUST DO BETTER IF HE WANTS THE CLOSURE LIFTED.

SUBJECT:  RABIN ASSASSINATION: SITREP NO. 1 
          0800 GMT NOVEMBER 5 
 
1.  PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN TEL AVIV 
YESTERDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 4, AS HE LEFT A LARGE DOWNTOWN PEACE 
RALLY.  HE WAS ATTACKED BY A LONE GUNMAN, AN ISRAELI STUDENT, 
ALTHOUGH A GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE \"JEWISH VENGEANCE 
ORGANIZATION\" HAS CLAIMED CREDIT. 
 
2.  THE PRIME MINISTER HAD JUST FINISHED ADDRESSING A RALLY OF 
OVER 100,000, ORGANIZED BY THE \"PEACE NOW\" MOVEMENT TO SUPPORT 
THE GOVERNMENT IN THE PEACE PROCESS.  AT 2150L (1950 GMT), AS 
RABIN APPROACHED A WAITING LIMOUSINE, YIGAL AMIR, A 25-YEAR-OLD 
LAW STUDENT, RAN FORWARD AND FIRED AT LEAST THREE TIMES AT POINT- 
BLANK RANGE.  THE PRIME MINISTER WAS STRUCK IN THE BACK, ABDOMEN, 
AND CHEST, AND A SECURITY GUARD ALSO WAS WOUNDED.  RABIN WAS 
TAKEN IMMEDIATELY BY HIS BODYGUARDS TO NEARBY ICHILOV HOSPITAL. 
HE ARRIVED THERE UNCONSCIOUS, WITHOUT A PULSE OR BLOOD PRESSURE. 
THE HOSPITAL TRAUMA UNIT ATTEMPTED IN VAIN TO REVIVE HIM, AND HE 
WAS DECLARED DEAD AT 2315L (2115 GMT).  THE GUNMAN WAS SUBDUED ON 
THE SPOT.  ACCORDING TO LATEST POLICE REPORTS TO THE PRESS, AMIR 
CLAIMS HE WAS TOLD BY GOD TO KILL THE PRIME MINISTER, AND IN 
RECENT WEEKS HAD FAILED IN TWO PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO GET CLOSE 
ENOUGH TO RABIN TO DO SO.  HE HAS ALSO REPORTEDLY REFUSED TO 
EXPRESS ANY REMORSE FOR HIS ACT.  WHILE A HITHERTO-UNKNOWN GROUP 
CALLING ITSELF THE \"JEWISH VENGEANCE ORGANIZATION\" (HEBREW 
ACRONYM \"AYIN\") CALLED A LOCAL RADIO STATION TO CLAIM THE CREDIT, 
THE KILLER REPORTEDLY HAS SAID HE ACTED ALONE. 
 
3.  THE ISRAELI CABINET MET IN EMERGENCY SESSION AT ABOUT 1230L 
NOVEMBER 5.  FOREIGN MINISTER SHIMON PERES WAS NAMED ACTING PRIME 
MINISTER.  (SEPTEL REPORTS ON CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR 
TRANSFER OF POWER.)  APPEARING BEFORE THE PRESS SHORTLY 
THEREAFTER, AN EMOTIONAL BUT CAREFULLY CONTAINED PERES SPOKE 
MOVINGLY OF RABIN\'S SERVICE TO HIS COUNTRY, AND OF HIS OWN 
DECADES-LONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRIME MINISTER.  PERES 
REAFFIRMED ISRAEL\'S COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WITH THE PEACE 
PROCESS:  \"YOU CAN KILL A PERSON.  YOU CAN BRING AN END TO LIFE. 
BUT YOU CANNOT KILL AN IDEA.\" 
 
4.  PERES DECLARED A STATE OF NATIONAL MOURNING.  THE BORDERS TO 
GAZA AND THE WEST BANK HAVE BEEN CLOSED TO ALL BUT EMERGENCY 
CASES, AND THE TRUCKING OF PRODUCE, INDEFINITELY.  JERUSALEM 
RADIO ALSO REPORTS THAT TALKS ON REDEPLOYMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION 
OF REDEPLOYMENT STEPS IN THE WEST BANK HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED, AT 
LEAST FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW. 
 
5.  RABIN\'S BODY WILL BE TAKEN TO JERUSALEM AT 1300L TODAY, WHERE 
IT WILL LIE IN STATE ON THE KNESSET PLAZA, TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC 
TO PAY ITS LAST RESPECTS.  THE FUNERAL WILL BE MONDAY AT 
1400L.  (THE RABBINATE HAS GRANTED AN EXCEPTION TO THE JEWISH 
STRICTURE REQUIRING BURIAL WITHIN 24 HOURS OF DEATH, IN ORDER TO 
ALLOW FOREIGN LEADERS TO ARRIVE FOR THE FUNERAL.) 
 
6.  THE ISRAELI PRESS HAS FEATURED PROMINENTLY PRESIDENT 
CLINTON\'S ROSE GARDEN STATEMENT OF SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT, AND IS 
REPORTING HIS INTENTION TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL.  ACCORDING TO THE 
LATEST MEDIA REPORTS, THE FUNERAL ALSO WILL BE ATTENDED BY THE 
HEADS OF STATE OF EGYPT, JORDAN, ITALY, AND PORTUGAL, THE HEADS 
OF GOVERNMENT OF THE UK, GERMANY, CANADA, KOREA, MALTA, AND UNSYG 
BOUTROS. 
 
7.  JERUSALEM RADIO REPORTS THAT THE CHIEF OF THE GENERAL 
SECURITY SERVICE, OR SHIN BET, IS RETURNING FROM OVERSEAS, AS A 
GSS INQUIRY CONTINUES ON HOW THE GUNMAN WAS ABLE TO PENETRATE 
RABIN\'S SECURITY. 
 
8.  SEPTEL WILL ASSESS THE LOCAL REACTION TO THE MURDER.  SITREPS 
WILL CONTINUE AS REQUIRED.

          SUCCESSION 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  CLASSIFIED BY SECTION 1.5 (B) 
AND (D).  NIACT PRECEDENCE BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT CRISIS IN 
ISRAEL. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  ACTING PRIME MINISTER SHIMON PERES WILL NEED TO 
CONSIDER THREE POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 5 FUNERAL 
FOR ASSASSINATED PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN.  PERES COULD ASK 
PRESIDENT WEIZMAN TO RECOGNIZE THE EXISTING RULING COALITION; 
FORM A NEW RULING COALITION; OR DISSOLVE THE KNESSET AND CALL 
EARLY ELECTIONS.  NEW ELECTIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE 90 DAYS AFTER 
THE 13TH KNESSET IS DISSOLVED.  POLITICAL AND PEACE PROCESS 
FACTORS WILL OBVIOUSLY INFLUENCE ANY DECISION CONCERNING IF AND 
WHEN NEW ELECTIONS ARE HELD.  OPPOSITION LEADER BINYAMIN 
NETANYAHU TOLD US LAST NIGHT THAT LIKUD AND THE RIGHT WILL BE 
DIRECTLY BLAMED FOR THE VIOLENCE LEADING TO THE ASSASSINATION OF 
RABIN.  HE CALLED THE DEATH OF RABIN \"A DISASTER FOR THE JEWISH 
PEOPLE, A DISASTER FOR ISRAEL AND A DISASTER FOR THE RIGHT WHICH 
WILL BE DECIMATED IF ELECTIONS ARE CALLED SOON.\" 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THE NOVEMBER 4 ASSASSINATION OF PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN 
HAS NO PRECEDENT IN ISRAEL\'S FORTY-SEVEN YEAR HISTORY.  LACKING A 
CONSTITUTION, ISRAEL\'S BASIC LAW PROVIDES THAT A TEMPORARY ACTING 
PRIME MINISTER BE NAMED BY THE ISRAELI CABINET.  IN EMERGENCY 
SESSION LAST NIGHT, THE CABINET NAMED FOREIGN MINISTER SHIMON 
PERES ACTING PRIME MINISTER, A DECISION TAKEN WITH THE 
CONCURRENCE OF PRESIDENT EZER WEIZMAN. 
 
4. FOLLOWING A SEVEN-DAY MOURNING PERIOD (WHICH WILL RUN FROM THE 
DAY OF BURIAL NOVEMBER 6 TO SUNDAY MORNING NOVEMBER 12), THE 
ACTING PRIME MINISTER HAS THREE BASIC OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO 
SUCCESSION: 1) CONTINUE WITH THE EXISTING RULING COALITION WITH 
THE APPROVAL OF THE PRESIDENT, 2) FORM A NEW COALITION WITH THE 
APPROVAL OF THE PRESIDENT, OR 3) CALL FOR NEW ELECTIONS. 
 
5.  WE EXPECT ACTING PRIME MINISTER PERES TO CONSIDER HIS OPTIONS 
AFTER THE NOVEMBER 6 FUNERAL FOR RABIN.  WE HAVE HEARD 
PRELIMINARY REACTIONS FROM CABINET MEMBERS AND LABOR PARTY 
LEADERS THAT PERES MAY WANT TO CALL FOR EARLY ELECTIONS.  ALREADY 
THE LABOR PARTY HAS NAMED NAVA ARAD, A MEMBER OF THE 12TH KNESSET 
AND AN ADVISOR TO THE PRIME MINISTER ON WOMEN\'S RIGHTS, TO 
REPLACE RABIN\'S POSITION ON THE LABOR LIST AND RETAIN A PLURALITY 
OF 44 SEATS IN THE KNESSET AND A WORKING MAJORITY OF 63.  WE HAVE 
LEARNED FROM THE PRIME MINISTER\'S MILITARY ADVISOR, GENERAL DANNY 
YATOM, THAT THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER WILL TAKE OVER THE DEFENSE 
PORTFOLIO, SINCE PERES IS BARRED FROM NAMING NEW MINISTERS UNTIL 
HE BECOMES PRIME MINISTER.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN THE NEAR 
FUTURE EHUD BARAK, INTERIOR MINISTER AND FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF, 
COULD BE NAMED DEFENSE MINISTER, A MOVE THAT MOST OF THE ISRAELI 
PRESS HAS DISCUSSED IN TODAY\'S PAPERS.  BARAK IS CURRENTLY RACING 
BACK TO ISRAEL FROM A U.S. VISIT TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF RABIN 
TOMORROW. 
 
6.  IF PERES DECIDES TO CALL FOR NEW ELECTIONS, HE WOULD HAVE TO 
DISSOLVE THE CURRENT 13TH SESSION OF THE KNESSET AND BEGIN A 90- 
DAY ELECTION PERIOD DURING WHICH A CAMPAIGN WOULD BE CONDUCTED. 
THE NEW ELECTION LAW PERMITTING THE DIRECT ELECTION OF THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND SEPARATE ELECTION OF KNESSET FACTIONS WILL TAKE 
EFFECT.  SEVERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES STILL REMAIN UNRESOLVED AND 
WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE AN ELECTION COULD BE HELD.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, THE ISSUE OF A NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED, 
SINCE LABOR AND LIKUD HAVE ALREADY AGREED THAT A SIMPLE KNESSET 
MAJORITY WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO REMOVE A DIRECTLY-ELECTED PRIME 
MINISTER. 
 
7.  POLITICAL AND PEACE PROCESS FACTORS NO DOUBT WILL GREATLY 
INFLUENCE A DECISION BY ACTING PRIME MINISTER PERES ON WHETHER 
AND WHEN TO CALL FOR NEW ELECTIONS.  SINCE OSLO II IS A 
COMMITMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL, LABOR AND LIKUD SOURCES 
TOLD US THAT REDEPLOYMENT WOULD CONTINUE DURING AN ELECTION 
PERIOD.  LIKUD LEADER BINYAMIN NETANYAHU TOLD POLOFF LAST NIGHT 
THAT THE ASSASSINATION OF RABIN IS A \"DISASTER FOR THE JEWISH 
PEOPLE, A DISASTER OF ISRAEL AND A DISASTER FOR THE RIGHT WHICH 
WILL BE DECIMATED IF ELECTIONS ARE CALLED SOON.\"  OTHER LIKUD 
SOURCES REFERRED IN A PANIC TO THE 1930\'S MURDER OF HAIM 
ARLOSOROFF FOR WHICH THE ENTIRE REVISIONIST MOVEMENT WAS BLAMED 
AND FEARED THE LEFT WILL DO THE SAME AGAIN WITH LIKUD AND THE 
RIGHT IN 1995.

SUBJECT:  A BLACK DAY FOR THE JEWISH NATION 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  CLASSIFIED BY RICHARD ERDMAN, 
POL/C, PER SECTIONS 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
2. NEWS OF RABIN\'S ASSASSINATION HAS LEFT ISRAELIS DAZED, 
STUNNED, ANXIOUS, AND IN SHOCK.  THE FULL IMPACT HAS YET TO SINK 
IN, OF COURSE.  BUT GIVEN RABIN\'S CENTRAL ROLE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY 
PHASE OF ISRAEL\'S POLITICAL LIFE SINCE ITS CREATION, THE 
PYSCHOLOGICAL, HISTORICAL, AND NATIONAL IMPACT IS BEING COMPARED 
TO THAT FOLLOWING PRESIDENT KENNEDY\'S ASSASSINATION.  AS ONE 
CONTACT PUT IT, THE OVERWHELMING SENSE OF SADNESS GOES FAR BEYOND 
RABIN THE MAN; IT GOES TO THE HEART OF WHAT ISRAEL IS ALL ABOUT. 
THERE IS THE SENSE THAT ISRAEL HAS LOST WHATEVER WAS LEFT OF ITS 
ORGINAL INNOCENCE, ITS YOUTH, ITS SENSE OF INTIMACY AND 
CONNECTEDNESS IN A SHARED FATE.  IN A WORD,  ALL THE THINGS THAT 
HAVE MADE ISRAEL UNIQUE IN THE EYES OF ITS PEOPLE. 
 
3.  THAT RABIN WAS GUNNED DOWN BY A LONE ASSASSIN AS HE LEFT 
PERHAPS THE LARGEST PEACE RALLY IN TEL AVIV HISTORY HAS MADE THE 
SITUATION ALL THE MORE POIGNANT.  SOME 120,000-150,000 ISRAELIS-- 
JOINED BY GOVERNMENT MINISTERS, KNESSET MEMBERS, AND AMBASSADORS 
FROM EGYPT, JORDAN AND MOROCCO--HAD GATHERED IN THE CITY CENTER 
TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR PEACE AND FOR RABIN\'S EFFORTS TO 
ACHIEVE IT.  THE GUNSHOTS THAT FELLED HIM AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
HIS DEATH ABOUT AN HOUR LATER TURNED A MASSIVE, JOYOUS EVENT INTO 
A NATIONAL NIGHTMARE. 
 
4.  THE ASSASSINATION, THE FIRST EVER IN THE FORTY-SEVEN YEAR 
HISTORY OF ISRAEL, IS BEING SEEN ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM AS 
AN ASSAULT ON ISRAELI DEMOCRACY AND AS A STERN REMINDER THAT 
FRATERNAL VIOLENCE MUST BE CHECKED, LEST IT SPLINTER THE NATION 
AS IT HAS IN THE PAST.  ILLUSTRATIVELY, THE JERUSALEM POST, NO 
FRIEND OF RABIN OR OSLO II, EDITORIALIZED THIS MORNING THAT 
\"NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, IS A GREATER BLOW TO THE LIFE OF 
THE JEWISH NATION THAN FRATERNAL VIOLENCE, AND NOTHING MAKES SUCH 
VIOLENCE MORE THREATENING TO THE NATION\'S FUTURE THAN THE 
ASSASSINATION OF THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT.\"  ISRAEL\'S FATE, THE 
COMMENTARY CONTINUES, DEPENDS ON ISRAELIS UNITING, DESPITE THEIR 
POLITICAL DIFFERENCES, TO UTTERLY REJECT VIOLENCE BETWEEN JEWS. 
 
5.  A KEY POLLSTER WHO HAS DONE EXTENSIVE PRIVATE POLLING FOR 
RABIN OVER THE YEARS DESCRIBED THE ASSASSINATION TO US AS THE 
\"PEAK OF THE POLARIZATION OF ISRAELI SOCIETY IN THE LAST DECADE.\" 
NO ONE EXPECTED IT TO GO THIS FAR, BUT THERE IS A CLEAR SENSE 
THAT A LINE HAS BEEN CROSSED, THAT THE PEACE PROCESS MUST NOT 
STOP, AND THAT VIOLENCE AT ANY LEVEL CANNOT AND MUST NOT BE 
ACCEPTED. 
 
6.  ACCORDING TO BOTH THIS AND OTHER CONTACTS, RABIN\'S 
ASSASSINATION WILL WAKE UP THE MODERATE RIGHT, WHICH SUPPORTS THE 
PEACE PROCESS BUT HAS DOUBTS ABOUT OSLO II.  AT THE SAME TIME, 
PRESSURES WILL GROW TO JOIN RANKS AT A TIME OF NATIONAL CRISIS. 
TOLERANCE FOR THE KIND OF UNCIVIL AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR AND 
RHETORIC THAT HAVE MARKED THE PAST FEW MONTHS WILL BE SHARPLY 
REDUCED.  THE RIGHT, FACED WITH AN UPWELLING OF PUBLIC SUPPORT 
FOR UNITY IN TIME OF NATIONAL CRISIS, WILL BE FORCED TO MODERATE 
ITS OPPOSITION.  AND THE SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES, 
HAVING LOOKED DOWN THE ABYSS OF FRATRICIDAL JEWISH STRIFE, WILL 
BE UNDER INCREASED PRESSURE TO FIND A WAY TO LIVE TOGETHER WITH 
GREATER MUTUAL TOLERATION AND RESPECT, DESPITE THEIR ENORMOUS 
DIFFERENCES. 
 
7.  IN THIS ANALYSIS--WHICH WE THINK IS CLOSE TO THE MARK--THE 
MODERATE RIGHT WILL BE CRITICAL TO EFFORTS TO STEM POLARIZATION 
OVER THE PEACE PROCESS AND TO BRIDGE THE GAPS BETWEEN THE LEFT 
AND RIGHT.  IF THESE MODERATES DECIDE THAT THEIR SIDE--THE RIGHT- 
-HAS HELPED BRING ON A NATIONAL CRISIS BY TAKING ITS OPPOSITION 
TOO FAR, THERE COULD BE A BACKLASH.  THE SETTLERS COUNCIL\'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT IT WILL CEASE ITS ACTIVE RESISTANCE TO 
THE GOVERNMENT CENSUS MAY BE AN EARLY SIGN OF THE KIND OF 
MODERATING PRESSURES THAT WILL BE AT WORK.  OPPOSITION LEADER 
NETANYAHU\'S SUPPORT THIS MORNING IN THE KNESSET FOR LABOR TO FORM 
THE NEXT GOVERNMENT, AND HIS PRIVATELY EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE 
PUBLIC WILL HOLD LIKUD RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTRIBUTING TO AN 
ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH SUCH A TRAGIC EVENT COULD TAKE PLACE, MAY BE 
A FURTHER INDICATION.  WHATEVER THE CASE, MOST PEOPLE WE HAVE 
SPOKEN WITH ARE CONVINCED THAT LABOR WILL BENEFIT FROM AN 
OUTPOURING OF SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC\'S 
PREFERENCE TO GO WITH THE DEVIL THEY KNOW. 
 
8. WITH THE NATION IN SHOCK AND MOURNING, ISRAELIS ARE NOT YET 
FOCUSSING MUCH ON LONGER TERM POLITICAL SUCCESSION ISSUES.  FOR 
THOSE WHO ARE, A KEY QUESTION IS WHO CAN BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN 
LEFT AND RIGHT.  FOR ALL THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING HIS PEACE 
POLICIES AND OUTSPOKENESS, RABIN TO SOME EXTENT BRIDGED THAT 
LEFT-RIGHT DIVIDE AND WAS NEVER SEEN AS A MAN ONLY OF THE LEFT. 
PERES, DESPITE HIS IMPROVING PUBLIC IMAGE IN RECENT MONTHS, BY 
CONTRAST IS WIDELY IDENTIFIED AS A MAN OF THE LEFT AND DISTRUSTED 
BY MANY ON THE RIGHT.  BOTH IN HIS TRANSITION ROLE AND AS PRIME 
MINISTER, SHOULD HE BE ASKED TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT, A KEY 
QUESTION WILL BE WHETHER PERES CAN BOTH CARRY THE LABOR BLOC AS 
WELL AS BRING ALONG THE CRUCIAL CENTER AND CENTER-RIGHT. IN THIS 
REGARD, THERE IS SPECULATION THAT POPULAR LABOR FEDERATION LEADER 
AND KNESSET MEMBER HAIM RAMON, WHO HAS A MORE CENTRIST POLITICAL 
IMAGE, WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN ATTRACTING THE MODERATE RIGHT, 
BROADENING THE GOVERNMENT\'S BASE, AND MODERATING THE LEFT-RIGHT 
DIVIDE.

PA\'S INTEREST THAT THERE BE QUIET AND STABILITY IN 
THE PROCESS AND THAT THE TEST OF THE PA\'S BECOMING A 
POLITICAL FRAMEWORK LIES IN ITS ABILITY TO IMPOSE LAW 
AND ORDER.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER 
THE PA COOPERATED IN THE KILLING, SHAHAL SAID: 
\"...THE PALESTINIANS...SHARE AN INTEREST IN 
ELIMINATING TERROR....  IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT 
SECURITY ELEMENTS SHOULD COOPERATE AND EXCHANGE 
INFORMATION.\" 
 
3.  (U)  ARAB MK\'S CONDEMNED THE ASSASSINATION. 
SHAYKH ABDULLAH NIMR DARWISH, HEAD OF THE ISLAMIC 
MOVEMENT IN ISRAEL, CALLED THE KILLING A BLATANT 
VIOLATION OF THE PEACE ACCORDS, WHILE HADASH MK 
HASHEM MOHAMMAD CRITICIZED THE OPERATION SAYING \"HE 
IS IN PRINCIPLE AGAINST ASSASSINATIONS NO MATTER WHAT 
THE VIEWS OF THE PERSON KILLED.  WE NEED TO CONSIDER 
WHERE IT WILL LEAD US.\" 
 
PA REACTION 
----------- 
 
4.  (U)   ARAFAT SPOKESMAN NABIL ABU RUDEINA STRONGLY 
CONDEMNED THE KILLING.  THE ISRAELI PRESS QUOTES A 
SENIOR PA OFFICIAL AS SAYING THE ASSASSINATION 
EMBARRASSED ARAFAT AND THAT THE PA WAS CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS, AND THE 
PROSPECTS OF HAMAS RETALIATING. 
 
5.  (U)   MAJOR GENERAL ABDUL RAZZAQ AL MUJAYIDAH, 
FROM THE PA NATIONAL SECURITY FORCES, SAID THE PA 
STARTED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ASSASSINATION.  AS 
OF JANUARY 7, FIVE GAZANS HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE KILLING.  ACCORDING TO AN 
OFFICIAL IN PA POLICE COMMANDER NASIR YUSIF\'S OFFICE, 
SECURITY FORCES ARE ON HIGHER ALERT. 
 
HAMAS REACTION 
-------------- 
 
6.  (U)  IN ADDITION TO CALLING FOR REVENGE, HAMAS 
HAS ACCUSED THE PA OF COLLUDING WITH THE GOI IN THE 
ASSASSINATION.  HAMAS SPOKESMAN MAHMOUD ZAHAR HAS 
DENIED THAT OSAMA HAMMAD, \"A SON OF HAMAS\", (REPORTED 
TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE ASSASSINATION) WAS A 
SUSPECT IN CONNECTION WITH THE KILLING, OR THAT 
HAMMAD HAD FLED GAZA. 
 
ON THE GROUND 
------------- 
 
7.  (U)  IN THE AFTERMATH OF HAMAS\' CALL FOR REVENGE 
AGAINST ISRAEL FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF YAHIYA AYYASH 
(THE ENGINEER), THE GOI HAS DECLARED ALL AREAS 
TRANSFERRED TO PALESTINIAN CONTROL CLOSED MILITARY 
AREAS INDEFINITELY.  ISRAEL T.V. REPORTED JANUARY 6 
THAT THE CLOSURE WAS EXPECTED TO LAST UNTIL JANUARY 
10 AT LEAST. 
 
8.  (C)  ACCORDING TO MATAK (THE OLD CIVAD), GAZANS 
CAN COME INTO GAZA, ISRAELIS CAN LEAVE GAZA, AND 
THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS CAN MOVE BACK AND FORTH. 
EMBOFF SAW THESE MOVEMENTS IN ADDITION TO: 
 
--  VIP\'S WITH MAGNETIC CARDS CAN GET IN AND OUT OF 
GAZA.  VIPS WITH PAPER PASSES, WAITING FOR THE 
PERMANENT MAGNETIC CARDS CANNOT. 
 
--  GOING TO THE RIDICULOUS,  THERE ARE FIFTY GAZAN 
TRUCKS WHICH, HAVING BEEN INSPECTED AND CLEARED BY 
THE ISRAELIS, REMAIN ON THE ISRAELI SIDE OF THE 
BORDER.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE DRIVERS OF THE TRUCKS 
CANNOT GET TO THEM BECAUSE THE DRIVERS DO NOT HAVE 
MAGNETIC CARDS.  ALTHOUGH SOME DRIVERS HAVE OFFERED 
TO SUBMIT TO A STRIP-SEARCH SO THAT THEY CAN GET TO 
WORK, THE IDF HAS REMAINED ADAMANT THAT THEY CANNOT 
LEAVE GAZA. 
 
--  THESE \"STERILE\" TRUCKS WERE PART OF A GOI 
INITIATIVE, IMPLEMENTED UNDER U.S. ENCOURAGEMENT, TO 
REDUCE THE IMPACT OF CLOSURE ON GAZA\'S ECONOMY.  THE 
TRUCKS, ONCE CLEARED BY THE ISRAELI SECURITY, WERE TO 
BE FREE TO TRAVEL BETWEEN GAZAN-ISRAELI DESTINATIONS 
WITHOUT RE-ENTERING GAZA. 
 
--  TRUCK CONVOYS FROM GAZA TO ISRAEL CONTINUED 
WITHOUT INTERRUPTION IN SPITE OF THE CLOSURE.  QARNI 
BACK-TO-BACK TRADE ALSO CONTINUED. 
 
9.  (C)  CAMPAIGNING FOR THE JANUARY ELECTIONS WAS 
SUSPENDED FOR TWO DAYS, BUT RESUMED IN A \"LOW 
PROFILE\" WAY ACCORDING TO THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE 
CENTRAL ELECTION COMMISSION IN GAZA.  HE ECHOED OTHER 
PALESTINIAN INTERLOCUTORS WHO CALLED THE TIMING OF 
THE ASSASSINATION \"ATROCIOUS\" FOR ELECTIONS.  HE DID 
NOT HOWEVER, BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE A LONG-TERM 
ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE ELECTIONS--OTHER THAN TO 
INCREASE THE SYMPATHY VOTE FOR HAMAS AFFILIATED 
CANDIDATES. 
 
10. (C)  IN SPITE OF A THREE-DAY NATIONAL MOURNING 
PERIOD CALLED BY HAMAS, BUSINESSES IN GAZA REMAINED 
OPENED.  THE PA ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT \"ONLY THE 
PA COULD CALL FOR A NATIONAL STRIKE\" AND AS 
PALESTINIANS ARE NO LONGER WAGING THE INTIFADA, SUCH 
A RESPONSE WOULD BE \"INAPPROPRIATE.\" 
 
11.  (C)  HAMAS HAS COME UNDER CRITICISM FOR 
PROVIDING LAX SECURITY FOR AYYASH.  ABU ALI SHAHEEN, 
A LEADER OF THE SHABEBA (INTIFADA YOUTH) MOVEMENT 
(PROTECT) TOLD US THAT GAZANS WERE CRITICIZING HAMAS 
FOR NOT PROTECTING AYYASH WELL ENOUGH.  HE ADDED THAT 
SOME WERE EVEN SPECULATING THAT SOME HAMAS MEMBERS 
COLLUDED IN HIS KILLING BECAUSE AYYASH REMAINED A 
STAUNCH OPPONENT TO THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12.  (C)  BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH PALESTINIAN 
ELECTION WATCHERS IN GAZA, WE BELIEVE THAT THE 
ASSASSINATION WILL NOT HAVE LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON THE 
UPCOMING ELECTIONS,  THE TIMING OF HAMAS\' RESPONSE, 
HOWEVER, MAY WELL HAVE.

SUBJECT: HAMAS CONSIDERS A NEW MODUS VIVENDI WITH PA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY POL/C, JOHN SCOTT, REASONS 1.5 (B/D) 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT: 
-------------------- 
 
1.  (C) IN THE AFTERMATH OF WIDE-SCALE ARRESTS OF HAMAS 
ACTIVISTS FOLLOWING THE OCTOBER 29 GUSH KATIF SUICIDE 
BOMBINGS, SOME OF OUR GAZA CONTACTS ARE STATING THAT 
HAMAS IS PREPARING TO ENTER INTO A LIMITED \"TRUCE\" WITH 
THE PALESTINIAN.AUTHORITY (PA).  THE TRUCE WOULD APPLY 
ONLY TO ATTACKS LAUNCHED FROM OR ON PA TERRITORY BUT 
WOULD SUPPOSEDLY ALSO BIND HAMAS LEADERSHIP TO 
\"PERSUADING\" HAMAS FUGITIVES TO TURN THEMSELVES IN UNDER 
GUARANTEES OF SAFETY.  OTHER CONTACTS POINT OUT THAT 
HAMAS HAS ENTERED INTO SUCH AGREEMENTS IN THE PAST AND 
DISCOUNT THE EITHER THE POSSIBILITY OR THE EFFICIACY OF 
A NEW AGREEMENT.  THEY ARGUE THAT EVEN IF THE LOCAL 
HAMAS LEADERSHIP IS INTERESTED IN REACHING A NEW MODUS 
VIVENDI WITH THE PA, THE OUTSIDE LEADERSHIP REMAINS 
INTENT ON KEEPING HAMAS\' RADICAL EDGE.  THE OUTSIDE 
LEADERSHIP, THEY CLAIM RETAINS THE ABILITY TO ORDER 
TERRORIST OPERATIONS INSIDE OF ISRAEL AND THE PA- 
CONTROLLED AREAS PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS CONTROL OF 
SIGNIFICANT HAMAS FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  SIMILARLY, OUR 
CONTACTS APPEAR TO BE DIVIDED OVER THE LONG-TERM AFFECTS 
OF THE RECENT ARRESTS.  SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT THE 
ARRESTS, WHICH MAY NUMBERED IN THE HUNDREDS, FAILED TO 
INCLUDE MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED \"MILITARY NING\" AND HAD 
A NEGLIBLE IMPACT OF HAMAS OPERATIONS.  OTHERS CLAIM 
THAT HAMAS IS NOW IN A STATE OF INTERNAL CRISIS ARISING 
FROM A LACK OF COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TWO WINGS 
BECAUSE OF PA AND GOI PRESSURE, INCLUDING THE MOST 
RECENT ARRESTS, AND ARGUE THAT AS A RESULT OF THE 
PRESSURE, HAMAS WILL HAVE LITTLE OPTION BUT TO RESPOND 
\"MILITARILY.\" 
 
2.  (C) PUBLIC REACTION TO THE ARRESTS AND TO CONTINUED 
PA SECURITY FORCE ACTIVITIES AIMED AT HAMAS IS GENERALLY 
NEGATIVE.  PUBLIC ANGER APPEARS TO BE LESS A RESULT OF 
ACTUAL SUPPORT FOR HAMAS THEN OF RESENTMENT AT ARAFAT\'S 
PERCEIVED WILLINGNESS TO ATTACK HAMAS IN ORDER TO PLEASE 
THE U.S. AND ISRAEL.  BUT HAMAS\' ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE 
ON THE RESENTMENT APPEARS FOR NOW TO BE LIMITED BY THEIR 
OWN FAILURE TO IDENTIFY A CLEAR AND VIABLE ALTERNATIVE 
TO ARAFAT\'S PRESENT COURSE.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
3.  (C) ACCORDING TO PALESTINIAN MEDIA AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
GROUPS, PA SECURITY FORCES ARE CONTINUING TO SUMMON 
SUSPECTED ISLAMIST ACTIVISTS AND TO SEARCH THEIR HOMES. 
BUT POLICE ACTIVITIES APPEAR TO BE LOSING THEIR 
INTENSITY AND A NUMBER OF LOWER LEVEL ACTIVISTS HAVE NOW 
ALSO BEEN RELEASED.  THEIR NUMBERS ARE IN ADDITION TO 
THE RELEASE LAST WEEK OF ANOTHER FIVE PROMINENT HAMAS 
AND ISLAMIC JIHAD LEADERS.  ACCORDING TO HUMAN RIGHTS 
GROUPS, AT LEAST 160, AND PROBABLY AS MANY AS 200, 
SUSPECTED HAMAS ACTIVISTS REMAIN IMPRISONED.  ACCORDING 
TO IMAD FALOUJI, THE ISLAMIST MINISTER OF 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, THE RELEASES WILL CONTINUE. 
 
A DEAL IS STRUCK? 
----------------- 
 
4.  (C) ACCORDING TO FALOUJI, THE PA IS ALSO CONSIDERING 
LIFTING THE HOUSE ARREST IMPOSED UPON HAMAS SPIRITUAL 
LEADER SHEIKH AHMED YASIN IMPOSED AFTER THE GUSH KATIF 
BOMBING LAST OCTOBER.  ENDING HIS STATE OF ARREST AS 
WELL AS CONTINUED RELEASE OF PRISONERS WOULD BE THE 
RESULT, ACCORDING TO FALOUJI, OF AN AGREEMENT REACHED 
BETWEEN PA AND HAMAS FOCUSSED ON FOUR ISSUES: (1) HAMAS 
WILLINGNESS TO END ATTACKS FROM OR ON PA TERRITORY, (2) 
HAMAS \"HELP\" IN \"PERSUADING\" FUGITIVES, INCLUDING 
NOTORIOUS TERRORIST MOHAMMED DEIF, TO TURN THEMSELVES 
INTO THE PA UNDER A PROMISE OF \"FAIR\" TREATMENT 
(COMMENT: WE DOUBT DEIF WILL BE IMPRESSED BY THIS 
OFFER), (3) AN END TO ANTI-PA INCITEMENT, AND (4) A PA 
PROMISE THAT HAMAS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ITS 
\"POLITICAL\" (VICE \"MILITARY\") WORK.  TALK OF A 
\"CEASEFIRE\" HAS ALSO AROUSED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN 
ISRAEL, ESPECIALLY CLAIMS BY ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES 
CHIEF OF STAFF MOFAZ THAT SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE 
\"POSITIVE AND RIGHT.\"  FALOUJI QUOTED PA CABINET 
SECRETARY TAYYIB ABDUL RAHIM, WHO HANDLES RELATIONS WITH 
HAMAS FOR ARAFAT, AS SAYING THAT HAMAS HAD AGREED TO 
THESE CONDITIONS IN A MEETING HELD EARLIER THIS WEEK. 
 
5.  (C) BUT OTHERS ARE NOT SO SURE.  AN AMERICAN 
REPORTER WHO RECENTLY INTERVIEWED HAMAS ACTIVIST ISMAEL 
ABU SHANAB TOLD POLOFF THAT ABU SHANAB HAD DISCUSSED 
WITH HIM HAMAS\' ABILITY TO \"TERRORIZE\" ISRAEL WITH A 
HANDFUL OF ACTIVISTS.  ABU SHANAB, RELEASED FROM PRISON 
SHORTLY AFTER HIS ARREST, EXPRESSED NO REMORSE ABOUT THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF THE GUSH KATIF BOMBINGS ON HAMAS-PA 
RELATIONS.  SIMILARLY, GAZA REUTERS BUREAU CHIEF NIDAL 
AL-MOGHRABI TOLD POLOFF ON NOVEMBER 18 THAT HAMAS 
ACTIVISTS HAD REPORTED NO PROGRESS FROM THE SAME MEETING 
BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND TAYYIB ABDUL RAHIM THAT FALOUJI 
CLAIMED PRODUCED AN AGREEMENT. AL-MOGHRABI NOTED THAT 
HAMAS HAD REACHED SIMILAR AGREEMENTS WITH THE PA IN THE 
PAST, ONLY TO BREACH THEM WHEN AN ATTACK SUITED THEIR 
INTERESTS. 
 
WHOM DID THEY ARREST AND WHAT WAS THE IMPACT? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) CONTROVERSY CONTINUES LIKEWISE ON THE QUESTION 
OF WHOM THE PA MANAGED TO ARREST AND WHAT THE IMPACT OF 
THE ARRESTS WAS ON HAMAS\' ABILITY TO OPERATE.  A SENIOR 
SECURITY ANALYST FOR TITULAR PA SECURITY HEAD MG NASSIR 
YUSUF ADMITTED TO POLOFF THAT THE ARRESTS, WHILE BROAD, 
HAD NETTED NO ONE FROM THE MILITARY WING.  SIMILAR VIEWS 
WERE OFFERED BY NASSIR YUSUF HIMSELF, BY FALOUJI, BY 
FATAH CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER HANI AL-HASSAN, AND BY 
THE EDITOR OF THE ISLAMIST WEEKLY, \"AL-RESALLAH,\" GHAZI 
HAMAD.  AL-HASSAN REPORTED THAT THE DEATHS OF IMAD 
AWADALLAH AND OTHERS FROM THE MILITARY WING HAD INDEED 
DISRUPTED \"POLITICAL\" CONTROL OVER THE UNDERGROUND CELLS 
FOR A FEW WEEKS, BUT HE BELIEVED THAT SUCH CONTROL HAD 
NOW BEEN REESTABLISHED. 
 
7.  (C) ON THE QUESTION OF TIES BETWEEN HAMAS\' POLITICAL 
AND MILITARY WINGS, OUR CONTACTS DIVIDED SHARPLY.  GHAZI 
HAMAD, EDITOR OF THE ISLAMIST \"AL-RESELLAH,\" SAID THAT 
RELATIONS WERE \"IN CRISIS\" AS A RESULT OF RECENT ARRESTS 
AND THE APPARENT LOSS OF INFLUENCE BY THE MORE 
\"PRAGMATIC,\" INSIDE LEADERSHIP.  HAMAD ARGUED THAT THE 
ARRESTS, WHILE RANDOM (ALTHOUGH WANTED, HAMAD AVOIDED 
ARREST SIMPLY BY STAYING AT A FRIEND\'S HOUSE AND 
AVOIDING HIS OFFICE FOR A FEW DAYS), WAS COMPELLING 
HAMAS TO SHOW THAT IT COULD STILL RESPOND.  HAMAD ARGUED 
THAT THE GUSH KATIF ATTACK WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THE LOSS OF 
POLITICAL CONTROL OVER THE MILITARY WING -- YASIN HAD 
BEEN DEEPLY TROUBLED BY THE ATTACK AND ITS IMPLICATIONS 
FOR HIS FUTURE ABILITY TO COME TO A MORE VIABLE MODUS 
VIVENDI (FROM HAMAS\' STANDPOINT) WITH THE PA. 
 
8.  (C) FALOUJI CAST THE PROBLEM IN DIFFERENT TERMS.  HE 
TOLD US THAT YASIN\'S OBJECTIONS TO THE GUSH KATIF ATTACK 
WERE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR ABILITY TO WRECK HAVOC 
WITH HIS ATTEMPTS TO IMRPOVE TIES WITH THE PA, BUT 
BECAUSE THEY SHOWED THAT THE OUTSIDE LEADERSHIP WAS IN 
A POSITION TO ORDER ATTACKS WITHOUT HIS SPECIFIC 
APPROVAL.  BUT WHILE THERE WERE DISAGREEMENTS, FALOUJI 
SAID THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF A BREAKDOWN IN 
COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN HAMAS OR A CRISIS (AS HAMAD 
CLAIMED) IN THE HAMAS LEADERSHIP. 
 
ENDING YASIN\'S HOUSE ARREST 
--------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) AL-HASSAN ALSO REPORTED THAT HE HAD MET YASIN 
RECENTLY AND HAD FOUND HIM TO BE IN \"HIGH MORALE\" AND 
OCCUPYING HIMSELF BY READING ISLAMIC HISTORY.  THE 
WHEELCHAIR-BOUND YASIN POSSESSES ONLY A \"BRAIN, 
IDEOLOGY, AND WILL,\" ACCORDING TO AL-HASSAN, AND HAS 
LITTLE ELSE TO LIVE FOR OTHER THAN HIS \"CAUSE.\"  BUT AL- 
HASSAN WARNED THAT THE PROLONGED HOUSE ARREST OF AL- 
HASSAN WAS PROVING TO BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.  WITHOUT 
YASIN AND WITH MOST OF THE LOCAL LEADERSHIP IN AND OUT 
OF PA PRISONS OR OTHERWISE \"MARGINALIZED,\" ACCORDING TO 
AL-HASSAN, HAMAS\' OUTSIDE LEADERSHIP WAS BECOMING MORE 
PROMINENT.  AL-HASSAN REPORTED THAT YASIN TOLD HIM 
DURING THEIR MEETING THAT HE WAS \"NOT RESPONSIBLE\" FOR 
ANY FUTURE HAMAS ATTACKS, IMPLYING THAT HE COULD NOT BE 
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ATTACKS ORDERED FROM THE OUTSIDE. 
AL-HASSAN SAID HE WAS URGING ARAFAT TO END YASIN\'S 
ISOLATION, IF ONLY TO REASSERT THE POWER OF THE LOCAL 
LEADERSHIP.  FALOUJI ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS PUSHING 
ARAFAT TO RELEASE YASIN FROM HIS HOUSE ARREST AND HOPED 
FOR RESULTS \"VERY SHORTLY.\" 
 
DEALING WITH HAMAS 
------------------ 
 
10.  (C) AL-HASSAN OFFERED A SIMILAR ASSESSMENT OF THE 
WYE AGREEMENT TO THAT FOUND IN A HAMAS MEMORANDUM ON THE 
SAME SUBJECT.  THE WYE PLANTATION MEMORANDUM WAS 
BASICALLY A \"SECURITY MEMORANDUM\" RATHER THAN A 
POLITICAL DEAL.  (COMMENT:  THIS VIEW IS WIDESPREAD IN 
GAZA.)  HE EMPHASIZED THAT HAMAS WAS A POLITICAL PROBLEM 
AND COULD NOT BE SOLVED BY PURELY SECURITY-RELATED 
MEANS.  A PROBLEM, HE NOTED, THAT IRONICALLY PLAGUED 
HAMAS ITSELF WHICH ALSO SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A \"MILITARY\" 
SOLUTION ON THE POLITICAL PROBLEM OF THE ARAB-ISRAELI 
DISPUTE.  AL-HASSAN DESCRIBED YASIN AS TAKING A LONG- 
TERM VIEW OF HIS SITUATION.  \"THESE MEN THINK IN TERMS 
OF 25 YEARS, NOT A FEW WEEKS.  THEY HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS 
FOR TOMORROW,\" AL-HASSAN COMMENTED.  AT THE SAME TIME, 
HE NOTED THAT PA OFFERS OF A TRUCE TO HAMAS WOULD LIKELY 
BE REJECTED.  THE PA HAD CONVINCED HAMAS NOT TO TAKE 
\"MILITARY\" ACTIONS IN THE PAST, BUT HAD SUFFERED 
GRIEVOUS LOSSES, INCLUDING MUHI AL-DIN AL-SHERIFI, THE 
AWADALLAH BROTHERS, AND OTHERS.  AL-HASSAN CONCLUDED 
THAT THE PA HAD MISSED OPPORTUNITIES IN THE PAST TO 
DESTROY HAMAS (HE DID NOT SPECIFY WHAT THESE 
OPPORTUNITIES WERE).  THE SOLUTION NOW WAS TO ISOLATE 
HAMAS POLICALLY BY MAKING PROGRESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS. 
 
11. (C) FALOUJI ALSO SAID HE WOULD PUSH ARAFAT TO END 
YASIN\'S HOUSE ARREST.  BASING HIS COMMENTS ON THE 
ASSUMPTION THAT HAMAS HAS IN FACT OFFERED A \"CEASEFIRE\" 
(AN ASSUMPTION OTHERS HAVE CHALLENGED, SEE PARA 5), 
FALOUJI CLAIMS THAT THE PA MUST NOW SHOW ITS WILLINGNESS 
TO MEET HAMAS HALF-WAY BY RELEASING MORE PRISONERS AND 
ENDING YASIN\'S HOUSE-ARREST.  TO DO OTHERWISE, FALOUJI 
CLAIMED, WOULD BE TO OPEN THE DOOR FURTHER TO HAMAS\' 
OUTSIDE LEADERSHIP, WHICH, AS ARGUED AL-HASSAN, WAS 
GAINING GROUND AT YASIN\'S EXPENSE THROUGH ITS CONTROL OF 
HAMAS FINANCES.  FALOUJI WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE PA WAS 
WEIGHING AN OFFER FOR HAMAS PARTICIPATION IN SOME 
CABINET DELIBERATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR FORMULATING THE PA 
POSITION AND PLANS FOR THE POSSIBLE DECLARATION OF A 
PALESTINIAN STATE NEXT MAY.  IN AN ASIDE, FALOUJI 
COMMENTED THAT HAMAS WOULD MOVE PART OF ITS JORDANIAN 
LEADERSHIP TO SYRIA.  FALOUJI SAID THAT MUSA ABU MARZOUK 
AND KHALID MESHAL WOULD REMAIN IN JORDAN, AS THEY CARRY 
JORDANIAN CITIZENSHIP. MOHAMMED NAZZAR AND OTHERS WOULD 
LEAD THE MOVE TO DAMASCUS.  (COMMENT:  WE HAVE SEEN 
NUMEROUS REPORTS OF A HAMAS MOVE TO DAMASCUS BEFORE.  SO 
FAR, NO MOVE.) 
 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
 
12.  (C) THROUGH THE GUSH KATIF ATTACK (WE EXCLUDE THE 
LATER JERUSALEM BOMBING FOR WHICH ISLAMIC JIHAD CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY) AND SUBSEOUENT CRACKDOWN, A RENEWED 
DEBATE OVER HAMAS AND THE FUTURE OF HAMAS - PA TIES IS 
TAKING PLACE IN GAZA.  THIS DEBATE APPEARS TO REVOLVE 
AROUND AT LEAST TWO OUESTIONS THAT ADMIT NO EASY ANSWER: 
(1) WHO CALLS THE SHOTS IN HAMAS (THE INSIDERS VS. 
OUTSIDERS ISSUE) AND (2) WHETHER THE RECENT WAVE OF 
ARRESTS HAS DONE ANYTHING TO DISRUPT RELATIONS BETWEEN 
THE MILITARY AND POLITICAL WINGS OF HAMAS.  AS IS 
APPARENT FROM THE FOREGOING, GAZANS THEMSELVES, 
INCLUDING ISLAMISTS, HAVE ARRIVED AT DIFFERENT ANSWERS 
TO THESE OUESTIONS. 
 
13. (C) FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A 
GROWING CONCERN THAT HAMAS\' OUTSIDE LEADERSHIP 
INCREASINGLY DESIRES TO BLOCK PA - HAMAS RAPPROCHEMENT. 
THIS IS PRESUMABLY BECAUSE AN UPTICK IN PA - HAMAS 
RELATIONS WOULD REDUCE OUTSIDE CONTROL OVER HAMAS BY 
GIVING THE LOCAL LEADERSHIP A COUNTER-WEIGHT TO THE 
OUTSIDE.  THE DESIRE TO MAINTAIN BETTER TIES MIGHT ALSO 
PROVE TO BE A RATIONALE FOR SUSPENDING US OF HAMAS\' MOST 
POTENT WEAPON: THE ABILITY TO MOUNT TERRORIST 
OPERATIONS.  SUCH ARGUMENTS ARE PARTIALLY CONVINCING, 
BUT NOT TOTALLY SO GIVEN THAT VIRTUALLY ALL OF HAMAS\' 
POLITICAL STRENGTH DERIVES FROM ITS POSITION INSIDE GAZA 
AND THE WEST BANK AND THUS CANNOT BE TOTALLY IGNORED BY 
ANY ASPECT OF ITS LEADERSHIP.  HAMAS\' ROLE IN THE 
PALESTINIAN DIASPORA IS MUCH WEAKER THAN, FOR EXAMPLE, 
FATAH\'S.  IT WOULD ALSO APPEAR THAT HAMAS WOULD LOSE A 
GREAT DEAL OF ITS POPULAR SUPPORT IF IT WERE TO LAUNCH 
AN ATTACK NOW, GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF A RENEWED CLOSURE 
IMPOSED BY THE GOI. 
 
14.  (C) ON THE SECOND QUESTION CONCERNING THE EFFICIACY 
OF THE RECENT ARRESTS, MOST OF OUR CONTACTS (WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF HAMAD), BELIEVED THAT THE EFFECT WAS 
NEGLIBLE.  IF WE CAN BELIEVE AL-HASSAN\'S STORY OF 
YASIN\'S HIGH MORALE WHILE READING ISLAMIC HISTORY OR ABU 
SHANAB\'S REMARKS TO THE AMERICAN REPORTER ENDORSING THE 
USE OF TERROR TO \"CONTROL\" ISRAEL, THERE SEEMS TO BE 
LITTLE QUESTION OF AN ORGANIZATION IN A DEEP CRISIS. 
SEEN FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE PERENNIAL 
OUTSIDER/INSIDER QUESTION BECOMES ONE OF EMPHASIS RATHER 
THAN ONE WHICH DETERMINES HAMAS\' OVERALL DIRECTION. 
 
15.  (C) AS A FINAL POINT, FALOUJI\'S COMMENT THAT \"HAMAS 
WILL NOT DISAPPEAR\" SEEMS TO US RELEVANT.  THE PA IS 
INCURRING SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC ANGER BECAUSE OF ITS 
CRACKDOWN, LESS BECAUSE OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR HAMAS THAN 
BECAUSE THE CRACKDOWN IS PERCEIVED TO BE BOWING TO 
ISRAELI AND U.S. DICTATES.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE PA 
PROBABLY REALIZES THAT THERE ARE LIMITS TO WHAT IT CAN 
DO AGAINST HAMAS FROM A PURELY SECURITY POINT OF VIEW, 
GIVEN HAMAS\' DEEP-ROOTEDNESS IN SOCIETY AND GIVEN THE 
VIEW OF VIRTUALLY ALL GAZANS, INCLUDING FATAH STALWARTS, 
WHICH ACCEPTS HAMAS\' RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL 
ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF TERRORISM.  YET IT IS PROBABLY ON 
THE POLITICAL LEVEL WHERE THE PA STANDS THE BEST CHANCE 
OF WINNING ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST HAMAS.  FIRST, THE PA 
WILL CLEARLY BENEFIT FROM THE PRESENT UPSURGE IN THE 
PEACE PROCESS, EVEN IF THIS PROCESS BRINGS LESS THAN 
MOST PALESTINIANS BELIEVE THEY ARE ENTITLED TO. SECOND, 
HAMAS HAS FAILED TO DEFINE A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO 
ARAFAT\'S COURSE OF ACTION.  PA PRESSURE AGAINST HAMAS, 
ESPECIALLY IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE GUSH KATIF 
BOMBING, WAS ACCEPTED BY MOST GAZANS AND SERVED AS A 
USEFUL REMINDER TO ALL PALESTINIANS THAT HAMAS\' 
TERRORIST ACTIONS THREATEN THE INTERESTS OF ALL 
PALESTINIANS.  BUT PA EFFORTS AGAINST HAMAS TO BE 
CREDIBLE WITHIN PALESTINIAN SOCIETY, MUST CONTAIN A 
POLITICAL COMPONENT, AS AL-HASSAN SUGGESTED, AS WELL.

REF: TEL AVIV 10899 AND PREVIOUS 
 
 
SUMMARY: 
-------- 
 
1.  (C) OUR CONTACTS IN GAZA HAVE PRESENTED DIFFERING 
VIEWS OVER NEXT STEPS BEING CONTEMPLATED BY HAMAS.  A 
SENIOR FATAH LEADER AND MEMBER OF THE FATAH CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE, HANI AL-HASSAN, TOLD US RECENTLY THAT HAMAS 
WAS PLANNING AN \"ELECTION\" FOR MEMBERS OF ITS POLITBURO 
AND CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY.  AL-HASSAN SAID HE WAS 
SEEKING TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION, WHICH, 
HE SAID, WOULD PIT OUTSIDERS AGAINST INSIDERS.  AL- 
HASSAN SAID HE FEARD THAT HAMAS COULD SPLIT FOLLOWING 
THE ELECTION, LEAVING THE MORE RADICAL ELEMENT OF HAMAS 
IN UNCERTAIN HANDS.  BY CONTRAST, ISLAMIST WEEKLY \"AL- 
RISALLAH\" EDITOR GHAZI HAMAD, TOLD US THAT WHILE HAMAS 
IS INDEED DEBATING ITS FUTURE, NO ELECTION WILL BE 
HELD IN THE NEAR TERM.  HAMAD SAID HAMAS FACED INTERNAL 
DIFFICULTIES AND SAID THAT YASIN WAS FACING A \"HEAVY 
BURDEN\" TO ATTEMPTING TO MANTAIN UNITY AND INFLUENCE 
HIS ORGANIZATION\'S FUTURE COURSE.  BOTH HAMAD AND AL- 
HASSAN SAID THEY DID NOT FORESEE \"MILITARY OPERATIONS\" 
IN THE NEAR TERM, ALTHOUGH THEY OFFERED DIFFERENT 
REASONS FOR THEIR VIEWS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
AL-HASSAN: GET READY FOR SEPTEMBER 19 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) EMBASSY CONTACTS IN GAZA HAVE PROVIDED DIFFERING 
VIEWS OF HAMAS\' NEAR-TERM STRATEGY.  HANI AL-HASSAN, A 
MEMBER OF THE FATAH CENTRAL COMMITTEE WHO HAS MAINTAINED 
CLOSE LINKS TO PALESTINIAN ISLAMIST MOVEMENTS THROUGH 
HIS FORMER MEMBERSHIP IN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, 
EXPRESSED CONCERN TO US THAT HAMAS FACED A SPLIT IN 
THEIR ORGANIZATION.  AL-HASSAN SAID HAMAS WAS PLANNING 
TO HOLD AN ELECTION ON SEPTEMBER 19 FOR ITS POLITBURO 
AND MAJLIS SHURA (CONSULATIVE ASSEMBLY). (COMMENT: OTHER 
AGENCY REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE SEPTEMBER 19TH DATE HAS 
ALREADY SLIPPED, PERHAPS AS FAR BACK AS DECEMBER.  DELAY 
UNTIL DECEMBER MAY PLACE THE ELECTIONS NEAR 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2ND PHASE OF WYE, POSSIBLY NOT A 
PROPITIOUS TIME FOR AN ELECTION FROM HAMAS\' POINT OF 
VIEW IF THINGS ARE GOING WELL IN THE PEACE PROCESS. 
PLACE OF THE ELECTION IS NOT KNOWN.  END COMMENT.)  THE 
ELECTION WOULD PIT KHALID MISH\'AL AGAINST ABU MARZOUK 
FOR THE HEAD OF THE POLITBURO.  AL-HASSAN SAID HE WAS 
WORKING UNDER ARAFAT\'S ORDERS TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME 
OF THE ELECTION AND TO PREVENT A SPLIT IN HAMAS THAT 
COULD LEAVE THE RADICALS WITHOUT THE MORE \"MODERATE\" 
POLITICAL CONTROL OF SHEIKH YASIN.  \"IRAN WILL GAN THE 
UPPER HAND,\" AL-HASSAN SAID IF THERE IS A SPLIT IN THE 
ORGANIZATION.  (COMMENT:  AL-HASSAN\'S COMMENTS RUN 
COUNTER TO THE POLICY TH PA HAS BEEN TELLING US THEY 
ARE FOLLOWING TOWARD HAMAS, I.E., O SPLIT OFF THE 
MODERATES, ISOLATE THE RADICALS AND MOVE AGAINST THEM. 
END COMMENT.) 
 
MISH\'AL LEADS THE CHARGE AGAINST YASIN 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) ACCORDING TO AL-HASSAN, THE KEY DYNAMIC INSIDE 
HAMAS WAS AN EFFORT BY KHALID MISH\'AL TO SEIZE CONTROL 
OF THE PARTY FROM YASIN.  AT THE ELECTION, YASIN WILL 
TRY TO PUSH FORWARD A CHANGE TO HAMAS\' OPERATING 
PROCEDURES THAT WOULD REQUIRE EXPLICIT BLESSINGS OF THE 
INSIDE LEADERSHIP BEFORE CONDUCTING \"OPERATIONS.\" 
(COMMENT: WE DO NOT SEE THE LOGIC OF SUCH A MOVE.  WHILE 
ON ITS FACE, IT MIGHT GIVE YASIN GREATER SPECIFIC 
AUTHORITY TO CONTROL \"OPERATIONS,\" THERE IS A CLEAR 
DOWNSIDE. IF KNOWN, IT WOULD EXPLICITLY TIE THE INSIDE 
LEADERSHIP TO ANY FUTURE TERRORIST OPERATION AND LEAD TO 
AN EVEN HEAVIER CRACKDOWN AGAINST HAMAS OPERATIVES IN 
AREAS UNDER PA CONTROL.)  AL-HASSAN SAID THAT THE 
MISH\'AL FACTION CURRENTLY ENJOYS A TWO-PERSON ADVANTAGE 
IN THE POLITBURO.  YASIN WAS CONTEMPLAING SENDING 
MAHMOUD ZAHHAR AND POSSIBLY ISMAIL ABU SHANAB TO 
INFLUENCE HAMAS MEMBERS IN THE GULF AND ELSEWHERE TO 
SUPPORT YASIN IN THE ELECTION.  (COMMENT: PERHAPS THE 
USG FACES A TERMINOLOGICAL PROBLEM IN REFERRING TO 
\"INSIDERS\" AND \"OUTSIDERS.\"  WE TEND TO THINK OF 
OUTSIDERS AS BEING MORE HARDLINE AND CLOSER TO THE 
MISH\'AL POSITION.  IN FACT, IF WHAT AL-HASSAN SAYS IS 
TRUE, YASIN BELIEVES HE CAN INFLUENCE THE OSTENSIBLY 
\"OUTSIDER\" VOTE TO SUPPORT HIS MORE \"MODERATE\" 
POSITION.) 
 
AL-HASSAN ON WHO\'S HOT AND WHO\'S NOT 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) SPEAKING ABOUT VARIOUS HAMAS PERSONALITIES, AL- 
HASSAN SAID THAT MAHMOUD ZAHHAR IS CLOSELY TRUSTED BY 
YASIN.  IN THE WEST BANK, YASIN RELIES ON JAMAL MANSOUR 
FROM NABLUS.  AL-HASSAN SAID THAT FUGITIVE MOHAMMED DEIF 
WAS STILL AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF HAMAS, BUT FOLLOWED 
ORDERS FROM YASIN WHO, ACCORDING TO AL-HASSAN, IS 
AGAINST \"OPERATIONS\" AT THIS TIME.  DIF IS VERY 
INTELLIGENT AND AL-HASSAN SAID HE WAS CONTINUALLY 
CUTTING OFF CONTACT WITH THOSE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO LEAD 
THE PA TO HIM.  AL-HASSAN ALSO SAID THAT SAID BAREKAT, 
FORMERLY OF THE PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ), IS 
INCREASINGLY INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE PEACE POCESS AND IS 
NOW ACTIVE IN A GROUP FOUNDED BY AL-HASSAN THAT HAS MET 
WITH ISRAELIS IN THE PAST.  AMONG OTHER PIJ MEMBERS, AL- 
HASSAN CHARACTERIZED SHELLAH AS \"NOT A REAL FIGHTER\" AND 
SAID THAT RAMADAN \"COULD BE EASILY BOUGHT OFF.\" 
 
HAMAD: NO ELECTIONS 
------------------- 
 
5.  (C) ALTHOUGH HAMAD AGREED THAT HAMAS IS FACING SOME 
DIFFICULT DECISIONS, HE SAID THERE WERE NO PLANS TO HOLD 
ELECTIONS.  UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, HAMAD SAID, AN 
ELECTION WOULD MERELY FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE DIVISIONS 
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND WAS THEREFORE UNWISE.  HAMAS 
IS FACING THE SAME ISSUES IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERING FOR 
THE PAST YEAR.  CHIEF AMONG THEM IS HAMAS\' RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE PA AND THE DEBATE OVER HOLDING \"MILITARY 
OPERATIONS.\"  YASIN IS TRYING TO REPAIR THE BREACHES IN 
THE WALLS OF HAMAS UNITY AND FEELS INCREASINGLY THAT HE 
IS UNDER A HEAVY BURDEN.  YASIN, WHILE NOT RENOUNCING 
TERROR ATTACKS, WANTS TO MOVE HAMAS INTO A MORE PURELY 
POLITICAL DIRECTION. 
 
 
HAMAS\' LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) HAMAD SAID THAT PERSONALLY HE DID NOT FORESEE 
RENEWED TERRORIST ATTACKS, DESPITE CONTINUED CLAIMS OF 
HAMAS\' ALLEGIANCE TO \"ARMED STRUGGLE.\"  HAMAD ADDED THAT 
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HAMAS \"TO REMAIN QUIET\" IN THE FACE 
OF ARRESTS AND CONTINUED DETENTION OF THEIR MEMBERS. 
BUT IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, HAMAS UNDERSTOOD THE 
CRACKDOWNS THAT WOULD FOLLOW ANY ATTACKS WERE A HIGH 
PRICE TO PAY. 
 
7.  (C) POLITICALLY, HAMAD DISCOUNTED THE POSSIBILITY OF 
A SPLIT WITHIN HAMAS.  AS HAMAD HAS SAID IN THE PAST, 
HAMAS DIFFERS INTERNALLY ON THE QUESTION OF TACTICS, BUT 
REMAINED COMMITTED TO THE \"IDEA OF HAMAS\" (I.E., 
OPPOSITION TO OSLO AND TO ANY COMPROMISE ITH ISRAEL). 
HAMAD SAID THAT THE BASIC HAMAS STRATEGY WAS TO WAIT FOR 
THE PEACE PROCESS TO FAIL.  AT THAT POINT, IT WOULD NOT 
BE AN ISSUE OF HAMAS TAKING UP ARMED STRUGGLE ALONE, ALL 
PALESTINIANS WOULD TAKE UP ARMED STRUGGLE AND HAMAS 
WOULD BE THE BEST POSITIONED TO LEAD IT. 
 
HAMAD ON HAMAS PERSONALITIES 
---------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) HAMAD ALSO COMMENTED ON SOME HAMAS 
PERSONALITIES.  ON DEIF, HAMAD SAID THAT HE REMAINED 
\"BELOVED\" AMONG PALESTINIANS BECAUSE OF THE TOLL HE 
EXACTED FROM ISRAEL.  BUT HE CHARACTERIZED DEIF AS BEING 
\"OUT OF THE PICTURE\" FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.  HAMAD ALSO 
SAID THAT RANTISSI, DESPITE HIS RE-ARREST, REMAINED VERY 
STRONG AND THAT TIME IN JAIL WOULD NOT DIMINISH HS 
STRENGTH. 
 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
 
9.  (C) ISRAELIS ARE WORRIED THAT THE RECENT UPSWING IN 
SMALL-SCALE OERATIONS PORTENDS A MUCH LARGER WAVE OF 
ATTACKS TO COME.  ACCORDING TO OUR INTERLOCUTORS IN 
GAZA, SUCH IS NOT THE CASE.  RATHER THEY POINT TO THE 
RE-ARREST OF RANTISSI, THE BRIEF INARCERATION OF ISMAIL 
ABU SHANAB, AND EVEN 12 HOURS HAMAD HIMSELF SPENT 
ENJOYING JIBALI\'S HOSPITALITY AS EVIDENCES OF A PA 
CRACKDOWN.  (HAMAD WAS DETAINED AFTER HE QUOTED NEW PA 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ZOUHAIR SOURANI CRITICIZING THE STATE 
SECURITY COURTS.)  ALSO, PA OFFICIALS ARE QUTED IN THE 
ISRAELI MEDIA AS SAYING THEY HAVE DETAINED 90 HAMAS 
ACTIVISTS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS IN RESPONSE TO HAMAS 
ATTEMPTS TO ATTACK ISRAELIS.  ON TE QUESTION OF 
ELECTIONS, WE TEND TO CREDIT HAMAD.  HAMAS LEADERSHIP 
WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY TRY TO WORK OUT DIFFERENCES 
PRIVATELY RATHER THAN ALLOW DIFFERENCES TO AIR IN ANY 
SORT OF SEMI-PUBLIC MANNER.  IF AND WHEN YASIN MANAGES 
TO SORT OUT THESE DIFFERENCES, AN ELECTION MIGHT SERVE 
HIS INTERESTS BY DEMONSTRATING HIS CONTINUING CONTROL 
OVER THE ORGANIZATION.

SUBJECT: ISRAELI RAID KILLS HAMAS ACTIVISTS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY POL/C JOHN SCOTT.  REASON 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
 
1. (C) THE GOI\'S BUREAU FOR COUNTERTERRORISM CONFIRMED 
ON DECEMBER 14 THAT AN IDF SPECIAL FORCES UNIT KILLED 
EIAD BATAT AND NADER MASALMAH IN A FIREFIGHT THE EVENING 
OF DECEMBER 13.  THE CLASH OCCURRED IN THE VILLAGE OF 
BEIT AWWA, IN AREA B, APPROXIMATELY 10 KMS WEST OF 
HEBRON, NEAR THE GREEN LINE.  ACCORDING TO MEDIA 
REPORTS, BATAT AND MASALMAH OPENED FIRE ON THE IDF UNIT 
AS IT APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEY WERE IN.  THE SPECIAL 
FORCES UNIT RETURNED FIRE, KILLING BATAT AS HE TRIED TO 
ENTER A VEHICLE TO FLEE AND MASALMAH, AS HE FIRED ON THE 
ISRAELIS FROM THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE.  THE EIGHT OTHERS 
IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME -- INCLUDING A WOMAN AND 
CHILDREN -- WERE UNHARMED.  BATAT REPORTEDLY WAS 
CARRYING A HANDGUN AND EXPLOSIVES.  GOI SOURCES TOLD THE 
MEDIA THAT BASED ON \"EVIDENCE\" AT THE SCENE AND 
\"INTELLIGENCE\" INFORMATION, IT APPEARED THAT BATAT AND 
MASALMAH WERE PREPARING TO CARRY OUT A TERRORIST ATTACK. 
THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED IN THE RAID, INCLUDING 
RELATIVES OF MASALMAH. 
 
2.  (C) ACCORDING TO LTCOL UDI LEVI OF THE 
COUNTERTERRORISM BUREAU, THE IDF UNIT HAD SPECIFIC 
INFORMATION ABOUT BATAT\'S AND MASALMAH\'S WHEREABOUTS. 
LEVI DESCRIBED BATAT AS A \"SENIOR\" FIGURE IN THE HAMAS 
MILITARY WING WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN A FIREFIGHT IN 
THE OTNIEL SETTLEMENT SW OF HEBRON LAST JANUARY, IN 
WHICH ONE BORDER POLICE OFFICER WAS KILLED AND ONE IDF 
SOLDIER WOUNDED.  LEVI SAID BATAT HAD BEEN OPERATING IN 
THE SOUTHERN WEST BANK FOR SOME TIME.  HE DESCRIBED THE 
DECEMBER 13 RAID AS THE GOI\'S MOST SUCCESSFUL AGAINST 
HAMAS SINCE THE SEPTEMBER 1998 ATTACK -- ALSO NEAR 
HEBRON -- WHICH KILLED THE ABWADALLAH BROTHERS. 
 
3.  (U) IN RESPONSE TO THE RAID, HAMAS LEADERS PUBLICLY 
VOWED TO CONTINUE ATTACKING ISRAELIS AND WARNED THAT 
ISRAEL BORE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
THE ATTACK.  PA LEGISLATOR HANAN ASHRAWI CONDEMNED THE 
RAID, TELLING THE MEDIA THAT BATAT AND MASALMAH HAD BEEN 
KILLED IN COLD BLOOD, AS PART OF THE GOI\'S POLICY OF 
\"DELIBERATELY TARGETING, THEN ASSASSINATING\" WANTED 
INDIVIDUALS THEY COULD NOT OTHERWISE BRING TO JUSTICE. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT:  LEVI WOULD NOT CONFIRM (BUT DID NOT 
DENY) THAT THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY WAS INVOLVED IN 
PROVIDING SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT BATAT\'S AND 
MASALMAH\'S WHEREABOUTS, SINCE BEIT AWWA LIES IN THE AREA 
UNDER JOINT GOI-PA CONTROL.  ALTHOUGH BATAT HAS LONG 
BEEN SOUGHT BY THE GOI, MASALMAH IS A NEWCOMER WHOSE 
NAME HAS  NOT APPEARED PREVIOUSLY ON ANY GOI LIST OF 
KNOWN TERRORISTS.  HE SIMPLY MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE WRONG 
PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME.

SUBJECT: BIN LADIN CONNECTION IN GAZA FOUND PUZZLING; 
CONNECTION TO HAMAS QUESTIONED 
 
CLASSIFIED BY DCM PSIMONS PER 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
 
1.  (C) POLITICAL CONTACTS IN GAZA EXPRESSED PUZZLEMENT 
AT ISRAELI MEDIA REPORTS OF A BIN LADIN TERROR NETWORK IN 
GAZA.  PA MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS (AND FORMER HAMAS 
SPOKESPERSON) IMAD FALOUJI TOLD POLOFF THAT HE KNEW THE 
KEY SUSPECT, NABIL OUKAL, WHO WAS A NEIGHBOR FROM 
JABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP.  FALOUJI EXPRESSED PUZZLEMENT AND 
A DEGREE OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE MEDIA REPORTS.    OUKAL 
WAS A RELIGIOUS PERSON AND A MEMBER OF THE DAIWA PARTY, 
AN ISLAMIC PARTY IN GAZA WHICH EMPHASIZES THAT AN ISLAMIC 
STATE WILL ONLY COME ABOUT AFTER EXTENSIVE RELIGIOUS 
REFORM AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT, NOTED FALOUJI.  THE 
PARTY DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE NECESSITY OF POLITICAL 
ACTION TO REACH SUCH A GOAL, BUT FOCUSES ON THE SPIRITUAL 
SIDE.  UNLIKE HAMAS AND OTHER RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUPS, 
MEMBERSHIP IN THIS PARTY IS OPEN TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO 
JOIN, WITHOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS INTO FAMILY OR PREVIOUS 
PARTY AFFILIATIONS, FALOUJI ASSERTED.  DURING THE 
INTIFADAH YEARS, BECAUSE OF ITS OPEN MEMBERSHIP, THE 
PARTY WAS HEAVILY PENETRATED BY MORE RADICAL ISLAMIC 
FACTIONS AND BY ISRAELI SECURITY FORCES, ALL OF WHOM USED 
IT TO SPY ON EACH OTHER, NOTED FALOUJI. 
 
2.  (C)    FALOUJI SAID OUKAL DID NOT \"WORK WITH HAMAS\" 
AND THE MINISTER DID NOT BELIEVE HAMAS HAD DIRECT 
CONNECTIONS WITH ANY BIN LADIN GROUP.  \"HAMAS HAS 
EVERYTHING, MONEY, ORGANIZATION, A MILITARY WING,\" AND 
HAD NO NEED FOR AN ASSOCIATION WITH SUCH A GROUP, FALOUJI 
OBSERVED.  FALOUJI ALSO DOUBTED THAT SHEIKH YASSIN, THE 
FOUNDER AND SPIRITUAL HEAD OF HAMAS, WOULD ENTER INTO 
SUCH A RELATION.  \"IT IS A MISTAKE HE WOULD NOT MAKE.  I 
KNOW SHEIKH YASSIN AND HOW HE THINKS.\"  YASSIN WAS ONE OF 
THE FIRST MEN TO ESTABLISH A MILITARY WING IN GAZA AND 
KNEW VERY WELL THE TYPE OF PEOPLE WHO WERE CAPABLE OF 
SUCH ACTIVITIES.  \"OUKAL IS NOT THE MAN TO BE DOING THIS, 
HE IS NOT A MILITARY TYPE MAN,\" AND YASSIN WOULD KNOW 
THAT, FALOUJI ASSERTED. 
 
3.  (C) IN ADDITION, HAMAS WOULD BE VERY WARY OF 
ESTABLISHING A RELATION WITH BIN LADIN BECAUSE OF THE 
PRECARIOUS POSITION OF HAMAS\' LEADERSHIP ABROAD, ALL OF 
WHOM RESIDE IN COUNTRIES WITH REGIMES THAT DETEST BIN 
LADIN, SAID FALOUJI.  JORDAN, SYRIA, AND GULF COUNTRIES 
MAINTAINED \"GOOD\" RELATIONS WITH HAMAS AND WOULD HAVE 
STRONGLY OPPOSED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY RELATIONS 
BETWEEN HAMAS AND BIN LADIN. FALOUJI DID NOT COMPLETELY 
RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF 
INDIRECT, ARMS-LENGTH RELATION BETWEEN HAMAS IN GAZA AND 
OUKAL\'S GROUP BUT IF IT EXISTED, IT IS LIKELY TO HAVE 
BEEN VIEWED AS A LOW-LEVEL, \'BILATERAL\' POLITICAL 
RELATIONSHIP, NOT AN OPERATIONAL OR SECURITY 
RELATIONSHIP, SAID FALOUJI. 
 
4.  (C) FALOUJI MAINTAINED THAT THE MEDIA WAS BLOWING ANY 
GAZA BIN LADIN CONNECTION OUT OF PROPORTION.  HE 
SPECULATED THAT THERE MAY BE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN 
OUKAL AND BIN LADIN, BUT DOUBTED IT WAS VERY EXTENSIVE. 
MAYBE OUKAL MET SOME BIN LADIN PEOPLE ABROAD, FOR EXAMPLE 
IN JORDAN OR SAUDI ARABIA, AND POSSIBILITIES WERE 
DISCUSSED, BUT HE DOUBTED IF IT WENT MUCH BEYOND THIS 
TYPE OF APPROACH. 
 
5.  (C) AHMAD ABDEL RAHMAN, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PA 
CABINET ALSO FOUND THE MEDIA REPORTS PUZZLING.  HE 
DESCRIBED BIN LADIN AS AN \"IDIOT\" WHO WOULD HAVE 
DIFFICULTY PERSUADING PALESTINIANS TO JOIN HIS TERROR 
EFFORTS.  ABDEL RAHMAN ALSO NOTED THAT \"PALESTINIANS HAVE 
THEIR OWN RADICAL ORGANIZATIONS,\" AND THAT ONLY ISOLATED 
FIGHTERS IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA WOULD FIND BIN 
LADIN\'S OUTFIT WORTH JOINING, ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT 
SOME POOR PALESTINIAN STUDENTS STUDYING IN PAKISTAN, FOR 
EXAMPLE, MIGHT FIND BIN LADIN\'S CALLS APPEALING. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  THESE REACTIONS ARE FROM PA POLITICAL-- 
NOT SECURITY -- SOURCES AND SHOULD BE VIEWED IN THAT 
LIGHT.  HOWEVER, OTHER AGENCY REPORTING TENDS TO SUPPORT 
THE THRUST OF THESE COMMENTS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE 
EXTENT OF THE BIN LADIN CONNECTION IN GAZA MAY NOT BE AS 
DEVELOPED AS REPORTED IN THE ISRAELI MEDIA.  IT IS ALSO 
WORTH NOTING THAT IN THE PAST FALOUJI\'S ASSESSMENTS OF 
SOME ISLAMIST PLAYERS IN GAZA HAVE PROVEN USEFUL.  END 
COMMENT.

LONG-TIME HAMAS WATCHER ZIAD ABU AMR TOLD POLOFF JULY 24

BENEFITS THEY\'RE REAPING FROM THE CURRENT SITUATION. ABU 
AMR DETAILED PA EFFORTS TO PERSUADE, CAJOLE, AND 
(IMPLICITLY) THREATEN HAMAS IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO STOP

HAMAS GETTING STRONGER BY THE DAY 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) GAZA LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL MEMBER AND LONG-TIME 
HAMAS WATCHER ZIAD ABU AMR TOLD POLOFF JULY 24 THAT 
HAMAS\' INFLUENCE \"HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER\" IN THE 
OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  IN HIS VIEW, THE GROUP IS 
\"BENEFITING BY DEFAULT.\"  THE CURRENT SITUATION ALLOWS 
THEM TO POINT TO WHAT SHARON IS DOING TO THE PEACE 
PROCESS AND TO MAKE THE POINT THAT \"AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF 
PROTECTING ISRAEL\'S SECURITY INTERESTS, LOOK WHAT THEY 
ARE DOING TO THE PEACE PROCESS.\"  IN ABU AMR\'S VIEW, 
DEVELOPMENTS ARE \"LENDING CREDIBILITY TO THEIR IDEAS AND 
DISCOURSE.\"   THE \"NATIONAL UNITY ATMOSPHERE\" IN ISRAEL 
HAS ALSO HELPED HAMAS, HE NOTED, TO MAKE THE POINT THAT 
WITH PEACE NEGOTIATIONS, A FINAL STATUS DEAL, AND AN 
INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE FURTHER OUT OF REACH, 
HAMAS\' REJECTIONIST IDEAS AND ANALYSIS SEEM MORE CREDIBLE 
TO MANY DISILLUSIONED, PESSIMISTIC PALESTINIANS.  SHARON 
IS PLAYING INTO HAMAS\'S HANDS BY UNDERMINING AND 
DELIGITIMIZING ARAFAT AND THE PA.  HAMAS\' STATURE HAS 
ALSO BEEN AIDED BY ITS PROMINENT INTIFADAH ROLE.  IT HAS 
PARTICIPATED IN THE VIOLENT RESISTANCE AIMED AT ENDING 
THE OCCUPATION, MOUNTED MASS PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS, AND 
STEPPED UP ITS EXTENSIVE SOCIAL WELFARE NETWORK, SAID ABU 
AMR. 
 
3.  (C) ABU AMR HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT HAMAS WAS \"IN NO 
HURRY TO DO ANYTHING,\" GIVEN THE BENEFITS THEY\'RE REAPING 
FROM THE CURRENT SITUATION, SAID ABU AMR.  HE ALSO MADE 
THE POINT THAT PALESTINIANS, INCLUDING HAMAS, WERE STILL 
CONFRONTED BY THE SHARON THREAT ISSUED AFTER THE 
DOLPHINARIUM TERROR ATTACK.  AS A RESULT OF THAT 
SITUATION, HAMAS ALSO HAD TO FACTOR IN THE PA\'S STRONG 
WARNINGS THAT \"FOOLISH ACTS\" WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED AND 
COULD FORCE THE PA TO MOVE AGAINST IT. 
 
PA \"PERSUADING\" HAMAS TO AVOID \"FOOLISH ACTS\" 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) ABU AMR DETAILED PA EFFORTS TO PERSUADE, CAJOLE, 
AND (IMPLICITLY) THREATEN HAMAS IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO 
STOP THE BOMBINGS.  AMONG OTHERS, HE MET WITH HAMAS 
SPIRITUAL LEADER SHEIKH YASSIN AND MADE THE FOLLOWING 
POINTS: 
 
-- IF SHARON DECIDES ON A \"DECISIVE BLOW,\" NO ONE WILL BE 
EXCLUDED,\" INCLUDING HAMAS; 
 
--  HAMAS HAS A LONG-TERM \"ISLAMIC STATE PROJECT, SO WHY 
JEOPARDIZE IT WITH SHORT-TERM \"FOOLISH ACTS;\" 
 
-- YOU DON\'T NEED ANY MORE OF THESE BOMBINGS.  YOU HAVE 
MADE YOUR POINT.  THEY ARE TACTICAL, NOT STRATEGIC.  IF 
THEY WERE STRATEGIC, YOU WOULD DO THEM EVERY DAY.  MORE 
NOW WOULD NOT SERVE ANY PURPOSE; AND 
 
-- WHY PUSH YOUR LUCK WITH THE PA?  IF YOU MISCALCULATE, 
YOU COULD BE FORCED INTO A CONFRONTATION YOU PROBABLY 
COULD NOT WIN. 
 
5.  (C) ABU AMR TOLD POLOFF HE HAD THE SENSE THAT HAMAS 
LEADERS WERE PERSUADED BY HIS ARGUMENTS (OTHERS IN PA 
ALSO WERE REPORTEDLY INVOLVED), FOR NOW AT LEAST.  (NOTE: 
ABU AMR MADE CLEAR HE DID NOT SYMPATHIZE WITH HAMAS\'S 
TACTICS OR GOALS, WITH REGARD TO PEACE PROCESS OR 
BUILDING AN ISLAMIC STATE.  END NOTE.)  WHEN ASKED THE 
BINYAMINA BOMBING WHICH TOOK PLACE AFTER THE TENET CEASE- 
FIRE AND THESE POST-DOLPHINARIUM ATTACKS, HE POINTED OUT 
THE THAT ATTACK APPEARED TO BE A PIJ OPERATION, A GROUP 
OVER WHICH THE PA HAS LESS CONTROL (AND WORSE RELATIONS 
THAN WITH HAMAS).  OTHER PLAYERS, POSSIBLY WITH AN ANTI- 
PA AGENDA, INCLUDING IRAN AND HIZBALLAH, HAD MORE 
INFLUENCE. 
 
6.  (C) THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME ABU AMR HAS ACTED AS 
AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE PA AND HAMAS. HE WAS ALSO 
PART OF A MEDIATION EFFORT IN THE SPRING TO PREVENT 
DIVERGENT POLITICAL INTERESTS OF THE TWO GROUPS FROM 
LEADING TO OPEN CONFLICT.  AS A PART OF THESE EFFORTS, 
ABU AMR PARTICIPATED IN \"DISCUSSIONS\" WITH HAMAS AND PA 
LEADERS TO EFFECT THE RELEASE OF HAMAS POLITICAL LEADER 
ABDEL-AZIZ AL-RANTISSI, WHOM THE PA HAD JAILED.  (NOTE: 
AL-RANTISSI WAS JAILED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD FROM LAST 
SUMMER UNTIL FEBRUARY 2001, AND THEN RE-IMPRISONED FOR A 
FEW WEEKS IN APRIL FOR PUBLIC CRITICISM OF THE PA, 
CALLING ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE JORDAN-EGYPT INITIATIVE 
\"TREACHERY.\"  ABU AMR IS APPARENTLY REFERRING TO THE MOST 
RECENT RELEASE.  END NOTE) 
 
CURRENT STAND-DOWN TACTICAL; CALCULATIONS COULD CHANGE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7.  (C) ABU AMR UNDERLINED THAT THE POST-DOLPHINARIUM 
\'STAND DOWN\' WAS ALSO TACTICAL FOR HAMAS.  NEW VARIABLES 
COULD CHANGE HAMAS\' CALCULATIONS.  AMONG SUCH VARIABLES 
COULD BE CHANGES IN THE REGIONAL SITUATION.  HAMAS 
LEADERS OUTSIDE THE TERRITORIES OR PLAYERS LIKE IRAN OR 
EVEN SYRIA MIGHT EXERT PRESSURE THAT COULD CHANGE THE 
CALCULUS.  TO ILLUSTRATE, ABU AMR DEVELOPED A POSSIBLE 
SCENARIO (AMONG MANY OTHERS):  PERHAPS FOR SOME REASON 
ISRAEL \"HIT\" SYRIA.  SYRIA IS TOO WEAK MILITARILY TO HIT 
BACK DIRECTLY SO IT WOULD USE A PROXY.  HIZBALLAH COULD 
BE TIED DIRECTLY TO SYRIA, BUT HAMAS COULD POSSIBLY BE 
USED TO PROVIDE A \'NO FINGERPRINTS\' PAYBACK. 
 
8.  (C) ABU AMR ALSO ASKED RHETORICALLY HOW LONG 
PALESTINIANS IN GENERAL WOULD BE \"PERMANENTLY 
BLACKMAILED\" BY SHARON\'S THREAT TO DEAL A \"DECISIVE 
BLOW,\" NOTING THAT EVENTUALLY THE POWER OF THE THREAT 
WOULD WEAKEN.  SUCH WEAKENING COULD ALSO BLEND IN WITH 
THE MIX OF VARIABLES THAT WOULD AFFECT HAMAS\' FUTURE 
POLITICAL CALCULATIONS, SAID ABU AMR. 
 
9. (C) COMMENT:  ONE OF THE STRONGEST FACTORS WHICH COULD 
PUSH HAMAS TO ACT IS A REVENGE MOTIVE, A DESIRE TO 
RETALIATE FOR ISRAELI ASSASSINATIONS OF ITS ACTIVISTS. 
IN THE PAST SUCH MOTIVATIONS HAVE SOMETIMES PUSHED THE 
HAMAS MILITARY WING, IGNORING OTHER POLITICAL 
CALCULATIONS.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE CONVERSATION 
WITH ABU AMR TOOK PLACE BEFORE THE ISRAELI ASSASSINATION 
OF NABLUS-BASED HAMAS ACTIVIST SALAH DARWARZE ON JULY 25. 
ABU AMR IS AN INFLUENTIAL PLC MEMBER WHO HAS WRITTEN ON 
HAMAS AND PIJ, FOLLOWS THEIR POLITICS, AND MAINTAINS GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH HAMAS LEADERS.  IN EARLIER CONVERSATIONS 
(PRE- AND EARLY-INTIFADAH) HE WAS MUCH MORE DISMISSIVE OF 
THEIR POLITICAL STATUS IN THE TERRITORIES.  END COMMENT.

Report 
 
2.  Alhurra TV Station 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli diplomatic officials as 
saying that the White House and State Department are 
not showing the same types of divisions regarding the 
disengagement plan that emerged in 2002 over the road 
map.  The newspaper quoted the officials as saying that 
the divisions that emerged during the debate over the 
road map between the White House, which was perceived 
to be pushing a policy more in tune with the Sharon 
government\'s policy, and the State Department, has not 
occurred during discussion on the US position on 
disengagement.  Jerusalem Post reported that the only 
place where some disagreement has emerged, according to 
these officials, is that the State Department seems a 
bit more determined than the White House that settlers 
evacuated from Gaza not be resettled in the West Bank. 
Jerusalem Post also reported that Israel is trying to 
derail a new European initiative to supplement the road 
map that the GOI feels will again let the Palestinians 
off the hook by presenting a plan that calls on them to 
do less than they were called to do under the road map. 
Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that in Dublin Friday 
FM Silvan Shalom embarked on a campaign to convince the 
international community that, even if the road map is 
not presently doable, the Palestinians still have 
responsibilities to fight terrorism. 
 
Yediot reported that Elchanan Tenenbaum told his 
Israeli interrogators that he had deceived Hizbullah 
and not betrayed Israel.  Sunday, leading media 
reported on Tenenbaum\'s admission that before being 
abducted he traveled to Dubai to complete a drug deal 
with Hizbullah.  Ha\'aretz reported that this week the 
High Court of Justice is due to discuss a petition 
against his immunity deal, although a High Court 
justice has declined to issue a temporary injunction to 
stop the bargain from being implemented. 
 
During the weekend, all media reported on the killing 
Friday night of a couple in a shooting attack on the 
Lahav-Ashkelon road, along the Green Line, in the 
southern Hebron hills.  PFLP-CG claimed responsibility 
for the attack.  Sunday, leading media reported that 
three Islamic Jihad operatives were killed in an 
Israeli assassination attack in Gaza City. 
 
Leading media reported that construction of the 
security fence in northwestern Jerusalem has been 
halted for one week by order of the High Court of 
Justice and at the request of Palestinian villagers. 
Ha\'aretz reported that 30 residents of Mevasseret Zion, 
a western Jewish suburb of Jerusalem, joined the 
petition, and that another 200 signed a letter of 
protest about the route of the fence.  This is the 
first time Israeli citizens living near the \"seam line\" 
between Israel and the West Bank joined a petition to 
the court over the fence\'s route.  The media reported 
that Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz and President Moshe 
Katsav implicitly condemned the court\'s decision. 
Mofaz was quoted as saying that the defense 
establishment hopes to start construction of the 
southern segment of the fence by the end of the year. 
 
All media reported that A/G Menachem Mazuz recommends 
that the next Knesset elections should be held in 2006, 
a year ahead of the planned date. 
 
Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that Saturday PA 
security men arrested a man suspected of involvement in 
last week\'s bus bombing in Jerusalem. 
 
Leading media reported that the members of the Fatah 
Revolutionary Council concluded their meeting by 
backing a cease-fire and the road map, but that they 
failed to decide on the issues of reforms and the 
disarming of militants.  The media reported that Friday 
Nablus Mayor Ghassan Shakah announced his resignation, 
accusing the PA of failing to rein in armed thugs who 
are terrorizing Palestinians in his city and other 
Palestinian communities.  An Israel Radio commentator 
said that Ghassan supports peace and cooperation with 
Israel. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee Chairman Yuval Steinitz as saying that the 
findings of the committee that looked into the 
preparations of Israel\'s intelligence branch with 
regard to an Iraqi missile attack on Israel could cause 
an upheaval in the intelligence community.  Sunday, 
Yediot cited The New York Times as saying that the 
Iraqi Governing Council has rejected initiatives to 
bring back Jews to Iraq \"because of the Palestinian 
problem.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the Israel Prison Service and 
the IDF are planning to transfer responsibility for 
more than 3,500 Palestinian security prisoners from the 
army to the prison authority. 
 
Leading media reported that over the weekend Iran and 
Syria signed a military cooperation agreement. 
 
Yediot reported that according to data presented by 
Defense Ministry D-G Amos Yaron to the Cabinet Sunday, 
Israeli security exports make up a tenth of all defense 
exports in the world.  According to the survey, Israel 
is among the five largest defense exporters in the 
world.  Leading media reported that Sunday the 
restricted diplomatic-defense cabinet approved the USD- 
1.1 billion deal with India, involving the sale of 
three Phalcon AWACS aircraft. 
 
Sunday, Maariv reported that Manal Bakher (or Bakr), 
the daughter of Palestinian PM Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala), 
who is married to an East Jerusalem physician, has 
requested Israeli citizenship. 
 
Maariv reported that the Jewish-Mexican millionaire 
Moshe Saba, who had tried to purchase Channel 10-TV, is 
under investigation in the U.S. for alleged stock 
fraud. 
 
A Maariv/New Wave poll shows that the left (mostly 
Meretz) would get five more seats in the Knesset if new 
elections were held today, mostly at the expense of 
Likud and Shinui.

Report:

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Liberal columnist Gideon Levy wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"The leader of the free world is 
today imposing a dark regime in a number of spheres, 
both domestically and internationally, behavior that is 
deeply at odds with its enlightened image and its world 
role as a preacher.  This is bad news for the world, 
maybe even worse than the immoral portrait of Israel

\"U.S. Has Lost Its Moral Right to Preach\" 
 
Liberal columnist Gideon Levy wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz (February 29): \"Look who\'s 
preaching to Israel: last Wednesday, the U.S. State 
Department released its annual report on the state of 
human rights around the world.  The chapter devoted to 
Israel makes the usual detailed and gloomy reading. 
Washington is critical of all the ills of the 
occupation, about which the human rights organizations 
and Israel have long since raised a hue and cry.... 
From this partial point of view, the report is 
important.  The other side, however, is that the United 
States has by its own hand lost its moral right to 
preach to any country in connection with human rights. 
To begin with, since 1976, no fewer than 820 people -- 
35 percent of them blacks -- have been executed in the 
United States.... Second, the State Department, which 
authored the report, represents a state that tramples 
human rights more than most others.... A country that 
is holding 660 Afghan detainees at Guantanamo without 
trial and depriving them of basic rights is in no 
position to criticize administrative detentions carried 
out by other countries.... As for the situation in 
Israel: the United States bears direct responsibility 
for the violations of human rights in this country.  If 
Washington truly wanted to, it could put an end to 
them, just as it could have long since brought the 
entire Israeli occupation to an end.... The leader of 
the free world is today imposing a dark regime in a 
number of spheres, both domestically and 
internationally, behavior that is deeply at odds with 
its enlightened image and its world role as a preacher. 
This is bad news for the world, maybe even worse than 
the immoral portrait of Israel that emerges from the 
report.\"

\"America\'s Clumsy Outreach\" 
 
Palestinian journalist Daoub Kuttab wrote in 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (March 1): \"In 
a desperate effort to reverse America\'s negative image 
in the Arab world, a new Arabic-language television 
station called Alhurra (\'the free one\') has been added 
to the diet of existing government-sponsored 
broadcasting outlets in the Arab region.... Judging 
from the broadcast content of its first day, Washington 
has a long way to go to achieve its goals.  Alhurra 
operates with a USD 62-million grant from the U.S. 
government.  Judging from its first broadcast day, 
there is no hint it will ever become self-reliant. 
Listeners can only conclude that Alhurra will always be 
the instrument of the U.S. government.... Sponsoring 
foreign radio broadcasts has been a favorite tool of 
colonial European governments.... While some expected 
the new station to be an important addition to the 
plurality of opinions available to the Arab public, its 
first day of broadcasting confirmed what the skeptics 
have been saying all along: what the U.S. needs to do 
is change its policy, not its media strategy.... Bush 
started his exclusive interview with Alhurra saying he 
hopes to encourage the spread of freedom in the Middle 
East.  His definition of freedom was very clear: \'Open 
society, free parties, secular society and independent 
press.\'  Of course, Bush didn\'t waste his time dealing 
with the mundane issue of freedom.  Rather he used his 
airtime to talk about his war on terror and what he 
considered his success in Iraq and Libya.... The 
interview conducted by Mowafq Harb, Alhurra\'s editor-in- 
chief, failed to challenge Bush on any of the issues 
being hotly debated in America.... The Arab audience 
was shocked that Harb didn\'t ask a single question 
about Israel\'s nuclear weapons when the president was 
talking ad nauseam about his efforts to free the Middle 
East from weapons of mass destruction.\"

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Leading media reported on the aftermath of talks held 
Monday by top Sharon aide Dov Weisglass and Israel\'s 
National Security Advisor Giora Eiland with senior U.S. 
Administration officials (National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of State Colin Powell): 
Ha\'aretz reported that the participants agreed that 
another round of talks is necessary before PM Sharon 
visits Washington.  Citing Reuters, Israel Radio quoted 
a White House official as saying that the U.S. is not 
yet prepared to adopt Sharon\'s disengagement plan, that 
Israel has not provided detailed plans and that a 
disengagement that would bring about a withdrawal from 
the Gaza Strip must reduce the tension between Israel 
and the Palestinians and that no side should impose 
permanent steps on the other side. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the U.S. complained through 
several channels that Israel did not notify it of its 
intention to raid several Palestinian banks, despite 
reports that the preparations for the action took 
months.  The newspaper also reported that the U.S. was 
unhappy about the lack of reports from Israel after the 
raids.  Jerusalem Post, Yediot and Hatzofe reported 
that Monday the Tel Aviv District Court placed a 
temporary lien on the approximately 40 million shekels 
(around USD 9 million) in funding for terrorist 
organizations seized by security officials from 
Ramallah banks last week, as requested by the family of 
two victims of terrorism. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Monday the U.S. Supreme 
Court rejected an appeal from the Holy Land Foundation 
for Relief and Development to reverse a U.S. decision 
to freeze and designate the charity a terrorist group 
in 2001. 
 
Israel TV reported that Sharon told Labor Party 
Chairman Shimon Peres that 10 West Bank settlements 
will be removed, along with all those in the Gaza 
Strip.  Jerusalem Post reported that FM Silvan Shalom 
defended the security fence and the planned 
disengagement when he met senior members of the British 
media on Monday.  Leading media reported that Shalom is 
expected to meet with British PM Tony Blair and British 
FM Jack Straw today. 
 
All media led with the investigation of Elchanan 
Tenenbaum and its implications, as he is slated to 
undergo a comprehensive lie detector test today that 
will determine whether he will be freed or tried. 
Commentators noted that Israeli courts do not accept 
the results of such tests. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Khalil al-Zebin, who was 
media advisor to PA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Beirut 
and Tunis, was assassinated in Gaza early today.  The 
radio reported that a small Palestinian group which had 
claimed responsibility for the assault on Egyptian FM 
Ahmed Maher in Jerusalem in December 2003 took credit 
for the murder.  A radio commentator said that the 
chaos that allows small groups to act has apparently 
reached Arafat\'s surroundings. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that a Sunday meeting with 
Jewish leaders and politicians, Sen. John Kerry, the 
Democratic presidential front-runner, pledged his 
strong support for Israel and vowed not to follow the 
Oslo path. 
 
Yediot reported that Israel has complained to the U.S. 
Embassy about an increase in the rejection of visa 
applications.  The newspaper noted that in his meeting 
with Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer during the weekend, 
Deputy Foreign Ministry D-G Yoram Ben Zeev demanded of 
Kurtzer that he cancel the waiting time for Israelis 
born in Arab states.  Ben Zeev also reportedly raised 
the issue of high-tech workers and other scientists who 
must wait for months to get visas.  The newspaper cited 
Kurtzer\'s response that he cannot promise an 
improvement of the situation in the foreseeable future, 
and that Washington decides directly on both above- 
mentioned cases. 
 
Ha\'aretz noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s 
choice for the post of PM, former ambassador to the EU 
Mikhail Fradkov, is the son of a Jew. 
 
Maariv quoted Israeli security sources as warning that 
Palestinian terrorists could make foreign workers carry 
out attacks. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that Monday Israel 
Aircraft Industries (IAI) conducted a successful test 
launch of a long-range artillery missile (LORA), which 
Ha\'aretz says is apparently meant for sale to India. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported on a dialogue between Irish-American 
author Frank McCourt and Jerusalem high-school 
students.  McCourt, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his 
memoir, \"Angela\'s Ashes,\" is in Israel as part of a 
State Department-sponsored program that started after 
the 9/11 attacks. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that the New York Tolerance 
Center, a branch of the Los Angeles-based Simon 
Wiesenthal Center, opened Sunday in the heart of 
Manhattan.

I.  \"If He Walks Like a Foreign Minister and Talks Like 
a Foreign Minister, Will He Be Foreign Minister?\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar opined in left-leaning, 
independent Ha\'aretz (March 2): \"The Americans, like 
the Europeans and Egyptians, know how to count the 
votes against the withdrawal plan among Sharon\'s 
colleagues in the Likud and other parties.  They take 
into account that the Prime Minister understands that 
without the Labor Party, he does not have the political 
strength to move a flower pot from a single windowsill 
in any of the illegal outposts on the Gaza coast, let 
alone on the West Bank.  They also assume that the 
Prime Minister knows that the seat under his good 
friend George W. Bush is beginning to shake.... since 
Sharon publicized his disengagement plan, Peres has 
been explaining that this time Sharon is serious.  For 
the first time, he points out, Sharon is not 
conditioning anything on Palestinian steps, like the 
seven days of quiet.  The only condition, which derives 
from the unilateralism of the move, is that the 
Palestinians not do anything.  Peres is already 
equipped with polls showing that the public in general, 
and Labor voters in particular, are overwhelmingly in 
favor of joining the government the day the extreme 
right leaves due to its opposition to the disengagement 
plan.\" 
 
II.  \"Sharon and Mofaz Have No Plan\" 
 
Right-wing (National Union) Knesset Member Aryeh Eldad 
wrote in mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot 
(March 2): \"Even those who were absolutely opposed to 
the Oslo Agreement, claiming that the Arabs wouldn\'t 
fill their part in the accord, can\'t deny that it 
contained a diplomatic move in which the enemy 
committed himself to certain steps.  Also, those who 
denounced the Geneva Accord as an unauthorized, non- 
mandated national suicide must admit that it is an 
agreement between sides, which still includes an 
internal logical configuration of negotiations.  But 
Sharon and Mofaz have no clue of what will happen in 
the Gaza Strip if the IDF flees from there.  There is 
no agreement.  Therefore nobody can promise that the 
Arab murderers won\'t procure strategic weapons.  What 
will Israel do to them?.... Will we demand that the 
President of the United States save us from the 
devastating consequences of a move he didn\'t want?.... 
The Prime Minister and the Defense Minister don\'t think 
two steps ahead.  They have no plan.\" 
 
III.  \"Kerry\'s Fence Straddle\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 2): \"In today\'s \'Super Tuesday\' primaries, John 
Kerry is expected to cinch his party\'s nomination.... 
Based on his own statements, to Kerry the fence is both 
necessary and a \'barrier to peace.\'  The West Bank is a 
matter for negotiations, yet anything over the Green 
Line (where Kerry seems to think the fence should have 
been built) is \'Palestinian territory.\'  Kerry has 
spoken movingly of his deep connection to Israel.  But 
so did Bill Clinton.  Kerry is considered \'pro-Israel,\' 
as is almost every candidate for national office in the 
U.S.  But after the failure of Oslo, the current war, 
and 9/11, people who care about Israel, including 
millions of Americans, have a right to know more about 
what a Kerry presidency would really mean.... We know 
that Kerry hunts doves, loves Israel, and has Jewish 
family.  But Israel\'s security is at stake.  We need to 
know more about how he would handle [the] Arab-Israeli 
conflict when he is not speaking to Jewish leaders just 
before the New York primary.\" 
 
IV.  \"Developing Anarchy \" 
 
Correspondent Efraim Ganor wrote in popular, pluralist 
Russian-language Novosty Nedely (March 1): \"Anarchy in 
the Palestinian [Authority] is not a surprise for the 
Israeli security forces.... Does Arafat know about 
this?  Of course!.... He understands that the worse the 
situation in the Palestinian Authority, the easier for 
him to force terror [against Israel].  Hungry and 
miserable people who have nothing to lose would wear a 
\'shahid\'s [suicide bomber\'s] belt\' more willingly than 
those who are able to work and feed their families. 
With his stolen billions [of dollars] Arafat considers 
himself invulnerable.  Actually, it\'s true; therefore, 
the situation in the Palestinian Authority, if it 
changes at all, would change to the worse for Israel\". 
 
V.  \"A \'Tribute\' to Rachel Corrie\" 
 
Author Ruhama Shattan wrote in Jerusalem Post (March 
2): \"On the first anniversary of her death, I want to 
thank [the late American peace activist] Rachel Corrie 
for showing Palestinian children how to despise America 
as she snarled, burned an American flag, and led them 
in chanting slogans, and as she gave \'evidence\' at a 
Young Palestinian Parliament mock trial finding 
President Bush guilty of crimes against humanity. 
Perhaps her help in fanning the flames of violent anti- 
American sentiment led to the October 2003 bombing of 
the Fulbright delegation to Gaza to interview 
scholarship candidates, killing three.  There will be 
no new crop of Palestinian Fulbright scholars this 
fall.\"

TAGS: ENRG, IS, GOI EXTERNAL, ECONOMY AND FINANCE 
SUBJECT: NEGOTIATIONS FOR EGYPT/ISRAEL GAS PIPELINE CONTINUE 
 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Theodore A. Mann for reasons 1.4 (b) 
and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  The Egypt/Israel gas pipeline project is 
approaching some of the final hurdles in the negotiations 
between the many parties, according to the Senior Vice 
President of the Israeli firm Merhav, Nimrod Novik.   In a 
conversation with Embassy econoff on March 1, Novik said the 
process was moving ahead, but there are five outstanding 
issues that still need to be resolved, mostly on the Israeli 
side.  Merhav is a partner in the joint Israeli-Egyptian firm 
Eastern Mediterranean Gas (EMG), which is the company 
negotiating the contract to bring Egyptian natural gas to 
Israel.  Novik expects that most of these issues will be 
resolved in a meeting of the Israeli Economic Cabinet this 
week or next.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) In recent weeks, Israeli media has suggested that the 
Egypt-Israel natural gas project had reached an impasse over 
the unwillingness of the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) to 
provide a letter of credit to EMG to cover their development 
costs, in the event that circumstances prevent the firm from 
being reimbursed.  Novik rejected this speculation and said 
that terms of a letter of credit with IEC have been agreed to 
in principle and the amount is less than the USD 200 million 
reported in the press.  Novik said that this is one of five 
issues that will need to be agreed upon by the GOI\'s Economic 
Cabinet. 
 
3.  (C) The remaining issues according to Novik also deal 
with liability issues. All of these items are scheduled to be 
discussed, according to Novik, at the Economic Cabinet 
meeting this week or next. 
 
-- The GOI has asked for a guarantee from the GOE to provide 
the natural gas quantities agreed upon.  Novik said that the 
GOE has agreed in principle to this guarantee and that 
Mubarak reaffirmed this commitment in a conversation with 
Shimon Peres a few weeks ago. 
 
-- The IEC has been unwilling to sign a traditional take or 
pay agreement with the GOE.  IEC is not responsible for the 
construction of the natural gas system and so did not want to 
be held liable if the system was not completed on schedule, 
and therefore unable to take the gas.  The Israeli Natural 
Gas Line (INGL) has agreed to take on this liability, however 
the agreement needs the Economic Cabinet\'s endorsement. 
 
-- The IEC wants a guarantee from the government that the 
IPPs will be allowed to access the natural gas supply under 
the same terms as the IEC, should IEC not be able to use all 
of the gas that it is contracted to buy from Egypt. 
 
-- EMG believes that the Egyptian-Israeli partnership should 
not be taxed because it is the exporter, and that IEC as the 
importer should be responsible for the tax liability.  Novik 
claims that IEC has agreed to accept the tax liability both 
now and in the future should government policy change. 
 
4.  (C) Novik expects that the Economic Cabinet will resolve 
each of these issues in its meeting.  He said his only 
concern is that if there is a delay, the detractors of this 
project within Israel could mount a campaign to scuttle the 
project.  Novik said that the Knesset is scheduled to debate 
the project on March 15, and that opponents, led by those 
associated with the British Gas/Palestinian project, are 
planning on making \"a lot of noise\" against the project. 
When asked about similar problems within the Egyptian 
parliament, Novik dismissed recent press reports as not 
relevant.  Novik reiterated the commitments EMG has received 
from President Mubarak, the Egyptian General Petroleum 
Corporation, the Egyptian Gas Holding Company, and  others 
within the Egyptian government.  Novik concluded that the 
issues remaining were difficult \"as all final issues are\", 
but achievable.

SUBJECT: PEACE NOW CHIEF SKEPTICAL BUT SUPPORTIVE OF PM\'S 
DISENGAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Richard LeBaron for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The head of Peace Now told Embassy econoff 
that he welcomed the PM\'s initiative calling for the 
unilateral dismantling of settlements in the Gaza Strip and 
some in the West Bank.  Peace Now is skeptical, however, 
about the PM\'s seriousness and cautioned the U.S. to look at 
the actions of this government rather than the words.  The 
organization does not foresee the imminent demise of the 
government coalition despite the harsh rhetoric from those 
within the government who oppose the plan.  Peace Now 
predicts those in opposition to the plan will wait until the 
PM takes an irrevocable step before quitting the government, 
such as the ordering of the evacuation of a settlement or 
large occupied outpost.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) The General Secretary of Peace Now, Yariv 
Oppenheimer, told Embassy econoff on February 25 that his 
organization is taking a wait and see approach to the PM\'s 
unilateral disengagement plan.  Oppenheimer said the hallmark 
of Sharon\'s settlement policy has been \"positive rhetoric, 
backed up by little action on the ground.\"  Oppenheimer 
remarked that had the PM taken already promised action 
against the outposts there would be few outposts remaining. 
Oppenheimer remarked that the government\'s unofficial motto 
to the settlers is \"see what I do, not what I say.\" 
Oppenheimer speculated that the PM may have made the decision 
to announce the unilateral disengagement plan for any number 
of reasons, including: to divert attention from his ongoing 
legal troubles; to staunch the negative tide of international 
pressure caused by the seam-zone barrier; to appear to the 
Israeli public as having a long-term strategy; or because he 
really believes this is the best option at this time. 
Oppenheimer suggested that the real answer is probably a 
combination of these factors, but cautioned against expecting 
action any time soon. 
 
3.  (C) Oppenheimer was upbeat about the effect that the 
announcement has had upon the Israeli public.  During last 
year\'s election the Likud \"successfully painted Mitzna 
(former Labor party leader) as naive for proposing this 
plan,\" Oppenheimer said. \"Now, this same plan is being 
introduced by Sharon.\"  Oppenheimer highlighted the widely 
reported poll in the nation\'s largest independent newspaper, 
Yediot Aronoth, which claimed that three-quarters of the 
Israeli population support a unilateral withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip settlements.  According to Oppenheimer, it will be 
very difficult for the national consensus to walk away from 
the concept of withdrawing from the Gaza Strip settlements 
now that their \"architect is on board.\"  Sharon, he said, has 
made the idea of unilateral settlement withdrawal a centrist 
philosophy again. 
 
4.  (C) Oppenheimer said he has been stunned by the low key 
response to the initiative from settlement leaders.  He 
perceived the settler\'s march to the PM\'s office last week, 
their current vigil outside the Knesset, and statements by 
their leadership as perfunctory, lacking the fire and numbers 
that were typical of protests at the start of the Oslo 
Accords.  Oppenheimer speculated that the reason for this low 
key response could be three-fold; the Gaza Strip settlements 
are small, holding little spiritual or historic value to most 
Israelis; the majority of settlers in the West Bank have 
resigned themselves to the possibility of Gaza settlements 
being evacuated; and/or the settlers are skeptical about 
whether Sharon is committed. 
 
5. (C) When asked about whether the settlement withdrawal 
plan could initiate the fall of the current government 
coalition, Oppenheimer said that he believed it unlikely that 
either the National Religious Party (NRP) or National Union 
would leave the government before an irrevocable step was 
taken.  Only the dismantlement of a settlement or serious 
action against large occupied outposts would cause these 
parties to abandon their current posts.  Oppenheimer 
predicted that the leadership of these parties will denounce 
a PM visit to the U.S. to gain support for the plan, but will 
stop short of leaving the government.  Oppenheimer stressed 
that ministers Eitam, Elon, Lieberman, Katz, and other 
settlement supporters in the government are being given a 
virtual free hand to continue settlement activity, at the 
mere cost of the PM\'s verbal statements to the U.S.  These 
ministers know that if they quit the government, their 
replacements (probably the Labor party) will freeze most 
settlement activity, Oppenheimer said.  He concluded that 
\"they will wait until the last possible moment before leaving 
the government.\" 
 
6.  (C) Comment:  We agree with Oppenheimer\'s analysis, 
despite Lieberman\'s threats to the contrary, that the NRP and 
National Union will remain in the government as long as they 
can still credibly claim to their constituents that they are 
using their positions to foil the PM\'s disengagement 
impulses.  The GOI continues to provide funding and 
assistance for settlement activity and drag its feet on the 
removal of all outposts established after March 2001.  NRP 
and National Union can argue reasonably to their constituents 
that this would not be possible if they left the government. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND: MARCH 2, 2004 (1400 
HOURS LOCAL) -- ARAFAT ADVISOR ASSASSINATED IN GAZA BY 
PALESTINIAN GUNMEN 
 
 
THIS IS A JOINT MESSAGE FROM EMBASSY TEL AVIV AND CONGEN 
JERUSALEM. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: Arafat advisor for human rights and media 
issues Khalil al-Zaben was shot and killed March 2 by unknown 
Palestinian gunmen in Gaza City.  One settler was injured 
March 2 after Palestinians fired a mortar on Neve Dekalim. 
In the West Bank, the IDF killed one Palestinian March 1 near 
Hebron, during a siege of the house of a suspected terrorist, 
and one IDF soldier was wounded in a stone-throwing incident 
near Bayt Ummar the same day.  End Summary. 
 
--------- 
West Bank 
--------- 
 
2.  (SBU) ATTACKS: 
 
-- Death: The IDF March 1 killed one Palestinian in Yatta 
village, south of Hebron.  The incident came as the army 
besieged a house, in which it suspected a terrorist was 
hiding.  When someone ran out of the house, the troops shot 
and killed him.  Press reports indicated that he was not the 
target of the operation.  Later, the army destroyed the house 
and imposed a curfew on the village. 
 
-- Injury: The IDF March 1 injured one Palestinian in Burkha 
village, near Nablus, during clashes that erupted when 
Israeli forces mounted an arrest operation in the village 
that netted three arrests. 
 
-- Injury: Palestinians March 1 injured one Israeli soldier 
in Bayt Ummar when they threw stones at troops patrolling the 
village. 
 
-- Shooting: Palestinian gunmen March 1 mounted two shooting 
attacks near Ramallah that caused no injuries but did damage 
one Israeli car.  Two other shooting incidents the same day, 
one near Homesh and the other near Shaked, likewise caused no 
injuries. 
 
3.  (SBU) ARRESTS: 
 
-- The IDF March 1 arrested three Palestinians in Burkha 
village, near Nablus. 
 
4.  (SBU) DEMOLITIONS: 
 
-- The IDF March 1 demolished three families, tents in Al 
Khader village, near Bethlehem.  The families had set up the 
tents on the site where their homes had stood until the IDF 
demolished them a few weeks ago.  Reports indicated that the 
demolitions were carried out because the houses (and then 
tents) overlooked Route 60, a road used by settlers.  The 
ostensible reason was a lack of building permits. 
 
5.  (SBU) SETTLEMENT EXPANSION/EVACUATION: 
 
-- Palestinians reported March 1 that settlers in Tekoa had 
moved barrels, perhaps for a water supply, to a location 
outside the settlement\'s boundary. 
 
---------- 
Gaza Strip 
---------- 
 
6.  (SBU) ATTACKS: 
 
-- Deaths: Unknown Palestinian gunmen shot and killed Khalil 
al-Zaben, an advisor to Yasir Arafat on human rights and 
media issues, early in the morning March 2 in the Sabra 
district of Gaza City.  No group yet has claimed 
responsibility for the attack. 
 
-- Injuries: One settler was injured March 1 when 
Palestinians fired a mortar at Neve Dekalim settlement, 
according to UNRWA. 
 
-- Injuries: UNRWA reported that one Palestinian was shot and 
injured March 1 after soldiers in an IDF convoy on the 
Karni-Netzarim Road responded with machine gun fire to a 
Palestinian shooting attack. 
 
-- Mortars/Rockets: The IDF reported that a total of four 
mortars were fired March 1-2: one at Neve Dekalim, one at an

artery, was open for Palestinians March 2. 
 
-- The Erez Crossing was open March 2, and 9,146 Palestinian 
laborers crossed into Israel.  All workers must be married 
and over age 35.  The Erez Industrial Zone was open March 2,

1.  Mideast 
 
2.  Performance of Ariel Sharon 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The investigation of Elchanan Tenenbaum: 
-In its expansive lead story, Maariv revealed that 
Shimon Cohen, Tenenbaum\'s father-in-law, was PM 
Sharon\'s agricultural instructor and friend, and that 
Sharon\'s late wife Lili was a partner in and managed 
for years a company owned by Cohen that marketed the 
produce from Sharon\'s farm.  Yediot mentioned the 
connection in a modest news item.  Maariv and other 
media cited denials by Sharon and his bureau that he 
knew about the family connection between Cohen and 
Tenenbaum.  On Israel Radio, Cohen said that his 
connection with Sharon ended in 1975. 
-Ha\'aretz reported that Tenenbaum had top-secret 
military documents in his possession before leaving for 
Dubai.  Ha\'aretz says that its exclusive disclosure 
only heightens the mystery of why officials were in 
such a hurry last week to work out the controversial 
immunity deal with Tenenbaum. 
 
Leading media reported that the U.S. and Israel will 
hold more rounds of talks in Jerusalem and Washington 
about Sharon\'s proposed \"unilateral disengagement\" plan 
before Sharon is actually invited to the White House. 
Jerusalem Post reported that Tuesday senior diplomatic 
officials downplayed reports in various Israeli media 
that the U.S. Administration told top Sharon aide Dov 
Weisglass that the disengagement move should wait until 
after the November presidential elections.  Reporting 
on FM Silvan Shalom\'s diplomatic meetings in London, 
leading media wrote that the UK gives qualified support 
to the disengagement plan.  Yediot reported that 
Tuesday British PM Tony Blair told him about his plan, 
according to which the territories would be divided 
into areas controlled by Palestinian officers not 
subordinated to PA Chairman Yasser Arafat.  Yediot 
quoted senior GOI sources as saying that Israel and the 
U.S. reject the initiative and believe that it will 
only strengthen Arafat. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Ya\'alon as 
reiterating Tuesday before the Knesset Foreign Affairs 
and Defense Committee that he opposes Sharon\'s plan to 
give up the \"Philadelphi axis\" -- the 100-200 meter 
wide strip of Israeli-controlled territory between 
Egypt and the Gaza Strip.  Ya\'alon said that should 
Israel concede it, the route would be wide open to arms 
smuggling from Egypt to Gaza. 
Jerusalem Post (banner) and other leading media 
reported that Tuesday Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz told 
the High Court of Justice that settlers must leave six 
West Bank outposts or else the IDF will evacuate them. 
Jerusalem Post and Yediot cited data released by the 
governmental Central Bureau of Statistics Tuesday: 
there were 1,850 building starts in the territories in 
2003 -- a 35 percent rise from 2002.  Also in 2003, 
total building starts in Israel fell to their lowest 
since 1989, the start of mass immigration from the FSU. 
 
Jerusalem Post printed a Letter to the Editor from the 
U.S. Embassy Spokesman, criticizing an opinion piece 
about Rachel Corrie, an American peace activist crushed 
to death last year by an Israeli military bulldozer, 
published Tuesday in the newspaper by author Ruhama 
Shattan as \"nothing less than hateful incitement.\" 
Shattan had claimed that Corrie\'s \"help in fanning the 
flames of violent anti-American sentiment\" may have led 
to \"the October 2003 bombing of the Fulbright 
delegation to Gaza to interview scholarship candidates, 
killing three.\" 
 
All media reported that Tuesday a large-scale terrorist 
attack was averted in Tel Aviv, and that the security 
forces declared a state of alert and conducted searches 
mostly in the southern part of the city and the area of 
the Central Bus Station.  A gag order was issued 
regarding the case. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Palestinian PM Ahmed Qurei (Abu 
Ala) as saying Tuesday that Arafat agreed that members 
of PA security forces would be paid directly, which 
Qurei said removed an obstacle in the way of vital 
foreign aid.  Asked by Channel 2-TV Tuesday if Islamic 
Jihad was contemplating a truce in attacks against 
Israel, Nafiz Azzam, a senior member of the group, said 
that many in the organization have second thoughts on 
the matter in light of the frequent assassinations. 
 
Yediot reported that a few days ago Qatari 
transportation official Akbar Al-Baker invited 
Transportation Minister Avigdor Lieberman to a 
professional conference that will take place in early 
May.  The newspaper quoted Lieberman, \"an unpopular 
figure in the Arab world,\" as saying that he is 
inclined to accept the invitation. 
 
Leading media cited The New Yorker magazine as saying 
that an Israeli intelligence unit deciphered an Iranian 
code used in communications with Pakistan. 
 
Yediot reported that the Immigrant Absorption Ministry 
has devised a plan nicknamed \"Business IL\" to make 
Israelis who left the country come back.  The program, 
which includes loans and financial benefits, will first 
be publicized in a U.S.-wide campaign.  The newspaper 
quoted skeptical Israeli emigres as saying that they 
might get loans but no jobs. 
All media reported on Thursday\'s bombings against 
Shiites in Karbala and Baghdad, in which over 140 
people were killed and hundreds of others were wounded. 
Leading media quoted Hizbullah leader Sheikh Hassan 
Nasrallah as saying that Israel stands to gain from 
causing a war between Sunnis and Shiites. 
 
All media reported that NASA revealed Tuesday, based on 
findings from its Opportunity rover, that water was 
once abundant on Mars.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Americans Give Sharon a \'Hazing\'\" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer and the late prime minister 
Yitzhak Rabin\'s assistant Eytan Haber opined in the 
lead editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (March 3): \"The words that were not uttered by 
spokesmen in Washington were: \'Respected sir, we will 
not set a date for your visit, and you will not come 
here until it is absolutely clear to us what your plan 
for separation from your Palestinian neighbors 
entails.\'  Or in even other words: \'Have you 
coordinated your position with the Palestinians and 
Egypt?  We want the Palestinians to agree to your plan. 
Don\'t trick us any more, the vagueness of your policies 
and actions may be your chief tool in war -- but don\'t 
use it here.\'  The Americans, who have not greeted 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan enthusiastically, are 
giving him a \'hazing.\'  They do not want any shockwaves 
in the Middle East before their elections.  As far as 
they are concerned, Sharon will have to sweat some 
before he gets to shake George Bush\'s hand and bask in 
the light of the camera flashes.  There are no free 
meals at the White House.  Either way, Sharon\'s real 
moments of truth are drawing near.  At the end of March 
he will go to Washington where he will be obliged to 
present a detailed and genuine plan to the 
administration.  If the plan that he devised of late is 
genuine and is meant to be implemented (and I am 
certain that that is the case), the coming month of 
May, give or take a week or a month, will be a critical 
moment in Arik Sharon\'s political career.\" 
 
II.  \"Sharon\'s Gamble\" 
 
Conservative columnist Yosef Harif wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (March 3): \"As far as he is concerned, 
the Prime Minister\'s latest diplomatic moves constitute 
a critical gamble, as he has placed all his chips in a 
single basket -- that of President George Bush.  If the 
latter doesn\'t like his ideas, Sharon will be depicted 
as politically broke.... He doesn\'t intend to discuss 
with Bush an annexation of security zones included in 
Sharon\'s interim arrangement plan.  In this regard, his 
ideas coincide with those once enunciated by Dr. Henry 
Kissinger: replacing the motto \'land for peace\' with 
\'land for time\' -- time for examining interim 
arrangements and chances for coexistence between 
Palestinians and Israelis.  It is very doubtful whether 
the Palestinians would accept such ideas today.... If, 
after all, [Sharon] were prepared to sacrifice the Gush 
Katif [Gaza Strip] settlements and some other ones in 
the West Bank, one could apparently assume that Sharon 
did so because of a possible hidden understanding with 
Bush.  This is what his associates believe.  Truth 
can\'t be concealed for much longer.  Does Sharon have a 
silent understanding with Bush or is he just gambling?\" 
 
 
III.  \"Gaza\'s Reluctant Neighbor Stays Aloof\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(March 3): \"It is a mistake on Israel\'s part to regard 
Egypt in the conflict with the Palestinians as a 
policeman tasked with catching smugglers.  The role of 
the leader of the Arab world should be much broader -- 
on condition it indeed wants to end the Israeli- 
Palestinian conflict that threatens to sweep into its 
territory.  Egypt has made efforts in the last two 
years to achieve a cease-fire, but the Hamas leadership 
out-maneuvered it without paying anything for the 
prestige that it won as a result of that Egyptian 
mediation.  Why should Egypt agree to accept from 
Israel the role of a bit player in Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan?\" 
 
IV.  \"Words Have Failed Us\" 
 
Palestinian affairs correspondent and far-left 
Palestinian sympathizer Amira Hass opined in Ha\'aretz 
(March 3): \"This is an admission of failure.  The 
written word is a failure at making tangible to Israeli 
readers the true horror of the occupation in the Gaza 
Strip.... A picture [too] may indeed be worth a 
thousand words, but for the Israeli occupation to 
approach some level of comprehension, Israelis need to 
see tens of thousands of photographs, one after the 
other, or watch documentaries that are at least eight 
hours long each, so they could grasp in real time the 
fear in the eyes of the school children when some 
whistling above turns into twisted crushed metal with 
charcoaled bodies inside.... The IDF operates within 
the logic of ... arrogant, cynical, and ruthless 
settlements of a privileged fat few sitting in the 
midst of the only land reserves that the Palestinians 
have in the Gaza Strip.  Despite talk of \'withdrawal,\' 
Israeli society has yet to show any signs that it is 
shaking off the blatantly immoral logic that feeds the 
very existence of the settlements.  And that\'s as true 
of the Gaza Strip as it is of the West Bank.\"

\"Return the Keys\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit \"addressed\" Prime 
Minister Sharon on page one of popular, pluralist 
Maariv (March 3): \"Mister Prime Minister.... For long 
weeks you and your associates explained why you are so 
determined to bring Elchanan Tenenbaum back home. 
\'Arik, savior of the Jews,\' we named you.  Poor 
Tenenbaum, they extracted all his teeth.  The barbarian 
savages.  Today he is in Hizbullah captivity, tomorrow 
who knows.  Either he will be killed, or die of his own 
accord.  And here, it is all tall tales.  Neither teeth 
nor ears.  The only savage we have seen here is 
Tenenbaum himself.  A swindler who endangered state 
security for money, the man with a thousand faces, lies 
and families.  Why didn\'t you reveal the relationship 
between you, indirect or direct, that was exposed today 
in these pages?  What is so complicated about telling 
the truth?.... You dragged a government, a state, a 
nation in your wake.  Without blinking.  Is it possible 
that you don\'t even understand this?  If so, it is an 
even harsher problem.  This is, perhaps, your natural 
way of thinking.... There is no choice.  You can no 
longer rule us.  You have lost your basic legitimacy. 
We have lost faith in you.  We somehow got through the 
stories, the recordings, the photographs, the denials, 
the silences.  We tried to wipe the saliva off our 
faces and move on.  We can no longer do it.  For your 
sake, for our sake, for the sake of the country that 
means so much to you: vacate the stage, go to the 
president and from there go home, to the Sycamore 
Farm.\"

1. (S) Summary:  NSC Counterterrorism Chief BG Danny Arditi 
expressed concern to the Ambassador March 1 about continuing 
support from Hizballah for Palestinian terror groups in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip.  While the U.S. and Israel are 
making progress in combating financial flows from Saudi 
Arabia and Europe, he said, flows from Hizballah in the last 
two weeks alone amounted to close to $1 million.  According 
to Arditi and his staff, these funds are channeled primarily 
through the Arab Bank and Western Union.  Arditi defended the 
IDF operation the previous week that seized $9 million from 
310 bank accounts in Ramallah, although he took on board U.S. 
criticisms and made clear that this operation was \"unique.\" 
End Summary. 
 
2. (S) In a March 1 meeting with Ambassador Kurtzer and 
poloff, NSC Counterterrorism Bureau Chief BG Danny Arditi 
expressed concern that Palestinian terror groups, 
particularly those in the West Bank, are receiving 
considerable support from Hizballah.  He opined that 
Hizballah is benefiting from the emerging sense of chaos in 
the Palestinian territories.  In addition, Hizballah has 
managed to exploit gaps in operational coverage between the 
IDF and security services in the West Bank and Gaza. 
According to Arditi, Hizballah channels its support through 
four main channels:  The Arab Bank, Western Union, smuggling 
across the northern border, and Israeli-Arab citizens whom it 
manages to recruit while on the Hajj or while studying or 
traveling abroad. 
 
------------------------------- 
Strong U.S.-Israeli Cooperation 
On Combating Terror Finance 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Arditi was accompanied in the meeting by advisors Guy 
Sella, who covers C/T technology issues and C/T cooperation 
with the United States; Amnon Zehavi, who covers all other 
international cooperation; and Udi Levi, who is responsible 
for financial aspects of terrorism, both at the NSC and for 
the Mossad.  Asked by Arditi to brief on GOI efforts to 
combat terror finance, Levi praised U.S.-Israeli cooperation 
on this issue, noting that, in his six years of working on 
terror finance, terror finance cooperation had been the best 
during the past 12 months.  Levi was particularly grateful 
for the efforts of Treasury DAS Juan Zarate on this front, 
including at the previous week\'s multilateral meeting on 
terror finance in Paris, at which, according to Levi, the GOI 
had shared a substantial amount of documentation about 
financial flows.  Levi predicted that the European approach 
would change as a result of these interventions.  Meanwhile, 
he said, the U.S. and Israel are also working closely to find 
a solution to financial flows from Saudi Arabia.  \"We\'re on 
the right track,\" he said, forecasting \"dramatic and 
strategic changes\" in the coming months. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
But Problems with the Arab Bank; Western Union 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4. (S) Arditi and Levi were less sanguine about dealing with 
terror finance channeled via the Arab Bank and Western Union. 
 Describing the scope of the problem, Levi said most, if not 
all, of Hizballah\'s transfers to the Territories in the past 
two weeks (which they claimed totaled close to $1 million) 
were made via Western Union.  None of this money, he said, 
was even ostensibly for charitable purposes.  He emphasized 
that the problem goes well beyond the Arab-Israeli context; 
al-Qaeda has also made use of the Arab Bank for financial 
transfers, as did Saddam Hussein.  Asked whether GOI 
representatives had been in touch with Western Union 
officials, Arditi responded that the GOI had not yet taken 
such a step, due to the sensitivities of dealing with a U.S. 
company on such a matter.  He appeared open to doing so under 
the right circumstances, however. 
 
------------------------------- 
Registering Strong Disagreement 
On the Ramallah Operation 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) In response to concerns expressed by the Ambassador 
over the previous week\'s IDF operation against five Ramallah 
branches of the Arab Bank and the Cairo-Amman Bank (reftel), 
Arditi argued that the ends justified the means, exclaiming 
that, \"In the end, we found $9 million -- even we were 
surprised at the magnitude!  The very amount shows how 
important this operation was.\"  In this context, Levi 
asserted that the GOI could prove that every dollar 
confiscated from the 310 bank accounts had been related to 
terror.  Arditi and Levi also argued that PA Finance Minister 
Salam Fayyad\'s inaction when presented in two separate 
instances in the past with actionable information about Hamas 
funds justified the GOI raid on the Ramallah banks.  Arditi 
opined that the operation had been \"inevitable,\" although he 
also noted that PM Sharon had postponed it \"time and again\" 
for reasons that were not specified. 
 
6. (S/NF) Ambassador Kurtzer made clear that the USG 
disagreed fundamentally with the GOI on this issue.  While 
making no excuse for the banks\' involvement in transferring 
funds used to support terrorism, the Ambassador took issue 
with the means employed, emphasizing that it was not 
appropriate to drive APCs up to banks and forcibly seize 
cash.  He stated firmly that these tactics should not be used 
again.  He reminded his interlocutors that there were 
alternative means of blocking terrorists\' access to illegal 
financial flows that were consistent with the rule of law. 
Indeed, a mechanism had been agreed in previous discussions 
between Sharon\'s Chief of Staff and Salam Fayyad; ORCA 
channels were available to convey specific information.  The 
Ambassador said that it was regrettable that the GOI had not 
taken advantage of these channels in this instance. 
 
7. (C) Noting that the PA does not accept that the GOI has 
the right to spend the seized money -- even on improving the 
Palestinian humanitarian situation -- Ambassador Kurtzer 
urged that the GOI should be in touch with Fayyad about how 
to return the money.  Arditi said that the GOI understood the 
negative impact of this kind of operation on Fayyad, but he 
also conceded, in response to the Ambassador\'s question, that 
perhaps the GOI had not fully appreciated the negative impact 
on the United States.  He opined that the GOI could return 
the money to Fayyad, but that it must first find a mechanism 
to ensure that it is not used to support terror.

SUBJECT: U/S LARSON DISCUSSES \"GREATER MIDDLE EAST,\" AN 
ISRAEL-EGYPT QIZ, AND OECD EXPANSION WITH ISRAEL\'S MINISTRY 
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Richard LeBaron for Reasons 1.4 
(B) and (D) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary.  Under Secretary Larson reviewed the 
President\'s \"Greater Middle East\" vision with Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Director General Yoav Biran February 23, 
noting the initiative\'s efforts at promoting democracy, 
expanding education, and increasing economic cooperation. 
Larson suggested to Biran that Israel and Egypt should work 
to \"strike while the iron is hot\" and attempt to reach a deal 
on prospective QIZs within the next few weeks.  The 
opportunity, he cautioned, might slip away.  Biran said the 
GOI would send representatives to Egypt in early March to try 
to reach a deal.  Larson also discussed the latest state of 
play regarding OECD expansion.  He said the U.S. believed the 
OECD needed to reform before it could expand, but advised the 
GOI to \"be ready\" in case momentum builds for expansion.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------- 
Greater Middle East 
------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Under Secretary Larson reviewed the main components 
of the \"Greater Middle East\" vision, including promoting 
democracy and good governance, expanding educational 
opportunities and expanding economic opportunities.  Larson 
highlighted the economic aspects of the GME vision, noting 
the initiative\'s focus on trade and on financial reform. He 
said the USG\'s recent success with Mexico in allowing more 
access for U.S. programs (including the Peace Corps and 
OPIC), might serve as a model for how to fight poverty and 
increase business activity in the Middle East.  Larson noted 
that a Canadian initiative to involve the private sector in 
the fight against poverty worldwide was very promising.  He 
said the USG wanted to once again explore the concept of a 
regional development bank.  Biran said that the Europeans 
seemed quite interested in participating in the development 
of the GME vision and were already engaged on financial and 
trade initiatives through the Barcelona process.  He stressed 
that Israel was also keen to play a part in the GME 
initiative. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Regional Trade and an Israel-Egypt QIZ 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C)  In response to a question from Biran, U/S Larson 
touched on trade initiatives in the region, such as Saudi 
Arabia\'s interest in joining the WTO, and USG progress in 
negotiating free trade agreements with Morocco and Bahrain. 
A functioning Israel-Egypt QIZ, he continued, would also 
promote regional cooperation.  He said, after delays of many 
years, the Government of Egypt had finally come around, and 
was anxious to reach a deal.  Larson said the terms of the 
QIZ agreement were up to the two parties, but advised the GOI 
to \"strike while the iron is hot\" and try hard to reach a 
deal now.  Larson said he would offer the same advice to the 
GOE during his visit to Cairo.  Biran replied that Israel 
wanted to reach an agreement, but it needed to make economic 
sense.  The Egyptians, he said, were fixated on receiving the 
same terms (8% Israeli content) as Jordan.  That, he 
insisted, was not reasonable, since the 8% content provision 
only went into effect years after the original Israel-Jordan 
QIZ agreement was signed.  Likewise, Biran continued, the 
initial Israeli content requirement in an Israel-Egypt 
agreement should be over 8%, but could possibly be reduced 
later.  In addition, the GOI wanted a \"trilateral agreement\" 
with Egypt and the U.S., not a mechanism where Egypt and 
Israel have \"parallel agreements\" with the U.S. 
 
---------------- 
OECD Enlargement 
---------------- 
 
4.  (C)  U/S Larson reviewed the status of OECD enlargement, 
arguing that the OECD needed to undergo reform before 
effective expansion could take place.  He said that the U.S. 
supported Israel\'s entry into the OECD, but enlargement was 
unlikely to take place this year.  Nevertheless, Israel needs 
to be ready, in case momentum on enlargement builds more 
quickly than expected.  Israel is doing the right things to 
get ready, he noted, such as joining in the activities of as 
many committees as possible. 
 
---------------- 
Iran and the WTO 
---------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Biran concluded the meeting by reiterating Israel\'s 
opposition to Iran\'s bid to join the WTO.  He said that Iran 
must be held to all WTO criteria, including a commitment not 
to engage in an economic boycott against Israel. 
 
6. (U)  This message was cleared by Under Secretary Larson.

2004 JEDG 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 1033 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reason 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
 
 
 1.  (C)  Summary.  The U.S. delegation to the 2004 
U.S.-Israel Joint Economic Development Group meeting in 
Jerusalem (JEDG), led by Under Secretary Larson and Treasury 
Under Secretary Taylor, expressed satisfaction with the steps 
the Government of Israel has taken to implement the 
government\'s economic reform plan.  The JEDG endorsed the 
release of the 2004 tranche of loan guarantees (up to $3 
billion), noting that the GOI had met its commitments under 
the terms of the U.S.-Israel Loan Guarantee Agreement (LGA). 
Although the U.S. team praised the GOI for meeting the 2003 
expenditure targets outlined in the LGA 2003 terms sheet, it 
urged heightened vigilance in meeting the GOI\'s expenditure 
and deficit targets in 2004. 
 
2.  (C)  The U.S. and Israeli JEDG delegations drafted a new 
terms sheet detailing LGA commitments for 2005 (text in para. 
19).  This terms sheet will be annexed to the agreement 
pending approval by Minister Netanyahu.  Especially notable 
is a commitment to meet expenditure targets in 2004 and to 
limit real expenditure growth to 1% per year from 2005-2010. 
Finance Minister Netanyahu said the only circumstances 
wherein Israel might miss the spending commitments were 
related to extraordinary costs associated with a Gaza 
withdrawal or an emergency plan to revamp Israel\'s education 
system.  The draft LGA terms sheet outlines new planned 
reforms, including restructuring Israel\'s financial sector, 
ports and electricity markets, as well as continued 
privatization efforts.  It also stresses the importance of 
intellectual property protection and notes the need to 
resolve procurement problems affecting U.S. companies doing 
business in Israel.  Other issues discussed at the JEDG and 
in related meetings with GOI officials included: 
-- the \"Land Bridge\" between Eilat and the Mediterranean, 
which Netanyahu said would cost $500 million and provide an 
alternative to the Suez Canal for cargo shipping.  (Note: 
Netanyahu did not ask for U.S. financial support and none was 
offered by the U.S. side); 
-- an update on Israel\'s improved growth prospects and 
pension reforms; 
-- a U.S. call for heightened GOI steps to improve the 
Palestinian economy; 
-- Israel\'s request for U.S. support regarding OECD 
accession, an issue which U/S Larson said involved reform of 
the organization\'s organizational structure as a prerequisite; 
-- a review of Bank of Israel (BOI) monetary policy by 
Governor Klein; 
-- a U.S. call for cooperation between the BOI and the 
Palestinian Monetary Authority, which Klein said he welcomed. 
 End summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Meeting with Finance Minister 
Netanyahu - Expenditures and Tax Cuts 
------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  In a small-group meeting to kick-off the JEDG on 
February 23, Netanyahu reviewed the main goals of Israel\'s 
economic plan: 
 
--freezing government expenditures; 
 
--using excess revenues to lower taxes and the deficit; 
 
--moving from welfare to work; 
 
--stimulating exports; 
 
--breaking monopolies; and 
 
--building infrastructure. 
 
The Minister said his recent decision to cut Israel\'s 
value-added tax from 18% to 17% and reduce purchase taxes on 
consumer durables was meant to help Israel\'s poor, since most 
of the economic reform program was \"skewed to the top\" (i.e., 
tended to benefit middle and upper income Israelis).  This 
move, he said, was also consistent with his desire to cut 
both taxes and government spending and was affordable in 
light of expectations that 2004 revenues would come in above 
previous estimates.  Netanyahu said he hoped to devote about 
half of any such excess revenue to deficit reduction and 
about half to tax cuts.  Netanyahu said Israel would 
definitely keep to its 2004 expenditure commitment of NIS 226 
billion, as it had in 2003, as well as to a budget deficit 
target of 4%.  Exceptions to this policy would be allowed 
only if major, exceptional events forced the GOI\'s hands. 
Such events might include withdrawal from Gaza, unforeseen 
defense needs, and/or a major restructuring of Israel\'s 
education system, an issue currently being discussed in the 
government.  This reform would result in lay-offs of many 
under-performing teachers and would costs hundreds of 
millions of shekels, he said.  U/S Larson noted that, in view 
of these potential expenditures, the GOI might be 
well-advised to dedicate a higher portion of unforeseen tax 
revenues to deficit reduction.  Netanyahu took this 
suggestion on board.  Turning briefly to economic prospects, 
the Minister noted that world growth was likely to boost 
Israel\'s export-led recovery.  He specifically mentioned the 
BOI\'s interest rate reduction policy as likely to promote 
economic growth. 
 
----------------------- 
Structural Reform Goals 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Netanyahu said the government would focus on four 
structural reforms in the coming year: 
 
--restructuring Israel\'s inefficient ports, 
 
--increasing competition in the financial markets, 
 
--real estate reform, and 
 
--easing red-tape and regulations that impede economic 
development. 
 
The port reform, said Netanyahu, would almost certainly lead 
to labor conflict - possibly as early as late February. But, 
he continued, \"reform has to be done, no matter what the 
cost.\"  He furthermore noted that \"the measure of a minister 
is his ability to fight the unions.\"  He said the GOI would 
sell the port of Eilat, and would allow the Haifa and Ashdod 
ports to compete with each other on price and service.  The 
two latter ports, he explained, would each be a separate 
company, with 51% government-ownership and the remainder sold 
off to private investors.  The Minister of Transportation, 
Avigdor Lieberman, is fully supportive of the effort, he said. 
 
5.  (C)  Netanyahu said that MOF Director General Yossi 
Bachar would lead an effort to create more competition in the 
financial markets by increasing transparency, adding new 
financial instruments, and reducing the strangle hold on the 
banking sector held by Israel\'s two largest banks - Hapoalim 
and Leumi.  He said the privatization of Discount Bank would 
be a big part of that effort.  He welcomed foreign banks into 
Israel as a way to increase competition.  Real estate reform 
will be very difficult to implement, given the power held by 
the Israel Lands Authority, but Netanyahu said he would try 
to make changes.  The Minister characterized the current land 
system, wherein 93% of land is state-owned (long lease 
contracts), as combining the worst elements of Ottoman, 
British, and Israeli bureaucracies.  He noted that there were 
currently three overlapping land planning systems - the 
local, regional and national planning boards.  One of these 
three planning boards, he said, must be eliminated to cut 
back on red tape.  In fact, unnecessary regulation in many 
areas has held the economy back: \"we need to move to a 
culture of regulation by exception.\"  To change the 
regulatory culture, he said, was one of his largest and most 
difficult challenges.  The Minister said the GOI was looking 
at Britain\'s regulatory reform as a possible model for GOI 
action. 
 
--------------- 
The Land Bridge 
--------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Minister Netanyahu reviewed some of Israel\'s 
transportation initiatives, but focused on the proposed rail 
link between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.  He estimated 
the total cost of this \"Land Bridge\" at USD 500 million.  A 
rail link between the center of the country and Eilat was 
\"definitely going to happen,\" he said.  This link would set 
the stage for creating a rail-based cargo link between Eilat 
and Israel\'s Mediterranean ports that would provide shippers 
an alternative (if much smaller capacity) route to that of 
the Suez Canal.  Preliminary studies by a consulting firm 
looking into the project had determined, he said, that the 
best port to serve as the Red Sea terminal would be Eilat, 
not Aqaba.  Despite this surprising finding, Netanyahu said 
he continued to believe that Aqaba should be the terminus, 
because it was important to bring Jordan into the project and 
make it beneficial for the entire region.  He mentioned 
several other projects which could be combined with the 
\"land-bridge,\" including an amusement park and casinos on the 
Jordan-Israel border.  Netanyahu said that no final decision 
had been made on the project, but that PM Sharon might 
discuss it with President Bush in his upcoming trip to 
Washington.  (Note: As reftel notes, Embassy sources in the 
PMO discount the likelihood of the PM raising this issue in 
Washington.) 
 
--------------- 
Business Issues 
--------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Under Secretary Larson raised three business issues 
with Netanyahu, noting that he and Under Secretary Taylor had 
met with the representatives of U.S. firms just before their 
meeting with the minister.  U/S Larson expressed concern that 
proprietary pharmaceutical data was not protected in Israel, 
that the bilateral agricultural agreement remains unsigned, 
and that U.S. firms often feel they are not given a fair shot 
at government and parastatal procurement.  In reaction to the 
data issue, Netanyahu turned to his Director General and said 
\"This data isn\'t protected?  That\'s a dirty trick!  We need 
to fix this.\"  On agriculture, Larson stressed this issue had 
come to the attention of the Chairman of the House Ways and 
Means Committee, and that there was no reason it should take 
so long to conclude a reasonable agreement.  The Minister 
promised to look into this and into procurement issues. 
 
-------- 
The JEDG 
-------- 
 
8.  (C)  The formal session of the JEDG covered Israel\'s 
economic growth prospects, budgetary issues, Israel and the 
OECD, and ways in which Israel could help the Palestinian 
economy.  On the economy, the MoF\'s Research Director said 
that a number of factors are pointing in the direction of 
strengthened Israeli growth.  These include the global 
economic recovery, which is absorbing increased quantities of 
Israeli exports; decreasing Israeli interest rates; and 
continued improvements in Israeli productivity.  These 
factors have led the MoF to increase its predicted 2004 
growth figure from 2.5% to 3% or more.  The GOI was also 
taking steps to increase Israel\'s labor participation rate, 
through measures aimed at making work more attractive.  In 
this regard, he expressed concern at suggestions aimed at 
increasing Palestinian employment in the Israeli economy. 
Although this was a laudable goal, employment in sectors such 
as construction came directly at the cost of Israeli 
employment.  Rather, the GOI should focus its efforts on 
increasing Palestinian employment in tradable goods sectors, 
where the employment pie could grow and accommodate both 
increased Israeli and Palestinian participation. 
 
9.  (C)  The budget discussion focused on establishing a 
mutually-acceptable definition of expenditures.  Both Under 
Secretaries said the USG required a detailed explanation of 
 
SIPDIS 
the NIS 228 billion expenditure figure for 2003 referred to 
by Minister Netanyahu.  MoF DG Bachar promised to provide 
whatever information the USG required.  He furthermore 
confirmed that the GOI uses this number as the basis of its 
new budgetary legislation limiting expenditure growth to 2010 
to 1% a year in real terms.  (Note: In subsequent, 
staff-level meetings with GOI budget experts, the USG side 
outlined exactly what information it required for reference 
in the terms sheet and received a promise that this 
information would be provided promptly.  End Note.) 
 
10.  (C)  The GOI officials also outlined pension reform and 
privatization programs. On pension reform, the Commissioner 
of Capital Markets, Insurance and Savings, Eyal Ben-Chlouch, 
highlighted the increase in the retirement age, 
contributions, and the amount of funds to be directed to the 
capital markets.  The Director of the Israel Government 
Companies Authority, Eyal Gabbai, outlined achievements in 
privatization including the successful El Al IPO, the sale of 
majority ownership in Bezeq (telephones) and Zim (shipping), 
and the plan to introduce more competition in the electricity 
sector.  There was also a brief discussion of monetary policy 
by the Bank of Israel\'s Deputy Governor, in which the current 
low-inflation environment and recent reductions in both short 
and long-term interest rates were highlighted. 
 
11.  (C)  During a JEDG lunch hosted by Finance Ministry 
Minister without Portfolio Meir Sheetrit, Under Secretaries 
Larson and Taylor noted GOI efforts to improve Palestinian 
economic conditions and urged it to do more.  Under Secretary 
Larson noted the importance of the GOI continuing its 
transfers of Palestinian tax revenues to the PA, as well as 
addressing the issue of revenue attachments.  Under Secretary 
Taylor cited the importance of reducing impediments to the 
free movement of goods and people within the West Bank and 
Gaza.  Both officials noted they had pushed PA officials hard 
to improve performance in fighting terror, but also urged the 
GOI to think about constructive ways it could respond to 
positive PA moves should such occur.  Sheetrit did not 
respond directly to these concerns, but rather stressed ways 
in which the Palestinians had undermined the peace process. 
He expressed his strong personal opposition to PM Sharon\'s 
ideas on unilateral disengagement, noting the issue could 
break up the coalition while bringing little or no 
improvement in security.  In response to Sheetrit\'s statement 
that the best solution would be to \"kill Yassir Arafat,\" 
Under Secretary Larson pushed back strongly, noting there was 
no way Israel could predict the consequences such an act 
could have.  Sheetrit said he recognized Israel could take no 
steps against Arafat. 
 
12.  (C)  Sheetrit urged the U.S. to support Israeli 
accession to the OECD.  Under Secretary Larson said the U.S. 
wanted to enhance Israel\'s relationship with the OECD, but 
noted the complicated state-of-play on OECD enlargement. 
Before the organization increased its size, it was essential 
it implement extensive institutional reform aimed at 
streamlined decision making.  He also noted that the 
composition of the next enlargement required extensive 
groundwork aimed at assuring regional balance in the 
organization.  In the meantime, he urged the GOI to continue 
its efforts to work in whatever ways possible with OECD 
bodies.

BOI Governor Klein Gives Netanyahu A Passing Grade 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
14.  (C)  In a meeting held after the conclusion of the JEDG, 
Bank of Israel Governor Klein reviewed GOI fiscal and 
monetary policy with U/S Larson and U/S Taylor.  He said that 
the Bank had been able to bring down short-term rates 
relatively quickly - from 9.1% in the beginning of 2003 to 
4.5% a year later - without igniting inflation.   Markets had 
responded very positively, he said, to the fiscal restraint 
shown by the GOI, and long-term rates had also dropped. 
Finance Minister Netanyahu, he said, had convinced the 
markets that he is serious about economic reform, no small 
achievement. Klein expressed skepticism, however, about the 
government\'s ability to hold to a 1% per year expenditure 
increase until 2010, as stated in the JEDG.  Such a 
commitment, which would require cuts in per capita spending 
every year, will be very hard to keep, he said.  Klein also 
said that cutting taxes was no substitute for keeping 
spending in check.  It is sometimes stated that the best way 
to control spending is to cut taxes (and so make less money 
available to the government).  That is not true in Israel, he 
emphasized.  Strict spending commitments are the only way to 
keep budgets under control. 
 
15. (C)  The government\'s newfound fiscal responsibility, 
continued Klein, remains constantly under pressure.  He 
recounted a recent conversation with the Minister of Health 
(Danny Naveh), in which the minister asked him how could it 
be that acceding to a NIS 500 million increase the ministry 
was asking for would really threaten the Israeli economy. 
Klein responded by saying that the notion that \"small 
deviations\" were acceptable was precisely how Israel\'s public 
sector grew to be \"the largest in the world.\"  Markets, 
continued Klein, were a little nervous about the Bank of 
Israel\'s willingness to continue reducing interest rates in 
light of spending pressures.  In fact, long-term rates had 
risen in recent weeks, a sign that the markets are unsure the 
Bank will keep reducing short-term rates.  Klein made it 
clear, however, that he believed there was still some room 
for further rate cuts while keeping within the 1-3% inflation 
target for 2004.  He noted that rate would be cut later on 
February 23 (BOI cut the interest rate by 0.2% to 4.3%). 
Klein said that BOI\'s rates, after the pending cut, would be 
very close to rates in some European countries and noted that 
interest rates in the UK were at 4%. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Central Bank Regional Cooperation 
--------------------------------- 
 
16.  (C)  Klein said the recent meeting of central bankers 
from the Mediterranean region in Naples was unprecedented. He 
noted that he had talked to the central bank governors of 
Morocco, Egypt, Libya and the PA, among others, during the 
meetings.  Klein said there was plenty of issues of common 
interest to talk about in meetings like this, no matter what 
the political differences between the countries represented. 
Possible topics might include, he said, central bank 
independence, and the various stages of capital market 
development.  In response to a question from U/S Taylor, 
Klein said he would be happy to work with Amin Haddad, 
Governor of the Palestinian Monetary Authority, to help 
further cooperation on terrorist financing. This was an 
issue, he said, that he and Haddad had discussed in Naples. 
 
---------------------- 
Comment and Next Steps 
---------------------- 
 
17.  (C)  This JEDG accomplished a number of important goals. 
 It recognized Minister Netanyahu\'s and the GOI\'s significant 
progress on economic reform over the past year while urging 
continued fiscal restraint, and did so both in private and in 
a number of press appearances.  The meeting also underlined 
the close attention the USG is paying to the GOI\'s budget and 
how it is calculated.  The draft 2004 terms sheet 
incorporates the issue of restraining GOI expenditures and 
meeting its deficit target for 2004. 
 
18.  (C) According to our MoF contacts, Minister Netanyahu is 
now reviewing the terms sheet draft and will respond to it as 
soon as possible. 
 
---------------------- 
Draft 2004 Terms Sheet 
---------------------- 
19.  (C)  Modifications to and Determinations of Specific 
Reforms Details in Annex II of the Loan Guarantee Commitment 
Agreement 
The Joint Economic Development Group (JEDG), as the joint 
consultative mechanism referred to in Section 5.03 of the 
Loan Guarantee Commitment Agreement, and proceeding under 
Section 4.02 of the Loan Guarantee Commitment Agreement, 
determines and modifies the &specific reforms8 referred to 
in Section 4.02 by appending the following as Appendix 4 of 
Annex II. 
 
CONDITIONS FOR DISBURSEMENT OF THE SECOND TRANCHE OF 
SUPPLEMENTAL ASSISTANCE 
 
The second tranche of bond guarantees in the amount of up to 
$3.0 billion will be released on determination of completion 
of the following: 
 
1.  Progress on Reform Plan: Progress on the main measures of 
the GOI economic reform plan.  This plan includes, among 
other things, reforms related to: 
-- Acceleration of tax reform: Continued progress on final 
implementation of tax reforms (legislated in the Knesset in 
2002) by January, 2006; 
-- Pension Reform: Continued long-term reduction in issuance 
of special government bonds for pension funds; 
-- Wage reforms: Continued reduction of public sector\'s 
budgetary expense on the wage bill as a percentage of GDP, to 
be achieved by cutting wages and/or benefits and/or reducing 
public sector employees. 
 
2.  Meet Spending and Budget Deficit Targets 
-- Commit to expenditures (defined in Appendix X) in 2004 of 
no more than 226.1 billion New Israeli Shekels, with the firm 
goal of keeping the budget deficit to 4.0 percent of GDP or 
less. 
 
-- Public dissemination and GOI commitment to a detailed, 
multi-year fiscal plan, including a commitment to limit real 
expenditure growth (defined in Appendix X) to 1 percent per 
year from 2005 to 2010.  Furthermore, commitment to maintain 
budget deficits to a level of less than 3 percent of GDP and 
aim to implement further reductions in the operational 
deficit of at least 0.5 percent of GDP every year until the 
deficit reaches 1 percent of GDP. 
 
-- Any revenues in excess of those foreseen in the 2004 
budget would be allocated to deficit and tax reduction.  Due 
emphasis should be given to deficit reduction. 
 
3.  Proceed with Privatization Plan 
-- Further progress on the main measures of the Israeli 
government\'s privatization plan.  Future privatization steps 
should focus on the twin goals of increasing competition as 
well as reducing government involvement in the economy. 
 
4.  Implement Structural Reforms 
-- Increase competition in the economy by: 
A. Implementing liberalization of the domestic 
telecommunications market through a regulatory environment 
that facilitates the introduction of competitive local 
landline services within the timeframe of this agreement; 
B. Working to increase competition within the ports, 
financial markets, and electricity sectors; 
C. Reduce governmental regulation with the aim of promoting 
economic growth. 
-- Continue efforts to further strengthen IPR protection in 
Israel. 
 
5.  Undertake Infrastructure Investments 
-- Commitment to, and progress on $1 billion in 
infrastructure spending as discussed in the GOI,s economic 
reform plan. 
 
6.  Other 
-- The amount of guarantees that may be issued shall be 
reduced by an amount equal to the amount extended or 
estimated to have been extended by the GOI during the period 
from the last deduction to the date of issue of the 2004 
guarantee, for activities which the President determines are 
inconsistent with the objectives and understandings reached 
between the United States and the Government of Israel 
regarding implementation of the loan guarantee program. 
-- Commit to working with the U.S. Government to resolve 
outstanding procurement issues. 
SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENTS 
 
Subsequent disbursements of bond guarantees will be 
conditioned upon determination and implementation of the 
GOI,s macroeconomic, structural and other targets developed 
through the USG-GOI joint consultative mechanism.  Fiscal 
deficit targets and implementation of the reform plan will be 
the main foci.  In particular, disbursements of the third 
tranche of bond guarantees will be conditioned on achievement 
of the spending and budget deficit targets for 2004 and 2005. 
 The extent to which other commitments made for the 2004 
disbursement are met will also be an important consideration. 
 
20. (U)  This message was cleared by Under Secretaries Larson 
and Taylor.

2.  Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media led with the investigation of Elchanan 
Tenenbaum and the fallout from Maariv\'s revelations 
about PM Sharon\'s alleged connection with Tenenbaum\'s 
family. 
-In interviews to all TV stations and other media, 
Sharon reiterated that he had been unaware that 
Tenenbaum is the former son-in-law of his former 
business partner Shimon Cohen.  Sharon was quoted as 
saying that Maariv\'s expose is a \"malicious libel.\" 
Israel Radio quoted staff members in Sharon\'s bureau 
that it could have been a ploy by right-wing elements 
to thwart his diplomatic moves. 
-All media cited strong reactions to Maariv\'s 
revelations on the Right and on the Left.  Cabinet 
ministers close to Sharon, such as Ehud Olmert and 
Limor Livnat, defended Sharon in media interviews and 
opinion pieces. 
-All media reported that the lie detector tests to 
which Tenenbaum was submitted indicated that he spoke 
the truth on most questions he was asked. 
 
Jerusalem Post and Israel Radio reported that Stephen 
Hadley and Elliott Abrams from the White House and 
William Burns from the State Department will visit 
Israel next week to continue discussions on Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan.  Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post quoted 
National Security Council Spokesman Sean McCormack as 
saying that the plan has the \"potential to be 
historic.\"  Reporting on talks the Israeli diplomatic 
team held in Washington with White House and State 
Department officials, Ha\'aretz (Aluf Benn) says that 
Israel and the U.S. are considering the removal of PA 
Chairman Yasser Arafat through the disengagement plan. 
The Israeli officials believe the plan is welcomed by 
the young PA leadership, and opposed by Arafat. 
 
All media reported that Wednesday three Gazan activists 
from the Hamas military wing who were apparently trying 
to gather intelligence in the Netzarim area were killed 
when an IDF helicopter fired a missile at their car. 
Maariv and Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli security 
officials as saying that the man responsible for 
dispatching a female suicide bomber to the Erez 
crossing in mid-January was among them.  The police 
declared the highest state of alert throughout the 
entire country in advance of the Purim holiday, which 
will take place during the weekend. 
Ha\'aretz cited a report by the European Institute for 
Research on the Middle East that Britain and other 
European states gave the Palestinians more than 20 
million euros (around USD 25 million) to pay for legal 
and information consultation.  [NB: The institute is an 
independent, non-governmental organization created to 
examine relations between the EU and the Middle East.] 
Ha\'aretz also quoted British and Palestinian sources as 
saying that Britain has agreed to finance new operation 
centers for the PA police in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip.  The newspaper quoted Israeli defense sources as 
saying that the British aid aims to strengthen the 
Palestinian police in the territories and is part of 
its support for Palestinian bodies acting against 
terrorist organizations. 
 
Channel 2-TV reported Wednesday that Arafat has 
dispatched a Palestinian official to explore the 
possibility of being buried on the Temple Mount, close 
to the graves of the Husseini family to which he 
belongs.  The station reported that the extremist 
Muslim Palestinian group Tahrir has strongly come out 
against the proposal. 
 
All media reported that Wednesday the Haifa District 
Court sentenced three Israeli-Arab youths from Kafr 
Manda in the lower Galilee to jail terms of between 14 
and 20 years for planning terrorist attacks in the 
north of the country.  The intended attacks had not 
been carried out, but the judges said they took their 
gravity into account.  This morning, Israel Radio and 
IDF Radio reported that the same court indicted two 
Israeli-Arab brothers for allegedly having been 
recruited by the Abu Moussa faction of Hizbullah, 
serving as couriers, and passing on training material 
and operational instructions to members of the Tanzim- 
Fatah infrastructure in Jenin. 
 
All media reported that Wednesday Justice Dalia Dorner, 
the outgoing head of the Central Elections Committee, 
ruled that the next general elections should be held in 
November 2007 and not in 2006.  She admitted that her 
verdict is \"but a corridor\" to an expected High Court 
of Justice decision. 
 
Yediot reported that the water-supply agreement with 
Turkey will be signed today. The accord stipulates that 
Turkey will sell 375 million cubic meters of water to 
Israel over a 20-year period. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Yediot quoted an Immigration Police 
official as saying that his organization will soon 
begin using a computerized system to compile 
information used to identify and track foreign workers 
in Israel. 
Yediot reported that Wednesday the Prime Minister\'s 
Office approved a \"grandiose\" plan to transfer its 
offices and the prime minister\'s official residence to 
a new \"White House-style\" compound that should be 
completed by 2009. 
 
A poll conducted by Maariv/New Wave found that: 
-47 percent of Israelis believe that Sharon knew about 
the Tenenbaum-Cohen family connection; 26 percent 
believe that Sharon was unaware of it; 27 percent are 
undecided. 
-42 percent believe that the fact that Sharon had a 
business connection with Tenenbaum\'s family influenced 
his decision to carry out the prisoner exchange; 41 
percent do not believe so; 17 percent are undecided. 
-43 percent of respondents believe that Sharon should 
not resign if he knew about the Tenenbaum-Cohen 
connection; 42 percent believe that Sharon should 
resign in that case; 15 percent are undecided.

investigation is needed.\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of mass-

should complain.\"

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Test of Credibility and Judgment\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (March 
4): \"Prime Minister Ariel Sharon Wednesday denied that 
extraneous interests, including a special personal 
interest in Elchanan Tenenbaum, influenced him while he 
was pressing the government to approve a deal to free 
hundreds of Palestinian and other prisoners for the 
return of Tenenbaum and the bodies of three soldiers 
killed when they were captured by Hizbullah.... The 
government failed in its duty as the supreme authority 
responsible for such decisions in the State of Israel, 
as a group of ministers with shared responsibility, and 
not the Prime Minister alone, or him and a handful of 
ministers alongside him, as in cases of war cabinets or 
emergencies requiring immediate decisions.... A 
comprehensive investigation is needed into the way 
information was handled, the staff work and the 
decision-making in the Tenenbaum affair.  It would be 
best that the investigation not be conducted in a 
political framework, like the Knesset Foreign Affairs 
and Defense Committee, but in the skilled hands of the 
State Comptroller\'s Office and its branch for security 
matters.\" 
 
II.  \"The Mountain and the Molehill\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (March 4): 
\"Sharon came by this onslaught honestly.  First, 
because he and his sons have made the two words \'I 
didn\'t know\' into a family creed.  It is hard to 
respect the innocence of a person who doesn\'t know what 
is the source of millions of dollars that go in and out 
of his house.  Now, when it appears, ostensibly, that 
Sharon truly didn\'t know, many find it hard to believe 
him.  The main political factor today undermining 
Sharon\'s credibility is the settlers.  They have an 
existential interest in sabotaging his unilateral 
withdrawal plan.  Their agents will do anything -- 
except for using weapons -- to topple him.  If they can 
stick him with a dubious tie to Tenenbaum, they would 
consider this to be a great success.  This too Sharon 
came by honestly.  For years he built them up -- and 
they him.  He knows their tricks very well: some of 
them he invented himself.  Now, when he has turned 
against them and they use the same methods against him, 
he is the last one who should complain.\" 
 
III.  \"Is It Reasonable?\" 
 
Editor-in-Chief Amnon Dankner wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (March 4): \"It is ... no secret that 
the owners of this paper are among Sharon\'s close 
friends.  In spite of this, the facts were reported 
because of their public importance and nothing could be 
more honorable, since professional and journalistic 
considerations are our only guide.... Ultimately, this 
story is a story of trust, of probability and of a 
whirlwind in which facts and feelings spin together. 
This is also a question of the public\'s feelings.  In 
the 2001 elections, the public sent Ehud Barak home 
because it felt like a sucker upon seeing the 
Palestinians getting proposals that were far-reaching 
in their generosity from the prime minister and getting 
the Intifada in return.  Today the public feels like a 
sucker as more repulsive details emerge on redeemed 
captive and controversial Elchanan Tenenbaum.  But the 
public at large continues, at this stage, to believe 
that there is no alternative to Ariel Sharon yet and 
that is why some Israelis will continue not to believe 
Sharon but will continue to support him as long as 
there is no other option.\" 
 
IV.  \"Government Under a Heavy Cloud of Suspicion\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (March 4): 
\"No one can believe that the acquaintance between the 
Sharon and the Cohen-Tenenbaum families did not come up 
in the course of the negotiations for the release of 
the prisoners from Hizbullah captivity.... In an 
atmosphere of heavy suspicion about criminal behavior 
by the Prime Minister; in an atmosphere of heavy 
suspicion that he is being blackmailed by the Austrian 
government; in an atmosphere of heavy suspicion about 
the prisoner exchange deal that was secured under foul 
smelling circumstances -- it behooves the Prime 
Minister to resign immediately.  His conduct regarding 
the unilateral disengagement, which will entail the 
expulsion of the Jews from Katif [in the Gaza Strip], 
also appears to be insane when one considers the Prime 
Minister\'s actions from the past both distant and near. 
Does this not oblige the coalition to suspect that in 
this case too something foul, something very foul is 
lying in concealment but is destined yet to be 
exposed?\"

------------ 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"Internationalizing 
the solution would free the sides from conflict with 
their respective national ethos.... The current 
international constellation offers Israel a ripe moment 
for just such an arrangement, with the world being run 
by a single friendly superpower.\" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot: \"An Israeli unilateral withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip must be a complete and absolute severance 
from this piece of land, a divorce.\" 
Foreign News Editor Shmuel Rosner wrote on page one of 
Ha\'aretz: \"Kerry has always promised a special envoy 
for the peace process.  In fact, this is his only 
practical promise [in this domain], and even that idea 
has developed in contradictory directions.\" 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"It\'s Time to Internationalize the Solution\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (March 4): \"Sharon 
wants to give up the ethos of \'settlement throughout 
all of the Land of Israel\' to buy some quiet.  But like 
Ehud Barak, he\'ll find out that the Palestinians don\'t 
give up something for nothing.... Internationalizing 
the solution would free the sides from conflict with 
their respective national ethos.  In their name, the 
superpowers would give up \'the right of return\' and 
\'Judea and Samaria\' and would also have to give up 
their own contribution to fanning the flames of the 
conflict.... The current international constellation 
offers Israel a ripe moment for just such an 
arrangement, with the world being run by a single 
friendly superpower.  Thus, perhaps, the conclusions of 
the [1937] Peel Commission can be fulfilled, in which 
even if the partition does not offer the Jews and Arabs 
\'all they want, it offers each what it wants most, 
namely freedom and security.\'\" 
 
II.  \"Cut Off From Gaza Completely\" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot (March 4): \"The army correctly argues that 
withdrawing from Philadelphi [the narrow route along 
the Gaza/Egyptian border] will make it possible to 
smuggle in Katyusha rockets that will threaten 
Ashkelon. But the army also knows that weapon smuggling 
will not stop in any case, that this road by itself 
cannot put a stop to the phenomenon.... Israel\'s 
supreme interest in withdrawing from the Philadelphi 
road is evident by Egypt\'s panicky reaction to the 
idea.  The Egyptians know that the moment that the IDF 
leaves the road and no longer is a buffer between them 
and the Palestinians, this hot potato will fall into 
their laps.  Just like before 1967, they will bear all 
the responsibility, toward Israel, toward the U.S. and 
toward the entire world if there is terror from Gaza at 
Israel using weapons smuggled from Egypt.... An Israeli 
unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip must be a 
complete and absolute severance from this piece of 
land, a divorce.  The border with Gaza must be 
completely closed: no workers, no factories, no shared 
industrial zones, no civilian responsibility and no 
settlements.  Those who will have to face the Gaza 
Strip will be their Arab brothers, and that way, 
finally, the Arab world can do its part in contributing 
to the welfare and livelihood of the Palestinians, the 
people it has been so concerned about for the last 
three and a half years.  Who can object to such an 
absolute detachment by Israel?  After all, this is what 
the Palestinians, the Egyptians and the world have been 
demanding for decades.\" 
 
III.  \"Kerry and Israel: Like Clinton, But Less 
Emotionally\" 
 
Foreign News Editor Shmuel Rosner wrote on page one of 
Ha\'aretz (March 4): \"John Kerry is no big fan of 
Sharon.... But ... a few weeks ago ... he 
unhesitatingly said: \'I believe that Sharon is prepared 
to make peace\'.... Kerry also said that he understood 
the reasons for building the separation \'fence\'.  He 
sounded like someone who believes that the U.S. 
shouldn\'t oppose its erection -- provided its route 
more or less coincides with the Green Line.... His 
adversaries say that he is fickle and that he adapts 
himself to fads.  His supporters claim that he 
recognizes that the world is complex.... His principal 
assertion, which he has reiterated many times, is that 
the administration should demonstrate greater 
involvement in efforts to resolve the conflict.... 
There is no agreement about this claim among U.S. 
experts and diplomats.... Kerry has always promised a 
special envoy for the peace process.  In fact, this is 
his only practical promise [in this domain], and even 
that idea has developed in contradictory directions.\"

SUBJECT: RUSSIAN ENVOY LOOKS TO UPCOMING QUARTET MEETING TO 
COORDINATE VIEWS ON DISENGAGEMENT 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
. 
 
1. (C) Russian Special Middle East Envoy Kalugin, just back 
from a trip to Saudi Arabia, told the Ambassador March 3 that 
the Saudis \"made some nice noises\" about working with Arab 
League partners in an effort to recommit to the Beirut Arab 
League declaration, the roadmap, UNSCR 1515 endorsing the 
roadmap, and possibly even making reference to the Geneva 
Initiative.  As far as Kalugin knew, the Saudis were not yet 
circulating a specific draft.  Kalugin noted that his trip to 
Saudi Arabia coincided with that of U/S Larson; Kalugin\'s 
interlocutors told him that, while they were not opposed in 
principle to the Greater Middle East Initiative, as briefed 
to them by Larson, they sought greater clarity about how it 
would be linked to the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  Kalugin, 
who will be in Washington for the March 10 meeting of Quartet 
envoys, indicated that he had been asked to stay on in the 
U.S. to participate in the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister\'s 
March 11-12 talks in preparation for the G-8 summit. 
 
2. (C) Turning to Israeli plans for disengagement, Kalugin, 
who was joined by Russian Ambassador Tarasov, catalogued a 
number of questions that the GOR has about the mechanics of 
and implications arising from Israeli evacuation of the Gaza 
Strip.  For example, would it be carried out in such a way 
that it would not undermine final status negotiations and the 
vision of two states, living side-by-side in peace and 
security?  Would there be any coordination with the 
Palestinians?  What would be the role of the Quartet?  Adding 
to these questions, Kalugin enumerated several that had been 
posed to him by Palestinian Foreign Minister Sha\'ath and 
Negotiations Affairs Minister.  Would it be a full or partial 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip?  Would there be any linkage 
to the West Bank?  How would the border with Egypt be 
secured?  What would be the nature/scale of Israeli responses 
to Hamas-perpetrated terror attacks?  Would Israel be open to 
consulting with the Palestinians on a schedule of 
implementation?  In addition, Sha\'ath reportedly made clear 
that he hoped the PA would be able to assume control of the 
evacuated settlements \"to use them for their purposes.\" 
Erakat was said to claim that the PA was ready to assume 
control of the Strip with \"no problem.\" 
 
3. (C) Ambassador Kurtzer pointed out that the United States 
has posed to the GOI a number of questions -- many of them 
quite similar to those that Kalugin articulated -- but that 
they have not yet been fully answered.  He took issue with 
the underlying assumptions of some of the Palestinian 
questions, however, commenting that the Israelis have made 
clear their strong opposition to engaging in negotiations 
with the Palestinians over Israel\'s unilateral moves, since 
the impetus of unilateral disengagement was the absence of 
progress on the negotiations track.  In addition, the 
Ambassador said, the Israelis are adamant that settlements 
would not be handed over to the PA.  Ambassador Tarasov 
cautioned that the Israelis, too, needed to avoid unrealistic 
expectations.  The GOI should be interested in what happens 
the day after they evacuate, and the process is going to 
require some level of coordination with the Palestinians. 
Otherwise, he warned, Israel risks creating chaos.  Tarasov 
and Kalugin made the case that these issues -- and the 
possible Quartet role in dealing with them -- should be taken 
up at the March 10 meeting of Quartet envoys.  Noting that 
various Quartet representatives, including UN envoy Terje 
Larsen, have gone on record independently with reactions to 
the Israeli plan, Tarasov argued that these positions should 
be formally coordinated.

SUBJECT: LIKUD POWER BROKER -- AND REPUTED PARTY BULLY -- 
EYES JORDAN AND A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH 
 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Richard LeBaron for reason 1.4 ( 
b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary and Comment: Likud\'s outspoken rightist 
Central Committee member Uzi Cohen and some of his what could 
only be described as political henchmen presented an 
alternative peace plan to Poloff and Pol/FSN on March 3 
wherein the Palestinians would have their own state -- in a 
carved-out northern portion of Jordan.  Cohen touted Likud\'s 
Central Committee -- with himself as core leader -- as the 
real powerhouse behind Likud policy, and advocated that the 
USG bypass regular GOI channels and meet with Central 
Committee members on peace process issues.  Cohen claimed 
that he received an unofficial \"green light\" from PM Sharon 
to promote his plan, and that Jordan\'s King Abdullah knows 
about the plan and had relayed inquiries about the plan\'s 
details.  Cohen and his colleagues asserted that there is 
support for the plan by a majority in Likud\'s Central 
Committee, in the Knesset and among moderate Israeli Arabs. 
He pressed for a meeting with Ambassador Kurtzer to present 
the plan, and brazenly promised that he would find a way to 
arrange a meeting with President Bush.  Comment: At worst, 
many within Likud and the Israeli public view Cohen as an 
obnoxious thug, who elbows his way into and disrupts Knesset 
meetings, exploits political connections for family favors, 
and panders to the right-wing elements of Likud.  At best, he 
is an unabashed self-promoter.  Sharon may be putting up with 
Cohen\'s shenanigans, but we have no indication that he agrees 
with Cohen\'s approach.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
------------------------- 
Redrawing the Middle East 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Uzi Cohen, Deputy Mayor of Ra\'anna, a Tel Aviv 
suburb, and a powerful right-wing Likud Central Committee 
power broker, along with several colleagues, met with Poloff 
and Pol/FSN March 3 in Cohen\'s small municipal office, 
plastered with photographs of Cohen and prominent Israeli 
political figures.  The meeting was arranged in response to a 
letter Cohen had written to Ambassador Kurtzer requesting a 
meeting to \"brief\" the Ambassador on his \"proposition for a 
peaceful solution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\" 
Joining Cohen were Mark Gal, the author of the \"peace plan;\" 
Dr. Menahem Eldor, an attorney who interpreted for Mr. Cohen; 
and Shlomo Madmon, a hanger-on. (Note: It was obvious during 
the meeting that Eldor took liberties to expound generously 
on what Cohen was saying.  It appeared, however, as Cohen sat 
back comfortably in his chair, that Cohen was confident that 
Eldor would represent him accurately.  End note.) 
 
3.  (C) Cohen\'s plan, entitled \"Three States for Three 
Nations,\" calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state 
\"in a region north of Jordan,\" although the presentation and 
maps actually depicted a region in the northern part of 
Jordan.  According to Gal, the West Bank is too small an area 
to accommodate all of the Palestinian refugees who would 
converge on an independent Palestinian state, as well as the 
expanding population of resident Palestinians.  The area 
proposed in the plan would accommodate a much larger 
population.  According to an amateurish map with hand-printed 
labels illustrating Cohen\'s plan, a large part of northern 
Jordan would be partitioned for the Palestinian state.  A 
handout on the plan stated that \"final borders of said state 
are to be negotiated by Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Saudi 
Arabia.\"  It was not clear whether territory from Iraq would 
also be included.  Palestinians remaining in the West Bank -- 
no mention of Gaza was made -- would have limited autonomy 
under a \"Municipal Palestinian Authority,\" but would be 
\"encouraged\" to emigrate to the Palestinian state.  The 
handout states that, \"the plan would be carried out under the 
auspices of the United States....\" 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Cohen on his Plan: What\'s Not to Like? 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Cohen claimed that a Likud Central Committee majority 
supports the plan.  He claimed that most Central Committee 
members are against the roadmap and that at least 1,000 of 
the 3,000 members had supported his campaign against the 
roadmap before the cabinet had approved it with the 14 
reservations.  Eldor asserted that Cohen could get 70 MKs to 
support the plan.  Cohen noted that he met with FM Silvan 
Shalom four times to discuss the plan.  (Note: Cohen\'s 
brother serves as an assistant to Shalom.  End Note.) 
Shalom, Cohen claimed, told him that Jordan\'s King Abdullah 
is aware of the plan and had \"inquired about its details.\" 
Cohen claimed he met with the head of Jordanian intelligence, 
Mansour, about the plan.  (Note: The head of intelligence in 
Jordan is General Sa\'ad Kheir.  Cohen is most likely 
referring to retired Jordanian General and peace activist 
Mansour Abu Rashid.  End note.)  He said that he sent the 
plan to Labor leader Shimon Peres and is awaiting a meeting 
with him.  He also asked Russian immigrant and MK Natan 
Sharansky to help him set up a meeting with Russian President 
Putin.  When asked what PM Sharon thought about Cohen openly 
and vigorously promoting his own peace plan, Cohen replied 
that Sharon had given him an unofficial \"green light\" to 
promote the plan. 
 
5.  (C) Cohen claimed that the mayor of the Israeli Arab 
village of Taybeh and moderate Israeli Arabs support his plan 
as well, but Cohen could not remember the mayor\'s name. 
Cohen and his colleagues noted that it was difficult to 
debate the plan since it provides for a Palestinian state -- 
an even larger one than the Palestinians would have now. 
Eldor asserted that the idea \"is sound.\"  He suggested that 
the United States be \"a leader in promoting the plan.\" 
 
 
------------------------ 
Uzi: I\'ve Got the Power 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C)  Uzi Cohen and his colleagues repeatedly stressed the 
importance of the Likud Central Committee in determining 
Likud policy and in electing Likud representatives, including 
the prime minister.  Madmon noted that Sharon is not always 
\"in line\" with the Likud rank and file and that the Central 
Committee influences Likud and the public.  Eldor added that 
the Central Committee wields influence on Sharon, the Israeli 
public and even the United States.  Cohen advocated that U.S. 
government officials bypass normal GOI channels and meet with 
members of the Central Committee on peace process issues.  He 
underlined that \"in Israel, politics is different...\" and 
that the United States should start a dialogue with the 
Central Committee, even if only unofficially.  Eldor 
repeatedly turned to Poloff to stress Cohen\'s stature in the 
Central Committee, his influence over members and his 
\"charisma.\"  At one point, Eldor declared that Cohen could 
call any minister any time and receive an appointment the 
next day.  Madmon suggested that Cohen lead a group of 
Central Committee members to meet with President Bush. 
 
--------------------------- 
Who\'s Afraid of Uzi Cohen? 
--------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Aside from U.S. government meetings with the Central 
Committee, Cohen stressed the importance of his meeting with 
U.S. officials, beginning with Ambassador Kurtzer, to discuss 
his plan.  He noted that he was planning to meet with the 
ambassadors from a number of countries.  Eldor said that 
Cohen would like to meet with President Bush.  Cohen produced 
a letter from the PM\'s office responding to his request for 
assistance in arranging for a meeting with the President. 
The PM\'s office politely explained that this was not 
possible.  Eldor asked for Embassy assistance in arranging 
for Cohen to meet the President and, noting \"the type of man\" 
Cohen is, declared that \"by hook or by crook,\" and with or 
without Embassy support, Cohen would see the President. 
Poloff said these requests would be conveyed to the Embassy. 
Cohen stressed that timing was crucial and complained that 
setting up meetings through the proper channels goes slowly. 
As if to highlight competition for President Bush, Cohen 
pointed out that an American colleague had offered to arrange 
a meeting for him with Senator John Kerry, but that Cohen had 
declined.  Cohen asked Poloff if he could issue a press 
release that he had met with U.S. Embassy officials about the 
plan.  Poloff replied she would prefer the meeting not be 
publicized as it was an informal discussion. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) Uzi Cohen is undoubtedly a strong Likud Central 
Committee operator, and, as described by the major daily 
\"Ma\'ariv,\" a Likud \"power broker.\"  He defies conventional 
channels of political debate and has no compunction in 
inserting himself into any and every forum of public 
discussion.  In February, Cohen\'s permanent pass to the 
Knesset was revoked after he reportedly threatened Knesset 
Speaker and Likud member Reuven Rivlin with \"a political 
death certificate.\"  This threat followed Rivlin\'s decision 
to ban Likud Central Committee members from Knesset committee 
debates, complaining that they disrupted the meetings.  Early 
in 2004, Cohen had demanded that he accompany Sharon to meet 
with President Bush.  When the visit did not materialize, it 
appears that Cohen decided to promote his own plan, both in 
the media and in Likud.  Many in Likud and the public at 
large cringe from his tactics and persona.  When Cohen 
accused Rivlin of acting out of revenge in revoking his 
Knesset pass, Rivlin remarked to Ma\'ariv: \"Who is he anyway, 
that I should take revenge on him?  Why should I pay him any 
attention?  He should never have been given a permanent pass 
to begin with.\"  PM Sharon, on the other hand, may benefit 
indirectly from Cohen.  When compared to the likes of Cohen 
and others in Likud\'s Central Committee, Sharon appears 
moderate, reasonable, and benevolent.

SUBJECT: WERTHEIMER APPARENTLY GIVING UP ON \"MARSHALL PLAN\" 
FOR THE MIDDLE EAST 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
\"You Can Lead a Horse to Water....\" 
----------------------------------- 
 
1. (SBU) Israeli industrialist Stef Wertheimer told visiting 
NSC Director Adnan Kifayat and Embassy Econoff on Feb. 24 
that he will no longer seek USG financial assistance for his 
\"New Marshall Plan\" for the Middle East.   Using the phrase 
\"you can lead a horse to water, but you can\'t force him to 
drink\", Wertheimer hinted that he was frustrated at his 
continued inability to secure financial aid from the USG for 
his vision of a series of industrial parks in the poorer Arab 
countries of the region. 
 
2. (SBU) If the USG or the wider international donor 
community decided to promote an idea similar to his own, 
Wertheimer said, he would be willing to act as an advisor. 
He may also be prepared to locate one of his companies in 
such a zone, he said.  However, he would not actively seek 
money from the USG as in the past, he said, nor would he 
attempt to develop such parks on his own in any other 
countries except Turkey.  Wertheimer said he had already 
declined a recent invitation from Sen. Chuck Hagel to again 
pitch his idea before Congress, as he had already done in 
2002. 
 
------------------------------ 
Wertheimer Rethinks His Vision 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) In recent weeks, Wertheimer said, he had begun 
rethinking his vision for a large number of industrial parks 
in the non-oil countries of the Middle East.  These parks 
would have been modeled after the industrial estates he has 
established in Israel, where he has augmented manufacturing 
activities with vocational training and comfortable 
surroundings aimed at enhancing worker satisfaction and 
productivity.  Wertheimer sought substantial USG financial 
assistance by arguing that such parks could act as a catalyst 
for the industrialization, and hence the stabilization, of 
the region. 
 
4. (SBU) Wertheimer said that former Senator George J. 
Mitchell had heavily influenced his decision to rethink his 
industrial park idea, based upon conversations he had with 
Mitchell just prior to Kifayat\'s visit. (Note:  Earlier, an 
aide to Wertheimer told Econoff that Wertheimer had recently 
hired Mitchell and former Congressman Robert Livingston as 
consultants and Washington lobbyists for his plans.  End 
note.)  Wertheimer also admitted that, as an Israeli, he was 
having difficulty gaining acceptance for his idea in Jordan 
and in the West Bank/Gaza, the two areas where he saw the 
most promise for his parks.  Wertheimer, who in past 
discussions with Embassy officers had routinely highlighted 
his good connections with Jordanian officials and 
businessmen, told Kifayat that the Jordanians had a 
\"love-hate\" relationship with him.  He said he would fulfill 
his commitments to a Jordanian partner in the industrial zone 
in Aqaba, but would not actively expand his engagement in 
Jordan. 
 
5. (SBU) Wertheimer said he plans to re-focus his attention 
to his business activities in Turkey, where he is, together 
with Turkish partners, developing one industrial estate in 
Gebze and planning a second in Mersin.  He said he also hopes 
to develop vocational training programs for businessmen and 
workers in industrializing economies.  NSC Director Kifayat 
briefed Wertheimer on the Greater Middle East Initiative and 
invited him to share his opinions on the issue with senior 
NSC staff during his next trip to the U.S. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) The timing of Wertheimer\'s change of heart came as a 
surprise.  As recently as January Wertheimer had staged a 
large event at his flagship park in northern Israel to 
promote his industrial park idea.  Cabinet level politicians 
from Israel and Turkey attended, as did several former U.S. 
Congressmen.  All had voiced strong support for Wertheimer\'s 
vision.  Conspicuously absent at that meeting, however, were 
any official speakers from the international donor community. 
 It now appears that Wertheimer has concluded that his 
\"Marshall Plan\" is a no-go based upon the lukewarm support 
that he has received for his ideas in donor circles. 
 
7. (U) NSC Director Kifayat cleared this message.

1. (S) MOD DG Amos Yaron expressed concern March 3 to 
visiting Commerce U/S Kenneth Juster about signals that 
France might be ready to reverse its restrictive policy on 
arms sales to China.  In a March 4 follow-up meeting, Rami 
Yungman of the MOD pol-mil bureau told polmiloff that the 
sources of GOI concern were the tone of President Hu\'s recent 
state visit to France and informal signals the GOI has 
received from French officials that the GOF intends to 
reverse the arms sales policy that it has followed with China 
since Tiananmen. 
 
2. (S) Yaron plans to raise the possible change in French 
policy with USD(P) Feith and A/S Bloomfield during his March 
10-11 visit to Washington.  A change in French policy, Yaron 
suggested, could have implications for U.S. policy, 
including, he hinted, U.S. expectations about Israeli arms 
sales to China.  Yungman said Yaron would also raise the 
topic with his French MOD counterpart, Marc Perrin de 
Brichambaut, during a bilateral strategic dialogue in Paris 
immediately following the U.S. visit. 
 
3. (C) Yungman said he did not expect DefMin Mofaz to raise 
the issue either in Paris or Washington, both of which Mofaz 
will visit during the week of March 8.  Septel reports other 
issues Mofaz and Yaron plan to raise in Washington.

Classified By: Political Counselor Norm Olsen for reason 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: GOI and public reaction to the State 
Department\'s 2003 Human Rights Report (HRR) has been 
relatively low-key in the five business days since the 
report\'s publication.  The GOI\'s main substantive public 
statement -- as reported in the daily Ha\'aretz on February 27 
-- came from FM Silvan Shalom, who remarked that \"the United 
States always takes into account that the human rights 
situation is determined by the state of terrorism.\"  At least 
six Knesset members gave brief comments, almost exclusively 
on the occupied territories report, with several accusing the 
United States of unfairly criticizing IDF actions and others 
calling on the GOI to investigate the incidents of abuse 
toward the Palestinians cited in the report.  Aside from news 
items on the report, only two editorials on the report, both 
critical, appeared in major newspapers.  One human rights NGO 
issued a press release citing in positive terms sections of 
the Israel report that criticized the GOI\'s discriminatory 
treatment of Israeli Arabs.  End summary. 
 
------------ 
GOI Reaction 
------------ 
 
2.  (C) Aliza Inbal of the MFA\'s North America Division noted 
to Poloff on February 26 that Shalom viewed the report 
favorably, had praised the United States for discussing the 
context within which Israel was operating, and had underlined 
that the United States was Israel\'s foremost ally.  After 
comparing the 2002 and 2003 HRRs for the occupied 
territories, Inbal concluded that the 2003 report was 
\"softer\" on Israel.  She noted that this year\'s report went 
further to \"present the security context\" within which the 
GOI is operating. 
 
3.  (C) Inbal, Daniel Meron of the Human Rights Department of 
the Division for United Nations and International 
Organizations and Ady Scheinman of the MFA legal department 
skimmed through the reports quickly during Poloff\'s February 
25 visit to deliver the embargoed texts of the Israel Report 
and the Occupied Territories appendix (OT report).  When 
informed about the restrictions on the reports\' release, 
Meron joked that the State Department did not have to worry 
that the GOI would share the embargoed copy with the press, 
since the anticipated criticisms of the GOI in the report 
were not something the MFA would want to broadcast. 
Scheinman immediately searched the OT report for references 
to Israel\'s separation fence, and noted with surprise and 
dismay that the report uses the term \"security barrier\" to 
refer to the fence, although she did not indicate what term 
she would have preferred.  Meron asked why issuance of the 
report could not have been delayed just a few days until 
after the International Court of Justice hearing on the 
fence.  Poloff noted that the HRRs\' issuance date is mandated 
by Congress.  Meron complained that, unlike in previous 
years, this year the Department had not conveyed to the GOI 
any questions during the report\'s preparation specifically 
related to incidents in the Occupied Territories. 
 
----------- 
MK Comments 
----------- 
 
4.  (C) On March 3, six MKs gave brief remarks mainly on the 
OT report: Mohammad Barakeh (Hadash), Naomi Blumenthal 
(Likud), Ronny Brizon (Shinui), Zahava Galon (Meretz), Nissan 
Slomianski (National Religious Party) and Jamal Zahalka 
(Balad).  Post is not aware of any media coverage of these 
statements.  In separate conversations with MKs Zahalka and 
Slomiansky on March 4, Poloff learned that the MKs, with the 
exception of Ronny Brizon, commented exclusively on the OT 
report.  Slomiansky complained to Poloff that the report\'s 
criticism of the GOI and the IDF was unfair since Israel was 
a small country trying to defend itself against terrorism. 
In contrast, Israeli-Arab MK Zahalka told Poloff that the 
report was \"important\" and that the GOI should take it 
seriously.  Zahalka noted that Justice Minister Tommy Lapid 
was present during the Knesset session to represent the 
government.  According to Zahalka, Lapid commented that the 
GOI should take the report into consideration and investigate 
some of the incidents mentioned in the report.  Brizon told 
Poloff on March 2 that although he understood that the agenda 
item for discussion was the behavior of the IDF in the 
occupied territories as described in the report, he planned 
to comment on the Israel report, in particular on the 
treatment of the Arab minority.  Zahalka later told Poloff 
that Brizon had been, in fact, the only MK to comment on the 
Israel report. 
 
----------------------- 
Media and NGO Reactions 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) The media focused almost entirely on the OT report, 
highlighting U.S. criticism of the IDF\'s use of \"excessive 
force\" against Palestinians.  The media also reported on U.S. 
criticism of IDF treatment of Palestinians, including at 
checkpoints, house demolitions, and civilian casualties 
resulting from \"targeted assassinations.\"  Aside from 
straight news articles on the report, just two editorials 
appeared in the major newspapers.  In the February 29 
Ha\'aretz, Gideon Levy claimed that \"the United States has by 
its own hand lost its moral right to preach to any country in 
connection with human rights.\"  Levy asserted that \"a country 
that is holding 660 Afghan detainees in Guantanamo without 
trial and depriving them of basic rights is in no position to 
criticize administrative detentions carried out by other 
countries.\"  Levy also claimed that the United States could 
have brought Israel\'s abusive practices to an end if it 
\"truly wanted\" to do so.  The February 27 Jerusalem Post 
carried an editorial by Caroline Glick in which she 
criticized the \"State Department report\" for \"equating 
actions aimed at protecting Israeli citizens with terrorism\" 
and for providing the names of Palestinian children who died 
\"during Israeli assaults against Palestinian terrorists\" but 
omitting the names of Israelis who died in Palestinian 
terrorist attacks.  She asserted that the report \"follows in 
the path of the general climate\" which \"is characterized by 
the dehumanization of Israelis and Jews by the international 
community.\" 
 
6. (SBU) The Mossawa Center - The Advocacy Center for Arab 
Citizens of Israel, issued a press release on the Israel 
report, highlighting in positive terms those sections that 
discussed discrimination against Israeli Arabs.  Mossawa 
director Jafar Farah stated that \"The U.S. Human Rights 
Report rightfully criticizes the State of Israel for 
systematically discriminating against its Arab citizens in 
the design and implementation of its policies.  The Arab 
citizens of Israel have to deal with the unfortunate day to 
day reality of these humiliating policies.\"   Mohammed 
Zeidan, Director of the Arab Association for Human Rights, 
told Poloff on March 4 that the Israel report was \"excellent\" 
and that the Embassy should make it a practice to send a copy 
of the report to each Knesset member to ensure that it is 
read.

REF: TEL AVIV 0776 
 
Classified By: Pol/C Norm Olsen, per 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: The March 2 assassination of Khalil 
al-Zaban, Yasir Arafat\'s advisor on human rights and media 
issues, is but the most recent in an ongoing series of events 
that indicates a decline in law and order in the Gaza Strip. 
Neither the killers nor their motives have been identified. 
Somewhat but not wholly indicative of what many perceive to 
be an ongoing jockeying for power among different factions of 
the PA and Fatah, armed militants or gangs are also using 
their muscle to look out for themselves, demanding jobs, land 
and other benefits from what contacts call an increasingly 
fractured Palestinian Authority in Gaza.  Others may be 
simply settling old scores.  Security services shrink from 
challenging the offenders because they are either unwilling 
to confront rivals or are themselves worried about crossing 
someone from whom they themselves might need assistance in 
the future.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
Arafat Advisor Gunned Down 
-------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Khalil al-Zaban, a journalist and advisor to Yasir 
Arafat on human rights and the media, was assassinated in 
Gaza City in the early morning hours of March 2.  Al-Zaban 
headed the PA\'s government-appointed NGO Council and 
published its monthly newsletter, al-Nashra (\"The Bulletin\"). 
 Neither the killers nor their motives have been identified. 
A prominent journalist acquainted with al-Zaban called him 
thoughtful and an individual upon whose opinion Arafat relied 
heavily.  A behind-the-scenes type in recent years, al-Zaban 
was at one time noted for his open criticism of Islamic 
militancy and for his support for Palestinian prisoners being 
held in Syrian jails.  Al-Zaban was also known, however, to 
have been aggressive in attacking in print those critical of 
the PA, particularly on human rights.  Both PA police and 
Arafat\'s Force 17 are investigating the crime, and Arafat 
convened both the cabinet and the National Security Council 
(NSC) March 2 to coordinate the investigation. 
 
-------------------------- 
\"Gangsters on the Margins\" 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Although al-Zaban had been an Arafat loyalist since 
at least the PLO\'s days in Tunis, it is not entirely clear to 
what extent al-Zaban\'s assassination is related to the 
efforts of various Gaza factions and individuals to garner 
power.  Gaza pundits across the spectrum commented on his 
death more in light of the weakening of the PA in Gaza and 
the growing fragmentation of the security situation, than as 
an event with a message in its own right.  Similar to the 
attack on PA Police Chief Ghazi al-Jabali several weeks ago 
(reftel), this attack is being viewed among some Gazans as 
further evidence that personal scores in Gaza can now be 
settled with impunity.  While the lack of a legal penalty for 
violent attacks is hardly new in Gaza, contacts cite an 
increased level of anxiety among the public regarding the 
state of law and order. 
 
4.  (C)  Militants, or \"gangsters on the margins\" as one 
observer put it, appear increasingly inclined to use force of 
arms to achieve results.  Other recent incidents include the 
forced entry into the Offices of the Lands Authority February 
24 by approximately 20 armed men.  Details of the incident 
remain murky, but the men apparently demanded that the office 
issue them titles to land in the Gaza Strip, an action they 
claimed was authorized by Yasir Arafat.  The PA had 
previously issued such land titles to senior PA security 
officials and these inactive or fired security officers 
reportedly felt that they were entitled to the same benefits. 
 The head of the Lands Authority, Frayh Abu Middayn, told 
Poloff that it was \"simply impossible to carry out business 
in such an environment,\" and the office closed down for a 
week, re-opening only on March 3.  The forced entry February 
28 to the television and radio station in Ma\'en by militants 
demanding jobs is another example.  Left unpaid by their 
unidentified patron in Khan Yunis, the men were reportedly 
seeking to be entered on the PA payroll at the station to 
augment or at least ensure their income.  The bottom line in 
all of these incidents, some of which were likely the result 
of personal grudges, is the impunity of the perpetrators. 
 
5.  (C) The security forces, if not complicit, have 
demonstrated little interest in reining in either independent 
actors or their rivals from the militias and possibly 
sparking a wider confrontation.  While the attack on the Gaza 
Police Chief is indeed evidence of the breakdown of law and 
order, those more intimately acquainted with the actual event 
stressed that the score being settled between Jabali and his 
attackers was personal, having to do with reinstating men 
previously dismissed from the police, rather than a larger 
showdown between various security services.  What was 
noteworthy about the attack, contacts say, was that the 
perpetrators felt empowered enough to carry it out in broad 
daylight and that there were no subsequent arrests or 
reprisals. 
 
6.  (C) When asked who was in a position to improve the 
situation, Fatah moderate and Deputy Minister of Housing 
Marwan Abdul Hameed dismissed Muhammad Dahlan\'s chances of 
exerting a unifying influence over the panoply of security 
services in Gaza, adding that Dahlan was strong enough to be 
a spoiler only.  Warming to his subject, Hameed assessed that 
the man to run security in Gaza is Nasir Yusuf, whom Arafat 
rejected when he was nominated for Interior Minister in Abu 
Ala,a,s government.  Hameed said that Yusuf, whom he said 
is originally from Gaza, has the proper background, the 
Islamic credentials in the eyes of the public to face off 
Hamas, and is a Fatah stalwart.  Hameed opined that it was 
Arafat\'s fear of Yusuf\'s possible success in Gaza, and 
subsequent potential to challenge Arafat himself, that 
prevented Arafat from appointing him to the task. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C) Perhaps more hopefully than realistically, contacts 
say that al-Zaban\'s murder may give Arafat pause in a way 
that previous incidents had not, particularly as it comes 
hard on the heels of the Fatah Revolutionary Council meeting 
in which more reform-minded Fatah members such as Hameed were 
openly critical of Arafat\'s unwillingness to control, among 
other things, the security situation in the territories.

SUBJECT: ETHIOPIAN JEWRY IN ISRAEL 
 
1. Summary:  Ethiopian Jews in Israel number 
approximately 90,000.  Fifty percent of them are 
under the age of 25.  Most can trace their families\' 
arrival in Israel to rescue missions such as Operation 
Moses (1984) and Operation Solomon (1991). The vast 
majority live in impoverished communities where even 
menial work is scarce, and the lack of educational 
opportunities relegates most to low wage jobs. They 
face huge obstacles in the areas of access to 
employment, education, and housing. These difficulties 
are, at least in part, the result of challenges that 
they confront in moving from an essentially agrarian 
society in Ethiopia to the modern, technologically 
advanced Israeli economy.  Sixty-five percent of 
Israelis of Ethiopian origin are not working. 
More than 80 percent are functionally illiterate in 
their native Amharic.  Last year, only about 1,250 
Ethiopian students entered university at the completion 
of high school and military service, according to 
Israel\'s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).  While 
there is a small middle class, it is negligible when 
compared with the overall Israeli population.  In 
addition, Ethiopian Israelis are held back by the 
widespread perception that they are not `real\' Jews. 
Stereotyping and discrimination also trouble them and 
hinder their integration into Israeli society.  The GOI 
has taken some steps to address these issues.  It 
offers scholarships to Ethiopian students, promotes 
vocational training, provides favorable mortgages to 
Ethiopian homebuyers, and supports NGOs that foster 
ethnic and religious tolerance.  However, critics argue 
that the GOI must do more or Ethiopian immigrants could 
be locked into a cycle of despair and poverty that 
will lead to the creation of a permanent black 
underclass.  End Summary 
 
------------------------------------ 
Educating Ethiopian-Israeli Children 
------------------------------------ 
2. Ethiopian immigrants to Israel struggle to bridge a 
huge knowledge gap that directly impacts their 
integration into Israeli society.  They have one of the 
highest dropout rates and lowest achievement records of 
any community in Israel.  Only 32 percent of Ethiopian 
students were eligible to sit for college entrance 
exams, compared with 50 percent of students in the 
general population, according to the JDC Brookdale 
Institute, a leading center for applied research on 
human services.  A recent survey by the Institute found 
that more than 50 percent of Ethiopian-Israeli parents 
are not equipped to assist their children with 
schoolwork, and 65 percent of teachers have low 
expectations of these students, creating an unfortunate 
cycle of low expectations and poor performance. 
Ethiopian-Israelis are concentrated in a small number 
of communities, often learning at substandard schools. 
Barbara Swirski, director of the Adva Center, a non- 
partisan Israeli policy analysis center, explained that 
less than one-third of Ethiopian students in elementary 
and middle school receive grades at or above the 
national average, and thirty-five percent of Ethiopian- 
Israeli students in grades 1-9 cannot read or write at 
grade level.    UNESCO estimates that 90 percent of 
adult Ethiopian immigrants had less than five years of 
schooling in Ethiopia, before they immigrated to 
Israel. 
 
-------------------------- 
Bridging the Education Gap 
-------------------------- 
3. The GOI provides students from the Ethiopian 
immigrant community special classes and extra hours of 
instruction, counseling at critical transitional 
junctures such as kindergarten-to-first grade and 
junior high-to-high school.  It also pays their 
university tuition costs.  Statistics from the CBS 
indicate that 1500 Ethiopian Israelis are currently 
pursuing university degrees, compared with less than 
100 five years ago.  The GOI has allocated 
considerable resources to provide preschool education 
for disadvantaged children, many of whom are of 
Ethiopian origin. 
 
-------------------------- 
Rescuing Disaffected Youth 
-------------------------- 
4. Negist Menguesha, director of the Ethiopian National 
Project (ENP), an umbrella NGO for the development of 
Ethiopian-Israelis, says that as many as 26 percent of 
Ethiopian-Israeli youth either drop out of school or do 
not regularly attend classes.  An increasing number of 
these youth have become involved in illegal activities. 
According to Simcha Getahune, the director of the 
Ethiopian Affairs Unit of ELEM, an NGO that works with 
youth at risk, in 1996, forty-seven Ethiopian youth 
were arrested for violent crimes.  By 2002, the number 
had risen to 220.  In 1996, there was one arrest for a 
drug-related offense, but in 2002 the number had jumped 
to 58.  Similar increases were reported with regard to 
property crimes during this period. 
 
5. ELEM estimates that more than 3500 Ethiopian youth 
are at-risk.  To reclaim these youth, it established 
partnerships with the GOI and other NGOs to return the 
youth to the formal education structure, and, when that 
is not an option, to prevent them from coming to harm 
on the streets.  Partnerships offer special academic 
courses to reintroduce youth to the classroom, 
leadership development training, and courses designed 
to strengthen their connection with Israel and Judaism. 
Other activities focus on building cooperation between 
parents, teachers and communities to ensure that 
children stay in school.  Shula Mola, former director 
of the Israeli Association for Ethiopian Jews, insists, 
\"Second chance programs prove that when resources are 
directed towards bridging educational and cultural 
gaps, Ethiopian youngsters can make it.  However, 
Israel\'s budgetary constraints mean that the full 
integration of disaffected Ethiopian youth will be 
delayed.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Ethiopian Israelis: Struggling for Acceptance 
--------------------------------------------- 
6. Jews of Ethiopian origin represent the lowest rung 
of Israel\'s Jewish socioeconomic ladder. While many of 
the difficulties that they face may be explained, at 
least in part, by the challenges of immigration, 
cultural differences, and the disparity in educational 
levels, this alone does not fully explain the extent of 
their marginalization, particularly in the case of the 
30,000 Ethiopian-Israelis born in Israel. 
 
------------------------- 
Who\'s a Jew and Who\'s Not 
------------------------- 
7. Many Israelis question the Judaism of Ethiopian 
Israelis (also known as Falash Mura), the majority of 
whom converted to Christianity in Ethiopia, many under 
coercion.  There is a widespread perception that the 
approximately 22,000 Falash Mura who claim Jewish 
ancestry awaiting immigration to Israel do not have 
Jewish roots and simply want to escape economic 
hardship in Ethiopia.  Indeed, the Habad, one of 
Israel\'s most activist orthodox religious sects, does 
not fully recognize Ethiopian Israelis as Jews.  To 
allay doubts about the Falash Mura\'s claims of Judaism, 
the GOI investigates the Jewish ancestry of intended 
immigrants and encourages them to undergo orthodox 
conversion, says Batia Eyob, director of the Israel 
Association of Ethiopian Jews (IAEJ), an Ethiopian- 
Israeli advocacy and service NGO.  Until recently, it 
also urged Ethiopian immigrants to enroll their 
children in orthodox schools to strengthen their sense 
of Judaism.  Eighty percent of Ethiopian Israeli 
children attend orthodox schools, according to 
statistics provided by the Adva Center. 
 
8. Although even the most critical Ethiopian activists 
insist that the GOI does not sanction discrimination of 
one class of Jew against another, many blame the GOI 
for not doing enough to address what they see as de 
facto discrimination against them.  As one Ethiopian 
Israeli contact put it, \"The government wants the world 
to believe that there is only one Jewish people... that 
all of us are the same. Hence, it pretends that there 
are no differences.\"  This view is not universal. 
Another contact stated, \"Israel has done more for my 
people than we could have hoped for.\"  The difference 
in perspective is largely generational, with younger 
Ethiopians feeling less gratitude to the Jewish state 
and more likely to demand their full integration into 
society, says Avrahm Neguise, director of South Wing to 
Zion, executive director of an advocacy NGO for the 
Falash Mura. 
 
----------------- 
Is Race a Factor? 
----------------- 
9. Ethiopian Israelis almost unanimously believe that 
racism and stereotypes play a significant role in their 
troubled assimilation into Israeli society.  Even some 
veteran Israeli contacts admit that Israelis are 
developing a negative image of Ethiopians.  One stated, 
\"The absorption of Ethiopians could be a source of 
pride for the country, but if they continue to be 
associated with crime, violence...and other negative 
traits in the minds of other Israelis, there will be 
alienation.\"  Ethiopian-Israelis say racism limits 
their access to social services, jobs, and education. 
In addition, well-educated Ethiopian Israelis charge 
that others question their qualifications and assume 
that they are less qualified.  One Ethiopian academic 
asked, \"Do you know what its like to have some one 
assume that you are illiterate just because you are 
black?\"  Another stated, \"We want acceptance, to feel 
like all Israel\'s other Jews, and to be a full part of 
this society, but we can\'t achieve this goal as long as 
we are dismissed as ignorant and looked upon as proof 
of Israel\'s charity.\" Other Ethiopian Israelis point to 
the widespread use in the media of the word \"Cushi,\" a 
Hebrew word meaning \"Ethiopian negro,\" that they find 
offensive, to describe them as anecdotal evidence of 
racial prejudice. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Politics: Not Enough Votes to Really Count 
------------------------------------------ 
 
10. Ethiopian voters, estimated at 45,000, are not 
enough to woo the major political parties sufficiently 
to put their concerns squarely on the national agenda. 
Israel\'s political list system in which voters vote for 
party lists instead of individuals also works against 
them.  To date, only one Ethiopian Israeli has been 
elected to the Knesset.  Contacts state that for 
historical reasons, most Ethiopians vote for the 
conservative Likud party, at least in national 
elections.  Likud governments authorized the airlifts 
that brought the first Ethiopian immigrants to Israel. 
 
11. In the 2003 national elections, two Ethiopian- 
Israeli candidates ran for the Knesset.  Neither was 
successful.  Ethiopian candidates have done better on 
the local level.  In 2003, Ethiopian candidates won a 
total of 6 seats in five municipalities.  This little 
publicized success indicates that the traditionally 
complacent Ethiopian minority may be becoming more 
politically savvy.  As if to prove the point, in 
November 2003, Ethiopians demonstrated outside of the 
Prime Minister\'s residence to demand the right of 
family members, still in Ethiopia, to join them in 
Israel.  In January 2004, Foreign Minister Silvan 
Shalom announced plans to speed up the resettlement of 
the Falash Mura, more than 22,000 of whom are waiting 
to immigrate to Israel.  But Shalom\'s promise provoked 
a backlash from lawmakers who question the claims of 
Jewish roots of the Falash Mura and argue that Israel 
cannot afford the speedy resettlement of thousands of 
destitute Ethiopians.  Press reports quote Absorption 
Minister Tsipi Livni as saying that absorption costs 
for each Falash Mura is high (approximately 100,000 
USD) because of the deep cultural and economic gaps 
that Ethiopians must overcome to acclimate in Israel. 
 
12. Ethiopian-Israeli organizations see restriction on 
the immigration of Ethiopians as unjust, particularly 
in light of Israel\'s proactive efforts to promote the 
immigration of other Jews.  Among the government\'s 
critics on this issue is Avraham Neguise, executive 
director of South Wing of Zion.  \"Putting economic 
considerations before saving Jews is a crime against 
Zionism,\" he said.  \"We demand the government give 
answers.  It is very difficult to imagine why, when we 
are begging other Jews to come from countries like 
Russia, America and Argentina, we raise the question of 
money for the Ethiopian Jews.  I have no doubt this is 
discrimination,\" Neguise said. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Integration into the Israeli Labor Market 
----------------------------------------- 
13. The unemployment rate for Ethiopian Jews is one of 
the highest of any group in Israel.  Their position is 
exacerbated by the fact that they tend to have low 
paying jobs.  Most of them -- 75 percent of working men 
and 62 percent of working women -- are employed as 
unskilled agricultural and manufacturing workers. 
Sixty-five percent of Ethiopian-Israeli households 
depend on welfare, according to the Adva Center. 
Several factors hinder their ability to fully access 
the job market.  The most pressing is their inability 
to compete effectively with veteran Israelis and 
immigrants from developed countries who frequently have 
greater academic and professional training.  Moreover, 
many do not speak Hebrew well, and, arguably, although 
Ethiopians complete military service, they are not part 
of the army\'s \"old boys\" network, which often helps 
Israelis find jobs after they complete military 
service.  To address the problem, the GOI has 
instituted vocational training programs for youth.  It 
has also entered into partnerships with NGOs and the 
private sector to encourage companies to hire Ethiopian 
Israelis, says Negist Menguesha.  These programs have 
had only limited success. Sixty-five percent of 
Ethiopian-Israelis between the age of 25 and 54 are 
unemployed. 
 
14.  Few Ethiopian-Israelis -- 4 percent of men and 15 
percent of women -- are to be found in the academic, 
liberal, and technical professions.  Of the 94,000 
Jewish licensed teachers in Israel, 30 are of Ethiopian 
origin, according to the Ministry of Education. 
Statistics provided by the Israeli Bar Association 
indicate that there are only five practicing Ethiopian- 
Israeli lawyers.  The largest employer of Ethiopian- 
Israeli women is the public sector.  The majority of 
Ethiopian-Israelis employed by government agencies 
provide services to other Ethiopian immigrants.  The 
number of Ethiopian-Israelis who own their own 
businesses is negligible.  The few that do exist are 
limited to small family shops that sell Ethiopian style 
clothing, music, and spices. KURTZER

SUBJECT: ISRAELI VENTURE CAPITALISTS REQUEST CLARITY ON 
SALE OF ISRAELI SOFTWARE TO USG SECURITY AGENCIES 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  Senior Israeli venture capitalists outlined 
to the Ambassador March 3 difficulties Israeli firms are 
having selling software relating to homeland security and 
counterterrorism to certain USG entities.  According to Chemi 
Peres, chairman of one of Israel\'s largest VC firms, Pitango 
Investments, and Moshe Mor, general partner in the U.S. firm 
Greylock, the sale of such software to USG agencies is being 
blocked as a result of counterintelligence and 
counterterrorism concerns.  The Ambassador noted that the 
purchase of software by U.S. security agencies is a very 
sensitive issue involving legitimate national security 
concerns.  In order to facilitate useful dialogue, he said 
the Israeli Government, not private firms would need to 
decide if it wanted to raise this issue.  He stressed that 
any progress on the issue would take time and would have to 
enable U.S. firms to sell to the GOI as well.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) Mor began the meeting by noting that his firm, 
founded in 1965 with private investors and a number of U.S. 
universities, had begun investing in Israeli high tech 
companies two years ago.  A number of these firms produced 
software with direct application in the field of homeland 
security.  Although the firms\' products were a perfect fit 
for USG agencies engaged in the fight against terror, Mor 
said, the firms had run into two sets of security concerns 
that were hindering sales.  The first issue, foreign 
ownership, was an \"old\" problem with well-established and 
clear remedies.  The more difficult issue, according to Mor, 
was USG aversion to purchasing software developed outside the 
U.S. for sensitive applications.  Mor claimed that USG 
agencies do not wish to discuss their objections to the 
purchase of \"offshore\" software in an open, transparent 
manner, and that there are no established remedies for the 
Israeli companies to address USG concerns. Mor claimed that 
Israeli companies are subject to greater scrutiny by USG 
agencies than firms from other countries. 
 
3.  (C) Mor presented four examples.  He said that one USG 
security agency had informed an Israeli firm that \"its 
counterintelligence team would not allow \'doing business with 
an Israeli company.\'\"  A second firm, Checkpoint Software, 
had spent USD 500,000 trying to address concerns about its 
Israeli-developed code, and had only partial success in 
overcoming USG objections.  Another company that had 
developed smart alerts software (which looks at a complex 
series of data, collates it, and issues alerts if certain 
pre-set criteria have been met) suddenly found its commercial 
discussions with the USG cut off for no reason.  Lastly, the 
FBI had signed a $700 million annual contract with an Israeli 
firm, Clear Forest, to supply text analytics software.  Mor 
noted that, one year into deployment of the software in 
question, the FBI decided not to renew the contract, \"citing 
(informally) a veto by its counterintelligence team.\" 
 
4.  (C) Mor noted that the established method of certifying 
software for sensitive uses, clearance through the National 
Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), is expensive and 
burdensome, particularly for many Israeli high-tech firms, 
which tend to be small.  Summing up, Mor asked the Ambassador 
for help in establishing a dialogue with USG agencies in 
order to identify the issues of concern to them and to search 
for a way to resolve those concerns. 
 
5.  (C) The Ambassador noted that U.S. concerns over the 
purchase of \"offshore\" software by USG national security 
entities reflect the highly sensitive nature of such 
purchases.  He stressed this sensitivity is based on 
experience and that it is legitimate.  He asked whether U.S. 
software firms can sell intelligence-related software to the 
Israel security and intelligence agencies.  The Ambassador 
said he doubted such sales were possible.  He also stressed 
that, as far as he knew, USG concerns about software 
developed outside the U.S. apply to all countries and not to 
Israel in particular.  If this was not the case, the Israelis 
needed to demonstrate this clearly. 
 
6.  (C)  The Ambassador noted that Israel had successfully 
addressed related concerns in the area of defense 
procurement, but that the process had taken a number of 
years.  He imagined that software procurement would be even 
more time consuming.  As a first step, he said the GOI would 
need to decide whether it wanted to raise this issue and then 
to identify a point of contact to discuss it.  Once this step 
was taken, the appropriate authorities could begin to 
introduce this issue into the on-going bilateral discussions 
on related issues.  In this regard, he noted that the 
Commerce Department Undersecretary for Industry and Security, 
Kenneth Juster, was currently in country discussing dual use 
issues with GOI bodies.  Other opportunities for such 
discussions would present themselves.  (Note: Minister of 
Industry and Trade Olmert raised with U/S Juster a related 
issue -- the failure of the Israeli high-tech firm Checkpoint 
Software to gain approval for its proposed purchase of a U.S. 
firm because of security-related issues (see septel).) 
 
7.  (C) The Ambassador stressed, however, that any agreement 
reached would have to work in two directions.  He reminded 
Peres and Mor of the difficulties U.S. firms are having with 
the GOI\'s procurement system, as outlined in remarks by the 
Ambassador at the Israel-US Chamber of Commerce meeting on 
February 10, 2004.  These difficulties were exacerbating a 
significant U.S. trade deficit with Israel.  If Israel wanted 
USG entities to purchase Israeli goods for sensitive uses, 
then the USG would demand the opportunity for U.S. firms to 
compete for similar GOI contracts on the basis of a level 
playing field.

All media reported that the security forces have 
imposed total closure on the territories until Tuesday. 
This is the first time such a measure has been taken 
for the holiday of Purim. 
 
Maariv quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz as saying in 
recent defense establishment meetings that Israel will 
withdraw from the Gaza Strip only after the U.S. 
presidential elections.  Leading media reported that 
Thursday PM Sharon resumed his efforts to persuade 
recalcitrant right-wing ministers to accept his 
unilateral disengagement plan.  He met with Education 
Minister Limor Livnat (Likud) and Transportation 
Minister Avigdor Lieberman (National Union).  Ha\'aretz 
reported that next week the Yesha Council of Jewish 
Settlers in the Territories will intensify its protests 
against Sharon\'s plan. 
 
Maariv and Globes published new revelations regarding 
Elchanan Tenenbaum.  Maariv reported that Kayes Obeid, 
the Israeli Arab and Hezbollah agent who set up 
Tenenbaum\'s Dubai trip was a Shin Bet agent prior to 
Tenenbaum\'s abduction.  Sharon\'s son Gilad, Tenenbaum 
and Shimon Cohen, the father of Tenenbaum\'s estranged 
wife were involved in a 1992 land deal.  Maariv asserts 
that a senior associate of Sharon explicitly threatened 
its reporters investigating the affair.  Globes 
reported that the friendship between Sharon and Shimon 
Cohen went on until at least March 1991.  Maariv cited 
the response of Sharon\'s bureau that his family is not 
linked to the land deal and that Gilad does not know 
Tenenbaum. 
-Leading media reported that Thursday Knesset members 
on the Right expressed outrage at reports that Sharon 
associates blamed the Right for Wednesday\'s revelations 
in Maariv. 
-All media reported that Tenenbaum is now being 
investigated under tougher conditions, as crime, not 
security, becomes the focus of the probe.  Ha\'aretz 
reported that the police will give him another 
polygraph test, after they have finished interrogating 
him about alleged criminal offenses. 
-Thursday, the High Court of Justice declined to debate 
the plea bargain reached between the state and 
Tenenbaum. 
 
All media (banners in Ha\'aretz and Hatzofe) reported 
that Eliran Cohen, a 22-year-old Jew from Haifa, was 
arrested on suspicion of having carried out nine 
attacks against Arabs in the Haifa area, including a 
bombing attempt of the car of Hadash Knesset Member 
Issam Makhoul in October 2003.  Eliran\'s father, Meir 
Cohen, is suspected of having provided him with weapons 
and explosives.  Israel Radio reported that a 22-year- 
old IDF soldier, who is a resident of Ashdod, was 
arrested last night on suspicion of involvement in the 
case.  Makhoul was quoted as saying that Jewish 
terrorism, which reached its peak with the 
assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, is 
\"alive and kicking.\" 
Ha\'aretz reported that the IDF recently conducted a 
simulation \"war game\" about what could happen the day 
after PA Chairman Yasser Arafat passes away.  The 
exercise examined several scenarios and how Arafat\'s 
death -- by natural causes -- would influence the 
domestic situation in the PA and its relations. 
Security sources told Ha\'aretz that the exercise was 
not a result of any new information about the state of 
Arafat\'s health. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio reported that Thursday the 
High Court of Justice postponed the evacuation of six 
illegal outposts by 10 more days. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that a planned new IDF committee will 
apply the same criteria to both genders seeking army 
deferrals because of pacifism. 
 
Leading media reported that next week FM Silvan Shalom 
will hold talks in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak and Egyptian FM Ahmed Maher.  Yediot reported 
that Shalom will propose a deal in which Azzam Azzam, 
an Israeli jailed for spying in Egypt, would be 
released.  This will be Shalom\'s first visit to Egypt. 
 
All media reported that Thursday at a press conference 
held at the Prime Minister\'s Office, Internal Security 
Minister Tzachi Hanegbi announced the replacement of 
the current security system for public transportation, 
which he said had failed, with a new USD 7-million 
plan, sponsored by the Chicago-based International 
Fellowship of Christians and Jews.  The group donated 
an initial sum of USD 1 million to Israel. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Thursday the High Court of 
Justice rejected a petition filed against the IDF\'s 
plan to demolish 20 Palestinian houses in Hebron, but 
decided to accept the army\'s revised request to raze 
only two of the houses. 
 
Ha\'aretz (Zvi Bar\'el) presented negative and positive 
views of intellectuals and politicians from various 
Arab countries regarding the Greater Middle East 
Initiative. 
Jerusalem Post reported that Victor Marrero, a federal 
judge in New York, \"shot down the PA\'s legal defense 
strategy\" in a USD 500 million terrorism lawsuit, 
declaring that the Palestinian claim of sovereign 
immunity does not hold up in U.S. courts. 
Noted American Middle East expert Professor Bernard 
Lewis predicted, in an interview with Yediot, that a 
revolution will take place in Iran in two to three 
years. 
Ha\'aretz reported on a Health Ministry decision, in 
principle, to approve cloning human embryos for 
scientific research and producing embryonic stem cells. 
 
Yediot published the results of a Mina Zemach (Dahaf 
Institute) poll: 
-66 percent of Israelis do not trust the government. 
-59 percent of respondents believed that Sharon\'s 
motives for having Tenenbaum freed were untainted. 
-53 percent believe that Sharon should reign because of 
the affairs currently under police investigation. 
-\"If Sharon quits, whom would you like to replace him 
as PM?\"  Shaul Mofaz: 30 percent (41 percent among 
Likud voters); Binyamin Netanyahu: 26 percent (37 
percent among Likud voters); Ehud Olmert and Silvan 
Shalom: 8 percent each; none of the proposed choices: 
24 percent (3 percent of Likud voters).

I.  \"Where Is He Running To?\" 
 
Former editor-in-chief Moshe Ishon wrote in 
nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe (March 5): \"In 
Washington, people are aware of the disputes taking 
place in Jerusalem around Sharon\'s unilateral 
evacuation plan from Gaza.  Not everyone [in 
Washington] is prepared to accept his belief that he 
can implement his plan.  Many people are expecting a 
government crisis.  President Bush\'s close advisers ... 
are suggesting that the confrontations concerning the 
Gaza Strip be postponed until after the presidential 
elections.  Some have even proposed that Sharon\'s visit 
be put off until after the elections.  Bush considers 
himself committed to meeting Sharon in the near future. 
Some people say that it would happen no later than 
early April, perhaps even earlier.  They say that the 
meeting would be purely formal, without real 
commitments.  Sharon wouldn\'t be able to commit himself 
to an evacuation from the Gaza Strip, while Bush would 
find it hard to provide him with financial grants 
before the elections.  Both sides understand each other 
well, say Israeli government and Capitol Hill 
officials.  Sharon isn\'t prepared to admit at this 
juncture that his Washington visit will be purely 
formal.  He is still pinning great hopes on it.\" 
 
II.  \"Lessons of the Latest Debacle\" 
 
Extreme right-wing columnist Caroline B. Glick wrote on 
page one of conservative, independent Jerusalem Post 
(March 5): \"What is happening is no less than a 
revolution, albeit a tentative one, in the way the U.S. 
views its Middle East policy.  If in the past, 
consecutive U.S. administrations have swallowed the 
Arab propaganda line that no reforms of their 
dictatorships were possible until the Israeli- 
Palestinian conflict was resolved, today the Bush 
administration is rejecting this lie.  Speaking in 
Cairo this week, Undersecretary of State Mark Grossman 
said, \'The effort for reform in Arab countries does not 
have to wait until there is a full peace.\'  And what is 
Israel doing in the face of this welcome and courageous 
American policy?  Our government is rejecting it, by 
deed if not by word.  By courting Mubarak while he 
leads the charge against the U.S. initiative to bring 
freedom to the Arab world we are strengthening Mubarak 
and his authoritarian government that has made Egypt 
the epicenter of Arab anti-Semitism and the gravest 
conventional threat to Israeli security.... And where 
is the Israeli media?  Aside from laconic reports of 
the American initiative, buried in the back pages of 
the newspapers and at the tail ends of news broadcasts, 
never to be repeated, there has been no media 
discussion of the strategic ramifications of the 
American initiative.\" 
III.  \"What Makes the IDF Unique\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(March 5): \"The IDF is a disciplined army that is under 
democratic civilian authority and at this time, this 
democracy, even if it wanted to, cannot free itself of 
the control over another people.  This, more than 
anything else, is what makes the IDF unique today. 
This is a negative distinction that the world is 
witnessing.  It is inconceivable that this is not 
affecting the IDF and that it will not ultimately erode 
its morality.  The Americans, and the other forces that 
are aiding them in Iraq, have also defined themselves 
as an army of occupation, but they repeatedly stress 
that this is to last for only a relatively short time. 
The IDF has had this reality forced upon it for decades 
and there are no real signs of a substantial change in 
the foreseeable future.\"

SUBJECT: New Mayor of Dimona Eager to Assist Embassy\'s 
Investigation of Hebrew Israelite Community 
 
Ref: A)Tel Aviv 000935; B)03 Tel Aviv 6216; C)03 Tel 
Aviv 6217 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: ACS Chief, ARSO, Conspec and RSO 
investigator met with newly-elected Mayor of Dimona, 
Meir Cohen on March 2, 2004 to discuss the Embassy\'s 
ongoing investigation into criminal activity by the 
Hebrew Israelite Community (HIC). Also present at the 
meeting was ex-Deputy Mayor, Albert Assaf, who also 
served under Mayor Cohen\'s predecessor and is well 
known to post. The new Mayor, especially, was shocked 
by Emboffs\' account of the results of the Embassy\'s 
ongoing investigation of the HIC and appeared eager to 
cooperate.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The meeting began with few formalities, as the 
Mayor, an independent elected with Labor support, 
immediately guessed at the purpose of the meeting and 
launched into an overview of the relationship between 
the City of Dimona and the Hebrew Israelite Community 
(HIC) from his perspective.  He added that after being 
elected, he had visited the Community and advised them 
that he wanted to be open to their needs. He told us 
that he was aware the HIC had supported his opponent in 
the electoral campaign, but he had wanted to offer an 
olive branch to the Community by approaching them.  He 
said that he knew that there had been problems in the 
community, but that he had a duty to ensure that all 
people living in Dimona had some guarantee of at least 
the basic human necessities, including food and 
shelter.  As part of this effort, he mentioned that a 
plot of land had been allocated to the HIC but the 
project was on hold pending financial support. The 
banks, he said, are refusing to grant mortgages to the 
HIC despite the assurances of HIC leader Ben Ammi 
Carter, who advised the Mayor several weeks ago that 
USAID had approved a 4 million dollar grant to them. 
(Note: Embassy is not aware of any such grant.)  The 
Mayor also said that he had spoken with the Prime 
Minister urging him to give the HIC the same status as 
enjoyed by the Ethiopians. 
 
3. (SBU) After an introduction by the ACS Chief 
regarding the U.S. government\'s concern over the safety 
and welfare of American citizens within the HIC, ARSO 
presented a summary of the major allegations of 
wrongdoing that members and leaders of the HIC are 
accused of committing, including reported child abuse, 
fraud, drug trafficking and even murder (see reftels). 
The mayor seemed genuinely shocked by what ARSO 
presented, and reacted for a moment as if the chair 
legs had been kicked out from under him.  He said that 
he had no idea of how serious the level of criminal 
activity really was.  He added that, as a result of the 
presentation, he would put his program of outreach on 
hold.  He promised to assist in any way possible. 
 
4.  (SBU) Early in his presentation the Mayor had 
mentioned that 37 HIC students were scheduled to be 
enlisted into the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in August 
2004, and that all expressed enthusiasm for serving in 
the army and wanted to serve in a front line fighting 
unit. As a result of the revelations described above, 
the Mayor suggested that the Embassy should consider 
discussing its investigation with the IDF, pointing out 
that the introduction of automatic weapons to the HIC 
community might not be a positive development. 
 
5. (SBU) ARSO also briefed the Mayor on the recent 
visit to the Dimona garbage dump described in reftel A 
and showed him the photographs of fresh mounds in 
several areas of the site. The Mayor said he would look 
into the possibility of obtaining a court order to 
disinter the remains, which he said was logistically 
possible (Note: RSO and Consular requested to be 
present during the disinterment and subsequent autoposy 
of remains.  The Mayor agreed and advised that he would 
notify post accordingly.) He expressed concern at the 
thought of the HIC still burying their dead in that 
dump.  The Mayor noted Deputy Finance Minister 
Shitrit\'s statement earlier this week that there were 
two factions in Israel who were not reporting deaths 
while continuing to claim national insurance benefits. 
The Finance Ministry estimates that the National 
Insurance is currently paying 15 million shekels ($3.3 
million USD), in effect to deceased recipients. 
 
6. (SBU) The Mayor informed us that the HIC owe the 
municipality half a million shekels ($2.2 million USD) 
for unpaid water and municipal taxes.  He said that he 
had spoken to HIC leader Carter, and the HIC are now 
paying off their debt in bi-monthly payments of 25,000 
Israeli shekels ($5,700 USD), which community leaders 
always pay in cash.  In addition, the Israeli Welfare 
Ministry sends the City of Dimona 17,000 ($3,900 USD) 
Israeli shekels each month to purchase vegetables for 
the HIC.  It is the Mayor\'s understanding that one of 
the sources of this money is USAID.  Finally, a Trust 
Fund for the School still exists, run by an Israeli 
Attorney (ex-Ministry of Education officer with whom 
Post worked closely while dealing with the HIC in the 
early 90\'s).  Two HIC members also preside on that 
Committee. 
 
7. (SBU) Albert Assaf, the ex-Deputy Mayor who has long 
worked with the Embassy on issues regarding the HIC, 
was not as shocked about these revelations.  While he 
expressed some surprise about the allegations of drug 
trafficking, he indicated that his greatest surprise 
was that U.S. authorities had waited so many years to 
do anything about it.  He said that he had heard of 
most of the allegations raised, even the most severe 
child abuse cases, involving the amputation of fingers 
and thumbs, but only anecdotally, without names and 
dates. 
 
8.  (SBU)  Comment.  The meeting was extremely 
productive and encouraging, in dramatic contrast to 
others with GOI officials on this issue.  The Mayor 
appeared genuinely interested and eager to assist the 
Embassy with its investigation.  Whether or not he will 
follow through and whether he is actually able to 
mobilize resources is another question.  Mayors do not 
oversee police forces in Israel, and it is among the 
Israeli police where the main resistance to an active 
investigation has been encountered.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: ISRAELI READOUT OF IRAN NUCLEAR CONSULTATIONS WITH 
FRANCE 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY: In a readout of their consultations with 
French officials about Iran and other IAEA issues, Gideon 
Frank and Eli Levite of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission 
(IAEC) said the French MFA poldir had told them that the EU-3 
agreement with Iran could not be twisted to justify removal 
of Iran from the IAEA BOG agenda.  Frank was not reassured, 
however, about the sustainability of Iran on the agenda 
because ElBaradei appears deliberately to avoid using the 
strong language of BOG resolutions -- e.g., \"further serious 
failures\" -- in his reports.  Frank proposed a different 
format for the reports that would curtail ElBaradei\'s ability 
to express judgments.  Frank and Levite found their French 
counterparts \"fixated\" on Iran\'s internal political dynamics, 
rather than on finding ways to block Iran\'s nuclear program. 
GOF officials said they wanted to move from suspension to 
cessation of Iran\'s enrichment/reprocessing activities, but 
feared losing Russian support along the way.  While some GOF 
officials thought the President\'s February 11 fuel cycle 
initiative could be a good tool against Iran, others worried 
about the political viability of another discriminatory 
nonproliferation norm.  Frank thought a discriminatory 
approach was unavoidable, and that opposition could be 
overcome with the right incentives to states renouncing a 
fuel cycle capability.  Frank and Levite noted GOF interest 
in reinserting UNMOVIC into Iraq, and perceived a sincere GOF 
desire for the U.S. to discover WMD in Iraq.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (S) Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) DG Gideon Frank 
and his deputy, Eli Levite, briefed Ambassador and polmiloff 
March 3 on their discussions about Iran and other IAEA issues 
with French officials in Paris the previous week.  Frank 
interspersed the brief with his own views about how to 
strengthen ElBaradei\'s reports to the IAEA Board and on 
President Bush\'s February 11 initiative for controlling the 
ability of states to develop new fuel cycle capabilities. 
 
------------------------ 
Keeping the BOG on Track 
------------------------ 
 
3. (S) Frank said he was worried that the EU-3 would seek to 
remove Iran from the IAEA Board of Governors (BOG) agenda by 
June if ElBaradei does not report \"further serious failures\" 
by Iran to the BOG.  This concern is compounded by the GOI 
observation that ElBaradei does not use language from BOG 
resolutions, such as \"further serious failures,\" in his 
reports to the BOG.  He said that \"Europeans\" have speculated 
to the GOI that ElBaradei deliberately eschews resolution 
language in order not to prejudge BOG decisionmaking.  The 
problem with ElBaradei\'s seemingly \"neutral\" approach, Frank 
lamented, is that it does in fact prejudge BOG 
decisionmaking, but in the wrong direction.  Many BOG members 
will not vote for a resolution condemning Iran for something 
like \"further serious failures\" unless ElBaradei\'s report to 
the BOG uses the exact language. 
 
4. (S) Frank suggested that in order to break out of this 
dilemma, the BOG should instruct ElBaradei to prepare his 
reports in a genuinely neutral format.  IAEC favors one that 
would force ElBaradei to organize his findings under some 
half-dozen rubrics, e.g., \"Incomplete Information,\" \"Failure 
to Declare,\" etc.  ElBaradei would then list findings, such 
as Iran\'s undeclared P-2 centrifuge designs, under the 
appropriate rubric without comment.  Frank said the IAEC had 
come up with a short list of rubrics under which all 
information from ElBaradei\'s two most recent reports could 
have been organized.  Frank said some of the French officials 
to whom he pitched the idea liked it, although MFA political 
director de Laboulaye said he preferred having ElBaradei take 
political positions. 
 
5. (S) In response to GOI concerns that Iran would use its 
agreement with the EU-3 to press for removal of its case from 
the BOG agenda, de Laboulaye said, according to Levite, that 
the clear language of the agreement could not be twisted to 
justify such a step.  Levite commented that GOF officials 
appeared uniformly to appreciate the need to maintain 
pressure on Iran.  He said he did not doubt their sincerity, 
given the apparent lack of significant French commercial 
interest in Iran\'s nuclear industry or general market. 
 
6. (S) Levite expressed frustration, however, with what he 
termed the \"fixation\" of GOF officials on internal power 
struggles within Iran, to the detriment of serious thought 
about how to maximize leverage against the Iranian nuclear 
program.  Despite the French role in getting Iran to agree to 
suspend enrichment and reprocessing activities, and an 
apparently genuine French desire to delegitimize Iran\'s fuel 
cycle, GOF officials had apparently not given much thought to 
the precise, practical activities that should be covered by 
the suspension.  The GOF, for example, had expressed no 
objections to Iranian hot cells.  Frank urged the GOF to call 
for Iran to give up its hot cells, especially as French 
companies were interested in meeting Iran\'s need for medical 
radioisotopes. 
 
-------------------- 
Getting to Cessation 
-------------------- 
 
7. (S) According to Levite, GOF officials said they might 
initiate discussions about moving from suspension to 
cessation of Iranian enrichment/reprocessing within 30 days. 
(Where the GOF would launch the discussions was not clear.) 
Use of the word \"cessation\" is, however, causing some 
internal GOF trepidation.  The GOF wants to keep Russia in 
synch with its approach, and Russian Deputy FM Kislyak, while 
supporting cessation as a goal, reportedly has said that he 
believes use of the word \"cessation\" would be premature in 
the near term. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Fuel Cycle Initiative Could Help 
-------------------------------- 
 
8. (S) CEA officials, Levite continued, thought President 
Bush\'s February 11 proposal for controlling fuel cycle 
activities could prove to be an effective way to lock in 
cessation of Iran\'s fuel cycle activities.  MFA nuclear 
nonproliferation official Francois Richier and another GOF 
official, however, expressed doubts about the political 
viability of the President\'s fuel cycle initiative, 
predicting that non-nuclear powers would be reluctant to 
agree to another discriminatory norm.  To achieve the same 
goal of preventing new countries from achieving fuel cycle 
capabilities, they suggested using norms that would 
technically leave the door open to countries developing the 
capability, while setting next-to-impossible requirements, 
such as a strong nonproliferation record, tough economic 
benchmarks, etc. 
 
9. (S) Offering his own view, Frank said he saw no way to 
avoid a discriminatory norm for controlling the proliferation 
of fuel cycle capabilities.  The political viability of the 
President\'s approach could be strengthened by enhancing the 
incentives available to countries that renounce a fuel cycle 
capability, e.g., the provision of power reactors and/or 
assurances to take back spent fuel.  An incentive of 
potentially great value would be assistance in upgrading 
power grids.  Levite expressed concern that possible U.S. 
interest in pursuing FMCT could undercut the President\'s fuel 
cycle initiative by legitimizing the construction of new fuel 
cycle facilities. 
 
----------------- 
Restoring UNMOVIC 
----------------- 
 
10. (S) On Iraq, Frank said his French counterparts wanted 
UNMOVIC to take the lead in verifying the state of Iraq\'s 
nuclear capabilities after the restoration of Iraqi 
sovereignty.  Frank commented that he would be very unhappy 
with a standard safeguards approach in Iraq, given the need 
to address the nuclear knowledge base that already exists 
there.  Levite noted that his GOF contacts very much hoped 
for WMD discoveries in Iraq, and were even critical of what 
they thought were insufficient U.S. efforts to locate Iraqi 
WMD.  In response to the Ambassador\'s skepticism that such 
views represent broad GOF thinking, Levite insisted on his 
point, noting that the GOF desire to reinsert UNMOVIC would 
be complicated by the absence of WMD discoveries by June.  In 
addition, he noted, the French nonproliferation and 
intelligence communities realize that their credibility is on 
the line because they, too, assessed before OIF that Iraq had 
WMD. 
 
----- 
Libya 
----- 
 
11. (S) Frank said discussions of Libya were limited to the 
implications for dealing with proliferation networks.  The 
two sides agreed that PSI provides a useful approach.  Frank 
said the GOI side emphasized that the networks had not yet 
reached the international or financial dimensions of drug 
trafficking.  Dismantling the networks was thus a feasible 
goal.

1.  (C) Summary and comment:  The long-promised GOI removal 
of outposts established after March 2001 suffered another 
setback on March 4 when the Israeli High Court of Justice 
postponed the evacuation of six illegal outposts in the West 
Bank for an additional ten days.  The court will hear the 
settler\'s appeal arguing that the verdict gave the IDF too 
much judicial authority.  Anticipating this result, the IDF\'s 
Advocate General\'s Office had told econoff on March 3 that 
the settlers would appeal the High Court\'s decision the 
following day and the IDF did not expect to be able to move 
on the outposts anytime soon.  The new political/security 
grounds were intended to cut down the legal process to about 
two weeks, but even this new process has now extended into 
its third month.  The practical effect of all of these legal 
processes is that no outposts have been removed since 
December.  Meanwhile, they are growing in size, with the 
assistance and funding of the GOI (reftel A).  End summary 
and comment. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2.  (C) Prime Minister Sharon decided in December 2003 to 
abandon the practice of challenging the establishment of 
illegal outposts on the grounds that they were established 
outside of the proper zoning and building laws.  The legal 
wrangling over building and zoning permits was having the 
effect of dragging out the process to a point that rendered 
the GOI\'s efforts to remove outposts ineffective. 
Accordingly, in December, the PM and the Minister of Defense 
ordered the removal of several outposts based on security and 
political reasons.  At various times, we have been assured 
that the streamlined procedure would take no more than 10-20 
days, including all court appeals. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Outpost Removal Suffers Another Setback 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The High Court of Justice ruled on March 4, that the 
IDF has the specific authority to remove the Hazon David 
outpost near the settlement of Kiryat Arba and the Tal 
Binyamin outpost near the settlement of Ofra.  The ruling 
also would have provided the legal basis for acting against 
at least four other outposts that were ordered evacuated in 
December 2003.  (Note:  The other four outposts are: Havat 
Maon near the settlement of Maon; Bet Iyen West in Gush 
Etzion; Ginot Aryeh near the settlement of Ofra; and Havat 
Shaked near Yizhar.  End note.)  Immediately following the 
High Court\'s ruling, however, the settlers filed an appeal 
claiming that the ruling would give the government, in 
general and the IDF specifically, sweeping judicial authority 
that could have ramifications beyond outpost removal, to 
include the evacuation of settlements.  The High Court agreed 
to consider the appeal and Supreme Court Justice Mishael 
Chesin ordered the IDF to delay removal of these outposts for 
ten days. 
 
4.  (C) The Head of the IDF\'s Advocate General\'s Corp 
Infrastructure Section, Osnat Davidson, had told Embassy 
econoff on March 3, that her office was expecting both a 
favorable opinion for the government on the next day and an 
appeal filing by the outpost petitioners.  Davidson said she 
was not optimistic about the possibility of the IDF resuming 
outpost removals in the near future.  Davidson agreed with 
econoff\'s comment that the PM\'s \"fast-track\" approach 
appeared to face as many legal hurdles as the old building 
code approach (reftel F).  Davidson agreed, saying that the 
settlers could \"drag this process out indefinitely.\" 
Davidson insisted, on the other hand, that court precedents 
set now could make future IDF action less litigious.  For 
example, Davidson said, the court rejected the settlers\' 
claim that their illegal construction activities are being 
focused on in a discriminatory fashion.  This will hopefully, 
she said, not be an issue in future removals.

This message has been cleared by ConGen Jerusalem. 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  In separate meetings this week with Shin 
Bet liaison officers and the head of Israel\'s counter 
terrorist financing effort at the Israeli NSC and the Mossad, 
GOI officials provided some additional details on last week\'s 
raid on Palestinian banks.  The GOI officials rejected the 
criticism that the GOI had not attempted to use PA Finance 
Minister Fayyad as a conduit for handling terrorist financing 
issues.  (Note:  Fayyad told ConGen Economic Counselor that 
he has never been approached by the GOI with actionable 
terrorist financing information since reaching an agreement 
with the PM\'s Chief of Staff Dov Weissglas.  End note.)  They 
also defended the military operation to seize the funds as 
the only effective avenue remaining to them.  Despite these 
statements, the GOI officials appeared eager to find less 
controversial ways of preventing the use of Palestinian banks 
as vehicles for terrorist financing.  (Post Terrorism Finance 
Working Group is developing ideas on better ways to ensure 
effective Israeli/Palestinian engagement on terrorist finance 
cases. see septel.)  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) On March 2, Embassy econoff, Legatt, and FBI special 
agents met with Shin Bet liaison officers Arnon Vinceze and 
Ilan Kosanivich to discuss last week\'s raid on the banks in 
Ramallah.  Kosanivish began by giving the group a readout on 
the actions.  According to Kosanivish, the GOI had 
information on 45 \"association accounts\" related mostly to 
Hamas and information on 250 accounts linked to private 
persons.  Kosanivich said that each of these accounts could 
be traced to specific terrorist activity and that they would 
provide U.S. law enforcement with that information. 
Kosanivich claimed that they did not copy the banks\' hard 
drives and other transaction information on these accounts. 
Kosanivich said that they gathered only the balance 
information from the accounts and then withdrew that amount 
from the banks\' vaults.  They claimed that they took NIS 35 
million from \"association accounts\" and NIS 2.5 million from 
personal accounts.  Vinceze said that all of these accounts 
were funded by direct wire transfers from Jordan, and so 
there was no possibility for the GOI to freeze this money in 
Israeli correspondent banks.  In response to questions about 
why they had not sought to work with the PA on freezing these 
accounts, Kosanivich claimed that the GOI had approached 
Fayyad on two separate occasions regarding accounts connected 
to Hamas, but that Fayyad had not taken action.  (Note:  The 
Shin Bet officials did not suggest that the accounts they 
asked Fayyad to seize were among those affected in last 
week\'s raid, nor did they provide information as to when 
these inquiries were made.  End note.)  Legatt queried the 
officials as to why they decided to act in a way that 
appeared to affect the banks more than the account holders. 
Vinceze said that this would result in terrorists being less 
likely to use the banks as a means of transmitting funds and 
would instead opt for other channels that the Shin Bet is 
more confident in their ability to find and seize.  For 
example, Vinceze said the Shin Bet feels more confident in 
its ability to identify and take action against cash couriers 
than in stopping bank transfers. 
 
3.  (C) Udi Levi, the head of Israel\'s counter-terrorist 
financing effort at the Israeli NSC and the Mossad, told 
Embassy econoff on March 3 that the GOI is eager to work with 
the U.S. and the PA to find less destructive and 
controversial means of combating terrorist funds.  Levi was 
frustrated, however, by what he perceived as past 
unwillingness on the part of Fayyad and the PA to take action 
when given the opportunity.  Levi repeated the Shin Bet\'s 
assertion that the GOI had attempted to use Fayyad as a 
conduit for taking action on suspected terrorist accounts 
during the past year but had been unsuccessful.  Despite the 
past failures of these efforts, Levi said the GOI must 
explore ways to prevent future incidents like last week, but 
in a way that is still effective in combating the illicit 
flow of funds to Palestinian terrorists.  Levi said that GOI 
officials would meet with U.S. and PA officials to explore 
other options.

SWAP; ABSENT PROOF, THE \"SCANDAL\" WILL BLOW OVER 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 580 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Richard LeBaron for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Prime Minister Sharon and his staff have 
forcefully denied the explosive March 3 \"Ma\'ariv\" story 
impugning his motives in the handling of the release of 
Elhanan Tennenbaum as part of the Hizballah prisoner 
exchange.  Contrary to the paper\'s allegation that Sharon was 
influenced by his business relationship 30 years ago with 
Tennenbaum\'s former father-in-law, Shimon Cohen, Sharon Chief 
of Staff Dov Weissglas told the Ambassador that Sharon had 
had no idea of any familial relationship between Tennenbaum 
and Cohen.  Weissglas also cast doubt on the motives of the 
right-wing reporter who broke the story.  Although opposition 
parties are expected to submit no-confidence motions over the 
matter and to demand a commission of inquiry, Sharon\'s 
potential rivals within Likud have fallen into line behind 
him.  Absent any reliable report proving the PM lied about 
his knowledge about the relationship between Tennenbaum and 
Cohen, the story will probably blow over in the coming days, 
especially as Israelis turn to the Purim holiday, effectively 
through Monday.  As one pollster noted, however, the story 
will likely contribute to a growing lack of confidence in the 
PM.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
The Story: An Alleged Connection 
Between Sharon and Tennenbaum 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The popular Hebrew daily \"Ma\'ariv\" created a media 
frenzy with its March 3 \"exclusive\" about a personal 
relationship between PM Sharon and the father-in-law of 
Elhanan Tennenbaum.  Tennenbaum was returned to Israel as 
part of the January 29 Hizballah prisoner exchange (reftel). 
Ma\'ariv devoted the entire front page -- under an apparently 
deliberately ambiguous banner headline that could be 
translated either as \"The Connection\" or \"The Conspiracy\" -- 
and the succeeding six inside pages to the matter.  The story 
contended that Tennenbaum\'s former father-in-law (he is now 
divorced), Shimon Cohen, was a business partner of Sharon in 
the 1970\'s, one of three people responsible for the 
agricultural management of Sharon\'s Shikmim Farm.  Kalman 
Liebskind, who was the lead writer of this piece, stopped 
short of alleging that this personal acquaintanceship 
influenced the PM in his decision making on the prisoner 
exchange deal, but he faulted Sharon for failing to reveal 
the nature of his connection with the Tennenbaum family. 
 
3. (SBU) Reports differ over how recently Sharon may or may 
not have had contact with the now 89 year-old Cohen, and 
whether Sharon knew of Tennenbaum\'s relation to his former 
business partner.  Some reports referred to a \"strong\" 
relationship between the two and cited Cohen as saying that 
the PM was aware of the familial relationship between Cohen 
and Tennenbaum.  Meanwhile, Cohen was quoted in other news 
outlets as saying that he had not stayed in contact with 
Sharon for the past 30 years and that he had forbidden his 
grandchildren (Tennenbaum\'s children) from seeking 
preferential treatment based on his past dealings with 
Sharon.  The most that Liebskind et al. could come up with in 
a March 5 follow-up story was that Cohen was a party to a 
1992 legal dispute about a land deal near Sharon\'s Shikmim 
farm in which Sharon\'s younger son, Gilad, was involved, and 
in which Sharon had intervened. 
 
------------------------------ 
Calls for Sharon\'s Resignation 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) The Ma\'ariv scoop was accompanied by two 
strongly-worded op-eds calling on Sharon to step down.  Dan 
Margalit, who previously called for the PM\'s resignation over 
the David Appel (or \"Greek Island\") affair, gave voice to an 
increasing sense of exasperation with corruption that many in 
Israeli society feel:  \"I used to joke bitterly that 
Tennenbaum must be a partner in the Greek Island enterprise. 
Now it has become apparent that the business relationship 
between Tennenbaum\'s family member and Sharon was stronger.\" 
Ultimately, Margalit faulted Sharon less for his presumed 
favoritism toward Tennenbaum than for his failure to fully 
disclose his ties to Tennenbaum\'s father-in-law, suggesting 
that the incident reflects a deeply flawed culture of 
government. 
 
5. (SBU) Commentator Ben Caspit, who has been critical of 
Sharon in the past but not in the Sharon-bashing style of the 
Israeli left, offered a similar take, suggesting that this 
scandal could be the straw that breaks Sharon\'s back. 
Condemning Sharon\'s alleged failure to disclose his 
relationship with Cohen, he wrote:  \"You didn\'t think that 
this marginal detail, your acquaintance with the family, the 
business ties, was relevant and connected to the issue?  You 
believed that such a thing could remain secret, unknown, 
concealed forever?  Where is the judgment?  Where is the 
decency?  Where is the proper conduct, which is supposed to 
serve as an example to all...?  Is it possible that you don\'t 
even understand this?  If so, it\'s an even harsher problem. 
This is, perhaps, your natural way of thinking.  That is the 
way you picked up the phone in the past, called on the 
director general of the Transport Ministry and tried to help 
your friends from Kfar Malal.  (Note:  Allegedly to secure a 
higher price for land acquired by the GOI.  End Note.)  That 
is the way that you became entangled in further affairs, 
surprisingly similar to one another.....  We have lost our 
faith in you.  We somehow got through the stories, the 
recordings, the photographs, the denials, the silences.... 
We can no longer do it.... Go home, to Shikmim Farm.\" 
 
------------------------- 
Angry Denials from the PM 
------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Speaking privately to the Ambassador, the PM\'s Chief 
of Staff, Dov Weissglas, said that Sharon had no idea that 
Cohen was related to Tennenbaum.  He also cast doubt on the 
motives of the Ma\'ariv reporter who broke the story, pointing 
out that Ma\'ariv had brought the writer on board from \"Mekor 
Rishon,\" a right-wing, settler-oriented newspaper, to help 
balance the perception that its editor-in-chief, Amnon 
Dankner, is too leftist.  Weissglas pointed out that this was 
not the first time Liebskind had concocted a far-fetched 
conspiracy theory about the PM -- a previous story had made 
allegations about business ties between Sharon and the Greek 
Orthodox Patriarch. 
 
7. (SBU) Publicly, too, the PM and his staff wasted little 
time in rebutting the Ma\'ariv story.  The PM\'s bureau issued 
a statement denying that Sharon or anyone in his office knew 
who Tennenbaum\'s father-in-law was at the time of the Cabinet 
discussion of the prisoner exchange.  The statement also 
pointed out that the relationship was short-lived and took 
place 30 years ago.  The PM also refuted the story in 
personal interviews with Israel\'s leading television 
channels, breaking with his long-standing policy of granting 
interviews only on major holidays.  He rejected the 
\"malicious and despicable\" allegations as \"libel.\"  In 
addition, Sharon made an angry, impromptu statement to 
members of the press at the Knesset.  Unnamed officials in 
the PM\'s office dismissed the report as just \"another attempt 
at defamation.\"  Other \"sources\" close to the PM have been 
quoted in the print and electronic media suggesting that the 
Ma\'ariv story represents little more than a far-right attempt 
to discredit Sharon over the Gaza withdrawal plan. 
 
------------------------ 
Politicians Holding Fire 
------------------------ 
 
8. (C) Leading political figures have been, for the most 
part, relatively cautious in responding on the record about 
these latest allegations.  With increasingly damning leaks 
about Tennenbaum\'s unsavory activities (news stories this 
week reported variously on boxes of highly classified 
military documents and forged IDs that Tennenbaum had at his 
home at the time of his abduction, as well as his alleged 
involvement in drug deals and gambling; his fathering of a 
child out of wedlock was also revealed), the whole affair is 
taking on a bit of a foul smell with the Israeli public. 
Press coverage has reminded the public that the cabinet vote 
on the prisoner exchange was extremely close -- 12 to 11 --, 
probably leaving those ministers who voted in favor of the 
deal feeling vulnerable.  (Note:  The GOI did not release a 
list of which ministers voted which way.  End Note.)  A quote 
from an unnamed cabinet official suggests that such ministers 
may be eyeing Sharon, who campaigned vigorously for the 
exchange, as the fall guy:  \"One thing is certain,\" an 
unnamed government minister was quoted as telling Ma\'ariv, 
\"Without Arik Sharon, Elhanan Tennenbaum would still be held 
captive by Hizballah.\"  An Embassy contact in MOD DG Yaron\'s 
office made this same point in private. 
 
------------------------- 
... Including Among Likud 
------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The conventional wisdom is that Labor and other 
opposition parties will treat this scandal as they have the 
previous corruption scandals surrounding the PM -- they will 
continue to pursue (unsuccessfully) no-confidence motions and 
will probably also demand an official commission of inquiry. 
As long as these efforts are relegated to the opposition, 
however, they will have little practical impact on Sharon. 
Thus, the reaction within Sharon\'s own Likud ranks may be 
determinative, and thus far, Sharon\'s principal Likud rivals 
have fallen into line behind him.  Finance Minister 
Netanyahu, Education Minister Limor Livnat, and 
Minister-Without-Portfolio Landau have all stated publicly 
that they do not believe the PM acted out of extraneous 
considerations in the Tennenbaum deal.  Voicing gentle 
criticism, Likud MK Ehud Yatom was quoted on Israel Radio as 
saying that this matter is liable to raise questions and to 
create the impression of concealment.  Other MKs are 
reportedly taking up their concerns, many of which pre-date 
the Ma\'ariv disclosure, in the context of the Knesset 
Subcommittee on Intelligence and Secret Services, demanding 
explanations for the high price Israel paid for Tennenbaum\'s 
freedom. 
 
-------------------- 
Will it Go Anywhere? 
-------------------- 
 
10. (C) As commentator Yossi Verter wrote in Ha\'aretz, only 
\"time will tell whether Sharon dug his own grave\" with his 
denials of knowledge about Cohen\'s relationship with 
Tennenbaum.  \"Any reliable report proving the prime minister 
lied on such a sensitive subject, with such moral, national, 
and security implications, could bring such disgrace upon him 
that it would be impossible for him to continue in office.\" 
Channel 10 political correspondent Raviv Drucker predicted to 
poloff that the whole issue amounted to \"nothing\" -- at least 
\"nothing anyone would be able to prove\" -- and would 
\"disappear\" in a matter of days.   Pollster Dahlia Scheindlin 
shared the view that the initial story was \"overblown,\" 
although she opined that it would contribute to a general 
lowering of Sharon\'s credibility and would fuel the 
perception that political expediency is a factor in Sharon\'s 
policy making.  In fact, a Dachaf poll published on March 5 
showed the percentage of Israelis who consider Sharon to be 
lacking credibility jumped from 51% in early February to 57% 
in early March.  This poll found no direct linkage to the 
Tennenbaum issue, however, with 53% of Israelis accepting 
Sharon\'s motives as \"pure\" in the Tennenbaum/prisoner 
exchange deal.

SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT:

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media reported that Sunday 15 Palestinians were 
killed, including four children under the age of 16, 
and more than 80 Palestinians were wounded during an 
IDF operation in two refugee camps in central Gaza. 
Other than the children, all of the dead were armed men 
(nine Hamas members, one member of Fatah\'s Al Aqsa 
Martyrs Brigades and one member of the Popular 
Resistance Committees).  Israel Radio quoted IDF Chief 
of Staff Moshe Ya\'alon and other IDF sources as saying 
that the troops did not aim at children, and that those 
who died could have been killed by Palestinian fire. 
Leading media reported that the PA denounced a 
\"massacre\" and urged the UN to send observers.  Israel 
Radio quoted Hamas leader Abdelaziz Rantisi as saying 
on Al Jazeera-TV that the Jews are the enemies of the 
believers and that all they had brought to the region 
was rage and pain. 
 
Yediot cited the IDF\'s belief that terrorist attacks in 
the Gaza Strip and West Bank will increase.  Leading 
media quoted Ya\'alon as saying that there could be a 
link between the rise in the number of Palestinian 
attacks and PM Sharon\'s announcement of a unilateral 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.  (Sunday, all media 
reported on a failed combined bombing and shooting 
attack at the Erez crossing Saturday, which was 
thwarted by IDF soldiers and PA policemen.)  Sunday, 
Maariv led with a story that that Hamas is setting up 
an army in the Strip in order to take it over after 
Israel withdraws.  Sunday, all media reported that one 
or two (Yediot) suicide attacks were thwarted in 
Jerusalem during the weekend.  Yediot and Maariv quoted 
Ya\'alon as saying that one of the attacks was funded by 
Iran.  Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that in a 
further attempt to fight spreading anarchy in the 
Palestinian Authority-controlled areas, the PA has 
decided to resume executions of convicted murderers and 
\"collaborators.\" 
 
Sunday, Hatzofe cited the British daily Financial Times 
as saying that the U.S. Administration and the GOI will 
soon agree on Sharon\'s disengagement plan. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Egypt is likely to demand that 
Israel revise security arrangements incorporated in the 
peace agreement between the two countries to allow it 
to beef up deployments in its side of the Gaza Strip 
should Israel withdraw from the \"Philadelphi\" seam area 
around Rafah, thus providing security on the border and 
preventing the smuggling of arms into the Gaza Strip. 
Israel Radio quoted PA Chairman Yasser Arafat\'s 
national security adviser Jibril Rajoub as saying that 
in the next few days there will be consultations 
between Egyptian and Palestinian representatives about 
Israel\'s disengagement plan, and that the Egyptian 
chief of intelligence, Gen. Omar Suleiman, will arrive 
in Ramallah for talks with Arafat.  This morning, 
Israel Radio quoted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as 
saying in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro 
that he rejects the idea of an Egyptian security role 
in the Gaza strip, describing it as a trap that would 
lead to conflict with the Palestinians and possibly the 
Israelis.  All media reported that Egyptian Parliament 
Speaker Ahmad Fathi Srour declined the invitation of 
Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin to address a special 
Knesset session on March 23 to mark the 25th 
anniversary of the signing of the peace treaty with 
Egypt.  Ha\'aretz says that the person most likely to 
represent Egypt at the ceremony is the head of the 
Egyptian Parliament\'s Foreign Relations Committee. 
 
Maariv reported that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
has presented a proposal to resume negotiations between 
Israel, Syria and Lebanon: in a first stage, the three 
countries would pledge to act against violence from 
within their sovereign territory.  The newspaper says 
that the aim of the proposal is to rein in Hizbullah, 
and that Syrian President Bashar Assad accepts the 
offer, but that Sharon has not yet responded to it. 
 
Israel Radio reported that the IDF has presented to 
Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz a binding ethical code 
that will ban the humiliation of Palestinians and the 
use of force as a punishment measure against them. 
 
Leading media quoted State Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg 
as saying Sunday that his office will check the 
\"decision-making processes that preceded the return of 
Elchanan Tenenbaum.\"  This investigation will start in 
the next few days. 
 
During the weekend, all media named the possible 
accomplice of the Haifa father and son who attempted to 
carry out terrorist attacks against Israeli Arabs as 
Yevgeni Grossman, 22, from Ashdod.  All media reported 
that a group of Kach members and supporters of the 
murderer Baruch Goldstein held celebrations Saturday 
and Sunday to mark the tenth anniversary of his death 
and of his massacre of Muslim worshippers at Hebron\'s 
Tomb of the Patriarchs.  Some Goldstein supporters were 
interviewed in the mainstream media. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the United Arab Emirates and the 
family of its president, Sheikh Ziad ibn Sultan are 
funding the repair works of the Dome of the Rock 
compound on the Temple Mount, which are due to begin in 
the coming weeks and to take several months. 
Sunday, Hatzofe quoted Mofaz as saying that the Phalcon 
AWACS deal with India is \"the most significant 
breakthrough in Israeli defense exports.\" 
Ha\'aretz and other media reported that two former 
Israelis -- the brothers Daniel and Abner Nicherie -- 
were indicted in a federal court in Los Angeles this 
weekend on charges of defrauding a couple of some USD 
40 million. 
 
Sunday, leading media quoted U.S. officials as saying 
that the Bush administration is close to imposing 
economic sanctions on Syria for its support of 
terrorist groups and for failing to stop guerrillas 
from entering Iraq. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited a U.S. Energy Department report, 
according to which Israel refuses to return highly- 
enriched uranium it received from the U.S. years ago. 
The report says that the U.S. has been working since 
1996 to recover enriched uranium it had supplied to 
friendly nations in the framework of the \"Atoms for 
Peace\" program. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the joint Israeli-Jordanian 
\"Bridging the Rift\" project in the Arava will include a 
major scientific center that aims to create a 
comprehensive computer databank of genetic information 
on humans, animals and plants.  The newspaper says that 
Cornell and Stanford universities will also develop the 
center. 
 
Maariv reported that the Judea and Samaria College (in 
the West Bank settlement of Ariel) is developing a 
space exploration module in cooperation with NASA. 
Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that Ben Gurion 
University Prof. Richard Israelowitz recently received 
the \"prestigious\" \"Distinguished Scientist Award\" of 
the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse\" (NIDA) for 
his research on immigrant drug abuse. 
 
Ha\'aretz Washington correspondent reported that for 
Arab Americans, the voting trend is \"anyone but Bush.\"

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Stoking an Appetite For Revenge\" 
 
Military correspondent Amos Harel wrote on page one of 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (March 8): \"Is the 
army trying to sabotage Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan?  This suspicion is likely to arise 
in light of yesterday\'s operations by the Israel 
Defense Forces in the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip. 
Just as Sharon is talking about unilateral withdrawal 
from Gaza and [Israel\'s] National Security Council is 
working on plans for such a pullout, the army raids 
camps in the Strip and confronts armed Palestinian 
groups.  The operation ended with 15 Palestinians dead, 
most of them armed men, and no IDF casualties.  As in 
most cases, however, it appears the real reason for the 
operation has to do with inertia, not conspiracy.... 
The operation was carried out Sunday because it is a 
continuation of the IDF\'s policy in Gaza over the last 
two years.... In other words, unlike in the case of the 
Lebanon pullout in the spring of 2000, the army does 
not plan to allow the political leadership to present a 
withdrawal from Gaza as the result of a military 
failure.  The army can meet the challenge, but the 
country\'s political leaders have decided to retreat, 
and the army, of course, will obey.... The Palestinian 
groups are trying to send suicide bombers all the time, 
but there is no doubt that the increase in the number 
of losses on their side, like in Sunday\'s raids, only 
stokes their appetite for revenge.\" 
 
II.  \"In the Mud\" 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote on page one 
of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (March 
8): \"No honest military man would say that the IDF 
operation in the el-Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps, 
or the operation carried out three weeks ago at the 
Sajaiya refugee camp, lead to any kind of solution to 
terror in the Gaza Strip.  These armored operations in 
the refugee camps are, in fact, intended to ensure that 
the IDF and settlers can survive in the Gaza 
Strip-until the government decides where it stands on 
the issue of unilateral disengagement.  Someone has 
thrown a stone into a puddle, and now the army is being 
asked to both contain the shock waves in the swamp and 
to stay clean and fragrant.... The armored operations 
are tactical moves.  The strategic solution to terror 
is not something small-scale, and is subject to the 
decision of the political echelon: a comprehensive 
operation in the Gaza Strip styled after Operation 
Defensive Shield, or reaching a political arrangement 
that will enable the entry of a foreign force -- 
Egyptian, European or any other military force that 
will be willing to take responsibility.  Otherwise, we 
will continue to sink into the mud of the Gaza Strip 
until we are forced to leave with our tail between our 
legs.\" 
 
III.  \"The Trap of the Lack of Trust\" 
 
Liberal op-ed writer Yael Gewirtz opined in a editorial 
in Yediot Aharonot (March 7): \"Even the proponents of a 
withdrawal from Gaza will find it hard to support a 
prime minister who placed his full weight behind the 
release of [Elchanan] Tenenbaum for concealed reasons, 
and without having shown the necessary leadership when 
it became evident that the entire deal proved to be 
complete chaos.  The atmosphere of zero trust at home 
also exacerbates the attitude the U.S. Administration 
has taken towards him.  While Condoleezza Rice has 
spoken about an event even more important than the fall 
of the Berlin wall, Washington has refused to allow the 
wall preventing Sharon\'s political visit there from 
coming down before it receives from him assurances 
about the initiative he wants to launch.  That is the 
miserable situation of the Israeli Prime Minister at 
present, the peak of the trap of the lack of trust that 
he has found himself caught in both domestically and 
abroad.  He is suspected to be a person whose real 
motives are concealed and who assumes limited 
responsibility.  Until proven otherwise, he won\'t be 
getting any additional credit.\" 
 
IV.  \"Discovering France\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in an editorial in Yediot Aharonot (March 
8): \"Relations between Israel and France are warming 
up, slowly but surely.... There are many motivations 
behind the change, starting from fear of the rising 
power of Moslem fundamentalism (within the Arab 
minority living in France as well) and the resurgence 
of anti-Semitism, to the re-examination of the 
traditional and fixated pro-Arab positions of most 
French governments.   It is not the motivations that 
are important, however, but the actual results.  The 
turnabout in Israeli-French relations could lead to 
surprising developments.  Senior officials in the 
Israeli administration now wish to mobilize French 
support for the disengagement plan from Gaza and are 
even willing to think in terms of a joint American- 
French policing force in the Gaza Strip after the IDF 
evacuation.   Due to its prestige among the 
Palestinians, France could be, according to certain 
scenarios, the spearhead that will lead to the 
(necessary) replacement of Arafat at the leadership of 
the Palestinian Authority.  With the U.S. paralyzed by 
an election year, a new French policy could fill the 
void in assisting to formulate an Israeli-Palestinian 
interim arrangement and perhaps even a comprehensive 
Israeli-Arab arrangement.  France is discovering the 
advantages of a balanced policy, and Israel is 
discovering France.\" 
 
V.  \"Disengaging From the Disengagers\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in Ha\'aretz 
(March 8): \"If there aren\'t any stunning surprises, 
U.S. President George W. Bush\'s blessings for the 
disengagement plan will, in the blink of an eye, become 
the kiss of death for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\'s 
government.  This time, he will not have suspenders at 
his disposal in the form of the \'seven days of quiet\' 
that served as charm against the dear departed Tenet 
plan, or in the form of the 14 qualifications that 
chained the dying road map.  After the plan earns 
American trust, it will be impossible to treat it like 
the Mitchell plan of blessed memory, which was 
ostensibly adopted but never won the trust of the 
government of Israel.  The government ministers from 
the National Union will not be able to represent a 
government that has voted in favor of evacuating the 
Jewish settlements from Gush Katif in the Gaza 
Strip.... The behavior of the Jewish settlers\' lobby is 
reminiscent of a child who acts wild in class and keeps 
misbehaving despite all the punishments.  During a 
period of less than 10 years, they have brought about 
the fall of four prime ministers who dared to try their 
hand at non-brutal solutions.\" 
 
VI.  \"Something\'s Changing in Arab Media\" 
 
Former education minister from Meretz, contributor 
Amnon Rubinstein wrote in Ha\'aretz (March 8): \"Media 
outlets in the Arab world are a unique phenomenon -- 
hatred and defamation are a staple, anti-Semitic 
propaganda recalls that of Goebbels, and what 
masquerades as fact is in fact a figment of 
psychopathic imagination.... [However,] when a 
dictatorship collapses, it turns out the facade was as 
thick as paper.  As it turned out, for instance, the 
Soviet puppet regimes in Eastern Europe had no 
supporters.  Can a similar process of popular dissent 
be swelling beneath the surface in the Arab world?.... 
In fact, evidence has started to mount that the 
external facade presented by Arab media is a deception; 
and whenever the belt is loosened a little, new voices 
can be heard in the Arab world (and samples of them can 
be found on the MEMRI, Middle East Media Research 
Institute, site [NB: http://www.memri.org/]).... 
Something is afoot there.  When hundreds of Syrian 
intellectuals sign a petition calling for reforms in 
their country, that\'s hardly a routine occurrence.  In 
terms of Israel\'s interests, it might not be a dramatic 
change, but it\'s important to know that the Arab world 
is not the sum of what\'s written in Cairo, Damascus and 
Ramallah.\"

This message has been cleared by ConGen Jerusalem. 
 
1.  (S//NF) On March 5, the DCM chaired a meeting of mission 
officers involved in terrorist financing issues.  Post 
Economic, Political, FBI, ORCA, and DATT sections 
participated in the meeting, updating most recent efforts in 
working with the GOI on terrorist financing issues. 
 
------------------------- 
Raid on Banks in Ramallah 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (S//NF) Post sections gave an update on recent 
information gathered from GOI interlocutors on the much 
publicized GOI raid on Palestinian banks in Ramallah last 
week.  Econ and Legatt reported that they were briefed by the 
Shin Bet on March 2 regarding the information and money 
confiscated during the raid and details on the situation that 
led up to the raid (reftel A).  Poloff reported on the 
meeting between the Ambassador and the NSC\'s 
Counter-terrorism Chief on March 1 (reftel B) and ORCA gave 
on update on information passed to them by their contacts. 
DAO reported that the IDF would host a briefing on the raid 
for diplomatic defense attaches next week.  Econ reported on 
the efforts of the Embassy and ConGen Jerusalem to follow-up 
on the Palestinian Monetary Authorities (PMA) request to 
establish a cooperative dialogue with Israel\'s Financial 
Intelligence Unit (reftel C).  Embassy econoff spoke with the 
head of the Israeli FIU who has expressed a willingness to 
provide technical support to the PMA.  ConGen Jerusalem has 
passed the Israeli FIU\'s contact information to the PMA. 
 
3.  (C) DCM asked sections to think of ways the USG can work 
with the GOI to prevent a situation where the military is 
called in to conduct asset seizures.  The group agreed that 
establishing better communication between the PA and the GOI 
on terrorist financing should be a priority and that these 
contacts need to be made at the operational and policy level. 
 After last week\'s event, the GOI officials told the 
Ambassador that they want to establish more effective 
communication and in doing so, hope to avoid actions like 
last week.  DCM asked all sections to think of ways to 
improve this dialogue. 
 
------------- 
Ongoing Cases 
------------- 
 
4.  (S) Legatt reported that it is supporting numerous 
missions from the FBI and the Dept. of Justice on ongoing 
terrorist financing cases.  Legatt described cooperation with 
the GOI on these cases as excellent and ongoing.  All 
sections reported hearing from Israeli contacts that funding 
directed to Palestinian groups from Hezbollah has increased. 
DAO reported that IDF and Ministry of Defense contacts are 
drawing parallels between Hezbollah\'s increased activity in 
Israel and in Iraq.  DCM asked sections to look into Israeli 
reports of Hezbollah using Western Union to move terrorist 
funds to Palestinian terrorist groups.  FBI indicated that 
the Israeli information on these transfers comes from 
communication intercepts.  DCM advised Legatt should be in 
lead regarding Western Union issues. 
 
5.  (C) Legatt reported that an FBI team from the U.S. met on 
March 4 with the head of the PMA, Amin Haddad, to evaluate 
the ability of his organization to assist in ongoing and 
future investigations. 
 
----------------------- 
Training and Assistance 
----------------------- 
 
6.  (C) On March 3, the FBI hosted a team of investigators, 
prosecutors, and regulators from the USG who presented 
several seminars to Israeli law enforcement, regulators, the 
Israeli FIU, intelligence, military, and other Israeli 
security organizations.  The team consisted of members of the 
Dept. of Justice, the Dept. of Treasury, the FBI, and the 
Federal Reserve.  The team briefed the Israeli participants 
on the use, effectiveness, and challenges of the Patriot Act 
in dealing with terrorist financing.  The sessions were well 
attended by the Israeli community and Israeli interlocutors 
said that the sessions were useful.

WASHINGTON MEETINGS 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norman H. Olsen for Reasons 1.4 (B) 
and (D). 
 
1.  (C) BG (res) Baruch Spiegel called POL/C to a 
short-notice meeting March 8 to detail the latest steps in 
his assigned effort to address for the MOD measures to 
relieve the problems for Palestinians caused by the 
separation barrier.  He said the advanced timing of the 
meeting was designed to convey to Washington the latest 
developments, on which he had briefed DefMin Mofaz the night 
before, and to offer the USG a chance to raise any questions 
-- now or in the next 48 hours --  on which he should update 
Mofaz prior to the minister\'s Washington meetings later this 
week.  Spiegel also noted, following receipt of a telephone 
call during the meeting, that he would be appearing on 
several television channels that evening to discuss his work 
and the measures he has recommended. 
 
2.  (C) Without himself detailing specific points, Spiegel 
said that press coverage of recently accounced measures to 
professionalize IDF conduct and operations at what will now 
be called the checkpoints, vice roadblocks, is accurate.  The 
measures cited in press announcements include better 
infrastructure, better training of personnel, an IDF code of 
conduct, uniform rules, a \"green line\" for fast passage of 
ambulances, VIPs and vital workers, restroom facilities, 
water faucets and garbage cans.  Further, he said, the fence 
map now looks completely different, with the \"loops\" into the 
West Bank \"postponed\" for now.  These measures, he said, will 
address most of the questions put to him by DAS Satterfield 
and NSC Director Danin during their last visit.  He noted 
that they are also similar to  measures that MOD officials 
discussed with DAPNSA Hadley, A/S Burns and Senior Director 
Abrams during their recent visit. 
 
3.  (C) In addition, seven checkpoints will be updgraded, 
beginning immediately.  The Jerusalem area checkpoints are 
Kalandia, Wadi El Nahar, and what he termed #300 near 
Bethlehem.  He described the others, which he did not name, 
as four checkpoints around Nablus that will remain in place 
for what he termed the time being, leaving open the 
possibility that they might be removed at some unspecified 
point.  Timing of the full renovations will be in months, not 
weeks, given budget and constuction issues and training 
times.  Mofaz, whom he termed \"very informed,\" will be 
prepared to discuss these improvements, although Spiegel was 
not sure whether Mofaz would raise them himself, or would 
simply be prepared to respond to questions. 
 
4.  (C) Spiegel said that other issues under consideration 
are: relocation of some checkpoints along the fence, 
increases in opening times; facilitating transportation for 
Palestinian school children; and addressing the needs of 
Palestinians whose homes are now separated by the separation 
barrier from their lands.  All these issues are now the 
subject of staff work, he said. 
 
5.  (C) On specific issues that the Embassy has raised 
previously with Spiegel, he offered the following: 
 
-- The fence that had run to the east of Baqa al Sharqiya, 
separating it from the West Bank, is being moved to run 
between the Israeli village of Baqa al Gharbiya and the 
Palestinian village of Nazlet Issa, just west of Baqa al 
Sharqiya.  The barrier will have a special gate, manned by 
three Israeli personnel, for the use of members of seven 
families with identified needs to cross regularly, for 
identified persons with \"first class credentials,\" and for 
other individuals with special needs yet to be identified. 
Other people will need to use other crossing points, such as 
the one at Zayteh, to the south, and Reihan, to the north. 
Asked why, if that gate exists and must be manned in any 
event, the GOI would limit passage, Spiegel explained that 
the 37 barrier crossing points planned so far for between 
Salem and Qalqilya will range from limited-use doors or gates 
up to major personnel and cargo transit crossings with 
significant terminal facilities.  For instance, the crossing 
at Jalameh, farther to the northeast, will be a major 
facility, including for cargo transit.  He added that Salem 
crossing point will be limited to unspecified Israeli 
operational needs and will not serve as a regular passage. 
 
-- At Beit Surik, north of Jerusalem, Spiegel is looking at 
proposals to prevent Palestinians from being separated by a 
close-running fence route from several thousand dunams of 
their land on the southern side of the village.  Spiegel 
showed POL/C a map with the present fence route, close to the 
village, and what he described as one alternative: a broader 
loop of fence that runs closer to the Green Line and to the 
Israeli village of Nevasserat.  He pointed to a high point of 
ground northeast of Nevasserat and slightly south of east 
from Beit Surik, identifying it as a critical security 
overlook and a site that would remain on the Israeli side of 
the fence under any circumstances. 
 
-- On the Rosary Sisters school case, where the separation 
barrier runs close to the school and separates Israeli 
students from their homes, Spiegel said he had met with 
school representatives that afternoon and taken with him a 
portfolio of documents to consider. 
 
-- On the Jerusalem barrier overall, Spiegel said GOI 
officials had come to the decision to cease construction in 
those areas where he has identified problems until legal 
issues have been resolved and until remedial measures are 
both identified and ready for implementation.  For instance, 
he said, construction of wall sections will not continue 
without inclusion of necessary crossing points.  Wall and 
gate construction will proceed concurrently.  Kalandia and A 
Ram crossings will be big complexes, he added, and officials 
there are checking house to house before proceeding.

SUBJECT: MILITARY IMPLICATIONS OF A GAZA PULL-OUT 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY: We assess that the threshold for IDF 
conventional ground force action in Gaza following a complete 
Israeli withdrawal, including from the Philadelphia Strip, 
would be substantially elevated.  The loss of IDF-secured 
roads, fortified bases and settlements, and diminished IDF 
tactical intelligence capabilities would create real 
obstacles that ground force commanders would be hesitant to 
confront.  Moreover, the IDF would have to count on facing 
better-armed Palestinians than at present.  In response to 
threats or provocations from Gaza, the IDF would almost 
certainly rely for as long as possible on standoff action, 
especially airstrikes.  Special forces operations would be an 
intermediate step between standoff and ground force actions, 
but they would be hindered by many of the same obstacles as a 
ground invasion.  (This judgment does not necessarily apply 
to Shin Bet operations, which would continue.)  Events that 
would almost certainly trigger some form of IDF strike on 
Gaza include mega-terror attacks by Gaza-based Hamas or PIJ, 
or with some other clear connection to Gaza; the deployment 
from Gaza of standoff weapons with professional 
characteristics (e.g., Katyushas, SAMs, military-quality 
mortars) against targets in Israel; and, the revelation of a 
Karine-A-like smuggling operation. 
 
Note: This is one of three messages by Embassy Tel Aviv with 
initial thinking about the implications of an Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza.  The other two cables address the 
political/institutional and economic implications of 
withdrawal.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (S) Should the IDF withdraw completely from Gaza, 
including from the Philadelphia Strip along the Gaza-Egypt 
border, it would subsequently face significant obstacles to 
sending back ground forces.  Ground force commanders would be 
highly reluctant to lead troops into Gaza without the assets 
they currently enjoy, notably pre-cleared routes of movement 
for attack and withdrawal, and fortified safe areas on bases 
and settlements within Gaza.  Moreover, the good tactical 
intelligence that the IDF currently enjoys by virtue of its 
own eyes on the ground in Gaza would almost certainly be much 
weaker after a full withdrawal.  Ground forces would also 
likely be inhibited by the prospect of facing opponents who, 
after a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, would likely 
be better armed and organized. 
 
3. (S) Based on these factors, the Embassy assesses that the 
threshold for IDF conventional ground operations in Gaza 
would be signficantly elevated after withdrawal.  Any 
conventional ground operation would almost certainly ensue 
only after repeated IDF attempts to deal with threats by 
standoff means, notably fixed wing and helicopter attacks. 
Another possible alternative to a ground campaign would be 
the use of IDF special operations units, but their deployment 
would be inhibited by the same factors militating against 
large-scale ground force operations.  (This judgment does not 
necessarily apply to Shin Bet operations.)  Nevertheless, the 
IDF would be likely to turn to special forces, perhaps 
inserted by sea, before resorting to any larger-scale ground 
operation. 
 
4. (S) A full withdrawal from Gaza would remove, or at least 
significantly reduce, the stigma of occupation associated 
with IDF actions in Gaza.  With a greater feeling of 
legitimacy to respond militarily to provocations from Gaza, 
the IDF will probably show less inhibition about undertaking 
operations likely to cause significant civilian casualties 
and other unintended effects.  The effect of taking more 
risks of killing non-combatants would be compounded by the 
possible greater tendency of the IDF to resort to less 
precise air power following a full withdrawal from Gaza. 
 
----------------- 
Reverse Tripwires 
----------------- 
 
5. (S) The Embassy has identified the following events that 
would almost certainly trigger conventional (air or land) IDF 
action in Gaza.  As noted above, we do not assess that a 
conventional land forces operation would be the first 
response in any case, except perhaps in the event of a 
Palestinian attack that far exceeded the number of casualties 
in any previous attack, or that employed nonconventional 
means.  This list, like those that follow, should not be 
considered exhaustive. 
 
-- A mega-terror attack (at least 50-100 deaths) within the 
Green Line committed by Hamas, PIJ or other Gaza-based group, 
or with some other clear Gaza connection. 
 
-- An attack into Israel, or against an Israeli plane, 
whether successful or not, from Gaza using standoff weapons 
with professional characteristics, e.g., Katyushas or similar 
SSMs, SAMs or (not homemade) mortars.  The launch of such 
weapons into Israel, or against an Israeli plane, would 
likely provoke an IDF response, even without, or with few, 
Israeli casualties.  An attack using unsophisticated standoff 
weapons of the kind already in use (Qassams, home-made 
mortars) would be unlikely to provoke an IDF response if it 
causes no fatalities.  A \"lucky hit\" that causes fatalities 
with these imprecise weapons would probably trigger a 
standoff response, but not more. 
 
-- The exposure of a large-scale arms smuggling operation, 
similar to the Karine-A, involving standoff weapons of 
professional characteristics. 
 
6. (S) Actions more likely to provoke an IDF response would 
include: 
 
-- A significant increase in the presence of Hizballah 
fighters, Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces, or 
al-Qaeda-associated operatives in Gaza. 
 
-- Continuous, small-scale smuggling of the sorts of weapons 
described in para 5 above, as revealed by intelligence 
sources.  Whether the IDF would respond to the presence, but 
non-use, of such weapons is uncertain.  However, we assess 
the probability as very low that Palestinian groups would 
maintain Hizballah-like capabilities with Hizballah-like 
restraint.  In other words, Palestinian groups would almost 
certainly not refrain from trying to deploy a new capability 
almost immediately against targets in Israel. 
 
7. (S) Actions unlikely to provoke an IDF response, but that 
plausibly might do so, include: 
 
-- The political ascent of Hamas. 
 
-- A significant increase in terrorist penetration of the 
fence separating Gaza from Israel. 
 
-- A series of attacks in Israel carried out by terrorists 
smuggled into Israel from Gaza via Egypt. 
 
8. (S) Any combination of events from paras 6 and 7 would 
probably have an increased chance of provoking an Israeli 
response.

Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
(U) ConGen Jerusalem cleared this message. 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  We assess that a complete Israeli 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip is unlikely to result either 
in substantial security turmoil or significant improvement in 
PA governance in the short-to-medium term.  Unlike in the 
West Bank, the IDF does not maintain a presence within Gaza 
population centers, but is instead largely stationed around 
settlements and along borders.  Accordingly, withdrawal will 
have little effect on the existing power structures in those 
areas and will not lead to a power vacuum.  A direct order 
from Arafat for the security services to band together to 
deal with Hamas, the only plausible threat to the PA, would 
probably be effective.  There is some evidence of efforts to 
establish in Gaza joint forces command centers called for in 
the PA security plan (reftel).  Arafat\'s presence in Gaza, in 
the view of nearly all Palestinian contacts, would be of 
immense benefit in imposing order there.  For its part, Hamas 
is probably not interested in taking responsibility for 
governing, and is unlikely to try to seize control from the 
more militarily powerful PA forces through violent means. 
Although Hamas would willingly move into any neighborhoods 
where it perceives a power vacuum, existing power structures, 
whether clans or gangs, are likely to hold onto their turf. 
On the civilian side, performance and delivery of services 
are unlikely to improve, as the current obstacles to PA 
reform are little affected by the Israeli presence in Gaza. 
 
This is one of three messages by Embassy Tel Aviv with 
initial thinking about the implications of an Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza.  The other two cables address the 
military/security and economic implications of withdrawal. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------- 
PA Security - Rally or Rout? 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) We believe the Palestinian Authority has the 
capability and will to prevent Hamas from taking power in 
Gaza after Israeli unilateral withdrawal.  Arafat is likely 
to order the necessary steps to maintain PA power, an 
assessment shared by PLC members Marwan Abdul Hameed and 
Frayh Abu Middayn. 
 
3. (C) There is some evidence now of improved cooperation 
among the PA security forces.  National Security Force (NSF) 
leaders reportedly have begun meeting to establish the joint 
forces command centers called for in the PA security strategy 
(reftel) and to coordinate a unified approach to the Gaza 
security situation. 
 
4. (C) One key variable affecting Arafat\'s ability to manage 
the security situation will be his physical presence in Gaza. 
 Palestinian contacts agreed widely that Arafat\'s presence in 
Gaza would be of immense benefit in imposing order there, as 
there is now, in the words of one contact, \"no political 
power in evidence.\" 
 
-------------- 
Whither Hamas? 
-------------- 
 
5. (C) Hamas, the only faction capable of challenging the PA 
for control of Gaza, is unlikely to do so, in our assessment. 
 Hamas leaders appear to understand that it is easier to 
critique the PA from the sidelines while ministering to the 
population\'s humanitarian needs, than to take responsibility 
for governing.  While Hamas functions well as a humanitarian 
NGO at the neighborhood level, it would be a major 
organizational leap, far beyond its current capabilities, to 
actually govern the Strip.  We believe Hamas will support the 
PA in administration and local government if the PA tries to 
govern effectively.  As one international contact put it, 
\"Now the players know where they stand, keeping things 
relatively stable.\" 
 
------------------------------------- 
PA Governance -- Improvement Unlikely 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The problem, in our assessment, is that Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza will not lead in the short/medium term 
to significant improvement in the performance of PA 
ministries, which suffer from problems deeper than the 
occupation.  Corruption, fragmentation, a lack of funds and 
resistance to reform all militate against positive change. 
As a result, Gaza is most likely to muddle along, with Arafat 
using the \"crisis\" to put off making essential structural 
reforms. 
 
7. (C) Anecdotal evidence indicates that Palestinian 
ministries are strapped for cash sufficient to make even 
minor purchases; lack of fuel for vehicles and repairs of 
office equipment are often cited as two examples. 
Furthermore, the attitude among PA workers is described by 
UNDP/Gaza as one of extreme discouragement; the most commonly 
quoted reason being that the reforms initiated under Abu 
Mazen have ground to a halt.  Contributing to the attitude 
problem is the large number of under-qualified workers added 
to the payroll for political reasons.  According to 
UNDP/Gaza, this problem has a direct, negative impact both on 
the ministries\' ability to make payroll, as well as on the 
quality and quantity of work that actually gets done.  The 
Ministry of Justice was cited by Gaza attorney Sharhabeel 
al-Za\'eem as particularly bad, a view shared by UNDP/Gaza. 
Judges work only a few hours per day, and workers, if 
present, are disinclined to actually do their jobs.  The 
Ministry of Finance, although similarly short on funds, wins 
praise as one of the better functioning entities in the Gaza 
Strip, but contacts say that reforms initiated by the MoF are 
not being supported by the rest of the ministries and 
government offices. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Abandoned Israeli Resources Could Help 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Even if the GOI does not hand over settlements and 
settlements infrastructure directly to the Palestinians, the 
transfer of intact infrastructure to an international 
custodian could have an immediate, positive impact on 
overcrowding and increase the available supply of water to 
Palestinians.  With only about 1,500 housing units in the 
settlements, the impact on overcrowding would not be great, 
but settlements land would become available for construction 
on new housing. 
 
9. (C) To be sure, these resources could prove to be a 
two-edged sword, as the PA wrestles with the challenge of 
securing the settlements and distributing settlements 
resources in an  equitable and efficient way.  The 
settlements could well become a source of serious conflict 
between rival militias and gangs, as well as Arafat cronies. 
As UNDP/Gaza representative Khalid Abdul Shafi put it, the PA 
might \"squander these resources the way they have squandered 
all the rest,\" giving preeminence to Arafat loyalists.  Even 
with a well-organized, transparent and monitored handover, 
corrupt power brokers may gain control of significant chunks 
of the resources. 
 
10. (C) Many contacts note that the many unanswered questions 
regarding Israeli withdrawal are hampering the PA\'s ability 
to plan, although they admit that planning is not the PA\'s 
strong suit.  Some PA contacts expect Sharon to engineer a 
\"dead-of-night departure\" from Gaza in order to provoke chaos 
that would spell the demise of the PA.  True or not, this 
Palestinian assumption may become a new mantra and excuse to 
account for a host of post-withdrawal problems in Gaza.

SUBJECT: ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF GAZA PULL-OUT 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (B) & (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  We assess that an Israeli pull-out from the 
Gaza Strip in and of itself will not result in any major 
improvements in economic and humanitarian conditions in Gaza 
over the short to medium term.  The manner in which the 
pull-out is executed could have an economic impact: leaving 
in the \"dead-of-the night\" is the worst case scenario.  By 
contrast, a coordinated withdrawal, complete with certain 
guarantees from Israel, could set the stage for eventual 
economic recovery in Gaza.  It will make greatest sense for 
the settlements and infrastructure to be handed over to a 
credible, trusted international custodian for a fixed 
transitional period.  Israel should guarantee access to trade 
with Israel and external markets post-withdrawal.  The 
ability of Palestinian laborers to work in Israel is less 
critical but should continue for humanitarian reasons.  The 
donor community will need to retain robust assistance levels. 
 In para 6, we offer specific \"markers\" we might use with the 
Israelis to influence their decision making on 
post-withdrawal economic issues. 
 
Note: This cable is one of three messages by Embassy Tel Aviv 
with initial thinking about the implications of an Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza.  The other two cables address the 
political/institutional and military/security implications of 
withdrawal. End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Pull-Out Will Not Result in Economic Boom 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Economic improvements in Gaza resulting from more 
mobility as a result of a unilateral Israeli pull-out are 
likely to be marginal at best, at least in the immediate 
term.  Overall, mobility restrictions have been fewer within 
Gaza than in the West Bank. The key for Gaza businesses has 
not been their ability to deliver products within the Strip 
but rather getting inputs in from Israel and abroad and 
exporting final products outside of Gaza.  The pull-out will 
have some localized impact, especially as southerners are 
able to access the better labor markets of Gaza City and as 
people from currently enclosed communities are allowed 
freedom to engage in economically productive activities and 
to market and trade goods and services. 
 
3.  (C) We and our contacts do not believe an Israeli 
pull-out will result in increased foreign or domestic 
investment in the short to medium term.  A critical factor in 
investment decisions is the security environment, and given 
the situation of the past few years, we are unlikely to see a 
post-Oslo-like investment bounce, as investors wait and see 
what happens on the ground.  Continued donor assistance, 
particularly large infrastructure projects, will be required 
to be a motor for growth and sustenance of the Palestinian 
economy. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Economic Impacts of Co-ordinated 
or Unilateral Pull-Out 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Economic stability and growth cannot be disaggregated 
from political stability.  Gaza has been in a downward 
security spiral for the past several months with a series of 
high profile clashes and murders and an overall diminishing 
sense of law and order.  Clearly most of the security 
problems within Gaza are due to internal Palestinian power 
struggles and we expect these to continue after the 
withdrawal.  However, there are steps that Israel could take 
which would tip the scales towards more stability.  A 
coordinated versus a unilateral withdrawal is key among those 
measures.  \"Leaving in the dead of night\" is the worst 
possible scenario.  As one contact put it, without 
coordination, people are likely to \"throw themselves against 
the electrified fences\" in order to gain control of the 
settlement infrastructure and resources.  While this contact 
was exaggerating for effect, we do believe that a unilateral 
withdrawal would provoke a serious and probably violent 
competition for settlement resources.  Moreover, unilateral 
withdrawal is also likely to strengthen rejectionist groups, 
thereby feeding into the competition which already exists 
between them and the PA.  Clearly the current security 
environment in Gaza contributes to the poor state of the 
economy.  When we asked over ten economic experts for their 
opinions about post-withdrawal Gaza, all said that Gaza\'s 
economic future depends, first and foremost, on what happens 
politically.  Israel\'s withdrawal should be managed in a way 
that promotes improved security, or at a minimum, does not 
actively contribute to further deterioration. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Trade Access is the Key to Economic Survivial 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  It is imperative that following the Israeli 
withdrawal trade access to Israel and other external markets 
be expanded and improved.  If Israel were to implement a full 
economic disengagement and close the border, there would be 
an economic/social catastrophe.  Karim Nashishibi, IMF 
representative, predicted this scenario would lead to \"riots 
in the streets, food shortages, you name it.\"  According to 
officials from both the World Bank and the Fund, were the GOI 
to cease allowing Gazans into Israel for work, there would be 
little impact on the broader economy -- this because the 
workers are so few compared to the population size. 
Nevertheless, this program does provide wages for roughly ten 
thousand individuals and their families per day.  Israel 
therefore should be encouraged to continue this program on 
humanitarian grounds.  In addition to a coordinated 
withdrawal, Israel should turn over the settlements and their 
infrastructure intact to a trusted, transparent, credible 
international custodian for a fixed transition period. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Keeping the Status Quo is Not Good Enough 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) If Israel were to take the steps outlined above - 
coordinated withdrawal, keep borders open, and continue 
allowing workers into Israel - we could expect a continuation 
of the grim status quo.  However unemployment at over 30 
percent and poverty in excess of 60 percent is not 
sustainable and maintaining the status quo should not/not be 
our goal.  We offer the following suggestions as \"markers\" 
that Washington might wish to use in discussing withdrawal 
plans with GOI interlocutors: 
 
A.  Trade 
 
-- Ensure access to external markets (including the West 
Bank) and ability to 
import inputs and other goods.  Specifically, improved 
operations at Karni 
crossing, re-opening the airport, including building cargo 
facilities and 
reinvigorating work on Gaza seaport. 
 
-- Work to expand trade with Egypt and region as a whole. 
 
-- Establish infrastructure and systems to allow goods to 
pass through Rafah. 
 
B.  Investment/General Growth 
 
-- Agree to Gaza gas project. 
 
-- Re-allow Israeli investors into the Gaza Industrial Estate 
with appropriate 
security arrangements.  Consider having a third party private 
company take over 
logistics and security at Karni and the GIE in order to 
improve efficiency and 
address Israeli security concerns. 
 
-- Continue robust donor assistance, particularly investments 
in 
infrastructure. 
 
-- Allow fishing along length of Gaza Strip up to full 20 
nautical miles 
stipulated by Oslo. 
 
-- Ensure complete internal freedom of movement. 
 
C. Settlement Disposition 
 
-- Coordinate the pull-out with a group comprised of PA 
officials, civil 
society, and international actors. 
 
-- Turn over the settlements to a credible, trusted 
international custodian for 
a fixed transitional period. 
 
-- Turn over settlement infrastructure intact.  Don\'t \"scorch 
the earth.\" 
 
-- Facilitate continuation of existing marketing and 
transport arrangements for 
goods produced in settlements 
 
D.  Economic Cooperation 
-- Continue and improve current coordination on 
trans-national issues such as 
water and electricity. 
 
-- Continue/strengthen cross-border industrial parks. 
 
-- Continue, and ideally, increase the number of workers in 
Israel.

This cable has been cleared by ConGen Jerusalem. 
 
1. (C) Summary:  On Saturday, March 6, four suicide bombers 
who were apparently en route to Erez crossing detonated 
prematurely, killing themselves and two PA security officers. 
 Eighteen persons were injured as a result of the explosion 
and/or return fire from the IDF.  On Sunday March 7, the IDF 
staged a large-scale incursion into the adjacent Bureij and 
Nuseirat refugee camps and met with significant resistance 
from armed militiamen and other camp residents.  As a result 
of the fighting, 14 Palestinians died, including nine Hamas 
members and three youth civilians, all under age 15.  No 
Israeli injuries resulted from the incursion.  Gaza contacts 
expressed dismay that militants continue to target Erez 
crossing, noting that it only increases the hardships for 
laborers.  However, public criticism of acts of \"resistance\" 
remains taboo.  Regarding the camp incursion, many saw 
inconsistencies between what they view as \"heavy-handed\" IDF 
tactics, and the GOI\'s announced withdrawal plans.  Contacts 
predicted that both Palestinian militants and the GOI would 
continue to \"hit one another\" in order to ensure that neither 
was able to \"claim the victory\" post-withdrawal.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Erez - Public Unhappy About Target, But Taboo to Criticize 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
2.  (C) On March 6, militants attempted a sophisticated 
attack, driving two explosive-laden jeeps, disguised to look 
like IDF vehicles, towards Erez crossing.  According to 
UNRWA,  the first jeep approached an IDF position and 
militants opened fire on the soldiers.  The soldiers returned 
fire, killing the militants.  The second jeep exploded 
(apparently prematurely) near the Palestinian checkpoint, 
killing the two militants inside and two members of the 
Palestinian National Security Forces (NSF).  The IDF 
responded by directing heavy fire towards the Palestinian 
position.  A total of eighteen persons were injured, 
including twelve security officials and a five-year-old boy 
as a result of the explosion and/or return fire from the IDF. 
 Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and Al-Aqsa brigades 
claimed responsibility for this coordinated attack.  The GOI 
closed Erez crossing after the attack. 
 
3.  (C) Gaza contacts reported that most ordinary Gazans were 
dissatisfied with the militants\' apparent decision to target 
Erez crossing over the past few months.  Everyone knows, they 
said, that these actions will have a negative impact on the 
workers and any other Palestinian needing to use that 
crossing.  Journalist contacts Tagrid El-Khoudary (N.Y. 
Times) and Saud Abu Ramadan (Reuters) said that there was 
lots of grumbling on the street, in grocery stores, and 
throughout the community as people predicted bitterly that 
workers would again lose several days worth of wages.  When 
pressed, however, El-Khoudary said that all shied from 
criticizing the militants directly and placed blame squarely 
upon Israel for the occupation.  Salah Sakka, a member of the 
Gaza municipal council, said, \"Even though we all disagree 
with that target, no one would dare to complain.  We are all 
afraid of the militants and, in addition, we do not want to 
be viewed as traitors.\" 
 
4.  (C) Asked whether such attacks, which have such a direct 
and clear negative impact on ordinary Palestinians, were 
likely to weaken support for the militant groups, contacts 
replied, \"no.\"  El-Khoudary noted that the militant groups 
did attempt to ward off any potential backlash from the 
public by noting that they \"deliberately\" chose a day 
(Saturday), on which no workers would be present, in order to 
avoid accidentally harming them in the explosion. 
 
5.  (C) PLC member Ziad Abu Amr, speculated that militants 
have switched to attacking Erez, as opposed to settlements 
for example, merely because it is easier.  Gaining access to 
Erez is much more feasible than attempting to penetrate 
settlement security.  A successful attack at Erez is also 
likely to result in higher Israeli casualties, he opined. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
IDF Incursion - 14 Palestinians Killed; Hamas Vows Revenge 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
6.  (C) On Sunday, March 7, the IDF staged an incursion into 
El-Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps.  According to DAO 
sources, the purpose of the operation was to strike at an 
area known for launching mortar and anti-tank fire.  DAO 
sources said that Palestinians responded aggressively with 
numerous armed men moving to engage IDF forces with anti-tank 
rocket fire and grenades.  Since the first of March, there 
have been fourteen mortar attacks from Gaza, but no injuries 
or significant damage. 
 
7.  (C) As a result of the fighting, fourteen Palestinians 
were killed -- nine Hamas members, one Palestinian Resistance 
member, and four civilians, including three children.  Dozens 
of others, mostly youth, were injured.  The Israeli press 
reported widely that the incursion, which began in the early 
morning hours, was meant to be brief.  The IDF was compelled, 
however, to stay longer than anticipated when a tank became 
temporarily disabled, according to these reports.  The fact 
that the IDF was still present in the area when the 
work/school day began likely contributed to increased 
casualties, particularly among the youth.  The nine-year-old 
boy who was killed, for example, dressed in his school 
uniform and told his mother that he was going to school. 
Instead of going to classes, however, he went to the scene of 
the still on-going clashes where he was killed.  DAO sources 
did not report a disabled tank, however analysts said the 
scenario reported in the press seemed \"plausible.\" 
 
8.  (C) El-Khoudary interviewed a family whose home the IDF 
used for sniper positions.  El-Khodary reported that the 
incursion was unexpected.  The IDF allegedly \"invaded\" the 
home and locked 20 members of the family into one room.  Once 
released, the family purportedly found their home 
\"ransacked\", their garden \"mangled\", and several items of 
jewelry and cash missing. 
 
9.  (U) Contacts reported that there was \"a lot of anger\" in 
the streets as funerals concluded on March 8.  Many 
questioned why Israel would attempt such a large-scale 
operation at a time when PM Sharon has announced his 
intention to withdraw from the Gaza Strip.  In their public 
statements, both Hamas and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades promised 
to exact a \"painful\" revenge, for the operation and both 
linked the U.S. and Israel in their vituperation.  Hamas went 
so for as to allege that the U.S. \"approved\" Israel\'s 
incursion. 
 
------------------- 
And Where\'s the PA? 
------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Gaza contacts universally dismissed the role of the 
PA in responding to the incursions.  One contact said, \"The 
PA does not exist in Gaza.\"  Palestinian national television 
covered the incursions extensively but broadcast only 
interviews from low-ranking PA officials, according to 
contacts.  Salah Sakka said that listening to the PA after 
these incursions is akin to pressing the \"play\" button on a 
tape recorder:  The PA condemns the \"massacre;\" then urges 
citizens to keep the faith and uphold the resistance. 
Although the top Hamas leaders did not grant interviews due 
to concerns for their personal security, Hamas did stage a 
large rally in the camps. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Israel and Palestinians - Scoring Points Before Withdrawal? 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
11.  (U) Both Israeli and Palestinian media are replete with 
speculation that the GOI is attempting to \"hit Gaza hard\" 
before withdrawal so that it is not seen as \"leaving with its 
tail between its legs.\"  Outgoing IDF commander Brigadier 
General Gadi Shamni was circumspect in a March 8 interview 
carried by the left-leaning daily, Ha\'aretz.  Shamni 
emphasized that withdrawal decisions were up to the political 
echelon and the IDF would continue carrying out its mission 
until those decisions were finalized.  Shamni, however, 
emphasized that the IDF was \"winning and had no problem 
continuing to fight.\"  Shamni added that \"IDF pressure would 
continue to increase,\" the extent of military pressure being 
an important element in \"dealing with terror.\" 
 
12.  (C) PLC member Abu Amr averred that both Israel and the 
militants may be \"trying to score points\" with each, 
determined that the other not walk away in triumph following 
the withdrawal.  Abu Amr said that militants are trying to 
send a message to both Israel and the PA.  He said to Israel, 
the message is that the withdrawal must be more than a 
security arrangement.  It must be part of a broader political 
agenda; otherwise attacks will continue.  To the PA, the 
attacks represent a jockeying for power.  The attacks say 
that we (the militants) will not be ignored and we must be 
brought into national political arrangements following the 
withdrawal. 
 
13.  (C) Abu Amr questioned the motivations behind the 
incursion and other recent Israeli actions which he viewed as 
\"heavy handed.\"  There was no \"ticking bomb\", he said.  This 
incursion was not \"necessary\" at this time.  If Israel 
intends to withdraw from Gaza and \"wash her hands\" of 
negotiations with the PA, then these sorts of actions \"make 
sense\", he said.  They represent one last show of force. 
However, if the withdrawal is meant to set the stage for 
broader negotiations, then they are absolutely the wrong 
tactic, he stressed.  There is no doubt that at the first 
available opportunity, Hamas will respond; and then Israel 
will counter-attack.  This is the wrong environment to foster 
if our goal is to begin negotiating with one another again, 
he concluded.

SUBJECT: USING THE JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE TO PROMOTE OUR 
TRADE AGENDA WITH ISRAEL 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer, Reasons: 1.4(B) and (D) 
 
From Ambassador Kurtzer to Assistant U.S. Trade 
Representative Cathy Novelli. 
 
 
1. (C) I encourage Washington to convene a meeting of the 
Joint Economic Committee (JEC) as soon as possible.  Our 
combined efforts to focus Israel on our trade and investment 
concerns are beginning to pay dividends.  A new agricultural 
agreement that will increase access to U.S. agricultural 
products is a concrete result.  The GOI may also finally 
recognize that it cannot avoid tackling the contentious issue 
of pharmaceutical data protection.  Recent visits by Under 
Secretaries of State, Commerce and Treasury all drove home 
 
SIPDIS 
the importance of dealing with the trade deficit and taking 
action on IPR, procurement practices, and the use of 
technical standards as non-tariff barriers.  The GOI is 
getting the message, not only from the USG here and in 
Washington, but also from the U.S. private sector via the 
AmCham\'s forum of U.S. companies in Israel and its four 
subcommittees which are pressing on all these issues.  I will 
be meeting Minister of Industry and Trade Olmert next week, 
at his request, to consider ways to solve some of these 
problems. 
 
2. (C) A JEC meeting would allow us to capitalize on this 
momentum, perhaps bring to closure some issues where we\'ve 
begun to see movement, and to further press on longstanding 
concerns that the GOI has failed to adequately address. 
Issues that need to be discussed include: 
 
--An Israeli technical standards regime that often favors 
European firms over American suppliers; 
 
--Lack of transparency and poor procedures in government and 
para-statal procurement that make it very difficult for U.S. 
firms to have a fair shot at contracts; 
 
--Israel\'s failure to clarify how it intends to deal with the 
data protection issue; and 
 
--The GOI\'s apparent intention to deny national treatment to 
U.S. recording companies under its new copyright law.  This 
could easily erupt into a serious bilateral dispute. 
 
3. (C) The GOI hopes to get something in return for any 
improvements it offers.  The GOI fears that our new FTAs with 
other trading partners will mean their exports will face 
intensified competition in the U.S. market.  In an effort to 
strengthen its position vis--vis our new FTA partners, 
Israel would like to latch onto these agreements through 
favorable rules-of-origin treatment.  We expect the GOI to 
broach this issue whenever we raise our trade concerns.  A 
JEC meeting now will allow us to frame the parameters of the 
discussion, and keep us on the offensive. 
 
4. (C) Identical, coordinated messages from both Washington 
and Embassy have been key to getting the GOI to understand 
the seriousness of USG concerns.  The JEC will allow us to 
reinforce the message that Washington and Tel Aviv are 
speaking with one unified voice on trade matters, and will 
strengthen the value of all USG messages on trade, whether 
delivered in Washington or in Israel. 
 
5. (C) The last meeting of the JEC took place in 2001.  Our 
trade agenda is now sufficiently full, and thus the time is 
now ripe to proceed with one of the most important JECs in 
recent memory.  We look forward to continuing the productive 
cooperation that has brought us this far, and we stand ready 
to assist in the preparation of a JEC meeting on short notice.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Last night, Channel 2-TV reported that PM Sharon is 
\"enraged\" with IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Ya\'alon, whom 
he accuses of having caused \"enormous\" damage and of 
\"blatantly intervening in political matters and trying 
to influence ministers.\"  Ha\'aretz reported that 
Sharon\'s bureau later denied the report.  All media 
cited remarks Ya\'alon allegedly made against a 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip \"under fire.\"  Yediot 
reported that the political Right sides with Ya\'alon, 
while the Left claims that he should not discuss the 
disengagement plan. 
 
Maariv (Ben Caspit) reported that top Sharon aide Dov 
Weisglass will leave for Washington only if Sharon 
gives \"satisfactory\" answers about his disengagement 
plan to the U.S. team arriving on Thursday (Stephen 
Hadley and Elliott Abrams from the White House and 
William Burns from the State Department).  Maariv 
wrote: \"Washington is demanding many goods of Sharon in 
exchange for very little.\"  Leading media reported that 
Shin Bet head Avi Dichter has arrived in Washington to 
meet with senior U.S. intelligence and National 
Security officials.  Yediot quoted him as saying that 
it is doubtful whether the disengagement plan will 
prevent Palestinian terrorism.  Israel Radio\'s 
Washington correspondent says that the U.S. decision- 
makers view Dichter as an authority on doings in the 
PA, who has no political slant and is not attempting to 
promote or thwart plans by Sharon.  Hatzofe quoted Vice 
PM Ehud Olmert as saying in Berlin Monday, following 
his meeting with German FM Joschka Fischer, that Israel 
is committed to the road map and that, should there be 
a need for them, Israel would take unilateral steps for 
that purpose. 
 
Jerusalem Post led with a statement issued by Hamas 
Monday that it would continue its attacks on Israel 
even after the planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, 
in order to \"liberate the rest of Palestine.\"  The 
movement also denied reports that it is planning to 
seize control of the Strip after Israel withdraws. 
Leading media cited Hamas\'s admission that it had 
carried out the bombing of the Mike\'s Place pub in Tel 
Aviv in April 2003.  Maariv reported that instructions 
for building Qassam rockets are posted on the Izzedine 
Al Qassam (Hamas military branch) web site. 
 
Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres was quoted as saying 
in various media interviews that Israel\'s mistake had 
been not to pull out from the Gaza Strip long ago. 
Hatzofe reported that uprooting the Gaza Strip 
settlements would cause economic harm to 30,000 
Palestinians. 
 
Yediot and Israel Radio quoted State Department 
Spokesman Richard Boucher as saying Monday: \"We do 
recognize Israel\'s right to defend itself against 
terrorism -- terrorist attacks, and we always urge 
Israel to consider the consequences of any actions it 
might wish to take.  But we also urge the Israeli 
government to take all appropriate precautions to 
prevent death or injury of innocent civilians or damage 
to civil and humanitarian infrastructure.   At the same 
time, we believe the best way to move forward is for 
the Palestinian Authority to begin by making an effort 
against terror and violence, an effort that\'s far more 
serious than the one that they have made over the past 
few years.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz reported on the growing discontent of Shinui 
ministers and Knesset members over the government\'s 
policy.  The latest reason for their disgruntlement is 
that they feel affected, as coalition members, by 
criticism of Sharon\'s handling of the Elchanan 
Tenenbaum affair. 
 
Maariv reported that Knesset security marked the hard 
hats of Israeli Arab construction workers at the 
Knesset\'s construction site with X signs.  The 
newspaper says that this is done so that that they can 
clearly be monitored and differentiated from foreign 
workers.  The newspaper cited strong protests by 
Israeli Arab Knesset members. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that highlighting his concern 
with the rise of anti-Semitism worldwide, Secretary of 
State Colin Powell told Jewish leaders from the World 
Jewish Congress (WJC) that he may attend a conference 
on the issue, hosted by the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) next month in Berlin. 
The newspaper also reported that Powell expressed 
interest in backing an Irish-sponsored resolution that 
unequivocally condemns anti-Semitism, which was 
withdrawn near the end of the UN\'s annual General 
Assembly session after several Arab and Muslim 
countries voiced their objections to its message. 
Jerusalem Post also reported that Powell told the WJC 
leaders that the U.S. opposes any Iraqi legislation 
excluding Jews or others from restoring their 
citizenship, and that no such discrimination was 
written into the new Iraqi constitution. 
 
Leading media reported that Gen. Tommy Franks, the 
retired head of CENTCOM, is visiting Israel.  Some 
media noted that he came to mark the beginning of the 
joint Israeli-Jordanian Bridging the Rift science 
project in the Arava.  Yediot quoted him at saying 
Monday at a meeting with the top brass of the IDF and 
the defense establishment: \"I do not think Iraq will 
turn into a peaceful nation in my lifetime. \"  The 
newspaper also quoted him as saying that if the U.S. 
knew the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, he would 
already have been dead.  Jerusalem Post quoted Franks 
as saying that he supports the disengagement plan. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited Palestinian claims that Monday two 
Palestinians were killed by the IDF in the Gaza Strip 
and the West Bank.  Leading media reported that 
hundreds of Palestinian villagers, backed up by 
International Solidarity Mission volunteers from 
overseas, clashed with IDF forces protecting the 
bulldozers working on the route of the separation fence 
near Beit Lakiyeh and Beit Daky, not far from the 
settlement of Mevo Horon, northwest of Jerusalem.  Ten 
Palestinians were reportedly wounded and a soldier and 
two of the workers on the fence suffered light wounds. 
Leading media reported that drunken ultra-Orthodox Jews 
attacked Arab cab drivers and Israeli policemen in 
Jerusalem during the Purim holiday Monday. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that at his first meeting with 
Palestinian PM Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) Monday, British PM 
Tony Blair urged him to meet with Sharon.  Ha\'aretz 
also reported that despite the statements of senior EU 
and British officials, Hamas\'s political wing has not 
been added to the British and EU lists of proscribed 
international groups. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Monday the right-wing group The 
Temple Mount Faithful petitioned the High Court of 
Justice to order the Israel Antiquities Authority to 
supervise projects taking place on the Temple Mount. 
The supervisors say that the projects, carried out by 
the Waqf Muslim religious trust, are \"the continuation 
of the mount\'s Islamization and the removal of all 
Jewish remnants from it, while destroying and robbing 
everything, in violation of the law, in an essentially 
Jewish place and a cultural cradle to the entire 
world.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz and Yediot reported that next week four 
representatives of the Israeli conscientious objectors 
network will appear before the European Parliament in 
Strasbourg, where they will speak out against the \"the 
GOI\'s double game, presenting itself as the only 
democracy in the Middle East, while \"trampling on basic 
democratic values in the occupation, or throwing 
conscientious objectors into jail.\"  Ha\'aretz notes 
that the trip is being sponsored by the United Left, a 
group of leftist parliamentarians from various European 
countries. 
All media reported on the signing of the interim Iraqi 
constitution Monday.  Israel Radio reported that the 
U.S. protested to Syria about the brief detention of an 
American diplomat who was monitoring a human rights 
demonstration on Monday. 
Ha\'aretz reported that the Arab League plans to set up 
Pan-Arab institutions: a parliament, a security council 
and a tribunal. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited the results of Tel Aviv University\'s 
Peace Index poll: 
-64 percent of Israeli Jews believe that Israel should 
not take into account the suffering caused to the 
Palestinians by the route of the fence; 17 percent of 
Israeli Arabs hold the same view. 
-70 percent of Israeli Jews support the continuation of 
the assassination policy as a necessary measure to 
reduce acts of terrorism; 4 percent of Israeli Arabs 
have the same view.

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote on page one of independent, left-leaning 
Ha\'aretz: \"If Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had provided 
greater clarity about his disengagement plan in Gaza 
and Judea and Samaria [i.e. the territories], he might 
have avoided the many critical remarks he\'s hearing -- 
and not only from the army and the defense 
establishment.\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in Ha\'aretz: 
\"When it comes to the influence of political 
calculations on foreign policy and especially the 
influence of the Jewish lobby on Middle East policy, 
American presidents in their second and last term are

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"The Generals Prefer Coordination\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote on page one of independent, left-leaning 
Ha\'aretz (March 9): \"If Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had 
provided greater clarity about his disengagement plan 
in Gaza and Judea and Samaria [i.e. the territories], 
he might have avoided the many critical remarks he\'s 
hearing -- and not only from the army and the defense 
establishment.... The current dispute appears to stem 
from a belief among the general staff, including the 
Chief of Staff and key generals, that Israel should be 
striving for an agreement with the Palestinians 
requiring them to take responsibility in various areas, 
instead of undertaking a unilateral disengagement. 
They think a unilateral move practically guarantees the 
fighting will continue, and the Palestinians will 
regard a unilateral move as their victory, so they will 
go on wanting to fight.  Senior officers say that if 
the government wants the disengagement plan to work, 
there must be prior coordination with the Palestinians 
and others.  But Sharon doesn\'t want that.  Some are 
even prepared for \'soft\' international involvement, 
which Sharon certainly cannot accept.... There is also 
criticism of the way Sharon\'s unilateral disengagement 
plan basically throws out much of what the army regards 
as the achievements of Operation Defensive Shield.  A 
disengagement without any agreement will turn into 
withdrawal under fire and certain continued conflict.\" 
 
II.  \"Meanwhile, the Only Disengagement Is Bush From 
Sharon\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in Ha\'aretz 
(March 9): \"[Seeing Bush] talking with Sharon about 
giving territory to the Arabs will not please the 
conservatives and evangelist contributors.  The White 
House has told the Prime Minister\'s Office that no Jew 
will be evacuated from Gaza before the presidential 
election.  That\'s all Bush needs -- American TV cameras 
showing his Middle East vision being trampled by Arabs 
charging into abandoned settlements, and how his road 
map disappeared behind the smoke of American flags 
going up in flames in what remains of Netzarim [in the 
Gaza Strip].  Apparently, the most convenient way out 
of the problem is to postpone the meeting with Sharon 
until after the elections.  If he wins.  Meanwhile, to 
save the honor of his vision and leave something of the 
road map, Bush has to constrain Sharon, meaning make 
sure the Prime Minister does not turn Gaza First into 
Gaza Last.  The campaign advisers are recommending he 
keep things vague.  After all, how many voters in 
Florida care that Palestinian Finance Minister Salam 
Fayyad left Washington last week with an American 
promise that the withdrawal will also include territory 
in the West Bank?  According to a classified report 
reaching Jerusalem, Fayyad got the promise straight 
from National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and 
Secretary of State Colin Powell.  He convinced them 
 
SIPDIS 
that an Israeli disengagement only from Gaza could 
perpetuate the occupation in the West Bank and 
eliminate any chances for a peace agreement.... When it 
comes to the influence of political calculations on 
foreign policy and especially the influence of the 
Jewish lobby on Middle East policy, American presidents 
in their second and last term are very different from 
what they were as brand new presidents.\" 
 
III.  \"The Routine of Death\" 
 
Ha\'aretz editorialized (March 9): \"Experience shows 
that operations in the heart of the densely populated 
areas of the Gaza Strip end routinely with the deaths 
of innocent civilians.  Often, the operations are 
indicative of faulty judgment, if not utter 
indifference, in the uppermost political and military 
echelons.  They don\'t take into account the long-term 
damage when a civilian population is terrorized for the 
sake of the temporary achievement of \'provoking armed 
men into exposing themselves\'.... The argument that the 
Palestinians have no compunctions about using children 
as \'human shields\' does not absolve the IDF of 
responsibility for their safety.  On the contrary.... 
The time has come for the makers of policy and those 
who implement it to drop the illusion of a military 
solution to the conflict; until a political solution is 
found, they should take care to make wise and 
controlled use of force.  Israel\'s moral, security and 
political resilience is not measured by the balance of 
death and terror in Gaza and Jerusalem.  The 
preparations for disengagement from parts of Gaza and 
the West Bank must be accompanied by an effort to calm 
the borders with our neighbors and break out of the 
cycle of violence.\". 
 
IV.  \"Better Stay in Gaza\" 
 
Nationalist writer Hagai Segal commented in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (March 9): \"Even if Israel evacuated 
[the settlements of] Gush Katif and Netzarim, it would 
have to continue operating [the Erez Crossing], because 
it\'s impossible to imprison 1.2 million Arabs behind a 
fence without gates and to tell them to live in 
autarchy.... Poverty would quickly develop to African 
proportions.  The entire world would scream ... and 
demand that Israel lift the siege.... Furthermore, 
transferring Gaza from Israeli to Egyptian rule would 
mean changing one occupation for another; even the Left 
would find it morally hard to explain such a move.... 
The Erez Crossing could turn into an escape route for 
refugees, but in an opposite direction [i.e. into 
Israel].  Wouldn\'t the current situation -- no matter 
how tough it is -- be better?\" 
 
V.  \"Stateless in Jerusalem\" 
 
Veteran journalist Evelyn Gordon wrote in conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post (March 9): \"Congress enacted 
an explicit law in 2003 stating that if an American 
citizen is born in Jerusalem, \'the Secretary [of State] 
shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizen\'s 
legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel.\' 
Nevertheless, the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv refused to 
register [a] baby\'s birthplace as Israel.... The extent 
of the bias is even more astonishing, however, when one 
considers State\'s claim, expounded in its response to 
the lawsuit [filed by the baby\'s parents in an American 
court], that non-recognition of Israeli sovereignty 
over Jerusalem is so central to American policy that 
the 2003 law would constitute an unconstitutional 
infringement on the executive\'s right to set foreign 
policy unless the court reinterpreted the \'shall\' in 
the law to mean \'may\' -- thereby allowing State to 
continue refusing to register people born in Jerusalem 
as born in Israel.... Thus State is perfectly willing 
to subordinate American foreign policy to the 
individual\'s wishes if the goal is to deny Israeli 
sovereignty.  Only if an individual wishes to affirm 
Israeli sovereignty does foreign policy suddenly become 
sacrosanct.  That, it seems, is State\'s idea of an 
\'even-handed\' approach to the conflict.\"

\"The Birth of Iraqi Democracy\" 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 9): \"Freedom and independence rarely come 
without a struggle, as Americans and Israelis know. 
The road ahead for Iraqi democracy is a long one and 
the outcome is not guaranteed.  Monday\'s signing [of 
the interim constitution], however, was undoubtedly an 
historic moment in the history of Iraq, the Middle 
East, and the world.... This is a proud moment for 
Iraqis and for the United States, which made it 
possible.   We should not lose sight of where it is 
taking place.... Bernard Lewis, the eminent scholar of 
the Islamic world, once noted the strange fact that the 
Europeans who oppose American pressure on Arabs to 
democratize are considered the \'friends\' of the Arab 
world.  They are not.  They are friends of Arab 
despots, not the silenced millions they rule.  Monday, 
Iraqis showed that Arab democracy need not be a 
contradiction in terms.  The region\'s future depends on 
the success of Iraq\'s bold experiment.\"

U.S. WILL PROVIDE ASSURANCES 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
. 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Foreign Minister Shalom told the Ambassador 
on March 8 that in recent discussions in London and Dublin 
the Europeans had conveyed a preference for GOI-PA 
negotiations in the context of the roadmap, as opposed to 
unilateral steps.  UK PM Tony Blair reportedly expressed 
admiration for President Bush\'s bold policy of sidelining 
Arafat.  Shalom said reports from a Labor Party delegation 
that recently visited Egypt showed Egyptian President Mubarak 
is concerned about Hizballah and al-Qaeda filling any void in 
Gaza left by withdrawing Israeli troops.  Shalom expects to 
hear from Mubarak that the GOE is willing only to patrol the 
border along Gaza from the Egyptian side, preferably with 
more than the lightly-armed civilian police allowed under the 
Egypt-Israel peace treaty.  On U.S.-Israeli discussions about 
disengagement, Shalom cited the PM as saying that among the 
issues on which the GOI would seek U.S. assurances would be 
the right of return and Jerusalem.  End Summary.

FM Shalom Visits London, Dublin 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Reviewing his busy travel schedule this month, Foreign 
Minister Shalom, who was accompanied by Chief of Staff Ron 
Prosor and Policy Advisor Jacob-Shaul Dayan, briefed 
Ambassador Kurtzer on his visit to the UK and Ireland, and 
previewed his visit to Egypt, which will be followed later in 
the month with a visit to the United States.  Referencing the 
\"five points\" he heard during his recent visits to Dublin and 
London, Shalom remarked that several elements of the European 
position sounded quite similar to that of the U.S.  For 
example, he said, the Europeans emphasized that, while they 
understood the impetus for taking unilateral action, their 
strong preference was for bilateral GOI-PA negotiations.  To 
this end, the Europeans pressed that any GOI action conform 
with the letter and spirit of the roadmap.  In addition, the 
Europeans argued against any \"relocation\" of settlements to 
\"strengthen\" so-called \"consensus\" settlements that would be 
annexed, de facto or otherwise.  Commenting on the British 
security plan, Shalom said that he explained to UK PM Blair 
that it did not make sense to provide financial support to 
the Palestinian security forces, even reconfigured under a 
unified chain of command, as long as Arafat ultimately 
directs them.  Shalom noted with some surprise the admiration 
that Blair had expressed for President Bush\'s bold 
articulation, in his June 24, 2002 speech, of a policy 
sidelining Arafat.  Blair reportedly characterized the 
assessment underlying this policy as \"reflecting what 
everybody thought but was afraid to say.\" 
 
----------------- 
Next Stop:  Egypt 
----------------- 
 
3. (C) Previewing his upcoming trip to Egypt, Shalom said 
that Labor Party leaders who had recently visited Egypt had 
reported that Mubarak was not interested in assuming sole 
responsibility for preventing smuggling along the 
\"Philadelphi\" strip along the Israeli side of the border. 
Mubarak reportedly told the Labor delegation that Egypt would 
continue to act against smugglers, but only along the 
Egyptian side of the border.  Asked why Egypt had not done a 
better job preventing smuggling thus far, GOE officials 
reportedly told the delegation that their deficiencies were a 
function of the constraints placed on Egyptian forces as part 
of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty.  (Note:  That treaty allows 
only lightly armed police units to patrol the border.  End 
Note.)  Mubarak reportedly expressed interest in amending 
relevant provisions of the 1979 peace treaty between Israel 
and Egypt to allow Egypt to beef up its forces patrolling the 
border.  Shalom also commented that Mubarak was reported by 
the Labor delegation to be quite concerned about the 
prospects of Hizballah and/or al-Qaeda assuming a foothold in 
Gaza once Israeli forces withdraw.  Shalom expressed concern 
about Mubarak\'s interview published that day in \"Le Figaro,\" 
in which Mubarak expressed strong misgivings about an 
Egyptian role in securing Gaza. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
GOI to Seek Two New Assurances in Context of Disengagement? 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
4. (C) Turning to U.S.-Israeli discussions about PM Sharon\'s 
unilateral disengagement plan, Shalom indicated that Sharon 
had told him that, among the eight or nine issues on which 
the GOI would seek U.S. assurances -- probably in a form 
similar to the \"deposit\" negotiated with Secretary 
Christopher during the Syria track negotiations -- would be 
two issues not specifically drawn from previous U.S. 
assurances: the right of return and \"specific assurances\" on 
Jerusalem.  The latter, according to Shalom, would go beyond 
previous assurances.  Asked about U.S. views on Sharon\'s 
plan, Ambassador Kurtzer cautioned his interlocutor not to 
believe all of the rumors circulating about \"the U.S. 
position\" on the subject.  At this stage, he said, it is 
premature to talk about a final U.S. position.  Ultimately, 
the President\'s view will be shaped by the entirety of the 
package the GOI puts on the table. 
 
-------------------- 
PMs to Meet March 16 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) Shalom confirmed reports that PMs Sharon and Abu Ala\'a 
have set March 16 as the date for their meeting.  He was 
skeptical about Palestinian motivations for holding such a 
meeting at this time, expressing the view that Abu Ala\'a 
probably wants to prevent Sharon from taking the line in 
Washington that \"there is no partner\" on the Palestinian 
side.

1. (C) In response to March 10 ref (C) demarche to his 
deputy, MFA Deputy DG for Strategic Affairs Jeremy 
Issacharoff told polmiloff that the GOI, while fully 
cognizant of \"what\'s at stake\" in gaining consensus for a 
Libya resolution, is unhappy with the reftel Libya resolution 
language because it could set an unfortunate precedent for 
future GOI interests on both WMD and Middle East peace 
issues.  The GOI, he said, believes that the language implies 
support for a Middle East NWFZ and overstates the value of 
the Libyan decision for Middle East peace.  He worried 
specifically about the possibility that Iran could one day 
refer to the language as justification for international 
pressure on Israel. 
 
2. (C) Issacharoff said he was especially unhappy to have 
heard from GOI representatives in Vienna earlier in the 
morning that the U.S. had reportedly acquiesced to the 
Egyptian request (ref A) to reverse the order of the ref (C) 
formulation \"at peace and free of WMD.\"  Reversing the 
formulation, he said, would unacceptably imply that WMD 
disarmament would be a condition for, rather than a result 
of, peace between Israel and its Middle East neighbors. 
 
3. (C) In an earlier conversation (ref B), Issacharoff\'s 
deputy, Alon Bar, said the GOI was instructing its delegation 
in Vienna to seek more acceptable language.  Issacharoff said 
language along the following lines would be acceptable to the 
GOI:  \"Recognizing that the decision of Libya could make a 
contribution towards a more secure Africa and Middle East 
that would be eventually free of WMD.\"

Key stories in the media:

Israel Radio and Ha\'aretz\'s website quoted Secretary of 
State Colin Powell as saying Tuesday that the U.S. has 
\"many questions\" for Israel on the details and impact 
of the disengagement plan, including how the Gaza Strip 
would be administered following Israeli withdrawal. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Israeli and Palestinian 
negotiators agreed that PM Sharon and Palestinian PM 
Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) would meet Tuesday.  Israel Radio 
reported that the very holding of the meeting and its 
date are still uncertain.  Leading media reported that 
Monday Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman 
\"secretly\" met with Sharon and Mossad Director Meir 
Dagan.  Yediot reported that Suleiman expressed his 
concern over a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip.  Yediot quoted GOI sources as saying that 
Israel does not expect Egypt to replace Israel in the 
Strip.   Jerusalem Post quoted diplomatic officials as 
saying that Egypt would be reluctant to play any future 
role in the Gaza Strip if it is not fully coordinated 
with the PA.  The media reported that Suleiman is 
slated to meet with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat today. 
On Israel Radio today, FM Silvan Shalom, who is due to 
travel to Egypt Thursday, praised that country\'s 
policy, which he said had turned positive and could 
represent a model for talks with other countries. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Tuesday Qurei, who is 
visiting European capitals, lashed at the U.S., in 
particular, and the international community, in 
general, for not doing enough for peace.  The newspaper 
also quoted United Arab List Knesset Member Taleb a- 
Sanaa as saying, following a meeting with Arafat, that 
the latter is prepared to meet with Sharon. 
 
King Abdullah II of Jordan was quoted as saying in an 
interview with Maariv that he supports Sharon\'s plan 
for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which he said 
would be a positive step. 
 
Leading media quoted Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin 
as saying Tuesday that his group could stop its attacks 
in the Gaza Strip \"for a certain period of time\" if 
Israel withdraws from the strip.  Ha\'aretz quoted him 
as saying that Hamas is not ruling out joining the PA 
after such a pullout.  Ha\'aretz reported that the U.S. 
has asked Britain to place the entire Hamas 
organization, not just its military branch, on its list 
of banned terrorist groups. 
Ha\'aretz quoted Palestinian sources as saying that a 
Palestinian woman was killed and two other Palestinians 
were wounded in an IDF operation in Jenin. 
 
IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Ya\'alon was quoted as saying 
in several media interviews that he strenuously denies 
having expressed his opposition to Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan.  Hatzofe quoted Ya\'alon\'s initial 
controversial remark: \"We will need to take into 
account the fact that the Palestinians will understand 
it [the plan] as a prize granted to terrorism.\" 
 
Col. (res.) Dan Tirza, who is considered the most 
senior professional advisor to Sharon on the issue of 
the separation fence, was quoted as saying in an 
interview with Ha\'aretz that Israel does not plan to 
build a fence in the eastern part of the West Bank 
because of the likely political fallout in the 
international arena. 
 
Leading media reported that Achille Lauro hijacking 
mastermind Mahmoud Abbas (Abu al-Abbas) died a few days 
ago \"of natural causes\" in American detention in Iraq. 
Abbas was the leader of one of the factions of the 
Palestine Liberation Front. Israel Radio reported that 
the Front has accused the U.S. of murdering Abbas by 
not giving him his heart medication. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that newly declassified U.S. State 
Department documents suggest that Israel considered 
attacking nuclear installations in Pakistan.  The 
newspaper notes that according to these documents, such 
a possibility came up in 1979, during Jimmy Carter\'s 
term as U.S. president.  Ha\'aretz says that the 
documents also make clear that the USG did not hold 
special discussions to address Israel\'s \"preventive 
strike\" plans. 
 
Maariv reported that contacts between representatives 
of the Likud and Labor parties meant to reach a 
national unity government are intensifying.  This 
morning on Israel Radio, Knesset Member Dalia Itzik, 
the head of the Labor Party\'s Knesset faction, 
minimized the meaning of those contacts. 
 
IDF Radio reported that Israel is conducting indirect 
secret contacts with Sudan and Libya.

Reporting on the cornerstone-laying ceremony for the 
joint Israeli-Jordanian \"Bridging the Rift\" science 
center in the Arava Tuesday, Ha\'aretz quoted Cornell 
University President Lehman as saying that the nice 
thing is that \"we are building a project that has 
nothing to do with politics.\"  The newspaper quoted 
Jordanian Planning Minister Bassem Awadallah as saying 
that the foundation of the center does not constitute a 
step of normalization between nations.  The Israeli 
representatives at the ceremony said that this is a 
project that will bolster peace in the region. 
Jerusalem Post and Hatzofe also reported on the 
ceremony. 
Ha\'aretz quoted defense officials as testifying before 
the Knesset\'s Defense Budget Subcommittee Tuesday that 
Israel\'s 2004 defense budget will increase by 2 billion 
shekels (around USD 445 million), coming to 34.9 
billion shekels (around USD 7.76 billion). 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post quoted Democratic 
presidential candidate John Kerry as telling AP Monday 
that he no longer considers Arafat to be a statesman, 
but rather \"an outlaw to the peace process\" in the 
Middle East who has been rightly shuffled aside. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that a computerized IDF simulated 
educational program, which is now distributed to most 
of the field units and officers, outlines 11 rules of 
behavior for IDF soldiers during their operational 
activity in the territories.  The program includes 
quotes from the American film, \"Rules of Engagement.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted A/G Menachem Mazuz as testifying before 
the Knesset\'s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee 
Tuesday that the release of nuclear whistleblower 
Mordecai Vanunu from prison would \"create a significant 
danger to state security.\"  Leading media cited 
Vanunu\'s threat that he would seek asylum in a foreign 
embassy. 
 
Yediot quoted renowned Israeli author Batya Gur (\"a 
detective story writer who is successful abroad\") as 
saying in an interview with the Belgian daily Le Soir: 
\"I am not angry at Palestinian suicide bombers.\"  She 
sharply criticized Israel and asked for help to \"get 
rid of Ariel Sharon.\" 
 
Maariv reported that hundreds of Israelis, who were 
born from 1946 to 1948 in British internment camps for 
illegal immigrants in Cyprus, are asking for birth 
certificates from Cyprus, which will join the EU on May 
1.  The requesters hope to obtain Cypriot citizenship 
and a EU passport. 
 
Yediot reported that Israel has asked the U.S. to allow 
El Al to fly over Iraq to reach its Far East 
destinations, which would save the company\'s planes two 
to three hours of travel. 
 
Ha\'aretz (English Ed.) published a Letter to the Editor 
by Brazilian Ambassador Sergio Moreira Lima, who denies 
a February 10 Ha\'aretz report that terrorist 
organizations are present or operate fund-raising 
activities in distant areas of South America, 
particularly in the triangle of borders of Argentina, 
Brazil and Paraguay. 
 
Monday and Tuesday, all media highlighted the arrest by 
police of 18 people, including four alleged hit men 
from Belarus, suspected of involvement in a number of 
attempted underworld murders.  Ha\'aretz cited the 
police\'s belief that more gangs of foreign hired 
killers are present in Israel.

I.  \"A Confused and Vague Plan\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(March 10): \"Why are the American envoys returning to 
Israel, after having been here only a short while ago, 
in order to find out more about the Prime Minister\'s 
disengagement plan?.... The disengagement plan suffers 
from vagueness not only with senior government echelons 
in the United States.  Senior echelons in Israel are in 
a similar situation.  Some officials in Washington 
believe Sharon is taking an important step on behalf of 
the U.S.  He is essentially granting the Gaza Strip as 
a gift to George Bush, who will help to turn it into a 
democratic Palestinian island, as he is doing in Iraq 
and Afghanistan.  Others in Washington feel the gift is 
\'poisoned.\'  The Americans cannot explain why Sharon 
spoke in Jerusalem about an insignificant move in the 
West Bank, while [his senior aide Dov] Weisglass spoke 
in Washington of an extensive withdrawal.... It is 
clear that Sharon does not want there to be any 
\'disengagement\' as part of a negotiated agreement -- in 
other words, a coordinated withdrawal -- as he 
understands that any agreement would obligate him to 
large concessions.  He reasons that if the Palestinians 
are in fact capable of reaching an agreement, then they 
should be implementing the road map.\" 
 
II.  \"Shooting From the Hip Instead of Conducting 
Policy\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (March 10): \"The 
disengagement plan is the least of all evils.  Peace 
plans raised by Barak at Camp David and Dr. Yossi 
Beilin in Geneva are better, but in the absence of a 
Palestinian negotiating partner, the unilateral move is 
preferable to a quagmire.  It is too bad that its 
handling is being conducted amateurishly.... The 
Americans didn\'t know about it.  Sharon, their ally, 
who is requesting a plane ticket to the White House, 
hasn\'t consulted them regarding an order of 
priorities.... Neither has there been any dialogue with 
the Palestinians.... [Israel] should have held early 
discussion with Mubarak, and not waited for his 
intelligence chief, who arrived in Israel 
precipitously, to locate the diplomatic fire.... Things 
aren\'t insolvable.  Many flaws will be corrected, one 
by one.  But why this delay?  Why only after diplomatic 
damage has been inflicted, even as the hope for a spark 
of understanding between the nations has been 
weakened?\" 
 
III.  \"Well Done, Chief of Staff\" 
 
Nationalist Hatzofe editorialized (March 10): \"Chief of 
Staff Lt. Gen. Moshe (Boogie) Ya\'alon expressed a 
professional opinion regarding the issue of 
disengagement from the Gaza Strip when he said: a) 
Increasing terrorism in the Strip is the result of 
talks about a pullout, etc.  b) In fact, the 
disengagement won\'t solve anything -- this also goes 
for the scope of forces that will be needed to remain 
in the area in order to protect the new 
configuration.... There is nothing political in the 
Chief of Staff\'s remarks, all the more as the Prime 
Minister hasn\'t presented his disengagement plan to any 
official civilian forum.  The Chief of Staff, Shin Bet 
head Avi Dichter and other senior military commanders 
oppose the idea of disengagement from a military point 
of view.  It appears that in the U.S. as well, there is 
no great enthusiasm for this move, because it 
represents first and foremost an encouragement and a 
prize for terrorism.\"

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The media reported that PM Sharon is slated to meet 
today in Jerusalem with the three U.S. diplomatic 
envoys (Stephen Hadley and Elliott Abrams from the 
White House and William Burns from the State 
Department) about the plan for unilateral disengagement 
from the Palestinians and what the U.S. will give 
Israel in exchange for the planned withdrawal from Gaza 
and the evacuation of settlements in the West Bank. 
Ha\'aretz writes that the relationship between the 
number of settlements Israel evacuates in the West Bank 
and the depth of the U.S. recognition of the settlement 
blocs of Ariel, Ma\'aleh Adumim and Gush Etzion, which 
Israel wants to annex in any future peace agreement, 
will be at the core of the talks.  Ha\'aretz reported 
that ahead of the envoys\' visit, U.S. Ambassador Daniel 
Kurtzer sent Washington some 30 comprehensive questions 
that the diplomats will ask Sharon, starting with how 
many settlements will be evacuated in the West Bank. 
 
Maariv (Ben Caspit) led by divulging a document drafted 
by Israel\'s National Security Council, headed by 
disengagement coordinator Giora Eiland.  The document 
urges Sharon not to abandon the Philadelphi road but 
rather to expand the buffer zone between the Gaza Strip 
and Egypt, and not to dismantle the three most northern 
settlements in the strip.  The National Security 
Council is offering Sharon four alternatives for 
settlement removal and IDF troop redeployment there. 
The National Security Council recommends that one of 
the alternatives, a large move that creates sufficient 
conditions for creating an independent Palestinian 
state, be presented to the U.S. \"as an objective and 
conduct negotiations to secure formal international 
support for the move, with a commitment that there will 
be no further political demands from Israel until the 
Palestinian state that is to be established implements 
the first stage of Bush\'s vision and the road map.\" 
The document also recommends not to leave military 
forces in the Gaza Strip after the evacuation, not to 
destroy the infrastructure of the Israeli settlements 
that are to be evacuated, but rather to make an effort 
to turn them over to \'someone,\' and to evacuate the 
Gush Katif bloc of settlements in full.  The document 
says that among the issues that need clarifications are 
the future of Gaza\'s airport and seaport. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted senior diplomatic officials as 
saying Wednesday that Sharon will discuss the future of 
settlements to be evacuated in Gaza with Palestinian PM 
Ahmed Qurei when the two meet next week.  Leading media 
reported that Egypt is pressing the PA to hold the 
meeting.  Jerusalem Post quoted FM Silvan Shalom as 
saying Wednesday that it is clear the PA would agree to 
such a meeting before Sharon travels to Washington in 
order to prevent Sharon from saying in the U.S. that 
there is no one on the other side with whom to talk. 
 
All media reported that five members of the Al-Aqsa 
Martyrs Brigades were killed in Jenin Wednesday by an 
IDF undercover unit.  The men were reportedly on their 
way to carry out an attack on the settlement of Kadim 
near Jenin.  All media also cite the Shin Bet as saying 
that members of a Palestinian terror cell in Khan Yunis 
(southern Gaza Strip) who received funds, instructions 
and training from Hizbullah operatives in Lebanon were 
arrested Wednesday.  The media reported that a high 
state of alert in Jerusalem was declared Wednesday and 
lowered this morning. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Tourism Minister Benny Elon 
(National Union) has hired the services of a New York 
PR agency to explain his opposition to the 
disengagement plan.  The radio reported that 
Construction and Housing Minister Effi Eitam (National 
Religious Party - NRP) is leaving for the U.S., and 
that the same agency published a press release on his 
behalf with a similar message.  Ha\'aretz reported that 
the NRP is divided over when to quit the government, 
and that Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin (Likud) now 
represents a major source of opposition to Sharon\'s 
plan. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio quoted A/S William Burns as 
testifying Wednesday before the House Committee on 
International Relations that the U.S. Administration 
will act soon to impose firm sanctions on Syria, which 
it accuses of terrorism. 
 
Maariv reported that during the talks Egyptian 
intelligence chief Omar Suleiman held with Israeli and 
PA leaders, Egypt agreed to monitor elements that could 
perturb the stability in the Gaza Strip following the 
IDF\'s withdrawal, but not to take up security 
responsibility there.  Leading media reported that 
Wednesday the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) 
elected Rouhi Fatouh from Gaza City, a close ally of PA 
Chairman Yasser Arafat, as its speaker.  Ha\'aretz says 
that the move is being seen in the PA as Arafat\'s first 
significant internal response to Sharon\'s plan to 
withdraw from the Gaza Strip.  This morning, Israel 
Radio quoted Arafat as saying that he welcomes the 
disengagement plan, provided it leads to Israel\'s 
withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories. 
The media continued to publish contradictory reports 
about possible Likud-Labor contacts regarding the 
formation of a national unity government.  Labor Party 
Chairman Shimon Peres was quoted as saying at a public 
party venue that there are no such contacts.   Former 
PM Ehud Barak called Sharon\'s disengagement \"serious\" 
and said that he favors Labor\'s entry into the 
government when the right-wing parties leave it. 
 
Yediot and Maariv reported that on May 1, as 10 new 
nations join the EU, 1 million Israelis (Maariv: 1.1 
million) will be entitled to an EU passport.  The 
newspapers cited data provided Wednesday by Ambassador 
Giancarlo Chevallard, who heads the EU delegation in 
Israel.  Ha\'aretz and Maariv cited the results of a 
poll conducted in December 2003 by Mina Zemach (Dahaf 
Institute) for the EU delegation in Israel [NB: some of 
the findings were printed by either of the two 
newspapers]: 
-85 percent of Israelis believe that membership in the 
EU is very important for Israel (up from 77 percent in 
February 2003). 
-55 percent of respondents believe that relations with 
the U.S. contribute more to Israel than its relations 
with the EU (down from 62 percent in February 2003). 
-74 percent of respondents claim that the EU is one- 
sided in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
-55 percent of respondents believe that EU financial 
aid to the Palestinians harms Israel\'s interests (down 
from 64 percent in February 2003). 
-Two thirds of respondents believe that the EU\'s 
attitude vis-a-vis Israel is anti-Semitic under 
pretenses of moral principles. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that a spiritual center for Ethiopian 
immigrants was dedicated Wednesday in Lod.  The 
institution is funded by the Chicago-based 
International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, which 
donated some 1.5 million shekels (about USD 334,000) 
for the construction of the building.

I.  \"Not Serious\" 
 
Columnist Ari Shavit wrote in independent, left-leaning 
Ha\'aretz (March 11): \"As far as the fundamental 
strategic idea is concerned, Sharon is right.  His 
determination to evacuate the entire Gaza Strip is 
impressive.  His intention to open the Gaza-Egypt 
border is creative and interesting.  His thoughts of a 
complementary evacuation of parts of the West Bank are 
brave and far-reaching.  It seems that Sharon has 
finally -- and belatedly -- internalized the fact that 
the main threat facing Israel is demographic, not 
terrorist.  He understands that perpetuating the 
occupation is more dangerous for Israel than Hamas 
growing stronger.... But the manner in which Sharon is 
promoting his strategic idea is intolerable.... There 
is not even the start of an understanding with the 
Americans regarding the stabilizing mechanism that will 
be introduced to absorb the massive jolts that will 
accompany the withdrawal.... The next few months will 
be critical.  The way in which the withdrawal plan is 
formulated over the coming months will determine 
whether Israel finally disengages itself from the kiss 
of death that is a binational existence.  It will 
determine whether, after 37 years of folly, Israel is 
able to withdraw back into its own borders and to take 
its destiny in its own hands.  The way in which 
Sharon\'s bureau handles the withdrawal has generated 
some very serious questions.\" 
 
II.  \"Between Bush and Netanyahu\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in Ha\'aretz 
(March 11): \"Now the fate of the plan rests in the 
hands of two people -- George W. Bush and Binyamin 
Netanyahu.  The president will determine what Israel 
gets for an evacuation.  The finance minister is the 
key to the support of most of the Likud ministers for 
the plan.  There\'s a vicious circle involved in this. 
Netanyahu is demanding Sharon bring an impressive 
\'compensation package\' from the Americans.  For that 
the Americans need a substantial withdrawal from the 
West Bank.... But a deep withdrawal from the West Bank 
will make it difficult for [Likud ministers] Netanyahu, 
Limor Livnat and Danny Naveh to support the plan, for 
ideological reasons and for another reason raised by 
Livnat: Israel will be losing territorial bargaining 
cards.... The Likud is convinced that Shimon Peres and 
his colleagues in Labor are so hungry for power that 
they won\'t be deterred on their way into Sharon\'s 
government by the police investigations and Sharon 
scandals.... [But] breakthroughs, from Sadat\'s visit 
and through Madrid, Oslo, the Lebanon withdrawal and 
the disengagement plan, were all born in narrow 
governments.  It is difficult to tell whether Sharon 
and Peres will break that tradition or bury both the 
withdrawal from Gaza and the planned evacuations in the 
West Bank, instead.\" 
 
III.  \"Who\'s Afraid of Chaos?\" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (March 11): \"On 
the eve of Israel\'s disengagement from the entire Gaza 
Strip, the Arab rulers have once again brandished their 
secret weapon saved for emergencies: the \'chaos 
 
SIPDIS 
theory.\'  This theory contends that without the Arab 
rulers, chaos (\'fawda\' in Arabic) will reign in the 
Middle East, and that they -- Mubarak, Abdullah, 
Arafat, Assad and Qadhafi -- are guarding Israel from 
it.... The Palestinians are currently engaged in 
disseminating warnings that Israel\'s evacuation from 
Gaza will lead to chaos.  Tony Blair has already bought 
this argument from Abu Ala during his visit to London, 
and other European leaders are following suit.  But 
this seems to be a false alarm.  Hamas, which belongs 
to the school of thought of the Muslim Brotherhood, 
will not confront the PA head-on due to its ideological 
structure, especially since its strength there is much 
smaller than the Palestinian Authority\'s police and 
army forces even in its present situation.  In general, 
it is time to understand that the chaos theory does not 
have a leg to stand on.  Three and a half years after 
the outbreak of the Intifada, Israel should awaken and 
make the chaos theory, which has been turned against 
it, into a weapon for its benefit.  It should say to 
the Arab leaders: the chaos you talk about is not proof 
of our need to stay in the Gaza Strip, but rather the 
reverse -- it is our reason to disengage from it 
completely.  The chaos will thereby turn from the 
friend of the Arab leaders into our friend.\"

\"The Arabs\' New Friends\" 
 
Left-leaning contributor Larry Derfner wrote in 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (March 11): 
\"Something is out of whack here.  The Likudniks and 
Republicans, who have the lowest opinion of the Arabs, 
are also claiming to have the highest aspirations for 
them.... Despite what President Bush seems to think, a 
democrat is not somebody who just wants to be free; a 
democrat is somebody who also wants his political 
opponents to be free.  But nobody is really going to 
want his political opponents to be free if he\'s 
convinced that their freedom will mean the end of his 
own, and in the Arab Middle East this is a wholly 
justified fear.  It\'s the guiding principle of politics 
in the region, which is why Arab democracy has never 
gotten off the ground.... The truth is that several 
Arab dictatorships are repressing their people\'s clamor 
for war with Israel or Islamic revolution. So far, none 
has been found repressing a popular desire for anything 
that could be called democracy.   Liberals don\'t like 
to talk about this because they\'re afraid of being 
called racists.  Right-wingers know this about 
liberals, of course, which is why they can go on 
singing about Arab democracy (while daydreaming about 
future invasions) with little interruption.\"

SUBJECT: HUMANITARIAN CONDITIONS IN WEST BANK AND 
GAZA: NOT GETTING ANY BETTER 
 
This cable has been cleared by ConGen Jerusalem. 
 
1.  Summary: Overall, the humanitarian situation in 
West Bank and Gaza (WB/G) has not improved.  Despite 
some minor improvements in mobility, the range of 
socio-economic indicators remain dismal.  Over 60 
percent of the WB/G population live below the poverty 
line; Unemployment rates as of fourth quarter 2003, 
under ILO standards, were 20.7 percent for West Bank 
and 31.9 percent for Gaza.  If we include \"discouraged 
workers\", the rates climb to 27.8 percent for the West 
Bank and 37.2 percent for Gaza, according to the World 
Bank.  According to a recent WFP/FAO survey, 41 
percent of Gazans and 39 percent of West Bankers 
suffer from food insecurity.  The GOI has allowed 
Gazans to work in Israel, despite a series of recent 
terrorist attacks at Erez crossing and has 
consistently re-opened the crossing to laborers after 
very brief closings following these incidents.  Access 
to agricultural lands, however, remains problematic, 
despite some recent minor improvements in the West 
Bank.  In Gaza, however, farmers have reported more, 
not fewer, problems in accessing their fields. 
 
2.  In the realm of health, there has been a positive 
trend of improved access for ambulances and emergency 
medical teams.  However, there still are far too many 
delays.  The lack of financial resources means that 
many families forego routine and preventative medical 
care.  In general, international staff members of 
relief agencies have been able to travel to and from 
the West Bank and Gaza.  Due to recent attacks at 
Erez, there are however, serious delays in gaining 
access to Gaza.  However, there have been no 
improvements in the ability of these agencies to 
deliver services to enclosed communities in Gaza and 
the GOI has yet to fullfill its long outstanding 
committment to allow direct food delivery into El- 
Mowassi.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Checkpoints/ General Movement: Too Many and Not Enough 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3.  In general, there has been a marginal improvement 
in mobility in the West Bank and Gaza for people and 
goods, including workers.  However, these modest 
improvements have not been enough to impact socio- 
economic conditions, and are unlikely to positively 
influence any of the broad health and humanitarian 
indicators - acute and chronic nutrition, food 
security, unemployment, poverty levels.  The GOI has 
claimed it has removed 22 internal manned West Bank 
checkpoints, while the Office of Coordination of 
Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) could only confirm 
nine.  OCHA reported that nearly 600 concrete road 
barriers and earth mounds continue to restrict travel 
on internal West Bank roads.  Flying-checkpoints in 
the West Bank are an almost daily occurrence.  In 
Gaza, North-South travel has in general been possible 
with fewer delays at Abu Khouli checkpoint.  Travel, 
however, to and from enclosed communities such as El- 
Mowassi and Seafa remains extremely restricted. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Land Confiscations/Demolitions Continue 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  Land confiscations, leveling, and demolitions all 
continue in both the West Bank and Gaza.  These 
actions are associated mostly with construction of the 
separation barrier in the West Bank; while in Gaza 
they are prompted by enhancement to security 
perimeters and infrastructure near settlements. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
High but Stabilized Unemployment/ Improved Access to 
Agricultural Lands 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5.  As of fourth quarter 2003, unemployment rates (ILO 
definition) stood at 20.7 percent for the West Bank 
and 31.9 percent for Gaza.  While this is an 
improvement over the peak Intifada unemployment rates 
registered in second quarter of 2002 (WB 31.4 percent; 
Gaza 42 percent), the numbers are still drastically 
higher than pre-Intifada numbers of 7.5 percent for 
the West Bank and 15.4 percent for Gaza.  With 
population growth at 4.3 percent per year, dependency 
ratios - the total population divided by the number of 
employed persons - have increased significantly over 
the Intifada period.  In the third quarter of 2000, 
each job holder in the West Bank was supporting 4.3 
persons, by the fourth quarter of 2003, each employed 
person was supporting 5.4 persons.  In Gaza, the 
dependency ratio increased more dramatically, from 5.9 
to 7.7. 
 
6.  Gazans working in Israel continue to hover in the 
10,000/day range.  Recent terrorism attacks at Erez 
have resulted in the crossing being closed for only 
small periods of time - one or two days - before 
workers were allowed to resume crossing into Israel. 
Overall, according to a World Bank/PCBS study 
conducted over the past four months, Gazans who have 
jobs report \"few\" or \"no\" problems in accessing their 
places of employment.  (Note: It is not clear if Gazan 
respondents include both those employed in Israel and 
within Gaza, or just the latter.  End Note.)  West 
Bankers reported greater difficulties with the average 
falling between \"few problems\" and \"difficult.\" 
Nablus has reported the most difficulty.  There, fully 
35 percent of those employed said they found it \"very 
difficult\" or \"impossible\" to reach their places of 
employment in the January survey. 
 
7.  Roughly one third of the households in the West 
Bank and 15 percent in Gaza have agricultural land 
that they cultivate.  In World Bank/PCBS surveys 
conducted over the past four months, West Bank 
households reported a slight improvement in access to 
that land, while in Gaza the trend was negative. 
Overall, West Bankers still report more difficulties 
in accessing farmland, than do Gazans. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Food Security: International Assistance Averts a 
Catastrophe 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
8.  The donor community has managed to reduce global 
acute malnutrition through massive amounts of food 
assistance, technical support and awareness raising 
with the Ministry of Health.  However, there have 
not/not been significant improvements in overall food 
security which exists when people have physical and 
economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious 
food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences 
for an active and healthy life.  A recent FAO/WFP Food 
Security and Vulnerability Profiling Assessment 
concluded that 41 percent of Gazans and 39 percent of 
West Bankers suffer from food insecurity.  The 
majority of cases in the West Bank were reported along 
the route of the separation barrier.  In a pilot study 
examining coping strategies, WFP reported that 89 
percent of its beneficiaries said they frequently or 
always consume less quality and variety of food; 63 
percent limit the portions of meals; 56 percent forego 
health and education expenses; and 55 percent reduce 
the meals of adults in favor of children.  The survey 
also concluded that among WFP beneficiaries, 
humanitarian assistance is the main/main source of 
income in the Gaza Strip, whereas in the West Bank, it 
remains employment and casual labor. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Health Access: The Worst is Over 
-------------------------------- 
 
9.  OCHA reported that medical staff and patients 
continue to face checkpoint delays of up to four 
hours.  There have, however, been fewer cases of 
ambulances being denied access altogether, under 
\"normal\" conditions.  During periods of major clashes, 
OCHA reported that the coordination mechanisms between 
Israelis and Palestinians tend to break down, 
resulting in serious delays.  Since the beginning of 
the year, there have been 12 incidents where 
ambulances and medical teams have been denied access; 
and 45 incidents in which medical personnel were 
delayed from 40 minutes up to four hours. 
 
10.  Access to routine medical care is less 
problematic than access to emergency services.  In 
joint surveys carried out by the World Bank and PCBS 
over the past four months, for the approximately 70 
percent of households in Gaza reporting a need for 
medical attention, most said that access to that care 
posed \"few problems.\"  In the West Bank, access was 
more problematic, with West Bank village residents 
reporting the most difficulty in accessing care; and 
camp residents reporting the least problems, probably 
due to the existence of UNRWA clinics in the camps. 
Financial wherewithal remains a key determinant to 
whether a family receives routine and preventative 
health care in both Gaza and the West Bank, but this 
factor is more pronounced in Gaza. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Access for Relief Agencies: Okay in the West Bank - 
Problematic in Gaza 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
11.  International organizations and NGOs are not 
generally encountering major obstacles delivering 
services in the West Bank.  Access to and from Gaza 
has been difficult lately as a result of a series of 
recent terrorist attacks at Erez crossing.  Currently, 
internationals are not allowed to bring cars into 
Gaza.  We have heard informally that access to 
vehicles will be restored by the end of the week. 
 
12.  However, NGOs and international organizations 
continue to face more systematic access problems in 
delivering services to enclosed communities in Gaza -- 
El-Mowassi and Seafa.  Despite numerous pledges, 
commitments, and meetings dating back over one year, 
the GOI has still failed to allow UNRWA and WFP to 
make direct food deliveries to El-Mowassi for example. 
 
13.  The GOI has recently issued some permits to local 
Palestinian staff members of UN organizations. 
However, there is still room for improvement in this 
regard.

1.  (C) Summary:  The Director of the Israeli Money 
Laundering Prohibition Authority (IMPA), Yehuda Shaffer, told 
econoff on March 10 that the Israeli financial intelligence 
unit (FIU) was left out of the Shin Bet/IDF raid on the 
Palestinian banks on February 24.  Shaffer claimed the FIU 
was only given information about the suspected accounts after 
the raid.  Shaffer was confident that the raids were 
justified, however, he was disappointed that his unit was not 
allowed to contribute information until after the fact. 
Shaffer said if the GOI adopted provisions similar to the 
U.S. \"PATRIOT Act,\" the Ministry of Justice could have seized 
the money from the correspondent accounts of the two banks in 
Israel, rather than conducting a military raid on the bank\'s 
branches in Ramallah.  Shaffer reiterated his unit\'s 
willingness to work with the Palestinian Monetary Authority 
and he is awaiting word from the PA.  End summary.

Yehuda Shaffer, told econoff that contrary to many peoples\' 
expectations, the FIU played no role in the lead-up to the 
IDF/Shin Bet raids in Ramallah two weeks ago.  Shaffer said, 
according to information that he has received, the money 
seized by the raid was transmitted directly from Jordan to 
the accounts in the West Bank.  Shaffer added that the money 
never passed through the Israeli banking system and therefore 
did not pass through the FIU\'s monitoring network.  When 
asked whether IMPA was given a chance by the Shin Bet to 
confirm whether this was true, Shaffer responded that they 
were only given the account information after the raid. 
Shaffer said that this was a purely security service/military 
operation and therefore the IMPA was left out.  Shaffer 
believed this was an unfortunate choice because it is 
possible that the IMPA could have traced other funds to the 
suspected accounts and provided greater information to the 
Shin Bet and the IDF.  In Shaffer\'s opinion it is highly 
probable that some of the accounts in question have received 
funding through Israeli correspondent banks. 
 
3.  (C) Shaffer opined that even if the IMPA and Ministry of 
Justice played a larger role in this operation there was 
little they could have done to seize the funds in Israel, 
since the funds did not transit Israeli banks.  Shaffer said 
that unlike the U.S., Israeli law prohibits the government 
from seizing funds from foreign banks\' correspondent 
accounts.  Shaffer said that had the GOI had terrorist 
financing legislation similar to the \"PATRIOT Act\" in effect, 
they could have seized the funds from the banks correspondent 
accounts in Israel, rather than by conducting a military 
style raid.  Shaffer said that the GOI has been reluctant to 
enact such a law because of the potential sovereignty issues 
raised when a country seizes the assets of another country\'s 
banks.  Shaffer remarked that \"the U.S. can do it because 
nobody can afford not to do business with American banks, but 
Israel is only a little country.\"  Shaffer said that from a 
law enforcement perspective he hopes that the U.S. will 
encourage Israel to adopt such a law. 
 
4.  (C) Econoff informed Shaffer that ConGen Jerusalem had 
passed his contact information to the Palestinian Monetary 
Authority (PMA).  Shaffer said that he was happy to hear that 
the PA is interested in improving cooperation on terrorist 
financing and that he remains committed to helping them in 
any way possible.  Shaffer said he has not heard from the PMA.

JOINT ACTIVITIES

Classified By: DCM Richard LeBaron for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) U.S. and Israeli delegations discussed efforts to 
combat radiological terrorism during February 24-25 talks 
held in Israel.  The parties reviewed existing institutional 
structures and technologies as well as strategy and 
approaches for research, development, testing and evaluation. 
 Also discussed was the role of science and technology in 
support of operational and public affairs challenges in 
responding to a Radiological Dispersion Device (RDD) event. 
The need to develop advanced technologies to detect RDD\'s and 
respond to such an event was of paramount concern, as well as 
the training of first responders and avoiding public panic. 
Both sides agreed that an RDD event -- designed for mass 
disruption rather than mass destruction -- could have 
devastating economic and psychological impacts in excess of 
direct damage to human health. 
 
2. (C)  Further collaboration on radiation detection, 
dispersion modeling, performance standards, testing protocols 
and unconventional explosive detection will be considered 
under the umbrella of the Joint Counterterrorism Group 
Working Group on Homeland Security.  Israel is among few 
countries undertaking serious research and development toward 
combating an RDD event, and would be a logical USG partner 
for further cooperation.  End Summary. 
 
3.  (C) The USG delegation was led by Robert Harward, 
Director for Strategy and Defense Issues, Office of Combating 
Terrorism, NSC, and Dr. Holly Dockery, Director of 
International Affairs, Science and Technology Directorate, 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  It included officials 
from DHS, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Institutes 
of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Embassy Tel Aviv 
ESTHoff.  The Israeli delegation was led by Gideon Shavit, 
Director of External Relations, Israel Atomic Energy 
Commission (IAEC), and included officials from the IAEC, 
Ministry of Defense, National Security Council, Israeli 
Police, Ministry of Environment, Israeli Security Agency, 
Israeli Defense Forces, and Israeli Institute of Biological 
Research. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
WORKSHOP FOCUS ON S&T ROLE IN RDD EVENT 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The meetings were held at the Soreq Nuclear Research 
Center outside of Tel Aviv, the centralized location in 
Israel for radioactive detection capabilities (explosive 
detection is centralized at Police/Israeli Security Agency 
facilities, and chemical/biological detection at the Israeli 
Institute of Biological Research).  The parties reviewed 
existing institutional structures for RDD detection and 
management of an RDD event, and explained the results of 
recent Table Top Exercises conducted to simulate responses to 
such an event.  The principal lessons learned included the 
need to better train first responders, the development of 
refined standards for decontamination (\"how clean is 
clean?\"), and the public affairs challenges in preventing 
panic and media frenzy.  Additionally, the USG team 
emphasized the need for science and technology 
representatives to be engaged from the start in exercise 
planning, and not just in assessing the performance of 
existing technologies.  This would optimize data collection 
and evaluation of technological performance. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
GOI HIGHLIGHTS CARGO RISK TO CIVIL AVIATION 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) A session on aviation security reviewed the latest 
systems and technologies in detecting RDD as well as other 
explosive devices.  Ram Arnon of the Israeli Security Agency 
explained that the GOI is now moving to 100 percent physical 
screening of cargo, a change from past practice of screening 
based on profiling and the bill of lading.  In Arnon\'s view, 
given the stepped-up screening of passengers, the next large 
aviation event is more likely to occur from cargo placed 
aboard passenger jets.  The U.S. delegation reviewed advances 
in aviation security technologies, as well as new screening 
systems and technologies being evaluated at the test bed of 
the Port Authority of NY/NJ. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
CLEAN-UP STANDARDS:  HOW CLEAN IS CLEAN? 
---------------------------------------- 
6.  (C) On mitigation and decontamination issues, both 
delegations reviewed existing standards both for permissible 
radiation exposure to first responders as well as acceptable 
levels for post event clean-up.  The USG del explained our 
policy that decontamination levels be considered on a 
site-specific basis, with the guiding principle of attaining 
as low a contamination level \"as reasonably achievable\" 
(ALARA).  DHS officials noted the importance of separating an 
RDD event from normal environmental clean-up standard when 
assessing proper decontamination levels.  The GOI briefed the 
US delegation on their new standards for acceptable dosage 
limits for first responders, bringing them more into accord 
with current international standards.  These new limits 
recognized the distinction between those applicable to 
remedial action and those for life saving activities, the 
latter having a higher threshold. 
 
------------------------- 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS CHALLENGES 
------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The IAEC gave an extensive briefing on public affairs 
issues and working with the media, having recently held a 
seminar on these issues with local media and other 
policymakers.  They emphasized the general lack of knowledge 
in the public concerning RDD (and association with nuclear 
devices), and the potential for media frenzy and panic.  The 
GOI is identifying and preparing a list of speakers to 
address key issues and avoid a vacuum filled by \"experts\" who 
might send an inappropriate message.  Dr. Dockery indicated 
that the GOI analysis dovetailed with the USG analysis, 
although we have yet to hold a formal exercise on this issue. 
 Dockery noted that in the U.S., like Israel, public 
attitudes about radiation are very backward, and emphasized 
the need for a consistent and coordinated governmental 
message should an event occur.  She added that in many cases 
of public disasters (e.g. earthquakes), the local media 
outlets provide more helpful, practical advice to the public 
than the national media, which tends to focus more on 
dramatic visual images. 
 
-------------------- 
FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES 
-------------------- 
 
8. (C) The GOI del presented a proposal for follow-up 
activities that included the following:  table top exercise 
on public affairs, a meeting on dispersion models, a USG 
seminar to Israeli first responders, a follow-up meeting on 
technologies for detection of illicit trafficking of 
radioactive materials, a discussion of USG decontamination 
doctrine and procedures, and mutual visits to exercises. 
Dockery and Harward explained that certain of these issues 
were beyond the purview of this delegation (comprised of S&T 
officials), but that we would pass their suggestions on to 
the appropriate offices and agencies.  The USG would be 
prepared to consider, however, certain follow-up under the 
auspices of the Homeland Security Working Group of the JCG. 
Specifically, we would look into the suggested follow-up on 
dispersion models in association with an MOD-Department of 
Defense meeting planned for April, as well as further 
discussions concerning detection of unconventional 
explosives.  Additional areas of cooperation suggested by the 
US del include linkages between explosives and RDD detection, 
as well as the use of the Soreq testing facilities to conduct 
joint experiments and testing of RDD devices. 
 
9. (C) Comment.  The meetings were useful and both 
delegations accomplished internal goals.  The GOI has for 
some time expressed interest in establishing closer links 
with civilian USG counterparts engaged in homeland security 
issues. The Israelis view DHS as a newly established 
counterpart in this respect, and this RDD meeting represents 
an inroad into further collaboration.  For the USG, there are 
few countries which share the same risk profile concerning 
RDD events and which are actively engaged in the R&D required 
to combat this form of terrorism.  Israel would be a logical 
partner for increased collaboration given their interest and 
technical expertise in this field.

2.  Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media -- except Ha\'aretz (English Ed.) -- led with 
the multiple, almost simultaneous bombings in Madrid on 
Thursday morning, in which 198 people were killed and 
over 1400 others were wounded, according to the Spanish 
government.  Yediot\'s banner reads: \"In Europe, Too.\" 
The media reported that the London-based Arabic- 
language Al-Quds Al-Arabi received an e-mailed claim of 
responsibility from Al Qaida, which allegedly states 
that the organization has infiltrated \"the heart of 
crusader Europe\" and completed its preparations for 
terrorist attacks in the U.S.  Israel Radio reported 
that, like UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Secretary 
of State Colin Powell initially endorsed the Spanish 
government\'s assertion that the Basque guerrilla group 
ETA is behind the attacks, but that the U.S. 
Administration became open to other options following 
the Al-Qaida announcement.   Jerusalem Post cited PM 
Sharon\'s expression of \"deep grief\" over the attack. 
Ha\'aretz notes that FM Silvan Shalom also sent his 
condolences to the government and people of Spain. 
Leading media reported that Israel is prepared to send 
aid in various forms to Spain.  Israel Radio reported 
that, due to a lack of need, the Spanish authorities 
declined an offer by an Israeli forensic team to travel 
to Madrid to help in identifying the dead. 
 
Leading media reported on Defense Minister Shaul 
Mofaz\'s meetings in Washington Thursday and today with 
Secretary Powell, Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense 
 
SIPDIS 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and National Security Advisor 
 
SIPDIS 
Condoleezza Rice.  Israel Radio and Maariv reported 
that Mofaz asked for U.S. support for Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan, saying that this support is 
important for him (Maariv), and for the Palestinians, 
the Arab states and the EU (Israel Radio).  Maariv and 
Israel Radio reported that Mofaz told the senior U.S. 
officials he met Thursday that the conflict with the 
Palestinians could last for years and Israel must 
organize toward that possibility, because there is no 
partner on the Palestinian side.  Maariv reported that 
Mofaz told the U.S. officials: \"Israel is looking 
toward a historic move\" and \"The moment there is a 
partner for dialogue, we will resume the negotiations 
with the Palestinians.\"  Israel Radio\'s Washington 
correspondent said: \"The Americans know the Likud well, 
the disengagement plan a little less.\"  The radio also 
reported that Immigrant Absorption Minister Tzippi 
Livni (Likud) met with NSA Rice. 
 
The media reported that Thursday Sharon and other 
Israeli officials, including his senior aides Giora 
Eiland and Dov Weisglass, met with the three U.S. 
envoys -- Stephen Hadley and Elliott Abrams from the 
White House and William Burns from the State Department 
-- and that the meetings will continue today.  Israel 
Radio reported that FM Shalom met with the U.S. envoys 
this morning.  Yediot and other media reported that 
Sharon told the American officials that he conditions a 
substantial withdrawal from the West Bank upon a U.S. 
agreement to the annexation by Israel of settlement 
blocks in the West Bank.  Jerusalem Post quoted a 
senior diplomatic official as saying Thursday that 
Israel is seeking written assurances from the U.S. on 
the issue. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Sharon is considering 
restricting his disengagement plan to the Gaza Strip 
only, without a concomitant withdrawal from the West 
Bank, in light of the growing opposition to the plan 
among Likud ministers.  The newspaper says that Sharon 
will explore this possibility in the next few days, as 
well as the alternative of a small, purely symbolic 
withdrawal from the West Bank.  Ha\'aretz and other 
media noted that both the U.S. and Egypt have said they 
will not support the plan unless it includes a 
significant withdrawal from the West Bank.  Leading 
media quoted DAS David Satterfield as saying Thursday 
that one of the biggest questions is the scope of the 
planned withdrawal from the West Bank.  Satterfield 
also spoke about Israel\'s \"humiliation\" of the 
Palestinians. 
 
Maariv divulged further details about the outline of 
Israel\'s National Security Council disengagement plan. 
Yediot reported that the council has raised the idea of 
selling the Gaza Strip settlements to the World Bank. 
Maariv cited the right-wing weekly Makor Rishon, as 
quoting, in its latest issue coming out today, a senior 
source as saying that the evacuation of settlers and 
IDF soldiers from the Gush Katif bloc of settlements in 
the West Bank will start on May 1. 
 
Leading media reported that at his meeting with FM 
Shalom in Cairo Thursday, Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak promised to secure the border with Israel with 
Egyptian border police.  Mubarak repeated this 
assurance in interviews with the regional 
correspondents of the three Israeli TV channels. 
Mubarak emphasized that any unilateral move should be 
made in accordance with the road map.  Maariv reported 
that Mubarak will send two delegates to the Knesset 
ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the Israel- 
Egypt peace treaty -- former ambassador to Tel Aviv 
Mohammed Bassiouny and Mustapha Faki, the Chairman of 
the Egyptian Senate\'s Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Hatzofe reported that the Cairo Opera has been 
presenting for some time an inciting anti-American 
production. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Thursday the High Court 
extended a freeze on the construction of a section of 
the security fence northwest of Jerusalem for another 
six days, pending a hearing on a petition lodged by 
Palestinian villagers in the area. 
 
Maariv reported that the defense establishment is 
considering immunizing Israelis against smallpox, and 
that the Home Front Command could recommend that 
Israelis get small and inexpensive masks granting a 20- 
minute protection period from chemical and biological 
materials. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that a delegation of Likud members 
met with senior Jordanian officials at the Movenpick 
hotel, on the Jordanian shore of the Dead Sea, where 
the Geneva Accord had been drafted.  The Jordanians 
reportedly asked the Likud members to tell Sharon that 
Jordan views a public announcement by Israel that 
Jordan is not the country of the Palestinians as 
extremely important.  Ha\'aretz quoted Deputy 
Employment, Industry and Trade Minister Michael Ratzon, 
who took part in the talks, as saying that the Left 
does not have a monopoly on dialogue initiatives. 
 
All media reported that the police have arrested a 
possible fourth member of the \"new Jewish terror 
underground\" that planned and carried out attacks 
against Israeli Arabs in the Haifa area -- Alexander 
Rabinovich, 22, from Haifa. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that under new legislation awaiting 
approval from the U.S. Senate (an amendment to Title VI 
of the Higher Education Act, already passed by the 
House of Representatives), researchers from all over 
the world -- including Israel -- could be asked to 
present their positions on U.S. policy before 
participating in advanced studies programs at U.S. 
universities. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that at a meeting last week with 
ministers and representatives of agencies involved with 
immigration, Sharon stated his goal of bringing 1 
million Jews to Israel in the next few years.

pluralist Maariv: \"Thursday, Spain joined the expanding

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Madrid Is Not the End of Terrorism\'s Road\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote on page one of independent, left-leaning 
Ha\'aretz (March 12): \"Whether Thursday\'s terrorist 
attack in Madrid was the work of the Basque underground 
or of another terrorist organization, such as Al Qaida 
-- or perhaps even a collaborative effort -- it is 
clear that the massacre at the train station in Spain\'s 
capital was modeled after acts by Al-Qaida, Hamas, 
Islamic Jihad and their ilk: a massive terror attack 
against innocent civilians in the name of an ideology 
or political demand.... Israelis can empathize with the 
horror and anguish experienced yesterday by residents 
of Madrid.  The irony is that the Spanish media has for 
the last several years shown \'understanding\' for 
Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians in public 
places, on buses and in railway stations, and has even 
justified such attacks.  But no political demand, 
however justified it might be, justifies such acts of 
mass murder.... Thus anyone who objects to what the 
terrorists did Thursday in Madrid cannot at the same 
time justify or overlook similar acts of terror against 
other nations.\" 
 
II.  \"Welcome to the Real World\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote on page one of mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (March 8): \"Welcome to the 
Europe of mega-terrorist attacks.  First there was 
September 11.  Now there is also March 11.  Between one 
and the other, citizens of Indonesia, Kenya, Turkey, 
Russia and Iraq were massacred in mass terror attacks. 
But Western Europe, for some reason, thought itself 
protected.  Immune.  It won\'t happen to us, the 
Europeans said, we are not in terror\'s gun sights. 
After all, we are not part of imperialistic America or 
Russian imperialism and Zionist imperialism.  We are 
enlightened, post-modern, progressive.... Now it has 
happened to them too.... People ask, why should al 
Qaida, or some organization affiliated with it, 
slaughter civilians in Madrid commuting to work? 
Experts are quick to respond: it is because of Spain\'s 
participation in the war in Iraq.  What a stupid 
question and what a stupid answer.  And what was al 
Qaida\'s motive in murdering 3,000 Americans who came to 
work at the World Trade Center in New York?  At that 
time ... it even appeared that Bush was one of the more 
pro-Arab presidents of America.... The game of motive 
guessing leads nowhere.  There is no logic here, what 
there is is seizing opportunities to murder as many 
people as possible.  Let us pay attention to what 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a prophetic 
speech a week ago: he said that for him, September 11 
was a day of epiphany.  He realized that zealots had 
declared unlimited war on our world.... Europe still 
refuses to internalize what happened.  It still refuses 
to open its eyes wide and to accept the fact that as of 
this morning, every trip by any child to any school in 
Europe on public transportation is a trip into the 
heart of darkness, filled with fear and trembling.  In 
Madrid as in Jerusalem.\" 
 
III.  \"Crossing a Threshold\" 
 
Foreign News Editor Arik Bachar wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (March 12): \"Bin Laden did to 
terrorism of the old kind -- that of the 70s and 80s -- 
exactly what Quentin Tarantino did to the shower scene 
of Alfred Hitchcock\'s \'Psycho\'.... This is only going 
to get worse, because demons of this sort feed 
themselves and compete with one another.  The next big 
target, a real irresistible temptation if you are a 
terrorist on the way to establishing your reputation, 
is the Athens Olympic Games.... Thursday, Spain joined 
the expanding club of victims of mega-terrorism. 
Israelis always feel that the understanding for what 
has accompanied them since the very beginning is 
growing, as more blood of citizens of other nations 
entering that club is being spilled.  But this is a 
double-edged sword.  Finally, everybody remembers that 
international terrorism graduated in our neighborhood.\"

payoffs.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Hints of Change?\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(March 12): \"Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan has not been finally formulated, but 
even now it is clear that with his plan, he has 
succeeded into calling into question tactical security 
doctrines that he held and also convinced many other 
people to support.  The significant change that emerges 
from the disengagement plan is that Sharon has 
apparently concluded that the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict has no military solution.... The trouble is 
that there is no certainty at all that the conflict 
with the Palestinians has a political solution.  This 
is what we learned during the tenures of previous prime 
ministers -- Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Ehud 
Barak.  Today, too, the big question is whether the 
current Palestinian leadership, headed by Palestinian 
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, wants to and is 
capable of arriving at a true political solution.  For 
Sharon a fundamental change has occurred with respect 
to the security importance of the Jewish settlements in 
the territories.  He is now adopting the outlook of 
Yitzhak Rabin and Haim Bar-Lev, who said that not all 
the settlements are important for the country\'s 
security.... The significance of Sharon\'s outlook is 
broader -- the doctrine that the importance of 
territory is supreme has been called into question.\" 
 
II.  \"U.S. Planning Versus Israeli Improvisation\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote on page one 
of conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (March 12): 
\"Israel and the U.S. are currently in the midst of an 
intense round of shuttle consultancy.... What is 
emerging from these deliberations are two very 
different styles of doing things: U.S. planning vs. 
Israeli improvisation.  The American penchant to try to 
plan for every eventuality against the Israeli tendency 
to wing it, to do things -- even very big things -- on 
the run.  Nowhere has this Israeli modus operandi been 
more apparent than in the manner in which the country 
is going about building the fence -- first build, then 
chart the route.... This time the Bush administration 
wants, is demanding, to see the details, the fine 
print.... This time around, the Americans want to leave 
as little to chance or Israeli improvisation as 
possible.  For good reason -- it\'s a gamble, and nine 
months before a close election, President George W. 
Bush is not in a gambling mood.  Sharon is embarking on 
something that is completely untested, and he is doing 
it at a time when Bush least needs surprises.\" 
 
III.  \"Even Worse Than Oslo\" 
 
Extreme right-wing columnist Caroline B. Glick wrote on 
page one of Jerusalem Post (March 12): \"In many 
respects Oslo was better than what Sharon is currently 
advocating.... The most stunning aspect of this plan is 
the fact that it is being advanced at the same time as 
another Middle East peace plan that actually could 
bring about a long term change for the better in our 
region.  This plan, the Bush administration\'s Greater 
Middle East Initiative, involves pressuring Arab 
dictatorships like Egypt\'s to democratize.  The very 
existence of the U.S. initiative has already caused 
shockwaves throughout the Arab world.... If successful, 
it will advance U.S. national security interests in the 
region by drying up the swamps of extremism that 
flourish in the darkness of totalitarian regimes.  If 
it fails, the U.S. is no worse off than it is today. 
That is, the plan is low risk and entails a potentially 
enormous payoff.  In sharp contrast, Sharon\'s plan is 
being advanced despite its high risks and unclear 
payoffs.... It emboldens the Europeans and it pushes 
the U.S. into a position where in the interests of 
\'progress\' in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict it will 
be forced to undermine a plan that can actually bring 
peace.\"

UNILATERAL GAZA WITHDRAWAL

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) In a March 10 meeting with the Ambassador, Minister 
of Science and Technology (and Shinui MK) Eliezer Sandberg 
outlined his opposition to unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, 
adding his view that the Israeli public is moving in that 
direction as well.  Sandberg cited three reasons for his 
opposition:  history shows that the withdrawal from Lebanon 
encouraged greater violence and the present intifada; Israeli 
military presence within Gaza is needed for the time being; 
and aversion toward appearing to reward Arafat.  Sandberg 
could support withdrawal from Gaza if it were coupled with 
measures designed to send the message to the Palestinians 
that it did not come without a price (e.g. shifting of 
settler presence to the West Bank), and provide the incentive 
for negotiations.  He would support a unilateral move only if 
the IDF were to signal that continued presence in Gaza is not 
militarily tenable.  Sandberg indicated that he and other 
Shinui members would vote their conscience and not be bound 
by party loyalty if this issue were brought to a Cabinet 
vote.  Turning to science issues, Sandberg expressed 
frustration at the limited budget and clout of his ministry. 
He would like to have closer relations with the USG -- 
particularly on space issues -- and stated that he has 
pressed PM Sharon to embrace nanotechnology in the same 
manner that Israel created the National Water Carrier and 
Dimona nuclear facilities.  Sandberg has been in the Knesset 
since 1992, is Chair of the Shinui Knesset faction and while 
one of the party\'s more right-wing members, is not regarded 
as an influential figure.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Israeli Public Moving Toward Settler Position 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Sandberg, one of 5 Shinui members in the Cabinet, 
opened the meeting by asserting that public sympathy in 
Israel is shifting toward the settler position on Gaza 
withdrawal.  If the Palestinians would only attack soldiers 
protecting the settlements, then public opinion might well 
build for unilateral measures.  But as long as attacks 
continue within Israel, the public sees the value of 
continued Israeli military presence in Gaza.  Sandberg 
outlined three key reasons why he opposes unilateral 
withdrawal.  First, the Lebanon experience demonstrates that 
unilateral withdrawal inspires the Palestinians toward more 
violence.  It gives them hope that through terror they can 
force Israel to run.  Second, Sandberg believes that Israeli 
military presence is still required in Gaza for the time 
being.  The ability to rapidly segregate the Strip into three 
isolated boxes and to control crossroads offers valuable 
security.  Finally, this move will be viewed as rewarding 
Arafat -- \"the partner who betrayed us\" -- and continuing the 
failed Oslo process. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Palestinians Have to Pay a Price 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  The Palestinians must be convinced that there is no 
alternative to negotiation, Sandberg continued, and a price 
must be paid for Gaza withdrawal.  To do otherwise would feed 
the view that time is on the Palestinian side and that the 
Israeli presence in the region is reversible.  He suggests 
that withdrawal from Gaza be coupled with a settler move to 
at least one West Bank area to create facts on the ground 
that will change only through further negotiation.  This 
would accelerate, not retard, efforts to return to 
negotiations.  Sandberg would apply the same approach to the 
separation barrier, pushing deeper into the West Bank with 
the understanding that it could be moved back through 
negotiation.  Planting the barrier close to the 1967 border 
would be the worst case scenario since it would remove any 
incentive for the Palestinians to come to the table.  In the 
end, Sandberg opined, we will evacuate many areas in the 
territories, but \"we must be tough now in order to be soft 
later.\"  How would Sandberg react, the Ambassador queried, if 
the USG were to offer the GOI \"something attractive\" in terms 
of coupling the withdrawal with additional measures in the 
West Bank.  Such a move would be persuasive, the Minister 
replied, since it would provide the Palestinians with an 
incentive to negotiate. 
 
--------------------------- 
Shinui Unity in the Cabinet 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  With respect to whether Shinui will vote as a bloc 
should the withdrawal issue come to a Cabinet vote, Sandberg 
noted that \"it depends on who you ask.\"  He made clear that 
he would not feel bound to follow the party line -- 
suggesting that he is contemplating leaving public office 
anyway at the end of his term -- and indicated that up to 
four Shinui Cabinet members may be prepared to buck the party 
position on unilateral withdrawal.  He will vote his 
conscience, Sandberg continued, and the only set of 
circumstances that could cause him to change his view on a 
unilateral withdrawal would be if the IDF were to declare 
that continuing to stay in Gaza and providing security for 
the settlements was not militarily tenable. 
 
--------------------------- 
Science Ministry Struggling 
--------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  Turning to his role as Minister of Science and 
Technology, Sandberg bemoaned the small budget and clout of 
his ministry.  The three principal foci of his ministry are 
management of 10 R&D centers, support for the Israeli space 
program, and efforts to coordinate GOI positions in key areas 
of applied research.  Sandberg expressed interest in closer 
relations with NASA -- particularly in the fields of science 
education and efforts to send a second Israeli astronaut on 
the shuttle.  He also recounted efforts to expand Israeli 
scientific presence in the global scene, including the recent 
S&T agreement signed with India and discussions with 
Ethiopian officials concerning exchanges in the areas of 
research, education and equipment.  He indicated that he 
intends to participate in the next Earth Observation Summit 
ministerial in Japan.  The Ambassador noted that Israeli 
observers have not been regularly attending meetings of the 
OECD Committee on Science and Technology Policy, a logical 
place for Israeli input on issues of regional and global 
concern.  Sandberg stated that he had only recently become 
aware of this problem, and had asked the Director General of 
the Ministry to resolve the matter.  He reassured the 
Ambassador that Israel was interested in remaining engaged on 
the committee. 
 
6.  (SBU)  In Sandberg\'s view, the GOI should engage in a 
major policy and research initiative in the area of 
nanotechnology.  He suggested to the Prime Minister that an 
effort along the lines of construction of the National Water 
Carrier or the Dimona nuclear facility be dedicated toward 
this field.  Although the GOI could never match the resources 
that the USG and European countries have dedicated, he 
believed that Israeli scientists could establish their niche 
and gain access to international funding.  The Ambassador 
suggested that the U.S.-Israel binational science 
organizations (Binational Industrial Research and Development 
(BIRD), Binational Agricultural Research and Development 
(BARD), Binational Science Foundation (BSF)) might provide a 
convenient mechanism for Israeli scientists to engage U.S. 
counterparts in state-of-the-art research in the field, 
potentially leading to access to additional USG or 
international funding.

Bio Note 
-------- 
 
7.  (C)  Sandberg, a Knesset member since 1992 and Minister 
of Science and Technology since 2003, is one of the Shinui 
party\'s right-wing members.  He is not regarded as one of the 
more vocal or influential members of the party.  Sandberg 
began his political career in the hard-line Tsomet party, 
where he served as legal advisor and secretary general. 
While in Tsomet, he was one of the architects of the 
electoral reform proposals adopted in 1992.  He left the 
party in the late 1990\'s during a round of \"party musical 
chairs,\" when 14 ministers who were not returned to the 
Knesset on their own party lists joined other parties, where 
they were promised a high enough slot on the list to be 
elected.  Sandberg ultimately joined Shinui, and now serves 
as chair of the Shinui Knesset faction. He has served on the 
economics, constitution, law and justice, and science and 
technology committees.  From February 1998-June 1999 he was 
Deputy Minister of Education, Culture and Sport. Sandberg has 
long fought draft deferrals for yeshiva students and the 
stringent Shabbat regulations, and pushed for Israeli 
membership in the European Union.  Sandberg graduated with a 
degree in law from Tel Aviv University.  He delayed his entry 
into the military by participating in the academic reserve, 
eventually serving as a lieutenant in the Army Prosecutor\'s 
Office.  He is married, has three children and speaks Hebrew 
and English.

1.  Mideast 
 
2.  Aftermath of Madrid Bombings 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
With Yediot and Maariv devoting their entire front 
pages to the event, all media led with Sunday 
afternoon\'s double bombings at Ashdod Port, one of the 
most sensitive, strategic and heavily guarded locations 
in Israel.  Ten Israelis were killed and 16 wounded, 
one critically.  Hamas and Fatah\'s Al Aqsa Martyrs 
Brigades jointly claimed responsibility for the 
bombings.  All media cited the beliefs of security 
officials that the two terrorists planned to launch a 
\"mega-terrorist attack\" by blowing themselves up near 
the port\'s bromine tanks.   Leading media reported that 
the meeting between PM Sharon and Palestinian PM Ahmed 
Qurei slated for Tuesday was subsequently canceled. 
Israel Radio reported that the preparatory meeting 
between the PMs\' aides Dov Weisglass and Hassan Abu 
Libdeh was also called off.  Leading media reported 
that the PA condemned the attacks, urged Israel to 
commit itself \"to break the cycle of violence\" and to 
implement the road map.  Jerusalem Post reported that 
scores of Palestinians took to the streets in the Jenin 
and Jabaliya (Gaza Strip) refugee camps to \"celebrate\" 
the attacks.  Leading media reported that Sunday IDF 
troops in the northern Gaza Strip shot dead three 
Palestinians near the border with Israel.  Some media 
reported that the men were attempting to place a large 
bomb on the Karni-Netzarim road.  Leading media also 
reported that 10 Palestinians and an IDF soldier were 
lightly wounded during an anti-fence demonstration near 
Modi\'in Ilit. 
 
Sunday, all media continued to lead with the aftermath 
of Thursday\'s Madrid bombings.  They reported that the 
Spanish arrested three Moroccan and two Indian 
nationals in connection with the attacks, and that Al 
Qaida allegedly released a videotape claiming 
responsibility for the bombings.  All media reported on 
last night\'s victory of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero\'s 
Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) over the Popular Party 
(PP) led by Mariano Rajoy, who the polls predicted 
would win the elections.  The media pointed out that 
the conservative majority paid the price for Thursday\'s 
bombings in Madrid, which are thought to have been 
carried out by Al Qaida, and by the Spanish 
government\'s insistence that Basque separatists were 
behind the attacks.  Yediot quoted Sharon as expressing 
his hope, at Sunday\'s cabinet meeting, that the world 
is awakening to terrorism and that it understands that 
everyone must join forces to fight it. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Secretary of State Colin Powell as 
saying Sunday in interviews with U.S. TV networks that 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan is \"an interesting idea.\" 
The newspaper reported that Powell reiterated the 
United States\' view that Israel should also withdraw 
from West Bank land.  Hatzofe reported that Sunday the 
Council of Jewish Settlements on the Territories 
published a position paper -- \"Enough With the Silence 
of the Lambs\" -- that urges the right-wing ministers to 
voice their opposition to the disengagement plan 
publicly and at once. 
 
On Sunday: Ha\'aretz cited the USG\'s belief that 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan poses risks, but has 
\"historic potential.\"  The newspaper reported that at 
an \"executive forum\" with the senior members of his 
administration, President Bush pushed for support for 
Sharon\'s plan, pending clarifications of details with 
Israel.  (Yediot cited Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz\'s 
belief that Bush would state his support for the 
disengagement plan in coming days.)  Ha\'aretz reported 
that senior Sharon aide Dov Weisglass will leave for 
Washington next week for a new round of talks with 
administration officials before Sharon\'s planned visit. 
Ha\'aretz cited a statement released by Finance Minister 
Binyamin Netanyahu after his meeting with the U.S. 
envoys (Steve Hadley, Elliott Abrams and A/S William 
Burns) indicating that the nature and scope of 
guarantees and assistance to be provided by the U.S. 
remain unclear.  Yediot quoted a Netanyahu associate as 
saying following the meeting: \"The Americans will not 
give Sharon anything in exchange for the potentially 
disastrous plan.  Ha\'aretz quoted Mofaz as saying in 
Washington that the security model to be followed in 
the Gaza Strip is simple, since the region is 
surrounded by a fence, but that the situation in the 
West Bank is more complicated.   Hatzofe reported that 
FM Silvan Shalom told Likud Central Committee members 
last Wednesday that a meeting between Sharon and Bush 
has been set, in principle, for March 29.  Maariv 
reported that the PA has devised a plan for taking over 
the Gaza Strip after the IDF withdrawal, including the 
unification of the Palestinian security branches and 
the prevention of rocket firing at Israel; a campaign 
calling for law abiding; and cooperation with religious 
leaders 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Palestinian sources as saying Sunday 
that the PA has released four Palestinians from the 
Gaza Strip who were suspected of carrying out a deadly 
bombing of a U.S. diplomatic convoy on October 15. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post quoted Sharon as saying 
Sunday that Israel has no intention of allowing the 
burial in Ramallah of Palestinian Liberation Front 
leader Abu al-Abbas, who died in Iraq, contrary to PA 
Chairman Yasser Arafat\'s wish.  Yediot reported that 
Balad Knesset Member Ahmed Bishara consoled Arafat over 
al-Abbas\'s death. 
 
Sunday, all media reported on the Kurdish riots in the 
northern Syrian town of Qamishli. 
During the weekend, the media predicted a tight contest 
between Yossi Beilin and Meretz MK Ran Cohen for the 
leadership of the new left-wing party Yahad. 
 
Sunday, Yediot cited the anger of Foreign Ministry 
officials over the fact that the former chief rabbis 
Mordechai Eliyahu and Yisrael Meir Lau were required to 
leave their fingerprints at the U.S. Embassy, even 
though they have diplomatic passports.  The newspaper 
quoted   U.S. embassy officials as saying that they 
regretted the imposition, but that they insisted that 
those were the regulations and noted that Rabbi Lau and 
former defense minister Moshe Arens had both gone to 
the embassy to be fingerprinted. 
 
Sunday, Yediot quoted American sources as saying 
Saturday that U.S. Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer has 
recently expressed his dissatisfaction over the fact 
that IDF officers travel in Japanese or European cars, 
while the U.S. is transferring millions of dollars to 
Israel.  The newspaper quoted GOI sources as saying 
that American cars are too big and American car 
manufacturers should make attractive bids to compete on 
the GOI market, \"like everybody else.\" 
 
Sunday, Ha\'aretz cited the belief of Greek sources that 
Greece will allow armed Shin Bet personnel to guard 
Israel\'s delegation at the Athens Olympic Games.  The 
assessment came after Greek media reported over the 
weekend that U.S. armed guards would be allowed to 
provide security for the American delegation at the 
Games. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Sunday family members of 
the crew of the Columbia space shuttle that crashed 
last year arrived in Israel for a week-long visit. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted officials at the Simon Wiesenthal 
Center in Los Angeles -- and Yediot sources at Israel\'s 
Consulate-General in Los Angeles -- as saying Sunday 
that California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger will be 
in Israel for the ground-breaking of the Museum of 
Tolerance in Jerusalem.  Maariv reported that during 
his upcoming visit to Los Angeles, FM Silvan Shalom 
will finalize the details of Schwarzenegger\'s trip to 
Israel. 
 
Leading media cited the results of a Tel Aviv 
University poll: 
-Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that 56 percent 
of Israelis support Sharon\'s disengagement plan. 
(Yediot reported that the support rate in the survey 
was 68 percent.)  Jerusalem Post reported that the 
support rate drops to 50 percent if it is contingent on 
dismantling settlements. 
-60 percent support inclusion of \"the larger, populated 
areas [settlements] of Judea and Samaria [the West 
Bank]\" on the western part of the fence. 
-71 percent object to the idea of building the fence on 
the Green Line. 
-Only 24 percent of respondents state their absolute 
support for the Geneva Accord.

------------ 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: 
\"Current developments tend to support [a prediction] 
that the moment Israel evinced its readiness to carry 
out a unilateral withdrawal, the Palestinian 
organizations would make a concerted effort to show 
that Israel is retreating under military pressure.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz editorialized: \"[Sharon] deserves credit for 
the very fact of raising the initiative, but he will 
pay a heavy political price if it turns out that he 
failed to carry it through.\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in Ha\'aretz: 
\"A party that believes in a peace agreement based on 
the 1967 borders will have a hard time explaining to 
its voters why it turned its back on a move that brings 
Israel closer to those very borders.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Militants Want Israel to Retreat Under Fire\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(March 15): \"Cooperation between Hamas and Fatah in an 
attack such as Sunday\'s strike at the Ashdod port, is 
nothing new.  This operational cooperation has 
solidified over the past several weeks.  For Hamas, the 
development is a major achievement: It has succeeded in 
building a kind of joint military apparatus with the 
Fatah establishment.... Current developments tend to 
support an assessment offered by Major General Aharon 
Zeevi (Farkash), head of Military Intelligence, who 
predicted that the moment Israel evinced its readiness 
to carry out a unilateral withdrawal, the Palestinian 
organizations would make a concerted effort to show 
that Israel is retreating under military pressure.\" 
 
II.  \"Lost in the Mist\" 
Ha\'aretz editorialized (March 15): \"Ever since Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon announced his dramatic initiative 
for a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the 
steps he is taking to implement his plan have been 
clouded in mist.... Sharon will be making a grave 
mistake by assuming he\'ll be able to bury the Gaza 
withdrawal plan and lay the blame for this at the feet 
of the other side.  He deserves credit for the very 
fact of raising the initiative, but he will pay a heavy 
political price if it turns out that he failed to carry 
it through.\" 
 
III.  \"Joining the Disengagement Government\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in Ha\'aretz 
(March 15): \"There is only one political course of 
action worse than disengaging from territories in the 
Gaza Strip and West Bank without getting anything in 
return and without coordination with the Palestinian 
side -- not disengaging from the territories.  There is 
only one political course of action worse than the 
Labor Party\'s support for Ariel Sharon\'s disengagement 
plan -- opposition to the plan.... A party that 
purports to fly the flag of peace cannot stand idly by 
when the prime minister needs its support for a peace 
initiative.  A party that believes in a peace agreement 
based on the 1967 borders will have a hard time 
explaining to its voters why it turned its back on a 
move that brings Israel closer to those very borders.\" 
 
IV.  \"Wandering in a Fog\" 
 
Correspondent Efraim Ganor wrote in popular, pluralist 
Russian-language Novosty Nedely (March 14): \"The 
unilateral disengagement plan\'s particulars are still 
covered with ... fog.  The U.S.  is unable to define 
its attitude regarding it ... and [determine] the 
strong and the weak sides of the plan.  It is unclear 
what the plan\'s completion would bring Israel, the 
Palestinians and the U.S....  Doubtfully, Sharon 
himself and his closest advisors have definite answers 
to these questions.   In addition, the [Israeli] 
security forces have ... objections against the plan, 
arguing that in its present form, it cannot be executed 
without clear agreements with the Palestinians. ... 
Sharon sincerely tries to get his country and his 
people out of the old and bloody conflict with the 
Palestinians, and he is sure that Israel has to do it 
unilaterally as opposed to coordination with the 
Palestinians.  Any agreement would force Israel make 
more significant concessions than those it is ready to 
carry out in a unilateral disengagement.\"

                       -------- 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized: \"U.S. 
President George W. Bush\'s demand that countries around 
the world take a stand and show who is in favor of

Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the lead editorial of Yediot Aharonot: 
\"Even if it becomes evident that Al Qaida indeed bears 
full responsibility for the terrorism in Spain, on whom 
will the demonstrators vent their anger?  You guessed 
correctly: on the United States, of course.\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"The longer Europe waits to join with America in common

cause of freedom and human rights will prosper.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"World at War\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (March 
14): \"Europe has been roused from its slumber. Terror 
is not limited to New York and Washington, Bali and 
Mombasa, Russia and Israel.  Courting the favor of Arab 
and Muslim populations in whose name terror purports to 
strike -- even though this population has not 
authorized the terror -- will not tame the beast.... 
Judging by the response displayed by the Spanish 
people, Europeans are not showing a precious degree of 
unity and joining the alliance of victims being led by 
the Americans.  Should terror not be vanquished in a 
long, hard struggle waged around the world, the way of 
life cherished by citizens of free states will be 
undermined.  U.S. President George W. Bush\'s demand 
that countries around the world take a stand and show 
who is in favor of wiping out terror is simplistic, yet 
just.\" 
 
II.  \"The Politics of Mourning\" 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the lead editorial of Yediot Aharonot 
(March 14): \"According to the contemporary European 
cultural rulebook, the terrorism of the 21st century is 
nameless, faceless and without religious identity. 
Terrorism is repressed as an abstract threat or, at the 
very most, a threat that stems from age-old internal 
European conflicts.  But to demonstrate explicitly 
against Islamic terror?  To send millions into the 
street to that end?  Heaven forbid.  That is 
politically incorrect, unmulti-cultural and 
frightening.   Mass anti-American demonstrations were a 
common feature of Western European cities throughout 
the duration of the Cold War.  Not a single 
demonstration was held in them at the time against the 
USSR and the Soviet regime. This spectacle is now 
repeating itself in reference to radical Islam.  The 
European code of conduct permits only demonstrations 
against imperialism, and not against Al Qaida. 
Therefore, even if it becomes evident that Al Qaida 
indeed bears full responsibility for the terrorism in 
Spain, on whom will the demonstrators vent their anger? 
You guessed correctly: on the United States, of 
course.\" 
 
III.  \"It\'s a World War\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 14): \"From Bali, Casablanca, and Manhattan to 
Moscow, New Delhi, and Madrid, the evidence is too 
vast, clear, and appalling to ignore: the world is at 
war.... Spain and the rest of Europe must understand 
that, just like last century\'s threat to their future 
was fascism, this century it is the militant form of 
Islam, and that just like Nazism\'s in its time, the 
jihad\'s excuses for its mass-murders are not even worth 
a hearing.  Europe must concede it is at war, and has 
no choice but to fight it until it is won.  The jihadis 
see Europe and America as a common enemy against which 
they hope to play divide and conquer.  The longer 
Europe waits to join with America in common cause, the 
more the war will escalate and spread, including within 
Europe.  The sooner Europe joins the fight, the sooner 
these massacres will end and the cause of freedom and 
human rights will prosper.\"

TAGS: PTER, KWBG, ASEC, PREL, PGOV, IS, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS, COUNTERTERRORISM 
SUBJECT: UNUSUAL FACTORS IN ASHDOD BOMBINGS INVITE 
SPECULATION ABOUT NEW TURN IN INTIFADA 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Richard LeBaron for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Several atypical elements of Sunday\'s dual 
suicide bombing at the Ashdod port have led Israelis to worry 
that Hamas and Fatah meant what they said when they announced 
that the attack, for which the two groups claimed 
responsibility, signalled a new phase in the Intifada.  The 
attack appeared to be the first in Israel during the current 
Intifada carried out by Palestinian attackers who entered the 
country from Gaza.  That the attackers targeted economic 
infrastructure was also unusual for this Intifada.  A DAO 
source at the port confirmed police speculation in the media 
that the explosives were more powerful and of better quality 
than those usually deployed in Palestinian terror attacks, 
thus suggesting a possible foreign origin of the explosives. 
The source cast doubts, however, on speculation that the 
attackers could have ruptured or ignited chemical tanks at 
the port, reporting that the nearest \"chemical storage\" was 
at least half a mile from the bombing site.  In retaliation 
for the bombings, the IAF fired missiles at two metal shops 
in Gaza City overnight, lightly wounding one Palestinian. 
Critics of Sharon\'s Gaza disengagement plan will view this 
attack as evidence that the terror groups are set on creating 
the impression that Israel is withdrawing from Gaza under 
fire.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Two Palestinian teenagers from the Jabalya refugee 
camp in Gaza killed ten Israelis March 14 in a dual suicide 
bombing at the port of Ashdod.  IDF and port sources told DAO 
that one of the bombers detonated inside, and one outside, 
the port facility.  According to these sources, port 
authorities believe that the bomber who detonated outside the 
facility boosted the other bomber over the fence surrounding 
the facility at a place where the wire netting on top of the 
fence had sagged.  Each of the bombers then entered, and 
detonated in, the nearest sites with people inside: a 
forklift maintenance facility inside the port, and a 
refrigeration warehouse outside. 
 
3. (C) Hamas and Fatah jointly claimed responsibility for the 
attack in a message claiming that the attack signalled the 
\"next stage of the armed Intifada.\"  Several apparently 
unusual or even unprecedented aspects of the attack lent 
weight to GOI concerns that the attack might indeed represent 
a qualitatively new turn in terrorist tactics: 
 
-- Whereas attacks on Israeli civilians typically take place 
against soft targets with the primary goal of killing as many 
Israelis as possible, the attack in Ashdod, while still 
murderous in intent, took place at a well-guarded facility of 
strategic economic value.  In attacking, however, the first 
buildings in which they encountered Israelis, the terrorists 
did not appear intent on causing maximum economic damage. 
The symbolic value of hitting a sensitive, economically 
important target appeared sufficient in this case.  (A 
similar attack that did not succeed was directed in May 2002 
at the Pi Glilot fuel storage facility just north of Tel 
Aviv.  In that attack, a bomb surreptitiously placed under a 
fuel truck exploded insided the storage facility, but failed 
to detonate any fuel in the truck or the storage tanks.) 
 
-- If in fact the two bombers entered Israel from Gaza, the 
attack would represent the first time in the current Intifada 
that any Gazans succeeded in crossing the border fence to 
carry out an attack within Israel.  The Embassy had no 
indication from the IDF as of mid-day March 15 about the 
route the bombers might have taken to enter Israel.  (Besides 
getting through or over the Gaza fence, other possible exit 
routes from Gaza would include being admitted to Israel at 
the Erez crossing, or entering Israel from the Sinai after 
crossing from Gaza to Egypt via a tunnel.) 
 
-- A port official told DAO that the bombers used explosives 
of greater potency and quality than the bombs usually 
detonated by Palestinian terrorists.  He assessed that the 
explosives were not homemade, thus giving credence to media 
speculation that the explosives might have come from 
Hizballah or other sources from outside the territories. 
 
-- Media speculated that the attackers might have sought to 
rupture storage tanks of bromide or ammonia, or to ignite 
fuel tanks, thus causing mass casualties in a wide area 
around the port.  According to DAO sources, however, the 
bombers detonated in the first buildings they encountered 
with Israelis inside.  These sources said that the nearest 
\"chemical storage\" to the site of the bombings was at least 
half a mile away. 
 
4. (SBU) In response to the Ashdod attack, IAF helicopters 
fired about ten missiles overnight into two Gaza City metal 
shops that the GOI alleged were used for producing and 
storing rockets and other munitions.  UNRWA reported that one 
Palestinian, the owner of one of the shops, was lightly 
wounded. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: This atypical attack by Gazans in Israel, 
coupled with the recent string of attacks at the Erez 
Crossing, will likely be used to support the case made by 
those like Military Intelligence Chief Farkash who argue that 
Sharon\'s Gaza disengagement plan will provoke intensified 
terrorism in the run-up to withdrawal.  Farkash reportedly 
assesses that terrorist groups are anxious to duplicate the 
image from Lebanon in May 2000 of Israel retreating under 
fire.

 This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary.  Baruch Spiegel, Israeli coordinator on 
humanitarian issues related to the separation barrier, told 
donors March 11 that he and his team are trying to find 
solutions to a variety of localized problems brought to its 
attention and is trying to apply \"lessons learned\" from 
previous mistakes.  He said that, based on dialogue with 
Palestinian officials and residents, a large number of 
changes have been made to the proposed route and opening 
times for gates had been increased. Spiegel said his team is 
in the process of mapping potential bottlenecks that could be 
created by the Jerusalem portion of the barrier and would try 
to devise solutions. The legal advisor on Spiegel\'s team said 
there is no intention to permanently confiscate land, calling 
the actions taken up to now \"temporary seizures\" of land, for 
which compensation will be given.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Spiegel - We\'re Learning From Past Mistakes 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  Spiegel said that his team was tasked to find 
solutions to specific problems brought to its attention and 
to implement \"lessons learned\" from areas where the barrier 
was built and caused serious problems for local residents. 
Spiegel emphasized that he is a \"coordinator of fence-related 
humanitarian issues,\" not an \"ombudsman\" to whom every issue 
related to the barrier should be directed.  Residents facing 
problems caused by the barrier, he said, should contact local 
MATAK offices, just as before.  He stated, however, that his 
team would \"deal immediately\" with any problems brought to 
its attention by NGOs, Palestinian officials or others.  His 
office is engaged in \"intensive dialogues\" with Palestinian 
officials and residents of several areas affected by the 
barrier (he provided no specific details).  \"We will give 
answers,\" as a result of this dialogue, he said, \"and those 
answers may result in changes to previous decisions about the 
route of the fence.\"  He noted, as an example, the changes to 
the route near Baqa al Sharqiya (reftel).  He also noted that 
opening times for gates around Qalqilya had been extended to 
90 minutes, from as little as 20 minutes previously.  Spiegel 
insisted that complaints about the impact of the barrier on 
local residents had decreased markedly.  In the past, Spiegel 
continued, the humanitarian aspect was not part of the 
planning process.  Now it is.  \"We are checking every meter 
of the fence and if the humanitarian dimension comes into 
play, we are dealing with it.\" 
 
------------------ 
Focus on Jerusalem 
------------------ 
 
3. (SBU)  The most difficult and complicated part of the 
route is around Jerusalem, said Spiegel.  He said his team 
was in the process of mapping \"weak points\" and bottlenecks 
caused by the proposed route near Jerusalem, and would try to 
devise solutions.  Part of the solution, Spiegel added, might 
include new technology that will make passage easier and less 
intrusive, perhaps through \"smart cards\" or other means. 
Travel and car permits for travel through crossings around 
Jerusalem are \"big, complicated issues,\" he said.   He noted 
that the police, not the IDF, are responsible for issuing 
these permits for Jerusalem entry. 
 
--------------- 
Training is Key 
--------------- 
 
4. (SBU)  Spiegel reiterated points he had made to us 
previously (reftel) about the importance of training 
personnel who will be manning crossing points. His team will 
work closely with the IDF and the police, he said.  Training 
would focus on how to correctly deal with civilians. \"A high 
standard of service\" would be mandated, he said.  He said 
passing a special exam would eventually be required before 
personnel are assigned to these stations. Because of urgent 
personnel needs, however, the IDF is making do with \"on the 
job training\" at present. 
 
------------- 
Legal Aspects 
------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Spiegel said ten legal petitions about the barrier, 
3 general in nature and 7 about particular land issues, had 
been received by the Israeli High Court of Justice.  The 
Israeli authorities were paying very close attention, he 
said, to property rights, and had a clear preference to build 
on \"public land\" vs. \"private land.\"   In response to 
questions from the donors, Michael Bendavid of the 
International Law Department of the IDF said that Palestinian 
landowners affected by the barrier were entitled to 
compensation.  Claims that Israel would invoke laws to 
confiscate private land were untrue, he said.  Specifically, 
the GOI would not invoke legal procedures that cause 
agriculture land that has been unused for three or more years 
to become \"public land.\"  To do so would be illegal and in 
bad faith, he said.  Bendavid said the GOI had \"temporarily 
seized\" some private land to build the barrier, but the land 
would be returned after a final peace settlement. 
Compensation for private owners, akin to rental payments, he 
said, was being set aside.  It was IDF experience, he 
continued, that owners would eventually come forward and 
claim the compensation. (Comment: The donors have good reason 
to question Spiegel and Bendavid about the confiscation of 
land.  In the past, the GOI used laws such as the three-year 
rule mentioned above to declare much of the West Bank\'s land 
\"public.\"  Indeed some of this \"public\" land is used as farm 
land by Palestinians.  Moreover, some land that has been 
\"temporarily seized\" has become de facto permanent GOI 
property, subject of course to changes mandated by any future 
peace deal.  Much of the land used to build by-pass roads for 
settlements, for example, was \"temporarily seized.\"  End 
comment.) 
 
------------------------------ 
No Comment on \"Depth Barriers\" 
------------------------------ 
 
6.  (SBU)  Spiegel would not comment on specific route 
changes being considered.  In response to a question about 
secondary fences or \"depth barriers,\" Spiegel said such 
decisions were not in his mandate and he would not comment. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  The meeting broke little new ground, but did 
provide a forum for key donors to hear directly from Spiegel 
about the work of his committee and to raise specific issues 
of concern. While several donors continue to worry that these 
exchanges suggest a legitimization of the barrier, most 
recognize the value of maintaining lines of communication.

TAGS: ECON, PBTS, IS, SETTLEMENTS, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS 
SUBJECT: HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IN WEST BANK/GAZA SETTLEMENTS 
INCREASES SUBSTANTIALLY IN 2003 
 
Classified By: DCM Richard LeBaron for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary.  Newly released statistics indicate that 
housing starts in West Bank and Gaza settlements increased 
35% in 2003, in a year when total housing starts in Israel 
and the settlements dropped 8% compared to 2002 figures.  The 
great majority of the new housing appears to be within \"the 
Jerusalem district,\" that includes settlements surrounding 
but not within the city\'s municipal border (examples are 
Ma\'ale Adumim, Givat Ze\'ev, and Beitar Illit.)  Housing 
starts in central West Bank settlements, however, also 
increased markedly.  A contact at the Ministry of 
Construction and Housing insisted that the increase did not 
reflect any new policy to build more housing in the 
settlements, but reflected decisions made in 2001 and 2002, 
when the planning process to build the new housing began. 
Building in the West Bank and Gaza Strip settlements 
accounted for 16% of all government-initiated housing 
construction in 2003, despite the area only accounting for 4 
percent of the Israeli population.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
CBS Statistics Show 35% Increase 
in Housing Starts in Territories 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)   Statistics released March 2 by the Central Bureau 
of Statistics indicated that housing starts (actual 
construction initiated) in West Bank and Gaza settlements 
jumped from 1,369 starts in 2002 to 1,849 starts in 2003, a 
35% increase.  The CBS statistics covered both public and 
private construction. The 35% jump compared to an 8% drop 
overall in housing starts in Israel and the settlements. 
Housing starts declined in every city or region in Israel 
surveyed, except Haifa (where housing starts grew 5%). 
Housing starts in the territories accounted for about 6% of 
total public and private housing starts in Israel and the 
settlements.

Ministry of Housing Statistics Show the Same Trend 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3.  (U)  Provisional Ministry of Construction and Housing 
data showed similar trends to the CBS statistics and provided 
more detail about where the housing is being built. 
MOCH-sponsored construction in the settlements increased 48% 
in 2003 over 2002 levels.  The great majority of that 
construction took place in areas of the West Bank within \"the 
Jerusalem District\" which includes settlements like Ma\'ale 
Adumim and Beitar Illit but not settlements like Har Homa 
within the Jerusalem municipality.  Housing starts in the 
West Bank areas of the Jerusalem District increased from 717 
starts in 2002 to 1,034 starts in 2003.  Construction in the 
\"central\" area of the West Bank nearly doubled, from 55 
starts in 2002 to 107 in 2003.  Construction in settlements 
accounted for 16% of all MOCH-sponsored housing construction 
in 2003.

4.  (SBU)  Contacts at the Central Bureau of Statistics would 
not comment on the significance of the increase in housing 
starts in the territories, except to note the strong contrast 
with the overall drop in housing starts throughout Israel.  A 
contact at the Ministry of Construction and Housing insisted 
that the 2003 increase in settlement housing starts did not 
reflect any recent policy decision to increase housing in 
settlements.  He noted that the planning process for new 
housing typically takes well over one year.  The increase in 
housing starts in 2003, he said, reflected planning decisions 
made in 2001 and 2002. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  Although the rise in housing starts in the 
territories may not reflect a recent government decision to 
prioritize housing in the settlements, it does reflect the 
GOI\'s decision not to enforce commitments it has made to 
freeze settlement activity.  Whether building decisions were 
made two years ago or the Ministry of Construction and 
Housing (led by vocal settlement proponent Effie Eitam) is 
pushing its own agenda, the simple fact is that new housing 
is being built in the settlements.  This is taking place 
despite a depressed housing market, significant existing 
vacancy rates, and a dangerous security environment.  End 
comment.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Deputy State Department 
Spokesman J. Adam Ereli condemned the double Ashdod 
bombings in the strongest terms.  Leading media 
reported that the main working assumption among 
security officials is that the two suicide bombers who 
carried out the attack made their way from the Gaza 
Strip into Israel via an underground tunnel.  The media 
reported that IAF helicopters bombed two Gaza City 
workshops before dawn Monday in response to the attack, 
and that the inner security cabinet is likely to 
authorize further military actions.  The media reported 
on various violent incidents in the Gaza Strip Monday, 
including a missile attack on a bus transporting 
settlers\' children, and today.  Warning about a further 
security blooper, Maariv reported that fuel trucks from 
Iraq are entering Israel freely at the Arava border 
crossing with Jordan, following American pressure and 
against the objection of Israeli security elements. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Monday PA Chairman Yasser Arafat 
refused his cabinet\'s call to use the Palestinian 
security forces against terrorist organizations, 
following Sunday\'s double Ashdod bombings, for which 
both Fatah and Hamas claimed responsibility. 
 
All media reported (banners in all media, except 
Ha\'aretz) that Tuesday a 10 to 12-year-old Palestinian 
boy (depending on the media) carrying a bomb that was 
to be activated by means of a cellular phone, was 
arrested by the security forces at a roadblock near 
Nablus.  Tanzim activists had sent him with the 
intention of blowing him up next to IDF soldiers. 
 
Yediot and Ha\'aretz reported that the Knesset has 
received warnings that terrorist organizations are 
planning to send letter bombs to Israeli public 
figures. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that the State Attorney\'s 
Office informed the High Court of Justice Monday that 
the state has decided to re-examine the planned route 
of a several-kilometer section of the security fence 
slated to be constructed near the West Bank village of 
Na\'alin just north of Modi\'in.  The area has been the 
scene of violent Palestinian anti-fence demonstrations 
over the last few days.  In what it says is a move by 
thousands of people, Ha\'aretz cited unofficial 
estimates that some 300 Palestinians with Israeli ID 
cards, who had been living east of the so-called 
\"Jerusalem envelope\" fence, are returning to 
Jerusalem\'s municipal area every week.  They are 
reportedly driven by the fear of losing social and 
economic benefits as a result of being cut off from the 
city. 
 
Maariv reported that the U.S. Administration is 
checking into, and is likely to take up a proposal from 
the Prime Minister\'s Office that it invest funds in 
building communities and developing industry in the 
Negev, instead of providing monetary compensation to 
evacuated settlers.  The newspaper quoted a GOI source 
as saying Monday that this is a winning idea, and that 
by adopting it, \"the Americans will help Israel move 
from an age of confrontation to an age of impetus and 
prosperity.  A Maariv headline reads: \"Bush Will Make 
the Negev Bloom.\" 
 
All media reported that the government survived a no- 
confidence vote on Sharon\'s disengagement plan at the 
Knesset, 46-45. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted senior PA officials as saying 
that at least 140 Palestinians have been arrested in 
the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the Intifada on 
charges of collaborating with Israel. 
 
All media reported that Monday the Knesset paid its 
respects to the victims of Thursday\'s Madrid bombings, 
as the Spanish Ambassador to Israel, Eudaldo Mirapeix, 
and a EU delegation watched from the gallery.  The 
media quoted Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin (Likud) as 
saying: \"The enemies of humanity have struck again. 
Exactly two-and-a-half years after the horrific 
spectacle of September 11, innocent civilians have once 
again been massacred, and once again the free world has 
been perceived by its enemies as weak and impotent.\" 
Jerusalem Post quoted diplomatic sources in Jerusalem 
as saying that the electoral defeat of Spanish PM Jose 
Maria Aznar\'s Popular Party has deprived Israel of an 
\"understanding\" European government that was attentive 
to its problems. 
 
Italian FM Franco Frattini, who is due to arrive in 
Israel on a visit tonight, was quoted as saying in an 
interview with Maariv that Israel\'s security and the 
fight against terrorism constitute matters of primary 
importance in the road map.  Frattini was also quoted 
as saying that Italy will not withdraw its forces from 
Iraq and that there can be no compromise with 
terrorism.  Yediot cited the Italian daily Corriere 
Della Sera as saying that the Mossad warned Italy that 
it is one of Al Qaida\'s next targets.  Ha\'aretz 
reported that Israel\'s political Right is trying to 
enlist Christian support in Europe -- an equivalent of 
the kind of support it has found among fundamentalists 
in the U.S. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Israel could return 40 
million shekels (around USD 8.89 million) it 
confiscated from Palestinian banks in Ramallah last 
month. 
Ha\'aretz quoted Seif al-Islam Qadhafi, the son of 
Libya\'s leader Muammar Qadhafi, as saying in an 
interview with the London-based Al-Hayat that his 
country armed itself with WMD for the purpose of a war 
with Israel. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Francis Fukuyama, a former staff member 
of the U.S. State Department and the author of the 1992 
essay \"The End of History,\" as saying Monday at Tel 
Aviv University, among a panel that included Finance 
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Labor Party Shimon 
Peres, that the struggle against terrorism is not a 
conflict between civilizations.  Fukuyama claimed at 
the meeting that fanatical Islam -- \"the periphery of 
history\" -- has a fateful influence on \"the center,\" 
i.e. the West.

I.  \"Lots of Trouble\" 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one 
of popular, pluralist Maariv (March 16): \"It is not 
inconceivable that Ariel Sharon might ultimately have 
to forget his grand plan, quash the medium-sized one 
and go for the small version: a partial withdrawal from 
Gaza, keeping the three northern settlements intact, 
the fate of Philadelphi [the corridor at the Gaza-Egypt 
border] unclear.  By so doing he will neutralize most 
of the opposition and will crush the rebellion in the 
Likud before its inception.... Ariel Sharon is in 
trouble.  If he opts for the grand plan he will lose 
his coalition, perhaps even his party, and maybe even 
his seat as prime minister.  Binyamin Netanyahu is in 
trouble.  If he acts against Sharon, he will be 
gambling on his political future and will lose public 
points.  If he doesn\'t, the same applies.  The two of 
them, Sharon and Netanyahu, are trapped.  They are both 
searching for a dignified way out.  Bibi [Netanyahu] 
has spoken in the past number of days staunchly against 
the disengagement plan.  Sharon has tried to speak in 
its favor, but without success.... The way things look 
now, the wind in Sharon\'s sails is slowly dying out. 
His principled determination still exists, but life 
looks more complicated than ever before.  The Israelis 
made it clear to the Americans that in any event, no 
steps would be taken on the ground before the summer of 
2005.  Sharon won\'t be going to Washington this month, 
but only next month (maybe).  The Americans are looking 
forward to the Arab League convening at the end of this 
month and to an explicit condemnation of suicide 
bombing attacks, and don\'t want to ruin that 
achievement.\" 
 
II.  \"Sharon\'s Disengagement Has Long Been Bilateral\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar opined in left-leaning, 
independent Ha\'aretz (March 16): \"Arafat\'s court does 
not want Sharon\'s court spoiling its victory 
celebration.  They are keeping one important fact under 
wraps: Sharon\'s unilateral disengagement has long been 
bilateral.  The Palestinians decided 30 years ago to 
take any shred of land that falls into their hands.... 
That decision, which involves the liberation of all 
Palestinian lands and the annihilation of Israel, is 
known as \'the plan of the stages.\'  In 1988, it made 
way for the Algiers Declaration, which recognized 
Security Council Resolution 242 requiring Israeli 
withdrawal only from territory conquered during the Six- 
Day War.  In the Oslo accords, the PLO agreed to 
receive the territories in stages.... The fact that the 
PLO leadership is not wiping away a tear at Israel\'s 
departure from Gaza in exchange for nothing does not 
keep it from going around the world with downcast 
demeanor.  Why would they miss the opportunity to 
present Israel as the party that buried the road map 
under the outposts of Israeli trespassers in the West 
Bank and the ruins of the homes of innocent 
Palestinians in Gaza?\" 
 
III.  \"Take Him Seriously\" 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in 
Ha\'aretz (March 16): \"The first thing on [Sharon\'s] 
list is to win the consent and support of President 
Bush.  Sharon is obsessive about coordinating every 
step of the way with him.  Next comes working out the 
operation in detail, preferably with the approval of 
the Strip\'s 7,500 settlers.  From start to finish, the 
pullback should be wrapped up in a year or two.  While 
this is happening, Sharon will drum up political 
support for the move.... But Sharon is the one who will 
choose the timing.... Sharon has gone too far to assume 
that he is kidding around with his people, America and 
our potential allies in Europe, now waking up to the 
grim reality of mega-terrorism.  Until proven 
otherwise, there is no reason not to take him 
seriously.\" 
 
IV.  \"Don\'t Bother the President Now\" 
 
Former minister of foreign affairs and former minister 
of defense Moshe Arens wrote in Ha\'aretz (March16): 
\"For now, it does not look like the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict will be one of the prominent issues in the 
[U.S. presidential] election.  So what does ... it have 
to do with Sharon\'s plans for unilateral disengagement 
in Gaza and the uprooting of Israeli settlements?  Not 
much really, unless the execution of this plan ends up 
in an escalation of violence in the area that blows up 
in Bush\'s face, highlighting another problem that his 
rival can accuse him of having created.  Bush probably 
prefers to leave the issue well enough alone.  But 
that\'s not the way the Prime Minister\'s Office sees 
it.... As summer approaches and the American election 
campaign heats up, it is not likely that the U.S. 
Administration will endorse Sharon\'s plan.  Everything 
is going to have to be put on hold until after 
November.  And by then, everything may look different - 
- in Israel, in the United States, and maybe even among 
the Palestinians.  In the meantime, pursue the war 
against terrorism and don\'t bother the President.\"

I.  \"Comfort Now\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (March 16): \"Europe is not 
prepared yet to face the difficult, pan-human reality 
of non-state-based Islamic terror, which seeks to 
acquire weapons of mass destruction.  It suffers from 
myopia because the politicians there are trying to woo 
the Moslem voters who have flooded many of their 
countries; and because the shifting feelings of 
superiority and inferiority about the U.S. plays a key 
role in undermining the recognition of America\'s role 
in defending the values of the West; and mainly because 
the peoples and governments on the old continent are 
focused on comfort now, and not on any real sacrifice 
for the sake of a better future later.  Al Qaida, 
Hizbullah and radical Islam do not aspire to achieve a 
compromise.  They want to regain control over Andalusia 
in Spain, and not only to punish it for sending 1,400 
troops to Iraq.  They have succeeded in deceiving the 
voters in Madrid and Barcelona, as if their objectives 
were restricted and all the voters needed to do was to 
oust from power a government that helped Bush against 
an awful tyrant like Saddam Hussein.  Israel was first, 
but is not alone.... If Madrid still refuses to 
understand the significance of the events, the Jewish 
state has no choice.\" 
 
II.  \"Spanish Democracy\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 16): \"The Al-Qaida manifesto [released after the 
Madrid bombings] spoke menacingly of a \'Winds of Black 
Death\' operation against the U.S., which it said was 90 
percent complete.  This may or may not be a bluff. 
What\'s certain is that if terrorist groups believe they 
can alter the outcome of Spain\'s election, why not 
attempt to alter the outcome of America\'s?  In the 
immediate aftermath of Thursday\'s bombing, the first 
question on everyone\'s mind was \'Who did it?\'  Then the 
question became \'Why?\'  If people in democratic nations 
persuade themselves that the answer is the war in Iraq 
-- and, more broadly, the American-led war on terror -- 
they will have handed al-Qaida the very thing it 
seeks.\"

ignores the cultural and educational aspects of the

credibility and seriousness of the U.S. Administration 
as well.  How would the U.S. administrations welcome 
the results of this democracy if it conflicts with the 
U.S. economic and political interests in the region? 
It has been proved that the Americans are looking for a 
special type of democracy, which brings \'acceptable\'

1. (SBU) SUMMARY. In a visit to Israel March 2-4, Under Secretary of 
Commerce Kenneth I. Juster, head of the Bureau of Industry and Security 
met with high-ranking Israeli officials, as well as with both Israeli a 
leaders from the private and public sectors in Israel\'s hi-tech and def 
industries.  U/S Juster discussed U.S.-Israel cooperation in the area o 
technology trade, held meetings with BIS\'s Israeli counterparts in the 
met with leading private and public sector players in Israel\'s sophisti 
and defense sectors.  Throughout the meetings with GOI officials, Juste 
U.S. government concerns about the worsening U.S. trade deficit with Is 
U/S urged Israeli government officials to reexamine specific policies a 
that restrict the ability of U.S. companies to compete in Israel and al 
affect the interests of Israeli consumers.  In particular, Juster discu 
Israeli procurement practices that fail to promote transparent and fair 
the lack of protection of certain intellectual property rights, and the 
enacting technical standards and regulations that do not discourage U.S 
from competing for business in Israel.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Meeting with Vice Prime Minister Olmert 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (SBU)  Under Secretary Juster told Vice PM and Minister of Industry 
Olmert that he was \"alarmed\" by the rising U.S. trade deficit in Israel 
almost $6 billion in 2003, especially at a time when the EU has a very 
surplus with Israel.  Israel should take steps to remove the obstacles 
exports, such as inadequate protection of intellectual property -- espe 
protection of proprietary pharmaceutical data -- non-transparent govern 
procurement procedures, and the use of technical standards as a non-tar 
to trade. 
 
3. (SBU)  Olmert responded that the Ambassador has pushed these issues 
hard with the Government of Israel.  It is nonetheless difficult, he sa 
trade patterns easily, because Israel is an open private economy and pu 
buy products from wherever they like.  He said, however, that he is ope 
about how to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and asserted that there has 
on trade issues. All of the obstacles to signing a new bilateral agricu 
agreement have been removed and, according to Olmert, the agreement sho 
finalized soon. 
 
4. (SBU)   Turning to IPR, he noted that Israel has formed an intermini 
committee, comprised of MOIT, Health and Justice, to look closely at th 
protection issue.  The committee will make recommendations by the end o 
month and the USG should expect \"good news.\"  Olmert did not provide sp 
but said the GOI will \"move in the direction of your expectations.\"  \"S 
frankly,\" Olmert said, \"I don\'t think your complaints are right.\"  Neve 
GOI has decided to reconsider its previous positions on the matter, in 
make it easier for U.S. firms to operate in Israel. 
 
5. (SBU)  Turning to procurement and standards issues, Olmert said he w 
arrange a meeting with the Ambassador to review specific ideas the U.S. 
have.  Olmert said that the GOI desires a less \"lopsided\" and more coll 
trade relationship.  (A meeting between Olmert and the Ambassador has b 
up for mid- March.) 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  Olmert noted that Israel has a few trade issues of concern a 
include the difficulty that Israeli firms have had getting access to U. 
homeland security-related procurement.  U/S Juster said he would look i 
made the point that openness and transparency in the procurement proces 
sides would be beneficial.  Olmert also noted that the U.S. has negotia 
the process of negotiating, a number of new free trade agreements.  Isr 
interested, he said, in tying into those agreements through favorable t 
under rules of origin.  He asked U/S Juster to convey these views to US 
Zoellick.  Finally, Olmert raised the problem that the Israeli firm Che 
been having in gaining USG approval for the purchase of a U.S. company. 
said that the deal has been signed off on by all USG agencies, except t 
Department of Homeland Security.  U/S Juster replied that the purchase 
considered by the USG and that an interagency group would make the deci 
He promised to convey Olmert\'s views to Washington. Olmert said that he 
to call Secretary Ridge about the issue. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
The Arab Boycott and the WTO 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Olmert noted that several countries in the region, most notab 
Arabia, had expressed interest in joining the WTO.  He stressed that it 
important that each candidate for WTO membership commit, in writing, no 
support any boycott against Israel, as a prerequisite for joining the o 
U/S Juster, noting that he is responsible for Arab boycott issues at th 
of Commerce, said the USG agreed that endorsement of a boycott was inco 
with WTO membership. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Olmert Says the Jawwal Problem Will Be Solved 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
8. (SBU):  U/S Juster noted that the USG remains concerned that equipme 
for the Palestinian telecommunications company Jawwal continues to be h 
Israeli ports.  Olmert said that he is well aware of the issue, and has 
Jawwal Chairman Zahi Khouri about the problem at length. Olmert promise 
the goods would be released soon. (Note: key components Jawwal needs to 
upgrade its infrastructure have been held up for months despite GOI ass 
the embassy that the parts would be released.) 
 
 --------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Breakthrough on Gas Pipeline Standards Issue? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
9. (SBU)  At a working luncheon hosted March 2 by the Ministry of Natio 
Infrastructure, U/S Juster noted the fact that MNI\'s decision to build 
natural gas transmission pipeline under a little-known Dutch standard h 
disadvantaged U.S. firms in bids for up to $500 million in contracts. 
prime example, he said, of how technical standards act as a serious non 
barrier.  MNI Director General Eli Ronen and other MNI officials initia 
that it was far too late to change the standard now.  Later during the 
however, Ronen said that it \"might be possible\" to get the selection of 
reexamined.  Ronen\'s assistant later told Emboffs that many officials i 
come to the conclusion that using the Dutch standard was a mistake and 
USG would petition PM Sharon on the issue.  He noted, however, that the 
remained many vested interests supporting the Dutch standard. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Israeli MOD on the Israeli Export Control Regime 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
10. (SBU) On March 3, Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials, led by Direc 
General Amos Yaron, gave U/S Juster a detailed, two-hour presentation a 
MOD role in defense export controls.  Ehud Ben-Aharon, head of the MOD 
defense export control office, reviewed the legislative basis for MoD\'s 
regulate the export of defense articles and described its current scope 
and overall GOI defense export control policy.  He provided a step-by-s 
of the process for issuing to would-be exporters the two key authorizin 
documents: a negotiation permit, which must ultimately be signed by the 
General, and the export license, signed by the Director of SIBAT, the M 
Foreign Defense Assistance and Defense Export Division.  Ben-Aharon dre 
special attention to the requirement for exporters of U.S.-origin compo 
present their U.S. re-export licenses.  Deputy Director Meir Shalit of 
followed with a presentation on GOI controls on the export of cryptogra 
technology.  While MOIT generally issues export licenses for dual-use t 
MOD has authority over the export of dual-use cryptographic technology. 
noted that the GOI controls the export of about 1,800 cryptographic pro 
issues more than 100 export licenses a year in the sector. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
AmCham Members Share Views 
--------------------------------------- 
 
11. (SBU)  At a breakfast meeting on March 4 with AmCham officials and 
representatives from Intel, Lockheed Martin, Samedan, IBM, and National 
Semiconductor, U/S Juster repeated USG concerns about the trade deficit 
technical standards, and certain GOI tendering practices.  The represen 
shared their views about doing business in Israel, which were quite pos 
general, and noted that U.S. firms already operating in the country ten 
affected as much by the problems with tenders and standards as those fi 
seeking to enter the market. The Lockheed representative pointed to $50 
million of business in Israel over 10 years, almost all through joint v 
Israeli companies and resulting in exports to other countries.  One com 
representative raised the issue of linking USG financial assistance to 
progress on Israeli trade practices of concern.  The IBM rep proudly no 
firm\'s presence in Israel for 54 years.  (Note: IBM\'s first research fa 
located outside North America was in Israel.)  The National Semiconduct 
representative asked the U/S to tell \"the home office\" it is safe to co 
Miron-Wapner of the USDOC-supported United States - Israel Science and 
Technology Commission pointed to the strength of life-science industrie 
and asked how such firms could help promote the USG\'s message.  The Sen 
Commercial Officer explained the objectives of the AmCham\'s Forum of U. 
Companies in Israel, which the Embassy actively supports, and its ad-ho 
committees on IPR, Standards and Regulations, Public Procurement, and 
Taxation/Work Permits.  AmCham President Zalman Shoval concluded the 
meeting by suggesting that the Chamber might organize \"reverse trade mi 
the United States in order to highlight large upcoming infrastructure p 
Israel.

PM Bureau Chief:  Putting our Money where our Hearts Are 
--------------------------------------------- -------------------------- 
12. (SBU)  In a March 4 meeting with Chief of the Prime Minister\'s Bure 
Weissglas, the U/S again conveyed USG concerns about Israeli trade prac 
discourage U.S. companies from competing for business in Israel.  In re 
Weissglas stated that a \"ministerial committee has been formed to exami 
the board the source of why U.S. firms don\'t get a fair deal\" and promi 
the intention of the government to \"react with our wallets the same way 
our hearts\" toward the United States. On IPR, Weisglass explained the b 
Israeli patent law in the British tradition, but finally indicated that 
intellectual curiosity, [he] would see if there is some way to amend th

Juster Conveys Concerns to MFA Officials 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
13. (SBU)  U/S Juster also broached bilateral trade issues in his March 
with Yossi Gal, MFA Deputy Director General for Economic Affairs, and Y 
Ben-Ze\'ev, MFA Deputy Director General for North America.  The existenc 
sizable U.S. trade deficit with Israel at the same time as the EU enjoy 
surplus was an anomaly, Juster said.  Israel should address U.S. trade 
said, since it is not in either country\'s interest that this is an issu 
relations.  The USG is not asking that Israel favor one country over an 
the USG and U.S. companies are only expecting a level playing field. 
 
 
14. (SBU)  Juster recounted his visits to U.S. hi-tech companies active 
cited hi-tech as a successful example of U.S./Israeli cooperation.  Add 
opportunities exist in the biotech and life science fields, he said, ad 
pharmaceutical firms are interested in increasing their engagement in I 
However, the country\'s lack of protection for proprietary test data rem 
problem in the bilateral trade relationship, he said, and he told Gal a 
that the GOI must now finally address the problem. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Economic Consequences of Security Measures 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
15. (SBU) Responding to a question by Gal, Juster confirmed that he had 
PA officials and Palestinian business people.  He said he delivered a s 
message to PA Minister Maher al-Masri that the PA must finally address 
issues.  Al-Masri replied that he understood that the PA must act.  Jus 
Al-Masri also addressed the economic difficulties created by Israeli se

firm Jawwal.  Jawwal appears to be a good corporate business model, but 
security measures had caused Jawwal economic problems, he said. He told 
GOI officials that they should consider the economic side effects of an

16. (SBU)  Ben-Ze\'ev addressed the Greater Middle East Initiative.  In 
eyes, the breadth of the initiative makes it a task for the entire comi

progress on implementation of the initiative to progress in solving the 
Israeli/Palestinian conflict.  The conflict has nothing to do with \"ill 
Yemen,\" Ben-Ze\'ev said.  Juster said that the USG is now gathering comm 
the initiative, and is aware of such concerns.  However, action is need 
status quo is unacceptable.  There should be progress on all aspects of

SUBJECT: THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND: MARCH 16, 2004; (1630 
HOURS LOCAL) - RUMORS IN GAZA OF INTERNATIONAL EVACUATION; 
CHILD IN WEST BANK UNWITTINGLY TRANSPORTS BOMB 
 
 
THIS IS A JOINT MESSAGE FROM CONGEN JERUSALEM AND EMBASSY TEL 
AVIV 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary.  Israeli press reports suggesting that a 
\"severe\" military crackdown on Gaza was likely following last 
week\'s suicide bombing at Ashdod port and a rumor that 
internationals were being ordered to leave Gaza, fueled 
widespread concern that internationals were preparing to 
evacuate the Gaza Strip.  An unspecified number of German 
diplomats reportedly left, but most of the German mission 
remained, according to UNRWA.  Posts have received no reports 
of evacuations by other diplomatic missions.  In the West 
Bank, a child who regularly earns money carting bags from one 
side of a checkpoint to the other for travelers was 
reportedly caught transporting a bomb through a checkpoint 
near Nablus.  According to press reports, the child did not 
know he was carrying a bomb.  The bomb was safely defused. 
End Summary.

through the Huwara checkpoint, near Nablus, on March 15. 
According to Israeli media, the child, who earns money 
carting bags from one side of the checkpoint to the other for 
travelers, did not know the contents of the bag.  The boy was 
released after being questioned by the IDF for a few hours. 
 
3.  (SBU) ARRESTS/PRISONER ISSUES:

SUBJECT: FOG REMAINS FOLLOWING SHARON WIN ON VAGUE 
DISENGAGEMENT PLAN SPEECH 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norm Olsen for reason 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
1.  (C) Summary and comment:  Following a vaguely-worded 
speech that was supposed to be about his disengagement plan, 
PM Sharon turned a March 15 Knesset vote on that speech into 
a so-called \"vote of confidence\" on his government -- which 
he won 46-45, with 29 members absent.  The vote, however 
close, meant little since only the opposition can call for a 
\"no-confidence\" vote aimed at toppling a government, and even 
then, a no-confidence vote requires 61 votes to pass. 
Sharon\'s tactics nonetheless resulted in the right-wing 
coalition partners absenting themselves from the confidence 
vote rather than voting against Sharon\'s speech, and 
demonstrating these parties\' desire to stay in the coalition. 
 Media pundits and politicos agreed that while the speech 
revealed nothing new about Sharon\'s strategy for 
disengagement, the vote demonstrated the dissension within 
the coalition.  In any event, PM Sharon\'s tactics 
successfully steered the Knesset away from a vote on 
disengagement, leaving observers still in the fog about the 
plan itself and whether the plan could win a Knesset 
majority.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Sharon Follows Adept Parliamentary Tactics... 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2.  (C) At the initiative of the left-wing Meretz party, 
which collected the required signatures of 40 MKs, PM Sharon 
was required under Knesset rules to appear before the body 
March 15 to discuss his disengagement plan.  Sharon 
reportedly wisely followed the advice of coalition whip 
Gideon Sa\'ar (Likud), and, at the last minute, turned a vote 
on his speech into a vote of confidence on the government, 
which he won, 46-45.  (Note: Votes of \"confidence,\" even if 
lost, have no ramifications for the government other than 
possible embarrassment and loss of credibility.  An 
opposition-called \"no-confidence\" motion, which must also 
nominate an alternative candidate for prime minister, can 
topple a government if approved by a Knesset majority of 61 
votes.)  Sa\'ar rightly banked on the two right-wing coalition 
parties -- the National Religious Party (NRP) and the 
National Union -- not wanting to vote against their own 
government.  According to Shinui Party advisor Yoram Levy, 
Sa\'ar had met with the NRP before the plenary to reach some 
sort of compromise.  In any event, the NRP and National Union 
MKs absented themselves rather than vote against the 
government.  According to the published voting record, 10 
Likud members also were absent from the vote. 
 
3.  (C) Sharon reportedly also followed Sa\'ar\'s advice to 
avoid providing any details about his disengagement plan and 
to exclude any reference to such controversial catch-phrases 
as \"painful concessions,\" and even the word \"disengagement.\" 
The speech was little more than Sharon\'s appeal, in what he 
said is the absence of a Palestinian partner, for Israel to 
act proactively, thereby preventing a political vacuum from 
being filled by any one of \"dozens\" of more damaging plans -- 
such as the Saudi proposal.  Sharon noted that National 
Security Council chief Giora Eiland is currently formulating 
the plan, and promised that when the government approves a 
detailed disengagement plan, he will submit it to the Knesset 
for a vote. 
 
4.  (C) Opposition MKs complained that they were still in the 
dark about Sharon\'s plan.  Shas MK Amnon Cohen griped to 
poloff on March 16 that Sharon\'s speech did not reveal any 
information on which West Bank settlements Sharon proposes to 
dismantle, and that no solution was proposed for who would 
\"supervise\" the Gaza Strip after an Israeli withdrawal.  He 
underlined that Shas cannot take a position until it knows 
more about the plan.  Labor leader Shimon Peres accused 
Sharon of not even having a plan. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Coalitions Can Teeter for a Long Time 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Media pundits and some MKs say the close vote of 
confidence demonstrates just how shaky the coalition is. 
Shinui advisor Levy speculated that \"Sharon is losing control 
of the coalition.\"  He also pointed to the absence of 10 
Likud MKs as indicative of Sharon\'s problems within Likud. 
Meretz MK Roman Bronfman asserted to poloff on March 16 that 
it was just a matter of time before the NRP and National 
Union leave the coalition and that Sharon was actively 
coordinating with Peres to form a unity government.  Bronfman 
emphasized that, in fact, it was Peres who did all of 
Sharon\'s work at the Knesset plenary by \"speaking against\" 
the right-wing parties after they criticized Sharon.  He said 
that Peres \"harshly\" accused these parties of providing no 
alternatives to Sharon\'s plan.  He speculated that Sharon 
would use the March 25-May 2 Knesset recess to work with 
Peres to form a coalition and to gain Likud support for a 
unity government.  Shas MK Cohen questioned whether Sharon 
could muster the necessary Likud votes to support a coalition 
with Labor.  Shinui MK Ronny Brizon, however, commented to 
poloff on March 16 that \"many coalitions and governments in 
Israel have teetered on the brink for a very long time.\"  He 
stressed that these votes were only an indication of 
problems, not a sign of an impending collapse of the 
coalition. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
If It\'s Monday, It Must be No-Confidence Day 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  While the media often depicts the now weekly 
Monday no-confidence votes on Sharon\'s government as close 
calls for Sharon, none of these votes have come close to 
bringing down the government.  Following are various types of 
Knesset votes and their ramifications for the GOI: 
 
-- Vote on PM\'s policy speech: The Knesset can vote to 
approve or disapprove policy speeches.  If Sharon had allowed 
a straight Knesset vote on his disengagement speech, despite 
the fact that it contained no details of his plan or even 
referred to dismantling settlements, it was likely that the 
NRP and National Union -- as well as some Likud members -- 
would have voted against the speech.  This might have been 
embarrassing for Sharon on the broader issue of 
disengagement, but it would not have had any concrete 
ramifications for the government. 
 
-- Vote of confidence in the government: A vote of 
confidence, which is a government-initiated action, has 
symbolic significance for the government.  If Sharon had lost 
this vote it would have been embarrassing, but, again, would 
not result in the fall of the government. 
 
-- No-confidence votes: A motion of no-confidence, which may 
only be called by the opposition, can bring down the 
government if approved by a majority of all Knesset members, 
or 61 votes, and if the party calling for the vote also 
submits a nomination for a replacement, with a signed letter 
from that nominee that he or she agrees to form a government. 
 All of the no-confidence votes taken to date on the Sharon 
government -- called on a weekly basis in the last couple of 
months -- have been close tallies yea and nay, but nowhere 
near the 61 votes needed, and there has been no indication 
that the parties calling the votes have had any replacements 
in mind.

SUBJECT: SHARON TELLS CODEL LEVIN NO NEGOTIATIONS WITH PA 
UNTIL AFTER GAZA WITHDRAWAL 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: While reaffirming his preference for the 
roadmap, PM Sharon told Codel Levin on March 14 that he would 
not \"negotiate\" with the PA prior to Gaza withdrawal, which 
he termed a security, not political, solution.  Asked what 
sort of U.S. support he is seeking, the PM said only that he 
wanted assurances that the GOI would be under no pressure as 
long as the PA failed to perform on dismantling terrorist 
infrastructure.  Asked whether he would allow Arafat to 
travel to Gaza after disengagement to help bolster the PA 
security forces, Sharon said, \"Arafat will stay where he is.\" 
 (In response to the same question, NSA Eiland said, 
\"Maybe.\")  Sharon pointed to the political obstacles he faces 
in implementing disengagement, both from the Gaza settlers 
and from within Likud, where \"I\'ve lost the majority in the 
party I formed.\"  Reinforcing Sharon\'s point about lack of 
unity within Likud, FM Shalom told the Codel that he was 
personally reserving judgment on Gaza withdrawal until 
details are clearer.  Shalom said Sharon would not bring the 
plan to the Cabinet until \"the U.S. contribution is clear.\" 
He said the GOI was not necessarily seeking U.S. financial 
support, but that \"statements\" would not be sufficient. 
Sharon, Shalom, Eiland and DMI Chief Farkash all assessed 
that Hamas will not seek to take over Gaza following Israeli 
withdrawal, although Farkash warned that motivation for 
terrorist attacks in the West Bank will increase following 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) In a March 14 meeting interrupted by news of the 
double suicide bombing in Ashdod, Codel Levin asked PM Sharon 
about his plan for disengagement from Gaza.  The Codel 
discussed the same topic earlier in the day in separate 
meetings with FM Shalom, National Security Adviser Eiland and 
IDF Intelligence Chief MG Farkash.  (Codel members were 
Senators Carl Levin, Jay Rockefeller, Jeff Bingaman, Jack 
Reed and Frank Lautenberg.  The Ambassador and emboffs joined 
all the meetings.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Sharon: Negotiations With PA Only After Gaza Withdrawal 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3. (C) Sharon told the Codel that the roadmap remains his 
preferred route for dealing with the Palestinians. 
Unilateral disengagment, he asserted, does not preclude a 
roadmap approach because it is a security, not political, 
\"solution.\"  Political negotiations with the PA, however, 
would only be possible after Israel withdraws from Gaza, not 
before. 
 
4. (C) Members of the Codel, who had heard FM Shalom say 
earlier in the day that Sharon would take his withdrawal plan 
to the Cabinet only after U.S. support for the plan was 
clear, asked Sharon about the sort of commitments he was 
seeking from the U.S.  Sharon said only that he was looking 
for assurances that no further pressure would be placed on 
the GOI as long as the PA is not fulfilling its roadmap 
obligation to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. 
 
5. (C) Sharon noted the political difficulties he faces in 
carrying out the disengagment plan.  The GOI, he said, has 
never moved settlements without gaining peace at the same 
time.  Some families have lived for three generations in 
Gaza, where they have modern farms, as well as painful 
memories of terrorist attacks.  These settlers are reminding 
the PM that statements he made as a candidate about \"painful 
compromises\" all spoke about making the compromises in 
exchange for a genuine, durable peace. 
 
6. (C) The PM pointed as well to his lack of support for the 
plan within his own Likud party.  Recounting his role in 
establishing the party during the three months in 1973 
between his retirement from the IDF and his return to uniform 
for the Yom Kippur war, he commented with a smile, \"I\'ve lost 
the majority in the party I formed.\"  Support for the plan on 
the Left does not offset this loss because the Left is so 
weak. 
 
7. (C) Responding to questions about Gaza after Israel 
withdraws, Sharon said he did not expect Hamas to take over. 
He expressed concern, though, about the Tanzim, which, he 
said, is responsible for most of the recent terrorism and 
which, he said, receives its orders and support from Iran and 
Hizballah.  Asked whether he thought Hamas wanted Israel to 
leave Gaza, Sharon said he did, but assessed that Hamas is 
worried that Israel will hit it harder after Israeli 
withdrawal because the GOI will no longer have to take into 
account the security of Gaza settlers. 
 
8. (C) Senator Levin asked Sharon whether he would allow 
Arafat to travel to Gaza after disengagement.  Sharon 
responded firmly that \"Arafat will stay where he is,\" to 
which Dov Weissglas, the PM\'s COS, added, \"for his own 
safety.\" 
9. (C) Weissglas commented that he did not foresee Gaza 
withdrawal having any impact on threats to Israeli security 
from Gaza.  The Gaza fence \"works,\" he said, and the IDF will 
remain deployed \"around\" Gaza.  The withdrawal will have no 
impact on terrorist motivation because motivation is \"already 
at the highest level.\"  Elements in Gaza will continue to 
play the role of the \"brains\" in terrorist attacks, the 
\"commands\" for which emanate in Syria and the execution of 
which is carried out by residents of the West Bank. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Shalom: Reserving Judgment on Disengagement 
------------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Like Sharon, FM Shalom opened his discussion of 
Palestinian issues with the Codel by affirming his support 
for the roadmap.  Asked for his personal view of Sharon\'s 
Gaza disengagement initiative, Shalom said he would reserve 
judgment until its details are clearer.  He noted that Sharon 
has said that the GOI would go ahead with Gaza disengagement 
only with U.S. support.  He also asserted that Sharon would 
not bring the plan to the full Cabinet until \"the U.S. 
contribution is clear.\"  Pressed by the Codel on the kind of 
\"contribution\" sought, Shalom said he did not necessarily 
mean financial support (although he did not exclude it).  He 
added, however, that U.S. \"statements\" would probably not be 
enough. 
 
12. (C) Sen. Rockefeller commented that Congressional 
interest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is waning, given 
the imperatives of dealing with al-Qaeda and Iraq.  He 
offered his own view of the \"inherent intractability\" of the 
Israeli-Palestinian problem, noting that some people believe 
that no solution is possible as long as Arafat and Sharon are 
calling the shots.  Shalom rejected the implicit comparison 
between Arafat and Sharon, asserting that Arafat, unlike 
Sharon, is a terrorist.  Unilateral disengagement, he 
continued, represents a totally new approach that is designed 
to circumvent the problem of Israel\'s lack of a Palestinian 
partner. 
 
13. (C) Sen. Reed noted that Israeli security needs following 
Gaza withdrawal would seem to require a strong PA, an outcome 
about which the GOI \"seems to be of two minds.\"  Shalom said 
he agreed with Reed on the need for a strong PA, but thought 
the PA was not ready or willing to take charge of Gaza 
security.  Egypt, he said, would first have to provide about 
six months of training to the Gaza security forces.  Shalom 
suggested that the IDF should remain in the Philadelphia 
Strip along the Gaza-Egypt border after disengagement, in 
order to avoid both having to reopen the peace treaty with 
Egypt and facilitating smuggling into Gaza. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Eiland: PA Security Forces Lacking Only Political Will 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
14. (C) Eiland differed with Shalom on the capabilities of 
the PA security forces.  While they could certainly benefit 
from training, he commented, they are already strong enough 
to exercise security control in Gaza.  All that is needed is 
political will, mainly from Arafat.  Asked whether the GOI 
would allow Arafat to travel to Gaza after Israeli 
disengagement, Eiland said, \"Maybe.\"  He noted as well that 
all GOI assessments concur that Hamas is not interested in 
taking over Gaza in the short term.  The political goal of 
Hamas is to be strong enough to derail any initiatives that 
do not suit its purposes. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Farkash: Gaza Withdrawal Means More West Bank Terror 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
15. (C) Hamas leaders in Gaza and Syria are \"negotiating,\" 
Gen. Farkash told the Codel, about how Hamas should react to 
the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.  In order to retain its 
legitimacy on the Gaza street after Israel withdraws, Hamas, 
he predicted, will look to increase its attacks in the West 
Bank.  Hamas will believe that terrorism can force Israel out 
of the West Bank, just as terrorism will be seen to have 
succeeded in Gaza.  Terrorist efforts will therefore focus on 
the West Bank.  Summarizing the IDF assessment, Farkash said 
Gaza disengagement will lead to greater terrorist motivation 
in the West Bank. 
 
16. (U) The Codel did not have an opportunity to review this 
cable before departing Israel.

AS IDF ACTS AGAINST TUNNELS AND WIDENS BORDER 
 
REF: A. TEL AVIV 513 
 
     B. TEL AVIV 6070 
 
Classified By: DCM Richard LeBaron, reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary/Comment: Humanitarian conditions in Rafah 
rank among the worst in the Palestinian territories.  In the 
past three years, over 10,000 persons in Rafah have been made 
homeless by IDF home demolitions.  The donor community has 
spent millions of dollars responding to this ongoing 
humanitarian emergency and many donors believe the 
humanitarian toll caused by these demolitions is 
disproportionate to the security gains achieved by Israel. 
For example, during the major October demolitions, the IDF 
discovered three arms smuggling tunnels, but close to 1,500 
persons were made homeless.  The IDF maintains it has 
considered technical/engineering solutions to the tunneling 
problem but there are no viable alternatives to home 
demolitions at this time. 
 
2.  (C) Comment: As the Israelis consider withdrawal from 
Gaza, issues in Rafah are among the most difficult to manage. 
 At the top of their security worries is smuggling of more 
effective weapons.  Rafah is often the scene of pitched 
battles between Palestinian militants and the IDF, with a 
tank incursion going on as we write.  In this environment, we 
see no evidence that the IDF is thinking about the longer 
term consequences of home demolitions for the Palestinians, 
for international donors, and much less for creating a more 
stable environment in Gaza that could improve Israel\'s 
security.  The Israeli focus now is on \"teaching the 
terrorists a lesson,\" to disabuse Palestinian militant groups 
of the notion that their actions forced Israel to leave Gaza. 
 The policy, especially if the violence in Gaza escalates, 
will have consequences for stability and recovery in Gaza 
after the Israeli pull-out.  (End Summary/Comment) 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Over 10,000 Made Homeless; Donors Pay Millions 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (U)  Since October 2000, over 10,000 people have been 
made homeless in Rafah, according to UNRWA.  The breakdown is 
as follows: Number of homes demolished - 1,075; Number of 
families affected - 1,968; Number of persons affected - 
10,092.  Roughly two thirds of all those currently homeless 
in Gaza are from Rafah.  The rate of home demolitions in 
Rafah has increased dramatically over the past three years. 
In 2001, an average of 12 homes were destroyed per month.  In 
2002, the average was 35 per month; and in 2003, the average 
increased to 70 per month. 
 
4.  (U)  The international relief community has responded to 
the needs of the homeless by providing emergency aid in the 
form of cash and in-kind assistance such as blankets and 
tents.  From October 2003 to February 2004, UNRWA provided 
roughly USD 564,000 in cash to 1,347 families to assist them 
in finding temporary housing.  Due to the deteriorating 
humanitarian conditions, the World Food Program (WFP) is now 
providing food to 5,469 families in Rafah, compared with 
3,472 in August 2003. 
 
5.  (U)  The above measures -- tents, food, blankets -- are 
temporary, stop gap measures designed to address immediate 
needs.  Permanently re-housing those who have been made 
homeless is costing millions and is complicated primarily by 
a lack of funding, but also by a shortage of land.  To date, 
UNRWA has invested USD 17.2 million in its re-housing 
program, and the agency says it needs an additional USD 26 
million to re-house all affected refugee families.

Relief Agencies Report: Rafah at Breaking Point; 
Cannot Absorb More Demolitions 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6.  (C)  At the March 9 Humanitarian and Economic Policy 
Group (HEPG) meeting, OCHA Country Representative David 
Shearer reported that the relief community and its 
Palestinian partners are adept in coping with the first 72 
hours after wide-scale demolitions.  However, the assistance 
community had thus far been unable to adequately address the 
principal need -- permanent re-housing.  Shearer underscored 
that in OCHA\'s view the humanitarian costs in Rafah have been 
disproportionate to the security gains made by Israel.  He 
noted that the IDF had only discovered three tunnels in its 
October 2003 operations that demolished well over 100 homes. 
Stuart Shepherd, the OCHA Gaza representative, said that the 
local coping mechanisms -- moving in with relatives, relying 
on temporary shelters provided by the municipality -- have 
been exhausted.  Rafah he said, can not absorb another round 
of demolitions. 
 
7.  (C)  WFP Country Director Jean-Luc Siblot reported that 
the entire Rafah Area is highly food insecure and distributed 
a map indicating that most of Rafah fell within their highest 
statistical band of food insecurity-- \"40 percent or more of 
the population.\"  Siblot said, \"Rafah should be treated as an 
\'emergency\'.  There is no area in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territories more in need of more focused attention.\"  Siblot 
noted that on his March 8 visit to Rafah, WFP provided food 
to a family of 12 -- all living in a one-room garage. 
\"Living situations like this cannot continue,\" he concluded. 
 
8.  (C)  Sam Rose of UNWRA reported that it is experiencing 
difficulties in finding suitable land for re-housing and in 
securing the financing necessary for construction, with the 
latter being far bigger obstacle.  Rose speculated that 
donors have been reluctant to respond because of the 
perception by some that the GOI is systematically 
\"transferring\" the Rafah population.  An official from the 
European Commission\'s Humanitarian Office (ECHO) said that 
the perception of \"transfer\" may be an issue for some donors. 
 In addition, however, some donors were concerned by the cost 
of the \"high-quality\" houses that UNWRA is providing.  Rose 
replied that UNWRA is cognizant of this concern and has 
reduced its costs from USD 22,000/ new unit to \"about half 
that.\"  Rose\'s comments prompted a round of dark humor 
lauding the advantages of \"economies of scale.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
IDF Says No Technical Solution To Stopping Tunneling 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
9.  (C)  The IDF Southern Command does not believe there is a 
technical solution to the tunnel problem in Rafah.  The depth 
of the tunneling, combined with the make-up of the soil in 
the area, defeat most seismic/engineering solutions.  The IDF 
G-2 for Southern Command has made an exhaustive study of the 
geology in the region and maintains a \"counter-tunneling\" 
working group solution.  In this group\'s view, home 
demolitions are the only viable solution at this time.  The 
IDF believes that unabated tunneling would drastically 
increase Palestinian weapons smuggling capabilities, perhaps 
to include surface-to-surface rockets and surface-to-air 
missiles, although it is worth noting that there have been no 
large caches of weapons or cases of more sophisticated 
weapons discovered so far in IDF anti-tunnel operations.  In 
addition, the IDF demolished a significant number of homes to 
widen the security buffer between Egypt and Gaza in order to 
increase its ability to operate in the area and to make 
tunnelling more difficult.  The IDF is still considering 
about how to grapple with new ways of addressing these 
security threats in a post-withdrawal environment, with much 
greater emphasis on the role of Egypt, and a continuing 
debate about whether and how the IDF could continue to 
control the Philadelphia Strip. 
 
--------------------- 
Next Steps for Donors 
--------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  OCHA is preparing a needs assessment focused on 
Rafah which will be presented at the next HEPG meeting in 
April.  While the assessment will focus on a range of issues 
including, water, sanitation, and food, we expect that the 
overwhelming need will be funding for re-housing.

Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media bannered Israel\'s current and expected 
response to Hamas-led terrorism.  The media reported 
that PM Sharon has ordered the assassination of Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad leaders.  Yediot quoted senior 
security sources as saying that they are \"in the 
crosshairs.\"  Leading media reported that last night 
the IDF started operations throughout the Gaza Strip. 
Israel Radio quoted Palestinian sources as saying that 
two Palestinians were killed, including a member of the 
Popular Resistance Committees, and that seven others 
were wounded, one of them critically.  Leading media 
reported that two Palestinians were killed Tuesday in 
an IAF helicopter attack in Gaza City, and that IDF 
operations in the Strip are continuing today.  Ha\'aretz 
reported that top Fatah activists are leaving the 
movement to join Hamas. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that security officials are 
considering preempting any legal entanglements by 
speeding up the construction of the separation fence. 
Israel Radio reported that today the High Court of 
Justice will debate four separate petitions related to 
the erection of the fence. 
 
Ha\'aretz assesses that Syria is likely to be hit hard 
by a restriction in U.S. investments.  Jerusalem Post 
quoted sources in Washington as saying Tuesday that the 
Bush administration is expected to prohibit American 
energy companies from future investments in Syria, but 
allow some already existing projects to continue, as 
part of fresh U.S. sanctions to be unveiled in the 
coming days.  Ha\'aretz reported on an individual 
initiative: following his visit to Israel in November 
2002, New York City Comptroller William Thompson, 
received the consent of the shareholders in the pension 
fund of the NYC policemen and firemen to approach large 
American companies in which the pension fund invests, 
to stop their activities in Syria and Iran.  Ha\'aretz 
also featured the Syrian media\'s efforts \"to deny the 
reality of a nearby country\" (Israel). 
 
Israel Radio cited Al Jazeera-TV that today Osama El- 
Baz, senior adviser to Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak, is due to meet with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat 
and that El-Baz is carrying a special message from 
Mubarak. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post quoted Jordanian officials 
as saying that Jordan is considering suing Israel over 
the money seized from Ramallah banks in February. 
Jordan claims that the funds belong to Jordanians. 
Yediot reported that the Foreign Ministry is embarking 
on an international campaign against the deadly abuse 
of Palestinian children by the Palestinian terrorist 
groups.  Maariv and Hatzofe reported that Abdullah 
Quran, the 10 to 12-year old boy (depending on the 
media) arrested Monday with explosives at a checkpoint 
near Nablus, received five shekels (about 1 USD) for 
the errand he was sent on.  Maariv quoted Minister in 
the Prime Minister\'s Office Gideon Ezra (Likud) as 
saying that Israeli Arabs should be recruited in 
protection efforts against suicide bombers, whom they 
will recognize more efficiently than the average 
Israeli Jew. 
 
Yediot reported that Tuesday A/G Menachem Mazuz 
confirmed to Meretz Knesset Member Zahava Gal-On a 
Ha\'aretz story that the Shin Bet maintains a 
\"blacklist\" of left-wing activists because of the 
concern that they could become, albeit unwillingly, 
accessories to the activities of terror organizations. 
Leading media also quoted Mazuz as saying that the 
disengagement plan could cause a rift among Israelis. 
 
Most media reported that last night, with a 54 to 46- 
percent margin, Yossi Beilin won the contest for the 
leadership of Yahad, the successor party to Meretz, 
over Knesset Member Ran Cohen, who is more identified 
with social issues. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Iran and Egypt will operate 
separate reconnaissance satellites in one to two years. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported on events held across the U.S. to 
mark the first anniversary of the death of American 
peace activist Rachel Corrie, who was crushed to death 
by an Israeli military bulldozer as she attempted to 
prevent the destruction of a Palestinian house in 
Rafah.  Rachel\'s father Craig Corrie was quoted as 
saying in an interview with Ha\'aretz: \"I believe that 
the Israeli government has had every chance over the 
past year to do what Prime Minister Sharon promised 
President Bush in their conversation on March 17, 
2003.\"  Ha\'aretz notes that according to the State 
Department, the gist of that conversation was that the 
GOI would carry out a comprehensive, full, and 
transparent investigation and report back to the U.S. 
on its findings. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that local residents are planning a 
dual language, Jewish-Arab school in the Wadi Ara area 
(between Hadera and Afula). 
 
Jerusalem Post cited an AP story that the U.S. Justice 
Department has hardened its position on a Holocaust 
lawsuit claiming the U.S. Army plundered riches seized 
by Nazis from 800,000 Hungarian Jews and covered it up 
for decades.

President Bush\'s road map principles.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Going to Gaza\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the lead editorial of mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (March 17): \"The 
most recent wave of terror attacks by Hamas was 
launched to prove that Israel is withdrawing from Gaza 
because of Ashdod, that Al Qaida\'s \'Madrid method\' 
(terror prompts withdrawal) has met with success here 
as well.  Israel, in response, has decided to purge 
Gaza of Hamas and to deal Hamas a deathblow.... 
There can be no disputing the need to pay Hamas back 
what it duly deserves. However, the root of all evil 
does not lie with this terror organization.  Hamas is 
capable of launching such a large scope of terror 
attacks against Israel only because it is backed by 
Palestinian militias that are loyal to Arafat.  Arafat 
perceives Hamas to be his long-range strategic arm.  He 
wants to be cast as the liberator of Gaza.  As such, as 
long as Arafat is around, it is doubtful that the 
Israeli withdrawal will take place.  And it is also 
doubtful whether the blow being dealt to Hamas -- 
lethal as it may be -- will achieve its desired goals. 
We cannot-- either morally or politically -- drown Gaza 
either in the sea or in blood.  But Arafat can be 
expelled.\" 
 
II.  \"The British Are Here, With Arafat\'s Approval\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(March 17): \"With grudging consent from the Americans, 
the British are now setting up two new operation 
control rooms, one in Ramallah and one in Gaza, for 
Palestinian security organizations.... What is the 
reason for the British involvement?  Aside from a 
desire to wield influence in the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, the British are afraid that implementation of 
the disengagement plan could lead to Palestinian loss 
of control in the territories to be evacuated, and to 
ensuing chaos.  Essentially, the new installations are 
part of a comprehensive British-Palestinian security 
plan.... The American go-ahead for British involvement 
was granted reluctantly and on a limited basis, and 
only after Blair\'s personal appeal to President 
Bush.... The reasons for the Americans\' and the 
Israelis\' unwillingness to cooperate with the 
Palestinians on this issue are basically identical: 
Arafat\'s direct involvement in implementing the plan, 
and his condition that nothing happen without his say- 
so.... If and when the disengagement begins, we will 
begin to see increasingly more involvement of foreign 
countries in the area.... Because the withdrawal is 
unilateral and not in the framework of an agreement, it 
is doubtful that Israel could prevent the Palestinians 
from steps such as inviting international 
representatives, unless the step could be considered as 
an act of war.\" 
 
III.  \"Child Sacrifice\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 17): \"Israel was shaken Monday.  It wasn\'t 
because of a terrorist atrocity actually perpetrated, 
but because of one thankfully preempted.  Front pages 
were dominated by the story of 11-year-old Abdullah 
Quran, who carried a powerful bomb in his schoolbag.... 
This is not \'just\' child abuse, but child sacrifice. 
It is as if Palestinian terrorists are trying to reach 
new depths of war crimes, matched only by previous uses 
of ambulances and pregnant women to carry out terrorist 
attacks.... Incredibly, Abdullah\'s misadventure went 
largely unreported by the world\'s media, further 
underscoring the double standard against Israel.... The 
Palestinian manipulation of children is as pervasive 
and transparent as Hitler\'s \'Children\'s Army\' at the 
end of World War II.  It\'s a flagrant violation of 
Article 38 of the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, which censures \'the recruitment and 
involvement of children under 15 in hostilities and 
armed conflicts.\'  Yet it\'s an entrenched Arab practice 
in this country.... Palestinian youngsters are 
incessantly subjected to brainwashing in the media and 
classroom.  Hate is inculcated in them.  Even 
preschoolers are taught to aspire to martyr status. 
They grow in a culture that, rather than consecrating 
life, glorifies violent \'sacrificial\' death.\" 
 
IV.  \"Disengagement as Strategic Need\" 
 
Former director-general of the Prime Minister\'s Office 
and the Foreign Ministry Avraham Tamir wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (March 17): \"History will 
chronicle the unilateral disengagement, in accordance 
with the principles of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, as 
a necessary transition period in the peace process, in 
accordance with President Bush\'s road map 
principles.... Sharon\'s disengagement plan will earn 
broad national support in Israel; the duration of a 
national unity government, even if extremist factions 
leave it because of the connection with the goals of 
the road map; U.S. support and assistance for 
relocating a civilian and military infrastructure; the 
support of Egypt and Jordan to the only way of 
preparing the ground for the implementation of the road 
map; and the support of the European Union, the Russian 
Federation, the Secretary-General of the UN and key 
Arab and Muslim countries.  The scope of that support 
will have repercussions on change in the Palestinian 
government toward a determination to dismantle the 
terrorist infrastructure, to stop hostile operations 
and to sever connections with international terrorist 
organizations such as Hizbullah and Al Qaida.... 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan ... would have implications 
for the advancement of a comprehensive Israeli-Arab 
peace, in which a diplomatic and security solution 
would be found to all the components of a conflict that 
has lasted since time immemorial.\"

TAGS: PREL, PTER, SY, IS, GOI EXTERNAL 
SUBJECT: SHARON TELLS CODEL LEVIN THAT SYRIA TRACK CAN WAIT 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 1638 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: PM Sharon told Codel Levin that Israel should 
\"finish negotiations\" with the Palestinians before turning to 
the Syrian track.  While expressing a willingness to 
negotiate without preconditions with Bashar, the PM said 
Syria would first have to dismantle terrorist organizations 
and bases.  NSA Eiland assessed that Bashar\'s offer to 
negotiate with Israel was not serious in any event, and 
commented that the Golan Heights was only the SARG\'s third or 
fourth priority after regime survival, control of Lebanon, 
and, maybe, preservation of strategic capabilities.  Eiland 
and DMI Chief Farkash pointed to what they called Hizballah\'s 
unremitting support for Palestinian terrorism, with Eiland 
charging that Hizballah turned to \"private people\" to keep up 
attacks during last summer\'s \"hudna.\"  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Members of Codel Levin raised Syrian President Assad\'s 
offer to open negotiations with Israel in separate March 14 
meetings with PM Sharon, FM Shalom, NSA Eiland, and IDF 
Intelligence Chief Gen. Farkash.  (Codel members were 
Senators Carl Levin, Jay Rockefeller, Jeff Bingaman, Jack 
Reed and Frank Lautenberg.  Ambassador and emboffs 
accompanied them to all meetings.  Codel discussions about 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza were reported reftel.) 
 
----------------------- 
First, the Palestinians 
----------------------- 
 
3. (C) After expressing his hope that U.S. pressure on Syria 
will not diminish, Sharon said he was willing to negotiate 
with the SARG.  First, though, the SARG would have to 
dismantle terrorist organizations and bases and expel 
\"several hundred\" members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard 
Corps (IRGC) from Lebanon.  He pointed to the threat 
Hizballah represents on Israel\'s northern border and charged 
that the IRGC and Hizballah are responsible for terrorist 
operations in Israel conducted by the Tanzim.  He noted that 
Israel still has outstanding humanitarian cases to resolve 
with Syria, i.e., Ron Arad and the MIAs from Sultan Yaqub. 
 
4. (C) Sharon stressed that the GOI would not accept SARG 
preconditions for the negotiations, including Bashar\'s 
suggestion that negotiations begin where they left off 
previously.  FM Shalom also rejected SARG preconditions, but 
stated that he was \"encouraged\" by Bashar\'s offer and wished 
to begin negotiations immediately.  Senator Levin asked 
Sharon whether the GOI has any preconditions.  The PM replied 
that a return to the previous negotiations would be 
unacceptable.  In any event, he added, the GOI would not give 
first priority to the Syria track: \"Let\'s first finish 
negotiations with the Palestinians.\" 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Hizballah Supporting Palestinian Terrorism 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) National Security Adviser Giora Eiland hinted at the 
one-track-at-a-time approach, commenting that \"some\" in the 
GOI believe that Israel cannot simultaneously negotiate with 
the Palestinians and Syrians.  He assessed that President 
Assad\'s offer was not serious, in any case.  Assad made the 
offer just to deflect U.S. pressure, he said.  He also judged 
that the return of the Golan Heights is only the third or 
fourth priority for Assad, after regime survival, control of 
Lebanon (\"much more important than the Golan\"), and, 
possibly, retention of WMD and other strategic capabilities. 
 
6. (C) Gen. Farkash posited that support for terrorism is 
essential for Syria, as \"Syria without terror is an 
unimportant country.\"  Eiland asserted that Syrian-backed 
Hizballah keeps pressing for terrorism against Israel to 
continue, even when Hamas does not agree.  He claimed that 
Hizballah sent funds to the territories last summer so that 
\"private people\"  could carry out attacks during the Hamas 
cease-fire.  He said these people had been trained either 
directly by Hizballah, by trainers sent to the territories, 
or by Internet (e.g., for the production of explosives). 
 
7. (C) Gen. Farkash claimed that Hizballah is now providing 
the funding and/or weapons for 95% of the attacks carried out 
by Fatah-related groups.  He charged that Iran is stepping up 
its support for terrorism via Syria, pointing to the 
allegation that Iran used Bam earthquake relief flights 
returning to Syria to ship arms. 
 
8. (U) The Codel did not have an opportunity to clear this 
message.

Haroubi family home in Gaza City\'s Nasser neighborhood. 
According to Ha\'aretz, two Islamic Jihad operatives, Husseini 
Sarafiti and Nasser Yassin, were killed and nine people were 
injured.  The target of the strike, according to Ha\'aretz, 
was Mohammed Haroubi, a senior Islamic Jihad filed operative 
allegedly involved in the attempted terror attack on the Erez 
Crossing March 6. 
 
8.  (SBU) BORDER CROSSINGS/CHECKPOINTS 
 
-- Route Four (Salahadeen Road), the main north-south traffic 
artery, was open for Palestinians during the reporting 
period. 
 
-- Erez Crossing was closed.  The Erez Industrial Zone was 
open, with 3661 workers entering the Zone on March 17. 
 
-- Sufa Crossing was open during the reporting period. 
 
-- Karni Terminal was open during the reporting period for 
the import and export of goods into the Gaza Strip. 
 
-- Rafah Terminal was open for Palestinian travelers during 
the reporting period. 
 
-- Tel al-Sultan checkpoint and Toufah checkpoint were closed 
during the reporting period, according to UNRWA. 
 
9.  (SBU) POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS: 
 
According to press reports citing Israeli security officials, 
during a March 16 political-security cabinet meeting, Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon ordered the IDF and Shin Bet to \"act 
without limitations\" against top figures from all terror 
organizations.  A senior security official told Israeli 
mass-market daily Yedioth Ahronoth, \"Contrary to what 
happened in the IDF\'s hasty departure from Lebanon, when 
Hizbullah chalked up a victory, we have no intention of 
leaving the Gaza strip with out tail between our legs . . . 
Israel intends to withdraw from the entire Gaza Strip, but 
not before it teaches the terror organizations a lesson that 
won\'t be forgotten quickly.\"

10.  (SBU) According to Israeli Media, security forces at 
Ashdod Port closed down a section of the port on the morning 
of March 17, after hand grenades and other weapons were found 
in a bag hidden in the false bottom of a container.  The 
container was believed to have passed through the Karni 
Crossing in the Gaza Strip, according to Ha\'aretz.

SUBJECT: NEW YAHAD CHAIRMAN BEILIN SOUNDS BATTLE CRY 
AGAINST LIKUD, BUT IS LABOR LISTENING? 
 
REF: 03 TEL AVIV 6800 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norm Olsen for reason 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: Yossi Beilin\'s close victory in the new 
Yahad Party\'s chairmanship race against Meretz MK Ran Cohen 
blows some new life into the foundering political career of 
the Geneva Accords architect, but has barely ruffled the 
political waters.  Beilin termed his win a victory for 
\"peace, the Geneva Accord and social justice,\" and boldly 
called on Labor leader -- and Beilin mentor -- Shimon Peres 
to immediately \"establish an opposition management\" along 
with Yahad to \"shorten Sharon\'s days in office.\"  Beilin 
warned Labor not to join Sharon\'s government, saying it would 
be repeating an earlier mistake.  His comments have 
nonetheless not yet elicited any reaction from Peres or other 
Labor leaders, and neither the birth of Yahad nor the 
Beilin/Cohen race have elicited more than a wide yawn from 
the Israeli political and media establishments.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Beilin Born Again, (and Again, and Again) 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Receiving about 54 percent of the vote in what was 
a close race until the end, Yossi Beilin defeated Meretz MK 
Ran Cohen for the chairmanship of the new Yahad (\"together\") 
party in its March 16 primary.  Cohen Knesset colleagues 
Zahava Gal-On and Avshalom Vilan came out in support of 
Beilin at the last minute, which, aside from embarrassing 
Cohen, may have sealed Beilin\'s victory.  As one of the 
architects and untiring champions of the Geneva Accords, 
Beilin has a reputation for being the worldly \"statesman,\" 
while Cohen, with kibbutznik roots, is known for his 
overarching concern about social causes and improving the 
plight of Israel\'s poor.  Both candidates reportedly objected 
to how they were labeled.  Upon accepting his defeat, Cohen 
magnanimously announced that he would not establish a rival 
camp. 
 
3.  (SBU) The win signaled a political comeback of as yet 
undetermined strength for Beilin, who, after a long political 
career in Labor, including ministerial positions in Labor 
governments, left that party to join Meretz in December 2002 
after Labor placed him too low on its candidate list even to 
compete for a Knesset seat.  Beilin failed to obtain a 
position high enough on the Meretz Party list to receive a 
seat in the 16th Knesset, since Meretz lost four of its 
previous 10 seats.  On November 20, 2003, Meretz approved a 
merger with Shahar, a movement formed by Beilin in June 2002, 
to form Yahad (reftel).  Beilin is not currently a Knesset 
Member. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Beilin Calls on Peres to Form Opposition 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Using his chance in the media spotlight, Beilin 
turned his March 16 victory speech into a challenge to his 
long-time mentor and Labor leader Shimon Peres to form what 
he referred to as an \"opposition management\" in order to 
\"shorten Sharon\'s days in office.\"  Beilin termed the Sharon 
government \"the worst Israel has had,\" noting the continuing 
\"cycle of terror attacks.\"  (Note: Interestingly, the day 
after Beilin declared his election a victory for the Geneva 
Accords, full-page advertisements appeared in Israel\'s three 
major newspapers calling for readers to cast electronic votes 
in favor of the Geneva Accords on March 24, in the first of 
several \"interactive demonstrations.\"  Justice Minister Lapid 
announced March 17 that the State Comptroller would 
investigate the funding sources for Beilin\'s election 
campaign and for the Geneva initiative.)  Beilin warned Labor 
not to join a Sharon government, threatening that if it did, 
he would \"fight (Labor) more than we would fight the Likud.\" 
 
5.  (SBU) The media did not carry any official Labor 
reactions to Beilin\'s speech.  Less than 24 hours after 
Beilin\'s pronouncements, however, PM Sharon met with Labor 
faction chair MK Dalia Itzik, reportedly to provide more 
details about his disengagement plan.  In addition, Ha\'aretz 
reported that at a press conference convened by Labor on 
March 17, Peres \"declined to give a guarantee that Labor 
would under no circumstances join a Sharon-led government.\" 
In a display of the confusion surrounding Labor\'s intentions, 
the Ma\'ariv website, however, reported that Peres \"outright 
rejected\" the notion that it planned to form a unity 
government with Sharon. 
 
-------------------- 
Is Anyone Listening? 
-------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The media paid scant attention to, and pundits spent 
little energy speculating over, who would win the Yahad 
elections.  Meretz MK Roman Bronfman told poloff late 
afternoon of March 16 that he had no idea who would win, and 
had no interest in speculating about the results or its 
ramifications for Yahad.  Most editorials on Beilin\'s win and 
on Beilin the man dismissed him as too far to the left and 
too far removed from the average Israeli to be a serious 
player in Israeli politics. 
 
7. (C) Labor activist and organizer for the Western Galilee 
Nimrod Vizansky, a kibbutznik, commented to poloff on March 
17 that Beilin \"does not have much influence,\" and asserted 
that \"whatever Beilin says right after the elections is not 
very important.\"  While winning the Yahad chairmanship might 
have satisfied Beilin\'s political ambitions, Vizansky noted, 
Beilin is still \"a small fish in a small pond.\"

NEGOTIATORS DEFER CONTENTIOUS INPUT ISSUE TO THEIR MINISTERS 
 
REF: CAIRO 2024 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Ted Mann, Reasons 1.4(B) and (D) 
 
1. (U) This is a joint cable from Embassies Tel Aviv and 
Cairo. 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
2.  (C) The third round of Israeli/Egyptian QIZ talks ended 
without an agreement on March 17 in Jerusalem.  As in the 
previous discussions in Jerusalem and Cairo, the stumbling 
block remained the minimum Israeli content requirement for 
any goods produced in future Egyptian QIZs.  Each side made a 
single additional improvement over its final offer from the 
second round of talks on March 11 in Cairo (reftel), but it 
was not enough to bridge the gap.  They two sides agreed 
that, after three rounds of talks, they had achieved all they 
could on the content issue.  They agreed to defer the issue 
to their respective ministers, Israeli Vice Premier Ehud 
Olmert and Egyptian Minister of Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros 
Ghali.  No date was set for the ministers\' dialogue, which 
the negotiators agreed could take place either by phone or in 
a face-to-face meeting sometime between March 25 and April 3. 
 The two delegations also failed to reach agreement on 
whether the two governments should submit their QIZ proposal 
to the USG jointly or separately.  As in the previous 
meeting, the atmosphere was cordial, and the two delegations 
expressed satisfaction with the day\'s progress.  End summary. 
 
 
----------------- 
The Newest Offers 
----------------- 
 
3. (C) Egyptian negotiator Sayed Elbous said the GOE would 
now accept 10.5 percent minimum Israeli content for the first 
two years.  Thereafter the minimum content should drop to 8 
percent.  In the previous meeting, Elbous said Egypt would 
accept 9 percent for the first two years and 8 percent 
thereafter.  GOI negotiators Gabby Bar and Yair Shiran 
offered two options.  In the first, Israeli content would 
remain at 12.5 percent permanently.  In the second, Israeli 
content would be 13 percent for the first two years and 12 
percent thereafter.  During the previous week\'s talks in 
Cairo, the GOI had suggested starting at 14.5 percent with a 
reduction to 11.7 percent over the course of four years.  The 
Israeli content requirement remains the most contentious 
issue because Israeli inputs are considered more expensive 
than those available from other sources. 
 
-------------------------- 
The QIZ\'s Impact on Israel 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The issue of input percentages, and the brief exchange 
of offers, came near the end of a day dominated by a drawn 
out discussion over the negative impact that Egyptian QIZs 
would have on some parts of the Israeli textile industry.  As 
in the second round of talks in Cairo, the discussion, 
attended in full by EconOffs from Embassies Cairo and Tel 
Aviv, was cordial, although the GOE\'s Elbous expressed some 
impatience over the fact that the Israelis did not broach the 
content issue until late in the day.  Bar and Shiran 
explained at length that Israel recognized the political and 
economic benefits stemming from QIZ cooperation with Egypt. 
However, they also said that Egyptian QIZs would create 
competition for Israeli firms, and that \"thousands\" of jobs 
would probably be lost because large Israeli textile 
companies were looking to move production to Egypt if the two 
countries signed a QIZ agreement.  (Note: Our discussions 
with Israeli industry sources suggest that the losses would 
be more in the neighborhood of hundreds of jobs, but 
particularly painful as they would be in economically 
hard-hit developments towns like Kiryat Gat.  End note.) 
Elbous encouraged the GOI to recognize that traditional 
textile manufacturing had no future in a high-cost country 
like Israel, and that competition on the world\'s markets 
would force the industry\'s demise with or without Egyptian 
QIZs.  The GOI should see the opportunities for Israeli 
suppliers, and recognize the political benefits that 
increased business and governmental contacts between the two 
countries would bring to Israel. 
--------------------------------------- 
Negotiators Finally Broach Other Issues 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) After agreeing that they could not reach a consensus 
on the minimum Israeli input requirement, the two sides 
touched upon, for the first time since direct negotiations 
began in January, other issues related to the establishment 
of Israeli/Egyptian QIZs.  Another sticking point dating back 
to last year\'s informal discussions between the two 
governments -- the manner in which the two governments should 
formally submit their QIZ proposal to the USG -- was 
discussed but not solved.  Elbous suggested that each side 
send separate letters to the USG requesting recognition of 
certain industrial zones as QIZs.  The GOI\'s Bar insisted 
that the two trade ministers write a joint letter.  Bar 
received strong support from MFA Director for Middle East 
Economic Affairs Ilan Baruch, who was also present at the 
meeting.   Baruch said the issue was of critical importance 
for Israel, since it would demonstrate the two governments\' 
intention of closer relations.  Elbous agreed to discuss the 
Israeli proposal with his political leadership. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
GOI Suggests New Model for Calculating Input Requirement 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
6. (C) Bar also proposed a new model for calculating how 
future Egyptian QIZ factories met the minimum Israeli input 
requirement.  In Jordanian QIZ factories, Bar explained, each 
piece of produced apparel had to contain the minimum level of 
Israeli inputs.  This system was inflexible for the factories 
and created administrative headaches for the government 
officials administering the program, he told Elbous.  Bar 
said the GOI would be satisfied if QIZ companies or 
individual factories purchased the minimum level of Israeli 
inputs on a quarterly basis.  Missing the minimum requirement 
on individual production batches would be acceptable to the 
GOI if this were balanced out by other batches containing 
more than the minimum input percentage.  Elbous said the GOE 
would be open to such suggestions.  Both sides told EconOffs 
that they might ask USG Customs experts to participate in 
future meetings where technical issues are discussed.  Bar 
and Elbous agreed, however, that another face-to-face meeting 
made little sense until their respective political leaders 
had found a compromise on the Israeli content issue. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) After a long day of negotiations, all participants 
showed visible relief after both sides had made their sole 
offer on minimum Israeli content and decided to refer the 
contentious issue to their superiors.  Both the Israeli and 
Egyptian industry representatives who were on hand to act as 
informal consultants also seemed relieved and happy with this 
result.  They denied there was some pre-arranged Ministerial 
fix in the offing, but seemed to believe that once the 
Ministers got directly involved, larger political imperatives 
would prevail and yield a result acceptable to both sides. 
End comment.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan: 
-Leading media (Ha\'aretz, citing GOI sources) reported 
that Wednesday Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz and other 
senior security officials most likely convinced Sharon 
that his disengagement plan should include a complete 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, but, at most, a pullout 
from only a handful of settlements in the West Bank, 
which Maariv says Sharon is considering carrying out 
first.  Ha\'aretz quoted its sources as saying that the 
maximal alternative -- evacuating 17 West Bank 
settlements in addition to the Gaza pullout -- had 
basically been dropped, mainly because of the growing 
opposition in the Likud.  Yediot reported that Sharon 
responded to a suggestion by Mofaz that workers from 
Gaza continue working in Israel after the disengagement 
by saying: \"Let them work in Egypt or Jordan.\"  Yediot 
cited the belief of a senior defense source that the 
plan\'s authorization and negotiating process will 
continue until September 2005.  Other media reported 
that the plan is likely to be implemented in December 
2005.  Ha\'aretz reported that the Right is divided over 
the legitimacy of refusing orders to evacuate the 
settlements -- if and when the disengagement is passed. 
Yediot reported that the Justice Ministry will 
establish a special \"dialogue\" team with the Gaza Strip 
settlers and initiate a basic law that would tackle 
legislative issues that could result from the 
evacuation, such as harming settlers\' property rights. 
-Jerusalem Post quoted FM Silvan Shalom as saying 
Wednesday that PM Sharon will deal with renegade 
ministers lobbying against his disengagement policy in 
the next few days.  The newspaper noted that Shalom 
spoke one day after Construction and Housing Minister 
Effi Eitam (National Religious Party) spoke out in the 
U.S. against the plan and on the same day that 
Transportation Minister Avigdor Lieberman (National 
Union) met at his initiative with U.S. Ambassador 
Daniel Kurtzer (a meeting also reported by other 
media).  Lieberman reportedly told Kurtzer that the 
plan will not be approved by the cabinet, will endanger 
the government, and could possibly present problems for 
the U.S. Administration.  Lieberman told Israel Radio: 
\"A meeting with the U.S. ambassador, as with other 
ambassadors, is an exchange of information, opinions, 
and assessments.\"  Lieberman said he gave Kurtzer the 
same assessment of the plan that he has given Sharon 
and which he has presented to the Knesset.   \"I am glad 
that the U.S. Ambassador listens to all the 
assessments, and not only those from the Prime 
Minister\'s Office.  It is good that the Americans have 
a complete picture,\" he said.  Jerusalem Post noted 
that a U.S. Embassy official confirmed the meeting, 
saying it is normal practice for Kurtzer to 
periodically meet with different government ministers 
for an exchange of views. 
-Ha\'aretz quoted a Palestinian source as saying that 
Wednesday Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak\'s senior 
adviser Osama El-Baz delivered an \"ultimatum\" to PA 
Chairman Yasser Arafat, according to which the PA must 
regain control of the Gaza Strip, or else Egypt would 
withdraw from actively intervening in the implications 
of Israel\'s withdrawal plan from the Strip.  Jerusalem 
Post also cited Egyptian pressure on the PA. 
 
Israel Radio reported that last night the IDF pulled 
out from the confines of Rafah, where it unsuccessfully 
looked for smuggling tunnels.  Leading media reported 
that four Palestinians, two of them children (Ha\'aretz: 
armed teenagers), were killed.  The media reported on 
numerous violent incidents throughout the territories. 
Maariv led by citing the concern of security sources 
that terrorists could be planning to hijack buses.  All 
media reported that the suicide bombers who blew 
themselves at Ashdod Port Sunday had hidden in a 
modified container that had transported candies to the 
Gaza Strip and re-entered Israel through the Karni 
crossing.  Leading media quoted police officials as 
saying that five terrorist attacks were thwarted in 
Jerusalem over the past two weeks. 
 
Israel Radio reported that last night the D-G of the 
Prime Minister\'s Office met with Palestinian Finance 
Minister Salam Fayyad in order to discuss the USD 100- 
million monthly transfer of tax money Israel owes the 
PA. 
 
Israel Radio reported that, based on the Syria 
Accountability Act, the U.S. Administration will soon 
announce that it is imposing sanctions on Syria for its 
support for terror.  The station quoted Deputy 
Secretary of State Richard Armitage as saying on a U.S. 
 
SIPDIS 
radio station that these would be very forceful 
sanctions, and that Syria had helped little in the 
battle against al-Qaida but that at the same time, 
along with Iran, it had supported Hizbullah and Hamas. 
 
Leading media reported that one Palestinian was killed 
and 21 others were wounded in a gun battle that erupted 
in the center of Gaza City Wednesday morning between 
Hamas activists and PA policemen. 
 
Yediot reported that in four Palestinian cities the IDF 
has seized notebooks of Palestinian children decorated 
with \"dreadful pictures\" of terrorist attacks and 
suicide bombers.  Yediot and other media also reported 
that scrapbooks filled with photographs of \"shahids\" 
(martyrs) constitute the \"biggest hit\" among 
Palestinian children. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that Wednesday the 
High Court of Justice, which debated various West Bank 
fence-related petitions, ordered the state to respond 
to claims that the current route of the West Bank fence 
does not meet Israel\'s security needs and that it 
simply causes harm to Palestinian villagers.  The 
Council for Peace and Security, a peace advocacy group 
representing top-level Israeli reserve officers and 
intelligence officials, had presented the claims to the 
court. 
 
All media reported that last night in Baghdad at least 
29 people were killed and 50 injured when an 
approximately 1,000-pound bomb went off in front of the 
Mount Lebanon Hotel, not far from the headquarters of 
the U.S.-led coalition. The media cited the suspicions 
of coalition officials that an al-Qaida affiliated 
group may have been behind the bombing.  Maariv 
predicts that the committee investigating the role of 
Israeli intelligence during the Iraq War will once 
again blame the prevailing \"preconception\" among the 
intelligence bodies and warn that this was one of the 
gravest failures in the history of Israeli 
intelligence.  The newspaper cited a denial by Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Yuval Steinitz, 
who also chairs the investigative committee.  The 
committee is also checking into the fact that Israel 
only learned about Libya\'s nuclear plans from the U.S. 
 
Leading media reported that Wednesday Yossi Beilin, the 
newly elected leader of Yahad, the successor party to 
Meretz, called on the Labor Party not to crawl before 
Sharon.  Leading media reported that Wednesday Labor 
Party Chairman Shimon Peres reiterated statements that 
his party has no intention of joining the government 
coalition.  Leading media reported that Justice 
Minister Yosef (Tommy) Lapid called on the State 
Comptroller to investigate who funded Beilin\'s election 
campaign, and whether foreign funding he received for 
the promotion of the Geneva Accord was not siphoned off 
into his personal election campaign. 
 
Globes quoted Jacob Toren, the Chairman of RAFAEL, the 
Israel Armament Development Authority, that, due to a 
50 percent cut in orders from the IDF, the authority is 
expected to move a significant part of its production 
and development activities to the U.S. 
 
Globes and Ha\'aretz reported that an agreement for 
Israeli participation in the 16-billion euro Galileo 
European satellite navigation system project was signed 
Wednesday in Jerusalem.  Globes also noted that the 
European Parliament has approved Israel\'s participation 
in the Sixth Framework Program of the EU for R&D.

\"Posturing and threats do not enhance Israel\'s

\"How to Get Out of Gaza\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (March 
18): \"The Palestinians have a powerful interest in 
presenting a different version of the narrative of the 
withdrawal from Gaza.  Sharon wants to present it as 
the tale of an independent Israeli decision whose 
purpose is to improve Israel\'s military capabilities in 
years to come.  Hamas and its cohorts want to frame the 
withdrawal in a different context, presenting it as a 
triumph of Palestinian power that culminated in the 
removal of Jewish settlements and the expulsion of the 
IDF.  The terror attacks, which peaked early this week 
in the double suicide bombing at the Ashdod port, are 
intended to restore to the Palestinians both 
operational initiative in the field, and the ability to 
dictate the narrative to the world.... Since it is 
tremendously difficult for security forces to thwart 
terror attacks once suicide bombers and explosives have 
been smuggled into Israeli territory, Israel does not 
have the luxury of abandoning operations in the Gaza 
Strip altogether.  Under such circumstances, selective 
assassinations of those responsible for planning future 
terror strikes and for implementing them (as opposed to 
punishing those responsible for past attacks) are an 
unavoidable necessity.  The same is true of ground 
operations when there is no way of carrying out precise 
strikes against defined targets.... Operations proposed 
by military officials to the political leadership are 
less problematic than the verbal wrapping in which 
government spokesmen have packaged the plans for 
marketing to the public.  Posturing and threats do not 
enhance Israel\'s deterrent power.  They can actually 
backfire, leading to a general escalation and producing 
one of two bad results: enhancing the credibility of 
the Palestinian version of Israel\'s withdrawal under 
force, or the failure of the plan to withdraw from 
Gaza.\"

                       -------- 
 
Nationalist writer Uri Dan, a close associate of Prime 
Minister Sharon, opined in conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post: \"To a far greater degree than the 
terrible attacks by Muslim terrorists perpetrated in 
Jerusalem, Bali, Casablanca, and Istanbul, the massacre 
in Madrid was intended to tell the stunned Europeans 
that the barbarians are, once again, at the gates of 
Europe.\"

\"Victory For Muslim Terrorism in Madrid\" 
 
Nationalist writer Uri Dan, a close associate of Prime 
Minister Sharon, opined in conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post (March 18): \"\'President Bush is totally 
familiar with the grave problem of global terrorism, 
and the free world is fortunate that he is occupying 
the White House,\' Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told me 
last Friday at his farm in the northern Negev.  The 
Prime Minister voiced these remarks after hearing the 
reports from Madrid of the terrible massacre 
perpetrated there the previous day by Al Qaida.... It 
won\'t take long for the new Spanish government to learn 
the hard way that rapid surrender to Muslim terror will 
only encourage additional attacks in Spain by al- 
Qaida.... The defeat of Aznar\'s government last Sunday, 
72 hours after the massacre in Madrid, was without 
doubt a victory for Muslim terrorism aimed at 
undermining the Western democracies.... If France 
opposed the United States\' justified war in Iraq and 
refused to dispatch a single soldier there, why should 
it become a target for Muslim terror?  Because al- 
Qaida\'s global offensive against the West is 
unconnected to events in Iraq.... To a far greater 
degree than the terrible attacks by Muslim terrorists 
perpetrated in Jerusalem, Bali, Casablanca, and 
Istanbul, the massacre in Madrid was intended to tell 
the stunned Europeans that the barbarians are, once 
again, at the gates of Europe.\"

1. (SBU) SUMMARY. In a visit to Israel March 2-4, Under 
Secretary of Commerce Kenneth I. Juster, head of the 
 
SIPDIS 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), met with high- 
ranking Israeli officials, as well as with both Israeli 
and American leaders from the private and public 
sectors in Israel\'s hi-tech and defense industries. 
U/S Juster discussed U.S.-Israel cooperation in the 
area of high-technology trade, held meetings with BIS\'s 
Israeli counterparts in the MoD, and met with leading 
private and public sector players in Israel\'s 
sophisticated hi-tech and defense sectors.  Throughout 
the meetings with GOI officials, Juster raised U.S. 
government concerns about the worsening U.S. trade 
deficit with Israel.  The U/S urged Israeli government 
officials to reexamine specific policies and practices 
that restrict the ability of U.S. companies to compete 
in Israel and also adversely affect the interests of 
Israeli consumers.  In particular, Juster discussed 
certain Israeli procurement practices that fail to 
promote transparent and fair competition, the lack of 
protection of certain intellectual property rights, and 
the need for enacting technical standards and 
regulations that do not discourage U.S. companies from 
competing for business in Israel.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Meeting with Vice Prime Minister Olmert 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU)  Under Secretary Juster told Vice PM and 
Minister of Industry and Trade Olmert that he was 
\"alarmed\" by the rising U.S. trade deficit in Israel, 
which was almost $6 billion in 2003, especially at a 
time when the EU has a very large trade surplus with 
Israel.  Israel should take steps to remove the 
obstacles to U.S. exports, such as inadequate 
protection of intellectual property -- especially 
protection of proprietary pharmaceutical data -- non- 
transparent government procurement procedures, and the 
use of technical standards as a non-tariff barrier to 
trade. 
 
3. (SBU)  Olmert responded that the Ambassador has 
pushed these issues very hard with the Government of 
Israel.  It is nonetheless difficult, he said, to 
change trade patterns easily, because Israel is an open 
private economy and purchasers can buy products from 
wherever they like.  He said, however, that he is open 
to ideas about how to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and 
asserted that there has been progress on trade issues. 
All of the obstacles to signing a new bilateral 
agricultural agreement have been removed and, according 
to Olmert, the agreement should be finalized soon. 
 
4. (SBU)   Turning to IPR, he noted that Israel has 
formed an interministerial committee, comprised of 
MOIT, Health and Justice, to look closely at the data 
protection issue.  The committee will make 
recommendations by the end of the month and the USG 
should expect \"good news.\"  Olmert did not provide 
specifics, but said the GOI will \"move in the direction 
of your expectations.\"  \"Speaking frankly,\" Olmert 
said, \"I don\'t think your complaints are right.\" 
Nevertheless, the GOI has decided to reconsider its 
previous positions on the matter, in order to make it 
easier for U.S. firms to operate in Israel. 
 
5. (SBU)  Turning to procurement and standards issues, 
Olmert said he wants to arrange a meeting with the 
Ambassador to review specific ideas the U.S. may have. 
Olmert said that the GOI desires a less \"lopsided\" and 
more collaborative trade relationship.  (A meeting 
between Olmert and the Ambassador has been set up for 
mid- March.) 
 
6.  (SBU)  Olmert noted that Israel has a few trade 
issues of concern as well. These include the difficulty 
that Israeli firms have had getting access to U.S. 
government homeland security-related procurement.  U/S 
Juster said he would look into it and made the point 
that openness and transparency in the procurement 
process on both sides would be beneficial.  Olmert also 
noted that the U.S. has negotiated, or is in the 
process of negotiating, a number of new free trade 
agreements.  Israel is interested, he said, in tying 
into those agreements through favorable treatment under 
rules of origin.  He asked U/S Juster to convey these 
views to USTR Zoellick.  Finally, Olmert raised the 
problem that the Israeli firm Checkpoint has been 
having in gaining USG approval for the purchase of a 
U.S. company.  Olmert said that the deal has been 
signed off on by all USG agencies, except the 
Department of Homeland Security.  U/S Juster replied 
that the purchase was being considered by the USG and 
that an interagency group would make the decision.  He 
promised to convey Olmert\'s views to Washington. Olmert 
said that he planned to call Secretary Ridge about the 
issue. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
The Arab Boycott and the WTO 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Olmert noted that several countries in the 
region, most notably Saudi Arabia, had expressed 
interest in joining the WTO.  He stressed that it was 
important that each candidate for WTO membership 
commit, in writing, not to support any boycott against 
Israel, as a prerequisite for joining the organization. 
U/S Juster, noting that he is responsible for Arab 
boycott issues at the Department of Commerce, said the 
USG agreed that endorsement of a boycott was 
inconsistent with WTO membership. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Olmert Says the Jawwal Problem Will Be Solved 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU):  U/S Juster noted that the USG remains 
concerned that equipment bound for the Palestinian 
telecommunications company Jawwal continues to be held 
up at Israeli ports.  Olmert said that he is well aware 
of the issue, and has talked to Jawwal Chairman Zahi 
Khouri about the problem at length. Olmert promised 
that the goods would be released soon. (Note: key 
components Jawwal needs to upgrade its infrastructure 
have been held up for months despite GOI assurances to 
the embassy that the parts would be released.) 
 
 ---------------------------------------- 
Breakthrough on Gas Pipeline Standards Issue? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU)  At a working luncheon hosted March 2 by the 
Ministry of National Infrastructure, U/S Juster noted 
the fact that MNI\'s decision to build Israel\'s new 
natural gas transmission pipeline under a little-known 
Dutch standard had disadvantaged U.S. firms in bids for 
up to $500 million in contracts.  This was a prime 
example, he said, of how technical standards act as a 
serious non-tariff barrier.  MNI Director General Eli 
Ronen and other MNI officials initially stated that it 
was far too late to change the standard now.  Later 
during the lunch, however, Ronen said that it \"might be 
possible\" to get the selection of the standard 
reexamined.  Ronen\'s assistant later told Emboffs that 
many officials in MNI had come to the conclusion that 
using the Dutch standard was a mistake and hoped the 
USG would petition PM Sharon on the issue.  He noted, 
however, that there remained many vested interests 
supporting the Dutch standard. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Israeli MOD on the Israeli Export Control Regime 
--------------------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) On March 3, Ministry of Defense (MOD) 
officials, led by Director General Amos Yaron, gave U/S 
Juster a detailed, two-hour presentation about the MOD 
role in defense export controls.  Ehud Ben-Aharon, head 
of the MOD defense export control office, reviewed the 
legislative basis for MoD\'s authority to regulate the 
export of defense articles and described its current 
scope of control and overall GOI defense export control 
policy.  He provided a step-by-step account of the 
process for issuing to would-be exporters the two key 
authorizing documents: a negotiation permit, which must 
ultimately be signed by the Director General, and the 
export license, signed by the Director of SIBAT, the 
MOD Foreign Defense Assistance and Defense Export 
Division.  Ben-Aharon drew special attention to the 
requirement for exporters of U.S.-origin components to 
present their U.S. re-export licenses.  Deputy Director 
Meir Shalit of SIBAT followed with a presentation on 
GOI controls on the export of cryptographic technology. 
While MOIT generally issues export licenses for dual- 
use technology, MOD has authority over the export of 
dual-use cryptographic technology.  Shalit noted that 
the GOI controls the export of about 1,800 
cryptographic products and issues more than 100 export 
licenses a year in the sector. 
--------------------------------------- 
AmCham Members Share Views 
--------------------------------------- 
 
11. (SBU)  At a breakfast meeting on March 4 with 
AmCham officials and representatives from Intel, 
Lockheed Martin, Samedan, IBM, and National 
Semiconductor, U/S Juster repeated USG concerns about 
the trade deficit, technical standards, and certain GOI 
tendering practices.  The representatives shared their 
views about doing business in Israel, which were quite 
positive in general, and noted that U.S. firms already 
operating in the country tend not to be affected as 
much by the problems with tenders and standards as 
those firms seeking to enter the market. The Lockheed 
representative pointed to $500-600 million of business 
in Israel over 10 years, almost all through joint 
ventures with Israeli companies and resulting in 
exports to other countries.  One company representative 
raised the issue of linking USG financial assistance to 
Israel to progress on Israeli trade practices of 
concern.  The IBM rep proudly noted his firm\'s presence 
in Israel for 54 years.  (Note: IBM\'s first research 
facility to be located outside North America was in 
Israel.)  The National Semiconductor representative 
asked the U/S to tell \"the home office\" it is safe to 
come to Israel.  Miron-Wapner of the USDOC-supported 
United States - Israel Science and Technology 
Commission pointed to the strength of life-science 
industries in Israel and asked how such firms could 
help promote the USG\'s message.  The Senior Commercial 
Officer explained the objectives of the AmCham\'s Forum 
of U.S. Companies in Israel, which the Embassy actively 
supports, and its ad-hoc committees on IPR, Standards 
and Regulations, Public Procurement, and Taxation/Work 
Permits.  AmCham President Zalman Shoval concluded the 
meeting by suggesting that the Chamber might organize 
\"reverse trade missions\" to the United States in order 
to highlight large upcoming infrastructure projects in 
Israel. 
 
 ----------------------------------- 
PM Bureau Chief:  Putting our Money where our Hearts 
Are 
------------------------------------- 
 
12. (SBU)  In a March 4 meeting with Chief of the Prime 
Minister\'s Bureau Dov Weissglas, the U/S again conveyed 
USG concerns about Israeli trade practices that 
discourage U.S. companies from competing for business 
in Israel.  In response, Weissglas stated that a 
\"ministerial committee has been formed to examine 
across the board the source of why U.S. firms don\'t get 
a fair deal\" and promised that it is the intention of 
the government to \"react with our wallets the same way 
we do with our hearts\" toward the United States. On 
IPR, Weisglass explained the basis of Israeli patent 
law in the British tradition, but finally indicated 
that \"out of intellectual curiosity, [he] would see if 
there is some way to amend the law.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Juster Conveys Concerns to MFA Officials 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
13. (SBU)  U/S Juster also broached bilateral trade 
issues in his March 4 meeting with Yossi Gal, MFA 
Deputy Director General for Economic Affairs, and Yoram 
Ben-Ze\'ev, MFA Deputy Director General for North 
America.  The existence of a sizable U.S. trade deficit 
with Israel at the same time as the EU enjoyed a large 
surplus was an anomaly, Juster said.  Israel should 
address U.S. trade concerns, he said, since it is not 
in either country\'s interest that this is an issue in 
our bilateral relations.  The USG is not asking that 
Israel favor one country over another; rather, the USG 
and U.S. companies are only expecting a level playing 
field. 
14. (SBU)  Juster recounted his visits to U.S. hi-tech 
companies active in Israel and cited hi-tech as a 
successful example of U.S./Israeli cooperation. 
Additional opportunities exist in the biotech and life 
science fields, he said, adding that U.S. 
pharmaceutical firms are interested in increasing their 
engagement in Israel. However, the country\'s lack of 
protection for proprietary test data remains a serious 
problem in the bilateral trade relationship, he said, 
and he told Gal and Ben-Ze\'ev that the GOI must now 
finally address the problem. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Economic Consequences of Security Measures 
----------------------------------------- 
 
15. (SBU) Responding to a question by Gal, Juster 
confirmed that he had met with PA officials and 
Palestinian business people.  He said he delivered a 
strong message to PA Minister Maher al-Masri that the 
PA must finally address security issues.  Al-Masri 
replied that he understood that the PA must act. 
Juster added that Al-Masri also addressed the economic 
difficulties created by Israeli security measures. 
Juster also recounted his visit to the Palestinian 
telecommunications firm Jawwal.  Jawwal appears to be a 
good corporate business model, but IDF security 
measures had caused Jawwal economic problems, he said. 
He told the GOI officials that they should consider the 
economic side effects of any security measures. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Greater Middle East Initiative 
----------------------------------- 
 
16. (SBU)  Ben-Ze\'ev addressed the Greater Middle East 
Initiative.  In the GOI\'s eyes, the breadth of the 
initiative makes it a task for the entire coming 
generation, he told Juster.  Israel is concerned 
whether the USG will have the staying power to stay 
focused on implementing the initiative, particularly if 
there should be a change in the U.S. administration. 
In order for the initiative to gain acceptance in the 
broader Arab world, Ben-Ze\'ev said, the USG should 
ensure that it does not appear to be imposed from the 
outside.  In addition, Ben-Zeev cautioned against 
linking progress on implementation of the initiative to 
progress in solving the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. 
The conflict has nothing to do with \"illiteracy in 
Yemen,\" Ben-Ze\'ev said.  Juster said that the USG is 
now gathering comments on the initiative, and is aware 
of such concerns.  However, action is needed, since the 
status quo is unacceptable.  There should be progress 
on all aspects of the initiative simultaneously, he 
told his GOI interlocutors.

message, coordinated with the British Embassy and British 
ConGen. 
 
2. (S) SUMMARY:  Following a detailed review of the situation 
at the Jericho prison, the U.S. and British Ambassadors and 
Consuls General agreed March 15 that Palestinian 
non-compliance with the prison regime is unsatisfactory. 
Based on the monitors\' own assessment, and in the absence of 
information about specific threats against monitors or 
sustained Israeli pressure, meeting participants assessed 
that the current level of risk was low, but required careful 
monitoring.  The Jericho Monitoring Mission (JMM), in 
consultation with U.S. and UK DATTs and the U.S. ConGen 
Jerusalem RSO, will draw up enhanced contingency plans for 
monitors\' emergency extraction.  Meanwhile, HMG will develop 
a longer-term exit strategy, and U.S. and British 
counterparts will conduct regular (biannual) reviews of JMM. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
---------- 
JMM Sitrep 
---------- 
 
3.  (C) Ambassador Kurtzer on March 15 hosted a meeting with 
Jerusalem Consul General Pearce and the British Ambassador 
and CG to discuss the Jerusalem Monitoring Mission (JMM). 
JMM Chief Monitor LeMesurier and Embassy and ConGen poloffs 
also attended.  LeMesurier outlined the situation following 
the U.S./UK demarche to Abu Ala\'a of February 5, noting that 
the JMM had improved seclusion by installing a metal detector 
portal (purchased by HMG).  In addition, the Palestinians had 
made progress on the easy measures laid out in the demarche, 
notably on recording visitors and limiting visiting hours (to 
16 hours a day).  They had not implemented any of the more 
difficult measures, however, such as cell searches or removal 
of computers or Shobaki\'s four aides.  Consequently, the JMM 
had been unable to verify seclusion of the unconvicted 
prisoners (Sa\'adat, Shobaki and (later) Gholmi) since 
November 2002 and of the convicted PFLP prisoners since 
October 2003.  The monitors\' day-to-day security situation 
inside the prison was stable and acceptable. 
 
------------------- 
What To Do About It 
------------------- 
 
4.  (S) There was consensus that Palestinian non-compliance 
with the Ramallah Agreement, and JMM\'s consequent inability 
to confirm seclusion of the six prisoners, caused serious 
concern about JMM\'s future.  The British representatives 
noted that the JMM monitors are the most vulnerable FCO staff 
(and virtually the only U.S. staff) in the West Bank, 
traveling the same route on a daily basis.  They also 
remarked on the high cost of maintaining the mission (Note: 
JMM costs the FCO approximately BPS 700,000 per year.  End 
Note.)  Israeli criticism of JMM (particularly PM COS Dov 
Weissglas\'s 9 December 2003 letter to the U.S. and UK 
Ambassadors) has reflected Israeli doubts that JMM was a 
successful example of international intervention.  The 
British CG also noted that continued tolerance of Palestinian 
non-compliance could undermine British credibility when 
trying to secure cooperation on other issues, including the 
UK\'s Palestinian security plan. 
 
5.  (S) Despite PA non-compliance with all aspects of the 
Ramallah agreement, participants agreed that JMM was 
sustainable for the immediate future.  The GOI had not 
repeated the concerns expressed in the January 9 Weissglas 
letter.  This suggested that the Israelis might accept the 
status quo, provided we continued to press for improvements 
in seclusion.  While monitor safety remained the top 
priority, there were no known specific threats.  As long as 
the JMM remained in Jericho, the vulnerability of the 
monitors would be a continuing concern.  It was agreed that 
extracting the monitors would have to be coordinated with 
capitals, but that this could be accomplished in relatively 
short order if necessary.  However, the method of extraction 
required careful advance thought, because it could also pose 
some risks monitor safety.  Moreover, the Israelis would 
probably respond to extraction by attempting to capture or 
kill the prisoners.  This would strain the U.S./UK 
relationships with the Palestinian Authority, increase 
Israeli/Palestinian tensions, and potentially generate PFLP 
threats against U.S. or UK targets, including diplomatic 
staff. 
 
6.  (C) It was agreed that prospects for agreement between 
the two parties remained poor for the time being.  The 
Israeli position has if anything hardened since the JMM 
started.  The GOI would be reluctant to accept anything other 
than an Israeli trial or a Palestinian trial in which they 
could have confidence.  Meanwhile, the Palestinians see 
little benefit from JMM, given Arafat\'s continued seclusion 
in the Muqata\'a.  In preparatory discussions for the 
Sharon/Abu Ala\'a meeting, the Palestinians indicated that 
they would seek, among other things, the release of Sa\'adat 
and Shobaki to Ramallah and Gaza respectively, a move that 
would be unacceptable to Israel.  Indeed, as Weissglas told 
Ambassador Kurtzer, the GOI had been unhappy that the PA had 
proposed moving JMM from the \"points to be raised\" agenda of 
the Sharon/Abu Ala\'a meeting to the \"points to be agreed\" 
section, a proposal Weissglas had taken to mean the 
Palestinians wanted to delay the summit -- even before the 
Ashdod bombing, which provided the pretext for the GOI to do 
so. 
 
--------- 
Follow-Up 
--------- 
 
7.  (S) Participants agreed on the following follow-up 
actions: 
 
-- UK Embassy will produce a draft exit strategy for 
discussion (including options such as exile or technical 
surveillance); 
 
-- JMM, in consultation with U.S. and UK DATTs and the ConGen 
Jerusalem RSO, will produce emergency extraction strategies, 
covering different scenarios and in different environments, 
and considering the need for coordination with the GOI and PA; 
 
-- At an appropriate time after the anticipated meeting 
between the Israeli and Palestinian PMs, the U.S. and UK 
Consuls General will discuss with the PA a prioritized list 
of outstanding measures required to improve seclusion, 
including phased implementation of some measures; 
 
-- The U.S. and UK Embassies will inform the GOI of progress 
to date in enhancing seclusion; 
 
-- The U.S. and UK will immediately review the situation with 
a view to extraction should there be threats to monitors\' 
safety. 
 
-- U.S. and UK will encourage the two parties to pursue 
agreement, and take a constructive and realistic approach to 
JMM.  We would review progress made on JMM at a Sharon/Abu 
Ala\'a meeting; 
 
-- U.S. and UK Embassies and CGs would provide capitals a 
progress report in May. 
 
8.  (C) Subsequent to the U.S. - UK meeting, PA Minister of 
Interior Hakam Bal\'awi told DPO that he had sent a two-person 
delegation to Jericho on March 15 to investigate the problems 
at the prison which the U.S. Consul General had raised with 
him in their last meeting.  Bal\'awi had instructed the 
delegation to go over the specific areas of non-compliance 
point by point with the prison officials.  Some progress had 
been made, Bal\'awi reported, without precisely describing it, 
but more remained to be done.  Comment:  Bal\'awi appears to 
understand the stakes in ensuring compliance but may be

SUBJECT: TRANSPORT MINISTER LIEBERMAN SLAMS SHARON IN 
MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (b,c) 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  Transportation Minister and National Union 
leader Avigdor Lieberman on March 17: 
-- Called PM Sharon and his unilateral disengagement plan \"a 
failure,\" which was not supported by the majority of Israelis 
and which appeared to give in to terror; 
-- Said the National Union would bolt the coalition should 
the Cabinet sign off on the plan; 
-- Claimed that forward movement towards peace with the 
Palestinians was not possible with Arafat in power; 
-- Said that the GOI\'s role in Negev development should be 
limited to current plans to construct a rail line from Tel 
Aviv to Dimona; 
-- Called the Israeli-Arabs the \"key issue for Israel\" and 
asked for U.S. ideas on how to work with them; 
-- Noted the GOI planned to upgrade transportation security 
in the wake of the recent Ashdod attack; 
-- Said that he had rescheduled his visit to the U.S. for 
late April, when he hoped to continue building on good 
bilateral transportation cooperation with Secretary Mineta; 
and 
-- Urged more U.S. companies to bid on the USD 8 billion in 
contracts under his ministry\'s authority.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Unilateral Disengagement: Go Ahead, Make My Day 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2.  (C) Lieberman, who had asked to see the Ambassador, 
savaged the Prime Minister and his unilateral disengagement 
plan: \"Sharon has failed.  On the roadmap, on Abu Mazen, on 
Tannenbaum, and now on the new plan.\"  He said the plan came 
at the wrong time, both for Israel and for the U.S.  At the 
very least, Sharon should have waited for the U.S. elections 
to pass.  He claimed the PM faced intense opposition, within 
Likud, the Coalition, the Cabinet, and within Israeli society 
as a whole.  \"Sharon does not have a majority for the plan.\" 
As for his party, Lieberman stressed: \"if the Cabinet 
approves the plan, the National Union will leave the 
government.\" 
 
3.  (C) Lieberman said his opposition stemmed from his belief 
that the Palestinians would view a withdrawal from Gaza as a 
victory for terror.  \"They will see it as weakness, not as an 
effort to compromise.\"  Gaza settlement evacuation would also 
leave Israel exposed: \"What if they target Ashkelon\'s power 
generation plants from north Gaza with Qassam rockets?  That 
represents five percent of Israeli power generation.\" 
 
4.  (C) Lieberman asked for U.S. views of the plan.  The 
Ambassador noted the USG was engaging closely with the GOI, 
and referred to the recent visits to Israel of Deputy NSA 
Hadley and A/S Burns.  The Administration was interested in 
the Israeli ideas.  Until we saw \"the plan\" in detail, 
however, the USG would not be able to take a position on it. 
He noted the concept of settlement evacuation had points in 
common with the President\'s vision for the region.  Also, it 
could potentially increase security for Israel while testing 
Palestinian seriousness.  The Ambassador also cautioned 
Lieberman not to underestimate the divisions within 
Palestinian society: \"There are Palestinians who want a 
better life for themselves and want forward movement.\" 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Lieberman: Get Rid of Arafat; Reform 
Palestinian Society; Bring in Egypt/Jordan 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) Lieberman claimed that forward movement was not 
possible with Arafat in power.  \"We need a partner.  Until 
Arafat is out, it is impossible to negotiate.  Abu Mazen made 
that clear.\"  He said Arafat had no interest in a Palestinian 
state, but wanted to destroy \"our state.\"  He said that any 
solution involved Egypt and Jordan: \"The Jordanian dynasty 
would have a serious problem with an independent Palestinian 
state.\"  Aside from Arafat, necessary reform of Palestinian 
society would be complex and long-term.  \"The evolution in 
Palestinian society is very dangerous.  Hamas is winning 
because it is the only organization that helps the people. 
The PA is corrupt; even Salaam Fayyad cannot control the 
situation.\"  Lieberman outlined a three-step process to 
reform Palestinian society: 1. end terror; 2. reform the 
economy; 3. reform the society overall (politically, 
culturally and educationally). 
 
6.  (C) The Ambassador responded that Lieberman\'s ideas left 
few avenues for forward progress.  He emphasized that, 
although the U.S. fully agreed with Israel that Arafat 
impeded the search for peace, eliminating him was not an 
option the U.S. supported.  It would greatly complicate our 
regional efforts. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Israel Needs to Make Choices, Including 
Improving Palestinian Living Conditions 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) It was important that Israel face up to the hard 
choices it had to make going forward, the Ambassador 
stressed.  Was it viable for Israel to maintain 225,000 
settlers in the West Bank, many of whom were in the midst of 
areas densely populated by Palestinians?  Was having 7,500 
Gaza settlers live amongst 1.5 million Palestinians a wise 
idea?  Although Israel should not take decisions \"under 
fire\", it should also not avoid facing the contradictions 
inherent in perpetuating the settler problem while 
simultaneously wanting to solve it by pulling out of Gaza. 
Israel could take two simple steps that would immediately 
improve the Palestinian economy: lift the back-to-back 
shipping requirement and improve freedom of movement for 
people.  The resulting improvement could pay dividends for 
Israel. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Making the Desert Bloom: 
Developing the Negev and the Galilee 
------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) The Ambassador noted he had told Effie Eitam that, 
although they had agreed to disagree on settlements, he was 
still interested in Eitam\'s development efforts within Green 
Line Israel, such as in the Negev and Galilee.  What was 
Lieberman\'s take?  The Minister insisted the GOI should play 
only a limited and very specific role in these areas, with 
infrastructure development.  The key was the newly planned 
railroad line to Dimona, which would reduce travel time to 
Tel Aviv to an hour and twenty minutes.  As for the rest, 
\"the market will do the job.\" 
 
------------- 
Israeli-Arabs 
------------- 
 
9.  (C) As the meeting drew to a close, a pensive Lieberman 
said \"our key issue really is the Israeli-Arabs.  What does 
the U.S. think?\"  The Ambassador said he thought 
Israeli-Arabs were burdened by leaders focused on everything 
but improving their constituents\' daily life.  Lieberman 
claimed the GOI \"already invested more per capita in 
Israeli-Arabs than in other Israelis.\"  The Ambassador said 
he would welcome receiving more information on this. 
 
------------------ 
Transport Security 
------------------ 
 
10.  (C) Responding to the Ambassador\'s question about how 
the GOI planned to increase transportation security in the 
wake of the Ashkelon bombing, Lieberman said his government 
would increase investments in new security equipment, 
starting at the Karni crossing.  The GOI would also improve 
security in Israeli ports. 
 
----------------- 
Visit to the U.S. 
----------------- 
 
11. (C) Lieberman noted he was rescheduling his planned visit 
the U.S. to meet his counterpart, Secretary of Transportation 
Mineta.  It would probably take place at the end of April, 
and he requested the Ambassador alert him to any issues the 
Secretary was likely to raise.  The Ambassador said he would 
 
SIPDIS 
do so.  Lieberman stressed the good bilateral cooperation on 
transportation security issues. 
 
------------ 
Trade Issues 
------------ 
 
12. (C) Lieberman said he was disappointed that more U.S. 
companies were not participating in tenders falling under his 
aegis.  \"I have USD 8 billion in tenders out there and I want 
U.S. companies.\"  He said he was tired of just Siemens and 
Bombardier constantly competing for the same tenders -- there 
was not enough competition.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Jordanian King Abdullah paid a secret visit to Prime 
Minister\'s Ariel Sharon Shikmim ranch, Ha\'aretz and 
Yediot reported.  The media noted that there are no 
details regarding the contents of the meeting but that 
most probably the two leaders discussed the Israeli 
disengagement plan and its possible implications on the 
implementation of the road map for an Israeli- 
Palestinian agreement. 
 
All media highlighted Pakistani belief that they have 
cornered and perhaps wounded Osama bin Laden\'s deputy, 
Ayman al-Zawahri, in a major battle near the Afghan 
border. 
 
The media quoted a GSS report released on Thursday in 
which it exposes that it thwarted 15 attempts by West 
Bank terror groups to commit terror activity against 
Israel, since the beginning of the year.  Among these 
attempts was a Tanzim led group\'s plan to hijack an 
Israeli bus and to hold the hostages in Bethlehem in 
order to get Palestinian prisoners released. The GSS 
officials also revealed that P.A. security forces 
members are involved in the exposed terror cells. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited Washington sources as saying that 
the U.S. may postpone its announcement of the sanctions 
it will impose on Syria until after the Arab League 
assembly in Tunis, so as not to anger Arab allies. 
 
Yated Ne\'eman cited senior Palestinian officials as 
saying that the U.S., Britain and Egypt are preparing 
plans for the day after Yasser Arafat departs from 
ruling the Palestinian Authority.  The plans involve 
Jordan and Egypt so at the end of the process these two 
countries would open their gates for Palestinian 
workers. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that a commander of an Israeli 
Defense Forces tank battalion would be indicted for 
causing the deaths of four Palestinian through 
negligence in a 2002 incident. 
 
Jerusalem Post and Ha\'aretz reported that the daughters 
of Israeli Air Force Colonel Joe Alon, who was shot in 
Washington while serving there as assistant military 
attach, have filed a petition at the High Court of 
Justice against the Israeli government demanding all 
the information gathered about his death.  The 
daughters also filed a request for the FBI file on the 
case under America\'s Freedom of Information Act. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Britain is refusing to sell 
military equipment to Israel.  The paper noted that the 
British excuse for the embargo is the Israeli 
government\'s policy towards the Palestinians. 
All media reported that Major General Dan Halutz is to 
be the next Deputy Chief of Staff. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that three Palestinians were lightly 
wounded on Thursday in clashes with IDF forces during a 
demonstration against the separation fence. Radio 
stations reported today that two Israeli soldiers were 
wounded when a bomb detonated by Hamas militants 
overturned an Israel Defense Forces tank during a 
military raid near the Gaza Strip settlement of 
Netzarim. 
 
Yediot and Maariv reported that several Hollywood stars 
such as Jennifer Aniston, Sharon Stone, Denzel 
Washington and more are slated to participate in an 
evening saluting Israel.  The main speaker of the 
evening will be Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom.

1. \"George Bush, Insurance Corp.\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (March 19): \"For 
Sharon to be able to pass the withdrawal plan in the 
government and the Likud, he needs a festive reception 
in the U.S., perhaps on the ranch in Texas, perhaps at 
Camp David, perhaps in a historic ceremony on the White 
House lawn.  Mainly he needs a presidential declaration 
that he can flourish.  But before the president makes 
his declaration, he needs to be sure that Sharon will 
make his plan pass in the Israeli political 
establishment.  Otherwise, his efforts will have been 
to no avail.  Sharon\'s great, Sisyphean task now is to 
achieve synchronization between Danny Ben Lulu\'s [a 
Likud Central Committee member] electoral aspirations 
and George Bush\'s electoral aspirations.\" 
 
2. \"Waiting for an Invitation\" 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (March 19): 
\"Even if the Americans are starting to digest the 
[disengagement plan] idea they are still withholding 
Sharon\'s invitation to Washington.  And the Prime 
Minister is impatiently waiting for this invitation in 
order to bring what Israel needs in order to begin the 
move: an American public support, an economic 
compensation and \"back wind\" against the majority in 
his government, who oppose the plan.  An American 
recognition, even a general one, for settlement blocks 
in the West Bank, would help him greatly.  The Minister 
of Defense [Shaul Mofaz] tried to satisfy the Americans 
by using a general formula: supporting the large 
settlement blocks does not contradict the traditional 
American policy, which talks about strategic depth and 
defensible borders....  The Americans listened and did 
not answer.  They will give thier answers -- if and 
when -- to the Prime Minister.  And it is unnecessary 
to say that if Sharon returns from Bush with empty 
hands, the move won\'t take place.\"

Washington correspondent Nathan Guttman wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \" A year after Bush 
started a war in order to bestow democracy on Iraq it 
is becoming clear to him that the world did not unite 
with him even after the victory.\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized: \"On 
balance, Bush\'s decision to make it impossible for 
Saddam to make war was justified, and even essential, 
for the future of the region.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------ 
 
1. \"Bush Imagined a Different Scenario\" 
 
Washington correspondent Nathan Guttman wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (March 19): \"A year 
after Bush started a war in order to bestow democracy 
on Iraq it is becoming clear to him that the world did 
not unite with him even after the victory.  If Bush and 
his men believed that from the moment Saddam Hussein\'s 
regime falls the countries of the world would 
understand their mistake and support the war, the 
elections in Spain, the polls in Europe and Arab 
countries position, proved to him that he was left 
alone.... The struggle for American public opinion over 
the war is at its height.... The war in Iraq did not 
succeed in building George Bush\'s image as a leading 
commander enjoying the American public\'s trust.... 
Opposite stands John Kerry and the Democrats, who talk 
about the mistaken information, the international 
isolation and the entanglement continuing on the 
ground.  So was it a good year fro Bush? The answer to 
that question will be given only on November 2 when the 
American public\'s voice is heard.\" 
 
2. \"The Year of Iraq\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (March 
19): \"One year ago today, the American assault on 
Saddam Hussein\'s regime began.  It has been a year of 
many ups and downs: The first strike on Saddam\'s hiding 
place failed; the military campaign to conquer Baghdad 
and overthrow the regime succeeded; the American effort 
to immediately establish a peaceful, democratic Iraq 
failed; the operation to capture Saddam succeeded; the 
effort to cope with acts of guerrilla warfare, 
terrorism and sabotage against the American occupation 
army and its allies failed.  Upon hearing the frequent 
reports of attacks in which Americans and Iraqis are 
killed, it is very tempting to label President George 
W. Bush\'s Iraqi adventure as an expensive entanglement 
that is likely to end badly.  But this would be to take 
the narrow-minded, short-range view.  On balance, 
Bush\'s decision to make it impossible for Saddam to 
make war was justified, and even essential, for the 
future of the region.... In the strategic context, 
Israel should benefit from the war in Iraq.  The 
eastern front has collapsed, in a manner that justifies 
updating our security concept and our defense 
budget.... The Middle East now lies at the heart of 
American policy, and one can only hope that after the 
November elections, the U.S. administration will find 
time to settle the Israeli-Arab conflict.\"

SUBJECT: ZEVULUN ORLEV, MINISTER OF LABOR AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norman Olsen for reasons 1.4 (B) and 
 (D). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Zevulun Orlev, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, 
is a moderate member of the rightist National Religious Party 
(NRP).  He has primarily focused on domestic affairs and 
internal NRP machinations.  Orlev has endeavored to move the 
NRP into a moderate position in order to prove that it is an 
acceptable coalition partner to whichever government is in 
power.  If, however, PM Sharon follows through with his 
unilateral Gaza disengagement plan, Orlev may have difficulty 
preventing the NRP from leaving the government coalition in 
protest over the plan.  Orlev has expressed strong ideas on 
the route of the Separation Fence -- wanting to keep the 
Ariel settlement on the western side of the Fence -- and 
favors expelling Arafat.  He speaks out and acts against the 
secular Shinui party\'s attempts to separate religion from 
government, noting that such separation would \"damage the 
Jewish character of the state....\"  Orlev is an effective and 
prolific legislator; in the 15th Knesset he sponsored 19 
bills that were passed into law, and made the most speeches 
on the Knesset floor.  End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
Political Career 
---------------- 
 
2. (C) Zevulun Orlev, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, 
began his Knesset career in 1999.  He has spent his time in 
the Knesset focused on domestic affairs, rather than on NRP\'s 
bread and butter issues of the peace process and settlements. 
 During the 15th Knesset, he served on several committees, 
including a stint as chairman of the Education and Culture 
Committee, and as a member of the special committee for 
school dropout rates.  He won an award for being the \"Best 
Legislator of the 15th Knesset\" in November 2001 by 
sponsoring 19 bills into law, and making the most speeches in 
the Knesset.  Prior to his Knesset career, he served as 
director general in three ministries, Religious Affairs, 
Education, and Culture. 
 
-------------- 
Party Politics 
-------------- 
 
3. (C) Orlev has been working to moderate NRP\'s image.  This 
is exemplified by the NRP for the first time sending a woman, 
Gila Finkelstein, to the Knesset in the last elections. 
Recently Orlev has also been advocating a \"wait and see\" 
position on NRP withdrawal from the government over Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan.  The goal of Orlev and the NRP leadership 
is to remain in the center-right of the political spectrum, 
enabling them to join any coalition in power and snap up key 
ministries for the party.  In 2002, Orlev, and NRP colleagues 
Shaul Yahalom and Yitzhak Levy attempted to regain lost 
Knesset seats by placing Effie Eitam, a popular right-wing 
firebrand and retired IDF general, into the position of party 
chairman for the prime ministerial elections.  Their strategy 
proved unsuccessful when Sharon won the election by a clear 
majority.  Orlev and others in the NRP\'s central committee 
have been maneuvering to replace Eitam with Orlev, leaving 
Yahalom to move into the number two slot.  Eitam has been 
trying to reduce Orlev\'s influence, but has been largely 
unsuccessful.  In the past, NRP\'s seats were needed to form a 
coalition.  In the 2003 elections, Sharon\'s strong showing 
meant that the NRP was not needed, but the party was welcomed 
into the coalition. 
 
4. (C) Sharon\'s unilateral Gaza disengagement plan threatens 
the interests of NRP\'s core constituancy, the settlers. 
Orlev, unlike the majority of NRP members, nonetheless 
opposes the party leaving the government coalition if the 
plan is brought to the Knesset.  In a recent interview with a 
right-wing TV station, Arutz 7, Orlev said he would support 
withdrawing from the coalition only if he is convinced that 
the NRP has absolutely no influence on coalition decisions 
regarding any withdrawal.  Orlev noted that Sharon has not 
brought the issue to the Cabinet, that he has no majority 
because of the right-wing faction, and that as long as this 
is the case, Sharon will not bring the matter to a Knesset 
vote. 
 
----------- 
Anti-Shinui 
----------- 
 
5. (C) The entry of the secular Shinui party into the 
government after the last election has led Orlev to speak out 
against that party\'s attempted reforms.  When the Interior 
Ministry, led by Shinui MK Avraham Poraz, declined to enforce 
laws against public display of leavened foods during Passover 
last year, Orlev said that it was \"damaging the Jewish 
character of the state and the delicate social fabric of 
Israeli society.\"  He also spoke out against suspending fines 
on businesses that violate the law by employing Jews on the 
Sabbath.  He told Ha\'aretz in March 2003 that \"suspending the 
(Sabbath) inspector\'s work was a blatant violation of the 
status quo on religion-and-state issues.\"  Orlev also voted 
against a proposal by Interior Minister Poraz that would 
allow non-Israeli citizens who had served in the IDF for 18 
months to apply for citizenship, arguing that this proposal 
would dilute Israel\'s Jewish identity. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Views on Arafat and the Separation Fence 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) In response to the January 28 suicide bomb attack in 
Jerusalem, Orlev urged the PM to \"implement the security 
cabinet\'s decision to exile Arafat without delay.\"  Orlev 
stated that if Arafat were not expelled it would leave the 
door open to other attacks.  This past fall, during the 
debate over the route of the separation fence, six ministers, 
including Orlev, objected to the decision to route the fence 
west of Ariel, as well as other settlements deep into West 
Bank territory.  At the time Orlev told Arutz-7 television 
that Israel \"was not an American colony and that our first 
priority is to protect our citizens in Ariel and everywhere 
else.\"  He was also quoted saying that Israelis must tell 
Americans, \"that they must not interfere in our defense 
considerations.\"

SUBJECT: UN ENVOY PREVIEWS ARAFAT \"ASCENSION\" PROPOSAL 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
. 
 
1. (C) Summary:  UN Special Coordinator Terje Larsen reviewed 
for the Ambassador his recent exchanges with GOI, PA, 
Egyptian, and Jordanian officials on PM Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan, and laid out an idea for enticing 
Arafat\'s cooperation in combating terrorism by offering him 
an \"elevated,\" ceremonial position, while devolving genuine 
power to the prime minister.  Citing a \"radical change\" in 
the discourse about the Israeli-Palestinian situation, Larsen 
said, \"Everyone is talking about how to get rid of Arafat.\" 
End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
A Higher Calling for Arafat? 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a March 19 meeting, Larsen previewed for the 
Ambassador a proposal for Arafat\'s \"ascension\" that Larsen 
will make at the upcoming Cairo meeting of Quartet envoys. 
Although he pegged the proposal\'s chances of success at \"much 
less than 50 percent,\" he said he had not been able to come 
up with a better alternative.  Larsen explained that the 
proposal is based on the assumption that, if Arafat feels 
excluded from the process by which Israel unilaterally 
disengages from Palestinian territories, and marginalized by 
the international community\'s \"day after\" efforts -- 
including a possible UNSCR in which Arafat would not figure 
-- it is certain that he will play a spoiler role, sowing 
further chaos.  Based on conversations Larsen has had with a 
variety of European, Palestinian, and other Arab players (see 
below for further details), the UN envoy believes that there 
will be a \"critical mass\" to deliver an ultimatum to the PA 
Chairman, offering him international legitimacy for a genuine 
devolution of power -- \"or else....\"  Larsen posited that the 
carrot of being welcomed worldwide as a rehabilitated leader 
would be enough to entice the PA Chairman to ascend to a 
purely ceremonial position, ceding all of his power to the 
prime minister. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Larsen Hears an Emerging Consensus 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) In making his case, Larsen cited numerous 
conversations he has had with key players in recent weeks. 
 
-- Larsen was animated about a \"radical change\" he perceives 
in the discourse about the Israeli-Palestinian situation. 
\"Everyone,\" he said, \"is talking about how to get rid of 
Arafat.\"  For example, German Foreign Minister Fischer had 
opened his last conversation with Larsen by asking,\" How can 
we get rid of (Arafat)?\"  Jordanian Foreign Minister Muasher, 
whom he had recently met in Amman, asked rhetorically, \"What 
can we do about the Chairman?\" 
 
-- Larsen said the British were \"on board\" with his proposal, 
while the French were \"kind of on board.\" 
 
-- In Cairo this past week, Larsen had met with a variety of 
Egyptian leaders, including FM Maher, whom he described as 
\"open-minded.\"  Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa, 
reportedly speaking about the broader issue of Israeli 
disengagement, said, \"If it\'s clean, we\'d welcome it.\"  Omar 
Sulayman, who had just returned from meeting with Arafat in 
Ramallah, characterized the tough message he had delivered to 
the Chairman:  \"Either take action against terror, or you 
will have to hand over all of your powers to Abu Ala\'a.\" 
Sulayman reportedly took Larsen\'s point that Arafat must face 
explicit sanctions if he fails to deliver, but Larsen was not 
convinced that the \"tough message\" Sulayman delivered had 
gone that far. 
 
-- Larsen had also recently met with Abu Mazen, and a number 
of his former ministers, who are currently staying at a villa 
in Amman.  Abu Mazen reportedly responded positively to 
Larsen\'s proposal but suggested amending it to add a new 
position of vice president -- a position he envisioned 
himself as filling -- to act as a \"buffer\" between Arafat and 
the prime minister. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Although the Message is Muddied By Sycophants 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Meanwhile, Larsen said, Arafat advisors, such as Nabil 
Abu Rudeineh, Nabil Sha\'ath, and Sa\'eb Erakat, are not 
telling the Chairman the truth about how negatively he is 
perceived by the international community.  Indeed, Abu 
Rudeineh has been encouraging Arafat to \"hang in there.\"  As 
a result, Arafat believes that, \"if Qadhafi can be 
rehabilitated, so can he.\"  Citing second-hand information, 
Larsen lamented that even Mohammed Dahlan, who \"talks tough\" 
about Arafat, tends to lose his resolve in the presence of 
the Chairman.  Indeed, according to an account from the 
Palestinian Minister of Agriculture, who was in the recent 
meeting between Dahlan and Arafat, Dahlan had tried, at the 
beginning of the meeting to kiss Arafat\'s hand.  Arafat 
reportedly pulled back his hand in that instance, but Dahlan 
succeeded in kissing it at two later points in the meeting. 
 
5. (C) Noting that he would be the last person to argue 
against a process that would lead to an empowered prime 
minister, the Ambassador nonetheless expressed skepticism 
that Larsen\'s proposal would work.  Pointing out that Arafat 
can still \"buy\" loyalty on the street, and that he still has 
at his command people who will perpetrate violence and 
terror, he doubted that Arafat would give up those assets 
without a fight.  Moreover, it is not clear who is willing to 
fight Arafat, if/when it comes to that.

SUBJECT: THE COSTS OF THE INTIFADA TO THE ISRAELI ECONOMY 
 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Ted Mann for Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  More than three years into the Intifada, a 
lively debate has ensued about its costs to the Israeli 
economy, both past and future.  A fair degree of unanimity 
exists among experts that past costs were huge, with Bank of 
Israel and Ministry of Finance estimates falling somewhere 
between 9 to 13 billion dollars in lost GDP.  Opinions on 
future costs are strongly divided, however.  The Ministry of 
Finance argues that the economy has adjusted to the Intifada 
and that it no longer has a major impact on the current 
growth rate.  Bank of Israel analysts say it continues to be 
a drag on the economy and point to continued problems with 
consumption and investment, saying these reflect the 
continuing security concerns of the average Israeli.  End 
Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
A Little Bit of History 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Israeli economists may not agree on the current and 
future impact of the Intifada, but they generally agree on 
its past economic effects.  According to the Ministry of 
Finance and the Bank of Israel, the Intifada impacted the 
Israeli economy through a series of ever-widening ripple 
effects.  Immediately after the violence broke out in 
September 2000, the violence hit a small number of economic 
sectors intensely, particularly tourism, exports to the 
occupied territories, construction and agriculture.  The 
GOI\'s decision to reduce access of Palestinian laborers into 
Israel directly and negatively influenced growth rates in the 
latter two sectors.  MoF estimates indicate that the violence 
led to a 3% drop in annual GDP in 2001 based on an analysis 
of statistics relating to tourism, trade with the PA, and 
transport.  A large part of this decline was due to the fall 
in tourism receipts from $4.4 billion in the year ending 
September 2000 to an estimated $2.1 billion in 2002. 
 
3.  (C) The MoF quantified initial damage to construction and 
agriculture at the onset of the Intifada by assessing the 
seasonally-adjusted decrease in activity in these areas in 
the fourth quarter of 2000 compared with the level during the 
previous quarter.  For example, in construction the 
difference came to NIS 1.2 billion in 2000 prices, or about 
0.3 percent of GDP for 2000 alone. 
 
4.  (C) As the Intifada continued into 2001 and 2002, 
Israelis realized that it was going to affect their lives 
over the longer term.  The resulting negative wealth effect 
exerted a powerful influence on investment and private 
consumption.  Per-capita spending on private consumption 
decreased by an estimated 2.3 percent in 2002 after rising 
for many years, a figure that includes a sharp drop of 11 
percent in per-capita consumption of durable goods. 
 
5.  (C) Another direct effect of the Intifada was the 
reallocation of budgetary funds to increased Israeli defense 
expenditures, which rose from 8.4 percent of GDP in 2000 to 
an estimated 10.2 percent in 2002.  The reallocation had 
wider effects:  As the MoF notes in a January 2003 MoF 
report, \"the primary downside of the hike in defense 
expenditure is that it necessitates cuts in other budgets, 
impairing the level of services and citizens\' standard of 
living, and/or an increase in the tax burden, which harms the 
business sector and is liable to affect the potential for 
future growth.\" 
 
----------------------- 
Parsing a Triple Whammy 
----------------------- 
 
6.  (C) The MoF\'s chief economist, Michael Sarel, readily 
admits that his ministry\'s calculations on the Intifada\'s 
impact are speculative.  The main difficulty any analysis of 
the Intifada\'s costs encounters is disaggregating the causes 
of Israel\'s 2001-2002 recession, in which the country faced 
three separate challenges: the Intifada; the world recession; 
and the collapse of the NASDAQ (the level of which correlates 
highly with Israeli high-tech exports).  According to the 
MoF, the recession as a whole reduced GDP by 5.0 percent in 
2001, and by another 4.6 percent in 2002 compared to a 
baseline level projecting growth at the average level of the 
1990s. 
 
7.  (U) The January MoF 2003 report says that \"several 
studies have tried to assess the relative impacts of the 
various shocks on the level of economic activity.  The 
standard assessment is that the impact of Palestinian 
terrorism on activity in 2001 was approximately equal to the 
impact of the other shocks ... and was responsible for about 
half the disparity in GDP.  It is harder to come up with an 
estimate for 2002 and 2003, but presumably terrorism is 
responsible for more than half of the total damage to GDP. 
Therefore, it can be said that the harm done by Palestinian 
terrorism to Israeli GDP in 2001-2003 totals at least $14 
billion.  This does not include direct harm to persons, 
property and to the well-being of individuals.\"  As this 
report was written prior to the recovery in 2003 GDP, Sarel 
told us he now believes that it overestimates the cost of the 
Intifada by at least USD one billion. 
 
------------- 
BOI Estimates 
------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) In its 2002 and 2003 annual reports, the Bank of 
Israel also provides an estimate of the Intifada\'s costs. 
The BOI estimates the loss of GDP in 2002 alone due to the 
continuation of the Intifada, comparing the actual situation 
with what it could have been had the unrest concluded at the 
end of 2001.  This estimate yields a cost range between 3.1 
and 3.8 percent of GDP. The BOI notes, \"this approach is not 
the same as comparing the situation with what would have 
happened had the Intifada not erupted at all; an estimate ... 
using that approach yields a far greater loss as it 
incorporates in its base the unmaterialized growth in 2001 as 
a result of the Intifada.\"  (Comment.  The latter approach is 
essentially that taken by the MoF in its estimates, which are 
considerably higher.  End Comment.) 
 
9.  (C) The BOI has provided the Embassy a pre-publication 
copy of its 2003 Annual Report, which estimates the cost of 
the Intifada in 2003.  The report outlines two scenaria 
according to which the Intifada affected the economy to 
different degrees resulting in a cost of between 0.7 percent 
to 1.8 percent of GDP.  The BOI breaks its data down into the 
two scenaria presented in the following chart, in which the 
column headings are: 
 
A. Actual Figures for 2003 
B. Projected Figures without the Intifada, Higher Impact 
Scenario 
C. Projected Figures without the Intifada, Lower Impact 
Scenario 
 
 
Category of Impact                  A      B       C 
 
Gross Domestic Investment       -14.0    1.8    -1.4 
 
Residential Building Investment  -3.7    5.0     3.0 
 
Private Consumption               1.8    3.8     2.9 
 - w/o Consumer Durables          1.9    3.2     2.7 
 - Consumer Durables Only         0.1   10.0     5.0 
 
Public Consumption               -1.0   -1.9    -2.2 
 
Domestic Defense Consumption     -1.5  -11.4   -10.0 
 
Exports                           6.2    8.9     7.4

GDP                               1.3    3.1     2.0 
 
 
10.  (C) It is worth taking a closer look at the 
sub-components of investment numbers from 2002-2003, since 
these show divergent trends.  While gross domestic investment 
(which the BoI uses in its estimates) fell from 89.457 
billion shekels in 2002 to 77.342 billion shekels in 2003, 
foreign direct investment increased from USD 1.647 billion to 
3.748 billion.  Michael Sarel told us he had asked the 
Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) for a detailed breakdown 
of FDI utilization in order to explain this discrepancy. 
Unfortunately, the CBS was unable to provide this 
information.  Sarel theorized that the increase in FDI was 
the result of a number of factors: the end of worries about 
Iraq; the increased stability of the Israeli economy as the 
result of the U.S. loan guarantees and the Netanyahu economic 
plan; the expansion of the U.S. economy in 2003, which 
brought funds from U.S. investors looking for overseas 
opportunities; and lastly a major change in how certain 
investments were entered into Israeli FDI figures. 
 
11.  (SBU)  Bank of Israel Estimates of Year-by-Year Intifada 
Costs 
(constant 2000 prices, amounts in billions) 
 
Year     Fall in GDP    Loss in: Shekels     Dollars 
 
2001              2%     9.28 billion        2.28 
 
2002       3.1%-3.8%    14.3 - 17.5          3.5 - 4.3 
 
2003       0.8%-1.9%     3.7 -  8.8           .92 - 2.2 
 
Total                   27.3 - 35.6          6.7 - 8.7 
 
According to Flug, the BOI believes its numbers underestimate 
the overall, cumulative cost of the Intifada, as they do not 
account for the effect of each year\'s reduced growth on the 
growth of subsequent years. \"I would say the overall cost is 
at least USD 9 billion,\" she told us. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
The Future Costs: MoF and BoI Present Different Analyses 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
12.  (C) Although the differences in the BOI\'s and MOF\'s 
estimates are not insignificant, they are mainly 
methodological in character and are generally comparable. 
These two institutions\' views diverge regarding future costs, 
however.  Michael Sarel thinks that, economically speaking, 
the Intifada has run its course.  In his view, the violence 
has reduced the annual level of Israeli GDP by approximately 
6 percent below what it would have been otherwise.  He 
realizes this is not an insignificant cost and accepts that 
the drop will not be made up until a peace track has been 
established.  But for him, the key issue is how future growth 
rates have been affected.  \"If our potential growth rate is 
4% per year, and population growth is 2% per year, Israelis 
should be able to expect their average economic level to 
increase gradually over time.\"  If, however, the Intifada has 
seriously affected prospects for future growth, these 
expectations will increasingly not be met.  Sarel says the 
difference is between a stagnant economy where the best minds 
move elsewhere and immigration tapers off and an economy that 
not only keeps its talent and innovation but adds to it.  \"At 
stake is the future of the country.\" 
 
13.  (C) Sarel pointed to a number of factors that support 
his analysis that Israel is back on track towards meeting its 
economic growth potential, and which are part of a model the 
ministry is working on that preliminarily supports his 
hypothesis.  First of all, the IDF is doing its job 
protecting Israelis from terror.  Whereas 450 Israelis died 
from terror attacks in 2002, that number had fallen to 211 in 
2003 and is likely to fall even further this year, he 
believes.  Average monthly tourist arrivals increased to 
eighty-eight thousand in 2003 from seventy-two thousand in 
2002, an increase that became particularly pronounced 
following the war in Iraq.  Private consumption is also 
gradually improving. 
 
14.  (C) Flug, on the other hand, believes the growth rate 
has been seriously dampened by the intifada, and points to 
problems with investment.  \"How could the Intifada not impact 
our growth rate?\" she asked.  Flug noted that Israel is an 
open economy competing for world capital.  Although it has 
tremendous strengths in human capital, these are offset by 
regional instability.  Although some courageous investors 
might be willing to take a chance in Israel, she believes 
that at least a significant portion of other investors would 
not be willing to do so.  As for recent increases in 
consumption, she again believes logic dictates the figures 
would be better without the Intifada.  She insists growth 
will not return to its potential until a peace process \"with 
results\" is established. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
15. (C)  Although we respect Sarel\'s economic credentials and 
insights, we tend to support Flug\'s analysis.  Decreased 
levels of domestic investment in 2003 compared to 2002 are 
just one reflection of the effect of \"Intifada insecurity\". 
As for the Israeli \"recovery,\" in per-capita terms the 
economy continued to decline in 2003 for the third year in a 
row and will show only a very small increase in 2004, in 
spite of the recovery in global growth and particularly in 
technology spending.  To put it another way, we believe that 
if the Israelis and the Palestinians were engaged in a 
credible peace process, growth rates would be significantly 
higher than they are now.  That is the real cost of the 
Intifada, and one that only grows larger every year the 
violence continues.

------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Israel Radio, followed by the other electronic media, 
reported that at around 5:30 this morning, Hamas leader 
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, one of his sons, and some of his 
bodyguards and associates, were killed in an IAF 
helicopter missile hit.  The radio reported that PM 
Sharon personally commanded the action.  The station 
reported on a number of subsequent incidents in Israel, 
East Jerusalem and the territories.  Israel Radio cited 
a gamut of responses to the action in the political 
arena, ranging from satisfaction on the Right to 
reservations, even condemnations on the Left.  The 
station quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz as saying 
that Yassin had been \"the Palestinian bin Laden.\" 
Israeli Arab MK Ahmed Tibi said on Israel Radio that 
Yassin was more moderate than the Hamas leaders 
destined to succeed him.  Some senior Labor Party 
members, such as Ephraim Sneh, expressed their 
satisfaction over the deed.  Like many commentators, 
some Shinui ministers expressed their concern that 
Yassin\'s assassination will start a new wave of 
terrorism.  Israel Radio and IDF Radio reported that 
the U.S. State Department is urging all sides to 
exercise restraint. 
 
Yediot quoted PM Sharon as saying Sunday at his meeting 
with the Likud cabinet ministers that he will bring his 
disengagement plan for cabinet approval immediately 
after his meeting with President Bush.  All media 
(banners in Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post) reported that 
at the meeting Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu set 
terms for backing Sharon\'s disengagement plan: all of 
the points of entry to the Gaza Strip must remain in 
Israeli hands; there must be a public and detailed U.S. 
rejection of the Palestinian demand for the right of 
refugees to return to Israel; and, the necessity to 
complete the security fence before withdrawal from Gaza 
begins, including building the fence around the Ariel, 
Gush Etzion and Ma\'aleh Adumim settlement blocs, as 
well as around Route 443 from Modi\'in to Jerusalem. 
(Leading media note that the U.S. has objected to the 
route of the fence dipping deep into the West Bank.) 
Leading media cited the disappointment of cabinet 
ministers on the Right about Netanyahu\'s view.  Maariv 
quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz as saying at the 
meeting that the evacuation from Gaza would increase 
terrorism originating in the West Bank.  Yediot 
reported that Sharon decided to give up holding a 
referendum on the disengagement plan when he realized 
that legislative action was needed for such a move. 
Sunday, Yediot quoted Jordanian King Abdullah II of 
Jordan as saying that Sharon promised him Jordan would 
not be harmed by the disengagement. 
 
Leading media reported that seven Palestinians, 
including a woman, were killed in an IDF operation 
Sunday.  Ha\'aretz and other media reported that more 
than 30 Palestinians and Israeli demonstrators were 
injured Sunday in clashes with security forces during a 
protest against the separation fence near the village 
of Harbata, north of Modi\'in.  During the weekend, all 
media reported that Fatah\'s Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades 
claimed responsibility for the shooting of 20-year-old 
\"settler\" George Khoury, a Christian Arab, in 
Jerusalem\'s French Hill neighborhood.  The Brigades 
later apologized for their \"mistake.\"  The PA also 
offered its apologies -- its Chairman Yasser Arafat did 
so in a personal call to Khoury\'s family. 
 
Sunday, Yediot led with a warning by the GOI\'s anti- 
terror control center that Israelis should not travel 
to Sinai, Istanbul, and selected destinations in the 
Arab and third worlds during the Passover (early April) 
holidays. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Sunday Hamas welcomed the 
PA High Court\'s decision to unfreeze the bank accounts 
of nine charities suspected of funding terrorist groups

Sunday, Yediot reported that the sanctions President 
Bush will take next week, under the Syrian 
Accountability Act, are: a ban of flights to the U.S. 
by Syrian airliners; a ban on oil-related investments 
in Syria; and, a restriction of Syrian-bound exports to 
food and medicines only.  Sunday, Jerusalem Post

\"Illogical Assassination\" 
 
Liberal op-ed writer Ofer Shelach commented on Ynet, a 
website affiliated to mass-circulation, pluralist 
Yediot Aharonot (March 22): \"Every Israeli, and 
presumably every Palestinian, knew that Israel would 
eventually assassinate Sheikh Yassin, and not only 
because once it tried to half-heartedly.   The accursed 
cycle of terror and revenge, action and retaliation, 
had to play itself out.  And since Yasser Arafat has 
already been expelled orally countless times, but 
Israel did not dare to carry it out, only the Hamas 
leader remained.  After so many threats, after so many 
provocations, it was bound to happen.   It was bound to 
happen because both sides to this conflict have long 
since ceased to calculate cause and effect, benefit and 
damage....  Yassin indeed \'oversaw\' terror, as the 
current IDF newspeak describes it.  He gave 
instructions to try to increase or reduce activity at 
certain times.  But the great contractors of terror did 
not receive missions and targets from him, and do not 
need him to act.... None of their capability to 
dispatch murderers has been impaired.  This is known by 
every Israeli, including the IDF commanders and the 
political echelon that authorized this operation.  But 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has long since ceased 
to be about leadership and logic, control and 
decisions, cause and effect.  This conflict is 
currently a tribal war, ruled by feelings of vengeance 
and inability to tolerate killing without reacting. 
Ahmed Yassin died because he who lives by the sword 
shall die by the sword.  In his death, he bequeathed us 
nothing but more death.\"

conclude that Israel has fought the Palestinians for 
three-and-a-half years in order to return to the exact 
point at which the Intifada broke out.\"

I.  \"Back to Clinton Plan\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote on page one of 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (March 21): 
\"Sharon\'s bureau chief, Dov Weisglass, told Bush\'s 
staff: \'[America] has already agreed to the settlement 
blocs [to be retained by Israel].\'  But the Israeli 
plan can also be seen in the negative: if Sharon wants 
American recognition for the annexation of 5 percent of 
the West Bank, he is implicitly conceding the other 95 
percent.  His office denies this, saying that this will 
merely constitute the starting point for future 
negotiations, during which Israel will demand 
additional parts of the West Bank. But why would the 
U.S. agree to that in the future?  It is hard not to 
conclude that Israel has fought the Palestinians for 
three-and-a-half years in order to return to the exact 
point at which the Intifada broke out.  How else does 
one explain that after all the terror attacks, deaths, 
recession, reoccupation of the West Bank, and Yasser 
Arafat\'s confinement, Israel is asking for a renewed 
American commitment to the Clinton plan?  From Sharon\'s 
perspective, American recognition of the settlement 
blocs is meant mainly to pacify the Likud ministers, 
who are demanding \'something in exchange for the 
withdrawal.\'  Bush\'s support is also meant to show the 
plan\'s opponents in the Likud that the American 
president does not view it as \'rewarding terrorism\' -- 
a criticism that its local critics have frequently 
hurled at the unilateral pullback.  But Weisglass\'s 
main job during his trip to Washington this week will 
be to obtain assurances from the U.S. that Israel will 
not be expected to negotiate with the Palestinians 
until they change their leadership and halt terror.  In 
this way, Israel will effectively receive the \'long- 
term interim agreement\' that Sharon has always wanted.\" 
 
II.  \"Necessary Conditions\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 22): \"The U.S. ... should not think of itself as 
an innocent bystander on whose lap a sticky plan has 
been dumped, but as a player whose many previous plans 
have come home to roost.  If anything, Sharon\'s plan is 
a reversion to a bastardization of Washington\'s 
historic land-for-peace concept -- land without peace. 
The U.S. cannot complain that Israel has not tried.  We 
tried Oslo, Camp David, Taba, and then we dutifully 
pretended, to this day, that the Palestinian Authority 
should be given endless chances to fight terrorism, 
rather than provide an umbrella for it.  It is in this 
context that the U.S. is being faced with the demands 
of Netanyahu\'s rebellious band of Likud ministers: that 
the U.S. explicitly reject the Palestinians demand of 
\'return\' to Israel, recognize Israel\'s right to 
permanently retain settlement blocs, and to temporarily 
control all Palestinians borders.... If anything, the 
Likud ministers should have made a fourth demand: that 
Washington fully blame the Palestinian Authority for 
its failure to combat terrorism, and force new 
elections and drastic reforms by depriving the PA of 
the international funding that keeps it afloat. 
Israel\'s demands all go to quarantining a terrorist 
regime, not preventing one from becoming further 
entrenched.  What is missing most from both 
Washington\'s and Jerusalem\'s thinking is how to 
transform the nascent terrorist state on the other side 
of the fence.\"

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
\"One Year On\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 21): \"In toppling Saddam Hussein\'s regime, the 
U.S. sent the message that dictators cannot forever 
scorn the civilized world with impunity.  This is 
what\'s called \'demonstration effect,\' and the world is 
better off for it.  The U.S. has also set in motion a 
mechanism aimed at delivering the Arab world\'s first- 
ever democracy.... Ironically, just as the invasion\'s 
anniversary came, Europe has itself been handed a 9/11- 
type of terrorist attack.  Depressingly, many Europeans 
lost no time blaming their victimization on America, 
mentioning Spain\'s dispatch of several hundred troops 
to Iraq.  Such critics would do well to recall that 
when America was attacked it had yet to invade Iraq and 
Afghanistan.  The enemy, in other words, was intent 
long ago on fighting the West in its entirety -- first 
by dividing it.  Here, then, is the challenge facing us 
all as we approach the next phase in the war on 
terrorism.\"

SUBJECT: TRADE MINISTER OLMERT PROMISES COOPERATION, ACTION 
ON TRADE ISSUES 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary.  Vice Prime Minister and Minister of 
Industry, Trade and Labor (MOIT) Ehud Olmert told the 
Ambassador March 18 that he takes U.S. complaints about trade 
barriers seriously and would seek to correct problems.  He 
said MOIT will be the point of contact on complaints related 
to government procurement and will intercede with other 
ministries if necessary.  Similarly, MOIT will carefully 
review the GOI standards\' regime, with the goal of 
introducing U.S. standards whenever possible.  Olmert asked 
his staff to look quickly into the most immediate 
standards-related issue -- the decision to build the new gas 
transmission network using obscure Dutch standards.  Olmert 
insisted that the USG would be pleased with new 
pharmaceutical data protection rules the GOI will unveil 
within the next few weeks.  He said the GOI hoped to be able 
to tap into new FTAs the U.S. had negotiation through 
\"cumulation\" arrangements.  He complained about Egypt\'s 
\"unreasonable\" posture on proposed QIZs.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Olmert told the Ambassador that he requested the 
meeting following the Ambassador\'s recent public remarks 
about the imbalance in the bilateral trade relationship.  He 
took the remarks seriously, and saw it as his \"moral 
commitment\" to the U.S. to explore ways how the two 
governments could improve the ability of U.S. companies to 
compete in the Israeli market.  The amount of the U.S. trade 
deficit with Israel is distorted, he said, by the huge amount 
of diamonds Israel exports to the U.S.  Nevertheless, even 
without diamonds, Israel\'s trade surplus with the U.S. is 
growing.  Olmert cautioned that there were limits to what the 
GOI could do to improve the balance of trade, since 
individual companies, and not the government, make the great 
majority of purchasing decisions.  The Ambassador replied 
that the Embassy had identified three areas where we believed 
governmental action could help \"level the playing field\" for 
U.S. firms: procurement, standards and IPR. 
 
----------- 
Procurement 
----------- 
 
3.  (C)  The Ambassador said the GOI needed to increase the 
openness and transparency of Israel\'s government procurement 
process.  He specifically noted problems U.S. firms had 
encountered in bidding on contracts for the Israel Electric 
Company, the Jewish Agency, and the Ministry of Defense.  The 
Ambassador said the common practice of awarding contracts 
without an open and fair bidding process was of special 
concern.  American firms may have won some of these directed 
contracts.  Nevertheless, this approach is fundamentally 
flawed.  A system where the bidder offering the best prices 
and the best services wins the contract would be in 
everyone\'s interest - the GOI, Israeli consumers, and U.S. 
firms.  The Ambassador urged Olmert to establish a central 
clearing house for all governmental and parastatal tenders, 
and to designate an ombudsman to which U.S. and other firms 
could turn when encountering problems with the GOI 
procurement process. 
 
4.  (C)  In reply, Ronit Kan, Deputy Director General of the 
Ministry, cited examples of what she described as the notable 
success of U.S. companies in obtaining government-related 
business in Israel.  The GOI continuously strives to improve 
its procurement policies, she said.  The Ministry of Finance, 
in particular, was working on ways to make the bidding 
process more open and transparent, so much so that it was 
encountering strong criticism from Israeli companies that 
were angered at the increased foreign competition.  Kan said 
that representatives of American firms, unlike European 
businesspersons, had sometimes been unwilling to travel to 
Israel to promote their products or services, putting them at 
a competitive disadvantage.  The Ambassador responded that 
the U.S. was seeking a level playing field so that those U.S. 
firms that had a presence here and wanted to compete could 
have a fair shot at contracts. 
 
5.  (C)  Minister Olmert said he doubted the creation of a 
central clearinghouse or a designated ombudsman would be 
possible in Israel.  The United States, he said, had no such 
mechanisms either.  The Ambassador replied that the USG has 
strict, enforceable procurement regulations that must be 
abided by.  Olmert said this was, by and large, the case in 
Israel as well.  The GOI, he continued, was willing to 
address any procurement deficiencies identified by the USG. 
He asked that the Embassy provide specifics on any 
procurement problems that companies face, and said that Ronit 
Kan would be the point of contact.  Her office would 
investigate all claims brought by U.S. companies.  If MOIT 
received an unsatisfactory answer from the involved GOI 
agencies, it would insist on a change in policy. 
 
--------- 
Standards 
--------- 
 
6.  (C)  The Ambassador asked that U.S. standards be given at 
least an equal footing with EU and other standards.  He told 
Olmert that U.S. standards institutes and standards 
developing organizations were ready to engage in a dialogue 
with their Israeli counterparts to gain improved acceptance 
of U.S. standards.  The Ambassador also asked Olmert to 
investigate the adoption of an obscure Dutch standard for 
Israel\'s natural gas pipeline infrastructure.  Olmert said he 
was unaware of the gas standards issue, but promised the 
Ambassador that he would investigate. 
 
7.  (C)  Kan confirmed that Israeli law allows the adoption 
of more than one standard if both standards are accepted 
internationally.  She said the GOI needed a better 
understanding of how U.S. regulatory bodies work, and 
welcomed the Ambassador\'s message that U.S. regulators were 
seeking a dialogue.  She said EU standards bodies had been 
very active in Israel.  Through the Barcelona Process, an EU 
policy program aimed at strengthening ties between the EU and 
the countries of the Mediterranean Basin, Israel had 
developed a strong understanding, and hence acceptance, of EU 
standards regimes.  The Ambassador agreed to communicate the 
GOI\'s willingness to discuss standards regimes to the 
relevant U.S. agencies and organizations. 
 
8.  (C)  Olmert, Kan and Yair Shiran, MOIT Director for 
International Affairs, pushed for Mutual Recognition 
Agreements (MRAs) between the United States and Israel. 
Shiran said, for example, that the Israeli Ministry of Health 
accepted the findings of the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration when approving drugs in Israel, but the FDA 
did not accept MOH findings.  He told the Ambassador that the 
GOI was interested in reaching a mutual recognition agreement 
with the FDA.  The Ambassador said the Embassy would forward 
the Israeli interest to Washington, but added that the GOI\'s 
position would be greatly enhanced if Israel would adopt an 
acceptable data protection regime (see para 9 below).  The 
Ambassador noted that the Embassy was expecting further 
guidance from Washington in regard to MRAs with Israel. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Protection of Intellectual Property 
----------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Minister Olmert told the Ambassador that the GOI is 
convinced that Israel is living up to its WTO obligations 
regarding the protection of proprietary pharmaceutical data. 
Olmert said the U.S. was \"exaggerating\" the importance of the 
issue, which in his mind primarily reflected the business 
interests of U.S. pharmaceutical companies.  Still, the GOI 
wanted to find a solution to this problem because it wants to 
make it easier to do business in Israel and because it takes 
USG concerns seriously.  Olmert told the Ambassador that 
there will be a \"dramatic change\" in Israel\'s policy.  Shiran 
said that the interagency working group would deliver its 
suggestions to the ministerial level probably by the end of 
March.  Kan added, however, that the group had yet to reach a 
final recommendation on the changes that Israel should make, 
and was still exploring alternative models. 
 
10.  (C)  The Ambassador said the USG had long been puzzled 
by the GOI\'s policy towards the rights that U.S. music 
companies enjoy when collecting broadcast royalties in 
Israel.  We were disturbed by the GOI\'s recent submission for 
the current Special 301 review.  If the GOI did not really 
intend to deny national treatment to U.S. music companies, 
then it might consider amending its submission very quickly. 
Olmert said the issue was new to him.  He promised the 
Ambassador that his staff would approach the Ministry of 
Justice, which was responsible for the issue within the GOI, 
and report its findings to the Embassy. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Issues of Concern to the GOI - Rules of Origin 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
11.  (C)  Kan told the Ambassador that the GOI was \"amazed\" 
by the tempo with which the U.S. was concluding new free 
trade agreements (FTAs).  Israel was concerned that these 
agreements were causing an erosion of Israel\'s competitive 
position in the U.S. market.  Kan told the Ambassador that 
the GOI hoped that Israeli content would be accepted when 
another U.S. FTA partner calculated the minimum content 
requirement needed to enjoy duty free access to the U.S. 
market.  Olmert added that the GOI was particularly 
interested in such treatment for textile products. 
 
12.  (C)  The Ambassador told Olmert and Kan that the GOI 
should bring the issue up at the planned April meeting of the 
U.S.-Israel Joint Economic Committee.  He added, however, 
that the GOI should understand that it would need to make a 
compelling case - it should not expect this to be an easy 
sell in Washington.  The Ambassador said the GOI might find a 
more positive response if it focused on the new FTA trading 
partners of the U.S. in the Middle East.  As part of its 
economic agenda in the Middle East, the United States was 
interested in improved economic cooperation between those 
countries in the region that were willing and able to sign 
FTAs with the U.S.  Olmert replied that Israel was interested 
in a broader solution, whereas Kan added that Mexico and the 
CAFTA countries were the most interesting cumulation partners 
for Israel. 
 
------------- 
Egyptian QIZs 
------------- 
 
13.  (C)  The Ambassador said the USG takes the view that the 
GOI should engage in a Qualified Industrial Zone (QIZ) 
agreement with Egypt if it believes that such cooperation 
would be in Israel\'s commercial and political interest.  At 
the same time, he urged the GOI to \"widen its lens\" and 
consider the broader benefits that QIZs could bring to 
Israel\'s relations with Egypt.  Olmert replied that, on 
balance, it was questionable whether QIZs with Egypt had any 
real economic benefits for Israel.  Many Israeli companies 
were scared by the potential competition from Egyptian QIZ 
companies. 
 
14. (C)  Olmert added that it was \"unthinkable\" that the GOI 
would immediately give Egypt the same benefits -- i.e. 8% 
minimum Israeli content -- that Jordan now enjoys.  The 
Jordanians received this low input concession only after 
several years of productive, fruitful cooperation.  Egypt had 
also made the process difficult for Israel, he said.  At 
first the GOE was unwilling to talk to the GOI directly, but 
sent businessmen as surrogates.  \"Just because Mubarak is now 
in a different mood won\'t compel us to act and give them what 
they want\", he told the Ambassador.  Nevertheless, Olmert 
said the GOI was willing to compromise.  He believed that an 
agreement would eventually be signed. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
15.  (C)  This was a positive and constructive meeting, but 
the jury is still out on the GOI\'s commitment to take the 
sustained action needed to remove trade barriers.  We are 
encouraged by Olmert\'s pledge of cooperation on procurement 
and standards issues, but recognize that improvement in these 
areas is likely to require continued and persistent pressure 
before real changes will become evident.  One indication of 
the GOI responsiveness will be the government\'s action in 
regard to Israel\'s natural gas transmission system   Key 
tests on IPR will be the level of protection offered by 
Israel\'s promised new data protection policy and a positive 
resolution of the broadcast royalties issue.  End comment.

SUBJECT: PM SHARON BANKING ON U.S. TO SAVE DISENGAGEMENT 
PLAN 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer for reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Following PM Sharon\'s March 21 meeting with 
Likud ministers to discuss his disengagement plan, it appears 
that the Prime Minister may lack the necessary Likud 
ministerial support for the plan to pass a cabinet vote. 
Pundits and Embassy political contacts say the PM will need 
to show U.S. support for the plan, and U.S. recognition of 
Israeli control over several large settlement blocks in the 
West Bank to win sufficient Likud and cabinet support. 
FinMin Netanyahu on March 21 conditioned his support for the 
plan on an official USG rejection of the Palestinian right of 
return, USG support for inclusion of several major West Bank 
settlements inside the fence route, and U.S. acknowledgment 
of Israel\'s right to strike against terrorists inside Gaza 
even after a Gaza withdrawal.  Media pundits and politicians 
believe Sharon is banking on the USG\'s support for his plan 
as well as its blessing for Israel\'s de facto annexation of 
the settlement blocs of Ariel, Maaleh Adumim and Gush Etzion 
to sway Likud fence-sitters.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Likud Ministers Want to be in the Know -- Already 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2.  (SBU) PM Sharon met with Likud ministers to discuss his 
disengagement plan on March 21 amid growing concern among his 
Likud party colleagues that he would leave for Washington to 
discuss his plan before they would be briefed on it.  Sharon 
reportedly spoke about two different Gaza withdrawal 
scenarios -- one that would be an almost complete withdrawal 
from Gaza and one that that was more restricted and without 
withdrawal from the so-called Philadelphi corridor along the 
border of Gaza with Egypt.  In another possible variation, 
Israel would also dismantle four isolated northern 
settlements in the West Bank along with a Gaza withdrawal. 
Few ministers reportedly addressed the session and the Likud 
ministers will reportedly meet again next week to allow for 
further discussion.  In order to make his disengagement plan 
more palatable to the right wing of Likud, Sharon reportedly 
expressed his commitment to seek USG recognition of Israeli 
de facto annexation of three large West Bank settlement 
blocks -- Ariel, Maaleh Adumim, and Gush Etzion -- in return 
for Israel\'s withdrawal from Gaza and from several isolated 
settlements in the West Bank.  Some observers have also 
speculated that Sharon will request U.S. financial assistance 
to offset the cost of dismantling settlements. 
 
3.  (C) According to media speculation and the statements of 
various ministers, some ten ministers out of 23 have 
expressed opposition to Sharon\'s plan, including five Likud 
ministers: Agriculture Minister Yisrael Katz, Public Security 
Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, Health Minister Daniel Naveh, 
Minister-Without-Portfolio Uzi Landau, and Diaspora Affairs 
Minister Natan Sharansky.  Outside Likud, the four right-wing 
coalition party ministers oppose the plan: Effi Eitam 
(National Religious Party), Zevulun Orlev (National Religious 
Party), Benny Elon (National Union), and Avigdor Lieberman 
(National Union).  Eliezer Sandberg (Shinui) told Ambassador 
Kurtzer on March 10 that he also would oppose the plan. 
Several other Likud ministers have voiced opposition, but are 
considered to be wavering on the plan.  They include: Foreign 
Minister Silvan Shalom, Immigration and Absorption Minister 
Tzipi Livni, Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Education 
Minister Limor Livnat, and Minister-without-Portfolio Meir 
Sheetrit.  If these four were to join the opponents listed 
above, the plan would fail in a cabinet vote.  It is unclear 
how many of those wavering Likud ministers would be convinced 
to support the plan if the U.S. were to publicly support it. 
Livni was quoted on the IDF Radio station as saying that 
\"Weissglas\' meeting in Washington is more important\" than the 
Likud ministerial meeting. 
 
4. (C) PM Sharon has been criticized by his Likud colleagues 
for not keeping them in the loop on his disengagement 
proposals.  In fact, Public Security Minister Hanegbi 
complained to Ambassador Kurtzer several week ago that Sharon 
had basically \"ignored\" his own party when it came to the 
plan, and had even briefed Labor leader Shimon Peres on it 
before briefing Likud leaders.  Hanegbi underlined that 
Sharon had made a major mistake by not discussing the plan 
with Likud.  He noted that Sharon could have brought around 
more Likud members if he had explained the logic of the plan 
to them, but that he had not tried to do this. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Netanyahu Would Support the Plan -- With Conditions 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5.  (SBU) On March 21, FinMin Netanyahu announced that he 
would support PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan with three 
conditions premised on U.S. backing: 
 
-- U.S. support for Israel\'s right to launch 
\"counterterrorism\" activities in Gaza even after an Israeli 
withdrawal, and the GOI\'s control over land, sea, and air 
traffic into  and around Gaza. 
 
-- U.S. support for completion -- before an Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza -- of the West Bank security fence that 
establishes Israel\'s control over the settlement blocks of 
Ariel, Etzion and Ma\'ale Adumim as well as the Modi\'in road 
(443). 
 
-- Explicit and official USG rejection of the Palestinian 
right of return.  Netanyahu explained that as long as the 
Palestinians had the hope of returning to former places of 
residence within Green Line Israel, terrorism would continue. 
 
6.  (C) In a Jerusalem Voice of Israel Radio Network 
broadcast March 21, Netanyahu announced that \"if all three 
conditions are not met, (he) would not be able to support 
(Sharon\'s) initiative.\"  He called on his Likud colleagues to 
\"stand united,\" to support Sharon\'s plan, but to \"insist\" on 
the three conditions and \"secure U.S. support\" for them. 
Channel Ten reporter Raviv Drucker told poloff on March 21 
that FinMin Netanyahu skipped the March 21 cabinet meeting in 
order to prepare his statement to the Likud ministerial. 
Quoting Netanyahu, Drucker said that Netanyahu told the Likud 
ministers that withdrawing from Gaza by itself would be a 
dangerous move as it would reward terrorism.  In order to 
minimize this dangerous perception, Netanyahu aimed to 
improve upon Sharon\'s plan.  Drucker speculated that Sharon 
might nominate Netanyahu to head a small ministerial team 
that would implement the disengagement plan and obtain 
Washington\'s concurrence to his three conditions. 
 
7.  (C) In a separate meeting, Deputy PM Ehud Olmert told 
visiting Under Secretary of Defense Dov Zakheim that it was 
unclear exactly what Netanyahu wants and that some think he 
actually is in favor of a Gaza withdrawal.  Olmert speculated 
that Netanyahu was worried that he, as finance minister, 
would be expected to muster the necessary funding to finance 
the withdrawal and settler compensation. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Yassin Hit Could Buoy Support for Plan 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Observers posit that the IDF targeted assassination 
of Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yassin on March 22 could weaken 
some Likud disengagement detractors\' argument that a Gaza 
withdrawal will only serve to reward terrorism and could 
embolden Hamas to commit more terrorist acts.  Mofaz 
announced on Israeli radio March 22, after he met with the 
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, that \"the 
weaker the terror organizations in Gaza grow,...the easier it 
will be to carry out the disengagement plan.\"  Reacting to 
the Yassin assassination, Likud MKs successfully convinced 
the religious Shas Party to withdraw its no-confidence motion 
against Sharon -- on his failure to fully disclose the 
details of his disengagement plan -- which Sharon would have 
likely won in any case. 
 
------ 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) As the Likud faction continues to discuss Sharon\'s 
plan on March 22, Likud ministerial support for the plan 
appears to be contingent on U.S. political support and 
possibly financial backing.  Netanyahu upped the ante, 
calling for U.S. rejection of a Palestinian right of return. 
Media analysis abounds that the wavering Likud ministers, and 
many wavering Likud MKs, are waiting to see just what in the 
way of support the U.S. will offer Sharon in exchange for a 
Gaza withdrawal and, perhaps, accompanying withdrawal of 
isolated settlements in the West Bank.  Given the ideological 
and political views of those ministers opposing the plan, as 
well as the concerns they have raised about it, it may take 
more than positive U.S. statements on the plan for Sharon to 
win them over.  It could take a change in USG policy on West 
Bank settlements.

SUBJECT: HAMAS CHARGES USG CULPABILITY IN YASIN KILLING; 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MARCH IN GAZA PROCESSION 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/C Norm Olsen, per 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
THIS IS A JOINT MESSAGE FROM EMBASSY TEL AVIV AND CONGEN 
JERUSALEM. 
 
1.  (S/NF) Summary: Hamas leaders have responded to the IAF\'s 
assassination of Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin March 22 by 
vowing retaliation against Israel and blaming the USG, saying 
&The Zionists did not take such a step without the approval 
of the terrorist U.S. Administration.  Therefore, it should 
bear responsibility for this crime.8  In Gaza City, hundreds 
of thousands of Palestinians marched in a funeral procession 
over four kilometers long.  In addition to Yasin, two 
bodyguards and four other Hamas members were also killed, and 
Yasin\'s two sons and 17 others were wounded in the IAF 
missile attack.  A senior IDF source told A/DATT that the IDF 
had evidence that Yasin was behind the decisions to escalate 
the number of attacks against Israel, including those 
targeting infrastructure, and to use women as suicide 
bombers, with the ultimate goal of creating the image that 
Hamas had pushed the IDF out of Gaza once Israel executes a 
unilateral withdrawal.  In clashes with the IDF in the West 
Bank and elsewhere in the Gaza Strip, three Palestinians were 
killed and a total of 29 were injured.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) The IDF succeeded in killing Hamas spiritual leader 
Shaykh Ahmad Yasin in the early hours of March 22, as Yasin 
was leaving morning prayers at a mosque in the Zeitoun area 
of Gaza City.  According to IDF sources, IAF helicopters 
fired at least three missiles at Yasin\'s vehicle at 0510 
hours March 22, killing Yasin, two bodyguards, and four other 
Hamas members (Note: UNRWA and Israeli media claimed that the 
four were passersby.  End note.).  Yasin\'s two sons, along 
with 17 others, were wounded; Israeli media claimed that one 
of Yasin\'s sons died subsequently of his injuries.  According 
to GOI sources, the attack was planned after two Palestinians 
from Gaza carried out the March 14 suicide attack in the port 
of Ashdod that killed ten Israelis and wounded 20.  Defense 
Minister Shaul Mofaz had also told the Israeli cabinet March 
21 that the IDF had developed plans to \"severely weaken\" 
Hamas ahead of an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. 
 
3.  (S/NF) A senior IDF source told A/DATT March 22 that the 
IDF had evidence that Yasin was directly responsible for 
ordering the recent increase in attacks in Gaza and in 
Israel, including those targeting infrastructure, as well as 
the use of women as suicide bombers, with the ultimate goal 
of taking credit for pushing the IDF out of Gaza.  The IDF 
source said the IDF had acted against Yasin in order to stop 
the escalation, prevent Hamas from developing an image as 
successfully forcing Israel out of Gaza, and to ensure that 
Hamas would not become the preeminent power in Gaza after 
Israel withdraws. 
 
4.  (SBU) Following the attack, the IDF completely closed the 
Gaza Strip and closed traffic through the main internal 
checkpoints in the middle of the Strip.  In Gaza City, at 
1000 hours an estimated 40,000 people were waiting outside 
the al-Shifa hospital to escort Yasin\'s body to the funeral, 
and flags from all Palestinian organizations were reportedly 
in evidence.  By 1300, the crowd in Gaza City had swelled to 
an estimated several hundred thousand and eyewitnesses said 
the procession stretched over four kilometers down the 
four-lane Omar al-Muktar street, from Palestine Square to 
al-Nasser Street.  One contact noted the absence of any PA 
security officials on the streets in Gaza City, ostensibly to 
avoid any possible confrontations with mourners or Hamas 
militants.  PA security officers did, however, join the 
funeral procession as an honor guard. 
 
5.  (SBU) Immediately following the attack, Hamas official 
Ismail Haniyah said that \"Sharon has opened the gates of 
Hell, and nothing will stop us from cutting off his 
(Sharon\'s) head.\"  When asked in an interview with al-Jazeera 
whether a response to Yasin\'s killing was imminent, Abd 
al-Aziz Rantisi responded that the \"Izzadin al-Qassam 
Brigades (militant wing of Hamas) will decide,\" but that 
Hamas action was not merely a response, but the \"beginning of 
the battle.\"  In Gaza, one militant announced that \"a new 
Intifada begins today.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
PA Statements Denounce Attack, Call for Unity 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) There has been an immense outpouring of grief and 
anger throughout the territories.  In the official PA 
statement, PA Chairman Yasir Arafat condemned the 
assassination and called on Palestinians to close ranks and 
show strength and unity.  Arafat ordered three days of 
national mourning in the West Bank and Gaza in honor of 
Yasin.  PA Prime Minister Ahmad Quraya, echoed the thoughts, 
adding that the assassination would &escalate the 
operations, which ) with regret ) Israel plans for.8 
Quraya, appealed to the Quartet and the USG to intervene, 
arguing there had been &enough disregard for Palestinian 
blood.8  PA Foreign Minister Nabil Sha,ath said &there is 
no struggle between Fatah and Hamas.  Shaykh Ahmad Yasin is 
respected by every Fatah member....\"  All three statements 
referred to the Yasin assassination as crossing &all red 
lines.8 
 
------------ 
Inside Hamas 
------------ 
 
7.  (C) Among Gaza contacts, Abd al-Aziz Rantisi is viewed as 
a possible interim leader of Hamas, at least in the short 
term.  According to Hamas-affiliated journalist Ghazi Hamad, 
the organization will convene a consultative council in the 
coming weeks to choose a new permanent leader.  He opined, 
however, that in the nearer term, the focus will remain on 
immediate retaliation for Yasin\'s death, a position borne out 
by statements from Hamas and other militant leaders 
(Jerusalem septel).  Ha\'aretz columnist and 
Palestinian-watcher Danny Rubenstein opined that Yasin\'s 
death would increase support for Hamas among Palestinians. 
Furthermore, with Yasin\'s death, the possibility that the PA 
would ever try to rein in Hamas was gone as any efforts to 
this end would be viewed as collaboration with Israeli 
security forces. 
 
---------------- 
Israeli Reaction 
---------------- 
 
8.  (C) In meetings March 22 with DOD Under Secretary Dov 
Zakheim, Minister of Defense Shaul Mofaz said that Israel had 
\"done the right thing,\" and would \"continue to fight terror.\" 
 He referred to Shaykh Yasin as \"the Palestinians\' bin 
Laden.\"  Deputy PM Ehud Olmert, however, noted to Zakheim in 
a separate meeting that Yasin\'s killing could make it more 
difficult to carry out the coordination with the PA necessary 
ahead of the planned withdrawal.  Opposition MK Efraim Sneh 
had a different take, telling Zakheim that Yasin\'s 
assassination was \"not a clever move\", because it will 
accelerate the ongoing power shift in Gaza further in favor 
of Hamas and away from the PA now that people have more 
sympathy for Hamas.  Sneh further claimed that the Sharon 
government was \"doing nothing\" to encourage moderate 
Palestinians to take over in Gaza and opined that, had the 
GOI done more to bolster Abu Mazen, there could have been a 
\"sea change\" in Gaza for the better. 
 
9.  (SBU) Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu (Likud) said in 
an interview with Israel Radio March 22 that the IDF action 
would make it clear that there is \"no immunity for terror.\" 
While acknowledging that there could be an upsurge in 
terrorism in response, Netanyahu stressed that in the long 
term, the effect would be to rein in Hamas.  Minister of 
Agriculture, and fellow Likud member, Yisrael Katz said that 
the IDF action rehabilitated Israel\'s deterrent capability. 
NRP MK Gila Finkelstein agreed that Yasin had been a \"marked 
man,\" but only regretted that his elimination had to be 
linked with the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. 
 
10.  (SBU) However, support was not universal within the GOI. 
 Minister of Interior Avraham Poraz (Shinui) said in an 
interview with Israeli media March 22 that he had opposed the 
cabinet decision to target Hamas leaders because such action 
was likely to increase terrorism inside Israel, a view also 
held by Yossi Beilin, head of the newly formed Yachad Party 
and architect of the Geneva Accords.  Calling the policy of 
targeted killings \"neither legitimate nor effective,\" Beilin 
asserted that the policy has not eliminated terrorism but has 
instead cost hundreds of lives.  Meretz MK Yossi Sarid 
agreed, saying that killing Yasin would only escalate the 
violence.  Israeli Arab MK Ahmad Tibi called Yasin\'s killing 
\"madness\", while Hadash MK Mohammad Barakeh said in a 
statement to the press that the GOI had turned into \"a wild 
gang which is exposing Israel to frightening terrorism.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Attack Prompts Clashes in the WB, East Jerusalem and in Gaza 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
11.  (SBU) Hours after the assassination, Israeli troops 
killed one Palestinian and injured seven others during 
clashes in the Balata refugee camp.  A Palestinian journalist 
covering the clashes was also killed.  Near Rachel\'s Tomb in 
Bethlehem, three Palestinians were injured, one of them 
seriously, when the IDF fired on protesters who reportedly 
threw Molotov cocktails at the troops.  At least 14 
Palestinians were injured in clashes with the IDF in Halhul 
and Hebron, and several shooting attacks at IDF targets were 
reported in Hebron, Nablus, and near Bethlehem.  Clashes also 
broke out between Palestinians and Israeli police near 
Damascus Gate and the Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem. 
Inside the Old City of Jerusalem, a group of Palestinians 
attacked an Israeli youth; three of the attackers were 
arrested.  No injuries were reported in any of the Jerusalem 
events. 
12.  (SBU) All schools were closed in the West Bank, Gaza, 
and East Jerusalem after the assassination, in accordance 
with the three-day mourning period announced by Arafat. 
Roughly 3,500 Palestinians gathered in Nablus and about 1,000 
Palestinians assembled in central Ramallah to protest the 
assassination.  Hundreds of Palestinians demonstrated in 
Tulkarem and Qalqilya.  Several wake houses were opened 
throughout the West Bank and Gaza to mourn Yasin, with Arafat 
announcing that he would receive condolences in his office 
from 1800-2000 hours. 
 
13.  (SBU) During clashes with the IDF in Khan Yunis, two 
Palestinians were killed and five others were wounded, and 
four Palestinians were injured in similar clashes in Abu 
Khouli.  Palestinians also fired anti-tank missiles and 
mortars on settlements in Gush Katif, and a missile was fired 
at the Erez Crossing.  No injuries were reported in either 
incident.  In Rafah, some 25,000 people demonstrated on the 
main street, as Hamas leaders there called for a \"military 
show of strength.\" 
 
----------------------------- 
Hamas Points a Finger At U.S. 
----------------------------- 
 
14.  (SBU) In a statement March 22 and posted on the AFP 
website, the al-Qassam Brigades  blamed the USG for Yasin,s 
assassination, saying &The Zionists did not take such a step 
without the approval of the terrorist US Administration. 
Therefore, it should bear responsibility for this crime.8 
Hamas leader Abd al-Aziz Rantisi added that &the Islamic 
nation should wake up and shake the land under the feet of 
those Zionists and those who back them from the Americans.8 
Islamic Jihad leader Ramadan Shallah referred repeatedly to 
the &U.S. missiles8 used in the attack.

SUBJECT:  GUSH KATIF VISA APPLICANTS EXPECT PROTESTS AGAINST 
PM\'S DISENGAGEMENT PLAN, RESISTANCE IN THE \"UNLIKELY\" EVENT 
OF AN EVACUATION 
 
 
1.  Summary.  In February, Conoff interviewed three visa 
applicants from the Gush Katif settlement bloc who shared 
their views on PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan.  The settlers 
said they expected Gush Katif residents to oppose the PM\'s 
plan through both legal and political channels.  One 
applicant, a 19 year-old woman, reported a prevailing 
inclination among Gush Katif settlers to resist any 
government evacuation of the settlement, while the other two 
applicants, a middle aged couple, asserted that they would 
personally abide by a government order to vacate Gush Katif. 
The 19 year-old woman related that the consensus in Gush 
Katif is that no government will ever remove the Gaza 
settlements.  End Summary. 
 
2.  The first two applicants, a middle-aged couple 
originally from South Africa who associate with the National 
Religious Party, moved to Gush Katif in 1977 because, in 
their words, they felt \"Jews should live everywhere in Eretz 
Yisrael\" and they \"wanted to build something new.\"  They 
also mentioned that the government\'s financial incentives at 
the time encouraged them to move.  The couple stated that 
they would certainly abide by any government order to vacate 
Gush Katif.  They said, however, that they would use all 
legal means at their disposal to protest the Prime 
Minister\'s initiative.  They opined that clearing Gaza of 
settlements would not improve Israel\'s security because of 
what they termed, \"a worldwide Muslim problem\" regarding 
terrorism. 
 
3.  The third applicant, a 19-year old woman born and raised 
in Gush Katif who also associates with the National 
Religious Party, reported that the consensus in Gush Katif 
is that no government will ever remove the Gaza settlements. 
According to her, the settlers claim the government has been 
making idle threats to remove them from Gush Katif since 
1978.  Her parents moved to Gush Katif for religious and 
nationalist reasons in 1977, believing that Gaza is part of 
\"The Greater Land of Israel\" and therefore belongs to them. 
They own greenhouses in Gush Katif and make their living in 
agriculture. 
 
4.  The applicant stated that the prevailing view in Gush 
Katif is that in the current environment, the settlers 
should oppose the PM\'s plan through political pressure to 
show the government that the Gaza settlers will not submit 
easily to an evacuation.  She stated that if the government 
does move to evacuate Gush Katif, an event the settlers deem 
extremely unlikely, they expect to practice the type of 
resistance used at Yamit in the Sinai in 1982.  According to 
her, the Gush Katif settlers believe that if they make it 
difficult for the government to evacuate their settlement, 
then the government would be loath to remove other 
settlements.  She reported that in the unlikely event of an 
evacuation, her parents would expect financial compensation 
from the government, as their livelihood depends entirely on 
their greenhouses in the settlement.  As for herself, she 
expects that the PM\'s disengagement plan will ultimately be 
inconsequential and that she will settle in Gush Katif when 
she marries to raise her own children there.

Key stories in the media:

Jerusalem Post quoted a senior official in FM Silvan 
Shalom\'s delegation in Washington as saying Monday that 
PM Sharon is tentatively scheduled to visit Washington 
on April 14 to present his plan for unilateral 
separation from the Palestinians. 
 
The assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin 
on Monday and its possible repercussions dominate the 
media today.  All media quoted PM Sharon as saying 
before the Likud Knesset faction: \"Israel has struck 
the foremost Palestinian murderer and terrorist.\" 
Israel Radio reported that the participants of a 
defense establishment meeting convened by Defense 
Minister Shaul Mofaz defined Hamas as a \"strategic 
enemy that must be eliminated.\"  Leading media stressed 
the symbolic character of Yassin\'s killing.  Leading 
media reported that last Tuesday, at the inner security 
cabinet meeting, Shin Bet head Avi Dichter expressed 
reservations about the planned strike on Yassin, saying 
that the GOI should have found an opportunity to 
assassinate the entire Hamas leadership at once.  All 
media quoted Labor Chairman Shimon Peres as saying he 
would have opposed the killing.  Ha\'aretz reported that 
a senior member of the IDF\'s General Staff thrust aside 
criticism of Israel\'s action, saying: \"One could think 
that we killed Martin Luther King.\" 
 
The media cited a leaflet being distributed in the 
territories, which says: \"The earth will tremble under 
the Israelis\' feet.\"   All media quoted Hizbullah 
leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah as saying: \"Sharon has 
opened the gates of hell and nothing will stop us from 
cutting off his head.\"  Hizbullah launched artillery 
fire along the eastern portion (Sheba Farms/Hermon) of 
the Israel-Lebanon border.  Israel Radio reported that 
the IDF\'s northern command decided that, should 
Hizbullah increase its attacks, the IDF would respond. 
All media quoted PA Chairman Yasser Arafat, who 
proclaimed a three-day mourning period in the PA, as 
saying that this was a \"heinous crime\" and a \"cowardly 
act\" that will \"strengthen the national unity among all 
Palestinian factions.\"  Leading media reported that 
groups identified with Al Qaida have made threats on 
Israel and the U.S.  Ha\'aretz reported that, 
immediately after Yassin\'s assassination, the Foreign 
Ministry launched a campaign to draw attention to the 
connections between Hamas and Al Qaida. 
The media reported on axe and knife stabbings in Ramat 
Gan and Jaffa, and Qassam rocket launchings from the 
Gaza Strip at targets in Israel.  The security 
services, including police, went on a high alert and 
are expected to remain so through the Passover holiday 
(mid-April). 
 
While the media underscored National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice\'s repeated statements Monday that 
Hamas is a terrorist organization and that Israel is 
entitled to defend itself (headlines in Ha\'aretz: \"U.S. 
Didn\'t Condemn; the Rest of the World Did\" and Maariv: 
\"America Is Behind Us\"), Israel Radio this morning 
noted that the U.S. Administration \"speaks in two 
voices\": the radio quoted State Department Spokesman 
Richard Boucher as saying that the U.S. was deeply 
troubled by the event in Gaza, which he asserted 
increases tension and does not help efforts to resume 
progress towards peace. 
 
British FM Jack Straw was the Western statesman who 
condemned Israel\'s strike most forcefully (for 
\"unlawful killing\").  The Romanian President canceled 
his visit to Israel.  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
canceled a visit to Israel by Egyptian legislators who 
were supposed to attend a ceremony marking 25 years of 
peace with Israel.  Many Arab states, including Jordan 
and Syria, denounced Israel\'s \"crime.\"   Leading media 
reported that the Monitoring Committee of the Israeli 
Arab Leadership has declared today as a \"national day 
of mourning.\"  Jerusalem Post and Israel Radio reported 
a mourning march will take place in Nazareth this 
afternoon to protest what was described as \"a terrorist 
crime by a sovereign state, more reminiscent of the 
Mafia and gang warfare.\"  Hatzofe reported that Monday 
Deputy Employment, Industry and Trade Minister Michael 
Ratzon (Likud) called on Interior Minister Avraham 
Poraz (Shinui) to revoke the citizenship of any Israeli 
who would mourn Yassin. 
 
Yediot published the results of a Mina Zemach (Dahaf 
Institute) poll conducted Monday: 
-60 percent of Israelis approve Yassin\'s assassination 
(61 percent in a parallel Maariv/New Wave poll); 32 
percent object; 8 percent are undecided. 
-81 percent believe that terrorist attacks will 
increase; 15 percent say that the assassination will 
not influence the situation; 1 percent believe that the 
assassination will reduce the number of terrorist 
attacks; 1 percent are undecided. 
-\"How will the assassination influence terrorist 
attacks in the long term?\"  It will not influence them: 
32 percent; it will reduce them: 32 percent; it will 
increase them: 30 percent; 6 percent are undecided. 
-\"Are you now more concerned that you or your family 
could be harmed by terrorism?\"  No change: 52 percent; 
more concerned: 47 percent; less concerned: 1 percent.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
I.  \"Operation From the Gut\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (March 23): 
\"From a moral standpoint, there was nothing wrong with 
killing Sheikh Yassin.  Every terrorist in the past few 
years who embarked on a suicide-bombing mission carried 
with him Yassin\'s ideology stuffed inside his bomb 
belt.... Did he deserve to die? Of course he did. The 
question is whether we deserve it.  It seems to me that 
there are two governing approaches to security for the 
Israeli government: the one focuses on inflicting pain 
on the other side.  The other focuses on minimizing the 
pain caused to our side.  The fence, for instance, was 
geared to minimize the Israelis\' pain. That is the 
secret of its allure.  The government, which did not 
 
SIPDIS 
want the fence, is building it on a route that inflicts 
pain on tens of thousands of Palestinians.  That pain 
only serves to add fuel to the bonfire of terrorism. 
The result is a fence that undermines itself.  The 
policy of targeted killings, conversely, stems from the 
second approach, the one that derives satisfaction from 
the pain of the other side.... No one in the system, 
not even Sharon, believes that the assassination of the 
sheikh will reduce the scope of terror.  There is no 
strategy here: just bitter frustration and mounting 
difficulty to look the voters in the eye.  Opposite 
that stand the dangers: the fear of a rekindled popular 
uprising.... The fear of a mega-terrorist attack.  The 
fear of a religious, Jewish-Islamic war.  The fear of 
attacks on Jewish communities, from Istanbul to Buenos 
Aires.  Sheikh Yassin bears responsibility for the 
death of hundreds of Jews in his life.  The question 
that ought to trouble us now is how many Jews he will 
kill in his death.\" 
 
II.  \"Assassination and Its Price\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (March 
23): \"The Yassin assassination was justified, no less 
so than American assassinations (which have yet to 
succeed) of Osama bin Laden and his cohorts would be 
justified.  But \'justified\' does not mean necessary and 
wise: to say something is \'permitted\' does not always 
mean that it is \'worthwhile\'.... His activity 
undermined the shared Israeli-Palestinian interest in 
attaining an Israeli majority for the Gaza pullout, and 
transferring the region to orderly PA control. 
Yassin\'s assassination, however, was not a necessity in 
terms of thwarting terror attacks; and a very high 
price is likely to be paid for it.... But the true 
measure of the decision to assassinate Yassin will be 
seen in months to come, after the storms abate: the 
wisdom of Monday\'s assassination is to be measured by 
the extent to which moderates on both sides consolidate 
their positions, and the conflict moves from a stage of 
escalation to one of reconciliation.\" 
 
III.  \"Sharon\'s Order\" 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one 
of popular, pluralist Maariv (March 23): \"With one 
hand, Sharon is dumping the Gaza Strip and throwing it 
over his shoulder, while with the other hand, he plans 
to do what he has tried to do his entire life: instate 
order, usually leading to a great deal of violence.... 
Sharon\'s problem is that generally, it begins like 
this, with small, calculated steps that are successful 
in their own right, with a lot of maps and sketches, 
but it ends in tears, blood, bereavement and a state 
commission of inquiry.  This time, Sharon is convinced 
it won\'t happen to him.  He is determined to return 
home safely, without a commission, with a new order in 
Gaza, perhaps even with a bit of quiet at home.  As of 
Monday, quiet is the thing farthest away in the world.\" 
 
IV.  \"Now Hamas Could Align With Al Qaida\" 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar\'el wrote in 
Ha\'aretz (March 23): \"The immediate danger is that 
Hamas, lacking a clear cut leader, will split into 
factions, as happened to the Muslim Brotherhood in 
Egypt or the Jihad in Algeria, with some of the groups 
aligning with Al Qaida.  Such factions create their own 
ideologies and operations that don\'t necessarily take 
into consideration the local conditions.  Palestinian 
groups have so far been careful to stay clear of 
alignment with Al Qaida. But Monday Abdel Aziz Rantisi 
announced that Hamas had opened a special account with 
Israel, calling the assassination of Yassin a 
declaration of war on Islam.  That will have real 
significance if Hamas decides to turn its back on years 
of strategy and begin operations outside the country, 
striking at Israeli, Jewish or American targets 
overseas.  There are many infrastructures overseas 
ready to cooperate with Hamas and the dilemma for the 
organization now is whether to become part of a global 
organization, which it has so far avoided.  The answer 
apparently depends largely on their assessments on how 
it would affect the Palestinian cause if Palestinian 
terror begins operating overseas again.  And another 
question is if the organization is ready to endanger 
its position in Syria and other countries, by taking 
action internationally to protest the killing of 
Yassin.\" 
 
V.  \"Killing Yassin Saved Sharon\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar opined in Ha\'aretz 
(March 23): \"It is difficult to assume that the 
ramifications of the assassination of Yassin on the 
safety and security of Israeli citizens and on the mood 
and balance of forces in the territories were not taken 
into account by Sharon.  Sharon killed two birds with 
one missile.  First, the execution of Israel\'s most 
hated handicapped person freed Sharon from the image of 
being a defeatist and made him \'Arik, King of Israel,\' 
once again in the Likud Central Committee.  Secondly, 
closer ties between Hamas, Hezbollah and Fatah in Gaza 
are the best proof of all that there is nobody to talk 
to about painful concessions in the West Bank.\" 
 
VI.  \"Targeted Killing of Disengagement\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
Maariv (March 23): \"Sharon is angry with himself.  He 
is distressed by his own current stance -- support for 
the evacuation of all Gaza Strip settlements.  The 
Right views Arik as an ideological deserter.  He no 
longer is \'the settlements\' father\'.  Yassin\'s 
assassination is a compensation for the disengagement 
plan.... The long-term consequence [of Yassin\'s 
assassination] is bad for Israel, because Sharon has 
made the implementation of the disengagement plan 
harder.... The disengagement could bring about a level 
of tense calm in Gaza.... On the other hand, the 
killing of Yassin has intensified another front. 
Despite all denials, there a was a silent understanding 
that the sides refrain from harming the political 
leadership.\" 
 
VII.  \"Our Bin Laden\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 23): \"Ahmed Yassin\'s death is a signal victory 
for Israel and for the war against terrorism.  He was 
the military and spiritual leader of the terror war 
against Israel, just as Osama bin Laden is, or was, the 
military and spiritual leader of the war against the 
West.... We must continue to prove that terror itself 
is futile, not the war against it.... If any government 
in the world knows this, it is the administration of 
President George W. Bush.  Yet the official State 
Department reaction was: \'The United States urges all 
sides to remain calm and exercise restraint\'.... U.S. 
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice did 
subsequently straighten the record somewhat, saying, 
\'Let\'s remember that Hamas is a terrorist organization 
and that Sheik Yassin has himself, personally, we 
believe, been involved in terrorist planning.\'  But why 
was the U.S. State Department so quick to imply that 
Israel and Hamas must both be \'restrained?\'  Is there 
nothing worthy of praise in the elimination of the 
leader of an organization that has murdered numerous 
American citizens and places prominently on the U.S. 
terrorist list?.... Israel has no option of losing this 
war, which is not about territory, but our existence. 
Our options are only to win more quickly, or to prolong 
it through our own ambivalence over whether to fight.\" 
 
VIII.  \"Direct Hit at the Target\" 
Correspondent Efraim Ganor wrote in popular, pluralist 
Russian-language Novosty Nedely (March 23): \"This half- 
paralyzed old man [Sheikh Yassin] was not only a Hamas 
leader, but he also inspired and organized most bloody 
operations carried out by Hamas militants.... Yassin 
never hid his attitude towards Israel; he honestly 
warned that Hamas\'s goal is to build an independent 
Palestine on the ruins of the Zionist state. ... Sheikh 
Yassin not only declared, he also provoked ... he 
practically founded, organized, and pampered a big 
terror organization.   His biography is a 68-year-long 
history of hatred, terror and destruction.... A 
decision regarding the expediency of Sheikh Yassin\'s 
assassination was made quite a while ago ... [as] 
Israel\'s political and security leaders understood very 
well what consequences were to follow.   Current 
comments that Yassin\'s death will bolster terrorism are 
unnecessary.  It was difficult to expect Hamas and the 
other extremists not to use Yassin\'s assassination as a 
reason for bloody actions.  But when Yassin was alive 
they [Hamas] did not treat Israel with excessive 
consideration; so they need no additional causes.\"

REF: TEL AVIV 1742 
 
Classified By: DCM Richard B. LeBaron for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Israel\'s politicians wasted little time in 
taking to the airwaves to defend, or in some cases take issue 
with, the March 22 killing of Hamas spiritual leader Shaykh 
Ahmad Yassin.  Sources in the PM\'s office expressed 
satisfaction with the U.S. response, and an MFA official said 
the assassination presented an opportunity to build up the 
Palestinian Authority, although he could offer nothing 
concrete to support that assertion.  A Gaza settler lobbyist 
reportedly declared the attack a victory over PM Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan.  Average Israelis, meanwhile, are 
preoccupied with their personal safety, fearing an upswing in 
terror attacks.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Predictable Reactions from the Political Establishment 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2. (C) No great surprises emerged in the reactions from 
various Cabinet and Knesset members to the killing.  Those on 
the right end of the political spectrum tended to emphasize 
that Yassin was a legitimate target, and to support the 
calculation that the hit now was appropriate.  Those on the 
left were typically schizophrenic, with some voicing support, 
while others expressed concern about stoking the flames of 
terror.  Listed below are a few representative sound-bites: 
 
-- Finance Minister Netanyahu was quoted on Israel Radio as 
saying that no terrorist enjoys immunity, regardless of his 
status.  He said he believed that over the long term the 
elimination of Yassin would disrupt terrorism and deter 
terror leaders.  He also noted that on his release from 
prison in Israel (which took place under Netenyahu\'s 
premiership in a deal with Jordan), Yassin was cautioned not 
to engage in terrorism, and that in reverting to terror, 
Yassin had become a legitimate target. 
 
-- Deputy Prime Minister and Industry and Trade Minister Ehud 
Olmert defended the decision, while noting that the Yassin 
killing would not necessarily curtail Hamas attempts to 
perpetrate terror. 
 
-- Defense Minister Avraham Mofaz called Yassin a terror 
leader, likening him to Osama Bin Laden.  He said the 
operation (dubbed \"Stick Shift\") was part of the State of 
Israel\'s overall policy on the fight against Hamas, and that 
this fight would continue. 
 
-- Picking up on this theme, NRP MK Gila Finkelstein stated 
publicly that Yassin had been a \"marked man, along with 
Rantisi, Nasrallah, Arafat, and Bin Laden.\" 
 
-- Opinion in the Labor faction was divided:  Opposition 
leader Shimon Peres said the decision to assassinate Yassin 
was a \"mistake.\"  Speaking at a Labor faction meeting, Peres 
questioned the wisdom of assassinating leaders who were not 
\"ticking bombs.\"  Noting that leaders can be replaced, he 
expressed the view that the more effective way to combat 
terror is to remove the reasons for terror.\"   He added that 
if he had been a member of the Cabinet, he would have voted 
against the operation.  Meanwhile, MKs Haim Ramon, Benjamin 
Ben-Eliezer, and Danny Yatom (the former head of Mossad) all 
voiced approval for the killing. 
 
-- Interior Minister Poraz (Shinui) told Israel Radio that he 
had opposed the Cabinet decision to target Hamas leaders, 
including Yassin.  He noted that he had warned his Cabinet 
colleagues that such an action was liable to increase 
terrorism. 
 
-- Israeli-Arab MK Ahmed Tibi called the killing of Yassin 
\"madness,\" accusing GOI leaders of having become \"arsonists,\" 
thereby exposing the citizens of Israel to harsh reactions. 
 
-- A Labor Party source in the Knesset told the Ambassador 
that an unidentified Gaza settler lobbyist was heard 
declaring victory over PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan 
because, the lobbyist said, the assassination signaled the 
start of a war against Hamas that would supersede the 
disengagement plan. 
 
--------------------------------- 
\"Satisfaction\" with U.S. Response 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Unnamed officials in the PM\'s office were quoted in 
Israeli media as expressing \"satisfaction\" over the U.S. 
response to the attack, pointing out that, unlike the 
Europeans and the UN Secretary-General, the United States had 
not \"condemned\" it.  Israel Radio concluded that the U.S. 
Administration was \"speaking with two voices\" on the issue, 
pointing out perceived differences between the statements 
made by officials at the White House and at the State 
Department.  The director of the MFA\'s policy planning staff, 
Tzion Evroni, told the Ambassador March 23 that he and his 
staff believe the assassination presents an opportunity to 
build up the Palestinian Authority, but, when pressed for 
details, had nothing to offer in support of that assertion. 
 
---------------------- 
Op-Ed Pages Devoted to 
Weariness, Fearfulness 
---------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Day-after op-ed pieces on the killing, of which 
there are many, all reflect an overwhelming public weariness 
and convey a collective sense of fearfulness, fatigue, and 
fatalism.  For example, commentator Nahum Barnea, writing in 
Yediot, notes the progression of Israel\'s \"targeted killing\" 
policy, which at first was limited to operational leaders and 
\"engineers,\" then political leaders, and now spiritual 
leaders.  He charges that, \"No one in the system, not even 
Sharon, believes that the assassination of the shaykh will 
reduce the scope of terror.  There is no strategy here, just 
bitter frustration and mounting difficulty to look the voters 
in the eye.\"  Asking rhetorically how many Jews Yassin will 
kill in his death, Barnea evokes a number of fears:  \"The 
fear of a rekindled popular uprising of the kind that befell 
us after the Hasmonean tunnel was opened (in 1996) and after 
Sharon ascended the Temple Mount (in 2000).  The fear of a 
mega-terror attack.  The fear of a religious, Jewish-Islamic 
war.  The fear of attacks on Jewish communities, from 
Istanbul to Buenos Aires.\" 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Public Opinion Finds Killing Justified, 
Even While Anticipating Upswing in Terror 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Popular opinion does not lag far behind that of the 
opinion leaders in the press.  A Dachaf Polling Institute 
poll released in Yediot Ahronoth shows that approximately 60 
percent of the public viewed the Yassin killing as justified, 
but only three percent thought it would decrease terror in 
the short term.  A whopping 81 percent of the population 
predicted that terror would increase in the short term, while 
15 percent foresaw no impact.  Asked about the longer-term 
consequences, 32 percent predicted a decrease in terror 
attacks.  A similar pattern is apparent in a Hagal Hadadash 
poll published in Ma\'ariv, which also showed that 43 percent 
of the public would support assassinating Arafat. 
 
6. (C) Anecdotal evidence that Israelis are hunkering down in 
anticipation of Hamas strikes in retaliation for the killing 
was already abundant on the day of the attack.  Indications 
of this trend are mounting on the day after.  For example: 
 
-- A daily commuter between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem told 
poloff that the trip yesterday took twice the usual time, 
since Israelis who normally travel via Route 443, which cuts 
into the West Bank, were afraid to do so.  In addition, 
checkpoints outside all cities slowed incoming traffic. 
 
-- Inner-city roads have been much more congested with 
traffic than usual, suggesting that Israelis who have the 
means to do so are avoiding public transport.  An Israel TV 
Channel 2 reporter conducting \"man-on-the-street\" interviews 
yesterday captured this phenomenon.  A young Israeli woman at 
a bus stop who had not previously heard the news responded to 
the interviewers question, \"They killed Yassin?  Wow!  (Pause 
for thought....)  Then, I\'m taking a cab!\"  The camera showed 
her hailing the first cab that came along and diving into it. 
 
 
-- Demonstrators outside the Defense Ministry\'s Tel Aviv 
compound yesterday gave voice to the public\'s sense of 
vulnerability with signs (in English) reading:  \"Stop Playing 
with Our Lives!\"  This theme was sounded again today as 
protestors at Hebrew University, where Sharon was scheduled 
to meet with new immigrant students, held up a mock roulette 
wheel and changed, \"Sharon is gambling with our lives.\"

ORGANIZE DEMONSTRATION AGAINST YASIN ASSASSINATION 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norm Olsen for reason 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Israeli-Arab politicians rallied some 2,000 
demonstrators in Nazareth March 23 to protest the GOI\'s 
assassination of Hamas leader Yasin.  The Higher Arab 
Monitoring Committee, in conjunction with the more militant 
Islamic Movement, also declared March 23 a day of mourning. 
A Likud MK reportedly has asked the attorney general to bar 
the Nazareth event and to launch a criminal investigation 
against Arab MKs who express support for Yasin.  Embassy 
contacts believe that Israeli Arabs, while sincerely 
disturbed about Yasin\'s assassination, are being stirred up 
by Israeli-Arab leaders.  Police reportedly are concerned 
about spiraling Israeli-Arab violence in the days leading up 
to the March 30 \"Land Day,\" the annual protest against land 
expropriation and general discriminatory treatment of Israeli 
Arabs.  End summary.

Israeli-Arab Politicians Unite to Protest Yasin Killing 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2.  (C) Israeli-Arab politicians and Knesset members have 
uniformly condemned the GOI\'s assassination of Hamas leader 
Shaykh Ahmad Yasin and have cooperated in organizing a 
demonstration during the afternoon of March 23 in the largest 
Israeli-Arab city, Nazareth.  Early media reports estimate 
demonstration numbers around 2,000 persons.  Israel Radio 
reported that someone pushing a wheelchair bearing a picture 
of Yasin led the demonstration.  The Higher Arab Monitoring 
Committee (the Committee), which consists of Israeli-Arab 
political representatives, Knesset members, and Arab 
municipality heads, reportedly agreed to work with the more 
militant Islamic Movement, centered in Umm al-Fahm, to 
organize the demonstration in Nazareth.  According to Jafar 
Farah, director of the Mossawa Advocacy Center for Arab 
Citizens in Israel, Israeli-Arab politicians were pushing for 
the demonstration, something that many in the Israeli-Arab 
community, he believes, may not have strongly supported. 
Farah expressed concern that it may not be wise for Israeli 
Arabs to connect themselves with Hamas.  He added, however, 
that there certainly was \"general frustration in the 
Israeli-Arab street.\"  Farah worried that Umm al-Fahm leaders 
could allow things to get out of control at the 
demonstration.  \"They don\'t have much to lose,\" Farah said of 
the Umm al-Fahm leaders, \"since their main leaders are in 
prison.\"  (Note: Farah was referring to jailed Islamic 
Movement Northern Branch leader Sheikh Ra\'ad Salah and former 
mayor of Umm al-Fahm Suleiman Aghbaria.) 
 
3.  (C) Yair Ettinger, Ha\'aretz reporter on Israeli-Arab 
issues, told poloff on March 23 that the rhetoric among 
Israeli-Arab politicians has grown more \"militant\" in 
response to Yasin\'s assassination.  MKs Talab el-Sana and 
Ahmed Tibi both said publicly that the GOI\'s actions against 
Yasin represented \"insanity.\"  MK el-Sana reportedly canceled 
a March 22 meeting he had scheduled with PM Sharon.  Ettinger 
pointed out that all the Arab parties in the Knesset have 
united around the Yasin issue.  He stressed, however, that 
there has always been a gap between the more moderate 
Israeli-Arab community and its political leaders.  Yair 
questioned whether Israeli Arabs felt comfortable \"standing 
side-by-side with Gaza to protest Yasin\'s death.\"

4.  (SBU) Right-wing Likud MK Gilad Erdan reportedly 
petitioned Attorney General Menachem Mazuz on March 23 to bar 
the Nazareth demonstration and has called for a criminal 
investigation against the leader of the Committee and the 
Arab MKs participating in the demonstration, for expressing 
support for Yasin.  Ha\'aretz reported on March 23 that in a 
letter to the AG, Erdan wrote that \"the Arabs of Israel 
always claim they\'re second class citizens, and today some of 
them are acting as first-class enemies.  This phenomenon must 
be uprooted.\"  In response, The Mossawa Center reportedly 
called on Mazuz to try MKs who incite against Israeli Arabs. 
 
----------------- 
Land Day Protest 
----------------- 
 
5.  (C) The Committee has also announced a general strike in 
the Israeli-Arab community to mark the annual \"Land Day\" on 
March 30.  \"Land Day\" rallies and strikes have been held 
annually to commemorate the March 30, 1976 killing of six 
Israeli Arabs who were protesting the expropriation of 
Arab-owned land in Israel.  Ettinger noted that last year\'s 
Land Day rallies did not draw many people, as Land Day 
occurred during the U.S. war with Iraq.  He predicted a 
larger turnout this year.  Police reportedly are concerned 
that the climate in the Israeli-Arab community is such that 
violence could erupt in the days ahead and especially on Land 
Day.

Canterbury Share Views with Ambassador Kurtzer on Role 
of Alexandria Process in Reducing Violence

1.  Summary:  Lord Carey of Clifton (Former Archbishop 
of Canterbury) and Canon Andrew White met with 
Ambassador March 19 to seek his views on ways they 
could move forward the Alexandria Process Israeli- 
Palestinian religious dialogue in a manner that would 
best support the political track of the peace process. 
Lord Carey noted that his main goal in staying engaged 
in the religious dialogue after leaving his post as 
Archbishop of Canterbury was to keep working to get 
religious leaders here to take a stand against the 
suicide bombings and violence and for peace. 
Ambassador Kurtzer encouraged Lord Carey and Canon 
White and all who accompanied him to keep up that 
effort, which he said was of vital importance to the 
peace process. End summary. 
 
2.  Lord Carey of Clifton (former Archbishop of 
Canterbury), accompanied by Lady Carey, Canon Andrew 
White, and a delegation of mostly American evangelical 
Christian leaders, called on Ambassador Kurtzer March 
19, in a meeting organized by Canon Andrew White and 
his International Centre for Reconciliation (ICR) at 
Coventry Cathedral.  Poloff and PDoff also participated 
in the meeting.  Lord and Lady Carey and their group 
were on a five-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian 
Authority March 17-21 at the ICR\'s initiative for 
meetings with Israeli and Palestinian officials as well 
as western diplomats.  The goal of the visit, and of 
their call on Ambassador Kurtzer, was to learn how 
those involved promoting, executing, or funding high- 
level interfaith dialogue efforts in the Israeli- 
Palestinian context could best support the goals of 
reducing incitement and violence and advancing the 
peace process. 
 
3.  Lord Carey informed the Ambassador that he has 
remained actively engaged in Alexandria Declaration 
implementation (\"the Alexandria Process\") even after 
leaving his post as Archbishop of Canterbury.  Since 
the \"First Alexandria Declaration of the Religious 
Leaders of the Holy Land\" was signed in Egypt by top 
Jewish, Muslim and Christian religious leaders back in 
January 2002, the primary purpose of the follow-on 
\"Alexandria Process\" has been to get the religious 
leader signatories to live up to their commitments, 
especially to get them to \"speak out against suicide 
bombings and violence, and to take an active stand for 
peace,\" in Lord Carey\'s words. 
 
4.  The Ambassador encouraged Canon White and Lord 
Carey and their delegation to keep working toward that 
important goal, even if it means adding new recruits 
one by one to the ranks of those who were \"on message.\" 
Efforts such as those being undertaken through the 
Alexandria Process to get religious leaders to condemn 
and rein in the violence are one of the most important 
of all the auxiliary efforts being carried out by non- 
government actors in support of the peace process, the 
Ambassador noted.  He added that the success of such 
efforts is made even more crucial by the fact that 
there is an increasing danger that the 
Israeli/Palestinian conflict could be moving from being 
a primarily territorial and political conflict, as it 
has traditionally been, to a religious and existential 
conflict - which would be that much harder for 
diplomats and statesmen to resolve. 
 
5.  Canon White briefly summarized the talks held in 
Cairo in January 2004, in which Rabbi Melchior and a 
second Israeli Jewish leader also participated.  He 
asked for the Ambassador\'s advice on what he and others 
involved in promoting religious dialogue in the 
Alexandria Process should focus on next, to best 
support the USG\'s efforts to promote the Roadmap and 
the political track of the peace process.  Ambassador 
Kurtzer said the most important role they could play 
would be to continue to expand the circle of religious 
leaders in the region -- not only senior figures but 
also those at the grassroots level -- who sign up to 
the Alexandria Declaration and support its principles 
of rejecting incitement and violence.  (Text of 
Declaration in Ref C and also on line at

claration.html.) 
6. Note: Ref B (dated December 1, 2003) was a joint 
Consulate General Jerusalem /Embassy Tel Aviv 
recommendation for NEA Multilateral funding for 
projects that would expand Arab and Israeli 
interaction.  At the top of our joint list was an ICR 
grant proposal to advance implementation of the 
Alexandria Declaration.  End note.

Assassination of Hamas Leader Ahmed Yassin 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media continued to lead with the aftermath of Hamas 
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin\'s assassination.  The media 
reported that IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Ya\'alon hinted 
Tuesday that PA Chairman Yasser Arafat and Hizbullah 
Secretary-General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah are next in 
 
SIPDIS 
line. 
 
Leading media quoted President Bush as saying Tuesday 
that Israel has the right to defend itself from terror, 
but that it should keep the consequences of its actions 
in mind.  Jerusalem Post quoted him as saying: \"I worry 
about terrorist groups targeting America.  There are 
still serious threats because of what we stand for. 
There are still people who want to harm our country. 
And so whether it be a Hamas threat or an Al-Qaida 
threat, we take them very seriously.\"  Ha\'aretz and 
Israel Radio note that Tuesday senior White House 
officials, including National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice, altered their responses to the 
assassination.   Speaking on Israel Radio from 
Washington, FM Silvan Shalom minimized the significance 
of that change.  Leading media reported that U.S. State 
Department issued a travel warning for the region. 
 
All media reported that Tuesday Abdel Aziz Rantisi 
became the new \"general commander\" of Hamas, replacing 
Yassin.  Khaled Mashal, who approved Rantisi\'s 
leadership, remains the head of the movement\'s 
political bureau.  Several media reported on possible 
personality conflicts inside the Hamas leadership. 
 
IDF operations in the Gaza Strip: The media reported 
that the IDF is continuing its incursion in the 
northern strip area of Beit Hanoun to prevent further 
Qassam rocket launchings, and that it is operating on 
the outskirts of Khan Yunis.  The media also reported 
that the IDF fired at boats off the Gaza Strip coast. 
Israel Radio reported that last night the IDF killed 
two terrorists who tried to infiltrate the settlement 
of Morag. 
 
All media reported that late Tuesday night IAF warships 
struck at a terrorist squad in south Lebanon close to 
the central portion of the border, after it was spotted 
preparing launchers for firing Katyusha rockets into 
Israel the Lebanese border.  The members of the squad, 
who were killed, apparently were Palestinian members of 
Hizbullah. 
 
Israel Radio reported that, due to U.S. opposition, 
Algeria pulled a resolution draft condemning the 
killing of Yassin, which it had presented to the UN 
Security Council.  The radio quoted U.S. Ambassador to 
the UN John Negroponte as saying that the draft ignores 
terrorist attacks by Hamas. 
PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan: Israel Radio reported 
that the current round of discussions between NSA Rice 
and Sharon\'s envoys Dov Weisglass and Giora Eiland, 
which started Tuesday, will continue today.  Former 
Mossad Director Ephraim Halevy said on Israel TV last 
night that Israel is conducting indirect negotiations 
on Sharon\'s disengagement with the Palestinians through 
the U.S. 
 
All media reported on the 3,000-strong protest march 
held in Nazareth Tuesday to mourn Yassin.  Leading 
media printed pictures and aired footage from the 
event, saying: \"This isn\'t Gaza, but Nazareth.\"  Yediot 
reported that the public address system at the 
demonstration blared a song of praise for Yassin: 
\"Leader of freedom, our sunlight, you are the candle 
that lights our lost way.\"  All media reported on 
clashes in Jerusalem between the police and 
demonstrators who blocked the entrance to the Hebrew 
University\'s main campus when Sharon was addressing 
immigrant students there. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the Finance Ministry told a 
Knesset subcommittee Tuesday that the cost of 
constructing 300 km of the security fence in 2004 is 
estimated at 1.5 billion shekels (approx. USD 333 
million) -- 200 million shekels (approx. USD 44 
million) more than the initial forecast. 
 
Ha\'aretz disclosed details of facts uncovered in an IDF 
military court ruling: Kayes Obeid, the Israeli Arab 
and Hezbollah agent who had collaborated temporarily 
with Elchanan Tenenbaum and helped Hizbullah abduct him 
plotted to abduct other Israelis. Israel Radio and IDF 
Radio reported that two Israeli Arabs from northern 
Israel have been arrested for having allegedly 
conspired to murder soldiers and steal their weapons 
during the month of February. 
 
Yediot reported that branches of the defense 
establishment have decided to modify landing routes at 
Ben Gurion Airport, so that airplanes do not fly too 
close to the West Bank.  The newspaper also reported 
that aircraft will not be allowed to fly over the 
Israeli Arab city of Umm el Fahm. 
 
Leading media reported that Tuesday the High Court of 
Justice upheld an IDF ban on allowing Israeli 
journalists to enter the Gaza Strip following the 
assassination of Yassin.

Assassination of Hamas Leader Ahmed Yassin: 
------------------------------------------- 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized: \"The 
approach that chooses to deal with Palestinian terror 
by assassinating individual leaders, instead of a 
determined effort to reach an agreement with the PA on 
renewing dialogue, is wrongheaded.\" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer Yaron London opined in the 
editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot: \"We [Israelis] were not given any solid or 
clear explanation, and we do not know how the 
assassination fits in with the vision of the political 
arrangement with the Palestinians.\" 
 
Liberal contributor Dr. Gadi Taub wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv: \"The more we [Israel] identify Hamas 
with Al Qaida, the more points Al Qaida gains as an 
Arab liberation movement, a freedom fighting 
organization against the Zionist-American alliance.\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"The condemnation by Arab leaders of Israel\'s pinpoint 
targeting of Hamas godfather Ahmed Yassin sounds like 
an awfully bad joke, which almost beggars [sic] the 
retort of \'look who\'s talking.\'\" 
 
Conservative columnist Avraham Tirosh wrote in Maariv: 
\"In a situation in which you cannot eradicate the 
causes of terror, you should eradicate its leaders, 
whose goal is to eradicate you.\" 
 
Far-left, Arabic-language Al-Ittihad editorialized: 
\"The international community has the duty to pressure 
Sharon\'s government to stop the bloodshed and to save 
the Palestinian people from this colonial occupation.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Deterrence and Horror\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (March 
24): \"Official [Israeli] spokesmen confirm that in the 
short run the assassination [of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin] 
will indeed make Israelis and Jews worldwide more 
vulnerable, but promise that in the short run everyone 
will see that the killing was worthwhile.  That 
assumption rests on very shaky ground.... Last week\'s 
cabinet decision to kill off the Hamas leadership broke 
the rules of the game, and could move the armed 
conflict to areas never seen before.... The approach 
that chooses to deal with Palestinian terror by 
assassinating individual leaders, instead of a 
determined effort to reach an agreement with the PA on 
renewing dialogue, is wrongheaded.... The cabinet 
decision could yet go down a serious negative change of 
direction in the history of the conflict.\" 
 
 
 
 
II.  \"Still, Why Was Yassin Assassinated?\" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer Yaron London opined in the 
editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (March 24): \"And perhaps there is a \'critical 
mass\' of assassination victims, which will cause a 
turnabout?  Certainly.  When we kill all the 
Palestinians, big and small, there will be no one left 
to kill us.  Until then, we can presume that every 
assassination increases the pool of terrorists and 
fuels the murderous rhetoric.  It is true that among 
the educated, largely secular Palestinian elite, voices 
can be heard that show a more sober view, but this 
group, upon which the government has pinned its hopes, 
the group that is the basis for the vision of the 
Geneva plan\'s architects, and with whom Jewish peace 
activists talk, has zero influence on the prevalent 
trend.... The dead Yassin is stronger than the live 
Yassin, and his image as the most senior of Muslim 
saints is already inflaming the imagination of the 
masses and narrowing the freedom of action enjoyed by 
the moderate Palestinian leaders. If the government had 
explained to Israelis sincerely what its considerations 
were before it decided on the strike -- what it feared, 
what it hoped for and what tipped the scales -- we 
would be able to agree or disagree with it, but either 
way we would feel like citizens who are partners to 
deciding their fate.  But we were not given any solid 
or clear explanation, and we do not know how the 
assassination fits in with the vision of the political 
arrangement with the Palestinians, how it will benefit 
our security and what dangers it involves.  In its 
silence and enigmatic talk, the government humiliates 
its citizens and puts them into a fatalistic mood, 
which weakens their staying power.\" 
 
III.  \"We\'ve Gotten the U.S. in Trouble\" 
 
Liberal contributor Dr. Gadi Taub wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (March 24): \"One needs to bear in mind 
that America not only has defined new parameters for 
evil, but also has parameters for good.  Evil changes - 
- once upon a time it was communism, now it is 
terrorism -- but good has remained stable: democracy, 
self-determination and equality.  Things become most 
uncomfortable for the Americans when the definitions of 
evil clash with the definitions of good.... In the long 
run, the last thing they want is for their war on 
terror to be cast as the oppression of national 
liberation movements.  They made every effort to paint 
their war on Saddam Hussein as a war of liberation that 
was being fought in the name of the Iraqis: they do not 
oppress nations in the context of their war on terror, 
they liberate them.  That is the message.  Just like in 
the Cold War.  Israel\'s war on Palestinian terror 
creates a problem here.  It creates a tactical problem 
since the moderate Arab regimes cannot support American 
intervention in the Middle East if it is perceived as 
part of the American support for the oppression of the 
Palestinians.  And it creates a more profound strategic 
problem since it stains Bush\'s war on terror with 
colors of oppression instead of colors of liberation. 
It helps bin Laden turn himself into a liberation 
fighter.  The more we identify Hamas with Al Qaida, the 
more points Al Qaida gains as an Arab liberation 
movement, a freedom fighting organization against the 
Zionist-American alliance.... It is a worldwide 
American interest not to give terrorists an entry card 
into the union of national liberation organizations. 
And we would do well, very well, to steer clear of 
colliding with that interest.\" 
 
IV.  \"Look Who\'s Talking\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 24): \"The condemnation by Arab leaders of 
Israel\'s pinpoint targeting of Hamas godfather Ahmed 
Yassin sounds like an awfully bad joke, which almost 
beggars [sic] the retort of \'look who\'s talking.\' 
Israel\'s critics in the Arab world are the very last 
who should decry action against fundamentalist Islamic 
terrorism.  They know they fear it every bit as much as 
Israel, if not more.... The latest to persecute the 
[Muslim] Brotherhood is Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak, who reacted to Yassin\'s demise by canceling a 
visit of Egyptian legislators to Israel to mark the 
25th anniversary of the peace treaty between the 
countries.  He lashed out at Israel for having 
committed \'a savage act.\'  Yet his repression of the 
still-banned Brotherhood is ongoing.... None of this is 
to suggest that Israel should measure itself by the 
standards of the Arab world.  This record should give 
pause, however, to Western governments that shape their 
own statements to accommodate official Arab anger at 
Israel\'s minimalist act of self-defense.  The Arab 
world has no standing to lecture Israel on human 
rights, the rule of law, or international legitimacy. 
Western governments that ignore this wide disparity, 
and which have long histories of taking similar 
prudent, measured, and reluctant actions against 
terrorism themselves, should spare us their criticism 
as well.\" 
 
V.  \"A Welcome Assassination\" 
 
Conservative columnist Avraham Tirosh wrote in Maariv 
(March 24): \"Shimon Peres said on Monday that the most 
effective solution to terror is to eradicate the causes 
of terror, and not its leaders.  Theoretically, he is 
right.  In practice, in the case of Hamas -- he isn\'t. 
Because the only thing that sparks Hamas terrorism is 
the very existence of Israel in the region, and not the 
occupation of Judea, Samaria and Gaza.  \'Eradicating 
the causes of terror\' in this case means, therefore, 
eradicating the State of Israel.  That, in succinct 
form, was the ideology of the \'spiritual leader,\' 
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.  That, needless to say, is 
something that even Shimon Peres would not agree to. 
Therefore, in a situation in which you cannot eradicate 
the causes of terror, you should eradicate its leaders, 
whose goal is to eradicate you.  Prevent them from 
seizing control of the Palestinian territories so that 
you are left with a chance of engaging in dialogue and 
achieving an agreement.  It is people, like me, who 
support disengagement from Gaza and most of the 
territories in Judea and Samaria, and dialogue with the 
Palestinian Authority, who ought to support the 
elimination of murderous terrorists of Yassin\'s kind, 
who commit criminal acts to prevent any chance of that 
happening.\" 
 
VI.  \"Save the Palestinian People from Massacres and 
Occupation\" 
 
Far-left, Arabic-language Al-Ittihad editorialized 
(March 23): \"The Israeli occupation forces have 
committed an organized terror operation ... missiles 
were shot from an American Apache warship to 
assassinate Hamas\'s leader, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin.... 
This crazy Sharonic escalation will trigger the 
conflict with more fire and violence.... A historic 
responsibility demands serious initiative of the Arab- 
Jewish peace movements to forge unity to restrain the 
occupation government crimes.... The international 
community has the duty to pressure Sharon\'s government 
to stop the bloodshed and to save the Palestinian 
people from this colonial occupation.\"

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Dov Weisglass, senior aide to PM 
Sharon, asked National Security Advisor Condoleezza 
Rice, in talks he held with her over the past two days, 
for U.S. concessions to Israel in return for 
disengagement from the territories.  Israel Radio says 
that the talks have been extended and will continue 
today.  Ha\'aretz reported that Weisglass presented 
Sharon\'s preferred plan: withdrawal from the entire 
Gaza Strip and six settlements in the northern West 
Bank -- Ganim, Kadim, Homesh, Sa-Nur, Mevo Dotan and 
Hermesh.  Ha\'aretz quoted a source in Jerusalem as 
saying Wednesday that these were small settlements 
whose evacuation would provide territorial continuity 
and roads to the Palestinians in a relatively large 
area of the northern West Bank, and that greater 
withdrawal is also expected to lead to greater 
concession from the U.S.  Ha\'aretz recalls that the 
U.S. has asked Israel that disengagement not interfere 
with the \"Bush vision\" for the establishment of a 
Palestinian state, and not be perceived as a \"prize for 
terror.\"  Jerusalem Post quoted diplomatic officials as 
saying Wednesday that the U.S. is unlikely to publicly 
or formally recognize Israel\'s claim to major 
settlement blocs in the West Bank for a Gaza 
withdrawal.  Israel Radio reported that Stephen Hadley 
and Elliott Abrams from the White House and William 
Burns from the State Department will visit Israel next 
week to continue discussions on Sharon\'s disengagement 
plan. 
 
All media highlighted (lead stories in all newspapers 
except Ha\'aretz) the capture Wednesday near Nablus of 
Husam Abdu, the youngest suicide bomber ever to be 
caught.  IDF soldiers held the 14-and-a-half-year-old 
Palestinian at bay at a roadblock (at the same spot 
where an 11-year-old carrying a bag of explosives was 
caught last week), told him to remove his shirt and 
instructed him about how to defuse the explosives belt 
he was carrying.  The boy told the soldiers that Fatah 
militants promised him 70 virgins in paradise and 100 
shekels -- about USD 22 -- for his family in return for 
his blowing himself up.  Israel Radio reported that the 
Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades first claimed and then 
retracted responsibility for the boy\'s action.  Israel 
Radio reported that politicians from across the 
spectrum, including Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres, 
condemned the moral degeneration of the men who sent 
the would-be suicide bomber.  This morning, Israel 
Radio reported that 60 prominent Palestinian public 
figures and intellectuals, including legislator Hanan 
Ashrawi, called on Palestinians, in a paid ad in the PA 
daily Al Ayyam, not to respond to the killing of Sheikh 
Ahmed Yassin, and to abandon the path of violence in 
favor of a political resolution of the conflict. 
However, an Israel Radio commentator noted that there 
is no Arafat associate or influential PA official on 
the list of signatories. 
 
Leading media reported that Wednesday Hamas political 
bureau head Khaled Mashal, who operates from Damascus, 
asserted his primacy over the entire movement. 
Jerusalem Post and other leading media quoted him as 
saying in an interview with the London-based Al-Hayat, 
that his group is planning to assassinate Sharon. 
Leading media reported that Wednesday, in talks with 
reporters, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, the new Hamas leader in 
the Gaza Strip, sought to reassure the U.S. that his 
group would not attack American targets.  He said Hamas 
would not deviate from its long-standing policy of 
confining its attacks to Israel and the territories. 
Leading media quoted PA Chairman Yasser Arafat as 
saying that he is not afraid of the Israeli threats 
that he could be next in line for assassination. 
 
Leading media reported that intensive talks are 
underway among members of the UN Security Council on a 
new resolution on Monday\'s killing of Sheikh Yassin by 
Israel.  Israel Radio reported that the resolution 
draft would include a condemnation of all acts against 
civilians, but predicted that the U.S. would still veto 
it.  The radio reported that Wednesday the Geneva-based 
UN Commission on Human Rights condemned Yassin\'s 
killing by a roll-call vote of 31 in favor, two against 
-- Australia and the U.S. -- and 18 abstentions. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio reported that Wednesday, at a 
meeting with FM Silvan Shalom, UN Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan offered UN assistance to establish law and 
order in the Gaza Strip after Israel withdraws. 
Ha\'aretz reported that Shalom urged Annan to hold a 
meeting at the UN General Assembly for a special debate 
on means to fight terrorism. 
 
Leading media reported that Wednesday the Knesset 
rejected, 44-43, a bill providing that an evacuation of 
settlements require the approval of 61 Knesset members. 
Jerusalem Post notes that Sharon favored the bill. 
 
The media cited statistics presented by police in the 
West Bank: cases of harassment of Palestinians by Jews 
have gradually decreased there after 2001.  The West 
Bank police commander also said that several policemen 
have been forced to move out of the West Bank 
communities they lived in after being threatened by far- 
right Jews. 
Ha\'aretz reported that the committee looking into 
Israel\'s intelligence assessments before the war in 
Iraq criticizes all the intelligence branches for 
erroneous assessments of Iraq\'s non-conventional 
weapons.  However, the newspaper says that the 
committee establishes that the mistakes were not to be 
considered a failure.  Maariv notes that the committee 
justifies the instruction given to Israelis at the 
start of the war that they open their gas mask kits, 
since Israel\'s intelligence branches had no knowledge 
of Iraq\'s WMD capabilities at the time. 
 
All media reported that Wednesday Sharon, at a special 
Knesset session to mark 25 years of peace with Egypt, 
reiterated Israel\'s determination to reach peace with 
its neighbors.  No representatives from Egypt or other 
Arab countries attended the event. 
 
Yediot reported that Turkey has sharply protested to 
Israel about a recent GOI travel warning for Istanbul 
during the Passover holidays (early to mid-April). 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Wednesday 116,000 Internet 
surfers visited a first-of-its-kind website in support 
of the Geneva Accord (\"the first interactive 
demonstration in the world\").  Ha\'aretz doubts whether 
a \"non-virtual\" demonstration would have been as 
successful. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the police and Shin Bet found 
that there are \"black holes\" in the account of freed 
Hizbullah captive Elchanan Tenenbaum, but that there is 
insufficient evidence to recommend canceling the 
immunity deal with him.  The final decision in the 
matter will be made Saturday night at a meeting of 
investigators. 
 
Maariv quoted Seif al-Islam Qadhafi, the son of Libya\'s 
leader Muammar Qadhafi, as telling Qatari reporters 
Tuesday that Libya intends to discuss granting 
compensation to Jews who left his country.  He invited 
them to return to Libya and receive citizenship.

Yediot reported that the Los Angeles-based Simon 
Wiesenthal Center has embarked upon a campaign to free 
12 Iranian Jews who disappeared between 1994 and 1997

Muslim refugee from Iran who came to Israel over three 
years ago has so far been refused residency in the 
country.

I.  \"The Government Against its Citizens\" 
 
Liberal op-ed writer Yael Paz-Melamed commented in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (March 25): \"According to 
extremely detailed reports from cabinet discussions 
before the approval of the assassination [of Sheikh 
Yassin], none of the participants raised the issue of 
tourism, for instance.  Neither did they ask about the 
matter of shopping in the malls, which will be severely 
harmed following the public\'s fear of coming and 
buying.  This is small fry for a cabinet performing as 
an expanded General Staff, without anyone taking care 
of the daily lives of Israel\'s citizens.... This must 
be said: Yassin deserved to die, and no Israeli can 
mourn him.  It is also worthwhile recalling that 60 
percent of the Israeli public approve the 
assassination.  But I\'ll only say that the public hears 
the top military brass repeat at every opportunity 
mantras meant for suckers.  If the public didn\'t 
believe that, there would have been a national unity 
government a long time ago, which would have been 
convinced that Israel\'s good lies not only in military 
victory, which of course is a pseudo-victory.  The 
cabinet that ... discussed and decided to assassinate 
Sheikh Yassin two weeks before Passover [the shopping 
climax of the year] hasn\'t devoted a single thought to 
Israel\'s economic interests.\" 
 
II.  \"Diabolical Act\" 
 
Conservative columnist Avraham Tirosh wrote in Maariv 
(March 25): \"A devil who resides in Nablus, Gaza or 
Damascus, heartless, devoid of any human feeling, 
creates these tools of war.  Small children who are 
walking bombs.... There is not supposed to be any 
connection between a child, any child -- Jew, Arab or 
the son of any other nation -- the symbol of purity and 
wholesomeness, and the devil, the symbol of evil and 
pollution.  But here there is.  A diabolical act.  It 
is a diabolical act because it is inconceivable that we 
are talking about human beings.  It is inconceivable 
that the person who sends children to blow up and to 
become a paste of flesh and blood spread like manure on 
the face of the earth, even for the sake of a cause 
that he perceives to be sacred, is a human being whose 
heart is capable of feeling compassion and love.  Now 
they will say again: \'What do you want from them, from 
those devils, it is all because of the oppressive 
occupation.  That is what forces them to take such 
insane action.  They have no choice.  Their death and 
the death of their children is better than their dismal 
lives.\'  In other words, Israelis are to blame for 
their spilt blood.  There is a border.  A border that, 
whoever crosses it, even in war, even in the midst of a 
struggle that he perceives to be most exalted of all, 
is neither a freedom fighter nor a person fighting for 
liberation and freedom, but a monster, a devil in human 
form, who sacrifices even his own children to the 
Moloch of hatred and insanity.  It lies beyond human 
comprehension.\" 
 
III.  \"An Unconditional Peace\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (March 
25): \"The 25th anniversary of the signing of the peace 
treaty between Israel and Egypt comes at a difficult 
time for both countries.... Even if the model of peace 
with Egypt is not the paradigm dreamed of by its 
signatories, Sadat and Menachem Begin, there is no 
disputing the fact it has become a firm cornerstone of 
reality in the Middle East.  It was almost self-evident 
that Israel would ask Egypt to step in to guard the 
border between Israel and Gaza should Israel withdraw 
from the Strip.  But the importance of the peace goes 
far beyond that.  It proves that even after bitter 
wars, wise, committed and untiring political efforts to 
achieve reconciliation can break the cycle of hostility 
and over time build a proper relationship with Arab 
countries.  This peace, together with the peace with 
Jordan, have become daily evidence that despite 
contradictions and even disputes, the countries of the 
region can live alongside each other with quiet and 
stable neighborliness.\" 
 
IV.  \"Fear and Loathing in Israel\" 
 
Left-leaning contributor Larry Derfner wrote in 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (March 25): 
\"The air force just knocked off Gazan terrorist No. 1, 
and Israelis aren\'t acting very victorious -- they\'re 
afraid to sit in a downtown restaurant again.  When the 
explosions begin, then we\'ll really have fear, agony, 
rage, and of course more escalations, and then nobody 
will be talking anymore about any disengagement plan. 
It will be too late.  I\'m afraid it already is.... The 
missiles they aimed at Yassin also took out the one 
light at the end of the tunnel that\'s shone since this 
war of attrition began -- the hope of getting out of 
Gaza and starting to get out of the West Bank.  It was 
certainly no sin to kill Yassin, but it was reckless 
and self-destructive in the extreme, and who knows how 
many innocents who otherwise would have lived are going 
to get killed for it?\"

\"All Quiet on the Appeasement Front\" 
 
Settler leader Israel Harel wrote in independent, left- 
leaning Ha\'aretz (March 25): \"The denouncements of 
Israel, which boost the confidence of the terrorists, 
will not do the Europeans any good when Al Qaida 
decides their time has come, just as fascism was 
unimpressed by the capitulation to its advances.  After 
all, it was Spain, one of the European countries most 
critical toward Israel, that suffered the worst act of 
terror since the attack on America.  Could there be a 
clearer message than this that there is no hope for 
appeasement?.... Neither the actions nor the failures 
or the U.S. created Al Qaida.  Nor is Western 
civilization to blame that Muslims in Algeria massacre 
whole villages of their coreligionists -- sometimes 
hundreds of souls in a single night --with their women 
and children, and the world remains silent.  The world 
faces a tough, extended and frustrating war against 
this new arch-evil -- terror.  But despite the European 
cowardice -- even betrayal -- the world will win.  In 
this battle Israel, despite the weakness encompassing 
it at times -- the result of the continuous 
psychological warfare being waged against it from 
within and without -- can serve as a beacon to the 
world, lighting the path -- the ethical one, too -- to 
victory.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The jury is out on the economic effect of the 
Yassin killing, but it already appears that tourism is 
taking a significant hit.  While there has been only a 
moderate fall in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), the shekel 
has fallen steadily since Monday morning against the dollar. 
Our personal contacts tell us that Israelis are truly 
worried, and staying home.  So are their overseas relatives, 
who in many cases have cancelled their Passover visits to 
Israel.  If the Palestinian reaction leads to increased 
terror over the longer term, the impact will be even more 
significant.  This reality stands in contrast to Ministry of 
Finance statements arguing that the effects will be minimal. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Tourism: Is the Canary Still Breathing? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Historically, heightened security concerns in Israel 
have hit tourism first and most directly.  Until the 
killing, sector trends were positive:  the Hotel Association 
reported recently that night stays in hotels in February 
2004 were 33% higher than the same month a year ago.  This 
is an impressive increase, even taking into account 
preparations for the Iraq conflict last year.  Right now, 
media commentary indicates that tourism cancellations are 
already notable and increasing, and that a longer-term 
escalation of the security situation could be ruinous. 
 
3.  (U) At first, predictions were not dire.  On Wednesday 
March 24, Rafi Farber, Chairman of the Economic Committee of 
the Hotel Administration, said that there had been no mass 
cancellations, but that new reservations were drying up. 
Just one day later, he told Israeli Army radio that tourist 
agencies around the world were starting to get calls from 
panicked tourist groups canceling their trips to Israel.  As 
for the future, Farber said repercussions from the killing 
could lead to a loss of up to three hundred and fifty 
thousand tourists and losses of half a billion dollars. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Business Conferences On-Track, but Valencia Cancels 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (U) The Yassin killing took place against a background of 
renewed hope in the financial community.  Israeli business 
leaders, who were looking forward to a significant number of 
conferences and delegations scheduled for this spring, are 
closely watching the fate of two back-to-back high- 
tech/venture capital conferences scheduled for next week: 
the Euro Tech Tour, and the Israel Venture Association 
conference.  So far reports indicate cancellations for these 
conferences have been minimal.  Israelis remain on the watch 
of any indication, however, about high-profile, future 
visits.  A Los Angeles Times report on March 24 that the 
security situation in Israel could lead to the cancellation 
of California Governor Schwarzenegger\'s planned trip to 
Israel in early May received prominent press play.  In its 
March 25 edition, Maariv reported that American insurance 
companies were canceling the validity of travel insurance 
policies to Israel.  Israeli commentators noted these 
disturbing facts as they worried that the increase in 
tensions could negatively affect efforts to increase inward 
investment, which is coming just as there is renewed 
interest in the Israeli market. 
 
5.  (SBU) What really got the Israelis\' attention, however, 
was the cancellation of a major, high-profile sports event. 
This was the Spanish club Valencia\'s refusal to come to Tel 
Aviv next week for a Euroleague playoff basketball game, and 
its decision to forfeit the game instead.  Today\'s papers 
gloomily predicted that the Euroleague Final Four set for 
Tel Aviv in late April, one of the biggest sporting events 
in Israel in recent years, would be moved to another 
country.  Estimates of the losses run into millions of 
dollars for this event alone. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Financial Market: So Far, Relative Sobriety 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Foreign exchange and Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) 
participants demonstrated restraint in the first three days 
following the Yassin killing.  The dollar strengthened by a 
fairly minimal 0.58% from NIS 4.483 on Friday, March 18 to 
NIS 4.5090 on Wednesday, March, March 24.  During trading on 
Thursday, the dollar crossed NIS 4.52, the highest level in 
months, but still not significantly outside its recent 
trading range.  The TASE 25 declined 1.8% the day of the 
killing, and a further 2.4% on March 24. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Professional Commentary: A Limited Effect, Provided... 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Professional economists believe the Yassin impact 
will not be severe, provided it does not bring with it a 
long-term increase in terror.  Amir Eisenberg, a capital 
markets analyst for the daily Maariv, claimed March 23 that 
market fluctuations were modest relative to the dramatic 
nature of the assassination.  He predicted that, if there 
were no new surprises, the markets would return to normal 
within a day or two. Dr. Yackov Sheinin, economist from the 
Economic Models consulting firm, and a member of the BOI 
Advisory Committee, was interviewed on the \"Color of Money\" 
radio program on Monday, March 23, regarding implications of 
the Yassin killing on the economy.  Dr. Sheinin indicated 
that there had been \"no hysteria\" in the financial markets 
following the event.  He indicated that the falls on the 
TASE were very moderate compared to the daily declines of 3 
- 5 percent at heightened periods of escalation in the 
security situation during the last three years.  Sheinin\'s 
assessment was that if things return to quiet in 2 to 4 
weeks there should not be any serious implications for the 
economy. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Ministry of Finance Reaction: A One-Time Hit 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) The March 23/24 edition of Globes reported that the 
Ministry of Finance views the impact in terms of a one-time 
hit to the economy.  The action, they believe, will 
minimally impact tourism, investment and private 
consumption.  Over the long term, tourism, investment and 
exports are all expected to increase this year and in 2005. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Comment: Truly Scared Israelis Will Retrench 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) We believe the GOI is generally underestimating 
the short-term economic impact of the Yassin killing.  Many 
of our Israeli colleagues and friends are telling us that, 
truth be told, they are extremely worried about the 
Palestinian reaction to the Yassin action.  Malls and 
restaurants are significantly emptier than usual and the 
word on the street is: stay home and enjoy family during 
this holiday season.  This is sure to impact on consumer 
spending and investment.

SUBJECT: SHARON\'S CABINET SECRETARY DOES THE MATH AND 
FORESEES A NEW COALITION... SOON 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 1741 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
. 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Cabinet Secretary Israel Maimon predicted to 
Ambassador Kurtzer March 23 that the present government would 
not last long.  He cited as evidence of \"the beginning of the 
end\" the Shas-sponsored no-confidence motion the previous day 
-- hastily withdrawn to show solidarity after the Sheikh 
Yasin assassination -- in which a majority of MKs had been 
set to vote against Sharon.  Maimon predicted that with hard 
work, the PM would be able get his disengagement plan 
approved by the Cabinet, but that the approval would provoke 
the departure of the National Union and the National 
Religious Party from the coalition.  Among the Likud Cabinet 
members, Maimon said the PM could count on the support of 
Ministers Olmert, Mofaz, and Ezra.  Ministers Landau, Katz, 
and Hanegbi are all firmly opposed.  Maimon was clearly 
relieved that Finance Minister Netanyahu\'s \"yes, but\" 
approach to the disengagement plan had served to undercut 
would-be Likud rebels.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
\"The Beginning of the End\" 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (C) \"Anyone with any political experience knows this 
government will not last forever....  The break point will be 
when there is a government decision in support of the 
disengagement plan.\"  So said GOI Cabinet Secretary, Israel 
Maimon, in a March 23 meeting with the Ambassador, in which 
he predicted the departure of the National Union and National 
Religious Party as soon as the Government approves the Gaza 
withdrawal plan. 
 
3. (C) Illustrating the point, Maimon cited the \"close call\" 
the previous day in the Knesset, where Sharon had barely 
avoided an embarrassing no-confidence motion introduced by 
Shas.  (Note:  The motion was withdrawn, apparently at the 
request of Likud Whip Gidon Sa\'ar, to show solidarity in the 
aftermath of the killing of Hamas leader Sheikh Yassin.  End 
Note.)  According to Maimon\'s calculations, had the 
resolution not been withdrawn, the vote would have gone 
against Sharon 52-47, with several Likud lawmakers among 
those who would have voted in the majority.  While taking the 
point that this vote would not have jeopardized the Sharon 
government, Maimon nonetheless felt that the experience 
represented \"the beginning of the end\" of the present 
government.  (Note:  To be successful, a no-confidence vote 
must garner at least 61 votes in the 120-member Knesset.  In 
addition, those voting against the PM would have to agree on 
a consensus candidate to replace the PM, something on which 
it is difficult to envision Shas, Meretz, and right-wing MKs 
agreeing.  End Note.)  \"It isn\'t right,\" he said, \"for the 
Prime Minister not to have a majority.  It means the 
government has no right to govern.\" 
 
------------------- 
NRP and NU Want Out 
------------------- 
 
4. (C) On National Union, Maimon cited a conversation he had 
held recently with Tourism Minister Benny Elon, who told him 
that the NU would quit the coalition, even if the 
disengagement plan is Gaza-only.  Maimon confirmed rumors the 
Ambassador had heard that Transportation Minister Avigdor 
\"Yvet\" Lieberman, also of NU, wanted to stay in the 
government as long as possible, however.  Emphasizing the 
confidentiality of his information, Maimon said Lieberman 
 
SIPDIS 
would stay in the government \"until the first bulldozer moves 
in, or the first settler is evacuated.\"  He said there was a 
\"slight chance\" that Lieberman would stay even after such 
moves; indeed it was Maimon\'s judgment that Lieberman, who is 
not an MK, \"would do anything to stay in government.\"  He 
pointed out that this would cause a split in the party, 
however, noting that Israeli law limits the conditions under 
which political parties serving in government can split. 
(Note: If NU decided to leave the government, Lieberman could 
hypothetically remain in his ministerial seat at the 
discretion of the PM.  Lieberman would probably not be able 
to continue representing the NU, unless that party agreed, 
and he could end up without party affiliation.) 
 
5. (C) Turning to the National Religious Party, Maimon noted 
that there are differences between MKs Effi Eitam and Zevulun 
Orlev about how to proceed.  He predicted, however, that, \"In 
the end, all six NRP MKs will be outside government.\"  He 
also wagered that the threshold for the NRP\'s departure would 
be much lower than that of the NU\'s Lieberman. 
 
6. (C) Asked why the right-wing MKs would not choose to stay 
in government, where they would be better positioned to block 
the disengagement plan, Maimon answered that \"This is where 
values come into the equation.\"  Beyond the MKs\' own 
ideological motivations, it would be inconceivable that the 
YESHA (settlers) constituency would allow these ministers to 
remain in government.  Moreover, with the exception of 
Lieberman, these cabinet members would still be able to bring 
their opposition to the Knesset.  Indeed, some of them have 
already been doing so, he said, pointing out that NU MK Arieh 
Eldad had voted against the PM in a no-confidence motion 
earlier in the week. 
 
---------------- 
Likud Head Count 
---------------- 
 
7. (C) Asked about the PM\'s support within the Likud, Maimon 
said that he could at least \"see the horizon\" thanks to the 
\"yes, but\" offered by Finance Minister Netanyahu in response 
to Sharon\'s presentation of his disengagement plans at the 
March 21 Likud faction meeting (reftel reports on that 
faction meeting).  Had Netanyahu instead said \"no, but,\" 
Maimon continued, things would look quite different.  Noting 
that Netanyahu was the second to speak at that session, 
Maimon said Bibi\'s speech \"took the wind out of the sails of 
those who were to speak afterwards.\"  (Note:  Education 
Minister Livnat, who came out against the plan, had spoken 
prior to Netanyahu.  End Note.) 
 
8. (C) Ultimately, Maimon predicted, the PM would have the 
votes he needs from Likud, but he said it would take a great 
deal of pressure -- even if Netanyahu succeeds in securing 
U.S. guarantees on settlement blocs, the right of return, and 
moving the separation barrier.  Ticking through the definite 
\"yes\'s\", he boasted that Minister-Without-Portfolio Gideon 
Ezra could always be counted on to do \"whatever the PM 
wants.\"  He added that Defense Minister Mofaz and Industry 
and Trade Minister Olmert could also be counted on to support 
the PM\'s plan.  He acknowledged, however, that Likud members 
Uzi Landau, Tzachi Hanegbi, and Yisrael Katz were all opposed 
to the plan and that there was \"no chance\" of convincing them 
otherwise.  He did not anticipate that any of them would 
resign, however. 
 
9. (C) Maimon commented that even the \"moderates\" within 
Likud have reservations about unilateral disengagement. 
Minister-Without-Portfolio Sheetrit reportedly told Maimon 
that Israel should receive some benefit for withdrawing from 
Palestinian territories -- preferably from the Palestinians 
or, failing that, from the United States.  In addition, 
without having spoken directly to Immigration and Absorption 
Minister Tzipi Livni, Maimon was convinced that her support 
would be contingent on some kind of trade-off on the right of 
return.  Asked about Foreign Minister Shalom\'s views, Maimon 
pled ignorance. 
 
10. (C) On the subject of Shalom, Maimon took satisfaction 
that, unlike Construction and Housing Minister Effi Eitam, 
the FM toed the PM\'s line on disengagement on his overseas 
trips.  He confided that Sharon had taken Eitam to task for 
his transgressions on this score, albeit without any 
noticeable effect.  Eitam reportedly told Sharon that, absent 
a binding government decision on the issue of disengagement, 
\"everything is fair game,\" a point on which Maimon 
editorialized that Eitam would probably not consider himself 
bound even after a government decision. 
 
------------------------------------- 
\"What are We Going to Do About Arik?\" 
------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Noting that he had been closely watching the body 
language of Sharon\'s Cabinet and Likud faction colleagues 
ever since the PM\'s announcement of his disengagement plan, 
Maimon said it is not only the far Right that no longer 
recognizes Sharon.  The eyes of Likud members \"were literally 
bulging,\" he said, during the PM\'s March 22 speech to the 
faction.  Limor Livnat\'s face, according to Maimon, had \"Who 
IS this guy?\" written all over it.  He had also overheard two 
MKs clucking, \"What are we going to do about Arik?\"

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Yediot reported that Thursday in Washington, the date 
of PM Sharon\'s visit to the U.S. was set as April 14. 
 
Jerusalem Post (lead story) and Ha\'aretz reported that 
Sharon\'s bureau chief Dov Weisglass will return today 
from intensive discussions in Washington about Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan, but without any final U.S. approval 
of the plan.  Ha\'aretz quoted government sources as 
saying that \"Israel did not get the full political 
support\" it sought from the U.S.  Hatzofe reported that 
in a leaflet distributed among Likud members, FM Silvan 
Shalom criticized the disengagement plan, which he says 
will increase Israeli-Palestinian friction. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Israeli defense experts have 
concluded in the last two days that despite the 
intention of Hamas and other groups to exert revenge 
for Israel\'s assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, 
there would be no dramatic change in the number or 
intensity of terrorist attacks.  Maariv reported that 
associates of PA Chairman Yasser Arafat have asked the 
CIA to protect him from Israeli assassination attempts. 
The newspaper reported that the U.S. declined to pledge 
that Israel will not assassinate him.  Ha\'aretz 
succinctly mentioned similar reports. 
 
Leading media reported that Thursday the U.S. vetoed a 
new UN Security Council resolution draft condemning 
Israel for the killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, calling 
the measure \"one-sided\" and saying it ignored the 
group\'s bloody record of terrorism.  Three countries 
abstained -- Germany, the UK and Romania.  Israel Radio 
reported that Russia expressed disappointment over the 
U.S. veto. 
 
Leading media (Yediot\'s lead story) reported that last 
night the IDF killed three Palestinian terrorists who 
tried to infiltrate the Gush Katif (Gaza Strip) 
settlement of Tel Katifa (Maariv: a military outpost in 
the settlement).  They had landed from the 
Mediterranean.  Israel Radio cited the Israel Navy\'s 
surprise ober its inability to prevent the landing. 
Leading media also reported that a terrorist attack was 
thwarted near Emmanuel in the West Bank, and that three 
Israelis were lightly wounded in a stone-throwing 
incident. 
 
Citing Reuters, Ha\'aretz reported that after strongly 
criticizing Israel for Yassin\'s killing, Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak said Thursday that Egypt would 
continue efforts to arrange a meeting between Sharon 
and Palestinian PM Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala). 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post quoted Turkish PM Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan as saying in an interview with the 
Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Thursday that Yassin\'s 
assassination constituted \"terrorism,\" and that he 
could cancel a proposed trip to Jerusalem next month. 
Jerusalem Post reported that sources in Jerusalem 
downplayed remarks by Erdogan (\"Mideast peace has 
suffered a serious wound in this incident.  There is no 
road map left.... I don\'t find such an assassination 
humane.\"), saying that -- if the quotes are accurate -- 
Israel regrets the remarks.  Maariv reported that an 
agricultural delegation of Israeli women participating 
in a Danish-sponsored project in Egypt had to leave 
Cairo because of security concerns. 
 
The media reported that Husam Abdu, the would-be 
suicide bomber apprehended Wednesday near Nablus, is 
not 14, but 16-and-a-half years old.  Ha\'aretz reported 
that military law in the territories does not consider 
him a minor and that the army is considering 
prosecuting him.  All media cited the surprise and 
indignation of his family that terrorist groups used 
him.  However, Hatzofe quoted his mother as saying that 
she would have approved of his act had he been 18. 
 
Yediot reported that following Yassin\'s killing, CNN 
forbade talk show host Larry King, a \"high-priority 
Jewish-American target,\" from visiting Israel.  All 
media reported that Thailand told its citizens in Gush 
Katif to leave the bloc of settlements.  Yediot 
reported that the Philippine government, which will 
send a high-ranking military delegation to Israel, is 
considering evacuating its foreign worker nationals 
from the country. 
 
Leading media reported that elements in the defense 
establishment have warned that Hamas and other 
Palestinian groups intend to assassinate Chief 
Ashkenazi Rabbi Yona Metzger, as well as Rabbi Ovadia 
Yosef and Rabbi Kadoorie, in retaliation for the 
killing of Yassin. 
 
Yediot reported that the special Knesset commission 
investigating the weaknesses of Israel\'s intelligence 
branches at the time of the Iraq War advocates tidying 
up those branches, particularly IDF Intelligence.

                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Shaken to the Core\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Uzi Benziman commented in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (March 26): \"When 
the Israeli reaction to the assassination of Yassin is 
anxiety over what lies in store and dense 
fortifications, it\'s not so easy to be convinced that 
the assassination is contributing to state security.... 
The assassination of Yassin showed how Ariel Sharon is 
capable of undermining the disengagement plan to which 
he is ostensibly committed.  He explained the 
assassination as arising from the need to paralyze 
Hamas\'s ability to sow terror, and to enable the IDF to 
leave the Gaza Strip without leaving behind conditions 
that would facilitate a continuation of terrorist 
attacks.  But at the same time, the action was also 
volatile enough to derail the unilateral withdrawal 
plan -- since the killing of Yassin could easily spawn 
a cycle of actions and reactions that would create a 
situation, or the semblance of one, that would compel 
the IDF to remain in Gaza.\" 
 
II.  \"Why Now?\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (March 26): \"For a split 
second the danger had arisen that a tiny speck of 
sanity had spread over Israel\'s territory.... 
Palestinian terrorism continued with the horrendous 
Ashdod Port murders and the cruel dispatching of 
children who would blow up next to Israelis, which 
spawned proper IDF responses in Nablus and Gaza.  But 
something was in the air.  There was talk of an 
arrangement, of a mini-peace.  Ariel Sharon, Ehud 
Olmert, Shaul Mofaz and Silvan Shalom immediately 
realized the gravity of the situation and brought back 
the enmity of old.... It is not that pinpoint 
assassinations are wrong.  But they should be limited 
to the professional level [i.e. those executing 
attacks].  The killing of the \'Engineer\' [Hamas bomb- 
maker Yihie Ayash] in 1996 was justified, although it 
was followed by a wave of bus bombings.  Raising the 
level of personal strikes to the political leadership 
is a serious mistake, which was meant to serve the 
Prime Minister\'s objective in his party.\" 
 
III.  \"How Serious is Sharon?\" 
 
Ha\'aretz editorialized (March 26): \" If Sharon\'s 
decision rests on security considerations, as he has 
made it clear, every additional day the IDF remains in 
the Strip is superfluous.  One should remember that 
Sharon has not made the disengagement from the Strip 
contingent on the receipt of U.S. aid or approval, 
therefore, there is no need to wait for the U.S. 
position to implement the withdrawal.... [Besides,] on 
Wednesday, Sharon voted in favor of a bill that, if 
passed into law, would require a majority of 61 votes 
in the Knesset to evacuate settlements in the 
territories.  Although one could see Sharon\'s vote as 
an expression of self-confidence that shows he believes 
he will be able to overcome constraints of the law, it 
is impossible not to see his vote as adopting a 
political constraint, albeit a symbolic one.... It is 
difficult to assess the disorder that may ensue if it 
emerges that the plan will not be put into practice due 
to various constraints, from home or abroad.  The fact 
that the plan is unilateral -- a respectable constraint 
in itself -- cannot allow Sharon to hang its non- 
implementation on external (i.e. American or 
Palestinian), political or bureaucratic factors.  The 
public will not accept another empty political promise 
that does move beyond the drawing board.\" 
 
IV.  \"Wanted: a Plan\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 26): \"Say what you want about Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon, he sure knows how to change the subject. 
When it seemed he was about to be indicted, he dropped 
the bombshell of a unilateral dismantling of 
settlements in Gaza.  Then, just as that plan was 
running into increasing resistance within his own 
party, he drops a literal bombshell on Hamas leader 
Ahmed Yassin.  Not that we are suggesting the Prime 
Minister has consciously engineered these diversions, 
but the fact is that this week\'s killing has shifted 
attention from the broader picture, which is not about 
this or that resident of the Gaza Strip, but about the 
Strip itself.... This week\'s killing, having come as an 
isolated shot followed by nothing other than deep 
entrenchment in expectation of retaliatory response, 
only intensified an already strong suspicion that 
Sharon\'s moves are not part of a broad-based and long- 
term plan, but a series of shots from the hip.  The 
situation, not to mention history, demands a lot more 
than that.\" 
 
V.  \"Finally: Soul Searching\" 
 
Regional correspondent Ronni Shaked wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (March 26): 
\"Finally, after three-and-a-half years of continuous 
terror, male and female suicide bombers, and the use of 
children as human bombs, the Palestinians are beginning 
to do some soul-searching.  The problem is that the 
initiative by 70 Palestinian public figures, who 
Thursday called on the Palestinians to stop the terror 
and go for a popular Intifada, came too late.... It is 
also too bad that this initiative came after the 
Palestinian street is already full of hatred.... It is 
also too bad that the petition does not mention the 
moral value of the cessation of the killing: the 
signatories to the public statement call on their 
people to stop the terror in order not to give Sharon 
reasons to continue the fighting, and not in order to 
maintain the value of a human being as such. 
Nonetheless, one should not ignore the courage 
demonstrated by those who initiated the public 
statement.... There is no doubt that one should welcome 
this initiative and encourage the signers to expand 
their number, to address their people directly and tell 
them unhesitatingly: enough of this terror.  The soul 
of the simple person on the street is sick of the 
roadblocks, the suffering, the distress and the terror. 
It is reasonable to assume that the silent majority is 
prepared to accept the new initiative.  The question is 
whether the terror organizations and the leaders of the 
gangs will agree to lay down their arms.  The way 
reality looks today, that seems really far away.\"

the American ultimatum against the \'Axis of Evil\' 
countries.  Qadhafi may have been considered the 
craziest of Arab leaders, but he clearly knows about 
rewards and punishments.  When he understood that his 
involvement in terrorist attacks had gone overboard, he 
renounced terror.... He is demonstrating a perfectly 
pragmatic behavior.  Consequently, Thursday\'s meeting 
constituted the first step toward the renewed 
blossoming of the Libyan economy.... But Tony Blair, 
too, had an interest in this meeting.  He is currently 
under domestic crossfire because of the British army\'s 
involvement in Iraq.  By being the first Western leader 
who extended his hands to Qadhafi, Blair wished to 
prove to his adversaries -- and to the numerous Muslim 
voters in Britain -- that he can not only be a fighter, 
but also a friend when facing the Arab world.\"

1. (C) Summary: In an apparent effort to avoid a repetition 
of the October 2000 police killing of 12 Israeli-Arab 
demonstrators, chief of Israel\'s national police force has 
ordered his forces to refrain from using either live 
ammunition or rubber-coated bullets during the March 30 
Israeli Arab \"Land Day\" events if disturbances erupt. 
Embassy sources speaking to poloff noted positively the 
improved police tactics at the March 23 Nazareth 
demonstration of some 3,000 Israeli Arabs against Shaykh 
Yasin\'s assassination.  According to the director of the 
human rights NGO Mossawa, Israeli-Arab leaders are scheduled 
to meet with Justice Minister Tommy Lapid to discuss general 
follow-up to the recommendations of the Orr Commission, which 
investigated the October 2000 events.  End summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Police Learn from Orr 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Police Inspector-General Shlomo Aharonishky has 
ordered police to refrain from using live ammunition or 
rubber-coated bullets, without his explicit permission, 
during March 30 \"Land Day\" events in Israeli-Arab 
communities, according to March 25 media reports.  \"Land Day\" 
is commemorated annually to mark the March 1976 police 
killing of six Israeli Arabs who were protesting land 
expropriations.  This year, the chairman of the Higher Arab 
Monitoring Committee (ref B), Shauki Khatib, has called for a 
general strike in Israeli-Arab communities to commemorate 
\"Land Day.\"  Marches reportedly will also be held in several 
Arab localities, with a central gathering in the Galilee town 
of Arabeh.  In addition, Israeli-Arab schools will reportedly 
hold classes on GOI house demolitions and land expropriation 
in Israeli-Arab communities (ref C).  Police Chief 
Aharonishky reportedly met March 24 with Israeli-Arab leaders 
to discuss \"Land Day\" activities and acknowledged that the 
Arab public has a legitimate right to protest. 
 
3.  (SBU) The police chief\'s decision to restrict the use of 
lethal and potentially lethal munitions reflects GOI 
sensitivity about its treatment of Israeli-Arab citizens in 
light of the 2003 Orr Commission report, which criticized 
police handling of the October 2000 Israeli-Arab 
demonstrations in which police killed 12 Israeli Arabs.  The 
report criticized then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak and 
then-Minister of Internal Security Shlomo Ben-Ami for their 
handling of the situation and recommended personnel action 
and, in some cases, criminal prosecution of government and 
police officials (ref A).  The report also criticized general 
police practices, such as the use of live ammunition and 
rubber-coated bullets during these demonstrations, and noted 
the historical, societal, and governmental discrimination 
against Arab citizens. 
 
----------------------------- 
Recent Demonstration Peaceful 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Mohammed Zeidan, director of the Arab Association 
for Human Rights, and Jafar Farah, director of the Mossawa 
Advocacy Center for Arab Citizens in Israel, both noted to 
poloff in separate discussions that the March 23 
demonstration in Nazareth against Yasin\'s assassination (ref 
D), which both had attended, was quiet and without incident. 
Zeidan said that police did not enter Nazareth, but waited 
outside the city, thereby avoiding any potential altercations 
with demonstrators.  Farah lauded the immediate intervention 
of several undercover police officers apprehending youths 
who, Farah speculated, had been causing minor disruptions. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Israeli-Arab Representatives to Meet With Lapid 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.  (SBU) Implementation of the Orr Commission 
recommendations remains a work in progress.  On September 14, 
2003 the Government established a ministerial committee -- 
headed by Justice Minister Tommy Lapid -- to advise the 
Government within 60 days on implementation of the Orr 
Commission\'s recommendations (ref B).  According to Mossawa 
Director Farah, that 60-day period has been extended to the 
end of March, and he expects a further 60-day extension 
beyond that. 
 
6.  (C) Farah told poloff that Higher Arab Monitoring 
Committee Chairman Shauki Khatib, Umm al-Fahm Mayor Sheikh 
Hashem Abd al-Rahman, Adalah General Director Hassan Jabareen 
(Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights), and Mossawa 
representatives, will meet with MOJ Tommy Lapid on Sunday, 
March 28 to discuss means of implementing the Orr 
Commission\'s recommendations.  Farah stressed that he and the 
other meeting attendees do not wish to discuss the 
ministerial committee\'s work, but rather how MOJ Lapid can 
lead the Shinui Party to push for better GOI policies towards 
the Israeli-Arab community.  Farah noted that Khatib decided 
not to cooperate with the ministerial committee.  (Note: This 
committee includes two right-wing ministers who voted against 
the Orr Commission\'s recommendations when they were adopted 
by the government, and Khatib referred to this committee at 
the time as \"a means of whitewashing\" those recommendations.) 
 Farah told poloff that Mossawa\'s aim at the meeting was to 
\"convince Lapid to lead Shinui for real change in policy 
regarding Israeli-Arabs.\"

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Saturday evening, Channel 2-TV revealed that State 
Attorney Edna Arbel recommends that PM Sharon and his 
son Gilad be indicted for their involvement in the so- 
called \"Greek island affair\" -- allegedly receiving 
bribes from the businessman David Appel.  The media 
reported that Sunday Arbel passed on her 
recommendations to A/G Menachem Mazuz\'s office.  Mazuz 
reportedly believes that Arbel\'s dossier on Sharon is 
\"problematic.\"  Ministers from every party in the 
coalition were quoted as saying privately that Sharon 
would not be able to remain in power if he is indicted, 
even though the law would not force him to resign. 
 
During the weekend, the media reported that President 
Bush is scheduled to receive Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak on April 12, two days before Sharon, and 
Jordan\'s King Abdullah on April 21. 
 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan: 
-Ha\'aretz (Aluf Benn) cited the draft of a U.S. 
document presented last week to the Israeli delegation 
led by top Sharon aide Dov Weisglass, in which the U.S. 
Administration reportedly refuses to recognize the 
concept of \"settlement blocs\" in the West Bank in 
exchange from Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip 
and some northern West Bank settlements.  Ha\'aretz 
quoted various sources as saying that the U.S. is 
looking into a formula that would not involve an 
Israeli withdrawal to the 1949 armistice lines (the 
\"Green Line\").  The newspaper also cited the sources as 
saying that the U.S. Administration is not prepared to 
declare that Palestinian refugees are only entitled to 
return to a future Palestinian state.  (Maariv filed a 
similar report on Sunday.)  Ha\'aretz further quoted its 
sources as saying that the U.S. Administration has 
presented to Israel three alternatives for a 
\"declaration of exchange\" (in decreasing preference 
order): an exchange of missives between the two 
governments; a declaration by Bush at the conclusion of 
his talks with Sharon; and a joint Bush-Sharon 
declaration.  Sunday, Jerusalem Post quoted senior 
Israeli diplomatic officials as saying nothing in 
Israel\'s disengagement plan will preempt the 
possibility of continuing the road map when the 
Palestinians fulfill their commitments under the map; 
namely, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure. 
-Leading media reported that Sunday, at a meeting of 
the Likud cabinet ministers, FM Silvan Shalom 
criticized Sharon\'s withdrawal plan, telling him that a 
peace agreement should only be reached in agreement 
with the Palestinians, to which Sharon allegedly 
replied: \"You said at the UN that there is a moderate 
partner in the PA.  Tell me, is there anyone to talk 
to?\" 
-Maariv quoted Sharon associates as saying that Gilad 
Sharon is the key promoter of the idea of disengagement 
from the Palestinians. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Egypt is leading an initiative 
designed to create a Palestinian leadership that will 
participate actively in negotiations and play a role in 
implementing the Gaza Strip disengagement plan proposed 
by Sharon.  The newspaper reported that that the 
Egyptian plan will enable the immediate operation of 
the Palestinian security apparatus in the Gaza Strip 
due to Egyptian-Palestinian fears of a Hamas escalation 
in the territories and Israel in the wake of the 
assassination last week of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. 
 
All media reported that the special Knesset committee 
investigating the performance of Israel\'s intelligence 
agencies in the lead-up to the Iraq war and during the 
invasion found that the intelligence establishment\'s 
determinations regarding Saddam Hussein\'s non- 
conventional capabilities and the existence of ground- 
to-ground missiles in Iraq was based largely on 
speculation rather than reliable information.  The 
media cited the committee as warning that the 
intelligence services could once again turn out to be a 
\"broken reed.\"  However, the panel\'s report does not 
recommend action against any individuals. 
 
During the weekend, the media reported that three 
Palestinians were killed in the West Bank Saturday, 
including a seven-year-old boy caught in crossfire 
between IDF soldiers and Palestinian militants. 
 
Sunday, Ha\'aretz reported that Hizbullah financed the 
Ashdod Port bombing and chose the attack\'s target.  The 
newspaper also reported that in order to counter 
Hizbullah influence, PA Chairman Yasser Arafat is 
funding military activists in the Fatah. 
 
Jerusalem Post and other media reported that Sunday 
Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi attacked the U.S. for 
vetoing a UN resolution condemning the killing of his 
predecessor, Ahmed Yassin, and described Bush as an 
enemy of God and Islam. 
 
Jerusalem Post and Israel Radio reported that the Arab 
League will hold its summit in Cairo in mid-April, 
following the cancellation of the meeting it was 
scheduled to hold in Tunis in current days.  In an 
unrelated development, Ha\'aretz reported that Israeli 
Arab politicians and academics will attend the Arab 
League\'s first conference devoted to the Arab minority 
in Israel and its connections to the wider Arab world. 
Ha\'aretz cited the belief of Arab politicians that the 
conference, to be held in Cairo on April 26 and 27, 
will enhance Israeli Arabs\' standing in the world Arab 
community. 
Yediot, Ha\'aretz and Maariv reported that U.S. visa 
procedures for Israelis born in Arab countries have 
been eased.  They will now be asked if they have any 
connection with their birthplace.  If it is determined 
that all connections have been cut and the visa 
applicant is considered loyal to \"Israel only,\" their 
application will be more quickly authorized and their 
visas will be issued at the American missions in Tel 
Aviv or Jerusalem.  Yediot writes that the U.S. 
informed the Israeli Embassy in Washington about this 
change during the weekend. 
 
All media reported that Sunday a ministerial committee 
decided to reform the reserve system in the IDF. 
 
During the weekend, all media reported on worldwide 
demonstrations of Muslims to protest Yassin\'s 
assassination.  Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that 
Hamas and the armed wing of Fatah, Al Aqsa Martyrs 
Brigades, have separately rejected an appeal by a group 
of prominent Palestinians for a \"peaceful\" Intifada and 
vowed to step up their attacks against Israel. 
 
Maariv cited a London Sunday Times story that Libyan 
leader Muammar Qadhafi planned to use a Palestinian 
terrorist squad to hijack a Pan Am airliner and blow it 
up above Tel Aviv in 1986. 
 
All media reported that Sunday NASA launched the X-34A 
plane, which can reach the speed of about 8,000 kph 
(Mach 7). 
 
Sunday, Yediot cited the results of a poll taken in the 
U.S. by Public Opinion Strategies pollster Neil 
Newhouse on behalf of the Foreign Ministry: 
-46 percent of Americans approve Yassin\'s 
assassination; 61 percent approve it when Osama bin 
Laden is mentioned in the same breath; however, 50 
percent of respondents believe that the assassination 
will increase terrorism in the Middle East throughout 
the world. 
-38 percent of Americans believe that the goal of 
Palestinian terrorism is the elimination of Israel; 38 
percent believe that it is more limited: the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited the results of a poll taken 
between March 14 and 17 (before Yassin\'s assassination) 
by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey 
Research among Palestinians, and published Sunday: 
-Nearly three quarters of respondents welcome Sharon\'s 
plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and two thirds 
believe it constitutes a victory for the armed struggle 
against Israel. 
-However, 61 percent of Palestinians believe that 
Sharon is not serious about his plan and that he will 
not withdraw, while only one third believes he is 
serious.

I.  \"Not Above the Law\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 29): \"Leaks from the police and prosecutors 
regarding high-profile political cases have become 
common and acceptable, as if it were an appropriate way 
to release information.... [But] even Ariel Sharon has 
civil rights.  The public has a right not to have its 
government weakened by leaks that unnecessarily prolong 
a period of instability.... On April 14, Sharon is 
scheduled to meet with U.S. President George W. Bush. 
Though the cloud of this scandal is already over 
Sharon, the extent to which an indictment seems likely 
could directly impair Sharon\'s ability to convince the 
U.S. to take specific diplomatic steps critical to our 
national interests.  This is no argument to obstruct a 
legitimate legal process, but another example of the 
cost of illegal and unacceptable leaks from our legal 
guardians.\"

independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (March 28): \"It 
would be best to look at this withdrawal -- which is 
still only on paper -- directly in the eyes.  Israel is 
only leaving Gaza because it can no longer continue to 
hold it due to the defense burden.  Anyone who fears 
the expression \'Israel\'s expulsion\' had better get used 
to it.  Yes, Israel will leave Gaza as one being 
expelled, without any pomp and ceremonies marking the 
transfer of power.  It\'s difficult to find in modern 
history the case of an occupying state that does not 
leave as one being expelled from the territory it 
conquered.  It is not a dishonorable club, with members 
including Britain, France, and the United States.  The 
truly important question is what are the memories that 
Israel will leave behind. These memories will play an 
important role when the time for reconciliation comes. 
But thinking about the future is not a characteristic 
of Israeli policy.  If it were, Gaza would long ago 
have become an autonomous district under the control of 
the Palestinian Authority.\" 
 
III.  \"A Sudden Concern For the Palestinian Child\" 
 
Liberal columnist Gideon Levy wrote in Ha\'aretz (March 
28): \"Suddenly, Israelis are worried about the bitter 
fate of a Palestinian child.  To judge by the public 
shock over Husam Bilal Abdu, who was caught wearing an 
explosives belt at the Hawara checkpoint, it would seem 
that nothing of a humane nature is foreign to us, even 
when it pertains to an enemy and his children.  But 
this is an infuriating show of concern.  The fate of a 
Palestinian child only touches us when it suits us, 
when it serves our purposes and when our hands are not 
involved.  The hundreds of children who have been 
killed, the thousands who have been crippled, and the 
hundreds of thousands who live under conditions of 
siege and poverty, and are exposed every day to 
violence and humiliation -- all this has failed to move 
the Israeli public. Just the child with the belt.... 
Whoever is truly concerned over the fate of Palestinian 
children should not only take interest when explosives 
belts are attached to their bodies.  These children 
deserve a different fate.  They deserve not to grow up 
among the rubble of their homes as children and be 
killed as teenagers -- whether from a Palestinian 
explosives belt or from the bullet of an Israeli 
sniper.  Both of these are cruel to exactly the same 
extent.\" 
IV.  \"No Lost Sleep Over the Postponed Summit\" 
 
Arab affairs commentator Danny Rubinstein wrote in 
Ha\'aretz (March 29): \"One factor that has somewhat 
disrupted preparations for this [Arab League] summit 
was the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.  Most 
Palestinians derived great pleasure from scenes of the 
demonstrations against Israel and the U.S., some of 
them violent, which took place throughout the Arab 
world after Yassin\'s death.  Such demonstrations always 
become protests against rulers of the country in which 
they take place, who are asked to break off any 
contact, direct or indirect, with Israel.  The Prime 
Minister\'s disengagement plan, which confounded the 
Palestinians, is confounding Arab leaders, too.... If 
in the past, Arab summit conferences were a subject 
that sparked excitement and enthusiasm among the 
Palestinian public and its leadership, today\'s summit 
was conceived as a routine, ho-hum event.  Arafat was 
supposed to give one of his ordinary speeches, and the 
Arab spokesmen had prepared a few mutual verbal barbs. 
The Palestinians had few expectations of the summit, 
and no one is losing sleep over its postponement.\"

SUBJECT: SHARON INDICTMENT RECOMMENDATION NO SURPRISE; MOST 
POLITICAL LEADERS KEEPING MUM 
 
REF: A) TEL AVIV 808 B) TEL AVIV 470 C) TEL AVIV 424 
 
Classified By: DCM Richard LeBaron for reasons 1.4 B and D. 
 
1.  (C) Summary: The long-anticipated word this past weekend 
that State Prosecutor Edna Arbel intends to recommend 
indictment of PM Sharon on bribery charges leaves unchanged 
for now the calculus that PM Sharon, if thick-skinned enough, 
can manage his legal and political problems, and remain in 
office (Ref A).  Neither an eventual indictment request by 
the Attorney General, nor the necessary parliamentary waiver 
of Sharon\'s immunity to allow that indictment, are certain, 
and, under existing law, Sharon can remain in office until 
any eventual conviction has been upheld on appeal.  Sharon 
Chief of Staff Dov Weissglas confidently predicted March 28 
that no indictment will come forward.  Further, media 
punditry notwithstanding, the possibility of the Supreme 
Court entertaining a petition forcing Sharon to resign, if 
indicted, is slim.  While a conceivably weakened Sharon could 
try to cut a deal with the Attorney General to resign rather 
than face prosecution of both himself and his son Gilad, both 
Sharons also stand implicated in the so-called Cyril Kern 
bribery affair, in which observers say the corruption 
evidence is even stronger.  Accordingly Sharon would have to 
cut deals in two cases to gain any protection.  Were he to 
either resign or be forced from office, Likud would choose 
from within its ranks a Knesset member -- most likely Bibi 
Netanyahu -- to form and head this or a new government, 
without the need for national elections.  If the indictment 
goes forward, Likud leaders and coalition partners will thus 
have to decide whether they prefer a Gaza-withdrawal-averse 
Netanyahu to a tainted Sharon - not an obvious call for many. 
 In the meantime, Sharon has asserted that if any coalition 
parties quit after his return from Washington later this 
month, he will form a new government \"on the same day.\"  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Most Party Leaders Have Wait-and-See Approach 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) The reportedly unanimous recommendation by State 
Prosecutor Edna Arbel and her team that AG Menahem Mazuz 
indict PM Sharon on bribery charges in the so-called \"Greek 
Island Affair\" has generated media interest but few demands 
from opposition or coalition leaders for PM Sharon to step 
down.  AG Mazuz enjoys a reputation as a big picture guy, and 
one who will demand the strongest evidence before seeking the 
Knesset vote to waive Sharon\'s immunity, which would be 
necessary to pursue an indictment.  With indictment still 
only a possibility, and many tough steps between there and 
conviction, three of 22 other ministers have spoken out. 
Tourism Minister Benny Elon of the National Union party and 
(Shinui) Infrastructure Minister Yosef Paritzky, have called 
for Sharon\'s resignation if he is indicted.  Hard-line Likud 
Minister without Portfolio Uzi Landau called on Sharon, if 
indicted, \"to temporarily suspend himself.\"  Paritzky, 
considered an individualist within his party, does not 
necesssarily reflect his colleagues\' views, and Landau and 
Elon are staunchly against Sharon\'s withdrawal plans.  In 
contrast, the silence from Labor leader Shimon Peres, Shinui 
Party leader and Justice Minister Tommy Lapid, FinMin 
Benyamin Netanyahu and FM Silvan Shalom indicates that it is 
early in the game to be staking out ground.  In each case, 
leaders have to assess whether they can better achieve their 
aims -- both personal and for their parties -- with a tainted 
Sharon or with a likely Netanyahu premiership that would last 
until the next scheduled national elections in either 2006 or 
2007 (Ref A). 
 
3.  (C) With Labor quietly considering a possible unity 
government with Likud if the right wing bolts the coalition 
over Sharon\'s Gaza disengagement plan, it has kept its 
commentary on the indictment low key and restrained.  Labor 
MK Ofir Pines-Paz called on Sharon to \"suspend\" himself until 
the AG reaches a decision.  Labor MK Dalia Itzik, who had 
recently met with Sharon on disengagement, recommended that 
the Labor Party \"wait patiently\" until the AG reaches a 
decision.  Public comments aside, Labor faces the choice of 
either sticking with Sharon in the hope of seeing his Gaza 
withdrawal plan move forward, and possibly getting invited 
into a coalition if and when the rightist parties bolt over 
withdrawal, or dealing with a withdrawal-averse Netanyahu. 
 
4.  (C) Shinui campaigned in the last elections with an 
anti-corruption plank, and Interior Minister Avraham Poraz 
said in January that Sharon would be compelled to resign if 
indicted.  That said, the same \"justice\" campaigning that got 
Shinui elected may equally be turned around to an \"innocent 
until proven guilty\" position in support of a Sharon willing 
to withdraw from Gaza.  Paritzky\'s threat that Shinui would 
leave the coalition rather than serve with an indicted Sharon 
has not been repeated by the party\'s other leaders, although 
one MK made such an assertion to poloff in February. 
Paritzky went so far as to suggest that Shinui should leave 
the coalition even absent an indictment if the evidence 
points to wrongoing.  Justice Minister Tommy Lapid said in 
January that any conclusions would have to be drawn if and 
when an indictment were issued. 
 
 
5.  (C) Shinui could well be replaced on the spot, in any 
event, by the rightist religious parties Shas and United 
Torah Judaism, themselves home to previous corruption 
convictions.  Shas and UTJ would also be available to replace 
National Union and the National Religious Party within the 
coalition, but the latter are unlikely to leave over an 
indictment, preferring instead to save their thunder for 
resignations over Gaza withdrawal.  While inclusion of Shas 
and UTJ would challenge the secularist Shinui\'s continued 
participation in the coalition, Shinui could, in turn, be 
replaced by a Labor party determined to support a Sharon 
withdrawal initiative.  Within Likud, as noted Ref A, the 
gaggle of Sharon successor candidates must evaluate where 
their personal interests lie.  Sharon noted publicly March 29 
that he is prepared to replace on the same day any parties 
that leave the coalition over his withdrawal plan. 
 
---------------------------------- 
How Far to Go in Protecting Gilad? 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) One outstanding issue for Sharon remains the degree 
to which he will make a decision based on the threat to his 
younger son, Gilad.  Gilad\'s high-paid consultancy to 
developer Appel\'s failed Greek island development project is 
being taken as key to the bribery charges against the PM. 
While Sharon enjoys parliamentary immunity, Gilad has no such 
protection.  The degree of his vulnerability to criminal 
charges in the Greek Island affair is uncertain.  Observers 
note, however, that Gilad is also implicated in the so-called 
Cyril Kern affair in which it is alleged illegal 
contributions were funnelled through Sharon\'s Sycamore Farm 
to repay other illegal campaign contributions.  On March 29, 
the Supreme Court ruled that Gilad had to hand over to the 
police all documents and videotapes related to the Appel and 
Kern cases.  Accordingly, Sharon might be prompted as a last 
resort to try to negotiate a withdrawal of indictment in 
return for his resignation, but if observers of the 
respective cases are right, he would need to negotiate for 
both himself and Gilad and for two separate cases. 
 
------------------------------- 
Weissglas Dismisses Indictment 
------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) PM Sharon\'s COS Dov Weissglas told visiting former 
Ambassador and NEA Assistant Secretary Edward Djerejian March 
28 that the those surrounding the PM are confident Sharon 
will not be indicted.  He added that Arbel\'s announcement was 
no surprise.  Other statements coming from the PM\'s office 
echo this view.  Sharon had not issued any statements, but 
the media speculate that he may address Arbel\'s 
recommendation at the Likud Party Convention on March 30, 
where it is anticipated that rank-and-file Likudniks will 
support him, since many view the State Prosecutor as being 
clearly linked to the left. 
 
------------------------- 
Post-Indictment Scenario 
------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Some media reports speculate, however, that Sharon\'s 
Likud and coalition colleagues could exert enough heat to 
force him to resign upon an indictment.  IDF radio reported 
on March 29 that \"senior Likud officials\" will ask Sharon to 
resign if he is indicted.  The broadcast also asserted that 
\"close associates of the prime minister\" are hinting that 
Sharon will not remain at his post if indicted.

BETTER OFF?\" 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Ted Mann per 1.4 b and d 
 
This cable is a joint message from Embassy Tel Aviv and 
Consulate General Jerusalem.  This cable is confidential 
until publication of World Bank Quarterly update. 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Starting in October 2003, the World Bank 
and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) have 
conducted a series of monthly surveys to measure Palestinian 
attitudes and expectations concerning their economic and 
humanitarian circumstances. An average of 1253 households and 
517 businesses have been surveyed over the four months.  The 
most recent survey results available are from January 3 - 26, 
2004.  An advance copy of the January results show that 
Palestinians continue to view each month as \"worse\" than the 
previous month.  Despite this history, they do not expect 
conditions to deteriorate further, but nor do they expect 
them to improve.  Mobility restrictions remain much more 
pronounced in the West Bank (WB) than in Gaza and have a 
differentiated impact in both WB and Gaza.  For example, 
access to elementary school remains good in both WB/G, but 
access to one\'s workplace can be more problematic. 
Palestinian households continue to report that on an 
individual level, the most pressing need is for food 
assistance.  However, their aspiration for their community is 
for more job creation.  Only 14 percent of respondents over 
the four months said they are aware of donor projects to 
address their communities\' needs.  Business owners continue 
to have a conservative outlook on the future, anticipating no 
new hiring, no capital investments, and no increased revenues 
in the near term, leading the World Bank to question the 
prospects of future economic growth.  End Summary. 
 
--------------- 
Quality of Life 
---------------- 
 
2.  (C) Over the past four months, Palestinian households 
have consistently reported that their overall \"quality of 
life\" deteriorated from the previous month.  Despite this 
negative trend, respondents have remained neutral or slightly 
optimistic about the future.  When asked to look forward one 
month, respondents expected life to be either \"unchanged\" or 
\"somewhat better.\"  Jerusalem residents are the most negative 
in assessing their current situation relative to the previous 
month and also the most pessimistic in expectations of future 
improvements.  In the West Bank and Gaza, there has been a 
strong correlation between the assessment of the overall 
quality of life and the degree of Israeli military 
intervention in the area during the particular reporting 
period. 
 
--------------------- 
Movement Restrictions 
--------------------- 
 
3. (C) West Bank households reported an improvement in 
mobility between October and November 2003, but no 
improvements since.  It is important to note that in each of 
the four months, over 50 percent of the West Bank respondents 
reported that their mobility was restricted \"a lot\".  In 
Gaza, on average 30 percent of the respondents said their 
mobility was restricted \"a lot.\"  Mobility restrictions have 
not had a universal impact.  Respondents were asked about 
their ability to access schools, health care, place of 
employment, and agricultural land.  For the most part, 
respondents said their children in both WB and Gaza are able 
to attend elementary and secondary schools without 
difficulty.  Accessing university, which often requires some 
travel, is more problematic, but still does not pose 
overwhelming difficulties for most respondents. 
 
4.  (C)  In Gaza, respondents reported few difficulties in 
accessing health care facilities. In the WB, the results are 
mixed, with residents of Hebron and West Bank villages 
reporting the most difficulty in the January survey. 
Residents of West Bank refugee camps reported the fewest 
problems, most likely due to the existence of UNRWA clinics 
within the camps.  Concerning access to employment, Gazan 
households reported that they have between \"few\" and \"no\" 
problems accessing their workplaces.  In the West Bank, the 
average fell between \"few problems\" and \"difficult\" and 
varied greatly by governant.  For example, in Nablus fully 35 
percent of those with/with jobs said it was \"very difficult\" 
or \"impossible\" to reach their workplace in the January 
survey.  In the WB, there has been a slightly positive trend 
regarding access to agricultural land over the past four 
months.  In Gaza, however, the trend has been negative. 
 
-------------------- 
Expect to get a job? 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) In January\'s survey 26 percent of the WB and 28 
percent of Gaza respondents had no/no employed persons in 
their households during the previous week working either full 
time or part time.  At the same time 57 percent of the WB and 
60 percent of the Gaza households reported that they had no 
family members that were unemployed. Asked about expectations 
of finding work in the next month and over the next six 
months, both WB and Gaza unemployed were neutral saying they 
were \"neither optimistic nor pessimistic\".  These neutral 
expectations have been consistent for all four months of the 
survey.  If, however, the unemployed knew the replies given 
by business owners, perhaps they would be more pessimistic. 
For all four months, both WB and Gazan business owners said 
they did not anticipate hiring new staff in the following 
month.  Asked to project out six months, most WB employers 
still predicted that the employment levels in their companies 
would be \"unchanged.\" Gazan businesses owners were slightly 
more optimistic about increasing hiring in October and 
November 2003, but in the December and January surveys, they 
too said that six months hence they expected their employment 
levels to be \"unchanged.\" 
 
------------------------------------------- 
I Need Food; My community needs employment 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Throughout the Intifada the international community 
has struggled to find the right balance between humanitarian 
responses and long-term development needs.  The World Bank 
surveys pose several questions related to this debate and 
asks participants to rank their most pressing needs as a 
household and as a community.  At the household level, food 
assistance was the need most often selected - it was both the 
number one ranked need (selected by roughly one-third of 
households each month) as well as the item most included 
among household\'s ranking of their top five needs.  However 
at the community level, job creation was the most perceived 
need, selected by a plurality in the WB and an absolute 
majority in Gaza.  Public infrastructure was second to job 
creation and selected as the number one community need by 
roughly one fourth of households in both WB and Gaza.  These 
rankings and shares have remained consistent over the course 
of the four monthly surveys. 
 
Household Number One Need - West Bank/Gaza 
       (January Survey) 
 
Food     35% / 32% 
Clothing       0% /  1% 
Education      8% /  9% 
Employment     16% / 25% 
Financial Assistance       26% / 19% 
Health         8% / 5% 
Housing        6% / 7% 
 
 
Community Number One Need - West Bank/Gaza 
         (January Survey) 
 
Employment    45% / 57% 
Health        13% / 5% 
Food    6% / 5% 
Education     4% / 5% 
*Public Infrastructure    25% / 26% 
No Needs      7% / 1% 
 
* Asked what type of infrastructure they required, Gaza 
residents chose sewage/wastewater disposal as their number 
one need, with roads second.  West Bankers were evenly split 
between roads, health facilities, and sewage/wastewater 
disposal.  In both West Bank and Gaza, answers varied widely 
based on the prevailing conditions within a locality. 
 
----------------------------- 
Most do not know donors exist 
----------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Only 14 percent of households in Gaza and WB said 
they were aware of donor financed projects designed to 
satisfy their communities\' priority needs.  Those households 
who were aware of donor efforts generally expressed 
\"moderate\" levels of satisfaction with donor projects. 
(Comment:  The largest donor contribution - USD 230 million 
in 2003 in PA budgetary support - may be invisible to the 
average household. End Comment.) 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Pal private sector says don\'t count on me 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) Asked about the overall business environment and 
their establishments\' sales, employment levels, profits, and 
costs, business owners/managers continue to report that the 
current period represents a deterioration from the previous 
month.  In January\'s survey, WB business managers in Qalqilya 
governate reported the greatest deterioration relative to the 
previous month; while in Gaza, Rafah establishments reported 
the greatest decline.  Looking forward, businessmen in WB and 
Gaza remain neutral, saying they do not expect their overall 
condition to change in the next month.  Specifically they 
said they did not anticipate increased sales, capital 
expenditures, or employment within the next month, nor within 
the next year.  All of these indicators led the World Bank to 
conclude the \"modest economic recovery witnessed in 2003 may 
have been more along the lines of a partial rebound from the 
severe negative shock of 2002.  But going forward, economic 
growth will be tentative at best, and vulnerable to reversal.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C)  The fact that for each of the four months 
Palestinians have identified food as their most pressing need 
is an indicator of just how bad the economic and humanitarian 
situation is in the territories.  The assessment that each 
month is worse than the last suggests that Palestinians are 
not perceiving any benefit from intermittent Israeli 
initiatives to improve humanitarian conditions.  It is 
worrisome that that only 14 percent of respondents said they 
were aware of donor projects and suggests that the donor 
community needs to do more to publicize its efforts.  Looking 
forward, it remains clear that economic and humanitarian 
conditions will remain dismal absent progress on the 
political/security agenda that would enable greater private 
sector investment and an increased donor focus on long-term 
development needs.   End Comment.

1.  (SBU) Summary: A seven-year-old Palestinian boy was shot 
and killed March 27 in Balata refugee camp during an exchange 
of fire between the IDF and Palestinian gunmen.  Both sides 
claimed that inadvertent fire by the other had killed the 
boy.  A group of Israeli settlers occupied and vandalized a 
school in the Palestinian village of Sawwiya March 26 before 
being removed by Israeli security forces.  Although crossing 
points into the Gaza Strip have been partially re-opened for 
merchants, some goods, and some international staff, 
international agencies have refused to allow their staff to 
cross through Erez on foot, as required by the IDF, citing 
unacceptable security risks to the staff members in the event 
of an attack (see Tel Aviv septel).  A total of 31

-- UNRWA reported that six Palestinians were arrested March 
28 at the Abu Khouli-Gush Katif checkpoint. 
 
9.  (SBU) INCURSIONS/DEMOLITIONS: 
 
-- UNRWA reported that two IDF tanks, two bulldozers and one 
excavator entered the al-Barahma area of Rafah March 27 and 
leveled an area of previously demolished houses.  The IDF 
placed and detonated six explosive charges, reportedly to 
destroy tunnels according to UNRWA.  Two Palestinians, 
including one UNRWA employee who was sitting outside his 
house, were injured in the clashes that broke out as 
Palestinian militants fired small arms and anti-tank missiles 
at the IDF forces, who returned fire. 
 
10.  (SBU) BORDER CROSSINGS/CHECKPOINTS: 
 
-- Route Four (Salahadeen Road), the main north-south traffic 
artery, was open for Palestinians. 
 
-- Erez Crossing was closed to Palestinian laborers March 
27-29, but 59 merchants over 28 years old were able to enter 
Israel March 28.  On March 29, 158 merchants over 28 years 
old entered Israel.  Diplomats in vehicles and internationals 
on foot were allowed to cross on March 27-29, and 
ministerial-level Palestinians were authorized to cross with 
prior coordination with COGAT March 28-29.  International 
agencies refused, effective March 27, to allow international 
staff to cross through Erez on foot, citing unacceptable 
security risks to the staff members in the event of an attack 
(see Tel Aviv septel). 
 
-- The Erez Industrial Zone was open March 28 and 29, with 
3,581 workers entering the Zone on March 28 and 1,782 
entering on March 29. 
 
-- Sufa Crossing was closed for Palestinian laborers March 
27-29, but re-opened for the import into Gaza of aggregates 
used in construction March 28 and 29. 
 
-- Karni Terminal was partially open for the import and 
export of goods into the Gaza Strip March 27-29.  Unpacked 
goods may enter, but no Palestinian containers may enter or 
exit.  UNRWA reported March 29 that this arrangement was only 
barely adequate to the need for commercial goods and 
foodstuff to enter the Gaza Strip.  Sources confirm that 
containers of UNRWA-consigned goods are allowed into Gaza, 
but that the empty containers are not consistently being 
allowed back out.  UNRWA is currently declining to receive 
such containers, claiming that the re-export problems will 
result in UNRWA being charged large demurrage fees for the 
stalled containers (see Tel Aviv septel). 
-- Rafah Terminal was open for Palestinian travelers. 
 
-- Tel al-Sultan checkpoint was open March 27-29 for people 
to cross out of the Gaza Strip.  Toufah checkpoint was open 
for women, children under 12-years-old, and males over 35 
years-old on March 27.  Toufah was closed March 28-29, 
according to UNRWA.

1.  (C) Summary:  Following a series of terrorist attacks at 
or near the Erez crossing between Gaza and Israel, the GOI 
began requiring UN personnel to walk through the crossing 
point. The GOI also restricted movement of all containers at 
Karni crossing following information suggesting that the 
terrorists implicated in the March 14 Ashdod bombing may have 
escaped Gaza in an empty container. UN agencies accepted the 
restrictions begrudgingly and on the condition that the 
measures would be temporary.  On March 26, UN agency heads 
issued a press release stating that the limitations were no 
longer acceptable and might result in the UN having to reduce 
or terminate some critical humanitarian services.  The GOI 
has offered to restore some vehicle access but far short of 
what is needed, according to the UN agencies.  As for food 
access, the GOI is allowing UNRWA food containers in, but no 
empty containers out.  The UN is refusing to import more food 
and risk incurring thousands of dollars in demurrage fees for 
the empty containers.  GOI efforts to resolve these issues 
have been clumsy and ad hoc.  For its part, the UN may have 
overstated the possibility of a food \"crisis\".  Solving these 
problems expeditiously is necessary to ensure uninterrupted 
humanitarian services to the Palestinian population.  End 
Summary and Comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Restrictions at Erez: UN says \"Not going to take it anymore\" 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
2. (C)  On March 26, UN heads of agencies held an emergency 
meeting in Jerusalem where they agreed that they could not 
continue \"business as usual\".  Specifically, they agreed that 
no staff would enter/exit Gaza by foot and that no new 
containers of food would be imported until the GOI had 
demonstrated that empty containers would be allowed to exit 
Gaza.  They further agreed to issue a press release entitled 
\"UN forced to consider humanitarian cut-back in Gaza\" in 
order to put public pressure on the GOI to revert to status 
quo ante in regards to its treatment of UN personnel.  (See 
para. 11 for full text). 
 
3. (C)  UN frustration has been building since the GOI began 
requiring personnel to walk through Erez following the failed 
March 6 terrorist attack at the crossing that caused some 
minor damage to the infrastructure.  This rule has taken on 
various permutations, with personnel sometimes being required 
to use the far more restrictive chute for Palestinian day 
laborers, and other times being allowed to walk through the 
VIP area.  The UN and diplomatic community argued that not 
only did the rule significantly delay personnel, it also put 
staff at serious additional risk by precluding the use of 
armored vehicles and exposing personnel to possible militant 
fire in the \"no-man\'s\" land between Israel and Gaza. On March 
23 (the day after the Yassin killing), the IDF abandoned a UN 
official along with two international journalists and five 
Italian NGO workers in the laborer\'s chute when the crossing 
began to receive mortar shells.  The eight individuals were 
left stuck between two electronic gates for 20 minutes, while 
IDF personnel retreated to their defensive positions.  This 
incident was the \"final straw\" according to UN sources. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
GOI conflicted on how to facilitate humanitarian 
work and guarantee security 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4. (C) There have been a series of meetings, letters and 
phone calls between the diplomatic/relief community and the 
GOI over the past few weeks to discuss Erez restrictions. 
Initially, COGAT intimated that the restrictions were 
temporary and the status quo ante would be restored as soon 
as a security review was complete and the infrastructure 
(gate and road), which had been moderately damaged in the 
March 6 attack, repaired.  As time passed, the GOI restored 
vehicle access to diplomats and a limited number of blue UN 
laissez-passer (UNLP) holders.  As of, March 29, the GOI has 
offered unlimited access for diplomats and red UNLP holders 
and vehicle access for 21 blue UNLP holders who are resident 
in Gaza. 
 
5. (C) The relief community has tentatively rejected this 
offer, though it will not take an official position until 
after the Heads of Agencies meeting scheduled for April 1.  A 
UN official asked \"how can we tell half of the international 
staff that they can drive through Erez, while the other half 
has to walk and be exposed to greater security risk?\" 
Numerous UN colleagues have told embassy staff that they will 
not/not accept a less than comprehensive solution. (Note: 
There are approximately 50 international blue UNLP holders 
resident in Gaza.  A much larger number of international 
staff for the UN and other NGOs are resident in Jerusalem and 
require regular travel to Gaza.  Thus far the GOI has offered 
no dispensation for staff resident in Jerusalem.  End Note.) 
 
6. (C) Daniel Beaudoin, a mid-ranking official in COGAT, 
confided to econoff on March 28 that the GOI was \"struggling\" 
with what to do.  He said that the intelligence services did 
not want any/any cars at Erez and although they knew that the 
chances were slim that a diplomatic or UN car would be 
boobytrapped, they were acting out of \"fear.\"   At a March 23 
meeting, Coordinator for Government Activities General 
Mishlev told the TFPI that he would raise the issue of 
vehicular access with General Harel, IDF Head of Southern 
Command, and report back to the group early the following 
week.  We do not yet have a read-out of that discussion. 
 
------------------------------------ 
UNRWA says won\'t bring in more food 
until container restrictions eased 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) The international community is also concerned over 
problems with food shipments to Gaza.  Karni crossing has 
worked intermittently, at best, over the month of March.  The 
press reported widely that the terrorists who attacked Ashdod 
left Gaza by stowing away in an empty container that passed 
through Karni.  The GOI has not yet officially confirmed 
those reports, but has restricted movements of containers out 
of Gaza in the wake of the attack.  UNRWA reported that it 
currently has 40 empty containers in Gaza that it needs to 
return to Ashdod.  It is charged USD 20/day/container for the 
first ten days as demurrage; thus currently the agency is 
incurring costs of USD 800/day.  After the first ten days, 
the charges increase significantly. 
 
8. (C) Kris Nordahl, UNRWA deputy field representative, told 
econoff that the agency had decided not to import any more 
food until it had concrete proof that empty containers will 
be allowed out.  Nordahl said that for the past three days he 
had been in a \"Kafkaesque\" world where the office of the 
Coordinator for Government Activities (COGAT) tells him he 
has permission to export empty containers, only to be told at 
the crossing that no such permission exists. UNRWA currently 
has 267 containers of food that have been cleared at Ashdod 
and are ready for shipment to/to Gaza.  As of March 26, 
Nordahl said that the GOI is allowing 50 humanitarian 
containers in per day, which Nordahl characterized as 
\"sufficient.\"  However, Nordahl said that UNRWA had \"learned 
the lesson\" of the past of \"trusting\" the GOI and going 
forward with operations, only to be \"stuck\" with costs later 
on.  UNRWA would therefore not/not bring in any new 
containers until it had been \"proven\" that the GOI would let 
empty containers out, he said.  According to Nordahl, there 
is enough food in the warehouse to make distributions through 
this week only.  WFP reported that it was not experiencing 
any problems at Karni because coincidentally it had no 
scheduled shipments.  Genevieve Wills, WFP Gaza director, 
told econoff that the agency has enough food on-hand to make 
distributions through mid-April. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) The primary issue at this point is restoring vehicle 
access for international personnel.  We concur that it is too 
dangerous to walk through Erez crossing and the procedure 
significantly hinders the work of the relief community.  The 
statements about food availability are somewhat misleading 
since technically the UN can/can import containers;  It just 
lacks a guarantee that it will be able to export the empty 
containers.  Last year the UN was stuck with tens of 
thousands of dollars in demurrage fees when unable to export 
empty containers for a sustained period.  Ideally, this issue 
should be resolved and we will not have to see whether the UN 
\"blinks\" and brings in food containers without the desired 
proof that it will be able to get them out.  Meetings 
continue between the GOI and various UN and donor 
interlocutors.  However, thus far, GOI efforts to handle the 
situation have been clumsy and ad hoc.  For example, on March 
28, COGAT officials called UN heads at 08:30 and informed 
them that all international staff could travel freely with 
their vehicles until 12:00 noon that day.  March 29, there 
was no such \"window\".  European Union officials and others 
have said they simply cannot work under such parameters. 
Solving these problems expeditiously is necessary to ensure 
uninterrupted humanitarian services to the Palestinian 
population.  End Comment.

Press Statement 
--------------- 
 
11. (U) (Begin text)  (Title)  UN Forced to Consider 
Humanitarian Cut-Bank in Gaza (Title) 
 
New York and Gaza City, March 26 - The heads of the United 
Nations agencies may have to reduce or terminate some 
critical humanitarian relief operations in Gaza due to new 
movement restrictions imposed on UN personnel and 
humanitarian assistance by the Government of Israel. 
 
For the last three weeks, nearly all UN and other 
humanitarian agency vehicles have been prohibited from 
crossing through the Erez checkpoint.  In addition, the 
movement of food containers through Karni - the only 
commercial crossing point in Gaza - is currently obstructed. 
 
These unacceptable limitations on access for humanitarian 
staff and goods are undermining UN operational capability to 
deliver essential services and food relief to Gaza\'s civilian 
population.  These operations provide more than half of 
Gaza\'s essential social services, as well as food assistance 
to several hundred thousand people.  Any cutbacks will lead 
to a further deterioration of the already fragile 
humanitarian situation in Gaza. 
 
The UN recognizes Israel\'s legitimate security concerns and 
senior officials have repeatedly sought to engage the 
Government of Israel to resolve these concerns, but without 
success.  Because the restrictions persist, the UN is 
compelled to call publicly on the Government of Israel to 
restore full access to Gaza for UN and humanitarian workers 
and goods. 
 
The UN agencies include: 
UNRWA 
WFP 
UNICEF 
UNDP 
WHO 
OCHA 
UNSCO

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media quoted PM Sharon as saying Monday that if 
some coalition partners leave the government when he 
presents his disengagement plan to the cabinet after 
returning from the U.S., he will form a new coalition 
that very day.  Maariv reported that State Attorney 
Edna Arbel\'s recommendation that Sharon be indicted 
frustrated Likud-Labor negotiations for the formation 
of a national unity government, in which six 
portfolios, including the foreign ministry, had 
allegedly been promised to the Labor Party.  Ha\'aretz 
reported that Sharon\'s speech to the Likud convention 
tonight will not mention his legal problems, nor the 
disengagement plan that is creating political problems 
for him.  All media reported that Monday the High Court 
of Justice ordered Sharon\'s son Gilad to hand over 
potentially incriminating documents in two corruption 
probes involving the Sharon family. 
 
Leading media reported that last night FM Silvan Shalom 
affirmed his support for Sharon.  Jerusalem Post and 
Israel Radio quoted Shalom as warning Sharon against 
forming a coalition with the Labor Party.  The radio 
quoted Shalom as saying that the leak of Arbel\'s 
recommendation was \"wicked\" and meant to influence the 
legal process.  Jerusalem Post also reported that 
Shalom slammed Vice PM Ehud Olmert for suggesting that 
Israel should withdraw unilaterally, even without 
receiving U.S. compensation, and quoted Shalom as 
saying: \"Those who are calling for unconditional 
unilateral separation are completely wrong.  The 
Americans have been involved in every diplomatic 
agreement in Israel\'s history and their assistance 
should be welcome.\"  Ha\'aretz quoted Sharon as 
testifying before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee that he agreed to evacuate four 
settlements in the northern West Bank because the quid 
pro quo from the U.S. would be much more \"serious and 
significant\" than if Israel only evacuated the Gaza 
Strip. 
 
Maariv (Ben Caspit) reported that U.S. Ambassador Dan 
Kurtzer has been \"flooded\" by queries from the White 
House, the National Security Council and the State 
Department -- requesting that he try to explain to them 
what Sharon\'s real condition is, whether he is a lame 
duck and, if so, what is the degree of his handicap. 
Yated Ne\'eman quoted MK Nissan Slomiansky, the chairman 
of the coalition\'s National Religious Party, as saying 
that Sharon does not have an option for an alternative 
government.  Ha\'aretz reported that dozens of cabinet 
ministers, Knesset members, local mayors, high-ranking 
IDF officers and other prominent public figures have in 
recent weeks signed a petition called \"A People\'s 
Petition - We Will Be There\" that brands dismantling 
settlements a \"moral, national crime.\" 
Ha\'aretz reported that today Stephen Hadley and Elliott 
Abrams from the White House, and William Burns from the 
State Department, will brief senior European officials 
in Brussels about last week\'s Israeli-American talks in 
Washington over the disengagement plan.  The newspaper 
notes that the three U.S. envoys will then travel to 
Cairo to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, 
followed by a visit to Amman to meet with Jordan\'s King 
Abdullah.  The delegates are slated to meet with Sharon 
in Jerusalem Thursday. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that while the IDF is \"confused\" 
about the disengagement plan, the Palestinians in the 
Gaza Strip are already making practical preparations 
toward an Israeli withdrawal.  Ha\'aretz reported that 
Egypt has mediated a deal to divide responsibilities 
and spheres of influence between Jibril Rajoub, the 
current National Security Advisor to PA Chairman Yasser 
Arafat, and Muhammad Dahlan, former head of the Gazan 
Preventive Security services, as Cairo moves ahead with 
its plan for unified security services in the PA and a 
unified Palestinian leadership to present to the 
Americans. 
 
This morning, Israel Radio reported that the IDF, which 
fears that terrorists could leave Nablus to carry out 
attacks, is encircling the city. 
 
The media reported that the Israeli Arab community will 
commemorate Land Day today, culminating in a protest 
strike and a march in the Galilee -- from the village 
of Arabe to the town of Sakhnin.  Land Day marks the 
28th anniversary of clashes with the police over land 
confiscation, in which six Israeli Arabs were killed. 
 
Aluf Benn of Ha\'aretz reviewed a new book, \"Waging 
Peace: Israel and the Arabs, 1948-2003,\" by Prof. 
Itamar Rabinovich, one-time chief negotiator with Syria 
and former ambassador to the U.S.  Rabinovich writes 
that Arafat is to blame for the failure of the Oslo 
peace process.  However, he says that an interim deal 
can be struck with the Palestinians now -- but only 
with Arafat. 
 
Leading media reported that Monday the Knesset Finance 
Committee approved the cabinet\'s decision to make an 
across-the-board cut of 4.8 billion shekels (around USD 
1.06 billion) in the state budget for 2004. 
 
All media reported that today the police will release 
freed Hizbullah captive Elchanan Tenenbaum and place 
him under house arrest. 
 
In an exclusive Maariv feature, Italian Jew David Gerbi 
describes his recent visit to his native town: Tripoli, 
the Libyan capital. 
 
Yediot reported that 70 supporters of nuclear 
whistleblower Mordecai Vanunu from around the world, 
including the actress Susannah York and Nobel 
Prizewinners, will come to Israel to celebrate his 
release in around three weeks. 
 
Convicted spy Jonathan Pollard was quoted as saying in 
an interview with Maariv that he is entreating Sharon 
to \"come and rescue\" him during his upcoming visit to 
Washington. 
 
Ha\'aretz underscored President Bush\'s statement Monday 
that the seven new members of NATO (Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria) 
\"bring moral clarity to the purposes of our alliance.\" 
 
This morning, Israel Radio reported that a poll 
conducted in the U.S. found that Bush has regained his 
lead over Sen. John Kerry.

I.  \"Israel vs. the Safeguards of Mankind\'s 
Conservation\" 
 
Liberal contributor, Tel Aviv University Prof. Tanya 
Reinhart wrote in mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (March 30): \"Since 9/11, within the context of 
the war against terrorism, the United States has been 
applying pressure to cancel safeguards anchored in 
international law.  But even the U.S. has not yet dared 
execute publicly a spiritual-religious leader (for 
instance, those of the Taliban in Afghanistan).  Now, 
with U.S. blessing, the Israel has established that 
this, too, is allowed.  The rule of the military is 
turning Israel into a leader in the destruction of the 
protections that mankind created for its own 
conservation -- protections that Israel may need 
someday, as already proved by history.\" 
 
II.  \"The Fatah-Hamas Rivalry\" 
 
The Director of the Interdisciplinary Center\'s Global 
Research in International Affairs Center, columnist 
Barry Rubin wrote in conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post (March 30): \"What are the implications 
of Ahmed Yassin\'s death for Palestinian politics?  In 
the short run, it brought sympathy for Hamas from the 
general population.  But this event is unlikely to have 
much lasting impact.  The real issue is the power 
struggle between Fatah and Hamas.... Arafat, as many 
Fatah leaders know, is responsible for the declining 
fortunes of his group as well as of his people. By 
refusing to take strong action against Hamas, stop 
terrorism, and rein in the thuggish activity of 
militias waging battle against Israel, he is 
discrediting the PA, Fatah, and the nationalist 
cause.... But Hamas has its own problems in the pursuit 
of power.  However many terrorist attacks it can mount, 
it is going to be weaker without Yassin.  Hamas is a 
very fragmented organization, with no alternative 
preeminent leader in sight.... While no one should have 
any illusions that Hamas will stop trying to strike 
Israel with terrorism, Rantisi\'s elevation is not going 
to make it a tougher organization.  Speaking of 
Rantisi, let it not pass without notice that when 
Israel tried to kill him, one of the complaints brought 
by foreign politicians and journalists was that he was 
\'only\' Hamas\'s spokesman and not involved in terrorism. 
As has repeatedly happened before, the organization\'s 
own decision shows how naive such distinctions are.\" 
III.  \"Just an Absence of War\" 
 
Hebrew University Professor of Political Science and 
former Foreign Ministry director-general Shlomo Avineri 
wrote in Jerusalem Post (November 26): \"Exactly a 
quarter of a century ago -- in March 1979 -- Israel and 
Egypt signed a peace treaty which put an end to decades 
of war between the two nations.... Yet today relations 
between Israel and Egypt are bitter, and Israelis speak 
of a cold peace.... It now appears that the Egyptian 
strategy has been, from the very beginning, not to move 
toward reconciliation and rapprochement.  The current 
Palestinian Intifada is a mere excuse.  In signing the 
treaty Egypt wanted -- legitimately -- to get back its 
territory, but in return it never aimed at anything 
save a cold peace.... Peace is not just an absence of 
war.  It is a state of mind, a moral disposition, an 
ethical commitment. This is not what the Egyptians were 
seeking.  The cold peace Egypt offered Israel should be 
kept.  One can only wish something similar could be 
achieved with the Palestinians.  Yet, in marking the 
25th anniversary of this agreement, one should realize 
what it is -- and what the Egyptians chose it should 
not be.\" 
 
IV.  \"Vetoes That Serve Terrorism\" 
 
Far-left, Arabic language Al-Ittihad editorialized 
(March 28): \"The U.S. State Department\'s strategic 
planners have put forward an agenda of \'confronting\' 
the sharp increase of hatred felt by the nations of the 
world ... towards American imperialism!  But they 
[American foreign policymakers] didn\'t design policies 
to treat the real reasons for this hatred.... The blood 
of the people in the region, especially Palestinian 
blood, is bleeding because of the American strategic 
aggression that grants unlimited support ... to Israel. 
In addition, the successive U.S. administrations have 
used the [right of] veto at the Security Council to 
protect the Israeli aggressor from any international 
condemnation to stop its crimes.... This American 
position is serving and encouraging barbaric Israeli 
terrorism against the Palestinians.  This was also a 
clear message to the Arab regimes, on the eve of the 
proposed Arab league summit, that the U.S. 
Administration doesn\'t show any consideration for Arab 
leaders.  They [Arab leaders] are nothing but zero.\"

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"There is a network of groups and governments that 
believe in using terror to subjugate the West and make 
the world safe for tyranny.... Intelligence can be a 
critical tool in winning this war, but it cannot tell 
us what the war is about or outline our broad 
strategy.\"

                     ------------- 
 
\"Intelligence\'s Limits\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 30): \"The problem with the concept of 
\'intelligence failure\' is that it presumes that 
intelligence normally succeeds.  If there is any lesson 
from the investigations both here and in the U.S., it 
is that policy makers must assume the structural 
fallibility of their intelligence agencies.... What 
9/11 shows ... is that if intelligence is to mean 
anything it must first have some grasp of the major 
currents sweeping the globe.  Is it surprising that 
Western intelligence services missed 9/11 when they did 
not anticipate the fall of the Soviet Union?.... We 
should keep in mind not what we think we know, but what 
we do know: that there is a network of groups and 
governments that believe in using terror to subjugate 
the West and make the world safe for tyranny.  We know 
they must be beaten, and that the key to beating them 
is to drive a handful of governments out of the terror 
business.  We also know that tyranny and terror are 
inextricably linked, so that a policy of supporting 
Western values of freedom and human rights is also 
necessary to achieve peace and security.  Intelligence 
can be a critical tool in winning this war, but it 
cannot tell us what the war is about or outline our 
broad strategy.\"

YASSIN KILLING WITH USD ZAKHEIM

1. (C) SUMMARY: In meetings that took place in the hours 
following the Sheikh Yassin assassination, USD Dov Zakheim 
discussed the targeted killing and Gaza disengagement with 
Ministers Olmert and Mofaz and MKs Steinetz and Sneh. 
(Selected GOI comments from these meetings reported reftels.) 
 Mofaz defended Yassin\'s killing, and said the GOI would 
continue such operations.  Sneh blasted the operation, which 
he characterized as typical GOI undermining of Palestinian 
moderates.  Mofaz and Olmert both focused on the issue of 
U.S. support for the disengagement plan, with Olmert 
predicting that President Bush would privately hint to Sharon 
that support would come after the U.S. election.  Sneh urged 
the U.S. to withhold its support until Sharon took a number 
of steps, including on settlements and outposts in the West 
Bank.  Steinetz said Sharon would have to refrain from any 
West Bank withdrawals if he hopes to win the support of 
Steinetz and other key Likud members.  Olmert suggested that 
Netanyahu and Shalom would back the PM.  Mofaz thought 
withdrawal would begin around the end of the year and 
continue until summer, 2005.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) Visiting Under Secretary of Defense Dov Zakheim 
discussed Gaza disengagement and the Yassin assassination in 
a series of meetings March 22 with Alternate Prime Minister 
Ehud Olmert, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz, Knesset Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Yuval Steinetz and 
Labor MK Ephraim Sneh.  The Ambassador and/or emboffs 
accompanied Zakheim to the meetings.  (Selected GOI comments 
from these meetings reported reftels.) 
 
-------------------- 
Yassin Assassination 
-------------------- 
 
3. (C) The meetings all took place the morning of Israel\'s 
targeted killing of Hamas leader Sheikh Yassin.  Mofaz 
strongly defended the GOI decision to kill Yassin, and said 
Israel would continue carrying out such operations.  He 
accused Yassin of sending hundreds of suicide bombers to kill 
Israelis and called him \"the Palestinians\' Bin Laden.\"  The 
Ambassador asked Mofaz about the impact the killing might 
have on PM Sharon\'s attempts to get Egypt to play a 
significant role in Gaza withdrawal.  \"We\'re going to fight 
Hamas, in any case,\" Mofaz replied, adding that Egypt even 
before the assassination had been interested only in 
low-level involvement, with no \"responsibility\" for 
Palestinian actions. 
 
4. (C) Sneh, while asserting that Yassin undoubtedly deserved 
his fate, criticized the GOI action, predicting that it would 
accelerate what he said was the movement of PA security force 
members towards the Hamas orbit.  Does the GOI, he asked 
rhetorically, want Hamas to rule Palestine?  An Islamic 
government, he said, would be intolerable, but the GOI is 
doing nothing to encourage moderate Palestinians to take 
over.  Olmert, who, as a member of the inner Cabinet, would 
have helped make the decision to kill Yassin, also commented 
that the assassination could have a problematic impact on the 
future of Gaza, citing the greater difficulty the GOI would 
have in coordinating with the PA over security issues related 
to the Israeli withdrawal. 
 
----------------------------------- 
U.S. Support for Gaza Disengagement 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Mofaz said that he gained the impression from a visit 
to Washington the week before that the USG favors Sharon\'s 
Gaza disengagement plan and appreciates why Israel must take 
unilateral action.  From his own point of view, he saw the 
removal of settlements from Gaza improving Israel\'s overall 
security situation and giving the IDF greater flexibility. 
The plan, he said, preserves chances for the roadmap.  He 
said he hoped that U.S. support would help convince GOI 
members currently opposed to the plan to support it. 
 
6. (C) Olmert focused as well on the importance of U.S. 
support, but averred that he did not expect the U.S. to 
provide financial assistance for Gaza withdrawal.  The extent 
of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank under consideration 
was probably not enough to motivate strong U.S. support.  He 
did predict, however, that President Bush, in a one-on-one 
meeting with Sharon, would ask Sharon to trust him on the 
question of support on the withdrawal plan and Israel\'s 
rejection of a Palestinian \"right of return\" until after the 
U.S. election. 
 
7. (C) Sneh blasted what he called Sharon\'s \"strategy behind 
the pullout,\" charging that Sharon\'s ultimate goal is to get 
assurances that Israel will be left alone on West Bank 
matters.  The result of Sharon\'s approach, he asserted, would 
be a \"Hamastan\" in the South to go along with the 
\"Hizballahstan\" that Israel already allowed to be created in 
the North. 
 
8. (C) Asked by Zakheim about the U.S. role, Sneh said the 
GOI could not \"cynically\" ask the U.S. for financial 
assistance.  To do so would be neither \"respectful\" nor 
\"dignified.\"  For its part, Sneh continued, the U.S. should 
ensure that: 
 
-- There is no Hamas state in either Gaza or the West Bank; 
 
-- Israel dismantles outposts in the West Bank before 
proceeding with Gaza settlements; 
 
-- The separation barrier sticks \"strictly\" to the Green Line; 
 
-- The GOI \"negotiates\" with Dahlan and Gaza security figures 
in advance of Israeli departure from Gaza; 
 
-- The GOI does not pay \"exaggerated compensation\" to the 
7,000 or so Gaza settlers, as this would create an impossible 
precedent for removing the 100,000 or so West Bank settlers 
whom the GOI would have to move in any agreement on the West 
Bank; 
 
-- The status of West Bank settlements be negotiated 
(Comment: Sneh did not say with whom) before any settlers are 
removed from Gaza. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Internal GOI Politicking on Disengagement 
----------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Looking ahead to prospects for approval of Sharon\'s 
plan in the Cabinet, Olmert commented that Finance Minister 
Netanyahu\'s wishes were unclear, although many insiders 
believe that he\'s in favor of withdrawal from Gaza. 
Netanyahu does, however, appear to be worried about the U.S. 
position and his own prospects, as finance minister, for 
ending up stuck with the bill.  Olmert predicted that Foreign 
Minister Shalom, who has not taken a position yet, would 
ultimately come around to Sharon\'s plan.  He claimed that 
Shalom had come to realize after a recent meeting with some 
of his base supporters in the Yemenite Orthodox community 
that he could afford politically to back the PM. 
 
10. (C) Steinetz told Zakheim that he might ultimately be 
able to support the withdrawal, but only if it involves Gaza 
only, not the West Bank.  Israel, he said, could afford to 
take more security risks in Gaza than in the West Bank, which 
sits close to the most strategic places in Israel, e.g., 
Jerusalem, Ben-Gurion airport, and the economic centers 
around Tel Aviv.  If the withdrawal were limited to Gaza 
only, he predicted, no Likud members, or virtually none, 
would leave the party. 
 
-------------------- 
Withdrawal Logistics 
-------------------- 
 
11. (C) Mofaz said he hoped to begin the withdrawal from Gaza 
at the end of the year.  This would permit completion of the 
plan by the summer of 2005.  Zakheim asked why the process 
will take so long.  Mofaz replied that removal of the 
settlers, including \"talking with them\" and finding them new 
housing, would prove time-consuming.  Pressed by Zakheim for 
a budget estimate for withdrawal, Mofaz demurred, but finally 
said, \"Maybe a few billion shekels.  I can\'t say if it\'s five 
or eight billion.\"  Sneh said he had the impression that Gaza 
settlers would move in roughly equal proportion to the Negev, 
to other parts of Israel, and to West Bank settlements. 
 
12. (C) Olmert said the GOI had no definite timetable for the 
withdrawal, although he thought it might begin after the U.S. 
election.  Should President Bush lose the election, the start 
could be delayed. 
 
13. (U) U/S Zakheim cleared this message.

------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media reported that last night PM Sharon promised 
at the Likud convention that registered Likud members 
would get to vote on his Gaza disengagement plan. 
Ha\'aretz says that Sharon\'s pledge \"came under a hail 
of scathing criticism from the right as well as the 
left.\"  Yediot published the results of a Mina Zemach 
(Dahaf) poll taken last night among register Likud 
members:  51 percent support disengagement; 36 percent 
are opposed to it.  A concurrent Maariv poll finds 51 
percent in support of Sharon\'s plan, 39 percent opposed 
to it, while 10 percent are undecided. 
 
Israel Radio quoted GOI sources in Jerusalem as saying 
that following Sharon\'s talks in Washington, the U.S. 
will recognize Israel\'s security needs, but not 
settlement blocs in the West Bank.  Yediot filed a 
similar report based on \"the draft\" of an Israeli- 
American document.  Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli 
diplomatic officials as saying that Israel\'s request 
that the U.S. formally reject the Palestinian demand 
for refugee repatriation in exchange for disengagement 
is likely to be finessed by a U.S. declaration for two 
states -- one for Jews, and one for Palestinians. 
Ha\'aretz reported that Israel has asked the U.S. to 
provide official endorsement of the separation fence 
route, as part of the \"benefits basket\" which is to be 
provided in exchange for the implementation of the 
disengagement plan.  The newspaper reported that this 
request was submitted as part of an attempt to satisfy 
conditions upon which Finance Minister Binyamin 
Netanyahu has predicated his support for the separation 
plan.  Ha\'aretz further reported that Thursday the 
three U.S. envoys -- William Burns, Elliott Abrams and 
Steve Hadley -- will finalize details of the compromise 
with Sharon.  The newspaper reported that the USG is no 
longer lobbying for changes in the barrier\'s planned 
route.  Ha\'aretz reported that the compromise proposal 
was submitted by Defense Ministry D-G Amos Yaron in 
discussions with the U.S. envoys. 
 
Jerusalem Post featured the story of a 15-year-old 
Palestinian, one of four Nablus boys to whom Islamic 
Jihad promised heaven in exchange for martyrdom as 
suicide bombers. 
 
Leading media reported that Tuesday and today hundreds 
of members of the security forces clashed with settlers 
during the evacuation the Hazon settler outpost in the 
vicinity of Kiryat Arba, next to Hebron.  IDF Radio and 
Israel Radio reported that this morning six policemen 
were injured by stones thrown during disturbances that 
broke out after members of the Ateret Kohanim movement 
entered homes they had purchased in the Palestinian 
village of Silwan (East Jerusalem). 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Tuesday cabinet minister 
Natan Sharansky wrote to the BBC that it employs a 
\"gross double standard to the Jewish state\" that smacks 
of anti-Semitism.  He was reacting to its coverage of 
the IDF\'s arrest of a 16-year-old would-be suicide 
bomber last week, which the British corporation 
portrayed as \"Israel\'s cynical manipulation of a 
Palestinian youngster for propaganda purposes.\" 
 
All media, except the ultra-Orthodox newspapers, 
reported that the Euroleague basketball championship 
will be played in Israel as planned next month despite 
security concerns.  The media had reported on 
significant protests in Israel about the possibility 
that the games could be moved to Spain. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited a Bank of Israel report released 
Tuesday, according to which the Intifada has cost 
Israel between 31 billion shekels (around USD 6.9 
billion) and 40 billion shekels (around USD 8.85 
billion) so far, but not including defense costs.  The 
amount comes to between 6.2 percent and 8 percent of 
the GDP.  Maariv also cited the document. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that, in response to a petition 
signed last week by Palestinian intellectuals and 
activists calling for a peaceful intifada, 81 
Palestinians issued a statement on Tuesday urging the 
Palestinians to continue the fight against Israel until 
they achieve all their rights. 
 
All media reported that Tuesday the Haifa District 
Court charged Jewish terror suspect Eliran Golan with 
the attempted murder of Arab Knesset Member Issam 
Makhoul and at least three other people in the Haifa 
area.  The court also charged Alex Rabinovitch with 
assistance in attempted murder, conspiracy and 
supplying Golan with bomb-making equipment.  However, 
Golan denied that Rabinovitch had abetted him. 
 
All media reported that Tuesday thousands of people 
took part in Land Day protests in the Israeli Arab 
sector, which came to pass without incidents. 
 
Jerusalem Post quotes former Sharon adviser David 
Spector as saying that audio tapes, allegedly in the 
possession of Sharon\'s son Gilad, will incriminate his 
father and himself, and will strengthen the draft 
indictment against them once they are handed over to 
investigators, as demanded by the High Court of 
Justice. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that, following the assassination of 
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the hosts of a scientific 
conference on desert dunes, which was supposed to be 
held in Layoun, Morocco, in ten days asked the three 
would-be Israeli participants not to come to the event. 
The European organizers of the conference and its 
French financial sponsors subsequently canceled it, 
citing their objection to discrimination. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported on a poll conducted by the 
Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research just 
before the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin: 
-53 percent of Palestinians support terrorist attacks 
against Israeli civilians (up from 48 percent last 
December). 
-27 percent support Hamas; 20 percent support Fatah; 40 
percent refused to state a preference between the two 
movements. 
-\"Are you in favor of Hamas conducting negotiations 
with Israel?\"  54 percent are opposed, while 41 percent 
support the idea.

Veteran op-ed writer and the late prime minister 
Yitzhak Rabin\'s assistant Eytan Haber opined in the

Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of 
Yediot Aharonot: \"Sharon is presently at a low.  The 
comfort is that he can only rise from here.\" 
 
Conservative columnist Avraham Tirosh wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv: \"It is extremely doubtful whether 
there is any point in Sharon traveling as a half-lame 
duck to meet the president of the U.S., in order to 
present a plan to him that could be erased from the 
public agenda within a few weeks along with its 
originator.\" 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"We Will Meet on the Barricades\" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer and the late prime minister 
Yitzhak Rabin\'s assistant Eytan Haber opined in the 
lead editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (March 31): \"Commentators will say: Sharon 
believes that the wishes of the registered Likud 
members are identical to the wishes of the general 
population of voters in Israel, who will support the 
disengagement plan en masse, according to public 
opinion polls.  At the same time, the 3,000 Central 
Committee members are more militant and many of them 
are opposed to the disengagement plan.  In other words, 
the Likud party members will carry out a \'bypass 
operation\' on the Central Committee members.   Sharon 
will then win and implement his plan.  And if the Likud 
voters reject the plan at the polls?   Then too, the 
plan will be implemented.  Because from the moment the 
United States enters the picture, accepts the plan and 
supports it, it is also an American plan.  In that 
case, no Israeli leader will dare stand up in the Oval 
Office and say: \'I am sorry, my constituency did not 
agree.\'  There will not be such a leader, because 
anyone who has ever reached the Prime Minister\'s Office 
and is familiar with the situation -- Israel\'s complete 
dependency on the U.S. from the standpoints of defense, 
foreign affairs and economic affairs -- knows that the 
Israeli leader has (almost) never been born who said 
\'no\' to America, and the last one who behaved this way, 
Yitzhak Shamir, was sent into early retirement by the 
Americans with the support of the Israelis.\" 
 
II.  \"Conceived in Sin\" 
 
Political parties correspondent Yossi Verter wrote on 
page one of independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (March 
31): \"Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\'s decision to hold a 
vote among Likud members about his separation plan was 
reached in the usual faltering, belated manner.  This 
time, however, there was a new twist.  This time, 
Sharon\'s initiative was conceived in sin.... There were 
no counter-proposals, nor was there even an agenda. 
Senior Likud politicians who sat on the dais were 
stunned.  \'I thought I knew a thing or two about 
politics,\' said Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin last 
night. \'But there\'s always something new to be 
learned\'.... The timetable for the referendum dovetails 
with the diplomatic and legal schedules.... Should 
Sharon dodge an indictment, and win majority support 
among Likud members for his separation plan, the 
pullout proposal would go to the government and Knesset 
for approval, and a unity government will come into 
existence.  But should [Attorney General Menachem] 
Mazuz decide to indict Sharon, everything would be 
frozen.  The same would happen if Sharon lost in the 
Likud poll -- he will have to resign if his own party 
members reject his diplomatic initiative.\" 
 
III.  \"The Arbel Effect\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of 
Yediot Aharonot (March 31): \"Sharon is a prime minister 
under duress.  Aside from targeted killings, everything 
he has done on the Palestinian issue was done against 
his will: that is the way he built the fence, supported 
the road map and arrived at the withdrawal from Gaza. 
He knew he would have to get past President Bush, the 
Knesset, the cabinet, and perhaps the general 
electorate as well.  He scorned the institutions of his 
party.  But today\'s Sharon is not the man he used to 
be.  That is the result of the Edna Arbel effect.  [NB: 
Arbel is the country\'s State Attorney, who has 
recommended that Sharon be indicted.]  He can pass 
political plans, with a tailwind from the United 
States, but the ability to scorn has been taken from 
him.... Sharon is presently at a low.  The comfort is 
that he can only rise from here.  A sample scenario: he 
travels to the U.S., does not receive many commitments 
... but his encouraging photographs with the president, 
in rolled-up sleeves, in shirts open at the neck, in 
the rural landscape of Camp David, gladden the nation. 
Then comes a sweeping victory in the referendum, 
followed by the case being closed, accompanied by 
petitions to the High Court of Justice and a 
continuation of investigations in the Cyril Kern 
[corruption] affair, but is still a dynamic of victory. 
The Likud hears the voice of the people and remains 
united.  With a little luck, the right wing ministers 
are also persuaded to stay (and if not, there is always 
Shimon Peres).\" 
 
IV.  \"Sharon\'s Time Is Up\" 
 
Conservative columnist Avraham Tirosh wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (March 31): \"It is extremely doubtful 
whether there is any point in Sharon traveling as a 
half-lame duck to meet the president of the U.S., in 
order to present a plan to him that could be erased 
from the public agenda within a few weeks along with 
its originator.  What is clear beyond a doubt is that 
even if he goes to Washington and receives Bush\'s 
blessing, Sharon will not be able to bring his plan 
before the cabinet for a vote before [Attorney General 
Menachem] Mazuz has spoken his piece.  He is now the 
boss who determines the schedule, and in fact the 
future of the diplomatic initiatives in the region.  He 
and not Sharon, he and not Bush.... There is no longer 
confidence [among the Israeli public] in the man 
himself, as the polls show, apparently due to these 
[alleged corruption] affairs.... In its present 
situation, Israel needs a prime minister with a clean 
head and even cleaner hands.\"

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"The more forcefully the Bush administration advocates 
[reforms in the Arab world], the more it will put 
repressive Arab regimes on the defensive, and the more 
courage it will give to the best elements in Arab 
society.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
\"Arab Reform Now\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(March 31): \"It strikes us [The Jerusalem Post] as 
strange, to say the least, that the establishment of an 
effective and representative legislature in, say, 
Yemen, hinges on developments in Israel.  It is said 
that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict provides Arab 
regimes with an alibi not to reform.  Perhaps, but that 
would seem to suggest an interest among Arab despots in 
perpetuating the conflict, not resolving it.  At any 
rate, why should the political freedoms of Arab peoples 
be captive to what arch-enemy Israel does or does not 
do?.... Among the conclusions the Bush administration 
drew from September 11 was that the risks of inaction 
outweighed the risks of action; that advocating 
stability above freedom in the Middle East was 
counterproductive, hypocritical, and unworthy of the 
United States; and that reforming the Arab world was a 
sine qua non for defeating terrorism.  We believe these 
conclusions are correct.  The more forcefully the Bush 
administration advocates them, the more it will put 
repressive Arab regimes on the defensive, and the more 
courage it will give to the best elements in Arab 
society.  As policy goes, this may be simplistic, but 
it\'s the only approach that\'s likely to succeed.\"

SUBJECT: LABOR\'S ENTRY TO COALITION COULD HINGE ON 
INDICTMENT DECISION 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 1906 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer for reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: In the face of a possible bribery indictment 
against PM Sharon, speculation has begun over whether Labor 
will put on hold any plans to take the place of the 
right-wing parties in Sharon\'s coalition if they eventually 
bolt over Gaza withdrawal (reftel).  Before the State 
Prosecutor delivered her recommendation to indict Sharon on 
March 28, MKs both in and outside Labor treated a unity 
government as imminent if and when Sharon\'s disengagement 
plan wins Cabinet approval, since leaders of both right-wing 
coalition parties had said they would then leave the 
coalition.  One Labor MK told Ambassador Kurtzer as recently 
as March 23 that there are no substantive barriers, including 
on the nature of PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan, that would 
hold Labor back from joining with Likud.  PM Sharon\'s 
announcement that he now intends to present his plan to Likud 
voters for approval, probably in mid-May, and only then 
present it to the Cabinet, puts off at least for some weeks 
the rightists\' decision point.  With reports now indicating 
that AG Menachem Mazuz could take two months to reach an 
indictment decision, Labor could still find itself in the 
awkward position of having to decide whether to join with 
Sharon before the AG decides whether to indict him.  While 
Labor leaders are remaining judiciously silent on the 
prospects of a unity government, they must now weigh the 
costs of joining a government headed by a tainted prime 
minister who says he is determined to take the major step 
that Labor has endorsed for years.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Pre-Arbel Announcement, MKs Saw Labor/Likud Unity Imminent 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2. (C) Before State Prosecutor Edna Arbel recommended to AG 
Menachem Mazuz March 28 that he indict PM Sharon on bribery 
charges in the \"Greek Island Affair\" (reftel), Labor MKs 
predicted Labor would join the Likud government as soon as 
the right-wing National Religious Party (NRP) and National 
Union (NU) bolt the coalition.  NRP and NU leaders had said 
they would do so to oppose Sharon\'s controversial Gaza 
disengagement plan, and while they have offered various 
timing scenarios, observers looked for a walkout immediately 
after a Cabinet approval of the plan.  MK Isaac Herzog 
(Labor) told Ambassador Kurtzer on March 23 that 16 of the 19 
Labor MKs would agree to join a Likud government, with Labor 
MKs Amram Mitzna, Yuli Tamir, and Avraham Burg the only 
hold-outs.  MK Burg and Shinui MK Eti Livni both told poloff 
in separate conversations that Labor was eager to join with 
Likud.  Echoing this assessment from the Likud side, Deputy 
PM Ehud Olmert asserted in a March 26 radio interview that he 
is \"almost certain\" that \"if political conditions are ripe 
the Labor Party will join the government.\" 
 
3.  (C) In fact, Labor is so anxious to join with Likud, 
Herzog told Ambassador Kurtzer on March 23, that there are no 
real substantive issues that block its agreement to join. 
Labor would even go along with a a withdrawal plan for Gaza 
settlements only, despite Labor\'s desire for inclusion of 
West Bank elements too, Herzog said.  Herzog went so far as 
to forecast which ministerial seats Labor would receive if it 
joins the coalition.  Peres, he predicted, would promise 
seats to former unity government Defense Minister Binyamin 
\"Fuad\" Ben-Eliezer, Dalia Itzik, Chaim Ramon, Shalom Simhon, 
and Avraham Shochat and Peres would seek the foreign minister 
seat for himself. 
 
------------------ 
Labor on the Verge 
------------------ 
 
4.  (C) State Prosecutor Arbel\'s recommendation to indict 
Sharon, however, could complicate Labor\'s decision to join 
with Likud.  For now, Labor\'s leaders are remaining 
judiciously silent.  Only a handful of Labor MKs have so far 
commented on Arbel\'s recommendation, leaving a party view on 
the matter anything but clear.  Labor MKs Yuli Tamir and Ofir 
Pines-Paz called on the PM to suspend himself until his name 
is cleared (reftel), while Labor faction chair Dalia Itzik 
called on her Knesset colleagues to reserve judgment until 
after the AG decides on whether to indict.  Labor MK Burg 
reportedly on March 29 called on Peres to announce that Labor 
will not join with Likud while Sharon is involved in 
scandals.  Without providing the names of its sources, the 
major Hebrew daily \"Ma\'ariv\" reported on March 30 that 
Arbel\'s indictment recommendation \"caused the immediate 
suspension of a secret agreement recently reached by Sharon\'s 
aides and Labor Party representatives,\" identified in the 
report as Sharon COS Dov Weissglas on the Likud side and MK 
Chaim Ramon on the Labor side.  According to the unsourced 
Ma\'ariv article, which Peres and a Sharon spokesperson have 
since denied, Likud and Labor teams discussed a division of 
ministerial portfolios similar to that recounted by Herzog 
above. 
 
---------------------------- 
Sharon May Push the Envelope 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Labor leaders clearly face the difficult situation of 
having to choose between joining a government headed by a 
tainted prime minister or not joining and thereby sacrificing 
a chance to realize a Gaza withdrawal, a policy Labor has 
endorsed for years.  Sharon\'s decision to hold a Likud-wide 
referendum, probably in mid-May, and only later to submit the 
withdrawal plan to the Cabinet, puts off for some weeks the 
rightist coalition partners\' decision point on leaving, and, 
by extension, Labor\'s decision point on joining.  At the same 
time, reports now indicate that AG Mazuz is looking at two 
months to reach a Sharon indictment decision.  Labor may thus 
still have to make its decision on joining the coalition 
without the benefit of the AG\'s decision.

SUBJECT: FIRST OUTPOST REMOVED UNDER NEW LEGAL PROCESS 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 1391 
 
Classified By: DCM Richard LeBaron for Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
This is a joint Embassy Tel Aviv/ConGen Jerusalem Cable 
 
1. (C) IDF forces succeeded early Wednesday March 31 in their 
second attempt within 24 hours to remove the outpost of Hazon 
David near Kiryat Arba in the West Bank.  The IDF had failed 
the previous evening to remove the outpost, reportedly little 
more than a number of tents and a makeshift synagogue, when 
it encountered organized settler resistance and backed off. 
The successful evacuation Wednesday morning followed IDF 
action forcibly blocking most settler access to the areas 
around the outpost.  According to the settler website Arutz 
7, settlers have vowed to reestablish the outpost.  Settler 
activists attempting to get to the site clashed with border 
police and IDF units later in the day, leaving a policewoman 
and a teenage boy lightly injured. 
 
---------------------------------- 
GOI Moves the Ball Forward, Slowly 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) This action moves the process of GOI removal of those 
outposts established after March 2001 a small but significant 
step forward.  It is the first outpost removed under PM 
Sharon\'s December 2003 decision to base GOI challenges to the 
establishment of illegal outposts on security and political 
grounds, rather than on violations of zoning and building 
laws (reftel).  This decision was enshrined in the March 4 
High Court of Justice decision specifically authorizing Hazon 
David\'s removal that was immediately appealed by settler 
groups.  The High Court rejected this appeal, lodged by 
settlement groups such including Amana and the Gush Emmunim, 
on March 22, thus paving the way for the March 31 removal. 
IDF action against the Hazon David outpost, and the court 
decision that made it possible, could thus presage the 
removal of other established outposts.  (Note: Hazon David 
was not one of the 49 sites listed as still present on the 
list of post-march 2001 outposts passed by the Ambassador to 
the IDF on January 14 because we could not confirm its 
location.  Therefore there are still 49 outposts present from 
the January 14 list, and many of these are occupied and 
growing.  The test of the Hazon David action will be whether 
it is followed by action against the more established 
outposts. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Palestinians and Settlers Downplay 
Evacuation\'s Significance 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Palestinian and settler officials largely downplayed 
the IDF action.  Sa\'eb Erekat, PA Minister for Negotiations, 
derided the evacuation as \"cosmetic.\"  \"Settlement activity 
goes on, and the war goes on,\" Erekat said in a public 
statement.  Elyakim Haetzni, a hard-core settler activist in 
Kiryat Arba, largely shared Erekat\'s assessment.  \"This place 
is a joke; it\'s nothing,\" Haetzni told PolOff March 31. 
\"It\'s part of a cat-and-mouse game\" between the settlers and 
Sharon, he added.  \"It will be a losing battle for the 
government because they will need to keep 100-200 soldiers at 
the site for months to keep us away,\" said Haetzni.  \"This 
place was just four walls made of simple stones with a 
tarpaulin for a roof,\" he said, laughing. \"If they try to 
remove a larger place, there will be much more resistance.\" 
Haetzni said that the settlers who clashed with police in the 
area hours after the evacuation were intending to rebuild the 
outpost. 
 
---------------------------- 
Settlers Preparing to Resist 
Future Evacuations 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Shaul Goldstein, vice chair of the YESHA Council and 
head of the Gush Etzion council, told PolOff March 31 that 
Bat Ayin West-West, one of the outposts in Gush Etzion, had 
received IDF evacuation orders yesterday, but he did not know 
when or if the orders would be carried out.  Goldstein said 
he couldn\'t be sure the settlers will be able to re-establish 
the outpost if it is removed.  \"We don\'t have so much money 
right now,\" he said. \"And we don\'t have the money for a PR 
campaign, like the Geneva Accord people do.\"  (Note: Both 
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have been plastered recently with 
high-quality posters opposing the evacuation of settlements 
as part of the \"disengagement plan.\")  Goldstein predicted 
that the settlers would save their resistance efforts for 
larger, populated outposts, and that the settlers would make 
Sharon pay a political price for this and any other 
evacuations.  For Goldstein, the stakes seemed high: \"Today 
is the beginning of the destruction of Israel.\"

number of merchants crossing March 31 was not available.  The 
IDF also allowed diplomats in vehicles and internationals on 
foot to cross.  UN agencies, however, refuse to authorize 
their non-diplomatic staff to cross on foot; staff must

-- At the Likud Party Convention March 30, PM Sharon promised 
to hold a referendum among registered Likud party members on 
his plan for unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip 
(see Tel Aviv septel). 
 
-- Approximately 15,000 people participated in the main 
demonstration March 30 commemorating the 28th anniversary of 
Land Day in the village of Arraba.  Also on March 30, several 
thousand protesters participated in a march in Kafr Kanna to 
commemorate the death of village residents in the riots that

Intifada. 
 
-- Israeli media reported March 30 that a commission of 
inquiry into the March 14 double suicide bombing at Ashdod

failed to follow proper procedure and thoroughly examine the 
container by which it is believed the bombers reached Ashdod. 
 Guards at Ashdod were absolved of any wrongdoing.

been to harm Israeli Arabs in general, but rather to target 
those whom he felt were endangering Israel\'s security.

REGIONAL SECURITY SITUATION; UNILATERAL DISENGAGEMENT PLANS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
. 
 
1. (C) Summary.  In a series of meetings with GOI officials 
between March 26-30, former NEA A/S and Ambassador to Israel 
Ed Djerejian, here as an official guest of the Foreign 
Ministry in his current capacity as Director of the Baker 
Institute, heard that the regional strategic situation faced 
by Israel had improved, largely as a result of the Iraq war, 
but that threats remained.  Drawing on his experience as 
former U.S. Ambassador to Israel and on the U.S.-Syria 
dialogue hosted by the Baker Institute, Djerejian advocated 
\"muscular diplomacy\" with the Syrians.  Israeli officials 
were uniformly dismissive of any prospect for 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, as long as Arafat is on the 
scene.  PM COS Dov Weissglas briefed Djerejian on the main 
contours of the PM\'s disengagement plan.  Other 
interlocutors, while accepting the premise that unilateral 
disengagement represented a means of decreasing tension until 
such time as bilateral negotiations with a credible 
negotiating partner could be resumed, raised a number of 
concerns about the plan\'s implications.  For example, 
Immigration and Absorption Minister Tzipi Livni raised 
questions about the \"ambiguous legal status\" of the 
territories from which Israel will withdraw.  Others explored 
the issue of what \"price\" should be paid to compensate Israel 
for its territorial concession.  Djerejian\'s interlocutors 
widely assumed that, in the absence of a credible Palestinian 
partner, the United States should be prepared to compensate 
Israel.  Ambassador Djerejian emphasized the need to help 
empower the Palestinian security forces to assume security 
responsibility and to avoid the empowerment of Hamas.  NSC 
Director Giora Eiland briefed on his alternative vision for 
achieving a viable, two-state solution through a land swap 
with Egypt.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The Israeli Foreign Ministry hosted a March 26-30 
visit to Israel by Ambassador Ed Djerejian, the founding 
director of the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice 
University, who was formerly U.S. Ambassador to Israel, U.S. 
Ambassador to Syria and NEA A/S.  During the four-day visit, 
Ambassador and poloff accompanied Amb. Djerejian to his 
numerous meetings with high-level Israeli government 
officials and opinion leaders, who included PM COS Dov 
Weissglas, National Security Council Director Giora Eiland, 
Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, IDF COS MG \"Boogie\" Ya\'alon, 
Military Intelligence Chief MG Aharon Ze\'evi-Farkash, MOD DG 
Amos Yaron, MOD Political-Military Affairs Chief Amos Gilad, 
and Immigration and Absorption Affairs Minister Tzipi Livni. 
In addition, Djerejian met with former Mossad Chief (and 
former National Security Council Director) Ephraim Halevy. 
He also participated in a workshop on unilateral 
disengagement at the Economic Cooperation Foundation hosted 
by Executive Director Yair Hirschfeld.  Ambassador Kurtzer 
hosted a well-attended dinner in honor of Ambassador 
Djerejian that included a cabinet minister, a Member of the 
Knesset, Israeli government officials, representatives of 
non-governmental organizations, foreign diplomats, and 
Israeli academics and journalists. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Post-Iraq Situation Assessment: 
Israel\'s Security Improved, But Threats Remain 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. (S/NF) Ambassador Djerejian\'s first GOI meeting was with 
DMI Chief MG Ze\'evi-Farkash, who, drawing on Israel\'s 
just-concluded National Intelligence Estimate, briefed that 
the regional threats faced by Israel have been reduced as a 
result of the war in Iraq, although significant risks remain. 
 Citing \"hard evidence,\" Farkash was adamant that the Iraqis 
had been trying to achieve the capability to attack targets 
in Israel.  He said that Saddam\'s Iraq possessed 25-30 bombs, 
some of which were chem./bio-capable; a \"few\" launchers; and 
30-40 long-range missiles.  Farkash opined that it was 
\"possible\" that Saddam had transferred such weaponry to Syria 
and it was clear that formerly Iraqi-based \"front companies\" 
for WMD had relocated to Syria.  He conceded, however, that 
there is no concrete proof of weapons transfers.  Again 
citing \"sensitive\" information, Farkash said that Saddam 
himself had been involved with Syrian President Bashar 
al-Asad in the shipment to Syria of two truckloads of unknown 
contents, but Farkash took Djerejian\'s point that the trucks 
might well have been full of hard currency, the protection of 
which was a key concern of Saddam\'s in the run-up to the war. 
 
4. (C) Running though a \"before\" and \"after\" checklist of 
regional powers prior to and after the Iraq war, Farkash 
offered the following assessments.  (Commentary from other 
GOI interlocutors identified by name.) 
 
-- Arafat/Israeli-Palestinian Conflict:  The PA Chairman has 
made no strategic change as a result of the Iraq war.  He 
continues to reject a two-state solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  IDF COS Ya\'alon accused Arafat 
of sowing \"deliberate anarchy,\" assessing that the only 
effective response would be to completely isolate Arafat. 
Foreign Minister Shalom went even further, reiterating his 
long-held view that Arafat should be expelled.  MOD DG Amos 
Yaron asserted that even after 1,000 Intifada-related 
casualties the Israeli population would not succumb to 
terror.  \"If they want to fight,\" he said, \"We\'ll fight!\" 
Making an obscene gesture, he continued, \"And if they demand 
a \'right of return,\' no way!\" 
 
-- Iraq:  The United States effectively eliminated the 
\"eastern front\" threat.  The tension between the \"Bremer 
vector\" and the \"terror vector\" continues to play out, 
however, leaving the situation in Iraq \"very fragile.\"  Not 
unlike Arafat, the terrorists\' goal is to survive until the 
U.S. national elections. 
 
-- Libya:  Qaddafi has undergone a \"huge shift,\" 
characterized by \"deep, real change.\"  (Note:  Farkash took 
Djerejian\'s point that multilateral sanctions had played a 
decisive role in this context.  End Note.) 
 
-- Iran:  The regime is under pressure, but it has not taken 
a strategic decision to change.  MOD DG Yaron made clear that 
Iran remains an \"existential threat\" to Israel.  He also said 
Israel would not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapons 
capacity. 
 
-- Syria/Lebanon/Hizballah:  Not only has the SARG\'s posture 
not changed for the better as a result of the Iraq war, the 
situation has worsened, with Bashar facilitating the delivery 
of weapons to Hizballah and inviting Iranian mullahs to 
cultivate the Shi\'a population.  Ya\'alon asserted that Syria 
now plays a \"key\" role in the external support structure for 
Palestinian terror.  While some support is generated in Iran 
and funneled through Damascus and Lebanon, Syria plays host 
to the external leadership of Palestinian terror organizations 
 
-- Al-Qaeda:  In the aftermath of the war in Afghanistan, 
al-Qaeda turned increasingly to countries like Sudan, 
Somalia, Mauritania, and Algeria as hosts.  This represents a 
tactical, as opposed to a strategic, change, however.  There 
has been no diminution of al-Qaeda\'s jihadist efforts as a 
result of the war in Iraq.  Citing interdisciplinary 
\"scientific\" studies commissioned by the DMI, Farkash 
emphasized that it is important not to look at Al-Qaeda as a 
military organization.  Rather, it is an \"amoeba-like\" 
network of cells.  As such, it is most vulnerable at the 
intersection points between various cells. 
 
-- Turning to the rest of the Arab world, FM Shalom said that 
he could feel a palpable change in Arab countries, such as 
Qatar and Bahrain, where there is a greater openness to 
Israel.  Even Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, he said, is so 
inclined. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Unilateral Disengagement Scenarios: 
Answers and Questions 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) PM COS Dov Weissglas told Ambassador Djerejian that PM 
Sharon intended to \"fully withdraw\" from the Gaza Strip and 
to evacuate from \"a couple\" settlements in the northern West 
Bank.  (Note:  At a private dinner hosted by Dahlia 
Rabin-Pelesoff, Weissglas specified the number of West Bank 
settlements would be six.  End Note.)  He qualified that the 
decision on whether to leave the Philadephi Strip in Gaza 
would be a military decision, dependent on the outcome of 
negotiations with Egypt.  Asked about the Egyptian role in 
securing Gaza, Weissglas said that the Egyptians did not want 
to be seen as \"replacing\" the Israeli occupation.  He said 
that Egyptian Intelligence Chief Omar Sulayman had given his 
assurances to a trusted interlocutor in Washington that Egypt 
would not allow chaos to emerge in Gaza.  Weissglas said he 
hopes Jordan will play a similar role in the West Bank.  NSC 
Director Giora Eiland evaded Ambassador Kurtzer\'s question 
about whether the GOI has a fall-back position on the 
\"assurances\" it is seeking from the United States as a quid 
pro quo for withdrawal, stating that \"it is not a question of 
fall-backs.\" 
 
6. (C) Immigration and Absorption Minister Tzipi Livni made 
clear that no one in the GOI views unilateral disengagement 
as a way to end the conflict with the Palestinians.  Rather, 
in the absence of a credible partner, disengagement is simply 
a means of easing tension.  The problem is that Palestinian 
terrorists will be tempted to view any Israeli withdrawal as 
evidence that terror pays.  Therefore, it must be clear that 
the Palestinians will achieve less as a result of unilateral 
disengagement than they would had they pursued good faith 
bilateral negotiations, whether in the context of the roadmap 
or some other vehicle.  Thus, she advocated remaining in the 
northern three settlements in the Gaza Strip, rather than 
evacuating it entirely.  This would also avoid a \"dangerous 
precedent\" of withdrawing to the 1967 borders, she reasoned. 
Asked whether these northern three settlements would become 
the \"Shabaa Farms\" of the Palestinians, Livni shrugged that 
even if those settlements were evacuated, \"the whole West 
Bank could be the Palestinian Shabaa.\" 
 
7. (C) Moreover, she said, there is a growing understanding 
that time is working against those who favor a two-state 
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The question, 
then, becomes how to convince those who seek to use terror 
that time is working against them?   To some extent, she 
said, the construction of the separation barrier, which 
represents \"the beginning of the two-state solution,\" is 
doing just that.  In this context, she noted that the 
principles that guided decision-making on the routing of the 
fence -- inclusion on the \"Israeli side\" of the barrier 
Jewish holy places and strategically important places, while 
requiring the minimum displacement of Israeli citizens from 
the \"other side\" of the barrier -- would be the same as those 
that guide GOI policy on the final borders. 
 
8. (C) As a long-time advocate of an explicit negation of the 
Palestinian \"claim of return,\" Livni argued that it is 
precisely because of Palestinian refusal to give up this 
claim that Israel needs the United States to make some kind 
of assurance on the matter.  Explaining her rationale, she 
said that the final status issues as defined by Oslo include 
refugees and statehood (which were linked); borders and 
settlements (which were linked) and Jerusalem, which is a 
\"unique\" issue.  Emphasizing the sanctity of the \"historical 
deal,\" Livni said that the establishment of a Palestinian 
state as a \"homeland for the Palestinian people\" obviates any 
claimed right of return of Palestinian refugees to Israel. 
To continue to insist on that right is tantamount to 
challenging Israel\'s right to exist as a secure, Jewish, 
democratic state.  She took umbrage that the Palestinians had 
\"switched the pairs\" by attempting to link the refugees issue 
with Jerusalem, a mistake to which she said the architects of 
the Geneva document had also fallen prey. 
 
9. (C) Livni also expressed reservations about the \"ambiguous 
legal status\" of the territories from which Israel withdraws. 
 On the one hand, she said, Israel must still control the 
international passages and the airspace over Gaza.  Israel 
would also insist on the ability to veto the presence of any 
\"foreign forces\" in Gaza.  \"So in these senses,\" she said, 
\"the occupation will continue,\" and the evacuated territories 
would not constitute a sovereign state.  On the other hand, 
Israel does not want to have responsibility for the economic 
and humanitarian situation of the Palestinians.  In a 
separate meeting, former NSC and Mossad Director Ephraim 
Halevy opined that Israel should make clear that it is 
\"vacating territory, not authority,\" since Israel is not 
currently the governing authority in the Gaza Strip.  He 
argued that the Palestinian Authority, at least 
theoretically, has \"full authority\" in the Gaza Strip, even 
if the PA has not been exercising this authority coercively. 
 
10. (C) Ya\'alon contended that, \"Unilateral withdrawal from 
the Gaza Strip will not improve Israel\'s security,\" since the 
Palestinians would not have to \"pay a price.\"  Ambassador 
Kurtzer urged that the GOI not underestimate the 
transformative power of the PM\'s unilateral withdrawal plan. 
Noting that the PM had changed the strategic environment, he 
questioned the underlying assumption that the unilateral 
approach ruled out the possibility of seeking a quid pro quo 
from the Palestinians.  For lack of a Palestinian partner 
with whom to negotiate, the GOI had understandably turned to 
the USG to pay a price.  An alternative approach, he said, 
would be to empower a partner on the other side through the 
one thing that no other Palestinian leader had been able to 
extract from the Israelis -- territorial withdrawal.  The GOI 
could potentially extract a price from a so-empowered 
Palestinian leader.  Ya\'alon rejected this reasoning, 
asserting that it is unrealistic to expect the empowerment of 
anyone as long as Arafat is on the scene.  NSC Director 
Eiland was skeptical, but he did not completely rule out this 
scenario.  Eiland\'s predecessor in that position, Ephraim 
Halevy, mused out loud that if the GOI had \"invested 
yesterday in Abu Mazen what we\'re prepared to invest today 
unilaterally, we\'d be looking at a different story.  Why we 
didn\'t do it, I can\'t say.\" 
 
11. (C) Ambassador Djerejian urged his GOI interlocutors to 
work actively to empower the PA security forces to take 
control of the areas from which Israel withdraws and to 
eliminate Hamas.  The empowerment of Finance Minister Salam 
Fayyad could serve as a model, he argued.  Yaron responded to 
this point by noting that \"it is no secret\" that the GOI has 
been keeping in touch with former PA Interior Minister 
Mohammed Dahlan to this end.  In his meeting with Ya\'alon, 
Djerejian asked whether the Israelis had considered 
imprisoned Fatah/Tanzim leader Barghouti as a potentially 
viable Palestinian leader.  Ya\'alon simply shook his head. 
Halevy asserted that, \"There will come a time when it becomes 
necessary to try to recruit Hamas as part of the solution.\" 
Assessing that Fatah is weak, he opined that Fatah leaders 
will ultimately need to co-opt at least some elements of 
Hamas into the body politic -- in order to isolate the real 
extremists.  Moreover, he said, Hamas leaders are \"practical 
people.\"  They have assiduously avoided a confrontation in 
which they would stand to lose their assets in a fight 
against the PA, and they can be expected to continue to do 
so. 
 
------------------------------- 
Israeli-Palestinian End-Game: 
Eiland Proposes Sinai Land Swap 
------------------------------- 
 
12. (C) Repeating a personal view that he had previously 
expressed to other USG visitors, NSC Director Eiland laid out 
for Ambassador Djerejian a different end-game solution than 
that which is commonly envisioned as the two-state solution. 
Eiland\'s view, he said, was prefaced on the assumption that 
demographic and other considerations make the prospect for a 
two-state solution between the Jordan and the Mediterranean 
unviable.  Currently, he said, there are 11 million people in 
Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip, and that number will 
increase to 36 million in 50 years.  The area between Beer 
Sheva and the northern tip of Israel (including the West Bank 
and Gaza) has the highest population density in the world. 
Gaza alone, he said, is already \"a huge concentration camp\" 
with 1.3 million Palestinians.  Moreover, the land is 
surrounded on three sides by deserts.  Palestinians need more 
land and Israel can ill-afford to cede it.  The solution, he 
argued, lies in the Sinai desert. 
 
13. (C) Specifically, Eiland proposed that Egypt be persuaded 
to contribute a 600 square kilometer parcel of land that 
would be annexed to a future Palestinian state as 
compensation for the 11 percent of the West Bank that Israel 
would seek to annex in a final status agreement.  This Sinai 
block, 20 kms of which would be along the Mediterranean 
coast, would be adjacent to the Gaza Strip.  A land corridor 
would be constructed connecting Egypt and this block to 
Jordan. (Note:  Presumably under Egyptian sovereignty.  End 
Note.)  In addition, Israel would provide Egypt a 200 square 
km block of land from further south in the Negev.  Eiland 
laid out the following advantages to his proposed solution: 
 
-- For the Palestinians:  The additional land would make Gaza 
viable.  It would be big enough to support a new port and 
airport, and to allow for the construction of a new city, all 
of which would help make Gaza economically viable.  It would 
provide sufficient space to support the return of Palestinian 
refugees.  In addition, the 20 km along the sea would 
increase fishing rights and would allow for the exploration 
of natural gas reserves.  Eiland argued that the benefits 
offered by this parcel of land are far more favorable to the 
Palestinians than would be parcels Israel could offer from 
the land-locked Negev. 
 
-- For Egypt:  Israel would compensate Egypt with a parcel of 
land on a 1:3 ratio, which is the ratio of the size of Israel 
to the Sinai.  Egypt would enjoy the land corridor to Jordan, 
thereby controlling the shortest distance between Jordan and 
Saudi Arabia to Europe. 
 
-- For Jordan:  The greater the capacity of the Gaza Strip to 
absorb Palestinian refugees, the fewer the number of refugees 
who would \"return\" to settle in the West Bank, thereby 
resulting in less pressure on Jordan. Jordan would also 
benefit economically from the land bridge. 
 
14. (C) Eiland, having previously debated the merits of this 
proposal with Ambassador Kurtzer, conceded the point that 
Egyptian President Mubarak \"would never agree\" to it, and he 
also took the point that in negotiating the Israel-Egypt 
peace treaty Israel had foregone the entire Sinai and 
accepted the Palestinian issue as an \"Israeli\" problem.  He 
nonetheless refused to be dissuaded from exploring the idea, 
noting that he had reason to believe that Prime Minister 
Sharon would support such a proposal, if it were tabled by a 
third party. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Syria:  Muscular Diplomacy Needed 
---------------------------------- 
 
15. (C) Ambassador Djerejian briefed his GOI interlocutors on 
the three face-to-face meetings he has held with Bashar 
al-Asad since Bashar assumed office.  He noted that Bashar 
had initially been quite dynamic and determined to move 
forward on economic and social reforms.  Bashar had been 
enthusiastic about the idea of developing a Track II 
U.S.-Syria dialogue, three rounds of which had now been 
hosted at the Baker Institute.  Bashar himself had suggested 
that the agenda include terrorism, U.S.-Syria bilateral 
relations, regional issues, and Israel-Syria negotiations. 
By the time of the second round of the dialogue, however, 
Bashar was exhibiting much less interest in the economic and 
social reform issues, perhaps as a result of the growing 
corrupting influences of money and power. 
 
16. (C) Asked whether he believed Bashar was sincere in his 
professed interest in revisiting Israel-Syria negotiations, 
Djerejian answered affirmatively.  He noted two caveats, 
however:  First, Bashar made clear that just as Arafat broke 
ranks with the rest of the Arab world in pursuing 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in Oslo, Syria would be 
prepared to break ranks with the Palestinians in pursuing the 
Syria track.  Bashar argued that it would be impossible to do 
so, however, without some improvement in the 
Israeli-Palestinian situation.  In addition, Bashar had 
emphasized to Djerejian that Israel-Syria negotiations should 
not start from scratch but rather should be conducted on the 
basis of the \"legacy\" of previous negotiations. 
 
17. (C) Without addressing the veracity of Bashar\'s claims, 
Djerejian conveyed in his meetings here the gist of his 
conversations in Damascus, in which the Syrian President had 
maintained that Palestinian rejectionist groups housed in 
Damascus were conducting only \"political\" activities. 
Djerejian\'s interlocutors uniformly rejected the Syrian 
leader\'s claims.  As Ya\'alon put it, the Syrian leader quite 
simply was lying, and the GOI had ample evidence to prove it. 
 
18. (C) As for how to influence the Syrian regime, Ambassador 
Djerejian advocated an approach of constructive engagement 
coupled with \"muscular diplomacy,\" rather than a strategy 
focused on isolating and pressuring Bashar.  Most of 
Djerejian\'s interlocutors favored a more aggressive approach. 
 Ya\'alon, however, agreed in principle with a measured carrot 
and stick approach -- \"as long as it\'s a big stick and a 
conditional carrot.\" 
 
19. (C) Eiland argued that Israel should not pursue a peace 
treaty with Syria, because it would necessitate Israel\'s 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights.  In this context, he 
asserted that it had also been a mistake to make peace with 
Egypt, among other reasons because Israel had set a precedent 
by withdrawing from the entire Sinai, thereby raising 
expectations that Israel would also ultimately withdraw 
completely from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as from 
the Golan.  Eiland argued passionately that any potential 
benefit to Israel\'s security that would be gained in the 
context of a peace accord with Syria would be outweighed by 
the cost associated with withdrawing from the Golan Heights. 
\"Israel needs the space, the water -- even the views\" on the 
Golan.

1. (C)  SUMMARY: PM Sharon\'s decision to take his unilateral 
disengagement plan to a referendum of the full 200,000-strong 
Likud membership, a body more moderate than its leadership, 
reinforces his hand in dealing with Likud and other-party 
ministers and Knesset members who oppose withdrawal.  The 
action also staves off for the anticipated six-week 
referendum preparation period any leftist or other demands 
for visible action toward withdrawal, and leaves Sharon time 
both to pursue USG assurances and to build a public relations 
bulwark against possible indictment on bribery charges 
(reftels).  In the unlikely event that the Likud referendum 
goes against his plan, Sharon will be able to say that he 
made every effort to work for peace and security.  If he wins 
by a narrow margin, Sharon could put off both the immense 
logistical challenge of settlement dismantlement by calling 
for a national referendum, a process that would require new 
legislation and would eat up additional months before the 
first settler leaves Gaza.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) Sharon\'s 14 Likud cabinet ministers and the remaining 
nine other-party ministers are clearly divided, with 
positions ranging from full support for withdrawal, to 
support with major conditions attached, to solid opposition 
(Ref C).  Among Likud ministers and Knesset members, a solid 
show of rank-and-file Likud support would be extraordinarily 
difficult to ignore, as noted by Likud Education Minister and 
withdrawal opponent Limor Livnat right after Sharon\'s 
announcement of the party referendum. 
 
3.  (C) A Likud referendum also allows the rightist coalition 
parties, the National Union and the National Religious Party, 
to put off their threatened departures from the coalition, 
and a pro-withdrawal vote could well prompt them to realize 
that an ever more confident Sharon will be justifiably deaf 
to their threats.  Among Labor, such a Likud vote is likely 
to convince at least some of the many skeptical rank and file 
and party leaders that Sharon means business, thus providing 
the political cover for a Likud/Labor unity government (Ref 
A). 
 
4.  (C) Among the broader public, the referendum will likely 
confirm polls showing widespread support for Gaza withdrawal 
and solidify Sharon\'s reputation as the only Israeli leader 
capable of taking such a step.  Observers say those points 
are likely to be factors in both Attorney General Mazuz\'s 
possible indictment considerations, and the public\'s support 
for even a corruption-tainted prime minister (Refs B and C). 
An opinion poll published March 31 by the major daily 
\"Yedioth Ahronoth,\" and a separate internal Likud survey both 
show that, even before any Sharon public relations campaign, 
51 percent of Likud members who would take part in the 
referendum would support his disengagement plan. 
 
5.  (C) Sharon need be in no hurry to finalize a withdrawal 
plan, although he will need to manage the \"outcomes\" of his 
visit to Washington in mid-April.  The acts of negotiating 
with Washington and conducting broad-based referenda maintain 
him in the public eye as an engaged, strong, confident 
leader, and dissipate pressure to address the bribery 
allegations, both those of the Greek island affair, for which 
the state attorney has recommended indictment, and those in 
the parallel Cyril Kern affair that await state attorney 
recommendations.  They also allow him to put off both the 
immensely difficult logistical task of actually withdrawing 
from settlements, and his possibly even more difficult 
ideological about-face from 37 years of hard-driving support 
for settlements.  Accordingly, Sharon could well determine 
some months from now, once a Likud referendum is out of the 
way, that he needs to go to a national referendum on 
withdrawal as well, a process that would require new 
legislation and eat up additional months before the first 
settler leaves Gaza.

Gaza Withdrawal Plan 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha\'aretz (Aluf Benn) cited a letter of guarantees 
drafted by the U.S. Administration in exchange for PM 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan.  The letter reportedly 
indicates that the U.S. will assure Israel that it will 
not have to withdraw to the Green Line in a future 
permanent agreement with the Palestinians.  The U.S. 
draft also reportedly says the Palestinian refugees 
will be able to return to a future Palestinian state, 
which will be established in keeping with President 
Bush\'s vision.  According to Ha\'aretz, the wording will 
partially meet Israel\'s demand that the U.S. declare 
its objection to the right of return, which the 
Palestinians insist on. 
 
Leading media quoted Sharon as hinting Wednesday at an 
annual high-tech event that he is likely to bring his 
disengagement plan to a vote among the Likud 
constituency in May or early June.  Leading media 
quoted Sharon as saying that there have been many 
achievements in the talks with the U.S. about the 
disengagement plan.  Sharon was also quoted as saying 
that the disengagement will put an end to the 
Palestinians\' \"historical pretext\" that they cannot 
fight terrorism.  Ha\'aretz and other media reported 
that opponents of Sharon\'s plan within the Likud have 
set up campaign headquarters.  Maariv reported that 
Sharon\'s campaign in the party will revolve around the 
message: \"It\'s me or Feiglin.\"  (Moshe Feiglin 
represents the Likud\'s far Right.)  Jerusalem Post 
quoted Sharon associates as saying Wednesday that Likud 
ministers who do not accept the decision of the party 
membership on the plan may lose their jobs.  Ha\'aretz 
reported that Peace Now is returning to the streets 
with a campaign backing unilateral withdrawal. 
 
All media (lead stories in Yediot and Jerusalem Post) 
reported that Wednesday Palestinian PM Ahmed Qurei (Abu 
Ala) urged Palestinians to put an end to suicide 
attacks and that he reiterated his commitment to the 
peace process.  This was the first time he has openly 
called for an end to suicide bombings, explaining that 
they are causing extensive damage to the Palestinians. 
Israel Radio and other media reported that Qurei\'s 
remarks to the Palestinian Legislative Council resulted 
from a precondition set by the U.S. for his scheduled 
meeting with U.S. envoys Stephen Hadley, Elliott Abrams 
and William Burns today.  Israel Radio quoted GOI 
officials as saying that Qurei\'s call to coordinate the 
disengagement plan with the PA is a transparent attempt 
to obtain U.S. and international support, and benefits 
for the PA.  The radio quoted PA sources as saying that 
Qurei has given instructions that no attacks be carried 
out during the U.S. envoys\' visit.  Hatzofe reported 
that Qurei told Palestinian reporters that the Israel- 
U.S. talks on disengagement remind him of the Balfour 
Declaration, which involved a declaring side that does 
not own the land and a receiving side that does not own 
it either.  The newspaper also quoted Qurei as saying 
that the PA will demand compensation from Israel for 
the settlements it built in the Gaza Strip and the use 
it made of the land and resources there. 
 
Israel Radio reported that the High Court of Justice 
has canceled various temporary injunctions that had 
stopped construction on segments of the security fence. 
 
Hatzofe reported that the IDF is bracing for further 
clashes over the dismantling of settler outposts. 
 
Israel Radio reported that early this morning at 
Bethlehem\'s mental hospital, the security forces 
arrested 12 \"senior wanted\" Palestinians, who had 
allegedly planned many attacks against Israel.  Their 
apprehension was preceded by an exchange of gunfire. 
The radio quoted Palestinian security sources as saying 
that eight of the men are activists in the Al Aqsa 
Martyrs Brigades, one of them being Jamal Hamamreh, the 
group\'s commander in the region.  Israel Radio also 
reported that, in a plea bargain, a military court has 
sentenced Ala el-Khader Koka, an Al Aqsa Martyrs 
Brigades militant, to 18 years in prison for planning 
to assassinate Israel\'s ambassadors in Germany and 
China, to poison water reservoirs and to blow up a 
wedding hall in Jerusalem.  Leading media reported that 
two months ago the security forces arrested a Hamas 
militant from a village near Jenin, who had planned to 
assassinate Likud Knesset Member and former FM David 
Levy.  Channel 2-TV reported that the Al Aqsa Martyrs 
Brigades have rescinded their threat against American 
interests in the region. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that responding to Hamas leader 
Abdel Aziz Rantisi\'s statement on Sunday, \"God declared 
war on America, Bush and Sharon,\" State Department 
Spokesman Richard called Hamas \"a major obstacle to the 
pursuit of peace.\"  Jerusalem Post quoted FM Silvan 
Shalom as saying, at a meeting with Dutch FM Bernard 
Bot in Jerusalem Wednesday, that Israel wants to see 
the EU place Hizbullah on its list of terrorist 
organizations and wants to see individual European 
governments move faster in legislation outlawing Hamas. 
Referring to the assassination of Sheikh Yassin, Bot 
was quoted as saying: \"We consider targeted killings 
contrary to international law, and in my view a country 
like Israel, a true democracy, should not act like 
this. 
 
Ha\'aretz notes that the PA never allowed the Islamic 
groups to enjoy so much media coverage before Sheikh 
Ahmed Yassin\'s death.  Te newspaper says that the 
change may be a warning to Israel not to kill PA 
Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
 
Maariv quoted a senior legal source as saying that 
Attorney General Menachem Mazuz is expected to rule in 
the bribery case allegedly involving Sharon in two 
months.  Leading media reported that Wednesday Mazuz 
blasted State Attorney Edna Arbel for having leaked her 
intention to submit to him a draft indictment against 
Sharon.  Some media reported that there actually are no 
ill feelings between Mazuz and Arbel. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited the admission by a senior IDF officer 
Wednesday that a slip of the tongue by Sharon six 
months ago about the possibility that Libya could reach 
nuclear weapons capabilities before Iran made the U.S. 
hide its negotiations for Libyan disarmament from 
Israel. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that a resolution seeking 
justice for Jews and other minorities who were 
persecuted, expelled or forced to flee the Arab lands 
of their birth is being introduced into the U.S. Senate 
today. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that an examination of the payrolls 
of the PA\'s National Security Force, considered the 
largest of the Palestinian security forces, commanded 
by Gen. Haj Ismail Jabber, has revealed that salaries 
for 7,000 fictitious troopers -- some USD 2 million -- 
were being paid into his pocket every month. Later, 
Israel Radio reported that Qurei has ordered that from 
now on all salaries will be paid directly to the bank 
accounts of the members of the PA security forces, a 
move long required by donating European countries. 
 
Yediot reported that, in order to counter forgeries, 
Israel will soon issue new passports outfitted with 
electronic chips  -- \"identical to U.S. passports.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that an interministerial committee, 
headed by Justice Minister Yosef (Tommy) Lapid, 
examining the implementation of the Or Commission 
report on the October 2000 riots in the Israeli Arab 
sector, will recommend that the cabinet approve a new 
national holiday -- \"Tolerance Day\" or \"Solidarity Day\" 
-- in celebration of the coexistence of Jewish and Arab 
citizens in the country. 
 
Yediot reported that Tuesday night, at New York City\'s 
Waldorf Astoria Hostel, over USD 4 million were raised 
to benefit the Israeli Soldiers Welfare Association -- 
an all-time record for an Israeli fundraising event. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Abraham Foxman, the national director 
of the Jewish -American organization Anti-Defamation 
League\'s (ADL) as saying that his group will boycott an 
event hosted by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during 
his upcoming visit to the U.S.  Foxman said the move 
was in protest of Egypt\'s boycott of the 25th 
anniversary events of the signing of the peace treaty 
between Egypt and Israel.  Leading media reported that 
Wednesday Egypt\'s Emergency State Security Court 
convicted of espionage Walid Ahmed Lofti Hashim, an 
Egyptian who allegedly faxed military data to the 
Israeli Embassy.  The court sentenced him to 15 years\' 
imprisonment. 
 
All media reported that Wednesday the EU released its 
long-awaited report showing a rise in European anti- 
Semitism.  (A Maariv headline: \"Europe is Bad For 
Jews.\")  The media reported that while the European 
Jewish Congress welcomed the recognition that anti- 
Semitism is growing, it said that the report 
misrepresented the threat from extremist Muslims. 
 
All media reported that four foreign contractors, 
including at least one American, working for the U.S.- 
led coalition in Iraq, were killed in Fallujah, where a 
jubilant crowd dragged their charred bodies and hanged 
them from a bridge.  The media also reported on the 
deaths of five U.S. servicemen in a roadside bombing 
nearby.  Maariv reported that 70 to 100 leading Israeli 
companies are selling their products to Iraq for 
millions of dollars. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that the Swiss 
government has announced it will donate USD 1.8 million 
to help finance a school building for a Jewish-Arab 
school in Jerusalem -- the Bilingual School -- which is 
already operating out of some temporary buildings at 
the Denmark School in the city.

Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized:

\"Distorting the Process\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (April 
1): \"The Likud convention\'s decision to give the party 
rank and file the authority to decide on the fate of 
the Gaza disengagement plan appears to be supremely 
democratic.  In effect, however, it is leading to an 
improper process that distorts the conventional 
tradition of democracy in Israel and creates a 
problematic precedent for the national decision-making 
process.... Historic decisions no less weighty than the 
one to quit Gaza -- including the decisions to go to 
war, and peace agreements -- were made so far in the 
conventional manner of voting in the government and 
Knesset.  What\'s true for a referendum involving all 
the electorate is especially true when it is being used 
in the narrow framework of a political party.... Under 
such circumstances, how will the necessary debate about 
the plan and its details be conducted?  A referendum 
can be helpful for making decisions, when it is derived 
from the political climate of the countries where it is 
conventional.  It usually makes up for too much 
governmental power in the hands of state leaders, and 
sometimes is an expression of direct community 
democracy, at the risk of creating a dictatorship of 
the majority.  It is inappropriate for the Israeli 
system, not at the national level and certainly not at 
the party level.  Using it in the Likud, on the 
disengagement issue, could create a precedent that will 
gravely distort the national decision-making process in 
both this case and in the future.\"

SUBJECT: BEILIN BINDS NEW YAHAD PARTY TO GENEVA ACCORD 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norman Olsen for reason 1.4 (b) and 
(d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: New Yahad Party leader Yossi Beilin left no 
doubt that Yahad and the Geneva Accord are joined at the hip 
when accord co-author Yasser Ahmed Rabbo sat center stage 
with Beilin at the party\'s founding ceremonies on March 31. 
Copies of the accord and Yahad\'s basic covenant were both 
distributed to attendees.  Beilin used the party\'s founding 
reception to attack PM Sharon\'s unilateral disengagement 
plan, and veteran MK Yossi Sarid used it to lambaste what he 
described as Sharon\'s bribery-tainted tenure and to  stress 
his concern for the financially-strapped among Israel\'s 
population.  Beilin is clearly clutching at his 
internationally renowned peace plan prototype to breathe life 
into the new party.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
What\'s Abed Rabbo Got to Do With It? 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Attendees at the March 31 \"Socialist Democratic 
Israel\" (\"Yahad\") Party founding ceremony for the diplomatic 
community entered the auditorium to find newly-elected Yahad 
leader Yossi Beilin seated center stage next to his Geneva 
Accord Palestinian partner Yasser Ahmed Rabbo.  Both Yahad\'s 
\"Basic Covenant\" and the Geneva Accord were distributed to 
guests, flagging that with Beilin at the helm, the Geneva 
Accord is now part of Yahad\'s platform. 
 
3.  (C) Considering his diplomatic audience, it was not 
surprising that in his remarks, Beilin focused on condemning 
PM Sharon\'s unilateral disengagement plan while promoting the 
Geneva Accord, and all but ignoring Yahad\'s economic and 
social agenda except for one reference linking Yahad to the 
greater international socialist movement.  Beilin asserted 
that unilateral actions, such as Sharon\'s proposed withdrawal 
from Gaza, would further isolate Israel from its neighbors, 
creating a \"Jewish ghetto.\"  Israel can not \"go it alone,\" he 
stressed, nor can it negotiate with the Palestinians \"through 
the United States.\"  Beilin opined that there is a partner -- 
symbolized in the person of Abed Rabbo -- and that the Geneva 
Accord is the peace-process solution. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Left-Wing Love-Fest at Founding Ceremony 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C)  The ceremony for Yahad rank-and-file was held in a 
converted Tel Aviv port hanger with a crowd totaling some 300 
Meretz-now-Yahad members who appeared to be mainly 
Yahad-tee-shirt-clad youth, hippie holdovers, and pensioners. 
 Yariv Oppenheimer, Peace Now Director and Labor Party 
activist, manned a distribution table that offered bumper 
stickers stating \"Leave the territories for Israel\'s Sake.\" 
When veteran Meretz MK Yossi Sarid appeared on stage, his 
modest, bespectacled image was tripled on the two enormous 
video screens sandwiching the stage giving the event the aura 
of a rock concert. 
 
5.  (C) Sarid began his speech almost mumbling, appearing 
tired and uninspired, thanking Beilin for taking on the 
challenge of leading Yahad in difficult times, and praising 
defeated leadership candidate Meretz MK Ran Cohen.  Sarid\'s 
voice gained volume, his posture straightened and his whole 
persona puffed up when he laid into his attack against 
Sharon.  He sarcastically noted how strange it is that Sharon 
boasts about knowing many facts and figures, big and small, 
but when it comes to knowing how millions of dollars appeared 
outside the window of his own home (referring to the Greek 
Island and Cyril Kern bribery scandals), Sharon pleads 
ignorance.  Sarid cast Sharon\'s money scandals against the 
backdrop of cash-strapped society where many are struggling 
to pay for the food and wine they will need for the upcoming 
Passover holiday.

Gaza Withdrawal Plan 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Israel Radio reported that, at the conclusion of the 
U.S.-Israeli talks in Washington and Jerusalem, the 
U.S. and Israel have decided, among other things, that 
President Bush and PM Ariel Sharon will exchange 
missives: the U.S. will recognize that there will be no 
return to the 1967 borders, that it will provide 
support and backing to Israel\'s security needs and that 
Palestinian refugees will only return to the future 
Palestinian state, in accordance with Bush\'s vision of 
\"two states for two peoples.\"  The radio reported that 
Israel does not believe in coordinating the Gaza 
withdrawal with the Palestinians and that it views 
recent conciliatory statements by Palestinian PM Ahmed 
Qurei (Abu Ala) as a \"last-minute attempt to jump onto 
the bandwagon in whose wheels both he and PA Chairman 
Yasser Arafat have placed sticks.\"  The radio quoted 
GOI sources in Jerusalem as saying that there is a wide 
consensus that the PA is no longer a partner and that 
Qurei should not be granted a prize after he and his 
people did not do anything to fight terrorism, and that 
they have not stood by their commitments to the road 
map. 
 
The three major Hebrew newspapers (Yediot, Maariv and 
Ha\'aretz) led with separate interviews PM Sharon 
granted them upon the occasion of the Passover holiday, 
and which will appear in their entirety on Monday.  The 
main points of the interviews, as bannered by the 
newspapers, are: 
-Sharon told both Yediot and Maariv that \"by next 
Passover\" Israel will be withdrawing/will have 
withdrawn from the Gaza Strip, and that Arafat and 
(Yediot) Hizbullah Secretary-General Sheikh Hassan 
Nasrallah have no insurance against assassination. 
-He told Yediot that he has ordered an immediate halt 
to the development of Gaza Strip settlements. 
-He told Maariv that Likud is holding contacts towards 
the formation of a national unity government. 
-He told Ha\'aretz that once the separation fence is 
completed, the government will act vigorously to expel 
Palestinians living illegally within Israeli Arab 
communities.  He said that there are tens of thousands 
of such illegal Palestinians in the country. 
 
Most media quoted Qurei as saying, after meeting U.S. 
envoys William Burns, Elliott Abrams and Steve Hadley 
in Jericho Thursday afternoon, that the Palestinians 
are a full and ready partner for the peace process. 
Qurei criticized Israel\'s unilateral moves.    Leading 
media quoted senior PA officials as saying that the 
U.S. has not promised Israel it would unconditionally 
support its disengagement moves.  Hatzofe reported that 
an official in Qurei\'s bureau told the Israeli Itim 
news agency that the U.S. envoys promised the 
Palestinians the U.S. will not support an Israeli move 
that could harm or put aside the issues to be discussed 
towards a final-status agreement -- such as the right 
of return and the status of Jerusalem. 
 
Leading media reported that Thursday Hamas and Fatah 
rejected Qurei\'s appeal to stop terrorist attacks.  All 
media reported that Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades activist 
Jamal Hamamreh and the other militants captured in 
Bethlehem Thursday planned to carry out a large-scale 
terrorist attack during Passover.  Israel Radio 
reported that this morning a column of IDF armored 
vehicles made an incursion in Rafah into the border 
area with Egypt, in an attempt to find smuggling 
tunnels. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Thursday a European 
Parliament body gave the EU Commission an investigatory 
report that concludes that there is \"no conclusive 
evidence\" linking EU funds give to the PA with 
terrorist activity. 
 
Channel 2-TV and Ha\'aretz reported that, according to 
treasury data that reached Meretz Knesset Member Haim 
Oron, a member of the Finance Committee, at least 300 
million shekels (around USD 66.3 million) -- and 
possibly 340 million shekels (around USD 75.2 million) 
-- out of 846 million shekels (around USD 187 million) 
in short-term loans made between 1990 to 2003 by the 
Housing Ministry to housing associations in the 
territories have never been repaid.  Channel 2-TV notes 
that Israelis living within the Green Line who default 
on their mortgage payments are routinely expelled form 
their homes over much lesser debts. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Yossi Beilin, the chairman of the 
new left-wing party Yahad, as saying Thursday that the 
Sharon government is \"destroying the PA and 
strengthening Hamas, so that Israel will have no one 
left to speak with, and nobody to negotiate with.\" 
 
Citing AP, Ha\'aretz reported that the United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said Thursday that it 
has stopped distributing emergency food aid in Gaza 
because of tightened Israeli restrictions at the Karni 
crossing point, the only crossing through which goods 
move between the Gaza Strip and Israel.  This morning, 
Israel Radio reported that the Erez crossing was closed 
due to security warnings. 
 
Leading media reported that Thursday the Jordanian 
security forces were looking for two trucks filled with 
explosives, which had crossed the border from Syria, 
and for four fugitives.  The media cited concerns that 
Israeli and U.S. nationals and institutions could have 
been targeted.  Yediot reported that senior Israeli 
defense officials are \"closely monitoring\" the chase 
after the terrorists, who could try to smuggle weapons 
and explosives into PA-controlled territory. 
 
Maariv reported that Russian elements warned Israel a 
few months ago that several suitcases containing small 
nuclear bombs have reached extremist Chechen Islamists. 
The newspaper, which says that the suitcases were 
apparently stolen in Russia, cited the belief of 
Israeli terror expects that this information is 
insignificant, because of the need to maintain those 
weapons. 
 
Citing documents seized in the territories, Maariv 
reported that Arafat has transferred tens of thousands 
of dollars to Rabbi Moshe Hirsch, the leader of the 
anti-Zionist ultra-Orthodox sect of Neturei Karta. 
[NB: at http://www.nkusa.org/].  The newspaper cited a 
denial by Hirsch\'s son Yisrael. 
 
Maariv reported that the Iraqi Governing Council has 
expressed its support for compensation to former Iraqi 
Jews, and that it will soon allow Jews of Iraqi origin 
to resettle in the country starting in June.  However, 
Israel Radio quoted the chairman of the Organization of 
Jews from Arab Countries in Israel as saying that Jews 
from Arab countries will not be entitled to reclaim 
their property. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Sunday Maj. Gen. Elyezer Shkedy 
will officially take over from Maj. Gen. Dan Halutz as 
commander of the IAF. 
 
Ha\'aretz (English Ed.) reported that Pups For Peace, a 
Los Angeles-based organization, has donated 30 sniffer 
dogs to the Transportation Ministry and Israeli police 
force. 
 
Yediot quoted former British intelligence agent 
Alistair Crooke as saying that, since the \'80s, Sheikh 
Ahmed Yassin had initiated peace plans with Israel. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Thursday the Israeli Arab 
leadership cautiously welcomed a proposal by Justice 
Minister Yosef Lapid to designate a national day 
devoted to citizenship and coexistence between Jews and 
Arabs.

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: \"These are 
Sharon\'s three nos: no to negotiations, no to 
international plans, no to the status quo.  There is no 
disengagement here, at least not in the first years, 
but there is certainly a change.\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Uzi Benziman opined in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"The picture that has emerged 
thus far (before the [U.S.-Israeli] discussions

Israel wants to institute in its wake.\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv: \"So, [Sharon], vigorously 
urge [your son] Omri and his friends to do what they

decisions is effective organization.  This time for a 
good cause.\"

States\' Middle Eastern policy.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"The Three Nos\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (April 2): \"The 
[disengagement] move, says Sharon, \'will establish in 
writing a firm American position that rules out any 
plan that would endanger Israel.\'  What else?  It will 
relieve Israel of responsibility for the lives of 1.8 
million Palestinians, from whom the donor countries are 
threatening to cut off support, and will deny the 
Palestinians the argument that due to the occupation 
they are unable to act against terror.  And it will 
return the initiative to us.  \'There is nothing worse 
than having Israel dragged into taking steps due to 
international pressure.\'  These are Sharon\'s three nos: 
no to negotiations, no to international plans, no to 
the status quo.  There is no disengagement here, at 
least not in the first years, but there is certainly a 
change.\" 
 
II.  \"Territorial Imperative\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Uzi Benziman opined in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 2): \"The picture that has 
emerged thus far (before the [U.S.-Israeli] discussions 
Thursday) is one of clear American support for the idea 
of the withdrawal and the security arrangements that 
Israel wants to institute in its wake.... The 
discussions revolved, in effect, around tailoring the 
disengagement plan to the American political agenda and 
to the conceptual framework the administration has 
created regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
The United States has been dragged into supporting 
Sharon\'s initiative because it has been convinced there 
is great importance to his willingness to pull out of 
the Gaza Strip.  But it has anchored its support in its 
own declared view on the resolution of the conflict. 
It has chosen to do so through the formulation of a 
presidential position that will take the disengagement 
plan into account, but will refrain from accompanying 
this with a practical quid pro quo.  In any case, the 
withdrawal will not be carried out before the U.S. 
elections.\" 
 
III.  \"Hot Referendum\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (April 2): \"The referendum 
only intended for the exclusive club of registered 
Likud voters is the least of all evils.... The 
referendum is good for the supporters of the unilateral 
withdrawal, who believe that Ariel Sharon has lost the 
political strength and the personal authority to impose 
his plan on his party.... The referendum is also good 
for the opponents -- actually, not for those whose 
ideological objection is a pure one.... It is 
comfortable for Binyamin Netanyahu, Silvan Shalom, 
Danny Naveh and Tzachi Hanegbi.  Arik will take out the 
chestnuts from the fire for them.... So, [Sharon], 
vigorously urge [your son] Omri and his friends to do 
what they really know to do -- the name of the game in 
crucial decisions is effective organization.  This time 
for a good cause.\" 
 
IV.  \"Withdrawal With Nothing in Exchange\" 
 
Former editor-in-chief Moshe Ishon wrote in 
nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe (April 2): \"Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon, who is clinging to a unilateral 
withdrawal plan, knows Washington\'s policy extremely 
well.  He is not deluding himself that [his senior aide 
Dov] Weisglass could achieve the \'impossible.\'  But, 
because of pressure being put on him from all sides, 
mainly in the domestic arena -- by the Likud movement - 
- he has decided to apply his entire influence in order 
to obtain any achievement in Washington.  His efforts 
have failed thus far.... Even the perk that he hoped to 
get in Washington is hanging by a thread.  In actual 
fact, it doesn\'t exist.  Condoleezza Rice has made 
clear that there won\'t be any change in the United 
States\' Middle Eastern policy.  The issue of borders, 
including the status of Jerusalem, will be determined 
in direct talks between the parties -- Israel and the 
Palestinians.\"

SUBJECT: IN PASSOVER INTERVIEWS, SHARON WARNS ARAFAT, 
AFFIRMS DISENGAGEMENT, SHRUGS OFF SCANDALS 
 
 
1. (SBU) Israel\'s three major dailies previewed April 2 the 
separate Passover interviews with PM Sharon that each will 
publish on April 5.  The previews highlighted three of 
Sharon\'s themes: 
 
-- Targeting Arafat and Nasrallah: In the wake of Israel\'s 
assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Yassin, neither Arafat 
nor Hizballah leader Nasrallah has \"insurance against 
targeting.\"  \"I wouldn\'t suggest either of them feels 
immune.... Anyone who kills a Jew or harms an Israeli 
citizen, or sends people to kill Jews, is a marked man. 
Period.\" 
 
-- Gaza Disengagement: \"By next Passover we will be deep into 
disengagement.\"  The PM insisted that he made the decision to 
disengage from Gaza and that he is determined to see it 
through: \"No one influenced me and no one convinced me. 
That\'s nonsense.  Arik convinced Sharon and Sharon convinced 
Arik.  It\'s my decision and I intend to carry it out.\"  The 
PM did not expect terrorist attacks against Israel to stop 
after disengagement, but did hope for a reduction.  In any 
event, Israel\'s war against terror would continue, and even 
step up, after withdrawal from Gaza.  The PM stated that the 
GOI does not intend to damage the electrical or water 
infrastructure of areas to be evacuated, and that it would 
continue to supply electricity and water to Gaza even after 
disengagement.  The GOI would reconsider this service, 
however, if terror attacks continue from Gaza after Israel 
withdraws. 
 
-- Possible Indictment: \"I believe in my full and complete 
innocence.\" \"I\'m certain there won\'t be an indictment.\" \"I\'m 
functioning normally.\" 
 
2. (SBU) Apart from their Sharon interviews, the three 
dailies do not appear to have any other Passover interviews 
of political significance in store.  Ma\'ariv will publish an 
interview with incoming IDF Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Halutz. 
 Ma\'ariv will also present an interview with former PM Barak, 
but the blurb promoting the interview does not suggest Barak 
conveying anything more than a makeover of his unlovable 
image.  Below a photo, framed in daisy petals, of a smiling 
Barak clutching purple anemones appears the teaser: \"Ehud 
Barak reveals all.... The interview we\'ve all be waiting for 
in which the former PM speaks about his separation from Nava 
(ex-Mrs. Barak), about Nili (the new girlfriend), about 
aging, fears, emotional autism and the mistakes of the past.\"

Classified By: Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer for reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres told Ambassador 
Kurtzer unequivocally April 2 that Labor \"could not stay out\" 
of the coalition if and when PM Sharon invites Labor to join. 
 Responding to a scenario where Sharon loses the two 
right-wing coalition partners over a cabinet vote on 
unilateral withdrawal and needs to form a new coalition that 
supports withdrawal, Peres answered rhetorically: \"Are we so 
crazy as to stop withdrawal and settlement dismantlement? 
This (withdrawal) is what we wanted.\" 
 
2.  (C) As to losing Labor MKs over a decision to join with 
Sharon, Peres scoffed at any notion that Amram Mitzna would 
leave, concluding that the only sure defector would be 
Labor\'s Avraham Burg, who, Peres quipped, was \"beyond 
recognition.\"  \"What happened to him?\" Peres asked 
quizzically. 
 
3.  (C) Peres voiced dissatisfaction with the evolving 
substance of Sharon\'s disengagement plan, noting that he was 
disappointed with the \"diet\" the plan had gone through since 
it was initially proposed.  He asserted that Sharon would not 
settle for Israeli control over just the three major West 
Bank settlement clusters, but would seek control over other 
portions of the West Bank as well.

SUBJECT: BOI Reduces Interest by 0.2% in March 
 
 
This cable is classified Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) On March 29, the Bank of Israel announced a 0.2 
percent reduction in interest rates.  This brings the Bank 
of Israel interest rate to 4.1 percent and represents the 
thirteenth consecutive interest rate decline since the end 
of March, 2003.  In the press release accompanying its 
latest rate decision, the BOI indicated that its current 
monetary policy would continue as long as inflation is 
consistent with its inflation target of 1 - 3 percent. 
Although Histadrut leader Amir Peretz criticized the cut as 
too small, most commentators praised it as economically 
helpful.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Surprise: Klein Cuts and Hints May Keep Cutting 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (U) Prior to the latest interest rate announcement, a 
number of economists and market analysts predicted the BOI 
would call a halt to its monthly rate cuts.  They noted the 
rate had already neared 4 percent, and claimed that during 
2004 the US and Israel were likely to begin raising interest 
rates.  In a fairly surprising turn of events, the BOI 
decided to continue cutting, if just by 0.2 percent.  The 
Bank, in its March 29 press release, justified the move by 
noting that its interest rate policy is geared towards 
bringing inflation in line with the range of price 
stability, 1 - 3 percent a year.  It noted that inflation 
expectations were still below the lower limit of the target, 
at around 1.2 percent. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
BOI Boo Boo: It Missed Target in Both 2002 and 2003 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3. (U) In its 2003 annual report, published March 30, the 
BOI acknowledged years of criticism for having consistently 
missed its inflation target in 2002 and 2003.  The report 
attempts to deflect this criticism, however, by referring to 
numerous exogenous factors that made the target ever more 
elusive:  sudden changes in exchange rates, the development 
in Israel of an inflationary mentality, receipt of the U.S. 
Loan Guarantees, the rapid end to the War in Iraq.  The BOI 
notes that the policy backdrop in 2003, when the GOI 
embarked on a serious program of economic reform, was 
completely contrary to that in 2002, which was marked by 
uncertainty, increased inflation, and a return to higher 
interest rates. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Amir Peretz Kicks a Gift Horse in the Teeth? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Commentary on the BOI cut was, for the most part, 
muted.  Histadrut leader Amir Peretz however, denounced it 
as \"too little too late,\" and said households continue to be 
harmed by high rates.  He told Haaretz in the March 30 
edition that a reduction in interest should have been part 
of an overall joint economic plan between the Histadrut, the 
GOI and employers intended to accelerate growth and increase 
the number of jobs. 
 
5.  (U) Others were significantly more positive in their 
remarks.  Chairman of the Economic Committee of the 
Manufacturers Association, Rimon Ben Shaul, told Haaretz in 
the same March 30 article that the BOI acted correctly in 
continuing to reduce interest and should continue to do so 
in the coming months.  Shaul noted \"this would help in 
strengthening the recovery trend.\"  He added that a 
\"necessary condition for continuing to reduce interest rates 
is strictness in maintaining the budget and deficit target.\" 
 
------------------------------------------- 
BOI: 4 Percent Deficit in 2004 \"Attainable\" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The BOI noted in its press release that \"assessments 
of the development of fiscal policy over the year suggest 
that the budget target set by the government at 4 percent of 
GDP is attainable.\"   This is a far cry from BOI\'s past 
criticism of GOI laxness regarding fiscal responsibility, 
and testament to the newfound BoI-MoF policy consensus on 
fiscal issues.

REF: CAIRO 2601 
 
Classified By: DCM Richard LeBaron for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
 
 1. (C)  Summary and Action Request.  Gabbi Bar, Deputy 
Director General in the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor 
confirmed to us April 2 that Israel and Egypt had agreed to 
11.7% minimum Israeli content for all Egyptian QIZ products. 
Bar said the next step is a meeting in Athens April 14, where 
the two sides will try to hammer out a draft agreement.  Both 
sides hope the United States will send a representative to 
this meeting. The GOI will insist that the agreement consist 
of one document to be signed by the U.S., Egypt and Israel. 
The GOI hopes this can happen in May, perhaps at the World 
Economic Forum meeting in Jordan.  Bar said GOE officials 
indicated to him that President Mubarak may raise QIZs with 
President Bush during his visit to the U.S. in April.  Bar 
said that because word is already out about the tentative 
deal with Egypt, the GOI hopes to release a press statement, 
with GOE concurrence, within the next few days. 
 
2.  (C) Embassy would appreciate guidance from Washington on 
Bar\'s request that USG representatives attend the planned 
April 14 meeting in Athens.  If Embassy Tel Aviv and/or 
Embassy Cairo representatives attend, we will need 
instructions about their role, if any, in drawing up a draft 
agreement.  USTR may also need to make clear to the parties 
earlier rather than later in what form the U.S. would 
participate in the Israeli/Egyptian agreement.  We may also 
need press guidance once the Israel-Egyptian deal reached 
March 30 becomes public.  End Summary and Action Request. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
\"Permanent\" Deal Reached on Israeli Content 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Bar confirmed the terms of the deal reached between 
Israel\'s Minister of Industry, Trade and Labor Olmert and 
Egypt\'s Minister of Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali 
(reftel).  He said that both sides had agreed on a 
\"permanent\" 11.7% Israeli minimum content level for all 
Egyptian QIZ products.  Undoubtedly, he said, Egypt would try 
to bargain the content level down at some future date.  The 
Israeli intent, however, was to keep the content level at 
11.7% for the foreseeable future.  (Note: the minimum Israeli 
content in the Jordan QIZs is 8%.) 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Next Steps - A Meeting in Athens April 14; 
A Trilateral Signing in Jordan? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C)  Bar said Egypt was anxious to conclude an agreement 
as soon as possible.  Both sides agreed to meet in Athens, 
April 14 (Bar said this was the earliest practical date for 
the GOI in light of the Passover holidays).  Bar said the two 
sides would try to draw up a draft agreement in Athens that 
could be presented to their respective ministers and to the 
U.S.  Bar said both Egypt and Israel hope U.S. 
representatives can attend the meetings.  Officials from 
Embassy Tel Aviv and Cairo would be welcome, and a USTR 
representative would \"be ideal.\"  Bar said U.S. participation 
was crucial because the agreement would be trilateral in 
nature - signed by the \"trade ministers\" of the U.S., Egypt 
and Israel.   Bar said the GOE knows that Israel will insist 
on this trilateral formulation and will not accept \"parallel\" 
agreements between the U.S. and Egypt and the U.S. and Israel. 
 
5.  (C)  If all the details could be worked out in April, 
continued Bar, the GOI hoped the final agreement could be 
signed in May.  One possible venue for a trilateral signing, 
he said, might be the World Economic Forum meetings in Jordan 
May 15-17.  Ministers Olmert and Boutros Ghali will be there, 
and he assumed USTR Zoellick would attend.  MOIT Deputy 
Director General Ronit Kan would try to contact USTR shortly, 
he said, to discuss a possible meeting and signing. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Multiple Zones from the Outset? 
Mubarak to Raise QIZs with President Bush? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C)  Bar said one key unresolved issue is the number of 
QIZs that will be established.  Egypt, he said, wants to 
designate up to seven zones (consisting of already built-up 
factory areas) as QIZs from the outset.  Israel, said Bar, 
has not taken a position on the issue.  Bar understood, 
however, that USTR preferred to start with only one or two 
zones at first.  Bar said that Egyptian contacts had told him 
that President Mubarak might raise the issue of multiple 
zones during his April meeting with President Bush. 
----------------------------------------- 
GOI Wants to Issue a Press Statement Soon 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Bar said the GOI had tried to keep the discussions 
with Egypt out of the press.  However, several key Israeli 
businesspersons with interests in Egypt (such as textile 
magnate Dov Lautman) were already aware of the deal on 
Israeli content.  More worrying was the fact that Israel\'s 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (through its embassy in Egypt) 
had caught wind of the deal.  Bar said he had refrained from 
divulging information to MFA or the Israeli Embassy in Cairo 
because of the fear of leaks.  Bar said that since word about 
the deal was spreading, it was almost certain to be reported 
in the Israeli media soon.  Given these circumstances, 
Minister Olmert wants to issue a press statement by April 3 
(Sunday) or April 4.  Bar said Olmert would raise the issue 
with Boutros Ghali by phone.

1.  (SBU) Summary: One Palestinian was killed April 2 in a 
heavy exchange of fire that erupted between IDF soldiers and 
Palestinian militants during an IDF incursion into the 
al-Salaam area of the Rafah refugee camp.  On April 1, UNRWA 
said in a press release that it was suspending delivery into 
Gaza of food aid for Palestinian refugees due to the 
unresolved issue of removing empty shipping containers from 
Gaza (see reftel and Tel Aviv septel).  UNRWA said that 
failure to remove the empty shipping containers while still 
bringing in full ones would result in a bottleneck and 
prohibitive demurrage costs.  In the West Bank, Israeli 
police shot six Palestinians with rubber bullets and injured 
about 30 other Palestinians with tear gas in response to 
stone-throwing by some worshippers at the Haram al Sharif 
complex April 2.  The police made 20 arrests.  Settlers in 
Hebron beat up a Palestinian boy April 1, and threw stones at 
an Arab bus in the northern West Bank, lightly injuring two 
babies, according to press reports.  End Summary.

6. (SBU)  ATTACKS: 
 
-- Death: UNRWA reported that one Palestinian was killed 
April 1 during an IDF incursion into the al-Salaam area of 
the Rafah refugee camp (see \"Incursions\"). 
 
-- Injuries: Nil.

7.  (SBU) INCURSIONS/DEMOLITIONS: 
-- UNRWA reported that IDF tanks and jeeps entered the Rafah 
refugee camp at approximately 0020 hours April 2, reportedly 
to search for tunnels used for the smuggling.  Palestinian 
militants fired on the troops and one Palestinian man was 
shot and killed in the ensuing heavy crossfire.  The 
operation was ongoing as of 1400 hours April 2. 
 
8.  (SBU) BORDER CROSSINGS/CHECKPOINTS: 
 
-- Route Four (Salahadeen Road), the main north-south traffic 
artery, was open for Palestinians. 
 
-- Erez Crossing was closed to Palestinians laborers April 2, 
but open for merchants over 28 years of age.  The number of 
merchants crossing April 2 was unavailable.  The IDF also 
allowed diplomats in vehicles and internationals on foot to 
cross.  UN agencies, however, refuse to authorize their 
non-diplomatic staff to cross on foot; staff must wait to 
cross until they can join someone crossing in a diplomatic 
vehicle.  The Erez Industrial Zone was closed April 2 due to 
a security alert, according to Israeli media. 
 
-- Sufa Crossing was closed for Palestinian laborers April 2, 
but open for the import into Gaza of aggregates used in 
construction. 
 
-- Karni Terminal was partially open for the import and 
export of goods into the Gaza Strip.  Unpacked goods may 
enter, but no Palestinian shipping containers may enter or 
exit.  On April 1, UNRWA said in a press release that it was 
suspending delivery into Gaza of food aid for Palestinian 
refugees due to the unresolved issue of removing empty 
shipping containers from Gaza (see reftel and Tel Aviv

PRIORITY WATCH LIST DESIGNATION 
 
REF: STATE 71498 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
 1.  (C)  Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, Trade 
and Communications Ehud Olmert called the Ambassador late 
April 1 to complain about reports that the USG intended to 
put Israel back on the 301 Priority Watch List.  Olmert said 
such an action would be unjustified.  Olmert noted that he 
had promised the Ambassador and visiting Under Secretary of 
Commerce Juster that the pharmaceutical data protection issue 
would be solved.  As for the other main IPR issue of concern 
to the U.S. - national treatment for sound recording rights 
holders - Olmert said the GOI was in the process of drafting 
a letter from Minister of Justice Tommy Lapid.  That letter 
would say that the protection of U.S. royalty rights under 
our bilateral treaty was being studied.  The letter would 
affirm the GOI\'s intention to protect royalty rights for U.S. 
music recordings, he said.  Olmert said the GOI was very 
unhappy about being asked to take actions on IPR under the 
threat of an unfavorable 301 decision, especially in light of 
the positive actions the GOI has already said it would 
undertake. 
 
2.  (C)  The Ambassador noted that the USG had not yet 
received Lapid\'s letter, nor had any official decision on 
data protection been communicated to the USG.  The Ambassador 
also noted that he had been instructed to send a demarche to 
Minister Olmert and Minister Lapid outlining our IPR concerns 
(reftel).  (Note:  That demarche and an accompanying letter 
from the Ambassador were sent to the ministers on April 2.) 
The Ambassador advised Minister Olmert to ensure the GOI 
acted upon our concerns as soon as possible, in order to 
resolve these contentious IPR problems once and for all.

Classified By: Pol/C Norm Olsen, per 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: UNRWA April 1 announced the suspension of 
its emergency food distribution program in the Gaza Strip. 
UNRWA Deputy Director of Operations in Gaza, Krister Nordahl 
confirmed to Poloff April 2 that UNRWA, frustrated by what it 
sees as the IDF\'s refusal to find any interim measures to 
check outgoing shipping containers (reftel), refused in turn 
to import more food to replace now-exhausted stocks until the 
problem is resolved.  The IDF has blocked all containers 
leaving Gaza since two suicide bombers used a hidden 
compartment in a container to smuggle themselves out of Gaza 
and into Ashdod, killing 10 Israelis.  COGAT representative 
Daniel Beaudoin assured ECON/C the evening of April 1 and 
again on April 2, however, that the IDF\'s new security 
systems would be in place o/a April 4 at the Karni Crossing, 
thus allowing at least some of UNRWA\'s empty containers to 
exit the Gaza Strip and the food program to re-start. 
Although differences remain between the two sides as to the 
number of containers that will be allowed, at least 
initially, out through Karni, if the COGAT date of April 4 is 
met, the negative impact of the suspension on beneficiaries 
should be minimal.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
UNRWA Suspends Food Program in Gaza 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) UNRWA announced April 1 the suspension of its 
emergency food aid program in the Gaza Strip due to the GOI\'s 
continuing refusal to allow the movement of empty shipping 
containers out of Gaza.  The problem, which had been building 
since two Gaza suicide bombers smuggled themselves into 
Ashdod port March 14 and killed 10 Israelis, came to a head 
March 26 when UN agencies first went public (reftel).  A 
series of discussions between GOI and UNRWA officials the 
week of March 29 failed to resolve the issue, according to 
Krister Nordahl, UNRWA Deputy Director of Operations in Gaza. 
 Nordahl confirmed to Poloff April 2 that, although the IDF 
will/will allow UNRWA food containers to be shipped into 
Gaza, the IDF (citing the double suicide bombing at Ashdod) 
was still not/not allowing any containers -- empty or 
otherwise -- to be shipped back out until improved security 
measures are in place at Karni Terminal and IDF staff receive 
the appropriate training in their use.  Nordahl said that, in 
light of the IDF\'s position and the demurrage charges 
accruing from blocked containers, UNRWA had no choice but to 
cease imports. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Situation Not Yet Catastrophic, and Might be Resolved Soon 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Nordahl explained, however, that not all 600,000 
UNRWA emergency food beneficiaries (128,000 families) would 
be affected immediately.  The food distribution cycle rotates 
over a 45-day period; those who received their food parcels 
in the last cycle would be fine for the next 45 days. 
Furthermore, Nordahl said he had been told the evening of 
April 1 by COGAT that the GOI expected to have the improved 
systems in place o/a April 4, after which five shipping 
containers per day could exit through Karni.  The program 
requires the importation, however, of 20 containers (250 tons 
of foodstuff) per day to meet beneficiaries\' needs. 
 
-------------------------------- 
COGAT Working to Fix the Problem 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (C)  Daniel Beaudoin, head of the COGAT\'s Foreign 
Relations Branch, confirmed to ECON/C on April 1 that the IDF 
was hoping to have new security systems in place at Karni 
within days and that the IDF is in the process of training 
personnel to screen the empty containers.  When ECON/C 
contacted Beaudoin again April 2, he said the new screening 
would definitely begin Sunday, April 4.  He said he did not 
know how many containers would be released per day, but 
insisted \"it would be more than five.\"   Beaudoin 
acknowledged that UNRWA needed the release of 20 containers 
per day to do its job adequately. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (C)  UNRWA has drawn the battle lines clearly on this 
issue and is holding firm in its position vis-a-vis the IDF: 
no new containers to go in until the IDF lets the empties 
out.  UNRWA was frustrated by what it saw as the IDF\'s 
refusal to find any interim measures, such as visual 
inspection of the simple plate steel containers.  By going 
public and increasing the pressure, UNRWA clearly hopes to 
force the GOI to act, and may have at least partially 
accomplished this if COGAT\'s assurances to us are any 
indication.  UNRWA seems satisfied -- for the moment -- with 
COGAT\'s assurance that the containers will begin moving no 
later than April 4, and thus the negative impact on 
beneficiaries will be relatively small.  If that date should 
slip or the number of shipping containers remains severely 
limited, however, that negative impact would rapidly 
increase. 
 
6.  (U)  UNRWA Press Release. 
 
Begin Text of UNRWA April 1 Press Release: 
 
UNRWA suspends emergency food aid to Gaza 
 
Gaza - The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) today stopped distributing 
emergency food aid to some 600,000 refugees in the Gaza 
Strip, or approximately half of the refugees receiving UNRWA 
food aid in the occupied Palestinian territory, following 
restrictions introduced by Israeli authorities at the sole 
commercial crossing through which the Agency is able to bring 
in humanitarian assistance.  Stocks of rice, flour, cooking 
oil and other essential foodstuffs that UNRWA provides to 
refugees reduced to poverty, or otherwise affected by a 
humanitarian crisis now in its 42nd month, have been fully 
depleted. 
 
Efforts to persuade the Israeli authorities to lift the 
restriction on the transport of UNRWA\'s empty food containers 
out of Gaza have so far failed, forcing the Agency to suspend 
the delivery into Gaza of 11,000 tons of food from Ashdod 
port to avoid a bottleneck which would result in prohibitive 
costs.  Under normal circumstances, UNRWA delivers some 250 
tons of food per day in Gaza alone as part of a wider program 
of emergency assistance to refugees, initiated shortly after 
the outbreak of strife in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 
September 2000.  Since then, the Gaza Strip has been locked 
into a deep socio-economic crisis resulting from the 
prolonged closure of its border with Israel, the destruction 
of thousands of homes as well as of agricultural and local 
industrial assets.  Almost two out of three households in 
Gaza live below the poverty line,  and more than half its 
work force is unemployed. 
 
UNRWA is not alone in facing chronic obstacles to the flow of 
humanitarian assistance.  These have been experienced by all 
UN agencies operating in the West Bank and Gaza, whose Agency 
heads in a joint statement on March 26 called, without 
success, on the GOI to loosen the restrictions currently in 
force in Gaza. 
 
UNRWA Commissioner-General Peter Hansen said: \"The suspension 
of UNRWA\'s emergency food aid in the Gaza Strip will further 
distress communities already struggling to cope with 
unrelieved economic hardship and malnutrition.  If the new 
restrictions in Gaza continue, I fear we could see real 
hunger emerge for the first time in two generations. 
Israel\'s legitimate, and serious, security concerns will not 
be served by hindering the emergency relief work of the 
United Nations.  I appeal to the authorities to lift these 
restrictions and enable us to resume our food distributions 
in Gaza.\"

TAGS: EAID, KPAL, KWBG, ASEC, IS, GAZA DISENGAGEMENT, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS, HUMANITARIAN AID 
SUBJECT: RECOMMENDATIONS ON MAJOR GAZA/WEST BANK USAID 
PROJECTS IN LIGHT OF SECURITY SITUATION 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b), (d). 
 
This is a joint message from Ambassador Kurtzer, 
Consul-General Pearce and USAID Director Garber. 
 
1. (C)  Summary/Recommendations:  On January 30, Chiefs of 
Mission in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and the West Bank/Gaza 
USAID Mission Director decided jointly to put an eight-week 
hold on four USAID projects to allow time to: 1) measure 
progress in the investigation of the October, 2003 murder of 
our security personnel in Gaza; 2) measure progress in 
Egyptian-sponsored security planning; and 3) evaluate whether 
it would be possible to manage major projects without 
participation of American citizen employees or contractors. 
The projects put on hold were the Gaza water carrier and 
desalination plant, the Bani Naim water project in the West 
Bank, and emergency road repair projects affecting mostly 
Gaza.  On March 26, the same group met and concluded that 
virtually no progress could be reported in the murder 
investigation and the Egyptian security plan has been put on 
hold as the instability and insecurity in Gaza has grown in 
the last eight weeks.  On the third issue, it is not 
desirable but it is possible to waive virtually all use of 
direct hire or contractor Amcit personnel in carrying out the 
projects. 
 
2. (C) Recommendations:  The Embassy, ConGen, and USAID 
Mission differ on next steps, and offer three distinct 
recommendations: 
 
--  The Embassy, (with overall responsibility for U.S. 
government activities in Gaza), believes that given the 
continued lack of progress in the Gaza murder investigation, 
and the continuing lack of workable security arrangements in 
Gaza, the USG should suspend the Gaza water carrier and 
desalination projects, as well as road repair in Gaza.  While 
the conditions in the West Bank are not as bad as in Gaza, 
the Embassy also believes that suspension of the Bani Naim 
water project will send an important signal to the 
Palestinian Authority.  The Embassy is deeply concerned that 
to go on with business as usual will signal to Palestinians 
that no cost is associated with killing Americans in Gaza. 
 
--  The USAID Mission for the West Bank and Gaza believes 
that the Bani Naim and road projects should go forward and 
would have either the two water projects proceed subject to 
starts and stops due to security concerns, or reprogram the 
money for other uses in the West Bank/Gaza assistance effort. 
 The USAID mission believes other means could be used to 
leverage progress on the investigation, that operations could 
proceed through actively managing security concerns, and that 
the greater U.S. interest is in averting a humanitarian 
crisis in Gaza, which could contribute to even greater 
instability.  The USAID mission believes it can adequately 
address the oversight issues within very severe security 
constraints on travel by AMCIT direct hire or contract 
personnel. 
 
--  The Consulate-General, (with overall responsibility for 
Jerusalem and the West Bank as well as the policy dialogue 
with the Palestinians), agrees for security reasons with 
Embassy recommendation that the Gaza water and road projects 
be deferred or canceled.  But it concurs with USAID that the 
Bani Naim water project should proceed, using local 
contractors to the maximum extent possible, and subject to 
ongonig monitoring of the security situation.  Similarly, the 
proposed West Bank road projects, on which local contractors 
will do the work, should proceed.  The ConGen notes that the 
USG threat to suspend or cancel assistance projects in the 
WB/Gaza has had virtually no demonstrable impact on the 
security behavior of the PA, and questions whether actual 
cancellation will provide additional leverage.  If all the 
projects are canceled without distinguishing among the 
differing level of risk each poses, we may send not only a 
signal to the PA on security, but also a signal to the 
Palestinian populace that the USG does not care about its 
basic humanitarian needs.  It could also signal the donor 
community that the USG is disengaging from assistance, which 
could spark similar actions by other donors and worsen the 
situation on the ground. 
 
Given contractual decisions that must be made on the water 
carrier project in the very near future, we request prompt 
Washington consideration of this matter.  Posts will supply 
any additional inputs required. 
 
(End Summary/Recommendations) 
 
--------------- 
Security Issues 
--------------- 
 
3.  (C) In early December of last year, the USG put the 
Palestinians on notice on the relationship between security 
issues and our ability to carry out major USAID projects. 
This theme has been reiterated constantly since to senior 
Palestinian interlocutors.  At the meeting of the Ad Hoc 
Liaison Committee (for Palestinian assistance) held in Rome 
on the 10th of December, NEA Assistant Secretary Burns told 
the group: 
 
I want to speak plainly about the importance the United 
States attaches to investigating the murder of three of our 
diplomatic colleagues in Gaza last fall.  We are still 
waiting for results in that investigation.  Without progress, 
culminating in the arrest and conviction of those 
responsible, we simply cannot carry out our full range of 
assistance projects for the Palestinian people.  Without a 
more secure working environment, moving forward with large 
scale programs -- such as the long-planned Gaza water 
infrastructure projects, and millions of dollars in road 
repair money ready to be disbursed in the spring -- will be 
impossible. 
 
Neither of the two conditions stated by A/S Burns had been 
met when we reviewed them as of January 30 and neither has 
been met two months later.  Promises of major developments in 
the investigation have been made at some junctures with no 
results.  A security court trial of suspects, who may or may 
not have been directly involved, was scheduled and then 
canceled.  The investigation is further hindered by lack of 
trust and coordination between the Palestinian security 
services.  Arafat\'s role has been at best unclear; at times 
he has given orders to spur further action while at other 
times he has reportedly viewed the investigation as a 
political enticement with which to lure the USG back into a 
relationship with him. 
 
4.  (C)  Meanwhile the overall security environment in Gaza 
has deteriorated, with the Palestinian security leaders 
advising for the last three months that they are not in 
control and that travel by U.S. Government personnel in Gaza 
remains quite risky.  The killing of Sheikh Yassin further 
exacerbated the situation, with perceptions among many 
Palestinians that the USG condoned the killing.  At this 
time, no direct hire American staff are being permitted to 
travel inside Gaza, and with new threats at Erez, we have 
even stopped meetings just inside the border at the Abu 
Eskander guest house.  USAID American citizen contractors are 
sharply limiting their travel into Gaza.  Even travel by 
contractors could be halted if the missions in Tel Aviv or 
Jerusalem decided that it was no longer sustainable in a 
relatively safe manner. 
 
-------------------------------- 
The Projects and Their Oversight 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The Gaza water projects will be the largest projects 
USAID has embarked on in its support for the Palestinians. 
The water carrier and desalination plant in Gaza are expected 
to cost about $65 million each.  Given the current security 
situation in Gaza, the prospect of direct-hire American staff 
being allowed to travel to Gaza to exercise oversight of 
these projects is very questionable.  USAID Washington has 
already agreed that these projects could be carried out with 
a very limited number of trips by U.S. direct hire staff. 
For example, perhaps only a trip by contracting officer and 
engineer at the end of the water carrier project (i.e., in 
2006 or 2007) to certify the project would be technically 
required.  Also the Gaza regional water carrier project could 
be broken up into smaller pieces and involve more local 
contracting.  While it would be preferable to have an 
American contractor providing engineering oversight on a 
daily basis, particularly the desalination plant, it would be 
possible, according to USAID Director, to waive such a legal 
requirement should it be decided to proceed under adverse 
security conditions, and to insist that the contractor retain 
instead a U.S.-trained, non-American engineer.  Obviously the 
absence of U.S. direct hire personnel to inspect and certify 
progress would not be ideal, but with a talented local staff 
and a qualified construction management firm Mission is 
willing to accept the risk.  (USAID Mission advises that 
USAID Washington is also prepared to accept the risk.) 
Oversight requirement would be more easily manageable for the 
Bani Naim project in the West Bank, and the roads projects 
could be carried out with very limited Amcit involvement. 
 
--------------------- 
Policy Considerations 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  A robust assistance program, combined with 
diplomatic efforts to assure funding for the needs of the 
Palestinians, has been a consistent element of U.S. policy. 
This vector has been maintained even as the USG has assessed 
that the near term chances of significant progress on the 
political issues are minimal.  We have strongly supported 
revenue transfers by the Israelis.  We have urged other 
donors to address Palestinian needs, and we have done all we 
can to support reformers in the PA.   Thus, any decision to 
defer or forego a significant element of our assistance 
program would send a negative signal to the Palestinian 
reformers and to the donor community.  On the other hand, 
moving ahead with major projects absent resolution of the 
Gaza murders and a creation of a more secure environment 
would send a message to the Palestinian leadership and 
Palestinian terrorists that there is no cost for killing 
Americans.  However, we do not claim any success so far in 
use of an implicit \"stick\" in eliciting progress in the 
investigation or in prompting Palestinian security 
improvements.  Those PA reformers who understand the impact 
of such a decision have little or no influence on security, 
and those in charge of security and the investigation have 
little or no appreciation for the costs of canceling the 
projects.  We cannot rule out, however, that a clear cut-off 
of substantial programs would have a greater impact than our 
warnings to this effect have had so far. 
 
----- 
Costs 
----- 
 
7.  (C) The direct costs associated with any suspension of 
the four projects are minimal.  The water carrier project is 
the most advanced and would require an approximately $300,000 
cancellation fee and associated costs in demobilizing the 
construction management firm\'s operations here.  Such costs 
must of course be weighed against the security premiums 
associated with protective measures that would be required to 
carry out the projects in Gaza at this time.  We have not 
identified any significant costs related to the deferral of 
the other three projects. 
 
8. (C)  We recognize fully the humanitarian costs in not 
addressing or delaying solutions to the dire water situation 
in the WB/G, particularly in Gaza.  However, if we cannot be 
at least somewhat assured that these projects to alleviate 
the water problems can be carried out in safety, we would 
face both excessive construction costs and the prospect of 
more costly cancellation at a later date due to security 
problems.  Other donors are likely to be influenced by a 
suspension; some have scaled back their exposure in Gaza 
already.  In general, it will be more difficult to mobilize 
support for Palestinian needs, a role the United States has 
played for many years. 
 
---------------- 
Requested Action 
---------------- 
 
9.  (C)  We cannot take final decisions on these matters in 
the field.  The significant policy questions require a full 
airing in Washington and we will supply further inputs and 
elaborated arguments as requested for such consideration.  We 
would ask that such a deliberation take place as soon as 
possible, given the advanced stage of the contracting process 
for the Gaza Regional Water Carrier in particular and the 
need to issue an RFP for Bani Naim within the next couple of 
weeks, or risk losing $15 million in FY03 funds.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
PM Sharon was quoted as saying in a Passover-eve 
interview with Israel Radio: \"Those who kill Jews and 
order to kill Jews because of the fact they are Jews 
deserve to die.  Any self-respecting country facing 
murderers and their dispatchers must defend itself -- 
exactly like the U.S. and any country respecting 
itself.\"  He was reiterating the view he expressed in 
the weekend newspapers that PA Chairman Yasser Arafat 
does not have insurance from assassination.  During the 
weekend, leading media quoted Deputy Secretary of State 
Richard Armitage as saying Friday: \"Our position on 
such questions -- the exile or assassination of Yasser 
Arafat -- is very well known.  We are opposed and we 
have made that very clear to the government of Israel.\" 
Sharon also said in the interview that it will be 
easier to understand his disengagement plan once the 
U.S. has given something in exchange for it, a gesture 
which he said would be presented during his upcoming 
meeting with President Bush. 
 
Sunday, Ha\'aretz reported that Israel and the U.S. have 
nearly completed the formulation of the official notes 
that Sharon and Bush will exchange during their meeting 
on April 14.  The newspaper quoted diplomatic sources 
in Jerusalem as saying, \"only words and a few emphases\" 
are left open.  The newspaper says that Sharon will 
declare his intention to bring his disengagement plan, 
as has been presented by the media, to the cabinet for 
approval, and express his commitment to the road map. 
According to Ha\'aretz, in Bush\'s note, the U.S. will 
declare its commitment to the road map.   The newspaper 
quoted Israeli sources as saying that it will guarantee 
there will be no alternative plan and no diplomatic 
progress if the Palestinians do not tackle terrorism. 
Ha\'aretz further reported that Bush will also promise 
Israel support in the war against terror and aggressive 
action, if the attacks from the evacuated territories 
persist.  Ha\'aretz reported that at this time the U.S. 
refuses to deal with the issue of a permanent 
agreement.  Sunday, Maariv reported that the U.S. has 
launched an initiative to turn Sharon\'s disengagement 
plan into an international plan to which the UN, the 
EU, the Quartet and Arab states (Egypt and Jordan) are 
party, and which will be implemented in close 
coordination with the Palestinians.  Maariv reported 
that in an attempt to promote this plan, talks are 
underway to coordinate a meeting between Sharon and UN 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan (which may be held in 
 
SIPDIS 
April in New York).   Maariv said that Israeli 
officials would like to obtain UN recognition of its 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip as the \"end of the 
occupation\" of the Gaza Strip, and the U.S. has 
enlisted to help achieve that goal. 
 
Leading media reported that Sunday, at the cabinet 
meeting, Sharon lashed out at right-wing cabinet 
ministers Effi Eitam and Benny Elon, who are opposed to 
the disengagement plan.  Sunday, Yediot reported that 
the government will offer a basket of benefits to 
settlers who are evicted from their homes as a result 
of the disengagement plan, provided they choose to 
resettle in the Negev. 
 
Maariv quoted Sharon as saying that Israelis \"cannot 
take two tracks.\"  Sharon was explaining the absolute 
veto he put on the possibility of renewing negotiations 
with Syria, in contrast to the opinion of the security 
establishment.  The newspaper reported that, 
officially, however, Israel conveyed a message to Syria 
last week that it is willing to renew negotiations 
without preconditions, with an emphasis on terror in 
the first part of the talks. 
 
During the weekend, all media reported that over 40 
Palestinians were wounded during altercations on Friday 
at the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem.  Leading media 
reported that the unrest started when a preacher at the 
Al Aqsa mosque incited against Israel. 
 
Sunday, all media led with the killing on Saturday 
morning of a settler  -- a father of six -- by a 
terrorist in Avnei Hefetz (West Bank).  Hamas and 
Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the murder, 
saying it was in retaliation for the assassination of 
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin two weeks ago. 
 
Leading with the situation in Iraq, Jerusalem Post 
reported, as did the other media, that anti-coalition 
demonstrations evolved into gun battles on Sunday in 
Iraq, leaving at least 15 people dead and over 200 
people wounded, leading some Iraqi Governing Council 
officials to fear civil war.  The media reported that 
eight U.S. soldiers were killed in Iraq during the 
weekend. 
 
Convicted spy Jonathan Pollard was quoted as saying in 
a \"first, face-to-face\" interview with Yediot\'s Shimon 
Shiffer that Israel had betrayed him. 
 
Jerusalem Post featured a long interview with the Irish- 
American writer Frank McCourt, the author of the 
Pulitzer-winning memoir \"Angela\'s Ashes.\"  McCourt 
recently visited Israeli as part of a State Department- 
sponsored \"cultural ambassador\" program. 
 
During the weekend, all media reported that former 
minister of security affairs in the PA Cabinet called 
for Arafat\'s resignation in interviews with the 
international media.  Some Israeli media reported that 
he recanted. 
 
Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that Thursday British 
PM Tony Blair offered a defense of Israel\'s 
assassination of Yassin, though he did not excuse it 
wholeheartedly. 
 
Sunday, Yediot reported that Israeli cabinet ministers 
and other senior figures are required to remove their 
shoes and undergo body searches at airports in the 
United States.  The newspaper quoted sources close to 
Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres as saying that he did 
not regard the search as humiliating and that he has no 
problem with it.  Former prime ministers Ehud Barak and 
Binyamin Netanyahu have been subjected to the same 
treatment.  Yediot quoted another minister, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, as saying that that if 
Secretary of State Colin Powell or any member of the 
 
SIPDIS 
U.S. cabinet were treated in this way at Ben-Gurion 
airport, there would be an uproar.  The newspaper 
quoted a source at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv as 
saying that said there is no procedure making such 
searches obligatory, and that the problem lies in lack 
of communication between the body that invited the 
Israeli VIP and the authorities at the airports. 
 
All media reported that Sunday Attorney-General 
Menachem Mazuz decided not to charge Vice PM Ehud 
Olmert for bribery in the \"Greek island\" affair, in 
which Sharon is allegedly involved. 
 
Sunday, Maariv and other media cited Powell\'s admission 
Friday that the \"most dramatic\" claim in his speech to 
the UN Security Council weeks before the war -- that 
Iraq had mobile biological laboratories -- appeared to 
have been based on faulty information.

Senior op-ed writer Uzi Benziman opined in Ha\'aretz: 
\"Sharon ... has stirred suspicions that, just as he 
doesn\'t hesitate to bandy about empty threats to kill 
Arafat, despite his promise to Bush, he is capable of 
entangling the president of the U.S. in a far-ranging 
diplomatic initiative that he has no real intention of 
carrying out.\"

                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Distracting the Public\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (April 
5): \"Sharon\'s attempt to deflect the attention of the 
public from his legal troubles and political failings 
by drawing attention to the negative role of Arafat, 
and by threatening to harm the Palestinian Authority 
leader, is quite ludicrous.  It\'s an empty threat 
because Sharon has promised Bush no harm will come to 
Arafat.  If there were any doubts about the binding 
nature of this commitment, American spokespeople, both 
senior and official, have declared that Washington is 
opposed to killing Arafat, or to his expulsion, and 
that Israel is aware of this opposition.... The Bush 
administration is willing to bypass him, but not take 
his head. Sharon is expected to know this and he shows 
no respect for the citizens of Israel with his 
exaggerated war cries that contradict the reality.  The 
knowledge that the most detailed plans may be 
overthrown by a deadly terrorist attack must fill the 
government of Israel with greater urgency toward making 
a combined move to fulfill its obligations -- finding 
security for Israelis by, among other things -- the 
security fence following as closely as possible the 
delineation of the Green Line; the evacuation of 
illegal outposts and settlements, whose removal is 
already supposedly acceptable to Sharon; improving the 
conditions of the innocent Palestinian population that 
is not involved in terrorist activities; and 
approaching moderate Palestinian groups.  If Israeli 
policy were handled this way, it is perfectly possible 
that the national mood could be much improved by 
Passover next year.\" 
 
II.  \"So What If Sharon Said It?\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Uzi Benziman opined in Ha\'aretz 
(April 4): \"Sharon\'s behavior raises the possibility 
that he\'ll be willing to gamble about Bush\'s support, 
even as he involves the U.S. president with his 
separation plan.  At first glance, the separation plan 
seems to have emerged in the security-diplomatic 
sphere, and it is in this context that Sharon seeks the 
U.S. government\'s cooperation; but Sharon\'s current 
unbridled, reckless rhetoric creates suspicions that 
perhaps the separation initiative was also a ruse, 
designed to create a facade of a major diplomatic 
maneuver while its true purpose was to improve Sharon\'s 
own personal position, as he faces the police and the 
attorney general.  In fact, statements are being made 
today in Israel about how the corruption case against 
Sharon ought to be ignored, in view of the \'historic 
policy\' that is to be enacted in the Gaza pullout. 
Sharon himself has stirred suspicions that, just as he 
doesn\'t hesitate to bandy about empty threats to kill 
Arafat, despite his promise to Bush, he is capable of 
entangling the president of the U.S. in a far-ranging 
diplomatic initiative that he has no real intention of 
carrying out.\" 
 
III.  \"\'Peace Now\' Supporting Sharon\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (April 4): 
\"At the end of the week, Ha\'aretz reported that the 
extremist left-wing movement \'Peace Now\' has decided to 
launch a public campaign in support of Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon\'s disengagement plan.  It is not so many 
years since that movement held a demonstration holding 
posters with the slogan \'Sharon is a Murderer.\'  Ariel 
Sharon has already closed the circle.  In the past few 
months he has become the darling of the Israeli left. 
\'Peace Now,\' which is the most extremist, deluded, 
element of the extreme left, has warmly welcomed 
Sharon\'s plan.  In effect, judging by the platform of 
that movement, Sharon has outflanked it  -- and also 
Beilin\'s Geneva initiative -- on the left.... Beilin is 
reportedly demanding that the Likud, in its paid-up 
members\' referendum, should vote not only on Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan but also on his [Beilin\'s] Geneva 
plan.... When the Likud rank-and-file come to vote on 
the Sharon plan, they will have to stop and think for a 
moment.  They will have to ask themselves whether they 
really agree to the Likud\'s implementing the program of 
\'Peace Now.\'  Think about it, Likud members.  Was it 
for this that you joined this movement?  To realize the 
world view of \'Peace Now\' the most extremist left-wing 
movement in Israel?\"

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"Fortunately, the Uzbek leadership has responded [to 
terrorist attacks] with the kind of resolve that Spain 
has avoided.... [But] it is one thing to fight an

                     ------------- 
 
\"Trouble in Turkestan\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(April 4): \"International terrorism barged last week 
[in Uzbekistan], with a series of bombings that have 
killed more than 40 people in Tashkent and Bukhara, and 
wounded dozens more.  For the terrorists, the aim here 
is obvious.  Uzbekistan, under the leadership of 
communist-era boss Islam Karimov, has allowed the 
establishment of American military bases on its soil, 
thus offering the U.S. a vital springboard into nearby 
Afghanistan.  As they have done in Spain last month, it 
seems that America\'s enemies are out to attack its 
allies in the war on terrorism.  Fortunately, the Uzbek 
leadership has responded with the kind of resolve that 
Spain has avoided, making it plain that it will meet 
the terrorists in the battlefield rather than seek ways 
to understand and appease them.... [But] it is one 
thing to fight an Islamism whose declared goal is the 
restoration of medieval theocracy.  It is an entirely 
different thing to delay the arrival of political 
modernity.\"

invited two right-wing ministers to leave the coalition if 
they are not comfortable with its policies, demonstrating 
Sharon\'s confidence that Labor is waiting in the wings to 
replace these ministers\' parties (ref A).  Sharon\'s display 
of bravado also sends a signal to Likud disengagement 
opponents that he feels confident his plan will gain a 
majority of Likud support in the upcoming party referendum, 
thereby putting pressure on undecided or opposing Likud 
ministers to back the plan.  The main wild card for Sharon 
continues to be AG Menachem Mazuz, who must decide whether to 
indict Sharon in the \"Greek Island Affair.\"  End summary.

Sharon and Olmert Take on Eitam and Elon

2.  (C) In a display of bravado and impatience with vocal 
disengagement opponents, PM Sharon reportedly announced at 
his April 4 cabinet session that those ministers 
uncomfortable with his unilateral disengagement plan \"can get 
up and leave\" the government.  Sharon\'s outburst, as reported 
in the major daily Yedioth Ahronoth, was directed at National 
Religious Party (NRP) Minister of Construction and Housing 
Effi Eitam, whom Sharon accused of misrepresenting facts, 
including on Eitam\'s visits abroad.  (Note: Eitam has been a 
vocal opponent of Sharon\'s disengagement plan.)  Defending 
Sharon\'s criticism of Eitam, Deputy PM Ehud Olmert pointed 
out that it was \"improper to criticize the PM in working 
visits abroad.\"  National Union Tourism Minister Benny Elon, 
who has unabashedly criticized Sharon\'s plan domestically and 
abroad, defended Eitam, asserting that opponents could 
criticize the plan until it was adopted by the government. 
Referring to himself and Eitam, Elon added that \"we will 
leave the government if the government\'s decision (on the 
plan) does not satisfy us.\"  With that, Sharon responded \"you 
really don\'t have to be here.\" 
 
---------------------------- 
Referendum Campaign Heats Up 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) As lines in the sand are drawn by Sharon in his 
cabinet, Likud disengagement opponents are revving up a PR 
campaign to convince Likud members to vote against Sharon\'s 
plan in a party referendum to take place around mid-May (ref 
C).  Two out of Likud\'s 14 ministers -- 
Ministers-without-Portfolio Uzi Landau and Natan Sharansky -- 
are spearheading the \"no\" campaign along with several Likud 
MKs.  The Jewish settler movement and another Likud lobby are 
also reportedly organizing their own anti-disengagement 
campaigns, with one under the banner \"Likudniks don\'t 
disengage.\"  At the same time, D/PM Olmert announced on April 
2 that he would be launching a campaign to gather support for 
the disengagement plan. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
4.  (C) Sharon\'s raw exchange with Elon and Eitam indicates 
that he may be willing to take off the gloves as he enters 
the home stretch for his disengagement plan\'s survival and 
his own political survival in the face of a possible bribery 
indictment.  As Sharon made clear in his Passover interviews, 
he is counting on U.S. assurances gained during his April 14 
meeting with President Bush to help him win the hearts and 
minds of Likud members in the upcoming referendum.  With 
Likud rank-and-file support, he could then consolidate Likud 
ministerial support for his plan in a Cabinet vote.  Sharon 
stated in his Passover interview with Ma\'ariv that he already 
believes that FinMin Netanyahu \"will ultimately support (the 
plan) as will many other ministers....\"  There is 
considerable speculation that Sharon has already worked out a 
deal with Shimon Peres for Labor to join with Likud after a 
cabinet vote approving the plan compels the NRP and NU to 
leave the coalition (ref A).  The only wild card for Sharon 
is AG Mazuz, who is now reportedly liable to take two months 
to reach an indictment decision, enough time, perhaps, for 
Sharon to shepherd his plan through the Likud, the government 
and perhaps the Knesset.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/05/2014 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, IS, ECONOMY AND FINANCE, U.S.-ISRAEL RELATIONS 
SUBJECT: NETANYAHU ANNOUNCES MAJOR TAX REDUCTION PROGRAM 
AND HIS DG ASKS FOR CORRESPONDING CHANGES TO LOAN GUARANTEE 
AGREEMENT 2004 TERMS SHEET 
 
 
-------- 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
1. (U) On Sunday, April 4th, Finance Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu held a press conference at which he announced the 
third major tax reduction initiative of his tenure.  It 
foresees the following changes in tax and investment laws: 
-- personal income taxes, primarily for low-income workers, 
would fall significantly by July 2004; 
-- corporate income taxes would fall from 36% to 30% by 2007; 
-- taxes on construction materials such as steel, iron and 
bathroom fixtures would fall, a move aimed to stimulate this 
lagging sector of the economy; 
-- industrial investments would be encouraged through tax 
code changes. 
 
2.  (C) Netanyahu estimated the cost of these changes at NIS 
1.2 billion in 2004 and NIS 2.3 billion in 2005, which he 
said would be more than offset by tax revenue surpluses in 
both years.  Netanyahu\'s political opponents say the move is 
purely political in nature and sets the stage for a potential 
race for the Prime Minister\'s job, should PM Sharon falter in 
his Gaza disengagement plan moves.  Most aspects of 
Netanyahu\'s initiative require government and Knesset 
approval: at the earliest the income tax and corporate tax 
cuts would not go into effect before the second half of 2004. 
 Although most press reaction to the plan has been positive, 
our contacts at the Bank of Israel expressed concern that 
Netanyahu is taking a risk in spending revenues that have not 
yet been booked. 
 
3.  (C) The plan also appears to run counter to 
understandings reached at the 2004 Joint Economic Development 
Group meeting, in which Netanyahu promised U.S. officials 
(including Under Secretary Larson and Treasury Under 
Secretary Taylor) to use extra revenues both to reduce taxes 
 
SIPDIS 
and also to reduce Israel\'s significant debt levels, which 
have reached 105% of GDP.  This supposition is supported by 
new changes requested by the MoF to the Loan Guarantee 
Agreement (LGA) 2004 Terms Sheet, outlined in paragraph 13. 
End Summary. 
 
-------- 
The Plan 
-------- 
 
4. (U) Netanyahu\'s tax reduction plan is the third since he 
became Finance Minister a year ago.  The first was contained 
in his economic reform plan of March 2003, and accelerated 
the provisions of the Rabinovitch Tax Reform Plan that cut 
upper bracket marginal income tax rates.  The second, which 
was announced February 11, 2004, reduced VAT by 1% from 18% 
to 17%, reduced purchase taxes on consumer durables, and 
eliminated customs on certain food items. 
 
5.  (U) The April 4 plan, according to Netanyahu, is 
primarily intended to put more money in the pockets of wage 
earners in the NIS 4,000 to NIS 10,000 gross salary level, as 
well as bring down corporate taxes over a four year period. 
The main aspects of the plan are: 
 
- Reduction in income tax.  Wage earners earning NIS 4,000 a 
month will receive an additional NIS 59 a month, or NIS 708 
per year.  Those earning NIS 7,000 would receive an 
additional NIS 180 a month, resulting in NIS 2,160 a year, 
and those earning NIS 10,000 would receive an additional NIS 
70, equal to an additional NIS 840 a year.  This part of the 
plan requires Cabinet and Knesset approval.  Netanyahu 
nonetheless said he hoped implementation could go into effect 
by July, 2004. 
 
- Gradual reduction in corporate income tax from 36% today to 
30% in 2007.  Netanyahu said he was aiming to bring corporate 
tax rates more into line with OECD countries. Taxes would 
decline by 1% in 2004 to 35%, another 1% in 2005 to 34%, and 
2% each year in 2006, and 2007, reaching 30% in 2007.  This 
also requires Government and Knesset approval. 
 
- Cancellation of purchase taxes on construction-related raw 
materials, including steel, iron, and equipment for bathrooms 
and kitchens. This move is meant to stimulate the building 
and construction sector. Netanyahu announced that this step 
would go into effect immediately. 
 
- Reforms in Investment Encouragement Law.  These measures 
would aim to make industrial investments more attractive, and 
would include tax benefits totaling NIS one billion for 
investments in periphery areas.  The new law would require 
new legislation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
How He Did It: Excess Revenues Continue Pouring In 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6. (SBU) How could Netanyahu afford to take this expensive 
step?  The Minister estimated at his press conference that 
GOI tax revenues are likely to be NIS 2 billion higher than 
originally forecast for 2004.  This follows an April 2 MOF 
report on first quarter 2004 tax revenues showing that March 
receipts totaled NIS 13.7 billion, a real increase of 11% 
from March 2003.  Tax revenues for the first quarter of 2004 
totaled NIS 38.6 billion, a real increase of about 12% over 
the NIS 35.2 billion in revenues in the first quarter of 
2003.  This windfall, Netanyahu said, would more than cover 
the costs of the plan, which he estimated at NIS 1.2 billion 
in 2004, and approximately NIS 2.3 billion in 2005.  He broke 
down the 2004 costs as follows: 
-- income tax cut: NIS 650 million; 
-- decline in company tax: NIS 400 million; 
-- construction encouragement: NIS 150 million. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Netanyahu\'s Economic Worldview versus David Klein\'s 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7. (SBU) Netanyahu\'s philosophy of using additional tax 
revenue to finance tax reductions is not universally accepted 
in Israel.  Although BOI Governor Klein agrees with Netanyahu 
that additional tax revenues should not be used to increase 
government expenditures, he has repeatedly noted that this 
money should be used to reduce Israel\'s high level of public 
debt, which totaled 105 percent of GDP in 2003.  This is 
significantly higher than the 78 percent average of OECD 
countries and 73 percent of EU countries.  The BOI expressed 
this sentiment most clearly in a March 4 press release, 
noting that the debt/GDP ratio is one of the key indicators 
of an economy\'s stability in the eyes of foreign investors. 
Klein followed this on March 30 in his cover letter to the 
BOI\'s 2003 annual report, in which he wrote that additional 
tax revenues should be used to repay debt rather than further 
reducing taxes, as Israel\'s tax burden is approximately 39%, 
similar to OECD levels.  In Klein\'s view, reducing the debt 
burden would result in lower interest payments, enabling 
lower interest, which would encourage investment, and support 
growth.  In addition, Klein said that reduced debt servicing 
would allow for more money to be used for social-economic 
purposes. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Reaction: Politics, or Good Economics? 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) The political opposition was quick to criticize 
Netanyahu\'s proposal.  Avraham \"Beiga\" Shochat, former 
Labor-party Finance Minister, said in a radio interview April 
4 that, although tax cuts are a good thing, the tax windfall 
should have been used to pay salaries to local authority 
workers who have not received salaries in months, as well as 
using it for education, health, and welfare.  This was a 
reflection of the plan\'s political nature.  Shochat\'s views 
were echoed by a number of other commentators. 
 
9. (SBU) Yosi Bachar, Director General of the Finance 
Ministry argued in an April 5 radio interview that the 
measure is intended to help lower wage earners.  He said that 
it is MOF policy to return extra tax revenues to Israeli 
citizens. He said the GOI\'s policy is consistent and clear ) 
to encourage people to go to work, so that they will have 
more assets in their hands, not to increase public 
expenditures. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Bank of Israel Reaction to Plan: It\'s a Risk 
MOF Responds: No It\'s Not 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) The BOI\'s Research Division Chief, Karnit Flug, spoke 
to us April 4 about the new plan.  On the one hand, she said 
that it followed \"a legitimate path,\" particularly in view of 
the tendency of \"political systems to spend revenue 
surpluses.\"  She nonetheless highlighted three dangers: the 
GOI would be spending revenues that have not yet been booked; 
the plan precludes needed reductions in GOI debt levels; it 
does not help the very poor, who work but do not pay taxes. 
Although Flug thought the GOI could still meet its 2004 
deficit target of 4% under the new plan, she believed that 
meeting the 2005 deficit target of 3% was a \"big problem.\" 
 
11.  (C) In a subsequent conversation with MoF DG Bachar, who 
called Deputy ECON Counselor to discuss changes to the Loan 
Guarantee Agreement 2004 Terms Sheet (see para. 13) related 
to the new plan, Bachar argued that the plan was necessary 
and timely.  \"Our highest priority is to make certain that 
politicians will not spend without control.\"  He noted that 
the USG and the GOI were \"coming from the same place\" in 
efforts to reduce taxes.  He also stressed that the 
additional growth resulting from the new tax regime would 
lead to significant additional growth that would do more to 
reduce debt reduction than any other GOI step. (Note: 
presumably including direct debt reduction).  As for 2005, 
Bachar said that the GOI remains committed to attaining its 
deficit target that year, although he admitted doing so would 
require \"major expenditure cuts.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (C)  Neither Netanyahu nor his MoF staff provided the 
Embassy advance notice of his tax reduction plan, which 
appears to run counter to promises the MoF made to Under 
Secretaries Larson and Taylor at the recently concluded 2004 
 
SIPDIS 
Joint Economic Development Group meetings in Jerusalem.  At 
the meetings, both the Minister and his DG agreed to use 
additional revenues to achieve two goals, tax reduction and 
debt reduction.  Netanyahu\'s plan appears to run counter to 
that understanding.  In an April 4 conversation with Embassy 
economic staff, MoF DG Bachar said the MoF desired to make 
more significant changes to the draft 2004 LGA terms sheet to 
take account of the new Netanyahu plan.  He requested that 
Washington approve these changes as soon as possible, as the 
GOI wishes to go to market April 19.  Embassy Economic 
Section staff, which has sent the text of the requested 
changes to Washington for review, noted the extent of the 
changes, and the fact that the language in question had been 
directly negotiated with the Under Secretaries during the 
recent JEDG.  Bachar said he understood and looked forward to 
Washington\'s reaction to the changes.  He noted that he could 
be contacted until the evening of April 6, at which point he 
would go on leave until April 20.  Bachar noted he was 
designating Budget Director Yuri Yogev to act in his stead 
with regard to the Terms Sheet during Bachar\'s absence. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Bachar\'s Requested Loan Guarantee Agreement Changes 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
13. (C)  On April 4, DG Bachar sent Deputy Economic Counselor 
his edits to the LGA 2004 Terms Sheet.  We have forwarded 
these edits by e-mail to both State/IPA and to Treasury. 
(Note: These are in addition to one change made earlier in 
the month by Minister Netanyahu to the third tic in the first 
section of Appendix 4 referring to reducing the GOI\'s wage 
bill).  The GOI\'s proposed Terms Sheet, including Bachar\'s 
changes, is included below.  Bachar made three changes to the 
Terms Sheet; they are 
1.  Appendix 4, Section 2, Third Tic: Delete second sentence, 
\"Due emphasis should be given to deficit reduction.\" 
2.  Appendix 5, Section 1, Table 1, Defense Consumption: 
Replace NIS 48.1 billion with 48 billion. 
3.  Appendix 5, Section 2, Second Tic, Number 2:  Replace 
phrase \"forecasted expenditure growth and to actual 
expenditure outturn\" with \"original budget plan to the 
previous year.\"

Modifications to and Determinations of Specific Reforms 
Details in Annex II of the Loan Guarantee Commitment Agreement 
 
The Joint Economic Development Group (JEDG), as the joint 
consultative mechanism referred to in Section 5.03 of the 
Loan Guarantee Commitment Agreement, and proceeding under 
Section 4.02 of the Loan Guarantee Commitment Agreement, 
determines and modifies the specific reforms referred to in 
Section 4.02 by appending the following as Appendices 4 and 5 
of Annex II. 
 
 
CONDITIONS FOR DISBURSEMENT OF THE SECOND TRANCHE OF 
SUPPLEMENTAL ASSISTANCE 
 
The second tranche of bond guarantees in the amount of up to 
$3.0 billion will be released on determination of completion 
of the following: 
 
1.  Progress on Reform Plan: Progress on the main measures of 
the GOI economic reform plan.  This plan includes, among 
other things, reforms related to: 
 
-- Acceleration of tax reform: Continued progress on final 
implementation of tax reforms (legislated in the Knesset in 
2002) by January, 2006; 
-- Pension Reform: Continued long-term reduction in issuance 
of special government bonds for pension funds; 
-- Continued reduction of public sector,s budgetary expense 
on the wage bill as a percentage of GDP, to be achieved 
mainly by reducing public sector employees. 
 
2.  Meet Spending and Budget Deficit Targets. 
-- Commit to expenditures (defined in Appendix 5) in 2004 of 
no more than 226.1 billion New Israeli Shekels, with the firm 
goal of keeping the budget deficit to 4.0 percent of GDP or 
less. 
 
-- Public dissemination and GOI commitment to a detailed, 
multi-year fiscal plan, including a commitment to limit real 
expenditure growth (defined in Appendix 5) to 1 percent per 
year from 2005 to 2010.  Furthermore, commitment to maintain 
budget deficits to a level of less than 3 percent of GDP and 
aim to implement further reductions in the operational 
deficit of at least 0.5 percent of GDP every year until the 
deficit reaches 1 percent of GDP. 
 
-- Any revenues in excess of those foreseen in the 2004 
budget would be allocated to deficit and tax reduction. 
 
3.    Proceed with Privatization Plan 
-- Further progress on the main measures of the Israeli 
government,s privatization plan.  Future privatization steps 
should focus on the twin goals of increasing competition as 
well as reducing government involvement in the economy. 
 
4. Implement Structural Reforms: 
-- Increase competition in the economy by: 
--    Implementing liberalization of the domestic 
telecommunications market through a regulatory environment 
that facilitates the introduction of competitive local 
landline services within the timeframe of this agreement; 
--    Working to increase competition within the ports, 
financial markets, and electricity sectors; 
--    Reduce governmental regulation with the aim of 
promoting economic growth. 
--    Continue efforts to further strengthen IPR protection 
in Israel. 
 
5. Undertake Infrastructure Investments 
-- Commitment to, and progress on $1 billion in 
infrastructure spending as discussed in the GOI,s economic 
reform plan. 
 
6. Other 
-- The amount of guarantees that may be issued shall be 
reduced by an amount equal to the amount extended or 
estimated to have been extended by the GOI during the period 
from the last deduction to the date of issue of the 2004 
guarantee, for activities which the President determines are 
inconsistent with the objectives and understandings reached 
between the United States and the Government of Israel 
regarding implementation of the loan guarantee program. 
-- Commit to working with the U.S. Government to resolve 
outstanding procurement issues. 
 
SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENTS 
 
Subsequent disbursements of bond guarantees will be 
conditioned upon determination and implementation of the 
GOI,s macroeconomic, structural and other targets developed 
through the USG-GOI joint consultative mechanism.  Fiscal 
targets and implementation of the reform plan will be the 
main foci.  In particular, disbursements of the third tranche 
of bond guarantees will be conditioned on achievement of the 
spending and budget deficit targets for 2004 and 2005.  The 
extent to which other commitments made for the 2004 
disbursement are met will also be an important consideration.

SUBJECT: SPECIAL 301 DEMARCHE GETS QUICK GOI ATTENTION 
 
REF: STATE 71498 
 
Classified By: CDA Richard LeBaron for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
 1.  (C)  Summary:  Aaron Abramovitch, Director General of 
Israel\'s Ministry of Justice, told Econ/C April 5 that the 
GOI was \"surprised and confused\" by the USG statement that it 
planned to raise Israel to Special 301 Priority Watch List 
status unless action is taken on data protection and 
copyright protection for U.S. rights holders in sound 
recordings (reftel).  Abramovitch said a \"Directors General 
Committee\" would meet soon after the Passover holidays to 
decide whether to accept experts\' committee recommendations 
on data protection.  If the recommendations are accepted, the 
GOI will share them with the USG in mid- or late-April.  The 
GOI has taken no official position, he said, on whether U.S. 
sound recordings are covered by our bilateral copyright 
agreement.  Indeed, royalties continue to be paid. 
Abramovitch said the GOI wants to engage in consultations 
with USTR copyright experts as soon as possible in order to 
help resolve the issue.  Abramovitch passed us a letter from 
Ministers Olmert (Industry and Trade) and Lapid (Justice) 
responding to letters from the Ambassador and Under Secretary 
Larson on IPR issues (text in paragraph 7).  Olmert and Lapid 
have also arranged a meeting with Charge April 14 to discuss 
these issues prior to the April 16 deadline noted reftel. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Abramovitch said the GOI was surprised by reftel 
demarche, in which the USG said it intended to raise Israel 
to Priority Watch List unless actions were taken on data 
protection and copyrights for U.S. music rights holders. 
Israel, he said, has taken great strides on IPR enforcement. 
The USG stance is \"confusing,\" he said, in that the level of 
IPR protection in Israel is much higher than in countries 
typically considered for Priority Watch List.  He hoped that 
the U.S. would look at Israel\'s total performance, not just 
at one or two issues of concern. 
 
--------------- 
Data Protection 
--------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Abramovitch noted that the GOI had been looking 
carefully at its data protection regime for the last year, 
and was now in a position to recommend changes.  An experts\' 
committee had submitted a report to the Directors General of 
the Ministries of Justice, Industry and Trade, Finance and 
Health.  The Directors General Committee planned to meet soon 
after the Passover holidays.  If the Directors General accept 
the recommendations, they will be forwarded to Ministers. 
Finally, Knesset approval for any changes in law will be 
required.   Abramovitch said he could not share the draft 
recommendations with us now, but would be able to do so once 
they were approved at the DG level.  He said the 
recommendations would \"answer your concerns,\" but cautioned 
that we should not expect that the recommendations would be 
exactly what the international pharmaceutical industry has 
asked for, because of the need to craft rules \"that will 
work\" and that the Knesset will support. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
National Treatment for U.S. Phonogram Producers 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.  (C)  Abramovitch said he recognized that the GOI 
submission to USTR on the sound recording issue had not been 
received very favorably.  The GOI had been forced into a 
corner, he said, by the USG insistence that the GOI make a 
clear statement about the protection of phonograms under the 
1950 bilateral agreement.  In response, the GOI sought a 
legal opinion from an outside source.  The GOI has not 
endorsed that opinion (which states that music recordings may 
not be covered by the agreement).  On the other hand, the GOI 
cannot ignore the opinion and state in writing (as the USG 
has asked) that the bilateral agreement covers phonograms. 
The GOI desires instead, he said, to engage in consultations 
with the USG about the copyright issue and the scope of the 
bilateral agreement.  It is important to note, he continued, 
that royalties continue to be paid to US music producers, and 
the GOI has no plans to argue that royalties should not be 
paid.

Letter from Olmert and Lapid; Meeting with Charge Planned 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
5.  (SBU)  Abramovitch said Minister of Industry and Trade 
Olmert and Minister of Justice Lapid had not yet had a chance 
to carefully review reftel demarche, although both had been 
apprised on its contents.  Olmert and Lapid, he said, wished 
to meet with Charge as soon as possible after Passover (and 
before the April 16 deadline mentioned in the demarche) to 
discuss the upcoming Special 301 Review.  A meeting has 
tentatively been set for April 14. 
6.  (SBU)  Abramovitch passed Econ/C a letter from Ministers 
Olmert and Lapid to the Ambassador in response to 1) a letter 
the Ambassador had written to the ministers March 11 on the 
music recordings issue noted above and 2) a letter from Under 
Secretary Larson detailing USG concerns about IPR issues. The 
 
SIPDIS 
texts of that letter and an accompanying letter to USTR on 
the music recordings issue follow in paragraphs 7 and 8 
below.

Begin text: 
 
\"April 4, 2004 
 
His Excellency Mr. Daniel C. Kurtzer 
Ambassador 
Embassy of the United States of America 
 
Dear Ambassador Kurtzer: 
 
Thank you for your letters of March 11th and March 29th, 
2004.  It appears that there have been misunderstandings 
regarding some intellectual property issues, and we would 
like to take this opportunity to clarify those issues. 
 
As you know, over the past few years the Government of Israel 
(GOI) has exerted enormous efforts to enhance its 
intellectual property regime.  The GOI remains committed to 
fulfilling its international obligations regarding 
intellectual property rights, building on its past proven 
successes in effective enforcement and in the promotion of 
investment and trade. 
 
We note first that during the past year Israel has continued 
vigorously to combat IP related violations in all its forms, 
dedicating substantial and increasing resources to strong and 
cooperative efforts by Israeli police and customs officers, 
prosecutors, judges, legislators and diplomats.  Israel\'s 
significant progress during the past year is detailed in the 
extensive report submitted by the GOI to the U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR). 
 
Israel\'s intellectual property regime is a modern and 
effective one, more so than the systems of many countries 
that do not appear in any category of the \"watch list\".  We 
need not belabor the point that being placed on a U.S. \"watch 
list\" may have strong ramifications, economic or otherwise, 
for a country that is so listed.  Therefore we urge the U.S. 
to view Israel\'s system in its entirety, and not merely in 
the context of one or two outstanding issues. 
 
In that context, we would like to address the two issues you 
raised - phonogram producers and data exclusivity - and, we 
hope, to allay your concerns regarding those issues. 
 
Regarding phonograms, the GOI\'s newly published draft 
copyright bill is, needless to say, intended to be consistent 
with all relevant international obligations.  That issue and 
others are elaborated in a letter sent by Adv. Howard 
Poliner, of the GOI\'s Ministry of Justice, dated March 26, 
2004, to Mr. Edmund Saums of the Office of the USTR, a copy 
of which is attached hereto. 
 
We believe that the protection of phonograms is an important 
and complex issue that requires a thorough and good faith 
examination.  The GOI has stated that it will form an opinion 
on the scope of the U.S.-Israel bilateral agreement and has 
been examining that issue.  No final opinion can be 
established without copyright experts from both sides 
engaging in detailed discussions.  We again invite U.S. legal 
experts to assist us in opening a professional and candid 
dialog to arrive at a proper interpretation of our bilateral 
agreement among all concerned parties. 
 
We would also like to add that in practice, to the best of 
our knowledge, the Israeli Federation of the Phonographic 
Industry has been transferring royalties for public 
performances to U.S. phonogram producers, and continues to do 
so. 
 
With respect to the question of data exclusivity, it is the 
view of the GOI that its legal system and practices ensure 
the required level of protection that is called for pursuant 
to Article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement. 
 
Nevertheless, as has already been reported to the USTR, the 
GOI formed an inter-ministerial committee whose task was to 
review Israel\'s policy regarding the protection of data 
exclusivity.  The committee included senior representatives 
from the Ministries of Finance, Health, Justice, and the 
Ministry of industry, Trade and Labor.  The committee studied 
all aspects of that issue, including its implications on 
access to medicine, public health, budget and expenditures, 
industry and employment, investments and international legal 
commitments. 
 
As part of its work, the committee held extensive 
consultations with industry representatives (both generic and 
innovative), Israeli health maintenance organizations, and 
other relevant bodies.  The committee concluded its work at 
the end of March and has already submitted its report and 
recommendations to the Director Generals of the relevant 
ministries.  The said report includes a proposal for altering 
the current policy in this matter.  Following a meeting 
between the Director Generals, scheduled to take place 
following the Passover vacation, a final decision will be 
made by the relevant Ministers. 
 
We hope that the foregoing explanation has been helpful, and 
we would like to suggest a joint meeting in which those 
issues and others will be discussed and further clarified. 
Additional meetings have already been scheduled between 
Israeli and USTR officials. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Ehud Olmert 
Vice Prime Minister and 
Minister of Industry, Trade, 
Labor and Communications 
 
Joseph (Tommy) Lapid 
Minister of Justice

Begin text of letter from Ministry of Justice to USTR: 
 
\"March 26, 2004 
State of Israel 
Ministry of Justice 
Howard Zvi Poliner, Advocate 
Director Intellectual Property Law Dept. 
Legislation and Legal Counsel 
 
Mr. Edmund Saums 
Office of the United States Trade Representative 
Washington, D.C. 
 
Dear Mr. Saums, 
 
Based on preliminary informal reactions to the Government of 
Israel\'s (hereinafter GOI) recent submission to your office 
in the framework of the Special 301 Review Process, we are 
under the impression that there are several factual 
misunderstandings that require clarification.  In particular, 
it appears that USTR believes: (1) that the GOI has changed 
its position on the interpretation of the scope of the 
Bilateral Copyright Agreement; and, (2) that the recently 
published proposal for a copyright bill is designed to negate 
the Bilateral Copyright Agreement.  Those assumptions are not 
accurate. 
 
With regard to the scope of the Bilateral Copyright 
Agreement, the GOI does not now, nor has it in the past, held 
a formal position on this matter, nor has it stated 
otherwise.  On the contrary, the GOI has stated that it would 
form an opinion on the scope of the Bilateral Agreement.  In 
order to reach an opinion regarding the scope of the 
Bilateral Agreement, it was deemed necessary to seek the 
assistance of outside counsel.  To that end the law firm of 
Morrison and Forester was recently asked to prepare a 
preliminary opinion on the question of whether US phonogram 
producers, as such, are covered under the terms of the 
Bilateral Agreement (as distinguished from copyrights in the 
lyrics and composition embodied in those phonograms which 
clearly are within the scope of several international 
copyright agreements).  Morrison\'s preliminary opinion states 
that phonograms, as such, are not subject matter covered 
under the terms of the Bilateral Agreement.  The Morrison 
opinion is only a preliminary opinion and no decision has yet 
been taken with regard to its conclusions.  Any possible 
interpretations of the scope of the Bilateral Agreement are 
open for discussion. 
 
With regard to the perception that the proposal for a 
copyright bill would effectively result in the abrogation of 
the Bilateral Agreement, this too is not accurate.  Section 8 
of the proposal is designed to empower the Minister of 
Justice to implement international commitments which Israel 
has made, or will make in the future, in the field of 
copyright.  Indeed, nothing in the proposal calls into 
question the validity of existing bilateral or multilateral 
agreements.  In other words, section 8 is intended to 
maintain the status quo with regard to existing bilateral 
agreements, whatever such status quo may be, and section 8 
does not affect the interpretation of such bilateral 
agreements. 
 
With regard to the optional proposal set forth in section 
7(b) of the proposal for a copyright bill to not recognize 
\"simultaneous publication\" with respect to public performance 
and broadcast of phonograms, this too would not impact on the 
interpretation of the Bilateral Agreement and is effectively 
a separate issue.  Indeed, if the Bilateral Agreement is 
deemed to cover phonograms as such, then the optional 
proposal set forth in section 7(b), even if adopted, would 
not supersede the terms of the Bilateral Agreement.  Further, 
it should be noted that the proposal set forth in section 
7(b), to limit the applicability of the \"simultaneous 
publication\" is consistent with the 1996 WIPO Performances 
and Phonograms Treaty and the Rome Convention\'s concept of 
the rule of reciprocity.  Indeed, with respect to public 
performance rights in phonograms, reciprocity, and not 
national treatment, is the more common practice throughout 
the world and in particular in common law tradition countries 
such as Canada and Australia. 
 
Accordingly, and in order to reach a better common 
understanding of the scope of copyright relations between our 
countries, we believe that it would be useful for copyright 
experts from both sides to engage in direct discussions 
either in person or by teleconference. 
 
Sincerely, 
Howard Poliner, Adv.

------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Both Ha\'aretz (Hebrew Ed.) and Maariv led with, and all 
media reported on the \"Shi\'ite Intifada\" (Ha\'aretz) in 
Iraq.  All media also reported on the confrontation 
with U.S. troops in and around the Sunni city of 
Fallujah.  Like other media, Ha\'aretz reported that 130 
Iraqi citizens and 20 coalition soldiers were killed 
over the past two days.  Israel Radio cited President 
Bush\'s optimism regarding the stabilization of the 
situation in Iraq. 
 
Gaza withdrawal plan: 
-Israel Radio cited reports from Washington that the 
U.S. and Israel have agreed in principle on the 
components of PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan: Bush 
would support the plan as an interim step until the 
implementation of the road map.  The radio quoted its 
sources in Washington as saying further that the 
agreement was reached last week at the talks between 
Sharon and the three U.S. envoys (Steve Hadley, Elliott 
Abrams and A/S William Burns), and that the points 
still in contention will be resolved before the Bush- 
Sharon meeting next Tuesday.  The station also reported 
that Sharon has started a round of talks with his 
cabinet ministers to discuss his plan before his 
upcoming trip to the U.S.  -- Monday at his farm, he 
met with Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.  Sharon 
will depart Israel next Monday. 
-Yediot reported that \"Disengagement is good for 
Israel\" will be the slogan leading Sharon\'s campaign to 
persuade the Likud registered members to support him 
and his plan.  The newspaper reported that his 
opponents in the Likud will launch a campaign that will 
hint that he initiated his plan because of the 
investigations he is going through. 
-Arafat was quoted as saying in an interview with 
Yediot\'s Ronnie Shaked that Sharon must coordinate the 
withdrawal from Gaza with the PA.  He was quoted as 
saying: \"We have received promises from the Quartet and 
the Americans that the withdrawal will be part of the 
road map -- and I hope it indeed will be.\"  Arafat 
reiterated that he is not afraid of Sharon\'s threats. 
(Maariv cited the Arab League\'s call on Israel Tuesday 
not to hurt Arafat.)  Arafat condemned the killing of 
civilians.  The full interview will be printed on 
Friday.  Israel Radio quoted Palestinian FM Nabil 
Shaath as saying that the U.S. has promised economic 
assistance to the PA after Israel\'s pullout from Gaza. 
The radio quoted former Palestinian PM Abu Mazen as 
saying on Al Jazeera-TV that both Israel and the PA had 
failed him. 
Israel Radio quoted Deputy State Department Spokesman 
J. Adam Ereli as saying Tuesday: \"Far from being 
welcomed into any partnership or cooperation, Hamas 
should be ostracized and disempowered as an 
organization.\"  According to the radio, Ereli was 
responding to an interview PA Chairman Yasser Arafat 
gave to the German weekly Focus, in which he hinted 
that he could include Hamas and all Palestinian 
factions in the PA.  Several leading media reported 
that Monday the Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam noted 
Arafat\'s intention.  Jerusalem Post reported that a 
source in Sharon\'s bureau dismissed the move as a 
desperate bid by Arafat to stay in power. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that a source in Sharon\'s 
bureau dismissed as \"nonsense\" a statement made by 
incoming Spanish FM Miguel Moratinos in an interview 
published Tuesday in the British daily Financial Times: 
\"Al Qaida will not be defeated until there is a 
peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz, Yediot and Jerusalem Post reported that 
Monday morning IDF troops killed three Palestinians 
near the central Gaza Strip.  The media reported that 
the IDF found and destroyed an eight-meter smuggling 
tunnel at Rafah.  This morning, Israel Radio reported 
that the IDF wounded two Palestinians in the Casbah of 
Nablus. 
 
Several media reported that over the past few days the 
Ayoun River stopped flowing into Israel, possibly under 
orders from Lebanon.  This morning, Israel Radio 
reported that the water was streaming again. 
 
Leading media reported that Iran has pledged to speed 
up cooperation with the IAEA and to stop enriching 
uranium. 
 
All media reported that a Montreal Jewish elementary 
school was firebombed Monday.  The police allegedly 
found anti-Semitic notes at the spot, denouncing recent 
Israeli attacks against Palestinians, including the 
killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.  Monday, Ha\'aretz 
devoted its entire Passover supplement to the rise of 
anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli activity in the world. 
The magazine describes the struggle between pro-Israeli 
and pro-Palestinian militants on U.S. campuses. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited the results of Tel Aviv University\'s 
Peace Index, conducted March 28-30: 
-72.5 percent of Israelis believe that Palestinian 
leaders at the level of leadership of organizations 
such as Hamas should be assassinated in the framework 
of the long-term war on terror, while only 21 percent 
believe that such assassinations should be avoided 
because they damage Israel\'s international image and 
hurt its economic and tourism interests; 6.5 percent 
are undecided 
--79 percent of Israelis says that they did not change 
their daily routine after Yassin\'s assassination; 20 
percent say they changed it; 1 percent say that they do 
not know. 
-68 percent of Israelis think that the 70 Palestinian 
public figures who called for avoiding revenge over 
Yassin\'s killing represent only a small, insignificant 
sector on the Palestinian side; a similar number assess 
that the Israelis who condemned the act in the press 
represent only a small, insignificant group; only 10 
percent believe the call by the Palestinian 
intellectuals would have a moderating influence on the 
Palestinian public in general; only 14 percent believe 
the call by the Israeli intellectuals would have a 
moderating influence on the Israeli public in general. 
Only 4 percent believe the call to avoid revenge would 
moderate the reaction of Hamas, and just 12 percent 
believe the condemnation by Israeli public figures and 
intellectuals would moderate the Israeli government\'s 
policy of targeted killings.

Arab affairs commentator Danny Rubinstein wrote in 
Ha\'aretz: \"The Israeli boycott of Arafat and the PA has 
opened the door to cooperation between Hamas and the 
Authority.  The day when Hamas joins the PA, however, 
is still far off.\" 
 
Former editor-in-chief Moshe Ishon wrote in 
nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe: \"The joint statement ... 
will only be a declarative one on the part of the 
United States.  On the other hand, Sharon will commit 
himself in a practical fashion to withdrawing from the 
Gaza Strip and some West Bank settlements within a 
year.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Baghdad\" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer and the late prime minister 
Yitzhak Rabin\'s assistant Eytan Haber opined in an 
editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (April 7): \"The situation [in Iraq] reminds 
the Israelis of the first euphoric days of Arik 
Sharon\'s Lebanon War in 1982, which ended in a whimper, 
after the thunder of exploding bombs.  Some people here 
also remember the descent of the architects of the 
Lebanon War here from the political stage (and Sharon\'s 
late return).  The chips that fly from the sawing of 
the Iraqi tree reach the Prime Minister\'s bureau in 
Jerusalem: the president of the U.S., on the eve of 
elections, needs a serious achievement.  In his eyes, 
in the view from the Oval Office, he must not upset the 
Islamic countries too much.  Therefore, there is a 
basis for the conjecture that there is no meaning or 
value to the leaks issuing from Jerusalem saying that 
Sharon\'s path, in his upcoming visit to the U.S., will 
be easy and comfortable.  According to the whispers 
from Jerusalem, the Americans \'will give everything.\' 
The frequent trips of Bureau Chief Dov Weisglass to the 
U.S. do not attest to a broad understanding with 
Washington.  In order to agree, it is sufficient to 
meet once, but differences of opinion and disputes 
require many meetings.  Therefore, those who know the 
Americans and are familiar with Israel\'s history with 
them, know that they will not agree with Sharon on less 
than a withdrawal to the 1967 borders, with slight 
revisions; they will remain silent as to the \'right of 
return\'; and they are expected to reject further 
requests by Sharon.  This is not the time in the eyes 
of Bush and his administration to exacerbate the 
quarrels with the Arab world.  In the parlance of 
sports commentators, \'any other result (for Sharon\'s 
visit) will come as a great surprise.\'\" 
 
II.  \"Israel Is Not Allowed to Defend Itself\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(April 7): \"\'Pinpoint prevention\' provoked a tsunami of 
complaints, as if this war wasn\'t a war in which one 
side, the Palestinian side, deliberately strikes at 
civilians -- on buses, in restaurants and malls -- 
filling the explosives belts with large amounts of 
nails to make sure as much damage as possible takes 
place.  That is targeted killing of Israelis.  But in 
the eyes of the critics, the pursuit of terrorists 
appeared to be a criminal act, not hostilities during 
warfare.... And there were complaints against the IDF\'s 
rules of engagement.  What army in the world has better 
rules of engagement?.... All [armies] could learn from 
the IDF about how to comply with the orders.... Lift 
the blockades and checkpoints, shouted the critics. 
True, the checkpoints harass the innocent, but the 
critics did not take into account that the breaches 
through which the murderers come must be blocked.... 
The criticism is also fed from inside Israel.... 
Presumably if we were to defend ourselves in this war 
of terror by throwing rocks, the world would still 
complain.  Most critics don\'t believe Israel has a 
right to self-defense.  Israel, therefore, should in 
most cases ignore the critics.  We should be the ones 
to criticize what is happening on our side and around 
us.\" 
 
III.  \"Resistant Hamas Eyes Joint Leadership Role in 
Gaza\" 
 
Arab affairs commentator Danny Rubinstein wrote in 
Ha\'aretz (April 7): \"Hamas never wanted to join the 
Palestinian Authority because it was set up on the 
basis of the Oslo Accords, which it and the other 
opposition fiercely opposed.... Now, Hamas leaders are 
saying they want to setup a joint national leadership 
body in Gaza after the withdrawal.  These declarations 
give the impression that Hamas is ready to recognize a 
joint leadership body that will constitute an 
alternative to the PA.... The key factor that explains 
the change in the Hamas position is the demise of the 
Oslo Accords.  Moreover, there are no contacts between 
the PA and the Israeli government, and an Israeli 
pullout from Gaza will be conducted unilaterally, 
without any coordination or consultation with the 
Authority.  In other words, the Israeli boycott of 
Arafat and the PA has opened the door to cooperation 
between Hamas and the Authority.  The day when Hamas 
joins the PA, however, is still far off.  In his 
interview with [the German weekly] Focus, Arafat 
praised the moderation, in his words, of Sheikh Ahmed 
Yassin, as opposed to Abdel Aziz Rantisi, his successor 
in Gaza.  Arafat\'s criticism of Rantisi will not help 
any partnership between them.\" 
 
IV.  \"Washington Will Do What It Has Always Done\" 
 
Former editor-in-chief Moshe Ishon wrote in 
nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe (April 7): \"President 
Bush has rejected Sharon\'s requests regarding the 
indivisibility of Jerusalem; he has declined to publish 
a unequivocal announcement about the future of Jewish 
settlement in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank]; he has 
also declined to rule unambiguously against the return 
of 1948 refugees.  The President has reiterated that 
those issues will finally be determined in a peace 
agreement between the sides.  Thus, the joint statement 
that will be issued at the conclusion of Mr. Sharon\'s 
visit to the U.S. will only be a declarative one on the 
part of the United States.  On the other hand, Sharon 
will commit himself in a practical fashion to 
withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and some West Bank 
settlements within a year, as part of this is 
implemented even before the U.S. elections.  This would 
most likely be the first phase of the evacuation of 
some West Bank settlements.\"

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Foreign News Editor Arik Bachar wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv: \"The U.S. Administration has less 
than one year to complete its Iraqi project decisively. 
This requires a significant boosting of the number of 
troops sent to Iraq, but that is an incommensurably 
worthwhile investment.\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"Just because Iraq\'s nominal future leadership favors a 
course of moderation doesn\'t mean that\'s the course 
Iraq will take.  Moderation is a virtue, but its defect 
is its reluctance to confront extremism with anything 
but moderation.  In Iraq today, this will not do.\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized: \"The means 
Israel is using in the face of murderous Palestinian 
terrorism are much more moderate [than the ones 
employed by the Americans and the British in Iraq].\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"You Must Finish What You\'ve Started\" 
 
Foreign News Editor Arik Bachar wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (April 7): \"Life on our planet is hard 
enough.  Should the Americans leave Iraq and leave it 
as booty for extremists like Sadr, life will become 
unbearable for everybody -- from the New York yuppie to 
the last of the Indonesian villagers.  Bush and his 
staff know this, but they might be ousted from the 
White House in half-a-year; a Democratic administration 
in the U.S. would find a way to leave Iraq as soon as 
possible.  U.S. failure in Iraq would constitute a war 
call for generations of Islamic fanatics, would torment 
the lives of all of us [on earth].  The U.S. 
Administration has less than one year to complete its 
Iraqi project decisively.  This requires a significant 
boosting of the number of troops sent to Iraq, but that 
is an incommensurably worthwhile investment.  For every 
American soldier who is now staying home, America will 
have to send five soldiers in the future to eradicate 
the bad news that might come from Iraq.\" 
 
II.  \"Gloves Off in Iraq\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(April 7): \"It is a testament to what the coalition has 
achieved that the principal Shi\'ite cleric in Iraq, 
Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has called on Sadr to \'stop 
resorting to violence\' and to turn away from a \"course 
that could destroy the nation.\'  But just because 
Iraq\'s nominal future leadership favors a course of 
moderation doesn\'t mean that\'s the course Iraq will 
take.  Moderation is a virtue, but its defect is its 
reluctance to confront extremism with anything but 
moderation.  In Iraq today, this will not do.  It is 
not simply a matter of political or strategic 
necessity, but rather the moral obligation of the 
coalition, to ensure that the monopoly on the use of 
force rests firmly in the hands of legitimately 
constituted authority.  Whatever price ordinary Iraqis 
will pay in the coming weeks to ensure that outcome 
will surely be a small one next to what they\'ll have to 
face at the hands of an emboldened Sadr, an emboldened 
Iran, and an emboldened Fallujah street.  We trust 
Bremer and Co. know this, too.\" 
 
III.  \"American-British Experience\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (April 7): 
\"Let it be clear: the American-British struggle in Iraq 
is absolutely justified.  But the most justified move 
at this time would be to place a mirror in front of the 
American-British troops in Iraq.  The means Israel is 
using in the face of murderous Palestinian terrorism 
are much more moderate.  Only last week did the 
Americans and the British scatter a demonstration in 
Iraq by shooting live fire into the crowd.  For a 
moment we almost shouted: \'Mr. Blair, Mr. Bush, stop 
that cruelty!\'\"

-------------------------------- 
 
1.  Mideast 
 
2.  Iraq 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media highlighted the situation in Iraq.  (Maariv\'s 
banner: \"America in Trouble\"; banners in Yediot and 
Hatzofe evoke the \"Iraqi quagmire.\")  At least 150 
Iraqis and 40 Americans were killed in Wednesday\'s 
fighting.  Jerusalem Post quoted leaders of Moqtada al- 
Sadr\'s Shi\'ite militia in Baghdad as saying Wednesday 
that Palestinian fedayeen fighters have joined the 
ranks of the rebel Mahdi Army.  Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem 
Post reported on anti-American demonstrations in the 
territories. 
 
Yediot and Globes led with what Israel could get in 
exchange from the U.S. for its disengagement plan: both 
newspapers reported that the U.S. Administration is 
considering granting Israel billions of USD to develop 
the Negev and to fight terrorism.  Yediot cited up-to- 
date GOI assessments that the disengagement plan could 
cost 4 to 5 billion shekels (around USD 900 million to 
1.1 billion).  Jerusalem Post and other media reported 
that Wednesday British PM Tony Blair became the first 
European leader to clearly back PM Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan.  Reporting that Blair called 
Sharon, Jerusalem Post wrote that a British diplomatic 
official confirmed that the conversation took place, 
but that he would not reveal any details. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported (lead story in its English Ed.) that 
the Hamas, Fatah and Islamic Jihad leaderships in Gaza 
have prepared a still non-binding draft \"National Plan\" 
that \"emphasizes the right to use violence to oppose 
the occupation and the settlements, while avoiding 
turning civilians from either side into targets for 
attack.\" 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Wednesday the PA rejected 
a U.S. warning against integrating Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad into its political structure, saying that 
Washington has no right to interfere in its internal 
affairs.  Ha\'aretz reported that militant Palestinian 
groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants, 
will resume discussions on the Gaza Strip Saturday. 
The newspaper notes that interest in this meeting has 
been heightened by Hamas\'s agreement in principle to 
join the PLO and the PA. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that five terrorist attacks took 
place in the first quarter of 2004, in a descending 
curve since 40 attacks occurred in the first quarter of 
2002.  The newspaper says that Hamas is still looking 
for a flaw in the security system to perpetrate what it 
regards as a suitable act of retribution for the 
killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.  Jerusalem Post quoted 
Brig. Gen. (res.) Dani Arditi, Sharon\'s adviser on 
counterterrorism, as saying that Israelis are becoming 
too complacent about security and that they are 
ignoring warnings to steer clear of dangerous sites. 
Ha\'aretz reported that Sunday a Palestinian youth from 
the Balata refugee camp on the West Bank died of wounds 
sustained during clashes with IDF troops the day 
earlier.  The newspaper also reported that Wednesday 
two Israeli and some 20 Palestinian demonstrators were 
moderately injured in clashes with IDF soldiers during 
protests against the construction of the separation 
fence at Biddu village, northwest of Jerusalem.  Israel 
Radio reported that the police have arrested 10 young 
members of an extremist branch of Bratzlav ultra- 
Orthodox for attacking and beating up Arabs in 
Jerusalem over the recent period. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the GOI has approved a new, 
tougher, directive for the monitoring of nuclear, 
biological and chemical materials, which follows 
guidelines used in Western countries. 
 
Yediot cited Thai government warnings of possible 
attacks of tourist sites by Muslim extremists.  The 
newspaper cited a GOI travel advisory for Thailand. 
Yediot and other media reported that last week an 
extremist Muslim group, the \"European-Arab League,\" 
warned that organizations such as Hamas could attack 
the Jewish community of Antwerp, Belgium, if it does 
not denounce Israel\'s policy. 
 
Over the past few days, the media cited claims by Roman 
Catholic Church officials that Israel has delayed 
granting visas to dozens of Roman Catholic clergy. 
Leading media noted that Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah 
called it an issue of survival for the church in the 
Holy Land. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the Defense Ministry is 
investigating a complaint that a company called Globus 
Aviation Ltd. was involved in a transaction in which 
surplus IDF helicopters ended up in Columbia, where 
they could have fallen into the hands of criminal 
elements.

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"Not since the

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Balfour to Bush, Vietnam to Israel\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 8): \"Not 
since the Balfour Declaration has there been a document 
that has raised so many expectations as the one 
President George Bush is supposed to give Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon, detailing American quid pro quos 
for the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and four isolated 
settlements in the northern West Bank.... On his way to 
his meeting with Bush in Washington, Sharon ought to 
read \'The Palace File,\' which documents how the U.S. 
abandoned its closest ally in Asia, South Vietnam, 
where so many tens of thousands of American servicemen 
died fighting for its independence.... There are many 
worlds of difference between South Vietnam and Israel. 
Israel has never asked America to fight for it and die 
for it.  But despite the differences in the 
circumstances, it is difficult to ignore the historical 
lesson: political promises are meant to solve urgent 
political problems and are always only good for the 
moment they are made.  Don\'t regard them as a 
\'political insurance policy\'.... So why entrap the 
Americans into articles of an agreement that will never 
be formed?  It is doubtful that a Democratic 
administration would honor the Bush letter.... For all 
those reasons, it is evident that one should not take 
the Bush letter too seriously.  Its importance will 
evaporate with the closing of the Likud referendum 
poll, when the disengagement plan is brought to the 
government for its approval.\" 
 
II.  \"Moderates Crushed Between Hammer and Anvil\" 
 
Liberal columnist Yehuda Litani wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (April 8): \"If 
Prof. Sari Nusseibeh had a private army, the Al-Aqsa 
Martyrs Brigades would not dare threaten him.... Caught 
between a rock and a hard place, the Palestinians who 
support dialogue are not even capable of making a faint 
sound.  They still remember the lynching that was 
nearly staged against Palestinian activists who 
participated in the signing ceremony of the Geneva 
Accord, and narrowly escaped this fate upon returning 
to Gaza.  If some of their brothers view them as 
traitors, many Israelis believe that they are a 
\'gimmick,\' that there is no difference between them and 
the extremist Palestinians; their goal is the same, 
Israel\'s destruction, and only their tactics are 
different.  Both the Israeli establishment and the 
Palestinian establishment are adamantly opposed to 
their activity.  In our bloody ethnic conflict, as in 
other similar conflicts from India to Ireland, the only 
question is: Are you with us or against us?  White or 
black.  Shades of gray fade, dissipate and at times are 
even wiped out.\" 
 
III.  \"A Different Middle East is Forming Before Our 
Very Eyes\" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (April 8): \"The 
[Tunis] summit collapsed because the Arab world has 
changed in the past decade beyond recognition.... A 
different Middle East is forming before our very eyes: 
countries and groups that once were dominant and 
deciding forces have become marginal, while the former 
members of the periphery have become the center.  These 
changes are of immense strategic importance.  Neither 
Egypt nor Syria lead the entire Arab world in their 
footsteps any longer, as we assumed to be the case just 
a decade or two ago.  Perhaps on the contrary.  Perhaps 
ties with the \'peripheral\' states will ultimately 
prompt Syria or Egypt to truly reconcile themselves to 
reality.  Moreover, the Palestinians, Egypt and Syria 
have lost their veto power over Israel\'s ties in the 
region.  As a consequence, the price Israel will be 
forced to pay for ties with the Arabs has changed as 
well.... That does not mean that Israel needs to adopt 
a condescending and reckless Middle Eastern policy and 
to heedlessly exploit the Arab confusion.... The Arab 
dissolution should also spark sober Israeli thinking. 
Among themselves, they are incapable of reaching mutual 
trust; no Arab country has normal, intrigue-less 
relations with any other Arab country.  Is it even 
remotely likely that they will forge romantic peace 
relations based on reconciliation, recognition and 
coexistence with Israel, the ultimate enemy?  Thus, the 
collapse of the Arab summit is also a lesson for us not 
about what is to be desired in the Middle East, but 
about what exists and what is possible in the Middle 
East.\"

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Veteran op-ed writer Yaron London opined in the lead 
editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot: \"The Americans will eventually leave Iraq, 
whether they win the battle or lose it, but we will 
continue to live in the same neighborhood as our 
victims.  The perpetual proximity compels us to adhere 
to different rules of behavior than those the American 
passers-by can allow themselves.\" 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar\'el wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"That kind of 
reaction [by the Iraqi Governing Council] should make 
clear to the Americans just how powerful an Iraqi 
government they\'ll need to hand over responsibility to 
at the end of June.\" 
 
Hebrew University Professor of Political Science and 
former Foreign Ministry director-general Shlomo Avineri 
wrote in Yediot Aharonot: \"Should three states arise 
[in Iraq] there could be a chance for stability of some 
kind.\" 
 
Yoav Frummer wrote from New York in popular, pluralist 
Maariv: \"Bush still has one last political trump card 
in his pocket -- that of a war president.  Continued 
deterioration of the situation in Iraq and the 
dispatching of additional troops overseas would cost 
Bush not only his last cards, but also his position.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Why Is It Permitted For the Americans?\" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer Yaron London opined in the lead 
editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (April 8): \"Malicious joy is not a laudable 
emotion, but it is easy to understand the anger over 
the fact that giants are judged by forgiving standards, 
while midgets are subject to stringent standards.  The 
American giant is not afraid to call the punitive 
operation in Fallujah by the name of \'revenge,\' while 
we would never admit this motive, which originates in a 
boiling heart and paralyzed brain.  Indeed, they are 
permitted what we are barred from doing.   And what is 
the lesson?  We will ignore the moral issues and 
concentrate on the practical questions: the Americans 
will eventually leave Iraq, whether they win the battle 
or lose it, but we will continue to live in the same 
neighborhood as our victims.  The perpetual proximity 
compels us to adhere to different rules of behavior 
than those the American passers-by can allow 
themselves.\" 
 
II.  \"A War Waged For Prestige in Iraq\" 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar\'el wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 8): 
\"[Fallujah]\'s 300,000 residents have been under curfew 
for three days and under cover of that curfew American 
forces are going house to house to find the terrorists 
responsible for the lynching of four Americans and the 
mutilation of their bodies.  Finding those responsible 
has became a matter of prestige for the American armed 
forces, who could yet turn the campaign in Fallujah 
into one of those watershed moments that characterize 
many wars, when a city or site becomes a symbol.... 
Meanwhile, the impotence of the Iraqi Governing Council 
is patently evident.   It has been unable to calm the 
situation and a few council members are making do with 
calls for a probe of the activities of the American 
forces, and at least two council members have 
threatened to resign.  That kind of reaction should 
make clear to the Americans just how powerful an Iraqi 
government they\'ll need to hand over responsibility to 
at the end of June.\" 
 
III.  \"Iraq: Mission Impossible\" 
 
Hebrew University Professor of Political Science and 
former Foreign Ministry director-general Shlomo Avineri 
wrote in Yediot Aharonot (April 8): \"The current 
increasing hardships endured by the Americans in Iraq 
are evidence of the hopelessness of the attempt to 
establish democracy in a society that utterly lacks the 
foundations needed for that purpose.... During the last 
decade the Kurds have enjoyed a de-facto autonomy 
sponsored by the U.S.  They have established a regime 
that performs in an impressive fashion.  It is doubtful 
whether they would agree to find themselves again under 
an Arab regime.... The current violence in Iraq is 
indeed directed at the Americans and their allies, but 
this is in fact a domestic civil war symbolizing the 
end of Sunni hegemony in Iraq.  In such a situation, 
something can be learned from the example of 
Yugoslavia.... It won\'t be easy to convince the 
international community -- the U.S. in a first stage -- 
that it will be very hard to reestablish a united Iraq, 
the original British dream of \'Mesopotamia.\'  Should 
three states arise -- a Kurdish one in the north, an 
Arab-Sunni one in the center and an Arab-Shi\'ite one in 
the south -- there could be a chance for stability of 
some kind.  If this doesn\'t happen, what would be 
awaiting Iraq would be what characterized Yugoslavia in 
the \'90s.  That lesson had better be learned.\" 
 
IV.  \"Cracks in Bush\'s Armor\" 
 
Yoav Frummer wrote from New York in popular, pluralist 
Maariv (April 8): \"A quick glance at the years of 
George Bush\'s presidency over the largest superpower in 
the world doesn\'t reveal a success story.... The 
American nation was ready to fight Iraqi terrorism -- 
but only to a point.  This week\'s events, which revived 
memories from Vietnam that have for a long time 
reverberated under the surface anyway, were the last 
thing that the U.S. Administration needed seven months 
before the elections.... Despite his expected contest 
with John Kerry ... President Bush will be the man who 
will determine the results in November.  As of now, his 
situation is far from being assured.  But Bush still 
has one last political trump card in his pocket -- that 
of a war president.  Continued deterioration of the 
situation in Iraq and the dispatching of additional 
troops overseas would cost Bush not only his last 
cards, but also his position.\"

TAGS: ENRG, IS, ECONOMY AND FINANCE, GOI EXTERNAL, LABOR AND COMMERCE 
SUBJECT: DETAILS OF EGYPT/ISRAEL GAS PIPELINE APPROVED BY 
GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 1288 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Theodore A. Mann for reasons 1.4 (b) 
and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  The Egypt/Israel gas pipeline project 
cleared a crucial hurdle on April 4 when the GOI gave its 
blessing to the Israel Electric Company (IEC) to negotiate an 
agreement with the supplier of Egyptian natural gas, Eastern 
Mediterranean Group (EMG).  Under the proposed agreement EMG, 
a joint Israeli/Egyptian company, will purchase 1.7 billion 
cubic meters per year of natural gas from Egypt, oversee the 
construction and operation of a pipeline to Israel, and then 
sell the gas to IEC.  Merhav, EMG\'s Israeli partner, told 
Embassy econoff that they expect a final agreement to be 
signed as early as May, with gas exports beginning in 
mid-2006.  Merhav claims the government decision solved most 
of the remaining issues on the Israeli side (reftel).  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (C) On March 7, Embassy econoff spoke with Merhav Senior 
Vice President Nimrod Novik about the April 4 decision. 
Novik said that decision taken by the sub-cabinet (comprised 
of the Ministers of Finance, Infrastructure, and the PM\'s 
office) cleared the way for IEC to enter into final 
negotiations with EMG and the Egyptians.  Novik said the 
government avoided the thorniest issue, which was a demand 
for each government to issue a guarantee in case either side 
was unable or unwilling to honor their sides part of the 
agreement.  The GOI decided not to get involved in a mutual 
guarantee process, but instead will allow the parties (IEC, 
EMG, Israel Natural Gas Line (INGL), and Egyptian Gas (EGAS)) 
directly involved to provide the necessary guarantees.  For 
example, Novik said, INGL, the Israeli pipeline builder and 
operator, will provide a guarantee to IEC in the event that 
the pipeline in Israel is not ready to receive the gas on 
time. 
 
3.  (C) IEC\'s contract with EMG is for the supply of 1.7 
billion cubic meters (BCM).  Novik added that the government 
decision allows IEC to decrease its contracted supply by an 
amount equivalent to the future amount of gas contracted by 
any IPP in Israel (see reftel).  (Note:  Israel has only one 
natural gas supplier at the current time, the joint 
Israeli/U.S. consortium Yam Tethys.  Prime Minister Sharon 
decided in 2003 that Egypt, represented by EMG, would be 
Israel\'s second supplier.  This week, in addition to the 
decisions regarding Egyptian supply, Israel reportedly 
settled on British Gas\'s (BG) offshore Gaza Strip natural gas 
reserves as Israel\'s third supplier if there is available 
demand.  According to the press, the sub-cabinet\'s approval 
of BG will allow it to negotiate with potential natural gas 
buyers in Israel.  End note.) 
 
4.  (C) The next step, according to Novik, is a meeting of 
the IEC Board on April 15 where the board is expected to 
approve this week\'s government decision and the parameters of 
a final agreement to be negotiated with EMG and EGAS 
beginning the following week in Egypt.  Novik expects that 
Merhav, as part of EMG, and IEC will travel to Egypt on April 
20 to begin final negotiations.  Novik said he was pleased 
with this week\'s events.  The project, he asserts, is the 
most visible link between the two countries and enjoys the 
support of Prime Minister Sharon and President Mubarak. 
Novik acknowledged that there are still obstacles to a final 
agreement, but he is confident that they are diminishing 
rapidly.  Novik asked that Washington consider commending 
President Mubarak during his upcoming visit to the U.S. for 
the leadership he has shown in supporting this important 
bilateral project.  And he added that the U.S. should 
encourage Mubarak \"to explore other opportunities for 
Israeli-Egyptian bilateral cooperation.\" 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  This week\'s cabinet decision was a 
significant step forward for the Egypt/Israel natural gas 
pipeline, however, the accelerated timetable laid out by 
Novik is likely to slip.  The long history of this project 
suggests that there could be a few more hurdles to come.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Iraq and the American entanglement continued dominating 
the Israeli press. All media reported about the two 
East Jerusalem Israeli-Arabs who were kidnapped in 
Iraq. The two were apparently working for a North 
Carolina aid organization (RTI), which won a contract 
from USAID for rehabilitation of the local government 
in Iraq.  The kidnapping opens a debate in Israel 
regarding Israel\'s responsibility towards East 
Jerusalem Palestinian residents. Israel Radio reported 
that the P.A. promised to try and assist the two 
hostages. The media also reported about the kidnapping 
of Japanese citizens, a Canadian and a UK citizen. 
 
Israel radio quoted Secretary of State Colin Powell as 
telling a Senate subcommittee that the U.S. does not 
now plan to cut loan guarantees to Israel because of 
the barrier it is building through Palestinian areas in 
the West Bank. 
 
All media reported that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has 
formally asked the Likud election chief to set the 
party\'s referendum on his unilateral disengagement plan 
before the end of this month.  The unexpected move has 
angered the right-wing faction in the Likud party, 
which claims that PM Sharon is using this holiday month 
(many national speeches) and the coming visit to 
Washington in order to assist him win the referendum. 
 
All media cited from NSA Condoleezza Rice testimony 
before the commission investigating the 9/11 terror 
attacks. Rice defended the administration against the 
allegations made by Richard Clarke charging that 
President George Bush had failed to take threats of an 
al-Qaida attack seriously. 
 
Jpost reported that the National Unity Coalition for 
Israel, an umbrella group representing millions of 
Christians across the U.S., have issued an \"Action 
Alert\" against PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan. 
 
Leading media cited Abdel Aziz Rantisi, the new Hamas 
leader, calling for the formation of a \"national 
salvation government\" consisting of representatives of 
all Palestinian factions. 
 
In an interview to Yediot Minister Of Defense Shaul 
Mofaz said that the U.S.\'s victory in Iraq is essential 
for world peace. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the IDF has lately changed its 
policy and stopped returning the bodies of armed 
Palestinians killed in clashes with security forces to 
their families and started burying them in Israel.  The 
decision was made as a mean of deterrence and the will 
to have negotiating cards for worst-case scenarios. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Hamas\' spokesmen as saying that despite 
ongoing negotiations between them and P.A. officials 
they have no intention joining the P.A. in its current 
constellation. 
 
Ha\'aretz exclusively interviewed a Syrian intelligence 
officer, an ex-spy against Israel, as revealing that 
Syria has details and photos on the Dimona nuclear 
reactor. 
 
Maariv and Ha\'aretz reported that the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has 
cancelled its scheduled participant in the Israeli 
Space Agency\'s convention next month due to what seems 
to be security concerns.  The Minister of Science and 
Technology Eliezer (Modi) Sandberg was quoted as saying 
that this was a political decision. 
 
Roni Shaked interviewed P.A. Chairman Yasser Arafat for 
Yediot.  In the interview Arafat declared that he is 
willing to have an immediate cease-fire and renew 
negotiations.

                     ------------ 
 
1. \"The Iraqi Mud, The Israeli Concern\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote on page one of independent, left-leaning 
Ha\'aretz (April 9): \"Israel cannot sit by indifferently 
in the face of the current events in Iraq.  Key 
individuals who are dealing with the future of the 
region ... concur that the results of the military 
campaign in Iraq will also influence Israel and will 
also have an effect on the degree of security felt by 
countries in the region over the coming years.... It is 
common belief in Israel that an intensification in the 
fighting could lead to a civil war and an attempt on 
the part of the Iranians to intervene and replace the 
Americans.... As U.S. elections draw closer, the more 
effort the radical elements in Iraq will make to strike 
at the American forces, cause more casualties and 
intensify their guerrilla and terror war.... The degree 
of American success will be determined not only by 
military plans, but also in keeping with the way in 
which the Americans will try to prevent a joint Sunni- 
Shiite uprising.  A continued increase in the number of 
casualties among the Iraqi civilian population will 
make it harder and harder for the Americans to achieve 
this objective.\" 
 
2. \"Facing a New War\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (April 9): \"Without intending to do so, the 
U.S. soldiers found themselves facing a battle not 
against Saddam\'s junky army but against the Muslim 
jihad army.... If they surrender, give-up, they will 
pave the way before the jihad brigades to Riyadh, Doha 
and Amman.  As it seems, the comparison between Iraq 
and Vietnam is not exaggerated.  In Vietnam the 
Americans tried to stop the Soviet communism, In Iraq 
they are trying to stop the Muslim jihadism.  The 
American determination in Vietnam paid off; the Soviet 
leadership was convinced it couldn\'t forcefully impose 
communism on Asia.  It is not certain that this will 
happen in Iraq.\" 
3. \"Organizing the Mess\" 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in 
Ha\'aretz (April 9): \"The resemblance between our 
invasion of Lebanon and America\'s invasion of Iraq is 
amazing.  Our soldiers were welcomed with cheers and 
rice; their soldiers were greeted with shouts of joy 
and the smashing of Saddam statues.  We wanted to 
create a new order in Lebanon; they wanted to create a 
new order in Iraq.  Within a short time, in our case 
and theirs, the Shiites woke up and the invading armies 
became targets of attack.  Commissions of inquiry were 
appointed, in Israel and America.  Both here and there, 
they called it another Vietnam.  We pulled out without 
achieving a thing, and Bush is still in there, mired in 
a sea of blood from which no good will come.  If I were 
in his shoes, I\'d send Saddam Hussein back to Iraq.  He 
would know how to organize the mess in no time.\" 
 
4. \"Leave the Clich Behind\" 
 
U.S. expert and Middle East lecturer Professor Ethan 
Gilboa wrote in mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (April 9): \"If the situation in Iraq would 
cause Bush\'s failure in the coming elections, the 
\"Spain syndrome\" might strengthen: terror that is 
followed by exchange of leaders in countries that 
supported the war.  This syndrome might reach Blair in 
Britain, Berlusconi in Italy and other leaders who 
supported the U.S.   This outcome might encourage all 
Islamic terror factions to mock the weak western 
liberal democracies and to enhance their efforts to 
hurt them.... This week Bush left to his Easter 
vacation in his farm in Texas but this is no time for 
vacation but for hard work.  Bush should recruit all 
forces -- including the EU and the UN -- for an effort 
to stabilize Iraq.  In the U.S. the pressure on Bush is 
growing to face his people and the world in order to 
explain what he intends to do beyond saying the known 
and worn clich: \'we will not let terror win\'.\"

\"Beware of International Involvement\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(April 9): \"It turns out that the person whose 
awareness has been most affected in the terrorist war 
of the past two years is Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. 
Proof of this is his decision to withdraw from the Gaza 
Strip, a unilateral step because, he says, Israel has 
no Palestinian partner.  But his insistence that 
Israeli actions be completely unilateral will 
eventually lead to increasing international 
involvement, which could get Israel entangled in 
imposed solutions.\"

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media highlighted PM Sharon\'s visit to the U.S. 
Sharon left Israel last night.  He is expected to meet 
with National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice today 
and with President Bush Wednesday.  Jerusalem Post 
quoted a senior Israeli source as saying that, even in 
light of Bush\'s current problems in Iraq, Sharon is 
expected a firm and solid U.S. statement backing his 
plan.  Ha\'aretz quoted sources in Jerusalem as saying 
that a disagreement remained regarding \"one or two 
words,\" and not on principles.  Sunday, Maariv reported 
that the defense establishment is considering 
dismantling settler outposts during Sharon\'s visit. 
 
Leading media quoted Bush as saying Monday in Crawford, 
Texas during his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak that the U.S. would continue to push for 
implementation of the road map even if Israel goes 
ahead with its planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. 
Sunday, Yediot wrote that Bush would tell Sharon that 
the U.S. supports his unilateral disengagement plan and 
that it views it as a first step towards the 
implementation of the road map.  Israel\'s Ambassador to 
the U.S. Danny Ayalon said this morning on Israel Radio 
that the plan is not part of the road map, which Israel 
supports but for which there is presently no partner. 
Yediot quoted senior sources \"associated with the 
understandings shaping up in the U.S.\" as saying that 
Bush will declare that the U.S. understands that, in 
the context of a final-status agreement between Israel 
and the Palestinians, Israel will not return to the 
1949 borders.  (Sunday, Ha\'aretz gave no sources for a 
similar report.)  Leading media quoted Sharon as 
stressing last night in the West Bank town of Ma\'aleh 
Adumim the importance to Israel of \"strong\" blocs of 
settlements, including Hebron and Kiryat Arba. 
 
All media reported that the Likud\'s Central Elections 
Committee has decided that the referendum on Sharon\'s 
plan will take place on April 29. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that the PA has 
expressed its opposition to any assurances that the 
U.S. might give Sharon in exchange for his unilateral 
withdrawal plan. 
 
All media (banners in Yediot and Maariv) reported that 
the Shin Bet and the other security forces foiled 10 
terrorist attacks planned for Passover, including a 
Fatah-Tanzim suicide bombing involving AIDS-infected 
blood.  Yediot quoted defense sources as saying that 
Hizbullah is responsible for 80 to 90 percent of 
terrorist attacks.  Jerusalem Post cited Hamas\'s denial 
on Monday that it has agreed to a cessation of attacks 
on Israel after the planned withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip.  All media reported that Monday before dawn IDF 
soldiers killed two gunmen and wounded a third when 
Palestinians tried to attack the Netzarim settlement in 
the Gaza Strip.  According to the IDF, eight terrorists 
were involved in the attempted infiltration, the 
responsibility of which was jointly claimed by Fatah, 
Hamas and Islamic Jihad. 
 
Hatzofe led with an \"exclusive\" report that Saturday 
night Sharon and Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres 
agreed on the formation of a \"left-wing\" government, in 
which Labor would get the foreign affairs and defense 
portfolios. 
 
Iraq: 
-Saturday, on Channel 2-TV, IDF Chief of Staff Moshe 
Ya\'alon said that he would not be surprised if chemical 
weapons were found in Iraq (cited by Ha\'aretz), and 
that Israel had told the U.S. before the Iraq War that 
the Americans had overstated Iraq\'s weapons capability 
(cited by Hatzofe).  Sunday, Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem 
Post reported that over the weekend thousands of 
Palestinians took part in demonstrations in support of 
the armed uprising against the U.S. and coalition 
forces in Iraq.  Jerusalem Post quoted Iraqi National 
Security Adviser Dr. Muafak Rube\'i as saying at a press 
conference that the U.S.-led coalition and the Iraqi 
Governing Council could ban Al Jazeera-TV and Al 
Arabiya-TV reported from Iraq for ratcheting up 
sectarian strife in Iraq. 
-Yediot quoted Iraqi FM Hoshyar Zebari and the 
commander of the U.S. forces in Iraq, Gen. John 
Abizaid, as saying Monday that Iran and Syria are 
behind the wave of kidnappings of foreign citizens in 
Iraq. 
-Sunday, Ha\'aretz reported that Israel has announced 
that it would no longer handle the case of Nabil 
Razouk, the Israeli Arab from East Jerusalem who was 
abducted in Iraq.  The newspaper quoted a spokesman for 
the Foreign Ministry as saying Saturday: \"The issue has 
been passed on to the USG and the company that hired 
him.\"  The spokesman added that Israel would no longer 
respond on the issue, and that it is waiting to get 
information from the U.S. State Department.  Sunday, 
Jerusalem Post cited an announcement by the Canadian 
government that the other \"Israeli\" abductee, Ahmed 
Yassin Tikati, is actually a Canadian citizen whose 
real name is Hissan Fadel. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited a report by the Jerusalem-based 
Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMP), 
headed by Bassem Eid, which found that over 11 percent 
of Palestinians killed during the Intifada died at the 
hands of other Palestinians. 
 
Sunday, Maariv featured the importance of the Jewish 
vote in the upcoming U.S. presidential elections. 
Jerusalem Post cited a newly-issued report by the Anti- 
Defamation League (ADL), summed up by ADL director 
Abraham Foxman: \"Anti-Semitism remains deeply engrained 
in Egyptian society and continues to be a destabilizing 
force in the Middle East.\"

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
I.  \"The Tenth Meeting\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (April 
13): \"The [U.S.] Administration has shown sympathy for 
the idea of evacuating the settlements and presented it 
as having \'historic potential,\' but asked in return 
that the disengagement appear part of the \'road map\' 
and not prevent the resumption of negotiations in the 
future.  To demonstrate this, the Americans insisted 
that Israel also evacuate settlements in the West Bank, 
and not stop at the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, 
which is in any case considered an irksome security, 
economic and moral burden.  Sharon has a problematic 
record of keeping political commitments.  Everyone 
remembers his promises to evacuate the outposts in the 
West Bank and to remove roadblocks in the territories, 
which were only partially and belatedly kept.  Despite 
this, American support and the great effort invested in 
achieving it, strengthen the chance that his 
disengagement plan will indeed be approved and carried 
out.... The American declarations on the permanent 
settlement are expected to support Israel\'s position 
that rules out withdrawal to the Green Line in the West 
Bank and rejects the Palestinian demand for the return 
of refugees to Israel.  The Americans wished to phrase 
them ambiguously, in a way compatible with their past 
statements -- not to tie their hands in the future, and 
not to complicate their relations with the Arab states 
and Europe.  This is therefore a symbolic achievement, 
which Sharon needs mainly due to the pressure of 
Binyamin Netanyahu and other Likud ministers.  They 
have conditioned their support for the plan on the 
annexation of settlement blocs and negating \'the right 
of return.\'\" 
 
II.  \"Sharon Wanted More\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea, who is part of Prime 
Minister Sharon\'s delegation to the U.S., wrote on page 
one of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot 
(April 13): \"The papers given last night for Bush to 
study included statements that were agreed on and 
statements in parentheses.  The parts in parentheses 
have not been agreed on.  The Americans agreed, for 
example, that the final status arrangement between 
Israel and the Palestinians will take into 
consideration the demographic situation created in the 
territories, a sort of intimation of recognition of 
some of the settlements.  Sharon wanted more.  He 
wanted it stated that the final status arrangement 
would take into consideration the large population 
centers of Jews, a hint to the settlement blocs.  He 
wanted it to be stated than the 1967 borders are not 
realistic.  For this he needed the President\'s consent. 
When [Sharon bureau head] Dov Weisglass left for 
Washington, he had in his bag 12 sections in 
parentheses.  One problem that was apparently resolved 
was Israel\'s fear of new diplomatic plans.  Bush will 
officially promise Sharon that the U.S. will not 
support any plan that deviates from the road map. 
Another issue that is close to being resolved regards 
the right of return.  Bush will state that the 
designated haven for refugees is the Palestinian state. 
This formulation is still far from what Netanyahu 
demanded, but it may satisfy [moderate Likud cabinet 
minister] Tzippi Livni.\" 
 
III.  \"A Summit of the Weak\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote on page one of 
Ha\'aretz (April 13): \"Since Sharon and Bush\'s last 
meetings, last summer, the two have sunk to a political 
nadir.  Bush is no longer the big winner of the 
\'mission accomplished\' in the Iraq war; he is no longer 
the maker of new order in the region.  His army is 
stuck in the Iraqi quagmire, and he is falling behind 
in the polls for the November elections.  He will have 
to work hard to beat his Democrat rival John Kerry and 
win a second term in office.  Sharon is haunted by the 
shadow of police investigations and the looming 
decision of the attorney general whether to indict him. 
His chances in the polls are plummeting too, and his 
public credibility is at a low.  Thus, Bush and Sharon 
will meet tomorrow in a summit of the weak, intended to 
help them a little and to demonstrate an 
achievement.... The main threat to Sharon\'s plan comes 
not from the Americans, even if their president is 
changed, and not even from the Likud.  The danger is 
that the Palestinians will try to repeat their 
achievement in Gaza and drive Israel by force out of 
the West Bank as well.  Perhaps to thwart this, Sharon 
resumed his threats on Arafat.  But his real challenge 
will be to maintain security and prevent a renewed 
outburst of terror, which the letter from Bush will not 
be able to thwart.\" 
 
 
 
 
IV.  \"The Beginning of the End of the Occupation\" 
 
Senior columnist Yoel Marcus wrote in Ha\'aretz (April 
13): \"Bush and Blair, two leaders in trouble, need some 
kind of success with regard to our conflict so as not 
to lose the Arab world.  Sharon will return from 
Washington with a green light for his plan.  It might 
not be exactly what he wanted, but it will give him 
enough of a tail wind to continue to pursue this, the 
most intensive and consistent leadership chapter in his 
life.  From the time he went public with his 
initiative, and until the Likud membership referendum, 
12 weeks will have passed.  If Mofaz is right, and the 
Likud, the cabinet, and the Knesset all approve the 
initiative, Sharon\'s plan may be deemed, to paraphrase 
Churchill, the beginning of the end of the occupation.\" 
 
V.  \"Respect the New Consensus\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(April 11): \"On the face of it, what is at stake here 
is the fate of several dozen settlements and their 
several thousand inhabitants. In fact, the stakes are 
much higher.... Even hawks like Ariel Sharon and Ehud 
Olmert have concluded that the so-called demographic 
problem is too serious to neglect, and even doves like 
Ehud Barak and Shlomo Ben-Ami have conceded that under 
their current leadership the Palestinians must be 
fought.  Between them, all these newly humbled leaders 
have all the makings of a new Israeli consensus: one 
that appreciates the attachment to any part of our 
ancestral land, but also realizes we are not alone 
here; one that understands that, while peace is worth 
concessions, it can only be struck with enemies who 
have truly abandoned the quest for destruction; and one 
that realizes that, in the foreseeable future, 
surviving here will still mean fighting some Arabs and 
demand solidarity among Jews.  Those who intend to 
brace for the referendum with violence, whether 
physical or verbal, would do well to understand that 
the Israeli public is no longer the impressionable one 
it was in previous years.  Today\'s Israelis crave and 
deserve the national solidarity of which the Right and 
Left once jointly deprived them.\"

2.  Iraq: 
--------- 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Ha\'aretz editorialized: \"The President of the U.S. can 
present to his guests [Mubarak and Sharon] one 
important lesson.... Occupation is not the end of a 
war.... It would appear that this lesson, which has 
been drawn after one year of warfare in Iraq, has yet 
to permeate the minds of Israel\'s decision makers, 
after 37 years of occupation.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
\"Between Iraq and Palestine\" 
 
Ha\'aretz editorialized (April 11): \"Events of the past 
week in Iraq are likely to create the erroneous 
impression that the rule of coalition forces in the 
country has totally collapsed.... Events are, indeed, 
dangerous and circumstances could have grave 
repercussions if they are not handled wisely and 
quickly. Nonetheless, it is still too early to talk in 
apocalyptic terms about a collapse of authority in 
Iraq.... In various parts of the world, including areas 
close to Israel, voices are articulating anew glee 
about the U.S. entanglement in Iraq.... As in the past, 
such militant voices drown out rational voices in the 
Arab world that speak not only for the genuine welfare 
of Iraq, but also for the aim of carrying out civil 
reform in their own countries.  It would appear that of 
all peoples in the region, the Palestinians are the 
last ones who should celebrate America\'s 
misfortunes.... For his part, the President of the U.S. 
can present to his guests [Mubarak and Sharon] one 
important lesson drawn from his war in the Middle East: 
Occupation is not the end of a war, but rather another 
phase -- it is perhaps the toughest stage, since it 
involves war against civilians.  Hence a local, 
national leadership is needed to continue the job.  It 
would appear that this lesson, which has been drawn 
after one year of warfare in Iraq, has yet to permeate 
the minds of Israel\'s decision makers, after 37 years 
of occupation.\"

SUBJECT: OVER 200 GAZA BUSINESSMEN LAMENT DELAYS AT KARNI 
CROSSING AND URGE \"ACTIVISTS\" NOT TO TARGET COMMERCIAL 
FACILITIES 
 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Ted Mann per 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (C) Embassy sources reported that over 200 Gazan 
businessmen attended a Chambers of Commerce meeting on April 
13 in Gaza City.  They attributed the large turnout to the 
seriousness of the problems facing businessmen caused by 
delays at Karni crossing.  (Karni is the only commercial 
crossing serving the Gaza Strip).  Although Karni is 
technically open, businessmen report that processing has been 
at a snail\'s pace for more than two weeks.  According to one 
source, trucks are waiting at the crossing for over seven 
days to make a delivery as opposed to the customary 24-48 
hours.  These delays have caused transportation costs to 
increase seven fold from an average of USD 230 per truckload 
to USD 1590.  Mohammed Yazeji, Seven-Up distributor, reported 
that his inability to receive inputs for over ten days has 
forced him to send 80 laborers \"on vacation.\"  Yazeji 
reported that many Gazan businessmen were facing similar 
circumstances. 
 
2.  (C)  Yazeji reported that businessmen were running out of 
ideas.  He said businessmen had already written to PA 
Minister of National Economy Maher el Masri; appealed to Gaza 
security head Mohammed Dahlan; and sent emissaries to \"all 
the groups\" asking them not to \"make actions\" near commercial 
crossings/interests -- all to no avail.  According to Yazeji, 
at the April 13 Chambers of Commerce meeting, businessmen 
decided to use the press to appeal to the GOI to restore full 
operations at Karni crossing and to tell the international 
community that Karni should be closed altogether if the GOI 
planned to only allow it to continue operating in drips and 
drabs.  Yazeji acknowledged that a complete closure would not 
help the cause, but said the private sector was grasping for 
ways to sensitize the international community to its plight. 
 
3.  (C)  Comment:  Time and time again, the Palestinian 
private sector has borne the brunt of terrorist acts and the 
resulting Israeli security crackdown and closure.  The GOI 
all but froze activity at Karni after terrorists stowed away 
in an empty container transiting the crossing and carried out 
the March 14 bombing at Ashdod port which killed ten 
Israelis.  The relief/donor community reacted quickly to this 
closure, issued international press releases, mobilized the 
UN and saw access for its humanitarian goods restored 
relatively quickly.  Normal operations were not/not, however, 
restored for the private sector. With no lobbying ability 
comparable to that of the international relief community and 
an apparent inability to dissuade militants from targeting 
commercial facilities/infrastructure, the private sector is 
truly caught in the middle.  A significant infrastructure 
upgrade that would improve security and still allow for the 
expeditious processing of goods is perhaps the most practical 
solution in the near term.  While such an upgrade has been 
discussed, no decisions have been taken by Israel, the 
Palestinians, or the donor community on what such an upgrade 
would entail and how it would be financed.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Finance Minister Netanyahu\'s declaration in late 
2003 that the recession has ended appears to look more 
realistic today than it did at the time.  There is 
increasing optimism in Israeli economic circles regarding a 
return to growth in 2004.  All indications currently point 
to growth of more than 3 percent in 2004, a significant 
improvement over the 2.5% figure that was used in the 
preparation of the 2004 budget last fall.  Increased 
exports, particularly in the high-tech sector, private 
consumption, and tax revenues are all headed in the right 
direction.  Unfortunately, it does not appear that all this 
good news will affect Israel\'s high unemployment rate any 
time soon. End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Exports: Engine of Growth 
------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The newfound Israeli economic optimism is based, in 
large part, on continued improvement in Israel\'s strong 
export sector, which grew 12 percent in the first two months 
of this year.  This sector is fueled by the recovery in 
world demand, which is expected to strengthen further over 
the coming year.  Bank Leumi underscored hopes for the year 
to come in its April macroeconomic survey by noting 
January/February 2004 exports were only 6% less than at the 
their highpoint in late 2000.  Leumi believes this 
impressive performance is destined to continue during the 
year and forecasts export growth of 8 - 9% in 2004, compared 
with 2.6% in 2003. 
 
3.  (SBU) High tech is also supplying a turbo boost to the 
economic engine.  The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) 
reports that electronic component and computer exports 
increased 48.8% from December 2003 to February 2004.  In the 
same three-month period, exports of control communication 
and medical equipment increased by 17.7%. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Netanyahu: Cutting Taxes to Boost Growth 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The recent growth spurt is boosting GOI tax 
revenues.  These grew 12.4% to NIS 38.6 billion in the first 
quarter of 2004 compared to a year earlier.  Finance 
Minister Netanyahu has capitalized on this windfall by 
cutting taxes twice this year alone (reftel).  In the first 
round of cuts in mid-February, he reduced purchase taxes on 
a number of consumer items as well as lowered customs and 
VAT taxes from 18% to 17%, effective March 1.  The cuts 
immediately led to increased discretionary consumer 
spending.  Import figures from February to March show this 
clearly: sales of imported refrigerators grew 193%, imported 
DVD players 109%, and imported televisions 60%.  Even the 
dormant real estate market may be coming out of its long 
sleep: land tax revenues improved by 15.2 percent in the 
first quarter of 2004. 
 
5.  (SBU) Netanyahu introduced his second round of cuts on 
April fifth when he announced the GOI was reducing income 
taxes on low and mid-level wage earners, gradually reducing 
corporate taxes between 2004 and 2007, as well as canceling 
taxes on a number of raw materials in the building sector, 
which could also provide a boost for the building and 
construction sector. 
 
6.  (SBU) Netanyahu has made it clear that he prefers tax 
cuts to increased GOI spending or to reduced GOI debt 
levels.  As of the beginning of April, 2004 tax revenues 
were forecast to exceed the original forecast used in the 
2004 Budget proposal of NIS 150 billion by between NIS 2 
billion to 4 billion.  There is agreement among many 
economists that Netanyahu\'s tax cuts will have a positive 
effect on spending habits, on business activity, and will 
serve to boost economic activity. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Tax Reductions Aside: GOI Will 
Likely Meet 2004 4% Deficit Goal 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) In spite of Netanyahu\'s significant tax cuts, the 
most recent economic predictions indicate he will probably 
be able to meet the GOI\'s 2004 budget deficit target of 4%. 
This also corresponds to the conditions preliminarily 
specified in the 2003 Loan Guarantee Agreement.  It would 
also be an improvement over the 2003 deficit, which totaled 
NIS 27.7 billion, or 5.6% of GDP.  To put the improved 
budgetary framework into perspective, the deficit for the 
first three months of 2004 totaled just NIS 587 million, 
compared with NIS 4.3 billion in the same period a year ago. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
David Klein: Tax Cuts Must Be Balanced by Debt Reduction 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
8. (SBU) Netanyahu\'s philosophy has its critics, prominent 
among them Bank of Israel Governor David Klein (reftel). 
Philosophically, Klein believes that Israel\'s very high debt 
to GDP ratio, which reached 105% in 2003, needs to be cut. 
He argues that reducing public sector debt would be 
beneficial both for Israel\'s reputation in international 
financial circles, as well as for the domestic economy.   He 
also noted in a March thirtieth press release that reducing 
debt would reduce the GOI\'s heavy debt-servicing load, 
freeing up funds for pressing social-economic programs. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Passover Joy in the Tourist Sector 
---------------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU)   Before the Intifada, tourism (counted 
statistically as a service export) served as one of the key 
components of Israeli growth.  Since the violence began, 
however, this sector collapsed almost entirely.  Although 
the jury is still out for tourism this year, there was a 44% 
increase in tourist entries during the first two months of 
2004 compared with a year earlier.  (Note: Some of the 
increase is a result of the significant impact of the Iraq 
war on the corresponding period of 2003.)  The feared 
Palestinian reprisal over the Yassin killing, and its 
predicted impact on tourism, highlights the fragility of 
this sector, however. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Venture Capitalists also Celebrating 
------------------------------------ 
 
10. (SBU) Israeli venture capitalists have also been 
celebrating recently.  Zeev Holtzman, Chairman of IVC 
Research and the Giza VC Fund, proclaimed in a March 17th 
press release that \"2003 marked the beginning of new fund 
raising after a long, difficult dry spell in the industry.\" 
Holtzman cited IVC forecasts that Israeli VCs will raise 
between USD 1.5 billion and USD 2 billion between 2004 and 
2005.  Another sign of an improvement in the industry is the 
success of Israeli venture capital conferences held in 
Israel, London and New York in the last two months. 
Although Ernst and Young (Israel) chairman Yitzchak Forer 
predicted in an interview with Globes on March 22 that high- 
tech activity will return to the level of 1999 this year, 
his enthusiasm is not widely shared. Israeli fund managers 
with whom we have spoken are generally cautious and say that 
investors are subjecting Israeli firms to much more rigorous 
examination than during the height of the tech boom. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Unemployment remains high and entrenched 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11. (SBU) Unfortunately, the positive economic news has not 
yet translated into a reduction in Israel\'s unemployment 
rate.  Average unemployment in 2003 was 10.7%, and rose to 
10.9% in the fourth quarter of 2003.  The Israel Discount 
Bank reported in its April 5 economic summary that 
unemployment in 2004 would rise to 11%.  Bank Leumi\'s chief 
economist, Gil Bufman, has repeatedly commented that he does 
not expect unemployment to fall before 2005, when firms may 
begin to think the recovery will last over the longer term. 
Although the GOI is making a concerted effort to reduce the 
number of foreign workers working in Israel, this has also 
not had a significant effect on the unemployment rate. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Monetary Policy: Negative Inflation 
in 2003 Leads BOI to Continue Rate Reductions 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
12. (SBU) For the first time in its history, Israel saw 
prices fall in 2003, as high interest rates, declining 
wages, and positive exchange rate trends all worked in the 
same, unexpected direction.  The Bank of Israel reacted by 
setting out on an extended policy of interest rate 
reductions, which continued for the thirteenth consecutive 
month in March 2004.  The question now is whether the BOI 
will continue its policy of monthly interest rate cuts. 
The BOI last reduced rates by 0.2 percent on March 29, 
bringing interest rates to 4.1 percent.  This is a reduction 
of 5% since December 2002, a drop that has provided added 
stimulus to economic growth and received praise from the 
Ministry of Finance.

Sharon Visit April 14 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media underscored PM Sharon\'s expected meeting with 
President Bush at the White House today.  Media like 
Yediot and Israel Radio say that Bush will reject the 
right of return for Palestinian refugees and state that 
eventually Israel will not return to its 1949 borders. 
However, Ha\'aretz notes that there were still some last- 
minute gaps between what Sharon wants and what the Bush 
administration is ready to grant him less than 24 hours 
before the slated meeting.  Ha\'aretz reported that the 
U.S. is only ready to offer vague language on the 
recognition of large blocs of settlements in the West 
Bank.  The newspaper quoted Israeli sources in Sharon\'s 
entourage as saying that the language agreed upon so 
far is \"reasonable\" and justified Sharon\'s trip, and 
that the gaps that remain are not significant. 
Jerusalem Post cited optimism expressed by senior 
officials traveling with Sharon that he will receive 
the commitments from Bush to pass the disengagement 
plan through the Likud referendum.  Hatzofe bannered: 
\"Theater at the White House.\" 
 
This morning, Israel Radio reported that Secretary of 
State Colin Powell spoke in the past few hours with 
representatives of the Quartet, UN Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan and the foreign ministers of Germany and 
Russia.  He also spoke with the foreign minister of 
Jordan. The radio quoted Annan as telling reporters 
that he hoped that Israel\'s withdrawal would be within 
the framework of the road map and would not prevent the 
establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. 
 
All media reported that the Likud referendum over 
Sharon\'s disengagement was pushed back three days to 
May 2, because of the Final Four basketball tournament 
scheduled on April 29, which could have caused a low 
turnout at the vote.   Ha\'aretz reported that, upon his 
return from Washington, Sharon will take part in two 
debates against Minister Uzi Landau, who is leading the 
campaign within the Likud against the disengagement 
plan. 
 
Leading media reported that Tuesday IDF troops and 
settlers scuffled on the outskirts of Kiryat Arba, near 
Hebron, as yet another attempt was made to evacuate the 
wildcat outpost of Hazon David.  Ha\'aretz reported that 
the settler leaders are considering giving orders to 
evacuate willingly, or with minor resistance, outposts 
slated for dismantling in the next few days. 
 
Leading media reported that the police have recently 
discovered a cell of smugglers, who passed weapons from 
Egypt to terrorist groups in the Palestinian 
territories through the Negev.  Israeli Bedouins were 
among those arrested. 
 
Leading media reported that Tuesday clashes pitting 
Palestinian demonstrators and anti-fence activists 
against IDF soldiers continued at Biddu village, 
northwest of Jerusalem. 
 
All media reported that the Hungarian authorities have 
thwarted an apparent attempt by Arab terrorists to blow 
up a Holocaust Memorial Museum in Budapest which was 
due to be inaugurated by President Moshe Katsav on 
Thursday.  Initial, unsubstantiated reports asserted 
that the three suspects arrested -- a Hungarian dentist 
of Palestinian origin and two Syrian men -- had 
intended to assassinate Katsav at the museum\'s opening 
ceremony. 
 
Israel Radio reported that the defense establishment 
has decided to give up temporarily a shipment of Hummer 
jeeps from the U.S. so that they can be used in Iraq. 
The station quoted Israeli security sources as saying 
that they understand the United States\' operational 
needs. 
 
Hatzofe cited the Spanish daily El Mundo as saying that 
the Islamic terrorists who carried out the March 11 
Madrid bombings had intended to blow up Jewish targets 
around Madrid. 
 
Jerusalem Post carried a full-page paid ad presented by 
the Committee to Return Pollard Home upon the occasion 
of Sharon\'s meeting with Bush.

Veteran op-ed writer and the late prime minister 
Yitzhak Rabin\'s assistant Eytan Haber opined in the

lend [Sharon] a shoulder, an open and generous hand, 
the support that Sharon so badly needs.  But the United 
States has been consistent since 1967.\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"The question ... is not what to \'give\' Sharon, but 
when will Bush return to his bold vision of refusing to 
give in to Arab radicalism.\" 
 
Liberal columnist Gideon Samet wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"Such a bewildered Bush makes 
easy prey for Sharon, who possesses animal-like 
political senses.\" 
 
In an \"open letter\" to President Bush, conservative 
columnist Nadav Haetzni wrote in Maariv: \"Don\'t agree 
to serve as an extra in the Sharon family\'s survival 
show and don\'t let Ariel Sharon weaken Israel.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Irony of History\" 
 
Former foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (April 14): \"The 
\'President Clinton outline\' for an Israeli-Palestinian 
arrangement, the final product of the negotiations held 
during the term of the Barak government at the end of 
2000, is probably not a particularly well-liked term by 
President Bush or Prime Minister Sharon, each for his 
own reasons.  But the boundaries of the outline are 
precisely those that Sharon presented in his speech in 
Ma\'aleh Adumim, on the eve of his departure for 
Washington, as the guarantees that he wishes to obtain 
from Bush on the shape of the final status arrangement 
that will follow in wake of the disengagement from the 
Gaza Strip.  The Barak government was the first and 
only of Israel\'s governments that obtained American 
presidential recognition of the principle of settlement 
blocs, thereby changing the traditional U.S. policy of 
viewing the settlements as an \'obstacle to peace,\' to 
recognizing the settlements as a vital element in 
defining the map of peace between Israel and the 
Palestinians.  Bush and Sharon do not have to make an 
effort to reinvent the wheel.... If we, the negotiators 
on behalf of Barak\'s government, have a part, even the 
smallest part, in this copyright, we too are willing to 
waive it for the sake of the matter -- as long as the 
Likud government finally makes the transition from the 
heights of wordy ideology to the simple logic of what 
it is really possible to obtain in order to put an end 
to the bloody conflict and provide Israel with security 
within improved borders.\" 
II.  \"Until the Last Moment\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote from 
Washington in popular, pluralist Maariv (April 14): 
\"The main problem at the present time is the Americans\' 
desperate need to harness the rest of the world, 
particularly the United Nations, to Sharon\'s plan.... 
The chances of the disengagement plan gaining political 
acceptance in Israel depend on the Americans, who 
depend on the UN.... Bush is prepared to turn a blind 
eye to the fence ... but he isn\'t prepared to walk the 
\'extra step\' that would allow Sharon to wave a clear 
declaration and to tell the Right: \'I told you so\' 
while sending the Palestinians to hell.  The American 
approach isn\'t a uniform one -- the contrary is true. 
As time goes by, there is a growing difference between 
State Department officials, from Colin Powell on the 
left, and National Security Council hawks, from Elliott 
Abrams on the right -- count in the chums Cheney and 
Rumsfeld.... Tonight ... Bush and Sharon will try to 
square the circle ... to please Israel without angering 
the Arabs.\" 
 
III.  \"Return in Peace\" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer and the late prime minister 
Yitzhak Rabin\'s assistant Eytan Haber opined in the 
lead editorial of Yediot Aharonot (April 14): 
\"Undeniably, Sharon made an extremely large and 
dramatic step from his personal standpoint, when he 
chose to follow the path of disengagement.  The \'lame\' 
Bush can lend him a shoulder, an open and generous 
hand, the support that Sharon so badly needs.  But the 
United States has been consistent since 1967, and if it 
budges in one direction or another, it is always an 
inch to here, an inch to there.  The U.S. is good with 
intricate phrasing, verbal acrobatics and ambiguities, 
but when it comes down to brass tacks, it remains the 
same U.S.: obstinate and uncompromising in its peace 
plans, which refuse to recognize the settlements and 
calling for an end to the \'occupation.\'  Therefore, we 
must believe, hope and pray that the Prime Minister of 
Israel, the prime minister of us all, will bring 
something real and tangible from the president of the 
U.S. and return in peace (and with the very beginnings 
of the peace process) from his visit to the man who is, 
almost, master of the world.\" 
 
IV.  \"Bush and Sharon\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(April 14): \"The choice is not between the road map and 
Sharon\'s plan, but between disengagement and Bush\'s 
original plan: Palestinian regime change.... Sharon\'s 
plan does not challenge Arafat\'s immunity, and 
therefore postpones the day of reckoning with the de 
facto Palestinian terror state.  This is hardly how the 
road map was supposed to proceed, let alone Bush\'s 
original vision.  But all Sharon is really doing is 
showing Bush a mirror of how the Palestinians have been 
allowed to distort his vision.  The question then, is 
not what to \'give\' Sharon, but when will Bush return to 
his bold vision of refusing to give in to Arab 
radicalism.  Such a return to boldness would begin by 
ruling out any Palestinian \'return\' to Israel as a 
matter of principle, not just through a supposed 
Israeli veto over the number of Palestinian immigrants. 
It is a sad commentary on the sate of the West that, to 
begin to fight terrorism in earnest, Bush had to defy 
almost all of enlightened world opinion.  We hope that 
Bush rediscovers in himself such reservoirs of 
defiance, which are perhaps most necessary when it 
comes to the destroy-Israel corner of the global war. 
If he does, we are confident that he will not only make 
more decisive progress on the ground, but remind 
Americans why they had such confidence in his 
leadership.\" 
 
V.  \"Bush\'s Last Chance\" 
 
Liberal columnist Gideon Samet wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 14): \"The memory of the 
thousands of votes that threatened [Bush\'s] election 
four years ago is a nightmare that now forces him to 
walk between the drops, that may even be drops of blood 
from our local conflict.  As such, Bush has been the 
most negligent president in handling the conflict -- a 
weak shadow of Carter, Bush Sr. and Clinton.  Such a 
bewildered Bush makes easy prey for Sharon, who 
possesses animal-like political senses.... This is a 
problematic time frame from a political perspective -- 
both in Washington and here.  But this is also the last 
chance of a mediocre American president to snatch 
success from the jaws of his failures.  Success would 
mean compelling Sharon, for a change, to carry out his 
current promise on an accelerated schedule, and to 
anchor it with a link to a wider accord.  If starting 
from tonight Bush misses his chance, Israel\'s well- 
wishers will not be able to forgive him.\" 
 
 
 
VI.  \"Forward American Outpost\" 
 
In an \"open letter\" to President Bush, conservative 
columnist Nadav Haetzni wrote in Maariv (April 14): 
\"Associating with losers isn\'t exactly what you need at 
this time.... Even if the suicidal move that Sharon is 
concocting for Israel isn\'t your chief concern, you had 
better caution yourself about him, in view of the 
lesson learned in Iraq.  It turns out that we know how 
to handle quagmires much better than you.... More 
importantly, as far as you are concerned, Israel now 
serves as an advanced outpost on the front against the 
hostile Islamic civilization, which is threatening to 
rise up against the entire West.... As George Keegan, 
former head of intelligence of the USAF, has said, 
Israel equals five CIAs.  But Israel will continue to 
be an asset only as long as it remains strong.  Loss of 
territory, of intelligence capabilities and mainly of 
its deterrent image, will once more turn that asset 
into a burden.  Thus, don\'t agree to serve as an extra 
in the Sharon family\'s survival show and don\'t let 
Ariel Sharon weaken Israel.  Explain to him in your 
tongue that one shouldn\'t surrender to terror or 
renounce strategic assets.  If not for us, at least for 
it for yourselves.\"

SUBJECT: REACTION TO BUSH-SHARON MEETING: SHARON GOT WHAT 
HE NEEDS 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Richard LeBaron for reason 1.4 (b) and 
 (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Key Likud disengagement supporters and the 
major media are declaring PM Sharon victorious after learning 
of the assurances Sharon received in his April 14 meeting 
with President Bush.  They also assess that Sharon obtained 
what he needs from the U.S. to push his disengagement plan 
through a fractious Likud Party referendum on the unilateral 
withdrawal plan slated for May.  While the small group of 
hardest-core disengagement opponents from across Likud and 
the two rightist coalition partners dismiss the USG 
assurances as inadequate and nothing new, key Likud fence 
straddlers on disengagement appear to be moving in favor of 
the plan.  FinMin Netanyahu, while not yet definitively 
expressing support for the plan, reportedly stated he is 
satisfied with President Bush\'s assurances, including on the 
Palestinian refugee issue.  Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres 
is embracing President Bush\'s position, declaring that it 
\"conforms to the Labor Party\'s positions,\" clearly signaling 
Labor\'s readiness to join a Likud-led coalition.  End summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Key Players Satisfied 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Key Likud supporters of PM Sharon and his 
controversial unilateral disengagement plan are thrilled with 
the assurances Sharon received from President Bush April 14 
in exchange for moving forward with his unilateral withdrawal 
plan.  Defense Minister Mofaz announced on April 14 that 
\"Today marks an important milestone toward creating a new and 
improved political and security reality for Israel.  One 
should welcome these significant and unprecedented 
understandings that were reached... which... anchor extremely 
vital Israeli political and security interests.\"  (Note: PM 
Sharon\'s son and Likud MK, Omri Sharon, told poloff on April 
14, prior to the Washington press conference, that the 
Defense Minister would play a leading role in the 
pro-disengagement referendum campaign to lend credibility to 
Sharon\'s assurances that the plan would boost Israel\'s 
security.)  Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declared that 
President Bush\'s letter constitutes a historic achievement. 
 
3.  (C) Several Likud ministers who had been straddling the 
fence on the withdrawal plan indicated after the release of 
the White House assurances that they can now support it.  In 
an Israel radio report on April 15, Netanyahu reportedly 
expressed satisfaction with President Bush\'s assurances, even 
though they do not explicitly address one of Netanyahu\'s 
conditions for supporting the plan: that there be no 
withdrawal from Gaza until the separation fence -- in a route 
that includes the Ariel settlement bloc -- is completed. 
Netanyahu has not yet, however, come out squarely in support 
of Sharon\'s plan.  Immigrant Absorption Minister Tzipi Livni, 
one of the undecided Likud ministers, reportedly announced 
that with the U.S. assurances particularly regarding views on 
right of return, she would support the disengagement plan. 
Education Minister Limor Livnat, still holding out, said she 
would reserve judgment on the U.S. assurances and the plan 
until she sees \"exactly what was said.\"  PM Sharon called key 
Likud leaders from Washington.  He reportedly announced that 
he will meet with Likud ministers about the plan on April 16, 
when he returns from the U.S. 
 
4.  (C) Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres openly embraced 
President Bush\'s April 14 statements and the U.S. assurances, 
reportedly stating that \"President Bush\'s speech almost 
completely conforms to the Labor Party\'s positions calling 
for the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 
1967 borders with minor border adjustments which take into 
consideration the Jewish settlements in the territories and 
Israel\'s security needs.\"  He added that President Bush\'s 
statement on the Palestinian right of return also conforms 
with Labor\'s position.  Peres\' statements set the stage for 
Labor joining a Likud government if and when the rightist 
parties bolt.  Justice Minister Tommy Lapid, leader of the 
coalition partner Shinui Party, praised President Bush\'s 
assurances, stating that they \"bolster Israel\'s standing in 
exchange for Sharon\'s disengagement plan.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Disengagement Opponents Discount U.S. Assurances 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5.  (SBU) Not surprising were the responses by ideological 
opponents of unilateral withdrawal both from those on the 
right opposed to withdrawing from settlements, and those on 
the left opposed to moving forward without negotiating with 
the Palestinians.  Housing Minister Eifi Eitam of the 
rightist coalition partner National Religious Party, 
dismissed President Bush\'s and PM Sharon\'s statements as 
\"word games\" that \"do not provide a response to the security 
threats and the unbearably high economic price of the plan.\" 
Another leader in the anti-disengagement plan campaign, Likud 
Minister-without-Portfolio Uzi Landau, referred to President 
Bush\'s statements as \"sadly inadequate... which contain 
nothing new.\"  He called on Likud ministers to help foil the 
plan.  MK Yuri Stern of the rightist National Union coalition 
party, assessed that PM Sharon \"failed to attain any 
strategic achievement even from a friendly President like 
Bush.\"   Yossi Sarid of the leftist Meretz party said that he 
\"fail(s) to see anything new in the U.S. stand,\" although new 
left-wing Yahad party leader Yossi Beilin reportedly stated 
that \"Bush\'s statements constitute a basis for an 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement.\" 
 
--------------------------------- 
Media Declares Victory for Sharon 
--------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) Israeli media commentary universally portrayed 
Wednesday\'s events as a major victory for Sharon.  The 
leading pundits underlined the historic importance of what 
they defined as unprecedented U.S. statements rejecting the 
\"right of return\" of Palestinian refugees to Israel.  Many 
also saw in the President\'s remarks the first statement by a 
U.S. leader legitimizing the settlements, although Ze\'ev 
Schiff of Ha\'aretz and Ben Caspit of Ma\'ariv cautioned that 
the President\'s language on territorial issues, such as 
recognizing demographic realities on the ground, could apply 
as much to the reality of expanding Palestinian areas of 
Jerusalem as to the settlements. 
 
7.  (SBU) Going beyond the substantive issues, commentators 
stressed the political side of Wednesday\'s meeting.  \"No one 
can allow himself the luxury of not meddling in the other\'s 
elections,\" Yedioth\'s Nahum Barnea noted.  Sharon was seen as 
receiving a big boost toward winning approval of the 
disengagement initiative in the coming Likud referendum, not 
only from the President, but also from the strident 
Palestinian and Arab reaction to the President\'s statements. 
Commentators saw Sharon reciprocating with his statement 
praising the President\'s steadfastness against terror, and 
with his refusal to meet with Sen. Kerry. 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) Judging from the positive statements by key coalition 
and Likud players, such as Netanyahu, and major media 
analysts, U.S. assurances provided PM Sharon a surfeit of 
ammunition to convince Likud voters to support his 
disengagement plan in next month\'s referendum.  As the major 
daily Yedioth Ahronoth put it, \"Bush gave Sharon words, only 
words, but what words.\"

Sharon Visit April 14 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The joint White House press conference of President 
Bush and PM Sharon at the White House Wednesday, and 
the subsequent exchange of letters between them, 
dominate the media.  Bush endorsed Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan, calling it \"brave and courageous.\" 
Yediot bannered a comment by Sharon: \"This is a 
commitment, the likes of which we never received from 
America.\"  Israel Radio quoted Israel\'s Ambassador to 
the U.S. as saying that this is a tremendous diplomatic 
achievement that will bring hope to the peace process, 
and that it represents a hint that the PA should 
renounce support for terrorism.  The radio reported 
that Sharon\'s flight home was delayed by three hours 
following his demand to see the final version of Bush\'s 
letter, and that the State Department tried to tone 
down its contents until the last moment. 
 
Ha\'aretz and other media reported that Bush\'s letter 
states that Israel will not return to the 1949 
armistice lines and that Palestinian refugees will not 
return to Israel.  Some commentators wondered about the 
meaning of the term \"rather than\" in Bush\'s remark at 
the press conference, which called for \"the 
establishment of a Palestinian state and the settling 
of Palestinian refugees there, rather than Israel.\" The 
media also reported that, in his letter, Bush said \"new 
realities on the ground\" -- meaning concentrations of 
Jewish settlers in the territories -- would have to be 
taken in consideration.  Israel Radio quoted a senior 
member of Sharon\'s delegation as saying that a document 
appended to Bush\'s letter says that details about the 
fence route around Ariel will be clarified.  Sharon\'s 
letter states: \"According to this [the disengagement] 
plan, the State of Israel intends to relocate military 
installations and all Israeli villages and towns in the 
Gaza Strip, as well as other military installations and 
a small number of villages in Samaria [the northern 
West Bank].  In his letter, Sharon also pledges to 
limit the growth of settlements, remove unauthorized 
outposts and allow freedom of movement for 
\"Palestinians not engaged in terrorism.\" 
 
Leading media reported that Sharon declined to meet 
with Democratic presidential contender Sen. John Kerry. 
Israel Radio noted that Sharon gave a tight schedule as 
the reason for his refusal. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Sharon will convene his 
cabinet upon his return from Washington.  The media 
reported that mainstream Likud cabinet ministers such 
as Ehud Olmert and Tzippi Livni welcomed the U.S.- 
Israeli understandings.  Israel Radio noted that 
Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu greeted the 
achievements reached at Wednesday\'s meeting, but has 
reservations about the U.S. position on the route of 
the fence.  The radio noted that FM Silvan Shalom has 
not expressed himself in the matter, and quoted 
Minister Uzi Landau as saying that he is calling on the 
Likud to thwart Sharon\'s plan, commitments by former 
U.S. presidents have not been kept.  Landau 
specifically mentioned Ronald Reagan\'s pledge that 
Saudi fighter planes would not be stationed near 
Israel\'s border.  Yediot quoted settler leader Shaul 
Goldstein as saying: \"Bush\'s statements about beginning 
to evacuate settlements are very dangerous.  He didn\'t 
even mention keeping settlement blocs.\"  IDF Radio 
reported that former PM Ehud Barak has called on Sharon 
to finish building the separation fence quickly as part 
of an emergency program before the withdrawal from Gaza 
and the removal of settlements from the West Bank. 
Barak called upon the Labor Party to provide, under 
certain circumstances, a safety net to Sharon against 
right-wing opposition, but also criticized him for 
proposing the disengagement plan only now.  Yahad party 
leader and Geneva Accord co-initiator Yossi Beilin told 
Israel Radio that he fears that Sharon\'s plan could 
mark the end of Sharon\'s concessions. 
 
Ha\'aretz (English Ed.) published a Letter to the Editor 
by Peace Now secretary-general Yariv Oppenheimer, who 
endorses \"every evacuation of land in the occupied 
territories,\" along with the Geneva Accord. 
Oppenheimer writes that Peace Now is convinced that its 
position will not cause a conflict inside the peace 
camp. 
 
Leading media quoted PA Chairman Yasser Arafat, 
Palestinian PM Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) and other 
Palestinian officials as saying that the understandings 
between the U.S. and Israel signify the end of the 
peace process.  Qurei said that Bush is the first U.S. 
president to recognize settlements.  The media quoted 
Geneva Accord co-initiator and former PA minister 
Yasser Abed Rabbo as saying that the road map has been 
replaced by Sharon\'s plan. 
 
This morning, Israel Radio reported that the Irish EU 
presidency responded to the Bush-Sharon meeting by 
saying that any plan to allow Israel to hold onto 
territory captured in 1967 must be with the consent of 
the Palestinians. 
 
Israel Radio reported that this morning Al Jazeera-TV 
and Al Arabiya-TV released an audiotape purportedly 
from Osama bin Laden, threatening to exact revenge on 
Israel for the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that two weeks ago the IDF arrested a 
16-year-old Palestinian who admitted to having been a 
\"talent scout\" for Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades would-be 
suicide bombers. 
Leading media reported that Wednesday twelve people 
were wounded in clashes between Border Police and 
protesters demonstrating against the fence at Biddu 
village, west of Jerusalem.  The media also reported 
that two youths were wounded in clashes between 
settlers and security forces at the site of the Hazon 
David outpost between Kiryat Arba and Hebron. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited a poll conducted among 
Palestinians by the Gaza-based General Institute for 
Information: 
-94.1 percent of Palestinians believe there is a state 
of lawlessness and chaos in PA-controlled territories. 
-Only 29.2 percent of the respondents blame the Israeli 
occupation for the failure of the PA to enforce law and 
order; 25 percent believe that the PA leadership is 
responsible for the anarchy because it has lost control 
over the situation; 19.1 percent blame the absence of a 
proper judicial system; 16 percent say that the problem 
is the existence of centers of power within the PA; 25 
percent say the PA security forces are responsible for 
the deterioration.

Sharon Visit April 14: 
---------------------- 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote from Washington on 
page one of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot: \"Wednesday, President Bush gave Sharon 
winning cards in his campaign for the registered Likud 
members, and what Bush did not give, the negative, if 
not hysterical, reaction in the Arab world and the 
Palestinian Authority will.\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: 
\"Israel would do well not to ignore Bush\'s words. The 
American leader again promised the Palestinians a 
viable state, and a state cannot be viable when it is 
made up of patches of territory.\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one 
of popular, pluralist Maariv: \"We must not miss the 
fact that Bush is embracing Sharon, adopting 
disengagement, going with it and describing it as a 
courageous and daring historical step.\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote on 
page one of Maariv: \"Bush\'s declaration sounded so pro- 
Israel that no one in Ramallah or Gaza will dare to 
stand in the suicide bombers\' way.\" 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in Ha\'aretz: 
\"Just because Bush and Sharon have written a new script 
for the Palestinians doesn\'t mean they will follow it.\" 
 
 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the editorial of Yediot Aharonot: 
\"Bush justly referred to Sharon\'s decision to withdraw 
as a \'historic decision\'; indeed it is historic, and a 
majority of the Israeli people supports it.  As to the 
national-diplomatic achievement of Sharon\'s visit to 
Bush, things are far more equivocal.\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"It is a measure of how far Israel\'s diplomatic 
position has fallen that yesterday\'s exchange of 
letters between George W. Bush and Ariel Sharon should 
be considered a signal victory.\" 
 
Columnist Haggai Huberman wrote in nationalist, 
Orthodox Hatzofe: \"For 36 years the United States has 
advocated an Israeli withdrawal from Judea, Samaria and 
Gaza [the territories].  Contrary to Sharon\'s request, 
Bush made no real commitment Wednesday about the final 
status arrangement.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Bush Has Already Voted\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote from Washington on 
page one of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot 
(April 15): \"Wednesday, President Bush gave Sharon 
winning cards in his campaign for the registered Likud 
members, and what Bush did not give, the negative, if 
not hysterical, reaction in the Arab world and the 
Palestinian Authority will.  Bush gave Sharon words, 
just words, but what words.  Sharon is right when he 
says that Israel has not received words like those 
since the establishment of the State of Israel -- and 
certainly not since 1967.... With all the festive talk 
about the road map and about its stated goal -- the 
establishment of a Palestinian state -- both the Bush 
administration and Sharon have moved further away from 
the vision of a Palestinian state.  Until now the 
Palestinians have had a government without a state. 
Now they are being offered a state without a 
government.  There probably isn\'t anything like that in 
the world.... Sharon has urged people [Israelis] not to 
rush out and dance in the streets.  The President\'s 
letter is no Balfour Declaration.  With that having 
been said, after his meeting with Bush, he acted like 
someone who has already won the campaign.\" 
II.  \"Double-Edge Bush\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(April 15): \"Whoever tries to present U.S. President 
George Bush\'s statements as the second Balfour 
Declaration in terms of their importance to Israel, is 
getting carried away.  The most significant achievement 
was the emphasis placed on the fact that a solution for 
the Palestinian refugees will be outside the borders of 
the Jewish state, as Israel has long demanded.  In 
other words, if the right of return\' exists, it will be 
realized inside a future Palestinian state, and not 
inside Israel, which Bush again defined as a Jewish 
state.  On the territorial front, however, the 
achievement is only partial, and Israel would do well 
not to ignore Bush\'s words. The American leader again 
promised the Palestinians a viable state, and a state 
cannot be viable when it is made up of patches of 
territory.\" 
 
III.  \"Presidential Embrace\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one 
of popular, pluralist Maariv (April 15): \"Wednesday, 
Sharon got his hug, and his candy too.  It is 
reasonable to assume that he will rise in the polls 
that are really important, the [Likud] party members\' 
polls.... What is great about Bush\'s statements 
Wednesday is that they can be interpreted in any 
direction.  Here, there and everywhere.  Nonetheless, 
we must not miss the fact that Bush is embracing 
Sharon, adopting disengagement, going with it and 
describing it as a courageous and daring historical 
step.  Bush is telling members of the Likud: \'You need 
to support Sharon on his own merits.  Who am I to 
defend him?  But do not forget: a \"no\" to Sharon is 
also a \"no\" to America.\'  And America is not in a 
situation where it is willing to hear one more no. 
Certainly not from us.\" 
 
 
 
 
IV.  \"He Got It\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote on 
page one of Maariv (April 15): \"As of last night, 
Sharon was the big winner.  If the Likud referendum 
were to be held today he would receive the full 
dividend.  But nothing is final yet.  Europe will rebel 
against America.  The Arab world will not acquiesce. 
The crescendo of Bush and Sharon is so deafeningly loud 
that Abu Ala will not be able to praise the unilateral 
withdrawal as he had planned.  If these developments 
lead to a resumption of Palestinian terror in full 
force -- because Bush\'s declaration sounded so pro- 
Israel that no one in Ramallah or Gaza will dare to 
stand in the suicide bombers\' way -- the achievement 
could turn into a Pyrrhic victory.  Too much success at 
a heavy price necessarily carries the seeds of failure. 
But not last night.  As of now the celebrations are at 
their height.  A great achievement for Sharon, with 
question marks nearby.\" 
 
V.  \"Rewriting the Script\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in Ha\'aretz 
(April 15): \"Sharon exploited Bush\'s current political 
weakness, but paid back the president with public 
praise for his leadership in the war against terrorism 
and a refusal to meet with Bush\'s rival, Democratic 
front-runner John Kerry.  Bush paid Sharon back with an 
almost transparent call on Likud rank and file to vote 
in favor of the plan.  The Palestinians -- who weren\'t 
invited to the party -- will pay the price of the 
strengthened friendship between Bush and Sharon. 
Sharon heard the harsh reactions of the Palestinians as 
proof of Sharon\'s argument that the disengagement is a 
blow to the Palestinians and good for Israel.  But just 
because Bush and Sharon have written a new script for 
the Palestinians doesn\'t mean they will follow it.\" 
 
VI.  \"Loves a Lot, Gives a Little\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the editorial of Yediot Aharonot 
(April 15): \"Bush justly referred to Sharon\'s decision 
to withdraw as a \'historic decision\'; indeed it is 
historic, and a majority of the Israeli people supports 
it.  As to the national-diplomatic achievement of 
Sharon\'s visit to Bush, things are far more equivocal. 
First of all, Bush of the spring of 2004 is not Bush of 
the spring of 2003... Bush\'s statements have a hollow 
ring to them.  To what extent did Bush accede to 
Sharon\'s requests?  Taking a superficial view, the 
Israeli prime minister received everything he wanted. 
A closer look finds that this \'everything\' is merely a 
small addition to the traditional American 
positions.... Some people have compared Bush\'s 
statement to the Balfour Declaration.  That is a 
perverse comparison.  Israel today is not in the 
situation of the Zionist movement in 1917.  Eighty- 
seven years ago the Jewish people did not have a state; 
it lived in foreign countries and needed the graces of 
the great powers for everything it wanted, and 
particularly for the realization of its national 
aspirations.... And another difference: President Bush 
today does not have an imperial mandate over the Land 
of Israel and Palestine, and cannot divide its land. 
At the very most he can make his suggestions and hope 
that they are accepted.... [Nonetheless], Sharon 
sponsored a significant political initiative and reaped 
significant public relations fruits.  The Palestinians, 
as usual, did not have the sense to offer anything but 
more terror and, therefore, lost.\" 
 
VII.  \"Forward to Square One\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(April 15): \"It is a measure of how far Israel\'s 
diplomatic position has fallen that yesterday\'s 
exchange of letters between George W. Bush and Ariel 
Sharon should be considered a signal victory.... What 
Sharon and Bush have done is to return to pre-Camp 
David assumptions, thereby partly undoing the 
diplomatic damage wrought by the Barak-Clinton run at a 
final-status agreement and the terror offensive that 
followed.  The Bush statement that the U.S. \'expects\' 
that Israel will retain \'already existing major Israeli 
population centers\' in a final-status agreement is 
significant, but not as significant as it may seem. 
The other shoe has yet to fall on this issue, as 
nothing was said to rule out another invention of the 
Barak/Clinton era -- land swaps.... It is clear now 
that Israel must go through with Sharon\'s disengagement 
plan, as painful as it will be to implement. In a way, 
the plan is another terrible gamble, this time on the 
word of the United States that it will continue to 
condition Palestinian statehood on an end to terror and 
the establishment of a truly free and peaceful 
Palestinian society.... At yesterday\'s summit, 
President Bush once again came through for Israel at a 
crucial hour. What remains to be seen is whether his 
State Department will come through on the follow-up.\" 
 
VIII.  \"The Voice Belongs to Bush, the Hands are that 
of the Geneva Agreement\" 
 
Columnist Haggai Huberman wrote in nationalist, 
Orthodox Hatzofe (April 15): \"Bush eventually did not 
say anything new and did not change anything in the 
traditional policy his country has maintained from 5727 
[i.e. 1967] up to this very day.  He only allowed 
commentators to pump their wares so as to facilitate 
the brainwashing of the registered Likud members prior 
to the referendum.  Every other analysis is correct to 
the very same degree.... One need not be overly 
impressed with Bush\'s statement that the disengagement 
plan is an historic and courageous action that might 
bring progress and end one of the longest conflicts in 
human history.  For 36 years the United States has 
advocated an Israeli withdrawal from Judea, Samaria and 
Gaza [the territories].  Contrary to Sharon\'s request, 
Bush made no real commitment Wednesday about the final 
status arrangement.\"

and (d). 
 
This message has been cleared by ConGen Jerusalem. 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  A day after PM Sharon reiterated his 
commitment to removing unauthorized outposts in Washington, 
outpost activists and supporters woke up on April 15 to the 
news that the GOI had removed a few more sites overnight and 
that the Attorney General ordered some settlement funding 
halted.  In the early morning hours, Israeli border police, 
backed by the IDF, removed two unoccupied outposts, Havat 
Shaqed and Givat Hapiryon.  Later that morning, the Israeli 
AG, Meni Mazuz, ordered the Ministry of Construction and 
Housing to cease all settlement funding until a supervisory 
mechanism is put in place to prevent monies from being 
transferred to outposts.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
AG ORDERS FUNDING FOR SETTLEMENTS STOPPED 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Reacting to the contents of a not yet publicly 
released Israeli Comptrollers report, AG Meni Mazuz ordered, 
on April 15, the Ministry of Construction and Housing (MCH) 
to cease all funding to Israeli settlements in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip.  Mazuz\'s order was reportedly in response to 
the upcoming Comptrollers Report, which, according to Peace 
Now General Secretary Yariv Oppenheimer (who claims he was 
leaked the report\'s relevant contents), contains a section on 
the improper flow of money through government ministries to 
unauthorized outposts.  The order received by the MCH also 
reportedly contains a warning to Israeli bureaucrats that the 
misappropriation of funds to support unauthorized activities, 
such as outposts, is a prosecutable offense.  According to 
the press, funding to settlements will be restored once the 
ministry implements a monitoring mechanism, approved by the 
AG\'s office, that prevents unlawful disbursements to outposts. 
 
3.  (C) Oppenheimer was pleased by the AG\'s action and called 
attention to what he termed the exasperation reflected in the 
order.  Oppenheimer pointed out that the AG did not tell the 
MCH \"to shut down this or that program\" that was benefiting 
outposts, but instead ordered the stoppage of all funds to 
settlements.  Oppenheimer opined that the opaque nature of 
settlement and outpost funding forced the AG to use a hammer 
instead of a scalpel.  Oppenheimer claims the Comptroller\'s 
findings implicate more government ministries than just the 
MCH, but that the MCH\'s activities were the most apparent. 
In fact, according to the press, the AG sent a copy of the 
order to the other ministries warning them to implement 
similar monitoring mechanisms within their own structures to 
protect themselves from prosecution.  Oppenheimer hopes that 
the AG\'s action today is the start of greater government 
accountability on settlement spending, but cautioned that \"we 
should wait and see.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Two Outposts Removed, Fight For Two Other Sites Continues 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
4.  (C) The two outposts removed by the Israeli border 
police, Havat Shaqed and Givat Hapiryon, were originally 
ordered removed in December 2003, but court challenges by 
settlers prohibited the GOI from taking action at that time. 
The Israeli High Court of Justice\'s ruling on March 22 (see 
reftels) rejected the settler\'s appeal and permitted the GOI 
to undertake removal.  An IDF official confirmed to Embassy 
DAO that the two outposts were removed in the early morning 
hours of April 15.  Havat Shaqed was a small, unoccupied 
outpost located south of the settlement of Yizhar, comprised 
of a small makeshift structure.  Givat Hapiryon (Hill of 
Productivity) is probably what USG settlement experts refer 
to as Havat Maon (Tel Tavani), whose removal was authorized 
by the March 22 decision.  The Border Police removed three 
containers and two bus \"skeletons\" from the site.  During the 
removals the police arrested seven settlers who hurled stones 
and scuffled with the officers attempting to remove the 
outpost.  One officer was reported to be lightly injured. 
 
5. (U) Settlers succeeded on April 14, yet again, in 
re-establishing two outposts near Hebron, Hazon David and 
Giborim.  The IDF evacuated Hazon David the first time on 
March 31 after the Israeli High Court rejected the settlers\' 
last possible legal appeal (reftel).  According to Israeli 
press reports and conversations with a settler activist on 
April 14, the settlers reestablished the site.   \"The outpost 
is still there, and we are now making a new one, which will 
be Western Hazon David,\" Shimon Riklin, a veteran of the 
illegal outpost movement, told PolOff April 14.  \"In fact,\" 
joked Riklin, \"there will be three Hazon Davids: the old one, 
the new one, and the army!\"  (Note: Riklin meant that the 
army will have to maintain a presence near the site if it 
wants to prevent outpost expansion in the area.  End note.) 
On the morning of April 15, the IDF and Border Police 
returned to dismantle the two outposts and were met by 
significant resistance from outpost supporters. 
 
6. (C)  Settlers and soldiers clashed at the site on April 13 
as well, according to a report in the Israeli daily Ha\'aretz. 
 The newspaper reported that hundreds of soldiers and 
policemen had arrived at the spot after suspending operations 
in the area over the Passover holiday.  The army closed off 
the entire area, which prevented the Palestinians who own the 
land on which the outpost sits from getting to their 
property, according to Ha\'aretz.  (Note:  The IDF has removed 
the outpost eight times since March 31, according to the 
press, but the settlers continue to rebuild the site.  The 
Hebron settlers are known for their resolve on outposts. 
They have rebuilt the Giborim outpost between Hebron and 
Kiryat Arba over 15 times.  End note.)

SUBJECT: ISRAELI-ARAB NGO LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
CONTROVERSIAL CITIZENSHIP LAW 
 
REF: 03 TEL AVIV 4444 
 
1. Summary: An Israeli-Arab advocacy NGO appealed to the 
diplomatic community at an April 13 gathering to lobby the 
GOI against renewal of the controversial July 2003 law that 
bars Palestinians from the Occupied Territories from 
acquiring Israeli residency or citizenship rights through 
marriage to Israelis.  The law, which was passed on an 
emergency basis for one year\'s duration, is up for Knesset 
renewal in July.  According to the NGO, the law has adversely 
affected some 21,000 couples, mainly composed of Israeli 
Arabs and Palestinians.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Supreme Court Decision Still Pending 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  On April 13, the Mossawa Advocacy Center for Arab 
Citizens of Israel held a briefing for the diplomatic 
community on its campaign against renewal of Israel\'s 
temporary Nationality and Entry into Israel Law (Citizenship 
and Family Unification Law) and appealed for greater domestic 
and international advocacy against renewal of the law in 
July.  The law prevents only Palestinian residents of the 
West Bank and Gaza from obtaining Israeli residency or 
citizenship through marriage to Israeli citizens.  The law 
excludes \"residents of Israeli communities\" in the West Bank 
and Gaza, and does not pertain to other foreign spouses of 
Israeli citizens.  The practical effect of the law, according 
to Israeli NGO documentation, has been the separation of 
thousands of Israeli-Arab citizens from their Palestinian 
spouses.  Several NGOs as well as Knesset members have filed 
petitions with the Supreme Court challenging the law.  After 
several hearings, including before an enlarged panel of 13 
justices, the Supreme Court has not yet reached a decision. 
Jafar Farah, Director of Mossawa, predicted the Supreme Court 
would issue a decision in July, presumably before the law is 
re-enacted.  Farah anticipates that the Knesset will 
introduce legislation to renew the law in June. 
 
3.  The justification for the law, as discussed in the 
Knesset one year ago, was some 20 cases of Palestinians from 
the West Bank or Gaza married to Israeli Arabs who had 
allegedly been involved in terrorist activities.  Adalah, an 
Israeli-Arab legal advocacy NGO, argued in its petition that 
the GOI\'s security concerns \"cannot justify such sweeping 
measures\" and that the law is \"completely disproportionate.\" 
 Adalah argues that the law violates Israel\'s Basic Law 
protecting dignity of the person and is racist in nature. 
Farah pointed out that Amnesty International, Human Rights 
Watch, UNESCO, and the European Commission had all expressed 
concern about the law. 
 
------------------------ 
Families Caught in Limbo 
------------------------ 
 
4.  Mossawa invited to the diplomatic briefing several 
Israeli Arabs adversely affected by the law to discuss their 
cases.  An Israeli Arab from Kafr Qassem noted the 
difficulties he faces being separated from his Palestinian 
wife of five years who must live in her West Bank town of 
Qalqilya with their child, including sometimes having to wait 
hours at checkpoints to visit her.  An Israel-Arab woman from 
the Galilee whose husband lives in Jenin claimed that the GOI 
had denied her a passport and social benefits because she is 
married to a Palestinian.  Another Israeli Arab complained 
about the financial difficulties he faces supporting his wife 
of eight years who is living illegally with him and their 
three children since she cannot receive medical insurance. 
According to Farah, several families who have been separated 
as a result of this law are applying for asylum in countries 
such as Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands. 
 
-------------------------- 
Mossawa Announces Campaign 
-------------------------- 
 
5.  Farah used the gathering to announce Mossawa\'s domestic 
and international lobbying campaign against renewal of the 
law.  Farah said that Mossawa is encouraging Israeli citizens 
to contact the Interior Ministry to express their opposition 
to the law.  He said that Mossawa would also be asking 
affected family members to come forward and publicize their 
cases.  One Mossawa representative also noted that Mossawa 
has written a letter to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee in which it criticizes the law and requests that 
the committee express its concern about the law to the GOI. 
Farah commented that while the U.S. Human Rights Report 
discussed the controversial law, it was important that USG 
raise concerns about the law directly with the GOI.

 (d). 
 
1.  (C) PM Sharon\'s son and Likud MK, Omri Sharon, told 
poloff on April 14 -- before the PM\'s White House meeting -- 
that the main problem facing the pro-disengagement campaign 
is getting enough Likud members out to vote in the May 2 
Likud referendum on the unilateral withdrawal plan.  Sharon 
worries that those opposed to the plan will be more motivated 
to vote than the plan\'s supporters.  When asked about 
specific tactics to motivate supporters to vote, Sharon could 
only stress that it would take hard work, including getting 
out and talking to Likud members.  He also noted that Defense 
Minister Shaul Mofaz would be leading the campaign to instill 
confidence among Likud voters that the disengagement plan 
would not compromise Israel\'s security (reftel).  While he 
would not speculate whether the plan would receive a majority 
of Likud support, Omri Sharon seemed confident that with 
enough hard work at convincing the rank-and-file to vote for 
the plan, the pro-disengagement campaign would be successful. 
 Sharon did not hide his high hopes for what assurances 
President Bush would provide his father later that day.  He 
asserted that Likud members\' support for disengagement would 
hinge in part on the support the PM\'s plan would receive from 
President Bush.  Sharon predicted that if the plan receives a 
majority in the referendum, most Likud ministers will decide 
to support it. 
 
2.  (C) Omri Sharon belittled the significance of the 
so-called \"Greek Island Affair,\" stressing that \"there is 
absolutely nothing to it,\" and dismissed any prospect that AG 
Menachem Mazuz would recommend PM Sharon be indicted on 
related bribery charges.

All media, except Jerusalem Post, led with the 
consequences of PM Sharon\'s meeting with President Bush 
Wednesday.  Israel Radio reported that Sharon returned 
from Washington this morning (Israel Time).  Israel 
Radio quoted senior GOI sources as saying that Sharon 
could visit the U.S. again in a few weeks.  The station 
reported that the Israeli Embassy in Washington will 
invite Sen. John Kerry to Israel, following Sharon\'s 
inability to meet with him in the U.S. due to a tight 
schedule. 
 
Ha\'aretz\'s and Jerusalem Post\'s Washington 
correspondents write that Thursday the U.S. 
Administration tried to soften the pro-Israeli tone of 
Bush\'s statement and dampen the impression that U.S. 
policy has tilted in favor of Israel.  Ha\'aretz\'s 
Washington correspondent cited the belief of the Sharon 
and Bush teams that the shock waves which will convulse 
the PA leadership as a result of Bush\'s letter will 
foster a new leadership among Palestinians.  Israel 
Radio quoted Secretary of State Colin Powell as saying 
Thursday [in interviews with foreign news outlets] that 
the U.S. does not want to prejudice the outcome of 
final status negotiations, and that modifications to 
the 1949 armistice lines have to be mutually agreed 
upon by the two parties as part of the road map 
process.  The Secretary noted that Bush has recognized 
the reality of changes that have taken place in the 
West Bank.  The radio quoted State Department Spokesman 
Richard Boucher as saying: \"There is no change in U.S. 
policy on settlements.\"  The radio and Yediot cited the 
New York Times and Washington Post\'s editorials tht 
expressed reservations about the switch in the U.S. 
stance.  Israel Radio noted that the major U.S. media 
are not buying U.S. \"adjustments\" to Bush\'s remarks or 
to his letter to Sharon. 
 
Yediot, Maariv and Ha\'aretz published the full text of 
the \"disengagement document\" that will be presented to 
Likud members before the upcoming party referendum, 
slated for May 2.  Yediot also printed senior Sharon 
aide Dov Weisglass\' letter to National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice, which details Israel\'s position 
regarding Sharon\'s plan. 
 
Both Yediot and Maariv commissioned polls among Likud 
registered voters: 
-The Yediot poll, conducted by Mina Zemach\'s Dahaf 
Institute found that 54 percent of Likud voters will 
vote for Sharon\'s plan; 38 percent are opposed; 8 
percent are undecided.  (Another Mina Zemach poll found 
that 68 percent of the general public support the plan, 
while 26 percent are opposed to it.) 
- The Maariv/Teleseker poll found that 49.4 percent of 
Likud registered voters favor Sharon\'s plan; 38.4 
percent are opposed to it; 12.2 percent are undecided. 
Among those who declared they will definitely vote on 
May 2, 51.6 percent will support Sharon\'s plan; 40.3 
percent will vote against it; 8.1 percent are 
undecided. 
 
Yediot reported that Sharon promised in a closed 
meeting with senior members of the U.S. media that the 
disengagement from Gaza was only a first step and that 
settlements in the West Bank will also be dismantled. 
Israel Radio quoted a senior member in Sharon\'s 
entourage as saying that Israel is interested in 
transferring property it will abandon in the Gaza Strip 
to responsible PA elements, and that Israel will 
negotiate the issue with international bodies such as 
the World Bank and the countries contributing to the 
PA, but that Israel would pull down those buildings, 
should the consequences of the move be inconsistent 
with Israel\'s interests.  The radio quoted another 
member of Sharon\'s delegation as saying that after the 
withdrawal from Gaza is completed -- in late April 2005 
-- there will be no further withdrawal except from the 
\"Philadelphi axis\" along the northern part of the 
Israel/Egypt border (in the second phase of Israel\'s 
disengagement). 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Sharon\'s son, Knesset Member 
Omri Sharon, canvassed Likud members during his 
father\'s trip to the U.S., warning them that if the 
disengagement plan is not approved in the referendum, 
PM Sharon might resign and the Likud could lose its 
hefty share of its 40 Knesset seats in the next 
national elections.  Yediot quoted associates of 
Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu as saying that he 
is waiting for clarifications from Sharon, but that he 
is presently inclined to vote against the plan.  Yediot 
reported that former cabinet minister Benny Begin (the 
son of the late PM Menachem Begin) has broken a five- 
year-long political silence and that he is joining the 
fight against the withdrawal plan.  Maariv reported 
that Sharon associates and the Labor Party have agreed 
that should the right-wing parties leave the coalition, 
Labor would provide a \"safety net\" to the government. 
Maariv writes that Labor\'s joining the government would 
depend on whether Sharon is indicted on criminal 
charges for alleged corruption. 
 
Leading media reported that in response to the exchange 
of letters between Bush and Sharon, PA Chairman Yasser 
Arafat Thursday reiterated Palestinian commitment to 
the establishment of a state whose capital is 
Jerusalem, and to the right of return for refugees to 
their original places of residence.  Taisir Nasrallah, 
one the signatories of a statement issued Thursday by 
the Committee for the Defense of the Rights of 
Palestinian Refugees, an umbrella organization 
representing refugees from the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip, told Ha\'aretz Thursday that Bush\'s decision 
constitutes another Nakba (catastrophe) for the 
Palestinians. The group\'s statement compares Bush\'s 
letter with the \"unrealistic\" attitude exhibited by the 
signers of the Geneva Accord, the Ami Ayalon-Sari 
Nusseibeh peace initiative and the polling institute 
headed by Khalil Shikaki, which a year ago released a 
poll saying a large percentage of refugees do not 
believe that they will ever return to Israeli 
territory. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Thursday at a press 
conference with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, 
British PM Tony Blair stated that he attaches great 
importance to Sharon\'s disengagement plan, and that he 
calmed those who fear that it could damage the road 
map.   Ha\'aretz quoted French President Jacques Chirac 
as saying that the plan is \"dangerous\" and that it 
constitutes a \"dangerous precedent,\" as it results in a 
change in political borders, which the EU is opposed 
to. 
 
Maariv reported that in the next few weeks the security 
forces will dismantle 28 illegal settler outposts in 
the West Bank, which are inhabited by a total of 240 
families.  The media reported that two outposts were 
dismantled Thursday.  All media reported that Thursday 
A-G Menachem Mazuz ordered the Housing and Construction 
Ministry to freeze all allocations to local councils in 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  The order came in 
response to the yet to be published State Comptroller\'s 
report which indicates that the ministry gave tens of 
millions of shekels (one shekel roughly equals USD 
0.22) to support illegal settlement activity.  All 
media reported that Meretz MK Haim Oron welcomed the 
ministry\'s decision, whereas right-wing politicians 
condemned it as a political decision. 
 
All media reported that Thursday, near Ariel in the 
West Bank, IDF troops arrested a Palestinian woman 
carrying a 25-kg explosive device.  The woman is a 
mother of six.  Jerusalem Post and other media reported 
that Thursday 35 Palestinians were wounded in clashes 
with security forces during protests against the 
construction of the separation fence at Biddu village, 
northwest of Jerusalem. 
 
Ha\'aretz announced that David Landau has become its 
Editor-in-Chief.  Tami Litani has been named the 
newspaper\'s Deputy Editor, replacing Yoel Esteron. 
Taking over from Landau, South-African born Peter 
Hirschberg was appointed Editor of the newspaper\'s 
English Edition.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
I.  \"And Now, the Real Test\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 16): \"Sharon 
agreed to forgo low-value assets -- the settlements in 
the Gaza Strip and in northern Samaria [the Jenin area] 
-- in order to buy time and repulse pressures for a 
deeper withdrawal.  Seizing the diplomatic initiative 
and shaking past positions were the key to achieving an 
understanding with Bush, and served Sharon better than 
his earlier insistence on maintaining the status quo 
until the Palestinians change and start fighting 
terrorism.  He proves that he has the ability to lead 
the entire political system in his wake and to 
undermine the Palestinian contention that even if they 
behave well, Israel will never cede a millimeter. 
Sharon is trying to refute the allegation that his plan 
rewards terrorism and constitutes withdrawal under fire 
by asserting that the Palestinians have suffered a 
harsh blow to their dreams, citing the sharp reactions 
of the Palestinian Authority to the plan to prove his 
point.  He is also delivering numerous threats about 
tougher Israeli responses than in the past if the Gaza- 
based terrorism continues.\" 
 
II.  \"A Palestinian Authority That May Be Passe\" 
 
Arab affairs commentator Danny Rubinstein wrote in 
Ha\'aretz (April 16): \"The Palestinian Authority\'s 
official responses to the \'dangerous turn\' in American 
policy -- calls for help from all elements involved in 
the conflict, first and foremost the UN, Russia, and 
the European countries, America\'s partners in the 
Quartet, as well as the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference and the Arab states -- reveal helplessness. 
PA Chairman Yasser Arafat\'s speech Thursday afternoon, 
in which he stated that the Palestinian people will 
never give up their national rights was also part of 
the response.... It was clear to the Palestinian 
leadership Thursday that Bush\'s support of Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan was the death knell for the road 
map.\" 
 
 
III.  \"Creating a Bantustan in Gaza\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar opined in Ha\'aretz 
(April 16): \"South Africa will be very interested in 
the Israeli disengagement plan published Thursday.  The 
political, military, and economic aspects of the plan 
for the Gaza Strip and the enclave in the northern West 
Bank are amazingly similar to the homelands, one of the 
last inventions of the white minority in South Africa 
to perpetuate its rule over the black majority.... Only 
Israel and Taiwan had diplomatic connections with the 
homelands.  Foment there deteriorated into a series of 
rebellions, and a decade ago the homelands became part 
of united South Africa, governed by a black majority.\" 
 
IV.  \"So What Did We Get?\" 
 
Extreme right-wing columnist Caroline B. Glick wrote on 
page one of conservative, independent Jerusalem Post 
(April 16): \"Bush\'s letter, and indeed, Sharon\'s, 
continue to force Israel into an untenable position of 
having to fight terrorism while promising victory to 
the terrorists in the form of a state.... 
[Furthermore], Israel has exposed and the U.S. has 
reviewed mountains of evidence proving that [the PA] 
security services are terrorist cells and that the 
Palestinian Authority itself is a terrorist entity. 
Yet in spite of this, the U.S. continues to insist, and 
Israel continues to agree, that these security services 
should be reformed and strengthened and PA institutions 
supported and reinforced rather than destroyed and 
replaced.  Finally, as has been the case since the 
\'land for peace\' equation was coined, the demands on 
Israel from the exchange of letters are all concrete 
while the demands from the Palestinians are not.  They 
have to reform and fight terror but there is no \'or 
else.\'  Nothing will happen to them if they don\'t.  And 
as for the reform of their political institutions, 
there is no blueprint for how they are supposed to go 
about it, especially in light of the fact that the Bush 
administration has ruled out the option of getting rid 
of Yasser Arafat.\" 
 
V.  \"The White House Meetings: Lights and Shadows\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (April 16): 
\"The friendly remarks [Bush] made during his 
conversation with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon won\'t 
constitute a hindrance to him when he talks with Arab 
chiefs of state, given that in fact, apart from his 
\'warm remarks,\' President Bush has not committed 
himself to anything concrete regarding Israel.  On the 
contrary, Prime Minister Sharon, the man who pledged to 
implement the \'road map,\' even without amendments, has 
agreed to leave the issue of Jerusalem open for a 
debate on the final status, and to be happy with a 
presidential statement about the return of refugees to 
a future Palestinian state, adding \'it seems clear.\' 
Sharon pledged to \'limit the settlements\'.... This is 
the achievement of the Prime Minister\'s visit to 
Washington.\" 
VI.  \"Stage Six\" 
Jerusalem Post editorialized (April 16): \"According to 
people who study such things, there are eight stages of 
genocide: Classification, Symbolization, 
Dehumanization, Organization, Polarization, 
Preparation, Extermination and Denial.  After a decade 
of Arafatian rule, a critical mass of Palestinians 
hover somewhere between stages six and seven.  This 
development, obvious to most Israelis, is rarely 
noticed by outside observers.... Most students of 
genocide would agree that when prominent or popular 
leaders of one nation call repeatedly and openly for 
the extinction of another nation, it\'s best to take 
them at their word.... We make these observations just 
as President Bush, in his press conference with Ariel 
Sharon, has repeated his call for a new Palestinian 
regime, devoted not only to fighting terrorism but 
[also] to focusing its efforts on the socio-economic 
welfare of the Palestinian people.  When Bush first 
made this case, in June 2002, it was widely dismissed 
as unrealistic and probably counterproductive.  To our 
mind, it remains essential. No \'peace\' is worth the 
paper it\'s written on if it collapses at the first hint 
of weakness.\"

1.  (C) Polls conducted after the April 14 meeting between 
President Bush and PM Sharon show Sharon\'s disengagement plan 
winning a majority of Likud voter support.  Major media 
analysts, however, noted that intervening events -- such as a 
significant terrorist attack or FinMin Benyamin Netanyahu\'s 
public opposition to the plan -- could threaten the plan\'s 
approval in the planned May 2 Likud referendum on the issue. 
Likud campaigns for and against the plan are underway, with 
PM Sharon\'s son, Omri, threatening fellow Likud politicians 
on April 15 that the PM may resign if the referendum fails to 
back the plan.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Polls Show Clear Majority for Plan 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) According to three media polls conducted on April 15, 
PM Sharon\'s unilateral disengagement plan, the contents of 
which has appeared in the April 16 press, enjoys the support 
of a majority of Likud\'s some 200,000 registered members: 
 
-- Private poll broadcast by IDF radio: 57.5 percent of Likud 
voters support the plan, 37.5 percent oppose it and 5 percent 
are undecided. 
 
-- Yedioth Ahronoth poll: 54 percent of Likud voters support 
the plan, 32 percent are opposed and 14 percent are undecided. 
 
-- Ma\'ariv poll: 49.4 percent of Likud voters support the 
plan, 38.4 percent are against and 12.2 percent are undecided. 
 
3.  (C) While the polls indicate a comfortable majority for 
the plan, Uri Rosen, writing for Ma\'ariv on April 16, 
cautioned that \"almost any unexpected event, ranging from a 
public statement by Netanyahu against the plan to a terror 
attack staged especially on the day of the vote could change 
the picture.\"  Rosen, however, discounted the assertion by 
some observers that disengagement opponents are more likely 
to actually vote than supporters of the plan.  According to 
Rosen, a Ma\'ariv examination of poll results indicates that 
\"contrary to the arguments raised by Netanyahu\'s people over 
the past few days, (note: -- and contrary to what Omri Sharon 
asserted to poloff on April 14 per ref A) the supporters of 
the disengagement plan (will) vote at nearly the same level 
of participation as the plan\'s opponents....\"  Rosen also 
noted that it may take some time before the positive effect 
of the Bush-Sharon meeting \"trickles down to public opinion\" 
causing a possible \"soar\" in support. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Bibi and Omri Playing All the Cards 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) Yedioth Ahronoth reported on April 16 that \"close 
associates\" of FinMin Netanyahu indicated the Finance 
Minister would oppose the plan \"unless he gets a satisfactory 
answer to the central question of the separation fence and 
whether the settlement blocs will be inside the fence.\" 
Netanyahu reportedly told Sharon in a telephone conversation 
while the PM was in Washington that the withdrawal plan 
should not be implemented until the fence is complete. 
Yedioth reported that \"sources in Sharon\'s bureau admitted\" 
that if Netanyahu uses \"all his political clout\" against the 
plan, Sharon may find it \"difficult to pass the plan in the 
referendum and the Cabinet.\" 
 
5. (C) Sharon has already spoken with other Likud ministers 
and political leaders (ref B) about the plan and intends to 
meet with ministers, most likely on Sunday, April 18.  Two 
key ministers, Limor Livnat and Silvan Shalom, have said that 
they will take a position on the plan after they learn more 
about it directly from the PM.  Sharon is widely believed to 
have already lined up Labor to take the place of the National 
Union coalition partner if the cabinet approves the plan. 
(Note: National Union Chairman Avigdor Lieberman announced on 
April 16 that his party would leave the coalition \"as soon as 
the plan is approved.\")  The Knesset, now in recess, has 
scheduled an extraordinary session on April 22 to learn 
directly from the PM about his plan.  Shinui MK Ehud Rassabi 
told poloff on April 15 that he was confident Sharon\'s plan 
would get through the referendum and asserted that Netanyahu 
would \"definitely support the plan.\" 
 
6. (C) Likud MK Omri Sharon, who has joined with Defense 
Minister Shaul Mofaz (ref A) and other Likud members to 
campaign for the plan, has, according to Ha\'aretz, been 
meeting with local Likud branch heads warning them that the 
prime minister would resign if the disengagement plan is not 
approved in the referendum and alluding to the loss of 
Likud\'s 40 Knesset seats and new elections if his father 
resigns.

Key stories in the media:

All media reported on Holocaust Memorial Day events, 
which started last night and will continue through 
tonight. 
 
Sunday, all media led with the assassination of Hamas 
leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi in an IAF helicopter strike 
Saturday evening.  Shortly after the assassination, 
Khaled Mashal, the head of the movement\'s political 
bureau, who operates from Damascus, announced that the 
identity of the new Hamas leader in Gaza would not be 
disclosed.  Today, Ha\'aretz reported that Israel will 
consider attacking Hamas\'s compound in Damascus should 
the organization move its main power base to Syria. 
The media pitted strong responses to the killing around 
the world against mild responses in the U.S. 
 
Leading media quoted National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice as saying in an interview on the Fox 
network that the U.S. did not have advance information 
about Israel\'s intention to kill Rantisi.  Rice called 
on Israel to \"consider the implications of the actions 
it carries out,\" but she stressed that Israel has a 
right to defend itself, and that Hamas is a terror 
organization.  The media also quoted Democratic 
presidential contender Sen. John Kerry as saying on 
NBC: \"I believe that Israel has every right to respond 
to terror threats against it.\"  Kerry also said that he 
supports Sharon\'s disengagement plan, and that if 
elected he will appoint a high-level Middle East 
mediator acceptable to the international community and 
Israel.  Israel Radio reported that the Islamic 
Movement in Israel intends to demonstrate this week 
opposite the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. 
 
All media reported that Sunday PM Sharon won a cabinet 
majority for his disengagement plan, when Finance 
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Education Minister Limor 
Livnat, and Minister-without-Portfolio Meir Sheetrit 
decided to back it.  Netanyahu was quoted as saying in 
an interview with Yediot that he \"obtained the maximum 
for the settlers.\"  FM Silvan Shalom is still 
undecided.  The media quoted Sharon as saying at the 
cabinet meeting: \"The U.S. believes that settlement 
blocs will remain in Israel\'s hands in any case and 
that will be outside future negotiations with the 
Palestinians.\"  Yediot sums up seven achievements 
reached by Sharon during his visit to the U.S., which 
he detailed at the cabinet meeting: the U.S. pledged 
not to adopt another plan than the road map; there will 
be no diplomatic negotiations before terrorism ends, 
terrorist groups are dismantled and comprehensive 
reforms are made [in the PA]; the U.S. recognizes 
Israel\'s need for defensible borders, and accepts 
Israel\'s right to defend itself everywhere --including 
in areas it has evacuated and will evacuate; there will 
be no return of refugees to Israel; there will be no 
return to the 1967 borders, because the settlement 
blocs will remain in Israel\'s hands, and because of 
Israel\'s right to defensible borders; not only will 
settlement blocs remain in Israel\'s hands, but also 
Israel will be able to build in them in a scope to be 
jointly determined with the U.S.; and the security 
fence will be built along the complete  route that was 
decided upon by the government, including the erection 
of a continuous fence around the settlement blocs.  The 
government will complete the fence before the beginning 
of the evacuation of settlements.  Jerusalem Post 
reported that Sharon told his cabinet Sunday that an 
Israeli team will meet in the next few days with U.S. 
Ambassador Dan Kurtzer to define where construction 
will be allowed in the settlements. 
 
Sunday, leading media quoted British PM Tony Blair as 
saying in an interview with BBC Radio from Washington 
Saturday that Israel\'s plan to withdraw from Gaza and 
part of the West Bank will reinvigorate rather than 
destroy the road map.  There were contradictory media 
reports regarding the EU\'s position in the matter. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted a PA source as saying that 
Palestinian FM Nabil Shaath canceled his trip to the 
U.S., which was planned for next month, because the PA 
wants to reconsider its acceptance of Sharon\'s Gaza 
withdrawal plan and its relations with the U.S. 
Administration. 
 
Yediot and Maariv excerpted an interview with nuclear 
whistleblower Mordecai Vanunu, who will be released 
Wednesday.  In the interview, which was conducted by 
the defense establishment and which will be broadcast 
tonight on Channel 10-TV, Vanunu is alleged to say: 
\"The Dimona nuclear reactor should be destroyed as the 
Iraqi reactor was.\"  He reportedly said he will have a 
computer with access to the Internet and that nobody 
will be able to do anything against him, and that 
\"billions\" of people in the world consider him a hero. 
 
All media reported that Saturday afternoon a border 
policeman was killed and that three other Israelis were 
wounded when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the 
Erez crossing.  The electronic gate did not detect the 
explosive charge.  Ha\'aretz and other media reported 
that a Palestinian youth was killed near Ramallah 
Friday, and that two Palestinians were killed in Gaza 
Sunday.  All media reported on a shooting incident on a 
Galilee road Sunday:  Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio 
reported that border policemen killed an Israeli Arab 
and wounded another.  They had attempted to shoot at 
border police vehicles on a Galilee road. 
 
Sunday, the media reported that Israel\'s embassy in 
Australia has dispatched a diplomat to New Zealand with 
the arrests of two Israelis allegedly trying to obtain 
a fake New Zealand passport.  The media reported on 
allegations in New Zealand that the two men could be 
Mossad agents. 
 
Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that the U.S. State 
Department has suggested in recent days that Syria may 
be able to avoid imposition of fresh U.S. sanctions, 
under the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Restoration 
Act, if it soon shows it has taken some of the steps 
required by the law. 
 
Leading media reported Sunday that two weeks ago Giora 
Eiland, the coordinator of the Gaza withdrawal plan, 
drafted a document criticizing the Geneva Accord for 
being a \"dangerous sleight of hand\" regarding the right 
of return for Palestinian refugees.  The media cited a 
response by the Geneva Accord team, that the 
understandings in the agreement do not include 
recognition or materialization of the right of return. 
 
Leading media reported that, in a groundbreaking move, 
Israir Airlines is to launch direct charter flight 
service between Israel and the U.S. (on the Tel Aviv- 
New-York line), starting in June.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"The Motivation Behind the Missile\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (April 
19): \"Knocking off Hamas leaders is not, in itself, 
policy. If these acts aggravate risks faced by Israel 
and its citizens, they are wrong.  Conversely, if they 
are likely to restrain Hamas and lead it toward the 
route of a cease-fire (which disappeared rapidly last 
summer) and encourage the organization to work out 
practical arrangements with the Palestinian Authority 
prior to the withdrawal of IDF troops and settlements 
from Gaza -- then the assassinations should not be 
ruled out.  An echo of this approach can be heard in 
the White House.... Even if it is possible to identify 
substantive arguments to justify the Rantisi 
assassination, the timing of the act raises skepticism 
about the motives of those who decided to carry it out. 
Sharon was eager to arrive at Sunday\'s cabinet meeting 
-- and to influence whether top Likud ministers who 
have expressed reservations about his disengagement 
plan will join active opponents of the plan or be 
content to issue vacuous statements -- with a military 
success under his belt.\" 
 
II.  \"Justified and Productive\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(April 19): \"Will the British Foreign Minister explain 
why the killing of Uday and Qusay Hussein was justified 
and \'productive,\' but the killing of Abdel Aziz Rantisi 
was not?  All three are, or were, leaders of what the 
British government defines as terrorist 
organizations.... To follow the minister\'s 
pronouncements to their logical conclusion, Israel may 
take no measure in its self-defense except to arrest 
suicide bombers when they reach Israeli soil, which is 
as good as no defense at all.  Alternatively, he 
believes Israel must resume negotiations with the 
Palestinian Authority, notwithstanding the failure of 
the PA to take steps against terrorist organizations 
and the evidence that it is deeply implicated in 
terrorist activity.\" 
 
III.  \"Assassination for Disengagement Purposes\" 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote on page one 
of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (April 
18): \"If any such thing as a \'positive assassination\' 
exists, then Abdel Aziz Rantisi\'s assassination 
warrants that term.  That is because the removal of 
Rantisi from the arena is likely to produce a far more 
substantial change in the performance of Hamas in Gaza 
than the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.  Rantisi 
needed to disappear quickly if only because he threw 
the gates of Gaza wide open to direct Iranian 
influence.... Assassinating leaders on its own serves 
no purpose, unless the weakening of the organization 
they headed is exploited to promote political goals. 
Should the Palestinian Authority rise to the occasion 
and take responsibility in the Gaza Strip as a result 
of Hamas\'s weakened state, should Egypt, Jordan and 
other moderate Arab countries encourage and bolster 
constructive elements in the Gaza Strip to take 
responsibility and to rehabilitate life there after the 
Israeli withdrawal, should Israel rise to the occasion 
to strengthen those elements in the Gaza Strip that 
have the ability to assume responsibility -- then these 
assassinations will prove to have been efficacious. 
Rantisi\'s assassination does not change Hamas\'s desire 
for revenge in the least.\" 
 
IV.  \"Targeted Assassination of the Objection\" 
 
Political commentator Shalom Yerushalmi wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (April 19): \"The serial 
killing of Sheikh Yassin and Rantisi is turning Sharon 
into a national hero within the ranks of the Likud, a 
leader whom one must now join, and not place obstacles 
on his way.... The recent developments are placing the 
Likud opponents of disengagement in a very difficult 
predicament.... Sharon\'s achievements in the U.S., 
Rantisi\'s assassination and the defection of [hard-line 
Likud ministers] Netanyahu and Livnat to the ranks of 
the supporters isolate them and leave them without a 
leader endowed with a stature to continue the 
struggle.\" 
V.  \"A Foreknown Scenario\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the editorial of Yediot Aharonot 
(April 18): \"The Israeli government does not hide 
behind an anonymous hand.  It announces to all and 
sundry that it intends to kill the people who lead, 
initiate and organize the terrorist campaign against 
it.  That is where the strategic novelty lies.  The 
issue of the open and foreknown assassinations raises a 
large number of legal, moral, military and humanitarian 
questions.  Not all of them either can or should be 
answered.  It is true that Israel has enormously 
expanded the definition of the ticking bomb, which it 
used to justify assassinations early on.  With that 
having been said, one thing is clear: it is 
inconceivable that the people who send others to commit 
suicide bombing attacks should be able to sleep soundly 
in their beds.  If there is justification for killing a 
terrorist on his way to commit a terror attack, there 
is far more justification for killing the commander and 
preacher who sent the terrorist on his way.... Israel 
currently stands at the vanguard of the war on terror. 
It has taken the initiative, and the results are 
impressive.  But we should not delude ourselves. 
Dismantling Hamas\'s spinal cord and killing its 
leadership will not erase the burning hatred for Israel 
but rather will intensify it -- at least in the short 
run.  Ultimately, Palestinian society is going to have 
to be the one to root out Hamas from its midst, if it 
ever wants to live as a normal society.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
VI.  \"The Bush Wrapping\" 
 
Ha\'aretz editorialized (April 18): \"As the clouds of 
celebration dissipate from around the White House, it 
becomes clear that Sharon has provided a solid 
commitment to implement practical steps, while Bush 
offered a statement and an atmosphere, \'a sober 
evaluation,\' with no American commitment regarding 
opposition to the Palestinian right of return or 
recognition of the reality of large blocs of settlement 
in the West Bank that will require adjustment through 
exchanges of territory.  This mysterious American 
policy leaves it to the sides to bargain over the final 
agreement.  As expected, in the wake of Arab and 
European criticism of the plan, the U.S. Administration 
peeled off the plan\'s wrapping and went back to 
focusing on its immediate benefit to the Palestinians - 
- withdrawal.  In order not to delay the fulfillment of 
the promises until 2005, or the next prime minister, 
Sharon gave in to the demand to immediately dismantle 
the illegal outposts, under close American supervision. 
Under the conditions that have been created, and in 
spite of the real concern over the chaos that will roil 
in the territories, all in all, the removal of 
settlements is of supreme significance as a precedent. 
For this reason, Sharon\'s plan should be supported, but 
without illusions of any real American guarantees.\" 
 
VII.  \"Bush Enlisting For the Corrupt One\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (April 18): 
\"The President of the U.S. has done something that is a 
bit startling: if the plan he supports doesn\'t win a 
majority, he could find himself in additional trouble 
on the eve of the presidential race.  Is it possible 
that President Bush is interested in strengthening the 
image that U.S. night talk show hosts have nurtured 
regarding his judgment?.... The U.S. President is now 
being swept into helping Sharon.  He could find out 
that this cost him his second term.  It is doubtful 
that as far as Israel is concerned, Kerry is better 
than Bush as president.  But, should that happen, 
Sharon could well succeed in causing more damage to 
Israel.  On the other hand, how important is this?  The 
important thing is that the Sharon family survives the 
corruption investigations.\" 
 
VIII.  \"The Victory of the Hamas Way\" 
 
Arab affairs commentator Danny Rubinstein wrote in 
Ha\'aretz (April 19): \"The Gaza Strip appears ... to be 
heading toward a new regime, which won\'t exactly be a 
continuation of the Palestinian Authority, but rather 
\'an action committee under the auspices of the PA,\' as 
Muhammad Dahlan has suggested.  If in previous years 
there was talk of Hamas joining Arafat\'s regime, it 
appears now in Gaza that the talk is more to do with 
the PA joining Hamas.  In any event, the Hamas way has 
emerged victorious: there is no political process; the 
armed struggle has returned; the fight is against \'the 
Zionist entity\'; and the issue of the right of return 
has once again been brought to the fore.\"

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Nachman Shai, who was the IDF spokesman during the 1991 
Gulf War, wrote in conservative, independent Jerusalem 
Post: \"Israel is rightfully concerned that American 
determination could flag.... An American withdrawal

that would only, in such circumstances, become even

\"Rooting For America\" 
 
Nachman Shai, who was the IDF spokesman during the 1991 
Gulf War, wrote in conservative, independent Jerusalem 
Post (April 18): \"Since the allies occupied Iraq more 
than a year ago, Israel has kept a \'low profile\'.... 
Last week things changed when Defense Minister Shaul 
Mofaz said, \'We are crossing our fingers for the 
Americans... If the U.S. wins in Iraq it will have a 
positive effect on the whole Middle East.  If it is 
forced out due to the pressure of terrorism, it will 
create a new and dangerous model of Arab rule\'.... I 
suggest everyone wait and see.  The U.S. is not stupid, 
and the move it initiated in Iraq was justified and 
correct.... Anyone who opts for a policy of surrender 
and appeasement, as recently exhibited by the new 
Spanish government\'s rush to withdraw its forces from 
Iraq, is only inviting global terror to continue.... 
John Kerry has to be very careful when he criticizes 
matters that lie at the core of the ethos of the 
American nation.  In times of war the Americans rally 
around the flag and postpone their criticism for \'the 
day after.\'  That day has yet to come.  Israel is 
rightfully concerned that American determination could 
flag.... An American withdrawal would leave us alone in 
an already hostile environment that would only, in such 
circumstances, become even more violent and cruel.\"

AL-RANTISI ASSASSINATION 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/C Norm Olsen, per 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
THIS IS A JOINT MESSAGE FROM CONGEN JERUSALEM AND EMBASSY TEL 
AVIV. 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Contacts throughout the Gaza Strip all 
concurred that the April 17 assassination of Hamas leader Abd 
al-Aziz al-Rantisi the March 22 assassination of Shaykh Ahmad 
Yasin and the Bush-Sharon summit were being viewed as a 
cumulative series of actions against the Palestinian people. 
Particularly in the aftermath of the April 15 Bush-Sharon 
meeting in Washington, the perception on the street was that 
United States had given Sharon the \"green light\" to carry out 
the attack.  Palestinians, already furious at the exchange of 
letters between the U.S. and Israel that they interpret as 
evidence that the U.S. has now completely sided with Israel, 
have concluded that Israel does not want peace.  Contacts 
predicted that there would be negative repercussions in 
ongoing talks between Hamas and the PA over their future 
relationship in the Gaza Strip after an Israeli withdrawal. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) In the aftermath of the April 18 assassination of 
Abd al-Aziz al-Rantisi in an IAF missile strike in Gaza City, 
militants\' reactions in Gaza have been swift and heavy. 
According to the IDF, at least 37 mortars and rockets were 
fired at Israeli settlements and IDF outposts throughout the 
Strip since the assassination, and UNRWA has reports that at 
least six rockets were fired into Israel.  The Israeli media 
reported that one settler had been injured, and a total of 14 
Palestinians, including a nine-year-old girl, were wounded in 
Gaza when IDF soldiers returned fire. 
 
3.  (C) The reaction was no less vociferous in the political 
and social realms, with Palestinian outrage at the latest in 
a series of assassinations merging with what contacts 
referred to as the Palestinians\' sense of betrayal following 
PM Sharon\'s meeting last week with President Bush.  A 
journalist sympathetic to Hamas, Ghazi Hamad, told Poloff 
April 18 that the feeling among residents, political and 
apolitical alike, is that Israel will not withdraw from Gaza 
until it has succeeded in \"punishing\" each Palestinian in the 
Strip.  The GOI\'s action affected the entire Palestinian 
situation, he added, not just that in Gaza.  When asked how 
al-Rantisi\'s death would impact ongoing Hamas-PA talks, Hamad 
said, \"Especially after the (Bush-Sharon) summit, there is no 
way now to talk about peaceful compromise.  The language 
between all the factions now is completely different, because 
they (the factions) know that they are each of them a 
target.\"  Israel, he added, will not leave Gaza until it is 
\"clean\" of Hamas.  Hamas members, Hamad predicted, will now 
let nothing stop them. 
 
4.  (C) Jihad al-Wazir, deputy minister of planning in Gaza 
and son of assassinated PLO leader Abu Jihad, told Poloff 
April 19 that al-Rantisi\'s assassination was a direct and 
logical result of the April 15 Bush-Sharon meeting.  That 
meeting, al-Wazir said, demonstrated that the U.S. could not 
say no to Sharon and, as a result, Sharon felt empowered to 
take whatever actions he wished.  \"By giving him (Sharon) 
carte blanche, you have let the bull loose in the china 
shop,\" al-Wazir said.  Al-Wazir, a western-educated, PA 
pragmatist, elaborated, saying that the GOI had carried out 
the assassination of former Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin 
after he had accepted the 1967 borders in the creation of a 
Palestinian state.  Now, al-Wazir continued, Israel has 
killed Yasin\'s successor al-Rantisi just when Hamas was 
sitting together with the PA to work out the terms of their 
post-withdrawal relationship in Gaza.  It is clear to 
everyone, al-Wazir concluded, that Israel is doing this to 
weaken the Palestinian people, not just Hamas.  Furthermore, 
even though al-Rantisi was much more radical than Yasin, none 
of the remaining possible Hamas leaders has as much stature. 
Now, younger and even more radical individuals will move to 
the fore, al-Wazir predicted, and any nascent agreement 
reached with Muhammad Dahlan and the PA in recent days may 
well unravel. 
 
5.  (C) Al-Wazir outlined what he saw as a possible scenario: 
Hamas will do its utmost to carry out a large attack on an 
Israeli target at the earliest opportunity.  Given the likely 
severity of any Hamas attack, and the perceived American 
\"green light,\" the IDF will then respond \"strategically 
rather than tactically\", possibly even targeting Yasir 
Arafat.  While admittedly unsure whether or not Hamas had the 
capacity in the near term to carry out such a catastrophic 
attack against Israel, al-Wazir stressed that all focus is 
now on retaliation. 
 
6.  (C) A prominent Gaza businessman, Ahed Bseiso, wondered 
why Israel had hit al-Rantisi now, when Hamas had not 
retaliated for the strike that killed Shaykh Yasin.  Prior to 
al-Rantisi\'s death, Bseiso said, he had the impression that 
Fatah\'s efforts to restrain Hamas had been working.  Now, 
however, all bets were off.  Palestinians are 100 percent 
convinced that Israel does not want peace, Bseiso concluded, 
adding that Palestinian anger and disappointment with the 
United States was palpable.  Echoing the same sentiment, UNDP 
Deputy Representative Iman al-Wazir told Econoff April 19 
that people were perhaps more upset that Sharon seems to have 
a free hand from the U.S. than at the actions themselves. 
 
7. (SBU) These individual views of the assassination 
reflected harsh official statements that emerged over the 
weekend.  Officials from PA Foreign Minister Nabil Sha\'ath 
down to individual Hamas leaders all alleged U.S. complicity 
in the al-Rantisi assassination, drawing the link between the 
timing of the killing and the recent Bush-Sharon summit in 
Washington.  Hamas, the Fatah-affiliated al-Aqsa Martyrs\' 
Brigades, and other, smaller groups all issued statements 
vowing to retaliate against Israel for the assassination.

DISENGAGEMENT PLAN 
 
REF: FBIS GMP20040419000030 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  PM Sharon has lined up key Likud ministers 
behind his disengagement plan and set the stage for victory 
in the May 2 Likud referendum.  In the process, Sharon 
stretched to their full measure USG assurances regarding 
Israeli retention of West Bank settlement blocs, Israel\'s 
right to defensible borders and freedom to retaliate against 
terrorists, and USG support for Palestinian refugee 
repatriation in a future Palestinian state.  He also 
reportedly delivered the last commitment sought by FinMin 
Netanyahu -- inclusion of major West Bank settlement blocs 
within the completed separation barrier before starting any 
Gaza withdrawal.  Sharon played down the significance of 
meeting Netanyahu\'s conditions for supporting the 
disengagement plan by thanking several Likud ministers for 
their proposals for inclusion in the disengagement plan. 
With the last major Likud holdouts in Sharon\'s pocket -- 
Netanyahu, Education Minister Livnat, Foreign Minister 
Shalom, Minister-without Portfolio Sheetrit, and Immigration 
and Absorption Minister Livni -- the unilateral disengagement 
plan is certain to receive a Likud majority in the party\'s 
May 2 referendum.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Sharon Stretching U.S. Assurances? 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) PM Sharon\'s April 18 depiction to the Cabinet of USG 
assurances on rejection of right of return, support for 
retention of settlement blocs, Israel\'s broad right to defend 
itself, and USG support for these positions in any future 
negotiation with the Palestinians, as confirmed by the 
subsequent official Cabinet Communique (reftel), won the day 
politically for Sharon and for his unilateral disengagement 
plan.  In addition, Sharon reportedly promised Netanyahu that 
the separation barrier would be built according to the 
complete route decided upon by the Cabinet last year, 
including Ariel, Emmanuel, Kedumim and Karnei Shomron, and 
announced the creation of a team including himself, Mofaz, 
and Netanyahu to orchestrate the speedy completion of the 
barrier.  (Note: We are trying to confirm the substance of 
the agreement with Netanyahu to determine if Netanyahu is 
himself stretching what he got from Sharon.)  Sharon will 
only discuss the plan with Cabinet ministers in detail after 
the May 2 Likud referendum.  In an April 18 radio interview, 
Netanyahu explained that he decided to support the plan \"when 
the Prime Minister agreed to promise that we could fence 
(settlement blocs in Judea and Samaria) by means of the 
central fence and include them in the same area as the rest 
of Israel, prior to any evacuation....\" 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Sharon Gives Bibi What he Wants -- Underhandedly 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3.  (C) Staffers for PM Sharon and FinMin Netanyahu 
reportedly negotiated until the early morning of April 18, 
only hours before Sharon\'s presentation of USG assurances to 
the Cabinet, to meet Netanyahu\'s conditions for supporting 
Sharon\'s plan: inclusion of major West Bank settlements 
within the security barrier and the barrier\'s completion 
before Gaza settlement evacuation begins.  (Note: The plan\'s 
inclusion of continued Israeli control over Gaza border 
crossings even after withdrawal and U.S. assurances on 
Palestinian right of return met Netanyahu\'s other two 
conditions.)  At the April 18 Cabinet meeting, Sharon was 
able to deliver those USG assurances and the commitments 
Netanyahu sought with the added muscle of having just hours 
earlier announced the IDF\'s assassination of Hamas leader 
Abdul Aziz Rantisi.  As if to undermine Netanyahu\'s role in 
pushing Sharon or, at the very least, his staff, through 
additional hoops after Sharon\'s U.S. meetings, Sharon did not 
attribute his commitments to an effort to meet Netanyahu\'s 
conditions.  Sharon instead thanked Defense Minister Shaul 
Mofaz for pushing for assurances on Israel\'s right to 
defensible borders, and Immigration Absorption Minister Tzipi 
Livni for her insistence for U.S. assurances that Palestinian 
refugees should have the right of return in a future 
Palestinian state.  Netanyahu won thanks only for making 
comments on the fence. 
 
4.  (C)  Netanyahu, Livnat, and Minister-Without-Portfolio 
Meir Sheetrit all announced their support for the withdrawal 
plan to the press shortly after the Cabinet meeting.  Foreign 
Minister Silvan Shalom held out until April 19 and announced 
his anticipated support for the plan in an afternoon press 
conference which was preceded by a meeting with Sharon. 
Shalom said that he is supporting Sharon\'s plan to \"reinforce 
existing settlements\" and to show \"unity among (the Likud 
party.)\"  MFA Director of International Organizations Roni 
Ya\'ar told DCM on April 19 that Shalom called his senior 
staff together that morning to announce he would support 
Sharon\'s plan even though not all his demands were met, such 
as a Palestinian partner.  Shalom, however, had looked for a 
way to support the plan, Ya\'ar said.  According to Ya\'ar, 
Shalom instructed his staff to craft a \"diplomatic action 
plan\" to gain broader international support after an 
anticipated Cabinet approval of the plan on May 9. 
 
5.  (C) Regarding Netanyahu\'s announcement of support for the 
plan, columnist and International Director of the Israel 
Democracy Institute Uri Dromi noted to poloff on April 19 
that Netanyahu -- and all of the holdout ministers -- cannot 
afford to appear as though they oppose the plan when the 
United States is supporting it.  He asserted that it is 
important for Netanyahu not to \"take on\" Sharon at this time. 
 Rather, Dromi opined, Netanyahu is biding his time, 
preferring to position himself as a statesman and serious 
finance minister, until AG Menachem Mazuz decides on whether 
to indict Sharon on bribery charges.  Likud faction leader MK 
Gidon Sa\'ar told poloff on April 18 that he knew all along 
that Netanyahu would support the plan, because Netanyahu 
could not afford to do otherwise.  He added that he never 
would have believed a year ago that settlement supporters 
like Sharon, Livnat, and Netanyahu would support unilateral 
withdrawal.  Sa\'ar himself, a former Cabinet Secretary for 
Sharon and head of the Likud Knesset faction, opposes the 
plan (but does not vote in the Cabinet). 
 
6.  (C) Peace Now director Yariv Oppenheimer told poloff on 
April 19 that Sharon may have committed himself specifically 
during negotiations with Netanyahu to include the 
aforementioned settlement blocs to obtain his support for the 
disengagement plan before the Likud referendum.  After the 
referendum, Oppenheimer speculated, it would not be difficult 
for Sharon to renege on this agreement with Netanyahu.

Comment

7.  (C) If Sharon did in fact promise Netanyahu that the 
security barrier would go along the route that the Cabinet 
had originally decided last year and which includes the 
settlements cited above, this would conflict with interim 
assurances provided by Sharon to the USG that changes would 
be made to the fence route to ease humanitarian burdens on 
Palestinians.  In any event, Sharon told Netanyahu what he 
needed to in order to secure Netanyahu\'s support and a 
victory in the May 2 referendum.

1.  (C) Summary:  Likud MK Gideon Sa\'ar told poloff on April 
18 that he will quietly oppose PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan 
even though he is certain that the plan will win a majority 
in the May 2 Likud referendum.  Sa\'ar objects to the plan 
since it requires withdrawing from Gaza and four northern 
West Bank settlements without obtaining anything from the 
Palestinians in return.  He fears that implementing the plan 
will be seen by terrorist organizations as their victory and 
will leave Israel without future bargaining chips in 
negotiations.   Sa\'ar said that despite his opposition to the 
plan, he will support it after it wins approval in the 
referendum, and that he hopes Likud can convince right-wing 
coalition partners to remain in the government even after 
Cabinet approval of the plan.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Sa\'ar Goes Against the Tide 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Hours after the April 18 announcements by several key 
Likud ministers that they would support PM Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan (ref A), Likud faction leader and 
first-term MK Gideon Sa\'ar told poloff that \"Sharon has the 
wind on his back\" and predicted a Likud majority will support 
the PM\'s plan in the referendum.  Despite his prediction, 
Sa\'ar told poloff he opposes the plan and will vote against 
it in the May 2 Likud referendum.  Sa\'ar added that he will 
not join any of his fellow Likud colleagues\' campaigns 
against the plan, such as that of Agriculture Minister 
Yisrael Levy or Minister-Without-Portfolio Uzi Landau.  Sa\'ar 
said he recognizes that most Israelis want change and hope 
that disengagement will improve the overall security 
situation.  Once the plan is approved in the Likud 
referendum, Sa\'ar stated firmly that he will then support the 
plan as well. 
 
3.  (C) Sa\'ar stressed that for now, he could not support the 
Prime Minister\'s plan on principle since it requires Israel 
to withdraw from all of Gaza and four West Bank settlements 
without obtaining any quid pro quo from the Palestinians. 
Israel would lose important bargaining chips in any future 
negotiations with the Palestinians, he argued.  \"Israel did 
not make out so well\" in PM Sharon\'s April 14 letter exchange 
with President Bush, Sa\'ar claimed.  In exchange for 
President Bush\'s \"words,\" Sa\'ar emphasized, Israel gave up 
all Gaza settlements, four settlements in the West Bank and, 
according to Sa\'ar, overall settlement growth. 
 
---------------------- 
Victory for Terrorists 
---------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Sa\'ar also opposes unilateral disengagement because 
he believes it sends the wrong signal to Palestinian 
extremists who, he fears, will claim a victory when they see 
Israeli settlers packing up and leaving Gaza.  They will view 
the evacuation of Gaza, says Sa\'ar, as the result of a 
successful terrorist campaign and not as a result of 
bilateral negotiations.  Sa\'ar stressed it would have been 
much more advantageous to move forward with a Gaza withdrawal 
in steps, along with a Palestinian partner, but said there is 
no acceptable Palestinian partner currently.  \"None of the 
moderate (Palestinian leaders) have a chance while Arafat is 
around,\" he said. 
 
------------------------------ 
Holding the Coalition Together 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  Sa\'ar said the threats of the right-wing coalition 
parties -- the National Religious Parties and the National 
Union -- to leave the coalition if the plan is approved by 
the Cabinet (after it receives a majority in the referendum) 
are not yet certain.  Even National Union Chairman Avigdor 
Lieberman, says Sa\'ar, may decide to stay in his ministerial 
seat.  Sa\'ar confirmed that he and other Likud MKs were 
trying to convince these parties to stay in the coalition 
even after the plan is approved.  \"We prefer if the 
right-wing stays\" rather than having Labor join the 
coalition, Sa\'ar stressed. 
 
------------------------------ 
Pushing Away Thoughts of Mazuz 
------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) Sa\'ar declined to speculate on the possibility that 
Attorney General Menachem Mazuz would recommend that PM 
Sharon be indicted on bribery charges in the Greek Island 
Affair (ref B).  He told poloff that he \"cannot think about 
(the issue.)\"  He did underline, however, his view that Mazuz 
could only lean on the weight of the evidence at hand when 
making his decision, not on subjective matters such as 
whether indicting Sharon would be for the national good.

GROWS HIS BUSINESS THROUGH PEACE ACTIVISM AND OUTREACH.

1.  (SBU) Summary:  In the mixed city of Jaffa, where Jews 
and Arabs buy and sell side-by-side in one of the busiest 
marketplace environments in Israel, prominent bakery owner 
Hamis Abouelafia made news this week by presenting a 
ceremonial loaf of leavened bread to Jews at an 
end-of-Passover celebration.  This event was the most recent 
example of the work Abouelafia has been doing for years, 
which aims to foster a better business environment for 
Israeli Arabs as well as encourage peaceful coexistence in 
the broader arena.  Economic officer spoke with him about 
subjects ranging from his multi-ethnic charity organization 
to the annual Arab Land Day events, and discovered that his 
unusual perspective may offer some surprising solutions to 
the issues Israeli-Arab businesses face in the current 
environment.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Bread and Circus: In a Mixed Marketplace, Symbolic Gestures 
Pay Dividends 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Hamis Abouelafia, a familiar Jaffa personality 
whose family has worked on the same spot in the town\'s center 
since 1879, became news this week when Israel\'s channel 2 
aired a spot featuring his participation in the historic 
revival of a Moroccan Jewish Passover tradition.  Invited by 
the Savir family of Tel Aviv as the guest of honor at the 
Mimuna celebration, Abouelafia presented over 300 revelers 
with the first plate of hametz, or leavened bread, at sunset 
to mark the end of the holiday.  Quoting the late Zionist 
poet Natan Alterman\'s statement that \"peace will be made in 
the marketplace before it is made in the government,\" he 
encouraged others to follow suit in coming years. Host Ami 
Savir explained that this gesture of mutual respect was once 
a cornerstone of the Passover celebration and a way of 
affirming the good relations between Jews and Muslims in the 
mixed areas of Morocco.  He said the symbol was particularly 
apt for modern Israel, where the circumstances are dire and 
the need for coexistence urgent. 
 
3.  (SBU) At a meeting with Abouelafia at his street side 
bakery, he restated that he believes peace will be made 
primarily through the activities of everyday people, in the 
streets and markets of the \"schonot\", or close-knit 
neighborhoods.  He should know, he says: his family has seen 
six generations of booming business in Jaffa, through five 
wars and two Intifadas.  Today Abouelafia and Brothers 
employs over 200 workers in restaurants, bakeries, and a real 
estate office.  He says the key to his success should 
surprise no one: take care of your employees and invest 
resources in your customer base.  He believes that in this 
environment, \'resources\' means intangible, not-for-sale items 
such as respect, understanding, and a careful tread around 
sensitive political issues. 
 
4.  (SBU) In the workplace, Abouelafia said he endeavors to 
foster harmony by requesting that his employees turn off the 
television during potentially incendiary events, and by 
discouraging political discussions on the job.  He said he 
makes a point to hire Jews, Muslims, and Christians in equal 
measure, working closely himself with the Jewish woman he 
employees as his assistant.  His customer base is mixed as 
well, and on any given day a passerby can spot black-hatted 
Haredim haggling next to bearded sheikhs for the softest 
laffa and freshest baklava.  He takes pains to keep such 
Jewish customers coming back by doing them an unusual favor: 
he closes up shop over the Passover holiday out of respect 
for the dietary restrictions of the observant.  He notes that 
the gratitude the gesture gains him is more valuable than the 
money he does not make during the holiday week.  Efforts like 
these may help keep his business on solid ground even amidst 
conflict, because, as he says, \"Abouelafia is a household 
name on both sides.\" 
 
---------------------------------- 
Facing the Reality of the Intifada 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Despite such gestures of outreach and goodwill, 
Abouelafia speaks freely about the difficulties he and other 
Arab businessmen face in the mixed cities.  He says that the 
second Intifada has harmed Israeli-Arab business more than 
any previous conflict - and he is unsure whether it is fear 
or a vague concept of punishment that has caused a drop in 
the number of Jewish customers.  Economic officer held an 
informal conversation with a group of young Tel Aviv Jews who 
emphasized the punitive element.  They noted that when it 
came to light that some Israeli Arabs had supported several 
of the suicide bombings in Tel Aviv, Abouelaffia was hit 
especially hard because of his visibility.  Despite the fact 
that Abouelafia\'s bakeries and restaurants employ and serve 
Jews as well as Israeli Arabs, rumors began circulating that 
his employees spit on or even poisoned the food. 
 
6.  (SBU) Abouelafia believes that his response to such 
negative sentiment is unique in that it reaches beyond his 
own economic self-interest.  During last year\'s intense 
period of almost-daily suicide bombings and heightened 
tensions, many of his friends who owned small to medium-sized 
businesses such as humus stands, gift shops, and garages, 
simply closed up shop and left for Canada or the United 
States.  Abouelafia took a different tack, printing up 
plastic bags for customers on which were written, in Hebrew 
and Arabic, \"Abouelafia calls both sides to be patient and to 
refrain from violence.\"  Similarly, Abouelafia saw this 
year\'s Arab Land Day as an opportunity to discourage his 
neighbors from activities that could be seen as incendiary 
and lead to situations of real danger.  He says he called all 
of the Arab leaders of Jaffa together ) businessmen and 
sheikhs, Christians and Muslims alike - and advised them to 
keep a tight hold on their neighborhoods.  \"You can know how 
a protest starts\", he told them, \"but not how it might end. 
Stay inside this year.\"  Whether through his influence or due 
to other factors, there were no demonstrations ) and hence 
no clashes with Israeli authorities ) in Jaffa on Land Day. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Sponsoring Peace: Abouelafia\'s Coexistence Association 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7.  (SBU) Abouelafia explains that when he realized the 
second Intifada would not end quickly, he wanted something in 
place that would counteract its devastating effects on his 
business and his community.  Last year he founded 
Abouelafia\'s Coexistence Association, a charity run by a 
board of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim residents of Jaffa. 
The Coexistence Association gives financial assistance to 
needy families from the three religious groups, for anything 
from a Passover Seder to children\'s clothing.  The only 
catch, he says, is that beneficiaries are made aware the 
money comes from an organization founded by Arabs.  When he 
donated money to a soccer team that included Jewish and Arab 
children, for example, their jerseys bore his name.  When the 
Association paid for supplies and tee shirts for a school 
tour group traveling the country, Abouelafia was especially 
glad to see his logo in a short spot on the Hebrew news. 
 
8.  (SBU) Comment:  Abouelafia acknowledges that his 
Association does as much to counteract the unpopularity of 
Israeli-Arab business in times of conflict as it does to 
foster peaceful coexistence in the broader arena ) and he 
makes no apologies for promoting peace because of its 
economic benefits.  Abouelafia is unusual in his local fame 
and his inherited wealth, and it would be difficult for less 
established Arab businessmen to imitate the outreach tactics 
he employs, such as quoting Zionist poets and making 
conciliatory public statements at a Passover Seder, without 
alienating some community members.  But the fact that his 
daily turnover has increased since the founding of the 
Coexistence Association may encourage other Israeli-Arab 
businessmen to find their own programs of outreach to Jewish 
customers.  End comment.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The major Hebrew media bannered the release of nuclear 
whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu, which will take place 
tomorrow.  Several media reported that Monday Interior 
Minister Avraham Poraz signed an injunction forbidding 
him to leave the country for one year.  Ha\'aretz 
reported that Thomas Graham, former U.S. president Bill 
Clinton\'s special envoy to the Nuclear Non- 
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) talks, and Avner Cohen, 
author of \"Israel and the Bomb,\" which details the 
country\'s nuclear capabilities, published an article in 
the May-June issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic 
Scientists, which calls on Israel to give up its 
nuclear ambiguity policy and join the NPT. 
 
Israel Radio reported that the UN Security Council is 
convening an emergency session to discuss the 
assassination of Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi.  The 
station reported that the Palestinian representative 
blamed the U.S. for emboldening Israel to assassinate 
Rantisi by vetoing a Security Council resolution 
condemning last month\'s \"extrajudicial execution\" of 
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.  The PLO representative also 
linked the assassination with the letters exchanged 
between President Bush and PM Sharon, which he said 
contravened international law.  The radio notes that 
the U.S. is expected to veto the resolution. 
 
All media reported that Monday FM Silvan Shalom 
expressed his support for Sharon\'s disengagement plan. 
Yet, Ha\'aretz cited the concern of Sharon\'s advisers, 
led by his son, Knesset Member Omri Sharon, that Sharon 
will not win a decisive victory in the May 2 referendum 
of Likud rank-and-file voters.  The newspaper also 
reported that Sharon is intensifying efforts to gain 
the Russian vote in the party. 
 
The media reported that eight Israeli civilians were 
wounded, one seriously, by Qassam rocket fire Monday at 
the settlement of Nissanit in the Gaza Strip.  An IDF 
soldier was wounded in clashes south of Nablus, while 
an unarmed Palestinian was killed by IDF gunfire south 
of Hebron.  Maariv cited the suspicions of the defense 
establishment that Sunday\'s shooting incident in the 
Galilee, in which border police killed an Israeli Arab, 
could be linked to Hizbullah activity in Israel. 
 
Israel Radio reported that the PA is considering 
canceling the post of Palestinian PM and returning all 
attributes of authority to PA Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
Jerusalem Post reported that Arafat phoned several 
senior Hamas officials in the last 24 hours in an 
attempt to persuade them to resume inter-Palestinian 
talks about the establishment of a joint leadership. 
Ha\'aretz reported that a memorandum of understanding 
issued by the leadership of Palestinian prisoners in 
Israel under the patronage of jailed Tanzim leader 
Marwan Barghouti calls for a total end to armed 
struggle emanating from Gaza if a series of conditions 
are met.  The conditions detailed in the document, or 
\"proposal,\" sent to Fatah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, 
includes \"complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, 
including the \"Philadelphi Route\" on the Israeli- 
Egyptian border; full Palestinian sovereignty over the 
Strip, including the sea and air ports; and the release 
from Israeli prisons of all Gaza residents.  In 
exchange for fulfilling the conditions, \"the armed 
forces in Gaza will be obligated not to conduct any 
armed actions from Gaza,\" according to the document. 
 
All media reported that Monday the High Court of 
Justice handed down stiffer sentences than a district 
court for Yitzhak Pas and Matityahu Shvu, two members 
of the militant group of settlers known as the \"Bat 
Ayin underground.\" 
 
Leading media reported that Monday Bush appointed John 
Negroponte, currently the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, 
Ambassador to Iraq.  As he commented on American and 
British efforts to turn Iraq into a stable and 
prosperous democracy, Michael Ancram, the British 
Conservative Party\'s \"shadow foreign secretary,\" was 
quoted as saying in an interview with Ha\'aretz: 
\"Attempts to impose Western models in the Middle East 
could lead to unwanted, even much worse consequences.\" 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio quoted Jewish officials as 
saying in New York Monday that Iraqi Jews who fled 
their homeland in the 1950s will receive from the 
French insurance company AXA compensation for the 
insurance policies they purchased when they were still 
Iraqi citizens and still owners of assets and property 
there.  Ha\'aretz quoted Ilan Steinberg, the Director- 
General of the World Jewish Congress, as saying Monday: 
\"This is a breakthrough and justice has been done in an 
area that has been neglected for years.\" 
 
Yediot reported that California Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger will meet with Sharon on May 2, the day 
the referendum will be held in the Likud. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Monday New Zealand PM Helen 
Clark and senior officials in her government toned down 
remarks regarding the affair involving two Israelis 
arrested on suspicion of attempting to obtain fake 
passports.  Yediot reported that the New Zealand 
government acknowledged that the detainees are Israeli 
envoys.  Citing the New Zealand Herald, Maariv quoted 
Clarke as saying that the Israelis will be entitled to 
a fair trial. 
 
Jerusalem Post led with, and other media reported on, 
an affair involving Transportation Minster Avigdor 
Lieberman.  He allegedly used his Russian connections 
to help extricate Bank Austria Creditanstalt, the 
largest bank in Austria, from a sharp drop in the 
Russian ruble in 1998.  Lieberman had stepped down 
months before as D-G of the Prime Minister\'s Office 
under Binyamin Netanyahu.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Don\'t Let Terror Ruin Things\" 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus, the 
first journalist whom Prime Minister Sharon apprised of 
his withdrawal plan, wrote in independent, left-leaning 
Ha\'aretz (April 20): \"Bumping off Rantisi was 
justified.  I doubt that even the heads of the 
Palestinian Authority, including Dahlan, shed a tear 
over his death.... [Anyway], Hamas wants to reap the 
fruit of Israel\'s unilateral withdrawal and evacuation 
of settlement in Gaza, presenting it as a victory for 
the group.  Israel must be on its guard not to get 
sucked into this game.... Sharon has launched a 
dramatic initiative to withdraw Israeli forces and 
clear out 20 settlements in the Gaza Strip -- a move 
that President Bush has described as an historic about- 
face and the first stage in implementing the road map 
on the way to establishing a Palestinian state.  We 
must take care that terror -- of which there will be 
more -- and our disproportionate responses to it, do 
not endanger the disengagement plan or cause the Sharon 
administration, which is not bowled over by the plan in 
any case, to turn against it.... Now is the time for 
Sharon the statesman to eclipse Sharon the general, and 
the forum of five to act like a political cabinet 
rather than a subsidiary of the General Staff.  Terror 
must not be allowed to torpedo the first political 
initiative in years to offer a small glimmer of hope 
for a better future.\" 
 
II.  \"Disengagement Illusions\" 
 
Conservative columnist Nadav Shragai wrote in Ha\'aretz 
(April 20): \"The political graveyard in which the 
minister of history buries friendly statements by 
American presidents to Israel, is already populated by 
quite a few ... watersheds.  Bill Clinton, for example, 
provided Ehud Barak with exactly the same merchandise 
that Bush is now giving Sharon.  Bush, how 
embarrassing, even made sure to say in his letter to 
Sharon that the fact that he doesn\'t expect Israel to 
withdraw to the 1967 borders is practically an 
historical fact: \"All previous efforts to negotiate a 
two-state solution have reached the same conclusion,\" 
wrote Bush.  The main difference between all the 
previous presidential declarations and the one given by 
Bush is that no Israeli prime minister in the past ever 
considered initiating a unilateral withdrawal, and 
certainly not during a war, just to win such a 
statement from the U.S.\" 
 
 
III.  \"The Palestinians\' Turn\" 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the lead editorial of mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (April 20): \"An 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza without disengagement 
places the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at a 
crossroads. Gaza after the withdrawal is liable to 
become a giant Palestinian ghetto.... A Gaza like that 
will be a humanitarian disaster and a terrorist powder 
keg.  But that very same Gaza Strip after the Israeli 
withdrawal could also be a cornerstone for a new 
reality, a stepping stone to the establishment of an 
independent and democratic Palestine, which was cited 
explicitly as \'Palestine\' in the letter Sharon gave to 
President Bush.  For that, the Palestinians are going 
to need the world\'s help, Israeli good will and, above 
all, Palestinian national resolve.... The Palestinians\' 
initial responses to the exchange of letters between 
Bush and Sharon were furious and bordered on the 
hysterical, which only became more pronounced with the 
insult of the Rantisi assassination.  But insult is 
mendacious diplomatic counsel.  The Palestinians have 
not lacked for mendacious counsel of that kind in the 
past number of decades.  What they have wanted for was 
truthful counsel.\" 
 
IV.  \"Netanyahu\'s Astuteness\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (April 20): \"Netanyahu has 
moved his political address from Against Disengagement 
Alley to Support Disengagement Avenue, because he is 
smart, because he is moving to the middle ground in 
preparation for the battle of succession, and because 
he has no choice.... The advantage of Sharon\'s plan is 
that Likud supporters are capable of swallowing it, 
because it can be fed to them in small doses.  First 
there was the road map.  Now there is the withdrawal 
from Gaza and four settlements in Samaria [the northern 
West Bank].  For this alone Netanyahu cannot unravel 
the unity of the Likud.... Moreover, the most important 
thing is still ahead of us and it is two-pronged. 
First of all there are some grounds for believing that 
the disengagement plan will never be implemented, and 
this is a subject for a separate discussion.  Secondly, 
it is possible that in the year 2005 it will be 
Netanyahu who is called upon to implement the 
disengagement.  This will be when it is clear whether 
John Kerry will be the next occupant of the White 
House, and whether the cases of the straw companies and 
Cyril Kern have sent Sharon back to his farm and his 
sons to the dock, and in such a case Netanyahu could be 
the next prime minister.  So will he appear as the 
leader of the opposition on such a central issue?  It 
is not worth his while, because if he becomes prime 
minister he will have to go to Washington and stand 
before the Arab world with something more than empty 
hands.  Netanyahu too knows that Sharon\'s disengagement

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized: 
\"Israel is a law-abiding country.  Vanunu served his 
sentence.  Any further extraordinary efforts to silence 
him will only perpetuate both his status as a symbol 
and the campaign that has grown around him.\"

\"A Damaging Over-Reaction\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (April 
20): \"It is entirely possible that the ongoing over- 
reaction to Vanunu has damaged Israel much more and 
longer than the one-time publication in the Sunday 
Times.  Given the two obsessions that have become 
focused on Vanunu -- keeping him silent or making him 
divine -- it is no wonder that his release from prison 
tomorrow, after serving all 18 years of his prison 
sentence, has turned into a particularly charged 
moment.... Presumably, after his release, Vanunu will 
continue to serve -- willingly, and with the support of 
those around him -- as an instrument with which to 
attack Israel and its policies.  The defense 
establishment\'s desire to continue to control what he 
says is understandable even if it is not at all clear 
what further damage could be caused by someone who has 
been cut off from any security secret for the last 20 
years.  But Israel is a law-abiding country.  Vanunu 
served his sentence.  Any further extraordinary efforts 
to silence him will only perpetuate both his status as 
a symbol and the campaign that has grown around him.\"

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"If one were to write a recipe for failure in Iraq, 
putting the UN in charge would probably be the place to 
start.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
\"How to Lose Iraq\" 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(April 20): \"One might think, looking at all the 
troubles in Iraq, that the place is a hopeless mess. 
Actually, in broad terms, the situation is surprisingly 
promising.  The basic Western interest is that Iraq 
enjoy a stable and representative non-despotic 
government that serves the interests of all three major 
groupings: the Kurds, Sunnis, and Shi\'ites.  All three 
groups have a fairly strong incentive to support a 
system with sufficiently robust checks and balances 
that no one group will be able to dominate the 
others.... Let\'s assume that Bush and Blair, having 
been burned by the UN in the run-up to the war in Iraq, 
are not entirely naive about just how the UN might try 
to shape Iraq\'s post-war future. And let\'s say that, in 
an ideal world, the UN could provide a patina of 
legitimacy and even logistical and troop support for a 
hitherto controversial allied effort.  But the big 
question here is who is fooling whom. The UN ... has a 
long and corrupt history with Iraq.... The UN 
bureaucracy, France and Russia have a huge incentive to 
cover up their own complicity in Saddam\'s pillaging of 
Iraq, as does the Arab bloc in preventing a successful 
Iraqi regime from arising. The UN is the ideal vehicle 
for all these anti-democracy forces. Indeed, if one 
were to write a recipe for failure in Iraq, putting the 
UN in charge would probably be the place to start.\"

1.  (C) Summary: Labor leader Shimon Peres told CODEL Issa 
April 16 that the United States should be promoting 
modernization in the Middle East -- rather than 
democratization -- as the best means for furthering the U.S. 
agenda in the region.  Peres recommended using business and 
investment as key tools, adding that elections now in places 
like Saudi Arabia would only serve to usher in regimes that 
would oppose U.S. goals.  Peres cautioned against trying to 
end terrorism by the eradication of terrorists alone, and 
stressed the need to address terrorism\'s underlying causes. 
On PM Sharon\'s proposed unilateral withdrawal from Gaza and 
some West Bank settlements, Peres opined that the plan does 
not go far enough, as the political costs to the government 
would be the same.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Labor leader Shimon Peres met April 16 with 
Congressman Darrell Issa and House International Relations 
Committee staff member Hillel Weinberg.  Peres welcomed PM 
Sharon\'s proposed unilateral withdrawal from Gaza and some 
settlements in the West Bank, but added that pushing the 
Palestinians out of the negotiating equation would be a 
mistake.  Although the U.S. clearly hoped to foster new 
leadership among the Palestinians, Peres cautioned that it 
was not possible to order it.  It is essential that both 
Israel and the U.S. \"deal with the Palestinians as they are 
and not how we might wish them to be\" if progress is to be 
made.  Sharon\'s proposed withdrawal plan is an opening, but 
not a guarantee that the future would improve. 
 
---------------------------- 
\"Israel Needs to go Further\" 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Saying that FinMin Benyamin Netanyahu had lost the 
support of the poor that had been the traditional base of 
Likud support by his harsh imposition of economic reform, 
Peres added that now Likud had given up territory as well. 
Peres opined that Israel should agree to take bigger steps, 
as the political cost will be the same for large steps as for 
small ones with regard to settlements.  Stressing that Sharon 
was his personal friend, Peres said that Sharon does not have 
enough courage to engage the Palestinians; instead he chooses 
to act alone and disengage.  Peres took exception with the 
GOI\'s stance that the Palestinians must completely end 
terrorism before Israel is obligated to enact its obligations 
under the roadmap.  Without some simultaneous reciprocal 
actions on Israel\'s part, Palestinian moderates are 
undermined before they could even begin.  It is impossible, 
Peres concluded, to end terrorism without first addressing 
its root causes.  The GOI is mistaken if it thinks that it 
can end terrorism by simply killing all the terrorists. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
\"Focus on Modernization, not Democratization\" 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Peres said he disagreed with the United States\' 
Greater Middle East plan, as it lumps strict Muslim countries 
together with more moderate ones such as Morocco and Jordan. 
Furthermore, \"democracy is a danger,\" Peres said, and terror 
and democracy do not mix.  If elections were held tomorrow in 
Saudi Arabia for example, conservatives would undoubtedly 
win.  Results in Pakistan and even Morocco could be equally 
disadvantageous to the United States.  The West needs to talk 
about modernization and not democratization, Peres stressed, 
and the U.S. should use its economic clout to get the message 
out.  For example, if money now going to foreign aid would 
instead go to support U.S. companies, those companies could 
then go out and establish what Peres called \"zones of 
excellence\" in the Middle East.  \"Bring private enterprise 
into diplomacy,\" Peres recommended, \"because diplomacy never 
succeeded in bringing in private enterprise.\"  Giving people 
hope for a better life for themselves and their families 
would have far more impact than anything else the United 
Sates could do in the Middle East, Peres asserted.  No 
regime, he added, could continue to support forever the high 
and growing levels of unemployment currently facing Arab 
countries. 
 
5.  (U) CODEL Issa did not have an opportunity to clear the 
message.

SUBJECT: BIBI BULLISH ON ISRAELI ECONOMY TO CODEL ISSA 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Richard LeBaron, per 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: An ebullient Binyamin Netanyahu told CODEL 
Issa April 14 that Israel\'s economy is continuing to improve 
now that reforms are beginning to take effect.  Netanyahu\'s 
\"success\" in battling the unions, GDP growing at 3 percent 
this year, pension reform, and lower taxes are all 
contributing factors.  The GOI intends to keep its focus on 
reducing the deficit and to invest in infrastructure, 
including the completion of the Trans-Israel Highway, as well 
as a rail system to connect Ashdod port with the Red Sea port 
of Eilat.  It further intends to reduce the number of foreign 
workers in Israel to lower the unemployment rate among 
Israelis and thus reduce state expenditure on welfare 
benefits.  CODEL Issa raised concerns about U.S. companies 
being shut out of competition on the natural gas pipeline 
network and cellular phone contracts, both of which Netanyahu 
promised to look into.  A Bank of Israel official was also 
upbeat on the direction of the Israeli economy, but cautioned 
that the GOI still had some way to go in its reforms.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (C) An energized Binyamin Netanyahu told Congressman 
Darrell Issa and House International Relations Committee 
staff member Hillel Weinberg April 14 that the Israeli 
economy is moving in the right direction under his guidance 
at the Ministry of Finance.  Charge d\'Affaires Richard 
LeBaron also attended.  Opening the meeting, Netanyahu said 
that in his two-year tenure to date union wages had been 
lowered, the government\'s work force reduced by 2 percent, 
the VAT lowered to 17 percent from 18 percent, and the income 
tax reduced as well.  The economy is currently growing by 3 
percent and the stock market has risen by 100 percent since 
last year, he added.  Crowing over his victory against the 
unions, Netanyahu described how he had wrested control of the 
pension system from the unions and raised the retirement age 
from 65 to 67 in order to pay for necessary restructuring and 
to balance the books.  The next and last step is to privatize 
the union pension system and the state-owned banks. 
Netanyahu said that he intends to decrease the number of 
foreign workers in Israel in order to reduce the number of 
Israelis living off of the state\'s welfare benefits.  This 
would, in turn, contribute to a lowering of state 
expenditures.  Although many of his reforms are unpopular (as 
demonstrated by the number of strikes Israel has weathered), 
Netanyahu said that he had taken a lesson from U.S. Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan who applies two questions to 
evaluate the health of an economy to gauge the health of the 
Israeli economy.  First, is the stock market rising?  The 
answer, he said, clearly is \"yes.\"  Second, are the rates for 
long-term bonds falling?  Again, Netanyahu reported the 
answer in Israel was a resounding \"yes.\"  Saying his main 
report card is the behavior of the markets, Netanyahu clearly 
thought he had scored well. 
 
--------------------------- 
Investing in Infrastructure 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Netanyahu announced that the GOI intends to construct 
a rail line as a land bridge to connect the Red Sea port of 
Eilat with the Mediterranean port of Ashdod, the goal being 
to develop a route to compete with the Suez Canal.  Goods 
would move by rail to Ashdod and then by ship across the 
Mediterranean.  Netanyahu pointed out that almost two thirds 
of all shipping containers currently return to Europe from 
Israel empty; the new rail line would make filling the 
containers easier, in particular facilitating the movement of 
Dead Sea minerals to the coast for export.  Netanyahu also 
said that the GOI is investing in the completion of the 
north-south Trans-Israel Highway, which will assist in 
opening up the southern regions of Israel, in particular the 
Negev.  With regard to the purchase of natural gas from 
Egypt, Netanyahu said that he wants competition for all gas 
suppliers, including the Egyptians, British Gas, and the 
Israeli-American supplier. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
\"Level the Playing Field for U.S. Business\" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Congressman Issa congratulated Netanyahu on all of 
the reforms that have been implemented during his tenure at 
the ministry, but noted that the VAT, even at the new rate of 
17 percent, remains high.  Netanyahu agreed, adding that he 
hopes the rate will go even lower in the future.  Turning to 
the development of a domestic pipeline for gas distribution, 
Congressman Issa stressed that by hiring a Dutch firm to 
design the pipeline, Israel appears to have committed to 
using Dutch specifications for the pipeline\'s construction -- 
a situation that clearly cuts out American firms from the 
process, despite the fact that U.S. technology is the world 
standard.  Netanyahu agreed, seemingly surprised by the news. 
 He said he would look into the matter. 
 
5.  (C) Moving on to cellular communication, Congressman Issa 
said that the United States wants only a level playing field 
for U.S. companies to enter the market.  For example, 
Qualcomm is a world leader in CDMA (code division multiple 
access) or fixed wireless technology, but not on the GSM 
system standard used in Europe and in some countries of the 
Middle East.  In Saudi Arabia, the SAG had held an open bid 
for the cellphone system, but only on the GSM system, leaving 
no room for CDMA despite CDMA\'s far lower cost for domestic 
users and an area where U.S. firms such as Qualcomm excel. 
Issa asked that Israel leave room for both technologies to 
develop and let the markets themselves decide which will 
predominate.  Netanyahu said that Israel intends to privatize 
Bezeq (the Israeli telephone service) and he promised to 
examine the possibilities of taking the two-system approach 
advocated by the Congressman. 
 
----------------------- 
Israel Bank Also Upbeat 
----------------------- 
6.  (C) Karnit Flug, head of research at the Bank of Israel, 
was somewhat less ebullient than the FinMin, but still upbeat 
in her April 14 discussion with HIRC staff member Hillel 
Weinberg.  Flug said that while there had been an initial dip 
in the Israeli economy in 2001, it is difficult to determine 
how much of that could be related to the Intifada and how 
much to the poor state of the world economy at that time. 
The effects of the Intifada were initially felt in areas such 
as tourism, but those effects gradually spread to other parts 
of the economy as investors realized that the uncertainty 
connected with the Intifada was going to be a longer term 
phenomenon. 
 
7.  (C) Flug reported that the spike in unemployment in year 
2000 had leveled out in 2003, with the export sector clearly 
leading the recovery.  The GOI is serious in its efforts to 
limit the number of foreign workers in Israel, the number of 
whom almost matches the current rate of unemployment.  Flug 
disputed the conventional wisdom that foreign workers take 
jobs that Israeli citizens would not.  As an example, she 
cited the approximately 35,000 Israeli Arabs who had been 
employed in the construction industry up until the 
mid-1990\'s.  Now, because foreign labor is so inexpensive, 
virtually all of the positions are now held by foreign 
workers. 
 
8.  (C) Calling the current government\'s fiscal policy \"more 
responsible and determined,\" Flug gave FinMin Netanyahu high 
marks on his willingness to take tough measures to reduce the 
deficit (Note: the goal for 2004 is 4 percent.  End note). 
That, in turn, allowed the Bank to ease interest rates.  She 
cautioned, however, that the GOI still has a long way to go 
to reduce the size and cost of government expenditures. 
 
9.  (U) CODEL Issa did not have an opportunity to clear this 
message.

1.  Release of Mordechai Vanunu 
 
2.  Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All major media led with the release after 18 years in 
jail for aggravated espionage of whistleblower, or 
\"atomic spy,\" Mordechai Vanunu, which took place this 
morning.  The Israeli media often describe the expected 
commotion of foreign media and Vanunu supporters as the 
\"Vanunu festival.\"  Speaking live to the media outside 
Ashkelon jail, Vanunu attacked Israel\'s security 
services, principally Shin Bet and Mossad, saying that 
he had been subjected to cruel and barbaric treatment 
during his incarceration.  He added that he had no 
further secrets to divulge, alleging that he suffered 
for 18 years because he was a Christian rather than a 
Jew.  He said his primary message was a call to open 
the Dimona nuclear reactor complex to international 
inspections.  He stated that he wants to live and study 
in the U.S. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that along with Israel, the U.S. will 
be following Vanunu\'s words and deeds after his 
release.  The newspaper noted that Gideon Frank, the D- 
G of Israel\'s Atomic Energy Commission, met in Israel 
Tuesday with John Bolton, U/S for Arms Control and 
International Security.  The two men discussed Vanunu\'s 
release.  Ha\'aretz writes that the working assumption 
is that Vanunu will try to cause problems for Israel. 
Jerusalem Post reported that acting on a tip from 
security sources, police detained a CNN television crew 
on Tuesday as it was filming near the restricted Dimona 
nuclear reactor in the Negev. 
 
A Ha\'aretz dialogue poll found that 47 percent of 
Israelis believe that Vanunu should not be released 
yet; 44 percent believe that he should be freed; 9 
percent are undecided. 
 
All media reported that Jordan\'s King Abdullah II 
abruptly postponed a meeting with President Bush. 
Jerusalem Post quoted Jordanian FM Marwan Muasher as 
saying Tuesday that he was persuaded the U.S. did not 
intend to prejudice final status negotiations between 
Israel and the PA.  Ha\'aretz reported that Tuesday 
senior Israeli officials called Jordanian anti- 
disengagement activity and its opposition to the 
separation fence \"matters that do not at all concern 
Jordan, but are entirely between us and the 
Palestinians.\"  Israel Radio quoted Powell as saying at 
his meeting with Muasher: \"We should take advantage of 
the opportunity created by the evacuation of 
settlements for the first time in decades.\"  Powell was 
also quoted as saying: \"I think that people will see 
over time that the United States is committed to the 
welfare, benefit, and the hopes and dreams and 
aspirations of the Arab nations, and especially the 
hopes and dreams and aspirations of the Palestinian 
people.\" 
Leading media reported that the IDF is leaning toward 
shutting down the Erez industrial zone in the northern 
Gaza Strip, due to the spate of terrorist attacks in 
the area.  Leading media reported that Tuesday five 
Palestinians were killed during disturbances in the 
northern Gaza Strip towns of Beit Hanun and Beit 
Lahiya.  Israel Radio reported that four armed 
Palestinians were killed there today.  A series of 
Qassam rockets and mortar attacks was launched from 
that area on targets in the Strip and in Israel, 
beginning early Tuesday morning. 
 
Leading media reported that Sharon vowed Tuesday in 
Ashdod that his government would not give up its policy 
of targeted assassinations against what Israel calls 
\"ticking bombs.\"  Leading media quoted Hamas leader 
Khaled Mashal as saying in Damascus Monday that Arab 
and Muslims must join forces to defend themselves 
against the U.S. and Israel, and support the 
Palestinians in their worsening conflict with Israel. 
 
All media reported that Tuesday Defense Minister Shaul 
Mofaz described the unilateral disengagement plan from 
the Gaza Strip as a \"historical step\" and the \"right 
move.\"  Mofaz was speaking to soldiers in the Strip. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Yediot reported that Monday in New York, 
at a meeting organized by American Friends of Tel Aviv 
University, former U.S. president Bill Clinton hinted 
that Israel should consider resuming talks with PA 
Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
 
All media highlighted a remark PM Sharon\'s son Gilad 
made Tuesday to the Petah Tikva Magistrate\'s Court that 
he threw out audio tapes he had secretly recorded 
during conversations with businessman David Appel about 
the fee he would receive for his services regarding 
Appel\'s \"Greek island\" project. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Monday in Jerusalem 
Finance Minister Binyamin told a 600-member solidarity 
mission from Michigan: \"You come here because you want 
to ensure that Israel\'s present and future are secure.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Democratic presidential 
candidate Sen. John Kerry is currently investing 
\"special efforts\" to persuade the Jewish-American 
community to support him. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that New Zealand police are hunting 
for a fourth man in the passport mystery case involving 
Israelis. 
 
Israel Radio reported that this morning at least 60 
people were killed and 200 were wounded in an attack 
against three police stations in Baghdad.

I.  \"The Triumph of Ambiguity\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 21): \"There 
was a time when American officials would squirm 
uncomfortably when accusations of \'double standards\' 
were leveled against them.  Why, they would be asked, 
does the U.S. pressure Arab states and Iran to refrain 
from attempts to develop nuclear capacities, whereas it 
turns a blind eye to Israel\'s program?  Times have 
changed.  Today, leaders in the West openly justify 
Israel\'s nuclear program, depicting it as an insurance 
policy taken out by a small, vulnerable country whose 
hostile neighbors constantly threaten to destroy it.... 
[After Libya announced in December 2003 that it was 
abandoning its unconventional weapons program] U.S. 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was ... blunt: 
 
SIPDIS 
\'Israel is a small country, and it is located in a 
region in which many threaten to throw it in the sea. 
Israel prefers not to be thrown into the sea, and so it 
has organized itself accordingly.\'  In his letter to 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon last week, U.S. President 
George Bush said his country would \'preserve and 
strengthen\' Israel\'s ability to \'deter and defend 
itself\' against any threat.  This assurance reiterated 
declarations made by president Bill Clinton to prime 
ministers Binyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak.  Israeli 
officials regarded Bush\'s comments as a clear hint that 
the U.S. believes Israel should be able to maintain its 
nuclear program.\" 
 
II.  \"Now Be Silent\" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer and the late prime minister 
Yitzhak Rabin\'s assistant Eytan Haber opined in the 
lead editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (April 21): \"Against 200 or 300 million 
Muslims in immediate proximity, and over a billion 
Muslims worldwide, stand -- if they exist -- the \'bombs 
in the basement.\'  Egyptian president Anwar Sadat 
hurried to Jerusalem and King Hussein wished to sign a 
peace agreement only because of \'Dimona.\'  Muslim 
leaders, from Iran to Pakistan, who dream at night of 
destroying the Jewish people, wake up in the morning 
drenched with sweat, upon recalling the Israeli nuclear 
reactor.... Mordechai Vanunu broke the secrecy of 
Dimona, and paid for it with 18 years of 
imprisonment.... Let the man please open a new chapter 
of his life.  But the man is determined to continue to 
harm -- or \'destroy\' in his words -- the Nuclear 
Research Center, and if possible Israel as well.... The 
man will remain silent and win his full freedom.  And 
if he opens his mouth on forbidden topics?  He will 
receive the treatment given to any revealer of secrets, 
and will be prosecuted.  This is the whole story, and I 
personally must provide full disclosure on the matter: 
I served close to the decision makers in the affair of 
Mordechai Vanunu when the man decided to choose his odd 
and convoluted path, a path that is dangerous to us 
all.\" 
 
III.  \"Vanunu\'s Release\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(April 21): \"Among the many things said about Mordechai 
Vanunu, the Israeli due to be released from prison 
today after serving his 18-year sentence for revealing 
the country\'s nuclear secrets, is that he is a champion 
of the anti-nuclear cause.  Not so.  In 1981, Vanunu, 
with Arab activists, protested against Israel\'s 
destruction of Iraq\'s Osirak reactor. Vanunu, then, 
wasn\'t against the bomb outright.  He apparently 
approved of it in Arab hands.  Indeed, for years prior 
to Vanunu\'s arrest and trial, he was a pro-Arab 
extremist.... The cumulative damage he will continue to 
do to Israel as a propagandist will considerably exceed 
the damage he caused as a spy.... In the very act of 
letting him go free, Israel proves wrong Vanunu\'s 
contentions about the State of Israel.\"

Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized: \"Those 
missiles are the writing on the wall.  They come as a 
warning to all those Likud cabinet minister joining the 
disengagement plan from the Strip, because we\'re 
talking about a down payment.\" 
 
Author and contributor Yitzhak Laor wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"The difference 
between us and Bush and his advisers is the price that 
we will pay here for the crime of missing the historic 
opportunity to divide the country.\" 
 
Former ambassador to France Ovadia Soffer wrote in 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post: \"Israeli 
diplomacy will be tested by its ability to exploit the

the Europeans to embrace the American approach to the 
refugee problem.\"

I.  \"Down Payment\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (April 21): 
\"Monday, the IDF identified dozens of attempts by 
Palestinians to launch missiles at Gush Katif [Gaza 
Strip] settlements.... Those missiles are the writing 
on the wall.  They come as a warning to all those Likud 
cabinet minister joining the disengagement plan from 
the Strip, because we\'re talking about a down payment; 
Heaven forbid, the big payment is still to come.... 
Attempts to carry out terrorist attacks ... will force 
the IDF to continue keeping significant forces in the 
Strip; so why is there a need to evacuate the Jewish 
settlements?.... Primitive logic maintains that the 
Arabs in the \'Strip\' are convinced that Israel is 
dismantling the Jewish settlements for the reason that 
it is surrendering to increasing terrorism.  That Arab 
thinking will encourage an upsurge of hostile actions 
in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] in order to 
achieve similar results.\" 
 
II.  \"We\'ll Take Whatever the Americans Allow\" 
 
Author and contributor Yitzhak Laor wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 21): \"During 
the decades of the occupation, the dovish camp has 
learned to summarize its position regarding annexation 
with the dogma, \'The Americans won\'t allow it.\'  Even 
the settler right has tended to believe that dogma, and 
decided to identify it with \'fear of the powerful 
gentile\' so familiar from the Diaspora, and such.  But 
that belief has been in stark contradiction to the 
facts.  Since the 1970 Rogers Plan, no U.S. 
administration, before or after elections, in a second 
term or not, has ever intended to halt the Israeli 
annexation of the last of the land available to the 
Palestinians to establish their own state.... What was 
called \'minor border corrections\' until the era of Ehud 
Barak has become \'land percentages,\' and behind those 
percentages is the assumption that Israel does not have 
the strength to demand of itself what it demands of the 
Palestinians -- a civil war.  Now Bush\'s promise has 
arrived as some great achievement for the coming years: 
the map of Israel has changed, the \'national divide\' 
will be postponed.  But what about the conflict with 
the Palestinians?  The difference between us and Bush 
and his advisers is the price that we will pay here for 
the crime of missing the historic opportunity to divide 
the country.\" 
 
III.  \"Put Israeli Diplomats to Work\" 
 
Former ambassador to France Ovadia Soffer wrote in 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (April 21): 
\"For the first time the president of the world\'s only 
superpower is taking Israel\'s side and granting written 
legitimacy to its position on the matters of refugees 
and borders.... Israeli diplomacy will be tested by its 
ability to exploit the interim period before the Gaza 
redeployment to convince the Europeans to embrace the 
American approach to the refugee problem.  They must 
press their Arab allies to take responsibility for the 
fate of the Palestinian refugees, which they have 
managed to evade for the last 50 years.... The 
disengagement plan, backed by the American president\'s 
statements, even if currently met with angry responses 
by the Palestinian side, could introduce an element of 
sobriety into Palestinian thought, at least on the 
matter of the right of return.  It could serve as a 
serious incentive to Israeli-American-European action 
in harnessing the Arab countries to a serious joint 
effort to find a pragmatic and practical solution to 
the problem of the Palestinian refugees, without which 
there will be no lasting peace in the Middle East.\"

1.  (C) Summary: Peace Now Director Yariv Oppenheimer told 
poloff on April 20 that PM Sharon and FinMin Netanyahu both 
know that prior GOI decisions on the fence route leave the 
Ariel settlement outside the main separation barrier, thereby 
not meeting Netanyahu\'s demand that it be fully on the 
\"Israel\" side of the route.  Oppenheimer believes that Sharon 
and Netanyahu are masking the differences to cast the 
withdrawal plan to suit their own political exigencies.  End 
summary. 
 
----------------- 
You Say Tomato... 
----------------- 
 
2.  (C) Peace Now Director Yariv Oppenheimer told Poloff on 
April 20 that according to his understanding of the relevant 
GOI decisions on separation barrier routing to which PM 
Sharon referred in media comments after his April 18 Cabinet 
session (reftel), Ariel and some other major settlements deep 
in the West Bank would be protected by security fences, but 
those fences would not be connected to the main separation 
barrier at least in the near term.  Netanyahu, however, 
announced to the media after the Cabinet meeting that he 
would support the plan because, he claimed, Sharon agreed 
that completion of the separation barrier, with Ariel and 
other major West Bank settlements on the \"Israel\" side, would 
occur before any settlement evacuations. 
 
3.  (C) According to Oppenheimer, PM Sharon needed to find a 
way to give Netanyahu an opening to support his plan -- 
support that most observers agree was critical to persuading 
other ministerial disengagement opponents to back the plan 
(reftel).  Some politicos and media pundits also argue that 
Netanyahu\'s support for the plan will sway Likud voters to 
favor it in the May 2 referendum.  Netanyahu cast Sharon\'s 
commitment to follow prior government decisions on the fence 
route as fulfilling Netanyahu\'s earlier demand for inclusion 
of named West Bank settlements, such as Ariel.  Sharon did 
not dispute this interpretation, but never, publicly at 
least, named specific settlements to be included in the fence 
route.  \"Everyone is hearing what they want to hear,\" 
Oppenheimer exclaimed. 
 
-------------------- 
It\'s All About Image 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Netanyahu could not afford not to back the plan in 
the face of USG support, said Oppenheimer, so he needed to 
find a way to back it and Sharon helped him do this. 
Sharon\'s reference to prior government decisions \"was just a 
political game to get Netanyahu\" to support the plan, 
according to Oppenheimer.  Oppenheimer pointed out that the 
game also worked for Netanyahu in that by supporting Sharon\'s 
plan, he could position himself within the mainstream, and 
thereby cast himself as prime minister material in case 
Sharon faces removal from office.  \"Netanyahu doesn\'t want to 
be alone on the right,\" Oppenheimer noted, but rather to back 
what he understands most Israelis want, especially if he 
wants to be prime minister again someday.

Sharansky told Ambassador Kurtzer April 20 that President 
Katsav requested that Sharansky attend the conference and 
there is a possibility he will do so.

1.  (C) Russian Special Middle East Envoy Kalugin told the 
Ambassador April 20 that President Bush\'s April 14 statement 
on Sharon\'s Disengagement Plan \"went further than the Road 
Map\" but was \"quite balanced.\"  Kalugin emphasized the value 
Russia placed on the role of negotiations between the parties 
and the continued involvement of the Quartet.  Kalugin said 
he is focusing now on preparing his minister for the upcoming 
meeting of Quartet ministers and is ready to work with other 
Quartet members to develop an agreed-upon statement for 
release at the meeting\'s conclusion. 
 
2.  (C) Kalugin, who was accompanied by Russian Ambassador 
Tarasov, asked a series of questions relating to various 
disengagement plan details, including the meaning of 
settlement growth, international trusteeship plans for Gaza 
settlement assets, and Sharon\'s schedule for implementation 
of the plan.  Ambassador Kurtzer pointed out there were not 
firm timelines for disengagement implementation, but there 
were mechanisms for moving the process forward.  Under the 
provisions of the April 14 Weissglas-Rice side letter, the 
Ambassador noted, he will engage with the GOI on defining 
settlement construction lines.  The Ambassador told Kalugin 
that World Bank President Wolfenson has begun preliminary 
discussions with the GOI on possible international 
organization trusteeship mechanisms for settlement assets. 
During the course of the discussion, Kalugin and Tarasov also 
expressed an interest in better understanding the GOI\'s plans 
for the Philadelphi corridor and the situations under which 
the GOI would return to Gaza as a matter of \"active self 
defense.\" 
 
3.  (C) Kalugin, noting that Nabil Sha\'ath, during an April 
16 visit to Moscow, was both \"critical\" of and \"disappointed\" 
in President Bush\'s April 14 announcement, said that Russia 
will continue to try to find positive elements to stress in 
its dialog with the parties.  Kalugin said he expects to see 
Abu Ala\'a sometime during the week of April 26 and said that 
Giora Eiland is expected in Moscow that same week to explain 
elements of Sharon\'s Disengagement Plan.  Ambassador Kurtzer 
urged Kalugin to focus Abu Ala\'a on the positive results that 
disengagement could bring to Palestinians in Gaza and 
encourage Abu Ala\'a to develop pragmatic plans now for that 
eventuality.

Jerusalem Post quoted senior Israeli diplomatic 
officials as saying that the U.S. is \"watering down\" 
assurances President Bush gave PM Sharon, less than a 
week after the two met in Washington.  The newspaper 
quoted the officials as saying that as a result of 
pressure on Washington from the Arab world and Europe, 
Secretary of State Colin Powell has played down Bush\'s 
 
SIPDIS 
ideas about the shape of the final-status deal. 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio quoted Bush as saying 
Wednesday, in a speech to the Newspaper Association of 
America Annual Convention, that a \"free Palestinian 
state would be a major change agent for world peace.\" 
Bush remarked that \"the whole world should have said, 
thank you Ariel,\" for the withdrawal plan.  Bush added: 
\"The Palestinian leadership has failed the people year 
after year after year.\" 
Israel Radio quoted Sharon as saying this morning 
before the Knesset plenum that Bush told him that he 
completely supports the disengagement plan.  Sharon was 
also quoted as saying that the U.S. backing of Israeli 
disengagement is \"unprecedented,\" that whoever wants to 
hold on to settlement blocs -- an achievement reached 
during his visit to Washington -- must back a pullout, 
and that he will bring his plan for approval to the 
Knesset after the cabinet ratifies it.  Sharon said 
that the negative Palestinian response was a 
confirmation of the validity of his move.  The radio 
noted that in his remarks Sharon hinted that he does 
not consider the Likud referendum as binding.  Labor 
Party Chairman Shimon Peres said that his faction -- 
preferably not as a coalition member -- would support 
the plan. 
 
The media reported that Wednesday in the northern Gaza 
Strip, a total of nine Palestinians were killed in 
clashes with the IDF and that at least 40 were wounded. 
This morning reported that three armed senior Tanzim 
militants were killed near Tulkarm, West Bank.  Israel 
Radio reported that last night PA Chairman Yasser 
Arafat, as Israel was about to attack his Ramallah HQ 
(according to his aides), expelled 21 Al Aqsa Martyrs 
Brigades activists who had been hiding there for the 
past two months. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Hatzofe reported that Sharon associates 
are urging him to cancel the Likud referendum on his 
withdrawal plan, since its results are foreknown. 
Ha\'aretz quoted opponents of the plan in the party as 
saying that those attempts are actually due to the 
decline in the party members\' support for the plan. 
 
Israel Radio quoted Ambassador J. Cofer Black, the 
State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism, as 
saying, in a testimony before a Senate subcommittee, 
that the assassination of the Hamas leaders has 
disrupted the group\'s activity and greatly influenced 
Palestinian society.  He was also quoted as saying that 
it is too early to say whether the assassinations will 
influence Hamas\'s ability to strike at Israel. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Palestinian PM Ahmed Qurei 
(Abu Ala) called on Bush to retract his declaration 
that, in a final-status agreement, Israel will not have 
to withdraw from the entire West Bank and that it will 
not have to take in Palestinian refugees. 
 
All media continued to highlight the release of nuclear 
whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu.  (Both Yediot and 
Maariv devoted their first 11 pages to the topic.) 
 
All media reported that, at a press conference in Tel 
Aviv Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Dan Kurtzer and U.S. 
Consul-General in Tel Aviv Phil Covington announced 
that the Embassy will ease visa restrictions for 
Israelis born in countries classified as sponsors of 
terror, including Iran, Syria, Libya, Sudan, North 
Korea and Cuba.  Ha\'aretz quoted Kurtzer as saying: \"We 
in the Embassy have been working with Washington for 
almost two and a half years to see this change.\"  The 
media quoted Covington as saying that the changes do 
not apply only to Israelis, but that they were made 
primarily out of concern for Israeli travelers who left 
their birthplace at least 50 years ago. 
 
Yediot reported that in June El Al is to fit its first 
plane with a protection system against shoulder- 
launched missiles.  The system was developed by Israel 
Aircraft Industries (IAI) and Israel Military 
Industries. 
 
Citing AP, Ha\'aretz reported that the UN Relief and 
Works Agency (UNRWA) announced that it would renew 
shipments to the Gaza Strip after reaching an 
arrangement with Israeli security. 
 
Israel Radio reported that, at the request of Arafat, 
Malaysia is convening a meeting of the Islamic 
Organization Conference (IOC) to discuss the United 
States\' support for Israel and its policy in Iraq.  The 
radio notes that only one third of the member states 
have sent delegates -- most of them under ministerial 
level -- to the meeting. 
 
All media reported that UEFA, European soccer\'s 
governing body, lifted its ban on playing international 
games in Israel, saying it is satisfied with the 
country\'s security arrangements. 
All media reported that Wednesday four people were 
wounded in the bombing of the old Saudi General 
Security building housing offices of the Interior 
Ministry in Riyadh.  Ha\'aretz noted that Deputy 
Secretary of State Richard Armitage was in Riyadh for 
 
SIPDIS 
talks Wednesday. 
 
A Dialogue poll for Ha\'aretz (also cited in Maariv and 
Yediot) found that the gap between supporters and 
opponents of Sharon\'s disengagement plan in the Likud 
is narrowing: 44 percent support it, while 40 percent 
are opposed; 11 percent are undecided.  Maariv and 
Yediot say that internal Likud polls and other surveys 
confirm the trend.

Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 22): \"The 
United States appointed itself in the past year as the 
governess of the Palestinians and the guardian of their 
rights, as the custodian of a future Palestinian state. 
The same Bush who is considered an enthusiastic 
supporter of Sharon, who backs every assassination and 
every Israeli military action in the territories, has 
quietly created an American \"trusteeship\" for the 
Palestinians.  Bush was the first president to call for 
the establishment of a Palestinian state, and he is 
trying to fill his words with substance.... There are 
several expressions of this American trusteeship, which 
were mentioned in Bush\'s letter to Sharon and in 
accompanying documents.  The most important of them is 
the preservation of reserves of land for a Palestinian 
state in the West Bank, which will enjoy reasonable 
territorial contiguity.... [For his part,] Sharon has 
evaded most of his promises until now.... This is an 
election year in the United States, and it\'s a

Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer

that Hamas has become such a central element in the 
Gaza Strip, because of the two most recent 
assassinations, we must not allow ourselves to be 
fooled by our own illusions, such as the ones about 
Muhammad Dahlan, that have cropped up among the 
dreamers of Oslo.  Dahlan is Arafat, and neither of 
them have any reason to make Israel\'s life easier.  And 
the Hamas leaders will not suddenly become lovers of 
Zion and reduce the volume of terrorism.  We still have 
a paramount interest to disengage from Gaza, but to 
disengage for real.  To wit, to seal the crossings 
between Israel and the Gaza Strip for good, to stop 
supplying electricity and water, and to evacuate in 
tandem the Philadelphi road that runs between the Gaza 
Strip and Egypt.  Let their Arab brethren take care of 
the Palestinians.  Only Egypt, when it bears sole 
responsibility for the only exit from the Gaza to the 
world, will know how to cope with Hamas.  If weapons 
are smuggled into the Gaza Strip after that, there will 
be no doubt as to who is responsible for it and where 
that responsible party is.\"

Classified By: Pol/C Norm Olsen for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Immediately upon his April 21 
release from prison, \"nuclear spy\" Mordechai Vanunu charged 
that the woman who lured him into a Mossad trap in 1986 
worked for the CIA or FBI.  Nevertheless, Vanunu told the 
press that he would like to emigrate to the U.S.  The head of 
the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, Gideon Frank, defended 
the GOI\'s restrictions on Vanunu\'s liberty in an April 20 
discussion with visiting U/S Bolton, charging that Vanunu is 
out to \"destroy\" the Dimona nuclear facility.  In an earlier 
discussion with the Ambassador, however, Frank\'s deputy 
accused the head of the MOD internal security service of 
acting like a Communist security apparatchik in his campaign 
against Vanunu.  Recent articles have maintained that the 
security establishment is motivated by a desire to conceal 
its own bumbling in failing to prevent the original Vanunu 
leaks, although an Israeli journalist speculated that 
Vanunu\'s lawyers were peddling this story.  In placing 
onerous restrictions on Vanunu\'s liberty, the GOI appears to 
be elevating Vanunu\'s international cult status rather than 
protecting its nuclear program or national security.  END 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
----------------------------- 
Vanunu Drags the U.S. Into It 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Mordechai Vanunu, the former low-level technician at 
Israel\'s Dimona reactor who revealed details of Israel\'s 
nuclear program to the Sunday Times of London in 1986, 
claimed, upon his April 21 release from 18 years in prison, 
that the woman who lured him into a Mossad kidnapping trap in 
Rome in 1986 was an agent of the CIA or FBI, not the Mossad. 
Nevertheless, he told Israel Radio -- in English, because he 
is refusing to speak Hebrew -- that he would like to emigrate 
to the United States, marry, and study and teach history. 
Leaving little doubt that he intended to remain a nuisance 
for the GOI, Vanunu told a crowd of supporters, opponents and 
journalists outside the gates of the Shikma prison in 
Ashkelon that he had been mistreated in prison because of his 
conversion to Christianity.  He also called for opening 
Dimona to international inspections. 
 
3. (U) Vanunu\'s hope to leave Israel will be blocked, at 
least for now, by a GOI decision to deny Vanunu a passport. 
Vanunu has also been barred from communicating with 
foreigners, entering embassies, approaching an airport or 
other point of international egress, or talking with anyone 
about his experiences at Dimona.  He will not be allowed to 
leave the city in which he chooses to live, reportedly the 
Jaffa section of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, without authorization. 
Vanunu reportedly intends to challenge these restrictions in 
court. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Top Nuclear Bureaucrats Split on Handling Vanunu 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4. (C) In an April 20 discussion with visiting Under 
Secretary John Bolton, the head of the Israel Atomic Energy 
 
SIPDIS 
Commission, Gideon Frank, defended the restrictions on 
Vanunu, while acknowledging that they may prove 
unenforceable.  Frank charged that Vanunu \"acted like a spy\" 
during his last months as an employee at Dimona and that he 
clearly still intended to \"destroy Dimona.\"  Frank noted that 
Vanunu, as a low-level technician, had not had access to a 
lot of sensitive information about Dimona, but worried that 
Vanunu would simply invent and spread lies.  Moreover, Frank 
added, not all the information that Vanunu leaked to the 
Times had made it into print. 
 
5. (C) Frank\'s deputy, Eli Levite, expressed a very different 
view of the GOI restrictions on Vanunu in a March 3 
conversation with the Ambassador.  He said that Yehiel Horev, 
the head of the MOD internal security department (MALMAB), 
whose responsibilities include Dimona, was the driving force 
behind the GOI campaign to restrict Vanunu\'s liberty and had 
argued for keeping Vanunu in administrative or home 
detention.  Noting that Horev had held the same position 
since the period of the Vanunu leaks, Levite commented that 
Horev had come to resemble \"those who held similar positions 
for 18 years in former Communist countries.\"  Israel is a 
democracy, Levite said, and should therefore leave Vanunu 
alone now that he has paid his debt to society. 
 
--------------------- 
Security Service CYA? 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) Recent articles in Ha\'aretz and Yedioth Ahronoth 
suggested that Horev and other members of the GOI security 
establishment sought to restrict Vanunu in order to prevent 
revelation of their lapses in not stopping Vanunu before he 
leaked to the Times.  In a discussion with emboffs, an 
Israeli journalist not involved in either of the reports cast 
doubts on this version of events.  The fact that two 
newspapers ran the story suggested, he said, that Vanunu\'s 
lawyers had been peddling the story. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT: The GOI is only contributing to the 
international cult around Vanunu in its continuing campaign 
against him.  Vanunu\'s revelations in 1986 did nothing to set 
back Israel\'s nuclear program, and we have difficulty 
imagining that anything he says or does today could harm the 
program or otherwise damage Israeli national security.  As 
Ha\'aretz defense commentator Reuven Pedatzur wrote, Vanunu is 
\"a strange man with strange ideas who committed a very 
serious crime for which he was tried and imprisoned for a 
lengthy period....  Leave Vanunu alone.  Simply ignore him. 
Don\'t turn him into a cultural hero.\"

1.  (C) With an April 21 poll showing only 
44-percent-to-40-percent Likud majority support for his 
disengagement plan, down from a week ago, an energized PM 
Sharon told a special Knesset session on April 22 that USG 
assurances on right of return and retention of settlements 
are tied to fulfillment of the withdrawal and will be lost if 
the plan is rejected.  Sharon\'s strong statement indicates 
that he is mobilizing to counter a well organized withdrawal 
opposition movement and a lead that has shrunk from last 
week\'s 57/37 percent and 54/37 percent poll support margins. 
The so-far lethargic support of key Likud ministers for 
disengagement, coupled with the all-out PR campaign of the 
opposition, could be contributing to a closer gap in the 
polls.  With 10 days left before the referendum, Sharon will 
undoubtedly mobilize further, graphically painting the 
consequences of failure, to ensure a May 2 victory for his 
plan.   End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Ha\'aretz Poll Could be Wake-Up Call for Sharon 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2.  (C) Speaking before a special Knesset plenary on April 
22, PM Sharon asserted that without his disengagement plan, 
Israel would lose all of the April 14 assurances that 
President Bush made to PM Sharon in return for withdrawing 
from Gaza and four West Bank settlements.  Sharon spoke the 
same day that Ha\'aretz published April 21 poll results 
showing that 44 percent of Likud members favor the PM\'s 
disengagement plan in the May 2 referendum while 40 percent 
said they oppose it.  Those numbers shift to 47 percent and 
40 percent, respectively, among those Likud members who say 
they will actually vote.  The results come only a week after 
two other media polls showed  57/37 percent and 54/32 percent 
support margins (ref C).  Asked about the drop in poll 
numbers over a single week, pollster Hannoch Smith told 
poloff on April 22 that his company was commissioned to 
conduct private polls for Likud and that, based on polls it 
had conducted among Likud voters, the Ha\'aretz poll \"makes 
sense.\"  He noted that among the broader population, however, 
the disengagement plan is supported two to one. 
 
3.  (C) Neither the USG assurances on Palestinian refugees or 
Israeli retention of settlement blocs, nor initial statements 
of support from FinMin Benyamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister 
Silvan Shalom and Education Minister Limor Livnat -- none of 
whom Sharon has yet to put on the campaign trail -- seem to 
have yet added any Likud support.  Observers say Likud voters 
may question the motives of these ministers in supporting the 
plan, concluding that Netanyahu, Shalom, and Livnat have 
changed their positions not because they are convinced of the 
plan\'s value, but for purely personal political reasons.  FM 
Shalom, for example, presumably would not want to give Sharon 
reason to hand over his ministerial position to Labor leader 
Peres in a cabinet reshuffle. 
 
------------------- 
A Lonely Bandwagon 
------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who can only 
muster a small support base among Likud voters, is the only 
key Likud minister so far hitting the referendum campaign 
trail -- literally.  Olmert launched the pro-disengagement 
campaign on April 21 when he boarded the \"disengagement bus\" 
that will travel the country to rally Likud voters behind the 
plan.  Olmert reportedly complained that same day about being 
the only Likud minister, out of nine others who support the 
plan, to take an active role in the campaign, telling the 
Jerusalem Post that \"there\'s plenty of room on the bus and 
you never know, at any point a minister could get on.  I have 
reserved places for each of them.\" 
 
5.  (C) Observers and partisans alike are spinning 
developments and positions -- from rumors cited by political 
consultant Yossi Olmert, D/PM Olmert\'s brother, that 
Netanyahu, Livnat and Shalom may quietly be asking their 
supporters to vote against the plan, to MK Omri Sharon\'s 
threat that his father will resign if the disengagement 
initiative fails in the referendum.  (Note: Olmert dismissed 
Omri\'s threat, noting that the PM would not resign in the 
face of a referendum loss since the PM understands the 
benefits derived from his status if indicted on bribery 
charges.) 
 
-------- 
COMMENT 
-------- 
 
6.  (C) Apart from D/PM Olmert\'s bus tour, a comforting 
security-related endorsement by DefMin Mofaz, and Omri\'s 
efforts, PM Sharon had not until today mounted an all-out 
campaign to win the April 2 Likud referendum.  With his 
Knesset speech, he has now staked out for both Likud rank and 
file -- and for the so-far demure Netanyahu, Livnat and 
Shalom -- his claim to the great issues of the nation, 
delivering the \"great achievement... to prevent the flooding 
of Israel with refugees, to preserve the large Israeli 
settlement blocs under our eternal rule.... (and win) the 
broad U.S. commitment to Israel\'s right to defend itself.\" 
With polls as they are 10 days before the referendum and with 
President Bush\'s assurances in his pocket, Sharon will 
continue to paint the referendum vote as determining the fate 
of the nation, and by doing so, seek to dragoon into the 
active campaign ranks the supportive but still lethargic 
Likud party leaders -- and their constituencies -- necessary 
to win the day.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KWBG, IS, GAZA DISENGAGEMENT, GOI INTERNAL, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS 
SUBJECT: KEY MINISTERS AND WEISSGLAS REVIEW POTUS-SHARON 
UNDERSTANDINGS, DISENGAGEMENT POLITICS, IMPLEMENTATION AND 
AFTERMATH 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: In April 20 meetings with U/S Bolton and the 
Ambassador, Olmert and Weissglas said there is still a chance 
to keep the GOI coalition together, even if disengagement 
moves forward.  However, Minister Lieberman, leader of one of 
the right-wing parties that is expected to bolt, told the 
Ambassador that there was no chance he would stay once the 
Cabinet approves disengagement.  Sharansky, a Likud opponent 
of disengagement, hinted that he probably would not resign. 
Weissglas described the President\'s April 14 statements with 
Sharon as a shock to the Palestinian Authority, and thereby a 
potential spur to PA reform.  He asserted that success in 
maintaining order in Gaza after Israeli withdrawal would have 
a major impact on Israeli public views about West Bank 
disengagement.  Disengagement opponent Sharansky lauded the 
President\'s letter to Sharon, and asserted that the GOI would 
introduce it, along with a similarly favorable 1976 letter 
from President Ford, in final status talks.  Olmert claimed 
that Sharon\'s April 18 statement tying Gaza withdrawal to 
completion of the West Bank fence was carefully worded to 
allow wiggle room.  Weissglas said the withdrawal process 
could take up to 18 months if the settlers resisted, but 
recent settler expressions of interest in compensation 
indicated that withdrawal would move more quickly.  He said 
Sharon is examining whether the settlers can receive advance 
payments; this would allow departures to begin within \"a few 
months.\"  Weissglas lauded Egyptian cooperation, and Olmert 
lauded PM Blair, although he said he shared Sharon\'s dim view 
of a UK security role with the Palestinians.  Netanyahu 
emphasized the importance of Gaza economic development, his 
best ideas for which were the planned Aqaba to Ashdod \"land 
bridge\" and the employment of Gazans in \"huge entertainment 
centers\" outside Gaza.  He said he had not yet given thought 
to integrating Gaza settlers into the Israeli economy, but 
thought it would \"probably\" be a problem. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Visting Under Secretary John Bolton and the Ambassador 
discussed Gaza disengagement in April 20 meetings with Likud 
ministers Olmert, Netanyahu, and Sharansky, and with PM Chief 
of Staff Weissglas.  The Ambassador discussed the same topic 
in a separate April 20 meeting with Transportation Minister 
Lieberman of the National Union (NU). 
 
---------------- 
Coalition Future 
---------------- 
 
3. (C) Rejecting the conventional wisdom that the GOI\'s two 
right-wing coalition members, the National Religious Party 
(NRP) and NU, will inevitably quit the government over Prime 
Minister Sharon\'s Gaza withdrawal plan if it goes forward, 
Olmert, the leading proponent of disengagement within Likud, 
said he hoped the coalition would stay together, and believed 
it could.  The coalition, he said, would need the two 
pro-settler parties to help manage national emotions once the 
wrenching process of settlement dismantlement begins.  Their 
departure from the coalition would also create a potentially 
difficult interim period between coalitions because Sharon 
would not have a majority behind him in the Knesset.  Olmert 
believed NRP and NU could stay in the coalition and save face 
by arguing that their departure would not stop Gaza 
disengagement in any case, but that it would lead to a new 
coalition featuring both Shimon Peres and Shinui. 
 
4. (C) Weissglas likewise held out hope that NRP and NU could 
choose to stay in the coalition, claiming that the two 
parties\' determination had been wavering in recent days. 
Their \"red lines,\" he commented, had not stayed fixed, moving 
from the PM\'s commitment to the disengagement policy, to a 
Cabinet vote in favor, to actual steps on the ground. 
Netanyahu, while also expressing the hope that NRP and NU 
would remain in the coalition, thought it unlikely.  He 
lamented the impact of a possible change of coalition on his 
economic program, commenting that \"Likud, Shinui and 
Lieberman\" had an agreement to move quickly on free-market 
reforms. 
 
5. (C) Lieberman categorically rejected any possibility that 
he would stay in the coalition after the Cabinet approves the 
disengagement plan.  The Ambassador pressed Lieberman on 
whether he did not see any advantages to staying in the 
coalition.  Lieberman replied that one does not have a choice 
in certain decisions.  Asking him to stay in the coalition 
after it approves settlement removals would, he said, be like 
\"asking a religious man to eat pork.\"  Sharansky, another 
disengagement opponent, said he could not imagine how the 
coalition would hold together after Sharon\'s plan moves 
forward.  The Ambassador asked Sharansky whether he, 
personally, would stay in the coalition if disengagement 
prevails.  Sharansky hinted that he would probably stay in, 
calling resignation a \"more symbolic than practical\" gesture, 
and commenting that his decision would hinge on whether he 
would have more influence inside or outside the Cabinet. 
----------------------------- 
Impact of Bush-Sharon Meeting 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Weissglas described the results of the April 14 
Bush-Sharon summit as an important source of much-needed 
leverage with the Palestinians.  Experience over the past two 
years, he argued, has demonstrated that few means of pressure 
are available to use on the Palestinians.  Economic pressure 
has little value on a population that is already very poor. 
Changes that one might be able to help shape in Palestinian 
public opinion yield little, if any, political action by the 
leadership.  Israel\'s ability to apply military pressure is 
constrained by diplomatic and humanitarian concerns. 
 
7. (C) The April 14 message out of Washington, however, very 
much shook Palestinian leaders, in Weissglas\' view.  For the 
first time, these leaders confronted the possibility that 
outsiders would make decisions for them.  This new source of 
pressure might lead to internal change in the PA.  If all 
goes according to plan, Palestinians will find themselves in 
control of Gaza sometime next year.  How they handle this 
responsibility could prove to be an \"extremely constructive 
pilot\" project, with ramifications for the future of the West 
Bank.  The maintenance of peace and order in Gaza would have 
a big impact on Israeli public opinion.  Weissglas, however, 
was uncertain whether the Palestinians were up to the 
challege, commenting that an \"outdated Palestinian mentality\" 
left the Palestinians inclined to complain, rather than take 
charge of their own problems. 
 
8. (C) Sharansky, while reaffirming his opposition to 
disengagement, lauded Sharon for the letter he received from 
President Bush.  He noted that President Ford had written a 
letter in 1976 that was similarly positive to Israeli 
positions.  Saying he did not want to sound too cynical, 
Sharansky said that the GOI would try to use both letters to 
its benefit in final status negotiations.  In any event, 
Sharansky said, he did not see that the \"dramatic and 
difficult\" steps involved in disengagement would advance the 
peace process, although he said he hoped that he was wrong. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Understandings with Bibi about the Fence 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Netanyahu\'s decision after the Washington summit to 
endorse Sharon\'s disengagement plan came up in the meeting 
with Olmert, although not in the meeting with Netanyahu, 
himself.  Olmert asserted that Netanyahu had not wanted to 
find himself isolated in opposition to the plan after the 
April 17 Rantisi assassination.  The PM made Netanyahu\'s 
support possible by appearing to accede to Netanyahu\'s demand 
for completion of the West Bank separation barrier to precede 
disengagement, and for the fence to take in Ariel.  In fact, 
Olmert stressed, the PM\'s statement linking fence issues to 
disengagement had been carefully worded.  Sharon, according 
to Olmert, said that \"we\'ll make an effort\" to complete the 
fence before disengagement begins, and that the route of the 
fence would be \"in accord with the GOI decision\" about the 
route, i.e, that there is no change in status quo plans for 
the route. 
 
----------------------- 
Disengagement Timetable 
----------------------- 
 
10. (C) Weissglas said Sharon\'s disengagement plan originated 
with the realization that the near future held no prospects 
for a final status agreement.  The plan seeks to \"rearrange 
space\" and security provisions, and undo the deadlock between 
the parties.  The plan might not follow the terms of the 
roadmap, but it makes progress in the right direction. 
Disengagement also dispels Palestinian doubts about the 
willingness of Israel ever to make territorial concessions. 
 
11. (C) Asked about the timeline for withdrawal from Gaza, 
Weissglas described two scenarios.  If the settlers resist 
leaving their homes, the process could take 18 months. 
(Comment: Weissglas apparently meant 18 months from the 
beginning of actual departure/removal of settlers.)  The 
process would go much more quickly, he said, if a significant 
number of settlers cooperate.  Signs so far indicate that 
cooperation is likely.  A number of attorneys, some of whom 
represent entire settlements, have already inquired about 
compensation.  Weissglas said Sharon had asked the Ministry 
of Justice on April 19 to advise whether advance payments to 
settlers would be possible.  If so, some settlers could begin 
moving out of Gaza within \"the next few months.\" 
 
----------------- 
Role of Outsiders 
----------------- 
 
12. (C) Weissglas presented a potentially rosy portrait of 
Gaza after Israeli withdrawal.  The agro-industrial 
facilities that settlers will leave behind could produce 
three times the food requirements of Gaza City.  Egyptian 
intelligence chief Omar Suleyman had claimed that Egyptian 
assistance could help turn Gaza into a new Singapore. 
Weissglas lauded Egyptian cooperation overall on 
disengagement, commenting that the prospect of Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza had forced the GOE \"to leave its 
armchair.\"  He hoped that Jordan would be similarly helpful 
on West Bank disengagement.  While West Bank settlement 
removals envisaged in current plans are only \"symbolic,\" the 
GOI, he claimed, has plans for \"deeper\" removals in 
subsequent stages. 
 
13. (C) In response to Bolton\'s question about European 
reaction to the President\'s statements of April 14, Olmert 
said that PM Blair had been very helpful.  The reactions of 
other Europeans would depend on the evolution of events, 
although they wanted to be helpful.  Olmert thought that the 
Europeans could help foster a \"less loaded atmosphere\" in 
Gaza, and pointed to the work the UK is doing with Dahlan. 
The Ambassador pointed out that Sharon had told the President 
that he objected to the UK role.  The Ambassador urged the 
GOI to \"think strategically\" by leaving room for a 
constructive European role in Gaza that goes beyond economic 
development.  Olmert commented that he does not see things 
exactly as Sharon does and would like to give the Europeans a 
greater role, although he said that he, too, disapproved of 
the UK role in security. 
 
14. (C) Olmert asked the Ambassador for his vision of 
European involvement, noting that he had difficulty 
envisaging a meaningful role for France or the Scandinavians. 
 Some German officials, such as FM Fischer, are, on the other 
hand, friendlier to Israel.  The Ambassador responded by 
pointing to the message the President delivered to Sharon the 
previous week.  The President indicated that he saw 
disengagement leading to his two-state vision, and that he 
hoped to see the Palestinian economy develop.  Assisting on 
this side could be a good role for the Europeans.  The 
Ambassador commented that the U.S. and Israel need to do some 
strategic thinking together about this question. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Economic Future after Disengagement 
----------------------------------- 
 
15. (C) Netanyahu predicted that the actual process of 
withdrawal from settlements would be a \"convulsion,\" the 
impact of which is unclear.  The process should thus not go 
too fast.  The GOI is already taking important steps to 
create a better post-disengagement reality in Gaza by 
\"cutting Hamas down to size.\"  He underlined the need to 
begin economic projects in Gaza.  The Ambassador asked 
whether the GOI had formed any kind of working group to 
examine the question.  Without answering directly, Netanyahu 
said the greatest contribution would come from a \"land 
bridge\" project linking the ports of Aqaba and Ashdod.  The 
Palestinians would get docks at Ashdod and thereby be able to 
exploit export opportunities to Europe. 
 
16. (C) The Ambassador pressed Netanyahu about plans that 
would lead to job creation in Gaza.  Positing that Gaza\'s 
comparative economic advantages lie in low labor costs and 
agriculture, Netanyahu said consideration should be given to 
new labor-intensive industries, notably tourism.  The 
creation of \"huge entertainment centers\" would create many 
jobs.  These centers could be \"next door\" to Gaza, as 
security considerations and the absence of rule of law would 
deter outsiders from investing in Gaza, itself.  Bolton asked 
whether the GOI foresaw problems integrating Gaza settlers 
into the national economy.  Netanyahu replied that he had not 
yet given the question any thought, but thought it would 
\"probably\" be a problem. 
 
17. (U) U/S Bolton did not have an opportunity to review this 
message.

EMBASSY ATTACK 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/C Norm Olsen, per 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
This is a joint cable from ConGen Jerusalem and Embassy Tel 
Aviv. 
 
1.  (U) Palestinian militants from the Popular Resistance 
Committee (PRC) staged a prison break at the civil jail in 
Gaza City April 21, freeing several suspects held in 
connection with the October 15 attack on an embassy convoy 
that killed three Americans, according to a statement issued 
by the PRC April 22.  The statement claimed that the PRC had 
successfully freed three of the four suspects; the fourth 
prisoner could not be freed, the statement continued, as he 
was being held in a secluded cell elsewhere in the building. 
The PRC in its statement justified the action by claiming 
that a Palestinian court had ordered the four men released 
over a month ago, and that the four were being unlawfully 
held in jail. 
Descriptions of the break varied from non-violent to a gun 
battle. 
 
2.  (S) The ConGen contacted Minister of Interior Hakam 
Bal\'awi April 22 for clarification.  An assistant said that 
the MOI would provide a full report once it had investigated 
the incident.  (Note: ORCA has reported separately on this 
incident April 22). 
 
3.  (C) Palestinian newspapers carried conflicting reports on 
the details of the jail break, and rumors about the incident 
abound, with some claiming that tens of other prisoners were 
also freed during the breakout.  Although there were reports 
of a gun battle, one source told Poloff that the escape 
happened without a shot fired -- the PRC men simply entered 
the jail, overpowered the guards (who allegedly put up little 
resistance), and freed their comrades.  In another version, 
several men entered the jail on the pretext of visiting some 
of the inmates.  Once inside the building, however, the men 
overpowered the guards, allowed a much larger group of 
militants into the jail, and freed the prisoners.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media cited PM Sharon\'s downplaying, in a speech to 
the Knesset Thursday, of the upcoming Likud referendum 
on his disengagement plan.  This morning on Israel 
Radio, Vice PM Ehud Olmert said that if the party does 
not endorse the plan, this would have \"very serious\" 
diplomatic, economic and political consequences for 
Israel.  The radio reported that the French government 
has expressed skepticism about the plan\'s chances of 
success.  Ha\'aretz reported that Minister without 
Portfolio Natan Sharansky has sent a letter to the 
19,000 Russian-language members of the Likud, calling 
on them to vote against the disengagement plan. 
Jerusalem Post quoted Herbert Zweibon, chairman of 
Americans For a Safe Israel, a U.S. Jewish organization 
fighting the two-state solution to the Israeli- 
Palestinian conflict, as saying that an Israeli 
withdrawal from the territories could lead to an anti- 
Semitic backlash among evangelical Christians who are 
today among Israel\'s strongest supporters.  Jerusalem 
Post notes that Zweibon has close ties with the 
evangelical community. 
 
Hatzofe reported that an unnamed \"senior White House 
official\" told the unlicensed right-wing Israeli radio 
station Arutz Sheva (Arutz 7) that the U.S. does not 
accept Israeli sovereignty over settlement blocs or the 
non-return of Palestinian refugees to Israel.  The 
official was quoted as saying: \"The parties will decide 
on these issues in negotiations among themselves.\" 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Farouk Kaddoumi, the PLO\'s hard- 
line \"foreign minister,\" as saying in an interview with 
the Jordanian newspaper Al-Arab, that when PA Chairman 
Yasser Arafat talks about the need to pursue the 
struggle against Israel, he is referring to the armed 
struggle.  Kaddoumi reportedly said that the armed 
struggle is the only way to accept the Palestinians\' 
demands.  He admitted in the interview that the PLO 
charter, which denies Israel\'s right to exist, was 
never changed. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Thursday the Popular 
Resistance Committees, an alliance of various armed 
Palestinian groups in the Gaza Strip, announced that 
its members managed to free three Palestinians who were 
held in a Gaza City prison on suspicion of involvement 
in the attack on a U.S. diplomatic convoy last October. 
The Committees also said that a fourth suspect was not 
freed because he is being held in solitary confinement. 
Israel Radio reported that last night in Qalqilya three 
key Fatah/Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades activists were 
killed in a clash with IDF forces.  The media also 
reported that two Palestinian girls aged 4 and 7 were 
killed in the Gaza Strip. 
Maariv reported that Survey of Israel, the GOI\'s 
official mapmaker, has recently printed an updated 
edition of Israel\'s maps, which includes the separation 
fence.  Ha\'aretz (English Ed.) reported that last 
Thursday, American-born Rabbi Arik W. Ascherman, 
executive director of Rabbis for Human Rights (RHR), 
was arrested while demonstrating against the route of 
the fence.  Ascherman is awaiting his day in court in 
connection with other charges related to his struggle 
for human rights. 
 
Israel Radio quoted Lakhdar Brahimi, the special UN 
envoy to Iraq, as saying on a French radio station that 
Israel is the \"biggest poison\" in the region.  Brahimi 
also reportedly blasted the U.S. support for Israel. 
Israel Radio quoted Fred Eckhardt, Spokesman to UN 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, as saying that Brahimi\'s 
 
SIPDIS 
remarks do not represent Annan\'s views. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Nigel Roberts, director of the World 
Bank office in the West Bank and Gaza, as saying: \"We 
are ready to play a constructive role in the 
disengagement process if we are asked to do so by all 
the key parties -- Israel, the PA and the international 
community.\"  Roberts was referring to reports that the 
Bank had already agreed to buy the Gaza Strip 
settlements, or that it had already taken practical 
steps to that effect.   Jerusalem Post quoted a \"high- 
level World Bank official\" as saying Wednesday that the 
bank will not purchase or become temporary custodians 
of Israel assets in the Gaza Strip after an Israeli 
withdrawal, and that it is more likely to play an 
economic advisory role, helping the Palestinians manage 
and productively use the evacuated property. 
 
Leading media reported that Nabil George Razouk, the 
Israeli Arab from East Jerusalem who was abducted in 
Iraq on April 8, was freed Thursday by his captors. 
The media reported that the PA representative in Iraq 
was instrumental in securing his release. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that one of the two Israelis detained 
in New Zealand was carrying a forged Canadian passport. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited a recently declassified CIA document, 
according to which in January 1975 then U.S. President 
Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger were 
concerned that the U.S. could be made to intervene if 
the USSR had militarily backed a Syrian attack on 
Israel. 
 
All media highlighted reports that former energy 
minister Gonen Segev has been remanded into police 
custody as a suspect in an alleged international 
Ecstasy drug smuggling scheme that Israeli and Dutch 
police say involve millions of shekels (one shekel 
roughly equals USD 0.22).  Segev reportedly used a 
forged diplomatic passport.  Segev, who was number two 
in the defunct right-wing party Tzomet, joined the late 
PM Yitzhak Rabin\'s cabinet in the mid \'90s. 
 
A Yediot poll conducted by Mina Zemach\'s Dahaf 
Institute found that 49 percent of registered Likud 
voters will vote for Sharon\'s plan; 39.5 percent are 
opposed; 11.5 percent are undecided. 
 
A Maariv/Teleseker poll found that: 
-Had it depended on them, 63 percent of Israelis would 
have favored a national referendum to decide on the 
issue of the disengagement plan; 5 percent would have 
preferred a referendum within the Likud; 25 percent 
favor a \"different way.\" 
-41 percent prefer an evacuation of the Gaza Strip that 
would be coordinated with the Palestinians; 34 percent 
favor a unilateral withdrawal; 18 percent oppose a 
withdrawal altogether. 
-54 percent believe that the houses in the settlements 
to be vacated should be pulled down; 36 percent favor 
leaving them to the Palestinians. 
-76 percent of Israelis say that Israel was right in 
assassinating Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi.

I.  \"Speed Up the Evacuation\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (April 
23): \"Regardless of where the weight of the votes in 
Sharon\'s party falls, he has harnessed, in the 
diplomatic arena and within the government, significant 
support for a withdrawal.  U.S. President George Bush 
was the first to back it and so have major leaders in 
Europe.  All the central ministers of the Likud, who 
are also candidates for Sharon\'s seat after he retires, 
have abandoned their doubts by announcing their support 
for the plan and established an undeniable political 
fait accompli.... Sharon has voiced two main arguments 
in favor of the plan, which he himself had opposed 
until recently.  The first argument is security-based: 
shortening the lines of defense and eliminating soft 
targets (settlements, military units and the movement 
of soldiers and civilians along roads in the Gaza 
Strip) so that the fighting, which is expected to 
continue both along Gaza\'s borders (attempts to carry 
out attacks and launch rockets) and in the West Bank. 
The second argument is diplomatic: in the absence of an 
Israeli initiative enjoying American support, Israel 
will be forced to fend off initiatives less palatable 
to the Likud and Sharon government.  Precisely because 
of these arguments, the evacuation should not be 
delayed.  The plans for compensation for the evacuated 
settlers can be approved quickly by the various 
ministries and the Knesset.  Sharon owes the citizens 
of Israel the opposite of what he willingly grants 
[Finance Minister Binyamin] Netanyahu: an accelerated, 
and not sluggish, evacuation.\" 
 
II.  \"The Generals\' Confusion\" 
 
Extreme right-wing columnist Caroline B. Glick wrote on 
page one of conservative, independent Jerusalem Post 
(April 23): \"The [Israeli] press has paid minimal 
attention to the fact that, in the days since Sharon\'s 
meeting with Bush, Bush and his people have repeatedly 
denied a shift in U.S. policy away from the 
Palestinians and toward Israel.  If our media was not 
firmly backing Sharon\'s plan, this would not be the 
case.  After all, the entire rationale of moving ahead 
with Sharon\'s plan is that Sharon has claimed that the 
U.S. has given Israel something in exchange for 
implementing it.  And yet, over the past week, the U.S. 
has made quite clear that it will give Israel nothing. 
Last Friday Bush explained, \'All final status issues 
must still be negotiated between the parties.\'  What 
this means, as Colin Powell and others have been keen 
to point out, is that although Bush did state that the 
U.S. thinks it would be unrealistic to have the so- 
called Palestinian refugees overrun Israel in the 
framework of an agreement, Bush did not commit the U.S. 
to preventing it from happening.  Likewise, in spite of 
the fact that it may be unrealistic to expect that more 
than 250,000 Israelis would be driven out of their 
homes in a peace deal, it is not for the U.S. to say. 
If the media was not mobilized to support Sharon\'s 
plan, surely the fact that the U.S. gave Israel nothing 
would be given more than passing attention.\" 
 
III.  \"Borders of Realism\" 
 
Jerusalem Post editorialized (April 23): \"For the 
better part of the past 30 years, the Right and the 
Left in Israel made two curiously mirrored arguments. 
The Right understood the need for secure and defensible 
borders with all our neighbors, except the 
Palestinians.  The Left understood the need for borders 
with the Palestinians, while fantasizing about a \'New\' 
borderless Middle East, akin to the European Union.... 
On the all-important subject of borders, both sides 
were logically inconsistent.... With the Palestinians, 
the past 40-plus months of terror have convinced a 
majority of Israelis of two things.  First, that peace 
with the Palestinians is, for the time being, 
impossible; and second, that separation is necessary. 
We cannot forever rule over a people who violently 
reject that rule, however benign our intentions.  And 
we must have a border to better defend against suicide 
bombers, the only weapon in the Palestinian arsenal 
that can really bloody us.... It is ... objected that a 
border that lacks international legitimacy is no border 
at all.  But then, what was the Green Line?  What is 
the Line of Control in Kashmir?.... It may be a long 
time yet before Israel gets the borders it deserves. 
For now, the best we can hope for is to get the borders 
we can realistically defend. Fortunately, that prospect 
is no longer distant.\"

Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: 
\"Iran\'s Shihab-3 rockets have become operational, which

\"Despite Everything, an Improvement\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(April 23): \"Despite the unceasing terrorist war, it is 
now clear there has been an improvement in Israel\'s 
strategic position over the past year. The military 
deployment in the Middle East has changed in our favor, 
and certain threats that appeared grave in the past are 
gone.... That does not mean all the dangers are gone. 
It is possible that some threats, particularly in the 
realm of terror, if actualized, will surprise 
Israel.... A year ago, the assessment was that Iran 
would be near nuclear independence in 2004, but that 
timetable seems to have been postponed.... There has 
been a worsening of conditions in another military 
realm -- but it should not be considered a strategic 
threat yet. Iran\'s Shihab-3 rockets have become 
operational, which means Iran can now reach Israel and 
other distant targets in the Middle East.  Combined 
with the missile systems that Iran and Syria set up for 
Hezbollah in south Lebanon, the threat is more 
tangible.  The other side knows Israel can deal with 
that threat and set a heavy price for the enemy if the 
situation worsens.\"

Op-ed writer Rafi Mann observed in popular, pluralist 
Maariv: \"As long as the president of the U.S. decides, 
for strategic, political or other reasons, to adhere to 
his country\'s commitment to Israel\'s security, the 
Americans are prepared to turn a blind eye to the 
doings on the underground floors of the Dimona-2 
institute.\"

\"Bush\'s Bomb\" 
 
Op-ed writer Rafi Mann observed in popular, pluralist 
Maariv (April 23): \"Israel\'s security has been a 
recurrent motive in a long series of statements by Bush 
in recent years.... Like in almost every domain -- from 
economic assistance to the peace process -- [Israel] 
has one address: Washington.  More precisely: 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue.  As long as the president of the 
U.S. decides, for strategic, political or other 
reasons, to adhere to his country\'s commitment to 
Israel\'s security, the Americans are prepared to turn a 
blind eye to the doings on the underground floors of 
the Dimona-2 institute.... When could the pattern of 
that relationship blow up and cause serious harm to 
Israel?  Only when something very basic goes wrong in 
U.S.-Israeli relations -- if, for instance a U.S. 
president is someday elected and wishes to shake off 
the \'special relationship\' between the two countries, 
or if Israel makes policy that Washington would view as 
a clear danger to its interests.  To this day, even the 
most skeptical observers can only point to a tightening 
and deepening of ties, not to the opposite.  Meanwhile, 
Vanunu had better stop blabbing, but it is doubtful 
whether that eccentric guy actually represents a 
strategic threat.... The Iranian bomb worries Bush much 
more.\"

SUBJECT: EREZ INDUSTRIAL ESTATE: DAYS MAY BE LIMITED 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer, Reasons 1.4 (B) & (D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  On April 21, the Israeli daily Haaretz 
reported that the IDF may close the Erez Industrial Estate 
(EIE) in response to a spate of recent terror attacks at the 
zone.  GOI officials told Gaza Econoff that the GOI is split 
over whether the EIE should continue operating both in the 
short- and long-term, i.e. post-Gaza withdrawal.  However, 
our contacts believe that the zone will/will likely re-open 
after Israeli Independence Day, April 27.  Israeli and 
Palestinian investors with factories in the zone have 
received very little information to date on future plans.  A 
meeting is scheduled between the GOI and Israeli investors 
for Sunday April 26.  Palestinian investors, however, are 
completely out of the information loop.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Erez: Prime Target for Terrorists 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The Erez Industrial Estate (EIE) has been the target 
of several attacks since the beginning of the year.  On 
January 14, a female suicide bomber killed four Israelis when 
she blew herself up at the entrance to the zone.  On February 
25, two Palestinian gunmen infiltrated the zone overnight and 
opened fire on GOI buildings near the entrance to the zone 
the following morning.  One Israeli soldier was killed when 
the IDF engaged and killed the gunmen.  On April 17, a 
suicide bomber who, according to Israeli sources, had a valid 
permit to work in the zone detonated his explosives inside 
the EIE killing himself and one Israeli border guard. 
 
----------------------------- 
GOI Response: Close the EIE? 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Throughout the course of the Intifada the GOI has 
closed the EIE only rarely, this despite almost daily mortar 
shells in the area.  Following the terrorist attacks earlier 
this year, the GOI responded by closing the zone for a day or 
two only.  After the April 17 terrorist attack, however, the 
GOI instituted a prolonged closure and the zone is not 
expected to re-open until after Israeli Independence Day at 
the earliest.  On April 21, Israeli newspaper Ha,aretz 
quoted a senior IDF officer as saying,  &It is quite 
possible we will have no choice but to close the industrial 
zone.8  The same article reported that IDF Chief of Staff 
Moshe (Boogie) Ya,alon visited the EIE on April 20 and said 
that the zone would not be re-opened until a suitable way of 
protecting soldiers is found. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Working Level Says EIE Will 
Likely Re-open After Independence Day 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Lt. Colonel Isaac Gurvich, head of the Economic 
branch of the Office of the Coordinator of Government 
Activities in the Territories (COGAT), told Gaza econoff that 
notwithstanding the Haaretz report, &no decisions have been 
taken to close the zone.8  Gurvich said that the GOI was 
split with some, e.g. Ministry of Defense, advocating to 
close the EIE immediately and others, e.g. COGAT, arguing 
that it should be kept open for humanitarian/cooperation 
purposes.  Gurvich said that difficult questions were being 
posed ) &Is it justifiable to put Israeli soldiers at risk 
to preserve jobs for Palestinians?8  Gurvich noted that the 
soldiers are not guarding settlements and Israeli citizens, 
nor are they providing security for the Israeli/Gaza northern 
border, nor are they securing a significant economic asset. 
 
5.  (C) Gurvich said that if the final answer is yes, it 
makes sense to keep the zone open because it provides a 
livelihood for four to six thousand Palestinians and thus 
indirectly feeds 24,000 )36,000 individuals, then the issue 
turns on how to keep it open.  How much is a reasonable 
amount of money to invest in security upgrades?  These 
concerns were of course further complicated by the Gaza 
disengagement initiative.  Gurvich said the GOI was 
&struggling8 with two &momentums8 ) &What happens to 
the EIE after separation and what do we do about terrorist 
attacks now?8  He insisted that no final decisions had been 
reached on either of those two broad questions. 
 
6.  (C) Captain Joseph Levy, COGAT liaison for the Erez 
crossing, was firm in his belief that the EIE will re-open 
after Israeli Independence Day.  Giving the on-the-ground 
perspective, Levy said that soldiers have received no orders 
to close the zone permanently or to begin preparations for a 
closure.  Levy said, in fact, the opposite was true; soldiers 
have been instructed to review lessons learned from the April 
17 terrorist attack and to make recommendations for security 
modifications.  He said that his orders were to &find the 
way8 to allow the zone to re-open.  Levy insisted that the 
only reason why the zone remains closed is because the April 
17 bomber used a new technique of only carrying plastic 
explosives which were undetectable by the metal scanners as 
opposed to the more typical nail-embedded explosives. 
Obviously this security gap would have to be addressed but 
the closure was not indicative of a policy decision to 
abandon the estate in his view. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Business Owners in the Dark; Some Not 
Sticking Around to Wait for Answers 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Gaza Econoff called Um Hassem, a Palestinian woman 
who owns a textile factory in the zone, which exports 
clothing to Israel and the U.S., for her reaction to the 
Haaretz report of a possible permanent closure of the EIE. 
Hassem reacted with alarm and dismay and said that the GOI 
had not/not apprised Palestinian owners of any possible 
closure and that she was preparing to go back to work after 
Israeli Independence Day.  (Note:  The GOI makes very little 
differentiation between Palestinian factory owners and 
Palestinian day laborers.  They use the same entrance/exit 
gates and are subject to all other security protocols. 
Owners have very little access to information and are not 
allowed into their factories when the zone is closed.  End 
Note).  Hassem beseeched the USG to intervene to save the 
livelihoods of the business owners and the thousands of 
Palestinians who work at the EIE every day. 
 
8.  (C) Kobi Cohen, President of the Erez Association of 
factory owners and himself the owner of five textile 
factories in the zone, told Gaza econoff that factory owners 
were very distressed.  Cohen said that between April 20-22, 
fifteen Israeli owners had decided to close their businesses. 
 (Note:  Before this recent exodus, the EIE had 201 factories 
) 97 Palestinian and 104 Israeli owned. End Note.) Cohen 
said that he tried to persuade them to stay but to no avail. 
Cohen said that the GOI had not told Israeli business owners 
that Erez would close, but rather that although it would do 
its best to keep it open it could offer no guarantees. 
Security would have to be evaluated on a day-by-day basis. 
Cohen said that he and other owners of course understood the 
security rationale but they could not run businesses under 
such circumstances.  No one is able to meet their orders, he 
lamented.  Cohen admitted that he also was actively 
considering shifting his factories inside Israel, despite 
having been born in Gaza.  There is no future for Erez, he 
said.  &Things are getting worse, not better.  So we have to 
be realistic.8 
 
9.  (C) Asked about his conversations with Palestinian 
business owners as the president of the owners association, 
Cohen said that it had been limited to some telephone contact 
since the Palestinian owners are not allowed in the zone 
during closure.  Cohen opined that Palestinian owners would 
not leave barring a complete closure of the zone. 
Palestinians have few options, he said.  If they leave Erez 
they will be forced to use Karni crossing for their imports 
and exports and Karni is not sufficiently reliable to sustain 
an export business to a demanding, competitive market. 
 
10.  (C) Cohen confirmed information passed to Gaza econoff 
by Gurvich that the GOI is planning to meet with Israeli 
investors on April 26.  Gurvich said that the meeting is 
being organized by Deputy Director General, Foreign Trade 
Administration, Gabi Bar of the Ministry of Industry and 
Trade.  According to Gurvich agenda items will include issues 
relating to improving security and compensation if the GOI 
decides it must close the EIE, either now or in the future 
after disengagement. 
 
11. (C) Comment:  We assess that the EIE will re-open some 
time after April 27.  Clearly, however, its future is 
ambiguous, at best.  As we consider ways to make Gaza 
economically viable in the immediate term and 
post-withdrawal, we will need to take a close look at the 
successes and failures of existing joint Israeli/Palestinian 
industrial estates; the mechanisms for guaranteeing security 
and a predictable operating business environment; labor 
access; and control over access to inputs and outputs, 
without which any business will fail.

Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer, Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
THIS USAID CABLE HAS BEEN CLEARED WITH CONGEN JERUSALEM AND 
EMBASSY TEL AVIV 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  On Tuesday, April 20, USAID/West Bank and 
Gaza Director Garber and Deputy Director Ellis, met with 
Nigel Roberts, World Bank Country Director.  The meeting 
focused on the Bank\'s current thinking regarding Gaza 
disengagement and the Bank\'s specific plans for organizing an 
assessment mission to identify issues related to the 
disengagement.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Nigel Roberts reported that PA Minister of Finance, 
Salam Fayyad, and Minister of Planning, Nabil Qassis, 
participated in the LACC meeting of April 20.  Unfortunately, 
security concerns precluded USG participation in this meeting 
and, coincidentally, the EC also did not have a 
representative present due to other engagements.  To Roberts\' 
surprise Fayyad spoke about Gaza disengagement.  Salam began 
by noting the \"unfortunate assurances given to Sharon\" and 
commenting that \"we have to wait until the dust settles,\". 
He then stated that the PA has been thinking about Gaza/WB 
reconstruction issues and, in this context, views existing 
donor mechanisms as adequate, i.e., no need for, and a strong 
opposition to, new mechanisms to deal with Gaza disengagement 
considerations.  Further, he specifically noted that he saw 
no need for a separate fund for Gaza.  With regard to the 
role of the World Bank, Fayyad recommended that the Bank role 
should parallel that played in the early 1990\'s, and would be 
consistent with the Bank\'s official designation as the 
Secretariat of the AHLC.  He then indicated that the PA would 
 
SIPDIS 
welcome a World Bank analytical consideration of Gaza 
withdrawal, including what type of opportunities this would 
open, and that this effort should be treated not as a special 
exercise, but as part of an overall development plan. 
Roberts then indicated that he would be checking with Nabil 
Qassis and other PA officials to confirm whether the PA is 
ready for a World Bank assessment. 
 
3.  (C) Roberts advised USAID of his intention to grant an 
interview the next day to Ha\'aretz newspaper in order to 
counter what the Bank, including Wolfensohn, fears is the 
wrong impression created by Israeli leaks regarding what the 
Bank has agreed to undertake in response to the Sharon 
disengagement plan.  The Bank is particularly concerned that 
the distorted reporting of World Bank intentions vis a vis 
the Gaza disengagement could undermine the Bank politically 
in the Middle East.  Specifically, he will state that the 
Bank is willing to play a constructive role at the behest of 
the relevant parties and that the Bank (and implicitly all 
donors) is committed to the continued viability of the PA 
(e.g., the about to be launched budget trust fund).  He said 
that he would further clarify that the Bank has agreed to 
play only a technical advisory role and not, repeat not, a 
custodial role with regard to the assets of evacuated 
settlements and that the Bank legally could not be the agent 
for compensation of settlers.  Lastly, he would note that 
Israel is not a Bank eligible borrowing country, and so 
expectations that the Bank might provide loans or guarantees 
for Negev development are misplaced. 
 
4.  (C) All the above said, the Bank is ready, with 
appropriate concurrence from the PA and the Europeans (who 
the Bank wants to make sure are on board since their ultimate 
financial support to any reconstruction plan would be 
crucial), to organize a six-person, ten-day mission to the 
region.  Roberts\' current thinking is for an initial scoping 
mission during the May 6 through 16 period.  The team would 
focus on identifying issues that would need to be addressed 
by the parties and the donors before a comprehensive (or even 
preliminary) reconstruction plan could be prepared.  The 
assessment would cover such issues as the security regime, 
level of technical interaction between GOI and PA, transport 
and access issues that would facilitate economic development, 
etc.  The team also would visit the settlements from where 
Israel would withdraw, which could include the specified 
settlements in the northern West Bank, as well as in Gaza. 
In addition to meetings with relevant local actors, Roberts 
anticipates an interactive engagement between the team and 
the core donors.  Once the team completed this preliminary 
stage, then a decision would be made as to whether it makes 
sense to complete a more comprehensive reconstruction 
planning document. 
 
5.  (C) Roberts emphasized that the Bank does not want to be 
seen as being alone in responding to these developments. 
Clearly, even if they have lead responsibility on the 
preliminary assessment, they want this undertaken under a 
broader donor/political umbrella such as the AHLC or Quartet 
and with PA endorsement.  In this regard, he indicated US 
signals would be critical and commented that a US assistance 
pull-back from Gaza, whether over security or political 
considerations, would make the Bank\'s effort to create 
momentum very difficult.  (Note: The Bank is responsible for 
helping the Palestinians establish a Coastal Water Utility, 
which is a major complement to the USAID large infrastructure 
projects; they too have faced difficulties in awarding a 
tender, but have recently recommitted to moving their effort 
forward. End Note.) 
 
6.  (C) Lastly, Roberts noted that the Bank\'s plans are not 
widely known and requested that we not share beyond 
colleagues in the USG.  At the same time, he realized that, 
to field a team by May 6, he would require the necessary 
assurances by the middle of next week.

1.  (C)  Knesset member Yuri Shtern of the right-wing 
coalition National Union party told visiting Congressmen Tom 
Davis and Jim Moran during their April 15 meeting that Prime 
Minister Sharon\'s disengagement plan is one-sided and rewards 
terror.  Palestinian leadership is corrupt, he continued, and 
this only serves to reward them for choosing the path of 
terror over negotiations.  According to Shtern, the current 
intifada is not about settlements or pre-1967 borders but 
about Palestinian acceptance of the state of Israel.  If 
settlements were the issue, he reasoned, then Palestinian 
terror attacks should be concentrated directly at them rather 
than in Israel proper, where most attacks continue to take 
place. 
 
2.  (C)  Shtern reaffirmed the commitment of the National 
Union party to pull out of the governing coalition if the 
disengagement plan is adopted by the Cabinet.  (Note: 
National Union Chairman and Transportation Minister Avigdor 
Lieberman told the Ambassador on April 20 that his party 
would not stay in the coalition if the Cabinet approved 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan (reftel). End Note.) Speaking the 
day after Sharon\'s meeting with POTUS, Shtern called the plan 
a risk to Israel\'s survival and stated that it was a mistake 
for President Bush to have given his support.  In response to 
Congressman Davis\' query whether in Shtern\'s view there was 
anything the President could do to rectify the situation, 
Shtern responded that he must support the unity of Jerusalem 
under Israeli control and declare unequivocally that there 
should be no return to pre-1967 borders. 
 
3.  (U)  Bio Note.  Shtern is one of 7 National Union MK\'s, 
and is Chairman of the Internal Affairs and Environment 
Committee.  He has a Ph.D. in Economics from Moscow 
University, where he was a lecturer in Economics from 1971 
until his emigration to Israel in 1981.

1. (C) Y-Net, the website affiliated with mass-circulation 
Hebrew daily Yedioth Ahronoth, on April 22 published a leaked 
version of a reportedly Israeli NSC-drafted feasibility study 
on Gaza settlement relocation.  The document is less than the 
title promises; it is not so much a feasibility study as it 
is a cataloguing of Gaza settlements and settlers.  The 
document includes many tables of information categorizing 
settlements by type (communal, moshav, agricultural, urban), 
and offering demographic breakdowns of the settler 
population, including of secular or religious affiliation. 
The document offers a preliminary distillation of these 
figures with a view to determining how best to manage the 
settlers\' absorption into other communities, whether as 
individuals or collectively.  The document has not been 
finalized; indeed the budget section has been left completely 
blank.  Nonetheless, the Y-Net report indicated that it was 
being prepared for cabinet consideration on April 25. 
Embassy has emailed a PDF version of the Hebrew article to 
NEA/IPA, along with an informal translation provided to the 
Embassy by an outside party.

SUBJECT: EU ENVOY\'S THOUGHTS ON WITHDRAWAL, INTERNATIONALS\' 
ROLES 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1.  (C) EU Special Envoy Marc Otte told Ambassador Kurtzer 
April 23 that European officials are beginning efforts to 
identify steps that will allow the Palestinians to succeed 
following an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.  He agreed that 
the international community can identify appropriate roles 
and work up a terrific plan, but the effort needs a committed 
Palestinian partner.  Beyond that, the community needs to be 
able to call on PM Sharon to remove identified roadblocks to 
its efforts on economic and security enhancement, the two 
inseparable pillars on which Gaza\'s success depends.  Otte 
said he had told PA PM Abu Ala\'a that the Palestinians have 
international sympathy, but that sympathy is limited by the 
impact of attacks in Madrid and elsewhere.  In addition, the 
PA needs to identify one empowered interlocutor, not five. 
Abu Ala\'a, and, separately, Saeb Erekat and Salam Fayyad, all 
agreed that a strategy with a positive agenda is necessary to 
make Gaza succeed after withdrawal, he said. 
 
2.  (C) In general discussion of internationals\' roles, 
Ambassador Kurtzer gently noted Israel\'s firm opposition to 
any role for internationals on security -- what he termed 
\"almost a showstoppper for Israel.\"  Otte noted the \"real 
problems\" with the Palestinian security services at this 
time, and suggested that the Palestinians will need to be 
persuaded that this is what they want to do.  In the coming 
months, he said, the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee can develop a 
\"bag of goodies to make it work.\"  Asked about possible roles 
for Egypt, Ambassador Kurtzer said he thought the Israelis\' 
idea of any Egyptian role is inflated.  He also noted that 
some initial thought had been given to a role for the 
Multinational Force and Observers, but the idea needed 
considerable fleshing out. 
 
3.  (C) Ambassador Kurtzer pointed out that Israel\'s 
commitments to the President, as outlined in the Weissglas 
letter to NSA Rice, will not go away, and form a key part of 
the overall package.  With that, he saw no reason not to 
share as much information as possible between the Europeans 
and the USG on monitoring, as the sides did during last 
summer\'s Roadmap monitoring mission.  He acknowledged that 
the prohibition on travel of USG personnel to Gaza leaves the 
Embassy dependent on long distance contacts and information 
from others. 
 
4.  (C) Otte said he would be seeking Palestinian assurances 
that PA security forces would seek to prevent Gazan actions 
that would trigger IDF reprisals, and Israeli assurances that 
IDf actions would not target international projects.  He 
offered as one possiblity for mitigating such incidents the 
establishment of a joint situation room manned by Israelis, 
Palestinians and internationals. 
 
5.  (C) Otte noted that the UNRWA emergency appeal has 
secured only about half of its stated need because of donor 
reallocations to Iraq.  Beyond aid, though, he said that 
trade, access, job creation and standard of living had to be 
improved to the extent that Gazans wold be able to say \"life 
is not so bad here.\"  The Ambassador noted that at the time 
of Oslo, the sides hoped that expatriate Palestinian 
businessmen would invest in Gaza, but they never got the 
necessary cooperation from the Palestinian leadership. 
Nonetheless, he added, Gaza and the West Bank have a capable 
business communities. 
 
6.  (C) On the political scene, Otte and the Ambassador 
agreed that Abu Ala\'a must be pressed to act like a real 
prime minister, and, if he does, the international community 
can support him.  On the Israeli side, the picture should be 
clearer by the end of June, by which time it will be clear 
whether the current coalition of another constellation will 
be in place.  After that, Israel will need three to six 
months to pass necessary legislation to facilitate the 
withdrawal.  The international community should use that time 
to plan its own moves.  One key, Otte said, is \"convince 
Israel that we really want this to work.

1.  Israel\'s 56th Independence Day 
 
2.  Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media highlighted events related to Israel\'s 
Memorial Day (commemorated from last night through this 
evening) and Israel\'s 56th Independence Day (celebrated 
from tonight through Monday night).  Israel Radio 
reported that in his greetings to President Moshe 
Katsav, President Bush wrote that Israel can count on 
the friendship of the American people and on America\'s 
firm commitment to the well-being and security of 
Israel\'s citizens.  The radio also cited greetings from 
French President Jacques Chirac and Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak, who both expressed their wishes that the 
conflict be resolved (Mubarak mentioned the road map). 
All media cited data released by the GOI\'s Central 
Bureau of Statistics: Israel now counts 6.78 million 
residents -- 81 percent of them are Jews and 19 percent 
are Arabs. 
 
A remark made by PM Sharon in an interview with Channel 
2-TV Friday night dominated the headlines Sunday. 
Sharon told the TV station that he had informed Bush, 
during their meeting in Washington 10 days ago, that 
Israel was no longer bound by a pledge made three years 
ago not to harm PA Chairman Yasser Arafat.  The comment 
was widely construed as a wink to the Likud members who 
will participate in Sunday\'s scheduled vote on the 
disengagement plan.  All media reported that the U.S. 
Administration made clear over the weekend that it 
continues to oppose any Israeli action physically 
targeting Arafat.  The media reported that National 
Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice called Sharon\'s 
bureau head Dov Weisglass, and cited responses by 
Secretary Powell and the spokesmen of the National 
 
SIPDIS 
Security Council and the State Department.  Maariv 
reported that Israel has conveyed a message to the PA 
that a terrorist attack on the scale of the 2002 
Passover bombing in Netanya could bring about the 
assassination of Arafat. 
 
All media reported that Sunday cabinet ministers 
Binyamin Netanyahu, Limor Livnat and Silvan Shalom 
refused to assist Sharon\'s campaign to muster support 
for his disengagement plan prior to Sunday\'s vote in 
the Likud.  Yediot reported that Ohad Kamin, a member 
of the Likud Central Committee, published an article on 
the Internet site of the extreme-right movement \"Jewish 
Leadership,\" led by Moshe Feiglin.  Kamin\'s article 
contained an implicit call to take up arms against 
Sharon, \"a most dangerous enemy of the Jewish people.\" 
Education Minister Limor Livnat has urged A-G Menachem 
Mazuz and Likud institutions to take steps against 
Kamin. 
All media reported that a border policeman was killed 
and two were wounded last night when shots were fired 
at their jeep near Idna in the southern Hebron Hills. 
Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for the 
attack, saying that it was in retaliation for the 
assassination of Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi.  An 
hour later, and Israeli Arab was seriously wounded from 
shots fired at guards patrolling near the shooting 
range at Migdal Oz near Efrat in Gush Etzion.  Israel 
Radio cited the belief of defense sources that the 
second incident was not a terrorist attack.  All media 
reported that Friday the security forces arrested three 
alleged members of a terrorist cell who reportedly 
murdered university student George Khoury in the north 
Jerusalem neighborhood of French Hill, and wounded 
another student a week ago. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Palestinian sources familiar with the 
inner workings of Hamas as saying that Dr. Mahmoud A- 
Zahar has been elected leader of the movement in the 
Gaza Strip. Ismail Haniyeh has reportedly been 
appointed as A-Zahar\'s deputy, while the new No. 3 in 
the Hamas hierarchy is Said A-Siam.  Sunday, Maariv 
quoted Border Police commander David Tzur as saying 
that Israel has \"excellent human intelligence\" in the 
ranks of Hamas.  This morning, Israel Radio cited an 
announcement by the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in 
Ramallah that they executed a Palestinian who had 
collaborated with Israel. 
 
Sunday, Jerusalem Post cited criticism by U.S. 
officials of the PA for failing to prevent the escape 
on Wednesday night of three Palestinians who were being 
held in a Gaza City prison of involvement in the attack 
on a U.S. diplomatic convoy last October. 
 
Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that a federal judge in 
Rhode Island denied a motion to dismiss a USD 250- 
million lawsuit against the PA and PLO for the 1996 
murder of Yaron Ungar, a U.S. citizen who was killed 
with his wife Efrat by Hamas.  In July, the court 
ordered Hamas to pay USD 116 million in damages. 
 
Sunday, Yediot quoted the UN\'s special Middle East 
envoy Terje Roed-Larsen as saying that the PA must 
start taking effective steps to stop violence and 
eliminate terror. 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that Sunday the 
High Court of Justice ruled that Palestinian 
journalists with permits to work in Israel will be able 
to get press accreditation from the Government Press 
Office (GPO).  The ruling overturned a two-year-old 
government order denying press cards to Palestinian 
journalists. 
Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that last week in 
Dublin and Belfast Israeli lawmakers (from the Left and 
Shinui) and Palestinian leaders held separate meetings 
-- organized by the Irish Foreign Ministry -- with 
leaders from the Republic of Ireland and Northern 
Ireland.   The Palestinian participants reportedly said 
they were under orders not to meet with the Israelis or 
discuss reconciliation between the two peoples. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Israel has decided to ask U.S. 
Judge Edward Korman to defer a decision, originally 
slated to be handed down in the next few days, over how 
to distribute hundreds of millions of dollars in 
reparations by Swiss banks to Holocaust survivors 
worldwide. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Jan Willem Van der Hoeven, 
director of the International Christian Zionist Center 
in Jerusalem, and Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, president of 
the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, as 
saying Sunday that evangelical Christians may be \"very 
disappointed\" in Israel\'s leaders if the country 
withdraws from part of the Land of Israel, but that 
they will not turn their back on Israel or the Jews. 
They were taking issue with remarks made by Herbert 
Zweibon, chairman of Americans For a Safe Israel, who 
had warned about a possible evangelical anti-Semitic 
backlash if Israel withdraws from the territories. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that California Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger will arrive in Israel on Saturday.  He 
will attend the groundbreaking ceremony of the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center\'s Center of Human Dignity Museum of 
Tolerance in Jerusalem.

                       Summary:

Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized: 
\"Israel\'s willingness to adjust its own worldview -- to 
withdraw from territory and dismantle settlements -- is 
more than merely a message to the Palestinians, that 
they must also adopt a realistic world view.\" 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote on page one of mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot: \"Despite its age, Israel 
still lacks basic features of maturity.... Mainly: its 
residents do not have peace and quiet.\" 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"Those who dismiss Israel as a temporary \'Crusader 
state\' and assume that their brand of hatred and 
radicalism will outlast us do not understand a free 
society\'s strengths.\" 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Toward a Change in Outlook\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (April 
26): \"The fact that Memorial Day, which honors the 
soldiers who fell in Israel\'s wars, is the day before 
Independence Day stems from the history of the State of 
Israel.  The longed-for independence exacted a high 
price in blood, which has been paid by thousands of 
soldiers and their families not only to achieve 
independence, but also to preserve it.  Indeed the 
Zionist idea of establishing a state for the Jews, 
which has been recognized by the world\'s nations, is 
still not self-evident, especially in the region where 
the state is located.... Even though [recent] 
declarations [by Ariel Sharon] still await actual 
implementation, they constitute an ideological 
revolution that holds out the possibility that by its 
57th Independence Day, Israel will stand at the dawn of 
a new era.... This is the reality that the Israeli- 
Palestinian conflict has been dictating already for 
decades. Its solution is complex, but not impossible. 
It must begin with a change in outlook by both sides. 
Israel\'s willingness to adjust its own worldview -- to 
withdraw from territory and dismantle settlements -- is 
more than merely a message to the Palestinians, that 
they must also adopt a realistic worldview.  The 
adoption of realistic policies by both sides -- 
policies that reject the old ideologies, which served 
mainly to foment war -- may be the great contribution 
that this Memorial Day makes to next year\'s Memorial 
Day.\" 
 
II.  \"Clinging to Hope\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote on page one of mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (April 26): \"In another four 
years the State of Israel will be 60 years old.  Time 
for countries is not like time for people, but still, a 
60-year-old country is no kid any more.  It isn\'t an 
adolescent any more.  Its first gray hairs have begun 
to show.  Despite its age, Israel still lacks basic 
features of maturity.  It still does not have final and 
recognized borders.  It still does not have a capital 
city that is recognized by the world.  It still does 
not have a constitution.  And mainly: its residents do 
not have peace and quiet.  Israel at 56 is a country 
whose sons and daughters love it despite what it is, 
not because of what it is.  A year ago we were 
optimistic.  New winds were blowing.  Saddam Hussein 
had been easily defeated.  Arafat had been pushed aside 
by a realistic Palestinian leadership.... A year has 
passed, a lot has happened in it, and yet so little. 
Objectively, one can say that it was not a bad year. 
The economy began to grow again.  The critical section 
of the fence was built.... The terror organizations 
were dealt one blow after another....  But perhaps we 
need to change the definition of \'not a bad year.\'  How 
can a year be not bad when 185 security personnel and 
137 civilians fell in a terrorist war?  How can it be 
not bad when unemployment reached a record high?  When 
poverty is record high?  How can a year be okay when a 
heavy cloud of suspicion of corruption and bribery 
hovers over the prime minister?  That is the paradox of 
Israel in its 56th year of independence: a country 
whose citizens are crazy about it, but where every 
second citizen believes it is heading in the wrong 
direction.\" 
 
III.  \"Israel at 56\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(April 26): \"Tonight, in that sharp transition that 
should earn Israel a patent, we switch from mourning 
our fallen soldiers to celebrating the nation they 
defended.  There is plenty to celebrate.   Israel is a 
success story.  Against all odds, the Jewish people has 
a country in its own land, after 2,000 years of 
exile.... The Jewish national project has flourished, 
while the Arab choice of enmity with Israel has been 
the primary cover for neighboring states not to 
confront their own political and economic failings.... 
Our greatest success -- however ironically, given the 
way we have been vilified -- is not material but moral. 
Our enemies are consumed by hatred of us, and have 
attacked us with such barbarity that to call it war is 
to dignify an offensive composed almost entirely of war 
crimes.  Yet we have not thrown our democratic values 
out the window in the name of security, as illustrated 
both by the elaborate judicial review imposed on 
security policies and by the freedom given Arab Knesset 
members to vilify their country and side with its 
enemies.  Most dramatically, we have sacrificed our own 
soldiers\' lives to minimize civilian Palestinian 
casualties in ways that few, if any, democracies would 
under similar circumstances.... Those who dismiss 
Israel as a temporary \'Crusader state\' and assume that 
their brand of hatred and radicalism will outlast us do 
not understand a free society\'s strengths.\"

2.  Mideast: 
------------ 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote on page one of 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"Sharon\'s latest 
threat to strike at Palestinian Authority Chairman 
Yasser Arafat came at a convenient time for all the 
parties involved.... it is also convenient for the U.S. 
Administration, which wants to show its Arab and 
European friends that it can restrain the \'neighborhood

Liberal op-ed writer Yael Gewirtz opined in the lead

Aharonot: \"To the Americans, Sharon behaved like a bull 
in a china shop.... Right now they expect him to go the

I.  \"A Matter of Timing\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote on page one of 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 25): \"Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon\'s latest threat to strike at 
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat came at a 
convenient time for all the parties involved.  It is 
convenient for Sharon, who must present a hard line 
ahead of the Likud referendum on the disengagement and 
prove to his party members that he is not a sucker who 
caves in to terror and retreats from Gaza under fire. 
It is convenient for Arafat, who loves the role of 
victim and martyr and uses it to enlist renewed support 
from the Palestinian public.  And it is also convenient 
for the U.S. Administration, which wants to show its 
Arab and European friends that it can restrain the 
\'neighborhood bully\' and does not automatically support 
Sharon\'s every bullying whim.... These restraints may 
loosen under certain conditions, especially if a 
serious terrorist attack occurs that can be tied to 
Arafat, for instance, it the Tanzim is held 
responsible.  In that case, pressure would mount in 
Israel to implement the resolution to remove Arafat. 
The political timing would be critical -- for example, 
if Bush loses the presidential elections in November 
and the administration enters a transition period of 
two and a half months until his successor enters 
office.\" 
 
II.  \"A Private Hit\" 
 
Liberal op-ed writer Yael Gewirtz opined in the lead 
editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (April 25): \"The Prime Minister announced over 
the weekend that he told President Bush that he 
regarded himself as free of his commitment to refrain 
from harming Arafat physically.  This time, unlike the 
precedent of the assassinations of Yassin and Rantisi, 
the American response was quick, insulted and harsh. 
Sharon, according to the Americans, is crudely 
transgressing the rules of diplomatic discourse and 
also putting them at risk.... Beyond that, the 
Americans are saying angrily, after we went the extra 
mile for Sharon, we did not expect him to pay us back 
by making an announcement that increases even more the 
great risks we already cope with on an international 
level.   What kind of logic motivated Sharon now, after 
government spokesmen and the security establishment 
have already announced that no Palestinian leader 
Israel views as directly responsible for terror is 
immune anymore, to publicize such a declaration 
regarding Arafat and hang it like a millstone around 
the President\'s neck?  To the Americans, Sharon behaved 
like a bull in a china shop, kicking over the pitcher 
of milk he received from Bush with his statement. 
Right now they expect him to go the extra mile for 
them.  Dov Weisglass, who garnered praise for obtaining 
the understandings between Sharon and Bush and for 
Sharon\'s actual visit, which had been delayed for 
months, will need his full supply of verbal effects in 
order to ensure that both Sharon and Bush get out of 
this mess looking good.\" 
 
III.  \"Trying Out Our \'Madman Theory\'\" 
 
Military correspondent Aryeh O\'Sullivan wrote on page 
one of conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (April 
25): \"If you are going to apply the madman theory, or 
try to convince the other side you are a \'loose 
cannon,\' then you need to back it up with a true 
threat.... The manner in which the Sharon-Mofaz 
government has been behaving, with its unabashed 
willingness to assassinate and go anywhere, was 
creating the sense of a loose cannon in Jerusalem.  It 
appears to be working.  On Thursday rumors ran rampant 
in Ramallah that the IDF was planning to storm Arafat\'s 
battered headquarters where fugitives were hiding. 
Arafat quickly expelled 21 of the fugitives, who will 
likely be hunted down and arrested in the coming weeks 
by Israeli security forces.  The IDF has said that it 
is prepared to launch a raid against Arafat himself. 
All it needs are the orders.  Whether or not Sharon is 
adopting the \'madman strategy\' as a calculated policy 
or it comes naturally, the results have already borne 
fruit.\"

SUBJECT: ISRAELI ARABS SPLIT OVER THE MERITS OF 
PARTICIPATING IN AN ARAB LEAGUE CONFERENCE 
 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Arab League is hosting a conference 
on ties between the Arab world and the Arab citizens of 
Israel in Cairo April 26-27.  Arab League Deputy Secretary 
and PLO Representative Said Kamal, along with mid-level 
diplomats from the Arab League countries, arranged the 
program, which will include an open discussion on 
strengthening relations between Israeli Arabs and the wider 
Arab world as well as lectures by Israeli-Arab participants 
on the social, political, and economic issues they face. 
Twenty-five Israeli-Arab politicians and academics will 
attend, but the community is divided in its view of the 
conference: supporters claim it will prove that Israeli Arabs 
have alternate venues outside of Israel in which to address 
their concerns, detractors fear it will drive a deeper wedge 
between the Arab community and Israeli society as a whole. 
End summary. 
 
2.    (SBU) Two years after unsuccessfully petitioning the 
Arab League to allow an Israeli-Arab representative to attend 
League meetings as an observer, former MK and Arab Democratic 
Party leader Abd Al-Wahab Darwashe will lecture to League 
diplomats this week on the historic connections between 
Israeli Arabs and the Arab states at the \"Strategic 
Convention for Connections Between the Arab World and the \'48 
Arabs\", which takes place at Cairo University April 26-27. 
Darwashe is one of 25 Israeli delegates to the conference, 
including MKs Mohammed Barakeh and Ahmed Tibi (Hadash), Azmi 
Bishara (Balad) and Talab a-Sana (United Arab List), as well 
as one of the leaders of the Islamic Movement, Sheikh Ibrahim 
Sarsour.  Academics and NGO heads will also participate, and 
will follow Darwashe\'s talk with lectures about participation 
in the political process, land and water concerns of the 
Negev Bedouin, and the tension in the Islamic movement 
between religious obligation and Israeli law.  The conference 
will conclude with an open discussion between Israeli and 
League participants on the goals and means of \"strategic 
connections\" between Israeli Arabs and the wider Arab world. 
 
3.    (SBU) Although greater recognition from the Arab League 
has been on the wish list of certain Israeli-Arab leaders 
such as Darwashe for a long time, contacts state that not 
everyone within the Israeli-Arab sector sees this conference 
as the right step to take.  They point to a disagreement 
among politicians, academics, and NGO leaders over whether 
the conference will strengthen the Israeli-Arab agenda within 
the wider Arab world or, conversely, weaken the Israeli-Arab 
bargaining position in wider Israeli society.  Dr. Hanna 
Swaid, chairman of the Arab Center for Alternative Planning 
and former mayor of Eliaboun, told us that most Israeli Arabs 
do not want to involve themselves with the \"collection of 
dictatorships\" that is the Arab League.  He believes that 
most Israeli Arabs see themselves as part of Israel and 
prefer to deal directly with Israeli Jews and the GOI in 
order to address their socioeconomic issues.  He said 
anything that creates a real or perceived hostile separation 
between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs -- such as this 
conference -- only gives the GOI an excuse to treat Israeli 
Arabs as second-class citizens. 
 
4.   (SBU) On the other hand, Dr. Thabit Abu Ras, Ben Gurion 
University professor and co-director of the Shatil 
Organization for Equality, told us he will attend the 
conference because it is important for the GOI to see that 
\"Israeli Arabs will be heard, if not in the Knesset then by 
the Arab states.\"  He believes that the participation of the 
MKs from the \"four major Arab parties\" proves that most 
Israeli Arabs want to be recognized as Arabs in the wider 
Arab world and address their problems of status in that way. 
Co-chair of the Sikkuy human rights organization Shuli Dicter 
concurred that this feeling is widespread among a small but 
growing stream who believe it is not possible for Israeli 
Arabs to gain equality as Israelis, and who wish to create a 
new national identity separate from both Israelis and 
Palestinians.  He stated that a similar disaffection is held 
not only by Islamists but also by more mainstream 
organizations like Ittijah, a long-standing umbrella NGO 
covering a wide range of issues.

SUBJECT: SHARON OPTIONS IN REFERENDUM RUN-UP 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 2328 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1.  (C) With six days to go until Likud\'s May 2 referendum on 
his disengagement plan, inaction by three nominally 
supportive but reluctant key Likud ministers, and narrowing 
but still winning poll numbers, PM Sharon has available a 
menu of tactics from which to draw.  Most Israeli poll 
results come out only on Fridays, so Sharon must weigh 
whether the downward trend in Likud support evidenced over 
the past several weeks (reftel) is continuing through these 
final days before the vote.  Sharon will gear his sometimes 
contradictory comments and actions for each audience, leaving 
voters to pick their issues of greatest concern and to 
speculate, for instance, on whether he would, alternatively, 
resign over a referendum loss, as son Omri has suggested, or 
push ahead without Likud support. 
 
2.  (C) Sharon\'s available tactics include: 
 
-- Beginning with his Independence Day speech April 27, 
Sharon is apt to embark on a major series of statements 
stressing again that failure to pursue his withdrawal plan 
will cost Israel the President\'s landmark assurances on 
refugees and settlements.  He will likely stress again, as he 
did to last week\'s special Knesset session, the magnitude of 
those USG assurances, both positively for Israel, and more 
important for some Likud factions, negatively for the 
Palestinians. 
 
-- He will also likely deploy to the stump Defense Minister 
and disengagement supporter Shaul Mofaz and COS Moshe Ya\'alon 
to stress the security bona fides of the plan. 
 
-- Equally important, he will continue to underscore, as he 
did in statements published April 26, the potential harm to 
the U.S.-Israel relationship in the event that Likudniks 
spurn the President\'s support. 
 
-- In doing so, Sharon may refer again to the fact that the 
Likud vote is non-binding, although the claim cuts both ways: 
some potential supporters are apt to decide there\'s no need 
to vote since Sharon will go ahead even absent a win, and 
some fence-straddlers could conclude that they cold register 
a protest without derailing the PM\'s plan.  In any event, 
Sharon can point to overwhelming support throughout the 
Israeli public for Gaza withdrawal, stress the insignificance 
of removing the four remote West Bank settlements when 
compared to permanently securing the major blocs, and allude 
to the possibility that he may push ahead even in the face of 
a Likud defeat. 
 
-- He may, even at the same time, hint that he is tying his 
own premiership to the plan.  As son Omri has done already, 
he can point to the centrality of the plan to his leadership 
-- what he will suggest is the only Israeli leadership in 56 
years that has won such support on refugees and settlements 
-- although that resignation yields as much public skepticism 
as it does concern. 
 
-- Sharon will almost certainly maintain as tightly as 
possible the lockdown of the territories, seeking to avoid a 
multiple casualties terror attack that could sway 
fence-sitting Likud voters against withdrawal. 
 
-- Should the on-the-ground intelligence present him with the 
opportunity, Sharon could immediately target the new Gaza 
Hamas leaders, reinforcing his position among the critical 
hard right in Likud.  In a much longer reach that would 
require fortuitous, timely intelligence, and given the USG\'s 
ban on the easier-to-hit Arafat, he could conceivably reach 
out against Damascus-based Hamas leader Meshaal. 
 
-- Sharon will almost certainly explore the price that 
reluctant ministers Bibi Netanyahu, Silvan Shalom and Limor 
Livnat will seek to actively campaign for the plan. 
 
-- Sharon could also decide to complete the West Bank 
separation barrier so as to connect now all segments of the 
fence deep into the West Bank settlement blocs such as Ariel, 
in each case counting on USG acquiescence to such unilateral 
amendment as steps necessary to \"save\" the withdrawal plan. 
 
-- Were more time available, Sharon might seek additional USG 
assurances, such as on Jerusalem -- or release from some 
aspects of his commitments, but the time is too short. 
Should the referendum results be close -- either a narrow win 
or a narrow defeat -- Sharon could, however, claim the need 
for further Israeli gains as the condition for moving forward 
on withdrawal. 
 
3.  (C) Pollster Hannoch Smith told poloff April 26 that, on 
the basis of results from a private poll he is in the process 
of carrying out, and the narrowing voter margin 
notwithstanding, he sees the Sharon withdrawal plan 
\"squeaking by\" May 2.  Pollster Avinoam Brog also predicted a 
Sharon win.  He noted that the big problem facing pollsters 
on this issue is the significant number of Likud members who 
decline to provide a response -- as opposed to being 
undecided.  He said that, intuitively, he sees a \"pendulum 
effect\" by which Likud voters initially saw the Sharon plan 
as a chance for progress, then became frightened at the 
prospect of actually withdrawing and appearing weak.  The 
next stage, he suggested, could be that these same Likud 
voters step back and ask themselves whether they \"want to go 
on with terror...,\" and opt to support the withdrawal plan 
May 2.  Brog said the back-to-back combination of Israel\'s 
Fallen Heroes Day and Independence Day presents \"a very sharp 
moment\" where Israelis move from mourning death to dancing 
for joy.  The prospect of achieving the good times that 
Israelis wish to live will nibble at them this week, he said.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) On Sunday, April 25, the Bank of Israel announced 
that there would be no change in interest rates in May, 
leaving the BOI rate unchanged at 4.1 percent.  On the same 
day, the GOI approved Finance Minister Netanyahu\'s plan for 
reducing taxes announced earlier in the month. The cuts 
include reductions in income taxes as well as a gradual 
reduction in corporate taxes from 36 percent to 30 percent 
by 2007.  Meanwhile, the BOI Research Department Chief, 
Karnit Flug, says Israeli growth will reach 3.4% in 2004. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
Pause in Interest Rate Cuts 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (U) After 13 consecutive monthly interest rate declines, 
the Bank of Israel announced on April 25 that interest rates 
will remain unchanged at 4.1 percent.  In a very carefully 
crafted press release, the Central Bank listed a number of 
reasons for not continuing its program of interest rate 
reductions: 
 
- the shekel has experienced a 4 percent cumulative 
depreciation since the beginning of 2004; 
 
- the money supply has increased 8 percent in the first four 
months of this year, directly related to the decrease in 
interest rates; 
 
- Government bonds yields have slowly begun to rise. 
 
The BOI also stressed its adherence to price stability as a 
chief aim, and stated that, as there is now an increase in 
inflation expectations, it will review its monthly interest- 
rate policy in order to maintain price stability within the 
government\'s 1 - 3 percent framework. 
 
------------------------------ 
BOI May Cut Further If... 
------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The BOI in its press statement indicated that if 
inflation remains in the price stability range and the 
financial markets remain calm there could be a continuation 
of interest rate cuts dependent on certain conditions.  This 
would depend on whether there would be an increase in 
capital inflows relative to outflows, thus strengthening the 
shekel. 
 
4. (SBU) In a veiled slap at the Ministry of Finance, the 
Bank noted that more attention needed to be paid to reducing 
Israel\'s high debt burden, which reached 105 percent in 
2003.  As the BOI press release explained, reducing the debt 
burden would reduce long-term rates, which would in turn 
allow for short-term rates to be lowered. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Government Goes for Bibi\'s Tax Cuts 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) On Sunday, April 25, the Cabinet approved Finance 
Minister Netanyahu\'s proposed tax reductions for low and 
middle-income earners, as well as a gradual reduction in 
corporate taxes from 36 percent to 30 percent.  Draft 
legislation will be presented to the Minister\'s Committee 
for legislation next week.  These changes will require 
Knesset approval, and if all goes according to schedule, 
would go into effect on July 1.  Finance Minister Netanyahu 
announced the proposed tax cuts originally on April 4, 2004 
on the eve of the Passover holiday.  The MOF stated in its 
press release that the reductions were intended to reduce 
income distribution gaps, encourage employment and 
investment, and assist acceleration of growth. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
BOI optimistic about 2004 economic prospects 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) On April 22, Karnit Flug, Head of the Research 
Department of the Bank of Israel, expressed newfound 
optimism in a news conference about the Israeli economy, 
with forecasts exceeding those of the Ministry of Finance. 
Flug attributed the turnaround to the global recovery, to an 
improvement in the security situation, and to the GOI\'s 
fiscal and monetary policy. 
 
7.  (U) Flug presented the updated BOI 2004 forecasts as 
follows:

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio reported that the U.S. 
Administration is inclined to present Jordan\'s King 
Abdullah II a \"balancing message\" (Ha\'aretz) to the 
\"letter of commitment\" that President Bush presented to 
PM Sharon during his Washington visit two weeks ago. 
The radio cited the concerns of Foreign Ministry 
sources that the U.S. stance could \"erode,\" and 
reported that in his letter to the King, Bush will 
state that issues such as borders and the right of 
return for Palestinian refugees will be resolved 
between Israel and the Palestinians.  Ha\'aretz reported 
that Saudi Arabia and the Palestinians have requested 
similar letters from the U.S., and that the U.S. has 
informed Israel it will have to make a \"corrective\" 
move toward its European allies and the Arabs, but that 
it will under no circumstances renege on its promises 
to Sharon (Israel Radio cited a similar statement by 
sources at Israel\'s Embassy in Washington, which said 
the U.S. Administration would make an announcement on 
the issue).  The radio also quoted U.S. Administration 
officials in Washington as saying that Bush will 
reaffirm the United States\' adherence to the road map. 
Israel Radio also quoted Secretary of State Colin 
Powell as saying Tuesday, at a reception held at the 
Israeli Embassy in Washington for Israel\'s Independence 
Day that the final-status issues will be resolved 
through negotiations between the parties.  Powell said 
that Sharon has provided the Palestinians a \"new 
opportunity by removing some settlements, but a new 
opportunity that has to be met by other side by 
bringing an end to terror and violence.\"  The radio 
quoted Powell as saying that Israel has no friend like 
the U.S.  The station notes that Powell, in an 
interview with Reuters, said that Israel will leave 
buildings in the Gaza Strip at the Palestinians\' 
disposal, rather than destroy them. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Yediot led with concerns in Sharon\'s 
entourage that his plan will not pass at the Likud 
referendum slated for May 2.  Yediot quoted Sharon 
associates as saying that Sharon told them the 
referendum constituted a vote of confidence in him. 
Ha\'aretz quoted settler leaders as saying Tuesday that 
senior Likud officials have told them that Sharon 
actually plans to evacuate dozens of West Bank 
settlements, rather than the four he has publicly 
announced, but that he prefers to keep this secret 
until after the referendum.  All media reported that 
Tuesday 60,000 to 70,000 protestors demonstrated in the 
Gush Katif settlement bloc in the Gaza Strip against 
the government\'s disengagement plan. 
This morning, Israel Radio reported that a booby- 
trapped Palestinian jeep, filled with hundreds of kg of 
explosives, exploded near the Gaza Strip settlement of 
Kfar Darom, wounding four IDF soldiers who were chasing 
the vehicle.  Hamas\'s military branch claimed 
responsibility for the attempted attack on the 
settlement.  Leading media reported that two Hamas 
militants and a 14-year-old Palestinian boy were killed 
in separate incidents over the Independence Day 
holiday.  Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post also reported 
that three Palestinians were killed when two of them 
demanded that the third one surrender his explosives 
belt. 
 
Leading media cited Syrian media that last night Syrian 
security forces clashed with a \"terrorist band\" in 
Damascus, after explosions and gunshots were heard in a 
neighborhood where foreign diplomats live and work. 
One attacker was reported killed and another wounded, 
according to AP.  Among similar statements by Syrian 
officials cited in the media, Israel Radio quoted the 
Syrian Ambassador to the U.S. as saying that the attack 
was carried out by Al Qaida. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the IDF will dig a trench 
alongside a section of the Philadelphi Road, along the 
border between Gaza and Egypt, as part of preparations 
for Israel\'s disengagement from the Gaza Strip.  The 
trench will reportedly help prevent digging of arms 
smuggling tunnels. 
 
Israel Radio reported that this morning the Jerusalem 
police arrested Prof. Sari Nusseibeh, President of Al 
Quds University and co-sponsor of the People\'s Voice 
initiative, for employing Palestinians illegally. 
 
Yediot reported that reports that reached the Foreign 
Ministry in recent days indicate that former U.S. 
ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk could come back to 
the country as special UN envoy to the Middle East, 
replacing Terje Roed-Larsen.  The newspaper quoted 
diplomatic sources as saying that the only obstacle 
that Indyk could face would be Arab opposition to the 
move. 
 
Leading media reported that President Moshe Katsav will 
meet with Powell in one of the many diplomatic side 
meetings that will take place on Wednesday and Thursday 
during the anti-Semitism conference in Berlin, which is 
organized by the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Ha\'aretz reported that 
Sen. Hillary Clinton sent a letter to the World Jewish 
Congress, which was meeting in Berlin Tuesday, pledging 
to introduce in the U.S. Senate a proposal against anti- 
Semitism. 
Yediot reported that various diplomatic bodies have 
informed the GOI that the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague (ICJ) will render its opinion on 
the security fence in June. 
 
Yediot reported that Israel\'s income tax authorities 
want to put an end to practices involving Israeli 
employees of foreign embassies, who get cash salaries 
that are not reported by their employers. 
 
Several media quoted Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (the 
President\'s brother) as saying Tuesday, at a reception 
for Israel\'s Independence Day, that Jerusalem is the 
eternal capital of Israel. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Anglican Bishop Abu Al Assal has 
offered Mordechai Vanunu unlimited sanctuary at St. 
George\'s Church in East Jerusalem. 
 
Yediot reported on a controversy in Iraq: does the 
country\'s new flag -- which was designed by an Iraqi 
graphic artist -- bear a similarity to the Israeli 
flag? 
 
Ha\'aretz cited the results of an Anti-Defamation League 
(ADL) poll conducted in 10 European countries: only 31 
percent of respondents say that Israel is an \"open, 
democratic country.\"

1.  April 27 Damascus Attack: 
----------------------------- 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar\'el wrote on 
page one of independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"There 
are apparently some new features on the map of terror 
activity in the Middle East.\" 
 
Senior Arab affairs commentator Smadar Perry wrote in 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: \"Tuesday, 
the terrorist leaders appear to have conveyed an 
unequivocal message to intelligence agencies in 
Damascus: \'Either you stop cooperating with the British 
and Americans, or we will turn Syria into the next 
battleground.\'\"

I.  \"Attack Shows Region\'s New Terror Reality\" 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar\'el wrote on 
page one of independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 
28): \"The official Syrian statement saying terrorists 
had carried out a series of attacks in Damascus against 
the Iranian embassy, the British ambassador\'s house and 
apparently a building belonging to the United Nations 
was highly unusual.  It was an admission of an 
intelligence failure in a country that prides itself on 
its complete control of what happens within its 
territory.  As it turns out, Syria\'s reputation for 
maintaining iron-clad internal security exceeds 
realities on the ground.... Syria\'s intelligence 
officials now face a new challenge.  Up to now, Syrian 
intelligence has been ruthlessly efficient in campaigns 
against domestic underground groups; but it is 
apparently less organized for tackling terror activity 
from outside its borders.  There are apparently some 
new features on the map of terror activity in the 
Middle East.  In Arab countries, terror targets are no 
longer exclusively Western and UN diplomatic sites, and 
terror groups now appear inclined to carry out strikes 
in all Arab countries.\" 
 
II.  \"Assad\'s Double Game\" 
 
Senior Arab affairs commentator Smadar Perry wrote in 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (April 28): 
\"The deliberately closed eyes of the security services 
in Syria towards the waves of terrorists infiltrating 
Iraq, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are intended to safeguard 
Syria against terror attacks and the activity of 
sleeper agents.  However, Bashar Assad is playing a 
double game.  While Syria becomes a transit camp for 
terrorists, he also discreetly conveys intelligence 
information to the U.S. intelligence agencies regarding 
some of the terrorists.  Dozens of these have been 
extradited from Syria to the U.S. since President Bush 
threatened to include Syria in the \'axis of evil\'.... 
Tuesday, the terrorist leaders appear to have conveyed 
an unequivocal message to intelligence agencies in 
Damascus: \'Either you stop cooperating with the British 
and Americans, or we will turn Syria into the next 
battleground.\'\"

Liberal columnist Gideon Samet wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"Those who favor disengagement -

I.  \"The Referendum Paradox\" 
 
Liberal columnist Gideon Samet wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 28): \"If [Sharon] does 
push the plan through the Likud, it will be an 
achievement that follows the personal success he scored 
on his visit to Washington.... There is something of a 
paradox here, because those who favor disengagement -- 
the maximum political act that Sharon is ready and 
capable of advocating under the present conditions -- 
are ostensibly compelled to acquiesce in all the tricks 
he is using in order to get a majority.  They have to 
comply mutely when he lures the opponents of the plan 
by means of threats against Yasser Arafat; to cluck 
with admiration when he complicates Jerusalem- 
Washington relations and entangles Bush with a leak (or 
a distortion) from their private conversation; and to 
say, \'Wow, what a man,\' when he reverses himself all 
over the place.  In short, they have to accept Sharon 
as he is, with all the wiles and guiles of his 
ploys.... In this manner Sharon has [similarly] 
neutralized quite a bit of the criticism against him 
from the center and even the left.\" 
II.  \"In Favor But Actually Against\" 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the lead editorial of mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (April 28): 
\"[Hard-line Likud] Ministers Netanyahu and Livnat 
announced that they support the Prime Minister\'s 
unilateral withdrawal plan.  They explained their 
decision by saying that the preliminary political 
conditions they posed for supporting the withdrawal 
were met to their satisfaction.  However, when the 
ministers were asked to play an active part in the 
campaign to persuade the registered Likud members to 
vote in favor of the withdrawal, they adamantly 
refused.... What is the meaning of this refusal?  It 
has only one meaning: an implicit call -- a kind of 
wink -- to the registered Likud members to refrain from 
voting or to vote against.... The 
withdrawal/disengagement plan is fateful for Israel\'s 
future.  A statesperson of stature cannot evade taking 
a clear stance with regard to it.  On such an issue, 
one cannot -- from a conscience or political standpoint 
-- vacillate.... One cannot zigzag, being in favor but 
actually against.  Four days before the referendum, the 
opponents of disengagement are enthusiastically 
mobilizing support and showing initiative.  The 
supporters -- except for a few individuals -- are 
stammering or silent.\" 
 
III.  \"The Likud Contest Enters Its Final Phase\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (April 28): 
\"The Prime Minister\'s unnecessary entanglement in the 
dialogue with the U.S. concerning \'Arafat\'s 
elimination,\' didn\'t bring Ariel Sharon much credit. 
Furthermore, it harmed Israel\'s diplomatic interests. 
According to diplomatic sources, this was evidence of 
the impetuosity of Mr. Sharon, who, out of over- 
eagerness and propaganda activity around the Likud 
referendum, talks carelessly and makes remarks that 
cause harm to Israel.\"

Palestinian groups from the territories against targets 
in Israel has intensified.... Three months have gone 
by, but the second stage is stalled.  No new

Israel.\"

\"There Are No Easy Solutions in Cyprus, Either\" 
 
Hebrew University Professor of Political Science and 
former Foreign Ministry director-general Shlomo Avineri 
wrote in mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot 
(April 8): \"One could easily see how the UN and the EU 
-- which are opposed to Israeli occupation and the 
settlements -- were ready to betray their principles 
when it was about Turkey.  It is therefore no surprise 
that Greek Cypriots viewed the Annan plan as a prize to 
Turkey and the occupation.... In Cyprus -- and in our 
region, too -- there are no easy solutions, 
particularly if such solutions are initiated by foreign 
elements.  If there is no local political willingness, 
there can be no solution to the conflict.  What can be 
done -- like in Cyprus 30 years ago -- is to shake off 
the thought that the alternative to a solution actually 
is war.  There also is room for stabilizing the 
situation, reducing violence, creating effective 
barriers between the opposite sides to lessen friction 
and conflicts.  In the absence of solutions to 
conflicts that are not ripe for resolution, one must 
aspire to stabilizing them.\"

(1300 HOURS LOCAL) -- FOUR SOLDIERS WOUNDED APRIL 28 AS IDF 
THWARTS SUICIDE ATTACK IN GAZA 
 
 
THIS IS A JOINT MESSAGE FROM EMBASSY TEL AVIV AND CONGEN 
JERUSALEM. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: Israeli media reported that four Israelis 
were injured, one seriously, in an attempted suicide car 
bombing April 28 when a jeep exploded under IDF gunfire as it 
was speeding towards the settlement of Kfar Darom.  Three 
Palestinians were killed April 26 in the Mughazi camp in an 
argument that apparently broke out when two of the men tried 
to seize an explosive belt from the third at gunpoint.  Hamas 
issued a statement declaring that the two men who attempted 
to seize the belt were Israeli collaborators who tried to 
detain the third, who was a Hamas militant planning to use 
the belt in a suicide attack.  In the West Bank, the IDF 
killed two Palestinians alleged to be members of Hamas in 
Tulkarem.  The operation, in which another Palestinian was 
wounded, led to subsequent clashes in Tulkarem, injuring an 
additional six Palestinians.  Israel border police detained 
Al-Quds University President Sari Nussaybah for five hours of 
questioning on April 28.

SPUR SPECULATION ON REFERENDUM RESULTS 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 2382 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norm Olsen for reasons 1.4 (b) and ( 
d). 
 
1.  (C)  The brief vacuum of polling results, with private 
and public polls of Likud voters not expected until April 29 
and 30 respectively, and the large-scale April 27 
anti-disengagement demonstration in Gaza, have increased 
speculation by media pundits and politicos about whether PM 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan will squeak by in the May 2 
referendum.  While back-to-back holidays of Israeli 
Remembrance Day and Independence Day April 26-27 provided 
ample public speaking opportunities for Sharon to boost the 
plan, they also provided the sentimental and nationalistic 
backdrop and possible motivating force for the 70,000-person 
anti-disengagement demonstration that took place in the Gaza 
settlement of Gush Katif.  While many of the demonstrators 
were families combining a withdrawal protest with their 
Independence Day holiday enjoyment, and most were reportedly 
not Likud voters, the optics of the event, replete with the 
appearances of Ministers Natan Sharansky and Effi Eitam, 
highlighted the level of settler support. 
 
2.  (C)  Four days before the referendum, media speculation, 
last week\'s narrowing polls, a vocal and motivated 
anti-disengagement campaign, and the absence of key 
ministerial support in the disengagement campaign, have some 
withdrawal supporters concerned.  D/PM Ehud Olmert told the 
Ambassador at an Independence Day event that he is worried 
about the referendum.  He said that the problem was two-fold: 
Withdrawal opponents are more likely than supporters to 
actually get out and vote, and Sharon got a very late start 
in launching his campaign, opting to wait until the end of 
Passover to mobilize.  Disengagement supporters reportedly 
will spend the coming days convincing Likud members to show 
up at the polls, and reports say Sharon himself will be 
calling numerous Likud Central Committee members to enlist 
their support. 
 
3.  (C)  Former Labor PM Ehud Barak, who was at the same 
event as Olmert, reportedly told Olmert that while he hopes 
the referendum passes, he wonders why Sharon has bitten off 
\"only one-tenth of the loaf.\"  Barak noted that Sharon\'s plan 
does not go as far as Olmert\'s own withdrawal proposal.  If 
the GOI must give up land to protect Israel, he asked, why 
not be honest with the citizenry and acknowledge that the 
country cannot hold on to all of the territory it now holds. 
(Note: Labor leader Shimon Peres reportedly offered Sharon 
the following advice: Take the disengagement plan to the 
Cabinet and the Knesset even if the plan is defeated in the 
referendum.) 
 
4.  (C)  Comment: This week\'s much-awaited polls will either 
bring a sigh of relief or heightened concern to PM Sharon and 
his supporters.  If the poll numbers continue to turn against 
him, Sharon will likely tie the referendum more firmly to a 
vote of confidence in his leadership, and more strongly 
stress both the need for his plan and the consequences of 
rejecting U.S. support.  The opposition campaign will 
continue to deploy thousands of activists to rally Likud 
voters against the plan and continue to warn of what they say 
is the potential for polling fraud by disengagement 
supporters.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Yediot and Jerusalem Post reported that PM Sharon will 
travel to Washington to attend the AIPAC (Jewish lobby) 
convention, which will open on May 15.  Yediot reported 
that the Israeli Embassy has received instructions to 
coordinate a meeting between Sharon and Democratic 
presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry. 
 
U.S. National Security Council Spokesman Sean McCormack 
told Israel Radio Washington correspondent Yaron Dekel: 
\"The President stands by his commitment he made to 
Prime Minister Sharon when he was standing next to him, 
and by his letter to Sharon.  All his commitments are 
100 percent followed and we\'re in no way, shape or form 
backing away from this commitment.\"  McCormack refused 
to comment on the consequences of a possible rejection 
of the plan by Likud voters.  Yediot cited similar 
remarks by McCormack.  Israel Radio reported that 
members of the GOI welcomed the remarks from the White 
House.  The radio quoted Israel\'s Ambassador to the 
U.S. Danny Ayalon as saying that rejection of the plan 
would be a slap in the face of President Bush.  Yediot 
reported that Wednesday Sharon received a report from 
Ayalon about an initiative taking shape in Congress to 
express sweeping support for Bush\'s letter to Sharon 
and the principles it contains.  Israel Radio quoted UN 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan as saying that he will 
 
SIPDIS 
recommend that the Quartet give the UN a key role in 
the disengagement, like during Israel\'s withdrawal from 
Lebanon. 
 
Both Yediot and Maariv led with polls showing a 
reversal in the voting trend of Likud members who will 
voice their opinion on Sharon\'s disengagement plan 
Sunday: 
-Yediot\'s Mina Zemach (Dahaf Institute) poll found that 
47 percent of Likud voters are opposed to the plan; 39 
percent support it. 
-The results of Maariv\'s Teleseker poll: 45 percent are 
opposed to the plan; 42 percent support it; 13 percent 
are undecided. 
 
In interviews with Israel Radio and IDF Radio (as the 
latter is widely cited by other leading media), Sharon 
said that all those who support him must vote for his 
plan.  He was quoted as saying that if his plan were 
defeated in the Likud referendum, it would be a victory 
for PA Chairman Yasser Arafat and Hamas, worsen 
Israel\'s relations with the U.S. and bring about the 
fall of the Likud -- \"that is the extreme right\'s plan\" 
(Sharon to IDF Radio).  He added: \"It is inconceivable 
that an outside group [Sharon to Maariv: a \"minority\"] 
should lead the Likud.\"  Ha\'aretz cited the concerns of 
the plan\'s supporters that their PR campaign had 
failed.  Leading media reported that Justice Minister 
and Shinui party leader Yosef (Tommy) Lapid sent Sharon 
a letter -- coordinated with Sharon\'s office -- 
demanding that he bring the plan to the cabinet and 
Knesset for approval even if it fails to pass the 
referendum. 
 
Israel Radio reported that the State Department issued 
a travel warning for Israel, following the 
assassination of the two Hamas leaders. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Congressman Henry Hyde (R-IL), 
inspired by the most senior ranks in the Vatican, is 
calling on the Bush administration to stop construction 
of the southern part of the security fence, which could 
badly affect Christian holy sites in the Holy Land. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the special Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) conference on 
anti-Semitism, which is being held in Berlin, is 
expected to recognize the claim that the Israeli- 
Palestinian conflict is serving as a cover for 
worldwide anti-Semitic sentiment and expression. 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post quoted Secretary of State 
Colin Powell as saying at the conference: \"It is not 
anti-Semitic to criticize Israel, but the line is 
crossed when Israel or its leaders are demonized or 
villainized, for example, by the use of Nazi symbols 
and racist caricatures.\"  Jerusalem Post quoted Nobel 
Peace Prizewinner Elie Wiesel as saying at the meeting 
that a true dialogue about anti-Semitism in the 21st 
Century must include Muslims as well as Christians and 
Jews. 
 
Ha\'aretz and other media quoted International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) sources as confirming that the 
agency\'s D-G, Mohammed ElBaradei, will visit Israel in 
July.  Ha\'aretz cited the doubts of Israeli sources 
that he will be allowed to tour the nuclear reactor in 
Dimona. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Wednesday in Cairo the members 
of the Israeli Arab delegation to the special Arab 
League meeting on the situation of Israeli Arabs met 
with the league\' Secretary-General, Amr Moussa, who 
urged Israeli Arabs to continue supporting the 
\"Palestinian struggle against the occupation.  Moussa 
reportedly criticized the \"unrestricted U.S. support 
for Israel.\"  Moussa was quoted as saying: \"In fact, 
the U.S. and Israel have one policy vis-a-vis the 
Palestinians.  This is detrimental to the peace 
process.\" 
Maariv quoted the beliefs of senior Israeli defense 
sources that Tuesday\'s bombings in Damascus were 
carried out by Al Qaida.  The newspaper also quoted the 
beliefs of two unnamed U.S. Congressmen that Syrian 
intelligence planned and carried out the attacks. 
Jerusalem Post reported hat Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), a 
chief sponsor of the Syrian Accountability and Lebanese 
Sovereignty Restoration Act, threatened on Wednesday to 
develop new legislation that would not give the White 
House discretion on the issue unless Bush implements it 
soon and punishes Damascus. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that the Justice Ministry 
issued a sharp response Wednesday night but did not 
entirely deny a Channel 2-TV report stating that a 
special committee appointed by A-G Menachem Mazuz to 
help decided the \"Greek island affair\" had concluded 
there was insufficient evidence to indict Sharon. 
 
All major media reported that Libyan leader Muammar 
Qadhafi\'s son, Saadi, has invited the Israeli chess 
team to participate in the World Chess Championships in 
Tripoli from June 18 until July 13. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio reported that a confrontation 
between Holocaust survivors and representatives of 
Jewish organizations is expected to take place today at 
a hearing in a federal court in Brooklyn on how to 
divide reparation money from Swiss banks. 
 
Hatzofe quoted former Mossad director Shabtai Shavit as 
saying in a speech in a synagogue on the eve of 
Independence Day that Israel should view the PA- 
controlled territories, Jordan and Sinai as Israel\'s 
\"strategic backdrop.\" 
 
Leading media reported that Al Quds University 
President Sari Nusseibeh, who was arrested Wednesday 
for employing Palestinians without proper entry 
permits, was later released on bail. 
 
Yediot reported that for the first time the IDF will 
provide its colonels with American cars -- Chevrolet 
Opteras which, however, the newspaper notes are made in 
South Korea and are considered basic cars.  Yediot 
recalls that the U.S. had harshly criticized the 
Defense Ministry for choosing Japanese and European 
cars for its officers, despite the generous aid Israel 
is getting from the U.S. 
 
Hatzofe reported that the Secretariat of the 
Palestinian \"Popular Boycotting Committee of Israeli 
Products\" has asked the American company Caterpillar to 
stop selling vehicles and equipment to Israel.  The 
group says that the company\'s products are used in 
destroying Palestinian homes. 
 
Yediot detailed the possible implications to Israelis 
of the USD\'s current rise in world money markets.

I.  \"After the Likud Referendum\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (April 29): \"Given 
the present state of trans-Atlantic tension and the 
Iraq imbroglio, the Americans will have to accommodate 
Sharon\'s critics, within the political limitations of a 
presidential election year. Jerusalem believes that the 
[U.S.] Administration will not retract its declarations 
on borders and refugees.  According to the positive 
scenario, the Americans will make do with underscoring 
the \'positive\' fundamentals of the Bush letter to 
Sharon, such as a Palestinian state and an agreed-upon 
solution.  In the worst-case scenario for Israel, they 
will add declarations that would meet Palestinian 
demands, such as exchange of territories. 
 However, Sharon must get through the referendum first. 
If he fails with the Likud members, this would put Bush 
in a very embarrassing light, in that he would be seen 
as having risked his prestige and thrown his support 
behind an empty promise.  The American response would 
be in kind.\" 
 
II.  \"Yes, Assassinate Arafat\" 
 
Liberal columnist Yael Paz-Melamed wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (April 29): \"An elderly, inarticulate 
man whose level of corruption could make him enter the 
Guinness Book of World Records ... is a man whose bad 
influence is inimical to the lives of millions of 
people both in Israel and in Palestine. His name is 
Yasser Arafat.  He is the man with nine lives, who is 
directly and indirectly responsible for the death of 
thousands of people, Israelis and Palestinians.... He 
is the man who, if he is not removed from here -- be it 
by banishment or by assassination -- the reciprocal 
bloodletting will continue... It is not with a light 
heart that I write this here.  Like everyone else who 
believes that there is no forceful solution to the 
conflict, and that the only victory that is at all 
plausible is the removal of settlements and the 
establishment of a Palestinian state, I too believed 
that Israel needed to shoulder the bulk of the burden 
in being forthcoming....  Oslo was the beginning of the 
road, then came Camp David and Taba, and now 
disengagement.  Public opinion in Israel has begun to 
change; the public has begun to understand and to 
reconcile itself with the fact that only a political 
solution will produce the quiet we all seek.    But on 
the other side the very same anti-hero, like the 
phoenix, always stands.... At Camp David his deceit was 
fully exposed.... It is incumbent upon the Israeli left 
wing to support his disappearance from the political 
map, even if that requires his assassination.  The 
immorality of that action is negligible when compared 
to the immorality of the continued occupation, which 
cannot end as long as he is the \'Rais\' and his word is 
policy.\" 
 
III.  \"The Terror\'s Goal is to Overthrow Sharon\" 
 
Nationalist writer Uri Dan, a close associate of Prime 
Minister Sharon, opined in Maariv (April 29): \"Apart 
from their friendship, President George Bush and Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon have something else in common: 
the hate of radical Muslims and other Arab elements for 
them.  Those elements want to see them defeated as soon 
as possible.  In that sense, the Spanish syndrome that 
was the consequence of the Madrid massacre can only 
encourage them.... By a historical twist of fate, both 
the American and the Israeli peoples found themselves 
governed by leaders talking to terrorists in an 
identical language -- the only one they understand: 
force.... Islamic-Palestinian terror was surprised by 
the efficiency of Bush and Sharon\'s war, each of them 
in his own domain.... As the U.S. elections are getting 
closer, those elements will intensify their efforts to 
bring down Bush, even as they are trying to overthrow 
Sharon.  The \'Islamic revolution\' and its leaders 
believe that the clock of the \'rotten democracies\' is 
working in their favor.\"

\"The Enigma of Syria\'s Explosions\" 
 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (April 29): 
\"A series of explosions shook Damascus\'s embassy area 
on Tuesday. In a short time the Syrian security forces 
controlled the situation, and the assessed damage was 
rather small.... Since we are talking about a 
dictatorship, it would be hard to trust those 
reports.... How is it possible that no Western embassy 
was harmed?  How could the Syrian security services, 
which know every single hair on the heads of their 
citizens, not have known about Al-Qaida\'s weapons 
chances and organizing in Syria?  Is it believable that 
Al Qaida is interested in implicating Syria with the 
West whereas it is a terrorist state that has 
absolutely no reservations about Al-Qaida 
activities?.... Syria is a terrorist state, which 
sponsors terrorism, including providing human resources 
to Al Qaida and support to Hizbullah.  The coalition 
states should not get excited over fabrications coming 
out of Damascus.  The earlier they attack Syria and 
overthrow its regime, the better it will be for the 
Americans and the new government in Iraq.\"

Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (April 29): \"In 
Iraq, the Americans are conducting an all-out war 
against radicalism, tribalism and conservatism -- a war 
that is likely to be conducted for many more years 
before if brings forth fruits.  But they can already 
count some achievements.  For instance, the 
unemployment rate, which was 60 percent last year, has 
dropped to 25 percent.... The hope that Iraqi oil could 
fund the [country\'s] reconstruction looks real.  Thus, 
a race has been created between the will to reconstruct 
and develop, and that to destroy and lead the country 
into a civil war.... On the eve of a democratic 
experiment, which is in effect impossible within Iraq\'s 
current structure -- a lot of blood will be spilled 
over this -- that country has gone through a small, 
almost unbelievable miracle.  Time will tell how long 
this miracle will hold, and whether it will represent a 
miracle for the entire Middle East.\"

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, IS, GOI INTERNAL 
SUBJECT: AM AHAD AND LABOR MERGER LIKELY 
 
 
Classified By: POL/C Norman Olsen for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Histadrut International Secretary Nawaf Massalha told 
poloff April 22 that it is likely Amir Peretz\'s Am Ahad Party 
will merge into the Labor Party by January 2005.  According 
to Massalha, who served as a deputy foreign minister in the 
Barak government, a draft agreement is being circulated 
between the two parties outlining the process for merger. 
Massalha said that the agreement provides for Am Ahad MKs to 
take 20 percent of any ministerial positions awarded to 
Labor, claiming the proportion is calculated on the basis of 
the number of votes awarded to each party in the last Knesset 
election, where Labor took 19 seats and Am Ahad fell slightly 
short of four.  Commenting on the speculation that a new 
Likud-Labor government might be formed in the wake of the 
disengagement debate, Massalha noted with dismay that such a 
move would likely occur before the merger is completed, 
precluding Am Ahad KMs from taking any ministerial seats. 
 
2.  (C) The current leader of Am Ahad, Histadrut Chairman 
Amir Peretz, broke away from Labor in 1999 to form the 
social-issues-focused Am Ahad Party.  Massalha claims that 
the Labor Party in general, and Shimon Peres in particular, 
will be happy to bring Peretz back into Labor to boost the 
party\'s credibility with the middle and lower-middle classes. 
 According to Massalha, the Labor Party, unlike its European 
counterparts, has grown disassociated from core issues like 
eliminating unemployment and poverty.  In today\'s Israel, 
Massalha said, no politician is more clearly associated with 
those issues than Amir Peretz.  Massalha noted that Peretz 
was a Peres protege for years and indicated Peres is actively 
seeking Peretz\'s return.  Massalha also said that it is 
highly likely Peretz will compete for leadership of the Labor 
Party when Peres steps aside. 
 
3.  (C) Am Ahad has three MKs: Amir Peretz, Ilan Cohen, and 
David Tal.  Massalha acknowledged that David Tal, a former 
Shas MK who ran as Am Ahad because of his strong interest in 
social issues, will almost certainly leave the party if it 
merges into Labor.  Massalha said that Tal cannot return to 
Shas, and would likely join Likud when the merger becomes 
final.

SUBJECT: SHARON\'S CAMPAIGN: TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE?  LATEST 
POLLS SAY YES 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 2421 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norm Olsen for reasons 1.4 (b) and ( 
d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary.  Results published on April 29 from two 
major media polls show 47-percent-to-39-percent and 
45-percent-to-42-percent Likud majorities against PM Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan, reversing the earlier polls that showed 
similar majorities voting in favor of the plan.  Both polls 
also show that a 14 percent group of fence-straddlers could 
determine the plan\'s fate.  A private poll conducted the 
evening of April 26, and whose results have not yet been made 
public, showed the tally at 55/38 percent against, among 
Likudniks who are certain they will vote.  Likud Party 
activists and media pundits attribute much of Sharon\'s 
problems to a weak campaign, punctuated by what are seen as 
non-credible threats of resignation from his son and of a 
doomed U.S.-Israel relationship, if the plan is defeated.  As 
Sharon strategizes April 29 with advisors and enters the last 
72 hours before the vote, he will have to play a hard 
catch-up to his opponents\' three-week-long door-to-door 
campaign.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Polls Show Trouble for Sharon 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  Yedioth Ahronoth and Ma\'ariv polls conducted on 
April 28, show 47/39 and 45/42 percent Likud majorities 
opposing Sharon\'s disengagement plan in the May 2 referendum. 
 The one hopeful sign for Sharon\'s plan is that both polls 
show that approximately 14 percent of Likud voters are 
undecided and therefore could turn the tide either way.  Also 
somewhat encouraging for disengagement supporters -- but less 
reliable -- is a Hebrew news website poll showing that of the 
over 13,000 Likud surfers who voted on the website, 58 
percent supported the plan and 42 percent opposed it. 
According to some observers, achieving a majority for the 
plan may depend on Sharon\'s ability to motivate supporters to 
actually vote.  There will reportedly be over 440 polling 
stations in some 170 locales throughout the country.  Polls 
will be open from 8:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m., with over 160 
lawyers and 1,300 security guards observing the vote. 
According to Likud MK and disengagement supporter Majallie 
Whbee, it is convenient for Likud voters to reach their 
polling stations. 
 
3.  (C) As predicted, in April 28 interviews given before the 
poll results were published, Sharon depicted the referendum 
as a confidence vote in his premiership, stating April 28 
that: \"Anyone who believes in me must vote for the 
disengagement.... You can\'t be for me and against the plan I 
am promoting.... Those who want me have to vote with me.\" 
Knowing the hesitation Likud voters may have in going against 
the popular PM, key disengagement foe and 
Minister-without-Portfolio Uzi Landau has been trying to 
de-link Sharon from his plan, telling channel 10 news April 
28 that opposition to disengagement does not mean opposition 
to Sharon.  Indeed, most anti-disengagement slogans have 
avoided negative rhetoric against Sharon, with one even 
stating: \"We love you, Sharon, but we\'re voting against.\" 
 
4.  (C) In recent interviews, Sharon has scorned 
disengagement opponents for risking the friendship of the 
United States, and even resorted to the old-fashioned guilt 
trip by claiming opponents would cause a \"hard blow to the 
prestige of the U.S. President... who faces world terror and 
thinks this plan is excellent.\"  In an April 28 radio 
interview, Sharon also managed to tie his plan to Israel\'s 
economic well-being, alluding to possible economic strife, 
including investment and stock market woes if the plan fails. 
 (Note: Israel\'s financial market, while jittery, has not yet 
reacted strongly to the upcoming referendum.  Tel Aviv stocks 
dropped a little over one percent each day April 28-29.  The 
shekel-dollar rate did not change appreciably in that 
period.) 
 
------------------ 
Olmert Campaigning 
------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  Media commentators and Likud activists attribute 
much of Sharon\'s difficulties to his lethargic and tardy PR 
campaign, which cannot compete with the armies of 
in-your-face campaigning opponents.  One channel 10 news 
commentator, when asked to comment on Sharon\'s campaign, 
exclaimed: \"Campaign, what campaign?  There is no campaign.\" 
The one major visible symbol of Sharon\'s campaign remains 
D/PM Ehud Olmert who was broadcast on channel 10 news 
traveling on his lone campaign bus to Likud branches in the 
north with a handful of Likud activists.  A chatty Olmert 
seemed undaunted by his monumental task. 
 
6.  (C) Sharon has endeavored to remain humble but upbeat in 
his interviews, in one reportedly declaring that: \"It won\'t 
be simple, but I\'ll win.\"  He has also painted a more cheery 
picture of the extent of active ministerial support, 
reportedly claiming that Ministers Tzipi Livni, Meir 
Sheetrit, and Gideon Ezra have joined his campaign, and 
noting that \"(FM) Silvan (Shalom) is working with us now.\" 
The question, however, is whether the slow momentum he may be 
developing can compete in the final 72 hours with the 
opposition\'s three-week campaign of posters, slogans, 
religious leaders\' support, and door-to-door campaigners. 
Likud MK Majallie Whbee told poloff on April 29 that 
observers should expect a more energized pro-disengagement 
campaign in the coming days.  Like Sharon, he refused to be 
discouraged, stating firmly, \"everything will turn out all 
right.\"

Sharon\'s Disengagement Plan 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media highlighted the Likud vote on PM Sharon\'s 
disengagement plan, which will take place on Sunday at 
polling places around the country.  Maariv and Yediot 
carried similar headlines: \"The Fight of His [Sharon\'s] 
Life.\"  All media reported concerns that Israel will 
suffer a blow in the U.S. if Sharon fails.  The right- 
wing Jewish-American group Zionist Organization of 
America (ZOA) publishes a full-page paid ad in Yediot: 
\"The U.S. will continue to support Israel regardless of 
the referendum\'s results.\"  All media reported that 
Sharon and his aides have launched a high-pressure 
offensive to shore up collapsing support in the party. 
Ha\'aretz quoted senior Likud members as saying that 
only FM Silvan Shalom, Education Minister Limor Livnat 
and Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who only 
recently proclaimed their support for the plan, can 
save it.  Leading media reported that Thursday Sharon 
told his close associates in Likud not to waste time 
thinking about the \"day after\" the referendum. 
However, commentators say that he is aware of the 
political consequences of a defeat.  Some commentators 
believe that a national referendum is now needed -- 
Maariv also quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz as 
voicing this opinion.  Jerusalem Post notes that 
Sharon\'s allies have already begun fighting with each 
other amid polls predicting a setback: 
 
Polls: 
-A Mina Zemach (Dahaf Institute) poll conducted last 
night for Yediot finds that 47 percent of voters in the 
referendum are opposed to the plan (same as Wednesday); 
40.5 percent support it (40.5 percent on Wednesday): 
-The Dialog Institute poll commissioned by Ha\'aretz: 43 
percent against the plan (40 percent on April 21); 36 
percent for the plan (47 percent on April 21); 14 
percent are undecided (13 percent on April 21). 
-A Globes poll shows a 1 percent edge in favor of the 
plan\'s opponents (46 to 45 percent). 
 
Israel Radio reported that Quartet representatives (the 
United States\' A/S William Burns, the EU\'s Marc Otte, 
the UN\'s Terje Roed-Larsen and a still unidentified 
Russian representative) will meet today at the U.S. 
Embassy in London to prepare a discussion on the 
situation of the road map.  The talks precede a meeting 
in New York which AP says will be hosted by UN 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on May 4, and is expected 
 
SIPDIS 
to be attended by the EU\'s foreign policy chief Javier 
Solana, Russian FM Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of 
State Colin Powell. 
 
Israel Radio reported that an audio tape purportedly 
from suspected Al-Qaida operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, 
and broadcast on Al Arabiya-TV, said his group had 
intended to attack Jordanian intelligence, but that it 
denied the Jordanian government\'s accusation they 
planned a chemical attack.  Israel Radio quoted Al- 
Zarqawi as saying that had Al Qaida possessed chemical 
weapons, it would not have hesitated using them against 
Israeli cities such as Tel Aviv or Eilat. 
 
Leading media reported that Thursday the IDF admitted 
accidentally killing Dr. Yasser Abu Laimum, a lecturer 
in hospital management at the Arab-American University 
of Jenin, over the weekend. 
 
Leading media reported that Jewish leaders \"won a major 
victory\" (Jerusalem Post) Thursday with the 
announcement by the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that Israel\'s actions do 
not legitimize anti-Semitism.  According to the Yediot 
correspondent at the Berlin conference, pressure from 
Muslim states resulted in the conference\'s final 
declaration condemning attacks motivated by religious 
hatred, without taking into account Muslim anti- 
Semitism and the new anti-Semitism\'s anti-Zionist 
character.  Jerusalem Post and Hatzofe actually 
highlighted a sentence in the declaration which bears a 
different connotation: \"Anti-Semitism, following its 
most devastating manifestation during the Holocaust, 
has assumed new forms and expressions, which along with 
other forms of intolerance, pose a threat to democracy, 
the values of civilization, and, therefore, to overall 
security in the OSCE region and beyond.\" 
 
Israel Radio reported that Thursday the Defense 
Ministry and the U.S. Army successfully carried out a 
test of the joint Nautilus laser weapon project. 
 
Maariv cited an announcement by Casablanca Mayor 
Mohamed Sajid that he will come to Tel Aviv in early 
May to attend the proclamation by UNESCO of the 
inclusion of Tel Aviv\'s Bauhaus buildings on its World 
Heritage List. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that International Technologies 
Lasers (ITL), which is based in Rishon Lezion, has 
developed a device that can remotely detect explosives, 
drugs or other materials. 
 
The media reported on the latest developments in Iraq 
and on the questioning of President Bush and Vice 
President Cheney by the September 11 commission.

Sharon\'s Disengagement Plan: 
---------------------------- 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized: 
\"Those who support peace cannot be partners in a 
government that does not have the political power to 
take a hesitant step in the direction of peace.\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one 
of popular, pluralist Maariv: \"Anyone seeing Sharon 
struggling with the settlers and their rabbis, their 
religious rulings and their messianic fervor, has to 
rub his eyes.\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
Maariv: \"Sharon deserves this: for the security fence, 
the erection of which he put off for so long; for the 
important secondary role he played in toppling Abu 
Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas]; and for the corruption that has 
spread like a cancer.\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in Ha\'aretz: 
\"Sharon has made the mistake which tripped up the 
greatest commanders in history -- underestimating the 
enemy.\" 
 
Former minister of foreign affairs and former minister 
of defense Moshe Arens wrote in Ha\'aretz: \"Will 
rejection of the [disengagement] plan by the Likud 
membership cause a rift with the U.S.?  Such a 
suggestion completely underestimates the strength and 
solidity of the U.S.-Israel relationship.\" 
 
Extreme right-wing columnist Caroline B. Glick wrote on 
page one of conservative, independent Jerusalem Post: 
\"Sharon\'s plan differs from Oslo in that it overtly 
calls for the destruction of Israeli communities.... In 
spite of Sharon\'s statements to the contrary, those who 
oppose the plan on its merits are not extremists.  They 
are merely people who have learned from the past.\" 
 
Nationalist Hatzofe editorialized: \"Let us hope ... 
that a great majority of registered Likud voters will 
say \'no\' to Ariel Sharon.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"The Referendum as a Turning Point\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (April 
30): \"Three days before the Likud referendum, opinion 
polls are showing an increasing erosion of support for 
the plan to disengage from the Gaza Strip and four 
settlements in the northern West Bank.... Apparently 
the settlers\' entreaty and the ideological fixation 
among many Likud members are counterbalanced by support 
for their leader and the support that the President of 
the United States granted Sharon\'s disengagement 
plan.... In recent days, however, those close to Sharon 
and the Prime Minister himself have started hinting 
that a vote by Likud members against the plan is 
equivalent to a vote of no confidence in the party 
chairman.... Attaching important ramifications to the 
disengagement initiative, in diplomatic, economic and 
security terms, has caused the referendum to become a 
critical test of the [government] coalition.... The 
Israeli political landscape after the referendum cannot 
be the same as it is now.  Whatever the result, there 
will be significant repercussions within the internal 
power structure.  Those who support the settlements 
cannot be partners in a government that disengages from 
the settlements.  Those who support peace cannot be 
partners in a government that does not have the 
political power to take a hesitant step in the 
direction of peace.\" 
 
II.  \"Only in Israel\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one 
of popular, pluralist Maariv (April 30): \"Up until now, 
only leaders of the left wing had become accustomed to 
such sights: appeals from the rabbis, a religious 
ruling by the doyen of the mystics, Rabbi Ovadia 
Yosef\'s Saturday night sermon, thousands of ultra- 
Orthodox Jews at road junctions, flags, sandals, and 
women with their hair covered, and The Land of Israel 
for the Jewish People, and what is \'good for the Jews,\' 
and demonstrations, and shouting, and women being 
dragged on the road, and threats.  Yitzhak Rabin, until 
he was murdered, got to know this from personal 
experience.  Shimon Peres knows it by heart.  So does 
Ehud Barak.  And now the melody returns.  You, the 
composer, the originator and the first founder, Ariel 
Sharon.  You of all people, this time, the lonely, 
battered man, facing this swelling tide almost alone, 
helpless, not knowing how or why, who or how many, from 
where it fell on you or where it is going.  Anyone 
seeing Sharon struggling with the settlers and their 
rabbis, their religious rulings and their messianic 
fervor, has to rub his eyes.... The Prime Minister is 
in the middle of a maelstrom.... So what will he do? 
He could ignore the referendum (the Americans have been 
spreading hints to that effect in the past few days). 
He could submit the disengagement plan to the 
government and the Knesset.  He could drop the plan 
temporarily... He could try to initiate elections by 
complex coalition maneuvers and other tricks.  And most 
important, he can draw the appropriate conclusions and 
learn, by bitter experience, not to count his chickens 
before they are hatched.\" 
III.  \"The Day After\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
Maariv (April 30): \"What kind of prime minister will 
Ariel Sharon be if he wakes up in 72 hours to a dawn of 
defeat in the Likud members\' referendum on his 
disengagement plan?.... Sharon deserves this: for the 
security fence, the erection of which he put off for so 
long; for the important secondary role he played in 
toppling Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas]; and for the 
corruption that has spread like a cancer.... Sharon 
knows that were he to lose, he would have to resign. So 
would Ehud Olmert, as well as Defense Ministry Shaul 
Mofaz, who enlisted with such public valor in the 
campaign for disengagement from the Gaza Strip. 
Indeed, Mofaz won\'t be able to continue sending 
soldiers to [the isolated Gaza Strip settlement of] 
Netzarim and justify to the ears of bereaved parents 
the killing of their sons in Kfar Darom.... \'No\' to 
disengagement constitutes a domestic disaster.  It is a 
step toward a rift in the country that could bring mass 
legitimacy to refusal to serve in the IDF.  Those who 
oppose [the plan] state in their propaganda: \'If you 
vote in favor, you get (Shimon) Peres.\'  They must be 
warned: \'If you oppose the plan, you get apartheid.\' 
Israel will be isolated and forlorn for years, a leper 
in an anti-Semitic world that is yearning for this.\" 
 
IV.  \"Last Call For Mr. Comeback\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in Ha\'aretz 
(April 30): \"It\'s hard to believe our eyes with the 
polls on the Likud referendum.  Prime Minister Ariel 
Sharon, the man who beat the Egyptians and locked up 
Yasser Arafat, who twice won elections and became the 
darling of the U.S. Administration, who stood steadfast 
in the face of terror attacks, crises and police 
interrogations, is about to lose out to Uzi Landau, the 
minister he sat at the far end of the cabinet table. 
The polls predict a defeat but Sharon, it must be 
remembered, is Mr. Comeback.... [Still], Sharon has 
made the mistake which tripped up the greatest 
commanders in history -- underestimating the enemy.... 
Sharon\'s close aides are still hoping for a last-minute 
win, if only with a tiny majority.... But even then it 
is clear that Sharon\'s leadership has suffered a 
painful blow, while Landau, who insisted on fighting 
him to the finish, will now have to be upgraded in the 
Likud ranks.\" 
 
V.  \"Tempest in a Tea Cup\" 
 
Former minister of foreign affairs and former minister 
of defense Moshe Arens wrote in Ha\'aretz (April 30): 
\"Will rejection of the [disengagement] plan by the 
Likud membership cause a rift with the U.S.?  Such a 
suggestion completely underestimates the strength and 
solidity of the U.S.-Israel relationship -- a 
relationship based on common ideals, common values and 
common interests.  Under no circumstances, and 
certainly not when facing a tough election, would the 
President of the U.S. be looking for a quarrel with 
Israel.  Nor is the government likely to fall.  The 
present government is the most stable government that 
Israel has had in a long time.... So Likudniks can go 
to the polls on May 2, unencumbered by irrelevant 
considerations, considering only the central question: 
is a unilateral withdrawal likely to encourage 
Palestinian terrorists?  The answer seems obvious.\" 
 
VI.  \"Foreseeable Consequences\" 
 
Extreme right-wing columnist Caroline B. Glick wrote on 
page one of conservative, independent Jerusalem Post 
(April 30): \"What the last 42 months of Palestinian 
terror have shown is that regardless of the 
provocation, Israel will never garner international 
support for offensives against Palestinian terrorism. 
Sharon has promised that after the withdrawal, Israel 
will be able to sit in its truncated form for years. 
Yet this cannot be true.  Arafat will continue causing 
chaos to prevent that from happening.  As Arafat\'s 
foreign minister [sic] Farouk Kaddoumi said this week: 
\'Let the Gaza Strip be South Vietnam.  We will use all 
available methods to liberate North Vietnam\'.... 
Sharon\'s plan differs from Oslo in that it overtly 
calls for the destruction of Israeli communities.  In 
so doing, it poses a danger to the vitality of Israeli 
society as a whole.... If a majority of Likud voters 
reject Sharon\'s plan, they will be working to save 
Israel from disaster.  In spite of Sharon\'s statements 
to the contrary, those who oppose the plan on its 
merits are not extremists.  They are merely people who 
have learned from the past.\" 
 
VII.  \"Likud Majority Says \'No to Sharon\'\" 
 
Nationalist Hatzofe editorialized (April 30): \"Sharon 
is endeavoring to present a picture according to which 
President Bush is standing by his policy, as it were. 
Among other things, he offers remarks by the President 
of the U.S. that some of Bush\'s pronouncements will be 
brought to Congress for approval, turning them into 
[commitments] binding the [U.S.] Administration, 
regardless of who heads it.... One can only regret the 
fact that the Prime Minister, who only a year ago sided 
with the settlers, suddenly changed his mind and has 
now, for some reason, adopted the PLO\'s policy, acting 
to evacuate the Gaza Strip and parts of Judea and 
Samaria [the West Bank].  Let us hope that the results 
of the referendum, which is predicted to bring a 
majority to the opponents of the evacuation of settlers 
from the Strip, will find their expression in Sunday\'s 
vote, and that a great majority of registered Likud 
voters will say \'no\' to Ariel Sharon.\"

SUBJECT: GAZA DISENGAGEMENT: SHARON FACING DEFEAT UNLESS 
MAJOR -- UNEXPECTED -- TURNAROUND BEFORE SUNDAY 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 2458 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  All Israeli polls are showing defeat for 
Prime Minister Sharon\'s disengagement plan at the hands of 
Likud party members.  With little time left to campaign, and 
with the public\'s focus riveted on the Israeli basketball 
team\'s Saturday night final game for the European 
championship, Sharon has few available means of turning the 
numbers around.  Sharon\'s chief of staff Dov Weissglas told 
the Ambassador April 30 that he attributes the plan\'s drop in 
support primarily to Likud voter apathy and vowed that Sharon 
has no intention of giving up even in the face of a 
referendum defeat.  Polling data point to strong support 
among Likud members for Sharon personally, even by those who 
will vote against disengagement.  The smell of blood is in 
the water for Sharon\'s rivals who may use this referendum to 
try to send Sharon into retirement.  If the plan is voted 
down, Sharon has few options, none good.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Polls: Disengagement Plan Will Be Defeated 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) Public and private polls conducted April 28 forecast 
defeat for PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan by margins of 51/43 
percent and 46/38 percent.  With less than 48 hours until the 
polls open, Sharon has few if any means of turning the vote 
around.  He has already deployed doomsday warnings about the 
future of Likud, the economy and U.S. relations.  The threat 
of Sharon\'s resignation, voiced by his son, Omri, has not 
swayed voters.  Sharon\'s options are limited further by the 
fact that Israel\'s basketball team will play in the European 
Cup final game on Saturday night, meaning any last-minute 
media blitz by Sharon will fall on deaf ears.  Interior 
Minister Avraham Poraz asked the Ambassador rhetorically 
during the April 29 semifinal basketball match, in which 
Israel beat Moscow in the presence of 10,000 cheering 
Israelis, most likely mainly Likudniks, \"Wouldn\'t it have 
been smart if Arik (Sharon) had been here in the front row?\" 
 
3.  (C) Dov Weissglas acknowledged to the Ambassador April 30 
that: \"We\'re clearly in a battle,\" and that \"it is hard to 
judge the outcome.\"  He said the plan had elicited strong 
support within Likud immediately after Sharon\'s April 14 
meeting with the President, but since then supporters seemed 
to have become apathetic.  Weissglas conceded that the 
opposition message, articulated by such disengagement foes as 
right-wing National Union MK Zvi Hendel, that the U.S. would 
walk away from its assurances had had a negative impact on 
some Likud voters.  The PM\'s strategy, therefore, according 
to Weissglas, is to motivate apathetic but supportive voters 
by focusing on the potential costs of defeat.  Weissglas 
stressed that even if the referendum fails, Sharon has no 
intention of abandoning his fight for disengagement. 
 
--------------- 
Sharon Weakened 
---------------- 
 
4.  (C) Absent an unexpected victory on Sunday, Sharon will 
be a seriously weakened prime minister.  Top Likud ministers 
-- Netanyahu, Shalom and Livnat -- have mouthed hollow and 
insincere support for his plan, refusing to campaign in 
favor.  We have heard reports that Netanyahu has quietly told 
his camp not to support the plan.  Sharon\'s rivals clearly 
smell blood in the water, and may be plotting to use the 
referendum not only to defeat Gaza disengagement but also to 
send Sharon into retirement.  Sharon retains the support of 
his Shinui coalition partner, but Justice Minister Lapid has 
made clear his unhappiness that Sharon put the coalition\'s 
future into the hands of Likud\'s fractious voters. 
 
----------------- 
Post-Vote Options 
----------------- 
 
5.  (C) If the plan is defeated, none of Sharon\'s options is 
good: 
 
-- Submit the plan to the Cabinet.  Echoing Weissglas, 
Sharon\'s political advisor Lior Horev told the press that 
Sharon will continue to push for disengagement, regardless of 
the results of the Likud referendum.  The problem is that 
defeat in the referendum could free Netanyahu, Shalom and 
Livnat from their earlier promise of support; and thus a 
Cabinet vote could also conceivably go against Sharon. 
 
-- Submit the plan to a national referendum.  This would 
require legislation that would be hard to pass, as Likud 
Knesset members would rightly see this as a repudiation of 
the party\'s vote. 
 
-- Modify the plan.  This would allow Sharon to argue that 
disengagement is alive, and could help him retain his seat; 
but he would find it difficult to secure Likud agreement to 
anything even remotely resembling the current, minimalist 
plan. 
 
-- Accept defeat, ditch the plan, and try to govern:  This 
would be unlike Sharon and probably not sustainable over 
time, as his weakened political position would continuously 
be exploited by rivals. 
 
-- Resign.  This would also be uncharacteristic, unless part 
of a plan to make a dramatic comeback in new national 
elections.  Sharon publicly rejected this option several days 
ago (\"I am not even considering such a possibility or 
thinking in such directions.\").  However, the polls show that 
Likud party members continue to give him high marks for 
leadership, even among those who will vote against 
disengagement.  These polling numbers could contain the seed 
of a future Sharon political strategy.

Jerusalem Post quoted officials in Washington as saying 
that Deputy U.S. National Security Advisor Steve Hadley 
will travel to Israel on Sunday for a day of meetings 
with Israeli and Palestinian officials.  The newspaper 
says that Elliott Abrams, Special Assistant to the 
President and Senior Director of the National Security 
Council for Near East and North African Affairs, will 
accompany Hadley on the Israel leg of the trip, which 
will also include stops in Brussels and Bahrain.  This 
morning, Jerusalem Post\'s web site cited a White House 
official as saying that the White House late Tuesday 
scrapped plans for Hadley\'s visit to Israel and the 
Palestinian areas, because of scheduling conflicts. 
The newspaper also quoted a U.S. official in Washington 
as saying that former U.S. ambassador to Kuwait Richard 
Jones is among people being considered for the job of 
next ambassador to Israel. 
 
Maariv revealed that in secret contacts between Israel 
and Syria one year ago, Syrian President Bashar Assad 
had agreed to come to Jerusalem and speak to the 
Knesset, setting no preconditions, but that PM Sharon 
ignored his offer.  Ha\'aretz, Maariv and Israel Radio 
reported that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak\'s 
spokesman Majed Abed Fatah took back a statement he had 
made about Syria giving up commitments made by the late 
PM Yitzhak Rabin.  The spokesman said that the matter 
was not raised during Mubarak\'s meeting with Assad in 
Sharm el-Sheikh Tuesday.  Ha\'aretz and Yediot also 
reported that Walid Mualem, aide to the Syrian FM, 
denied Abed Fatah\'s earlier statement.  Leading media 
quoted UN Middle East envoy Terje Roed-Larsen as saying 
in a rare appearance before the Knesset\'s Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee Tuesday that Israel 
should immediately call Assad\'s \"bluff.\"  Yediot 
reported that PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) is 
expected to tell Assad at their upcoming meeting in 
Damascus that the Palestinians could curb terrorist 
attacks in Israel, were it not for the activity 
originating from Damascus. 
 
Leading media reported that Shinui is expected to vote 
against the 2005 budget and leave the government today. 
The media cited an announcement by the Shas party that 
it is prepared to support the budget in exchange for a 
change in the order of priorities in it.  Most 
commentators believe that the coalition will not garner 
a Knesset majority for the budget today.  Yediot writes 
that Sharon will contact Labor Party Chairman Shimon 
Peres today in order to bring Labor into the 
government, in which Labor is not expected to receive 
key portfolios.  Yediot cited hopes in the Likud that 
Sharon could form a broad-based coalition with Shas and 
United Torah Judaism, which would count 70 Knesset 
members. 
All media reported that former PM Ehud Barak \"stole the 
microphone and the show\" (in Jerusalem Post\'s words) at 
the Labor Party\'s Central Committee meeting in Tel Aviv 
last night.  Speaking on Israel Radio this morning, 
Peres was very critical of Barak.  The media reported 
that the Labor Party\'s Central Committee postponed 
until December 12 a scheduled date for the party\'s 
leadership primary, thereby giving time for the current 
leadership to try to negotiate Labor\'s entry into the 
government.  The postponement was a defeat for Barak, 
who has been pushing, along with eight Labor Knesset 
members, to advance the primary to April 12. 
 
Ha\'aretz and other media reported that Israel has 
accepted Egypt\'s offer to beef up its forces on the 
border between Sinai and the Gaza Strip, deploying 750 
troops in the area, and to train Palestinian officers. 
The media say that Israel will advise Egyptian FM Ahmed 
Abu el-Gheit and intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, who 
are due in Jerusalem today, of its decision.  Jerusalem 
Post says that the talks will focus on the issue of 
arms smuggling to the Gaza Strip.  Ha\'aretz reported 
that Sharon told a delegation of American senators 
Tuesday that he would discuss with the Egyptian 
ministers \"how Egypt is enlisting to reinstate 
stability in Gaza and to promote Israel\'s security 
coordination with the Palestinians.\" 
 
Israel Radio reported that the U.S. Administration 
intends to transfer USD 20 million to the PA to cover 
the Authority\'s debts to Israeli companies. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Palestinian FM Nabil Shaath as 
saying Tuesday in The Hague that Israel must reopen the 
voter registration offices it closed in East Jerusalem 
several months ago to ensure a free PA election.  The 
newspaper quoted him as characterizing his meeting with 
FM Silvan Shalom as positive, adding that he and his 
Israeli counterpart stuck with general statements and 
did not go into specific details. 
 
All media reported that Tuesday, overturning a previous 
ruling, the High Court of Justice found Shimon Sheves, 
former D-G of the Prime Minister\'s Office under Rabin, 
guilty of fraud and breach of trust.  Sheves had been 
associated with American consultants James Carville 
Carville, Bob Shrum and Stan Greenberg, who worked for 
U.S. president Bill Clinton and vice-president Al Gore. 
Sheves was also a consultant for Romania\'s Social 
Democratic Party (PSD). 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that PA geographers working in the 
Palestinian Planning Ministry and Negotiation Support 
Unit have concluded that the map of alternate roads and 
passages for Palestinians only, which Israel has asked 
the donor countries to the Palestinians to finance, 
shows that Israel intends to strengthen its hold on 
most of the West Bank and leave the settlements intact. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Tuesday a Palestinian man 
photographed playing his violin at the Beit Iba 
checkpoint near Nablus in the West Bank earlier this 
month rejected claims by the IDF that he played of his 
own accord. 
 
Jerusalem Post and other media reported that the Judea 
[southern West Bank] Military Court sentenced Abdullah 
Barghouti, a senior Hamas member and master bomb maker 
dubbed \"the mechanic,\" to 67 consecutive life sentences 
for preparing the bombs used in a string of suicide 
bombings in 2001 and 2002. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted visiting Estonian PM Juhan Parts 
as saying that the EU should behave \"more reasonably\" 
in regards to UN resolutions on Israel. 
 
Maariv lengthily interviewed Michael (Mike) Scheuer, 
who was the \"head of the bin Laden unit in the CIA.\" 
Scheuer warns that support for Israel endangers 
America\'s security, and says that Israelis forget that 
the U.S. has a long history of abandoning allies when 
the price of those connections becomes too heavy. 
 
Yediot reported that following heavy pressure by senior 
U.S. officials, Sharon recently appointed a team, to be 
headed by Prime Minister\'s Office D-G Ilan Cohen, that 
will check whether Israeli tenders and standards laws 
cab be modified so that American companies can compete 
in tenders and projects.  The newspaper says the U.S. 
is \"very worried\" by the continuing negative trade 
deficit with Israel: in 2003, Israeli exports to the 
U.S. amounted to USD 14 billion, while Israeli imports 
from the U.S. amounted to USD 6.5 billion -- a USD 7.5- 
billion gap.  Yediot quoted Ambassador Dan Kurtzer as 
saying: \"We are funding Israel\'s trade with Europe and 
we really dislike this.  You are selling to the U.S., 
but buying in Europe.  Israel needs to create fairer 
rules of the game vis-a-vis American firms.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Rep. Bob Beauprez (R-CO) as saying in 
Jerusalem Tuesday that America\'s Orthodox Jewish 
community has begun a long-term \"love affair\" with the 
Republican Party. 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that Homeland 
Security Secretary Tom Ridge has presented his 
resignation to President Bush. 
Jerusalem Post printed the full eulogy by Secretary 
Powell of the former U.S. diplomat Joseph Sisco. 
 
A Yediot/Mina Zemach (Dahaf Institute) poll found that: 
-65 percent of Israelis favor a new government; 33 
percent favor a Likud-Shinui-Labor coalition; 17 
percent favor a Labor-supported minority government; 15 
percent favor a government composed of Likud, Labor and 
the ultra-Orthodox parties; 27 percent prefer early 
elections; 8 percent are undecided. 
-If elections were held today, Israelis would vote for: 
Likud: 42 Knesset seats (40 in the current Knesset); 
Labor Party: 23 seats (22); Shinui: 10 seats (15); 
Shas: 9 seats (11); National Union: 9 seats (7); Arab 
parties: 8 seats (8); Yahad: 5 seats (6); United Torah 
Judaism: 5 seats (5); and the National Religious Party: 
4 seats (6).

                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"A Surprising Decision by the PA Cabinet\" 
 
Palestinian affairs correspondent and far-left 
Palestinian sympathizer Amira Hass opined in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 1): 
\"Despite the short-term logic in accepting the [Israel- 
engineered] passages plan -- it would enable relatively 
free Palestinian movement in the West Bank after years 
of destructive internal closure -- the [Palestinian] 
cabinet decided to reject it completely.  In this way, 
it signaled to the donor countries not to agree to 
finance the passages nor any other road without the 
approval of a special Palestinian inter-ministerial 
committee.  That is, the cabinet did not only protest 
verbally, but also adopted a practical measure.  This 
is surprising because since 1994, the PA has acted as 
if it is incapable of doing a thing to counter the 
Israeli policy of creating Palestinian enclaves in the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.... The Palestinian 
Authority, under the leadership of Yasser Arafat, acted 
as if it were a matter of force majeure, a 
deterministic process that no diplomatic or popular 
struggle could counter.... The question is how the 
decision of the Palestinian cabinet, which even 
obligates the U.S. Agency for International Development 
(USAID), might serve as leverage for a popular struggle 
-- Palestinian, Israeli and international -- against 
the Israeli policy of carving the Palestinian territory 
into enclaves and mutilating the two-state solution.\" 
 
II.  \"Who\'s Afraid of Moving Up the Elections?\" 
 
Nationalist writer Emuna Elon commented in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (December 1): 
\"Those greedy for \'disengagement\' try to disparage the 
Right for wanting to move up the elections, which would 
delay the evacuation of settlements by at least six 
months.  So what?  Why does the Left oppose moving up 
the elections, if not in order to accelerate the 
uprooting?  Yes, the Right wants elections because it 
wants to stop the pullout, to save the settlements, and 
to prevent a catastrophe.  The Right wants elections 
because it wants to return Yossi Beilin and the Geneva 
Accord to their natural place, to take away from the 
Labor Party the mandates Likud -- and not Labor -- won, 
and to let the Israeli people decided -- not in public 
opinion polls but in elections -- for or against a move 
which is one of the most crucial of those ever planned 
by an Israeli government.... Will Sharon please go to 
the people with his disengagement and let\'s see what 
happens.\" 
 
 
 
 
III.  \"What Has Abu Mazen Promised Barghouti?\" 
 
Columnist Shaul Schiff wrote in nationalist, Orthodox 
Hatzofe (December 1): \"Abu Mazen, the West\'s darling, 
explains in all his private meetings that in order to 
obtain quiet in the Palestinian street, he need 
[Marwan] Barghouti\'s release.  There no doubt is 
someone on the Israeli side who has promised it.... The 
shrewd Abu Mazen intends to knock down to the ground 
all of Ariel Sharon\'s dreams, which are the basis for 
his disengagement plan.  Guided by Hosni Mubarak, Abu 
Mazen has already told the outgoing U.S. Secretary of 
State and senior European representatives that he is 
unhappy about the idea of an interim agreement. Backed 
by Mubarak, Abu Mazen strives to achieve a permanent- 
status agreement -- immediately after the elections for 
PA chairmanship.  Any permanent-status move serves the 
interests of the PA; since the entire leadership of the 
West is asking for the \'67 borders with slight 
amendments, at the United States\' behest, a harsh 
confrontation is expected between Ariel Sharon and 
those Western leaders.  It will be interesting to see 
how [Sharon] will steer the course between his 
deceptive visions and the pressure that will be applied 
on him.\"

2.  Iran Nuclear Program: 
------------------------- 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar\'el wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"Iran is not the 
isolated country the U.S. wanted it to be when it 
imposed sanctions on it.... It is a regime that is not 
happy with the existence of Israel and would like to 
see it disappear, but not at the price of its own 
disappearance.\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"Through its nuclear program, Iran\'s mullocracy has 
managed to almost completely divert attention from its 
aggression and repression, the two attributes that were 
supposed to have made it an endangered species in the 
post-9/11 world.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"The Charm of the Iranian Threat\" 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar\'el wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 1): \"Iran 
is not Iraq of 2003. It is a state where most of the 
population is not happy with its economic 
circumstances, but not necessarily opposed to the 
governmental regime. Reformists are no less 
nationalistic than the conservatives.... And can anyone 
say which country is crazier: Iran or Pakistan, which 
has nuclear weapons, India, which threatens Pakistan 
with the use of its nuclear weapons -- and is now 
conducting talks with it -- or maybe North Korea, with 
whom the United States is ready to negotiate?  It is 
also possible to ask, before Israel or the U.S. uses 
the ultimate weapon against Iran, why it is impossible 
[for instance] to pressure China to cancel its USD 100- 
billion gas deal with Iran?.... Even more interesting 
is that Iran has not minded for years doing business 
with friends of Israel.  It even is begging for the 
renewal of diplomatic relations with Egypt, relations 
that Iran cut off in the wake of the Camp David 
accords.  Iran is not the isolated country the U.S. 
wanted it to be when it imposed sanctions on it.  It 
enjoys close ties with most of the countries of the 
world, and the ayatollahs\' regime is not made up of 
suicide bombers.  It is a regime that is not happy with 
the existence of Israel and would like to see it 
disappear, but not at the price of its own 
disappearance.\" 
 
II.  \"Safe For Mullocracy\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(December 1): \"What, after all, is the purpose of 
nuclear weapons for a regime like Iran?  Some seem to 
assume Iran is a rational actor and therefore rule out 
various doomsday scenarios, such as it attacking Israel 
or providing terrorists with a nuclear weapon.  We see 
no reason to make such assumptions.  Yet even if those 
scenarios are taken off the table, Iran is already 
accomplishing two other critical objectives: providing 
an umbrella for its support of terrorism and for its 
own repressive regime.  The Associated Press reported 
this week that 300 men gathered openly in Teheran, in 
the presence of a government official, to sign up to 
become suicide bombers, either against Israelis or 
Americans..... Iran is the world\'s most open and 
enthusiastic state sponsor of terrorism.  Its regime, 
much like that of the Brezhnev-era Soviet Union, is 
aggressive, hated at home and ideologically bankrupt. 
Yet, through its nuclear program, Iran\'s mullocracy has 
managed to almost completely divert attention from its 
aggression and repression, the two attributes that were 
supposed to have made it an endangered species in the 
post-9/11 world..... Any deal that makes the world 
safer for Iran\'s mullahs makes it a lot less safe for 
the rest of us.\"

SUBJECT: GAZAN VIEW ON SECURITY, FATAH FACTIONS 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norman H. Olsen for reasons 1.4 B an 
d D. 
 
ConGen Jerusalem cleared this message. 
 
1.  (C) Gaza business leader and longtime Embassy contact 
Mohammed Yazgi told POL/C November 30 that he foresees an 
eventual security team for Gaza comprised of Mohammed Dahlan, 
Public Security Chief MG Mousa Arafat, and National Security 
Forces MG Nasser Yusif -- a combination that he called \"the 
group of Abu Mazen.\"  Yazgi said he could not predict what 
roles exactly each of the three would play, but reports 
reaching him indicate that the three are preparing to \"work 
together\" at Abu Mazen\'s urging.  Yazgi described the current 
situation in Gaza as \"no one in control,\" and carrying the 
danger of further discord unless Abu Mazen and, in parallel, 
the major Gazan families are able to engender both security 
forces cooperation and a unified political movement. 
 
2.  (C) Yazgi said he discovered recently that workers from 
the PA security services are busy remodeling a building next 
to the Yazgi family home in the Rimal section of Gaza City to 
serve as a combined-services operations center for the 
various security services.  (Note: The facility appears to be 
the UK-funded Combined Operations Room, or COR.) Yazgi said 
he noticed the remodeling efforts in what had been a 
fire-gutted restaurant and went next door to inquire about 
what was going on.  The workers told him that in addition to 
an operations room, the building would house offices for 
Preventive Security Organization Chief Rashid Abu Shabak, 
Public Security Director MG Mousa Arafat, and other 
unspecified security chiefs, as well as an office for PLO 
Chief Abu Mazen when he visits Gaza. 
 
3.  (C) Yazgi said that, in addition, longtime PLO Ambassador 
to Germany Abdullah Efrangi recently invited Mohammed Dahlan, 
Mousa Arafat, Rashid Abu Shabak, and Fatah Security Chief 
Ahmad Hillas to a reconciliation dinner at which the chiefs 
agreed to work together as a team.  Yazgi cited the recent 
announcement by Abu Shabak that he had disbanded the 
long-rumored PSO \"death squads\" and sent the members back to 
their original units as a step in the right direction, 
although Yazgi said he had doubts that the squads would, in 
fact, be totally eliminated. 
 
4.  (C) Yazgi claimed that Dahlan is the most popular 
security figure in Gaza, despite what Yazgi termed Dahlan\'s 
high level of corruption.  Yazgi said that Mousa Arafat\'s 
activities focus on mafia-like activities such as shakedowns, 
debt collection on a percentage basis, and other measures 
that directly impact -- and alienate -- individual Gazans. 
Dahlan, on the other hand, has taken what Yazgi said the 
business community estimates is more than $100 million by 
high-level means, such as his commission scheme at Qarni 
crossing and his embezzlement of PA funds.  Mousa\'s 
activities make him truly \"hated,\" Yazgi said, while Gazans 
can overlook Dahlan\'s far more successful and more profitable 
illicit activities.  He acknowledged, however, that Mousa 
Arafat is both powerful and ruthless, and a key player in 
Gaza security. 
 
5.  (C) Yazgi said that Abu Mazen has been trying \"to correct 
relations between\" the now several Fatah-faction leaders in 
the Strip.  Abu Mazen, he commented, is both more popular in 
the Gaza Strip than Abu Ala\'a and \"likes\" the Gaza Strip 
more.  Abu Ala\'a, Yazgi said, prefers the West Bank.  Yazgi 
said that there are now at least six major Fatah groupings 
throughout the northern, middle and southern parts of the 
strip, and Abu Mazen is trying to get them to work together. 
Representatives from among Gaza\'s major families, those who 
are historicaly Gazan rather than refugees from elsewhere in 
historical Palestine, are making a parallel effort to forge 
unity, both as a means of ending discord, and in preparation 
for upcoming municipal and parliamentary elections.  The main 
families, he asserted, want to work together for \"one vote,\" 
and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past when they all 
went in different directions.  Yazgi estimated that the 
old-line families in Gaza totaled some 70 percent of Gaza 
City\'s 540,000-person population.  Residents of Shati refugee 
camp comprise some ten percent, he said, with the remaining 
population of mixed origin and affiliation.  Yazgi said that 
he had recently attended two dinners -- one of some 20 
major-family representatives hosted by Justice Minister Nahed 
Reyes and another hosted by the Bseiso family for some 60 
major-family representatives -- to discuss aligning 
positions.  \"If we make one decision we can return the 
municipality to Gazans,\" as opposed to refugees and those who 
returned from Tunis, Yazgi said. 
 
6.  (C) Asked about earlier efforts to work with the PA and 
the security services to reform services and operations at 
crossings into Israel and Egypt, Yazgi said he had made no 
progress and did not anticipate making any.  The security 
services jealously guard their turf and the revenue they 
accrue from controlling the crossings, he said, and the 
business community has no means of pressing for a role.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/01/2014

SUBJECT: BUDGET MAY FAIL, BUT SHRINKING SHARON GOVERNMENT 
SURVIVES 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norman H. Olsen for reasons 1.4 B an 
d D. 
 
1.  (C) The anticipated 43-54 failure of PM Sharon\'s budget 
late December 1, and the anticipated post-vote dismissal of 
Shinui ministers, leaves Sharon with a Likud-only government, 
but does not cause the government to fall.  Sharon can bring 
the budget back to the Knesset as many times as he wants. 
Shinui Chief Tommy Lapid remains determined at mid-day to 
vote against the budget because of Sharon\'s NIS 290 million 
buyoff of UTJ\'s five votes, despite the fact that Sharon gave 
him one \"out\" late November 30 with talk of the excessive 
cuts already taken by the religious community and another at 
noon December 1 with talk of possible budget allocations to 
Shinui-preferred sectors.  Lapid supposedly rejects a Shinui 
abstention, which, with possible abstentions by Shas, the 
Arabs, and two independents, would allow Sharon to win 
43-42-35, and allow Shinui to remain in the coalition. 
Lapid\'s rejection notwithstanding, noontime chatter in the 
Knesset is of a possible Shinui compromise. 
 
2.  (C) Sharon today has 38 Likud votes; Likud MK David Levy 
is against, and another Likud MK is hospitalized.  If the 
budget does fail, Sharon can try to buy additional religious 
votes (Shas-11, NRP-6) via budget allocations altogether 
totalling probably less than NIS 700 million.  With possible 
abstentions, that may be enough to win the necessary simply 
majority for budget passage.  If Sharon is determined to 
bring Labor into the coalition, as Shimon Peres claims, then 
he will need to address Labor\'s broader objections to both 
the budget and to finance reform.  Talk at mid-day in the 
Knesset and from a Foreign Ministry official is of Labor\'s 
demands really not being \"monumental,\" but Labor MK Collete 
Avital told poloff late December 1 that some Laborites will 
want to re-write the budget.  Since Labor will go for 
disengagement anyway, and would make such a fractious 
coalition partner, the possibility remains that Sharon may 
string Labor along, much as he has been doing since last May. 
 Peres, and a Finance Ministry budget official who spoke to 
econoff, say Sharon would use a failed budget vote to 
demonstrate to Likud that it needs Labor.  Amid leadership 
turmoil and the return to party politics of former PM and 
Labor leader Ehud Barak, Labor has put off setting a date for 
party primaries, leaving the opening for unity talks that the 
media says are to start 48 hours after Shinui is out of the 
coalition. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT: This could all be Sharon clearing the decks 
now for disengagement, rather than waiting until closer to 
the planned March 1 vote on first-phase disengagement.  A new 
coalition now with Labor, in particular, would also stymy 
talk of new elections -- which are opposed by some 73 percent 
of the public -- and leave Sharon clear to focus solely on 
disengagement.  If a unity government is to emerge, either 
Labor will face a climbdown from its previous budget 
rhetoric, or Sharon will have to accept further erosion of 
his budget and economic reform plans.  Sharon has 
demonstrated clearly now for some seven months that he has no 
aversion to governing from a minority coalition, building 
issues-specific, ad hoc alliances.

4200 cases of AIDS have been detected in Israel, though 
there are likely twice as many additional HIV carriers. 
There have been about 300 new cases of HIV infection each 
year for the past five years.  Thirty to forty percent of 
those have been detected among the close-knit Ethiopian 
immigrant community, with infection from sexual contact. 
About half of those infected contracted the disease 
following their arrival in Israel.  The number of cases of 
infection from sexual contact between homosexual males 
jumped from 30 to 60 per year over the past three years. 
 
Related Patterns of Drug Use 
----------------------------------- 
3. There are an estimated 28,000 heroin users between the 
ages of 18 and 40.  Intravenous drug use increased in the 
1990\'s, and about one-fourth of heroin users are from the 
former Soviet Union (FSU).  Women comprise one-fifth of 
heroin users. The most significant predictors of HIV among 
drug users are previous foreign residence or travel abroad. 
Most drugs users with HIV are from the FSU.  The absence of 
shooting-up galleries in Israel may help explain a general 
low incidence of HIV among IV drug users.  Nonetheless, 
substance abuse specialists and AIDS researchers expect 
HIV/AIDS to increase. 
 
High Incidence of HCV Among Drug Users 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
4.  There is a high incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) 
among IV drug users.  Rehabilitation treatment is offered to 
drug addicts.  There are seven methadone treatment centers 
across Israel.  Blood testing is performed for new entrants 
to treatment.  Seventy percent of new clients test positive 
for HCV. 
 
Public Less Aware of HCV Risk 
--------------------------------------- 
5.  Academics, health care providers, and government 
officials are concerned about a lack of knowledge about the 
transmission of HCV.  A workshop in Tel Aviv in October 
focused on syringe exchange and information outreach to 
decrease high-risk behaviors such as sharing of needles or 
inhalation paraphernalia, along with public education about 
modes of transmission of HCV.  Dr. Sheila Strauss of the 
National Development Research Institutes in New York 
addressed the workshop, noting that U.S. experience showed 
the importance of education, testing, and medical monitoring 
to arrest the spread of HCV. 
 
Health Care Community Mobilizing on HCV 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
6. Comment:  The Israeli public knows more about the means 
of contracting HIV than how HCV is spread.  As with 
HIV/AIDS, treatment of HCV can be considerably more 
expensive than prevention.  Israel\'s health care community 
is focused on mobilizing drug counselors to work with 
patients to prevent HCV and catch it early on if it has been 
contracted.

1.  (C) Summary:  On Wednesday, November 24, Israeli Minister 
of Tourism Gideon Ezra and Palestinian Minister of Tourism 
and Antiquities Mitri Abu Aita released a joint statement 
promising Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in support of 
international and religious tourism to the \"holy land\" 
(reftel).  According to Israeli Ministry officials, this was 
a symbolic gesture designed to set the minds of international 
visitors at ease, and represents the first step in a planned 
series of cooperation discussions on Israeli and Palestinian 
sites of religious significance.  Ministry and media sources 
noted that Ezra is following up the statement with action: 
his office approached the IDF with a request to ease travel 
for religious pilgrims and tourists on the patrol-heavy roads 
from Jerusalem to Bethlehem this Christmas.  In addition, 
Ezra plans to recommend to UNESCO that the Israeli-Arab city 
of Nazareth be named a World Heritage Site.  The joint 
statement and the Israeli Ministry\'s attendant activities are 
in line with a GOI strategy released last week that targets 
\"bible belt\" communities as a surefire source of increased 
religious-based tourism.  Gazan Palestinians said that since 
the Gaza Strip contains no sites of historic significance 
they do not expect any positive effects from the joint 
Israeli-Palestinian statement, but they are optimistic about 
Gaza\'s potential as a \"beach vacation destination\" for West 
Bankers if Israel eases closures and the PA invests in 
tourism infrastructure.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Joint Statement a \"First Step\" In Cooperation on Tourism 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2.  (C) Israeli Minister of Tourism Gideon Ezra and 
Palestinian Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Mitri Abu 
Aita released a joint statement November 24 promising to 
cooperate in promoting tourism to international audiences and 
ensuring the \"safe and smooth passage\" of religious pilgrims, 
especially between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, during the 
holiday season (reftel).  Arie Marom, director of the North 
America marketing division in the Israeli Ministry of 
Tourism, told Econoff November 29 that the meeting -- the 
first of its kind since the intifada began in 2000 -- was 
carefully timed with the approach of Christmas, and that 
Israeli officials took Abu Aita\'s own Christianity and his 
Bethlehem residency into account when considering whether to 
go forward.  Marom said that the MoT hoped the meeting would 
\"play well\" to international tourists nervous about visiting 
Israel due to security concerns, and added that it was only a 
first step in a series of planned Israeli-Palestinian 
discussions regarding tourism at specific sites of religious 
or historical significance. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Israeli MoT Serious about Bringing in Christians 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3.  (C) Marom explained that Christian religious sites are 
Israel\'s \"main tourist attraction,\" a draw surpassing even 
historic Jewish sites.  After four years of the intifada, he 
said, the Ministry is ready to start actively inducing 
tourists back, and must cooperate especially with the 
Palestinian and Israeli-Arab officials in whose 
municipalities Christian sites are mainly located.  To this 
end, Ezra reportedly approached senior IDF officials with a 
request to ease travel for international tourists and 
religious pilgrims between Jerusalem and Bethlehem -- an area 
thick with roadblocks and heavily patrolled by IDF soldiers 
-- during the Christmas season.  He also encouraged the mayor 
of Nazareth, an Israeli-Arab municipality that receives over 
half of the Christian tourists visiting the holy land 
annually, to hold a joint press conference with the mayor of 
the adjacent Jewish municipality of Nazareth Illit in support 
of further tourism.  The Ministry also plans to recommend to 
UNESCO that Nazareth be named a World Heritage Site.  All 
this is aimed at promoting Nazareth and its environs as a 
safe, rewarding place to visit. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Emissary to \"Bible Belt\" Will Carry out New Strategy 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4.  (C) Last week the Ministry released a report in Hebrew on 
its new strategic marketing plan for North America, in which 
it states that the American Christian communities of the 
\"bible belt\" are a source of \"tens of millions of Christian 
supporters of Israel\" whose potential as tourists has not yet 
been fully realized, and who will be the chief target of a 
\"marketing blitz.\"  Beginning this summer, a Ministry 
representative will spearhead this campaign from a U.S. 
office, possibly to be based in Texas.  The campaign will 
include multi-media presentations and expositions within 
local communities, as well as \"workshops\" with church 
officials and Christian travel agencies in support of travel 
to Israel.  In a similar vein, the offices of the director 
generals of the Ministries of Tourism and Foreign Affairs 
released a document this week for distribution to Israeli 
missions abroad, which encourages GOI emissaries at all 
levels to promote tourism to \"groups of supporters\" of Israel 
-- identified primarily as Jewish and Christian communities 
-- within their host populations. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Agreement Overlooks Gaza; Businessmen Looking Ahead 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5.  (C) Gazan hotel owners and restaurateurs are pessimistic 
that the joint Israeli-Palestinian statement of November 24 
and the cooperative steps the Israeli Ministry says it is 
planning for the future will help them.  The Gaza Strip 
simply contains no sites of religious or historic 
significance, Hashim al-Hussaini of Paltrade told Econoff 
November 30.  While the positive international press 
generated by a Ministerial-level Israeli-Palestinian meeting 
\"could not hurt Gaza\'s image\", he explained, few in the 
Strip\'s tourist industry had even heard that a meeting had 
taken place, so irrelevant was it to their everyday business. 
 Arie Marom concurred that the statement was not orchestrated 
with the Gaza Strip in mind.  \"Gaza will never be a 
destination for international tourists,\" he said. 
 
6.  (C) Yet businessmen in Gaza take seriously the potential 
for significant \"local tourism\" if Israel and the PA take 
certain steps to facilitate it.  Before the current intifada, 
a Reyyes Consulting Company representative told Econoff, the 
Gaza Strip was a stopping-place for Israeli Arabs traveling 
to Egypt, a long weekend destination for staff members of 
international organizations, and a beach holiday for West 
Bank Palestinians.  It is possible to get back to the nearly 
full hotels and flourishing beach restaurants of four years 
ago, he said, if Israel allows its Arab citizens back into 
the Strip through Erez, and if the PA takes a keener interest 
in the development of tourist infrastructure along the coast. 
 He noted that even now construction companies have put up 
four new hotels in Gaza -- the drive exists among 
businessmen, they simply need an organizing force. 
 
7.  (C) Comment: While Israeli officials indicated that 
neither side intended the joint statement on tourism as a 
confidence-building measure, the timing of the event lends it 
positive resonance within both populations.  The Israeli and 
Palestinian Tourism Ministries made a similar joint statement 
of intent to facilitate Christmas tourism last year, but 
unlike this year\'s statement, it received little media 
attention, and it did not result in any follow-up discussions.

SUBJECT: RUSSIAN IMMIGRANTS IN ISRAEL: CULTURAL AND 
EDUCATIONAL ISSUES 
 
1. Summary: During a recent meeting with PD staff, 
Professor Marina Nizhnik of Tel Aviv University 
discussed the Russian immigrant community of Israel, 
with particular emphasis on differences between the 
more established community that has resided in Israel 
for the past 10 years and the recent arrivals.  End 
summary. 
 
2. On Friday, November 12, the Assistant Information 
Officer and the Cultural Assistant met with Dr. Marina 
Nizhnik, a professor of sociology at Tel Aviv 
University whose research deals with the Russian 
immigrant community in Israel.  The Counselor for 
Public Affairs also participated in the meeting.  Dr. 
Nizhnik spoke about the disparate Russian immigrant 
communities in Israel, contrasting those immigrants who 
have been here for at least 10 years with those who 
have arrived within the past 5 years. 
 
3. Although the Russian immigrant community is 
typically treated as a monolithic unit within Israeli 
society, Dr. Nizhnik pointed out that there are many 
different groups which compose this community.  The 
Russian Israelis are a heterogeneous group from all 15 
of the former Soviet republics, and come from a wide 
range of economic, educational, social, cultural, and 
religious backgrounds.  The most important key to 
understanding differences within the Russian Israeli 
community is looking at the time period during which 
they immigrated, although this is a sensitive question 
which Dr. Nizhnik admitted is not very politically 
correct. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
\"Non-Russian Russians; Non-Jewish Jews\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4. The earliest waves of emigration took place during 
the Soviet period, and while each emigre had his or her 
own reasons for leaving, a rising tide of anti-Semitism 
in the Soviet Union combined with the pressures applied 
on the Soviets to grant exit visas to Jews and the 
prospect of better economic conditions abroad to create 
strong incentives to leave.  Israel, with a multitude 
of state-funded programs to assist new arrivals, was 
the easiest place to resettle.  The Israeli Law of 
Return, one of the first pieces of legislation passed 
by the State of Israel, guarantees to any person who is 
Jewish the right to live in Israel and acquire Israeli 
citizenship.  This right extends to persons with at 
least one Jewish grandparent, as well as spouses of 
Jews and their offspring.  According to Israeli 
official data cited by Dr. Nizhnik, 96% of the 
immigrants from the Soviet Union in 1990 were Jewish as 
defined by halakhic or Jewish religious law, a stricter 
definition than that allowed under the Law of Return, 
although only 72% of them were identified as Jews 
according to their Soviet civil registrations (which 
included \"nationality\" or \"ethnicity\" as an 
identifier).  By 2000, a minority - 45% - of new 
immigrants from the 15 former Soviet states were Jewish 
according to the strict halakhic definitions, and only 
27% were identified as Jews according to their civil 
registrations. 
 
5. Of the most recent arrivals - those who have come to 
Israel since 2000 - Dr. Nizhnik observed that the 
younger the immigrant, the less likely it is that he 
thinks of himself as being Jewish.  Many of these 
newcomers never identified themselves as being Jewish 
before they came to Israel, and many continue to 
identify with the dominant religious traditions of 
their countries of origin, where various forms of 
Christianity have been adopted as state religions (to 
various extents) as part of the forging of a post- 
Soviet national identity.  In further contrast to the 
earlier waves of immigrants, the newcomers tend to be 
from countries other than Russia (predominantly 
Ukraine, with large numbers from Moldova and Belarus) 
and frequently do not speak Russian as a native 
language.  Dr. Nizhnik also noted that these newer 
arrivals are far more likely to hail from rural areas 
than the earlier immigrants, who were typically from 
urban centers. 
 
6. Dr. Nizhnik commented that the average level of 
education among immigrants tended to be higher among 
immigrants who arrived prior to 1990 than it is among 
the most recent immigrants.  Earlier immigrants tended 
to speak Russian as a native language, because 
instruction in the better schools in the non-Russian 
republics during the Soviet period was carried out in 
Russian.  Newer immigrants, identified from the moment 
of their arrival in Israel as \"Russians\" even if they 
are Ukrainians or Moldovans by birth, attempt to relate 
to the Russian community to the greatest extent 
possible.  Although they might not be native Russian 
speakers, they tend to find Russian an easier language 
for practical purposes than Hebrew.  And excluded from 
native or \"Sabra\" Israeli culture, they adopt Russian 
culture as a part of their own identity.  Dr. Nizhnik 
observed that the school-aged newcomers in particular 
take great pride in their adopted Russian background, 
asserting the superiority of Russian culture over what 
they view as the \"barbaric, oriental\" culture of native 
Israelis, even though they are frequently quite 
ignorant of Russian culture as well.  She related a 
conversation she had had with a high-school student 
born in Ukraine who was boasting in a literature class 
about the superiority of Russian authors.  When asked 
what his favorite work was by the famous Russian author 
Fyodor Dostoevsky, the student proudly named [Leo 
Tolstoy\'s classic] \"War and Peace.\" 
 
-------------------------- 
\"Union of Outsiders\" 
-------------------------- 
 
7. The immigrants who arrived in the early 1990\'s from 
the Soviet Union and the post-Soviet states have 
largely, though by no means universally, become 
integrated into Israeli society.  They have daily 
contact with other Israelis at work and school and use 
Hebrew in their daily lives, although they frequently 
continue to speak Russian at home, and their children 
are quite capable of moving between the Russian and 
Israeli spheres.  Those who have arrived since 2000 
have generally had a much more difficult time adapting. 
With linguistic, social, and other barriers to 
overcome, they tend to find it very difficult to enter 
the Israeli sphere.  In general, the extent to which 
parents are forced to rely on their children\'s language 
skills has greatly disrupted the family structures that 
these immigrants were familiar with in their home 
countries.  Dr. Nizhnik commented that in the 
interviews she has conducted in the course of her 
research, one theme has been that these immigrants have 
no particular desire to be in Israel.  The major factor 
in their decision to emigrate was their hope for better 
economic and educational opportunities for their 
children, and because of their ability to claim Jewish 
ancestry, they are able to come to Israel.  Many of 
them see Israel as a way station en route to eventual 
emigration to the United States or Canada. 
 
8. According to Dr. Nizhnik, the sense of exclusion 
from mainstream Israeli society among new immigrants is 
a major factor in a developing social trend - the 
relations between new immigrants from the former Soviet 
states and the Israeli Arab community, which also tends 
to be kept on the outside of Israeli society.  She 
observed that the last few years have seen significant 
growth in connections between these two groups.  Social 
interaction has become increasingly common, 
particularly among younger members of the two groups 
who use Hebrew as a common language.  Dr. Nizhnik also 
noted that cooperation in illegal activities between 
the two groups has also been on the rise.  A November 
4, 2004 article in Ha\'aretz noted that nearly 30 
percent of police investigations opened on youth 
involve immigrant youth, even though they constitute 
only 12 percent of this sector of the population. 
 
9. Dr. Nizhnik pointed out that although these new 
immigrants are able to come to Israel on the basis of 
their Jewish ancestry, many of them did not think of 
themselves as being Jewish before emigrating, and this 
self-image does not change when they come here.  She 
observed that among some of the younger immigrants she 
has interviewed, they not only retain their self- 
identity as Christians when they immigrate, they also 
retain the anti-Semitic biases that they learned in 
their home countries. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
There are Russian Israelis, and then there are Russian 
Israelis 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
10. The nature of the relationship between Russian 
Israelis who arrived in the early 1990\'s and those who 
have arrived since 2000 depends greatly on where they 
live, but overall Dr. Nizhnik described this 
relationship as being fraught with tension.  Those who 
have successfully integrated themselves into mainstream 
Israeli society strive to set themselves apart in every 
way possible from the newcomers they see as being non- 
Russian and non-Jewish.  They are also acutely aware of 
the general perception of the newcomer population as 
bringing criminal activity into neighborhoods and 
schools.  Dr. Nizhnik also noted that the last general 
elections in Israel saw a startling development which, 
although quite small in numbers, could be the beginning 
of an interesting trend: a very small percentage of 
integrated Russian Israelis voted for the ultra- 
conservative party Shas because of Shas\'s objective of 
overhauling the Law of Return to make the definition of 
who is qualified to immigrate to Israel more strict - 
which would disqualify many of those immigrating today.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media led with last night\'s defeat of PM Sharon in 
the Knesset vote on the 2005 state budget, which was 
rejected 69-43.  Eight Knesset members were absent. 
Only Likud and United Torah Judaism (UTJ) voted in 
favor of the bill.  Immediately afterwards, Sharon 
fired the five Shinui cabinet ministers.  All media 
reported on the expected negotiations with the Labor 
Party and other parties (notably Shas and UTJ) toward a 
national-unity government.  Ha\'aretz quoted senior 
Likud members as saying that Sharon will be hard- 
pressed to expand the government without Shas.  At a 
news conference this afternoon, Sharon hinted that 
Labor would enter his government, and announced that 
cabinet minister Tzipi Livni would become acting 
justice minister. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio quoted President Bush as 
saying Wednesday in Halifax, Canada, that the way to 
resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is to promote 
Palestinian democracy, not by pressuring the parties 
regarding particular border routes or settlement sites. 
\"This approach has been tried before without success,\" 
said Bush, adding, \"The Palestinian people deserve a 
peaceful government that truly serves their interests, 
and the Israeli people need a true partner in peace.\" 
 
Israel Radio quoted Secretary of State Colin Powell as 
saying that the decision announced Wednesday by Marwan 
Barghouti to run as an independent candidate for PA 
chairmanship may be \"problematic.\"  Leading media cited 
criticism of Barghouti\'s move within Fatah. 
 
The media reported that Israel and Egypt agreed 
Wednesday on the deployment of 750 Egyptian troops 
along the Gaza-Egypt border.  Ha\'aretz reported that 
Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman and FM Ahmed 
Abu el-Gheit proposed at high-level talks in Jerusalem 
Wednesday that Israel pull out from the entire 
\"Philadelphi Route\" and help bolster the new 
Palestinian leadership\'s efforts to maintain calm by 
refraining from assassination operations, demolishing 
homes and entering cities in the territories.   The 
media quoted Sharon as saying that a withdrawal from 
Philadelphi would only be possible if the arms 
smuggling from Egypt stops.  Leading media cited FM 
Silvan Shalom\'s response: \"Where there is no terror, 
there will also be quiet, but a hudna [truce] is a time 
bomb.  We favor quiet, but that\'s not a solution, 
merely postponing the inevitable.\"  Leading media 
reported that Egypt and Israel will exchange letters 
about the redeployment in order to avoid amending the 
peace treaty, which currently allows Egypt to deploy 
only civilian police in the region.  Ha\'aretz quoted 
Suleiman as saying the deployment could occur in 
January.  Israel Radio quoted Palestinian FM Nabil 
Shaath as saying that, in talks with PLO Chairman 
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), Hamas\'s leaders have agreed 
to a mutual truce with Israel, when it resumes its 
negotiations with the Palestinians. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz as 
saying Wednesday that Israel hopes that the new 
Palestinian leadership to emerge from the January 9 
elections will prove to be a true partner and ready to 
embark on dialogue. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Israeli officials as saying that the 
real reason for the cancellation of the visit of Deputy 
U.S. National Security Advisor Steve Hadley to the 
region was probably the absence of senior PA officials 
from the region and the political crisis in Israel. 
The officials were quoted as saying that the U.S. also 
feared that an American embrace would hurt the new 
Palestinian leadership.  Ha\'aretz reported that Elliott 
Abrams, Special Assistant to the President and Senior 
Director of the National Security Council for Near East 
and North African Affairs, will make a private visit to 
Israel this weekend, where he will also hold diplomatic 
talks. 
 
Ha\'aretz (Akiva Eldar) reported that Palestinian PM 
Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) wrote a letter two weeks ago to 
the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) coordinating donor- 
nation funding to the territories, in which he 
expressed concern over the possibility that the AHLC 
conference to be held next week in Oslo \"may have the 
effect of reinforcing Israel\'s unilateral acts and 
further harm prospects for a viable solution to the 
conflict by focusing on short-term needs in the Gaza 
Strip without sufficient attention to the West Bank.\" 
 
Leading media reported that Sharon and Shalom have 
denied a report published in Maariv Wednesday that 
Israel ignored Syrian President Bashar Assad\'s 
readiness to come to Jerusalem and speak to the Knesset 
as a first step toward renewing peace talks.  The media 
quoted Egyptian FM Ahmed Abu el-Gheit as saying 
Wednesday that he did not bring any message from Syria 
to Israel.  Eytan Bentsur, who was Foreign Ministry D-G 
between 1996 and 2000 and who represented Israel in 
talks with Syrian officials a year and a half ago, 
confirmed in various media that Assad had agreed to 
come to Jerusalem.  Maariv quoted senior Israeli 
defense establishment sources as saying that Israel 
should not turn a blind eye to Assad. 
Leading media reported that FBI officials searched the 
Washington offices of the American Israel Public 
Affairs Committee (AIPAC) on Wednesday.  Israel Radio 
and Jerusalem Post\'s and Ha\'aretz\'s web sites reported 
that the FBI issued subpoenas to four senior AIPAC 
officials requesting that they appear before a grand 
jury, possibly in relation with the alleged leaking of 
materials to Israel by Pentagon official Larry 
Franklin.  The FBI officials also seized computer files 
from senior AIPAC employees Steve Rosen and Keith 
Weissman.  Yediot quoted GOI sources in Jerusalem as 
saying that Israel does not spy in the U.S. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Israel Police and the 
Prisons Service are asking the GOI for 470 million 
shekels (around USD 107 million) for carrying out the 
evacuation of settlers in accordance with the 
disengagement plan. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the World Bank wants to 
condition increased international aid to the 
Palestinians upon a series of measures to be taken by 
Israel and the PA, according to a report it issued on 
Wednesday, ahead of the conference of PA donor 
countries in Norway next week.  Israel Radio says that, 
according to the World Bank report, Israel will allow 
35,000 Palestinians to continue working in the country 
for another four years. 
 
Jerusalem Post notes that the members of the delegation 
of U.S. Senators who ended their visit to Israel on 
Wednesday have made upbeat declarations about peace 
prospects in the Middle East. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that the UN Relief and Works 
Agency (UNRWA) has defied orders by the Jerusalem 
Municipality to stop illegal construction inside its 
Jerusalem compound. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that Wednesday the 
Knesset plenum narrowly rejected a law that would allow 
the Israel Lands Administration to build communities 
for Jews only. 
 
Leading media reported that Tuesday Knesset Member 
Rabbi Michael Melchior (Labor Party-Meimad) created a 
new social movement, \"Tnufa\" (Momentum), which he said 
might run for the Knesset in the future. 
 
Maariv reported that Saudi Arabia\'s King Saud 
University has started offering Hebrew classes, which 
are currently attended by 20 students.  The teachers 
are Hebrew speaking Jordanians and Egyptians.  The 
newspaper quoted a Saudi source as saying that it is 
important to learn Hebrew in order to acquire first- 
hand knowledge about the Jews. 
 
Yediot cited a poll conducted in Germany by Bielefeld 
University researchers, according to which over 52 
percent of Germans believe that Israel\'s actions in the 
territories are not different in principle than what 
the Third Reich did to the Jews.  Almost 70 percent of 
Germans said that Israel is fighting a \"war of 
extermination\" against the Palestinians.  The results 
of the survey will be published today in Berlin, at a 
conference conducted by bodies fighting the far Right 
in Germany.

editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (December 2): \"A public opinion poll 
[published Wednesday in Yediot Aharonot] found that a 
huge majority [of Israelis] opposes the holding of 
elections at this time, and that the three largest 
parties [Likud, Labor and Shinui] together enjoy a 
sweeping majority among voters.  It apparently is no 
coincidence that the percentage of support for those 
parties is similar to that of Israelis who support a 
disengagement from the Gaza Strip.  The clear inference 
of this is that a government formed by the three large 
parties might relieve Israeli politics from its 
predicament.... Very unfortunately, the establishment 
of such a government is not possible, since Sharon 
can\'t manage to subdue the branch of his party that 
opposes an exaggerated veering of the government to the 
left.  In order to assuage that branch\'s hostility to 
the Labor Party, Sharon has sacrificed Shinui, and 
bought the support of United Torah Judaism; in order to 
stabilize his government, he intends to invite Shas, an 
opponent of disengagement.... It seems that there has 
never been such a wide gap between a majority of 
Israelis, which is averse to this coalition, and the 
Knesset members who have brought it about.\" 
 
II.  \"Edging Back Toward the UN\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 2): 
\"Reading the United Nations resolutions on the Middle 
East is a difficult experience for Israel.... [Yet,] 
Israel has chalked up a few points at the General 
Assembly this year.  For the first time the resolutions 
state that they are \'gravely concerned\' about \'suicide 
terror attacks against Israelis,\' without mentioning 
their Palestinian perpetrators, and condemn anti- 
Semitism.  At the Foreign Ministry they are proud of 
the achievement.  But in diplomacy there are no free 
lunches, and in return for a certain softening of the 
criticism of Israel\'s behavior in the territories -- 
the \'military actions\' instead of the \'military 
attacks,\' for example -- the condemnation of the Jewish 
settlements in the territories has become more 
severe.... A tactic of dealing with clauses and 
formulations is not enough.  Israel needs a strategic 
change in its attitude toward the UN.  Is it perhaps 
worth accepting the applicability of the Geneva 
Conventions to the territories, instead of opposing 
this and being subjected to repeated condemnations?.... 
A government that has dared to initiate an evacuation 
of settlements is able also to reexamine its attitude 
toward the international community.  And just as the 
disengagement plan has improved Israel\'s international 
standing, it can also enjoy the fruit of a bolder 
diplomacy.\"

2.  Syrian-Lebanese Track: 
-------------------------- 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot: \"If [Bashar Assad] means a frozen peace 
devoid of legitimacy and bordering on hostility, as we 
have with Egypt, perhaps it is preferable for Israel to 
have the present situation, both stability and 
territory, remain in place.\"

                     ------------- 
 
\"Bashar\'s Photo-Op\" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot (December 2): \"The urgency that has now come 
over Assad stems from the fact that George Bush was re- 
elected to the U.S. presidency, contrary to the hopes 
of the Syrian President.  Washington may therefore 
remember Syria\'s membership in the \'axis of evil\' and 
acting accordingly.... Perhaps Syria thinks that Israel 
is like Lebanon, with which it made a \'fraternity and 
friendship agreement\' and in practice subjugated it to 
its authority.... If Israel understands that Bashar 
Assad is only interested in using it and being saved, 
without paying anything in return, he should be 
reminded of his father\'s favorite rule: there are no 
free lunches.  Syria continues to act as a lawbreaking 
state, and therefore its regime has no legitimacy.... 
After four years of Intifada, burning Arab hatred 
unparalleled in the past, and deception, Israel has 
matured.  It no longer automatically buys into the 
peace mumblings of Arab dictators, who do so at its 
expense solely for their own benefit.  Irrespective of 
... three conditions that should be posed to Bashar 
[regarding the removal of Palestinian terror groups 
from Syria, the disarming of Hizbullah, and the removal 
of the Syrian troops from Lebanon], let the Syrian 
president be kind enough to make it clear in his own 
words what he means by \'peace\' with Israel.  If he 
means a frozen peace devoid of legitimacy and bordering 
on hostility, as we have with Egypt, perhaps it is 
preferable for Israel to have the present situation, 
both stability and territory, remain in place.\"

SUBJECT: ISRAELI MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE U.S. 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
 
 
1. Summary: The Israeli media followed the U.S. 
Presidential elections with great interest.  From the 
campaign through to the aftermath, commentators focused 
their attention on several issues: the prospects for 
changes in U.S.-Israel policy, the likelihood of 
broader changes in U.S. policy in the Middle East, and 
the impact of the Jewish vote in the United States. 
End summary. 
 
2. The 2004 U.S. Presidential elections attracted a 
great deal of interest among the Israeli media.  As 
Israel\'s most important strategic and political ally, 
the U.S. is typically followed quite closely in the 
Israeli press.  From the primary campaigns, and 
particularly since the two party conventions, Israeli 
media covered the elections with great interest. 
Coverage of the campaign and the elections was almost 
daily, with both factual reporting and 
commentary/analysis provided by journalists of all 
levels, academics, experts in various fields, former 
ambassadors, and a very strong contingent of Israeli 
correspondents in the U.S.

Coverage of the campaign - Run-up to the Run-off 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
23. The 2004 U.S. Presidential elections attracted a 
great deal of interest among the Israeli media.  As 
Israel\'s most important strategic and political ally, 
the U.S. is typically followed quite closely in the 
Israeli press.  By the Democratic and Republican Party 
conventions this summer, coverage of the campaign in 
the Israeli media had become almost daily, with both 
factual reporting and commentary/analysis provided by 
journalists of all levels, academics, experts in 
various fields, former ambassadors, and a very strong 
contingent of Israeli correspondents in the U.S.  In 
addition to reporting on campaign activity, the Israeli 
media focused on several key areas of U.S. policy and 
the prospective impact of the election on these areas: 
the U.S.-Israel bilateral relationship, Middle East 
policy, U.S. relations with Europe, and the U.S. 
economy. 
 
3. In terms of the U.S.-Israel bilateral relationship, 
the Israeli media overwhelmingly agreed that the first 
Bush administration had been a good friend to Israel. 
\"Conventional wisdom in Israel,\" wrote a senior 
columnist from pluralist Yediot Aharonot on November 1, 
\"is that Bush was and will be the ideal American 
president from Israel\'s perspective.  The best there 
is.  Israel has no interest in seeing him replaced, and 
it has every interest in seeing him reelected.\"  Most 
commentators agreed, however, that both candidates 
shared a political record of support for Israel - for 
better or for worse.  A senior columnist for left-wing 
Ha\'aretz observed on October 18 that \"regardless of 
whether Bush is reelected or John Kerry takes his 
place, there will be no `pressure\' from America\" in 
terms of U.S.-Israel relations. 
 
4. Journalists also felt that regardless of the outcome 
of the elections, they were likely to mark the end of a 
lull in Middle East policy.  A diplomatic correspondent 
for Ha\'aretz noted on October 22 that \"The elections in 
the United States are fast approaching, and the 
diplomatic arena is waking up and issuing calls to 
increase international involvement in the Israeli- 
Palestinian conflict, which has vanished from both 
candidates\' agendas.  Once again the familiar slogans 
are surfacing, about how stability and quiet in the 
land of Israel are essential to the security of the 
entire world, and about how the time has come to 
implement the international road map plan and get on 
with the establishment of the Palestinian state 
alongside Israel. [...] The publication of the 
disengagement plan and the close race in the elections 
in the U.S. have afforded Israel a year of relative 
freedom from international pressure. [...] Now the 
moment of truth is approaching.\"  In early November, 
many newspapers published articles citing a Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs report on the likely outcome of the 
election, and the implications of that outcome for both 
Israel and the Middle East. 
54. Particular attention was also paid in the Israeli 
press to the Jewish vote in the U.S., especially in the 
English-language newspapers.  An October 22 editorial 
in left-wing Ha\'aretz claims that \"as the election 
wooing demonstrates, the Jewish vote has not lost its 
force.  And it seems that more than ever before, the 
world is keeping an eye on the Jewish vote.\"  In 
response to the question \"So for whom should a Jew in 
America vote?\" raised in a front-page article in 
Ha\'aretz on October 22, the author points out that \"the 
safest vote, in terms of Israel, is a vote for Bush.\" 
The Israeli media closely tracked exit poll results, 
reporting on November 4 that President Bush had 
received 22 percent of the Jewish vote.  Several 
newspapers front-paged their analyses of these results, 
sharing the opinion that Bush\'s perception as the more 
pro-Israel of the two candidates had a great deal to do 
with his 3 percentage point increase among Jewish 
voters.  Ha\'aretz quoted a Jewish voter in Brooklyn, NY 
as saying \"I don\'t see how any Jew could not support 
Bush.\"  The Jewish communities in swing states such as 
Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio were also covered; as 
Ha\'aretz noted on November 4, \"had [the Kerry campaign] 
only persuaded a number of Jewish retirees [...] in 
southern Florida, Massachusetts senator John Kerry 
would have been elected president.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
(Maybe a Subtitle Here on Absentee 
Voting???\"Unprecedented Voter Turnout among 
Expatriates\" 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
65. Coverage was also given, particularly in the 
English-language press, to the sizable American-Israeli 
community and the logistical issues surrounding 
absentee voting, for which eligible voters in Israel 
registered in record numbers this year.  Throughout 
most of September and October, the organizations 
representing the two parties in Israel, Democrats 
Abroad and Republicans Abroad, also ran advertisements 
in the English-language dailies on a regular basis 
reminding readers to register for absentee ballots and 
announcing events at which eligible voters could come 
to fill out applications for absentee ballots.  Both 
organizations reported unprecedented interest in 
absentee voting this year.  ((Is there any info on 
problems that absentee voters here had?  It might be 
interesting to note either way, given the coverage the 
issue received in ither countries.  Just a thought.))A 
Ha\'aretz article from October 29 observed that 
\"Estimates for the number of votes cast from Israel 
vary, but even the lowest account - some 30,000 votes - 
is more than double the voter turnout four years ago. 
Some estimates for the upcoming elections go as high as 
60,000 ballots.\"  The two major English-language 
dailies, Jerusalem Post and Ha\'aretz\'s English edition, 
both paid close attention to difficulties experienced 
by would-be absentee voters who did not receive their 
requested ballots in time to vote.  Both newspapers 
noted the extremely high demand for the Federal Write- 
In Absentee Ballot this year, and cited both in 
articles and in paid advertisements that the American 
Citizen Services units of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv 
and the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem offered 
extended hours to address the \"increased demand for 
voter assistance.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
November 2-3: Intense Coverage in the Electronic Media 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
76. The electronic media also showed great interest in 
the U.S. elections.  Although three channels (Channels 
1, 2, and 10) have Washington-based correspondents, 
they all in addition sent top journalists to cover 
other angles of the elections, such as showing coverage 
of the results from Kerry\'s headquarters in Boston. 
Most of these journalists left for the U.S. at least a 
week in advance of the elections and broadcast daily 
reports from the country.  On the day of the elections 
(November 2) all TV stations had extensive reports on 
their daily TV news shows covering the election 
results, including interviews with people on the 
streets, and footage from the U.S. and different 
experts.  At 10:00pm local time Channel 1 held a 
special program, \"America is Choosing,\" and Channel 2 
had a \"special U.S. elections\" program.  Coverage 
resumed early on the morning of November 3.  All three 
channels had special U.S. elections programs that began 
at 06:00am local time and lasted for at least three 
hours.  This coverage of the results continued 
throughout the day with special news bulletins and 
extended news programs.  All the news programs included 
round tables hosting U.S. experts, the station\'s 
various commentators, Israeli officials; the topics 
discussed were U.S.-Israeli relations; Arab world 
response, Middle East peace process and more.  Local 
radio stations (Israel Radio and IDF Radio) extensively 
reported on the results as they came in during their 
regular morning news shows.  The stations hosted 
experts and aired their analyses of all possible 
scenarios, discussing the technicalities of the 
Electoral College, the rules surrounding Ohio\'s 
provisional ballots, etc. 
 
--------------------------------- 
\"The Sigh of Relief in Jerusalem\" 
--------------------------------- 
 
87. Commentary on the results of the U.S. elections 
began on November 4 and remained a major topic for 
several days before being eclipsed by news related to 
Yasser Arafat\'s health.  The media generally agreed 
that Israeli officials were relieved to learn of Bush\'s 
re-election.  Senior columnists for pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot wrote that \"When it became clear that [Bush] 
would remain in the White House for another four years, 
many figures in the political establishment allowed 
themselves a broad smile of relief.\"  A senior analyst 
for the mass-circulation daily Maariv wrote that \"The 
sign of relief in Jerusalem yesterday was heard all the 
way to Washington.\"  In his front-page analysis in left- 
wing Ha\'aretz, Aluf Benn observed that \"Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon gambled big time on George Bush, and 
wasn\'t disappointed.  Sharon maintained a public 
distance from the U.S. presidential campaign, focusing 
in recent months on domestic matters, but everyone knew 
which candidate had his vote.  The alliance with Bush 
was the cornerstone of Sharon\'s policy from the day he 
took office, and he stuck to it.\" 
 
98. Most commentary explored the implications of Bush\'s 
re-election for U.S. policy in the Middle East, noting 
that the tenor of the relationship between the U.S. and 
Israel would be subject to change.  \"Senior political 
sources believe that Bush, in his second term of 
office, free from the shackles of the Jewish vote, will 
be much more involved in events of the Middle East,\" 
wrote senior columnists Itamar Eichner and Orly Azulai 
of Yediot Aharonot.  \"The political sources fear that 
Bush could try to rehabilitate his relations with 
Europe and the Arab world and buy quiet in Iraq - at 
Israel\'s expense.\"  Senior analyst Ben Caspit of Maariv 
concurred: \"We have won, but now we will pay dearly for 
it, because George Bush in his second term could be 
much more dangerous than George Bush in his first.  It 
should not be forgotten that Bush\'s love affair with 
Sharon came late, and not before Bush had wagged his 
finger and threatened quite a few times.. Throughout 
his first term in office Bush was planning how he would 
get to his second.  He knew he would need Jewish money 
and votes.  Now, throughout his second term, he will be 
planning how he is going to go down in history.  To 
make history he has to get out of Iraq honorably, win 
the war on terrorism, and reduce tension in America. 
Of course, he will not be able to do all of that by 
himself.  Bush will have to mend his bridges with the 
world, to conciliate with Europe, and to prove to the 
Moslem world that he has not declared a crusade against 
it.  The price tag for all these initiatives is simple: 
pressure on Israel.  Bush can deliver the goods at our 
expense, and the pressure on him to do so will be 
considerable.\" 
 
109. Reflecting a more skeptical minority view from the 
left, commentator Ben-Dror Yemini of Maariv went 
further, suggesting that a more demanding U.S. policy 
would be a good thing for Israel: \"Bush\'s total support 
for Sharon does not help us to achieve the important 
Zionist aim of a democratic Jewish state.  A little 
more American pressure on the issue of the settlement 
outposts would help us in the struggle against the 
creeping realization of \"Greater Palestine\" of [...] 
\"Greater Israel.\"  .\" ((Ruth Anne - i realize this is a 
quote but it does not actually make sense to say both 
\"Greaters\" here.  Maybe paraphrase would be clearer? 
But America\'s complacency is leading to two 
consequences: first, it has given the establishment of 
new outposts a tail wind, and secondly, it has 
exacerbated hostility toward the United States.  The 
West has to support Israel.  But the West is divided, 
partly thanks to Bush.  We would be better served by a 
West united in support for Israel on the basis of a two- 
state solution, one of thethat is ((same here)) Jewish 
and democratic,[...] than a fragmented West in which 
Bush remains president and consequently that solution 
becomes even more remote.\" 
 
11. Comment: The intense scrutiny paid to the U.S. 
Presidential elections by the Israeli media is 
reflective of nothing more or less than the vital 
importance that Israel attaches to its relationship 
with the United States.  The broad range of commentary 
on the campaign and the elections simply amplified the 
ongoing discussion in the Israeli media about the 
nature of this relationship.  End comment.

------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media, except Yediot and Maariv, led with PM 
Sharon\'s efforts to form a new coalition.  Leading 
media reported that Sharon intends to ask Labor Party 
Chairman Shimon Peres to run the country with him in a 
new \"super-deputy partnership,\" that would grant Peres 
vast powers, far beyond those enjoyed by any No. 2 in 
the past.  Ha\'aretz quoted senior Likud and Labor Party 
sources as saying that Sharon and Peres have agreed in 
principle that if a national unity government is 
formed, it will last until November 2006 -- when 
elections are scheduled to be held.  The media cited 
Sharon\'s portrayal of past cooperation between Likud 
and Labor, and between their predecessor movements. 
Ha\'aretz quoted Peres as saying Thursday that the year 
2005 must be devoted to advancing the diplomatic 
process with the Palestinians and not wasted on 
elections and internal party squabbling. 
 
Maariv quoted National Security Advisor and secretary 
of state-designate Condoleezza Rice as saying this week 
in a private meeting that the U.S. will increase its 
involvement in the Middle East, placing an emphasis on 
the PA election, and that the U.S. will not accept 
nuclear weapons in the hands of Iran. 
 
Yediot bannered Hamas\'s mulling over the cessation of 
attacks against Israel -- a development also reported 
on by other media.  Hatzofe cited a document seized 
from the Palestinians in Gaza in 2002, which contains 
the protocol of a secret meeting between Alistair 
Crook, who was security advisor to then EU envoy to the 
Middle East Miguel Angel Moratinos, with a Hamas 
delegation headed by the late Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. 
 
Maariv led with Sharon\'s declaration at the PM\'s 
traditional annual meeting with media editors in Tel 
Aviv Thursday that Syria will find in Israel a partner 
for peace if it serious, and that he is prepared to 
meet with Syrian President Bashar Assad under \"certain 
conditions.\"  All media cited the response of Syrian FM 
Farouk Shara that Syria is prepared to resume talks 
with Israel, but without preconditions.  Israel Radio 
quoted State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher as 
saying Thursday that the U.S. has always supported the 
idea of comprehensive peace in the Middle East, a 
notion that Secretary Powell reiterated most recently 
in his meetings with Shara when they met in Sharm el- 
Sheikh.   Boucher added: \"We have always believed that 
direct contacts between the parties are very important 
to this process, and so we would encourage any direct 
contacts that the parties feel it\'s appropriate to have 
in order to make progress on comprehensive peace. \" 
 
All media quoted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as 
saying Thursday that only Sharon can lead to peace. 
Ha\'aretz reported that Thursday Sharon\'s bureau played 
down an announcement from Mubarak on the immediate 
release of six students from Cairo charged with 
allegedly planning a terror attack.  Writing that the 
students might be released, Yediot quoted diplomatic 
sources as saying that the improvement of the 
atmosphere between the two countries could advance the 
release of Azzam Azzam, an Israeli Druze who was 
convinced of espionage and imprisoned in Egypt. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Industry and Trade Minister 
Yossi Olmert \"did something Thursday that few 
politicians have dared to do\": he declared publicly 
\"that with all due respect to the U.S. Administration, 
there is a limit to how much Israel will bend to 
maintain the illusion of good relations.\"  Olmert stood 
up for the interests of the Israeli pharmaceutical 
manufacturer Teva and other generic drug makers, as the 
U.S. insisted on protecting the interests of American 
companies that develop drugs from scratch -- known as 
ethical drugs -- and want to delay as much as possible 
Teva\'s development of copycat (generic) versions. 
Although Ha\'aretz writer Ora Coren recognized that the 
ethical drug companies have a justified claim, she 
sided with Olmert\'s approach, which she dubbed \"an 
attempt to balance the Israeli drug industry\'s patent 
protection interests with those of patients and the 
state budget.\" 
 
All media quoted Sharon as saying Thursday that Tanzim 
leader Marwan Barghouti will remain in jail even if the 
is elected as Yasser Arafat\'s successor to head the PA. 
 
Leading media quoted Deputy IDF Chief of Staff Maj. 
Gen. Dan Halutz as saying Thursday that had the IDF 
known that assassinating Hamas leader Salah Shehadeh in 
July 2002 would lead to the death of innocent 
Palestinians, the operation would not have been 
approved.  Halutz, then commander of the IAF, also 
explained that his statement at the time that he \"slept 
well at night\" was intended to back his subordinates in 
the IAF. 
 
Israel Radio reported that this morning mortar shells 
were launched at two Gaza Strip settlements.  The 
station also reported that today south of Jenin IDF 
troops killed Mahmoud Kmel, a senior Islamic Jihad 
activist. 
Yediot (Alex Fishman) reported that, contrary to the 
impression that the evacuation from the northernmost 
part of the West Bank will be a minor operation, Israel 
is examining a plan in which the West Bank would be 
split in two, and Samaria (the northern West Bank) 
\"closed in like a box.\"  In northern Samaria, the PA 
would control an area two-and-a-half times the size of 
that evacuated by Israel in the Gaza Strip. 
 
Israel Radio quoted Palestinian sources a saying that 
IDF soldiers at roadblock in the Gaza Strip had 
prevented a Palestinian delegation including Acting PA 
Chairman Rawhi Fattuh, PA Social Affairs Minister 
Intisar Al-Wazir, and Yasser Arafat\'s sister Hadija, 
from attending the funeral of Arafat\'s brother Fathi, 
who died of cancer in Egypt on Wednesday.  Israel Radio 
reported that an Israeli military source denied to AFP 
that Israel had been apprised of the delegation\'s 
travel. 
 
In interviews with several leading media, UN Middle 
East envoy Terje Roed-Larsen was quoted as saying that 
the chances of reaching a solution to the Israeli- 
Palestinian conflict are better than ever.  Jerusalem 
Post quoted visiting Spanish FM Miguel Angel Moratinos 
as saying that the Intifada was a mistake. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli officials at the UN as 
saying that they are pleased that Canada decided to 
oppose one-sided condemnations of Israel at the UN 
General Assembly, and that a UN panel recommended that 
terrorism, even in cases of national resistance, be 
deemed unacceptable. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited the findings of a Tel Aviv University 
research that every third Israeli has been personally - 
- either directly or indirectly, through the experience 
of relatives and friends -- exposed to terrorist 
attacks, and that every tenth Israeli suffers from a 
post-traumatic syndrome following the attacks. 
 
Yediot prints an AFP picture of women visiting an 
exhibition at a cemetery south of Tehran, which 
includes an alleged picture of corpses of Israelis 
covered with the Israeli flag, next to a poster with 
the Hebrew inscription: \"Israel must be wiped off the 
face of the earth.\" 
 
A Maariv/Teleseker poll: 
-\"Do you believe the IDF is sufficiently attentive to 
the protection of the lives of the Palestinians and 
their respect?\"  Yes: 53 percent; no: 40 percent.

I.  \"A Solution Is Wanting\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 3): \" On 
Monday, America returned to work after the Thanksgiving 
holiday.  A senior administration official -- of those 
who call their Israeli colleagues by their first names 
-- hopped over to New York to outline the new American 
policy for the Middle East at the prestigious Council 
on Foreign Relations.  Those present at the briefing 
heard and recorded: \'Whoever believes in a two-state 
solution cannot support the right of return ... At the 
end of the process, the settlement blocs will remain in 
Israel\'s hands and the rest will not.... The key to 
progress is to build democratic institutions in the 
Palestinian Authority and the war against terror, and 
this depends on the Palestinians.... Israel is not 
acting with sufficient transparency with regard to the 
settlements.\'  These remarks indicate that U.S. 
President George W. Bush\'s plan for a final accord is 
very similar to that of his predecessor, Bill 
Clinton.... From Sharon\'s perspective, there are many 
positive notes now being sounded in Washington.... If 
Sharon has cause for concern, it derives from the 
message expressed by a delegation of senior senators 
who visited him this week.... They explained that, in 
their view, there is a connection between American 
successes in one place and failures in another place. 
Therefore, in order to improve their situation in Iraq 
and increase public support for American activity 
there, some success must be demonstrated in the Israeli- 
Palestinian arena.\" 
 
II.  \"Egypt\'s Seal of Approval\" 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar\'el wrote in 
Ha\'aretz (December 3): \"[On Thursday] Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak described Prime Minister Ariel 
Sharon as the Palestinians\' virtually last hope.  The 
sharp turnabout in Mubarak\'s public stance toward 
Sharon did not begin on Thursday.... The details [of 
Egypt\'s agreement with Israel] -- particularly the 
exchange of letters that would enable Egyptian soldiers 
to be stationed on the Gaza border without amending the 
Camp David Accords -- had been settled three weeks 
earlier via American mediation.  Mubarak\'s declarations 
Thursday are thus a continuation of these official 
steps. They are meant to give legitimacy to Sharon, but 
also to Egypt\'s own diplomatic moves.... Mubarak\'s 
statements were ... a way of \'preparing hearts and 
minds\' for an active Egyptian role in the peace 
process.  This role has gone into high gear since 
Yasser Arafat\'s death, due to the need to influence the 
future structure of the Palestinian Authority. 
However, these statements also reflect an important 
working assumption: that Egypt believes in Sharon\'s 
willingness and ability to implement the disengagement 
plan.... Egypt is once again playing the role for which 
it is most suited: Even when it cannot call the shots, 
it can give them legitimacy.  This is particularly 
important in light of the role that Egypt is expected 
to play in uniting the various Palestinian factions, as 
well as in advancing prospects for negotiations between 
Israel and Syria.\"

\"Larsen\'s Unlearned Lessons\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(December 3): \"While its deniable, privately conveyed, 
overtures to Israel are plainly motivated by a desire 
to ingratiate itself with the U.S., Syria remains a 
major defender and generator of terror.  It may be 
argued that the abandonment of that behavior is just 
what Assad wants to discuss.  Unfortunately, we have 
been through this already, with Arafat, 11 years and 
more than a thousand Israeli fatalities ago.... As long 
as Syria continues to supply Hizbullah and cheer-lead 
Hamas, an Israeli readiness to negotiate will be 
perceived across the Arab world not as rapprochement, 
but as a form of surrender.  Perhaps even worse, Syria 
is a major wellspring of anti-Semitism, unique even for 
the Arab world\'s dictatorships.... [Terje] Roed-Larsen, 
the UN\'s outgoing Middle East peace coordinator, may 
consider that he is offering Israel a farewell gift in 
encouraging us to take Assad\'s overtures seriously.  He 
should know better.  With all due respect, we will 
watch Assad\'s public actions, rather than his efforts 
at Larsen-facilitated private diplomacy.\"

BANK 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 6006 (NOTAL) 
 
Classified By: Econ Counselor William Weinstein, Reasons 1.4b and d. 
 
 1. (C) Summary:  Israeli officials are concerned about water 
wells on the West Bank that have not been approved by the 
Israeli-Palestinian Joint Water Commission. They see the 
illegal wells as a bad precedent for Gaza disengagement, West 
Bank withdrawal,  and eventual negotiations on water issues 
with the Palestinians or neighoring countries.  The MOD Water 
Advisor encouraged the senior security affairs reporter for 
the Haaretz newspaper to report and comment on the issue to 
highlight GOI concerns.  Palestinian water officials have 
acknowledged the problem of uncontrolled wells tapping shared 
aquifers.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The Israeli newspaper Haaretz published an article 
and a separate op-ed piece on the drilling of unauthorized 
wells in the northern West Bank on November 26.  The article, 
\"Water Dispute May Boil Over During Pullout,\" by security 
affairs correspondent Ze-ev Schiff, stated that hundreds of 
unauthorized wells have been drilled in areas from which 
Israel is planning withdrawal of settlements, affecting the 
shared Northeastern Aquifer. (Note:  The wells may be near, 
rather than actually in Israeli-controlled settlement areas. 
End note). 
 
3. (SBU) The article expressed concern that such drilling 
could increase following withdrawal of Israeli forces, and 
noted that new wells require permits from the Joint Water 
Commission.  (Note:  In the near-term, the GOI would retain 
control of former settlement areas in the West Bank, so the 
articles may overstate the probability of new drillings right 
after withdrawal.  End note). Schiff said the Israeli Water 
Commission estimates there have been 150-260 unauthorized 
drillings while the General Staff puts the number as high as 
300. 
 
4. (U) In a signed Op-Ed, \"A Threat to the West Bank 
Pullout,\" Schiff said that drawdowns of shared acquifers was 
a greater concern for Israel for West Bank withdrawals of 
settlements than was the case for disengagement from the Gaza 
Strip.  He quoted Water Advisor to the Minister of Defense 
Noah Kinnarti as saying that a failure to control drillings 
in the Northeast Acquifer could affect future dealings on the 
larger Mountain Aquifer as well as with Syria and Lebanon on 
water issues. 
 
5. (C) Comment:  MOD Advisor Kinnarti told ESTH Officer on 
November 28 that he had encouraged Schiff to write about the 
illegal drillings, saying that Israel\'s credibility was at 
stake.  Earlier, MFA Director for Water Issues told ESTH 
Officer that illegal wells could be a problem following 
disengagement from Gaza, saying that \"2,000\" unauthorized 
wells had been drilled following the 1995 Gaza-Jericho 
Agreement.  Palestinian Water Authority Chief Nabil Sharif 
has acknowledged to USAID officials that uncontrolled 
drilling is a problem.  Besides the issue of living up to 
commitments highlighted by Kinnarti, uncontrolled drilling 
draws down both the inland and Coastal aquifers, causing them 
to draw in brackish and sea waters, diminishing water quality 
for both Israelis and Palestinians.

SUBJECT: ISRAELI MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE U.S. 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
 
 
1. Summary: The Israeli media followed the U.S. 
Presidential elections with great interest.  From the 
campaign through to the aftermath, commentators focused 
their attention on several issues: the prospects for 
changes in U.S.-Israel policy, the likelihood of 
broader changes in U.S. policy in the Middle East, and 
the impact of the Jewish vote in the United States. 
End summary. 
 
2. The 2004 U.S. Presidential elections attracted a 
great deal of interest among the Israeli media.  As 
Israel\'s most important strategic and political ally, 
the U.S. is typically followed quite closely in the 
Israeli press.  From the primary campaigns, and 
particularly since the two party conventions, Israeli 
media covered the elections with great interest. 
Coverage of the campaign and the elections was almost 
daily, with both factual reporting and 
commentary/analysis provided by journalists of all 
levels, academics, experts in various fields, former 
ambassadors, and a very strong contingent of Israeli 
correspondents in the U.S.

Coverage of the campaign - Run-up to the Run-off 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
23. The 2004 U.S. Presidential elections attracted a 
great deal of interest among the Israeli media.  As 
Israel\'s most important strategic and political ally, 
the U.S. is typically followed quite closely in the 
Israeli press.  By the Democratic and Republican Party 
conventions this summer, coverage of the campaign in 
the Israeli media had become almost daily, with both 
factual reporting and commentary/analysis provided by 
journalists of all levels, academics, experts in 
various fields, former ambassadors, and a very strong 
contingent of Israeli correspondents in the U.S.  In 
addition to reporting on campaign activity, the Israeli 
media focused on several key areas of U.S. policy and 
the prospective impact of the election on these areas: 
the U.S.-Israel bilateral relationship, Middle East 
policy, U.S. relations with Europe, and the U.S. 
economy. 
 
3. In terms of the U.S.-Israel bilateral relationship, 
the Israeli media overwhelmingly agreed that the first 
Bush administration had been a good friend to Israel. 
\"Conventional wisdom in Israel,\" wrote a senior 
columnist from pluralist Yediot Aharonot on November 1, 
\"is that Bush was and will be the ideal American 
president from Israel\'s perspective.  The best there 
is.  Israel has no interest in seeing him replaced, and 
it has every interest in seeing him reelected.\"  Most 
commentators agreed, however, that both candidates 
shared a political record of support for Israel - for 
better or for worse.  A senior columnist for left-wing 
Ha\'aretz observed on October 18 that \"regardless of 
whether Bush is reelected or John Kerry takes his 
place, there will be no `pressure\' from America\" in 
terms of U.S.-Israel relations. 
 
4. Journalists also felt that regardless of the outcome 
of the elections, they were likely to mark the end of a 
lull in Middle East policy.  A diplomatic correspondent 
for Ha\'aretz noted on October 22 that \"The elections in 
the United States are fast approaching, and the 
diplomatic arena is waking up and issuing calls to 
increase international involvement in the Israeli- 
Palestinian conflict, which has vanished from both 
candidates\' agendas.  Once again the familiar slogans 
are surfacing, about how stability and quiet in the 
land of Israel are essential to the security of the 
entire world, and about how the time has come to 
implement the international road map plan and get on 
with the establishment of the Palestinian state 
alongside Israel. [...] The publication of the 
disengagement plan and the close race in the elections 
in the U.S. have afforded Israel a year of relative 
freedom from international pressure. [...] Now the 
moment of truth is approaching.\"  In early November, 
many newspapers published articles citing a Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs report on the likely outcome of the 
election, and the implications of that outcome for both 
Israel and the Middle East. 
 
54. Particular attention was also paid in the Israeli 
press to the Jewish vote in the U.S., especially in the 
English-language newspapers.  An October 22 editorial 
in left-wing Ha\'aretz claims that \"as the election 
wooing demonstrates, the Jewish vote has not lost its 
force.  And it seems that more than ever before, the 
world is keeping an eye on the Jewish vote.\"  In 
response to the question \"So for whom should a Jew in 
America vote?\" raised in a front-page article in 
Ha\'aretz on October 22, the author points out that \"the 
safest vote, in terms of Israel, is a vote for Bush.\" 
The Israeli media closely tracked exit poll results, 
reporting on November 4 that President Bush had 
received 22 percent of the Jewish vote.  Several 
newspapers front-paged their analyses of these results, 
sharing the opinion that Bush\'s perception as the more 
pro-Israel of the two candidates had a great deal to do 
with his 3 percentage point increase among Jewish 
voters.  Ha\'aretz quoted a Jewish voter in Brooklyn, NY 
as saying \"I don\'t see how any Jew could not support 
Bush.\"  The Jewish communities in swing states such as 
Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio were also covered; as 
Ha\'aretz noted on November 4, \"had [the Kerry campaign] 
only persuaded a number of Jewish retirees [...] in 
southern Florida, Massachusetts senator John Kerry 
would have been elected president.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
(Maybe a Subtitle Here on Absentee 
Voting???\"Unprecedented Voter Turnout among 
Expatriates\" 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
65. Coverage was also given, particularly in the 
English-language press, to the sizable American-Israeli 
community and the logistical issues surrounding 
absentee voting, for which eligible voters in Israel 
registered in record numbers this year.  Throughout 
most of September and October, the organizations 
representing the two parties in Israel, Democrats 
Abroad and Republicans Abroad, also ran advertisements 
in the English-language dailies on a regular basis 
reminding readers to register for absentee ballots and 
announcing events at which eligible voters could come 
to fill out applications for absentee ballots.  Both 
organizations reported unprecedented interest in 
absentee voting this year.  ((Is there any info on 
problems that absentee voters here had?  It might be 
interesting to note either way, given the coverage the 
issue received in ither countries.  Just a thought.))A 
Ha\'aretz article from October 29 observed that 
\"Estimates for the number of votes cast from Israel 
vary, but even the lowest account - some 30,000 votes - 
is more than double the voter turnout four years ago. 
Some estimates for the upcoming elections go as high as 
60,000 ballots.\"  The two major English-language 
dailies, Jerusalem Post and Ha\'aretz\'s English edition, 
both paid close attention to difficulties experienced 
by would-be absentee voters who did not receive their 
requested ballots in time to vote.  Both newspapers 
noted the extremely high demand for the Federal Write- 
In Absentee Ballot this year, and cited both in 
articles and in paid advertisements that the American 
Citizen Services units of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv 
and the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem offered 
extended hours to address the \"increased demand for 
voter assistance.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
November 2-3: Intense Coverage in the Electronic Media 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
76. The electronic media also showed great interest in 
the U.S. elections.  Although three channels (Channels 
1, 2, and 10) have Washington-based correspondents, 
they all in addition sent top journalists to cover 
other angles of the elections, such as showing coverage 
of the results from Kerry\'s headquarters in Boston. 
Most of these journalists left for the U.S. at least a 
week in advance of the elections and broadcast daily 
reports from the country.  On the day of the elections 
(November 2) all TV stations had extensive reports on 
their daily TV news shows covering the election 
results, including interviews with people on the 
streets, and footage from the U.S. and different 
experts.  At 10:00pm local time Channel 1 held a 
special program, \"America is Choosing,\" and Channel 2 
had a \"special U.S. elections\" program.  Coverage 
resumed early on the morning of November 3.  All three 
channels had special U.S. elections programs that began 
at 06:00am local time and lasted for at least three 
hours.  This coverage of the results continued 
throughout the day with special news bulletins and 
extended news programs.  All the news programs included 
round tables hosting U.S. experts, the station\'s 
various commentators, Israeli officials; the topics 
discussed were U.S.-Israeli relations; Arab world 
response, Middle East peace process and more.  Local 
radio stations (Israel Radio and IDF Radio) extensively 
reported on the results as they came in during their 
regular morning news shows.  The stations hosted 
experts and aired their analyses of all possible 
scenarios, discussing the technicalities of the 
Electoral College, the rules surrounding Ohio\'s 
provisional ballots, etc. 
 
--------------------------------- 
\"The Sigh of Relief in Jerusalem\" 
--------------------------------- 
 
87. Commentary on the results of the U.S. elections 
began on November 4 and remained a major topic for 
several days before being eclipsed by news related to 
Yasser Arafat\'s health.  The media generally agreed 
that Israeli officials were relieved to learn of Bush\'s 
re-election.  Senior columnists for pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot wrote that \"When it became clear that [Bush] 
would remain in the White House for another four years, 
many figures in the political establishment allowed 
themselves a broad smile of relief.\"  A senior analyst 
for the mass-circulation daily Maariv wrote that \"The 
sign of relief in Jerusalem yesterday was heard all the 
way to Washington.\"  In his front-page analysis in left- 
wing Ha\'aretz, Aluf Benn observed that \"Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon gambled big time on George Bush, and 
wasn\'t disappointed.  Sharon maintained a public 
distance from the U.S. presidential campaign, focusing 
in recent months on domestic matters, but everyone knew 
which candidate had his vote.  The alliance with Bush 
was the cornerstone of Sharon\'s policy from the day he 
took office, and he stuck to it.\" 
 
98. Most commentary explored the implications of Bush\'s 
re-election for U.S. policy in the Middle East, noting 
that the tenor of the relationship between the U.S. and 
Israel would be subject to change.  \"Senior political 
sources believe that Bush, in his second term of 
office, free from the shackles of the Jewish vote, will 
be much more involved in events of the Middle East,\" 
wrote senior columnists Itamar Eichner and Orly Azulai 
of Yediot Aharonot.  \"The political sources fear that 
Bush could try to rehabilitate his relations with 
Europe and the Arab world and buy quiet in Iraq - at 
Israel\'s expense.\"  Senior analyst Ben Caspit of Maariv 
concurred: \"We have won, but now we will pay dearly for 
it, because George Bush in his second term could be 
much more dangerous than George Bush in his first.  It 
should not be forgotten that Bush\'s love affair with 
Sharon came late, and not before Bush had wagged his 
finger and threatened quite a few times.. Throughout 
his first term in office Bush was planning how he would 
get to his second.  He knew he would need Jewish money 
and votes.  Now, throughout his second term, he will be 
planning how he is going to go down in history.  To 
make history he has to get out of Iraq honorably, win 
the war on terrorism, and reduce tension in America. 
Of course, he will not be able to do all of that by 
himself.  Bush will have to mend his bridges with the 
world, to conciliate with Europe, and to prove to the 
Moslem world that he has not declared a crusade against 
it.  The price tag for all these initiatives is simple: 
pressure on Israel.  Bush can deliver the goods at our 
expense, and the pressure on him to do so will be 
considerable.\" 
 
109. Reflecting a more skeptical minority view from the 
left, commentator Ben-Dror Yemini of Maariv went 
further, suggesting that a more demanding U.S. policy 
would be a good thing for Israel: \"Bush\'s total support 
for Sharon does not help us to achieve the important 
Zionist aim of a democratic Jewish state.  A little 
more American pressure on the issue of the settlement 
outposts would help us in the struggle against the 
creeping realization of \"Greater Palestine\" of [...] 
\"Greater Israel.\"  .\" ((Ruth Anne - i realize this is a 
quote but it does not actually make sense to say both 
\"Greaters\" here.  Maybe paraphrase would be clearer? 
But America\'s complacency is leading to two 
consequences: first, it has given the establishment of 
new outposts a tail wind, and secondly, it has 
exacerbated hostility toward the United States.  The 
West has to support Israel.  But the West is divided, 
partly thanks to Bush.  We would be better served by a 
West united in support for Israel on the basis of a two- 
state solution, one of thethat is ((same here)) Jewish 
and democratic,[...] than a fragmented West in which 
Bush remains president and consequently that solution 
becomes even more remote.\" 
 
11. Comment: The intense scrutiny paid to the U.S. 
Presidential elections by the Israeli media is 
reflective of nothing more or less than the vital 
importance that Israel attaches to its relationship 
with the United States.  The broad range of commentary 
on the campaign and the elections simply amplified the 
ongoing discussion in the Israeli media about the 
nature of this relationship.  End comment.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media led with the release Sunday of Azzam Azzam, 
the Israeli Druze who was convicted of espionage in 
Egypt, where he was spent eight years in jail.  He was 
exchanged for six Egyptian students who were captured 
in August on suspicion of planning terrorist attacks in 
southern Israel.  Ha\'aretz reported that Israel also 
stated that it is considering the release of dozens of 
Palestinian prisoners who do not have \"blood on their 
hands.\"  Ha\'aretz quoted PM Sharon as saying Sunday 
that Egypt believes in the seriousness of his 
disengagement plan and wants to contribute to it.  The 
newspaper quoted Foreign Ministry sources as saying 
that Egypt would probably appoint an ambassador to 
Israel after the elections in the PA on January 9. 
This morning, Israel Radio quoted FM Silvan Shalom as 
saying that over the past Israel has successfully been 
coordinating its disengagement plan with Egypt. 
Several media reported that right-wing groups 
questioned how it is possible that Israel can negotiate 
and swap prisoners with Egypt but not with its closest 
ally, the U.S. -- referring to Jonathan Pollard. 
 
Israel Radio cited London\'s Daily Telegraph as saying 
that late this month or early next month, a conference 
of Middle Eastern leaders, probably at foreign-minister 
level, will convene in London.  The Daily Telegraph 
quoted an Israeli source as saying that, should Marwan 
Barghouti be elected PA chairman, the conference would 
not take place.   Israel Radio reported that efforts 
are going on within Fatah to convince Barghouti to 
renounce his candidacy. 
 
On Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that Palestinian PM 
Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) on Saturday accused Israel of 
escalating tensions by pursuing its policy of targeted 
killings and settlement construction. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Knesset Member Omri Sharon, the PM\'s 
son, as saying that a \"broad-based government\" with the 
Labor Party will not be a \"national-unity government of 
equals.\"  The newspaper says that his remark is 
directed at the members of the Likud Convention, which 
will Thursday debate the Labor Party\'s entry into the 
government. 
 
On Sunday, Jerusalem Post quoted Efraim Inbar, Director 
of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar- 
Ilan University as saying: \"We [Israel] don\'t have to 
open negations with Syria since the Americans aren\'t 
interested in this track.  The Americans don\'t want us 
to smile at [Damascus].\" 
Israel Radio reported that co-initiator of the Peoples\' 
Voice peace initiative and former Shin Bet head Ami 
Ayalon joined the Labor Party today.  Maariv reported 
that Ayalon associates have suggested he vie for a 
ministerial portfolio. 
 
All media reported on the visit of the three most 
senior PA leaders to Damascus, scheduled for today, 
which Ha\'aretz views as \"historical, possibly signaling 
the change underway in the Middle East since the death 
of Yasser Arafat last month.\"  Ha\'aretz quoted PLO head 
Mahmoud Abbas as saying that the PA will negotiate a 
hudna (truce) with the Hamas leadership in the West 
Bank, rather with than the organization\'s leaders 
overseas.  Senior Palestinian security official Jibril 
Rajoub, who is visiting Egypt, told Israel Radio this 
morning that Israel is prepared to advance 
disengagement in coordination with the PA.  On Sunday, 
leading media quoted senior Hamas member in the West 
Bank Hassan Yousef as saying over the weekend that he 
is prepared to establish a long-term hudna in exchange 
for Palestinian statehood.  On Sunday, Maariv wrote 
that the relatively moderate statements emanating 
recently from the territories reveal the beginnings of 
a crack in the Hamas\'s leadership, as it appears that, 
for the first time in a long period,  the local 
leadership of Hamas does not see eye-to-eye with the 
expatriate leadership based in Damascus.  On Sunday, 
leading media reported that Abd a-Natif Muhammad Tayeh, 
the leader of Hamas in Tulkarm, was arrested during the 
weekend. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz as 
saying at Sunday\'s cabinet meeting that the number of 
attempted terrorist attacks has dropped since Yasser 
Arafat died three weeks ago, with Palestinian terror 
groups in \"waiting mode\" to see how things develop on 
the ground.  Maariv reported that following Arafat\'s 
demise and the possibility that Abbas could be elected 
PA chairman, Israel could reconsider its decision to 
physically dismantle the settlements it intends to 
evacuate in the Gaza Strip and the northernmost part of 
the West Bank.  On Sunday, Maariv quoted Labor Party 
Chairman Shimon Peres as saying that Israel must 
disengage from all the territories. 
 
On Sunday, Ha\'aretz reported that Iran and Hizbullah 
have intensified their efforts to operate in the 
territories in order to prevent a cease-fire. 
 
On Sunday, leading media reported that Syria has asked 
the international community to pressure Israel to agree 
to talks without preconditions. 
Jerusalem Post quoted O/C Chaplaincy Corps Brig. Gen. 
Yisrael Weiss as saying Sunday he has received a series 
of threatening letters form anti-disengagement 
activists.  Leading media also reported that three 
right-wing extremists were arrested Sunday for 
allegedly stoning the home of Rabbi Menahem Froman -- 
known for holding talks with Arafat and Hamas leaders - 
- in the West Bank settlement of Tekoa. 
 
Maariv reported that the Likud\'s Moshe Kahlon, who is 
of Libyan origin, could soon visit Libya, thus becoming 
the first Knesset member ever to meet with Libyan 
leader Muammar Qadhafi.  The newspaper also writes that 
in two weeks senior representatives of the Libyan 
government will attend a world conference of Jews of 
Libyan origin in Rome.  Maariv also reported that 
Sunday a senior member of Tunisia\'s Parliament, who is 
a close associate of Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, contacted 
Likud MK Majalli Whbee, telling him that Israel-Tunisia 
links are expected to warm up soon. 
 
Leading media quoted Industry, Trade and Labor Ehud 
Olmert as saying Sunday that Israel, Egypt, and the 
U.S. are set to sign a free trade area agreement next 
week, similar to the qualified industrial zone (QIZ) 
Israel shares with Jordan. 
 
On Sunday, leading media reported that over the weekend 
the U.S. Administration has finally approved the sale 
of 50 sophisticated air-to-air missiles to Jordan. 
 
Leading media quoted nuclear whistleblower Mordecai 
Vanunu as saying, in an interview with the British Sky 
News TV Sunday, that Israel\'s nuclear weapons are 
pushing other countries in the Middle East to develop 
similar arms. 
 
On Sunday, Ha\'aretz reported that the police have 
reopened an investigation into a deal between the 
Hachsharat Hayishuv company, controlled by the Nimrodi 
family, and the Sycamore Ranch, owned by Sharon\'s sons. 
The company may have illegally given 1.3 million 
shekels (about USD 300,000) to the Sharon family.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Foundations of the New Hope\" 
 
Independent, left leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(December 6): \"The news of Azzam Azzam\'s release from 
prison in Egypt contains both joy and hope.  Joy that 
an Israeli citizen -- who was sentenced by an Egyptian 
military tribunal to 15 years in prison after being 
convicted on dubious charges -- was released after 
serving a little more than half his sentence.... It is 
also joy over the success of tireless diplomatic 
efforts initiated by Israel together with the United 
States.  Azzam\'s arrest and trial became, in time, a 
symbol of the cool relations between Egypt and 
Israel.... Egyptian obstinacy in the Azzam case has now 
been replaced by a gesture that must be understood 
within the political context: in the last few days 
there has been a significant improvement in the 
personal and public ties between Egypt and Israel.... 
These developments did not begin with Azzam\'s release. 
They have been going on for several months, and for the 
Israeli public they culminated on Sunday.  Once again 
there is hope that what was seen Sunday as a rare 
expression of friendship will soon become the norm. 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan, the new voices among the 
Palestinians, even among radical groups like Hamas, and 
especially Egypt\'s willingness and desire to change the 
political reality in the region, are the foundations of 
the new hope.\" 
II.  \"We Didn\'t Abandon Him for a Moment\" 
Liberal op-ed writer Ofer Shelach opined in the 
editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (December 6): \"Sharon marketed disengagement 
to a people bleeding and in pain, which didn\'t want to 
hear about a partner.  He thus managed to turn an 
initiative which most of the military and political 
establishment opposed into a popular public initiative 
and was supported by a majority in the Knesset.  But on 
the ground, unilateral disengagement is liable to be 
disastrous.... And now, after Arafat\'s death and thanks 
to Egyptian interests, an escape hatch has been found 
for Sharon.  Under Egyptian sponsorship, the 
Palestinians will be able to reach an agreement among 
themselves, an agreement that Israel will profess not 
to take into account, but in practice, will cooperate 
with.  The Egyptians will help the Palestinians take 
responsibility and will provide a cover for 
controversial security moves, such as leaving 
Philadelphi Road.  They will be the responsible adult 
behind which hides the partner, in a way that allows 
all the sides to pretend that they are only talking to 
themselves.  From moment to moment, from step to step, 
the sides are approaching the moment of truth.  At that 
moment they will have no choice but to relinquish their 
convenient narratives, behind which they have 
barricaded themselves for the last four years.  They 
will again have to recognize their common interests, 
despite the hatred and the blood, and even admit 
responsibility, each on his own side, for some of the 
bloodshed.  Will this indeed happen?  It\'s difficult to 
know.  But Azzam Azzam\'s return home, a joyful human 
occasion, is another step in this greater move, and the 
final step has yet to be taken.\" 
 
III.  \"Hoping For More\" 
 
Arab affairs correspondent Jackie Hoogie wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (December 6): \"In contrast to 
Netanyahu, with whom he had exchanged childish taunts, 
or Barak, who did not know how to appease [events on] 
the ground, Sharon has displayed to the Egyptian 
President the wisdom of tribal elders.  He is engaged 
in actions, speaks little, and reaps the rewards -- the 
elimination of Hamas, the destruction of the tunnels, 
the suppression of the Intifada.  Mubarak is also fed 
up with this whole war.... Since [Arafat] passed on, 
there has been no one to give friendly support to Hamas 
or disturb the disengagement process.  In the absence 
of Arafat, there is no one to punish Sharon for the 
boycott he imposed upon him by dispatching cells from 
Gaza after the withdrawal.  Neither is there anyone to 
stand firm against the security rehabilitation plan of 
the Gaza Strip conceived by Egyptian Intelligence 
Minister Omar Suleiman.  Here is an opportunity to 
establish a Palestinian state, said Osama Sariyeh, a 
senior Egyptian journalist yesterday.  It needs the 
propulsion of processes, and Azzam Azzam is one of 
them.... The freedom of Azzam Azzam is the blessing 
that Mubarak is giving to Sharon and himself in the 
light of the new chapter that has been started.  It is 
a humble gift that was frozen for eight years, only in 
order to be pulled out for exactly these purposes.  The 
Egyptian hope is that the gift will leave the desire 
for more here.\" 
 
IV.  \"A First Step\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(December 6): \"While Mubarak\'s praise for Sharon is 
gratifying, the president has yet to consent to the 
simple, face-to-face contact with our prime minister 
that is the foundation of good relations.... Progress 
here is crucial if Egypt -- which has played a spoiling 
role at crucial moments of Israeli-Palestinian contact, 
like the July 2000 Camp David talks -- wants to be 
perceived as a constructive force toward Arab 
acceptance of, and genuine reconciliation with, Israel. 
Were Egypt now to truly press for such a goal, it would 
not only benefit Israel.  And it would not only echo 
positively with a U.S. government that provides Egypt 
with vast financial aid. It would also, self-evidently, 
benefit Egypt itself -- not least in its own fight 
against Islamic extremism.  None of this should need 
saying, yet Cairo has hitherto apparently failed to 
absorb the win-win nature of true normalization.  Let\'s 
hope the overdue release of Azzam Azzam is an early 
indicator that Egypt is finally getting the message.\" 
 
 
 
 
V.  \"Don\'t Be Blinded\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (December 
6): \"Hosni Mubarak felt that there was growing 
criticism of Egypt in Israel.  He decided to throw some 
\'small change\' and to calm the waters.  Indeed, the 
words worked, but he continues to produce strategic 
weapons in other domains.  Mubarak is interested in an 
Israel-Syria agreement that would most certainly bring 
about a significant pullout from the Golan.  Arab 
states will provide words, whereas Israel will give 
territories, bringing it to the \'Auschwitz borders.\'

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
German Ambassador to Israel Rudolph Dressler wrote in 
independent, left leaning Ha\'aretz: \"Israel must decide 
-- economic relations [with the EU] only or also a 
renewed political approach?  Israel will not be spared 
a debate over partially freeing itself from the United 
States.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
\"A German National Interest\" 
 
German Ambassador to Israel Rudolph Dressler wrote in 
independent, left leaning Ha\'aretz (December 5): 
\"Nearly 60 years after the demise of Nazi Germany and 
almost 40 years since diplomatic relations were 
established between Israel and the second German 
republic -- in May 1965 -- the German Embassy in Tel 
Aviv operates in a unique environment for German 
diplomacy.  Germany is today seen in the eyes of many 
Israeli leaders as the second most important partner 
after the United States in the fields of politics, 
economics, research and technology.... We are the 
second most important partner in Israel\'s foreign 
trade.... The enlargement of the European Union to 25 
countries is a historic event.  The single currency, 
the euro, is something akin to a miracle.  The economic 
power this generates is still unfathomed.  The inherent 
possibilities have only been partly elaborated -- more 
people than in the U.S., greater purchasing power than 
in the U.S., more economic strength.  These facts and 
possibilities are now at Israel\'s doorstep.  This also 
has political significance: whether one likes it or 
not, Europe is destined to play a more important role 
in the Middle East.  And herein lies the implication: 
Israel must decide -- economic relations only or also a 
renewed political approach?  Israel will not be spared 
a debate over partially freeing itself from the United 
States.... My country wants to assist Israel.  This 
assistance relates to the principle we defined during 
the visit of the president of the State of Israel in 
Berlin last spring: ensuring the existence of Israel is 
a German national interest and is thus one of the 
centerpieces of our political thinking.\"

SUBJECT: LIKUD CENTRAL COMMITTEE EXPECTED TO APPROVE 
COALITION TALKS WITH LABOR 
 
REF: A. TEL AVIV 6045 
 
     B. TEL AVIV 6007 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norman H. Olsen for reasons 1.4 (b,d 
). 
 
1.  (C) Likud\'s Central Committee is expected to give Prime 
Minister Sharon the green light December 9 to negotiate with 
the Labor Party, United Torah Judaism (UTJ), and Shas to 
rebuild Sharon\'s minority government, now consisting of only 
Likud\'s 40 MKs.  Sharon\'s proposal to negotiate with 
religious parties as well as Labor addresses the August 18 
Likud Central Committee vote against forming any coalition 
comprised of only secular parties.  He will nonetheless 
encounter some Central Committee resistance because of 
Labor\'s support for disengagement and its opposition to the 
budget and to financial reform.  Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz 
is reportedly scheduled to meet December 6 with Shas Chairman 
Eli Yishai to advance informal coalition talks.  Sharon is 
warning Likud members that failure to add Labor\'s 19 MKs to 
Likud\'s minority government will force early elections, 
something Likud MKs want to avoid in order to preserve the 
party\'s 2002 election windfall of 40 Knesset seats. 
 
2.  (C) Or Pearl, advisor to Likud disengagement opponent 
Ehud Yatom, told poloff December 6 that the strong showing by 
Sharon allies in the November 21 party elections has given 
Sharon the momentum to gain Likud support for coalition 
negotiations with Labor.  Pearl said he is confident that the 
three newly elected party leaders and senior Likud ministers 
-- Central Committee Chair Tzachi Hanegbi, Secretariat Chair 
Yisrael Katz, and Bureau Chief Daniel Naveh -- will vote to 
begin talks with Labor because they do not want early 
elections.  Hanegbi stated publicly, just before Shinui\'s 
dismissal, that the Central Committee would be inclined to 
allow Sharon to negotiate with Labor.  In addition, a Channel 
2 poll released December 3 in Ma\'ariv says some 60 percent of 
Likud members support a coalition with Labor and a religious 
party, and only 13 percent are in favor of early elections. 
 
3.  (C) Labor Party leader Shimon Peres will likely win his 
party\'s consent for talks with Likud despite significant 
opposition within Labor to Sharon\'s budget.  Peres has made 
advancing disengagement, and not Labor\'s economic agenda, his 
focus and priority, but some Labor MKs such as Danny Yatom 
and Colette Avital are intent on opposing the budget as well 
as Finance Minister Netanyahu\'s economic reforms and cuts in 
social programs, and could demand extensive budget revisions. 
 Peres also told Ha\'aretz December 2 that he intends to 
remain in a unity government until the scheduled November 
2006 elections -- not just until disengagement is completed, 
as several Labor members proposed.  If Likud approves 
coalition negotiations with Labor, Labor\'s Central Committee 
will likely vote December 12 to postpone party primaries. 
Most Labor MKs and party leadership contenders favor 
postponing primaries in order to foil former Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak\'s efforts to return as party leader.

Yediot quoted President Bush as saying Monday, at a 
meeting with Jordan\'s King Abdullah II, that \"the 
United States and my government will be involved with 
Middle Eastern peace, and that I believe that two 
states living side-by-side in peace -- a Palestinian 
state and an Israeli state -- is necessary for there to 
be peace, and that we have a moment, a window of 
opportunity.\"  Jerusalem Post briefly cited the 
President\'s remarks.  Yediot also quoted senior U.S. 
Administration officials as saying in recent days that 
Israel must strengthen Abbas\'s status and position 
among Palestinians through a prisoner release and other 
steps such as the removal of roadblocks, and granting 
freedom of travel and work permits to the Palestinians. 
 
Ha\'aretz (Aluf Benn) reported that there is a brewing 
dispute in Israel over British PM Tony Blair\'s proposal 
for an international conference on the Middle East in 
January or February after the Palestinian elections to 
grant the new PA leadership international legitimacy. 
The newspaper says that Sharon is opposed to the 
renewal of the diplomatic process until the 
Palestinians take action to fulfill the first stage of 
the road map, meaning putting an end to terrorism and 
implementing security reforms.  According to Ha\'aretz, 
Sharon is prepared for the conference to take part 
without Israeli participation, and for it to be a one- 
day event for professionals that would deal with 
reforms in the PA.  The daily says that FM Silvan 
Shalom does not reject the idea of the conference and 
that he is ready to consider Israeli participation at 
the FM\'s level, but that he made clear to European 
counterparts that he is opposed to \"skipping\" directly 
to negotiations over the final-status agreement. 
Jerusalem Post reported that an unnamed \"senior Israel 
official\" made similar remarks.  Jerusalem Post cited 
London\'s Daily Telegraph as saying that President Bush 
is opposed to a conference like the one that followed 
the 1991 Gulf War. 
 
Israel Radio reported that this morning an IDF soldier 
was killed and four others were wounded at the Karni 
Crossing into the northern Gaza Strip.  Hamas claimed 
responsibility for the attack.  The radio and Ha\'aretz 
web site reported that hours later (according to 
Ha\'aretz web site) in the same area an IAF missile 
killed an Islamic Jihad activist.  Ha\'aretz reported 
that a Palestinian working in Neve Dekalim, one of the 
Gush Katif (Gaza Strip) settlers, was lightly wounded 
Monday by a mortar shell launched from Khan Yunis. 
The newspaper also reported that a psychologist 
specializing in the trauma faced by Gush Katif (Gaza 
Strip) settlements who face both evacuation and almost 
daily mortar attacks has launched a Web site to provide 
area residents with information about dealing with 
pressure and crises. 
 
All media reported that the army is investigating the 
conditions surrounding an incident last Friday in which 
members of a unit of the prestigious Shayetet (naval 
commando) killed Mahmoud Kmel, a senior Islamic Jihad 
activist, who was apparently unarmed and did not 
represent a risk.  The Shayetet has been put on hold as 
far as operations in the West Bank are concerned.  The 
Israeli human rights group B\'Tselem had requested the 
probe.  Leading media quoted the head of the IDF 
personnel branch, Maj. Gen. Elazar Stern as saying 
Monday that 20 percent of IDF soldiers come from a 
culture that does not view Arab lives as equal to those 
of Jews.  Stern said, \"Every generation needs to see 
itself as if it had come out of Auschwitz\" (a reference 
to the Passover Seder\'s commandment: \"In every 
generation you must see yourself as being in Egypt\"). 
Stern was speaking before the Knesset\'s Constitution, 
Law and Justice Committee, which convened to discuss 
the just use of force in the war on terror. 
 
Israel Radio reported that security forces have 
arrested a resident of Baqa el-Gharbiyeh, an Israeli- 
Arab town adjacent to the Green Line, whom Iran had 
allegedly recruited as a spy. 
 
Leading media reported that Monday in Damascus PLO 
Secretary-General Mahmoud Abbas and Syrian President 
 
SIPDIS 
Bashar Assad agreed on coordinating positions ahead of 
possible negotiations with Israel, and that the senior 
Palestinians who visited Syria (Abbas, Palestinian PM 
Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala), and Acting PA Chairman Rawhi 
Fattouh) asked Assad to press Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
leaders in Damascus to cooperate with them.  The media 
reported that the Palestinian delegation met with local 
leaders of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Ahmed Jibril\'s PFLP- 
GC. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz as 
saying Monday before the Knesset\'s Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee, that the boosting of ties between 
Israel and Egypt is a \"strategic significant process\" 
that is to include cooperation in fighting regional and 
global terror.  The media continued to report on the 
conditions of the imprisonment of Azzam Azzam, who was 
released from an Egyptian jail during the weekend.  PM 
Sharon visited Maghar, Azzam\'s village, on Monday.  The 
media argued over the fact that Channel 10-TV is paying 
Azzam some USD 40,000 for the exclusive rights of an 
interview with him. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Sharon associates as saying Monday that 
Sharon will settle accounts with any minister or 
Knesset member who fails to help persuade the Likud 
Central Committee to approve the Labor Party\'s entry 
into the government, while those who do help him will 
be rewarded.  Maariv reported that the Likud \"rebels\" 
are considering voting in the Knesset against Labor\'s 
entry into the government, if the Likud Central 
Committee approves the move.  Yediot reported that 
members of the Labor Party increasingly oppose Shimon 
Peres\'s desire to see Labor enter the government 
immediately.  Yediot quoted Peres as saying that 
primaries in the party would thwart the planned 
disengagement. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Israel, which has 
consistently tried to keep the EU out of the diplomatic 
process, is now pressing it to use its clout to get 
Arab countries to develop with Israel. Israel Radio 
reported that Israel-EU talks on the \"European 
Neighborhood policy\" have hit a snag regarding the EU\'s 
condition that countries participating in the program 
sign a WMD clause.  The agreement must be finalized by 
Thursday. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted President Moshe Katsav as saying 
Monday that if Assad is sincere about resuming peace 
negotiations, he should at least make some kind of 
goodwill gesture, such as returning the remains of Eli 
Cohen to Israel.  Cohen was convinced of spying and 
hanged in Damascus in 1965. 
 
All media reported that on Monday a Jerusalem 
Magistrate\'s Court sentenced Shahar Dvir-Zeliger, a 
member of the \"new Jewish underground,\" to eight years 
in jail for membership in a terrorist organization 
aimed at carrying out terror attacks against Arab 
civilians, and for unlawful possession of weapons 
stolen from the IDF. 
 
Citing Reuters, Ha\'aretz quoted Palestinian officials 
as saying in Ramallah Monday that the PA will ask donor 
countries at a meeting in Oslo for about USD 4 million 
to stave off an economic crisis. 
 
The media cited two Palestinian public opinion polls, 
which predict a close contest between Abbas and Marwan 
Barghouti in the PA elections. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Al Qaida has claimed 
responsibility for Monday\'s attack on the U.S. 
Consulate in Jeddah. 
Ha\'aretz reported that Atty. Fred Fielding, a \"highly 
respected Washington insider,\" will mediate between the 
U.S. Justice Department and lawyers who filed class 
action lawsuits on the issue of the \"gold train,\" the 
trainload of looted gold and art stolen from Jews by 
the Nazis that was subsequently confiscated by U.S. 
troops, but that was never returned to the property\'s 
lawful owners.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Supportive Steps Needed\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(December 7): \"The weakness of Hamas\'s leadership in 
the territories has increased the importance of the 
Palestinian opposition\'s \'external leadership,\' most of 
which lives in Damascus.  It is these men with whom Abu 
Mazen is trying to reach an understanding on the 
conditions for a cease-fire.  Abu Mazen is also taking 
advantage of the upcoming elections for the PA 
chairmanship to convince Hamas to stop the attacks, if 
only for a limited period, not only inside Israel, but 
also in the West Bank and Gaza.  Such an understanding 
is possible in part because of the heavy pressure that 
the Syrian regime is exerting on the Palestinian 
opposition leaders in Damascus.  These leaders 
understand quite well that at a time when President 
Assad is calling for a renewal of peace talks with 
Israel, he is not going to allow the Palestinian 
organizations under his aegis to launch terror attacks 
against Israel.  The window of opportunity for 
achieving a cease-fire with the Palestinians is wider 
than ever.  Israel\'s government must not miss this 
chance for a cease-fire and a renewal of the peace 
process.\" 
 
II.  \"In the Right Direction\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (December 7): \"It is wrong 
[for the Labor Party] to condition its entry into the 
government upon a commitment to moving up the Knesset 
elections -- especially as [former prime minister Ehud] 
Barak supports the dismantling of [the] Gush Katif 
settlement bloc.... The right formula for Labor\'s 
joining the government is the following one: the 
necessary condition is the continuation of the 
implementation of the disengagement plan, to which 
Sharon claims to be wholly committed -- in defiance of 
the Likud refuseniks.  This constitutes real progress, 
which could suddenly be dampened in a cynical maneuver 
to move up the Knesset elections before Gush Katif is 
evacuated.... Since the process of joining the 
government is not an ephemeral move, Labor must bring 
its best representatives into the government -- all the 
more so when this government will be marked by many 
upheavals, landmines, and political ambushes.  Barak is 
one of those people.\" 
 
III.  \"Illusions in a New Edition\" 
 
Oslo Agreement skeptic and Hebrew University Professor 
Yehoshua Porat wrote in mass-circulation, pluralist 
Yediot Aharonot (December 7): \"On Sunday, the [Israeli] 
media kept filing happy reports from Egypt.... What was 
less manifest was the fact that Azzam Azzam spent eight 
years in an Egyptian jail for trying to do business in 
Egypt, according to what the peace treaty allowed and 
established.... According to the peace treaty, an 
Egyptian ambassador should be present in Israel.  For 
years, Israel held back regarding this flagrant 
violation of the treaty.  Israel taught the entire Arab 
world that it was possible to turn a blind eye to 
contractual commitments to Israel.... Talking about 
peace, does any of Israel decision-makers understand 
why Egypt needs armored forces to prevent arms 
smuggling into the Gaza Strip?.... More importantly: 
why is Egypt investing a fortune in the purchase of 
sophisticated weapons which are patently intended for a 
rapid crossing of the Sinai peninsula, in order to 
attack its northeastern neighbor?.... This is without 
mentioning the anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, almost Nazi 
incitement in Egypt\'s official media.\" 
 
IV.  \"UN Self-Interest\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(December 7): \"The UN, on the brink of irrelevancy, is 
struggling to save itself. Given its antipathy toward 
the Zionist enterprise, should we help it succeed or 
hope that it heads over the edge?  The answer should 
depend on whether plans announced Thursday at UN 
headquarters to radically transform the world body have 
the potential of offering Israel a \'new deal\'.... If 
the UN wants to convincingly demonstrate a genuinely 
new beginning, the GA should elect Israel to a two-year 
Security Council seat.  No nation has been so mean- 
spiritedly singled out, so consistently and for so 
long, as Israel.  No nation has suffered more from the 
tyranny of the UN majority, targeted through countless 
denunciatory, one-sided resolutions.  Entire UN-related 
international bodies have been permanently hijacked for 
Israel-bashing.  Electing Israel to the Security 
Council would signal that the community of nations 
rejects, de jure and forever, threats to wipe Israel 
off the map.  At the same time, such a declarative vote 
would reassure Israel that its painful concessions (in 
Gaza, for instance) are valued by the world community. 
If Palestine is to be the 22nd Arab member in a UN 
where 58 countries are already aligned with the Islamic 
bloc, Israel deserves preference on the rotation of 
countries that hold temporary Security Council 
seats.... Reforming the UN will be no easy task; we 
will know it is on the right track when it begins to 
apply the charter\'s universal values to Israel.\"

\"Assad\'s Trap\" 
 
Contributor Ran Baratz wrote in popular, pluralist 
Maariv (December 7): \"A seasonal excitement, due to 
Assad Jr.\'s peace calls \'without preconditions\', has 
recently seized some [Israeli] commentators... An 
important development, which occurred a little over one 
year ago, was the U.S. decision to isolate Syria and to 
weaken it significantly.  That decision, which was 
backed by the U.S. Congress, is starting to bear fruit 
-- as evidenced by the weakness of Assad, whom nobody 
views as an angel.... The bad thing [about reaching an 
agreement with Syria] would be that Syrian-UN-European 
cooperation against the U.S. would harm Israel.  Warm 
relations with the U.S. are preferable to peace with 
Syria, whose chances of coming about are small at best. 
The Americans\' interest in pressuring Syria is big. 
Firstly, they want to hinder the possibility that Iran, 
Syria\'s close friend, create ... additional fronts in 
the region.... Secondly, they remember Assad\'s help to 
Saddam and the Iraqi opposition forces.... Thirdly, 
Syria ... has become a highly significant factor in 
Palestinian terrorism, creating an extra obstacle to 
American policy.\"

-- Explosions: The IDF reported that IDF soldiers found and 
safely disposed of a 40-kilogram explosive device near the 
Sufa Crossing December 6.  Hamas militants detonated an 
explosive device near the Karni Crossing December 7, killing 
an IDF soldier, according to the IDF (see Deaths/Injuries\" 
and \"Incursions/Demolitions\"). 
 
5.  (SBU) INCURSIONS/DEMOLITIONS: 
 
-- UNRWA reported that IDF undercover units, supported 
subsequently by APCs and IAF helicopters, entered the area 
between the Nahal Oz and Karni Crossings just after midnight 
December 7 to search for weapons, according to IDF and 
Israeli media reports.  Militants gathered to repel the 
incursion.  One IDF soldier and his bomb-sniffing dog were 
killed when an IED detonated, and four other soldiers were 
wounded trying to recover the body.  The clashes continued 
throughout the night and into the day, with a total of two 
Palestinians reported killed and at least ten more injured, 
according to UNRWA.  The operation is ongoing as of 1200 
hours. 
 
-- UNRWA reported that three IDF bulldozers and five armored

-- Karni Terminal was open but reportedly operating slowly. 
 
-- Rafah Terminal was open for arrivals and departures 
December 7.  Although the IDF no longer prohibits the exit of 
male Palestinians age 16-35 from the Gaza Strip lengthy 
checks at the border mean that few Palestinians in this 
category are actually able to exit.  There are no age 
restrictions for entry into Gaza. 
 
-- Tel al-Sultan checkpoint was closed December 7.  Toufah 
checkpoint was open for residents of al-Mowassi.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Israel Radio reported that the U.S. has no information 
regarding the achievement of a framework agreement 
between Israel and the Palestinians, as indicated in 
reports coming out from Cairo -- through Egypt\'s Middle 
East News Agency (MENA)  -- that are cited in all major 
media.  Reporting that Israeli officials played down 
the reports from Cairo that progress was being made in 
behind-the-scenes negotiations, Jerusalem Post 
nevertheless quoted a source in Sharon\'s bureau as 
saying that elements in those reports are true.  Israel 
Radio quoted GOI sources as saying that the reports are 
meant to assuage frustration among the Egyptian public 
regarding the release of convicted spy Azzam Azzam, and 
to prepare Egyptian public opinion to the return of an 
Egyptian ambassador to Israel. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that during his current visit to 
Kuwait Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is trying to 
persuade Kuwaiti ruler Prince Jabber Ahmed el Sabah to 
open negotiations with Israel for diplomatic ties and 
to pressure Syria to demonstrate more daring diplomatic 
moves that will persuade Israel of Damascus\'s 
seriousness about renewing the diplomatic process with 
Israel.  Israel Radio cited Israel\'s acknowledgment 
that Egypt has launched a cease-fire initiative, but 
said that PM Sharon has set the first stage of the road 
map, i.e. the cessation of Palestinian terror, as the 
precondition for talks with the Palestinians.  The 
radio also quoted GOI officials as saying that Egypt is 
trying to convene a conference in Washington this 
summer with the participation of Israel, the 
Palestinians, the U.S., and Egypt.  Leading media 
quoted GOI sources as saying that Israel would respond 
to quiet with quiet. 
 
Maariv (Ben Caspit) reported that Elliott Abrams, 
Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director 
of the National Security Council for Near East and 
North African Affairs, recently told Jewish leaders at 
a private meeting in Washington that the U.S. is 
concerned about recent reports about the conduct of IDF 
troops at roadblocks, that it is opposed to even the 
slightest delay in the disengagement calendar, and that 
it views any settlement beyond the separation fence as 
slated for evacuation. 
 
IDF Radio reported that the U.S. is accusing official 
Israeli representatives of trying to obtain 
technological and intelligence information in a way 
that can be termed spying.  The station quoted senior 
GOI sources as saying that the tension over this matter 
stems from cultural differences.   In another 
development, Jerusalem Post reported that members of 
the U.S. Congress have expressed anger and dismay over 
Sunday\'s report in the newspaper describing how the FBI 
set up the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.  Rep. Gary Ackerman 
(D-NY), who is one of the members of Congress whose 
demand for a briefing on the matter by the Justice 
Department has not been answered, was quoted as saying 
in an interview with Jerusalem Post: \"I think it\'s very 
disconcerting to think that an investigating agency of 
the U.S., while investigating the alleged misdeeds of a 
[Pentagon] employee [Franklin], would look to cut some 
kind of deal with him if they believe he committed a 
crime and to give him a better deal if they could.\" 
Ackerman reportedly added: \"They are trying at any 
length to disrupt the work of a very prestigious 
American organization that advocates American foreign 
policy in the Middle East for a better relationship 
with Israel.\" 
 
Leading media reported that jailed Tanzim leader Marwan 
Barghouti is considering withdrawing his candidacy for 
PA chairman. 
 
The media reported on disagreements in the IDF and 
Israeli society regarding the conduct of IDF troops in 
the territories.  Yediot led with a protest letter 
written by parents of soldiers serving in the elite 
naval commando (Sayeret): \"Our Sons Are Not Murderers.\" 
Israel Radio quoted Sayeret reservists as saying that 
the \"neighbor procedure,\" in which the IDF orders a 
Palestinian to instruct a person whom the army wants to 
arrest to leave his house, is still being carried out 
despite a ban by the High Court of Justice. 
 
The major media reported that Finance Minister Binyamin 
Netanyahu told Sharon Tuesday that he supports the plan 
to bring the Labor Party into the coalition, and that 
he has instructed his followers in the Likud Central 
Committee to vote in favor of the plan.  Ha\'aretz 
reported on inactivity among anti-disengagement forces 
within the Likud, which expect Sharon to win the vote 
in the committee Thursday.  Ha\'aretz also reported that 
Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres intends to convene 
the party\'s executive committee on Saturday night to 
obtain its approval to start coalition talks with the 
Likud, if the Likud\'s convention votes in favor of 
Labor\'s entry into the government. 
 
The electronic media reported that this morning, anti- 
tank missiles landed next to a kindergarten in the 
northern Gaza Strip settlement of Nissanit, and that a 
mortar shell was launched at a settlement in the 
southern strip.  Israel Radio reported that Hizbullah 
is attempting to recruit activists in the Gaza Strip, 
as it has done in the northern West Bank.  Hatzofe 
reported that for the first time the Palestinians have 
dug a tunnel from the Gaza Strip into Israel. 
Ha\'aretz, Yediot and Jerusalem Post reported that the 
IDF is probing the killing of a 15-year-old Palestinian 
boy last March by troops who were on a hike in the Gaza 
Strip.  Jerusalem Post reported that the PA Police have 
refused to launch a joint investigation of the case 
with the Israeli authorities. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that security forces arrested 41 
Israeli left-wing activists who were participating in a 
demonstration against the separation fence Tuesday near 
the West Bank village of Budrus.  Leading media 
reported that the IDF prevented a delegation of Peace 
Now and left-wing Knesset members from completing their 
visit Tuesday to a street being paved between Jerusalem 
and the West Bank settlement of Nokdim, south of 
Bethlehem. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted official Iranian sources as saying that 
they have information about Pakistan and Saudi Arabia 
signing an agreement in 2003 in which Pakistan promised 
to help Saudi Arabia develop nuclear weapons and the 
missiles to deliver them. 
 
Israel Radio cited a Washington Post story citing the 
conclusion of U.S. military intelligence officials that 
the Iraqi insurgency is being directed from Syria to a 
greater degree than previously recognized, 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Majde al-Khalidi, a senior PA 
Foreign Ministry official, as saying that the PA will 
be seeking to obtain USD 400 million from the 
international donor states about to convene in Norway, 
in order to reconstruct its security apparatus.  The 
newspaper also quoted senior PA officials in Ramallah 
as saying Tuesday that a high-level Palestinian 
delegation is expected to visit the Gulf region next 
week to ask for hundreds of millions of dollars in 
financial aid for the PA.  Israel Radio reported that 
PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Palestinian 
PM Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) will meet with the Lebanese 
leadership in Beirut today. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that in a radical departure 
from years of French critical rhetoric, the French 
Ambassador to Israel, Gerard Araud, told the newspaper 
on Tuesday that he thought Israel \"has tried to show 
the utmost restraint\" in the course of the conflict 
with the Palestinians since 2000. 
 
Maariv, Jerusalem Post and Hatzofe reported that 
Tuesday the Knesset approved the granting of Israeli 
citizenship to former South Lebanon Army (SLA) fighters 
and their family members who live in Israel. 
 
Maariv reported that Tuesday Likud MK Ayub Kara 
presented a bill draft to the Knesset, according to 
which the state would compensate Azzam Azzam with 96 
monthly salary payments -- the number of months he 
served in an Egyptian prison.  If adopted, the law 
could be the basis for the compensation of people who 
were jailed abroad for being Israelis.

------------ 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Liberal columnist Gideon Samet wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"The right thing to do is well 
familiar to [Shimon Peres]: to change his mind by 
tomorrow and explain why he is in favor of supporting 
disengagement from outside the government, retreating 
from the problematic intention of joining the Sharon 
government.\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"We would like to hear Peres argue ... that the way to 
help the Palestinian leadership confront violence is to 
hold them to high standards, and that low standards 
actually fan the flames of radicalism.\" 
 
Moshe Elad, who was the first head of the joint 
security mechanism with the PA, writes in Ha\'aretz: 
\"The Israeli government has never tried to initiate a 
positive change in Palestinian society.  Maybe the time 
has come for it.... The instrument through which this 
can be done is the Palestinian elections for 
president.\" 
 
Conservative columnist Nadav Haetzni wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv: \"The positive \'signals\' received from 
the Arab states, which \'ambassador\' Sharon will boast 
about at the Likud Convention, are akin to the 
satisfaction of a wolf that has just devoured a sheep.\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized: \"Where is 
the only person of conscience among the Palestinian 
public who will speak about the \'purity of arms\' [an 
Israeli military concept advocating limited force and 
the humane treatment of enemy prisoners and 
noncombatants]?\" 
 
 
 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Lose to Win\" 
Liberal columnist Gideon Samet wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 8): \"The Labor Party\'s 
entry into the government under the current 
circumstances will be of no little shame for Peres and 
his party.  As ministers, they will be small pawns on a 
board on which Sharon is playing until he decides to 
checkmate them.... In the best of all possible cases, 
to please the international ear and the eye of the 
Israeli majority, the disengagement will start with 
something.  When it encounters its first anticipated 
difficulties, perhaps even blood on the TV screens, it 
will get stuck, together with the losers from Labor.... 
Say what you want about Peres, he\'s a serious, 
experienced man.  The right thing to do is well 
familiar to him: to change his mind by tomorrow and 
explain why he is in favor of supporting disengagement 
from outside the government, retreating from the 
problematic intention of joining the Sharon government. 
One thing is certain in this vote: He will surely come 
out a winner.\" 
 
II.  \"Where\'s the New Peres?\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(December 8): \"There is ... a fundamental difference 
between the two leaders [Sharon and Peres], beyond 
their disputes on specific issues.  The difference is 
that Sharon, by proposing disengagement, embracing the 
goal of Palestinian statehood and calling the status 
quo \'occupation,\' has dramatically changed course.... 
By contrast, there is no new Peres.... Peres has been 
defeated at the polls more times than perhaps any 
leader in our history.  Yet he has never shown any 
doubt as to the rightness of his path.... Some say the 
mistake of Oslo was the idea behind it, others blame 
only the bet on Yasser Arafat as a partner.  Without 
resolving this debate, there should be no obstacle to 
agreeing that it was a mistake, once it became clear 
that Arafat was not complying, to make excuses for him 
and accuse anyone who blew the whistle of \'weakening 
Arafat\' and threatening peace.   We would like to hear 
-- not just from Sharon, but from Peres -- that that 
mistake will not be made again, that he will not say 
that demanding an end to terror and incitement \'weakens 
Abu Mazen.\'  We would like to hear Peres argue the 
opposite: that the way to help the Palestinian 
leadership confront violence is to hold them to high 
standards, and that low standards actually fan the 
flames of radicalism.  We have a new Sharon.  Will we 
have a new Peres?\" 
 
III.  \"When the Likud Applauds Peres\" 
 
Conservative columnist Nadav Haetzni wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (December 8): \"The actual significance 
of the package of achievements Sharon has arranged for 
Mubarak is a modification of the strategic balance in 
southern Israel.  God forbid, it could also brew the 
next war with Egypt: after the withdrawal from Katif 
[in the Gaza Strip], any Israeli retaliatory action 
against the launching of missiles from Gaza, could be 
viewed as a declaration of war against Egypt.... All 
told, the positive \'signals\' received from the Arab 
states, which \'ambassador\' Sharon will boast about at 
the Likud Convention, are akin to the satisfaction of a 
wolf that has just devoured a sheep.... Peres and 
Chamberlain have patented this formula.... Thus, on 
Thursday, after the members of the convention listen to 
the Prime Minister\'s listing of achievements, they will 
have to decide whether they will finally turn 
Jabotinsky House [the Likud headquarters] into another 
version of the Peres Center For Peace.\" 
 
IV.  \"Time For a Positive Change\" 
 
Moshe Elad, who was the first head of the joint 
security mechanism with the PA, writes in Ha\'aretz 
(December 8): \"The sounds of joy Israelis are making 
about \'seeing positive signs\' in the Palestinian 
leadership, and particularly in the Islamic bloc, 
should be regarded with a considered degree of caution. 
It\'s not peace they are talking about over there, but 
about freedom for the prisoners, lifting the 
checkpoints, and work permits.... For clear reasons, 
mostly the continuing terrorism, the Israeli government 
has never tried to initiate a positive change in 
Palestinian society.  Maybe the time has come for 
it.... The instrument through which this can be done is 
the Palestinian elections for president.  Before the 
pressure on Israel begins to mount, before a 
spectacular terror attack by the association of 
opponents of peace torpedoes the last bit of 
willingness to turn a new page, it would be wise if at 
our own initiative we responded to those signals.  If 
there is any chance for a change in the position of the 
Palestinian public toward Israel and an end to 
terrorism, it does not go through Abu Mazen\'s office 
nor even Marwan Barghouti\'s cell.  It passes, whether 
we like it or not, through the gates of the Shata 
Prison and at the Hawara checkpoint.\" 
 
V.  \"Purity of Arms\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (December 
8): \"[IDF soldiers] have carried out exceptional deeds 
every few years; all those who took part in them are 
paying dearly and publicly for them, which represent 99 
percent of the cases perpetrated in the fight against 
an enemy who attacks in order to kill.... Hundreds of 
terrorists attend each funeral of a senior Hamas 
member.  Common and existential sense suggests that all 
those murderers be sprayed with weapon fire.  However, 
Israel will never do such a thing, which could have 
saved a considerable amount of Jewish blood.  In 
contrast to this humanism, mean Palestinian terrorists 
have not hesitated to open fire at mourners who had 
come to the [Gaza Strip] Gush Katif cemetery in order 
to honor the memory of the terror victims.  Where is 
the only person of conscience among the Palestinian 
public who will speak about the \'purity of arms\' [an 
Israeli military concept advocating limited force and 
the humane treatment of enemy prisoners and 
noncombatants]?\"

2.  Iran Nuclear Program:

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: 
\"While the world is preoccupied with Iranian nuclear 
activity ... Iran says: \'You\'re only looking at us, but 
here are two friends of the United States who are 
working together through an accord to develop a nuclear 
program.\'\"

\"Iran Attempts Distraction\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(December 8): \"After the board of directors at the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently 
announced that the board welcomed Iran\'s decision to 
freeze all activities connected with uranium 
enrichment, a news item appeared in Tehran quoting 
official sources who claimed that Saudi Arabia and 
Pakistan had joined forces to develop a military 
nuclear program.... What prompted Iran to issue this 
piece of news?  While the world is preoccupied with 
Iranian nuclear activity, with the pressures that 
European countries are putting on Iran, with the 
American demands to transfer the issue to the United 
Nations Security Council, Iran says: \'You\'re only 
looking at us, but here are two friends of the United 
States who are working together through an accord to 
develop a nuclear program.\'  Unlike the past, this time 
the Iranians did not accuse Israel -- falsely -- as the 
cause for their nuclear development, but rather two 
large Muslim countries.  Thus the message is that the 
U.S. is employing a double standard and wants to harm 
Iran\'s efforts to develop energy.\"

TAGS: KWBG, ECON, IS, GAZA DISENGAGEMENT, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS 
SUBJECT: GAZA DISENGAGEMENT: EXAMINING PROGRESS AT KARNI 
AND EREZ 
 
Classified By: DCM Gene A.  Cretz for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary: In their discussions of Israel\'s 
disengagement plan, the World Bank continues to highlight the 
Gaza Strip\'s border crossings as key to Gaza\'s economic 
success.  The international donor community has approached 
the Israelis about humanitarian and economic problems that 
arise from slowdowns and closures at Karni and Erez crossing. 
 The GOI acknowledges these issues and is taking steps to 
improve the crossings regime.  UNRWA, which imports some 
2,500 containers annually, describes Karni terminal as a 
hopeless case that has cost UNRWA some USD one million in 
per-container costs, and says it believes increased container 
capacity at Rafah crossing is the best solution.  Gazan 
businessmen dependent on imported raw materials are also 
pessimistic, citing 20-day delays for goods at Karni, and 
five-hour holdups for businessmen at Erez that make it 
impossible for Gazans to do business in Israel or the West 
Bank on 12-hour permits issued by COGAT.  COGAT, in turn, 
states that the GOI is fully committed to \"increasing trade 
with Gaza\" by increasing capacity at Karni and Erez and by 
\"making sure businessmen can get out\" of the Strip.  GOI 
interlocutors are confident that \"technological fixes\" at the 
crossings will solve the problem, but say the GOI will need 
substantial assistance from the U.S. and other donors to make 
this work.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
UNRWA: Debacle at Karni Costing USD One Million 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2.  (C) Olaf Molander, who handles shipping of humanitarian 
supplies for UNRWA and the several relief organizations under 
UNRWA\'s shipping umbrella, told Econoff November 10 UNRWA has 
been hit especially hard by the GOI\'s policy of enhanced 
screening at Karni terminal for empty containers leaving the 
Gaza Strip, which was put in place after March\'s suicide 
bombing at Ashdod port.  The change has caused Turkish, 
Cypriot, and Israeli shipping companies to charge extra for 
each day the containers are stuck in storage.  Molander said 
this delay has raised UNRWA\'s per-container costs from an 
already high USD 300 during the intifida period to USD 600 
since August.  (Note: Pre-intifada per-container costs 
averaged USD 150.  End note.)  Since UNRWA brings between two 
and three thousand containers into the Gaza Strip each year, 
Molander said, this figure has become unwieldy -- the 
organization has paid out over USD one million in storage 
fees. 
 
3.  (C) Ostensibly to alleviate this problem, said Molander, 
the GOI fitted one of Karni\'s terminals with an x-ray machine 
in August.  The machine is supposed to scan empty containers 
leaving Gaza at a rate of 500 per day, he explained, but 
staffing shortages, technical problems, and what he terms \"a 
simple lack of will\" have kept this daily output closer to 
only 100 for months now.  In Molander\'s view, bureaucratic 
differences among the various GOI agencies has contributed to 
Karni\'s \"unacceptable\" operation.  While the semi-private 
Israeli Airports Authority, who runs the terminal and makes 
money off of each screening, would like to provide better, 
faster service, the security concerns of the Shin Bet and the 
Israeli police inevitably slow functioning at the terminal. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Rafah Should Increase Container Screening 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Molander said goods have been moving so slowly 
through Karni that UNRWA has been considering the potential 
of the Rafah crossing, on Gaza\'s southern border with Egypt, 
as an alternative container terminal in the future.  This 
cannot happen soon, he explained, since at present Rafah only 
has capacity to handle palletted cargo, not the container or 
bulk packaging that UNRWA uses to import most of its 
humanitarian supplies.  He predicts, however, that within a 
year following disengagement the Egyptian government will 
begin serious maneuvering to \"get in on\" some of the trade 
into and out of Gaza, which the Haifa and Ashdod ports 
currently control.  He argued that this is not a political 
issue, but simple economic opportunity for Egypt.  As such, 
he posited that it can and will occur whether Israel retains 
control over the Philadelphi corridor or not. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Gazan Businessmen: Goods Still Blocked at Karni... 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5.  (C) Gazan factory owners and other manufacturers who 
depend on imports of raw materials for their businesses say 
they have seen \"effectively no\" improvement at Karni or Erez 
since the intifada began, and they remain pessimistic about 
the future.  In a December 2 conversation with Econoff, 
Mohammed Yazgi, owner of Gaza\'s Pepsi bottling plant and 
member of the Palestinian Business Association, conceded that 
shipments of fresh fruit and concrete are not limited in 
number and have indeed been moving somewhat more quickly 
through Karni over the past several months, due in part to 
the interest of the Israeli produce shipping giant Agrexco. 
Essential materials like sugar, flour, bottles and other 
packaging items, however, are still routinely held 20 days or 
more at the border.  For himself and other manufacturers, 
Yazgi said, these are the goods that really matter. 
 
6.  (C) An average of 100 containers per week of these types 
of commodities comes into the Gaza Strip, Yazgi said, whereas 
before the intifada that number was over one thousand.  This 
delay is not caused by the Israeli Airports Authority staff 
who man Karni -- recently the IAA agreed to keep the terminal 
open until 11:00 at night, and Yazgi says he has often seen 
employees working late -- but rather by the IDF and other GOI 
agencies who have limited the number of trucks that can even 
approach the terminal to only five or six per day. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
... And Businessmen Still Blocked At Erez 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) \"Erez crossing is the real disaster,\" Yazgi said. 
\"Imagine that all of Gaza has to move through one 
six-meter-wide lane, with a gate at the end of it allowing 
one person through at a time.\"  Yazgi described a regime in 
which terminal staff accepts groups of ten to fifteen 
individuals every two to three hours for extensive screening 
procedures that take another hour and a half.  Businessmen 
are generally not a \"priority group\" and are called for 
screening only after humanitarian cases, of which there are 
frequently dozens, are cleared to cross.  This means that 
businessmen arriving at Erez 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning are 
only able to enter Israel in the afternoon.  Meetings in the 
West Bank, Tel Aviv, or Haifa are then almost impossible, he 
said, since permits are limited to one day.  By the time a 
businessman reaches his destination, he barely has time to 
turn around and get back to Erez on time. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
COGAT: GOI Committed to Better Crossings 
But Needs Money 
---------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Yitzhak Gurvitch, head of COGAT\'s economic division, 
told Econoff November 20 that the GOI has adopted a clear 
goal of increasing trade into and out of the Gaza Strip by 
increasing capacity at the Karni terminal in tandem with 
disengagement.  Before the intifada, he said, Karni was 
processing some 700 container-bearing trucks per day, and 
sometimes up to 1,000.  The terminal has the potential to 
process between 1,000 and 1,500 containers per day with the 
installation of two new movable container scanners and 
complete utilization of a two-shift schedule.  These two 
scanners are in addition to the scanner the PA purchased and 
the GOI installed at Karni in August.  The GOI\'s November 
response to the World Bank\'s report states that waiting time 
at Karni can be reduced to as low as 24 hours, depending on 
the establishment of a center for ordering and coordination. 
There is only one problem, he said -- the GOI does not have 
enough money for these improvements.  It can be done only 
with assistance from the U.S., the World Bank, or the 
international donor community. 
 
9.  (SBU) In November meetings with USAID representatives, 
Dr. Yair Hirschfeld of the Economic Cooperation Foundation 
said that the GOI is considering investing USD 20 million in 
a complete overhaul of the Erez crossing.  The overhaul would 
enable the terminal to accommodate a greatly increased number 
of passengers, as well as serve as the primary terminal for 
the import of container goods into the Gaza Strip.  A 
proposed rail line from Ashdod to Erez would bring imports to 
the terminal much faster than they are currently arriving. 
This would free up Karni to deal primarily with the export of 
empty containers and Gazan products, and ensure redundancy in 
the crossings regime. 
 
10.  (C) Gurvitch added that improved security technology at 
Erez would enable the GOI to issue a much higher number of 
business permits to Gazans, in principle \"without limit,\" 
under similar standards as those used currently, including 
references from Israeli counterparts or membership in a 
chamber of commerce.  \"The important thing is not that 
Israeli businessmen can get into Gaza, but that Gazan 
businessmen can get out,\" he said.

Israel Radio reported that, commenting on reports from 
Cairo, Deputy State Department Spokesman J. Adam Ereli, 
said on Wednesday: \"We\'re not party to any reported 
grant initiative, nor am I aware of any plans to host a 
conference or some other kind of multilateral ceremony, 
with respect to a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian 
question.\"  However, Ereli mentioned the United States\' 
involvement in current regional developments in close 
cooperation with the Palestinians, with the Israelis, 
with the Egyptians and with others, notably on the 
issue of the upcoming Palestinian elections.  Israel 
Radio quoted Israel\'s Ambassador to the U.S. Danny 
Ayalon as saying in Washington Wednesday that the 
convening of an international convention is a \"failed 
idea,\" and that one should wait until it becomes known 
who will lead the PA after the elections there. 
 
The three major dailies bannered the political 
situation in Israel.  Ha\'aretz quoted associates of PM 
Sharon as saying that Sharon hopes to present a new 
government to the Knesset within 10 days of today\'s 
meeting of the Likud Central Committee, which will 
decide whether the Labor Party will enter the 
government.  Maariv quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz 
as saying that he will vie for Likud chairmanship \"in 
the post-Sharon era.\" 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Israel has called reported 
accusations from the U.S. Wednesday that its defense 
officials were engaged in industrial espionage \"a 
misunderstanding\" based on chutzpa and general nosiness 
on the part of the Israelis.  Ha\'aretz reported that 
the Defense Ministry delegation in New York is 
instructing army officers and representatives of the 
Israeli defense industries currently in the U.S. 
regarding working procedures in the U.S.  This 
activity, which is led by Defense Ministry D-G Amos 
Yaron, is a consequence of the allegations against 
Israel. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Palestinian delegates at the 
international conference of donors in Oslo as saying 
Wednesday that the Palestinians are interested in 
resuming talks with Israel as soon as possible. 
 
Leading media (banner in Hatzofe) quoted Disengagement 
Administration Director Yonatan Bassi as saying 
Wednesday that settlers slated for evacuation will be 
compensated in a series of low payments.  Ha\'aretz and 
other media reported that a number of Likud Knesset 
members who are opposed to Sharon\'s disengagement plan 
are pushing for an increase in state compensation for 
settlers to be evacuated under the pullout. 
 
Maariv reported that last May President Moshe Katsav 
contacted Syrian President Bashar Assad, offering to 
meet with him.  The newspaper reported that Assad 
accepted the suggestion, on condition Katsav represent 
the government.  The media cited contradictory 
responses by various Katsav associates. 
 
Leading media reported that talks took place in 
Brussels Wednesday between NATO and ministers from 
Israel and six Arab countries.  At the meeting, which 
dealt with terror, Israel was represented by Diaspora 
and Jerusalem Affairs Minister Natan Sharansky. 
Ha\'aretz quoted NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop as 
saying the alliance would agree to send peacekeepers to 
the Middle East only after an Israeli-Palestinian peace 
treaty is signed. 
 
Leading media reported that on Wednesday Sharon 
responded to allegations of immoral conduct within the 
IDF.  He told reporters: \"IDF soldiers are the most 
moral in the world.\"  Jerusalem Post quoted supporters 
of Mustafa Barghouti, a candidate in the January 9 
Palestinian elections, as saying that he was beaten by 
soldiers at a West Bank checkpoint late Wednesday. 
Yediot reported that Foreign Ministry D-G Ron Prosor is 
coordinating PR efforts to improve the attitude of IDF 
soldiers towards the Palestinian population and members 
of international bodies seeking to cross roadblocks. 
The newspaper reported that, among other actions, the 
Foreign Ministry will brief officers serving at 
roadblocks, and present to them examples from the 
international media coverage about how unnecessary 
incidents in the territories harm Israel. 
 
Leading media cited figures released Wednesday by the 
IDF: at least 29 innocent Palestinians -- out of 148 
civilians -- have been killed during the course of the 
year; the IDF has killed 119 terrorists in the West 
Bank this year. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited two new separate studies -- a joint 
research by a Hebrew University scholar and a Bethlehem 
University academic, and another one by a Hebrew 
University researcher -- that found that Israel\'s 
educational system is hardly better than the 
Palestinian one when it comes to inserting political 
messages in textbooks. 
 
Maariv (Ben Caspit) reported that next week at the 
Herzliya Conference Dr. Uzi Arad and two other 
strategic experts will propose a three-way solution to 
the Golan issue: Israel would evacuate about half of 
the Golan but retain its western part; in exchange, 
Jordan would transfer to Syria an area bordering the 
two countries, and receive a similar area of land from 
Israel in the Arava region. 
 
Leading media reported that the outgoing spokesman of 
the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, Israel Tikochinsky, 
appeared on Egyptian TV this week for the first time. 
He was quoted as saying: \"PM Sharon is serious in his 
intention... There is a golden opportunity for the 
Palestinians to prove that they are capable of acting 
responsibly.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted sources in the office of Hani al- 
Hassan, a member of Fatah\'s council who oversees the 
Fatah offices in the territories, as saying Wednesday 
that jailed Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti is expected 
to announce \"in the next 24 hours\" that he will 
withdraw from the race for PA leadership if his 
political demands are met.  In contrast, Jerusalem Post 
cited a denial by Ahmed Ghanem, the newly appointed 
head of Barghouti\'s election campaign, that Barghouti 
had decided to withdraw from the elections. 
 
Leading media reported that Wednesday the private 
Israeli airline Israir filed an 8-million shekel (about 
USD 1.85 million) lawsuit against national carrier El 
Al for allegedly misusing its monopoly position on the 
Tel Aviv-New York route. 
 
Yediot reported that the Foreign Ministry will launch a 
campaign in the CIS to warn local women against being 
lured into a \"fun job\" in Israel, telling them they 
could become victims of trafficking in persons. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited a poll published Wednesday by the 
(Palestinian) Jerusalem Media and Communication Center: 
-59.3 percent of Palestinians feel optimistic regarding 
the future in general compared with 45.3 percent last 
June. 
-56.7 percent of Palestinians said they supported a two- 
state solution to the conflict compared with 44.5 last 
June. 
-51.8 percent said they were opposed to \"military 
operations\" against Israeli targets and consider them 
harmful to Palestinian interests, compared with 26.9

Palestinians believe that terrorist attacks should 
continue compared with 65.4 percent last June.

I.  \"Mobilize For War\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(December 8): \"In this war over the drawing of a new, 
reasonable, agreed-upon border for Israel, perhaps even 
more than in the Six-Day War when the first unity 
government was established, a stable emergency 
government is needed that will focus on the main goal 
and in which the political interests of its various 
elements will take a back seat to the shared goal of 
beginning to end the occupation.... Those who view the 
very establishment of a unity government as a serious 
democratic aberration should understand that there is 
no more serious aberration in Israel\'s democracy than 
its control over 1.5 million Palestinians to whom that 
democracy does not apply.  The values of Israeli 
democracy today barely reach the checkpoints, and 
beyond these checkpoints, acts are done in the name of 
democracy about which most of the public would rather 
not know.  A unity government is not generally 
advisable, and certainly not in a normal democracy, 
which needs an effective opposition as it needs air to 
breathe.  But in the face of the anomaly of the ongoing 
occupation, none of this matters.  The arguments 
against a unity government are valid for the moment 
after the withdrawal. But for the withdrawal itself, 
the public and its elected officials must mobilize as 
for a war and carry out the task with as many political 
forces as possible consolidated behind it.\" 
 
 
II.  \"The Advantages of a Low Profile\" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (December 8): 
\"In the wake of Arafat\'s death and the changes in the 
Palestinian Authority, the Israeli disengagement plan 
is turning into a move that is no longer absolutely 
unilateral.... Israel\'s enemies in the Arab world can 
overlook a unilateral step taken by Israel, but not 
renewing the momentum of negotiations and recognizing 
Israel.  Elements such as Hamas, Iran or Islamic Jihad 
have no interest in the disengagement plan succeeding, 
and negotiations with the PA will only spur them to 
throw a wrench in the works to make it fail.   This is 
the paradox that Israel should have already learned to 
recognize from its past failed attempts: the \'much\' is 
the enemy of the realistic \'little.\'  Disengagement is 
a little, but it could develop into a lot, and relieve 
the Palestinian demographic density and lead to 
stability.  Anyone aspiring to much more than this is 
liable to lose even this little bit (the Americans in 
Iraq for example).  Israel has already understood this 
paradox in regard to Abu Mazen: leaving him alone for 
the next few months is the best help that Israel can 
give him..... Israel must therefore stick to its 
original, unilateral disengagement plan, and implement 
it diligently, modestly and with a low profile, while 
holding security coordination on the ground with the 
Palestinians, no more.  We must explain to our friends 
in the world that this disengagement will of itself 
create an opportunity for future negotiations, not the 
reverse.  The partying, the international conferences, 
the expectations and the symbols, if there is any need 
for them, can wait.\" 
 
III.  \"Anti-National Unity\" 
 
Settler leader Israel Harel wrote in Ha\'aretz (December 
8): \"Those who warned against the Oslo disaster, and 
were right by any measure of the results, are now 
saying that the uprooting of settlements will lead to 
disaster.  This of course refers to the internal 
national-Zionist schism, but also -- and for this the 
Labor Party was sent packing -- to national security. 
The disengagement is a moral and ideological victory -- 
in the Arab media, even in the \'moderate\' Arab states, 
the festivities are already in full swing -- by terror 
over the Zionists, who are being forced to uproot 
settlements.  The expected result, even if the Arabs 
offer a cease-fire for reorganizing, re-equipping and 
recharging their energies, is the continuation of the 
war of terror -- perhaps with even greater vigor.  The 
uprooting proves after all that when the Jews are 
badgered they capitulate, and if the badgering 
continues, they will continue to capitulate.  And the 
sea, if Allah wills it, is the limit.\"

6.  (SBU) ATTACKS: 
 
-- Deaths: UNRWA reported that IDF soldiers shot and killed 
four Palestinians, reportedly all armed, in two incidents 
overnight December 8-9 as the Palestinians attempting to 
smuggle weapons across the Gaza-Egyptian border at Rafah.  A 
fifth Palestinian was seriously wounded, according to the 
IDF. 
 
-- Injuries: UNRWA reported that IDF soldiers shot a

too close to Netzarim settlement.  The man was widely known 
to be mentally disabled, according to UNRWA. 
 
-- Mortars/Rockets: The IDF reported that a total of five 
mortar shells were fired at Israeli settler and IDF targets 
in the Gaza Strip December 8-9, and two anti-tank missiles 
were fired at Nissanit settlement December 8, according to 
the IDF. 
 
-- Shootings: The IDF reported that Palestinian militants 
launched a total of three shooting attacks December 8-9, two 
near Rafah and one near Neve Dekalim.

organizations to cross at Erez in vehicles, rather than on 
foot, with prior coordination through COGAT. 
 
-- The Erez Industrial Zone remained closed December 9. 
 
-- Sufa Crossing was closed for Palestinian laborers December 
9, but was open for the import of aggregates used in 
construction. 
 
-- Karni Terminal was open December 9, but reportedly 
operating slowly. 
 
-- Rafah Terminal was open for arrivals and departures 
December 9.  Although the IDF no longer prohibits the exit of 
male Palestinians age 16-35 from the Gaza Strip, lengthy 
checks at the border mean that few Palestinians in this 
category are actually able to exit.  There are no age 
restrictions for entry into Gaza. 
 
-- Tel al-Sultan checkpoint was open December 9.  Toufah 
checkpoint was open for residents of al-Mowassi.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KWBG, IS, SY, GOI INTERNAL 
SUBJECT: PERES: SUCCESS OF LIKUD-LABOR COALITION 
NEGOTIATIONS COULD BOIL DOWN TO PORTFOLIOS 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 6007 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Prior to the Likud Central Committee\'s 
positive vote on December 9 to  open coalition negotiations 
with the Labor Party, United Torah Judaism, and Shas (see 
septel), an obviously exhausted Labor Party leader Shimon 
Peres stressed to the Ambassador the depth of his own 
problems in convincing the Labor Party to join the coalition. 
 Peres repeatedly emphasized the \"limits in my capacity\" to 
bring Labor into a coalition without an offer from Prime 
Minister Sharon of at least one, and more reasonably, two 
major ministerial portfolios.  Peres also underlined his 
desire to see disengagement proceed and said elections in 
2005 would be a \"waste of five-to-six months\" during which 
time disengagement could have been implemented.  In a 
separate meeting with the Ambassador December 9, Labor Party 
Whip Isaac Herzog echoed Peres\' worries, and laid out a 
likely Labor Party timetable for approving a Sharon offer to 
join the coalition and possible ministerial assignments. 
 
2.  (C) Summary cont\'d:  In response to the Ambassador\'s 
query on the prospects of GOI negotiations with Syria, Peres 
stressed that it would not be feasible for the GOI to achieve 
settlement withdrawals both from Gaza and the Golan at the 
same time.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Unity Prospects Hinge on Portfolio Divisions 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Labor Party leader Shimon Peres stressed to the 
Ambassador December 9 that if Prime Minister Sharon offers 
\"meaningless portfolios\" to Labor for joining the coalition, 
there are \"limits\" in his capacity to bring his party into 
the coalition.  Peres agreed with the Ambassador that this 
could present an immediate impasse in Labor\'s coalition 
negotiations with Likud.  Noting that Labor would constitute 
one-third of a unity coalition, Peres underlined that Sharon 
should understand that Labor should receive one or two major 
ministerial portfolios.  Sharon should understand that Labor 
can not be satisfied with  \"secondary\" portfolios just to 
help Sharon pacify Likud opponents to a unity government, 
Peres emphasized. 
 
4.  (C) Peres explained that if Likud votes in favor of 
opening coalition negotiations with Labor -- as it did later 
December 9 with a 62 percent majority -- and Sharon 
immediately invites Peres to the negotiating table, Peres 
must first bring the issue before the Labor Party Bureau\'s 
240 members, which requires 48 hours notice before holding a 
meeting.  Obtaining the Bureau\'s approval will be a \"tough 
fight,\" Peres said, since it includes many ministerial 
portfolio contenders.  If the Bureau approves negotiating 
with Likud, Peres continued, the matter must then be taken 
before the party\'s Central Committee for a vote.  He did not 
specify when such a vote could occur. 
 
5.  (C) Labor Party Whip Isaac Herzog subsequently told 
Ambassador Kurtzer separately December 9, however, that Peres 
could bring the matter to the Party Bureau for a vote as 
early as December 11, and then to the Central Committee 
during its previously scheduled meeting December 12 when the 
party is supposed to decide on a date for party primaries. 
(Note: During the meeting with the Ambassador, Herzog 
received a call from Labor faction Chair Dalia Itzik to 
inform him that Ehud Barak and Peres had agreed on a 
compromise date for party primaries for June or July 2005, 
thereby avoiding a party showdown.  See reftel.  End note.) 
 
 
6.  (C) According to Herzog, Sharon intends to offer Peres 
eight ministerial portfolios, including what amounts to two 
ministerial portfolios in return for forgoing the foreign 
ministry.  In total, Sharon would offer 11 portfolios to 
Labor, UTJ and Shas, Herzog noted.  He said that Sharon would 
likely first bring Labor and the UTJ into the coalition and 
may even \"find a way later\" to return Shinui to the 
coalition.  Herzog opined that the main \"stumbling block\" in 
the portfolio negotiations will be that Sharon will not give 
Peres the portfolio of alternate prime minister, a post 
currently held by Likud MK and strong Sharon ally Ehud 
Olmert.  He said that Peres will likely be offered a role 
relating to implementing disengagement.  Labor may ask for 
the ministries of Interior, Transportation, and Education, 
but Herzog quickly added, \"I don\'t think we\'ll get them.\"  He 
opined that Sharon may offer instead the Internal Security 
and Labor and Welfare portfolios to Labor.  Herzog said that 
he believes Justice will remain with Likud MK Tzipi Livni. 
 
7.  (C) Herzog said that once a coalition agreement is 
reached with Likud, perhaps as early as December 16, Labor 
would then decide on its candidates for ministerial 
portfolios, most likely shortly after that decision.  He then 
shot off a list of Labor contenders for ministerial slots in 
order of importance, including Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Ephraim 
Sneh, Matan Vilna\'i, Dalia Itzik, himself, Ofir Pines-Paz, 
and Shalom Simhon.  Herzog noted several times in the meeting 
that he was showing up as \"very popular\" within the Labor 
Party.  These candidates would likely be voted as ministerial 
candidates through either separate internal party votes or by 
a single vote on a \"coalition list\" that Peres would propose. 
 Herzog opined that Chaim Ramon may not be popular enough 
within Labor to receive a portfolio.  In response to the 
Ambassador\'s query, Herzog said that Barak would not seek a 
portfolio. 
 
--------------------- 
Window of Opportunity 
--------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Peres noted said that while Sharon could create a 
majority government without Labor, such a coalition would not 
support disengagement.  Elections would likely be the result 
if a unity government with Labor can not be formed, Peres 
noted.  \"I don\'t want this government to fall,\" Peres 
stressed, since elections would \"waste five-to-six months\" of 
2005 and postpone implementation of the disengagement plan. 
Reflecting his desire to join with Sharon now, Peres said 
that: \"I feel if I don\'t put my strength into (advancing 
disengagement), it will not work.... I am fighting for a 
cause.\"  Peres noted that while he does not like the 
disengagement plan, it represents the best hope to move the 
peace process forward. 
 
9.  (C) Herzog also commented on the need to move 
disengagement forward speedily, but from the perspective that 
Peres himself is waning in strength and focus.  \"Peres has 
the chance to help Sharon,\" Herzog stressed.  He noted, 
however, that there is only a small window of opportunity 
since Peres \"is not the same...is weak and not focused.\"  On 
Labor support for disengagement, Herzog explained that the 
three main constituencies in Labor -- the \"good\" settlement 
movement consisting of Kibbutzim and moshavs, the 
Israeli-Arab sector, and the veterans and elderly -- 
reluctantly support disengagement for varying reasons.  He 
stressed that to gain the support of the elderly, Labor would 
have to bring some economic benefits for that group to the 
coalition table with Likud.  \"There will be a big debate on 
economic issues with Likud,\" Herzog stressed.  \"(Finance 
Minister Netanyahu) Bibi hates us and we hate Bibi,\" Herzog 
said. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Negotiations on the Golan, Not Now Feasible 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (S) Asked by the Ambassador how he viewed opening 
negotiations with Syria, Peres noted that there is an \"open\" 
or public GOI position on this issue and a \"private one.\" 
Peres explained that the GOI\'s public position is that it 
cannot agree to negotiations with Syria while that country 
continues to host terrorist organizations.  According to 
Peres, the GOI\'s realistic and private position is that 
Israel cannot -- for domestic reasons -- feasibly negotiate 
with Syria on settlement withdrawals from the Golan at the 
same time it moves forward with settlement withdrawal from 
Gaza.  Peres also noted it would be problematic for Israel to 
negotiate with President Assad, who represents only a 
minority in Syria and whose actions are based on his desire 
to improve his world image.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media reported that the Likud Central Committee 
Thursday voted, 62 to 38 percent, in favor of the 
inclusion of the Labor Party and the two ultra-Orthodox 
parties (Shas and United Torah Judaism) in the 
government.  Israel Radio reported that PM Sharon 
called Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres to invite 
Labor to unity talks.  Both Yediot and Maariv banner: 
\"\'Yes\' to Unity.\"  Hatzofe\'s banner: \"Sharon Won: 
Rigging Was Carried Out in Broad Daylight.\"  Israel 
Radio Thursday reported that the Labor Party, reaching 
a compromise between the positions of Shimon Peres and 
Ehud Barak, decided to hold primaries in June 29, 2005. 
Maariv quoted Peres associates as saying that he might 
not run for Labor chairmanship. 
 
Jerusalem Post notes that Thursday, in radio 
interviews, Sharon suddenly started talking about the 
\"plan to leave Gaza,\" instead of the \"unilateral 
disengagement plan\" as he had named his initiative 
until now.  Yediot reported that Israel plans to 
transfer areas in the northern Gaza Strip to full 
security responsibility of the PA even before the 
disengagement in July 2005.  One of the goals of the 
move is to examine the PA\'s ability to rein in the 
anarchy in these areas. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited an AP story that Egypt confirmed 
Thursday that it will gain tariff-free access to the 
U.S. market for some key goods under a joint Israeli 
deal. 
 
Egyptian Charge d\'Affaires in Israel Tareq al-Quoni was 
quoted as saying in an interview with Ha\'aretz: \"We are 
certain that the Syrians are serious in their 
intentions to renew negotiations and we believe the 
Israel should consider this favorably.\"  Nahum Barnea 
of Yediot, who this weekend attended a Washington 
meeting organized by the Brookings Institution\'s Saban 
Center for Middle East Policy, reported that all 
present and past influential Americans who spoke at the 
gathering -- including former U.S. president Bill 
Clinton, former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, and 
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz -- warned 
against Israel holding talks with Syria.  Maariv 
reported that the Knesset has readied technical 
arrangements for a possible visit by Syrian President 
Bashar Assad. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited the Israeli defense establishment 
as saying that it can start building over 180 km of the 
security fence in the strategic West Bank.  However, 
the newspaper says that Sharon is delaying the final 
approval of the route so as not to upset settlers. 
Ha\'aretz cited the state\'s arguments in response to a 
petition by West Bank villages shut in a conclave by 
the fence: the state says that not only are they not 
harmed by the fence, but that they \"benefit from it.\" 
 
Yediot cited a warning by the GOI\'s anti-terror HQ that 
Israelis traveling to Iraq are putting their lives at 
risk. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Thursday the EU ratified its 
European Neighborhood Policy, but that Israel still has 
to sign it.  The radio says that Israel is expected to 
give up reservations on a WMD clause included in the 
treaty, in exchange for the many benefits provided in 
the agreement.  In another development, French 
Ambassador to Israel Gerard Araud told IDF Radio 
Thursday that Israelis suffer from \"mental 
disturbances\" in their attitude toward France.  He was 
protesting against what he said was anti-French 
sentiment in Israeli society and media.  The media 
reported that the Foreign Ministry protested to France 
over Araud\'s remarks. 
 
Leading media reported that Thursday the IDF killed 
four Palestinians it claims were smuggling arms in the 
Gaza Strip, but that it failed in an attempt on the 
life of Jamal Abu Samhadana, the head of the Popular 
Resistance Committees in Rafah. 
 
Leading media reported that Thursday a column of 1,000 
vehicles dubbed the \"convoy of determination\" made its 
way from Israel to the Gush Katif settlement bloc in 
the Gaza Strip.  Ha\'aretz web site reported that 
settlers on Thursday uprooted 117 olive trees in the 
Palestinian village of Jayyus, adjacent to the Zufin 
settlement near Qalqilya. 
 
Leading media reported that an IDF investigation into 
the killing of Islamic Jihad activist Mahmoud Kmel by 
members of a naval commando (\"Shayetet 13\") has 
concluded that the actions of Shayetet 13 suffered from 
operational, not moral flaws.  Ha\'aretz quoted soldiers 
who shot the injured man from 40 meters as saying they 
thought he had a second weapon. 
 
Leading media reported that Wednesday a jury in a 
Chicago federal courthouse ordered four Islamic 
charities accused of raising money for Hamas to pay USD 
156 million dollars in damages to the parents of David 
Boim, a teenager slain in the West Bank in May 1996. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted four members of the Norwegian 
Nobel Peace Prize Committee, who awarded the 1994 Prize 
to Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, as 
saying that they had made the right choice, and that 
Rabin\'s assassination, rather than Palestinian 
terrorism, was the prime factor in the collapse of the 
Oslo process. 
In a feature about National Security Advisor and 
secretary of state-designate Condoleezza Rice, Hatzofe 
 
SIPDIS 
calls her the \"jewel in the crown.\" 
 
All media reported that two Israeli scientists -- 
Profs. Avram Hershko and Aaron Ciechanover -- will be 
awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in Stockholm 
today, along with the American Irwin Rose.

I.  \"Anti-Disengagement Strategy Collapses\" 
 
Jerusalem and settlements correspondent Nadav Shragai 
wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 
10): \"Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\'s victory in the 
Likud convention destroyed the strategy adopted in 
recent months by almost all of the disengagement\'s 
opponents.... The anti-disengagement activists are 
still pinning their hopes on the Likud rebels, but it 
is hard to believe that they would vote no confidence 
in Sharon, and force elections, after the party 
convention rejected this option.... If [persuasion 
activity among the ultra-Orthodox parties and the 
Likud] fails, the right wing will probably take the 
course outlined in the last edition of the settlers\' 
publication Nekudah by the highly respected Rabbi 
Ya\'akov Medan, of [the settlement of] Alon Shvut. 
Medan wrote 10 days ago: \"Sharon has been shown as one 
who is afraid of the nation and wants a violent 
struggle.  Now we must prepare for a physical struggle 
of tens of thousands of people who will stop the 
uprooting and destruction with their bodies.\" 
 
II.  \"Taming the Shrew\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one 
of popular, pluralist Maariv (December 10): \"It seemed 
impossible, it was difficult, it went slowly, but it 
finally happened: the Prime Minister succeeded in 
taming his party.... The shrewish party has been tamed, 
the twitching has receded and the body is slowly but 
surely beginning to accept the transplant.... Sharon 
will try to bring [the senior Labor Party members] in 
with portfolios, so that they will stay.  Shas will 
receive a \'coordinated disengagement\' speech on 
Thursday in Herzliya, in order to assist [its mentor] 
Rabbi Ovadia Yosef to change his ruling and join as 
well.  Sharon needs to finalize things this week 
quickly, firmly and elegantly, otherwise he will get 
bogged down again, perhaps for the last time.  This is 
the time to work fast or to cease to be.\" 
 
III.  \"Now to Work\" 
 
Political commentator Nehama Dueck wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (December 10): 
\"The Likud took another step Thursday towards parting 
from the Greater Israel dream.  The Central Committee 
authorized Sharon to bring the Labor Party into the 
government, and in fact gave him carte blanche to 
implement the disengagement plan.  The significance is 
known and clear: dismantling settlements in Samaria 
[the northern West Bank] and a pullout from Gaza after 
three decades of Jewish settlement.  Precisely a year 
ago, the Prime Minister launched the disengagement plan 
in a speech he gave at the Herzliya Conference.  Next 
Thursday he will go to this forum once again.  The 
speech is not yet ready, but the message is clear. 
Sharon marked a target, showed leadership and led.  And 
even if the tactics were not always successful, 
yesterday\'s result showed that the strategy was 
correct.\" 
 
IV.  \"A Propitious Hour\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
Maariv (December 10): \"Contrary to the Left\'s claim, 
there had been no Palestinian negotiating partner since 
2000, but the determined war against terror, which was 
based on the correct assumption that there\'s no one to 
talk to in Ramallah, produced a new reality in the Arab 
world -- that there is someone to talk.... The official 
Palestinian leadership is quietly asking the U.S. and 
Egypt to rein in the Iranians and Hizbullah in the West 
Bank and Gaza.  The senior Israeli officials are well 
aware of this fact.  It is particularly important.... 
Cairo and London are interested in an international 
conference.  Washington is cautious about answering 
positively, but it doesn\'t completely reject the idea - 
- certainly not when Egypt took a hasty step by 
declaring, one day before the voting started at the 
Likud Central Committee, that it would convene an 
international conference that has not been agreed 
upon.... Israel is now in a state of intoxication.... A 
world of hope has suddenly opened up.... One needs to 
pray that the government won\'t let this window of 
opportunity lock itself again. 
 
V.  \"The Egyptian Way\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(December 10): \"Egypt cannot be expected to retreat 
from its traditional demand that the Palestinian state 
be established mainly on lands previously ruled by 
Israel.  However, it is no secret that even if and when 
the Palestinians obtain the entire West Bank and Gaza 
Strip, it will be a tall order to contain within those 
small and disjointed areas a viable state and a 
functioning economy.   This is where a newly 
conciliatory Egypt can come in.   Egypt brings to the 
current situation two elements no one else has in the 
context of the Palestinian problem: regional leadership 
and available land.... Egypt certainly owes this to no 
one... [But] in the dunes where Israel once began 
developing the Yamit settlements, until they were 
demolished on the eve of their relinquishment to Egypt, 
Egypt can today offer to donate its own contribution to 
Palestinian statehood in the form of a coastal strip 
that would extend from the Gaza Strip toward Port Said. 
Such an out-of-the-box initiative would prod both 
Israel and the Palestinians to make concessions they 
might otherwise shun, and inspire foreign investors to 
develop the northern Sinai, so it can ultimately 
linchpin a vast Riviera stretching from Alexandria to 
Beirut.  Perhaps the drama of Anwar Sadat\'s visit to 
Jerusalem cannot be duplicated, but there are other 
ways Egypt might inspire the world with its dedication 
to the cause of peace.\"

SUBJECT: SHARON WINS LIKUD GREEN LIGHT TO NEGOTIATE WITH A 
PORTFOLIO-FOCUSED LABOR PARTY 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norman Olsen for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) The Likud Central Committee\'s 62 percent majority 
vote in favor of opening coalition negotiations with Labor, 
United Torah Judaism (UTJ), and Shas is an important victory 
in Prime Minister Sharon\'s long struggle to broaden his 
minority government, which has dwindled down to 40 Likud MKs. 
 Embassy sources believe that Sharon will choose to  bring 
Labor and the UTJ into the coalition now, and only later 
consider inviting Shas, due to Shas\' opposition to 
disengagement.  A coalition composed of Likud, Labor (19 MKs) 
and UTJ (five MKs) would give Sharon a majority coalition of 
64 MKs.  Once Histadrut Chair Amir Peretz\'s Am Ehad party is 
formally part of the Labor Party in January, that party\'s two 
seats will be added to the coalition. 
 
2.  (C) Prime Minister Sharon made the long-anticipated call 
to Labor Party leader Peres December 10, inviting the 81-year 
old statesman to the negotiating table.  Peres will likely 
bring the issue of entering coalition negotiations with Likud 
before his own party\'s governing bodies December 11 and 12, a 
move expected to create intra-party battles with what Labor 
contacts say are unpredictable results.  Labor Whip Isaac 
Herzog told the Ambassador December 9 that Labor could decide 
on the matter at its December 12 Central Committee meeting, 
which is being held to vote on a date for party primaries 
(septel).  Herzog estimated that an agreement between Labor 
and Likud could be wrapped up as early as December 16, 
although he stressed that battles over ministerial portfolios 
and economic issues would likely emerge between Labor and 
Likud during the negotiations.  Herzog explained that shortly 
after a coalition agreement is reached, the Labor Party 
governing bodies would vote on Labor candidates for eight 
ministerial portfolios that Herzog expects Sharon to offer 
Labor as part of the coalition agreement (see septel).  Once 
the portfolios are sorted out between Likud, Labor and UTJ -- 
the latter having traditionally shied away from accepting 
Cabinet seats -- Sharon would present a new government before 
the Knesset for its likely approval.

-- Rafah Terminal was open for arrivals and departures 
December 10.  Although the IDF no longer prohibits the exit 
of male Palestinians age 16-35 from the Gaza Strip, lengthy 
checks at the border mean that few Palestinians in this 
category are actually able to exit.  There are no age 
restrictions for entry into Gaza. 
 
-- Tel al-Sultan checkpoint was closed December 10.  Toufah 
checkpoint was open for residents of al-Mowassi.

SUBJECT: PERES: SUCCESS OF LIKUD-LABOR COALITION 
NEGOTIATIONS COULD BOIL DOWN TO PORTFOLIOS 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 6007 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 
(b,d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Prior to the Likud Central Committee\'s 
positive vote on December 9 to  open coalition negotiations 
with the Labor Party, United Torah Judaism, and Shas (see 
septel), an obviously exhausted Labor Party leader Shimon 
Peres stressed to the Ambassador the depth of his own 
problems in convincing the Labor Party to join the 
coalition.  Peres repeatedly emphasized the \"limits in my 
capacity\" to bring Labor into a coalition without an offer 
from Prime Minister Sharon of at least one, and more 
reasonably, two major ministerial portfolios.  Peres also 
underlined his desire to see disengagement proceed and said 
elections in 2005 would be a \"waste of five-to-six months\" 
during which time disengagement could have been 
implemented.  In a separate meeting with the Ambassador 
December 9, Labor Party Whip Isaac Herzog echoed Peres\' 
worries, and laid out a likely Labor Party timetable for 
approving a Sharon offer to join the coalition and possible 
ministerial assignments. 
 
2.  (C) Summary cont\'d:  In response to the Ambassador\'s 
query on the prospects of GOI negotiations with Syria, 
Peres stressed that it would not be feasible for the GOI to 
achieve settlement withdrawals both from Gaza and the Golan 
at the same time.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Unity Prospects Hinge on Portfolio Divisions 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Labor Party leader Shimon Peres stressed to the 
Ambassador December 9 that if Prime Minister Sharon offers 
\"meaningless portfolios\" to Labor for joining the 
coalition, there are \"limits\" in his capacity to bring his 
party into the coalition.  Peres agreed with the Ambassador 
that this could present an immediate impasse in Labor\'s 
coalition negotiations with Likud.  Noting that Labor would 
constitute one-third of a unity coalition, Peres underlined 
that Sharon should understand that Labor should receive one 
or two major ministerial portfolios.  Sharon should 
understand that Labor can not be satisfied with 
\"secondary\" portfolios just to help Sharon pacify Likud 
opponents to a unity government, Peres emphasized. 
 
4.  (C) Peres explained that if Likud votes in favor of 
opening coalition negotiations with Labor -- as it did 
later December 9 with a 62 percent majority -- and Sharon 
immediately invites Peres to the negotiating table, Peres 
must first bring the issue before the Labor Party Bureau\'s 
240 members, which requires 48 hours notice before holding 
a meeting.  Obtaining the Bureau\'s approval will be a 
\"tough fight,\" Peres said, since it includes many 
ministerial portfolio contenders.  If the Bureau approves 
negotiating with Likud, Peres continued, the matter must 
then be taken before the party\'s Central Committee for a 
vote.  He did not specify when such a vote could occur. 
 
5.  (C) Labor Party Whip Isaac Herzog subsequently told 
Ambassador Kurtzer separately December 9, however, that 
Peres could bring the matter to the Party Bureau for a vote 
as early as December 11, and then to the Central Committee 
during its previously scheduled meeting December 12 when 
the party is supposed to decide on a date for party 
primaries.  (Note: During the meeting with the Ambassador, 
Herzog received a call from Labor faction Chair Dalia Itzik 
to inform him that Ehud Barak and Peres had agreed on a 
compromise date for party primaries for June or July 2005, 
thereby avoiding a party showdown.  See reftel.  End 
note.) 
 
6.  (C) According to Herzog, Sharon intends to offer Peres 
eight ministerial portfolios, including what amounts to two 
ministerial portfolios in return for forgoing the foreign 
ministry.  In total, Sharon would offer 11 portfolios to 
Labor, UTJ and Shas, Herzog noted.  He said that Sharon 
would likely first bring Labor and the UTJ into the 
coalition and may even \"find a way later\" to return Shinui 
to the coalition.  Herzog opined that the main \"stumbling 
block\" in the portfolio negotiations will be that Sharon 
will not give Peres the portfolio of alternate prime 
minister, a post currently held by Likud MK and strong 
Sharon ally Ehud Olmert.  He said that Peres will likely be 
offered a role relating to implementing disengagement. 
Labor may ask for the ministries of Interior, 
Transportation, and Education, but Herzog quickly added, \"I 
don\'t think we\'ll get them.\"  He opined that Sharon may 
offer instead the Internal Security and Labor and Welfare 
portfolios to Labor.  Herzog said that he believes Justice 
will remain with Likud MK Tzipi Livni. 
 
7.  (C) Herzog said that once a coalition agreement is 
reached with Likud, perhaps as early as December 16, Labor 
would then decide on its candidates for ministerial 
portfolios, most likely shortly after that decision.  He 
then shot off a list of Labor contenders for ministerial 
slots in order of importance, including Binyamin 
Ben-Eliezer, Ephraim Sneh, Matan Vilna\'i, Dalia Itzik, 
himself, Ofir Pines-Paz, and Shalom Simhon.  Herzog noted 
several times in the meeting that he was showing up as 
\"very popular\" within the Labor Party.  These candidates 
would likely be voted as ministerial candidates through 
either separate internal party votes or by a single vote on 
a \"coalition list\" that Peres would propose.  Herzog opined 
that Chaim Ramon may not be popular enough within Labor to 
receive a portfolio.  In response to the Ambassador\'s 
query, Herzog said that Barak would not seek a portfolio. 
 
--------------------- 
Window of Opportunity 
--------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Peres noted said that while Sharon could create a 
majority government without Labor, such a coalition would 
not support disengagement.  Elections would likely be the 
result if a unity government with Labor can not be formed, 
Peres noted.  \"I don\'t want this government to fall,\" Peres 
stressed, since elections would \"waste five-to-six months\" 
of 2005 and postpone implementation of the disengagement 
plan.  Reflecting his desire to join with Sharon now, Peres 
said that: \"I feel if I don\'t put my strength into 
[advancing disengagement], it will not work.... I am 
fighting for a cause.\"  Peres noted that while he does not 
like the disengagement plan, it represents the best hope to 
move the peace process forward. 
 
9.  (C) Herzog also commented on the need to move 
disengagement forward speedily, but from the perspective 
that Peres himself is waning in strength and focus.  \"Peres 
has the chance to help Sharon,\" Herzog stressed.  He noted, 
however, that there is only a small window of opportunity 
since Peres \"is not the same...is weak and not focused.\" 
On Labor support for disengagement, Herzog explained that 
the three main constituencies in Labor -- the \"good\" 
settlement movement consisting of Kibbutzim and moshavs, 
the Israeli-Arab sector, and the veterans and elderly -- 
reluctantly support disengagement for varying reasons.  He 
stressed that to gain the support of the elderly, Labor 
would have to bring some economic benefits for that group 
to the coalition table with Likud.  \"There will be a big 
debate on economic issues with Likud,\" Herzog stressed. 
\"[Finance Minister Netanyahu] Bibi hates us and we hate 
Bibi,\" Herzog said. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Negotiations on the Golan, Not Now Feasible 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (S) Asked by the Ambassador how he viewed opening 
negotiations with Syria, Peres noted that there is an 
\"open\" or public GOI position on this issue and a \"private 
one.\"   Peres explained that the GOI\'s public position is 
that it cannot agree to negotiations with Syria while that 
country continues to host terrorist organizations. 
According to Peres, the GOI\'s realistic and private 
position is that Israel cannot -- for domestic reasons -- 
feasibly negotiate with Syria on settlement withdrawals 
from the Golan at the same time it moves forward with 
settlement withdrawal from Gaza.  Peres also noted it would 
be problematic for Israel to negotiate with President 
Assad, who represents only a minority in Syria and whose 
actions are based on his desire to improve his world image.

\"sickly fervor\" to publish information about alleged 
immorality among IDF troops.

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote on page one 
of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: 
\"Already, more than a year ago, we learned that 
terrorist groups in Gaza were moving on from primitive 
terrorist activity to guerrilla activity inspired by 
Hizbullah.... But somebody on our side missed the 
target by a mile.\" 
 
Security and intelligence affairs commentator Amit 
Cohen wrote in popular, pluralist Maariv: \"These people 
[the extremist Palestinian groups] can do to Abu Mazen

increasing tensions between Jerusalem and Washington.\" 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Under the Nose of the IDF\" 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote on page one 
of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot 
(December 13): \"It is intolerable for guerrilla 
activity on this scale and of this quality to develop 
under our nose for so many months, completely 
undetected.  Guerrilla activity, as we learned in 
Lebanon, is more sophisticated than the terrorism that 
we have known in the Gaza Strip, but it is also more 
exposed, because it requires more organization and 
resources.  Already, more than a year ago, we learned 
that terrorist groups in Gaza were moving on from 
primitive terrorist activity to guerrilla activity 
inspired by Hizbullah, which also supplied the know- 
how.  This called for a different form of offensive and 
intelligence activity on the part of the IDF.  But 
somebody on our side missed the target by a mile.... 
Now the army will have to tailor a military operation 
appropriate to the spirit of the times: it will be 
painful enough to deter Hamas, but it will also take 
account of Israel\'s relations with Egypt, of the 
international observers who will be arriving in the 
region and also of the rise in Abu Mazen\'s popularity 
in the polls.\" 
 
II.  \"Clear Signal to Abu Mazen\" 
 
Security and intelligence affairs commentator Amit 
Cohen wrote in popular, pluralist Maariv (December 13): 
\"If for a moment it seemed that Abu Mazen was 
succeeding in taking control of the Palestinian 
imbroglio, at least until the coming elections, the 
terror attack last night reminded us how fragile that 
illusion was....  Publicly, the Palestinian leadership 
in the making will find it hard to condemn the 
operation.  As long as the IDF continues to operate in 
Gaza, the Palestinians view the area as a legitimate 
killing field.  But behind closed doors, there is a 
great deal of anger about the double game being played 
by Hamas.  \'Certainly Abu Mazen is angry when he hears 
about things like this,\' said a Palestinian security 
source.  \'But what can we do?  The understandings we 
reached with Hamas spoke only about terror attacks 
inside Israeli territory\'.... This is the second signal 
that Abu Mazen received from Fatah elements in Gaza. 
The first was several days after Arafat\'s death, when 
shots were fired at Abu Mazen and Dahlan.  This time as 
well, the centers of power within the Gaza Strip are 
trying to signal that their ability to influence does 
not stop at the ballot box next January.  These people 
can do to Abu Mazen what Israel did to Arafat: make him 
into an irrelevant leader.\" 
 
III.  \"The Arabs Are Coming!  The Arabs Are Coming!\" 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar\'el wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 12): \"The 
great wonder has already occurred, even before half a 
tile has been removed from the roof of a house in the 
Gush Katif settlement bloc or before even one 
settlement outpost (remember that issue?) has folded: 
Ariel Sharon received the legitimization he needs from 
the President of Egypt, and there is no one, at least 
not in the coming week, to challenge that in the Arab 
states, especially when even Syrian President Bashar 
Assad is ready to talk to Sharon and Yasser Arafat is 
no longer in the picture.  Sharon grabbed the reins of 
the diplomatic process with the object of steering it 
not when he declared the disengagement plan but when he 
proved that he is ready to take great risks to 
implement it.  Egypt understood very quickly that this 
is the only wagon on which any sort of process can be 
moved ahead; as such, it opened the periodic window of 
opportunity of the peace process, while an array of 
hitchhikers wait by the roadside.  Now the Arab states, 
too, are waiting to see whether the democratic process 
in Israel -- in the form of the activists of the Likud 
Central Committee -- doesn\'t tip over at the first 
sharp turn.\" 
 
IV.  \"Sharon Has Come Home\" 
 
Political commentator Shalom Yerushalmi wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (December 13): \"[Until 
recently,] the Prime Minister was perceived as someone 
who had lost his political base.  But Sharon came to 
his senses at the eleventh hour.  Today he has an 
anchor.  Members of the [Likud] Central Committee are 
behind him, even if many of them hate the disengagement 
plan.... Sharon has now returned home.  With the Likud 
he can buttress a much more serious political status 
ahead of the disengagement.  This is bad news for the 
settlers and the leaders of the Council of Jewish 
Settlements in the Territories, who have effectively 
led the Likud in the past few months; they will now 
have to find new channels for their activity.  Perhaps 
they will focus on broad popular opposition activity -- 
something in which they excel.\" 
 
 
V.  \"Run Barghouti, Run\" 
 
Zuheir Andrawus, Editor-in-Chief of the Israeli-Arab 
newspaper Kul Al-Arab, wrote in Ha\'aretz (December 12): 
\"[Marwan] Barghouti is the authentic representative of 
the Palestinian people, which has know a lot of 
suffering.... To many members of Palestinian society, 
he is a freedom fighter who has paid a hefty price. 
Thus, the people won\'t betray him and would vote for 
him, be it only in defiance of the old leadership, 
which has to leave.  Barghouti symbolizes all those 
Palestinians who have paid a heavy price for the 
liberation of their people from the burden of Israeli 
occupation -- and he hasn\'t made a fortune.  Therefore, 
run, Barghouti, and don\'t give up.\" 
VI.  \"Reading the Egyptian Sphinx\" 
 
Efraim Inbar, Director of the Begin-Sadat Center for 
Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, wrote in 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (December 12): 
\"More vigorous American peace-making in the Arab- 
Israeli arena would not only divert energy from the 
push for reform in the Arab world; it also has the 
potential for increasing tensions between Jerusalem and 
Washington.  Egypt well understands that the Bush 
vision of a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict is 
closer to its own vision than to Sharon\'s prescription. 
A renewal of Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Syrian 
peace talks might therefore put stress on Israel\'s 
relationship with Washington.  Weakening Israel is not 
inimical to Egyptian interests.  What should Israel\'s 
response be?  While Egypt obviously has its own agenda, 
Israel should welcome any improvement in bilateral 
relations.   However, Jerusalem must demand that Cairo 
live up to its 1979 peace treaty commitments.\"

\"Say Yes to Syria\" 
 
Uri Savir, chief Israeli negotiator with Syria from 
November 1995 to March 1996, wrote in conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post (December 12): \"Our region 
is too fragile for a step-by-step approach, as each 
step may potentially be sabotaged by the opponents of 
stability, democratization and peace.  Accordingly, the 
Bush administration could encourage a quantum leap in 
the region by suggesting guiding principles for 
negotiations on all fronts, with an emphasis on 
regional cooperation, which is part of the Bush vision. 
Israel should adhere to such a strategy and, in this 
context, accept the Syrian offer for negotiations 
without preconditions.... It seems that in most of our 
negotiations about this region, we know the end result 
-- more or less.  However, we don\'t know how to 
begin.... There seems to be little doubt about the 
changing currents in Syria, yet many believe that Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon cannot wage a peace offensive on 
Gaza and Syria simultaneously.  Israel has, in the 
past, won wars on many fronts.  In the future it should 
attempt to make peace on all these fronts.  The Middle 
East has moved in recent months from despair to hope. 
It is in Israel\'s best interest not to miss this window 
of opportunity.\"

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Yediot reported that President Bush told Jewish leaders 
in the White House on Monday that \"Arik Sharon\" made a 
brilliant decision to unilaterally withdraw from the 
Gaza Strip -- a particularly difficult decision from 
one of the founders of the settlements there -- and 
that this was the right way for Israel at this time. 
 
Leading media reported that PM Sharon ordered the IDF 
to act forcefully against the threat of tunnels in the 
Gaza Strip.  Yediot and other media quoted Sharon as 
saying Monday that if Palestinian terror attacks 
continue, Israel will not coordinate with the 
Palestinians in evacuating the Gaza Strip and the 
northernmost part of the West Bank.  Israel Radio 
reported that last night an IDF force entered Khan 
Yunis, where it demolished buildings that reportedly 
were mostly used in attacks against Israel.  The radio 
also reported that retired Maj. Gen. Amos Gilad will 
supposedly travel to Egypt to meet with top Egyptian 
intelligence official Omar Suleiman, in order to 
coordinate the positioning of Egyptian forces along the 
Philadelphi route.  Jerusalem Post reported that 
warning of immediate danger, Deputy Internal Security 
Minister Jacob Edery called on the GOI Monday to 
immediately begin constructing a security fence along 
the border with Egypt. 
 
Yediot reported that Trade, Industry and Employment 
Ehud Olmert will meet with Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak in Cairo today.  Olmert is expected to convey a 
message from Sharon regarding Israel\'s demand that 
Egypt prevent terrorist attacks from Gaza and arms 
smuggling into the Strip.  Jerusalem Post and Yediot 
reported that Olmert will sign a free trade agreement 
with Egyptian Foreign Trade and Industry Minister 
Rashid Mohamed Rashid and USTR Robert Zoellick 
involving the creation of Qualified Industrial Zones 
(QIZ). 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the focal point of British PM 
Tony Blair\'s visit to Israel and the PA next week will 
be his initiative to convene a conference in support of 
the Palestinians following the scheduled January 9 
elections in the PA.  Yediot quoted sources closes to 
Sharon as saying that Sharon will not agree to British 
initiatives regarding such a conference because this is 
an attempt to jump over the stages decided upon in the 
road map.  Yediot reported that former U.S. president 
Jimmy Carter will head a delegation of U.S. election 
monitors, and adds that the Foreign Ministry has 
learned that former U.S. president Bill Clinton has 
requested to join the delegation.  Jerusalem Post and 
Yediot quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz as saying 
Monday at the Herzliya Conference that Israel would 
pull its troops out of Palestinians cities before the 
January 9 elections for the Palestinian chairmanship -- 
for a period of 72 hours. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted a high-ranking GOI source as saying 
Monday that Sharon wants the cabinet to approve the 
changes to the route of the security fence as a \"single 
package,\" and that he is delaying approval of the 
already amended and completed plan for the Hebron Hills 
area until the completion of the plan to reroute the 
fence in the settlement bloc of Gush Etzion. 
 
Leading media reported that the Labor Party\'s 
representatives stormed out of coalition talks last 
night, citing its insistence on social measures and on 
the new coalition\'s parties committing themselves to 
supporting the disengagement plan.  The media also 
reported that coalition talks hit a snag Monday, after 
the party\'s spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, 
informed party chairman Eli Yishai that he sees no 
reason to rescind his ruling against the disengagement 
plan. 
 
All media reported that Hamas activist Mesbah Abu 
Hweileh survived a bombing Monday that destroyed his 
car on a Damascus street Monday.  The media reported 
that Hamas and the Syrian government immediately blamed 
Israel for the explosion.  Ha\'aretz reported that 
Israeli officials denied knowledge of the bombing, 
saying Syria \"always blames Israel\" for untoward events 
on its soil.  The media reported that three Israeli 
soldiers were wounded Monday in a Nablus firefight that 
killed a wanted man from Hamas.  Maariv cited a BBC 
interview with Hamas\'s political chief Khaled Mashal, 
in which he said that the U.S. and Europe are holding 
secret talks with Hamas even though they have declared 
 
SIPDIS 
it a terrorist organization. 
 
Leading media reported on an uproar, mostly by Israeli- 
Arab Knesset members, following Likud MK Yehiel Hazan\'s 
speech to the Knesset Monday, in which he referred to 
Arabs as \"worms who live underground and above the 
ground.\"  He was speaking about Sunday\'s attack near 
Rafah. 
 
Leading media reported that France\'s highest 
administrative court, the Council of State, moved 
decisively to ban Hizbullah\'s Al Manar-TV on Monday, 
ruling that the channel had repeatedly violated the 
country\'s hate laws and ignored its own pledge to avoid 
making anti-Semitic statements 
All media reported that Monday at the Herzliya 
Conference, IDF Spokesperson Ruth Yaron accused Ilana 
Dayan, the host of Channel 2-TV\'s \"Uvda\" (Fact) program 
of \"cooking\" a tape containing an IDF communication 
recorded during the alleged  \"confirmed killing\" of a 
13-year-old Gaza girl by an IDF officer.  Maariv cites 
an interview published two weeks ago by the IDF\'s 
official periodical Bamahaneh, in which an army 
commander describes how, in September, he shot and 
killed a terrorist who had thrown his weapon and 
surrendered. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that American citizen Brian Avery, an 
International Solidarity Movement (ISM) volunteer who 
was wounded in the face by gunfire in Jenin in April 
2003, has petitioned the High Court of Justice to 
demand that the police, and not the IDF, investigate 
his case. 
 
Leading media reported that Monday Israel and the EU 
signed the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) 
agreement. 
 
Maariv cited research conducted by an organization 
aiding new immigrants, according to which each 
immigrant from North America costs the Israeli economy 
USD 200,000.

popular, pluralist Maariv: \"Israel will try to reach an

not want to and/or cannot.... Sharon should continue

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
I.  \"From Terror Attack to Disengagement\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (December 14): \"Upon Arafat\'s 
death and with the establishment of Abu Mazen\'s regime, 
there will be somebody to talk to about disengagement. 
Israel will try to reach an agreement that will put 
government in the Gaza Strip in the hands of an 
authorized Palestinian body.  The U.S. and Egypt are 
already active to reach such an agreement. But we may 
be disappointed -- either because Abu Mazen does not 
want to and/or cannot.  Then Sharon will face a minor 
dilemma, of the kind Barak faced: freeze the situation 
as is and wait for a phone call from Ramallah; or 
improve Israel\'s position and situation by a unilateral 
move of disengagement, and only afterwards wait and 
expect some sort of Palestinian willingness to discuss 
the final peace arrangements.  Sharon should continue 
with disengagement, on the assumption that it is 
essentially unilateral.  That it is without a 
Palestinian partner.  With concern that Palestinian 
terror will continue, but that the IDF and the settlers 
will no longer be in the Gaza Strip.  Because leaving 
the Gaza Strip, even unilaterally, is not giving up 
assets and receiving nothing in return, rather it is 
removing an extra burden, even if terror continues.\" 
 
II.  \"Ominous Silence\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(December 14): \"Abbas is the leader of Fatah and its 
presumed candidate for president.  His refusal to 
condemn this attack [in Gaza Sunday], much less use the 
thousands of armed men under his control to crack down 
on supposedly illegal militias, means he is making a 
choice.  If he maintains it, it is a choice of 
fruitless bloodshed, a path that is likely to produce 
more Israeli casualties and many more Palestinian 
ones.... We are being assured, now, that all good 
things must wait for the Palestinian election, which 
will strengthen Abbas.... Let Abbas tell his people 
that the billions in assistance and a chance to build 
their own state will only come when the Palestinians 
prove they are abandoning terrorism and embracing 
democracy.  That this must be the path of Palestinian 
nationalism, not perpetual war with Israel.   But Abbas 
won\'t say that unless he knows it to be true. And it 
won\'t be true so long so Israel and the U.S., not to 
mention Europe, seem poised to shower him with 
unconditional support the minute he is anointed in an 
uncontested election.... In the meantime, holding Abbas 
to a higher standard does not weaken him.  It provides 
the only hope of steering him toward transforming his 
society into one intent on building its own state 
rather than destroying Israel.\" 
III.  \"Unity in Order to Prevent Disengagement\" 
 
Geneva Accord co-initiator and Yahad party leader Yossi 
Beilin wrote in Maariv (December 14): \"When, instead of 
Mofaz and Shalom, a Nobel Prize winner [Shimon Peres] 
explains [Sharon\'s] policy, it will be much easier for 
him to go back to his old habits.  He will have no 
reason to hurry.  He knows that in exchange for a few 
cabinet portfolios he will buy himself a loyal ally who 
will not threaten his authority.  He will also be able 
to go back to raising extreme proposals, knowing that 
Labor will veto them, thus quieting its conscience.... 
The Labor Party, which supports withdrawal from Gaza 
while it is in the opposition, will allow it to be 
carried out.  On the other hand, the Labor Party inside 
the government would \'understand\' Sharon if he should 
decide that the circumstances are not right for that, 
and will also explain to the world that the time is not 
yet ripe for it.  The members of the Labor Central 
Committee, who will convene in order to approve a 
coalition agreement, still have an opportunity to 
prevent the mistake to which its leaders are leading 
them a second time.\"

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted British diplomatic officials as 
saying that PM Sharon has \"softened\" his opposition to 
a British-sponsored international conference on the 
Middle East after hearing more about the proposed 
British agenda.  The newspaper quoted one British 
official as saying that Nigel Sheinwald, British PM 
Tony Blair\'s primary foreign policy adviser, made clear 
to Sharon during a two-day visit that ended Tuesday 
that the British have no intention of using the planned 
conference to leapfrog over phase one of the road map. 
 
All media quoted PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) 
as saying in an interview published Tuesday in the 
London-based newspaper Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat that the use 
of weapons in the second Intifada was a mistake and 
that it should end (banner in Ha\'aretz).   Israel Radio 
quoted White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan as 
saying Tuesday that the U.S. welcomes \"steps aimed at 
fighting terrorism.\" 
 
Israel TV and Israel Radio quoted Israeli diplomats as 
saying that the work of the Israeli Embassy in 
Washington -- at echelons lower that the top level -- 
has been affected by the FBI investigation of the pro- 
Israel lobby AIPAC on suspicion that it transferred 
secret information about Iran to Israel. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
All media reported on the signing of the U.S.-brokered 
Israeli-Egyptian free trade agreement in Cairo on 
Tuesday.  Ha\'aretz cited a statement issued by FM 
Shalom as saying that the agreement will increase trade 
and that Israel \"hopes the movement of goods and 
entrepreneurs will lead to warmer relations will lead 
to warmer relations between the peoples, giving 
expression to the fruits of peace.\"  Jerusalem Post 
reported that USTR Robert Zoellick called the accord, 
which requires ratification by the U.S. Congress, the 
\"most important agreement between Israel and Egypt in 
20 years,\" and quoted him as saying it sent a strong 
signal across the entire Middle East.  Yediot quoted 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as saying, at a 
meeting with Trade, Industry and Employment Minister 
Ehud Olmert, that Sharon is a \"reliable person\" and a 
\"strong man.\" 
 
Yediot reported that fearing the digging of further 
explosive tunnels in the Gaza Strip, the IDF\'s Southern 
Command is bracing for the evacuation of some outposts 
before the withdrawal that is supposed to take place 
next summer. 
 
All media reported that a female Thai agricultural 
worker was killed Tuesday in a mortar attack in the 
greenhouses of the Gaza Strip settlement of Ganei Tal. 
Israel Radio reported that Thailand\'s Employment 
Minister will arrive in Israel on Thursday to try to 
convince Thais employed in Israel to come back home. 
Israel Radio reported that this morning a Qassam rocket 
was fired at the settlement, and that afterwards heavy 
exchanges of fire took place in the area. 
 
Saying that the Labor Party insists on getting key 
ministerial portfolios in the next government, the 
media continued to cover the continued stalemate in 
Likud-Labor coalition negotiations, and Likud\'s talks 
with the ultra-Orthodox parties. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited the state\'s response to a High Court 
petition by residents of Nirit, a community inside the 
Green Line, which asks the court to rule that a suburb 
of the settlement of Alfei Menashe, across the Green 
Line from Nirit yet due to share Nirit\'s 
infrastructure, is illegal, and to rule a halt to the 
construction.  The state responded Tuesday that the 
government decision adopting the road map that 
obligates Israel \"to freeze all settlement activity, 
including natural growth,\" has no operative legal 
standing. 
 
Israel Radio cited the London-based newspaper Al-Quds 
Al-Arabi as saying that current PLO representative at 
the UN Nasser al-Qidwa could replace Nabil Shaath as 
foreign minister of the PA, among other changes in the 
PA cabinet\'s\' make-up. 
 
Ha\'aretz says that Sharon is expected to tell the 
Herzliya Conference Thursday that his disengagement 
plan will present the Palestinians with an opportunity 
to take responsibility for their own fate, and that it 
could become the basis for a expansive diplomatic 
process in the Middle East.  Leading media reported 
that Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told the 
conference Tuesday that there will be no peace without 
democratization of the PA. 
 
Israel Radio quoted Foreign Ministry D-G Ron Prosor as 
saying today at the Herzliya Conference that Israel 
should seriously consider Syria\'s negotiating 
proposals. 
 
Leading media reported that Tuesday Defense Minister 
Shaul Mofaz ordered the closure of the Rafah border 
crossing until further notice, following Sunday\'s 
attack on an IDF outpost there. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited denials by Cristina Gallach, 
spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief policy chief 
Javier Solana, and by State Department Spokesman 
Richard Boucher, of claims made by Hamas\'s political 
leader Khaled Mashal on Monday that his organization 
has held contacts with the EU and U.S.  Jerusalem Post 
reported that fearing an Israeli reprisal attack, Hamas 
has decided to cancel a major rally marking the 17th 
anniversary of its founding, which was supposed to be 
held in one of Gaza City\'s stadiums on Friday. 
Ha\'aretz quoted Fathi Hamad, a member of the Sura 
Council, the supreme Hamas religious body in Gaza 
responsible for the organization\'s communications 
system in Gaza, as saying two months ago that a growing 
rift between Hamas and Islamic Jihad has led to a break 
in cooperation between the two groups, and that it is 
threatening to lead to an all-out clash between them. 
Ha\'aretz says that Hamad had been speaking to a group 
of the organization\'s Communications Councils, whose 
job is to promote Hamas in the Palestinian, Arab and 
international press. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that the Foreign Ministry is 
putting together a new diplomatic initiative aimed at 
finding a permanent solution to the issue of the 
Palestinian refugees in the territories and in 
neighboring countries.  Israel reportedly intends to 
ask countries that financially support the PA to invest 
capital in finding permanent housing solutions for 
Palestinians living in the refugee camps in the Gaza 
Strip, West Bank, Syria, and Lebanon 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that the Association of Civil 
Rights in Israel and the Jerusalem Center for Human 
Rights asked the High Court of Justice on Tuesday to 
stop the army from beginning construction of the 
security fence near three Palestinian villages, even 
though it has already changed its original route for 
the benefit of the villagers.  The petition dealt with 
the section of the fence around Dir Balut and Rafat, 
east of Rosh Ha\'ayin.  The Internet news service 
NanaNews reported that seven left wing activists, 
including four Israelis and three foreign nationals, 
were arrested on Tuesday morning during a demonstration 
against the separation fence in the village of Bilain, 
near Modiin.  The seven were arrested after the IDF 
declared the area a closed military zone. 
 
Ha\'aretz, Yediot and Jerusalem Post reported that 
Tuesday the Knesset\'s Finance Committee approved the 
transfer of 2 million shekels (around USD 460,000) in 
state funds for developing tourism in the territories, 
as part of a planned transfer of 4 million shekels for 
tourism projects in the territories.  The projects 
include the building of a new entranceway to the Gush 
Katif settlement bloc, which is slated for evacuation 
within a year. 
 
All media reported that the police might have found

                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Confident Abbas Can Afford to Be Anti-Weapons\" 
 
Arab affairs commentator Danny Rubinstein wrote in left- 
leaning, independent Ha\'aretz (December 15): \"Mahmoud 
Abbas is a confident man, certain of a landslide 
victory on January 9 in the Palestinian Authority\'s 
presidential elections.  That is the conclusion that 
can be drawn from the clear statement he made in his 
interview with Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat against the use of 
weapons in the Intifada.  Abbas\'s position was long 
known, and one that was repeated.  But this is the 
first time he has said so publicly after the death of 
Yasser Arafat.  Abbas\'s stand against what he calls the 
\'military Intifada\' caused him much damage in the past, 
as Palestinian public opinion largely supported attacks 
against Israel and condemned Abbas.  Lately, however, 
there appears to be a change in public opinion in both 
the West Bank and Gaza, and Abbas can now make such a 
statement without causing an uproar or provoking public 
opposition.  His confidence in his victory is the 
result of several elements, including Marwan 
Barghouti\'s dropping out of the race, which resulted in 
complete unity in Fatah behind Abbas.... Abbas also 
feels good about his ability to reach an agreement with 
Hamas.... Abbas also feels good about his ability to 
reach an agreement with Hamas.\" 
 
II.  \"The World Actually Supports Israel\" 
 
Foreign News Editor Arik Bachar wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (December 15): \"Without much fanfare, 
the connection between Israel and the NATO alliance -- 
the strongest military body since the Roman Empire -- 
is tightening.  During 2005, we\'ll most certainly see 
IDF troops take part in one of the central arenas of 
the battle against international terrorism.... [Also,] 
the tightening of ties between Israel and very powerful 
regional bodies, such as the EU and NATO, raises a 
range of possibilities.  At this time the West is not 
interested in weakening Israel, but actually in 
strengthening her.... It is clear that the destruction 
of Israel\'s power would encourage fundamentalist 
terrorism, which has long turned from Israel\'s private 
problem into the key threat to international 
stability.\" 
 
III.  \"Refugees Now\" 
 
Nationalist writer Emuna Elon opined in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (December 15): 
\"More and more Israelis are finally beginning to 
understand that the refugee camps will not disappear of 
their own accord, the aspiration of the camp residents 
to return to their lands inside Israel will not 
dissipate over time, and the terror issuing from the 
camps will not stop as long as the aspiration to return 
is alive and kicking.  Still, only few people place the 
issue of Palestinian refugees in its proper place, high 
on the national agenda.  Therefore, Foreign Minister 
Silvan Shalom should be praised for the courageous 
speech he intends to give today on this topic at the 
Herzliya Conference.... What is important now is to 
take advantage of Arafat\'s passing in order to offer a 
concrete solution to the refugee problem.  It is 
important to mobilize the international community to 
invest billions in rehabilitating the refugees, it is 
imperative to require Syria and Lebanon to absorb the 
residents of the camps in their territory, and it is 
vital to ask other countries in the world to also take 
in Palestinian refugees to the best of their ability, 
since only a small portion of them can be settled in 
Judea, Samaria and Gaza [i.e. the territories]. 
Minister Shalom is supposed to speak today about all of 
this, and he must not be deterred by those who allege 
that his plan is \'not logical\': it is much less logical 
to ignore the refugee camps as Israel has done up until 
now, or to refuse to rehabilitate them on the grounds 
that their rehabilitation would constitute a 
\'transfer.\'\"

SUBJECT: LIKUD-LABOR TALKS STALLED AS BOTH PLAY HARDBALL 
OVER CABINET SEATS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) The current snag in Likud-Labor coalition 
negotiations over which cabinet seats Labor would receive is 
likely the result of poker game tactics by both sides. 
Embassy contacts do not expect the snag to prevent a 
Likud-Labor agreement.  Referring to the breakdown in 
Likud-Labor talks as a \"political game,\" a Labor Party 
spokesperson, Dana Zaidman, told poloff December 15, that 
while the two sides have stopped talking, \"it is obvious\" 
that Labor and Likud will eventually find a compromise, \"most 
likely early next week.\"  Labor\'s lower-profile budget 
demands, including assistance for the elderly, will also be a 
part of any agreement.  Likud MK Yuval Steinitz\'s Chief of 
Staff, David Sharan, also assured poloff December 15 that 
Likud and Labor would \"work something out,\" pointing out that 
coalition negotiations \"are always like this.\"  Or Pearl, 
advisor to Likud MK Ehud Yatom, echoed this view and noted 
that negotiations may take a week longer than expected. 
Pearl reasoned that Labor cannot be seen as \"crawling to the 
coalition,\" hence it is finding something to fight about. 
Pearl also stressed that an agreement will be reached because 
\"no one wants elections.\" 
 
2.  (C) Likud reluctantly agreed December 15 to offer Labor 
the Interior Ministry -- provoking angry reactions from Likud 
MKs -- but Labor is also demanding Education, Transportation, 
and Public Security.  Labor aide Zaidman expressed skepticism 
that Labor would enter the coalition without portfolios. 
Labor MKs Chaim Ramon and Ofir Pines-Paz threatened that 
Labor, if not offered its preferred portfolios, may insist on 
joining the coalition without designated portfolios and 
remain partners only long enough to ensure that 
disengagement is implemented.  Likud staffer Sharan predicted 
that Labor would eventually settle for the Interior Ministry 
and several other portfolios, which he did not name. 
 
3.  (C) While talks with Labor have stalled, Likud continues 
to negotiate with United Torah Judaism (UTJ) and Shas over 
their demands for joining the government.  UTJ appears the 
closest of all the parties to wrapping up a coalition deal 
with Likud.  A Likud negotiating team member claimed to the 
press that UTJ would likely receive chairmanship of the 
powerful Knesset Finance Committee if it agrees to join and 
may also receive a deputy ministerial position in charge of 
religious affairs, a seat that currently rests in the Prime 
Minister\'s office.  UTJ may also demand the position of 
deputy minister in the Housing Ministry.  An agreement 
between Likud and UTJ could be reached this week.

DISENGAGEMENT 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  GOI coordinator for separation barrier issues 
BG (res) Baruch Spiegel (protect) spoke to POL/C December 14 
about the apparent lack of GOI preparations to handle 
international election monitors, his team\'s efforts to 
document outpost and settlement activity, the apparent new 
responsiveness within the bureaucracy and IDF to PM Sharon\'s 
initiatives on disengagement and on easing restrictions on 
Palestinians, and the land dispute in Jayyus.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
ELECTIONS MONITORING 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C) GOI coordinator for the separation barrier and 
outpost/settlement issues BG (res) Baruch Spiegel (protect) 
told POL/C December 14 that he has been urging GOI officials 
to establish immediately a coordinated, centralized mechanism 
to assist international observers coming to the Palestinian 
areas for the January 9 Palestinian Authority presidential 
election.  Spiegel said that while the issue is outside his 
current purview, his experience as Israel\'s elections 
coordinator in 1996 demonstrates that handling several 
hundred international monitors is a massive undertaking 
requiring the collaboration of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, IDF, MOD and many other agencies.  Issues of 
security, travel, checkpoints, communications and logistics 
require thorough planning, he said, and if \"two presidents\" 
show up, the task will be huge. 
 
3.  (C) Spiegel said that for the 1996 elections, the GOI 
established a central headquarters to coordinate activities 
by both Israeli and non-governmental players.  The GOI issued 
special rose-colored documents for observers, trained Israeli 
civilians and IDF personnel, provided briefings on 
checkpoints and Israeli procedures, set up specialized 
communications to ensure rapid contact and dissemination of 
information, and engaged in major contingency planning. 
Imagine, he said, what would happen now if Hamas kidnapped an 
election observer in Khan Yunis.  With only three-plus weeks 
until the elections, he added, no such entity has yet been 
established, and these elections are \"more complex\" than the 
1996 process.  Spiegel said he had suggested that Amir 
Maimon, whom he said is the MFA coordinator for foreign 
observers, quickly talk to all those who handled the 1996 
elections and review the voluminous files.  Spiegel suggested 
that in light of a probable American contingent participating 
in the election monitoring, the Embassy should initiate 
contacts as soon as possible with Maimon, followed by talks 
with MOD official Amos Gilad and COGAT chief MG Mishlev in 
order to avoid problems. 
 
4.  (C) Note: NDI resident representative Shannon O\'Connell 
told AIDoff December 15 that MFA officials held an initial 
meeting last week with observer representatives and will hold 
another late December 15.  The first meeting included 
personnel from NDI, the European observation team, and UNDP, 
which is coordinating international observer efforts for the 
Palestinian Central Elections Commission.  The GOI team was 
led by MFA director for Palestinian affairs Oded Ben Haim and 
included personnel from the MFA legal counsel\'s office and 
the emergency operations directorate.  O\'Connell said the GOI 
is mandating a laborious credentialing process that O\'Connell 
termed burdensome but not insurmountable, and plans to issue 
accreditation documents for observers at ports of entry.  The 
GOI will issue special stickers and permits for observer 
vehicles, but local staff will all need to go through the 
current process to secure travel permits.  GOI officials 
reportedly told the observer reps that the safety of Israelis 
would come first in all cases, and made no commitments to 
freedom of movement for observers.  A planned meeting this 
week between PA Minister Saeb Erakat and PM advisor Dov 
Weissglas to discuss elections was postponed as a result of 
the Rafah bombing.  END NOTE. 
 
------------------------ 
OUTPOSTS AND SETTLEMENTS 
------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) Spiegel said his team is pressing ahead on efforts to 
update and compile information on outposts and settlements, 
and is generating a \"one-button\" database from which they can 
call up comprehensive data on every site.  He acknowledged 
that, since much of the data has not been updated since 1967, 
the task is large and likely to require several more months 
to complete.  He added, however, that the database will be 
useful even before completion, and that legal advisor Talia 
Sasson is making significant progress on the full range of 
legal issues surrounding outposts and settlements.  Asked 
about outpost numbers and removals, Spiegel said that the USG 
and the GOI differ in their definitions of outposts, then 
acknowledged offering without specifics that while several 
uninhabited outposts have been dismantled, little has been 
done to any inhabited outposts. 
------------------------------------- 
DISENGAGEMENT, CHECKPOINTS AND ATTACKS 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Spiegel voiced confidence that the bureaucracy is 
getting on board to implement PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan 
and relaxation of restrictions on Palestinians.  He asserted 
that COS Lt. Gen. Moshe Ya\'alon has issued clear orders all 
the way down through the ranks and has ensured that all the 
commanders are personally involved in the process.  That 
clarity of orders has improved the bureaucracy\'s response to 
his own taskings, Spiegel said, noting that he was at the 
moment awaiting the imminent arrival of a comprehensive list 
of West Bank checkpoints from which to identify points for 
possible relaxations.  Other personnel are working on 
measures to, for instance, ease access to Bethlehem for 
Christmas, he said.  Spiegel voiced real concern, however, 
that new Palestinian attacks, such as the recent Rafah 
checkpoint bombing, are apt to cripple the efforts to ease 
restrictions on Palestinians.  He expressed dismay that 
militant factions are targeting Gaza crossing points that are 
so critical to Palestinian well-being. 
 
------------------ 
SEPARATION BARRIER 
------------------ 
 
7.  (C) Referring to a wall map of the West Bank, Spiegel 
said that he had sent to PM Sharon three options for 
re-routing the separation barrier to ease the hardship on 
Palestinians in compliance with the High Court\'s decision. 
He hoped for a decision on the final route soon, but noted 
that the Prime Minister is heavily engaged in coalition 
negotiations right now.  He added that, with the completion 
of the barrier and the crossing points, the IDF will be able 
to remove several major checkpoints throughout the northern 
part of the northern West Bank, leaving a full contiguous 
area that he claimed will be bigger than the Gaza Strip. 
 
------------------- 
JAYYUS LAND DISPUTE 
------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Spiegel told POL/C that he currently had a team in 
the field to investigate the land and access dispute 
surrounding Israeli land clearance and construction 
activities on land claimed by Palestinians west of the 
separation barrier at Jayyus.  Spiegel said that so-far 
incomplete reports from the team indicate that the dispute 
involves the implications for Palestinian landowners of 
Israeli construction on a plot of land west of the barrier 
that allegedly had been purchased from a separate 
Palestinian.  Among perhaps other issues, the Israeli 
construction would apparently block remaining Palestinian 
landowners in that area from accessing their plots west of 
the separation barrier.  Spiegel said he had ordered a halt 
to all clearance and construction activities until resolution 
of all the issues, and that the case is now to go before the 
High Court (apparently at the request of the Palestinian 
landowners). 
 
--------------------- 
EU ELECTION OBSERVERS 
--------------------- 
 
9.  (C) In a separate meeting December 13, Jan Thesleff, an 
aide to EU Envoy Marc Otte, told POL/C that he anticipated a 
combined \"European\" observer delegation, headquartered in 
Ramallah, consisting of the groups noted below.  Thesleff 
said the European contribution to the Presidential elections 
process would be 4.8 million Euros. 
 
-- 32 \"long-term\" observers who would deploy to the region 
around December 14, with two personnel covering each of the 
PA\'s election districts. 
 
-- 120 short-term observers who would arrive around January 4. 
 
-- 30 to 40 European parliamentarians. 
 
-- 20 Canadians. 
 
-- 20 Swiss. 
 
-- 15 to 20 Norwegians. 
 
-- plus an unspecified number of logistical, media, security 
and other support staff. 
 
Thesleff said he also anticipated a 100-person observer group 
from the United States that would include personnel from NDI 
and the Carter Center, including former President Carter.

SUBJECT: THE LOW-DOWN ON DISENGAGEMENT LEGISLATION 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor William Weinstein for reasons 1.5 (b) 
 and (d) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  Embassy economic officer on December 9 met 
with Dr.  Shavit Matias and Malkiel \"Mike\" Blass, Deputy 
Attorneys General at the Ministry of Justice, to discuss the 
details of the evacuation legislation.  While there have been 
complaints from settlers and MKs that the compensation 
amounts are too low, the MOJ lawyers stressed that the GOI is 
trying to be generous and fair, and that it understands the 
potential trauma evacuation may have on the settlers.  To 
this end, the MOJ has devised a compensation package, with 
about 100 academics and businessmen, that includes 
compensation for homes, land, lost income, various grants, 
and also includes monetary help for businesses that will have 
to be closed down with disengagement.  End summary. 
 
------------------ 
We Want to be Fair 
------------------ 
 
2.  (C)  Dr.  Shavit Matias, Deputy Attorney General at the 
Ministry of Justice (MOJ), explained to econoff on December 9 
that with respect to compensation for evacuating settlements, 
\"the idea was to be generous\" but not extravagant.  While the 
MOJ thinks it is giving the settlers a good deal, it will not 
object if the GOI ultimately decides to compensate the 
settlers with more money.  In order to come up with the 
compensation figures, the MOJ led a team of about 100 
government officials, businessmen and academics to work out 
the package.  According to Matias, settlers were invited to 
the negotiations but they did not want to come, although she 
acknowledged that some sent lawyers in their place.  Matias 
stated that if Labor and Shas join the government coalition, 
the settlers will realize disengagement will be a reality and 
they will eventually get more involved in the process and 
actively lobby the Knesset for what they want. 
 
------------------ 
Killer Bureaucracy 
------------------ 
 
3.  (C)  Malkiel \"Mike\" Blass, Deputy Attorney General at the 
MOJ, told econoff that the legislation for the disengagement 
plan for now consists of 150 provisions, and the Knesset is 
negotiating hard time on everything down to the last comma. 
So far the MOJ has had at least four meetings with the 
Knesset Law Committee and one meeting with the Knesset 
Finance Committee to explain the provisions of the law, and 
Blass expects that there will be many more meetings in the 
future.  Blass related that one of the biggest challenges of 
disengagement would be to keep the bureaucracy from killing 
the process, but he explained that it was important to 
undertake disengagement in a democratic manner regardless 
because Knesset approval is the only way for the plan to gain 
legitimacy in the eyes of Israelis. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
The Disengagement Authority\'s Responsibilities 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4.  (C)  In a presentation to econoff of the actual 
legislation, Blass explained that the purpose of the law was 
\"regulating all matter of implementation of the disengagement 
plan, evacuation of Israelis and their properties, and giving 
fair and just compensation from the State to those entitled.\" 
 The law gives the GOI the authority to establish the 
Disengagement Authority -- SELA headed by Yonatan Bassi -- 
and states that the main job of this entity will be to decide 
who is entitled to compensation and to decide on places for 
relocation, whether they be agricultural plots in kibbutzim 
or moshavim, or whether whole communities move together. 
 
5.  (C)  Blass opined that the option of moving entire 
communities together was the best for psychological and 
social reasons since people would be moving with their 
families, friends and neighbors, but also the most 
complicated because the residents all have to agree amongst 
themselves whether this is what they want and because it 
usually takes three years to establish a new community from 
the ground up.  As a result, the GOI is looking at small 
existing communities within Green Line Israel that already 
have the required zoning permits and infrastructure so that 
settlers can relocate to their new homes as quickly as 
possible. 
 
6.  (C)  Blass said that in order to determine who is 
entitled to compensation, the GOI will establish an 
Entitlement Committee with a judge appointed by the MOJ to 
serve as chairman, either Bassi or his deputy from SELA, and 
an accountant from SELA.  They will study the cases and 
conduct negotiations with approximately 1500 families and 
hundreds of businesses affected, and they will have the 
authority to verify documents and sign contracts relating to 
compensation on behalf of the GOI. 
 
7.  (C)  Blass explained that settlers will have up to three 
years to claim their compensation with very clear evidence 
for their requests, but said that the GOI hopes settlers will 
submit their claims before the evacuations.  In response to 
econoff\'s question, Blass said the GOI expected many 
ideological settlers to hold out \"on principle\" and related 
the story of a settler who left Yamit in 1982 but did not 
claim his compensation for another 15 years.  Blass said SELA 
will give its decision in writing, and that settlers will be 
able to appeal in Magistrate Courts exclusively in Jerusalem 
because the GOI wants judges to build up expertise on 
disengagement. 
 
----------------------- 
Evacuation is the Heart 
----------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  While compensation provisions account for 90 percent 
of the legislation, Blass said the evacuation provisions were 
naturally the heart of the matter.  He explained that the law 
gives the GOI the authority to evacuate the settlers, but at 
the end of the day Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will decide 
which group goes on which day.  In response to econoff\'s 
question, Blass replied that there was nothing written down 
about giving the settlers a warning of their evacuation date, 
but the MOJ is negotiating this point with the Knesset. 
 
9.  (C)  Blass also said the PM, the Ministry of Defense and 
the Ministry of Internal Security will all agree on a date 
before evacuation on which entry into the settlements will be 
limited.  The rationale behind this is that the GOI does not 
want sympathizers to go into the areas beforehand and cause a 
\"big balagan.\"  Blass explained that between this day and the 
day of actual evacuation, visitors will need permits to enter 
the settlements but he acknowledged that working out a 
description of what constitutes a visitor versus a 
sympathizer will be difficult.  He concluded that the more 
violent settlers and their visitors become, the more 
restrictive the GOI will be. 
 
10.  (C)  According to Blass, on the day of evacuation the 
settlers\' right to the land will be canceled and they will 
return the property to the authorities when they leave.  They 
should be prepared to move all fo their possessions ahead of 
time because any furniture left behind will become the 
property of the GOI.  In addition, the security forces will 
have the authority to evacuate those who remain illegally 
with \"reasonable force\" and the MOJ has suggested creating a 
category of \"special offenses\" that would be different from 
criminal offenses for anyone who tries to stay, although it 
is negotiating this point with the Knesset, as well. 
 
------------------------------------ 
The Complicated Compensation Package 
------------------------------------ 
 
11.  (C)  Blass explained that the calculation of 
compensation packages will be very complicated but basically 
settlers will be compensated for the house and land, for loss 
of income, and for the loss of a business.  In response to 
econoff\'s question, Blass replied that even if settlers are 
leasing the land but do not own it, they will still receive 
compensation (Note:  in many cases, settlers have 49- or 
50-year leases with the GOI but they do not technically have 
a title to the land, even if they may own the house on it. 
End note).  Blass said that since these settlers had an 
expectation that they would be able to live on this property 
for 49 years, they should \"get something.\" 
 
12.  (C)  To compensate for the house and land, the MOJ has 
broken down the package into three options.  Option A is for 
settlers who have lived in the houses for a short time, 
perhaps two years, or for settlers who own the property but 
do not live in it and rent it out instead.  In this case, the 
compensation breaks down as follows: 
 
--Self-built house:  $900/square meter 
--Government-built house:  $750/square meter 
--Pre-fabricated house:  $600/square meter 
 
This is further broken down by the actual size of the house: 
 
--160 or less meters:  100 percent of the value 
--161-200 meters:  90 percent of the value 
--200  meters:  80 percent of the value 
 
According to Blass, the thought behind giving less money to 
settlers with the biggest houses is that the concept of 
economies-of-scale means it actually costs less to build a 
house the bigger it is. 
 
13.  (C)  Option B is for settlers who have lived in their 
homes longer than two years and therefore have \"stronger 
rights\" to the property.  In these cases, the settlers will 
receive compensation for the house as well as NIS225,000 for 
the land if they live in community settlements or NIS360,000 
if they live in agricultural settlements.  Settlers will 
receive a percentage of the value based on how long they have 
lived in the settlement up to eight years, at which point 
they will receive 100 percent of the value.  Blass stated, 
however, that settlers will only be compensated for one house 
even if they own more than one. 
 
14.  (C)  Blass related that Option C is for settlers who 
have short-term rental contracts with the GOI in public 
housing, and that this will apply to approximately 100 
families in Neveh Dekalim and the northern West Bank 
settlements.  If settlers have lived in public housing for 
more than eight years, they will receive NIS160,000 and will 
be entitled to public housing in Israel but not to land. 
Blass said the Knesset will likely increase this amount in 
the end. 
 
15.  (C)  Blass acknowledged that the MOJ has received 
complaints that the compensation is too low, but in a 
presentation to the Knesset, Minister Meir Sheetrit said that 
if the MKs want to increase the packages, they will have to 
decide where cuts will be made in the rest of the budget 
because this money is coming out of the GOI\'s pockets. 
According to Blass, some MKs asked Sheetrit why the GOI did 
not ask \"our friends\" the Americans for help, but Sheetrit 
allegedly responded that for now the NIS2.5-3 billion for 
compensation and NIS2 billion for security is coming from 
Israeli funds.  Blass also said the GOI was changing the law 
to increase the budget deficit to finance evacuation. 
 
----------------------- 
Throwing in Some Grants 
----------------------- 
 
16.  (C)  Blass explained that in addition to compensation 
for the house and land, settlers who live in their homes -- 
versus renting the homes out to others -- will also receive 
grants from the GOI.  One of these grants is a moving grant 
which Blass claimed is \"more than generous\" for one move, 
although it may fall a little short if a second move is 
needed.  For a family of three, the grant is NIS9,000; for a 
family of four or five, the grant is NIS13,500; and for six 
or more, the grant is NIS18,000.  Settlers who cannot move 
directly to their new homes will also get six months worth of 
rent without having to a show a contract.  For a family of 
three, the grant is NIS10,800; for a family of four or five, 
the grant is NIS12,150; and for six or more, the grant is 
NIS13,500.  If these settlers need to rent for longer than 
six months, they can receive an additional six months by 
showing a contract. 
 
17.  (C)  Blass also said there was another grant for \"just 
living the area.\"  He described it as money anyone 21 years 
or older who has lived in a settlement at least five years 
will receive as the GOI\'s way of recognizing the trauma that 
evacuation may cause.  The grant will be NIS2,400 per year 
that the settler lived in a settlement.  In addition, 
according to Blass, the PM personally added a $30,000 loan to 
settle in the Negev or the Galilee that will become a grant 
after five years if the settler stays in the area.  The last 
incentive for settlers is that if they buy an apartment in 
Israel within four years of evacuation, they will receive a 
refund on the purchase tax, which he said is approximately 
$10,000 for a $300,000 apartment. 
 
------------------ 
Income Supplements 
------------------ 
 
18.  (C)  Blass explained that workers must live and work in 
a settlement to receive compensation for lost income, or an 
\"adjustment payment.\"  Settlers who live in a settlement but 
work within the Green Line will not receive income 
supplements nor will Israelis who live within the Green Line 
but work in a settlement.  According to Blass, the adjustment 
payment for individuals who live and work in a settlement 
will be six months worth of their average annual salary for 
the year before evacuation.  In addition, if they are paying 
into a pension fund, the GOI will pay into the fund for them 
for those six months. 
 
19.  (C)  If the settler is 57 years of age or older, has 
lived in a settlement at least four years, and has worked in 
the settlement at least three years, s/he will also be 
entitled to a \"retirement payment\" which is 60 percent of the 
adjustment payment but not more than 70 percent of the 
average salary in Israel, or a maximum of NIS5,000 per month. 
 The expectation is that anyone 57 or older may not be able 
to find a job in Israel so settlers will receive this payment 
until they are 67 at which point regular pension and social 
security payments will kick in.  Blass was unsure, however, 
if this payment would take place if the settler could find a 
job despite his or her age. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Businesses and Public Institutions Get Help, Too 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
20.  (C)  Blass said a special team was created to determine 
how to compensate businesses and there will be two options 
for this.  The first option will be based on the value of the 
assets of the business, such as computers, equipment, and 
supplies, and the second option will be based on the 
companies\' money flow, or \"revenue minus costs.\"  Another 
special committee wrote the guidelines for how to compensate 
infrastructure companies such as telephone, electricity and 
water, as well. 
 
21.  (C)  Blass explained that the GOI will also have 
non-profit organizations to deal with, such as institutions 
that build swimming pools, synagogues or community centers. 
These organizations have funds that they collect from their 
members, but they will have to be liquidated.  The Gaza Strip 
municipality, from its debts to its workers, will also have 
to be liquidated, although the municipality in the northern 
West Bank will not since only four settlements there will be 
evacuated. 
 
22.  (C)  In addition, Blass stated that the GOI will have to 
work with private banks who have liens on the settlers\' 
houses or businesses.  The government wants to avoid a 
situation in which it compensates a settler for a house he 
has not paid off and then the  settler takes the money 
without paying back the bank because then the GOI will have 
to pay twice.  According to Blass, the GOI will publicize 
when a settler will receive compensation so that the banks 
will have advanced notice and can collect. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
23.  (C)  It seems the MOJ has tried to cover every angle 
when determining how to compensate the settlers that will be 
evacuated, and Blass concluded the meeting by stating that 
the legislation also includes provisions to establish a 
Special Committee for cases the MOJ may not have considered 
because it could not \"think of everything.\"  Despite MOJ\'s 
attempts to be generous and fair, however, the legislation 
faces an uphill battle in the Knesset and Blass\'s comments 
that the bureaucracy could kill the process should not be 
taken lightly.  End comment.

SUBJECT: FM SHALOM QUESTIONS ABU MAZEN\'S DETERMINATION IN 
MEETING WITH CODEL HAGEL/BIDEN 
 
Classified By: DCM Gene A. Cretz for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: While expressing optimism about the 
opportunities presented by the PA transition, FM Shalom, in a 
December 1 meeting with Codel Hagel/Biden, questioned Abu 
Mazen\'s commitment to dismantling terrorist infrastructure, 
to stopping incitement and to stepping away from Arafat\'s 
legacy.  In response to comments by Senators Biden and 
Feinstein about limitations on Abu Mazen\'s capabilities to 
exercise security control, Shalom insisted that having the PA 
security forces on the PA payroll gives Abu Mazen the levers 
he needs to deliver on security.  He expressed concern that a 
terrorist attack could destroy the opportunities of the 
moment if Abu Mazen is not seen at the time to be making 
maximum efforts to combat terror.  He urged the Codel to help 
convince moderate Arab states to reopen embassies in Israel 
and/or to return their ambassadors.  On other regional 
issues, Shalom said Israel does not oppose diplomatic efforts 
to block Iran\'s nuclear aspirations, but that other tools 
exist.  He called Assad\'s peace overtures encouraging but 
meaningless as long as Assad continues to allow terror groups 
to operate against Israel from Syria.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Dealing with the New PA Leadership 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a December 1 meeting with Senators Chuck Hagel, 
Joseph Biden, Dianne Feinstein, and Lincoln Chafee (Codel 
Hagel/Biden), Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said the GOI 
wants to seize the opportunities of the post-Arafat 
transition.  The GOI, he said, will do all it can to 
facilitate the PA elections, but will defer other 
coordination until after the elections.  Charge, Senate staff 
and military escorts from the Codel, and poloff also attended. 
 
3. (C) In other comments about dealing with the new PA 
leadership, Shalom said that: 
 
-- Incitement remains a problem.  The head of the Palestinian 
broadcasting authority had just stated publicly that he had 
no instructions to change the content of broadcasts.  Abu 
Mazen could \"easily\" deal with incitement \"in one day\" by 
issuing orders against incitement in broadcasting and 
textbooks.  Shalom said he was optimistic, however, that the 
Israeli-Palestinian committee on incitement created when Abu 
Mazen was prime minister would soon resume its work. 
 
-- The GOI wants to coordinate with the PA on security 
issues.  Neither side wants Palestinian extremists to take 
over. 
 
-- Disengagement must not be seen as a shortcut to final 
status talks.  Fulfilling each stage of the roadmap is 
essential to building confidence. 
 
-- The GOI will coordinate with Egypt on stopping smuggling 
into Gaza, and favors the expansion of QIZs in Egypt. 
 
-- Once the GOI and PA resume negotiations, Arab countries 
that reduced the level of their diplomatic contacts with 
Israel should reopen their embassies and/or return their 
ambassadors.  He urged the Codel to use its stop in Jordan to 
ask King Abdallah to return Jordan\'s ambassador to Israel. 
 
-- The first Palestinian terrorist attack against an Israeli 
target could be a \"catastrophe\" for the peace process if the 
PA has not already begun doing all it can to dismantle 
terrorist infrastructure.  Israel \"would have to react\" and 
the situation would regress to what it was before Arafat\'s 
death. 
 
4. (C) Sen. Biden told Shalom that members of the Codel, in 
their meeting with Abu Mazen the previous day, had emphasized 
the overarching need for Abu Mazen to deal with security 
issues.  In response, Abu Mazen, according to Biden, said he 
would take clear steps on security after the PA elections, 
but stressed that he needs help because he does not control 
all of the PA security organizations.  Biden asked whether 
the GOI and PA were trying to  reach common assessments of 
Abu Mazen\'s security capabilities. 
 
5. (C) Shalom insisted in his reply that Abu Mazen has the 
capabilities required to deal effectively with the terrorist 
groups.  He questioned, however, whether Abu Mazen has the 
will.  Shalom asserted that Abu Mazen controls a security 
force of 62,000 men, all of whom are on the PA payroll.  He 
insisted that paying all the security force salaries gives 
Abu Mazen all necessary control. 
 
6. (C) Sen. Feinstein told Shalom that Abu Mazen had 
impressed her.  She said she found him committed to reform, 
aware of the need to stop incitement, and a leader with 
vision.  She asked what the U.S. could do to help Abu Mazen 
succeed.  Shalom replied that Abu Mazen has the tools he 
needs to deliver results.  He expressed concern that Abu 
Mazen\'s \"first statements\" as Arafat\'s successor spoke about 
preserving Arafat\'s legacy and the Palestinian claim to a 
right of return to Israel.  Feinstein said that Abu Mazen had 
asked for help in unifying the PA security forces.  She asked 
what could be done to bolster Abu Mazen\'s position.  Shalom 
replied that Israel is in favor of support for Abu Mazen, and 
that Palestinians need better infrastructure and government 
services.  Abu Mazen, he said, should do his part by 
resettling Palestinians out of refugee camps. 
 
--------------- 
Regional Issues 
--------------- 
 
7. (C) Shalom commented that elections in Iraq could have a 
dramatic impact on the region by isolating extremist regimes, 
such as in Iran.  He complained that \"the Europeans\" did not 
take the Iranian threat seriously until Iran developed 
missiles capable of reaching Europe.   While the GOI does not 
oppose diplomatic efforts to block Iran\'s development of 
nuclear weapons, he said that other means exist.  He 
underlined the need to refer consideration of Iran\'s nuclear 
program to the UN Security Council. 
 
8. (C) Shalom decried Iran\'s support for terrorism against 
Israel, asserting that Iran now sends money to the families 
of Palestinian suicide terrorists.  Syria, he said, helps 
provide Iranian missiles to Hizballah, some 13,000 of which 
are now arrayed against Israel.  President Assad\'s peace 
overtures to Israel are encouraging, but meaningless, in 
Shalom\'s estimation, if Assad takes no action against 
terrorist groups operating from Syria.  Asked about the 
certainty of GOI assessments about Hizballah\'s missile 
strength, Shalom said that Israel can \"see\" the missiles, and 
that Syria and Hizballah do not deny their existence.

SUBJECT: PERES TO CODEL HAGEL/BIDEN: DISENGAGEMENT IS 
PRIORITY AS FIRST STEP TO PEACE 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 6045 
 
Classified By: DCM Gene A. Cretz for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Labor Party leader Shimon Peres told a 
visiting congressional delegation led by Senators Chuck Hagel 
and Joseph Biden December 1 that he supports joining the 
ruling coalition in the interest of advancing disengagement. 
He predicted (correctly) the likely failure of the 2005 
budget in a Knesset vote scheduled for that evening and the 
resulting collapse of Prime Minister Sharon\'s Likud-Shinui 
coalition brought on by Sharon\'s dismissal of Shinui 
ministers for voting against the budget.  Peres also 
expressed his views on Likud party divisions over 
disengagement, the Palestinian leadership, and on possible 
final status scenarios for Jerusalem and the Palestinian 
refugees\' right of return.  Peres emphasized the need for 
both Israel and the United States to assist the Palestinian 
leadership that is emerging after the death of Arafat. 
 
2.  (SBU) The delegation was comprised of senators Chuck 
Hagel, Joseph Biden, Dianne Feinstein, and Lincoln Chafee. 
The senators were accompanied by professional staff members 
Dr. Andrew Parasiliti, Tony Blinken, Puneet Talwar, Deborah 
Brayton, and Peter Cleveland.  Charge Cretz and poloff joined 
the meeting.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
Peres: Coalitions are Expensive 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Labor Party leader Shimon Peres correctly forecast to 
Codel Hagel/Biden December 1 that Prime Minister Sharon would 
not have the votes to pass his 2005 budget that evening 
(reftel), that the secular Shinui party would oppose the 
budget, and that, in response, Sharon would make good on his 
threat and dismiss Shinui from the government.  Referring to 
Sharon\'s NIS 290 million budget deal with the United Torah 
Judaism (UTJ) party, Peres noted that \"it is expensive to pay 
for a coalition,\" and that Shinui had decided to vote against 
the budget not for economic reasons, but to oppose the GOI\'s 
support for a religious party.  Peres explained that the 
failure to pass the budget that evening would not cause the 
government to fall.  He added that even no-confidence motions 
that achieve the requisite 61-vote absolute majority would 
still need to include a proposed alternate prime minister, 
something the varying opposition parties could never agree 
upon. 
 
4.  (C) Peres stressed that if Sharon asks Labor to join the 
coalition in the event Shinui departs, Labor will join to 
ensure that \"the first move toward peace -- disengagement\" 
goes forward.  \"Better to have a mediocre peace plan with a 
majority (of support),\" Peres said, \"than a brilliant plan 
with a minority.\"   Peres noted he does not support moving to 
early elections now, since this would mean postponing 
implementation of disengagement. 
In response to Senator Biden\'s question as to whether Sharon 
shares the view that implementing disengagement is of 
paramount importance, Peres said that he believes Sharon is 
\"convinced about (the need for) disengagement.\"  In Peres\' 
view, Sharon introduced his disengagement plan because he did 
not want to negotiate with Yasser Arafat or be \"dragged\" into 
accepting a third party\'s peace proposal. 
 
--------------------- 
Sharon Sees Realities 
--------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Senator Biden sought Peres\' view on Sharon\'s approach 
to the territories.  Peres opined that Sharon has \"turned 
from\" his earlier ideological approach, but that he has not 
yet made a \"U-turn.\"   Peres noted that Sharon knows that 
there must be a two-state solution, but what is not clear is 
where the borders of those two states would be.  \"(Sharon) is 
not convinced he needs to give back everything,\" Peres 
explained, \"but he appreciates the U.S. position.\"  In 
response to Peres\' observation that the settlers represent 
the greatest challenge now to Sharon, Senator Feinstein 
questioned why Sharon then continues to add to the 
settlements.  Peres said he could not explain \"mistakes,\" but 
added that it might be to soften the position of settlers 
with regard to disengagement. 
 
6.  (C) In response to Senator Biden\'s query about Likud\'s 
position on disengagement, Peres said that Likud generally 
supports Sharon on personal but not ideological grounds. 
Peres predicted that if Likud elections were to be held now, 
the party might choose a leader more to the right than 
Sharon.  It is because of his disengagement plan, Peres 
noted, that Sharon lost his traditional allies, the religious 
parties.  \"I\'m against religious parties,\" Peres underlined, 
and, making an inference to Shinui, said \"but I\'m also 
against anti-religious parties.\"  Peres stressed that Labor 
can help Sharon to achieve what he would like since relations 
between himself and Sharon \"are not poisoned.\"  \"I\'m aware of 
Sharon\'s problems,\" Peres added.  Biden queried whether 
National Security Chief Giora Eiland, who had briefed the 
Codel immediately before their meeting with Peres, 
represented Sharon\'s views.  Peres opined that Eiland \"is 
very serious,\" and, while not a spokesman for Sharon, does 
understand Sharon, although Eiland\'s thinking \"is a little 
more advanced.\" 
 
----------------------------- 
Peres Sees \"Great Opportunity\" 
----------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Regarding the Palestinian political climate after 
Arafat\'s death, Peres stressed that he has a \"high opinion\" 
of the present Palestinian leadership, noting that it is 
\"patriotic\" and savvy and \"cannot be sold a bill of goods.\" 
Peres underlined that the leadership really believes that 
terrorism is counterproductive to its goals.  While not 
discussing the details, Peres advocated that the U.S. and 
Israel support the Palestinian leadership in its efforts to 
bring the various factions under its control since it will 
need a \"competent force\" behind it.  Peres said that there 
are \"common denominators\" between what the Palestinians and 
the GOI see as a solution to the conflict.  The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaderships are \"more or less\" in agreement on 
borders, and land swaps could solve the differences, he said. 
 
---------------------------- 
Peres on Jerusalem, Refugees 
---------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Peres underlined that he would support reaching a 
solution to the conflict with the Palestinians one step at a 
time.  Peres said he would support giving back 50 percent of 
the occupied territories, and then working on giving back 
more.  Peres said there is \"no hurry\" to solve the issue of 
Jerusalem since Jews and Palestinians continue to live 
together.  He explained that Jerusalem is composed of the 
Holy Basin (or city) and the new city comprised of 18 suburbs 
-- 10 Jewish and eight Palestinian.  \"(Everyone) 
understands,\" Peres underlined, \"that all eight (Palestinian 
suburbs) would go to the Palestinian Authority...and that 
this will improve (Israel\'s) demography.\"  Peres advocated 
that Jerusalem\'s Holy Basin be an \"open city,\" dividing it up 
according to religious function, with Jews, Muslims and 
Christians wielding authority over their respective holy 
sites.  Joking that \"the Messiah is the best diplomat we ever 
had,\" Peres noted that Jews are forbidden to build on the 
Temple Mount \"until the Messiah arrives.\"  The UN Secretary 
General could serve as mayor of Jerusalem, Peres said, and 
the Israeli and Palestinian prime ministers would serve as 
the deputy mayors.  Peres said that he presented this idea to 
Arafat, who agreed with it but who noted that it would need 
the agreement of Muslim authorities. 
 
9.  (C) Peres stressed that the more urgent matter than 
Jerusalem is that of the Palestinian refugees\' right of 
return.  He noted that the Palestinians \"insist on the right 
of return\" and Israel wants the Arabs to stop raising this 
issue and to agree that all refugees will be settled in a 
future Palestinian state.  Senator Feinstein raised the 
prospect of the Geneva Initiative solution of Israel agreeing 
to a negotiated number of refugees returning to Israel. 
\"This won\'t fly,\" Peres responsed.

WITH CODEL HAGEL/BIDEN 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Gene A. Cretz for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: National Security Advisor Giora Eiland told 
Codel Hagel/Biden that the GOI is trying to avoid repeating 
the \"mistakes\" it made when PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas was 
prime minister in 2003.  In order to help Abbas succeed this 
time, the GOI, he said, will have to be \"more flexible\" about 
pursuing militants from the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, who 
present Abbas his foremost security challenge.  Eiland also 
advocated GOI transfer of security authority to the PA in 
areas where the PA says it can take over; a direct message to 
the Palestinian people from Israel\'s leadership, perhaps in a 
post-election speech to the PLC; trilateral negotiations 
about an Israeli withdrawal from the Philadelphi Strip ahead 
of disengagement; and, steps to boost the Palestinian 
economy.  Eiland complained that Egypt is unwilling to offer 
jobs to Palestinians in QIZs that could be built in the 
Sinai, and asserted that Arab leaders, in general, want to 
perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which they see 
as protection against pressure for reform.  Senator Feinstein 
pressed Eiland about Israeli settlement expansion.  Eiland 
reported that the GOI will change the route of the separation 
barrier, but that a Cabinet debate on route changes has been 
repeatedly postponed because of the political environment. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Senators Chuck Hagel, Joseph Biden, Dianne Feinstein, 
and Lincoln Chafee (Codel Hagel/Biden) queried National 
Security Advisor Giora Eiland about the Israeli approach to 
the new Palestinian leadership in a December 1 meeting in 
Jerusalem.  Eiland\'s staff member, Gabi Blum, joined the 
meeting, as did Charge, poloff, and Senate staff and military 
escorts from the codel. 
 
--------------------- 
Helping Abbas Succeed 
--------------------- 
 
3. (C) In recounting the Codel\'s November 30 meeting with PLO 
Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, Sen. Feinstein commented that Abbas 
seemed prepared to do all that Prime Minister Sharon had told 
the Codel, in another November 30 meeting (septel), that he 
expected of the PA.  Eiland remarked that the GOI is trying 
to avoid the \"mistakes\" it made during Abbas\'s brief term as 
PA prime minister in 2003.  Asked for examples of GOI 
mistakes, Eiland cited public statements GOI officials made 
about their expectations for the PA, notably a weakened 
Arafat.  Such statements, he said, embarrassed Abbas and 
helped set Arafat against him.  Another \"mistake\" Eiland 
cited was GOI reluctance to take the security risks that 
would have left ordinary Palestinians with a sense of change 
in their lives.  \"We weren\'t generous enough,\" he said, 
quickly adding that deficiencies in the GOI approach were not 
the main cause for Abbas\'s failure as prime minister.  He 
blamed instead Arafat, Hamas, and the armed Fatah factions 
for Abbas\'s resignation. 
 
4. (C) Sen. Feinstein said that Abbas had told the Codel that 
he wished to see disengagement linked to the three phases of 
the roadmap.  Expressing surprise, Eiland said that the GOI 
does not believe that disengagement relieves the PA of its 
security obligations under Phase One of the roadmap.  The GOI 
accepted the roadmap, he said, only because its sequencing, 
contrary to that of Oslo and other earlier peace efforts, 
placed action on security before negotiations over final 
status issues. 
 
5. (C) Stressing his recognition that an outsider could make 
policy recommendations but that Israel had to contend with 
terrorism and would bear the consequences of a policy 
failure, Sen. Biden expressed the view that Arafat\'s death 
provides the first opportunity in over 30 years for realizing 
a two-state solution.  The new PA leaders, he said, \"appear 
enlightened\" and \"appear to recognize the need for a 
two-state solution,\"  but their constituency is small. 
Abbas, moreover, has no control over Iran and Hizballah, who, 
Biden noted citing GOI figures, instigate 80% of planned 
terrorist attacks emanating from the West Bank.  Biden noted 
that he had asked Sharon in the November 30 meeting whether 
the PM had refined his security expectations for the PA given 
Abbas\'s inability to control Iranian/Hizballah interference. 
Biden asked for Eiland\'s views of Abbas\'s security 
capabilities. 
 
6. (C) The GOI has to change how it thinks and makes 
decisions about security, Eiland replied.  Abbas\'s primary 
security challenge, he said, comes from the armed wing of 
Fatah, principally the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.  Unlike 
Hamas, which can rely on its social activities to sustain its 
political and financial support during a cease-fire, al-Aqsa 
depends entirely on the use of violence for its support.  Abu 
Mazen can dissuade al-Aqsa from using violence and accepting 
financial assistance from Iran only if the GOI is \"more 
flexible\" and \"creative\" in its approach to pursuing wanted 
members of al-Aqsa, Eiland said.  Biden praised Eiland\'s 
pragmatism. 
 
7. (C) Saying she was startled by the poor conditions, 
unhappy faces, and ethnic separation she saw while being 
driven through Abu Dis the day before, Sen. Feinstein pointed 
to the need for Israel to give hope to the \"occupied.\" 
Eiland replied that a number of GOI steps along these lines 
were possible, although the GOI would generally refrain from 
action before the PA elections.  He advocated the following 
steps: 
 
-- Transfering security authority to the PA for those towns 
in which Abbas says the PA is ready to assume control.  Abbas 
will have to take big risks in doing so, Eiland commented, 
adding that \"Arab\" leaders, in general, are averse to being 
held accountable. 
 
-- Having \"Israeli leadership\" address the Palestinian people 
directly, perhaps in an address to the Palestinian 
Legislative Council after the PA elections. 
 
-- Giving Abbas \"achievements\" beyond the withdrawal of 
Israelis from the Gaza Strip, a step that all know Israel 
will take regardless of the Palestinian leadership.  Eiland 
advocated, in particular, Israeli-Palestinian-Egyptian 
cooperation leading to the IDF evacuation of the Philadelphi 
Strip prior to completion of the disengagement plan.  An IDF 
withdrawal from Philadelphi, he said, would allow Abbas to 
say that he had convinced Israel to depart and thereby to 
abandon its intention to keep Gazans in \"jail.\"  Abbas could, 
moreover, claim responsibility for returning to Gazans the 
freedom that they have not known since 1948, Eiland said. 
 
-- Promoting Palestinian economic improvements.  Blum listed 
economic dimensions in which she said that the GOI has 
already made commitments to the World Bank: upgrading 
passages in and out of both Gaza and the West Bank; 
developing industrial zones; and, transferring settlement 
assets.  On the latter point, Blum noted that the GOI 
understands that PA Prime Minister Ahmed Querei\'a has told 
World Bank officials that the PA does not wish to take over 
private homes on the Gaza settlements.  This PA attitude, she 
said, would facilitate GOI plans to dismantle the homes.  In 
response to Sen. Feinstein\'s question, Blum said the GOI also 
planned to dismantle synagogues and transfer cemeteries. 
 
8. (C) Sen. Feinstein asked for GOI views on Egyptian 
proposals to increase the number of Qualified Industrial 
Zones (QIZs) in Egypt.  The GOI, Eiland replied, believes 
that QIZs in the Sinai could provide jobs for Palestinians, 
but gave up pursuing the issue after the GOE had insisted on 
limiting employment in the QIZs to Egyptians.  Blum said that 
the \"official\" GOE reasons for refusing proposals to employ 
Palestinians in Sinai QIZs included wage gaps between 
Egyptians and Palestinians, the high unemployment rate among 
Sinai residents, and local content laws.  Eiland charged that 
the unspoken GOE rationale is that it does not want 
Palestinians coming to Egypt. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Promoting a Constructive Approach from the Arab World 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
9. (C) Eiland complained about the \"less than constructive\" 
attitude of the Arab world in general to resolving the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Arab leaders, he charged, do 
not want to see an end to the conflict because the conflict 
provides them their \"ultimate excuse\" for resisting post-9/11 
reform pressures from the U.S. and EU.  He claimed that 
mostly official, Saudi sources continued \"until recently\" to 
account for 70% of the funding going to Hamas.  Sen. 
Feinstein asked what the U.S. could do to change Saudi 
behavior.  Eiland said the U.S. should point to the real 
nature of Hamas \"charities\" to urge the Saudis to stop 
funding Hamas. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Dealing with Settlement Expansion 
--------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Sen. Feinstein asked Eiland why, especially in light 
of the opportunities of the moment, the GOI continues to 
\"add\" settlements.  Eiland denied that the GOI is \"adding\" 
settlements.  Internal Israeli political realities, he said, 
limit how far PM Sharon can now go with settlement removals. 
As long as settlers remain in the territories, the GOI must 
protect and support them. 
 
11. (C) Sen. Feinstein noted that she had seen new housing 
going up in Jewish areas as she was en route to Ramallah the 
day before, and that she had heard about the GOI demolition 
of a Palestinian-owned hotel in Abu Dis.  Why, she asked, 
does the GOI continue to complicate chances for peace in the 
future?  Why does the GOI not stop all settlement activity? 
Eiland replied that the GOI does not consider construction 
anywhere in Jerusalem as settlement activity, adding that he 
would not comment on the wisdom of building Jewish 
neighborhoods so close to Palestinian areas.  Later in the 
meeting, Sen. Biden, emphasizing that Israel has no better 
friend than him in the Senate, asserted that there is 
widespread belief that Israel is \"expanding settlements.\" 
This has a real impact, both politically and psychologically, 
on Americans, the vast majority of whom, not just Jews and 
Evangelical Christians, are committed to the well-being of 
Israel. 
 
---------------------------- 
Update on Separation Barrier 
---------------------------- 
 
12. (C) In response to a query about the West Bank separation 
barrier, Eiland reported that the GOI has not yet taken any 
final decisions, either officially or in internal 
deliberations, about changes to the route of the fence. 
Everyone understands, however, that the Israeli High Court 
decision invalidating sections of the route, along with 
international pressure including \"understandings\" with the 
USG, would require the GOI to change the route, Eiland said. 
He predicted that route changes would soon be presented to 
the Cabinet.  A Cabinet debate has been repeatedly postponed 
\"week to week,\" he said, because of \"political sensitivities.\"

E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/02/2014 
TAGS: PREL, OREP, PTER, KPAL, IS, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS, GOI EXTERNAL 
SUBJECT: SHARON AND CODEL HAGEL/BIDEN: COMMITMENT TO 
WORKING WITH NEW PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP 
 
Classified By: DCM Gene A. Cretz for reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Prime Minister Sharon told Codel Hagel/Biden 
that he was fully committed to making peace with the 
post-Arafat Palestinian leadership, but that there would be 
no compromise on holding the the new leadership accountable 
for actions to combat the terrorist infrastructure.  While 
recognizing that Syria, Iran, and Hizbollah could undermine 
the new leadership, Sharon nonetheless offered little by way 
of understanding or sympathy toward the leadership\'s 
challenge.  Some in the Codel challenged Sharon to seize this 
unique opportunity to help Israel (and the international 
community) combat a major cause of international terrorism 
(the Israeli-Palestinian dispute) and rising anti-Semitism. 
Sharon reiterated concerns about Iran, thought Egypt could do 
more against smuggling, lauded the bilateral relationship 
with Jordan and argued that the USG should ratchet up 
pressure against Syria to stop its support for Iran and 
Hizbollah.  The Prime Minister said that Israel was prepared 
to take positive steps toward the new Palestinian leadership 
after the elections and believed that Europe and others also 
had important roles to play on the economic support front. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Prime Minister Sharon led off his November 30 meeting 
with Codel Hagel/Biden (accompanied by Charge) by asserting 
that bilateral ties with the U.S. had never been stronger, 
reflected best in close strategic cooperation.  Acknowledging 
he faced challenges on the internal political front, Sharon 
nonetheless pledged that Israel was prepared to make genuine 
compromises for real peace with the new Palestinian 
leadership if that new order put a stop to terror.  He was 
fully committed to making peace despite major domestic 
struggles characterized by a \"left\" which has no power and a 
\"right\" which was totally opposed to his initiative.  The PM 
saw the current timeframe as a window of opportunity and 
reiterated Israeli acceptance of all of President Bush\'s 
initiatives and bilateral agreements over the past few years 
regarding the future of the region.  He noted that Israel had 
not openly interfered with the process of choosing 
presumptive Palestinian leaders and that secret contacts 
continued.  He asserted that Israel was prepared to help the 
Palestinians through the elections and that open talks would 
occur soon after.  Sharon had no \"personal\" problems with Abu 
Mazen or Abu Ala\'a; everything depended on the steps they 
would take against terror.  As he did throughout the 
discussion, Sharon noted the dangers presented \"from the 
outside\" by the Iran/Syria/Hizbollah nexus and the impact it 
could have on the future, despite the best of Palestinian 
intentions and potential actions. 
 
3. (C) In response to a Codel member\'s comment that progress 
towards Israeli-Palestinian peace would have a dramatic 
impact on ending regional and international terrorism, Sharon 
quickly stated that Israel should not be held responsible for 
terrorism, asserting that it was the target of terror even 
prior to June 1967.  It was not correct to believe that 
terror would disappear if the Israeli-Palestinian dispute 
were solved.  The only thing that Israel was \"responsible\" 
for, he maintained, was defending its people.  Sharon went on 
to defend Israel\'s actions saying that there would have been 
more progress on the roadmap had there been a Palestinian 
partner.  Now, with Arafat\'s passing, a new opportunity had 
arisen to implement the alternative Gaza disengagement with 
cooperation with the Palestinian Authority.  Sharon could now 
envision cooperation between the security services against 
terror and cooperation to ensure that the Israeli population 
move from the West Bank settlements and Gaza did not take 
place under fire.  Sharon asserted that with the tens of 
thousands of armed people under the Palestinian Authority, 
they should be able to do what they need to do to oppose the 
terrorism in their midst.  Israel, in any case, will not bow 
or give in to pressure.  Subsequent to a successful Gaza 
disengagement, the roadmap could be implemented in stages. 
 
4. (C) On Iran, Sharon said the GOI watched the situation 
closely and was in close touch with the EU and USG.  Israel 
did not have to lead the effort, it should be an 
international one culminating in the UNSC.  While monitoring 
of Iranian nuclear facilities might postpone the timing of 
weaponization, the Iranians continued \"to work\" and Tehran 
had no desire to stop.  While praising the efforts of the UK, 
Germany, and France to craft the agreement with Iran, the PM 
believed the matter needed to be brought to the UNSC.   While 
moderate Iranians may exist, the religious element was 
overwhelming and the goal of the Iranian regime remained the 
elimination of Israel and the destruction of the Jewish 
people. 
 
5. (C) Sharon warned of the continuing dangers posed by 
Syria, Iran, and Hizbollah.  A Hizbollah armed with 13,000 
rockets, bolstered by a recalcitrant Syrian regime continuing 
to support Iran and refusing to expel Hamas and PIJ 
leaderships, made for a dangerous situation to which USG 
pressure needed to be brought to bear. Sharon asserted that 
most of the terrorism in the Palestinian territories was 
carried out by the Tanzim on orders from Damascus or 
Hizbollah.  The situation has quieted down because Israel has 
become more efficient, he said, but the danger continues. 
 
6. (C) Regarding Egypt, Sharon said that Cairo could do more 
to stop the smuggling of arms into Gaza, including anti-tank 
rockets allegedly coming into the Sinai via Lebanon.  The 
Egyptians were doing more than before on that score but they 
neglected the situation for so many years that the 
well-developed smuggling routes went on.  Neither Egypt nor 
the Europeans had a role now to help in furthering 
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.  If 
\"balance\" were needed the U.S. would provide it. 
 
7. (C) Relations with Jordan were close, even strategic, said 
Sharon.  The Jordanians are active in acting against terror. 
The bilateral cooperation was a direct result of how peace 
had changed the situation. 
 
8. (C) Senator Biden agreed that Sharon was now in a unique 
position of leadership vis-a-vis his own government to help 
Abu Mazen who faced two major problems: he lacked a natural 
constituency and, by Sharon\'s own admission, he faced 
external forces not of his doing that could undermine his 
authority.  Biden asserted that Sharon was well-placed to 
help on the electoral process and on cooperation on Gaza 
disengagement at a minimum to enhance Abu Mazen\'s 
credibility.  Biden also asked what the U.S. could do to 
help.  Sharon believed that Washington could help in 
minimizing the external challenges to Abu Mazen by warning 
Syria, Iran and Hizbollah to stop any actions that undermine 
Abu Mazen.  Damascus was feeling pressure already on Lebanon 
and Iraq; that needed to be ratcheted up significantly to 
make sure Assad got the point.  Sharon also thought that the 
international community should do its part by helping Abu 
Mazen and Fayyad through infrastructure projects, not just 
the provision of cash, which would \"disappear.\"  For its 
part, Israel would help by continuing to be discreet in steps 
it took in support of Abu Mazen before the election.  Once 
that election took place, Israel was ready to help on the 
humanitarian side by lifting roadblocks and checkpoints (as 
long as steps were taken against the movement of terrorists) 
and in other cooperative agreements such as the one reached 
between the two tourism ministers on cooperating for the 
upcoming holiday season. 
 
9. (C) Senator Feinstein told Sharon that he now had the 
partner he had been seeking and needed to deal positively and 
proactively with the new Palestinian leadership not only for 
Israel\'s security sake, but to combat the rise of virulent 
anti-Semitism in Europe.  She also expressed the hope that 
the USG should also be playing a more active role in pushing 
the sides toward a solution.  Sharon replied by asserting 
that anti-Semitism attributed to Israeli actions is mere 
cover and convenience.  He noted that one easy step the 
Palestinians could take now even before tackling the more 
difficult task of dismantling the terrorist infrastructure 
would be to stop the incitement against Israel.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Echoed by all media, Channel 2-TV last night reported 
that in the wake of U.S. complaints about Israeli 
deviations from weapons purchasing and sales rules and 
about an Israeli report to the U.S. about a weapons 
sale to China, the Pentagon (leading media named U/S of 
Defense Douglas Feith) has demanded that the GOI 
dismiss Defense Ministry D-G Amos Yaron.  Yediot quoted 
senior Israeli sources as saying that Feith has made 
these claims because he feels pressured by FBI 
investigations currently conducted against him and 
other Pentagon officials in the alleged Larry 
Franklin/AIPAC affair.  Channel 2-TV said that Israel 
is now upgrading a sophisticated weapons system for 
China and has not informed the Pentagon about it. 
Quoting Israeli sources, Channel 2-TV reported that the 
system, which was not identified, has been returned to 
Israel for repair and maintenance.  Israel Radio cited 
denials by Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz, Israel\'s 
Ambassador to the U.S. Danny Ayalon, and a Pentagon 
spokesman, who said this was not a personal issue, but 
a matter of policy that has been discussed between the 
countries.  The station quoted the spokesman as saying 
that nobody in the Pentagon had demanded Yaron\'s 
dismissal.  Jerusalem Post quoted defense officials as 
saying Wednesday that the U.S. has demanded 
clarification of the matter and that a joint inquiry 
has been launched.  Israel Radio cited Israeli 
officials as saying that the weapons sale took place in 
the early 1990s and that Israel did not sell weapons to 
China after the Phalcon AWACS affair.  Former 
ambassador to China Ora Namir told Israel Radio this 
morning that there is not enough supervision within the 
Defense Ministry. 
 
All media reported that Wednesday at the Herzliya 
Conference, FM Silvan Shalom called for the reconvening 
of last year\'s Aqaba summit to show support for 
Palestinian moderates and to jump-start negotiations 
with the PA.  He said: \"Everyone must do everything 
they can to ensure that this year will be the year of 
the moderates.\"  He called on the Palestinian 
leadership to \"immediately make a decision to defeat 
terror\" following the January 9 elections in the PA. 
Shalom also said that rather than trying to negotiate a 
final-status deal with Syrian President Bashar Assad, 
Israel should adopt an evolutionary,\" step-by-step 
approach similar to what is now being employed with the 
Palestinians.  Shalom conditioned the resumption of 
peace negotiations with Syria upon the cessation of 
Syrian support for terrorism.  Channel 2-TV and Yediot 
cited sources in Sharon\'s bureau as saying that a 
second Aqaba convention is in opposition to the PM\'s 
position.  Channel 2-TV also said that Sharon was \"less 
than enthusiastic \" about confidence-building measures 
on the Syrian track. 
Israel Radio quoted Sharon adviser Dov Weisglass as 
saying this morning at the Herzliya Conference that 
British PM Tony Blair intends to convene Palestinian 
and European officials in London in around two months 
to discuss ways to assist the Palestinians.  Weisglass 
said that Arafat\'s departure has created an   entirely 
different condition, and that Arafat\'s heirs are 
\"normal people anchored to reality, who understand they 
will have to agree to the rules of the game.\" 
Weisglass praised the role of the U.S., which he said 
makes sure that the Palestinians \"do their homework.\" 
 
Israel Radio reported that President Bush has written 
Secretary of State Colin Powell regarding the 
 
SIPDIS 
postponement for another six months of any relocation 
of the U.S. Embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to 
Jerusalem. 
 
Leading media reported that last night five Israelis 
were wounded, two of them moderately, in two shooting 
incidents on the Gaza Strip\'s Kissufim-Gush Katif road. 
IDF soldiers killed two of the attackers.  Israel Radio 
reported that this morning four mortar shells were 
launched at Israeli targets in the northern Gaza Strip. 
There were no casualties.  Jerusalem Post reported that 
in a concerted effort to boost security against the 
threat of terrorism from the sea, Israel Navy has 
dramatically increased the number of surprise at-sea 
boarding on merchant ships heading to Israeli ports. 
 
Leading media (banner in Jerusalem Post) reported that 
PM Sharon warned the Labor Party that he will initiate 
early elections if his final offer to join the 
coalition is not accepted.  Leading media reported that 
Labor is interested in controlling various ministerial 
portfolios, as well as the Israel Lands Administration 
(ILA) and the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA). 
Israel Radio reported that chief Labor negotiator in 
the coalition talks Dalia Itzik has complained about 
Likud\'s \"greed.\"  The radio reported that this morning 
Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres will meet with Sharon 
at Peres\'s request to try to solve the differences 
between the sides. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Wednesday PLO Chairman 
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) rejected a new Israeli 
initiative to resettle Palestinian refugees in the West 
Bank, Gaza Strip, and neighboring Arab countries. 
Ha\'aretz reported that Wednesday Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad strongly criticized remarks made by Abbas that 
the use of weapons in the second Intifada was a mistake 
and that it should end. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Egypt has postponed until April 
2005 its increased deployment of soldiers along the 
Egyptian side of the Philadelphi route on the Sinai- 
Gaza border in the Rafah area.  Ha\'aretz also reported 
that the release of Palestinian prisoners that is to be 
carried out as part of the goodwill gestures aimed at 
the PA and Egypt is likely to take place next week. 
Israel Radio quoted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as 
saying that there is an agreement between Egypt and the 
U.S. regarding advancement of the peace process soon. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Wednesday, the Knesset\'s Finance 
Committee allocated 90 million shekels (about USD 2 
million) for the paving of a West Bank road linking 
Anatot and Azariya north of Jerusalem.  The newspaper 
notes that this sum represents around 10 percent of the 
overall annual road construction budget, which will 
amount to 1 billion shekels in 2005. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Jerusalem and Diaspora 
Affairs Minister Natan Sharansky has asked UN Secretary- 
General Kofi Annan and National Security Advisor and 
secretary of state-designate Condoleezza Rice to act to 
 
SIPDIS 
put an end to the broadcasting of two anti-Semitic TV 
series sponsored by Iran and Syria, one of which is 
screened on Hizbullah\'s Al Manar-TV. 
 
Israel Radio reported that World Bank President James 
Wolfensohn will visit the region next week. 
 
Yediot reported that in the next few days a USD 2- 
billion suit against the Arab Bank will be filed in a 
New York federal court in the name of hundreds of 
Israeli victims of terrorist actions carried out by 
Hamas and Islamic Jihad. 
 
Jerusalem Post and Yediot reported that in what Israeli 
officials are calling a first, Israel is sending some 
USD 20,000 in aid to Sudan to help alleviate the 
humanitarian crisis there. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Shahram Chubin, an expert on Iranian 
foreign policy who attended the Herzliya Conference, as 
saying that the U.S. missed an opportunity to conduct 
negotiations with Iran about terrorism and the nuclear 
issue after the occupation of Baghdad. 
 
Israel Radio reported that New York City businessman 
Leib Kohn admitted Wednesday to participating in an 
arms smuggling ring that shipped missile and fighter 
jet components from the U.S. to Israel and possibly on 
to Iran.  Kohn bought the parts from companies in 
Connecticut and California.

as if there has been no Intifada.\" 
 
Former editor-in-chief Moshe Ishon wrote in 
nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe: \"One doesn\'t need to

Arafat\'s scepter.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Beyond Words\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(December 16): \"\'The use of weapons in the current 
Intifada is damaging and must cease.\'  That was the 
important message that PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas 
delivered in his first statement on the subject 
following the death of Yasser Arafat.  It was not the 
first time that Abbas made such a statement, but its 
importance this time is derived from his position, and 
the anticipation that it will be received with 
understanding and acceptance, by a majority of 
Palestinians -- the same majority that in recent public 
opinion polls has expressed the view that the 
negotiations with Israel should be resumed.... Abu 
Mazen\'s remarks were not meant for Jerusalem and 
Washington\'s ears, but were spoken to Ash-Sharq Al- 
Awsat, in Arabic -- as Israel has often demanded, to 
the Arab and not only the Palestinian public.  It was 
meant for every Arab and Palestinian movement and 
school of thought, inside and outside the territories, 
including Iran and Hezbollah, so that they know the 
intentions of the person who will be running the PA.... 
Against that background, Israel, too, no less than the 
Palestinian leadership, now faces a test in the eyes of 
its public.  For Israel, at least based on Abu Mazen\'s 
remarks, must also adopt a new attitude, based on the 
existence of a serious Palestinian partner with whom to 
conduct negotiations.  Israel need not worry that its 
embrace might mark Abu Mazen in Palestinian eyes as a 
collaborator.  The Palestinian public certainly would 
not regard its leader as a traitor if he won freedom 
for Palestinian prisoners directly from Israel, and not 
at the request of the Hezbollah or Egypt, or if Israel 
unfroze Palestinian funds and reduced the military 
operations to the absolute necessary minimum.  Indeed, 
that is what the Palestinian public now expects.\" 
 
II.  \"Economy and Peace\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker editorialized in mass-circulation, pluralist 
Yediot Aharonot (December 16): \"One cannot exaggerate 
the political and economic importance of the agreement 
to establish a joint Israeli-Egyptian industrial zone 
whose products are intended for the American market and 
which will enjoy far-reaching benefits.  The agreement, 
which was signed in an official ceremony the likes of 
which has not been held in Cairo for years, lays a new 
infrastructure for business cooperation between Israeli 
and Egyptian industrialists on the basis of profits for 
both.  It opens the enormous U.S. markets before them 
on condition that they join hands and funds in 
investments and manufacture.  A joint industrial zone 
of a similar nature operates in Jordan with enormous 
success.  It has survived the entire Intifada.  The 
Egyptian-Israeli peace appeared dead in recent years. 
Now it has revived: another result of disengagement 
from Gaza and the changes in the Palestinian 
leadership.  The strengthening of economic connections 
is not a substitute for peace, but it helps to anchor 
it.  When new winds blow in the Middle East, we must 
not miss out on them.\" 
 
 
 
 
III.  \"Arafat is Dead, Oslo Returns\" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot (December 16): \"Four years after the Oslo 
process shattered in a tremendous crash, a Likud 
government headed by Ariel Sharon has gone back to its 
fundamental premises, as if there has been no Intifada, 
as if we haven\'t suffered more than 1,000 dead, as if 
Israeli society had not matured since.  In other words, 
nothing was learned.... Since [Abbas] remembers his 
last attempt to come out against the Intifada, which 
culminated in his disgraceful ouster from office, he is 
probably the last person who is going to combat 
terrorism.... In the Oslo days, people said we need to 
engage in negotiations with the Palestinian side as if 
there is no terror.... It was Ariel Sharon who said 
that no negotiations would be held until all terrorism 
stopped.  But now the negotiations are being resumed, 
this time using backchannels, there is a sense of a new 
era dawning, but terror is still running rampant, 
mainly in the Gaza Strip.... And finally, the idea of a 
new Middle East is back in the arena: economic 
development will, by necessity, produce positive 
political changes.... More than 90 percent of the fruit 
of [the U.S.-sponsored free trade] agreement will be 
picked by Egypt, which still has not explained why 
three-quarters of the foreign aid it receives from the 
U.S. is used for the acquisition of weaponry and 
military equipment.  That amassment of military might 
is aimed only against Israel.... Sharon has proven 
himself to be Peres\'s twin when it comes to all the 
eschatological beliefs of the Oslo process about 
Palestinian democracy, a Palestinian war on terror and 
regional economic development.  Perhaps that is the 
logic of having Peres join the government and play a 
key role.\" 
 
IV.  \"Abu Mazen\'s Double Game\" 
 
Former editor-in-chief Moshe Ishon wrote in 
nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe (December 16): \"One day. 
[Abu Mazen] swore he would faithfully continue Yasser 
Arafat\'s anti-Israeli line.  On another day, he 
promised to follow a balanced policy that would 
supposedly soon lead to peace with Israel.  His fickle 
policy found its expression this week, following the 
murderous attack in Rafah.  In his initial response, he 
justified the terror attack against IDF soldiers.  Abu 
Mazen said this was occupied territory and that Israel 
did not have any right to be there.  He later avoided 
responding.... Judging by the Palestinian Authority\'s 
current actions, notably the conduct of Abu Mazen, who 
is making inconsistent remarks, it is difficult to 
determine not only where he is heading, but also where 
he will lead the PA after seizing the reins of 
power.... If Abu Mazen outwardly apparently endeavors 
to create the impression that he is confident about 
publicly expressing his thoughts, one doesn\'t need to 
make many efforts to reach the conclusion that he is 
following in Yasser Arafats\' footsteps.  In fact, this 
is what he stated on the day he received Arafat\'s 
scepter.\"

1. (C) Summary.  Finance Ministry Senior Advisor Rani 
Loebenstein informed Mission that Israeli courts will release 
in December an additional NIS 136 million in attached 
revenues related to acts of terror.  Of this, NIS 16 million 
will be deducted to pay down PA debts to Israeli utilities. 
The MoF official had earlier predicted the courts would be 
loath to release such funds in view of the political impact. 
It appears the personal intervention of PA Finance Minister 
Fayyad with the Israeli courts was decisive. This brings the 
total amount of attached revenues (not counting utility 
deductions) released by Israeli courts to date approximately 
to NIS 523 million out of NIS 880 million, leaving Israeli 
courts to release NIS 357 million.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) In separate meetings with EconCouns and Econ Deputy, 
Loebenstein said that PA Finance Minister Salaam Fayyad had 
personally contacted Israeli courts to request the release of 
attached revenues related to terror.  In response to Fayyad\'s 
request, which was supported by the GOI, the courts had 
agreed to release NIS 136 million out of NIS 156 million 
attached for such acts, basing the decision on the argument 
that the original level of attachments was inappropriately 
large.  Of this, the PA would pay down NIS 16 million of 
Israeli utility debts.  According to Loebenstein, Israeli 
courts have yet to release approximately NIS 357 million in 
attached revenues. 
 
3.  (C) To date, Israeli courts have released the following 
attached revenues (all amounts in NIS millions): 
 
Tranche Number: 1 
Date: November 2 
Gross Amount Released: 144.5 
Utility Deductions: 45 
Net Payout: NIS 99.5 million 
 
Tranche Number: 2

Net Payout: NIS 120 million 
 
Total Gross Attachment Payout to Date: NIS 523 million

SUBJECT: PERES TELLS CODEL BLUNT IMPORTANT FOR U.S. TO 
SUPPORT PALESTINIANS NOW 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: In a December 13 meeting, Labor Party leader 
Shimon Peres told Codel Blunt that he hoped Likud and Labor 
would form a new coalition to avoid early elections and the 
consequent postponement of implementation of Gaza 
disengagement.  Peres noted that with Yasser Arafat\'s death 
and the upcoming Palestinian elections, an important 
opportunity exists to advance the peace process.  He stressed 
the importance of international and, in particular, USG 
assistance to the Palestinians, including economic aid.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (U) Codel Blunt consisted of Representatives Roy Blunt, 
Steny Hoyer, Mark Kirk, Tom Cole and Ben Cardin, who were 
accompanied by staffers Brian Gaston, Brian Diffell, and 
Geoff Plague, as well as military escorts Colonel Randy 
O\'Boyle and Captain Eugene Barlow.  Ambassador Kurtzer and 
poloff notetaker attended the meeting. 
 
------------------- 
Coalition: So Close 
------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Labor Party leader Shimon Peres told Codel Blunt 
December 13 that he \"hopes\" Likud and Labor find a way to 
form a unity government to avoid early elections.  Peres 
noted that holding early elections would be \"a tragedy\" since 
this would delay implementation of the disengagement plan by 
months.  Peres stressed that \"2005 should be devoted to 
policies, not politics.\"  Without Labor in the coalition, 
Peres said, Sharon would not have a majority to support 
disengagement. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Peres on the PA Leadership, Obstacles to Peace 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4.  (C) Peres stressed that Yasser Arafat\'s death presented a 
\"rare\" opportunity, and that a positive Palestinian 
leadership could emerge.  He noted that this leadership would 
face the challenge of working as a team and establishing 
credibility with the Palestinian people.  He said that, to 
further the peace process, three obstacles would need to be 
overcome: the status of Jerusalem, the Palestinian refugees\' 
right of return to Israel, and borders.  Peres advocated 
postponing negotiations on the status of Jerusalem, as the 
\"current climate\" is not conducive to resolving the issue. 
Peres also said that the Palestinian leadership is not 
\"ready\" to give up the right of return.  He advocated the 
establishment of a viable Palestinian state before attempting 
to resolve this issue.  Peres opined that the issue of 
borders is something that could be resolved, but he added 
that Palestinian leaders such as Abu Mazen and Abu Ala\'a 
would need to take tough positions to prove themselves to the 
Palestinian public.  Peres said that Sharon has lost his 
reason for unilateralism with the death of Arafat. 
 
---------------------- 
Palestinians Need Help 
---------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Israel will be leaving the Palestinians \"in a 
terrible economic situation\" once it withdraws from Gaza, 
Peres said.  Peres advocated that a reconstruction campaign 
be mounted in Gaza and suggested that the USG ask Saudi 
Arabia to provide greater assistance to the Palestinians.  He 
opined that the Saudis could use their oil revenues to cover 
the cost of such assistance.  Peres underlined that the 
Palestinians need to see advantages of disengagement, 
including an improved economy.  He suggested that the U.S. 
and the EU consider including the Palestinians within free 
trade zones.  Gaza needs assistance addressing its water 
needs and with modernizing its agriculture, Peres added. 
\"They are on the verge of starvation,\" Peres stressed.  \"We 
cannot allow poverty to replace occupation,\" he said. 
 
6.  (C) Peres advocated Israeli withdrawal from all 
Palestinian cities in preparation for Palestinian elections. 
Peres stressed that the new leadership will need to ensure a 
transparent financial system and a unified security force 
after the elections.  In response to the Codel\'s query, Peres 
opined that PA chief negotiator Saeb Erekat -- with whom the 
Codel would meet later that day -- is \"reasonable, 
democratic, and means well\" but that \"he is not a top 
leader.\"  Peres referred to Marwan Barghouti, who was 
convicted in Israel of terrorist acts, as \"a pain in the 
neck\" and not in the same class as Abu Mazen.  He expressed 
relief that Barghouti decided to support Abu Mazen in the 
upcoming elections instead of running himself.  Peres 
stressed that USG support for the Palestinian elections and 
its new leadership is \"very important.\"  Peres noted that Abu 
Ala\'a and Abu Mazen were currently traveling in the Arab 
world to raise support for the PA. 
 
7.  (U) Codel Blunt did not clear this message.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media quoted PM Sharon as saying at the Herzliya 
Conference last night that 2005 will be a \"year of 
great opportunity\" for Israel, and that the 
disengagement plan is the \"foundation and cornerstone 
for the great opportunities that lie before us.\"  For 
the first time, Sharon proposed to \"coordinate various 
elements relating to our disengagement plan with the 
future Palestinian government -- a government which is 
ready and able to take responsibility for the areas 
which we leave.\"  The media quoted Sharon as saying 
that disengagement from Gaza does not tear the nation 
apart, but that it unites it.  Jerusalem Post reported 
that the PA reacted angrily to Sharon\'s comments, 
saying he would not find a partner on the Palestinian 
side for his vision.  The newspaper quoted Mahmoud 
Abbas (Abu Mazen) as saying, during a visit to Qatar, 
that the Palestinians completely reject Sharon\'s 
statements.  He stressed that the Palestinians will 
never surrender the right of the refugees to return 
home. 
 
Ha\'aretz web site quoted senior GOI sources as saying 
Friday that Israel supports a Middle East peace 
conference planned by British PM Tony Blair for 
February, but that it will not participate in it.  They 
said Israel sees the conference as a forum for 
encouraging reforms in the PA.  Palestinian, European 
and American representatives will be attending the 
conference. 
 
Israel Radio reported that IDF forces made an incursion 
into the Khan Yunis refugee camp last night, in an 
attempt to neutralize rocket launchings.  The radio 
quoted Palestinian sources as saying that two 
Palestinians were killed and eight were wounded in the 
operation.  The station cited the IDF as saying that 
\"five terrorists\" were killed.  The radio this 
afternoon reported that five Palestinians were killed 
in the collapse of a tunnel along the Gaza-Egypt 
border, and that five others are missing.  The IDF is 
assisting the rescue operation. 
 
Maariv (Ben Caspit) reported that the cabinet vote on 
the evacuation of settlements as part of the 
disengagement plan will take place next month instead 
of in mid-June 2005, and that it will apparently be 
conducted in a single show of hands regarding all 
settlements in question, and not in separate votes 
concerning four groups of settlements.  Caspit says 
that senior Justice Ministry officials told Sharon that 
the High Court of Justice would contest a vote on the 
evacuation of 7,500 settlers two weeks before the 
actual evacuation.  In another article, Caspit reported 
that the Israeli authorities could allow members of 
Palestinian security forces to carry weapons beyond the 
date of the upcoming elections, if those turn out well. 
 
Ha\'aretz, Yediot and other media reported that the U.S. 
Department of Defense -- according to Yediot and 
Jerusalem Post, the department\'s deputy spokesman Bryan 
Whitman -- denied Thursday that U/S of Defense Douglas 
Feith is demanding the resignation of Defense Ministry 
D-G Amos Yaron.  However, Ha\'aretz quoted Israeli 
sources as saying that Gen. Jumper, chief of staff of 
the USAF, recently canceled a planned visit to Israel 
because he was unwilling to meet with Yaron.  Ha\'aretz 
quoted the sources as saying that the Pentagon 
instructed Jumper to refrain from meeting with Yaron, 
and when Israel refused to accept the boycott, the 
visit was canceled. 
 
All media reported that last night Sharon suspended 
coalition talks with the Labor Party, infuriated by 
comments made by Labor\'s chief negotiator, MK Dalia 
Itzik, that Sharon was \"groveling\" to get Labor in the 
government. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio reported that the State 
Department intends to declare Hizbullah\'s Al Manar-TV a 
terrorist organization today, because of the anti- 
Semitic contents of its programs. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that eleven families have recently 
moved into the northern Gaza Strip settlement of 
Nissanit with the assistance of the settlers\' movement 
Amana.  Jerusalem Post reported on a budding crisis at 
the Council of Jewish Settlements in the Territories as 
settler leaders said they were split over whether to 
call on the public to escalate the struggle against 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan. 
 
Ha\'aretz, Jerusalem Post and Globes quoted the High 
Court of Justice as saying Thursday that the government 
must \"thoroughly\" examine the problems raised by a law 
denying citizenship to Palestinians who marry Israelis. 
 
Leading media reported that Maj. Gen. (res.) Yaakov 
Amidror, a former deputy head of army intelligence, 
lambasted the disengagement plan at the Herzliya 
Conference Thursday, saying it would turn Gaza into a 
\"shelter for Al Qaida.\"  In a separate development, the 
media quoted National Union party leader and former 
cabinet minister Avigdor Lieberman as saying at the 
conference Thursday that he supports the transfer of 
some of Jerusalem\'s Arab neighborhoods and Israeli Arab 
communities in Wadi Ara (between Hadera and Afula) to 
Palestinian control, in conjunction with the 
establishment of a Palestinian state. 
 
Palestinian lawmaker Hanan Ashrawi was quoted as saying 
in an interview with Jerusalem Post that the 
Palestinians should have accepted the 1947 UN partition 
resolution. 
 
Visiting President of Harvard University Prof. Larry 
Summers was quoted as saying in an interview with 
Yediot that anti-Semitism has taken a new, anti-Israeli 
form. 
 
Hatzofe cited leading Internet service Ynet as saying 
that nuclear whistleblower Mordecai Vanunu has been 
elected rector of Glasgow University.  In the past, 
Benjamin Disraeli and Winnie Mandela had held this 
position. 
 
Hatzofe reported that former Ashkenazi chief rabbi 
Israel Meir Lau is expected to tell American Jews 
during his current visit to the U.S. that only in 
Israel will they be able to guarantee their Jewish 
identity. 
 
All media reported that Shinui MK Prof. Yehudit Naot, 
environment minister in 2003-2004, died of cancer 
Thursday.  Yediot reported that Erela Golan will 
succeed Naot in the Knesset. 
 
Ha\'aretz (English Ed.) reported that the chairman of 
Republicans Abroad in Israel, Kory Bardash, celebrated 
Hanukah with President Bush and the First Lady at a 
White House party last Thursday.  Bardash, who received 
an invitation for his work on behalf of the Bush 
election campaign earlier this year, registered more

                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Not One Single Settlement\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(December 17): \"The wall-to-wall support that Ariel 
Sharon has been enjoying recently is based on his 
decision to turn over a new leaf in the diplomatic 
arena.  This is not unconditional support.  The 
suspicions regarding Sharon still exist and have often 
been expressed on this page.  There is still the 
possibility that the disengagement from Gaza is nothing 
but a maneuver aimed at strengthening the Jewish 
settlements in the West Bank.  The recent silence of 
the settler leadership makes one wonder whether they 
have been given promises about which the public does 
not know.... The suspicion is that the government is 
trying to draw up a new map strewn with Jewish 
settlement points before the Americans come to the 
region to draw their own map of the settlements.  In 
addition to this, about 100 outposts that were slated 
to be evacuated long ago are thriving undisturbed.... 
any future investment in the development of settlements 
and their surroundings is unacceptable.  This must be 
the first and most important provision in the coalition 
agreement with the Labor Party.  Anyone who has been 
following the settlement project since its inception 
knows that most of it has come about using the method 
of promises are one thing, winks are another thing and 
construction is quite another, which is not unfamiliar 
to Sharon.  The time has come to put an end to this. 
The Jewish settlements are the main obstacle today to 
an agreement with the Palestinians.  To this historical 
injustice, not one further settlement should be added.\" 
 
II.  \"The PA\'s Non-Contest\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(December 17): \"It is widely hoped that the Palestinian 
Authority\'s general election next month will herald a 
new era, one that will contrast the decades that 
preceded it and be dominated by reason, freedom and 
prosperity.  Unfortunately, the facts offer little 
evidence that news of this transition has arrived where 
it was hoped to take place.... As events are in fact 
unfolding, we suspect that at the end of the day, 
Mahmoud Abbas will face the same predicament that 
Yasser Arafat did in his time, when his \"election\" 
meant a lot less to the extremists than their extremism 
meant to him.  Abbas apparently genuinely opposes the 
kind of violence espoused by Hamas and executed by 
Barghouti, even if his critique is tactical rather than 
moral.  Alas, not only is there no indication that he 
is actively going from village to village in order to 
share his vision with the people, and thus touch off a 
long-overdue re-education process; Abbas now appears 
reluctant to just face his opponents in a free and open 
election.  As if to shed further light on this setback 
to the Palestinian democratic process, PA lawmaker 
Hanan Ashrawi, in this issue [of The Jerusalem Post], 
tells [a reporter] that democracy is not a prerequisite 
for Palestinian independence.... We hope to be proven 
wrong the morning after next month\'s election, but 
prospects are high that, like Arafat before him, Abbas, 
too, will be intimidated by opponents who will enjoy 
the benefits of maximum authority and minimum 
responsibility.\"

-------------------------- 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv: \"Those who say that the Americans are 
now preventing Israel from talking with Assad are 
wrong, and deceiving too.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
\"The Americans Actually Encourage Talks\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (December 17): \"The more signs [of 
Syrian willingness to engage in talks with Israel] and 
emissaries are increasing, so is the belief that the 
survival of the Alawite regime is even more important 
to Bashar [Assad] than the Golan.  In other words, 
there may be an historic possibility that a peace deal 
could be made with Syria that would leave in Israel\'s 
hands strategic security assets in the Golan.... The 
Americans could have been enlisted for this purpose.... 
Those who say that the Americans are now preventing 
Israel from talking with Assad are wrong, and deceiving 
too.... Not only isn\'t the [U.S.] Administration not 
preventing Israel from doing so, but it is even 
encouraging her.  The President of Israel knows this, 
so does her Foreign Minister (he illustrated this in a 
courageous speech in Herzliya Wednesday), the Chief of 
Staff knows this -- all relevant people know this. 
Ariel Sharon does not have the will, or the capacity, 
or the energy to pursue two peace tracks 
simultaneously.  This is his right; this is a truth 
that can\'t be avoided.  This is his perception.  One 
should be aware of it -- for the coming generations or 
for upcoming commissions of investigation (after the 
next war).\"

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, IS, ECONOMY AND FINANCE 
SUBJECT: ISRAELI ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS IN THIRD QUARTER 
 
 
This cable is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please treat 
accordingly.  Not for Internet distribution. 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  Although the economy slowed in the third 
quarter, it will grow close to 4% for the year as a whole. 
The deficit is likely to come in under the targeted level of 
4% as a result of the GOI\'s lid on spending and a positive 
revenue picture.  The Bank of Israel (BOI) took advantage of 
a low-inflation environment to cut interest rates 0.2% in 
November, providing monetary policy support for continued 
economic expansion in 2005. 
 
2. (SBU) Growth has yet to result in a significant reduction 
in unemployment, which remains at 10.2% as of the third 
quarter.  The picture is unlikely to improve in  2005.  The 
poor unemployment numbers increased the political impact of 
the \"poverty report,\" issued annually in November by the 
National Insurance Institute, which claimed that almost 30% 
of all Israeli children live under the poverty line. 
 
3. (SBU) Economic stability has not been affected by Likud\'s 
ongoing efforts to form a coalition with Labor as well as 
with at least one religious party.  Within the context of the 
coalition negotiations, economic commentators believe Labor 
will use the poverty report to push for changes to the GOI\'s 
economic program, including possible delays in implementing 
the Bachar Committee\'s capital market reforms, approved by 
the Government on November 14.  Finance Ministry officials 
claim Labor\'s participation will have only a minimal impact 
on the budget, which is likely to be submitted quickly to the 
Knesset once the new coalition is in place.  Although the GOI 
continues to move towards Gaza disengagement, it has yet to 
finalize budgetary numbers.  End Summary 
 
-------------------------- 
Third Quarter Growth Slows 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Although the Israeli economy continued to expand in 
the third quarter, it did so at a significantly slower pace 
than earlier in the year.  This was due to a contraction in 
personal consumption, the port strike of July-August, which 
restricted both imports and exports; and a decline in 
international demand for Israeli exports. 
 
5. (U) According to initial Central Bureau of Statistics 
figures based on partial statistics, the economy grew by 3.7% 
on an annualized basis in the third quarter, following 
annualized growth of 4.3% in each of the first two quarters. 
Private consumption expenditure, which had been showing signs 
of improvement earlier in the year, also contracted; in 
particular, consumption of durable goods per capita declined 
by 20% in the third quarter, following growth of 10.5% in the 
second quarter of 2004.  Per capita private consumption 
declined by 1.8% in the third quarter, compared with an 
increase of 1.1% in the second quarter of 2004, and increases 
of 2.3% both in the first quarter of 2004 and the fourth 
quarter of 2003. 
 
6. (U) Business sector GDP growth moderated to 3% in the 
third quarter from 6% in the second quarter.  The third 
quarter was the first quarter since the third quarter of 2003 
in which business sector GDP was lower than GDP.   The slower 
growth in the business sector reflects the significant 
reduction in export growth from 23% in the first quarter, to 
13% in the second quarter, and 4.2% in the third quarter. 
The lower export figures are due in large part to the port 
strikes during July and August.  Imports of goods, also 
negatively affected by the port strike, grew by just 1.8% in 
the third quarter, compared with 12% in the second quarter 
and 24% in the first quarter.  The main indication of 
investment, fixed capital formation, declined by 14.3% in the 
third quarter, compared with a decline of 3.2% in the 
previous quarter. 
 
------------------------------------ 
CBS: Overall 2004 Growth Close to 4% 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (SBU) On October 18, the Central Bureau of Statistics 
reported that their preliminary growth estimates indicated 
that growth would be 4% in 2004.   A CBS contact told us this 
view obtained in spite of the decline in most major 
components in the third quarter.   He cited positive trend 
data, which indicated an increase in imports of raw 
materials, durable goods and consumer durables in October. 
Industrial production also showed a positive trend in each of 
the last three months. 
 
------------------------- 
2004 Deficit Below Target 
------------------------- 
 
8. (U) GOI and other private forecasts indicate that the 2004 
deficit will be in the 3% to 3.5% range.  The cumulative 
deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 totaled NIS 11.4 
billion, which is only 55% of the NIS 20.6 billion deficit 
target for the entire year.  By comparison, the deficit for 
the first 11 months of 2003 stood at NIS 21.2 bio.  A Bank 
Leumi economist told us that in his estimation the deficit 
will be somewhere between 3% to 3.5% for the year, as the 
government is likely to increase expenditures in December. 
The reduction in the deficit to less than 3.5% from a deficit 
of 5.6% of GDP is primarily a result of the GOI,s success in 
curbing expenditures, as evidenced by cumulative expenditures 
for 11 months of NIS 175 bio, or NIS 46 billion less than the 
expenditure target of NIS 221 billion.  Although there has 
been a slowing down in tax revenues in recent months, the GOI 
is likely to meet the tax target of the 2004 budget. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
BOI Reduces Rates by  0.2% in November 
-------------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) On November 22, the Bank of Israel announced a 0.2% 
interest rate reduction to 3.9% from 4.1%.  This was the 
first change in interest in seven months, since the BOI 
reduced rates by 0.2% at the end of March.  In its press 
release, the BOI indicated that the reduction was based on 
the very low level of inflation in the past few months, as 
well as the assessment that inflation will be within the 
range of price stability (current inflation rate for the year 
is 1.2%).   The Central Bank also cites the slower economic 
recovery and weaker dollar as reasons for lowering interest 
rates without concern that it would cause economic or 
financial instability. 
 
------------------------------- 
Unemployment High but Declining 
------------------------------- 
 
10. (U) The Central Bureau of Statistics reported on November 
24 that unemployment declined to 10.2% in the third quarter 
of 2004, from 10.5% in the second quarter.  There was an 
increase of 3.3% in the number of employed persons in the 
first 9 months of 2004 compared with the comparable period in 
2003, representing an increase of 76,000 people.  After the 
release of the unemployment data, Finance Minister Netanyahu 
expressed satisfaction with the consistent and continuous 
decline in unemployment during the last year, and said that 
this supported the efficacy of the government,s economic 
policies. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Poverty Report Sparks Discussion on Bibinomics 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
11. (U) The publication of Bituach Leumi,s (National 
Insurance Institute) &poverty report8 in November led to an 
intensification of Israel,s debate over combating poverty. 
Finance Ministry officials believe in using a range of 
economic incentives, including the reduction of transfer 
payments, to induce more people to enter the workforce. 
Other observers, including the Bank of Israel and Bituach 
Leumi (BL), believe the GOI has reduced government support to 
the poor and unemployed too far too fast, thereby 
unnecessarily increasing poverty levels. 
 
12. (SBU) The report indicates that there was an 8% increase 
in the number of people living in poverty to more than 1.4 
million people in 2003, an increase of more than 100 thousand 
compared with 1.3 million in 2002.  The 2003 statistics 
indicated that 29.4% of children and 19% of families were 
living below the poverty level, even after receipt of 
transfer payments.  In view of the proposed inclusion of the 
Labor party in the Government, it is likely that the poverty 
report and its findings will remain an important part of the 
economic debate in 2005. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Bachar Capital Market Reforms Move Forward 
------------------------------------------ 
 
13. (SBU) The Bachar capital market reform recommendations, 
which are intended to increase competition in the very 
centralized and concentrated banking sector, were approved by 
the Government on November 14.  The main aspects of the 
reforms include removing Provident funds (private retirement 
funds) and mutual funds from the banks, ownership and 
management over the next few years.  In return, the banks 
will be able to enter the insurance market, and sell life 
insurance.  The banking community has strong reservations 
about the reforms and is seeking to delay their 
implementation. 
 
14. (SBU) Debate over the Bachar reforms is taking place 
against the background of increased &bank bashing8 
resulting from perceptions these institutions have taken 
advantage of their strong position to leverage outsized 
customer fees.  The reforms have also become something of a 
bargaining chip in coalition talks between the various 
parties.  As one Central Bank official told us, it is 
impossible to predict whether the Bachar recommendations will 
have a fate any more successful than other (unimplemented) 
financial reform plans introduced over the past twenty years. 
 She nonetheless finds them appropriate and necessary for 
reforming a hidebound financial services sector. 
 
------------------ 
Gaza Disengagement 
------------------ 
 
15. (SBU) A range of GOI officials have told us that PM 
Sharon is committed to implementing his Gaza Disengagement 
plan on time ) at the latest.  Fast-paced legislative 
movement reflects this commitment.  On November 3, the 
Knesset approved the first reading of the Disengagement 
legislation.   On November 15 the Knesset Finance Committee 
approved the transfer of NIS 35 million for the Disengagement 
Plan:  NIS 30 million for prepayment of compensation to 
Settlers who agree to leave their homes, and NIS 5 million 
for the cost of the Justice Ministry to prepare Compensation 
) Evacuation legislation.   On November 16 the Disengagement 
Administration officially commenced its operations, with the 
inauguration of its website including information and forms 
regarding compensation calculations and maps showing 
re-settlement possibilities. 
 
16. (SBU) The Israeli media estimates disengagement will cost 
more than NIS 5 billion (USD 1.1 billion).  The Finance 
Ministry plans to apportion payment over two years in the 
2005/2006 Budgets.   For 2005, the MOF has proposed 
accommodating disengagement-related spending by raising the 
deficit target to 3.4% from the original 3%, as well as by 
increasing real expenditure growth above the 1% target.  As 
these targets form a core element of Loan Guarantee Agreement 
economic conditionality, the MOF has requested USG views on 
the changes.  Although the Israeli press has reported the GOI 
will request U.S. assistance to pay for at least a part of 
disengagement, no formal request has been made to date. 
 
------------------------------------ 
The 2005 Budget ) Temporarily Tabled 
------------------------------------ 
 
17. (U) The GOI will likely begin 2005 without a new budget. 
Although PM Sharon had waited a number of months to submit 
the budget in the hope of finding the necessary votes, he 
finally decided that the cost of losing was less than not 
forcing a decision.  In the end, only Sharon,s own Likud 
party and United Torah Judaism supported the NIS 264.5 
billion (approximately USD 60 billion) bill in its first 
reading on December 1.  Sharon fired ministers from the 
Shinui party who voted against the budget, an action which 
reduced his coalition to a party of one and set the stage for 
ongoing coalition negotiations with the opposition Labor 
party, United Torah Judaism and Shas.  Sharon has threatened 
to call early elections if he cannot build a coalition with 
Labor. 
 
18. (SBU) According to contacts at the Ministry of Finance, 
Labor will make a big show of obtaining changes to the 2005 
budget once it is in the coalition.  In reality, these 
changes will probably center on a fairly modest increase in 
transfer payments to the elderly, which can be accommodated 
within the budgetary framework.  Even if Labor achieves more 
significant budgetary changes, these will be paid for out of 
across-the-board reductions in ministerial budgets, not 
through additional spending, according to our Finance 
Ministry contacts.  The result: a 2005 deficit that should 
not exceed 3.4% of GDP (disengagement expenses included). 
 
19. (U) Assuming the budget does not pass before the end of 
the year, the Government will begin operating on a monthly 
appropriations based, per line item, on the lower of either 
the 2004 actual or 2005 proposed budgets.  In accordance with 
Israeli law, if the Budget is not passed by March 31, 2005, 
the Government would fall, and new elections would be called 
in 90 days.

This is a joint Embassy Tel Aviv - Consulate General 
Jerusalem message. 
 
1. (C) Summary:  GOI Environment Ministry officials hope that 
the USG and/or UNEP can help them reengage with their 
Palestinian counterparts to address pressing environmental 
issues.  MoE provided a list of action items they consider 
the most feasible from a longer list of UNEP Desk Study 
recommendations.  UNEP is working to reactivate earlier 
Israeli-Palestinian environmental consultations.  Embassy and 
Consulate General will encourage the parties to meet 
following the January 9 Palestinian presidential election. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Ministry of Environment Director General Miki Haran 
told visiting NEA Senior S&T Advisor Charles Lawson in a 
meeting at MoE on December 6 that her ministry wants to 
reengage with its Palestinian counterparts.  MoE subsequently 
provided ESTH Officer with its updated list of \"low-hanging 
fruit,\" a subset of the recommendations of the UN Environment 
Programme Desk Study on the Environment in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territories.  The list represents the Desk Study 
recommendations MoE considers most feasible.  The document 
MoE provided highlighted in bold letters the recommendation 
to reactivate the Joint Environmental Experts Committee 
established by the Oslo agreements.  MoE\'s list follows at 
end of this message.  Haran said she hoped USG and/or UNEP 
could help facilitate meetings and a dialogue on 
environmental issues. 
 
3. (C) UNEP Post-Conflict Assessment Unit Project Coordinator 
Aniket Ghai visited Embassy December 14 and told ESTH Officer 
that he and UNEP Executor Director Klaus Toepfer met in Cairo 
the previous week with Palestinian Environmental Quality 
Authority head Abu Safiyeh to discuss progress under the Desk 
Study.  Ghai said Abu Safiyeh was pleased with the UNEP 
process and wanted to see it continue.  Abu Safiyeh said he 
did not object to meeting with his Israeli counterparts, \"but 
the time has to be right.\" 
 
4. (C) Comment:  Both Israelis and Palestinians have suffered 
from a dearth of dialogue and cooperation on environmental 
issues.  UNEP is urging both sides to resume consultations on 
environmental issues.  Embassy and Consulate General will 
also work to bring both sides together following the January 
9 election, preferably at the ministerial level initially, 
but at the technical level if that is not possible in the 
short term.  Septel will report on the Israeli MoE\'s internal 
deliberations on environmental issues related to Gaza 
disengagement.  End comment. 
 
5. (C) The GOI MoE updated list of most readily achievable

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
On Sunday, Yediot led with an \"exclusive\" filed by its 
Washington correspondent, Orly Azolai, after a brief 
conversation she held with President George Bush at the 
White House Christmas party last Thursday.  Azolai 
quoted Bush as saying he was determined to bring peace 
between Israel and the Palestinians, but that Syria 
would have to wait.  Azolai was impressed that Bush 
intends to place his full weight behind the effort to 
achieve an Israeli-Palestinian peace in the next four 
years and to take a hands-on approach. 
 
On Sunday, Yediot reported that President Bush told 
Jewish leaders at a White House Hanukkah reception that 
he is very worried about the resurgence of anti- 
Semitism in Europe. 
 
On Monday, all major Hebrew-language media led with 
calls by Pinchas Wallerstein, the head of the Mateh 
Binyamin local council in the West Bank and one of the 
senior members of the Council of Jewish Settlements in 
the Territories, to engage in nonviolent civil 
disobedience in an effort to foil the evacuation of 
settlements in Gaza.  Charging that the soon-to-be- 
established government is \"illegitimate,\" Wallerstein 
declared that the public should \"violate the transfer 
law and be ready to pay the price of mass 
imprisonment.\"  Wallerstein himself stated he was 
prepared to go to jail.  Israel Radio cited Acting 
Justice Minister Tzipi Livni\'s condemnation of the 
remarks, and reported that A-G Menachem Mazuz will 
examine the issue in the next few days.  The radio 
reported that not all members of the Council of 
Settlements agree with the style of Wallerstein\'s 
remarks.  Reporting that PM Sharon voiced criticism of 
Wallerstein\'s comments, Israel Radio quoted Sharon as 
saying that the government will do all its power to 
keep the law. 
 
All media reported that the Likud-Labor agreement 
reached Saturday night hit a stumbling block Sunday 
after the chairman of the Knesset\'s Constitution, Law 
and Justice Committee, Likud MK Michael Eitan, refuse 
to rush through legislation to accommodate the deal 
according to which Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres is 
to become the second deputy PM who is authorized to 
function as acting PM when the PM is away or 
incapacitated, along with Trade Minister Ehud Olmert, 
who already holds the title. The Basic Law only 
provides for one deputy PM.  On Sunday, leading media 
reported that Labor would control five ministries: 
interior, national infrastructure, construction and 
housing, tourism, and communications, and would also 
get three ministers without portfolios. 
 
FM Silvan Shalom was quoted as saying Sunday in an 
interview with Jerusalem Post that the security fence 
is not Israel\'s final border, and that settlers on the 
\"other side\" of the barrier should not fear they will 
necessarily be moved.  Shalom was responding to a 
question about remarks allegedly made by Elliott 
Abrams, Special Assistant to the President and Senior 
Director of the National Security Council for Near East 
and North African Affairs, that eventually all the 
settlements beyond the fence will be dismantled. 
Shalom was quoted as saying that the U.S. has never 
accepted the idea of settlements in the territories, 
and that the settlers went to live in those areas 
\"knowing that the Israeli government took the decision 
to settle them there, not because the Americans gave 
any approval.\"  Shalom did not rule out the possibility 
that settlers in places such as Beit El could be moved 
\"in 40 or 50 years.\" 
 
Over the weekend, leading media reported that 11 
Palestinians were killed during the raid in Khan Yunis. 
All media reported that three Qassam rockets were fired 
at Sderot Sunday, lightly injuring three people. 
Eleven rocket attacks took place against the city and 
its surroundings over the weekend.  Leading media 
quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz and IDF sources as 
saying that if the firing continues, Israel will resume 
its offensive in the northern Gaza Strip.  Hatzofe 
quoted a senior Israeli military source as saying that 
the IDF is unable carry out a military operation like 
the 2002 Operation Defensive Shield, because of lack of 
funds. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Egypt\'s intelligence chief Omar 
Suleiman is scheduled to come to Israel on Tuesday to 
finalize discussions regarding the deployment of 
Egyptian troops along the Philadelphi Route.  Leading 
media reported that Sunday a special ministerial 
committee approved the release of 170 Palestinian 
prisoners in what PM Sharon described as a \"good will 
gesture\" to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak following 
the freeing of Azzam Azzam two weeks ago. 
 
Israel Radio reported on a new Israel-PA meeting to 
coordinate positions ahead of the January elections: 
Sharon advisers Dov Weisglass and Shalom Turjeman met 
last night with senior PA officials Saeb Erekat and 
Hassan Abu Libdeh.  The sides agreed that there will be 
a new meeting this week to recap Israel\'s assistance in 
the Palestinian elections, and that voting in East 
Jerusalem will take place in the same way as in 1996: 
polling booths will be set up in five post offices. 
 
On Sunday, Jerusalem Post quoted PLO Chairman Mahmoud 
Abbas (Abu Mazen) as saying Saturday in Oman that the 
Palestinians would make no concessions on the right of 
return. 
On Sunday, Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post quoted deputy A- 
G for international law Shavit Matias as saying 
Saturday that the Justice Ministry believes that if 
Israel withdraws from the Philadelphi Route, an 
international legal consensus will be established, 
according to which the Israeli occupation of the Gaza 
Strip would have ended and Israel would no longer be 
responsible, as an occupying power, for events in the 
Strip.  Jerusalem Post quoted a \"senior international 
source\" as saying Sunday that the PA would like Israel 
to tear down all houses in the settlements of Gush 
Katif in the Gaza Strip before the area is handed over 
to the Palestinians.  The newspaper reported that a PA 
minister immediately confirmed this. 
 
On Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that four House 
Democrats -- Robert Wexler (FL), Robert Menendez (NJ), 
and Eliot Engel and Gary Ackerman of New York -- sent a 
letter to President Bush on Thursday urging him to 
provide them \"with information that will clarify the 
circumstances\" surrounding the FBI\'s investigation into 
AIPAC. 
 
Leading media reported that the Iranian intelligence 
services issued a vague statement Sunday indicated that 
they have uncovered a spy ring of eight people 
suspected of collecting intelligence information for 
Israel.  Jerusalem Post cited the Prime Minister\'s 
Office\'s response that Iran\'s claim is \"ridiculous.\" 
 
On Sunday, Jerusalem Post quoted a senior USG official 
as saying: \"It is clear we are heading into some kind 
of confrontation with Syria unless the Syrians reverse 
their position.\"  The newspaper reported that the U.S., 
which is angry at Damascus for sheltering members of 
active opponents to the Iraqi regime, is contemplating 
a range of punitive measures to use against Syria. 
 
On Sunday, leading media reported that Ukrainian 
presidential contender Viktor Yushchenko, who was 
poisoned with dioxin, is considering getting medical 
treatment in Israel. 
 
On Sunday, leading media reported that a document filed 
Friday by the Justice Department and the Department of 
Homeland Security seeks John Demjanjuk\'s deportation 
for his participation in Nazi-sponsored persecution 
while serving as an armed SS guard and because he lied 
about his wartime job and residences when he applied 
for an immigration visa in 1952. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted PA officials as saying on Sunday 
that Israel is allowing candidates in the elections to 
travel freely in the territories.  Ha\'aretz quoted a 
senior Hamas leader in the West Bank city of Dahariyeh 
as saying that the arrest by the Shin Bet of four Hamas 
candidates in the upcoming municipal elections in his 
town is a \"political targeted killing.\" 
 
On Sunday, Yediot quoted Peres as saying in an 
interview with the French daily Le Figaro that the 
seaport and airport of Gaza should be reopened. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that terrorist attacks and pressure 
by the government of Thailand has led to an exodus of 
Thai workers from Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip, and 
that farmers there are said to fear a collapse of their 
farmers.  Thailand\'s Labor Minister Uraiwan Thienthong 
and the Thai Ambassador to Israel met on Saturday with 
around 150 Thai workers in Gush Katif and asked them to 
leave the area as soon as possible. 
 
Yediot cited Interior Ministry data according to which 
local councils in the territories received in 2003 four 
times the amount of government allocations granted to 
local councils in poor \"development towns.\" 
 
Yediot reported that Deputy Speaker of the Knesset 
Likud MK Moshe Kahlon met Sunday in Rome with a senior 
Libyan official. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that during a 
visit to Israel Sunday, 1976 Nobel Peace Prize laureate 
Mairead Corrigan Maguire compared Israel\'s reported 
nuclear arsenal to Hitler\'s gas chambers, while calling 
for travel restriction to be lifted on nuclear 
whistleblower Mordecai Vanunu. 
 
Maariv cited an internal Immigrant Absorption Ministry 
report whose data cover the years 1989-2003, which says 
that 22.9 percent of immigrants from the U.S. left 
Israel during that period.  During that period, 8.8 
percent of all immigrants dropped out.  Only 7.6 
percent of immigrants from the CIS left Israel. 
 
On Sunday, Maariv cited a survey conducted among 
Israeli youth aged 15-18 and 21-24: 
-51 percent said Israeli Arabs should be prevented from 
being elected in the Knesset. 
-67 percent stated: \"The Arabs would have annihilated 
Israel if they only could.\" 
-33 percent believe that democracy should be 
significantly restricted, in case of even a minor 
threat to the state\'s security.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"The President Is Determined\" 
 
Washington correspondent Orly Azolai wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (December 19): 
\"Bush is serious.  This time he isn\'t merely talking; 
he really intends to produce an agreement that will 
have his name on it.... Bush\'s body language in the 
conversation I had with him at the traditional 
Christmas party indicated that this time he means to 
remove the obstacles with his own two hands.  He is 
truly confident that now that Arafat has been removed 
peace is within reach.... The President has not yet 
decided on a timetable, but the general direction of 
things is clear: first Israel and the Palestinians, 
while Syria will be dealt with only at a later 
stage.... Bush will be sworn in for his second term in 
office on January 20.  Shortly thereafter both Sharon 
and Abu Mazen will hear from him.  The President, who 
described himself as a wartime president in his first 
term in office, wants his second term to go down as one 
in which peace was achieved.  The fact that the war in 
Iraq has become bogged down and exacts more and more 
American casualties with every passing day has only 
intensified his determination to achieve peace in the 
Middle East.  That is why he is going to let Sharon 
begin to implement the disengagement plan, will let the 
Palestinians elect their new leadership, and then he is 
going to take the reins into his own hands and will try 
to show the world what the lord of the manor is capable 
of doing when he so desires.\" 
 
II.  \"Acting Within New Constraints\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(December 20): \"Israel, which wanted a different 
Palestinian leadership -- something that, according to 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, is likely to turn 2005 
into a year of great opportunity -- now finds itself in 
a dilemma.  On one hand, no government can sit on its 
hands when its towns are attacked by rockets; Israel 
cannot abandon the towns of the western Negev to their 
fate.  Yet on the other hand, a massive operation 
against the Palestinians is liable to dissipate the 
atmosphere of good will that has begun to develop and 
is necessary to ensure that the historic opportunity 
comes to pass.  Therefore, the government and the IDF 
must act within these new constraints.... Right now, 
while Palestinian leaders are trying to convince their 
public to stop the armed Intifada, Israel must be 
careful not to play into the hands of opponents of this 
policy.  Instead, it must help the PA to draw a line 
between adherents of the diplomatic process and those 
who want to continue fueling the flames.  Without this 
crucial distinction, Israel will not be able to reach 
the desired goal: for the disengagement plan to cease 
to be a unilateral Israeli measure and for it to bring 
additional agreements in its wake.\" 
 
III.  \"Don\'t Play the Patron\" 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar\'el wrote in 
Ha\'aretz (December 19): \"The official assessment [in 
Egypt] is that the trade agreement, once it reaches 
maturity in three or four years -- that is, after the 
establishment of the factories and the creation of the 
marketing network in the United States -- will create 
\'only\' 100,000 new jobs a year.  That, too, is a 
tremendous gain in a country that \'creates\' tens of 
thousands of fictitious jobs every year in the 
governmental system and is not succeeding in 
implementing its privatization plan.  Egypt is not the 
only [Middle Eastern] country that is need of a mass 
production of jobs.... Economic needs in the region, 
which will become increasingly more acute, may impose 
the creation of an atmosphere that promotes trade.... 
It is possible that the trade agreement with Egypt is 
the first signal of this new trend, in which economic 
interests overcome sentimentalism and the settling of 
accounts with the past.  The trend of \'self- 
normalization,\' even if under constraint, is beginning 
to do a calculation of real profit and loss instead of 
examining the prestige index.  If this is, indeed, the 
trend, it is good news for Israel, provided it doesn\'t 
make everyone angry by trying to play the patron 
again.\" 
 
IV.  \"Enlightened But Exasperating Europe\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in Ha\'aretz 
(December 20): \"Fortunately, since [the Yom Kippur War] 
Israel has not been dependent on European generosity. 
And the crude self-interest of 1973 has been replaced 
by a policy of preaching morality.... It is 
exasperating to hear European foreign ministers talking 
about \'Israel\'s right to exist\' as if it were being put 
to the test.  Who\'s asking them?  Will an Israeli 
foreign minister ever talk about France or Germany\'s 
\'right to exist\'?  Are the Europeans talking like this 
in Damascus and in Cairo as well?  The Europeans\' votes 
in the United Nations are masterpieces of diplomatic 
cowardice, as is the European support for self-defense 
against terror while condemning the means Israel has 
used against it.  And let us not forget the 
contemptible statement about \'the way in which the 
right of return could be realized,\' which the European 
Union published in response to U.S. President George W. 
Bush\'s letter to Ariel Sharon, which recognized the 
Jewish settlement blocs in the territories.... The 
European dislike of the use of force is not a 
sanctified value.  Inherent in it is the danger of 
resignation to a determined aggressor like the 
leadership of Iran.  There must be no hasty bombardment 
of the Iranian installations, but giving up the 
military stick a priori weakens Fischer\'s diplomacy, 
and ultimately it will leave Israel alone facing the 
Iranian warheads. The main thing is that it will be in 
accordance with international law and UN resolutions.\" 
 
V.  \"A Peace Promo in Arabic\" 
 
Publicist Benny Cohen wrote in popular, pluralist 
Maariv (December 19): \"The \'Geneva Initiative\' is 
currently screening a television campaign that includes 
promos on which \'partners\' for peace are being 
presented.  Palestinian figures address the Israeli 
public, who declare that \'there is a partner\' for 
peace.  The ads aimed at the Palestinian public convey 
a similar message.... The campaign\'s key importance 
lies in its very appearance on the screens of all Arab 
TV networks.  This is a significant novelty to which 
attention must be given.  The campaign producers must 
emphasize it.... In addition to the Palestinian TV 
channels, the campaign will also be broadcasted on the 
Arab TV station Al-Arabiya.  One shouldn\'t ignore the 
fact that Arab televisions are allowing themselves to 
broadcast \'propaganda\' for peace with Israel -- even if 
those are paid ads.  The very fact that those TVs 
literally put themselves at risk by broadcasting this 
message, shows that there is change.  Until recently it 
had been obvious to Israel and to those broadcasters 
that it was dangerous to get near \'propaganda\' that was 
considered pro-Zionist.\"

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KWBG, ECON, IS, SETTLEMENTS, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS, GOI INTERNAL 
SUBJECT: TZIPI LIVNI: NO NEW HOUSING TENDERS IN SETTLEMENTS 
WHILE SHE IS HOUSING MINISTER 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: In her first meeting with the Ambassador as 
acting Minister of Justice December 16, Likud MK Tzipi Livni 
stressed that she will not approve any new housing tenders in 
the settlements while serving as Housing Minister.  Livni 
said she would be ready to discuss problems related to land 
expropriation and illegal housing construction in the 
Israeli-Arab sector.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Labor has Turned \"Greedy\" 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Tzipi Livni told the Ambassador December 16 (before 
Likud and Labor struck a coalition deal) that she wants to 
remain Minister of Justice, a position she has held in an 
acting capacity since Sharon\'s December 1 dismissal of former 
Justice Minister Tommy Lapid.  Commenting on the ongoing 
portfolio haggling between Likud and Labor in the course of 
their coalition negotiations, Livni confided her view that 
Likud started the talks with Labor from an \"unfair\" position 
since Likud had \"fenced off\" from Labor most of the major 
portfolios, including the \"big three\" -- Defense, Foreign 
Affairs, and Finance.  Livni complained that, after Likud 
conceded several more ministries to Labor, including 
Interior, Labor had become \"more greedy.\"  Livni also 
complained about the influence of Likud operative Uzi Cohen 
on the Likud negotiating team, charging that he is \"carping\" 
from the sidelines, advising Likud not to give Labor anything. 
 
3.  (C) Livni said that the religious Shas Party concluded a 
day or two earlier that it could not now join a 
pro-disengagement coalition only six weeks after its 
spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, determined that Shas 
could not support disengagement.  If Shas perceives Sharon 
has formed a stable coalition that could last through 
December 2006, however, Shas might join at a later date, 
Livni added. 
 
---------------------- 
No New Housing Tenders 
---------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Speaking in her capacity as Housing Minister, Livni 
said she had followed a policy of not approving new tenders 
for additional housing units in the territories since 
assuming the portfolio July 4.  She said that, for 
bureaucratic and legal reasons, she was allowing tenders 
approved prior to her assumption of the ministry to go 
forward.  She has also cut NIS 30 million out of the 
Ministry\'s budget that was programmed for new settlement 
housing construction.  On the issue of the Nof Hasharon 
settlement being built west of Alfei Menashe but connected to 
the infrastructure of Nirit, a town within the Green Line, 
Livni said the issue was purely in the legal realm and was 
being handled by the courts because Nof Hasharon is being 
established entirely by private developers.  She opined, 
however, that the residents of Nirit who have filed a 
petition in the High Court against the construction may have 
filed later than they should have because there is already 
infrastructure on the ground which courts may be loathe to 
take down. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
On Building Demolitions in Israeli-Arab Sector 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5.  (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s query, Livni said she 
had not heard about the demolition by Israeli police of 
several buildings under construction in the Israeli-Arab 
northern village of Deir al-Assad December 15, which resulted 
in a skirmish between village residents and police.  Livni 
said that she had been involved in addressing land issues 
affecting the Bedouin when she served as 
Minister-Without-Portfolio in the 15th Knesset.  Although she 
believed that discrimination had been a cause of the 
differential in housing quality between Israeli Jews and 
Arabs, she had come to believe that the problem now was more 
a result of different worldviews.  Whereas Israeli Jews 
would, when confronted with housing code violations, argue 
strenuously against coming into conformity with those 
standards, in the end they would do so.  Israeli Arabs, 
particularly the Bedouin, Livni asserted, simply did not 
accept the concept that the state had any authority over what 
they viewed as Arab land and Arab housing.  This resulted in 
poorer quality dwellings, which were frequently not built to 
code or built illegally. 
 
------ 
On IPR 
------ 
 
6. (C) Livni said she expected that, should she remain 
Minister of Justice, one of the most difficult issues with 
which she would have to deal would be Intellectual Property 
Rights (IPR).  She admitted that she was not up to speed on 
IPR and would have to invest significant time in 
understanding the complex issues involved. 
 
------------------ 
Biographical Notes 
------------------ 
7.  (SBU) Tzipi Livni was born in 1958 in Israel and has a 
law degree from Bar Ilan University.  She was a member of the 
15th and now, the 16th Knesset.  During the 15th Knesset, she 
served as Minister of Regional Cooperation and 
Minister-without-Portfolio, and as a member of the Knesset 
Committees on Constitution, Law and Justice, and the Status 
of Women.  She currently serves as Minister of Immigration 
and Absorption, Minister of Housing and as Acting Minister of 
Justice.  She speaks English and French.  Livni is married 
with two children.

along the Egyptian-Rafah border were rescued alive after 
having been trapped for more than 12 hours.  Palestinian 
militants fired a total of 13 Qassam rockets at Israeli and 
Israeli settler towns and villages December 17-19.  Two, 
possibly three, Israelis were lightly wounded by the rockets.

ASSESSMENTS OF PALESTINIAN FUTURE TO CODEL TALENT 
 
Classified By: Pol/C Norm Olsen for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told 
CODEL Talent December 6 that the new Palestinian leadership 
must show serious intent to fight terror and corruption 
before receiving any \"gifts\" from the U.S. or Israel. 
Netanyahu said that the GOI should simply \"walk out of the 
Gaza Strip and leave the place to whatever bad Palestinian 
government fills the vacuum,\" and he identified corruption 
\"so endemic that it chokes everything,\" rather than GOI 
closure policy, as the primary negative factor affecting the 
Palestinian economy.  Labor leader Shimon Peres was more 
upbeat in a separate meeting with CODEL December 6, saying 
that while he would defer \"for a few years\" any discussion 
with the Palestinians of the status of Jerusalem or refugee 
return, he saw no reason why serious discussion on border 
issues could not commence much sooner.  Peres called the 
Palestinians \"the most democratically developed Arabs,\" and 
advised donors to press the Palestinians to codify the 
separation of powers in a constitution as soon as possible to 
boost donor confidence that money donated would be well 
spent.  Peres said that bringing the security services under 
control is the biggest challenge currently facing the PA, and 
lamented the fact that they had become so politicized under 
Arafat.  Neither Peres nor Netanyahu would assign a specific 
dollar amount to the costs associated with the GOI\'s 
disengagement plan, with Peres demurring, he said, because 
the cost is so high that everyone is reluctant to discuss it. 
 End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Senator James Talent, accompanied by Military 
Legislative Assistant Lindsey Neas, Legislative Fellow Lore 
Aguayo, and Navy Senate Liaison Deputy Director Cpt. James 
Stein, met separately with Minister of Finance Binyamin 
Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Shimon Peres December 6. 
Poloff (notetaker) accompanied. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Squeeze the Palestinians, Cautious but Tough with the Saudis 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
3.  (C) Minister of Finance Binyamin Netanyahu told CODEL 
Talent December 6 that Arafat\'s death might open up 
possibilities with the Palestinians that absolutely did not 
exist while Arafat was alive.  Calling Arafat the embodiment 
of the pan-Islamists and the pan-Arabists, Netanyahu said 
that even Shaykh Yassin (the spiritual leader of Hamas, 
killed by an IAF missile strike in April 2004 in Gaza City) 
\"kowtowed to Arafat,\" accepting what Netanyahu called 
Arafat\'s \"dual hats.\"  Netanyahu said that the Oslo Accords 
had \"empowered Arafat the dictator,\" providing him money, 
weapons, and prestige, with only the hope that he would push 
the Palestinian people towards peace in return.  The 
international community, Netanyahu continued, woke up 10 
years later and realized that the opposite had occurred, and 
Palestinian frustration with Arafat had been re-directed into 
increased hatred of Israel. 
 
4.  (C) Netanyahu said that if the new Palestinian leadership 
wants anything from either the U.S. or Israel, then they must 
first show some serious intent to take action against 
terrorism and corruption.  \"Squeeze them,\" Netanyahu said, 
\"and just maybe you will get some sort of result.\"  If Israel 
is wise, it will simply \"walk out of the Gaza Strip and leave 
the place to whatever bad Palestinian government fills the 
vacuum.\"  Radical Islam threatens not only the West, 
Netanyahu said, but Islam itself.  In response to Senator 
Talent\'s question, Netanyahu said he does not believe that 
Saudi Arabia is \"waking up.\"  On the contrary, Netanyahu 
called Saudi Arabia a furnace that is breeding more radical 
elements and spreading them all over the world.  While he 
applauded the U.S. for taking on what he called the worst of 
regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq, Netanyahu advised caution in 
Saudi Arabia, fearing that any subsequent regime there could 
well be worse for U.S. and Israeli interests than the one 
currently in power. 
 
----------------------- 
\"Feeding the Crocodile\" 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (C) On Iran, Netanyahu said that it is absolutely vital 
that Iran be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. 
Should they acquire a nuclear arsenal, Netanyahu predicted 
that Israel would feel it immediately, even if indirectly, as 
Hizballah would have an even stronger umbrella under which to 
hide.  Asked about the European negotiations with Iran on 
Iran\'s nuclear enrichment program, Netanyahu was extremely 
skeptical, noting that Europe tends toward accommodation 
rather than confrontation.  Each European regime, Netanyahu 
said, is trying to \"feed the crocodile,\" casting off elements 
such as support for Israel or a tough stance against radical 
Islam in the hope of appeasing the very people they should be 
opposing. 
 
----------------------------- 
It\'s Corruption, Not Closures 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Netanyahu said that Palestinian labor markets are 
completely dependent on Israel, a circumstance that has a 
major negative impact on the Palestinian economy, now that 
labor movements have been all but curtailed.  He blamed 
corruption \"so endemic that it chokes everything,\" however, 
as the primary factor affecting the Palestinian economy. 
Calling Palestinian society tribal by nature, Netanyahu said 
enforcement of legal norms and the right to property are 
essential missing elements.  When asked what the U.S. could 
do to further reforms in the Palestinian areas and in the 
Arab world as a whole, Netanyahu said, first, continue to 
promote President Bush\'s agenda of zero tolerance for 
terrorism and for bringing democracy to the Middle East. 
Second, dismantle (unspecified) regimes that are hopeless 
cases for reform.  Third, continue to fight the battle for 
hearts and minds of the people in the region. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Peres: Palestinians Need to De-Politicize the Armed Forces 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
7.  (C) In a separate meeting December 6, Labor Party leader 
Shimon Peres was guardedly positive regarding developments 
with the Palestinians, saying that, while he would not 
negotiate with them per se, he would \"begin a dialogue.\" 
Major issues, Peres continued, such as refugee return and the 
status of Jerusalem, will have to wait for four or five 
years, because neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis are 
in a position to compromise now.  That being said, Peres was 
confident that a solution to border issues could be worked 
out.  Calling the Palestinians \"the most democratically 
developed Arabs,\" Peres told Senator Talent that he would 
recommend to the Palestinians that they draft and adopt a 
constitution firmly defining the separation of powers as soon 
as possible after the January elections.  Donors, including 
the Saudis, could then be effectively mobilized to support PA 
institutions. 
 
8.  (C) Peres said that the biggest challenge facing the 
Palestinians now is the urgent need to bring their security 
forces under control.  Although Abu Ala\'a is now head of the 
Palestinian National Security Council and thus in charge of 
all of the armed forces, Arafat had allowed the security 
forces to become politicized and the leaders of the various 
groups to become political leaders in their own right.  The 
Palestinians, Peres predicted, will not be able to disarm the 
terrorist groups by force.  Instead, it is essential that the 
PA offer a political solution backed up by a credible threat 
of force.  Peres agreed with Senator Talent that increasing 
numbers of Arabs and Muslims are interested in 
democratization and more rights for women.  Peres was less 
confident, however, as to the Arab countries\' willingness to 
take on the difficult actions necessary to satisfy this 
demand and join the rest of the world. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Disengagement Cost Remains Unclear 
---------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) Both Peres and Netanyahu were reluctant to assign a 
specific cost to disengagement.  When asked, Netanyahu did 
not answer directly, saying instead \"we will get back to 
you.\"  Peres was somewhat less circumspect, albeit no more 
specific, saying that, although the GOI \"has an idea\" of the 
cost, people are avoiding the question because that cost will 
be so high.  Peres agreed with Senator Talent\'s assessment, 
however, that regardless of the expense, disengagement would 
ultimately lower costs for Israel in the long run. 
 
-------------------------- 
Netanyahu: Economic Reform 
-------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Netanyahu said that he is cutting government 
spending and taxes in Israel \"with a vengeance,\" adding that 
he intends to remove mono- and duopolies in such areas as 
utilities, refineries and the postal service.  Entitlements 
are being cut as well, Netanyahu said, comparing his efforts 
to transform the Israeli economy to the New Zealand 
government\'s efforts in the 1980\'s.  By taking this \"all at 
once\" approach, he said, Israel will get the maximum positive 
impact from these steps, adding jokingly that it also helped 
to \"consolidate all the strikes.\"

TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, LE, SY, IS, GOI EXTERNAL 
SUBJECT: MFA ANALYSTS TO CODEL TALENT: SYRIA IS ON A 
TIGHTROPE 
 
Classified By: Pol/C Norm Olsen for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary: MFA Deputy Director General for 
Intelligence and Research Harry Kney-Tal told CODEL Talent 
December 6 that Syria will not relinquish either its hold on 
Lebanon or its relationship with Iraq without gaining some 
concessions from the West to replace them.  With one million 
Syrians working in Lebanon, that country is too important to 
less-economically sound Syria, and the al-Assad government is 
currently strengthening cultural, educational and economic 
ties between the two countries in the hopes of further 
entrenching Syrian influence there.  Kney-Tal and Senator 
Talent agreed that developing democracy in the Arab world is 
perhaps the biggest and most important ideological challenge 
facing the world since WWII, and that it is essential not to 
pursue short-term stability at the expense of this vital 
long-term strategic goal.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Senator James Talent, accompanied by Military 
Legislative Assistant Lindsey Neas, Legislative Fellow Lore 
Aguayo, and Navy Senate Liaison Deputy Director Cpt. James 
Stein met December 6 with Harry Kney-Tal, MFA Deputy Director 
General for Intelligence and Research, and Baruch Binah, 
Director of the International Affairs Bureau at the MFA. 
Poloff (notetaker) and MFA North America desk officer Nina 
Ben-Ami also accompanied. 
 
------------------------ 
Paradoxical Relationship 
------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) Kney-Tal opened the meeting by saying that resolution 
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is increasingly important 
and adamantly opposed by countries like Iran and Syria that 
are concerned that a settlement would diminish their 
influence.  Calling Syria a paradox, Kney-Tal highlighted the 
contradiction between Syria\'s opposition to settling the 
Israeli-Palestinian dispute and the  sporadic overtures Syria 
began sending in December 2003 with the publication of a New 
York Times interview in which Syrian President Bashar 
al-Assad called for a return to Israel-Syria negotiations. 
 
4.  (C) Syria, Kney-Tal continued, is only making \"cosmetic\" 
adjustments to its policy, fearful of doing more because of 
Syria\'s strategic relations with Iran.  Before Syria gives 
away anything that might imperil that relationship, Kney-Tal 
predicted, al-Assad is going to want \"something new\" in its 
place.  Furthermore, negotiations with Israel will doubtless 
entail Syria eventually giving up Lebanon, Kney-Tal said, 
something that Syria cannot afford economically.  Here, too, 
Syria would expect to have something in place before making 
any sort of move.  The Syrians do realize, however, that if 
and when the Palestinian negotiation track takes off, Syria 
will be left behind.  Syrian actions and statements now are 
intended to keep Syria in Israel\'s mind as a potential 
partner, Kney-Tal said, stressing that Syria could be a major 
roadblock to any settlement with the Palestinians if it so 
chooses. 
 
5.  (C) Lebanon remains lucrative for Syria, as more than one 
million Syrians work there and send remittances home to their 
families in Syria.  In addition, many senior Syrian military 
leaders continue to live well off of both illicit enterprises 
(such as drug smuggling and counterfeiting) and legal 
business ventures they developed while stationed in Lebanon, 
all of which they would be reluctant to give up easily. 
Kney-Tal predicted that current Syrian troop levels in 
Lebanon will likely decrease to some 3,000 troops, from the 
current 16,000 troops, in the coming months, deployed largely 
in the Beka\'a valley.  Syria is instead building up cultural, 
educational and economic ties, Kney-Tal said, exerting its 
influence in Lebanon in ways similar to those the former 
Soviet government used to control its satellites in Eastern 
Europe. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Bashar In Charge, But Rigid System Could Crack 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6.  (C) In response to Senator Talent\'s question, Kney-Tal 
said that the GOI believes that al-Assad is the one making 
the decisions in Syria, albeit after what Kney-Tal called 
\"wide consultations.\"  The old system of vested interests 
remains in place from the time of his father, Hafez al-Assad, 
Kney-Tal cautioned, and Bashar al-Assad must maintain a 
careful balance between these interests.  Fearing that 
opportunities for progress will be missed throughout the Arab 
world, Kney-Tal lamented the fact that bold leadership does 
not appear to exist presently anywhere in the Arab world. 
Although Bashar al-Assad is nominally in charge, he remains a 
captive of the system.  If Assad shakes the system too 
sharply in the name of democratization, Kney-Tal said, his 
Allawite support base (some 12 percent of the population) 
could bring him down in order to save its prerogatives as the 
ruling elite. 
------------------------------------------- 
\"Ideological Challenge Not Seen Since WWII\" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Kney-Tal called the current situation ideologically 
challenging in a way not seen since WWII.  Europe prefers to 
maintain the status quo, Kney-Tal said, but the United States 
has rejected this course in the Middle East, preferring to 
risk short-term instability in the hope of making long-term 
gains by developing democratic allies.  With this approach, 
President Bush is also challenging the Western alliance, 
which he is pushing to adapt to his strategy, Kney-Tal said. 
Binah added that it is not a question of party politics in 
America -- even liberals are now unwilling to relinquish a 
leadership role for the U.S. in the region and in the war on 
terrorism.  Senator Talent concurred, rejecting any 
suggestion that the U.S. go along with a bad regime, such as 
Syria\'s, in hopes of reaping short-term gains in, for 
example, Iraq.  The tide of what people in the region want is 
simply too strong, Senator Talent concluded, and it is 
essential for the U.S. to be on side pushing for broader 
democratization. 
 
8.  (U) CODEL Talent has cleared this cable.

TAGS: PGOV, IS, GOI INTERNAL 
SUBJECT: SHARON AND PERES AIM FOR UNITY GOVERNMENT WITHIN 
THE WEEK DESPITE LEGAL HICCOUGH OVER PERES\' ROLE 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norman Olsen for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Prime Minister Sharon is well on his way to 
gaining passage of an amendment to the country\'s Basic Laws 
that will meet Labor\'s demands for senior government 
positions and allow Sharon to form a new government by New 
Year\'s.  The amendment would allow for a second alternate 
prime minister position -- to be held by Shimon Peres -- a 
position demanded by Labor in lieu of receiving the Defense, 
Foreign Affairs, or Finance portfolios.  Sharon is exerting 
strong pressure on his party to expedite Knesset approval of 
the bill, and Labor Party leader Peres is pushing his own 
party to approve the coalition agreement and elect its seven 
ministerial candidates.  The outcome of internal party 
squabbles over process and expediency will determine whether 
a unity government will be formed this week or next.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
\"Peres Bill\" Key to Unity Government 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) Labor and Likud are expected to ram through the 
Knesset within days the necessary amendment to the Basic Laws 
to create a second alternate prime minister position to be 
held by Shimon Peres, as detailed in the proposed Likud-Labor 
agreement.  Likud MK Ehud Olmert already occupies the single 
alternate PM slot allowed under Israel\'s Basic Laws, which 
are similar in effect to a constitution. 
 
3.  (C) Likud Party officials have been greasing the 
legislative process to allow for expedited passage of the 
amendment -- now referred to as the \"Peres Bill.\"  Although 
Knesset Constitution and Law Committee Chairman Michael 
Eitan, whose committee must consider the amendment, is 
opposed to rushing the action, the 21-member Knesset House 
Committee approved abbreviated consideration December 20, 
allowing the Knesset plenary to refer the bill to Eitan\'s 
committee for consideration December 21.  Ministry of Justice 
Knesset Liaison Paz Barnett told poloff December 21 that 
Eitan is under pressure to complete work on the bill in only 
one or two sittings and refer the bill back to the Knesset 
for votes as early as December 22.  Eitan has indicated, 
however, that his committee\'s deliberations could last 
through the week.  The bill requires three Knesset readings 
and votes after it leaves the committee, but all three could 
be completed back-to-back on the same or consecutive days. 
 
----------------------------- 
Getting Labor\'s Ducks in Line 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Despite internal Labor squabbles over timing, Labor\'s 
Central Committee is now scheduled to meet December 21 to 
endorse the Likud-Labor agreement -- including a contingency 
clause requiring passage of the Basic Laws amendment -- and 
determine how and when it will select its ministerial and 
deputy minister candidates.  Party elections will likely take 
place within a week.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All newspapers reported that Monday, comparing 
themselves to such freedom fighters as Martin Luther 
King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, the Yesha Council of 
Jewish Settlements in the Territories backed a call by 
Pinchas Wallerstein, the head of the Binyamin Regional 
Council, for the public to fight the disengagement plan 
even if it means breaking the law.  All media reported 
that A-G Menachem Mazuz ordered the state prosecutor 
Monday to \"examine\" the leaflet distributed by 
Wallerstein.  Maariv quoted senior Council members as 
saying that the Council will circulate a petition among 
Israelis inside and outside the Green Line, in which 
the signatories will commit themselves to coming to the 
Gaza Strip on the day of the evacuation, opposing it 
forcibly, and exposing themselves to being sent to 
jail.  Leading media reported on a campaign among Gush 
Katif settlers in the Gaza Strip, particularly 
Holocaust survivors, to put on orange stars of David 
reminiscent of World War II-era yellow stars.  Last 
night, Channel 10-TV revealed that thousands of such 
badges have been produced and that they will be 
presented Wednesday in a special ceremony.  Israel 
Radio reported that Avner Shalev, Chairman of the Yad 
Vashem Directorate, urged that symbols and terminology 
taken from the Holocaust not be used in the public- 
political debate.  Ha\'aretz quoted Police Inspector 
General Moshe Karadi as saying Monday that public 
opposition could prevent the evacuation of Gush Katif. 
 
Israel Radio quoted President Bush as saying Monday at 
a White House press conference, regarding Syrian 
support for Iraqi insurgents: \"We have sent messages to 
the Syrians in the past, and we will continue to do so. 
We have tools at our disposal, a variety of tools, 
ranging from diplomatic tools to economic pressure. 
Nothing is taken off the table.\"  The radio also quoted 
the President as saying: \"I\'m realistic about how to 
achieve peace.  And it starts with my understanding 
that there will never be peace until a true democratic 
state emerges in the Palestinian territory.\"  Bush said 
that the Palestinian elections were the beginning of 
such a democratic process.  Jerusalem Post notes that 
at his news conference Bush endorsed the idea of 
holding a Middle East peace conference in the UK early 
next year. 
 
Israel Radio reported that this morning two anti-tank 
missiles were launched at a synagogue in a northern 
Gaza Strip settlement during morning prayers, hitting 
it directly.  No one was hurt.  Jerusalem Post quoted 
Jerusalem police as saying Monday that a 67-year-old 
American immigrant who was stabbed and wounded outside 
his home in the city\'s central Abu Tor neighborhood 
late Sunday night was likely the target of a terrorist 
attack. 
While some media say that the national unity government 
will be formed by Thursday, others believe the 
establishment of the new cabinet could be delayed until 
next week.  All media reported that Monday the Knesset 
approved, 56 to 34 and two abstentions, a proposed bill 
allowing the PM to name two deputies.  The bill can 
turn into law only if it garners a majority of 61 votes 
in its next readings.  Maariv reported that Likud 
members are pressuring one of the abstainers, the 
chairman of the Knesset\'s Constitution, Law and Justice 
Committee, Likud MK Michael Eitan, to endorse the bill. 
Israel Radio reported that the Labor Party\'s Central 
Committee will meet this afternoon to endorse the 
party\'s entry into the government and to choose its 
ministers in the new cabinet. 
 
Israel Radio reported that today the Justice Ministry 
will put up on its Internet site the list of the 170 
Palestinian prisoners whom Israel is expected to 
release, in order to come across any objections. 
Jerusalem Post quoted PA officials as saying Monday 
they were deeply disappointed by Israel\'s decision to 
release only 170 prisoners. 
 
Visiting World Bank President James Wolfensohn was 
quoted as saying Monday in an interview with Ha\'aretz 
that disengagement is insufficient if it does not give 
hope to the Palestinians. 
 
Jerusalem Post and other media cited the Industry, 
Trade and Labor Ministry as saying Monday that Israel 
and Jordan are set to sign an upgraded trade agreement 
Thursday, aimed at reducing customs in bilateral trade. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited criticism by visiting Czech FM 
Cyril Svoboda of the EU\'s penchant for always trying to 
\"balance\" its statements regarding the Israeli- 
Palestinian conflict.  Yated Ne\'eman notes that the 
Czech Republic has included Hizbullah in its list of 
terrorist organizations. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the IDF is planning to hand over 
Megiddo prison in northern Israel, with its 1,300 
Palestinian prisoners, to the Prison Service in the 
coming months as a first step in what the army hopes 
will give the Prison Service responsibility for all 
security prisoners. 
Maariv reported that over 100 parents of soldiers have 
signed a petition calling for refusal to serve in the 
territories.  Yediot reported that a group of parents 
whose children were killed during their military 
service sent a letter to the directors of 250 high 
schools, asking them to convey the following message to 
parents of youngsters about to be enlisted in the IDF: 
\"Don\'t be naive like we were.  Check very carefully 
every stupid order that commanders will give your 
children.\"  Yediot quoted military sources as saying 
that those comments are unacceptable. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that a radar for the joint U.S. 
Israeli mobile laser gun, called the Nautilus, will be 
deployed shortly near Sderot to track incoming Qassam 
rockets. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Monday residents of the 
northern West Bank settlement of Yitzhar disconnected 
the water supply of an IDF outpost nearby. 
 
All media reported that British PM Tony Blair will 
arrive today and visit Israel and the PA.  Yediot says 
that PM Sharon will tell Blair that Israel will support 
the convening of an international conference in London, 
provided it only deals with the advancement of reforms 
in the PA, and not with diplomatic or security issues. 
Some media noted that Blair declined to lay a wreath on 
the late PA chairman Yasser Arafat\'s grave in Ramallah. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the Israel Navy is examining two 
new medium-size missile boats, Saar 5+, and a new Barak 
8 sea-to-sea missile system for defending ships over 
ranges of more than 100 km, after incoming Adm. David 
Ben Bashat decided to cancel a plan to acquire 10,000- 
ton warships.  Ha\'aretz adds that the Navy is also 
considering joining the U.S. Coast Guard or Navy in the 
planning of new missile boats. 
 
Yediot reported that today a group of over 500 Israeli 
and American plaintiffs, who were victims of terrorist 
actions in Israel, will file a USD 3.5-billion suit in 
a Brooklyn court against banks in the U.S., which it 
believes helped fund those acts.  Last Thursday, Yediot 
had mentioned that the plaintiffs sought USD 2 billion. 
Jerusalem Post only mentioned that 117 plaintiffs filed 
a suit against the Jordan-based Arab Bank. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that a U.S. 
federal judge in Miami Beach approved an agreement 
between the USG and Hungarian Holocaust survivors, 
settling what has become known as the \"Gold Train\" 
affair.  The newspaper quoted Washington insiders as 
saying that the agreement is likely to include the U.S. 
Administration\'s agreement to a USD 25 million 
compensation payment to fund humanitarian aid to ill 
and poverty stricken Hungarian Holocaust survivors. 
However, Ha\'aretz said that sources at Jewish 
organizations close to the talks declined to comment on 
the sums involved. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Monday in Haifa, 300 women 
attended the first national conference of Jewish and 
Arab businesswomen, organized by the Center for Jewish- 
Arab Economic Development in conjunction with the 
Konrad Adenauer Foundation. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Yediot reported that the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) has applauded both fiscal and 
monetary policies that have helped Israel foster a 
return to growth after three years of \"depress 
activity.  However, the IMF notes that many challenges 
still lie ahead. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that close associates of UN Secretary- 
General Kofi Annan have asked Israel to use its 
influence with key Jewish organizations in the U.S. to 
enlist the Jewish-American community in support of 
Annan. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that some Egyptian and Saudi 
intellectuals have criticized the decision not to allow 
films by Israeli Arabs to participate in the 
international film festival held earlier this month in 
Cairo. 
 
Ha\'aretz interviewed Prof. Anne Marie Slaughter, the 
dean at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and 
International Affairs at Princeton University, who 
attended the Herzliya Conference.  Slaughter, a critic 
of Bush\'s policy, said: \"I agree with the 
administration that a democratic Middle East is a very 
important, crucial goal.\" 
 
In Ha\'aretz, Prof. Ephraim Yaar and Prof. Tamar 
Hermann, who are behind Tel Aviv University\'s Peace 
Index survey, presented the results of parallel polls 
in the PA and Israel: 44 percent of Palestinians, 70 
percent of Israeli Jews and 58 percent of Israeli Arabs 
are more optimistic about the chances of peace 
following Yasser Arafat\'s demise.

I.  \"Have No Fear\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(December 21): \"To the settlers\' cries that they are 
being \'transferred\' and that Ariel Sharon\'s government 
is undemocratic -- two claims whose truth or falsehood 
is not even worth debating with a public that has been 
acting outside democracy for 30 years -- the government 
must first and foremost respond wisely.  The time has 
come to reduce the settler phenomenon to its true 
proportions and to cease being afraid of it. 
Lawbreakers should be dealt with using the same tools 
that are applied to ordinary lawbreakers, who do not 
enjoy governmental protection.  Settler activists from 
the rest of the country must be prevented from going to 
[the Gaza Strip settlement bloc of] Gush Katif by every 
means possible, starting now.\" 
 
II.  \"Love Hurts\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (December 21): 
\"The distress felt by the leaders of the Yesha Council 
of Jewish Settlements in the Territories is 
understandable.  For months they have been declaring 
\'we have love and it will triumph,\' even though there 
is not a trace of love among them at the moment, only 
anger, which only continues to mount the more they feel 
that they are losing, not triumphing -- in their battle 
against disengagement.  Their handiwork is drowning in 
the sea, and Sharon is singing.  Monday, after the 
pathetic crisis with Peres had ended more or less, 
Sharon took another significant step toward the 
implementation of the disengagement plan....  The 
letter by [settler leader Pinchas] Wallerstein was 
directed primarily inwards, to his constituency.  Its 
immediate goal was to let off steam, to demonstrate to 
the infuriated settlers that their leaders have not 
gone into a coma.  His colleagues on the Council of 
Settlements, who had preferred to use pleasant means up 
until now, dragged their feet and lined up behind him. 
This is what we can expect to see in the coming months: 
a furious, hurt community, some of which has despaired 
and is prepared to take any violent action, and a 
leadership that is forced to line up behind the threats 
of the militants.  This is a dangerous borderline game 
and, judging by past experience, is liable to end in 
disaster.  But there is almost no other way to play 
it.... But when leaders of the Council of Settlements 
recruit Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King to 
justify their battle, we can only smile.  The latter 
battled for the enslaved, for the oppressed, for the 
downtrodden.  The settlers are battling for the 
occupier, the strong, the armed.\" 
 
III.  \"Remember the Warring Tribes of Israel\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (December 21): \"As long as 
the majority [of Israelis] agreed to pay for building 
the settlements and for defending them, to paying a 
high price for putting up roadblocks on the way to 
them; and as long as there could be found citizens like 
me who constantly quarreled with the dissenters from 
the Left who undermined democracy and the IDF\'s ability 
to perform, [settler leader Pinchas] Wallenstein did 
not find anything wrong in a decision by the majority 
in the government and the Knesset to continue to 
maintain the settlements.... Even if Wallerstein 
manages to deter Sharon at the last minute from 
disengaging from Gush Katif, this will mean that a 
minority will have imposed its will on the majority in 
the name of God and some of the rabbis.  This will put 
an end to the isolation of the extreme-dissenting left 
wing.... Wallerstein and his supporters in Judea and 
Samaria [i.e. the West Bank] are leading Israel to 
anarchy.  The moment that lawbreakers control public 
life, the sides will loot the IDF weapons storehouses, 
each wanting a machine gun of its own.... The 
settlement leaders are in a fierce battle, in the midst 
of a storm.  But they are being asked to behave with a 
level head.  They must take another issue into account: 
if, despite their declaration of civil war, the 
democratic majority wins by virtue of force and 
evacuates Gush Katif, relations between the two sides 
of the Green Line will not revert to what they were. 
The open wound will not heal quickly. \" 
 
IV.  \"Opposition to Disengagement, But Not Through 
Detention\" 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (December 
21): \"Even those who oppose the uprooting of Jewish 
settlements from Gush Katif (in the Gaza Strip) cannot 
support [settler leader] Pinchas Wallenstein\'s letter 
that calls for breaching the evacuation law, even if 
this entails going to jail\'.... The way chosen by 
Pinchas Wallenstein is not that of the \'Land of Israel 
Faithful.\'  They are fighting the battle honestly and 
lawfully.... No only does Wallerstein\'s letter not 
contribute to the strengthening of the Gush Katif 
settlers, but it might also weaken the resistance to 
the evacuation, as a result of his call to \'breach the 
law,\' even if this involved their incarceration.... 
[The settlers] are lawfully continuing their daily 
struggle, without eying imprisonment, as suggested by 
Mr. Wallenstein.\"

Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the EU\'s Commissioner for 
External Relations and European Neighborhood Policy,

\"The European Neighborhood Policy\" 
 
Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the EU\'s Commissioner for 
External Relations and European Neighborhood Policy, 
wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 
21): \"To my delight ... the warmth is now returning [to 
Israel-EU relations].  Changes in the international 
arena, such as the forthcoming elections in the 
Palestinian Authority, a new U.S. Administration and 
indeed a new European Commission, give us a real 
opportunity to look afresh at our relations and examine 
where we would like to go from here.  And we are 
fortunate to have the tool with which to do so.  On 
December 13, the European Union and the Government of 
Israel agreed to an Action Plan, developed as part of 
the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP), which lays out 
a number of areas in which we would like to work more 
closely together.... I believe the Action Plan affords 
us a remarkable opportunity to deepen EU-Israeli 
relations in practical and mutually advantageous ways. 
And, against the backdrop of international events, I 
sense the timing is fortuitous. We will continue to 
disagree on some points, but I am sure that the 
increased level of confidence we have in one another, 
thanks to this plan, will enable us to discuss those 
points more frankly and openly than in the past.\"

SUBJECT: ISRAELI SECURITY SERVICES TELL CODEL TALENT THAT 
INTERAGENCY CONNECTIVITY IS KEY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERROR 
 
Classified By: Pol/C Norm Olsen for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Israeli Police BG David Lutsky and the Head 
of Shin Bet\'s Protection and Security Division, Doron 
Bergerbest, told CODEL Talent December 5-6 that cooperation 
and real-time information sharing is the key to Israeli 
success in thwarting suicide attacks.  Once intelligence on 
an actual suicide attack is developed by Shin Bet, that 
information is passed immediately to the police, who have 
overall control of the coordinated efforts to apprehend the 
bomber and the authority to requisition and direct resources 
and manpower as necessary.  Both officials said that the 
separation barrier plays a vital role, in conjunction with 
sound intelligence work and enhanced inter-service 
cooperation in defeating suicide bombers.  Bergerbest said 
that Iran, through its proxy Hizballah and down through 
Palestinian militant factions, is a chief orchestrator of 
terror attacks against Israel, operating what he claimed are 
38 cells in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that have carried 
out between them 66 attacks.  He claimed that, in recent 
months, Shin Bet has detected a notable increase in weapons 
smuggled into the West Bank from Egypt via Sinai (Note: and 
thus through Israel.  End Note) and Hebron, including as many 
as five anti-aircraft missiles.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Senator James Talent, accompanied by Military 
Legislative Assistant Lindsey Neas, Legislative Fellow Lore 
Aguayo, and Navy Senate Liaison Deputy Director Cpt. James 
Stein, met with Israeli Police Brigadier General David 
Lutsky, Commander of the Counter-Terrorism Training Division, 
and Doron Bergerbest, head of the Protection and Security 
Division at Israeli Security Agency (Shin Bet), December 5-6 
to explore Israeli methods of interagency cooperation in the 
fight against terrorist attacks.  A/RSO and Poloff 
(notetaker) accompanied. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Police Have the Lead in an Emergency 
------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) BG David Lutsky, Commander of the Counter-Terrorism 
Training Division told CODEL Talent December 6 that, in the 
aftermath of the 2002 Park Hotel bombing in Netanya, the GOI 
had decided it was time to \"start dealing with the swamp and 
not the mosquitoes,\" and began a process by which 
counter-terrorism efforts became more cooperative and hence 
more effective.  A GOI decision putting the police in charge 
of homeland security had been required to establish the 
pecking order, Lutsky said, as fist fights between emergency 
service staff jockeying for preeminence at the scene of an 
attack were not unheard of in the past.  Now, when Shin Bet 
supplies a tip-off that a terrorist is en route to a target, 
the information is fed directly to the police commander of 
the affected sector, who then mobilizes all of the resources 
he deems necessary to meet the threat, bringing in IDF 
helicopter support to track the terrorists\' movements, for 
example, and alerting ambulance and fire brigades. 
 
4.  (C) Following many drills and joint training exercises, 
the various emergency and security services are now well 
practiced in coordinating their activity.  The commanders are 
personally known to each other and make efforts to keep in 
touch.  The transmission of intelligence information in \"real 
time\" is essential, and Lutsky praised Shin Bet efforts. 
Calling specialized counter-terrorism units very important, 
Lutsky stressed that, as important as these units are, they 
cannot substitute for overall readiness.  He cited several 
examples of local police responding immediately to shooting 
attacks and thus saving additional lives by their quick 
action. 
 
----------------- 
Essential Elements 
----------------- 
 
5.  (C) In closing, Lutsky elaborated what he called 
essential elements that a commander must take into 
consideration in any emergency situation.  First is 
engendering and utilizing public cooperation.  Lutsky said 
that a large number of Israeli Arabs receive basic emergency 
response training by the police (Note: Israeli Arabs do not 
serve in the military, which is where most Jewish Israelis 
receive their primary emergency response training.  End Note) 
so that they can be ready to assist in a crisis.  Second, 
keeping up a flow of information to the public, even if it is 
only to say that the police are investigating reports, is 
essential to maintaining public confidence that the situation 
is under control, Lutsky said.  Third, Lutsky stressed that 
police in the United States needed to realize that a response 
to, for example, a shooting attack should not fundamentally 
different regardless of whether that attack was criminally or 
terror motivated.  Fourth, taking care of the responders 
themselves, both their mental health in the aftermath of the 
horrific events to which they must respond without flinching, 
as well as backing them up in the aftermath of an event, 
given that they must make split-second decisions, often based 
on incomplete information.  Lutsky claimed that his most 
significant victory has been that Israelis still ride buses 
and go to shopping malls and theaters. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Shin Bet -- No Room for \"Entity Ego\" 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) Doron Bergerbest, head of the Protection and Security 
Division at Israeli Security Agency (Shin Bet), told CODEL 
Talent in a separate meeting December 5 that necessity had 
driven the GOI to develop the integrated terror prevention 
and response procedures currently in place.  After an overall 
decline in suicide bombings in the 1990\'s -- down to zero 
attacks in 1999 -- the number of suicide attacks carried out 
inside Israel again began to climb with the outbreak of the 
al-Aqsa Intifada in 2001, spiking at 60 terrorist attacks in 
2002.  In calendar 2004 to date, Bergerbest said, that there 
have been 15 terrorist attacks in Israel. 
 
7.  (C) Bergerbest said that Israel had not been ready for 
the second Intifada, a sentiment shared independently by 
other interlocutors (Police BG Lutsky said that Israel had 
been \"caught with its pants down\"), as most Israelis then 
believed that the trend was towards peace.  Since the current 
cycle of violence began, 70 percent of those killed and 81 
percent of those injured have been civilians, Bergerbest 
said.  The change in Israeli tactics came in 2002, when the 
GOI launched Operation Defensive Shield in the wake of the 
suicide attack at the Park Hotel in Netanya that killed 31 
Israelis.  This operation, Bergerbest said, bought Israel 
some time to reorganize its inter-service response to the 
vastly increased threat of terrorist attacks inside Israel. 
In response to Senator Talent\'s question, Bergerbest 
concurred \"absolutely\" that the separation barrier dividing 
the West Bank from Israel is playing a key role in defeating 
suicide bombers.  The relative inexperience of the current 
crop of militant leaders -- third or even fourth tier, 
following the deaths or arrests of more senior commanders -- 
is also important, he said. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Despite Progress, the Threat Remains Very Real 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
8.  (C) Bergerbest claimed that in recent months there had a 
been a notable increase in weapons smuggled into the West 
Bank from Egypt via Sinai and Hebron (Note: This routing 
means that the items must also pass through Israel.  End 
Note).  Of the information about which Shin Bet was certain 
(either through what he said were confirmed intelligence 
reports or confiscated shipments), Bergerbest said that some 
2,000 kilos of explosives, 1,021 anti-tank missiles, 7,833 
Kalashnikovs, 477, pistols, 33 mortars, and five 
anti-aircraft missiles were known to have been en route at 
one time or another to Palestinian militants in the West Bank 
and Gaza (Note: Bergerbest did not explain how such volumes 
of weapons and munitions could transit Israeli-controlled 
borders and Israel proper, or how security personnel could be 
so certain of shipment details while not intercepting the 
shipments.  End Note).  In particular, he said, if the 
anti-aircraft missiles ever reached the West Bank, civil 
aviation would be seriously jeopardized.  Bergerbest said 
that Iran, through its proxy Hizballah, is a chief 
orchestrator of terror attacks against Israel, operating what 
he said are 38 cells in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that 
have carried out between them 66 attacks, killing 27 Israelis 
and wounding another 54.

SUBJECT: GUSH KATIF FARMERS SHORT-HANDED FOR HIGH SEASON AS 
THAI WORKERS DEPART 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Bill Weinstein for reasons 1.4 (b) an 
d (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary: On Saturday, December 18, the visiting Thai 
Labor Minister and the Thai Ambassador to Israel met with 150 
Thai agricultural workers in Gush Katif and encouraged them 
to leave the settlement for security reasons.  The meeting 
resulted in over 80 workers tentatively agreeing to depart, 
either to find jobs inside Green Line Israel or return to 
Thailand.  Gush Katif communications director Devorah Rosen 
told Econoff that only twenty Thais intend to leave, a number 
that would not cause the settlement farms to close 
permanantly, but would hinder \"high season\" production from 
December to February, especially on farms larger than 20 
dunams.  In the longer-term Gush Katif hopes to replace 
departing Thais with Nepalese workers, but this lengthy 
bureaucratic process has been made more difficult by the 
GOI\'s reluctance to grant employment permits for settlements 
slated for evacuation.  While Rosen asserted that Thai 
laborers are well-treated and better paid than their 
counterparts inside Israel, the Thai Embassy described poor 
working conditions in the settlement, including employers who 
withhold salaries and passports to prevent workers from 
fleeing.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Thai Government Intensifies Push for Laborers to Leave 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Thai Labor Minister Uraiwan Thienthong and Thai 
Ambassador to Israel Kasivat Paruggamanont met December 18 
with some 150 Thai laborers currently working in the Gush 
Katif settlement, in an effort to encourage them to depart 
immediately.  The meeting was an intensification of the GoT\'s 
four-year-old policy of discouraging laborers from accepting 
employment in Gush Katif, and came on the heels of the third 
killing of a Thai worker in the Gaza Strip since the intifada 
began.  According to Thai Deputy Chief of Mission Chantipha 
Phutrakul, some eighty laborers raised their hands when the 
Labor Minister asked, \"Who is ready to leave?\"  Phutrakul 
noted that although the Minister cited Israel\'s planned 
withdrawal from Gaza as one of many incentives for laborers 
to depart, the GoT\'s concern is for laborers\' security, \"not 
Israel\'s political process.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Israeli Immigration Will Deport Illegals, Find Others Jobs 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
3.  (C) Nearly one third of Gush Katif\'s Thai workers are 
illegally residing in Israel, and many are \"using the 
settlement as a hide-out from the immigration police.\" 
Phutrakul said the Minister and the Ambassador addressed 
these laborers\' fear of deportation by simply asking them to 
come home, stating, \"You will find greener pastures 
elsewhere.\"  Conversely, workers still in legal status can 
expect assistance from Israeli immigration -- Ambassador 
Paruggamanont met with the chief of the immigration police, 
who reportedly agreed to assist those workers whose visas are 
less than two years old in finding jobs inside Green Line 
Israel. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Every Worker Counts in High Season 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Devorah Rosen, Communications Director for Gush 
Katif, told Econoff that not more than 20 laborers will leave 
the settlement.  \"Eighty may have raised their hands at the 
meeting, but they didn\'t sign any agreement,\" she said.  The 
settlement leadership is optimistic that Thai anxieties will 
dissipate within \"three to four weeks\", and that the Thai 
government\'s calls for depart will have little lasting effect 
on settlement agriculture.  In the short term, however, even 
20 lost laborers will prove problematic, since \"every person 
counts\" during the \"high season\" of production which runs 
from December to late February.  She explained that the 
larger farmers -- those with more than 20 dunams of land -- 
will be hit especially hard by the loss of even a few 
laborers since unlike on smaller farms, landowners will be 
unable to fill in for the departed workers themselves. 
 
------------------------------------ 
GOI Hindering Long-Term Replacements 
------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (SBU) While the manpower agency that supplies Gush Katif 
has brought in several Nepalese laborers who can replace 
Thais, settlement farmers are faced with a lengthy 
bureaucratic process within the Ministry of the Interior in 
order to secure permits for new workers.  Since Gush Katif is 
slated for evacuation, the Ministry is reluctant to issue new 
work permits for the settlement.  Rosen noted that farmers 
must ask the Ministry to transfer existing permits by 
canceling those of the Thai workers and reissuing them under 
the names of their Nepalese replacements.  One can \"read 
between the lines\", she added, to see that the GOI is \"making 
this about\" disengagement.  With only twenty workers who need 
replacing, Rosen said, the thorny permit process will be 
manageable.  If that number increases, however, farming in 
Gush Katif could suffer a serious and long-term setback. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
Katif Says Workers Satisfied, Thai Embassy Cites Maltreatment 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Rosen said that the Thai workers in Gush Katif are 
happy to stay -- they enjoy excellent treatment and high 
salaries, and they get Saturdays off, unlike their 
counterparts in Green Line Israel.  As an example of good 
employer-employee relations she cited the winter coats the 
workers received as holiday gifts from their employers in 
Ganne Tal and Gush Katif.  When it comes to the three Thais 
who were killed, she continued, laborers view themselves as 
\"victims of circumstance\" rather than specific targets of 
terrorism. 
 
7.  (C) In the view of the Thai Embassy, however, a vast 
majority of the Thai laborers in Gush Katif would prefer to 
work elsewhere.  Relations with employers are bad, explained 
Phutrakul, with some farmers withholding salaries and 
passports in an attempt to prevent laborers from fleeing in 
the face of the ongoing security threat.  She added that 
laborers are also forced to work 15-20 more hours per week 
than their Green Line Israel counterparts.  Along with the 
constant security threat within the Gaza Strip, Thai laborers 
have found themselves in a situation Phutrakul said the GoT 
\"cannot abide anymore.\"

This is a joint Embassy Tel Aviv - Consulate General 
Jerusalem message. 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Palestinian and Israeli water chiefs and 
their staffs held a thorough exchange focusing on water 
supply issues for Gaza and the West Bank during 
U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian Trilateral Water Talks at USAID 
offices in Tel Aviv December 9.  The Israeli and Palestinian 
officials agreed to address a variety of immediate and 
long-term issues in bilateral Joint Water Committee (JWC) and 
Joint Technical Committee (JTC) meetings later this month. 
Israeli Water Commissioner Shimon Tal and Palestinian Water 
Authority (PWA) Chairman Nabil Sharif agreed on the need to 
engage in long-term planning while cooperating closely on 
immediate supply needs.  Revisiting themes from a meeting 
with Ambassador Kurtzer and Consul General Pearce earlier 
that day, Sharif called for an active U.S. dialogue with the 
Palestinians and resumption of major water projects in the 
Gaza Strip.  Both Tal and Sharif identified desalination 
(desal) as a key factor in handling future supply gaps. 
Coordination of wastewater treatment with water supply 
planning was also highlighted as key to addressing water 
shortages.  Embassy and Consulate General will encourage both 
parties to hold near-term detailed discussions on the impact 
of Gaza disengagement on water supply and infrastructure 
arrangements.  End summary. 
 
IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND A LONG-TERM VISION 
-------------------------------------- 
2. (C) The latest meeting of the Trilateral Water Working 
Group, chaired by NEA Senior S&T Advisor Charles Lawson, was 
held on December 9, less than six months after the last 
session (reftel).  Despite occasional sparring, Israeli and 
Palestinian participants praised the close cooperation of the 
\"water club\" and emphasized the need to work together even 
more closely on immediate water needs and longer-term 
planning.  PWA Chairman Sharif opened by saying \"If we are to 
be a state, we need to have our own source of water.  There 
will be no trade in water and we will be the owners of the 
water source,\" referring to the suspended Gaza desalination 
project.  (Comment: Although Sharif opened with a hard-line 
statement, he proceeded to soften his tone during the 
meeting, repeatedly reiterating the need for cooperation. 
End Comment).  In the course of the three-hour meeting, 
Sharif and his deputy Fadel Kawash voiced flexibility 
regarding new sources of water supplies, whether from 
jointly-agreed new wells, re-use of wastewater, desal, or 
purchase from Israeli water company Mekorot. 
 
3. (C) Israeli Water Commissioner Tal noted that within 
Israel new supplies would be coming on line from the Ashkelon 
desal plant and from treatment at more than forty wastewater 
effluent points that would yield 150 million cubic meters of 
water over the next two years.  Tal and planning chief Yossef 
Dreizin said it was time to create \"a new vision\" for the 
future of water in the West Bank and Gaza, as a decade had 
passed since the Interim Agreement.  (Comment:  This was 
clearly an attempt by the Israeli side to begin the thinking 
and planning process towards negotiations on water.  End 
comment).  Kawash detailed water supply problems in the 
northern West Bank.  He also touched on training needs for 
PWA personnel.  Both sides agreed with Lawson\'s suggestion 
that JWC and JTC meetings later this month review the overall 
water supply situation in the West Bank and then recommend 
how best the USG could assist. 
 
4. (C) Both sides also agreed to a renewed emphasis on 
coordinating water supply and wastewater treatment efforts. 
The Palestinian side and the JWC intend to invite donors to a 
coordination meeting on such projects after the January 9 
Palestinian presidential election, with USAID providing 
technical support for that session as needed.  The Israelis 
and Palestinians also agreed to facilitate new Israeli 
supplies of water for Ramallah, and to agree on a location 
for the Gaza emergency connector before the end of the 
calendar year.  All parties pledged to include public 
awareness outreach efforts to enhance understanding of the 
benefits of wastewater treatment projects, especially for 
farmers who could use treated wastewater for irrigation.  The 
upcoming JWC/JTC meetings will discuss and handle the issue 
of unauthorized wells on the West Bank as a bilateral issue. 
 
LOOKING FURTHER AHEAD 
--------------------- 
5. (C) In separate conversations on the margins of the 
Trilateral Water Working Group meeting, both Tal and Sharif 
told Lawson that they were ready to enter into water 
negotiations whenever their respective leaderships give the 
approval.  At the talks, Sharif stated that both emergency 
needs and long-term planning should work in parallel, calling 
the latter even \"more important\" than the present needs 
detailed by his deputy.  Tal noted the degradation of the 
quality of water in shared aquifers due to population 
pressures as an added incentive for forward planning.  Sharif 
and Tal agreed they would report back to U.S. colleagues on 
discussions in the JWC and/or JTC on broad future planning, 
including what kind of involvement they want from the USG. 
They also agreed to restore the frequency of the Trilateral 
Meetings, committing to a new round of talks in approximately 
three months. 
 
PWA Chair Urges Stronger U.S. Engagement with Palestinians 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
6. (C) Echoing comments he had made earlier at a working 
breakfast with Lawson and in a private meeting with 
Ambassador Kurtzer and Consul General Pearce that morning, 
Sharif made an impassioned plea for the U.S. to engage with 
Palestinians across the full range of development issues, and 
\"...lead the international community back to Gaza,\" and to 
let the Palestinian public know that the U.S. was making 
major contributions to infrastructure development and poverty 
alleviation.  In their private meeting with Sharif, the 
Ambassador and Consul General emphasized that progress was 
needed on the Palestinian security investigation into the 
October 15, 2003 attack on the USG convoy in Gaza before they 
could recommend resumption of USAID projects in Gaza.  Sharif 
expressed concern that not enough attention was being given 
to the USG role in development projects in the region. 
Middle Easterners see images of the devastation in Iraq 
rather than images highlighting all the contributions that 
the USG has made to develop Iraq. Sharif stressed that a lack 
of USG action in Gaza could compound the negative perception 
of the USG\'s regional role. 
 
7. (C) In response, the Ambassador and Consul General said 
that Sharif could assist by bringing water issues to the 
forefront with the Palestinian leadership, especially the 
impact the Gaza projects will have on the 1.3 million people 
in Gaza.  The CG noted his sense that to the leadership in 
the West Bank, the Gaza water projects remain somewhat 
abstract assistance projects, since they are not living 
through the very difficult water situation in Gaza.  The more 
the West Bank leadership hears from those living in Gaza 
about the importance of the projects, the better.  Then the 
leadership may come to understand how their actions on 
security issues in Gaza will have a practical effect on the 
Gaza population. 
 
Still to be Addressed:  Disengagement and Water Infrastructure 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
8. (C) Comment:  This latest round of talks was positive and 
bodes well for future cooperation.  At one point, Sharif went 
so far as to say \"The Intifada is over...the man is dead.\" 
This reference to Arafat\'s passing further emphasized 
Sharif\'s interest in moving forward.  Despite their 
relatively close collaboration and the progressive atmosphere 
evidenced in the talks, Israeli and Palestinian water 
officials have not yet directly tackled the impact that 
disengagement from Gaza will have on water issues.  The GOI 
has pledged to leave water infrastructure intact, but the 
reality on the ground promises to be more complicated.  The 
Embassy and Consulate General will be encouraging Tal, 
Sharif, and their staffs to look at supply and maintenance 
arrangements, to help avoid collateral damage to water 
infrastructure as settlements are evacuated, and to pay close 
attention to the health of the Coastal Aquifer.  End comment.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Israel Radio reported that last night the IDF entered 
the Khan Yunis refugee camp, from which it had pulled 
out three days ago, in order to neutralize mortars and 
Qassam rocket launchers.  The IDF killed an armed 
Palestinian in the camp.  The station reported that the 
operation is expected to last for two days. 
 
All media, except Ha\'aretz, led with events related to 
the planned disengagement from the Gaza Strip. 
Jerusalem Post and other media say that the opponents 
of the disengagement plan sharpened battle lines 
Tuesday when dozens of settlers donned orange Star of 
David badges.  The media reported that right-wing MKs 
were among those who condemned the badge campaign. 
Maariv quoted right-wing activists as saying that 2,500 
IDF soldiers, including several hundred in regular 
service, have signed a petition in which they pledge 
refusal to serve orders to evacuate settlers.  Leading 
media quoted IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Ya\'alon as saying 
before the Knesset\'s Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee that he is worried by the radicalization of 
statements by settlers. 
 
Ha\'aretz (Zeev Schiff) reported that the U.S. is 
demanding that Israel not send back to China some of 
the drones sent here for upgrading.  The UAVs are 
already Chinese property.  The newspaper reported that 
the Israelis were astonished, considering there is no 
American technology in the drones.  However, Ha\'aretz 
quoted American sources as saying that Israel will have 
no choice but to comply with the U.S. demand.  The 
newspaper says that the \"powerful\" pro-Taiwan lobby is 
warning that advanced Israeli weapons technologies 
could be used against U.S. soldiers defending the 
island state off the coast from China. 
 
The electronic media reported that Sharon met with 
British PM Tony Blair this morning in Jerusalem, and 
that Blair is expected to meet toady with other Israeli 
leaders and with the PA leadership.  Reviewing the 
joint Sharon-Blair news conference, in which Blair said 
that disengagement should lead to the implementation of 
the road map, Ayala Hasson of Israel TV said there was 
a total alignment of U.S., British and Israeli 
positions regarding the issue of terrorism in the 
region.  Sharon said at the conference that an end to 
terrorism would \"change the situation in the region.\" 
He added: \"The road map offers a solution to both 
sides, but ending terror is prerequisite.\"  All media 
reported that Blair arrived in Israel last night after 
a surprise visit to Baghdad. 
Jerusalem Post and Israel Radio reported that Israel 
has allowed 1,000 Palestinian policemen to carry 
pistols in order to maintain order during local 
elections in the PA, which are scheduled for Thursday 
in 26 Palestinian municipalities in the West Bank. 
Ha\'aretz cited the concern of the Fatah leadership that 
it may lose ground to Hamas in those elections 
 
All media reported that a woman was stabbed to death 
Tuesday in Moshav Nehusha, south of Beit Shemesh.  The 
media cited the police\'s belief that the murderer 
infiltrated Israel from the West Bank and acted out of 
nationalist motives.  All media cited a Shin Bet 
announcement that it has arrested Muhammad Abu-Gweed, a 
Syria-born Palestinian who has resided in the West Bank 
during the past few years, on suspicion that he was a 
Hizbullah agent.  Abu-Gweed had lived in Iraq, where he 
took part in battles against U.S. forces.  He is 
suspected of planning attacks on Israeli trains. 
Maariv reported that around 15 Palestinians wanted by 
Israel have returned to the \"Muqata\" in Ramallah. 
 
Israel Radio reported that the Justice Ministry has 
asked President Moshe Katsav to pardon 37 Palestinian 
prisoners who are included in a list of 170 detainees 
to be freed -- likely by Monday.  The release of the 
others is within the powers of the Defense Ministry and 
senior IDF officers. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Trade Minister Ehud Olmert 
will meet with King Abdullah II of Jordan in Amman on 
Thursday. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that on the first anniversary of the 
signing of the Geneva Accord, an advertising campaign 
is being aired on the Palestinian Qalqilya Channel-TV 
and five other TV channels, featuring Israeli and 
Palestinian statesmen voicing their support for the 
venture.  The newspaper quoted Qalqilya Channel-TV 
director Tariq Jabara as saying that while a similar 
campaign elicited violent reactions in the PA a few 
months ago, the current promotion \"does not go beyond 
the bounds of ordinary debate.\" 
 
Jerusalem Post and other media reported that Wissam 
Tayem, who was allegedly forced by an IDF soldier to 
play a tune on his violin at a West Bank roadblock six 
weeks ago, was invited by the Keshet Eilon Music Center 
in the Galilee to participate in a three-day master 
violin class that brings together Jewish and Arab 
musicians. 
All media reported that Tuesday the Labor Party\'s 
Central Committee approved the coalition agreement, and 
that it will name its choice of five ministers Thursday 
out of 13 candidates.  Leading media reported that the 
passage of legislation allowing a second deputy PM 
could postpone the establishment of the new government 
by three weeks. 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post reported that Tuesday a 
majority of the Knesset\'s Constitution, Law and Justice 
Committee expressed their opposition to the possibility 
that the bill calling for compensation for settlers 
evacuated during the planned disengagement in 2005 will 
also include penalties for refusal to abide by it. 
Yediot reported that government officials have promised 
compensation to some settlers, even if the 
disengagement plan is eventually not implemented. 
 
Leading media quoted visiting Italian FM Gianfranco 
Fini as saying as saying Tuesday that Italian 
paramilitary police will begin training Palestinian 
security forces in the coming weeks.  He was quoted as 
saying in an interview with Jerusalem Post that Italy 
should justify Israel\'s case to the EU, and that 
reports of growing internal dissent in Israel will only 
give European leaders a greater appreciation of what 
Sharon is trying to do. 
 
Hatzofe quoted a high-ranking Israeli security official 
as saying that the Palestinians have recently begun to 
manufacture rocket propelled grenades of the kind that 
once were manufactured by the USSR. 
 
Maariv reported that Yoel Hasson, a Likud activist who 
also serves in Sharon\'s bureau, has announced, in a 
letter to thousands of Young Likud members, his 
intention to place moles at Peace Now, in order to 
investigate the movement.  Peace Now D-G Yariv 
Oppenheimer demanded that Sharon fire Hasson 
immediately. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the interrogation of four AIPAC 
senior officials, which was to take place this week, 
has been postponed until after the New Year holiday. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that UNESCO is initiating a project 
for Israeli and Palestinian journalists: the Israelis 
will learn Arabic at the Western Galilee College, while 
the Palestinians will learn Hebrew at Bir Zeit 
University.  The courses, which will be almost entirely 
funded by UNESCO, will start in January. 
 
Yediot and Maariv cited stories in The New York Times 
and The Washington Post, based on FBI memoranda, as 
saying that U.S. interrogators in Guantanamo Bay had 
wrapped an Iraqi prisoner in the Israeli flag. 
 
Yediot reported that over 30 young Israelis have been 
arrested in the U.S. in recent days over illegal 
peddling and breaking the terms of their entry visas. 
The arrests were made in the Minneapolis and San 
Francisco areas, as well as in Texas and Florida. 
 
All media reported on, and Ha\'aretz underscored, 
Tuesday\'s mortar attack on a mess tent in a U.S. 
military base in Mosul, Iraq, where hundreds of U.S. 
troops were lunching, in which at least 24 people were 
killed and 60 other were wounded. 
 
A Mina Zemach (Dahaf Institute) poll conducted among 
settlers (Yediot\'s leading story): 
-\"Do you support the call by the Yesha Council of 
Jewish settlements in the territories for breaking the 
law?\"  Support: 47 percent;  (55 percent among Gaza 
settlers); opposed: 40 percent (29 percent among Gaza 
settlers); 13 percent are undecided (16 percent among 
Gaza settlers). 
-\"How will you behave if an evacuation is decided upon 
and policemen come to your house to evacuate you?\" 
\"I\'ll barricade myself in my home and will refuse to be 
evacuated, without applying physical violence\": 42 
percent (44 percent among Gaza settlers); \"I\'ll let 
myself be evacuated without resisting\": 38 percent (23 
percent among Gaza settlers); \"I\'ll resist, using 
physical violence\": 10 percent (11 percent among Gaza 
settlers); 10 percent are undecided (22 percent among 
Gaza settlers). 
-\"How do you believe the settlers in the territories 
will behave during the evacuation?\"  \"They will 
barricade themselves in their homes and refuse to be 
evacuated, without applying physical violence\":  45 
percent (46 percent among Gaza settlers); \"They will 
resist, using physical violence\": 27 percent (22 
percent among Gaza settlers); \"They will let themselves 
be evacuated without resisting\": 11 percent (6 percent 
among Gaza settlers); 16 percent are undecided (27 
percent among Gaza settlers). 
 
Ha\'aretz cited a poll commissioned by Peace Now and 
conducted by Market Watch: 63 percent of Israelis are 
opposed to violations of the law that might be carried 
out in the process of disengagement; 20 percent favor 
such breaches; 17 percent are undecided.

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Liberal columnist Gideon Samet wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"The only way to put the settler 
leadership to the test ... is to start the actual 
evacuation, without any more blather, without turning 
weak-kneed.\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the editorial of mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot: \"A Middle Eastern \'Marshall 
Plan\' of sorts ... is feasible only if it is led by the 
United States and if it is executed in cooperation with 
Israel.  But its foundation has to be Palestinian.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Two Forces Move Into the Fray\" 
 
Liberal columnist Gideon Samet wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 22): \"During a nerve- 
wracking waiting period, a few facts are becoming 
evident. the main one is that the Prime Minister, in a 
series of well thought-out moves, has for the moment 
achieved most of his complicated goals.  He\'s the 
knight of disengagement, but he manages to get along 
with his own unruly party.... Sharon the juggler is the 
key to the success or failure of the Gaza evacuation 
initiative.  The settler picture is also becoming 
clear. They\'ll go all the way, and it could end up in 
bloodshed.... The possibility that the taut Yesha [i.e. 
settler] force ready for battle will manage to obstruct 
the disengagement cannot be taken lightly.... The only 
way to put the settler leadership to the test -- and 
the weight of the majority in favor of the exit from 
Gaza -- is to start the actual evacuation, without any 
more blather, without turning weak-kneed.\" 
 
II.  \"The Palestinians\' Test\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the editorial of mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (December 22): \"The economic 
results of the Intifada for the Palestinians have been 
catastrophic.... The World Bank now assesses that 
increasing the annual aid to the Palestinians in the 
coming few years to USD 1.4 billion annually.... A far 
greater investment will be needed to produce a real 
change in the Palestinian Authority.... of USD 15 
billion in an international project that will center 
around settling ... 1.4 million Palestinians who are 
defined as \'refugees,\' and who live in Judea, Samaria 
and Gaza [i.e. the territories].  An operation on that 
scale -- a Middle Eastern \'Marshall Plan\' of sorts -- 
is feasible only if it is led by the United States and 
if it is executed in cooperation with Israel.  But its 
foundation has to be Palestinian: the Palestinians 
themselves have to want this.  And indeed they do want 
it; after a few decades\' delay, they, we and the world 
are capable of ending, once and for all, the chapter of 
refugeeism in the life of the Palestinian nation.  The 
death of Arafat, the planned elections in the 
Palestinian Authority, the democratic and liberal 
reforms that it has undertaken to implement, and the 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza (and it is vital that it 
be carried out sooner than planned and completed by 
this coming Passover [late April]) create an historic 
opportunity to find an economic and human solution to 
the refugee problem in the natural and only possible 
place there is: in the territory of the future state of 
Palestine.\"

2.  U.S.-Israel Relations: 
-------------------------- 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: 
\"Israel walked into the problem of a severe clash -- 
and not for the first time -- with many members of 
Congress who maintain an anti-China line.... A key 
question that cannot be ignored is why such 
misunderstandings repeatedly come up between Israel and 
the U.S. regarding China.\" 
 
Foreign News Editor Arik Bachar \"addressed the U.S.\" in 
popular, pluralist Maariv: \"Who better than you knows 
that a flag is a sensitive thing, that is for looking 
at only.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Selling Arms to China, Or Not\" 
 
Senior columnist and chief defense commentator Zeev 
Schiff wrote in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz 
(December 22): \"The Israeli-American crisis over the 
sale of an advanced technology weapons system to China 
has also turned into an Israeli-Chinese crisis in the 
wake of an American demand that Israel not return to 
the Chinese the Harpy assault drone that China recently 
acquired and which it sent back to Israel for an 
upgrade.... The problem is that Israel walked into the 
problem of a severe clash -- and not for the first time 
-- with many members of Congress who maintain an anti- 
China line.  In recent weeks there have been hysterical 
reports in the U.S. about Israeli advanced technology 
sales to China.... A key question that cannot be 
ignored is why such misunderstandings repeatedly come 
up between Israel and the U.S. regarding China.... It 
is impossible [for Israel] to win with the argument 
that Taiwan is trying to drive a wedge between Israel 
and the U.S.; or that we told the Americans that they 
apparently did not understand the Israeli English; or 
that it is all a matter of jealousy in the arms 
industry, as if it were a matter of citrus exports. 
And there\'s too much counting on friends in Washington 
to get us out of every problem.\" 
 
II.  \"Dear Uncle Sam\" 
 
Foreign News Editor Arik Bachar \"addressed the U.S.\" in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (December 22): \"You know that 
the Geneva Convention forbids torturing prisoners, and 
that in the culture in my neighborhood, wrapping an 
Arab up in the Israeli flag [as was reportedly done by 
U.S. military officials in Iraq and in Guantanamo Bay 
prison] is as inhuman an act as tossing a pig\'s body on 
a suicide bomber as he is making his way to a better 
and far more sensual world that ours.  Because who 
better than you knows that a flag is a sensitive thing, 
that is for looking at only.  After all, it is in 
America that the entire nation rears up on its 
hindquarters -- or at least runs to the Supreme Court - 
- every time someone dares to desecrate the stars and 
stripes. Every June you have your \'Flag Day,\' and it 
was less than four years ago, before the current 
outburst of patriotism that brought bin Laden to your 
land, that your administration proposed amending the 
constitution so that any American who burned your 
pretty flag could be sent to prison.   So let\'s make 
sure we understand one another on this matter: from now 
on, let\'s leave ... flags out of it.\"

1.  (C) Summary: Brigadier General Yossi Kuperwasser told 
CODEL Talent December 6 that the war on terrorism must be 
waged across no less than five fronts: the physical battle; 
the efforts of society itself to endure in the face of 
continued attacks; society\'s need to remain true to its 
values rather than resorting to unsavory tactics in order to 
win; maintaining legitimacy of your country\'s actions in your 
own eyes, in those of the population, and among the 
international community; and finally to \"maintain the 
legitimacy of the narrative,\" something the United States did 
not initially do well in Iraq.  Calling it a battle for the 
hearts and minds of the Muslim world, Kuperwasser said that 
it is more important to win over the five million potential 
al-Qaeda supporters than it is to try and convert the 15,000 
actual ones.  Kuperwasser welcomed Palestinian elections, 
saying that the multiple candidates, in particular Marwan 
Barghouti, would provide the Palestinians with a clear choice 
-- moving forward to reform with Abu Mazen, or stagnating 
further by supporting the Intifada with Barghouti.  End

3.  (C) BG Yossi Kuperwasser, chief of the Research Division, 
IDF Military Intelligence, told CODEL Talent December 6 that 
terrorism emanating from Palestinian extremists is not so 
much a matter of religion as it is one of maintaining Arab 
pride.  Palestinian youth are taught that no sacrifice is too 
great, even to the point of giving one\'s life as a suicide 
bomber.  In response to the Senator\'s question, Kuperwasser 
agreed that religion plays a role as a tool, but maintained 
his point, using the latest suicide bombing (at the Carmel 
Market in Tel Aviv in November 2004) as an example: the PFLP, 
which claimed responsibility for the attack, are a Marxist 
organization, he said, not a religious one.  Groups such as 
these offer the would-be bombers the chance to be a heroes, 
Kuperwasser said, something that appeals to \"certain weak 
people.\" 
 
------------------------------------- 
\"It is a Battle for Hearts and Minds\" 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The most limiting factor in carrying out a suicide 
attack is not recruiting the bomber, according to 
Kuperwasser, but manufacturing the explosive device.  Warming 
to his subject, Kuperwasser said the problem is not to 
convince, for example, the 15,000 al-Qaeda militants to 
become pro-American, but rather to convince their five 
million possible supporters to choose not to support 
al-Qaeda.  The Senator agreed, saying it is essential to 
address the underlying causes of terrorism in order to fight 
it effectively.  The battle is one \"for hearts and minds,\" 
Kuperwasser said. 
 
5.  (C) Kuperwasser called the ongoing war against terror one 
of words and concepts, adding that the Arab world does not 
acknowledge terrorism as such, in particular on media outlets 
such al-Jazeera and al-Arabiya.  Regimes, Kuperwasser said, 
are not really relevant when it is media that is inside a 
person\'s home and shaping that individual\'s view of the 
world.  Palestinian presidential elections are extremely 
important, Kuperwasser said, as they have great legitimacy on 
the Palestinian street and will thus be an important step 
forward in conferring more legitimacy on the new crop of 
Palestinian leaders.  Kuperwasser contrasted this legitimacy 
with what he described as \"much less\" legitimacy among Iraqis 
for January elections in that country. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Barghouti\'s Candidacy is a Good Thing 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Kuperwasser professed to be unhappy that the 
Palestinians could not, as a society, move ahead with 
elections until after Arafat had left the scene from natural 
causes.  That being said, the elections themselves are the 
most important thing, and the GOI fully intends to provide 
the Palestinians with \"everything they had in 1996,\" to 
assist in successfully holding them -- including resolution 
of the Jerusalem voter issue -- to leave no excuse to blame 
Israel or subsequent failures of Palestinian governance.  The 
election of convicted terrorist Marwan Barghouti over 
moderate pragmatist Abu Mazen would leave no doubt in 
anyone\'s mind as to the direction in which Palestinian 
society was headed, Kuperwasser said. (Note: Barghouti 
subsequently withdrew form the race.  End Note). 
---------------- 
A Five-Front War 
---------------- 
 
7.  (C) Kuperwasser said that the U.S. is already fighting 
the physical war against terrorism, and has shown the 
seriousness of its intent by actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 Kuperwasser said that there are four other fronts on which a 
country needs to fight if it intends to win.  For example, 
the IDF has killed several thousand terrorists in the West 
Bank and yet there are always some 200-300 terrorists active 
at any one time.  Thus society\'s endurance in light of these 
unrelenting attacks is the second essential factor, 
Kuperwasser said.  Senator Talent agreed, saying that the 
Israeli public must believe that Israel is winning the war 
against terrorism and the Palestinians must come to believe 
that their tactics are ineffective.  The goal is to change 
the Palestinians\' expectations, Kuperwasser said, and the 
exchange of letters between PM Sharon and President Bush 
helped to achieve a fundamental alteration in the 
Palestinians\' mindset. 
 
8.  (C) The third essential element or \"front,\" according to 
Kuperwasser, is the extent to which a society remains loyal 
to its values.  Step away from those, Kuperwasser warned, and 
popular support and legitimacy will be lost.  The IDF\'s 
cooperation with Shin Bet, for example, is about trying to 
\"conventionalize\" this war, in the hopes of preventing 
civilian casualties when possible.  The IDF uses Shin Bet 
intelligence in order make pinpoint strikes against, for 
example, Qassam rocket launchers.  All of Israel\'s national 
defense assets, Kuperwasser said, are available to the 
brigade-level commander, at last providing him with real-time 
ability to respond to threats while limiting civilian 
casualties.  Kuperwasser contrasted these efforts with the 
recent killing of a 13-year-old girl in Rafah by IDF 
soldiers, the tragedy of which, he said, is compounded by the 
fact that the commander of the unit involved is accused of 
firing excessive shots into the girl\'s body.  (NOTE: 
Currently under investigation.  End Note). \"We deviated from 
our values,\" Kuperwasser said, calling the affair \"more 
damaging (to Israel) than a suicide bomber.\" 
 
9.  (C) Kuperwasser said that the fourth front to maintain is 
the legitimacy of your actions, in your own eyes and the eyes 
of the international community, and the legitimacy of your 
leadership.  Calling President Bush\'s re-election the 
\"legitimization of the (policies of the) past four years,\" 
Kuperwasser said that a leader\'s stature is exceptionally 
important in the Middle East context.  Finally, Kuperwasser 
listed what he called the \"legitimacy of the narrative,\" as 
the fifth and final front upon which the comprehensive war 
against terrorism must be waged.  The United States, in 
Kuperwasser\'s view, did not have such a narrative in the 
run-up to the Iraq war, instead shifting several times its 
main rationale for overthrowing Saddam Hussein.  Kuperwasser 
agreed with Senator Talent\'s assessment that action in Iraq 
had been to demonstrate that American values are available to 
the entire world and not just the West, but Kuperwasser 
maintained that too much time was spent trying find other 
justifications for the invasion, such as the search for WMD. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
\"Our Experience Might Not Work For You\" 
--------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) On GOI counter-terrorism efforts, Kuperwasser said 
that his department and the IDF overall have \"great 
relations\" with their U.S. counterparts, sharing both methods 
and experience in the fight against terrorism.  Kuperwasser 
stressed, however, that the culture among U.S. intelligence 
agencies is vastly different from that in Israel, where 
Kuperwasser said that military intelligence and Shin Bet are 
\"hand in glove,\" despite disagreements and different overall 
strategic missions.  Shin Bet is tasked directly with 
fighting terror; military intelligence also fights terror, 
but looks at the wider regional threat, and develops the 
National Intelligence Assessment.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/22/2014 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KWBG, IS, GAZA DISENGAGEMENT, ECONOMY AND FINANCE, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS, SETTLEMENTS 
SUBJECT: PEACE NOW READY FOR DISENGAGEMENT, KEEPING AN EYE 
ON THE WEST BANK AND ANALYZING THE 2005 BUDGET 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C.  Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Yariv Oppenheimer, General Director of 
Peace Now, told Embassy economic officer on December 14 that 
his organization \"is very excited\" about the disengagement 
plan because it views settlements as a serious obstacle to 
peace.  While the settlers had not yet, at the time of the 
meeting, become very vocal in their opposition to evacuation, 
Oppenheimer predicted they will eventually get violent. 
However, he said, Peace Now will be ready with a campaign to 
counter the settlers\' opposition.  In the meantime, the 
organization continues monitoring settlement and outpost 
activity, and is preparing to poll settlers on their opinions 
of disengagement.  Oppenheimer also gave econoff Peace Now\'s 
preliminary assesment that the draft 2005 budget includes at 
least NIS 500 million for the settlements.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Revving Up for Disengagement 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Yariv Oppenheimer, General Director of Peace Now, 
told Embassy economic officer on December 14 that his 
organization is \"very excited about the prospect of getting 
rid of settlements.\"  In his view, building settlements has 
been the most problematic step Israel has undertaken, and 
represents an obstacle for peace to move forward. 
Oppenheimer explained that \"the Palestinians have to worry 
about terror, and we have to worry about settlements.\"  He 
related that Peace Now has met with the Yahad Party, Shimon 
Peres and the Labor Party, and signatories to the Geneva 
Initiative in order to establish the \"Majority Coalition.\" 
The Coalition wants to mobilize the 75 percent of the Israeli 
public who support disengagement to push the plan forward. 
The group will limit its activities to disengagement, and 
will not deal with refugees or other final status issues.  So 
far the group has organized two major rallies to keep the 
pro-disengagement momentum going, but, according to 
Oppenheimer, it has limited its activities because the 
settlers themselves have not been very vocal thus far and 
because \"the Right is surrendering to Sharon.\"  He predicted, 
however, that the settlers will resort to violence to 
dramatize the loss of their homes and thereby to get Israelis 
on their side.  Oppenheimer concluded that Gaza disengagement 
presents \"a very promising future\" and that Peace Now will be 
ready to take more action when it becomes necessary. 
 
------------------------------ 
Keeping Up with Other Projects 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) With respect to the West Bank, Oppenheimer 
acknowledged that new settlement and outpost construction has 
been much lower than he expected in recent months.  He said 
he had expected much more construction as Sharon tried to 
consolidate his hold on the West Bank.  Nevertheless, Peace 
Now continues its various projects as usual: 
 
Project 1:  Monitoring outposts; seeing how many are 
evacuated and which are expanded. 
 
Project 2:  Taking aerial photos every four months to measure 
growth of settlements and to determine where houses are being 
built; in conjunction, sending volunteers to do ground 
surveys to verify the photos.  Oppenheimer said a report of 
settlement activity in 2004 will be issued in January. 
 
Project 3:  Tracking housing tenders.  Oppenheimer noted 
there have not been as many this year as in years past but 
the GOI continues to issue tenders. 
 
Project 4:  Preparing a questionnaire to survey settlers\' 
opinions on disengagement.  Oppenheimer explained that Peace 
Now is currently developing the questions with the firm who 
will do the polling. 
 
-------------------- 
Analyzing the Budget 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C) According to Oppenheimer, one other project Peace Now 
has been working on recently is analyzing the draft 2005 
budget to determine how much money the GOI will spend next 
year to support the settlements.  He commented that this has 
been very difficult because the budget is not broken down 
into geographic regions and because the Ministry of Defense 
budget is classified.  Nevertheless, Peace Now\'s preliminary 
assessment is that the GOI is transferring close to NIS 500 
million to the settlements through the Ministries of 
Agriculture, Housing and Construction, Industry and Trade, 
and Transportation.  Oppenheimer opined that the GOI is 
currently investing in the territories at about the same rate 
as in years past, including the Gaza Strip, where it is 
treating the area \"like it is not going to be gone\" until 
disengagement actually begins. 
5.  (C) According to Peace Now\'s analysis of the draft 
budget, the Settlement Department of the Ministry of 
Agriculture has budgeted NIS 9.409 million to the central 
areas of the Jordan Valley, Megilot, Samaria, Binyamin and 
Gush Etzion, and has budgeted NIS 6.892 million to the 
southern areas of South Har Hebron and Gush Katif.  The 
Agriculture Ministry finances, among other things, 
maintenance of generators in temporary centers where there is 
no electricity, connections to the electricity network and 
investment in infrastructure.  Peace Now states that the 
Department also assists in financing the establishment of new 
outposts. 
 
6.  (C)  Oppenheimer said that the Ministry of Housing and 
Construction has a proposed budget of NIS 36.164 million for 
Maale Adumim and NIS 73 million for Homat Shmuel (Har Homa) 
to develop and market these sites; and NIS 90 million for 
rural building which includes planning, developing, 
rehabilitating and renovating infrastructure, and financing 
the establishment of public institutions.  Under the proposed 
2005 budget, the MOHC would also spend NIS 32 million on 
security in East Jerusalem, and will provide subsidized 
credit to purchase apartments worth almost NIS 1,000,000. 
 
7.  (C)  The Ministry of Industry and Trade has budgeted NIS 
13.097 million in grants and benefits for investment in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip.  The Ministry of Transportation is 
expected to spend NIS 17 million on the Gilo-Gush Etzion 
Road, NIS 12 million on the Brokin-Ariel Road 5, and NIS 198 
million on Road 45/1 Tsadi Mishor Adumim Road 90.  Peace Now 
notes that the budget for bypass roads is transferred to the 
Ministry of Defense and therefore there are no further 
details available on road construction. 
 
8.  (C)  In addition, Peace Now reports that the Ministries 
of Interior, Tourism and Education also provide grants and 
benefits to the settlements because they are part of National 
Priority Area A, but it did not provide any figures for these 
ministries. 
 
--------------------- 
...And Going to Court 
--------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Oppenheimer reported that Peace Now has petitioned 
the High Court to prevent leaders of the settlers\' YESHA 
council from using their municipalities\' funds to campaign 
against the disengagement plan.  He argued that settlers 
should not be using public money for these activities, and he 
expects a response from the government in the next two weeks.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media reported that during his visit to the region 
Wednesday British PM Tony Blair called for the 
cessation of Palestinian terrorism as a paramount need 
for the renewal of the peace process, and the provision 
by Israel of a diplomatic horizon.  The media reported 
that Blair nodded briefly toward Yasser Arafat\'s tomb 
in what Palestinian officials said was a compromise 
gesture agreed upon at the last minute. 
 
Leading media reported that IDF troops killed three 
Palestinians in the Khan Yunis refugee camp Wednesday, 
and that the IDF later left the city.  Israel Radio 
reported that this morning dozens of mortar shells were 
launched at Gaza Strip settlements.  All media reported 
that Palestinian gunmen killed an Israeli Bedouin who 
was guarding bulldozers near a planned section of the 
security fence in the southern Hebron hills.  Israel 
Radio reported that the police are close to solving the 
crime.  Leading media reported that the IDF has 
recently arrested a Palestinian couple, East Jerusalem 
residents, who planned to carry out a double suicide 
bombing at the Sbarro restaurant in Jerusalem where 15 
Israelis were killed in an August 2001 attack. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that most residents of the Pe\'at 
Sadeh settlement, in the Gaza Strip bloc of Gush Katif, 
have reached an agreement in principle with the 
Disengagement Administration for a collective move to 
Moshav Mavki\'im, south of Ashkelon, should 
disengagement go ahead.  Nigel Roberts, the World 
Bank\'s country director for the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip, was quoted as saying in an interview with 
Jerusalem Post that Israel is willing to consider the 
possibility of letting a third party take over at Gaza 
Strip naval and aerial ports after the disengagement 
plan is carried out. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Canada will send observers 
to the PA in the January 9 elections.  The station 
cited assessments that 600 foreign monitors will 
supervise the elections.  The media reported on the 
first local elections in the territories since 1976, 
which are being held today.  Jerusalem Post notes that 
Hamas-affiliated movements are presenting female 
candidates.  Jerusalem Post reported that Wednesday 
Israel handed over security control in Bethlehem to the 
Palestinians until January 19, ahead of Christmas 
celebrations in the city.  Israel Radio reported that 
PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will attend the 
Midnight Mass in the Nativity Church. 
 
Israel Radio quoted Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz as 
saying that he will not tolerate any attempt to 
stimulate sedition in the army.  Leading media reported 
that Wednesday former National Religious Party leader 
MK Effi Eitam called on settlers not to don orange 
Stars of David.  The media also cited an announcement 
by Yesha Council of Jewish Settlements in the 
Territories Wednesday that it has decided to oppose the 
use of force, the wearing of orange Stars of David, and 
the call to refuse among soldiers in the struggle 
against the disengagement plan.  Maariv and Israel 
Radio reported that right-wing 12 Knesset members have 
signed a pledge to be there for settlers on the day of 
their possible evacuation.  Yediot reported that 
hundreds of Lubavicher Hassids from New York are 
planning to come to Israel on an airlift, with the goal 
of bodily preventing the evacuation of Gush Katif. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Rabbi Yosef Alnekave, head of the 
Gush Katif Religious Council, as warning Wednesday on 
the right-wing radio Arutz Sheva (Arutz-7) that some 
settlers may begin manufacturing homemade bombs to fire 
at Palestinians unless the IDF succeeds in stopping the 
barrage of mortar shells fired daily at Gaza Strip 
settlements. 
 
In a paid ad in Ha\'aretz, Peace Now calls on Israelis 
to sign a pledge to volunteer to replace any soldier 
who will refuse to evacuate settlers. 
 
Ha\'aretz, Jerusalem Radio and Israel Radio reported 
that, \"Syrian-Turkey ties warmed up,\" as the PMs of the 
two countries signed a free-trade agreement in Damascus 
on Wednesday.  The media reported that Turkish PM Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan offered to broker Syrian-Israeli talks. 
Jerusalem Post and Israel Radio reported that, in an 
unprecedented transaction, Druze farmers in the Golan 
have received permission from Minister Mofaz to sell 
15,000 tons of apples to Syria. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Wednesday, calling the 
number of anti-Israel resolutions in the UN 
\"ridiculous,\" Dutch Ambassador to Israel Bob Hensch 
told reporters that the EU was committed to reducing 
those numbers. 
 
Extensively citing a Bloomberg article, Yediot details 
the assets the late PA chairman Yasser Arafat held 
around the world: USD 545 million in communication 
ventures in Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia, and USD 6.6 
million in business enterprises in the U.S.  (two 
software companies and a New York bowling alley). 
Ha\'aretz quoted political sources within the U.S. 
Democratic Party as saying that Sen. John Kerry (Mass.) 
will be visiting Israel and the PA early next month, as 
part of a larger Middle East tour.  The newspaper 
quoted Kerry\'s press secretary April Boyd as saying: 
\"The Senator\'s main goal will be to visit Iraq and 
thank U.S. troops and troops from Massachusetts,\" 
adding that Middle East peace is high on his agenda. 
 
Leading media reported that Iran announced Wednesday 
that its security services have arrested 10 persons 
suspected of revealing information regarding its 
nuclear program to the U.S. and Israeli intelligence 
agencies.  Maariv quoted Gen Mohammad Salimi, Iran\'s 
top army commander, as saying Wednesday that his 
country\'s military is on standby in case of an attack 
against its nuclear facilities. 
 
Yediot quoted Foreign Ministry D-G Ron Prosor as saying 
at the Herzliya Conference a few days ago that Israel\'s 
decision-making process is distorted because of the 
army\'s excessive influence on the political echelon. 
 
Citing Bloomberg, Jerusalem Post quoted Sudanese State 
Minister at the Interior Ministry Mohamed Ahmed Haroun 
as saying Wednesday in Khartoum that Israel is arming 
the rebels in Sudan\' western province of Darfur. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted visiting Harvard University 
President Larry Summers, a former U.S. secretary of the 
treasury, as saying Wednesday that demonization of 
Israel and anti-Semitic tension on American campuses 
has lessened considerably and that the divestment 
movement has dissipated.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Abu Mazen\'s Candies\" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (December 23): 
\"[Abu Mazen] already knows what everyone will know once 
he is elected: he cannot deliver the goods.  Abu Mazen 
planned to reach an agreement with the various 
Palestinian factions about a cease-fire, even a 
temporary one -- something between a cursory hudna 
[truce] and a fragile pledge of honor -- so as to allow 
him to begin negotiations from a position of personal 
power, and as someone capable of serving as a source of 
authority.... The answer he received from the Hamas 
representatives both in Damascus and in the territories 
was an unqualified no.... It is clear to all that 
[Hamas\'s] conditions are unacceptable, and their only 
purpose is to embarrass Abu Mazen and to cast him as 
impotent.... It is clear to Hamas that a resumption of 
terror attacks will embarrass Abu Mazen even before the 
elections, and that those terror attacks could have an 
immediate strategic impact.  As such, the chances of 
Abu Mazen successfully achieving a comprehensive 
Palestinian cease-fire agreement are slim.  Israel, 
which had hoped for a successful and coordinated 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, for good will gestures, 
for opening the seaport and many other things, could 
find itself facing disengagement under fire, 
irrespective of the Palestinian Authority, which could 
go back to being irrelevant.  Given the current 
development of circumstances, that ought to be the 
IDF\'s working assumption as it prepares for 
disengagement, and not any of those optimistic 
assumptions about \'windows of opportunity,\' that have 
been reported by senior cabinet ministers.\" 
 
 
 
II.  \"The Palestinians Understand that the Landlord 
Lives in Washington\" 
 
Regional affairs writer Arnon Regular opined in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 23): \"Even 
after Blair\'s visit, the Palestinians have no tangible 
calendar for the road map.  It is obvious to them that 
the Palestinian state will not be established during 
2005, and they harbor no expectations about Blair\'s 
summit conferences.  Contrary to the way British 
officials have presented the London conference, the 
Palestinians would be hard-pressed to describe it as 
anything beyond a \'meeting\'.... More than once during 
the last year of Arafat\'s life, the Palestinian 
Authority has described the British policy as the 
\'continuation of the Balfour Declaration\'  -- an 
Israeli-British plot behind the Palestinians\' back. 
During Arafat\'s life the Palestinians understood -- and 
continue to do so now -- that the real focal point of 
decision is not in London, and that the person who will 
determine Abu Mazen\'s future ahead of permanent-status 
agreements is not Blair, but Bush.\" 
 
III.  \"How Iraq Changed Tony Blair\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote in page one 
of conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (December 
23): \"Blair\'s brief trip to Iraq [on the day of the 
lethal attack against U.S. troops in Mosul] left its 
impact.  Just how great an impact was apparent well 
beyond Blair\'s condolences.  It was apparent in his 
unequivocal words about fighting terrorism and creating 
democracy, and in his comments about the diplomatic 
process here.... Israel\'s eventual embrace of the 
conference [promoted by Blair], even though it will not 
attend, was the result of assurances that the meeting 
will not deal with the peace process, but only with 
Palestinian reform, and also assurances that Blair -- 
during his visit to Israel -- would speak out 
forcefully against terrorism.  Blair lived up to his 
side of the bargain.... Blair, while in Iraq, framed 
the current fight there as \'very clearly a battle 
between democracy and terror.\'  It\'s obvious that you 
can\'t say that in Baghdad one day, and say something 
completely different in Jerusalem the next.  Blair, to 
his credit, was consistent in his message: Iraq\'s new 
rules need to apply here as well.  The new rules also 
apply in respect to the viability of the Palestinian 
state.  Blair charted new ground for a European leader 
by intimating that a Palestinian state is not an end in 
and of itself, and that its viability goes beyond the 
usual catch-phrases of territorial contiguity and 
economic independence.\" 
IV.  \"The Mask is Torn\" 
Liberal op-ed writer Yael Paz-Melamed commented in 
popular, pluralist Maariv (December 23): \"That\'s it. 
The mask has been torn off.... An enormous chasm -- a 
chasm of culture, of values -- yawns between a majority 
of the Israeli public and the settlers.  The talk about 
a majority of the Israeli public is based on repeated 
public opinion polls that establish that more than two- 
thirds of the public supports evacuating settlements 
for peace, even unilaterally.  But they don\'t care 
about that.  The concept of \'majority\' is a democratic 
concept.  The settlers\' authority stems not from that, 
but from Halacha [Jewish religious law].  The entire 
Land of Israel is sacred and so on and so forth.... We 
are not fellow member of the same people.  We are two 
peoples, despite the reciprocal responsibility that was 
forced upon us against our will.  We, that public 
defined earlier, foot the bill for the activities of 
the minority working against us, sacrifice our sons to 
protect them, keep any chance for peace out of reach 
because of their settlement in Arab population centers, 
but they don\'t even appreciate that.  For some of them, 
we are like the Nazi regime, and have come to expel 
them from their homes.  And we are financing even that 
sick campaign, and we reconcile ourselves even to that 
-- because in our democracy, freedom of speech is a 
supreme value.  And they look at us, and they know 
precisely where our weak spots are, and they exploit it 
for their own gain.  And everything, of course, is in 
the name of God and the Torah.\" 
 
V.  \"Not a Refusal to Serve -- But a Rupture\" 
 
Settler leader Israel Harel wrote in Ha\'aretz (December 
23): \"The phenomenon of refusal [to serve military 
orders] was not created by the Council of Jewish 
Settlements in Judea, Samaria and Gaza [i.e. the 
territories]; on the contrary, it opposed it with all 
its might.  The one responsible for it more than anyone 
else is none other than the Prime Minister.  He decided 
to uproot the Gaza settlements, and is forcing the 
army, even at the cost of a possible rupture in its 
ranks, to carry out his decision by force.  It is 
toward him, as well as toward the Defense Minister who 
also -- mirabile dictu -- made a complete about-face, 
that the Chief of Staff should direct his accusations. 
An army -- certainly the IDF -- cannot prevail over 
tens of thousands of its own people by force.  If the 
settlers decide to respond like the citizenry of the 
Ukraine -- if they come in large force for a long-term, 
nonviolent struggle -- no government can prevail over 
them.  Ukraine has proved that it is enough for a few 
thousand determined and persistent demonstrators, who 
are undeterred by threats and provocations, to effect a 
profound change.\"

\"The Neighborhood Bully\" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer and the late prime minister 
Yitzhak Rabin\'s assistant Eytan Haber opined in an 
editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (December 23): \"The latest reports that the 
U.S. has warned Israel not to send back to China spare 
parts for attack drones that Beijing purchased in the 
past ought to worry and perhaps shock Israelis.  But 
perhaps not.... The Americans feel that they own the 
world and certainly the State of Israel, and their word 
is law.... From their point of view, the Israelis and 
the Chinese can both go jump in the lake.... Israel has 
promised not to harm the vital security interests of 
the United States and is honoring that promise.  But 
the Pentagon officials don\'t care.  They intend to show 
us who is boss.  The neighborhood bully has taken to 
the streets and all the children are running for cover. 
In the Pentagon today there is a group that is in 
distress.  They are Jews, they are senior and they are 
accused of pushing the United States into the 
superfluous and muddled war in Iraq in order to help 
Israel.  This group is trying to get rid of its Israeli 
taint and it trying to pin the blame on Israel.  Anyone 
with eyes in his head knows how dependant Israel is on 
the United States for everything -- in defense, in 
world politics and for its economy.  In Israel today 
only the air is free (and it is polluted enough).  Over 
everything else, for better or worse, America is in 
control.  What the Americans are trying to do is to 
twist the arms of mighty China and little Israel.  The 
problem is that from Israel\'s point of view it is 
always worthwhile to let the neighborhood bully win.\"

TAGS: PREL, PARM, IS, GOI EXTERNAL, MILITARY RELATIONS 
SUBJECT: ISRAELI REASSURANCES ON NONPROLIFERATION SECTION 
OF THE EU-ISRAEL ACTION PLAN 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Israeli officials told the Ambassador on 
December 22 that the nonproliferation section of the 
EU-Israel plan of action under the framework of the European 
Neighborhood Policy (ENP) contained \"absolutely nothing new.\" 
 They described the plan as another attempt by the EU to lock 
Israel into a process and undermine other fora such as the 
Arms Control and Regional Security group.  Israel had agreed 
to the text because of beneficial provisions elsewhere in the 
plan (e.g., economic cooperation and combating 
anti-Semitism).  Israeli officials said they would resist 
changes to their nonproliferation policy, even if this stance 
results in delays to the ENP process.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) During a meeting on December 22, Israel Atomic Energy 
Commission (IAEC) Director General Gideon Frank, his 
Principal Deputy for Policy Eli Levite, and Director for Arms 
Control Merav Zafary briefed the Ambassador and poloffs on 
the nonproliferation section of the EU-Israel action plan. 
They also discussed Iran and the upcoming IAEA forum on 
experience with nuclear-weapon-free zones (septels). 
 
3. (C) Levite said that the Israeli cabinet had recently 
discussed the nonproliferation section of the text of the 
joint EU-Israel plan of action under the framework of the 
European Neighborhood Policy (ENP).  PM Sharon had explicitly 
asked the IAEC to inform the USG that there is \"absolutely 
nothing new\" in Israel\'s arms control policy, despite what 
some EU members may say.  In Levite\'s analysis, the EU is 
trying to lock Israel into \"some sort of process\" on arms 
control.  He said Israel\'s clear preference is to work these 
issues with the USG or on its own. 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador asked if the EU shared Israel\'s 
interpretation of the action plan.  Frank replied, \"some of 
them do.\"  He noted that the chapeau of the nonproliferation 
section (text available under http://europa.eu.int) clearly 
states that the two sides will develop their dialogue in the 
context of both EU strategy and \"Israel\'s vision of the 
long-term goals of regional security and arms control process 
in the Middle East.\" 
 
5. (C) Levite speculated that the Europeans are looking for 
creative ways to revive the Barcelona process.  He said the 
EU also intends to supersede the Arms Control and Regional 
Security (ACRS) process -- something Israel would not allow. 
Nevertheless, FM Shalom had told the cabinet that the action 
plan contained many points that would benefit Israel, so the 
government had approved the text. 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador asked if possible differing 
interpretations of the nonproliferation section could 
eventually cause difficulties for Israel in the ENP process. 
Levite said it would be a \"political judgment\" by the EU on 
whether the action plan commits Israel to certain steps.  His 
view was that the plan contained enough scope for progress in 
other areas that the two sides could move forward.  He noted, 
however, that Israel would not take nonproliferation steps 
that were against its own interests, even if this stance 
results in delays to the ENP process.

Atomic Energy Commission told the Ambassador on December 22 
that the ground rules and agenda for the upcoming IAEA forum 
on nuclear-weapon-free zones reflect understandings between 
Israel and the IAEA.  The only outstanding issue is that DG 
El-Baradei wants the forum to be a more public platform that 
would include the Arab League as an observer.  Israel has 
urged the IAEA to view the forum as \"a one-time educational 
event\" that will have only an \"intellectual\" outcome.  Israel 
will be represented at the working level.  END SUMMARY.

3. (C) Levite said that the ground rules and agenda for the 
forum reflect understandings between Israel and the IAEA.  He 
said the Israeli view is that the IAEA has no role to play in 
this area, but that Israel wanted to make a \"very modest 
gesture of good will.\"  The only outstanding issue is that DG 
El-Baradei wants a more public platform that would include 
the Arab League as an observer.  The Israelis see Arab League 
participation as \"very difficult\" and \"not consistent with 
the learning process.\"  Levite said that Israel would speak 
to El-Baradei to urge him to structure the event in a manner 
that does not adversely affect the NPT RevCon. 
 
4. (C) Israel has urged the IAEA to view the forum as \"a 
one-time educational event.\"  Levite said the outcome should 
be \"intellectual\" without any concrete deliverables.  Israel 
would not send high-level participants, but would probably be 
represented by Director for Arms Control Merav Zafary and 
Ambassador to the IAEA Israel Michaeli.  Frank added that he 
did not think the Israeli delegation would speak, but a 
decision had not yet been taken.

SUBJECT: ISRAELI MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT VIEWS ON GAZA 
DISENGAGEMENT 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 6442 (NOTAL) 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor William Weinstein, reasons 1.4 (b) an 
d (d). 
 
This message has been cleared with Consulate General 
Jerusalem. 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The Israeli Ministry of Environment has 
begun to focus on critical environmental issues related to 
disengagement from Gaza.  Ministry officials believe that 
unless there is close coordination among Israeli ministries 
and between Israeli and Palestinian officials, there will be 
negative environmental and health consequences for both 
Israelis and Gaza residents after disengagement.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) MK Ilan Shalgi, until recently the Minister of 
Environment, told ESTH Officer on margins of an environmental 
film festival December 9 that he had convened a meeting on 
December 3, his last day in office, to consider the 
environmental consequences of Gaza disengagement.  He 
referred ESTH Officer to MoE DG Miki Haran for more details 
on MoE thinking.  MoE International Affairs Director Ori 
Livne, acting on instructions from DG Haran, subsequently 
sent ESTHoff a summary of the Ministry\'s internal 
deliberations.  Livne noted that a report in the December 10 
Hebrew language newspaper \"Yediot Musaf\" provided additional 
detail on the MoE\'s discussions. 
 
3. (C) According to the summary provided to Embassy, the 
Ministry is concerned that if disengagement happens without 
coordination, the potential exists for the following 
environmental \"problems and nuisances\": 
 
-- Untreated wastewater flowing to the Mediterranean and 
polluting the desalination plant in Ashkelon; 
-- Untreated wastewater polluting aquifers that provide 
drinking water to the population and for agricultural needs; 
-- Open dumps for municipal solid waste causing air pollution 
and nesting grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes and flies; 
-- Untreated industrial waste and wastewater; and 
-- Untreated hazardous waste from industry and hospitals, 
\"etc.\" 
 
4. (C) The Ministry\'s discussions focused on the need for 
coordination among GOI officials in the following areas: 
 
-- Construction and Demolition Waste:  If settlement 
buildings and infrastructure are destroyed, there will be 
large quantities of waste.  MoE believes this waste must be 
treated properly, i.e. shredded and re-used or landfilled. 
(Note: The Palestinian Authority may push for the rubble from 
GOI-demolished structures to be removed before the handover. 
End note.) 
-- The Relocation of \"New\" Army Bases:  Bases currently 
located in Gaza that will have to be moved to Israel should 
not add unneeded infrastructure and roads, but should be 
located near existing towns and villages to preserve open 
spaces and nature reserves. 
-- Relocation of Civilians:  Relocations should take place 
according to the National Master Plan.  New settlements 
should not be built; existing settlements (within Israel) 
should be strengthened and enlarged according to existing 
development plans. 
 
5. (U) The article in \"Yediot Musaf\" said Ministry officials 
estimated the cost of handling the debris from settlements 
following the departure of about 8,000 settlers from Gaza and 
600 from \"Northern Samaria\" would be about 85 million NIS 
(approximately USD 20 million).  Some in the MoE discussion 
questioned whether homes should be destroyed at all, given 
the complexities of disposing of the debris.  The discussions 
identified various alternatives for disposal.  Ministry 
officials assumed that industrial installations will be 
transferred to the Palestinians \"with the brokering and 
financing of international bodies.\" 
 
6. (U) According to the article, Shalgi stressed the 
importance of minimizing damage to water, sewage, electricity 
and road infrastructure.  The discussion also identified the 
importance of future handling of sewage within Gaza. 
Hazardous and radioactive substances could become ticking 
time bombs unless identified and handled properly.  Ministry 
officials opposed the creation of new settlements in the 
Negev, which already has problems of handling sewage and dry 
garbage. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  The environmental issues related to Gaza 
disengagement are daunting, and will require close 
coordination among Israeli ministries and between Israeli and 
Palestinian officials.  The MoE discussion represent a 
starting point in addressing a wide range of serious 
environmental concerns.  End comment.

1. (SBU) Summary:  Israeli Ministry of Environment officials 
hope to work closely with the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to make progress on some of Israel\'s most challenging 
environment problems.  Those include:  asbestos and 
hazardous waste cleanups, emergency preparedness, water 
security, and coastal management.  MoE is prepared to 
discuss funding arrangements with EPA.  Israel has new 
legislation on coastal management and the handling of 
biosolids.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) NEA Senior S&T Advisor Charles Lawson, accompanied 
by ESTH Officer, met December 6 with MoE Director General 
Miki Haran, Senior Deputy DG for Policy and Planning Valerie 
Brachya, and International Relations Director Ori Livne. 
Those officials stated that they would like to draw on the 
EPA\'s experience and expertise to help address some of 
Israel\'s toughest environmental problems. 
 
3. (SBU) The MoE officials identified the following areas 
for potential cooperation with the EPA: 
 
-- Asbestos Cleanups:  Israel is facing both \"tear-downs and 
tear-outs,\" is looking to \"train trainers,\" and could use 
assistance in certifying asbestos inspectors. 
 
-- Emergency Preparedness and First Responder Planning and 
Training:  MoE has made a lot of progress on responding to 
hazardous substances incidents, including marine-related 
incidents, but would welcome the opportunity to compare 
experiences with the EPA. 
 
-- Hazardous Waste Handling:  The cleanup effort at the 
Ramat Hovav hazardous waste disposal site in the Negev is 
proceeding, but there is much more to be done.  The effort 
generates its own cash flow as companies looking to dispose 
of hazardous wastes are charged according to a set fee 
structure.  Related international tenders will be made 
public \"soon.\" 
 
-- Water Security:  The MoE is interested in comparing 
experiences with EPA on water supply security and other 
homeland security areas in which the EPA has involvement. 
 
-- Coastal Management:  MoE officials are interested in U.S. 
policymaking related to coastal erosion. 
 
4. (SBU) The MoE officials noted that Israel is moving 
forward to implement new legislation to protect the 
environment, including a coastal management law and another 
on the handling of biosolids.  The latter will go into 
effect over the next two years, under the guidance of a 
committee with representatives from the Water Commission and 
the Ministries of Health, Agriculture, and Environment.  One 
aim will be to treat all water to a minimum level 
appropriate for agricultural use.  Higher treatment 
standards will add a few cents per cubic meter to the cost 
of water.  The GOI is moving towards decisions on new 
treatment standards, including for removal of salt and brine 
at the water source.  On coastal management, a key concern 
is erosion due to decreases in the amount of sand carried up 
the coast by prevailing currents. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment:  As DG Haran noted, environmental 
consciousness is becoming more popular, both among the 
public and politicians.  The Knesset Environmental Caucus is 
now a strong group, with multi-party representation, she 
said.  MoE staff \"used to be seen as extremists,\" but are 
now in the middle.  Green groups are learning they can get 
more traction by linking environmental and social issues, 
e.g. public use of open spaces.  In this period of new 
momentum to protect the environment, MoE is eager to take 
advantage of EPA\'s deep experience with the tough cleanup 
challenges Israel is facing.   International Relations 
Director Livne said that the Ministry could make funding 
available to support work by EPA to help Israel solve key 
environmental problems like asbestos and hazardous waste 
cleanups, including by drawing from waste-handling fees 
charged to firms for the disposition of hazardous wastes. 
Livne commented that in some areas, especially hazardous 
waste disposal, \"Israel definitely needs help and can\'t do 
it alone.\"

SUBJECT: ISRAEL: 2004 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 245841 
 
This cable has been cleared with ConGen Jerusalem. 
 
1.  (SBU) Post provides below additional information to be 
used in preparation of the 2004 \"Patterns of Global 
Terrorism\" report. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Bilateral and Multilateral Cooperation 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Israel has been among the staunchest supporters of 
the global war against terrorism (GWOT), and in 2004 the GOI 
continued to engage in numerous activities jointly with the 
U.S. to increase preparedness and to identify suspects. 
Israel is working with U.S. law enforcement agencies to 
purchase and install equipment to read and share biometric 
fingerprint information with the United States and has 
carried out numerous joint training exercises with U.S. 
security and military personnel.  The GOI has also made 
known, both through its contacts with the United Nations 
Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and through its bilateral 
relationships, its willingness to share its expertise in 
counter-terrorism with other countries.  Israel and United 
States are also working on 22 joint projects in 2004 to 
develop improved security-related technology under the TSWG 
program.  The USG and the GOI regularly share intelligence on 
terror suspects and organizations. 
 
------------------------------- 
Major Counter-Terrorism Actions 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) As it has been for many years, but in particular 
since the outbreak of the al-Aqsa Intifada in 2000, host 
nation law enforcement is heavily engaged in identifying and 
thwarting terrorist attacks.  Public support for government 
efforts to combat domestic terrorism remain consistently 
high.  In 2004, the GOI continued construction of the 
separation barrier between the West Bank and Green Line 
Israel, with Israeli security agencies reporting a notably 
lower number of terror attacks inside Israel as a result of 
its construction and a simultaneous improvement in 
coordination among security forces.  Although the route of 
the barrier remains controversial, and has been changed in 
response to Israeli High Court rulings, Israeli public 
opinion remains strongly supportive of its construction. 
 
4.  (SBU) The IDF, the Israeli Border and National Police 
Forces, and Shin Bet all operate throughout Israel and the 
Occupied Territories to gather and coordinate intelligence, 
and then to physically counter prospective terrorist attacks, 
particularly suicide bombings inside Israel.  Once 
intelligence indicates that a terrorist is making his way 
towards Israel in order to carry out an attack, Israeli 
police mobilize all necessary actors to track, isolate, and 
capture or kill the terrorist before he can strike his 
target.  Israel also continued its policy of targeted 
killings of Palestinian militants.  In March, helicopter 
gunships successfully targeted the founder and spiritual 
leader of Hamas, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, as he was leaving a 
mosque in the Gaza Strip.  The following month, Israeli 
helicopter gunships fired missiles that killed Yasin\'s 
successor, Abd al-Aziz al-Rantisi, while he was traveling by 
car in Gaza. 
 
5.  (SBU) In February 2004, the IDF and the Israeli Security 
Agency (Shin Bet) bypassed both GOI internal mechanisms and a 
GOI-Palestinian coordination mechanisms established in 2003 
and raided the West Bank offices of the Arab Bank and the 
Cairo-Amman Bank, seizing some $9 million in funds that the 
GOI claimed were destined for terrorist groups.  Much of 
these funds originated from Hizballah, according to GOI 
claims.  The GOI stated that it resorted to the raid only 
after the PA had failed to act on earlier actionable 
intelligence, and that Israeli law does not allow seizure of 
funds via correspondent bank accounts in Israel.  The funds 
remain seized by order of an Israeli court until their 
disposition can be determined. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Legal and Law Enforcement Capabilities 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Israel has a range of laws in place that allow the 
GOI to combat terrorism and prosecute those accused of 
committing terrorist acts, including several laws regulating 
terrorist finance.  Palestinians accused of security-related 
offenses are generally tried in Israeli military courts; 
serious offenses are tried before a three-judge panel and 
lesser offenses before a single judge.  Occasionally, 
individuals accused of carrying out terrorist attacks are 
tried in Israeli civil court in the jurisdiction where the 
attack occurred.  In March 2004, Marwan Barghuti was 
convicted in Tel Aviv District Court, after a two-year 
detention and trial period, on three charges of murder 
involving terror attacks that took the lives of five Israelis 
and a fourth charge of attempted murder.  Barghuti was 
sentenced to five consecutive life terms, plus 40 years in 
prison.  Although Barghuti\'s charge sheet included alleged 
actions as the head of both Tanzim and the al-Aqsa Martyrs\' 
Brigades in the West Bank and all of the terrorist acts these 
groups had carried out from 2000-2002, he was acquitted on 33 
of the 39 charges against him because prosecutors failed to 
make the case that he had had a specific personal connection 
to them.  Barghuti argued that the court lacked jurisdiction 
and therefore refused to rebut the specific allegations. 
 
7.  (SBU) Israeli security forces have the authority to tap 
phones or otherwise monitor private communication only when 
granted by a court order, although publicized investigations 
have uncovered several instances of unauthorized 
wire-tapping.  When granted, the court order allows for the 
information to be used in court.  The prosecution must 
justify closing the proceedings to the public in security 
cases, and the Attorney General determines the venue.  Courts 
may hear secret evidence in security cases that is not 
available to the defendant or his attorney.  While a 
conviction may not be based solely on such evidence, it 
reportedly may influence the judge\'s decision.  The law 
prohibits the admission of forced confessions as evidence. 
Most confessions in security cases before Israeli courts, 
however, were made well before legal representation was made 
available to the defendant. 
 
8.  (SBU) Israeli Military Order 1507 (applicable to 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza) permits the IDF to 
detain people for up to 10 days during which detainees are 
barred from seeing a lawyer or appearing before a court. 
Individual administrative detention orders can be issued for 
up to six-month periods and can renewed indefinitely. 
Israeli Military Order 1369 (applicable to Palestinians in 
the West Bank and Gaza) provides for a seven-year prison term 
for anyone who does not respond to a special summons issued 
to anyone suspected of involvement in or with knowledge of 
security offenses.  A detainee may not have contact with a 
lawyer until after interrogation, a process that may last 
days or weeks.  According to Israeli law in the occupied 
territories, a person\'s family must be notified of that 
person\'s arrest within 48 hours, although a military 
commander may delay that notification for up to 12 days.  As 
of December 2004, there were some 8,152 Palestinian security 
detainees and an additional 930 Palestinians were held in 
administrative detention. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Background Information on Designated Terrorist Organizations 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Palestinian terrorist groups continue to focus 
their attention on the Palestinians\' historical conflict with 
Israel, attacking Israel and Israeli interests within Israel 
and the Palestinian territories, rather than engaging in 
operations worldwide.  In 2004, a notable increase occurred 
in joint operations by terrorist organizations carrying out 
attacks against Israel and Israelis. 
 
10.  (U) The following is background information on 
Designated Foreign Terrorist Groups.  Embassy Tel Aviv has 
cleared on ConGen language for the al-Aqsa Martyrs\' Brigades, 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command (PFLP-GC). 
 
-- Hamas: Formed in late 1987 as an outgrowth of the 
Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.  Various Hamas 
elements have used both violent and political means -- 
including terrorism -- to pursue the goal of establishing an 
Islamic Palestinian state in Israel.  Hamas is loosely 
structured, with some elements working clandestinely and 
others openly through mosques and social service institutions 
to recruit members, raise money, organize activities, and 
distribute propaganda.  Hamas\'s strength is concentrated in 
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.  In 2004, Hamas has been 
the primary initiator of Qassam rocket attacks from the Gaza 
Strip against Israeli targets. 
 
-- Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ): Originated among militant 
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip during the late 1970\'s. 
Committed to the creation of an Islamic Palestinian state and 
the destruction of Israel through holy war.  Also opposes 
moderate Arab governments that it believes have been tainted 
by Western secularism.  PIJ operates in the West Bank, Gaza 
and Israel; its leadership resides in Syria and Lebanon as 
well as other parts of the Middle East. 
 
-- Kahane Chai/Kach: Stated goal is to restore the biblical 
state of Israel.  Kach (founded by the late radical 
Israeli-American rabbi, Meir Kahane) and its offshoot Kahane 
Chai, which means \"Kahane Lives,\" (founded by Meir Kahane\'s 
son Binyamin following his father\'s assassination in the 
United States) were declared terrorist organizations in March 
1994 by the Israeli Cabinet under the 1948 Terrorism Law. 
This designation followed the groups\' statement in support of 
Dr. Baruch Goldstein\'s deadly attack on Muslim worshipers in 
February 1994 on al-Ibrahimi Mosque -- Goldstein was 
affiliated with Kach -- and the group\'s verbal attacks on the 
Israeli government.  Palestinian gunmen killed Binyamin 
Kahane and his wife in a drive-by shooting in December 2000 
in the West Bank.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
On Monday, all media bannered the deadly tsunami that 
hit South Asian coasts on Sunday, saying that dozens of 
Israelis in the area are unaccounted for, especially in 
southern Thailand, India, and Sri Lanka.  Israel Radio 
cited the Foreign Ministry as saying that some 500 
Israelis known to have been in the affected areas still 
have not called home.  Leading media reported that, 
responding to a call by Sri Lanka\'s President to the 
international community, Israel has dispatched a 
medical team to that country. 
 
On Sunday, Maariv reported that the isolated Gaza Strip 
settlement of Netzarim will be evacuated first. 
Leading media quoted Yonatan Bassi, the head of the 
Disengagement Administration, as confirming Sunday that 
all 20 families from the Pe\'at Sadeh settlement in the 
Gaza Strip will relocate to Moshav Mavki\'im south of 
Ashkelon by May 21.  Bassi said that five families from 
additional settlements will move to Mavki\'im.  Ha\'aretz 
reported that the Knesset\'s Constitution, Law and 
Justice Committee decided to delete the punitive 
clauses in the proposed Evacuation Compensation Bill, 
which sets out the financial recompense to be offered 
to settlers who evacuate their homes in the Katif Bloc 
(Gush Katif) and northern West Bank under the 
disengagement plan.  On Sunday, Yediot reported that 
following a decision by the Knesset\'s Constitution, Law 
and Justice Committee Chairman MK Michael Eitan, the 
government will be forced to convene in January and 
notify the Gush Katif settlers six months in advance of 
the precise evacuation date of their settlements. 
Ha\'aretz reported that approximately 30 Thai workers 
out of the 400 employed in the Katif Bloc have left the 
area since last week. 
 
On Sunday, all media quoted Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) 
as saying Saturday that the Palestinians demand a full 
Israeli withdrawal from the territories, including East 
Jerusalem, and that they \"will not accept settlements, 
and that includes Ma\'aleh Adumim, the Etzion Bloc, and 
Ariel.\"  Abbas also said that he will not use force 
against Hamas, that there will be no peace without the 
release of all jailed Palestinians, including Tanzim 
leader Marwan Barghouti, and that he will follow in 
Yasser Arafat\'s footsteps.  (Yediot headlined: \"Arafat, 
Model 2005.\")  However, Abbas said he was extending his 
hands in peace.  FM Silvan Shalom was quoted as saying 
in an interview with Israel Radio that he is 
disappointed by Abbas\'s remarks. 
All media reported that Sunday the cabinet unanimously 
approved a series of measures meant to facilitate the 
elections for PA chairmanship on January 9.  Leading 
media cited international pressure as the reason for 
these steps.  Israel Radio reported that this morning 
Israel released 159 Palestinian prisoners, in a gesture 
to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.  Jerusalem Post 
reported that some 600 prominent Palestinians have 
called for an end to armed attacks on Israel and urged 
the PA to push for democratic reforms.  The appeal was 
made in an open letter to the Palestinian leadership 
published in Palestinian newspapers on Sunday. 
 
On Sunday, leading media reported that Hamas racked up 
significant achievements in Thursday\'s elections for 
local councils in the West Bank: out of 26 races, Hamas 
won seven to nine [sources varied], and Fatah won in 12 
local authorities.  On Monday, Ha\'aretz reported that 
on Sunday the PA announced the official results of last 
Thursday\'s municipal elections, but that it declined to 
give a breakdown as to how many of the winning 
candidates belonged to Fatah as opposed to Hamas. 
 
On Sunday, all media reported that following the 
internal Labor Party elections, MK Ophir Pines-Paz is 
slated to become interior minister; MK Yitzhak Herzog 
will get the national infrastructure portfolio; MK 
Shalom Simhon will be environment minister; and Knesset 
members Matan Vilnai and Haim Ramon will be ministers 
without portfolio.  Leading media reported that Sunday 
an interministerial committee approved a bill proposal 
that would allow Shimon Peres to become PM Sharon\'s 
second deputy. 
 
On Friday, Jerusalem Post quoted a senior U.S. 
administration official as saying that the U.S. is 
contemplating incursions into Syrian territory in an 
attempt to kill or capture Iraqi Ba\'athists who it 
believes are directing at least part of the attacks 
against U.S. targets in Iraq. 
 
Israel Radio quoted senior GOI sources as saying that 
opponents of the disengagement plan are expected to 
come to settlements slated for evacuation in order to 
bolster them.  On Sunday, Yediot reported that for the 
first time a soldier who is a \"disengagement objector\" 
has been removed from an officers\' training course. 
 
On Sunday, Jerusalem Post reported that the Bush 
administration is blaming Israel for undermining its 
sustained diplomatic efforts to persuade Europe not to 
resume arms sales to China.  The newspaper quoted a 
senior administration official as saying: \"Something is 
going badly wrong in the military relationship\" between 
Israel and the U.S.\"  Jerusalem Post further quoted him 
as saying that the dispute can now only be resolved \"at 
a high level.\" 
On Friday, Jerusalem Post reported on anti-Israel hate 
programs being broadcasted on Iranian TV. 
 
Leading media reported that hundreds of settlers from 
the areas to be evacuated demonstrated Sunday near the 
Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv, disrupting traffic in the 
city\'s center.  They were protesting against what they 
view as the army\'s lack of response to mortar attacks 
on Gaza Strip settlements and western Negev 
communities. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that IDF soldiers north of the 
Kissufim crossing in Katif Bloc shot and killed two 
Palestinians they feared were planning to launch a 
bombing attack before dawn on Sunday.  The media 
reported that IDF troops killed a deputy of Al-Aqsa 
Martyrs Brigades Zakaria Zubeidi commander and three 
other Fatah militants in Jenin during the weekend. 
 
All media reported that Sunday the Tel Aviv District 
Court indicted leftist activist Tali Fahima on charges 
of aiding the enemy in wartime, transmitting 
information to the enemy, contact with the foreign 
agent, illegal possession of a firearm, support for a 
terror group, and contravening a legal order. 
According to the indictment, Fahima helped operatives 
of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades evade capture by the 
IDF by translating a secret IDF document involving an 
arrest operation for Zubeidi. 
 
Hatzofe cited an interview Yuval Steinitz, the chairman 
of the Knesset\'s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, 
gave to the newspaper of the organization of IDF 
handicapped, in which he reportedly said that the 
extensive training of Egyptian forces and the fact that 
Egypt does not prevent large-scale arms smuggling into 
the Gaza Strip indicate that Egypt plans to wage war 
against Israel. 
 
On Sunday, Yediot cited a recommendation by a GOI- 
appointed committee that Israeli Arabs perform a stint 
of national service. 
 
Leading media reported that the police arrested nuclear 
whistleblower Mordecai Vanunu on Christmas Eve, as he 
attempted to attend the Midnight Mass in Bethlehem. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that two firebombs were thrown early 
Sunday at the Hassan Bek mosque south of the Tel Aviv 
beach promenade.  The Mosque serves Jaffa\'s Muslim 
population. 
Ha\'aretz reported that the Interior Ministry decided 
this weekend that children of illegal foreign workers 
and their families will not be deported over the next 
few months, but that they will instead be given visa 
extensions until March 1. 
 
Jerusalem Post reports that the private Israeli airline 
Israir expects to earn revenue of USD 25 million from 
flights from Tel Aviv to New York, which it will resume 
in late March.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"The Right To Uproot and the Right of Return\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 27): \"The 
obsessive highlighting of the danger of the \'rupture in 
the people\' (or the \'unity of the people,\' as the Prime 
Minister put it in his Herzliya speech), transformed 
the disengagement plan into a dispute between right and 
left.  As if none of this had anything to do with 
Palestinians, or might have any effect on the situation 
on the other side of the Green Line.... [Nonetheless,] 
the disengagement plan has already made an important 
contribution to peace between Israel and Palestinians. 
The response of the settlers to the intention to 
evacuate a handful of settlements in the Gaza Strip, 
which subsist on Thai labor, and four shriveled 
settlements in Samaria [the northern West Bank], has 
pulled the thin veneer from the hard nut that is the 
settlers.  Let every Jewish mother and every Israeli 
father who are sending their children to defend a 
settlement know that they have raised them to fight in 
a war commanded in God\'s name.\" 
 
II.  \"Welcome Intervention\" 
 
Ha\'aretz editorialized (December 24): \"British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair\'s efforts to muster international 
support for rebuilding the Palestinian Authority are an 
appropriate form of external intervention for the sake 
of toning down the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and 
restarting the diplomatic process.... International 
support is important on several levels: to strengthen 
the new Palestinian president who will soon be elected, 
to raise money to finance the PA\'s activities and 
economic development in the territories, and to 
reorganize the Palestinian security services. 
International support also has domestic importance in 
helping leaders to take unpopular steps.  This has 
already happened in Israel: Sharon used the letter of 
commitments that he received in April from U.S. 
President George W. Bush to help him overcome 
opposition to the disengagement plan in the Likud and 
isolate the settlers\' lobby.... Sharon acted wisely 
when he reached an understanding with Blair over the 
terms of the international conference in London, 
despite his opposition in principle to Israel\'s 
participation in it.  He thereby enabled this visit by 
the leader of a friendly country, who emphasizes his 
deep commitment to Israel\'s security at every 
opportunity, to be crowned with success.  Now, the ball 
is in the Palestinians\' court: They will have to do 
their part and prove that they are able to bring about 
the necessary changes in the PA.\" 
 
III.  \"Turning Over a New Mental Leaf\" 
 
Oslo skeptic, author Eyal Megged wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (December 27): 
\"The reality is that the dream of two countries living 
side by side in harmony between the Jordan River and 
the Mediterranean Sea is perhaps our dream, but not 
[the Palestinians\'].  This dream is nothing but an 
artificial implant, provided through the generosity of 
the peace camp.\'  That is the truth, and it is not 
wishful thinking, but comes from the mouths of those 
who have had this dream implanted in them.  You cannot 
help but get the impression that their rejection is not 
just physical.  It is accompanied by revulsion.  These 
words are not being written from a \'right-wing\' 
perspective whose bottom line is \'there is no one to 
talk to.\'  Just the opposite: this is a call to all 
those who insist on making peace now (and I am not 
blaming anyone, that is not my aspiration), to prepare 
to turn over a new mental leaf -- at this historical 
moment.  That they think again, that they think 
differently.  Perhaps about a division of a different 
kind, certainly not one in the form of the false charm 
known as \'disengagement,\' which will only lead us to an 
impasse.  Think about a solution of a different sort, 
because the good old solution will never be a 
solution.\" 
 
IV.  \"Not Much of A Choice\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(December 27): \"Prime Minister Ariel Sharon Sunday 
stressed how vital it is that Israel be seen throughout 
the world as facilitating the Palestinian Authority\'s 
upcoming election.  That is certainly so.... Sharon, 
however, may be unrealistically optimistic when 
expecting the election to perhaps produce a peace 
partner for further road map explorations.  There is no 
denying that the sounds emanating from the Palestinian 
campaign trail are hardly the sort to instill hope 
among Israelis.... Even Abbas has openly wrapped 
himself in Arafat\'s mantle and gone out of his way to 
show respect for the terrorists he claims not to 
support.... Sorely missing from the Palestinian 
equation is a peace camp, one that need not embrace 
Israel -- as some Israelis do the Palestinians -- but a 
party that argues, as our own \'national camp\' [the 
Right] does, that the national interest requires 
painful concessions.... Sadly, it appears the taboo on 
true reconciliation with Israel as a Jewish state with 
a moral right to exist in this region is still too 
powerful for even the bravest aspiring Palestinian 
politician to break.... It may emerge that Israel had 
nothing to gain from the Palestinian elections, or it 
may be that some of Sharon\'s purported optimism proves 
well founded.  Would that the latter turns out to be 
the case.  In that light, Sunday\'s unanimous cabinet 
approval for pulling out of Palestinian towns and 
keeping a low profile on the sidelines during the 
lections is the only sensible move.\"

-------------------------- 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: \"Despite the 
Phalcon affair, Israel insisted on not 
understanding.... No profit, no matter how much, for 
the Israeli defense industries is worth a crisis with 
Israel\'s main and only ally, the U.S.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
\"It Made Their Blood Boil\" 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (December 24): 
\"The signals that the Pentagon is sending Israel over 
the present crisis are sharp and harsh.  This is not 
just a personal crisis of trust between two top 
officials in the two security establishments.... This 
is a conflict of substance over the dying spasms of the 
military-commercial romance between Israel and China -- 
a romance that began in secret in the early 1980s, with 
the consent and encouragement of the Americans, and 
which ended, in practice, with a loud crash and an 
enormous crisis with the administration with the 
Phalcon affair in 2000.... Despite the Phalcon affair, 
Israel insisted on not understanding.  The defense 
industry milieu in Israel is a powerful player with 
great influence.  In addition, the security 
establishment thought that we were smarter, that our 
friends in Congress would look out for us, that the 
formal definitions would be on our side -- and 
continued to sell problematic military equipment to 
China.... The end of the current crisis is clear: 
Israel will bow to American terms.  But perhaps this 
time, for a change, the security establishment will 
realize that it has to stop trying to be a wise guy. 
No profit, no matter how much, for the Israeli defense 
industries is worth a crisis with Israel\'s main and 
only ally, the U.S.\"

Key stories in the media:

The tidal waves in South Asia continue to dominate the 
headlines.  Citing international sources, Israel Radio 
reported that 50,000 people are believed to have died 
in the tsunami.  The media reported that 33 Israelis 
were injured in the disaster, four of whom seriously, 
and cited the Foreign Ministry as saying that 200 
Israelis are still missing.  Israel Radio says that the 
ministry does not rule out the possibility that some 
Israelis may have been killed.  Maariv front-paged 
pictures of missing Israelis.  Leading media reported 
that Israel was supposed to dispatch to Sri Lanka a 150- 
strong military delegation, which would set up a field 
hospital in the city of Galle.  However, Israel Radio 
reported this morning that, as the Sri Lankan 
authorities have raised difficulties, equipment and 
drugs will leave Israel without the delegation.  The 
radio reported that a 15-strong Israeli delegation has 
arrived in India.  Conversely, reporting that India has 
declined Israeli assistance, Yediot quoted Foreign 
Ministry officials as saying that this is not the first 
time India has turned down Israeli aid, characterizing 
this as \"Indian pride.\" 
 
Leading media quoted PM Sharon as saying Monday that 
the cabinet will vote on the evacuation of settlements 
in the Gaza Strip and the northernmost part of the West 
Bank as early as next month.  The media reported that 
Monday the cabinet endorsed the disengagement in 
principle, but the decision does not include the 
evacuation of settlements.  Jerusalem Post quoted 
National Union MK Zvi Hendel as saying Monday before 
the Knesset\'s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee 
that unless the government agrees to hold new elections 
or a national referendum, the disengagement plan will 
fail.  Yediot quoted Bentzi Lieberman, the Chairman of 
the Yesha Council of Jewish Settlements in the 
Territories, as saying at the committee\'s session that 
the government decisions regarding disengagement 
constitute a \"collective rape of democratic rules.\" 
Ha\'aretz reported that 25 major Gush Katif (Katif Bloc) 
farmers are negotiating indirectly with the 
Disengagement Administration to receive large 
agricultural plots in the Pithat Shalom region of the 
western Negev in return for their fields in the Gaza 
Strip. 
 
Leading media quoted Sharon as saying before the 
Knesset\'s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that 
terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip now have 
shoulder-mounted missiles, and that there are mounting 
concerns that they will shoot down crop dusters flying 
over agricultural zones next to the Strip.  Ha\'aretz 
cited intelligence assessments by Israeli officials 
that Hamas will not cease its terrorist attacks in the 
run-up to the PA leadership elections on January 9, but 
that it will consider reducing its activities within 
the Green Line.  Ha\'aretz quoted a high-ranking Israeli 
security source as saying that from the point of view 
of Hamas, perpetuating the image that Israel is fleeing 
the Gaza Strip under fire, and primarily the 
organization\'s attacks, is a vital matter.  Jerusalem 
Post quoted former PA security minister Muhammad Dahlan 
as saying that jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, 
whom he visited on Monday, told him that Israel\'s 
decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and the 
northern West Bank is a victory for the Palestinian 
resistance. 
 
Leading media reported that the police briefly arrested 
Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian 
presidential candidate, as he campaigned in East 
Jerusalem on Monday. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that today Senator Joseph 
Lieberman (D-CT) will hold talks with high-ranking 
Israeli and Palestinian leaders. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Monday at the Knesset\'s 
Constitution, Law and Justice Committee A-G Menachem 
Mazuz voiced reservations about the bill proposal 
creating a second deputy PM, saying that Israel\'s basic 
laws are supposed to be stable and invariable. 
However, leading media quoted Mazuz as saying that 
should the current law be changed, several posts of 
deputy PM should be created.   Yediot and Jerusalem 
Post quoted Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres as saying 
that the Likud is behaving unfairly toward his party, 
which he said cannot wait much longer for its entry 
into the government.  Ha\'aretz reported that the 
establishment of a unity government, with a majority in 
the cabinet and Knesset in favor of disengagement, has 
turned the settler leadership into the most significant 
opposition outside and within the Knesset. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted visiting Canadian Justice 
Minister Irwin Cotler as saying that Israel\'s Arab 
neighbors are making genuine strides toward democracy 
and safeguarding human rights. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that, upon a request by France\'s 
Chief Rabbi Joseph Sitruk and French Jewish businessman 
Pierre Besnainou, Tunisian President Zine el Abidine 
Ben Ali decided to facilitate the entry of Israelis 
into his country, and to rehabilitate the old Jewish 
cemetery in Tunis. 
Ha\'aretz and Maariv reported that Monday a Syrian bride 
crossed the border with Israel in order to marry a 
Druze man from the Golan.  Ha\'aretz reported that 12 
Druze students returning from studies in Syria also 
passed through the Golan crossing.  The passages open 
several times a year with Israeli-Syrian cooperation 
and Red Cross assistance. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Chinese Deputy PM Tang 
Jiaxuan is visiting Israel.  The newspaper reported 
that he told Tourism Minister Gideon Ezra that China is 
considering upgrading Israel\'s status and allowing 
travel agents to send groups of Chinese tourists to 
Israel.  The Chinese Minister also signed an economic 
agreement with Palestinian leaders in Ramallah. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that for the past three years the 
advertiser Larry Weinberg, Vice President of the non- 
profit organization Israel21c (www.israel21c.org), has 
presented a positive image of Israel to the American 
public.  Jerusalem Post reported that Nonie Darwish, a 
Palestinian woman, has recently launched a web site, 
www.arabsforisrael.com, and has begun lecturing across 
the U.S. for the need to stand behind Israel and 
support its existence. 
 
Leading media reported that Monday the U.S. presented 
Acting Justice Minister Tzipi Livni with an extradition 
request for underworld kingpin Zeev Rosenstein. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted Immigrant Absorption Minister Tzipi 
Livni as saying that immigration from Argentina dropped 
by 71.6 percent in 2004.  Conversely, 2,850 immigrants 
from the U.S. will have arrived by the end of the year 
-- the largest figure in the last twenty years.

I.  \"Delegitimize the Debate\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 28): \"\'A 
world without Israel,\' screams the cover of the new 
January 2005 issue of the American magazine, Foreign 
Policy.... There is something disturbing, very 
disturbing, that a debate about Israel\'s right to exist 
is being held at all.  It is becoming increasingly 
clear that this is one of the highest prices Israel is 
paying for the current Intifada and the war in Iraq.... 
In the international community, the debate reverberates 
mainly in the declarations by European politicians 
regarding their support for \'Israel\'s right to 
exist\'.... American, Indian and even Egyptian statesmen 
do not talk about Israel\'s \'right to exist.\'  The prime 
minister, foreign minister and other Israeli leaders 
tend to ignore the entire matter, listening politely to 
their European hosts, wiping the spit off their faces, 
and continuing the conversation.  Perhaps their 
approach is the right one: if Israel justifies its 
existence and by doing so becomes a party to the 
debate, it may legitimize it.  But despite the silence, 
the calls to destroy Israel are not dying out and the 
debate on them is just growing stronger.  The time has 
come for the government to take note of this problem, 
and try to come up with appropriate ways to deal with 
it.\" 
 
II.  \"Struggle for the Mideast\" 
 
The Director of the Interdisciplinary Center\'s Global 
Research in International Affairs Center, columnist 
Barry Rubin, wrote in conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post (December 28): \"As 2004\'s most important 
development in the Middle East I would nominate the 
rise of a liberal reformist movement in the Arab world. 
... This movement is not just a few liberal professors 
living and preaching in the West.  It has a \'popular\' 
and \'militant\' element missing in earlier movements. 
Yet there is still no single liberal leader or movement 
anywhere in the Arab world able to mobilize large 
groups of people.  Perhaps a \'silent majority\' of Arabs 
and Muslims do want democracy and modern society in the 
Western sense; but such people may be only a \'silent 
minority\'.... The really engaging question is why it 
has been so hard to gain popular support for reform and 
moderation.  A common claim by Arab liberals is that 
the masses do support them, but secretly.  \'Our numbers 
are small,\' said Egyptian liberal Saad Eddin Ibrahim, 
\'not so much for lack of fellow citizens yearning for 
liberal governance, but out of fear of publicly 
expressing those yearnings.\'  There is truth in this, 
but fear is not the only problem.  Arab liberals must 
also compete against the persuasive force of other 
ideologies, such as Arab nationalism and Islamism, and 
the rewards they can offer their adherents.\"

(December 28): \" [The] main purpose [of national 
security councils] is to play traffic cop to the strong 
bureaucracies that fight over national security 
decisions.  In the U.S. and Israel, as in most 
countries, a myriad of separate bodies deal with 
defense, foreign affairs and intelligence, all of which 
have their own institutional strengths, weaknesses and 
biases.... NSC staffs [in the U.S. and Israel] usually 
do not exhibit the level of independence that they were 
founded to provide.... Though we often look to the U.S.

America is, in this case, a negative example.  Perhaps 
the biggest challenge facing Bush now, beyond

U.S. policy could not be more incoherent on this score, 
with the White House labeling Iran a member of the 
\'axis of evil\' while the State Department dubs it \'a 
democracy\' and flatly denies that the U.S. is pursuing 
a policy of regime change.  Ultimately, the credit or 
blame for such inconsistencies cannot be laid on the 
doorstep of NSC staffs, but rather on those of the 
political leaders who tolerate the warring

supposed to provide another function that is sorely

SUBJECT: Consular Field Trip to Haifa 
 
1.  Begin summary: On 13 December 2004, the American 
officers of the Consular Section traveled to Israel\'s 
northern port city of Haifa for meetings with community 
leaders, including the mayor, the chief of police, and 
others, as well as from a tour of the Haifa Consular 
Agency.  Officers benefited from exposure to Israel\'s most 
culturally diverse and progressive city.  End summary. 
 
2.   On 13 December 2004, a group of 10 Embassy consular 
officers traveled to Haifa to meet with city and community 
leaders and visit the Consular Agency.  Haifa is Israel\'s 
third most populous city, after Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 
with a population of just over 300,000.  Its population is 
diverse by Israeli standards, with some 82% Jewish- 
Israelis, 10% Arab-Israelis (split evenly between 
Christians and Muslims), and 8% classified as \"other.\" 
Haifa is also home, for the time being, to Israel\'s largest 
seaport (though according to Mayor Yona Yohav, Haifa\'s port 
will be soon be exceeded in size by the newer port in 
Ashdod).  Though the city\'s local economy has suffered from 
the economic stagnation throughout Israel of recent years, 
it benefits from the presence of Intel, Microsoft, and 
other high-tech facilities. Haifa is also home to two of 
Israel\'s most prestigious universities, Haifa University 
and the Technion. 
 
Mayor Yahav 
----------- 
 
3.  The first meeting of the day was with Haifa\'s Mayor, 
Yona Yahav.  Mayor Yahav, a Labor-party veteran who served 
after graduation from Hebrew University law school as an 
aide to legendary Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek, was elected 
in 2003 as the candidate of the Green, Neighborhood, and 
Shinui Parties.  He has a daughter in law school at Yale. 
The mayor discussed at length a theme that was repeated 
throughout the day:  the historical tolerance and ethnic 
diversity that characterizes Haifa and gives residents of 
the city an optimistic outlook elsewhere in short supply 
among Israelis.  The Mayor hopes to raise Haifa\'s profile 
worldwide as a unique model of a positive, culturally 
inclusive future not just for the Israel but for the entire 
Middle East.  He showed conoffs a short film building on 
the above themes, which he had been proud to present at the 
August 2004 AIPAC meeting in the US. He noted that AIPAC 
groups are now adding Haifa to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as 
necessary stops on their visits to Israel. 
 
Police Chief Meriesh 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Haifa District Police Chief Nir Meriesh Col. 
Meriesh graduated with a BA in business administration from 
Haifa University, as well as a master\'s in government from 
the JFK School of Government at Harvard, where he went on 
scholarship.  A former IDF Major, he served in the past as 
commandant of the Police Academy in Israel, as commander of 
the northern division of the local highway patrol, and as 
commandant of the police officers academy. Mariesh 
described for conoffs not just the success of the police in 
maintaining civic order among closely knit Arab and Jewish 
Israeli communities, but also the challenges of dealing 
with and encouraging assimilation of recent immigrants from 
the Former Soviet Union (FSU). 
 
5.  (SBU) According to Mariesh, many of these immigrants 
had forced Haifa to confront largely unknown problems,, 
including organized crime families, drug trafficking, 
prostitution and homelessness.  He spoke graphically of 
alcoholic immigrants emerging from passenger vessels in the 
port to disappear into the streets with their meager 
belongings, turning up later in hospitals or dead.  To cope 
with the problems, Mariesh said he actively recruits FSU 
immigrants to serve on the police force and in social 
welfare jobs, hoping thereby to improve ties with and 
intelligence on groups comprising the community. 
 
6.  (SBU) Meriesh also described the police staffing strain 
imposed by the need to prioritize response to/anticipation 
of terrorist attacks and/or political disturbances.  When a 
major incident occurs or is feared likely to occur in Tel 
Aviv or Jerusalem, the Haifa police force, like those 
elsewhere, are called on to supply officers.  Col. Meriesh 
says Haifa can ill-afford to lend its officers and that the 
city invariably suffers a spike in crime when the force is 
depleted. 
 
Haifa University 
---------------- 
 
7.  After a visit to the harmoniously multi-ethnic Rubin 
Conservatory of Music, one of Israel\'s leading music 
schools, and the Bahai Centre and Gardens, the world 
headquarters of the faith, the trip concluded with a visit 
to Haifa University to meet with Professor of History and 
outgoing Dean of Students, Ron Robin.  Professor Robin 
highlighted the unequalled ethnic diversity of the students 
at Haifa University:  20% of the total student body are 
Arab Israelis as well as 7% of the social science faculty. 
Robin was careful, though, to characterize HU as 
\"pluralistic\" rather than \"multicultural.\" He said that the 
dominant culture on campus is Jewish-Israeli, and the 
language in the classroom is Hebrew.  Nevertheless, he 
stressed that within this framework, all viewpoints and 
cultures are given space for expression. 
 
8.  During his term as Dean, the Professor noted, he had 
prioritized establishing links with the city of Haifa.  He 
is particularly proud of a program he initiated whereby 
students are housed in depressed neighborhoods in exchange 
for grant money.  The goal of the program is to provide the 
children of these neighborhoods with positive role models 
and promote university education as an avenue of social 
advancement.  Some 100 students are expected to participate 
during the next school year. 
 
9.  Comment:  Conoffs benefited from a first-hand look at 
and discussion of economic and other conditions in Israel\'s 
third-largest city, as well as a tour of the Consular 
Agency.  Junior Officers, especially, enjoyed an 
opportunity, for many of them the first, to participate in 
meetings with host-government officials and others. 
 
10.  The tone of the trip was refreshingly upbeat. 
Optimism mixed with communal pride in the presentations by 
each of the three principal hosts.  All stressed that the 
success of the Muslim and Jewish inhabitants of Haifa in 
living harmoniously together should be considered a model 
for peace throughout the Middle East.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary.  Treasury Desk Officer for Israel Catherine 
Downard discussed the budget, privatization, and other 
subjects with Israeli officials on December 13.  Her visit to 
the Karni Industrial Zone will be reported septel.  The 
highlights of her discussions: 
-- The GOI is committed to maintaining the 2005 budgetary 
framework.  Regardless of coalition negotiations, the 2005 
budget deficit will not exceed 3.4% of GDP, including 
disengagement; 
-- The recent MoF-Histadrut labor agreement will not result 
in additional 2005 expenditures; 
-- The members of the Bachar Committee achieved consensus 
that capital market reform required more than regulation but 
rather a full separation between commercial and investment 
banking; 
-- As dramatic as the Bachar Committee reforms were, they 
were only the first part of broader financial sector reform, 
which still requires the creation of effective competition 
within commercial banking; 
-- Privatization is moving forward, but the low-hanging fruit 
(El Al, Zim) has been picked. 
-- Privatizing defense companies such as Israel Military 
Industries (IMI) is the major challenge being faced by the 
GOI. End Summary 
 
---------------------------- 
MOF BUDGET OFFICIAL: COST OF 
COALITION WON\'T BREAK BUDGET 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Deputy Budget Director Gordon said that he expected 
the GOI to maintain the budget framework in 2005, with the 
exception of disengagement funding.  In large part as a 
result of fiscal restraint in 2004, the major risks to fiscal 
limits -- funding of local municipalities, wage costs, and 
the new coalition\'s fiscal demands -- were under control. 
Gordon went through a detailed analysis of the recent 
MoF-Histadrut labor agreement, the bottom line of which was 
that it would not influence 2005 expenditures.  The 2005 
budget\'s 1.2 billion reserve fund would cover the new 
parties\' fiscal demands, as well as pay for the cost of 
increased local municipalities funding, the other major 
unplanned expense for 2005: 
UTJ:  NIS 290 million 
Local Municipalities: NIS 700 million 
Labor: NIS 210 million. 
Should Labor demand more than what the reserves could 
cover, Gordon said the parties knew that would result in 
across-the-board cuts in other budget areas. 
 
3. (C) On disengagement, Gordon noted that, although 
disengagement funding had not yet been finalized, it would 
not cost more than 0.4% of GDP.  He noted this had already 
been communicated to the USG.  As a result, the 2005 budget 
deficit would come to no more than 3.4% including 
disengagement and the real increase in expenditures compared 
to 2004 would be no more than 1% excluding disengagement. 
 
----------------------------- 
Central Bank Deputy Governor: 
Amazing Consensus on Bachar Recommendations 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Deputy Bank of Israel (BOI) Governor Sokoler spoke 
about his recent work as a member of the Bachar Committee on 
capital market reform.  He stressed that the various members 
of the committee had quickly found themselves in consensus on 
the substance and importance of the reforms.  They believe 
that the current structure of Israel\'s capital markets is not 
suitable for such a vibrant economy. He stressed their view 
that the GOI,s ability to address problems of conflicts of 
interest through increased regulation is limited. 
 
5. (C) Sokoler said the banks were fighting hard against the 
reforms, saying that the solution was to bring in more 
financial institutions, as opposed to divesting the existing 
banks of their investment operations.  Sokoler said such 
argumentation made no sense in Israel: the two major banks, 
which controlled upwards of 60% of the market, had shown 
their ability to crush new market entrants.  Moreover, \"we 
want our banks to be a place where one can receive neutral 
recommendations on investments.\" 
 
5. (C) Sokoler stressed that the Bachar Committee had only 
begun the task of financial reform.  Once the mutual funds 
were hived off, who would purchase them?  Sokoler hoped 
\"foreigners\" would show an interest.  Who would supervise 
the new institutions?  The GOI must also find a way to 
increase competition within the commercial banking community 
by making it easier for customers to change institutions. 
Sokoler noted that these and other issues, such as 
formalization of a deposit insurance scheme and development 
of money market funds, will be addressed in a second phase of 
recommendations to be formulated in the coming months. 
 
--------------------------- 
Privatization Moves Forward 
--------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Eyal Gabbai, Director of the Israeli Companies 
Authority, said that the easy privatizations had been 
completed and the GOI was now concentrating on the hard 
cases. 
 
A. El Al: Gabbai expected Knafaim to exercise its options 
over El Al the week of December 20 and take formal control of 
the company.  Knafaim would probably make some initial 
changes, including selling and leasing back fleet planes, 
and engaging in more intense marketing.  It was unlikely to 
fly on the Sabbath. 
B. Zim:  The GOI had sold in 2004 its shares to the Israel 
Corporation, which now owns 97.5% of the company.  Zim, which 
used to be one of the five largest shipping companies in the 
world, is now likely to begin growing again. 
 
C. Bezeq:  Gabbai admitted that the GOI had priced Bezeq 
shares too high in June, resulting in a disappointing lack of 
interest by investors.  Nonetheless, the GOI stands by its 
commitment to sell all but 1.01% of the company, both 
through the stock market, and through a \"strategic block\" 
sale of 30-40% of the company to a private investor.  As of 
the end of October, eight companies had approached the GOI 
regarding the sale.  Gabbai expected this group to 
consolidate down to no more than 2 or 3 purchasing groups. 
The final sale would take place in the second quarter of 
2005.  Naturally, there were a number of conditions on the 
sale, including that the bidding party must have at least 20% 
of its capital in Israel. 
 
D. Defense Companies: Gabbai said he had found the 
privatization of Israel\'s defense companies to be the most 
challenging part of his job, in large part because the 
Defense Ministry and industry employees were utterly 
opposed to it.  That was why he was so pleased by plans to 
privatize Ashot-Ashkelon Industries (AAI), which is part of 
Israel Military Industries (IMI).  He characterized AAI has 
having 21st century technology held back by 1950s management. 
 Gabbai said the GOI plans to privatize AAI by the first 
quarter of 2005 and hopes improved management after 
privatization would show the wisdom of moving such firms into 
private hands.  He admitted that finding 
investors would not be easy: \"the employees are threatening 
to set fire to the factory if privatization goes forward.\" 
Selling the rest of IMI would be even more difficult: it Is 
deeply indebted and faces large future pension liabilities. 
The GOI had yet to agree on how to move forward. 
 
E.  Oil Refineries: The GOI had resolved in August, 2004 to 
split the oil refineries into two companies to increase 
industry competition.  Gabbai said the GOI planned to sell 
the smaller company, Ashdod, first.  It would then sell 
Haifa through the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). 
 
F.  Banks: Gabbai noted that the process of privatizing 
Discount Bank is very close to completion. Final proposals 
from the two remaining interested parties are expected by 
end-December. The release of the Bachar committee report on 
capital market reform may result in some discounting in the 
pricing of the sale of Discount Bank. Details of the Bank 
Leumi privatization are still being formulated. Gabbai said 
that the GOI is now considering distribute shares to the 
public rather than stock options, as initially proposed. 
Proper legislation to allow such a transaction has yet to be 
passed.

100 Israelis who were in the hit region.  Israel Radio 
this morning reported that the Thai authorities have 
reported on two Israeli casualties.  Foreign Ministry D- 
G Ron Prosor said in an interview with Israel Radio 
this morning that 150 Israelis are still unaccounted 
for.  Although all media reported that Sri Lanka turned 
down the visit of an Israeli rescue team, and that an 
Israeli plan carrying 80 tons of food and medical 
supplies worth USD 100,000 was set to depart for Sri 
Lanka this morning, Jerusalem Post reported that the 
Vatican\'s newspaper, L\'Osservatore Romano, called for 
\"a radical and dramatic change of perspective\" among 
people \"too often preoccupied with making war,\" and 
that it singled out Israeli military leaders for 
declining a request for emergency medical help. 
 
All media reported that the government suffered a 
serious blow on Tuesday when the Knesset\'s 
Constitution, Law and Justice Committee failed to 
approve the bill for the \"evacuation and compensation\" 
of settlers from the Gaza Strip and the northern West 
Bank.  The committee\'s vote on the bill resulted in an 
8-8 tie, with Israeli Arab MK Azmi Bishara (Balad) 
abstaining.  The vote is likely to delay the 
disengagement process by a few weeks.  Leading media 
reported that Tuesday settlers form the northern West 
Bank community of Sa-Nur prevented members of the 
Disengagement Administration from entering their 
settlement.  They had to force their way into Sa-Nur. 
Jerusalem Post quoted Pinchas Wallerstein, a senior 
member of the Yesha Council of Jewish Settlements in 
the Territories, as saying Tuesday that settler leaders 
are considering making an official appeal to Diaspora 
Jews to travel and join the fight against the 
evacuation of the Gaza Strip.  Israel Radio reported 
that activists of the outlawed Kach movement have 
handed out leaflets showing Jews being led in trains to 
the death camps.  The Yesha Council of Jewish 
Settlements in the Territories condemned the leaflets. 
The radio reported that the Yesha leaders will meet 
today with Acting Justice Minister Tzipi Livni in order 
to convince her of the \"illegality\" of the 
disengagement plan. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited a denial by Gush Katif (Katif 
Bloc) farmers Tuesday that they are in the midst of 
indirect negotiations with the Disengagement 
Administration to receive plots of land in the western 
Negev in exchange for fields they will leave behind 
under the disengagement plan. 
 
This morning, Israel Radio reported that two IDF 
soldiers escorting a civilian convoy were wounded in a 
shooting attack in the West Bank town of Baka El- 
Sharkiya, next to the Green Line.  The media quoted 
Palestinian sources as saying that Tuesday an IAF drone 
carrying two Hamas militants near the southern Gaza 
Strip town of Khan Yunis.  The militants, who escaped 
unharmed, were apparently on their way to carry out an 
attack in Gaza. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that, facing an upsurge in 
lawlessness and anarchy, the PA is preparing to deploy 
a special force in the Gaza Strip to fight local 
criminal gangs, but not Hamas. 
 
Yediot quoted Sharon as saying at a meeting with 
Israel\'s ambassadors to the European countries on 
Tuesday: \"Nobody has the right to determine how much 
security Israel requires.  Tell it to the Europeans 
forcefully.  We don\'t owe anything to anyone, only to 
the Almighty.\"  Maariv quoted Sharon as saying at the 
meeting: \"Europe won\'t take part in the diplomatic 
process with the Palestinians, because it doesn\'t have 
a balanced approach.\" 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted visiting Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D- 
CT) as saying Tuesday that Yasser Arafat\'s death has 
led to an improvement in U.S.-Palestinian ties, but 
that this upswing is conditional on the PA stopping 
terror. 
 
Citing AP, Jerusalem Post quoted Syrian FM Farouk Shara 
as saying Tuesday that Israel is to blame for the 
deadlock in peace talks between the two countries, 
citing Israel\'s rejection of Damascus\'s recent 
overtures. 
Yated Ne\'eman reported that Egyptian FM Ahmed Abu el- 
Gheit has urged Israel to pull out from all Palestinian 
cities it entered in 2000. 
Leading Internet service Ynet reported that the Iranian 
Broadcasting Authority has launched a well-informed 
Hebrew news site that includes items and articles on 
world and Israeli events. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that next week Knesset Speaker 
Reuven Rivlin is likely to declare Shinui party leader 
MK Yosef (Tommy) Lapid opposition leader. 
 
Maj. Gen Yiftah Ron-Tal, the head of the IDF Ground 
Services, was quoted as saying in an interview with 
Jerusalem Post that the Defense Ministry should boost 
production of the Merkava IV tank.  The newspaper also 
quoted him as saying that women of Machsom Watch, a 
group that monitors soldiers\' behavior at roadblocks, 
should be replaced with IDF officers. 
 
Visiting Egyptian journalist and historian Ali Salem 
was quoted as saying in an interview with Ha\'aretz that 
\"Israel has joined the Middle East\" following the 
signing of the free-trade agreement with Egypt.  Salem, 
who was persecuted in Egypt following his first visit 
to Israel in 1994, made similar remarks in interviews 
with Yediot and Maariv.  Ynet and Yated Ne\'eman quoted 
Jordanian journalist Shaker Nabulsi at saying at the 
\"New Media in the Middle East\" conference held at Ben 
Gurion University that Arab satellite media are a 
primary factor in the encouragement of terror. 
 
Citing AP, Ha\'aretz quoted PM Sharon as saying Tuesday 
that he has accepted an invitation to visit China.  The 
newspaper says that the expected visit could be 
overshadowed by friction over a snagged Israeli-Chinese 
weapons deal. 
 
Citing AP, Ha\'aretz reported that Turkish FM Abdullah 
Gul will travel to Israel next week. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that members of Ethiopia\'s 
Falash Mura community have accused a Jewish-American 
aid group, the North American Conference on Ethiopian 
Jewry (NACOEJ), of running a Mafia-like operation at 
its compounds in Addis Ababa and Gondar, where some 
15,000 to 17,000 Falash Mura await permission to 
immigrate to Israel.

Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(December 29): \"The enormous loss of life around the 
Indian Ocean rim is partly a human failure too.... 
South Asian nations are not anywhere as affluent [as 
the U.S. and Japan], which is their excuse for having 
wasted so much time postponing expenditure on tsunami 
alert devices. They couldn\'t even agree on whether 
these are worthwhile.... Lest we too patronizingly 
criticize others, however, we should pay attention to 
natural menaces of our own.  We must not ignore our 
dangers as the countries of South Asia ignored 
theirs.... Experts warn [Israel] to expect a major 
quake (above 7 on the Richter Scale) sometime within 
the next 50 years.  It could happen any day and, if of 
a devastating magnitude and in a lethally close 
location, no part of the country would be safe.... But 
talk and blueprints are no substitute for action.... 
Yes, dispensing more than advice costs money -- and we 
have more pressing needs.  So, too, did India, 
Indonesia et al.... We can\'t be sure when the next 
quake will come.  We can determine how prepared we are 
to survive it.\"

Veteran op-ed writer and the late prime minister

here and there, it seems that there are few countries 
in the world that come to the aid of their citizens the 
way Israel does.  The great America shrugs its 
shoulders.  France drowns in champagne and frog legs as 
the screens show appalling sights.  Oy, they say, and 
move on to their business.  Not us...The Americans have 
1,000 workers in their embassy in Thailand, and it is 
easy for them to get organized and send five of them to 
the airport to welcome arrivals.  Israel has six 
workers, and they have to stretch themselves thin. 
Albeit the concern of those rescued and their families 
is understandable, and the strain that is part of their 
lives at this time justifies their outbursts and rage, 
but when the storm abates, they too will realize that 
it is not exactly the job of the State of Israel to 
find their children who have gone on a trip, and all 
its actions in its handling and rescuing Israelis are a 
\'bonus\' to Israeli citizens simply because they are 
Israeli.  There is (almost) no other country like this 
in the world.\"

HRW emerged as a key player during the nongovernmental

Israel.... Like other powerful organizations, HRW and 
its leaders should be subject to a system of checks and

\"Pakistan\'s Immunity\" 
 
Defense commentator Reuven Pedhazur opined in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (December 29): \"All 
eyes are set on Iran, which is trying to dupe the 
Europeans and carry on with its plans to produce 
nuclear weapons, but the truth is that the more 
immediate threat for the acceleration of nuclear 
proliferation can be found nearby, in Pakistan.... The 
immunity enjoyed by [Dr. Abdel-Kader] Khan, [who was 
arrested by the Pakistan authorities on suspicion of 
running a clandestine international ring for the sale 
of nuclear technology and later pardoned by Pervez 
Musharraf] is rooted in the dependency that the Bush 
administration has developed in the form of Pakistan\'s 
president, who has been an important ally in the war 
the Americans are waging against international 
terrorism, and especially the hunt for Osama Bin Laden 
in Afghanistan.... With this attitude, the U.S. 
administration is in fact preventing the clearing of 
the air surrounding Khan\'s nuclear dealings, and does 
not allow the tracking of the path of proliferation 
that he paved around the world.... The Khan affair 
proves once more that even when the more sophisticated 
intelligence agencies seek to follow the nuclear 
activities of various countries, they fail over and 
over again.... In Israel the affair needs to raise a 
number of alarms.  A significant portion of Khan\'s 
clients are in the Middle East, and it is possible that 
Iran is not the sole country in the region with a 
nuclear weapons program.... The lesson is that there 
should be no reliance on the IAEA to tackle the problem 
and not even on the American determination to prevent 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Israel must 
prepare for \'a New Middle East\' in which it will no 
longer be the sole nuclear player.\"

decision of going to war in particularly difficult 
conditions: he faced an antagonistic Europe ... divided

REFORM, PROSPECTS FOR PEACE 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  CoDel Lieberman met with Minister of 
Finance Binyamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, December 28 to discuss 
elements of the Ministry\'s economic reform package, as well 
as prospects for advancing the peace process in the wake of 
Arafat\'s death and the rise of a new PA leadership.  On the 
economy, Netanyahu said that Israel has achieved the 
equivalent of \"ten years of growth\" via privatizations, 
pension reform, reducing taxes, cutting government spending, 
and a welfare-to-work agenda that will bring 80 percent of 
poor families above the poverty line within one year.  He 
noted that while he does not like the way some 150,000 
illegal foreign workers have been \"rounded up\" and deported, 
their departure is crucial to lowering unemployment.  On the 
peace process, Netanyahu said Israel is in a \"moment of 
opportunity\" for re-engaging with the Palestinians, but that 
what he termed U.S. hopes for teaming up with Europe to apply 
pressure on the PA to reform are misplaced since \"Europe 
consistently fails to see Palestinian shortcomings.\"  The 
change in PA leadership will be meaningless without societal 
change and Fayyad-like reforms across the board, he said, but 
with a real partner for peace Israel will spare no effort to 
reach a final settlement.  Netanyahu expressed his concern 
over threats of violent resistance to disengagement from 
\"tens of thousands\" of settlers, saying only a national 
referendum could calm the waters.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Encouraging Growth by Trimming Government Fat 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) CoDel Lieberman met with Minister of Finance Binyamin 
Netanyahu December 28 to discuss a range of economic and 
political issues.  Netanyahu began the meeting with a 
discussion of the effects of his broad economic reform 
agenda, noting that simply by \"opening up the economy\" Israel 
has achieved the equivalent of \"ten years of growth\" during 
his tenure.  \"Israel has made the fastest transfer to a 
complete market economy the world has seen.\"  Noting that per 
capita income is up and the deficit is down, Netanyahu said 
he expects over four percent annual economic growth within 
the next two to three years.  A key feature of his agenda has 
been \"slimming down\" the public sector, historically 60 
percent of GDP, via aggressive privatizations including El Al 
airlines and the banking and telecom sectors.  He noted that 
significant corporate and VAT tax breaks as well as 
government payroll cuts are additional elements of MinFin\'s 
program of economic reform. 
 
3.  (C) Netanyahu said that while most countries have avoided 
tackling pension reform, he did so by nationalizing union 
pensions, raising the age of retirement across the board, and 
modestly cutting benefits while increasing contributions. 
Similarly, his welfare reform program has reduced the \"fat 
man of welfare\" from 56 percent of GDP to 51 percent.  When 
opponents of welfare reform cite poverty statistics, he 
explained, they ignore the fact that within one year, 
MinFin\'s welfare-to-work program will raise approximately 80% 
of working poor families well above the poverty line. 
Netanyahu also highlighted the special police unit he had set 
up to uncover welfare fraud, something that \"everyone does,\" 
and in major cases can waste millions of shekels of 
taxpayers\' money. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Foreign Workers Removed to Make Room for Israeli Unemployed 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
4.  (C) Netanyahu said that there is a relationship between 
the 300,000 foreign workers that until recently resided in 
Israel, and the same number of Israeli unemployed.  \"You 
can\'t find a Jewish construction worker or a Jewish house 
cleaner in Israel,\" he noted.  Explaining that he did not 
like some of the methods the GOI used to round up and deport 
over 100,000 illegal workers, he said that their departure 
was one-half the equation to bring Israelis back to work. 
Palestinians should not replace the Romanian, Nigerian, Thai 
and Philippine laborers who have left, he said -- it must be 
Israelis, both Jewish and Arab, who take over vacant jobs via 
welfare-to-work. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Potential in New PA, But Nothing Certain Yet 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) In response to a question from Senator Lieberman, 
Netanyahu said that he believes Israel could find itself in a 
moment of opportunity for engagement with the Palestinians in 
the wake of Arafat\'s death and the rise of new PA leadership. 
 Arafat represented the \"worst of Arab Islamic tendencies, a 
complete negation of Israel\'s existence,\" he said.  Real 
progress, however, depends on deep-seated changes within 
Palestinian society, as well as reforms throughout the PA 
that are similar in scope to what Salaam Fayyad has done 
within the Ministry of Finance.  In Netanyahu\'s view, a 
change in leadership without these elements in place will be 
nothing but \"replacing a dictator with a more 
benign-appearing dictator.\" 
 
6.  (C) On change within Palestinian society, Netanyahu 
observed that Israel should not leave the territories without 
dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and eliminating 
elements of incitement.  On PA reform, he said its success 
depends heavily on American pressure.  He was pessimistic 
that Bush administration hopes of joint U.S.-EU pressure on 
the PA would come to fruition, due to what he called Europe\'s 
historic inability to see the extent of corruption within PA 
ministries.  Overall, he said, if Abu Mazen and the new 
leadership can shape the PA into a \"compliant and willing\" 
partner for peace, Israel will go to any length to reach 
final status solutions.  In the near-to-medium term, he said 
that the GOI hopes that disengagement after Gaza withdrawal 
can be negotiated, particularly the thorny and urgent issue 
of air and sea access for goods entering PA territories. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Settler Resisters Threatening Rule of Law 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Netanyahu said he fears that the tens of thousands of 
settlers that he said are threatening violent resistance to 
evacuation from the Gaza Strip and parts of the northern West 
Bank pose a \"real danger\" to the rule of law in Israel.  He 
explained that the situation is a tragic one no matter the 
outcome -- if Israel does not respond to settler violence it 
shows it cannot govern; and if it does respond, the ensuing 
clashes could tear the fabric of Israeli society.  He said 
that the only way out of this dilemma is a referendum. 
Sharon could win it hands down, he said, and it would force 
more settlers to accept disengagement as the will of the 
Israeli people, not just the Prime Minister.

SUBJECT: ALFE MENASHE SETTLEMENT EXPANDING TO THE GREEN LINE 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Norm Olsen for reasons 1.4 (b) and ( 
d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary.  Amira Bahat, council member of the Israeli 
town of Nirit, which abuts the Green Line, told Embassy 
economic officer on December 22 that the Alfe Menashe 
settlement will eventually spread to the Green Line with the 
construction of over 1,200 new housing units on the West Bank 
land between the settlement and the Green Line.  She 
explained that advertising for a new neighborhood of Alfe 
Menashe, called Nof Hasharon, began in 1999.  According to 
Bahat, private developers bought the land and signed an 
agreement with Nirit for the development to be connected to 
Nirit\'s infrastructure, but the developers lost interest with 
the start of the Intifada and never fulfilled their part of 
the agreement.  In late 2003, they came back to renegotiate 
with Nirit, but the town\'s residents in 2004 voted against 
being connected to Nof Hasharon and have petitioned the High 
Court to stop construction because, she said, Israel made 
commitments to the U.S. to stop settlement activity and 
because they \"do not want to be annexed into a settlement.\" 
Bahat contended that, in addition to Nof Hasharon, there are 
plans for two more housing developments near the new 
neighborhood for another 1,200 housing units and that the 
separation barrier will eventually be moved further into the 
West Bank so these areas will be on the west side of the 
seamline and therefore \"in Israel.\"  GOI officials from the 
Ministries of Defense, Housing and Construction, and Justice 
told econoff that Nof Hasharon is a private development and 
the only GOI involvement was approvals given by zoning 
authorities many years ago.  End summary. 
 
-------------------- 
How Did We Get Here? 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Amira Bahat, council member of the town of Nirit, 
west of the Green Line, told Embassy economic officer on 
December 22 that in late 1999, Nirit\'s residents woke up one 
morning to find a placard advertising a new housing 
development next to their community called \"Nirit North.\" 
This new development, now referred to as Nof Hasharon, is 
next to Nirit -- on the east side of the Green Line, but west 
of the separation barrier.  According to Bahat, upon 
investigating why \"Nirit North\" was being established without 
their knowledge, Nirit\'s residents discovered that the 
development was actually an extension of Alfe Menashe, a West 
Bank settlement almost three kilometers beyond the Green 
Line.  Nirit petitioned the High Court to stop construction, 
but by February 2000, the residents decided they could not 
win because \"the construction was happening without rules and 
regulations\" since the Ministry of Defense (MOD) \"authorizes 
what happens in the territories.\" 
 
3.  (C) Nirit\'s residents eventually gave up their case and 
signed an agreement with Attorney Moshe Glick, who represents 
the land developers, which stated that the planned 42 houses 
of the development would be able to use Nirit\'s 
infrastructure -- roads, electricity, sewage, schools -- in 
exchange for a lump sum of $25,000 and payments of monthly 
property taxes.  (Note:  Bahat said that among the developers 
Glick represents are Benny Katzover and Benzi Lieberman, 
senior members of the YESHA council.  End note).  Nof 
Hasharon\'s residents, however, would pay their taxes to Alfe 
Menashe which would then pass the funds to Nirit.  Bahat 
explained that, the agreement notwithstanding, the developers 
never paid Nirit any money and that construction stopped at 
the start of the Intifada because the developers \"lost 
interest.\" 
 
4.  (C) Bahat related that once construction of the 
separation barrier started in their area in late 2003, the 
developers came back to Nirit to try to renegotiate the 
agreement.  At this point, the plans for the development had 
grown to 52 houses.  The negotiations continued through 
August 2004, but that month 70 percent of Nirit\'s residents 
voted twice against being linked to Nof Hasharon despite the 
fact that, as Bahat explained, \"we need the money.\"  The 
other 30 percent of the residents allegedly voted in favor 
because they thought they could not win and the development 
would move forward regardless.  One week after the second 
vote, she concluded, construction restarted. 
 
5.  (C) Bahat continued that Nirit\'s residents again 
petitioned the High Court o/a November 7 to stop construction 
of Nof Hasharon because, she said, Israel made commitments to 
the U.S. to stop settlement activity.  She also said Nirit\'s 
residents \"do not want to be annexed into a settlement.\" 
Bahat reported, however, that the GOI\'s response was that 
this development was approved five years ago, so Israel-U.S. 
commitments do not apply.  Nirit residents are currently 
waiting for the High Court\'s decision while construction 
continues. 
 
------------------ 
Seeking Other Help 
------------------ 
6.  (C) Bahat stated that members of Nirit\'s council recently 
went to the Interior Committee of the Knesset with Labor MK 
Amram Mitzna to get the project stopped.  Some of the MKs 
reportedly agreed that this \"was not a normal thing,\" and one 
MK allegedly said, \"Believe me, we think like you but we 
cannot help you.  If you want help, go to the U.S.\" 
 
------------------ 
What Happens Next? 
------------------ 
 
7.  (C) In response to econoff\'s question, Bahat replied that 
Nirit\'s residents sought the advice of Gabriela Shalev, a law 
professor, who told them that the original agreement was 
voided because the developers never paid Nirit\'s residents 
what they owed.  Bahat said this was irrelevant, however, 
because Nirit has already \"received orders from the army\" to 
open up its fence, which runs along the Green Line, so Nof 
Hasharon\'s residents can use Nirit\'s roads. 
 
--------------------------- 
But it\'s Only the Beginning 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) With respect to the West Bank land between Nof 
Hasharon and Alfe Menashe, Bahat reported that apparently 
Jews bought it from Arabs over 70 years ago, but she opined 
that it should go to \"Palestine.\"  She added that there will 
be more construction there and gave econoff a map which shows 
a housing development planned for West Bank land between Nof 
Hasharon and the separation barrier called \"Admot Hayehudim,\" 
or \"Land of the Jews.\"  Bahat continued that Ilan Niv, 
chairman of Nirit\'s council, went to meet with Alfe Menashe\'s 
leaders several days ago and he reportedly saw a map with 
another planned development on West Bank land south of Admot 
Hayehudim called \"Ilanit.\"  Bahat concluded that, because of 
these two new developments, Nirit will eventually be flanked 
by 1,200 housing units on its east side. 
 
9.  (C) Bahat explained that, based on the snake-like pattern 
of the separation barrier in this area, Nof Hasharon\'s 
residents would have to cross two fences to get to Alfe 
Menashe.  She opined, however, that the separation barrier 
will eventually be moved to run along Alfe Menashe\'s east 
side so these new houses \"will be in Israel.\"  (Note:  Such a 
change in the route of the separation barrier would leave the 
new houses on West Bank land, albeit west of the barrier. 
End note).  Bahat said that the developers in fact originally 
advertised the land as being located in Israel rather than 
east of the Green Line -- although they have not done so 
since the case went to the High Court -- and this may be the 
case in the long run. 
 
------------------------------ 
GOI Says it\'s a Private Matter 
------------------------------ 
 
10.  (C) Grisha Yaakobovich, who replaced Oded Herman in 
COGAT at the Ministry of Defense (MOD), told econoff that he 
did not know anything about this case other than it is being 
discussed in the High Court.  He said that since it is a 
private development, he did not have any other details. 
Chaim Fialkoff, acting director general at the Ministry of 
Housing and Construction (MOHC), said he also had few details 
because the land was bought by private developers and the 
only government involvement was for the Civil Administration 
to give permits years ago.  He explained that the MOHC has 
not provided subsidies or any infrastructure -- which is why 
the settlement is connecting to the infrastructure of Nof 
Hasharon -- nor is it overseeing any of the construction.  In 
response to econoff\'s question, Fialkoff confirmed that the 
West Bank land between Alfe Menashe and Nof Hasharon is also 
privately owned.  Mike Blass, Deputy Attorney General at the 
Ministry of Justice (MOJ), repeated the fact that the land 
was privately acquired long ago with approval from the zoning 
authorities.

TAGS: PREL, IS, KPAL, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS, PEACE PROCESS, GAZA DISENGAGEMENT 
SUBJECT: SHARON: OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACE PROGRESS EXISTS, BUT 
PALESTINIANS MUST CONFRONT TERRORISM 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Prime Minister Sharon told Sen. Lieberman December 27 
that he is confident of forming a new coalition government 
soon.  He said the Left in Israel cannot implement 
disengagement and has never removed an Israeli settlement; 
and the Right is against disengagement and removal of 
settlements.  Sharon emphasized he will proceed to implement 
disengagement without any change in the substance or 
timetable of the plan. 
 
2. (C) While noting an opportunity for progress towards peace 
exists, Sharon pointed to continuation of Palestinian 
terrorism and the continued failure of Palestinian security 
forces to deploy to stop the violence.  The successful 
conclusion of disengagement could pave the way back to the 
road map, Sharon said, but this will not happen if terrorism 
continues.  \"Israel will not negotiate under fire.\" 
 
3. (C) Sharon complained about recent statements by Abu Mazen 
that sounded much like Arafat.  Sen. Lieberman said that Abu 
Mazen had told him earlier in the day that he is new to 
politics.  Abu Mazen was focused on the need to end violence 
and specifically mentioned that rockets and mortars must 
stop.  Sharon commented that Israel does not expect Abu Mazen 
to be a Zionist, but steps need to be taken against 
terrorism. Israel is providing significant support to the 
Palestinians on elections. 
 
4. (C) Asked about the situation following the elections, 
Sharon expressed the hope that Abu Mazen will be elected and 
expected to meet him soon.  Sharon said he would raise with 
Abu Mazen the need to deal with security, an issue on which 
Israel would make no compromises.  Second, Sharon would 
propose coordination between the Israeli and Palestinian 
security services regarding disengagement and would be 
prepared to coordinate other disengagement issues as well. 
Third, Sharon noted the importance of Palestinians\' receiving 
financial support, particularly for infrastructure projects 
such as desalination, power stations, and housing for 
refugees so as to eliminate refugee camps.  Finally, Sharon 
noted, if Israel can be free of its responsibility for 
Gaza--that is, if conditions permit Israel\'s withdrawal from 
the Philadelphi strip--then planning could begin for 
transportation networks between Egypt and Gaza and for a 
seaport and an airport. 
 
5. (C) Sharon expressed particular concern about ongoing 
weapons smuggling to Gaza.  Palestinians have brought in 
rocket-propelled grenades and several shoulder-fired 
surface-to-air missiles (Strellas, not Stingers).  He said 
that Egypt is \"doing something\" but not enough in order to 
stop the smuggling.  It is important that a secure climate be 
built in Gaza to attract foreign investment. 
 
6. (C) Sharon said he knows that Abu Mazen wants to arrange a 
ceasefire and that if there is quiet, Israel will reciprocate 
with quiet.  But a ceasefire alone is not enough. There must 
be a full cessation of terrorism, violence and incitement. 
Israel will not sit quietly if it comes under fire and will 
not accept the excuse that Abu Mazen needs time to get 
organized. 
 
7. (C) Sen. Lieberman said that Abu Mazen listed his 
priorities with Israel as stopping the security wall, ending 
settlement activity, and seeking the gradual release of 
prisoners.  In contrast, Saeb Erekat had told Lieberman that 
the priorities must be the creation of Palestinian jobs, an 
end of back-to-back cargo handling and the like.  In 
response, Sharon emphasized again the importance of 
dismantling terrorist organizations according to the roadmap 
and in line with the plans developed by Tenet and Zinni. 
Commenting on Abu Mazen\'s priorities, Sharon listed his own 
priorities as follows: 
 
--Palestinian refugees will not return to the State of Israel. 
--In accordance with the agreement reached with President 
Bush, heavily populated, major settlement blocs will be 
\"connected\" to Israel. 
--Israel will never negotiate over Jerusalem, its eternal 
capital, and there will be no negotiation leading to the 
division of Jerusalem.  Sharon said he could consider handing 
over some Arab neighborhoods populated after the 1967 war, 
but stressed he would never hand over the Temple Mount, Mount 
of Olives or the City of David. 
--Israel will continue to build the fence, which has already 
reduced Israeli casualties.  In accordance with Israeli High 
Court decisions, Israel has also adopted policies to reduce 
Palestinian suffering. 
--Israel is not building new settlements.  The Jewish 
population in the West Bank (outside Jerusalem) is 250,000, 
and there are towns, schools and industry.  Parts of the 
settlement blocs will stay in Israel\'s hands according to the 
agreement reached with President Bush. 
 
8. (U) Senator Lieberman did not clear this message before 
his departure.

SUBJECT: ISRAELI FM SHALOM OFFERS CAUTIOUS VIEW ON 
PALESTINIAN ELECTIONS TO CODEL LIEBERMAN/DAYTON 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer; Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: While acknowledging that the situation had 
improved since Arafat\'s death, Israeli Foreign Minister 
Silvan Shalom told Senators Lieberman and Dayton on December 
28 that he is \"discouraged\" by Abu Mazen\'s recent remarks on 
the campaign trail.  Shalom interpreted the speech as an 
indication that Abu Mazen will not dismantle the terrorist 
infrastructure or compromise on Palestinian demands for a 
right of return to Israel.  Shalom said the Israeli 
Government is facilitating the Palestinian elections, but he 
expressed concern that the Palestinians will continue 
Arafat\'s policies and offer \"the same old excuses.\"  In 
response to a question from the CoDel, Shalom outlined his 
proposal for another Aqaba conference, which he said would 
build confidence but avoid substantive issues.  Shalom told 
the CoDel that the way to deal with both the Palestinians and 
the Arab world is to embrace moderates and isolate 
extremists.  He said that the EU-3\'s position on Iran is 
\"much better than before,\" but still in need of improvement. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Shalom Discouraged by Abu Mazen\'s Statements 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a December 28 meeting with Senator Joseph 
Lieberman, Senator Mark Dayton, the Ambassador, Senate staff, 
and military escort, Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom 
said he is \"very discouraged\" by Abu Mazen\'s December 25 
election speech in which the Palestinian leader had been 
\"tougher than Arafat.\"  Shalom interpreted the remarks as an 
indication that Abu Mazen will not dismantle the terrorist 
infrastructure and will continue to insist on the right of 
return.  Shalom questioned why the Palestinians would want to 
return to a Jewish state and, as he described it, trade their 
current Diaspora for another.  He expressed hope that Abu 
Mazen\'s actions would be guided by the comments he had made 
as Prime Minister and not the ones he is making on the 
campaign trail.  The Foreign Minister cautioned that he wants 
\"everyone in the international community to ... be aware of 
what Mahmoud Abbas is saying.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Palestinian Elections and the Aftermath 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Shalom said the Israeli government is \"doing 
everything we can\" to facilitate the Palestinian elections, 
including the provision of assistance to election observers. 
He added that he is more concerned, however, by \"what will 
happen the day after\" and by Palestinian actions following 
the first post-election terrorist attack.  He reiterated his 
call for the Palestinians to stop incitement against Israel, 
saying it is something Abu Mazen \"could do in a day.\"  He 
acknowledged that it would take longer to fight terrorism, 
but insisted that a cease-fire is insufficient.  Shalom said 
that the Palestinians should begin a crackdown against 
terrorism the day after the elections. 
 
4. (C) Describing the CoDel\'s meetings with Abu Mazen, Abu 
Ala\'a, and Salam Fayyad on December 27 (septel), Senator 
Lieberman said he was struck by the difference between the 
election rhetoric on campaign posters and the Palestinians\' 
private comments.  In his meeting with the CoDel, Abu Mazen 
had focused on his commitment to end violence, discussed 
efforts to reach an agreement with Hamas, and candidly 
described problems with Palestinian security forces and the 
\"chaotic situation\" currently faced by the Palestinian 
Authority.  The Palestinians had also spoken in U.S. and 
Israeli terms about the rule of law, democracy, and 
transparency, he said. 
 
5. (C) Shalom agreed that the situation has improved 
following Arafat\'s death, but he expressed concern that the 
Palestinians will \"use the same old excuses\" to avoid real 
action.  He feared that after the elections they could again 
claim that the PA is too weak to confront extremists and that 
the Israeli military presence precludes PA action.  Shalom 
insisted that the PA end its tolerance of \"alternate military 
structures\" in its area of responsibility. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Aqaba Conference to Jump Start Peace Process 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Senator Lieberman asked the Foreign Minister about his 
recent proposal for another Aqaba conference.  Shalom 
suggested that Abu Mazen, PM Sharon, King Abdullah, President 
Bush, and possibly President Mubarak meet \"to give a jump 
start to the peace process.\"  He stressed that the gathering 
would have to wait until the Palestinians ended terrorist 
attacks.  It would build confidence, but \"shouldn\'t deal with 
substance.\"  The substantive way forward is already laid out 
in the road map, he said. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Shalom Doctrine: Assist Moderates and Isolate Extremists 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
7. (C) Shalom said that the way to deal with both the 
Palestinians and the Arab world is to \"embrace the moderates 
and isolate the extremists.\"  He noted that moderates still 
fear Al-Qaeda, but they face a new international environment 
now that Arafat is dead, Saddam is in jail, and Qadhafi has 
changed policies.  Other countries realize that terrorism is 
not only an Israeli problem, which means Israel can finally 
be seen as being \"on the side of the good guys.\"  Senator 
Dayton asked how the USG could encourage moderates in the 
Palestinian leadership.  Shalom replied that there are 
already positive signs, such as the recent letter by 
Palestinian intellectuals urging Abu Mazen to negotiate with 
Israel. 
 
8. (C) Shalom noted that Syria and Iran are supporting 
terrorism and should be isolated.  In response to a question 
from Senator Lieberman, Shalom said that European efforts to 
address the threat of Iran\'s nuclear program are \"much better 
than before.\"  Israel is dissatisfied with the last agreement 
signed by the EU-3 and Iran, he added, but aggressive public 
diplomacy efforts have led to a greater appreciation of the 
threat by the Europeans. 
 
9. (U) Prior to departing to meet with PM Sharon, Shalom 
invited the senators to attend a special session of the UNGA 
on January 24 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the 
liberation of Nazi concentration camps. 
 
10. (U) The CoDel did not clear this message prior to 
departing post.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The tsunami disaster continued to dominat all major 
media.  The Israeli angle: 22 Israelis are still 
reported as missing. 
 
Jerusalem Post quotes Industry, Trade and Labor 
Minister Ehud Olmert as saying that Israel will need to 
carry out a large-scale withdrawal from the West Bank 
after the initial disengagement from the Gaza Strip. 
According to Olmert, this should happen whether or not 
there is a viable peace partner on the Palestinian 
side.  Kol Israel cited sources in PM Sharon\'s bureau 
as saying that they reject Olmert\'s talks about another 
disengagement and that the only plan that PM Sharon is 
obliged to follow is the road map. 
 
All media reported that Defense Ministry Director- 
General Amos Yaron refused to provide details on the 
rift between the defense establishment and the Pentagon 
over Israel\'s weapons deal with China in the Knesset 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting on 
Wednesday.  His refusal caused a storm among the 
members of the committee and some left the meeting in 
protest.  Jerusalem Post reported that China\'s senior 
foreign policy official, State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan, 
has told the U.S. to stay out of its Harpy drone 
aircraft deal with Israel. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the cabinet will view the new 
fence route after the PA elections.  The paper notes 
that the route\'s approval might spark a conflict 
between Israel and the new Palestinian leadership as it 
penetrates deeply into the West Bank. 
 
Israel Radio this morning reported that the IDF has 
started an operation in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in 
the southern Gaza Strip in order to halt mortar and 
missile fire at settlements.  Three Palestinian 
militants were killed during the operation. 
 
Leading media reported that according to IDF figures 
released on Wednesday, 118 Israelis were killed in the 
war with the Palestinians in 2004, 445 fewer than in 
the previous year. 
 
The media reported that a new coalition is unlikely to 
be established next week due to difficulties in 
negotiations with United Torah Judaism and the Knesset 
Constitution, Law and Justice committee\'s ongoing 
discussions on the so-called Peres bill.  Maariv 
reported that 13 Likud members sent a letter in which 
they announced that they will not support the 
government. 
Leading media reported that according to a new law that 
was passed by the Knesset on Wednesday, anyone who 
gives money to the family of someone who committed a 
terror attack will be considered a terrorist financer 
and face a prison sentence of 7 to 10 years. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that a group of anti- 
disengagement MKs proposed that Jews and Israelis 
abroad have the right to vote in the Israeli elections. 
 
Leading media reported that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 
met with the IDF Brigade Commanders Forum on Wednesday. 
In the meeting the PM was told that the settlers are 
preparing for a fight during the implementation of the 
disengagement plan.

1. \"Year of Truth\" 
 
Columnist Ari Shavit wrote in left-leaning, independent 
Ha\'aretz (December 30): \"The two events that best 
define the outgoing year took place toward its end: On 
Tuesday, October 26, the Israeli parliament adopted the 
disengagement plan, and on Monday, November 12, the 
Palestinian people buried Yasser Arafat.  In so doing, 
within a span of 20 days or so, the face of the country 
was changed, as was the face of the Middle East.  The 
Jewish national movement decided in organized and 
democratic fashion to begin the long process of ending 
the occupation, while the Palestinian national movement 
separated in spontaneous, chaotic and perhaps temporary 
fashion from the ethos of terror of its founder.  In so 
doing, without us even noticing, the war as we knew it 
ended.  In so doing, without us having even rendered 
our opinion, a new peace process was launched.... The 
Israeli determination to disengage and the Palestinian 
readiness to change make the year 2005 a year of rare 
opportunity.  In order to capitalize on this 
opportunity, however, we have to move from politics to 
diplomacy.  We must domesticate the wild idea of the 
disengagement and make it into part of an overall 
Israeli plan.\" 
 
2. \"The Year of the Tsunami\" 
 
Nationalist writer Uri Dan commented in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (December 30): \"There is no reason to 
party: 2005 is going, most probably, to be the year of 
the tsunami, internationally, regionally and locally. 
The waves of terror and war will threaten the lives of 
innocent people the same way the waves of the sea took 
the lives of thousands of people from Indonesia up to 
Somalia.... The Palestinian tsunami: it seeps and 
breaks through the smuggling tunnels to the Gaza 
Strip....  Suicide terrorists still stand waiting, 
willing to try and flood Israel with new waves of 
terror, and only the GSS and the IDF are stopping them. 
Whoever believes that Abu Mazen and his gang will block 
these trends in 2005 is deluding himself and his people 
... Eventually he will be overwhelmed by these waves 
just like in Phuket.\"

TAGS: KWBG, ECON, IS, GAZA DISENGAGEMENT, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS 
SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND GAZAN BUSINESS LEADERS DISCUSS PA 
SECURITY, DISENGAGEMENT PLANNING 
 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: The Ambassador met December 23 with Pepsi 
Gaza CEO Mohammed Yazgi, Gaza Bus Company President Mohammed 
Abu Ramadan, and engineer and insurance company head Ahed 
Bseiso -- three Gazan businessmen who also lead the private 
enterprise organizations PalTrade and the Palestinian 
Business Association.  The group focused on PA security, with 
the Ambassador noting that a clear effort on the part of the 
security services to find those who had killed three Embassy 
security personnel would encourage the USG to consider 
re-entering Gaza.  The businessmen emphasized the disarray of 
the security services overall and the importance of security 
\"on the street\" to private enterprise.  They described Gaza 
disengagement as \"breaking apart the road map\" and noted that 
PM Sharon could make the new PA either strong or weak, adding 
that they urge the USG to monitor the peace process closely. 
On the border crossings, the men related instances of what 
they deemed unnecessary IDF-ordered delays, while the 
Ambassador described potential positive GOI steps towards 
greater freedom of movement.  The three agreed to the 
Ambassador\'s suggestion of a joint Israeli-Gazan business 
meeting to be arranged by the Embassy.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Security: Finding The Killers 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) The Ambassador opened the meeting by expressing 
regret that USG personnel are not traveling to Gaza in the 
wake of the October 2003 killings of three Embassy security 
personnel.  In response to Ahed Bseiso\'s comment that this 
policy appeared to be \"collective punishment,\" the Ambassador 
responded that it was instead a reflection of the USG\'s deep 
dissatisfaction with the way the PA security services 
\"dropped the issue\" after a handful of seemingly productive 
meetings.  The security services would have to demonstrate 
clear effort to solve the case and progress on reform 
initiatives, rather than perfection in these efforts, in 
order for the USG to consider returning to Gaza. 
 
3.  (SBU) The businessmen described the PA security services 
as weak and fragmented -- \"20 groups\" vying with each other 
for primacy instead of two or three working together -- and 
said that while in some cases the services even know the 
identities of criminals, they cannot interfere.  More 
importantly, Palestinian witnesses to crimes do not come 
forward with information because they know the police are 
unable to protect them.  Abu Ramadan expressed certainty that 
this is true in the case of the murder of the USG personnel. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Security is Business\' Top Priority 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The three men repeatedly emphasized the importance 
of security to the success of Gazan private enterprise. 
Pepsi bottler Mohammed Yazgi noted that in meetings with Abu 
Mazen the business community has requested security reform 
first and foremost, even before requests for economic reforms 
and assistance to private enterprise.  Bseiso added that 
while he believes Gazan police are making an attempt to get a 
handle on \"street security,\" they have not succeeded.  Arafat 
had controlled the security services since 1967, he said -- 
that culture and mentality cannot change overnight. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Disengagement: \"Breaking Apart the Road Map\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Yazgi, Abu Ramadan, and Bseiso said that while 
Israel plans for disengagement and the World Bank and donor 
community formulate their responses, Gazans have \"no voice\" 
in the process and no clear picture of what it will mean for 
private enterprise.  The men said they fear that separate GOI 
disengagement policies towards Gaza and the West Bank will 
break apart components of the road map, to the detriment of a 
negotiated final status. 
 
6.  (SBU) The Ambassador responded that the USG views 
disengagement as a positive step and will support it as long 
as it is not the \"end of the road\" of GOI engagement.  With 
Arafat gone, he explained, there is no excuse for Israel, the 
PA, or the U.S. not to move forward on the road map.  The 
three men said they view the U.S. as the only appropriate 
third party to diligently monitor road map implementation at 
this juncture. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Will Sharon Help or Hinder New PA? 
---------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Bseiso then raised the question of PM Sharon\'s 
willingness to empower Abu Mazen and the new PA leadership. 
Both politically and security-wise, he said, Israel has the 
power to make the PA either strong or weak.  He added that in 
his view PM Sharon did nothing to help Abu Mazen when he 
became Prime Minister.  The Ambassador said that Sharon has 
recently begun to believe now is the right time to take 
numerous steps he could not take when Arafat was in power. 
After the PA elections, he said, it seems Sharon will be 
willing to talk to Abu Mazen, and in fact must find a way to 
do so regarding disengagement issues like settlement assets 
and the maintenance of Israeli-Palestinian business ties. 
 
---------------------------- 
Movement of Goods and People 
---------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) The men expressed their continued vital interest in 
the free movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza. 
They related a variety of difficulties at the border 
crossings, including a recent delay at Erez during the 
processing of new magnetic cards for long-term permit holders 
that resulted in only 100 cards being issued over a ten-hour 
day.  Abu Ramadan argued that Rafah has a daily capacity of 
over 3,000 people, yet the IDF slashes that number even to 
150 when they are \"in a bad mood.\"  On the movement of goods, 
Yazgi pointed out that it costs a Gazan over USD 4,000 to 
import a container of goods from the U.S. -- USD 1,000 all 
the way to Ashdod port and USD 3,000 from Ashdod into Gaza 
due to delays at Karni terminal. 
 
9.  (SBU) The Ambassador said that the World Bank has also 
emphasized the importance of freer movement for goods and 
people, and added that technological improvements and 
possible privatization of terminal operations could 
ameliorate the current situation.  The USG supports a Gazan 
airport and seaport, he continued, and wants to see the 
security situation improve to a point where these are 
possibilities.  Sharon has meanwhile agreed to the 
\"compromise\" of a transport helicopter between Jordan and 
Gaza, something he refused to consider six months ago.  \"We 
are 10% of the way\" towards a number of World Bank 
post-disengagement economic goals, he said. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Planned Gazan-Israeli Business Meeting 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) The Ambassador asked the businessmen if they would 
like Embassy assistance in arranging a meeting with Israeli 
counterparts to discuss economic aspects of Gaza withdrawal. 
The three agreed such a meeting would be beneficial, noting 
that they had held similar meetings in the past with good 
results.  They added that the Gazan private sector is 
planning a conference on disengagement in the coming weeks 
that will address issues like the crossings, agribusiness, 
settlement assets, and industrial zones.  They agreed to 
liaise with Embassy Economic section to arrange a joint 
Israeli-Gazan business meeting that may include working-level 
GOI interlocutors as well as representatives from the private 
sector.

SUBJECT: SNAPSHOT OF A BORDER CROSSING AND HOPES THAT ABU 
MAZEN WILL BRING IMPROVEMENT 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Gaza-based NYT stringer Taghreed el-Khodary 
told the Ambassador December 22 that Gazans are even more 
interested in having Abu Mazen elected than are West Bank 
Palestinians -- not from any great love of Abu Mazen, but 
rather from the positive experience they remember from his 
brief tenure in 2003.  Hamas, according to el-Khodary, will 
hold out for a mutual cease-fire with Israel and for 
positions in any post-election PA as its price for halting 
attacks.  Other militant groups would be inclined to cease 
attacks if the PA offers them jobs, most likely in the 
security structures.  If not brought in to the governing 
structures in a manner it considers sufficient, Hamas members 
with whom el-Khodary has spoken told her they \"will turn (the 
situation) into hell.\"  El-Khodary said she believes that if 
Hamas is actually brought into the government, however, \"they 
will behave.\"  After an almost seven-hour ordeal at Erez as 
she tried to cross into Israel, el-Khodary said that she had 
witnessed firsthand the anger of average Palestinians -- the 
citizenry and the PA security personnel -- at both the 
treatment they receive at the hands of the Israeli soldiers 
and what she termed the arrogance demonstrated by PA 
officials who \"breeze through\" the checkpoints ahead of sick 
people who wait hours to cross into Israel for medical 
treatment.  End Summary. 
 
------------- 
Erez Crossing 
------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) In a meeting December 23, Gaza-based NYT stringer 
Taghreed el-Khodary gave the Ambassador a snapshot of views 
gathered during a time-consuming journey into Israel from 
Gaza City via the Erez Crossing.  El-Khodary\'s journey 
through the Erez Crossing took a total of seven hours, 
despite the Embassy\'s assistance and receipt of clearances in 
advance from the IDF and the Office for Coordination and 
General Administration in the Territories (COGAT). 
El-Khodary characterized her trip as a learning experience, 
where she experienced firsthand what the average Palestinian 
-- of the few who are fortunate enough to receive a permit -- 
goes through in order to exit the Gaza Strip.  The day began 
at 0700 hours when el-Khodary received word that her permit 
was approved; she was told to be at the crossing at 1000 
hours to collect it and enter Israel.  The permit was 
eventually ready only at 1300 hours, after numerous phone 
calls from the Embassy to spur issuance.  In the interim, 
el-Khodary cooled her heels at the Palestinian checkpoint 
several hundred meters from the crossing area.  She 
eventually received her corrected permit -- the first one 
authorized her travel to the wrong city on the wrong day -- 
at approximately 1630 hours. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Why Should I Protect Them When They Treat Me Like This? 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3.  (SBU) El-Khodary said that as she waited, she chatted 
with, among others, a PA security officer, who confessed to 
being angry and humiliated with how the IDF soldiers that he 
worked with daily treated him.  Why should I protect them, he 
said, when they show me no respect?  One of these days, I 
probably won\'t, he concluded.  El-Khodary watched as PA 
officials \"breezed through\" the crossing, leaving average 
Palestinians -- some of whom were ill and had permits to 
enter Israel that day for medical treatment -- languishing on 
the Gaza side.  The resentment was palpable, el-Khodary said, 
particularly when only five of the 25 medical cases were 
eventually allowed to cross, and then only near the end of 
the day.  The rest were told to go home and reapply to cross 
another day.  Both the GOI and the PA need to realize, she 
commented, that they do themselves no favors in the eyes of 
the population by giving PA officials preferential treatment. 
 The behavior of IDF soldiers is \"turning moderates into 
extremists,\" in el-Khodary\'s opinion. 
 
4.  (SBU) The Ambassador said that the GOI has plans to 
transfer control over checkpoints to civilian companies after 
disengagement, in order to address the current situation, 
which he agreed is bad for both the soldiers and the 
Palestinians.  Progress on this and a host of other 
disengagement-related issues will be easier after the 
elections January 9 when, by all indications, the GOI and the 
PA will be better able to work together directly rather than 
in parallel through the World Bank. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
High Expectations from an Abu Mazen Government 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5.  (SBU) Gazans, el-Khodary said, want Abu Mazen in power 
even more than do West Bankers.  Not that they like him all 
that much, she added, but people in Gaza wistfully recalled 
the \"100 days\" of Abu Mazen\'s 2003 premiership during which 
there was a cease-fire and free passage through the Abu 
Khouli checkpoint that divides Gaza in half just north of 
Khan Yunis.  Gazans want Abu Mazen to get more workers into 
Israel or otherwise ensure jobs; that is concern number one, 
according to el-Khodary.  The Ambassador said that the United 
States is ready and willing to work with Abu Mazen, but that 
the USG should not be put in the position of acting as a 
substitute for him.  The fact that Abu Mazen has said openly 
that Palestinians should turn away from guns is very good, 
but he needs to take visible steps.  No one is asking him to 
go after militants right away, but it is imperative that the 
immediate need for law and order be addressed.  The 
Ambassador noted that if Abu Mazen begins to address 
security, even incrementally, Israeli officials have said 
that they will refrain from assassinations of militant 
leaders and hot pursuit attacks, with the exception of 
freedom to go after so-called ticking bombs. 
 
6.  (C) The Ambassador said that United States has also 
developed a package of proposals that it can rapidly deliver 
to help the expected Abu Mazen government show results to the 
Palestinian people in the first 90 days following the 
election.  These proposals are in addition to the larger 
projects and budgetary support offered to the PA at the AHLC 
meeting in Oslo earlier in December.  While it will be 
difficult to coax the GOI to commit to once again allow 
Palestinian workers into Israel, the U.S. has pressed Israel 
to keep an open mind on the subject, leaving open the 
possibility of a more positive GOI position should some of 
Abu Mazen\'s plans bear fruit. 
 
--------------------- 
And What About Hamas? 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (C) El-Khodary, who has wide-ranging contacts among many 
of the factions, said that Hamas wants to stop the attacks, 
but is holding out for a mutual cease-fire with Israel as 
well as positions (a \"large piece of the cake,\" as el-Khodary 
put it) in any post-election PA.  Other militant groups, in 
el-Khodary\'s opinion, would be inclined to cease attacks if 
the PA would offer them jobs, most likely in the security 
structures.  Contacts in Hamas, el-Khodary said, have told 
her that the organization, if not brought into the governing 
structures in a manner it considers sufficient, \"will turn 
(the situation) into hell.\"  El-Khodary conjectured that, if 
Hamas is actually brought into the government, either through 
elections or through appointments to ministries, \"they will 
behave.\" 
 
----------------------- 
International Observers 
----------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) El-Khodary questioned whether the international 
community would send observers into Gaza post-disengagement, 
either to deter conflicts or to investigate them afterwards. 
The Ambassador cautioned that such efforts, although 
well-intentioned, could easily go awry if, for example, the 
observers were used by militants as cover from which to 
launch attacks.  Another problem, the Ambassador continued, 
is that observers, by definition, do not have much authority 
to take action beyond filing a report -- something that 
experience in south Lebanon has shown loses its punch over 
time.

SUBJECT: WORLD BANK PROPOSALS SEEM AN UNLIKELY FIT AT KARNI 
TERMINAL 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Bill Weinstein for reasons 1.4 (b) an 
d (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary and Comment: On December 15 Emboffs toured 
the Israeli side of Karni Terminal, the site of a proposed 
World Bank pilot program of technological and management 
fixes that include replacing the current back-to-back 
shipping system with free-circulating trailers.  Situated on 
the eastern border of the Gaza Strip between Gaza City and 
the Nachal Oz settlement, Karni is an approximately 50-acre 
fenced area centered around a covered warehouse-type loading 
dock that runs the length of the facility and is cut in half 
longitudinally by a 25-foot high concrete wall.  The wall 
ensures complete separation between Israeli and Palestinians, 
and enforces the back-to-back system of shipping.  Gazan 
exports are removed from their containers on the Palestinian 
side of the terminal, sent through the wall via one of eight 
low-capacity scanners, and loaded onto Israeli trucks for 
onward shipping.  Gazan imports of raw materials and 
humanitarian goods are passed through the wall into 
restricted-access areas on the Palestinian side.  Fruits and 
vegetables are transferred via what general manager Yoni 
Doton called \"the lions\' cages\" -- vast warehouse-like rooms 
that operate like an airlock, in which one door is sealed 
when the second is open.  Terminal staff employs a modified 
2004 mobile scanner that can more quickly check empty 
containers leaving the Strip, and terminal management hope 
the addition of two more scanners will drastically increase 
capacity.  Both GOI and World Bank plans for further 
technological enhancements, however, must be accompanied by 
management strategies that take into account a civilian staff 
under military authority, as well as a physical 
infrastructure built more for security than economic 
efficiency.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Karni\'s Infrastructure of Separation 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (SBU) On December 15 Emboffs toured Karni Terminal, the 
Gaza Strip\'s primary trade gateway to Israel and the rest of 
the world.  Karni is the proposed site of a World Bank pilot 
program of technological and management fixes that center on 
replacing the back-to-back system of shipping with 
free-circulating trailers that can move between Israel and 
the Gaza Strip by switching drivers at the terminal.  Some 
GOI interlocutors have said Israel is willing to consider 
this idea in principle, but as yet the GOI has taken no 
concrete steps to actualize it.  At present, Karni\'s physical 
plant allows only back-to-back shipping.  The terminal is an 
approximately 50-acre fenced facility, its peripheral areas 
primarily devoted to truck parking and queuing, and its 
central focus a covered warehouse-style loading dock running 
the length of the facility and divided in half longitudinally 
by a twenty-five foot high concrete barrier.  There is no 
passage through the wall except via x-ray scanners and 
conveyor belts.  General manager Yoni Doton explained that 
when the Intifada began, the original open-air loading docks 
located at the terminal\'s southeastern edge were converted 
into storage sheds, and its walled section was expanded for 
exclusive use.  It now \"ensures complete separation\" between 
Israelis and Palestinians during cargo processing. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Current Capacity and GOI Projected Improvements 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3.  (C)  Karni now handles shipments into and out of the Gaza 
Strip in four versions of back-to-back: 
 
Gazan exports move as paletted cargo through one of eight 
x-ray scanners set into the wall that separates the Israeli 
and Palestinian sides of the terminal. 
Israeli exports of bulk items, raw materials, aggregates, and 
some livestock pass through the wall via chutes and conveyor 
belts into restricted-access areas on the Palestinian side, 
where cleared lift operators then transport the cargo to 
Palestinian trucks for onward shipping. 
Fresh produce for import and export is off- and on-loaded in 
airlock-style rooms built into the wall where only one door 
is opened at a time, maintaining the wall\'s \"security seal.\" 
A mobile scanner located in a separate walled area checks 
groups of empty containers and pallets leaving the Gaza 
Strip. 
 
GOI sources and terminal management state that Karni\'s total 
capacity for import and export using all four methods is 
approximately 450 truckloads per day since the implementation 
of stricter inspection measures following the March 2004 
bombing at Ashdod port, with an overall average since 2000 of 
approximately 500-550 truckloads per day.  (Note: COGAT 
figures are based on the number of 20-foot cargo bed trucks 
the terminal processes daily, rather than on .  End note.) 
With a proposed increase in hours of operation as well as the 
hoped-for addition of two new mobile scanners that will 
reportedly be used to check an additional 800-1,000 
containers per day, both empty and full, COGAT says terminal 
capacity will skyrocket to over 1,500 truckloads per day. 
 
----------------------- 
The World Bank Proposal 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The World Bank questions these estimates, however, 
asserting that better technology and additional working hours 
will not result in significant capacity increases if 
back-to-back, with its time-consuming and damaging element of 
completely dismantling and repacking shipments, remains in 
place.  They advocate instead a free circulating trailer 
system in which cargo is checked by a high-powered scanner 
without being removed from its container or pallet, and 
trucks are able to cross back and forth between Israel and 
Gaza by exchanging only drivers at the terminal. 
Drive-through saw-toothed loading docks, which the World Bank 
asserts will take up less space and facilitate quicker entry 
and exit for trucks, and an expanded terminal parking 
lot/truck queuing area will also be necessary in order to 
further address delays, the bank says. 
 
---------------------- 
Karni Operations Today 
---------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Terminal management says it remains committed to 
planned technological improvements that fit within the 
framework of Karni\'s existing system, and is doubtful that 
security can be assured under proposals that go beyond it, in 
particular the replacement of back-to-back with 
free-circulating trailers.  General Manager Doton told 
Emboffs he does not expect the GOI to significantly change 
Karni\'s four primary methods of cargo transfer: 
 
The Import Shed -- Gazan exports enter Israel via eight x-ray 
machines that  run through the wall.  Doton noted these 
scanners are nearly ten years old and can only process goods 
stacked to a maximum height of one meter.  This requires 
staff on both sides to dismantle most shipments, handling 
individual packages of fragile items like ceramic tiles, 
eggs, and bottles, a process which Doton conceded often 
results in product damage.  Doton said the scanners\' hourly 
rate varies with types of shipments -- during a 15-minute 
visit inside the import shed Emboffs did not witness any 
shipments coming through the scanners. 
 
\"Direct Transfer\" and \"Direct Pouring\" -- Imports into the 
Gaza Strip, including wood, plastics, textiles, aggregates, 
oil, grains and flour, present much less of a security risk 
than Gazan exports, and are sent through the wall via chutes 
or conveyor belts into restricted-areas on the Palestinian 
side for reloading.  This is the sole means of entry into 
Gaza both for raw materials crucial to Gazan factory owners, 
and for humanitarian supplies distributed by relief 
organizations like UNRWA, OCHA, and ICRC.  Lt. Col. Itzhak 
Gurvitch, head of COGAT\'s Economic branch, noted what he 
called an additional drawback to the system -- too few chutes 
and belts means that every truckload of raw materials passing 
through the terminal takes the place of a truckload of 
humanitarian goods, and vice versa.  He said that terminal 
management must try to balance this \"opportunity cost\" based 
on a daily stocktaking of economic and humanitarian concerns 
within Gaza.  (Note: Gazan businessmen point out one of the 
negative effects of low capacity on Palestinian-side terminal 
operations as well -- businessmen must pay baksheesh to 
terminal management to ensure their cargo is not moved to the 
end of a register whose order is consistently disrupted by 
influential requests for precedence.  End note.) 
 
The Lion\'s Cage\" -- Fresh produce is transferred via a series 
of vast rooms approximately 25 feet high, 25 feet wide, and 
100 feet deep, with bay doors that open to both the Israeli 
and Palestinian sides of the terminal.  These doors are only 
opened one at a time during loading and unloading, Doton 
said, \"like a lion\'s cage.\"  Israeli staff monitors the rooms 
via closed circuit television when the doors are open to the 
Palestinian side.  Doton pointed out five feet of wire 
netting that closes the gaps between the ceiling and the side 
walls in each room, explaining that in 2003 a Palestinian 
gunman entered one room while Palestinian staff were working, 
climbed the wall, and opened fire through the gap on two 
Israeli staff working in an adjacent room, killing one and 
injuring the second. 
 
The Mobile Scanner -- Doton showed Emboffs the terminal\'s 
newest technological addition, a 2004-model mobile container 
scanner that PA Minister of Finance Salaam Fayyad purchased 
from China and that Israeli terminal management modified and 
installed in August 2004.  \"The solution to the problem of 
security is this kind of technology\", said Doton.  With the 
scanner, terminal staff is able to check groups of five 
trucks hauling 20-foot containers or pallets leaving Gaza in 
less than ten minutes, with another eight to ten minutes for 
analysis of the x-rays from the scan.  Running without 
interruptions the scanner could ideally process approximately 
130 truckloads a day, a number that would drastically cut 
waiting time for containers at Karni and address the problem 
of high demurrage costs that Gazan businesses and relief 
organizations currently pay the shipping companies to whom 
the containers belong.  (Note: Relief organizations state 
that the GOI originally assured them and Gazan businessmen 
that the scanner had a capacity of 400-500 containers per 
day.  They add that the scanner processes approximately 100 
containers sporadically, with that number being much lower on 
many days.  Terminal and COGAT personnel cite frequent 
IDF-instituted closures of the terminal, as well as 
difficulties training new personnel on the scanner, as 
reasons the scanner\'s reported inconsistent output.  End 
note.) 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Karni\'s Management Quandary: 
Civilian Staff in a Militarized Environment 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Doton is optimistic about the potential for more 
and better scanner technology to bring Karni up to full 
capacity.  Technology is only one component of the terminal\'s 
functioning, however, and an uncertain security situation as 
well as a complex management structure also hinder 
improvements.  The semi-private Israel Airports Authority 
(IAA) handles the terminal\'s daily operations, working on a 
for-profit basis and therefore ostensibly committed to 
efficient cargo processing.  Yet an order from the IDF or 
Shin Bet can shut down operations on a moment\'s notice, even 
in the middle of the day, making it difficult for the IAA to 
maintain consistency.  (Note: IAA investment in Karni is NIS 
30 million while revenues are closer to NIS 20 million.  The 
GOI finances any operating deficits. End note.) 
 
7.  (SBU) During the tour, the sounds of gunfire called 
Emboffs\' attention to an IDF tunnel-searching operation in 
nearby Nachal Oz settlement.  Doton noted that since all but 
seven to ten of Karni\'s employees are temporary workers, and 
the vast majority are young people drawn from isolated and 
lower-income \"development towns\", many of them simply do not 
show up to work when the security situation is bad.  \"These 
kids make less than four thousand shekels a month.  Their 
families won\'t let them risk their lives for that kind of 
money.\"

SUBJECT: SHIMON PERES SAYS ECONOMIC AID NEEDED TO STABILIZE 
NEW \"IMPROVED\" PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
. 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Labor Party Leader Shimon Peres told Codel 
Lieberman and the Ambassador December 27 that the Palestinian 
humanitarian situation is \"quite serious,\" and acknowledged 
that Israel has a \"window of opportunity\" to advance the 
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  Calling the Palestinian 
political system \"broken,\" Peres said that internal divisions 
among Palestinian leaders are complicating their efforts to 
gain legitimacy and stabilize a new government.  He told 
Senator Lieberman that the U.S. should provide assistance to 
the Palestinians through corporate investments and the World 
Bank, rather than via direct aid.  Senate staff members, 
military escort and poloff also accompanied Senator 
Lieberman.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC NEEDS/NEW LEADERSHIP 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Peres told Senator Lieberman that the humanitarian 
situation in Gaza is \"heartbreaking\" and that Israel and the 
U.S. should \"act in a hurry.\"   He praised Acting PLO 
Chairman Abu Mazen as a well-intentioned, serious leader, 
adding that Israel could not find a better partner. 
Referring to Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Ala\'a, Peres said 
\"we hope that we will work well together.\" 
 
3.  (C) Senator Lieberman told Peres that the Palestinian 
Minister of Negotiation Affairs, Sa\'eb Erekat said in an 
earlier meeting (Congen Jerusalem septel) that he will be 
very focused on economic changes within the Palestinian 
territories, especially following the January 9 elections. 
Peres replied that the Palestinians need \"immediate economic 
assistance\" and that a concentrated effort by the U.S. and 
European donors to mobilize the economy is necessary.  He 
suggested that instead of giving the Palestinians money 
directly, the U.S. should encourage its 50 largest 
corporations, each of which Peres described as having larger 
budgets than most countries, to invest in the Palestinian 
territories.  He specifically noted that Motorola and 
Hewlett-Packard had positively impacted Jordan\'s economy by 
opening offices there.  Peres said that the GOI will not 
increase the number of Palestinians working in Israel in the 
future.  Peres opined that the World Bank could manage 
economic development in the Palestinian territories and that 
the U.S. should empower the World Bank to provide immediate 
help to the Palestinians.  He added, however, that the 
Palestinians should not receive special treatment. 
 
4.  (C) Ambassador Kurtzer noted that the U.S. is currently 
withholding some of its financial assistance to the 
Palestinian Authority because of continuing safety concerns 
in Gaza and the failure of the PA to undertake security 
measures, as demonstrated by the lack of investigative 
cooperation following the October 2003 attack on a U.S. 
convoy in Gaza. 
 
------------------ 
GAZA DISENGAGEMENT 
------------------ 
 
5.  (C) Turning to the Gaza disengagement plan, Peres 
predicted that Israeli troops will withdraw on time, in 
mid-2005, and said that Israel will implement unspecified 
\"more permanent solutions\" during and immediately following 
this withdrawal.  Peres also suggested an \"interim solution,\" 
in which Israel would withdraw from the Philadelphi strip and 
thus allow Palestinians to move to and from Egypt.  Peres 
suggested that a fleet of helicopters to patrol the area 
could assuage Israeli security concerns.  Peres also said 
that the full impact of the Gaza disengagement would not be 
known for at least one year after completion and told Senator 
Lieberman that the 2006 Israeli general elections could 
influence the Israeli political landscape and future 
disengagement plans.  Peres predicted that the pace of 
negotiations with the Palestinians will increase following 
Gaza disengagement in 2005. 
 
6.  (C) Commenting on former PA Gaza security chief Mohammad 
Dahlan and former West Bank security chief Jibril Rijoub, 
Peres said \"we are trying to ensure that they are not accused 
of being agents or semi-agents of Israel.\"  He said that 
Israel is considering another release of Palestinian 
prisoners in the near future.  Peres said \"there is not much 
Israel can do with or without Dahlan.\" 
 
------------- 
THE U.S. ROLE 
------------- 
 
7.  (C) Peres emphasized that any international financial 
assistance to the Palestinians, especially by the U.S., 
should be contingent on the Palestinian Authority \"putting 
its house in order.\"  Peres said that the Palestinians must 
be helped and that Israel should begin dialogue with Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad.  He said that \"Sharon is at the center\" of 
this process, but that any policy of not talking with the 
Palestinians until Israel leaves Gaza is \"too long a period 
of time.\"  Peres said that Abu Mazen cannot completely stop 
the violence, but that he can \"start fighting terror any 
time.\"  Peres concluded by saying that while he is \"not blind 
to the difficulties ahead\" there is a window of opportunity 
for peace and that Abu Mazen is a good choice of partners. 
 
8.  (U) Codel Lieberman did not clear this message.

SUBJECT: ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER OFFERS CAUTIOUSLY 
OPTIMISTIC ASSESSMENT OF CHANCES FOR ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN 
SECURITY COOPERATION 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer; Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  During a meeting on December 30, Israeli 
Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz gave Senator Lieberman and the 
Ambassador a cautiously optimistic assessment of the chances 
for security cooperation with post-Arafat Palestinian 
leaders.  Mofaz said that disengagement will increase 
Israel\'s security and permit the government to \"start a 
dialogue and implement the road map.\"  He acknowledged that 
the new Palestinian leaders will need time to dismantle the 
terrorist infrastructure, but insisted that they stop 
incitement and actual terrorist attacks quickly.  Mofaz 
described cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian forces 
in the field as \"very good.\"  He raised Syrian and Iranian 
threats, noting that Syria supports terrorism, headquarters 
Palestinian groups in Damascus, continues to station troops 
in Lebanon, and permits Hizballah to operate against Israel. 
Mofaz urged the U.S. to take the lead with the Europeans and 
pursue all diplomatic solutions, including sanctions and 
thorough inspections, required to halt the Iranian\'s 
enrichment process.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Mofaz Upbeat on Possible Security Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a December 28 meeting with Senator Joseph 
Lieberman, the Ambassador, Senate staff and military escort 
from the CoDel, Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz noted 
that Arafat\'s death has resulted in a \"dramatic\" change and a 
\"historic opportunity.\"  He expressed hope that the upcoming 
elections will produce a \"responsible and effective 
leadership ... to lead the Palestinian people in a new 
direction.\"  Mofaz said that disengagement will increase 
Israel\'s security and permit the government to \"start a 
dialogue and implement the road map.\" 
 
3. (C) Senator Lieberman said he had also detected a 
willingness for a \"a new beginning\" among Palestinian leaders 
and asked Mofaz specifically what steps Israel wanted them to 
take to return to the road map.  Mofaz replied that he thinks 
the new Palestinian leaders are serious about stopping 
terror, but Israel must wait and see how they act after the 
elections.  He expressed hope that a post-election dialogue 
will lead to Israeli-Palestinian coordination on the 
disengagement plan.  He added that the PA must reform its 
security services, reduce the number of independent 
organizations, and unify command.  \"We need to see one rule, 
one authority, one gun,\" he said.  Senator Lieberman 
commented that the Palestinian leaders themselves had 
admitted that their security infrastructure is \"chaotic.\"  He 
asked if the Palestinians would benefit from U.S. training. 
The Defense Minister noted that Egypt has already agreed to 
train PA security officers. 
 
4. (C) Mofaz acknowledged that the new Palestinian leaders 
will need time to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure.  He 
insisted, however, that they must stop incitement and actual 
terrorist attacks quickly.  Senator Lieberman asked Mofaz to 
elaborate on the difference between ending attacks and 
dismantling infrastructure.  Mofaz replied that the first 
step is to prevent new attacks.  The longer-term 
dismantlement includes disarming terrorist groups, collecting 
illegal weapons, and preventing re-supply by smugglers. 
 
5. (C) Senator Lieberman asked about the status of 
cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. 
Mofaz noted that the two sides have \"very good coordination 
in the field,\" primarily in the West Bank.  He said Israel 
had worked well with Dahlan when he was security chief, but 
will now have to \"wait and see\" which Palestinian official 
will command the security forces. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Mofaz Raises Syrian and Iranian Threats 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Mofaz complained that Syria supports terrorism, 
headquarters Palestinian groups in Damascus, continues to 
station troops in Lebanon, and permits Hizballah to operate 
against Israel.  He said that \"Syria is deeply involved in 
terrorism against U.S. forces in Iraq\" and insisted that 
Damascus has \"no real intent\" to negotiate peace with Israel. 
 Mofaz listed three conditions for serious peace talks: the 
removal of Palestinian terrorist groups from Syrian 
territory; the \"dismantlement\" of Hizballah (which he said 
supports Palestinian terrorists by channeling to them Syrian, 
Iranian, and Saudi resources); and the return of 
responsibility for southern Lebanon to Lebanese military 
forces.  Senator Lieberman agreed that Syrian peace overtures 
are intended to distract the international community from 
what Syria is doing in Iraq and Lebanon.  He said Congress is 
currently examining its options on how to deal with the 
problem. 
7. (C) Mofaz cautioned that Iran is \"very close -- less than 
one year away --\" from enriching uranium, which he described 
as a \"point of no return\" for the Iranian nuclear program. 
This effort is widely supported by the Iranian government and 
Majlis, he said.  Mofaz confided that Israel \"does not see 
results\" from the EU-3 negotiations with Iran, which he 
described as an effort by Tehran to buy time to complete the 
enrichment process.  He urged the U.S. to take the lead with 
the Europeans and pursue all diplomatic solutions, including 
sanctions and thorough inspections, required to halt the 
Iranian\'s enrichment process.  He said that such an effort 
could lead to success, but \"time is running out.\"  Mofaz 
described Iran, with its extremist regime, support for 
terrorism, and long-range surface-to-surface missiles, as a 
threat to Europe and the rest of the free world.  Senator 
Lieberman told the Israelis that he believed the U.S. is 
ready to actively participate in the diplomatic and U.N. 
processes to stop the Iranian program, but he expressed 
skepticism that the Europeans and Russia would commit to 
effective sanctions. 
 
8. (U) Mofaz was accompanied by MOD Director General Amos 
Yaron, Director of MOD Director for Military-Political 
Affairs Amos Gilad, Chief of Staff Ami Shafran, Military 
Secretary to the Minister BG Etan Dangott, Media Adviser Eli 
 
SIPDIS 
Kamir, and MFA Director for Congress Meirav Eilon-Shahar. 
Senator Lieberman did not clear this message before his 
departure.

SUBJECT: PROBLEMS UNLIKELY TO IMPEDE EARLY JANUARY 
GOVERNMENT FORMATION 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1.  (C) Problems with prospective coalition partners Labor 
and United Torah Judaism are delaying PM Sharon\'s efforts to 
put together a viable coalition, but should not prevent 
establishment of a new government in early January. 
Negotiators are generating alternative mechanisms to give 
Labor leader Shimon Peres a suitably august title and to give 
UTJ the additional authority over its religious institutions 
that party leaders seek.  Sharon and Labor leader Peres both 
continue to display confidence that they will bring together 
a majority coalition. 
 
2.  (C) The Attorney General forced a backstep when he 
chastised hard-racing negotiators for trying to change 
overnight the country\'s constitution-like Basic Law to give 
Peres an \"acting prime minister\" title like currently held by 
Ehud Olmert.  As a result, negotiators are now pursuing a 
change to the separate \"Government Law\" that would give Peres 
a \"vice prime minister\" title.  The action leaves Olmert with 
all of his current powers and retains his clear designation 
as acting prime minister should Sharon to be incapacitated. 
This proposal, or another with a similar aim, is likely to 
speed through committee and full Knesset approval the week of 
January 2. 
 
3.  (C) UTJ is having second thoughts over its \"price\" for 
joining the coalition.  UTJ leaders, who continue to decline 
taking Cabinet seats, reportedly are now seeking a greater 
degree of independence from the state education system for 
their religious institutions.  Observers indicate that 
Sharon, who was willing to see the secular Shinui party leave 
the coalition as the cost of bringing in a religious party, 
will come up with a formulation that keeps UTJ in his new 
majority coalition. 
 
4.  (C) Within his own party, Sharon faces continuing efforts 
by disengagement foe Uzi Landau to derail the new coalition 
-- and thus disengagement itself.  Landau and about a dozen 
other Likud MKs say they plan to vote against a 
Likud-Labor-UTJ coalition.  Sharon, however, requires only a 
simply Knesset majority for government formation, and, with 
expected abstentions, he appears to hold a 56-42 majority in 
favor. 
 
5.  (C) The closer Sharon gets to the critical January 
Cabinet vote on evacuation of settlements, the stronger the 
motivation for Labor to have secured its seats at the Cabinet 
table.  As the disengagement vote approaches, so too does the 
deadline for passing the budget, providing an incentive for 
UTJ to sign on and secure the financial and other gains it 
has negotiated as its price for joining the government.  In 
addition, the longer negotiations take, the more UTJ leaders 
will face pressure to walk away from a coalition deal.  Prime 
Minister Sharon\'s Haredi (ultra-orthodox) affairs advisor, 
Rivka Paluch, told the Ambassador this week that UTJ 
spiritual leader Elyashiv is coming under pressure to not 
join the coalition from settlers who are deluging him with 
letters claiming severe emotional suffering by the children 
of settlers scheduled for evacuation.  Elyashiv also 
reportedly fears that a Labor Party Minister of 
Communications might liberalize laws regulating Internet 
pornography.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media led with reports of scuffles between settlers 
and IDF troops who came to evacuate two caravans at the 
West Bank settlement of Yitzhar, including an incident 
in which a soldier fired warning shots at settlers as 
they tried to strip him of his rifle.  Ha\'aretz cited 
the belief of the IDF General Staff that the time has 
come to start cracking down on Israelis who use 
violence against soldiers and policemen in the 
territories.  Leading media reported that Monday dozens 
of settlers built protest tents near the Knesset. 
 
This morning, Israel Radio reported that seven 
Palestinians were killed by a shell fired by an IDF 
tank in Beit Lahiya near the Erez Crossing, following 
the launching of a rocket at a bus transporting Israeli 
children.  The radio cited Palestinian claims that five 
of the slain people were children aged 12 to 17, and 
IDF allegations that the killed Palestinians were older 
Hamas militants. 
 
Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli military sources as 
saying that, thanks to Abdul Qadeer Khan, the chief 
architect of Pakistan\'s nuclear bomb, either Syria, 
Egypt or Saudi Arabia now has the potential to achieve 
a \"significant nuclear leap.\"  The quote comes days 
after Mossad chief Ephraim Halevy expressed fear that 
one of those countries might have acquired some kind of 
nuclear capability via an illicit weapons trafficking 
network run by Khan. 
 
All media reported that defying condemnation from Hamas 
and other radical factions in the Gaza Strip, PLO 
Chairman Mahmoud Abbas on Monday reiterated a demand 
for an end to rocket attacks against Israeli targets. 
Some media said that Abbas\'s remarks were spurred by a 
statement made Sunday by Secretary of State Colin 
Powell that he found Abbas\'s failure to distance 
himself from the radical al-Aqsa Martyrs\' Brigades 
\"disturbing.\"  The media also reported that Monday 
Abbas promised Palestinians refugees that they will be 
able to return home one day, and that he vowed not to 
take up arms against militants. 
 
All media reported that right-wing activists are making 
use of a 1994 interview in which Sharon urged soldiers 
not to obey orders that go against their conscience. 
The activists have been distributing a recording of 
Sharon\'s remarks to IDF conscripts. Hatzofe reported 
that Monday the National Religious Party decided to 
offer Shas and National Union the option to join its 
efforts against the disengagement plan. 
Jerusalem Post reported that officials from Pakistan, 
Yemen, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, all Muslim countries 
without diplomatic ties with Israel, will arrive by the 
end of the week to take part in the international team 
monitoring the PA election.  The newspaper quoted Amir 
Maimon, the Foreign Ministry official in charge of 
coordination for the election monitors, as saying they 
will be part of an 80-person team put together by the 
U.S. National Democratic Institute (NDI), the foreign 
policy arm of the Democratic Party.  Jerusalem Post 
also cited an IDF denial of Palestinian claims that 
Rizik Ziad Musleh, a high school student campaigning 
for Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, a candidate in the upcoming 
PA chairmanship elections, was killed by soldiers last 
Thursday near Rafah. 
 
Turkish FM Abdullah Gul was quoted as saying Monday in 
an interview with Ha\'aretz that Turkey believes that 
Syria is serious about making peace with Israel, and 
that that Ankara hopes to receive a positive response 
from Jerusalem to the message Gul is bringing with him 
from Damascus. 
 
Yediot reported that Lakhdar Brahimi, Special Adviser 
to the Secretary-General of the UN, has told a Belgian 
Senate delegation that Sharon is a murderer.  The 
newspaper reported that the Foreign Ministry has 
instructed the Israeli Representative to the UN to 
present a strong protest to Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan, and that has it also instructed the U.S. Embassy 
in Washington to raise the issue with the State 
Department. 
 
Yediot cited the GOI\'s confirmation that FM Silvan 
Shalom will visit Jordan this month.  Yediot quoted the 
Jordanian newspaper Al-Arab Al-Yawm as saying Sunday 
that during Shalom\'s visit, Israel will release several 
Jordanian prisoners. 
 
Yediot reported that, following the Iranian nuclear 
threat and concerns about world terror, the Mossad has 
requested additional funding from the Knesset\'s secret 
services subcommittee. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the Foreign Ministry has opened 
a bank account for private contributions for the 
victims of the South Asian tsunami, and that it is 
considering sending around 20 mobile water purifiers to 
the countries that were hit by the disaster.  Leading 
media reported that IsraAid, a coordinating body of 
Jewish organizations worldwide and NGOs based in 
Israel, is spearheading the Israel Campaign For 
Southeast Asia Disaster, a global Jewish relief 
campaign to aid the victims of the disaster. 
 
Yediot and Maariv cited the results of a poll conducted 
in the UK by the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph: 
-\"Which country do you hate most?\"  Israel: 37 percent 
of respondents; India: 29 percent; Egypt and China: 24 
percent.  (Cited in Maariv.) 
-Respondents found the most dangerous country to be: 
U.S.: 37 percent; Israel: 33 percent; Egypt; 21 
percent.  (Cited in Yediot.) 
 
Jerusalem Post cited a street survey conducted in 
Orlando, FL, by the International Society for Sephardic 
Progress: 63 percent of respondents did not know what 
Auschwitz-Birkenau was.

I.  \"Blood Is Going To Be Spilled\" 
 
Columnist Avraham Tirosh wrote on page one of popular, 
pluralist Maariv (January 4): \"Let it be clear, 
Monday\'s struggle [at the West Bank settlement of 
Yitzhar], from the perspective of the settlers who 
clashed with the police and the soldiers, was not over 
those two patently illegal trailers stuck out there on 
some desolate hilltop.  It was over the settlements in 
the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria.  And it sent a 
message that is unequivocal, terrible and causes 
despair: when the time comes for the big evacuation, if 
we get there, there is going to be gunfire, blood is 
going to be spilled, and all the institutions in Israel 
will collapse.  Kingdoms have already fallen because of 
civil war.  And, terrifyingly enough, there isn\'t 
anyone who is capable of preventing it.  Maybe just 
that old rabbi [United Torah Judaism party mentor Rabbi 
Yosef Shalom Elyashiv], who is shut in his house in 
Jerusalem right now, deliberating whether to breathe 
life into the Sharon government and the disengagement 
plan, or to force early elections that will delay and 
may even dash the big evacuation and, by so doing, the 
plague of fire and blood that threatens us.\" 
 
II.  \"Free and Open to All\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(January 4): \"Five days before the Palestinian 
Authority\'s election day, one gets the impression that 
Israel is uncertain that this is truly its heart\'s 
desire.... The elections, say the Palestinians, with 
the backing of international monitors, must be free in 
the fullest sense of the word.  What such freedom means 
is that every person must be able to come to the polls 
without fear or pressure in order to exercise his right 
to vote.  But it is doubtful that Palestinians fearful 
of IDF gunfire or lengthy delays at checkpoints will 
want to leave their houses to participate in the 
elections.  Israel ought to have a keen interest in the 
political legitimacy that Abu Mazen is seeking.... 
Those who are demanding a new diplomatic program from 
the Palestinians -- an end to incitement and the 
disarming of the militias and gangs -- should know that 
this cannot be achieved via a Palestinian leadership 
that lacks public support.   To achieve this result, 
Israel must cease the political miserliness that has 
characterized it to date and immediately take steps 
that will prove -- not only to the Palestinians, but 
also to the Israeli public and international observers 
-- that it truly intends the Palestinian Authority 
election to be free and open to all.\" 
 
III.  \"Dancing With Wolves\" 
 
Veteran print and TV journalist Dan Margalit wrote in 
Maariv (January 4): \"Mahmoud Abbas -- a.k.a. Abu Mazen 
-- is dancing with the wolves. He fraternizes with 
Hamas, snuggles up to Islamic Jihad and promises the 
terrorists that he will not disarm them.  Just the 
opposite, he says he will protect them.  Israel is 
giving him credit, which boils down only to election 
PR.  When the polls close on January 9, his romance 
with terror is meant to come to an end....  After all, 
the candidate for the Palestinian Authority leadership 
rejected the armed conflict at the beginning of the 
Intifada in 2000.  We have to hope. But we also have to 
ask ourselves what will happen if this doesn\'t take 
place.  Abu Mazen has a biography of weakness in the 
face of Palestinian terror.... In the lack of an 
agreement with Abu Mazen and with terror continuing, 
the IDF will not be able to withdraw from the Gaza 
Strip along with the settlers.... To evacuate Gush 
Katif under fire, Israel must announce to itself that 
the Gush Katif bloc is more of a liability than an 
asset.  Will a Likud-headed government, even one that 
has already gone a long and dramatic way from what 
Sharon promised in the elections to what he is 
proposing now, be capable of doing this?  It is too 
early to know.  The chances are still good that Abu 
Mazen will come to his senses and distance himself from 
terror after the Palestinian polling booths close.  An 
orderly transfer of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority 
serves the interests of all sides, except for the 
terrorists.  But when Sharon brings the issue of 
disengagement to his cabinet this month for a decision, 
the thinking on the worst-case scenario should already 
have been done.  Withdrawal must be done with eyes wide 
open.\" 
 
IV.  \"Two Arab Elections\" 
 
The Director of the Interdisciplinary Center\'s Global 
Research in International Affairs Center, columnist 
Barry Rubin, wrote in conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post (January 4): \"Strange but revealing: the 
two fairest elections in Arab history are about to be 
held due only to foreign pressure and presence.  They 
also say a great deal about the direction of Arab 
politics and likely developments during 2005.  In both 
cases the fact that Iraqi and Palestinian leaders will 
be determined via a ballot box is encouraging, 
signaling a growing interest in democracy, human 
rights, and moderation.... [Still,] the [Iraqi] 
election may lay the basis for a civil war, or at least 
heightened ethnic antagonism and strife.  The 
Palestinian situation is somewhat parallel. Fatah is 
the dominant party and Abu Mazen will be elected 
because he is its candidate.  That powerful (though 
undisciplined) organization is still in the hands of 
hard-liners, who are not ready for a real peace with 
Israel, or for genuine democracy.  At the same time, 
Fatah is ready to make deals with other forces -- its 
own young insurgents and Hamas -- that will block any 
real change or hopes for peace.... The possibility of a 
popular regime exists in both cases, as well as a 
stable government in Iraq and a cease-fire for the 
Palestinians.  Yet existing ideologies and political 
structures are in conflict with democratic processes, 
while the big problems and difficult choices remain to 
be confronted after Election Day.\" 
 
V.  \"Sharon Is Already Reaping Rewards\" 
 
Liberal columnist B. Michael wrote in mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (January 4): \"Those who have 
refused to understand by themselves the purpose of the 
disengagement [plan] received another chance to do so. 
In an interview granted by Atty. [Dov] Weisglass to 
Ha\'aretz, he almost childishly detailed with frankness 
and pride the truth hiding behind the Sharon plan.... 
Sharon\'s true inclination can be uncovered when one 
compares the various aspects of his activity concerning 
disengagement.  \'Activity\' in the full meaning of the 
word is taking place in the West Bank: bulldozers are 
crushing, trees are being uprooted, fences are jumped 
over, houses are being built, roads are being paved, 
millions of shekels are being buried among the rocks. 
On the other hand, regarding disengagement, Sharon has 
(so far) taken care of its verbal ... part.... No 
budget allocated to the settlements has been cut.... 
What to do, disengagement is a typical Sharon bluff. 
There indeed is no way but to support it, be it only in 
order to expose the cheat.  But there\'s no reason to 
enthuse about it.  However, God willing -- or God 
forbid -- should it be implemented, one wouldn\'t know 
whether it would then cause even greater harm.\"

1. (C) Summary: A GOI working group charged with developing a 
five-year plan on Holocaust-era reparations, pensions and 
restitution is considering a recommendation that the GOI ask 
Germany for about $500 million -- possibly in the form of new 
German-made submarines -- in compensation for what the GOI 
says is that portion of the 1953 German-Israeli reparations 
agreement that had been attributed to East Germany, but never 
paid.  A working group member from the PM\'s office, Aharon 
Mor (strictly protect), contended that such a GOI claim would 
not violate any \"closure\" agreements about Holocaust-era 
claims because it would be based on the unfulfilled portion 
of a preexisting agreement.  The working group also expects 
to call for renewed GOI efforts to resolve Holocaust-era 
pension issues within five years and to settle all unresolved 
property and asset issues.   End summary. 
 
2. (C) Mor, who is senior advisor in the Prime Minister,s 
Office on Restitution of Rights and Jewish Property, 
informally previewed elements of the GOI,s not-yet-adopted 
&five-year action plan8 on Holocaust-era reparations, 
pensions and restitution, in a December 8 meeting with 
emboff.  (Strictly protect Mor, per his request.)  He 
emphasized that the action plan, which includes renewed 
claims against Germany and Poland, is still in draft, and is 
being vetted with major Holocaust survivor organizations.  It 
has not yet, therefore, gone forward to the GOI,s newly 
created Ministerial Commission on Restitution for Jewish 
Rights and Property, nor to the full GOI, for review and 
adoption as official policy. 
 
3.  (U)  The text of the GOI Cabinet decision that 
established the Commission is at:

Draft GOI Approach/Action Plan 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Mor said that a working group including himself and 
Nimrod Barkan, head of the MFA\'s World Jewish Affairs Bureau, 
was tasked in late 2003 with drafting and submitting to the 
Ministerial Commission a &five-year plan of action8 on 
Holocaust restitution and related issues.  The draft, which 
is nearing completion, could be put forward to the 
Ministerial Commission as early as January/February 2005, Mor 
said.  The report is likely to recommend that the GOI: 
 
-- Work to close all outstanding Holocaust-era reparations 
issues within the next five years, including, in particular, 
what Mor said is a still-unpaid sum from the 1953 West 
Germany)Israel agreement. 
 
-- Work to complete all issues related to Holocaust-era 
pensions within the next five years, while survivors are 
still living. 
 
-- Continue the strongest possible diplomatic action on all 
fronts to secure full restitution of property and assets, 
including heirless property and assets.  Mor said that no 
time limit would apply to this effort, and that the GOI would 
continue work on the issue until it accounts for every asset. 
 (Note: In previous discussions and e-mails, Mor indicated to 
Emboff and EUR/OHI that his draft paper would also include a 
recommendation for the GOI to press for restitution for 
Jewish property and assets in Arab lands from which Jews 
fled.) 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Likely Israel Bilateral Approach to Germany 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Regarding Germany, Mor noted that, according to the 
working group,s research, Israel is still due money from its 
1953 Holocaust reparations agreement with West Germany.  He 
said that the amount is one-third of the $845 million agreed 
to in the deal, and represents an amount that West Germany 
reportedly said East Germany would be responsible for paying, 
but that East Germany never paid.  Most of the amount paid to 
Israel under the 1953 agreement was in the form of goods 
transferred from West Germany to Israel.  In this case, 
Israel is considering a request for military goods, probably 
two submarines, worth about $500 million, he said.  (Note: 
Mor was undoubtedly referring to Dolphin-class submarines, 
three of which the GOI received in the early 1990s from 
Germany.  The model now sought by the Israeli Navy costs 
about $350-500 million per submarine.) 
 
6. (C) &This does not constitute a new claim,8 Mor took 
pains to point out.  Rather, he argued, it stems from 
incomplete implementation of an existing agreement, and, as 
such, should not come under the terms of any agreement with 
the United States not to raise new reparations claims against 
Germany.  He noted that he reviewed his analysis with Amb. 
Stuart Eizenstat, the former U.S. special envoy for 
Holocaust-era property claims, when Eizenstat visited Israel 
in November.  According to Mor, Eizenstat concurred that 
nothing in the U.S. closure agreement with Germany in 2000 
would preclude Israel from independently seeking redress of 
an issue stemming from a preexisting agreement.  Mor said he 
hoped that the U.S. would not do anything that could be seen 
as opposing or undermining Israel,s bilateral approach to 
Germany.  Mor agreed to emboff\'s request to keep the embassy 
and U.S. Special Envoy O\'Donnell apprised of working group 
deliberations and other matters of potential U.S. interest, 
and to brief the Ambassador on the restitution plan as it 
nears completion. 
----------------------------------- 
Future Work: Poland and Arab States 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Finally, Mor noted that Poland would likely be the 
next area of focus of the GOI restitution efforts, and that 
the GOI would work in close coordination with the World 
Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO) and the other main 
survivor and restitution bodies in Israel and abroad.  All of 
the above are in addition to the GOI Ministerial Committee,s 
continuing research into expanding pursuit of restitution 
claims for Jewish property and assets from Arab lands.

Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The major media led with stories related to the right 
wing\'s opposition to PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan. 
Reporting on testimony Shin Bet head Avi Dichter gave 
before the Knesset\'s Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee Tuesday, Maariv bannered: \"The Black 
Prophesy\" and Yediot: \"Nightmare Scenario.\"  Dichter 
envisaged, among other possibilities, a situation in 
which armed settlers would fake shooting by soldiers 
during the evacuation of a settlement in order to 
create panic, to which settlers would respond by firing 
live shots at IDF soldiers.  Israel Radio reported that 
Sharon and Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz have called for 
punishing people who would harm or threaten members of 
the security forces.  Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post 
reported that right-wing extremists, who Ha\'aretz says 
are close to the outlawed Kach movement, called on 
reserve soldiers Tuesday to help thwart the 
disengagement planned for this summer.  Ha\'aretz 
reported that Deputy Defense Minister Zeev Boim asked A- 
G Menachem Mazuz to look into indicting the extremists. 
Ha\'aretz reported that the residents of the Katif Bloc 
(Gush Katif) have adopted the color orange as the 
symbol of their fight, comparing the revolution they 
want to generate to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. 
 
The media also quoted Dichter as saying that abandoning 
the Philadelphi route would turn the Gaza Strip into a 
new South Lebanon. 
 
Leading media quoted senior IDF officers as saying that 
organizers of petitions against the disengagement plan 
being circulated among soldiers should be arrested. 
However, Dichter and some officers were quoted as 
saying that arrests of opponents of disengagement -- 
Dichter was asked about a group planning to attack the 
Temple Mount -- might not meet legal requirements. 
 
All media reported that PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu 
Mazen) branded Israel the \"Zionist enemy\" Tuesday, 
during an election tour of the Gaza Strip.  Abbas was 
responding to the killing of seven Palestinians in the 
northern Strip Tuesday by fire from an IDF tank. 
Nonetheless, Jerusalem Post quoted senior officials in 
the Prime Minister\'s Office as saying that Sharon hopes 
to meet Abbas soon after his expected election as 
Palestinian leader on January 9. 
 
Israel Radio reported that a terrorist who infiltrated 
the Erez Crossing this morning was killed and that his 
companion escaped.  Hamas and Islamic Jihad jointly 
claimed responsibility for the action.  Leading media 
reported on continued shelling of Israeli targets in 
the western Negev and the Gaza Strip Tuesday and this 
morning.  (Israel Radio and leading Israeli web sites 
reported that 12 IDF soldiers were wounded this morning 
in a Qassam rocket attack on a northern Gaza Strip 
outpost.)  Leading media reported that Tuesday the army 
closed Ramallah following unconfirmed reports of 
soldiers\' abductions. 
 
Israel Radio cited a statement released by \"Free People 
of the Galilee,\" a hitherto unknown group, claiming to 
have kidnapped AmCit Dana Bennet in the summer of 2003. 
The group allegedly wants Israel to release 1,000 
Palestinian prisoners in exchange for information about 
Bennet\'s fate. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited an announcement by the \"cash- 
strapped\" Jerusalem Municipality Tuesday that it has 
set up 15 bulletin boards in East Jerusalem at a cost 
of 20,000 shekels (about USD 4,500) to allow candidates 
for the PA election to post ads.  Leading media 
reported that, in a televised ad sponsored by the 
international organization One Voice, which will be 
broadcasted starting today on Palestinian TV and Arabic 
satellite channels, the American actor Richard Gere 
urges Palestinians on behalf of the \"entire world\" to 
participate in the elections. 
 
Leading media reported that Sharon associates warned 
United Torah Judaism (UTJ) on Tuesday that if UTJ does 
not join the coalition soon, Shinui could rejoin 
instead and a secular national unity government could 
be formed. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that no date has been set for 
FM Silvan Shalom\'s planned visit to Jordan.  The 
newspaper quoted Israeli officials as saying that one 
of the obstacles to the visit and to a warming up of 
ties with Amman is Jordan\'s demand that Israel release 
some two dozen Jordanian prisoners in Israeli jails, 
including four \"with blood on their hands.\" 
 
Yediot, Maariv and Jerusalem Post reported that 
diplomats at the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) have told AP that Egypt conducted a series of 
secret nuclear tests -- mostly in the 80s and 90s -- 
 
SIPDIS 
which continued until six months ago.  Yediot quoted a 
spokesman for the Egyptian government as saying that 
Egypt\'s nuclear program is for civilian purposes only. 
 
Israel Radio reported that the U.S. administration is 
considering imposing new economic measures against 
Syria over its reported assistance to the Iraqi 
opposition.  Jerusalem Post reported that visiting 
Turkish FM Abdullah Gul will take a message from Sharon 
to Syrian President Bashar Assad that Israel will 
negotiate with Syria once it takes concrete steps to 
stop supporting anti-Israel terror.  Yediot reported 
that Assad has recently rejected Israel\'s request to 
return the remains of Israeli spy Eli Cohen as a 
confidence-building measure. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio reported that today the State 
Department will publish its first report ever on anti- 
Semitism around the world, which will focus on the rise 
of anti-Semitism in Europe. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Israel has acceded to Sri 
Lanka\'s request for physical and mental health teams 
following the tsunami disaster.  Jerusalem Post 
reported that Israelis have \"come out in full force\" 
for a four-day nationwide campaigning at the nation\'s 
supermarkets to collect food to be sent to the tsunami 
disaster zone in South Asia.  The mobilization was 
organized by Magen David Adom (MDA) with backing by 
MDA\'s American support organization, American Magen 
David for Israel.  Jerusalem Post reported that the 
Indian military has been using Israeli-made drones 
around the clock to search for victims and survivors of 
the tidal waves that swept their coast last week. 
Jerusalem Post printed a Letter to the Editor by the 
editorial secretary of L\'Osservatore Romano saying that 
on December 29, Jerusalem Post distorted a story in the 
Vatican\'s newspaper, which had only noted Sri Lanka\'s 
initial refusal to receive an Israeli assistance 
delegation. 
 
Tel Aviv University\'s Peace Index poll: 
-75 percent of respondents favor the resumption of 
negotiations with the Palestinians; however, only 32 
percent of respondents believe that there are good 
chances of reaching an agreement with an Abbas-headed 
government. 
-\"Do you believe that other settlements will be 
evacuated after disengagement is implemented?\"  67 
percent: Disengagement is only the first step; 19 
percent: no more settlements will be evacuated; 14 
percent are undecided. 
-\"Do left-wing soldiers have the right to refuse 
service in the territories?\"  No: 68 percent; yes: 27 
percent; 5 percent are undecided. 
-\"Do right-wing soldiers have the right to refuse 
service in the territories?\"  No: 76 percent; yes: 18 
percent; 5 percent are undecided. 
-8 percent of Israeli Jews support the right to a 
violent civilian rebellion.

                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Israel\'s Tsunami, 2005\" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer and the late prime minister 
Yitzhak Rabin\'s assistant Eytan Haber opined in the 
lead editorial of mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (January 5): \"The riots on Monday against the 
security forces in Shalhevet, a neighborhood in the 
settlement of Yitzhar, are the first shock waves of the 
Israeli tsunami, which are being detected mainly by 
seismologists.  They will be followed by the deluge. 
One can understand the settlers: for 30 years they were 
deceived, taught that \'Judea will stand forever,\' 
luxurious houses were built for them, all their demands 
were met, they were called upon to be the pillar of 
fire before the camp -- and they, in their naivety, 
followed the voices.... The settlers whose world (and 
home) has been ruined, will do everything -- 
everything! -- to demolish Ariel Sharon\'s rule.  They 
learned from the sad experience of Yitzhak Rabin\'s 
death, to which they were not even partners, that in 
Israel everything depends on one person: the prime 
minister.  His removal from office also means the 
elimination of the nightmare of \'disengagement\'... The 
opponents believe that ... chaos will topple Sharon, 
and they will be saved.  Sharon and others also know 
that the first reactions by him and the security forces 
will be what will determine the nature of the battle in 
future.  Sharon knows that his opponents are lying in 
wait for a moment of weakness.  Therefore, it appears 
that he will make no concessions and compromises 
already from now.  The single gunshot fired on Monday 
in Yitzhar is a bad harbinger.  The coming period may 
bring violence with it, and also -- woe is to the eyes 
that read this -- bloodshed as well.  We may be facing 
a great disaster, and may we be proven wrong.  Israel, 
January 2005, the tsunami is on its way.\" 
 
II.  \"Kiev and Jerusalem\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Uzi Benziman opined in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz (January 5): \"The role that the 
settlers\' leaders are playing these days is dubious and 
dangerous.  They organize -- with funding deriving from 
the state treasury as well -- a sit-down strike 
opposite the Knesset under the slogan: We will do in 
Jerusalem what the Ukrainians did in Kiev.  That is to 
say, Viktor Yanukovich\'s election fraud is compared to 
the system Ariel Sharon is using to make the cabinet 
and Knesset decide in favor of the disengagement plan. 
This is a groundless comparison.  The situation is 
actually the other way around: the settlers are the 
minority that has been imposing its will on the 
majority for 37 years.... The struggle of the Yesha 
Council [of Jewish Settlements in the Territories] is 
hopeless.  It will not succeed in torpedoing the 
disengagement plan, and if it does, it will be seen as 
responsible for the collapse of law and order and the 
shattering of the state\'s authority.  The settlers must 
internalize the fact that they are perceived as a 
minority group that is enforcing its whims on the 
majority.  The Yesha council must realize that it 
cannot coerce the state to keep the Gaza Strip, and if 
it could, the price of the coercion would be too high.\" 
 
 
 
III.  \"A Dangerous Game\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(January 5): \"Our democracy is facing a supreme test. 
We can see as well as anyone the tortuous and, in some 
sense, troubling path by which the disengagement plan 
has reached its current stage, but it cannot be argued 
that decisions approved by the cabinet and the Knesset 
are illegal.... Sharon is right.  Some of 
disengagement\'s opponents are playing a very dangerous 
game.... The irony is that, as the prospect of violent 
resistance grows, the settler leaders and the radicals 
they won\'t stand up to are driving all of us, the 
people of Israel, into a corner.  They are forcing a 
choice between anarchy and democracy.  And they are 
drowning out legitimate questions about disengagement, 
such as [Shin Bet head Avi] Dichter\'s warning this week 
that Samaria [the northern West Bank] could become like 
Gaza in the wake of a withdrawal.  Even if democracy 
ultimately wins out, the result of such a terrible 
choice could be that we will all lose.\" 
 
IV.  \"Why We\'ve Chosen Civil Disobedience\" 
 
Settler leader Pinchas Wallerstein wrote in Jerusalem 
Post (January 5): \"Were anyone to suggest a transfer of 
Arabs from the tiniest of villages for the most 
important of security reasons, there would be an 
immense outcry, shaking the very heavens.  But those 
who consider themselves the guardians of human rights 
seem to exempt Jews in Judea, Samaria and Gaza [i.e. 
the territories] from their patronage.   I\'ve called 
the \'Evacuation and Compensation Law\' immoral.  Let me 
explain why.   This draconian law was pushed through 
the Knesset using Stalin-like methods.  It provides for 
refusing compensation to any Jews who protest being 
uprooted from their homes; it calls for three years\' 
imprisonment for anyone who remains in his or her home 
once the evacuation call has been made.  This law is 
immoral, first and foremost, because it attempts to 
legalize a crime which should never be repeated: the 
expulsion of Jews from their homes.... It is my opinion 
that thousands of soldiers will not find it within 
themselves to be partners in this endeavor.  The damage 
Sharon and his government will have inflicted on 
Israeli society by placing them in this untenable 
position will require decades to repair.  Nonviolent 
civil protest against immoral actions on the part of 
our government is the democratic right of all those 
privileged enough to live in a democratic country.\" 
 
V.  \"Still No Partner\" 
 
Conservative columnist Yosef Harif wrote in popular, 
pluralist Maariv (January 5): \"In a recent discussion 
of Middle East affairs at the National Security Council 
in Washington, it was said that political leaders must 
be strong enough to make compromise possible.  Can 
anyone view Abu Mazen as a strong man?  I am talking 
about a compromise acceptable to Sharon and the Likud, 
not just about to Peres and most of his friends, who 
are prepared for a withdrawal almost to the 1967 lines 
and to the division of Jerusalem.  In the meantime it 
is becoming clear that the Palestinians believe that 
time is on their side and that they therefore won\'t 
compromise.  Abbas is the prisoner of a delusion that 
the U.S., which is interested in expanding its 
influence in Iraq, Syria and other places in the Middle 
East, will press Israel to make significant concessions 
to the Palestinians.  Washington has promised Abu Mazen 
a visit to the White House after he is elected as the 
Palestinians\' leader.  This will be a proper 
opportunity to check his true intentions and to let 
them face reality.\"

TAGS: PGOV, IS, GOI INTERNAL 
SUBJECT: POSSIBLE UTJ DECISION AGAINST COALITION LEAVES 
SHARON WITH UNATTRACTIVE OPTIONS 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 6672 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) Religious reservations over disengagement, concerns 
over the independence of its religious school system, and 
issues of trust -- not only money or political benefits -- 
are the core issues preventing the United Torah Judaism (UTJ) 
party from completing PM Sharon\'s desired Likud-Labor-UTJ 
majority coalition.  A senior official close to the Prime 
Minister told the Ambassador January 4 that for the last few 
days, UTJ spiritual leader Rabbi Elyashiv -- who alone will 
decide whether UTJ will join the coalition -- has been 
grappling with the fundamental question of whether the 
disengagement plan would ultimately result in the saving of 
lives, a primary objective of Jewish law.  Elyashiv has 
reportedly been lobbied by settlers, Likud anti-disengagement 
MKs, and, according to sources, one senior Likud member, 
against joining the coalition.  The Ambassador\'s source said 
Elyashiv is also concerned that, by entering the coalition, 
he could be perceived by his constituents as selling UTJ\'s 
votes for disengagement, not because it promotes Jewish 
religious values, but for pure monetary benefits for his 
constituency.  The source added that Elyashiv is also 
concerned that, once disengagement has been completed, Sharon 
could renege on his promise that Haredi schools would be 
exempt from certain educational reforms.  A UTJ Knesset 
member told the Ambassador January 5 that some prominent 
rabbis are lobbying Elyashiv to join the coalition in order 
to \"save\" the disengagement plan.  This MK was not, however, 
sure this argument would override Elyashiv\'s other concerns. 
 
 
2.  (C) If Elyashiv decides against UTJ joining the coalition 
-- a decision he could reach January 6 -- Sharon could 
re-open negotiations with Shas, but prospects for drawing 
that party into the coalition are poor since it remains 
firmly opposed to the disengagement plan.  Sharon could ask 
former coalition partner Shinui to return to the fold, but 
would face strong opposition within his own party to an 
entirely secular Likud-Labor-Shinui coalition, a combination 
Likud rejected August 18.  Sharon would face similar 
opposition from his party if he tries to advance a simple 
Likud-Labor coalition.  Sharon could call for early 
elections, but that would postpone implementation of the 
disengagement plan by at least the minimum 111 days required 
by law to hold elections, something Sharon is loathe to do. 
In addition, few, if any political parties, want early 
elections.  Finally, Sharon could choose to hobble along with 
his minority one-party government, depending on outside 
support from informal coalitions for his budget and the 
disengagement plan. 
 
3.  (C) The senior official highlighted that Sharon had made 
a serious tactical error in using an attorney inexperienced 
with the Haredi community to negotiate with the UTJ.  The 
lawyer, he said, failed to recognize that, their reputations 
for sharp budget bargaining notwithstanding, the Haredim 
actually have religious and moral concerns that transcend 
finances.  The official, who has long experience with the 
Haredi community, said Sharon did not take up his offer that 
he assist in the coalition negotiations with the UTJ.  The 
UTJ MK added separately that broken trust between Elyashiv 
and Sharon is so deep that even a face-to-face meeting now 
would not help.

TAGS: ECON, ETRD, KIPR, IS, ECONOMY AND FINANCE, LABOR AND COMMERCE, GOI INTERNAL 
SUBJECT: GOI RESPONSE TO DATA EXCLUSIVITY DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 00842 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (B and D) 
 
1. (S)  Ambassador Kurtzer delivered points in reftel to Vice 
PM and Minister of Industry, Trade and Labor Ehud Olmert on 
January 4, 2005.  Olmert objected to the language used in the 
demarche, but he accepted the principle that if the data 
exclusivity legislation is withheld from passage by the 
Knesset, the out-of-cycle review would not be concluded so 
that it is possible to continue negotiations.  In order to 
move forward, he also requested that the USG provide written 
comments regarding the principal points of disagreement with 
the legislation as currently drafted. 
 
2. (S)  Olmert continued that he intends for the legislation 
to pass the first reading in the Knesset, but said that he 
would guarantee no further consideration of the data 
exclusivity legislation until the U.S. and Israel have either 
reached a mutually acceptable final agreement, or disengaged 
from negotiations.  The Minister offered to send a letter to 
the chairman of the Finance Committee of the Knesset stating 
that the legislation should not even be discussed in 
committee until the process with the U.S. has come to a 
conclusion.  Olmert\'s rationale for this option, in lieu of 
simply removing the legislation altogether, was that it will 
take several weeks to reintroduce the legislation if it is 
removed from the Economic Arrangements Law.  The Ambassador 
expressed concerns regarding this procedure, saying that it 
would be cleaner to withdraw the legislation now from 
consideration. 
 
3. (S)  Olmert and staff had no specific reaction to the 
USG\'s request for a withdrawal of the patent term extension 
legislation.  Although this legislation is not a part of the 
Economic Arrangements Law, consideration by the Knesset is 
imminent, with the first reading already scheduled for 
January 10. 
 
4. (SBU)  Olmert also requested that the USG provide a 
written critique of MOIT letter dated November 1, 2004 and 
the data exclusivity legislation as currently drafted, in 
addition to proposing new ideas that the USG has for moving 
the process forward. 
 
5. (S)  One downside to the proposal by the GOI to allow the 
data exclusivity legislation to pass a first reading of the 
Knesset is that once the legislation passes a first reading, 
it cannot be completely withdrawn from Knesset consideration. 
 If the GOI decides not to follow through with legislation, 
an MOITL staff member commented the legislation could be 
\"lost indefinitely in committee.\"  Allowing the legislation 
to pass a first Knesset reading also leaves the option open 
for the GOI to quickly move along with the law as currently 
drafted should negotiations with the U.S. fail.  An initial 
reading of the Budget and Economic Arrangements Law is 
expected as soon as coalition talks have been finalized. 
MOITL staff estimate that the third and final reading of the 
law would not occur until the end of February. 
 
6. (S)  Comment.  While Olmert has modified the terms of his 
proposal he is still predisposed to getting back to the 
bargaining table.  Olmert\'s reformulating of his own offer to 
\"withhold\" the bill shields him from criticism by domestic 
industry.  Motivation for moving ahead with the legislation 
as currently drafted may be based on the Ministry of Justice 
legal opinion that the legislation fulfills all TRIPS 
commitments and thus avoids potential WTO trade disputes. 
End Comment.

SUBJECT: JORDANIAN CONSUL SAYS JORDAN WANTS PRISONERS IN 
EXCHANGE FOR RETURNING AMBASSADOR TO TEL AVIV 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1.  (C) Jordanian Consul Mohammed Abu-Wandi told political 
counselor January 5 that ongoing discussions with FM Shalom 
over both Shalom\'s desire to visit Amman and the return of a 
Jordanian ambassador to Tel Aviv focus on Israel\'s release of 
some 13 Jordanian \"security\" prisoners.  Abu-Wandi said his 
mission has been discussing the issue at several levels with 
the Israeli government and with other unspecified \"friends\" 
in the hope of convincing the GOI that the prisoner issue is 
of paramount importance. 
 
2.  (C) Abu-Wandi said that King Abdallah truly recognizes 
that full diplomatic relations with Israel are in Jordan\'s 
best interest, but political realities require that he secure 
the release of the prisoners as part of the deal.  Asked 
whether a prisoner release would be enough of a gesture, by 
itself, to allow the king to return the ambassador, Abu-Wandi 
said yes.  Asked if any other issue equaled that of the 
prisoners, or could otherwise provide the cover for a return 
of the ambassador, Abu-Wandi said no.  While a few other 
bilateral issues remain unresolved, none carries the same 
importance vis-a-vis the ambassador issue.  Asked whether 
Jordan would extend an invitation for Shalom to visit absent 
a prisoner deal, Abu-Wandi said he did not know.  The 
scenario, he acknowledged, would be for Israel to indicate 
privately that it is willing to release the prisoners, for 
Jordan to then invite Shalom to visit, and for the release to 
then be made public, followed by Jordan\'s expeditious return 
of its ambassador. 
 
2.  (C) COMMENT: While Abu-Wandi was paying his first call on 
pol/c, it was clear that he came for the sole purpose of 
raising the prisoner issue, frequently noting that Jordan 
hopes its \"friends,\" including the United States, will make 
clear to the GOI the need for a prisoner release.

SUBJECT: NASSER YUSIF ON POSSIBLE SECURITY ROLE 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 4947 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer, per 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
ConGen Jerusalem cleared this message. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: National Security Force BG Nasser Yusif 
told poloffs recently that, if called upon to join an Abu 
Mazen government as interior minister, he would  bring the 
green-uniform public security forces, Force 17, and the naval 
or coastal police under his personal operational control, and 
then, subject to concurrence by the political leadership, 
focus his attention on the relatively \"easy\" job of cleaning 
up the West Bank.  Only after order is re-imposed there -- 
within 20 days -- would Yusif turn his attention to Gaza, 
setting up his headquarters there \"until the job is done.\" 
In a drop-by, the Ambassador cited the need for progress in 
the investigation of the October 15, 2003, attack on U.S. 
personnel in Gaza.  He stressed that although the United 
States stands ready to assist Abu Mazen, USG security 
concerns make it extremely difficult to operate effectively 
on the ground in PA territory.  Yusif agreed that law and 
order must be job number one for the PA, and concurred with 
the Ambassador\'s assessment that the Palestinian people 
themselves need security if their society is to grow.  He 
predicted that security during the January 9 presidential 
election will pose little problem because Abu Mazen maintains 
such a commanding lead in the race.  The real challenge, he 
stressed, will come during the March municipal elections, May 
PLC elections, and August Fatah elections, where no one 
faction has a commanding lead and where militants may choose 
to press their cases by violence.  Accordingly, PA security 
forces must gain control by March.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
We Need Progress in the Investigation 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Pol/C and Poloff met at length recently with National 
Security Force (NSF) Major General Nasser Yusif, ranking 
military officer in the Palestinian Authority security 
establishment, and NSF Brigadier General Samir Siksek, during 
a primarily social call beginning at the Embassy and then 
moving to Pol/C\'s home.  (Note:  Yusif is the number two 
ranking military officer within the PLO, ranking behind only 
Tunis-based MG Ahmed Afani, who, at least until Yasser 
Arafat\'s death, held the title of deputy chief of staff to 
Yasser Arafat.  Yusif\'s membership on the Fatah Central 
Committee makes him the de facto more senior officer.) 
During a brief drop-by, the Ambassador reiterated the need 
for progress in the investigation into the October 15, 2003 
attack on Embassy personnel and expressed his hope that PA 
security efforts will have a wider, positive impact on 
Palestinian society as a whole.  The Ambassador explained 
that, in the hope of an improved security situation, the 
Embassy is working to hold on to funds for major water 
projects that were put on hold following the deadly October 
15, 2003 attack, after which all travel to Gaza was halted. 
He urged the PA to make all possible efforts to resolve the 
investigation and to re-impose law and order so that current 
U.S. funding will not be lost and future funds can be 
effectively utilized. 
 
--------------------- 
Open to Possibilities 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Yusif said he had refused then-Chairman Arafat\'s 
request in 2003 to become minister of interior because there 
was, at that time, no authority attached to the position. 
Now, \"if asked, I will serve,\" he said, adding that \"our 
desire to work must be coupled by your (the United States\') 
desire to help.\"  With little or no law and order evident in 
the streets, Yusif said, security is the Palestinians\' number 
one concern today.  He added that during a recent visit to 
Gaza, he had been protected by \"a batallion\" of troops and he 
could not even go to pray in the mosque in Gaza City without 
armed guards.  During his several years as senior NSF 
commander in Gaza in the mid and late \'90s, the religiously 
observant Yusif attended daily prayers with little or no 
escort.  For the first time, he said, there are murders, 
rapes, and problems with narcotics in Gaza. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Israel Sets Palestinian Priorities 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The GOI, Yusif said, will be setting PA security 
priorities in the coming months by virtue of the demands 
Israel makes of the Palestinians.  Should he be appointed 
interior minister, Yusuf said, his own preference would be to 
focus his attention first on the West Bank as the \"easier\" 
task that would \"take 20 days\" to clean up.  Once that task 
was complete, Yusif said, he would then physically move to 
Gaza, staying there and personally overseeing the 
establishment of law and order.  If Israel, however, insists 
that Gaza security must -- by virtue of the withdrawal, 
continued rocket fire into Israel, or other reasons -- come 
first, then Yusif said he will be forced to leave the West 
Bank \"as is\" for the time being in order to focus his full 
attention on Gaza.  If Israel wants to test us, they will 
force the PA to take on Gaza first, he said.  But if they 
want orderly, complete results, the PA will be allowed to 
\"clean\" the West Bank first.  As a very first step, what 
Yusif referred to as the armed (presumably criminal) gangs 
operating in the territories must be \"crushed immediately.\" 
The PA will only then, he said, be in a position to begin 
taking on the militants step by step, as the militants make 
mistakes.  Yusif acknowledged that unless the PA establishes 
security to prevent attacks against evacuating Gaza settlers, 
disengagement could grind to a halt, and Palestinians could 
suffer heavy IDF responses to attacks. 
 
5.  (C) Yusif said he recognizes both the need for a 
comprehensive security operations plan \"from day one,\" and 
that both the GOI and the donors will be looking for results. 
 He acknowledged that while donors are ready and willing to 
assist, they want to support a strategic approach -- through 
a single approved, transparent, and coordinated channel -- 
rather than through piecemeal, often opaque efforts with 
individual security chiefs.  Yusif indicated that the message 
had been received and said that the \"apathy within Fatah\" had 
come to an end.  \"Arafat tactics won\'t work for us....  Abu 
Mazen is very serious.\"  He acknowledged, however, that he 
(Yusuf) currently has no authority to undertake such a 
planning and organizational effort, and that Abu Mazen cannot 
issue such a mandate prior to being elected PA President. 
 
--------------------------- 
Violence in Later Elections 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Yusif said he is confident that, if appointed as 
interior minister, he can plan and initiate operations 
expeditiously, and that, while he cannot promise concrete 
results, he is nonetheless sure that both he and Abu Mazen 
will make the maximum effort.  Yusif predicted that the 
January 9 presidential elections will pose little security 
problem because Abu Mazen commands such a wide lead that the 
election is not in doubt or up for grabs.  The real 
challenge, he stressed, will come during the March municipal 
elections, the May PLC elections, and the August Fatah 
elections, where no one faction has a commanding lead and 
where militants may choose to press their cases by violence. 
He predicted that, absent a major security effort, those 
elections will not be peaceful because they involve real 
political competition and too many armed factions are ready 
to fight.  Accordingly, PA security forces must gain control 
by March. 
 
7.  (C) Abu Mazen, he said, should make the political 
decision to act and then \"be off the hook,\" leaving the 
details of security implementation to his subordinates. 
Yusif acknowledged that the March time frame is 
extraordinarily short.  Asked whether it is realistic, he 
responded simply that the effort must be made.  He added that 
the GOI, having \"scrapped all mechanisms for coordination\" 
with the PA in the past four years, is relying now only on 
(unspecified) personal relationships to facilitate 
cooperation, complicating things for the Palestinians. 
\"Allow us to have a security establishment, not 
personalities,\" Yusif said, arguing for the re-establishment 
of the District Coordination Offices (DCOs) and other 
Palestinian-Israeli security cooperation mechanisms.  Yusif 
said he hoped that the GOI has learned to \"stay out of 
Palestinians affairs\" and \"stop trying to manipulate\" the 
militant groups. 
 
8.  (C)  Yusif added that he could not overstate the 
importance of the prisoner issue to the Palestinian people 
and to an Abu Mazen government.  He differentiated between 
those prisoners who have conducted \"military operations,\" who 
helped military operations, and who are \"normal suspects.\" 
The latter group, he said, comprise the clear majority of all 
prisoners, and resolving their fate would leave only a very 
small group in jail.  He estimated that the so-called normal 
suspects comprise some 11,500 of what he said are some 12,000 
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.  He also called for 
maintenance of labor flows from the territories into Israel 
as critical to Palestinian well-being. 
 
------------------ 
If I Were the Boss 
------------------ 
 
9.  (C) Yusif said that he has inherited the title of supreme 
commander of all the armed forces as most senior officer 
remaining in the PLO upon the death of Yasser Arafat, putting 
him in a unique position, if appointed interior minister, to 
command the respect of the various security services and 
begin addressing law and order. (Note: Yusif is also a Fatah 
Central Committee member and is religiously observant.) 
Fatah, he said, has decided that the interior minister 
position must be the ultimate security authority in the PA. 
The Ministry of Interior has two roles, Yusif said: one civil 
and one security/military.  Yusif acknowledged that a trusted 
administrator, several of whom, he said, come readily to mind 
from among Fatah Revolutionary Council members, could and 
should be appointed to run the actual administrative and 
civil elements of the Ministry, allowing Yusif to focus on 
running the security elements. 
 
10.  (C) As he told ConGen pol chief (reftel), Yusif said he 
would consolidate all security-related elements into three 
branches under the Interior Ministry: 
 
-- the blue-uniform police, the Preventive Security 
Organization (PSO), and civil defense. 
-- the general intelligence service. 
-- the green-uniform national security (or public security) 
forces, Force 17, and the naval or coastal police (sometimes 
called the marines).  Several other elements, such as 
military intelligence and special forces, that are 
technically part of the public security forces now but 
operate autonomously, and the Palestinian part of the Joint 
Security Committee (with Israel) would be integrated into the 
public security forces. 
 
11.  (C) Yusif said that in order to press ahead with what he 
anticipates will be the difficult task of bringing security 
to the territories, he would take personal operational 
control over the third branch, which he referred to 
collectively as the public security forces.  These forces 
currently fall under the commands (at least nominally) of MG 
Mousa Arafat in Gaza and MG Haj Ismail in the West Bank. 
Yusif suggested that, depending on performance, either or 
both commanders could be moved to senior staff jobs under 
him, removing them from operational command of forces.  Once 
he turns his attention to Gaza, he would move his 
headquarters there to maintain more effective operational 
control over what he said is a far more difficult task than 
subduing the West Bank. The other two security branches would 
be under Interior Ministry authority, but operate under the 
direct operational control of their designated chiefs, who 
would report to the interior minister.  The Mukhabarat, which 
is currently outside the Interior Ministry, and the PSO, 
which is technically already part of Interior, would be 
limited to gathering and developing intelligence only, rather 
than taking actions in the field as they currently do. 
 
12.  (C) Every commander, Yusif said, would be given a chance 
to demonstrate his competence -- \"even Mousa (Arafat).\"  If 
the commander does not perform as instructed or up to 
expectation, then that commander will be removed, Yusif said. 
 He cautioned, however, that to hold each and every person 
responsible for actions during the Intifada would be a recipe 
for failure as no one would be clean enough.  Arafat\'s legacy 
is that almost everyone is tainted by how they were forced to 
operate for the last 40 years.  Yusif was nonetheless 
confident that there are sufficient competent people with 
whom he could effectively staff a ministry. 
 
---------------------- 
And What About Dahlan? 
---------------------- 
 
13.  (C) Yusif was skeptical that Muhammad Dahlan would or 
should again have a position of authority in a future Abu 
Mazen administration.  Dahlan has no experience, Yusif said, 
and failed in his previous tenure as minister of state for 
security.  As an example of Dahlan\'s lack of stature, Yusif 
cited the November attack on Abu Mazen in the Arafat mourning 
tent in Gaza City, which took place while Dahlan was 
\"standing right there.\"  Many more-senior and more competent 
officers stand ahead of him, both in rank and within Fatah, 
Yusif continued.  Furthermore, \"you can\'t talk about 
corruption without talking about Dahlan.\"  Yusif opined that 
Dahlan might again rise to a senior position in the next 10 
to 15 years.  In the near term, however, the only way for 
Dahlan to move ahead would be for the Fatah Conference to 
elevate him or else for him to successfully run for a seat in 
the PLC. 
 
14.  (C) Noting that the GOI and others had pressured Abu 
Mazen into bringing Muhammad Dahlan into Abu Mazen\'s previous 
government to run security, Yusif said that Abu Mazen must be 
able to appoint someone whom he trusts and with whom he can 
work.  That relationship will be extremely important 
throughout the spring and summer months, as the security 
services must be able to ensure law and order during the 
municipal elections, PLC elections, and then the Fatah Party 
Conference.

Showing Results Towards Peace

15.  (C) Yusif warned that \"extreme measures\" might, at times 
have to be taken in the order to assert control and revive 
the unity of the legitimate armed forces, in Gaza in 
particular.  Yusif said that he would expect \"reasonable 
help\" from the GOI in his endeavor.  The Palestinian people, 
Yusif continued, are not capable of swallowing any more 
hardships, defined as either \"Israeli aggression\" or PA 
\"disorders and failures.\"  The situation has long been 
untenable, but now must certainly be resolved before the 
Fatah conference in August, Yusif said.  \"The Palestinians 
must take decisions then.  Should we proceed with the peace 
with Israel or not?\"  A portion of that question would be 
answered by Israeli actions in the coming months, he said. 
The best option would be for the Party Conference to be held 
simultaneously with a resumption of  the political track, so 
that the PA leadership could show the people some results. 
 
16.  (C) BIO NOTE:  Yusif, who appeared in good health and 
was once a hearty eater, declined to eat any meat during 
lunch, citing what he said was a diagnosis that he suffers 
from excess \"uric acid.\"  He now eats only vegetables and 
fish.  He described no other symptoms or conditions affecting 
his health or capabilities.

SUBJECT: YOSSI GAL AND ILAN BARUCH DISCUSS AHLC, WORLD BANK 
MONITORING, AND SETTLEMENT ASSETS WITH AMBASSADOR 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary: The Ambassador met with Yossi Gal and Ilan 
Baruch of the MFA\'s Economic Affairs division Wednesday, 
December 28 to discuss Israeli follow-up from the Oslo AHLC, 
World Bank-proposed monitoring and benchmarks, and GOI and 
Israeli private-sector contact with the Palestinians on 
settlement assets and agribusiness post-disengagement. 
 
--On the AHLC Gal was extremely positive, noting that the 
chair had recognized Israel\'s legitimate security needs, and 
that all parties had been complimentary on GOI steps like 
proposed facilitation of PA elections. 
 
--On benchmarks and monitoring, both Gal and Baruch took 
exception to the language of the World Bank proposals.  They 
argued that it is inappropriate for the donor community to 
tie PA-bound aid to Israeli actions.  The Ambassador 
responded that the donors must have a way to determine their 
money will be effective, and that both Israeli and PA actions 
are therefore relevant. 
 
--Gal said that the GOI supports pilot projects at Karni 
terminal and other border crossings in principal, but has yet 
to formulate a position on many details. 
 
--On the handover of settlement assets and the continuation 
of Israeli-Gazan agribusiness cooperation post-disengagement, 
Baruch said that while the GOI has a plan for transferring 
assets and know-how, there is \"nobody to talk to\" on the 
Palestinian side. 
 
--The Ambassador noted that it would be difficult for the GOI 
and the PA to talk directly with each other on disengagement 
issues immediately following PA elections.  A several-week 
period of political and symbolic \"catharsis\" would have to 
take place on both sides before dialogue could begin, he 
said.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Oslo AHLC: Appreciation for Israel\'s Efforts 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The Ambassador met with Yossi Gal, MFA deputy 
director general for Economic Affairs, and Ilan Baruch, chief 
of the Middle East economic affairs bureau, on Wednesday, 
December 28.  Gal discussed the Oslo AHLC meeting at length, 
praising it as \"unlike any AHLC I remember\" in terms of 
atmosphere.  All parties \"behaved,\" he noted.  In his view, 
the Palestinians made it clear they were impatient for more 
pledges and commitments from the donors right away, yet they 
contributed in spite of this to the overall positive 
atmosphere.  Salam Fayyad even told the delegations that 
Israel is currently doing more than any other donor for PA 
finances, Gal said, attesting that Fayyad announced that in 
November and December 2004 GOI-released revenue attachments 
were the PA\'s only source of outside income. 
 
3.  (C) There was \"wall to wall acceptance of the importance 
of disengagement\" at the meeting, continued Gal.  Moreover, 
all parties from the Norwegian chair to the World Bank 
acknowledged Israel\'s legitimate security needs, expressed 
appreciation for the GOI\'s proposed facilitation of the 
upcoming PA elections and support for monitoring delegations, 
and called on the Arab states to provide greater assistance 
to their Palestinian \"brothers.\"  While the Israeli 
delegation had misgivings over aspects of the four technical 
reports the bank presented, he added, they expressed their 
concerns only to the U.S. delegation, in an effort to keep 
wider discussions cordial and positive. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
\"Benchmarks and Monitoring\" Objectionable Terminology 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4.  (C) Both Gal and Baruch objected to the language of the 
World Bank\'s proposal for benchmarking and monitoring of GOI 
steps to facilitate economic growth in the territories.  Gal 
argued that the reports unfairly suggest donors should tie 
PA-bound assistance to Israeli actions.  There are \"dozens\" 
of specific GOI steps prescribed in the borders and trade 
facilitation report, Baruch said, as opposed to a small 
handful of vague \"suggested\" PA actions.  He proposed that it 
would make more sense to regard planned events, like Gaza 
pullout and the PA elections, as benchmarks in and of 
themselves.  Alternatively, the U.S. could apply more 
discrete \"pressure\" on the GOI to follow through with key 
steps, the way it did on the revenue transfer issue in 2003. 
On the bank\'s proposed pilot programs at select border 
crossings, Gal said the GOI supports them in principle but 
has yet to formulate an official position on specifics. 
 
5.  (C) The Ambassador explained that the bank\'s proposed 
benchmarks and monitoring are focused on \"sequencing\" of 
GOI-PA actions rather than conditionality, and are primarily 
a mechanism by which the donor community can ensure their 
money is not misspent.  As such, he said, they cannot simply 
be set aside.  It is crucial to donors that the PA not argue 
they are unable to make certain reforms or invest in private 
enterprise because of steps the GOI has or has not taken. 
\"Israel will get blamed if the donors believe the GOI is 
impeding\" Palestinian economic growth, he explained, adding 
that if access to Gaza for relief workers was still 
problematic in one month\'s time, it would be clear Israel was 
in fact the impediment on that issue. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Settlement Assets, Agribusiness: \"No-one to Talk To\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6.  (C) Gal and Baruch said they had tried to talk to the 
Palestinians at the AHLC about why the PA had so far \"refused 
to engage with the World Bank or Israel\" on the issue of 
handover of settlement assets, but that the PA delegation had 
not seemed to take it seriously.  \"Give us an inventory of 
the settlements,\" they reportedly told Gal.  Baruch assured 
the Ambassador that the GOI has a plan for the transfer of 
agribusiness infrastructure and know-how, including 
settlement greenhouses, but there is \"no-one to talk to\" on 
the Palestinian side. 
 
7.  (C) The Ambassador emphasized the importance of 
Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in expanding the Gazan 
agriculture sector.  While industries like construction can 
flourish independently of Israel, he said, agriculture 
depends on a stable export regime.  The two men responded 
that Israel would \"of course\" help facilitate exports of 
Gazan agricultural produce like flowers and strawberries, and 
noted that sector experts had predicted major increases in 
Gazan exports during 2005 \"regardless of disengagement.\" 
With robust Palestinian investment, said Baruch, the 
agriculture sector could double in size within three years, 
increasing the number of Gazans it employs from some 90,000 
to 180,000.  (Note: Baruch added that Nabil Sharif put the 
number of Gazans currently employed in agriculture at closer 
to 60,000.  End note.) 
 
8.  (C) Gazans will not be starting from scratch in terms of 
agribusiness, said Gal.  Gazan growers own thousands of 
dunams of greenhouses, and Gazan laborers have worked in the 
settlement greenhouses since their inception -- they already 
have know-how.  The Ambassador suggested that USAID 
facilitate a multilateral agriculture conference in order to 
link Gazans with Israeli, Egyptian, and Jordanian 
counterparts.  Gal and Baruch agreed this would be 
beneficial. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
GOI-PA Dialogue on Disengagement Post-Elections 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
9.  (C) Gal and Baruch explained that the disengagement plan 
had been \"born under a different reality\", and now the GOI 
had to decide whether to engage directly with new Palestinian 
leadership or work through the U.S. as a third party in order 
to move forward.  The Ambassador said that Israel should not 
expect PA elections to effect an immediate \"magic change\" in 
terms of enabling GOI-PA dialogue.  A several-week period of 
\"catharsis,\" in which both the GOI and the PA engaged in 
political and symbolic demonstrations of strength, would be 
in order before real bilateral work could begin on 
disengagement\'s economic aspects.  \"The relationship can go 
off track\" very easily during this time, said the Ambassador 
-- the U.S. would have to manage it carefully.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Maariv and Yediot highlighted issues related to the 
opposition to the disengagement plan.  Maariv bannered 
a call by PM Sharon on IDF soldiers to resist 
protesters and not to let them \"slap you in the face.\" 
Sharon was visiting a paratrooper battalion that had 
participated in the evacuation of two caravans in a 
settler outpost near Yitzhar on Monday.  (All media 
reported that an IDF conscript from Yitzhar who 
disrupted the evacuation was tried on disciplinary 
charges Wednesday and sentenced to 28 days in a 
military stockade.)  Yediot reported that four 
battalion commanders and 30 commanders in an IDF 
reserves unit have signed a letter calling for massive 
refusal to enlist in the evacuation of settlements. 
Israel Radio and leading Israeli web sites reported 
that Thursday IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Moshe Ya\'alon 
summoned the members of group, saying he will summarily 
kick them out of the military if they do not rescind 
their threats.  Ha\'aretz, Jerusalem Post and Israel 
Radio reported that Wednesday A-G Menachem Mazuz 
ordered police to launch an investigation against the 
head of the West Bank\'s Kedumim Regional Council, 
Daniella Weiss, as well as the founder of the far-right 
Defensive Shield organization, Noam Livnat (the brother 
of Education Minister Limor Livnat, who told Israel 
Radio that although she opposes the evacuation of 
settlements, she does not support disobedience by 
soldiers), who are suspected of inciting soldiers to 
evade their duty and disobey orders.  Israel Radio says 
that they are not likely to be indicted. 
 
All media (banners in Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post) 
reported that United Torah Judaism (UTJ) has decided 
that it will join the coalition for a three-month trial 
period, after Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, the 
spiritual leader of Degel Hatorah, a key faction of the 
party, gave his consent to the deal on Wednesday. 
According to Israel Radio, the new government is likely 
to be sworn in on Monday. 
 
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), the leading contender for PA 
chairmanship, was quoted as saying in an interview with 
Maariv, whose tone was conciliatory, that he will \"make 
order\" in the PA after being elected.  Abbas was quoted 
as saying that he is not afraid of Hamas, only of 
Allah, that now is an excellent time for peace, and 
that he will move the road map forward.  A senior PA 
official in Ramallah was quoted in an interview with 
Jerusalem Post as saying that the PA could launch a 
\"Fallujah-style\" operation against Hamas and its 
supporters if the movement continues its verbal 
offensive against Abbas.  Leading media reported that 
Wednesday the Fatah Central Committee officially called 
on Hamas to stop firing rockets and cease the 
incitement against Abbas, saying that the rocket 
attacks provide an excuse for continued IDF activity in 
the Gaza Strip. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited an announcement by the State Department 
Wednesday that Senators John Sununu (R-NH) and Joe 
Biden (D-DE) will head the official U.S. observer team 
monitoring the Palestinian elections.  The delegation 
will also include a number of U.S. representatives and 
American public figures of Palestinian origin, such as 
George Salem and Ziad Assali, and will be accompanied 
by U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem David Pearce. 
Michel Rocard, head of the EU\'s 260-person election 
monitoring team, was quoted as saying in an interview 
with Jerusalem Post that one properly run election may 
not make a democracy, but that is a good place to 
begin. 
 
Israel Radio reported that this morning IDF troops 
killed a terrorist who infiltrated the greenhouses of 
the Ganei Tal settlement in the Gaza Strip\'s Katif 
Bloc. 
 
All media reported that Wednesday the State Department 
released a new report to Congress -- the \"Report on 
Global Anti-Semitism\" mandated by President Bush in 
October.  Jerusalem Post notes that the report says 
that a combination of traditional anti-Jewish 
prejudice, strong anti-Israel sentiment, and Europe\'s 
growing Muslim population has contributed to a recent 
rise in global anti-Semitism.  Leading media write that 
the report adopts the position that demonization of 
Israel or comparison of Israeli leaders to Nazis is not 
legitimate criticism but rather anti-Semitism. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted GOI sources as saying that a \"highly 
classified problem\" was the reason for a special 
meeting Sharon convened earlier this week on the crisis 
in Israel\'s relations with Russia, with the 
participation of FM Silvan Shalom, Defense Minister 
Shaul Mofaz, the heads of the intelligence agencies, 
and a few civil servants.  The newspaper quoted the 
sources as saying that the information given to the 
media after the meeting -- that Israel is worried by 
recent statements of an anti-Semitic nature made by 
President Vladimir Putin-- was partial and tendentious, 
and that it was aimed at concealing the real reason for 
the crisis, which Sharon insisted be kept secret. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Education Ministry D-G Ronit 
Tirosh has announced that the position held by a Shin 
Bet representative charged with carrying out background 
checks on teachers and principals in the Israeli Arab 
education system is being done way with. 
 
Akiva Eldar of Ha\'aretz describes Israeli-Palestinian 
talks that took place at various Israeli locations from 
February 2004 until the end of the year, at which point 
they ended with a concluding document that was released 
after Arafat\'s death.  IPCRI (the Israeli/Palestine 
Center for Research and Information) participated in 
the talks. 
 
Leading media reported that National Union MK Aryeh 
Eldad has demanded that the A-G bar Abbas from entering 
Jerusalem because the Palestinian leader published a 
book in 1984 denying the Holocaust.  Eldad said that a 
recent amendment to the penal code allowed putting 
Holocaust deniers on trial. 
 
Yediot reported that the Knesset has passed, 43-16, a 
decision memorializing the heritage of Rehavam Zeevi 
(a.k.a. Gandhi), the minister assassinated by PFLP 
gunmen in October 2001, who had advocated the idea of 
transfers of Arabs from Israel.  The newspaper cited 
the response of former Labor Party leader, MK Amram 
Mitzna, that the vote represented a cheapening of the 
concept of commemoration. 
 
Ha\'aretz noted that Israel is ranked 33rd in that Wall 
Street Journal-Heritage Foundation Worldwide Index of 
Economic Freedom, which evaluated 155 countries. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that 82 UN member states have so far 
responded to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan\'s appeal 
to hold a special session in the General Assembly to 
mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of 
Auschwitz. 
 
Citing statements by police that there is a huge 
improvement in the enforcement of IPR-related laws in 
Israel, Yediot ran a feature on the distribution of 
counterfeit products in Israel.  The newspaper notes 
that punishing measures are ineffective. 
 
Erratum: Ha\'aretz printed corrected graphics of poll 
results from Tel Aviv University\'s December Peace 
Index, which appeared in the newspaper on Wednesday. 
The figures should read: 
-\"Do right-wing soldiers have the right to refuse 
service in the territories?\"  No: 68 percent; yes: 27 
percent; 5 percent are undecided. 
-\"Do left-wing soldiers have the right to refuse 
service in the territories?\"  No: 76 percent; yes: 18 
percent; 5 percent are undecided.

I.  \"Ultra-Orthodox Part From Greater Israel\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the editorial of mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (January 6): \"The basic 
premise of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\'s latest 
political move, i.e. that the ultra-Orthodox circles 
will lend a hand to his disengagement initiative -- if 
they only receive in return Shinui\'s removal from the 
government -- has proven itself.  Rabbi Yosef Shalom 
Elyashiv permitted the United Torah Judaism (UTJ) 
faction last night to join Sharon\'s new disengagement 
coalition.... From a foreign policy standpoint, the 
position taken by the leaders of ultra-Orthodox Jewry 
is clear: in favor of the withdrawal from Gaza and 
evacuation of all its settlements.... In the last 
generation ... nationalistic opinions have [actually] 
heightened among the young ultra-Orthodox 
generation.... After the PA elections and the beginning 
of negotiations between Sharon and Abu Mazen, [Shas 
party mentor] Rabbi Ovadia [Yosef] will also find 
reasons to cancel the ruling against the withdrawal, 
since this will no longer be a \'unilateral\' move but 
rather a \'consensual\' one.  In the space of less than a 
year, then, Sharon has succeeded in causing an 
earthquake in the Israeli right wing.... The government 
that stands to be presented to the Knesset next week is 
far from perfect.... Sharon does not have all the time 
in the world.  In the coming months, which will be 
critical for his plan, his vision and the country\'s 
future, he must focus on one sole issue: 
disengagement.... Sharon is now a prime minister 
leading a government made up of parties with no love 
lost between them, and the only adhesive binding them 
together is the faith they have in his withdrawal 
vision.  Any move that may jeopardize this coalition 
can and must be deferred.\" 
 
II.  \"There\'s No Void Around Abu Mazen\" 
 
Liberal columnist Yehuda Litani wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (January 6): 
\"All sides -- Israelis, Palestinians, Americans, and 
others -- expect significant changes to happen in the 
Palestinian Authority in the wake of the elections. 
Even for a charismatic leader such as Arafat, who, as 
PA chairman, earned support -- albeit reserved -- from 
all factions of the Palestinian people, this had been 
an arduous task.  Abu Mazen does not enjoy such 
support.... He is likely to fail.  How can he put an 
end to the violence when various factions of the Fatah 
organization he heads are disobedient and refuse to 
dismantle their weapons?.... Regarding the presence of 
the IDF in Palestinian population centers, and the 
continuation of the settlements, Abu Mazen will be 
totally dependent on Israel -- at this stage, there\'s 
no sign of willingness for a change.  As regards 
corruption, Mahmoud Abbas is part and parcel of the PLO- 
Tunisia establishment that is now working to have him 
elected.... It looks as though the optimism currently 
surrounding the election campaign will dissipate 
quickly: Palestinian violence will go on, the IDF will 
continue to rule the Palestinians heavy-handedly, and 
the situation of corruption won\'t improve.  An accusing 
finger will be pointed at Abu Mazen, who believes he 
can rescue his nation from the impasse in which it find 
itself.  He is not aware that that he will actually be 
elected as a sacrificial lamb.\"

\"It Is Time for the Americans to Understand\" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (January 6): 
\"The Americans are slowly losing their illusions 
regarding Syrian President Bashar Assad.  After four 
years, he appears in their eyes not as a great hope but 
as a bitter disappointment and even a threat....  Just 
as Hafez Assad undermined Lebanon\'s internal stability 
from the outside and encouraged terror and violence to 
the point of civil war there, the Syrians are now 
trying to do the same in their eastern neighbor, 
formerly their fierce contender for regional 
hegemony....  In light of Iraq\'s historical standing in 
the Middle East, elections in this country are expected 
to have a dramatic effect on the future of democracy 
and the regimes in the entire Middle East.  For the 
sake of this critically important experiment, for the 
sake of unfortunate Iraq, and what is no less important 
for the Americans, for the sake of their downtrodden 
soldiers, it is time for the Americans to understand 
that in the Syrian case, severe reprimands will not be 
enough.   Even sanctions will not do.\"

erroneous approach that has thus far guided Jerusalem 
is that Turkey needs Israel, due to the latter\'s ties 
with Washington, more than Israel needs Turkey.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
\"A Test of Friendly Relations\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(January 6): \"The chill that has characterized Turkey\'s 
official relations with Israel thawed this week when, 
for the first time in two years, Turkish Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Gul agreed to visit here. It is hoped 
that in the wake of this visit, Turkish Prime Minister 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan\'s promise to visit Israel will 
also be fulfilled.... Turkey is the only Muslim state 
whose relationship with Israel has popular, economic 
and security dimensions.... The bilateral relationship 
is therefore a mutual strategic asset that requires 
continuous mutual nurturing, and Turkey can cushion the 
path of diplomatic talks if Israel allows it to do so. 
Israel, however, has taken this relationship for 
granted.  The erroneous approach that has thus far 
guided Jerusalem is that Turkey needs Israel, due to 
the latter\'s ties with Washington, more than Israel 
needs Turkey.  This distorted approach has led Israel 
to spurn Turkey\'s efforts to sell it water or to 
increase the number of Turkish workers in the country. 
Israel has also refrained from proposing Turkish 
participation in major projects here, yet at the same 
time it seeks to participate in major projects in 
Turkey.  This approach needs a shake-up, just as the 
Turkish prime minister\'s views on Israeli policy need 
correction.\"

1.  (C) Summary: The three-month trial period for which the 
United Torah Judaism (UTJ) party has agreed to enter a 
coalition with Likud and Labor gives Prime Minister Sharon 
the time -- and majorities in the relevant bodies -- to : 
 
-- establish a 66-MK majority government, probably as early 
as January 10; 
-- pass the budget in three quick Knesset readings; 
-- pass the remaining two Knesset readings for disengagement 
implementing legislation; 
-- and push through the Cabinet the votes on each of the 
evacuation plan\'s four phases. 
 
End summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Sharon on the Fast Track 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The January 5 decision by UTJ spiritual leader Rabbi 
Shalom Elyashiv to join a coalition with Likud and Labor, 
albeit for a three-month trial period without ministerial 
portfolios, allows Prime Minister Sharon to seek Knesset 
approval of a new government as early as January 10.  Likud, 
Labor and the UTJ will likely sign their respective coalition 
agreements January 6, with Cabinet approval, required for 
expanding the coalition, on January 9.  Sharon\'s 13-member 
all-Likud Cabinet is expected to approve the expanded 
government with a clear majority in favor since UTJ\'s 
inclusion meets the demands of Likud MKs for a religious 
party in the government.  He can then submit the signed 
agreements to the Knesset January 9 to meet the 
legally-mandated 24-hour consideration period that would 
allow the Knesset to vote on the new government January 10. 
 
3.  (C) In the Knesset, where no one wants to see early 
elections and where the majority supports disengagement, 
Sharon can count on at least 27 of the 40 Likud MKs to 
support the new government, in addition to Labor\'s 19, Am 
Ehad\'s two, UTJ\'s five, and two maverick MKs, for a total of 
55 out of the Knesset\'s 120 MKs.  United Arab List MK Taleb 
el-Sana told poloff January 6 that his two-member party would 
lend its votes to ensure a majority for Sharon\'s new 
government.  He said that an MK from the Israeli-Arab Hadash 
party said his party may also provide a safety net.  Or 
Pearl, assistant to Likud disengagement foe MK Ehud Yatom, 
told poloff January 6 that he is certain that several of the 
13 Likud MKs who oppose disengagement will either abstain in 
the vote or absent themselves to ensure that Sharon wins the 
simple majority for a new government.  Many of the rebels are 
first-term MKs who could lose their seats in new elections. 
Sharon can also count on left-wing Yahad\'s six MKs to 
abstain, something that party has already said it would do to 
prevent Sharon\'s government from falling and thereby ensure 
implementation of the disengagement plan. 
 
4.  (C) Sharon has also indicated he is ready to re-introduce 
his stalled budget January 10, after the Knesset votes on the 
new government, and then move the budget through three speedy 
readings.  Sharon also plans to advance the first Cabinet 
vote on evacuation to January from March. 
 
------------------------------------ 
UTJ: Actions Speak Louder than Words 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Elyashiv\'s decision to sign on to the coalition for 
only a three-month trial period illustrates the distrust felt 
by the 94-year-old Rabbi over whether Sharon -- who was 
willing to sit in a coalition with the arch-secular Shinui 
party -- will make good on commitments contained in the 
coalition agreement.  These commitments include easily 
reversible assurances that Haredi schools will not be 
subjected to upcoming educational reforms recommended by the 
Dovrat Committee (reftel).  Elyashiv decided that during the 
three months UTJ would not accept any government positions. 
Two UTJ MKs -- Yaakov Litzman and Meir Porush -- who belong 
to one of the two factions that comprise  UTJ, however, have 
indicated they are not subject to Elyashiv\'s directive since 
he is not the rabbi for their faction.  They reportedly 
intend to take the positions offered the UTJ as part of the 
coalition agreement: Litzman to chair the Knesset Finance 
Committee and Porush aims to serve as deputy transportation 
minister. 
 
6.  (C) Without any Cabinet seats, UTJ will not participate 
in any upcoming Cabinet votes on disengagement 
implementation, but by joining a coalition that the media has 
referred to as \"the disengagement government,\" media pundits 
are assessing that UTJ has lent its stamp of approval to 
Sharon\'s unilateral withdrawal plan.  Yedioth Ahronoth 
journalist Sever Plotzker wrote January 6 that: \"From a 
political standpoint, the permission of the elderly rabbi is 
contingent on receiving further financial and social 
benefits,...but from a foreign policy standpoint, the 
position taken by the leaders of ultra-Orthodox Jewry is 
clear: In favor of the withdrawal from Gaza and evacuation of 
all its settlements.\"

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The three major newspapers lead with Defense Minister 
Shaul Mofaz and IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Ya\'alon\'s 
threats against the 34 reserve officers who signed a 
petition against the evacuation of settlements.  Israel 
Radio reported that Ya\'alon demanded that the officers 
rescind their stand this morning, or else they would be 
ousted from the army.  The station reported that, in 
consultation with their commander, they have drafted a 
new letter condemning the refusal to serve.  The 
station cited a call by the Committee of Rabbis in 
Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip for further soldiers 
and officers to refuse to serve.  The radio reported 
that two West Bank settlers -- one from Yitzhar, the 
other one from Kfar Tapuah -- who bullied Rabbi Yehuda 
Wiesner, the IDF Central Command\'s Chaplain, 
threatening to kill him, have been arrested.  Yediot 
(Shimon Shiffer) quoted PM Sharon as saying that the 
settler leaders are threatening the existence of the 
state, but that they will not win.  Leading media 
quoted Justice Minister Tzipi Livni as saying Thursday, 
in a direct attack against extremists on the right, 
that legal authorities will take a forceful stance 
against those who challenge the sovereignty of the 
state and its legitimate organs.  Maariv notes that 
hundreds of secular soldiers have signed the refusal 
petition, and that conversely, dozens of reservist 
officers residing in kibbutzim set up an emergency HQ 
on Thursday, in coordination with the Prime Minister\'s 
Office, that will enlist thousands of soldiers and 
officers who would agree to join missions of settlement 
evacuations, should the right-wing refusenik phenomenon 
reach proportions threatening to disrupt the 
evacuation. 
 
Israel Radio quoted Mofaz as saying that Israel would 
agree to pull out from areas in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip even before the disengagement, should the 
Palestinians make thorough efforts to break the cycle 
of terror and disarm the terrorist organizations. 
 
Regarding Sharon\'s promises to the USG on the cessation 
of building in the settlements and the evacuation of 
the unauthorized settler outposts, Ha\'aretz (Aluf Benn) 
reported that National Security Advisor Condoleezza 
Rice recently told an \"Israeli personage\": \"We know 
that things are under control.\" 
 
Leading media reported that Thursday the Likud, the 
Labor Party, and United Torah Judaism signed a 
coalition agreement, which will be presented to the 
Knesset on Sunday.  Jerusalem Post reported that a 
first dispute immediately loomed between Likud and 
Labor over how many ministers and deputy ministers the 
Likud will have. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Israel Radio reported that former U.S. 
president Jimmy Carter arrived in the country last 
night as the head of the international team monitoring 
the PA election.  The radio stated Carter\'s hope at the 
conclusion of a meeting with FM Silvan Shalom that this 
will be an \"honest and fair, open, transparent election 
process.\"  Carter added: \"I hope ... that [the] 
demonstration of an ability to carry out their [the 
Palestinians\'] civil responsibilities during this 
election will be a demonstration also that there can be 
trust for negotiations in the future between Israel and 
the Palestinians.\"  Shalom reassured Carter about the 
conditions of the election.  Michel Rocard, head of the 
EU\'s election monitoring team, was quoted as saying in 
an interview with Maariv that the success of the 
elections is an Israeli interest, and that his team is 
satisfied about Israel\'s cooperation.  Jerusalem Post 
stresses the Israel-PA collaboration in facilitating 
the election process.  Leading media reported that 
Thursday the High Court of Justice ruled that some 
8,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails will 
not be allowed to vote.  Jerusalem Post reported that 
fearing a low turnout of Arab Jerusalemites in Sunday\'s 
election for PA chairman, PA and Fatah officials on 
Thursday stepped up their efforts to persuade residents 
to vote.  Israel Radio reported that right-wing 
activists, including a National Religious Party member 
of the Jerusalem City Council, intend to disrupt the 
vote of East Jerusalem Arabs in the election.  They 
cite a threat to the unity of Jerusalem.  Ha\'aretz 
(English Ed.) reported that hundreds of OneVoice 
Palestine volunteers, together with New York Jewish 
businessman Daniel Lubetsky, canvassed towns and 
refugee camps across the West Bank this week as part of 
a nonpartisan campaign meant to encourage high voter 
turnout ahead of the election. 
 
Fayssal Hourani, a Palestinian author and peace 
activist, was quoted as saying Thursday in an interview 
with Ha\'aretz that whoever is elected to head the PA on 
Sunday will bear heavy responsibilities but will have 
no real power to carry them out.  Hourani believes that 
supporters of the frontrunner Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) 
have very limited expectations of him. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the Defense Ministry will soon 
appoint a civilian overseer for the evacuation of 
illegal settler outposts in the West Bank, in 
preparation for dismantling approximately 20 such 
outposts. 
Jerusalem Post reported that unauthorized Egyptian 
passenger aircraft have been increasingly violating 
Israel\'s airspace near Eilat, prompting the IAF to 
station Hawk anti-aircraft missile batteries and 
fighter planes close by, ready to shoot down the 
Egyptian planes if they take a hostile turn.  In 
several cases, fighter jets have actually been 
scrambled, then returned quietly to their base. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that changes in the route of the West 
Bank security fence dictated by the High Court of 
Justice\'s ruling will cost 80-100 million shekels 
(about USD 18-23 million). 
 
Last night, Channel 2-TV reported that former Israel 
Air Force commander Herzl Bodinger is mediating in the 
ongoing dispute between the U.S. Defense Department and 
the Israeli Defense Ministry. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that several residents of the Gaza 
Strip settlement of Nissanit have decided to leave 
their home immediately, without waiting for an advance 
on their compensation, due to the recent upsurge in 
mortar shell and Qassam rocket attacks.  Israel Radio 
reported on a spate of mortar shell attacks on Israeli 
targets this morning. 
 
Jerusalem Post notes that the State Department\'s first 
annual Report on Global Anti-Semitism largely skips the 
Middle East and North America. 
 
Jerusalem Post notes that after years of automatically 
censuring Israel, Canada may be shifting toward a more 
balanced stance. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited the Egyptian weekly Al-Osboa as 
saying that the December 26 earthquake that shook the 
Indian Ocean \"was possibly\" caused by an Indian nuclear 
experiment in which \"Israeli and American experts 
participated.\" 
 
Maariv quoted Yishai Maimon, the Mayor of the Galilee 
city of Safed, Abbas\'s birthplace, as saying that he 
will not allow him to visit the city.  Maimon recalled 
Abbas\'s role in the 1974 massacre of Maalot. 
 
Jerusalem Post cited an announcement by Tel Aviv 
University Thursday that Zvi Stauber, the former 
ambassador to London and retired general, has been 
named the next head of the Jaffee Center of Strategic 
Studies (JCSS). 
 
Yediot reported that Technion scientists have developed 
a pen-like device that can identify makeshift 
explosives used by terrorist groups. 
Ha\'aretz (English Ed.) reported that North American 
Jewish organizations have launched a new campaign aimed 
at convincing universities in the U.S. to change their 
policy on study in Israel.  Those organizations claim 
that schools have been imposing unjust limitations on 
students who express an interest because of exaggerated 
fears for the students\' personal safety. 
 
A Yediot/Mina Zemach (Dahaf Institute) poll conducted 
among Israeli Jews: 
-\"Do you believe the evacuation of settlements will 
lead to exchanges of fire between settlers and 
soldiers?\"  75 percent: yes; 23 percent: no. 
-\"Will the settlers\' protest influence the 
disengagement?\"  No: 45 percent; it will delay the 
disengagement: 42 percent; it will cancel the 
disengagement: 6 percent; it will accelerate the 
disengagement: 4 percent. 
-\"What is your most important thought regarding 
settlers actively opposing the evacuation of 
settlements?\" They are dangerous people: 49 percent; 
they have good intentions, but have gone astray: 23 
percent; they are idealists: 21 percent; they are a 
minority among settlers: 7 percent. 
-\"What is your principal feeling vis-a-vis the 
settlers, as you watch their clashes with IDF 
soldiers?\"  They harm democracy: 28 percent; their 
behavior is repulsive: 19 percent; I am concerned they 
will lead to a civil war: 18 percent; I identify with 
their struggle: 16 percent; I understand their 
situation: 9 percent; I want to join their ranks: 6 
percent.

Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
I.  \"Yes, Throw Them Out\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (January 7): 
\"Thirty four settlers, all officers and NCOs in the 
reserves, signed the disobedience letter whose contents 
were published Thursday in Yediot Aharonot.... As 
civilians, they have the right, even the duty, to make 
their cry heard.  As for their status as soldiers, 
there is no choice but to state that the Chief of Staff 
is right: those who do not retract their signature on 
the letter as of this morning, all have the same 
punishment -- being kicked out of the army.  With all 
due respect to the dissenters\' various arguments, right 
wing and left wing, at stake here is something a lot 
weightier than any political argument.  There is no 
such thing as an army by request.  In Sweden perhaps, 
if you push it, but not in the cruel surroundings in 
which Israel is located.  Either you accept the 
national authority, or we close up shop.... Only in 
banana republics can soldiers threaten an elected 
government.  You can support disengagement or oppose 
it, but there is no way to define it semantically as a 
patently illegal order. Those who decide that a soldier 
cannot carry out such an order are dissenters, even if 
they wear a yarmulke and are good little boys.\" 
 
 
 
 
II.  \"We\'re Fed Up With You\" 
 
Deputy Editor-In Chief Avi Bettelheim wrote in an 
editorial of popular, pluralist Maariv (January 7): 
\"Given the frightening rapid increase in verbal and 
physical violence by settlers opposing the 
disengagement, the time has come to clearly state the 
truth: this no longer is an ideological struggle -- 
this is a crude violation of the law, violent 
wrongdoing.  This is it; enough; we\'re fed up with 
it.... No matter which cause it serves, fanaticism only 
causes destruction.... It is unconceivable that 
fanaticism for an idea has so blinded the core -- and 
perhaps not just the core -- of the settlers, that they 
are convinced it is permitted and good to pay any 
price, even a civil war, to thwart the disengagement 
decision.... The settlers must pause, and -- in the 
name of the God they are so determined to annex to 
themselves -- seize control of themselves, and 
reconsider.\" 
 
III.  \"Time to Take Off His Gloves\" 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (January 7): 
\"Worried messages used to arrive from Washington that 
Sharon didn\'t sound serious enough about implementing 
the disengagement plan.  No matter how many times 
President Bush nagged him to dismantle illegal 
outposts, nothing happened.  The more he went on 
promising and doing nothing, the more doubtful the 
Americans were that he could evacuate the settlements 
of Gaza in one fell swoop.  The official explanation 
from Jerusalem cited tactical considerations: why waste 
energy clashing with settlers who are illegal and whose 
fate is sealed in any case?  Better to save our 
strength for the big battle.  This argument was 
interpreted by the settlers as a sign of political 
weakness.... The hesitant approach of the government, 
along with the voices of opposition in the Likud and 
the arrogance of the rebels, enabled the settlers to 
portray the disengagement initiative as illegitimate. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.... The 
establishment of a new [government] coalition doesn\'t 
mean the danger is over.  Inciting soldiers to disobey 
on the grounds that the evacuation order is illegal is 
nothing short of a call to rebellion.  Never since the 
period leading up to the 1967 war has the country been 
in such a state of emergency.... These are fateful 
times in which we cannot allow rebel forces to clash 
with or claim victory over a lawful, elected 
government.  Sharon was right to hit the ceiling this 
week.  Now is the time for him to take off his gloves.\" 
 
IV.  \"A Vote For the Future\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(January 7): \"While campaigning during the past two 
weeks, Abbas made several comments that have raised 
concerns in Israeli quarters.  Some of his rhetoric was 
inflammatory -- such as calling Israel the \'Zionist 
enemy\' -- and he staked out positions on such issues as 
the status of Jerusalem and the refugee \'right of 
return\' that sounded no more moderate than those of his 
predecessor.  It\'s unfortunate that Abbas chose the low 
road on the campaign trail, and so far has not prepared 
his people for the painful compromises that they, too, 
will have to make on the road to a peaceful resolution 
of the conflict.  The international hope, clearly, is 
that Abbas will, like other democratic leaders we know, 
run on one platform and govern from another.  It is the 
job of the international monitoring team to ensure that 
Sunday\'s election is conducted in a fair, free and 
honest manner.  After that, it is the job of the 
Palestinian people -- and their newly elected leader -- 
to build a society that will be equally so.\" 
 
V.  \"Risking Peace\" 
 
Editorial Page Editor Saul Singer wrote in Jerusalem 
Post (January 7): \"Everyone knows that to promote Arab- 
Israeli peace in our new post-Arafat era, the world 
must help one embattled leader.  Problem is, they\'ve 
got the wrong one.  Ariel Sharon needs the world\'s 
help; Abu Mazen needs its discipline.... The U.S. and 
Europe support disengagement.... [But] saying nice 
things about Sharon is not enough.  Israelis should be 
shown that disengagement will shift the diplomatic 
landscape fundamentally in their favor.  The 
international community can do this simply.  First, it 
could state that the Palestinian claim of a \'right of 
return\' to Israel conflicts with Israel\'s right to 
exist, with the road map, and with the two-state 
solution, and is therefore unacceptable.  Second, it 
could withhold funding from the Palestinian Authority, 
on which it is wholly dependent, until it has ended all 
violence against Israel. As a bonus, the U.S. could 
demand that Egypt shut down Palestinian smuggling 
operations from its territory, or risk harming its 
relations with the U.S.  These are basic steps that 
should have been taken four years ago, and would have 
saved countless Israeli and Palestinian lives by ending 
the current terror war before it started.  They are 
still the key to the beginnings of peace.  Now that we 
are in window-of-opportunity mode, these steps have 
become imperative.  Otherwise, disengagement will fall 
apart, as will the dream of Palestinian reform.\"

Abbas\'s Election 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media highlighted the large majority (an expected 
66-70 percent) received by Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) in 
the PA election on Sunday.  The turnout was high -- 
around 70 percent.  However, Jerusalem Post reported 
that \"in a stunning vote of no confidence in the 
corruption-ridden PA,\" the vast majority of Arab 
residents of East Jerusalem stayed away from city 
polling stations.  The media reported that Abbas 
declared victory in Ramallah, saying: \"We offer this 
victory to the soul of the brother martyr Yasser Arafat 
and to all Palestinians.\"  Abbas was further quoted as 
saying that the PA\'s task will be to establish a state 
with Jerusalem as its capital, and that a \"big jihad\" 
would follow the \"small jihad,\" the latter remark 
sparking media speculation regarding the course the new 
Palestinian leadership would take.  The media say that 
PM Sharon will invite Abbas for talks -- according to 
Yediot, perhaps as soon as next week.  Like other major 
media, Jerusalem Post quoted senior GOI officials as 
saying Sunday that Israel will ask Abbas to immediately 
renew security coordination and deploy PA security 
personnel at Gaza locations used to fire mortar shells 
and Qassam rockets.  Jerusalem Post quoted those 
sources as saying that if these steps are taken, Israel 
will respond in kind with steps of its own.  Ha\'aretz 
notes that the IDF reported few Palestinian complaints 
about voting hitches on Sunday.  On Sunday, Yediot 
quoted sources in Ramallah as saying that Israel has 
eased Marwan Barghouti\'s conditions of detention so 
that he can help Abbas.  Jerusalem Post cited Minister 
of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs Natan Sharansky as 
saying that the PA election was not \"truly free.\" 
 
Israel Radio reported that President Bush welcomed 
Abbas\'s election and pledged to help the Palestinian 
people, while calling on Israel to \"improve the 
humanitarian and economic situation\" in the Palestinian 
areas, and on the Arab states to resume their aid to 
the Palestinians.  Based on Reuters, Ha\'aretz cited 
Secretary of State Colin Powell\'s promise of increased 
 
SIPDIS 
aid to the Palestinians.  The media printed pictures of 
former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and Sen. John Kerry 
during Election Day. 
 
All media reported that an IDF officer was killed at 
the Sheba farms on Sunday when the jeep he was riding 
in hit an explosive charge laid by Hizbullah. 
Hizbullah later fired at IDF outposts in the area, to 
which the army responded with artillery fire and aerial 
strikes.   A French UNTSO officer was killed in the 
crossfire.  Israel Radio reported that Israel accuses 
Syria of trying to undermine Abbas\'s leadership by way 
of Hizbullah.  On Sunday, all media reported that a 
soldier was killed, three other soldiers and a civilian 
were wounded in an ambush Friday south of Nablus. 
Leading media reported that an alert for a terrorist on 
the prowl paralyzed Israel\'s central region last night. 
 
Leading media reported that the Yahad party pledged to 
abstain at today\'s Knesset vote endorsing the new 
government if the Likud \"rebels\" vote against it.  On 
Friday, Jerusalem Post mentioned Ambassador Kurtzer\'s 
longstanding close association with Labor Party MK 
Ophir Pines-Paz, who will become interior minister in 
the new government. 
 
Leading media reported that O/C Central Command Moshe 
Kaplinski will dismiss six reserve officers who 
declined to disavow a letter they signed, in which they 
stated they would refuse orders to evacuate 
settlements.  The army is considering taking 
disciplinary action against the 28 other signatories. 
The decision came after a day of talks between the 
sides Sunday, during which no agreement was reached. 
Ha\'aretz reported that Sunday in Tel Aviv, at an 
emergency conference of \"rabbis against the transfer of 
Jews,\" leading rabbis from the Religious Zionist and 
ultra-Orthodox communities joined calls to refuse to 
serve and \"severe halakhic [Jewish law-based] 
prohibitions\" against giving up territory.  The group 
took United Torah Judaism (UTJ) to task for the first 
time for joining the government coalition, although it 
was careful not to mention the name of Rabbi Yosef 
Shalom Elyashiv, UTJ\'s spiritual mentor who approved 
the move. 
 
On Sunday, Yediot reported on the defense 
establishment\'s decision to dig a ditch along the 
Philadelphi route in a few weeks.  The purpose of the 
ditch is to prevent the digging of tunnels under the 
route. 
 
Israel Radio reported that in a ceremony held at the 
Adath Israel Synagogue in New York on Sunday, 
representatives of the countries hardest-hit by the 
tsunami disaster thanked Israel and the American Jewish 
 
SIPDIS 
community for their aid.  On Sunday, Ha\'aretz reported 
that 200 Jewish and Muslim leaders from all over the 
world united against religious extremism at the \"Rabbis 
and Imams For Peace\" conference, which was held in 
Brussels last week under the sponsorship of the 
organization Hommes de Parole (\"Men of Their Word\"). 
 
Maariv (Amir Rappaport) reported that China is 
threatening to withdraw important Beijing Olympics- 
related contracts from Israel, if it does not get back 
the Harpy drones that were sent here for repair.  The 
newspaper, which says that the affair could cost Israel 
up to USD 1 billion, recalls that the U.S. is 
pressuring Israel not to return the UAVs to China. 
 
Citing Reuters, Ha\'aretz reported on Sunday that the 
World Jewish Congress announced it was about to call on 
NATO to grant Israel associate membership in the 
alliance to bolster Israel\'s security and to smooth 
relations between Europe and the Middle East. 
 
Ha\'aretz and Yediot cited Interior Ministry statistics 
as saying that the number of people living in 
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip increased 
by 6 percent last year, reaching 250,179 in 2004.  830 
people joined the Gaza Strip\'s Katif Bloc in 2004. 
 
Yediot reported that FM Silvan Shalom is considering 
naming as his spokesman Yehoshua Mor-Yosef, the 
political secretary and spokesman of the Yesha Council 
of Jewish Settlements in the Territories. 
 
All media (lead stories in Yediot and Maariv) reported 
that on Sunday, Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of 
Citigroup, accepted PM Sharon and Finance Minister 
Binyamin Netanyahu\'s offer to serve as the next 
governor of the Bank of Israel.  To take up the 
position, Fischer will have to immigrate to Israel and 
relinquish his American citizenship.  Yediot bannered 
the concern expressed by leaders of Israel\'s economy 
over the appointment: \"Why Was an American Governor 
Preferred?\" 
 
Ha\'aretz cited a survey conducted by the Jewish 
National Fund (JNF), according to which more than 70 
percent of Israel\'s Jews object to allocating JNF-owned 
lands to Arabs.

Abbas\'s Election: 
----------------- 
 
                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar opined in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"If Abu Mazen succeeds where his 
predecessor Yasser Arafat failed and lowers the heat, 
Israel will have to divest itself of the respectable 
title \'the only democracy in the Middle East.\'  Then 
the occupation will be exposed in its full nakedness.\" 
 
Liberal op-ed writer Ofer Shelach editorialized in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: \"Abu Mazen is 
the democratically elected president who enjoys 
international legitimacy, and he will not be easily 
dismissed with the wave of an Israeli hand.\" 
Regional correspondent Ronni Shaked wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot: \"It became apparent that when the 
Palestinians put the Kalashnikov aside, they are also 
capable of demonstrating different behavior.... 
Sunday\'s elections are definitely a step in the right 
direction.\" 
 
Security and intelligence affairs commentator Amit 
Cohen wrote in popular, pluralist Maariv: \"In spite of 
the difficulties that lie ahead, Israel ought to view 
these elections as a positive, encouraging step.\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"It would not be not be surprising if Abbas attempted 
to continue the path of his on-and-off mentor, Arafat.\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized: \"Abu Mazen 
comes across as a moderate.... But his worldview is no 
different from Arafat\'s: namely, action should be taken 
to promote the destruction of the State of Israel.\" 
 
Correspondent Gregory Ger (Kulchinsky) wrote in 
conservative Russian-language Vesty: \"Abu Mazen is most 
likely to be elected.  However, according to his 
statements in the past several days, the situation in 
the region will not change essentially.\" 
 
Yasser Abed Rabbo, the Palestinian co-initiator of the 
Geneva Accord, wrote in Yediot Aharonot: \"We need to 
see on the horizon the permanent solution, which is 
based on the principle of two states for two peoples 
based on the 1967 borders.  It is precisely at this 
point that the importance of the Geneva initiative is 
growing.\" 
 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Israel\'s Excuses Are Running Out\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar opined in independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz (January 10): \"If Abu Mazen 
succeeds where his predecessor Yasser Arafat failed and 
lowers the heat, Israel will have to divest itself of 
the respectable title \'the only democracy in the Middle 
East.\'  Then the occupation will be exposed in its full 
nakedness.... The control by Abu Mazen\'s government of 
the street in Gaza and a switch to nonviolent struggle 
against the occupation in the West Bank will leave 
Israel stripped of excuses to hold onto the Jewish 
settlements in the territories, never mind their 
expansion.  The separation fence, another unilateral 
initiative on Israel\'s part -- like the disengagement 
plan -- could bring it even closer to the June 4, 1967 
borders.\" 
II.  \"A New Beginning\" 
 
Liberal op-ed writer Ofer Shelach editorialized in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (January 10): 
\"As of this morning Mahmoud Abbas is the president of 
Palestine.  His subjects, most of whom face only 
poverty, occupation and corruption, may not have seen a 
great reason for celebration and did not go out, en 
masse, to the polling stations, but Abu Mazen is the 
democratically elected president who enjoys 
international legitimacy, and he will not be easily 
dismissed with the wave of an Israeli hand.  As of this 
morning it will be more difficult for Abu Mazen and 
Israel to play the game of \'them first,\' that they were 
so busy with these past few months.  There will be no 
justification for either side continuing to duck its 
responsibilities, there will no longer be anyone else 
on whom to pin the blame for failure.  As of this 
morning, the Palestinian gain is not necessarily our 
loss, and vice versa.\" 
 
III.  \"On the Way to Change\" 
 
Regional correspondent Ronni Shaked wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot (January 10): \"It became apparent that when 
the Palestinians put the Kalashnikov aside, they are 
also capable of demonstrating different behavior.  The 
problem is that many of them are not yet ready to hold 
negotiations that are not under the shadow of terror. 
What is more severe is that many terrorist groups, not 
only Hamas and Islamic Jihad, are unwilling to accept 
the authority of the leadership, even if it is the 
people\'s democratic choice.  Therefore, it is doubtful 
whether the democratic display we witnessed on Sunday 
will continue.  The Palestinians of Rafah, the Jenin 
refugee camp or Hebron have not yet internalized 
democratic values, as opposed to the yuppies of 
Ramallah and the intellectuals of Bir Zeit.... 
Nevertheless, Sunday\'s elections are definitely a step 
in the right direction....  As of today, Abu Mazen is 
no longer on the campaign trail, and cannot sell his 
people unsubstantiated slogans and declarations.  Abu 
Mazen will have to form a strong new government, 
appoint an interior minister with powers and remove the 
Tunis people from his way, those who still hold 
Arafatist views.  Abu Mazen says that he is aware of 
the problems and difficulties, and is ready for the 
challenges, but he hopes that Israel will not turn its 
back on him as it did when he served as prime minister. 
It takes two for this tango.  In order to meet his 
goals, Abu Mazen needs time.  The question is whether 
Israel will be willing to give him the necessary time 
to get organized and prove that he is indeed making 
efforts to bring about calm.\" 
 
IV.  \"Arab Countries Could Learn From Them\" 
 
Security and intelligence affairs commentator Amit 
Cohen wrote in popular, pluralist Maariv (January 10): 
\"The Palestinian public, and likewise its candidates 
for president, demonstrated a genuine desire for 
change, a desire to turn over a new leaf, to remove the 
debris of the past.  Even if the atmosphere at the 
elections was not inspired, there was a feeling that 
the democracy was genuine.  In that sense the 
Palestinians are the first of the Arab nations to 
succeed in holding an organized and orderly election 
campaign.  But in spite of the success of the election 
campaign, they have a long way to go before they can 
call themselves a democracy.  In Israel the talk is 
mostly about reform of the Palestinian security 
agencies, but the Palestinian Authority is in dire need 
of a massive overhaul of all its institutions, 
including those not directly related to the Israeli- 
Palestinian conflict.  So before the new \'Rais\' -- Abu 
Mazen -- tries to improve his relations with Israel, he 
has to set his own house in order.... In spite of the 
difficulties that lie ahead, Israel ought to view these 
elections as a positive, encouraging step, not only 
because Abu Mazen, the preferred candidate of 
Washington and Jerusalem was elected, but also because 
the Palestinian people showed Sunday that it wants a 
democratic regime subject to public scrutiny and 
responsive to public opinion.  Even though this process 
is not complete, everything should be done to help it 
on its way.\" 
 
V.  \"How to Help Abbas\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(January 10): \"Israel and the region, not to mention 
the Palestinians themselves, have a great interest in 
the success of their democracy.... Experience, however, 
indicates that it is not the margin of victory that 
will be determinative, but the expectations of the 
international community and its willingness to enforce 
them.  Abbas, after all, has taken contradictory 
positions.... In this context, it would not be not be 
surprising if Abbas attempted to continue the path of 
his on-and-off mentor, Arafat, who would sometimes 
claim to be against violence, never lift a finger to 
stop it and always claim that he was too weak to take 
steps against terrorism without further Western 
support.  Rare is the leader who will take painful 
steps when he can avoid them.  The path of least 
resistance is to make a show of effort, claim weakness 
and sit back and wait for the flurry of calls to 
\'support Abu Mazen\' to bear fruit.  This time, if the 
international community really cares about ending 
terror and the success of the Palestinian democratic 
project, it must behave differently.  Financial support 
for the new-old Palestinian leader must be tightly 
linked both to ending terrorism and violence and to 
democratic reforms.  Our own government, it should go 
without saying, should not undermine such linkage. 
Though we can always hope it will be otherwise, it 
would hardly be a surprise if one of those opposing the 
tight linkage of aid to performance is our own incoming 
vice prime minister, Shimon Peres.\" 
 
VI.  \"Now the Gestures\" 
 
Nationalist, Orthodox Hatzofe editorialized (January 
10): \"The guileful Abu Mazen has already drawn up a 
list of demands from the Israeli government the goal of 
which, so he will say, is to help him gain control over 
the Palestinian street.  All of his demands will 
receive the support of the Europeans, particularly 
Britain, and, as far as we know, Abu Mazen will find an 
attentive ear in the U.S. State Department and the 
White House.  Abu Mazen comes across as a moderate and 
his statements against violent terrorism and the 
Intifada have served him well in the West.  But his 
worldview is no different from Arafat\'s: namely, action 
should be taken to promote the destruction of the State 
of Israel.  Abu Mazen wants to make as substantial 
territorial gains as possible by means of soft 
statements in support of dialogue and against violence, 
and when he obtains most of his demands with the help 
of the superpowers\' pressure, he will turn to the use 
of weapons and warfare.... Abu Mazen is taking a new 
approach, and Israel now is going to pay a dear price 
for Abu Mazen\'s guile.  Under the cover of the relative 
quiet and the smiles, a military power with 
unparalleled ability to jeopardize Israel will be 
built.  One of the chief proponents of this approach is 
Egypt.  The President of Egypt, who ignores the arms 
smuggling operations by the terror organizations from 
his country, considers Abu Mazen to be an ally with 
whom he can steal horses. Ariel Sharon, the strategist 
and military genius, has gone blind in many fields, and 
we can only hope that we do not discover the heavy 
price that we are going to have to pay too late.\" 
 
VII.  \"Palestinians to Elect Their \'Rais\'\" 
 
Correspondent Gregory Ger (Kulchinsky) wrote in 
conservative Russian-language Vesty (January 9): \"The 
Palestinians are electing a new \'Rais\'...  Abu Mazen is 
most likely to be elected.  However, according to his 
statements in the past several days, the situation in 
the region will not change essentially. ... Abu Mazen 
is not planning to change his predecessor\'s human 
resources politics seriously.  The discontinuation of 
the \'politics of terror\' also raises serious doubts 
among the experts.  Sources in the Prime Minister\'s 
Office assume that Sharon\'s meeting with Abu Mazen 
(should Abu Mazen be elected) would take place a couple 
of days after the elections.  ...  First of all Prime 
Minister Sharon would demand that PA Chairman [act] to 
stop mortar and rocket fire [on Israeli towns]\". 
VIII.  \"Israel\'s Choice\" 
 
Yasser Abed Rabbo, the Palestinian co-initiator of the 
Geneva Accord, wrote in Yediot Aharonot (January 9): 
\"The incipient new political reality in Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority have led the two parties to the 
threshold of a great opportunity.  They have both grown 
weary of the ongoing conflict, and the time has come to 
bring about its end.  People in the Palestinian 
leadership can already begin to feel the change.  We 
began to promote reforms, we openly declared our 
opposition to violence and many democratic countries 
are envious of our election process.  However, to 
complete the initiatives we have begun, we need a 
genuine Israeli partner and a stable and credible 
political process.... An Israeli withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip is certainly a positive step, but the 
Palestinians still do no know what will happen after 
disengagement.  Does \'Gaza first\' also mean \'Gaza 
last,\' as the Prime Minister\'s aide, Dov Weisglass, 
said?  Will the northern part of the West Bank turn 
into an isolated territory?  It is important to 
underscore that the Israeli government will have no 
Palestinian partner for forcing a solution that does 
not take into account the vital needs and interests of 
the Palestinian people.  By the same token it is clear 
that for a solution to be viable it has to be accepted 
by the Israeli public.  For us to become Israel\'s 
partners in the disengagement plan as well, we need to 
envision an end to construction in the settlements and 
an end to the construction of the separation wall in 
the West Bank.  More importantly, we need to see on the 
horizon the permanent solution, which is based on the 
principle of two states for two peoples based on the 
1967 borders.  It is precisely at this point that the 
importance of the Geneva initiative is growing.\"

E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/07/2015 
TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, GOI EXTERNAL, GAZA DISENGAGEMENT, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS 
SUBJECT: IDF CHIEF OF STAFF DISCUSSES PALESTINIAN 
ELECTIONS, DISENGAGEMENT, IRAN, AND SYRIA WITH CODEL KYL 
 
 
Classified By: Acting DCM Norman H. Olsen; Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Israeli Defense Force (IDF) Chief of Staff 
LtG Moshe Ya\'alon told CoDel Kyl January 7 that recent events 
have ushered in \"an era of strategic opportunity\" in the 
Middle East.  He said that Israel is facilitating Palestinian 
elections and believes that Abu Mazen is strong enough to 
control terrorism -- including by Hamas and Islamic Jihad -- 
if he makes a strategic decision to do so.  Ya\'alon noted 
that the IDF is ready to implement disengagement from Gaza in 
July.  He urged international sanctions against Iran to 
prevent Tehran from acquiring the capability to produce 
nuclear weapons.  He also suggested that USG influence on 
Egypt could end weapons smuggling through Sinai and that 
international pressure could help reduce support for 
terrorism by Lebanon, Syria, and Iran.  He ascribed improved 
security within Israel to the IDF\'s offensive operations in 
the Palestinian territories and to the construction of the 
security barrier.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) CoDel Kyl met with Ya\'alon in the Israeli Ministry of 
Defense on January 7.  The Congressional delegation consisted 
of Senators Jon Kyl, Lisa Murkowski, and Mel Martinez, and 
Representative Adam Smith, as well as Congressional and 
military staff.  They were joined by Charge d\'Affaires Norm 
Olsen, Defense Attache Colonel Timothy Murphy, and poloff 
(notetaker).  Ya\'alon was accompanied by Commander of the IDF 
Media and Communications Division BG Ruth Yaron, Chairman of 
the Knesset\'s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Yuval 
Steinitz, and staffers from the Knesset, IDF, MOD, and MFA. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
New Opportunities and the Palestinian Elections 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (C) Ya\'alon called 2005 \"an era of strategic opportunity,\" 
brought about by the U.S. presidential election, death of 
Arafat, approval of PM Sharon\'s disengagement plan, and 
upcoming elections in Iraq.  He said that Israel is doing its 
best to facilitate Palestinian elections.  The IDF is acting 
with restraint and avoiding operations in urban areas to the 
extent possible, despite what he said were 100 terrorist 
incidents last week.  If the terrorist attacks continue after 
the elections, however, he cautioned that he is \"not sure 
what will happen on Monday or Tuesday.\" 
 
4. (C) Senator Martinez asked if Abu Mazen will have control 
of the PA security forces after the election.  Ya\'alon 
replied that this appears to be the case, provided the 
Palestinian leadership implements the proposed security 
reforms and takes advantage of logistical support offered by 
Egypt, the EU, and UK.  Israel will do its best to let Abu 
Mazen succeed and will give him \"a few weeks\" to organize his 
forces, said Ya\'alon.  This process must occur in a matter of 
\"days, not years,\" he cautioned.  Ya\'alon maintained that it 
is not a question of capabilities, but of a political 
decision to stop terror.  He said Palestinian security forces 
were prepared to crack down on terrorists after Arafat\'s 
death, but \"never received the order.\"  Ya\'alon noted that 
Abu Mazen wants to convince the terrorists to voluntarily 
refrain from attacks, but \"there is no way to convince 
without a stick.\" 
 
5. (C) In response to a question by Senator Kyl, Ya\'alon 
replied that PA forces are strong enough to deal with Hamas 
or Islamic Jihad.  Ya\'alon stressed that Abu Mazen must act 
or Hamas will control the Palestinian agenda.  He added that 
the USG and others should focus on Hizballah, whose 
capabilities are concentrated in areas outside of PA control. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
IDF Ready to Implement Disengagement in July 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Ya\'alon insisted that the IDF is ready to implement 
disengagement in July.  Israel prefers to coordinate with the 
Palestinians, he said, but is prepared to act unilaterally if 
necessary.  Ya\'alon predicted that extremists will increase 
their attacks in the summer in an attempt to create the 
impression of an Israeli retreat.  After this period, the PA 
will see it in their own interest to make disengagement a 
success and build a case for disengagement from parts of the 
West Bank.  Outside forces such as Iran, Syria, and their 
client groups will seek to undermine the PA efforts, he said, 
but Israel will work to counter these threats. 
 
7. (C) Senator Kyl asked how Israel will ensure security in 
Gaza after disengagement.  Ya\'alon replied that the IDF will 
increase its intelligence capabilities and deploy along the 
border behind the existing security barrier.  Ya\'alon 
cautioned that if attacks continue after disengagement, 
Israel will respond, even if it must redeploy ground forces 
into Gaza.  Ya\'alon said that he has recommended that Israeli 
forces remain in the Philadelphi strip along the border with 
Egypt until the PA demonstrates \"responsible and effective 
leadership.\"  He added that any redeployment from Philadelphi 
before that point would be a \"disaster\" and result in Gaza 
degenerating into \"Hamasstan, Al-Qaedastan, Hizballahstan.\" 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Dealing with Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Steinitz stressed what he said is the important role 
that the Arab countries play in encouraging Palestinian 
terrorism.  Ya\'alon noted that Iran, Syria, Hamas, Hizballah, 
Islamic Jihad, and others see the adoption of western values 
in the region as a threat.  They decided to increase 
terrorism in the region \"the day Arafat died\" in order to 
prevent Abu Mazen from reaching an agreement with Israel.  He 
claimed that 75 percent of attacks by Palestinian terrorists 
are financed by Iran, and that the main operational 
headquarters for terrorism in the Palestinian areas is 
operated by Hizballah in Beirut. 
 
9. (C) Addressing the topic of weapons smuggling, Ya\'alon 
said all of Israel\'s borders are quiet except for the one 
with Egypt.  He described the Sinai, however, as a \"paradise 
for smugglers.\"  Steinitz told the CoDel that \"Egypt is doing 
to us what Syria is doing to you in Iraq.\"  Despite what 
Ya\'alon described as a \"very good atmosphere\" in 
Egyptian-Israeli relations, Cairo refuses to address the 
problem.  He claimed that the only way to change the Egyptian 
tolerance of smuggling is for the USG to threaten financial 
consequences. 
 
10. (C) Ya\'alon said that even the Europeans understand that 
Iran \"is determined to acquire military nuclear 
capabilities.\"  He said there is still a chance to attempt to 
convince Tehran to give up its military program (primarily 
the fuel cycle), but described the EU-3 agreement as \"not 
enough.\"  He reiterated Israel\'s view that the IAEA should 
report Iran to the UNSC.  Representative Smith asked how Iran 
and Syria should be dealt with and about the possibilities of 
greater cooperation with Europe.  Ya\'alon said the best way 
to deal with external support for terror is through political 
and economic sanctions.  The USG and Israel should work to 
convince the Europeans to be more aggressive in this regard, 
he added. 
 
11. (C) Ya\'alon said that Israeli intelligence experts had 
briefed their European counterparts on the Iranian nuclear 
threat.  While there is some cause for optimism, he added, 
certain \"key\" political leaders such as German FM Joschka 
Fischer still need to understand that Iran represents \"not 
just unconventional capabilities, but an unconventional 
regime,\" which makes the threat to Europe tangibly different 
than that posed by Russia during the Cold War.  Ya\'alon said 
there is no chance to influence Iranian policy without 
political and economic sanctions.  Such sanctions might also 
facilitate internal political change in Iran, he added. 
 
-------------------------- 
Israel\'s Strategic Paradox 
-------------------------- 
 
12. (C) Ya\'alon described what he called Israel\'s \"strategic 
paradox.\"  Despite its unbroken string of conventional 
military victories and status as a regional superpower, 
Israel still faces neighbors who question its \"right to exist 
as a Jewish state.\"  Unable to challenge the IDF, Israel\'s 
enemies began a \"subconventional war\" targeting civilians 
with terror, primarily mortar, rocket, and suicide bomber 
attacks.  They intend to use both terror and demographics to 
drive Israelis out.  Ya\'alon described the Intifada as a 
political decision by the Palestinian leadership and not a 
popular uprising.  He claimed that Fatah leaders saw the Oslo 
accords as a \"Trojan horse\" that allowed them to return to 
the West Bank and Gaza and commence terror operations. 
 
13. (C) Ya\'alon said the IDF faces \"new challenges\" in 
dealing with the terrorist infrastructure.  One part of this 
task is to address the educational system, incitement, and 
ideology supporting terror, he said.  Ya\'alon expressed full 
support for the USG\'s strategy of fostering democracy and 
education in the region.  The other component is eliminating 
capabilities, where, he added, \"the best defense -- even with 
terrorism -- is offense, no doubt about it.\"  Israel has 
arrested \"thousands\" of terrorists and continues to apprehend 
15-20 a day.  According to Ya\'alon, Israel enjoys four 
important advantages in its war against terror: intelligence 
dominance, air superiority, precision munitions, and 
information dominance (i.e., the ability to transmit 
intelligence to the IDF end-user and systems in real time). 
In the West Bank, Israeli security forces have freedom of 
movement and can make arrests with relatively small numbers 
of troops.  In Gaza, however, troops are not based in the 
cities, necessitating larger deployments for each operation. 
Ya\'alon said that these offensive operations, combined with 
the construction of the security barrier, are \"the main 
reason we now enjoy a relatively fair security situation\" 
inside Israel.

the Bank of Israel

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) On January 9, Prime Minister Sharon and Finance 
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu jointly nominated 
Professor Stanley Fischer as the next Governor of the Bank 
of Israel.  Fischer accepted the nomination the same day, 
although it will require further administrative and 
political approvals, including by the Cabinet and the 
President of Israel.  The announcement that a non-Israeli 
was being offered such an important economic post created a 
media furor, although none of the critics of the decision 
deny Professor Fischer\'s accomplishments and achievements. 
Those who support the nomination, including the Prime 
Minister and the Finance Minister, believe that the 
nomination will reap fruit in terms of encouraging 
investment, and boosting international recognition of the 
Israeli economy in the era of globalization.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
And the Envelope Please... 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) With David Klein\'s term as Governor of the Bank of 
Israel ending on January 16, readers of the local press were 
treated to several weeks of speculation regarding the 
identity of the next Governor.  According to press reports, 
none of the candidates proposed by the search team made up 
of the Director General of the Prime Minister\'s Office and 
the Finance Ministry were acceptable to both institutions. 
As a result, it appeared increasingly likely that Dr. Klein 
would be appointed to a second term as a \"compromise 
candidate.\" 
 
3. (U) It turned out that a compromise candidate was found, 
but it was not Klein.  Finance Minister Netanyahu told radio 
station Kol Israel on January 10 that he had felt it was 
unlikely that someone of Fischer\'s status would agree to 
accept the position, and that only on the Sunday morning 
before he and the Prime Minister were supposed to meet to 
make a final decision did Professor Fischer agree to accept 
the position.  Netanyahu said both he and the PM agreed that 
having Fischer at the BOI was a golden opportunity for the 
Israeli economy. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Appointment of \"Outsider\" Raises Shekels 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Israeli press play was fairly homogeneous, with 
commentators simultaneously highlighting Fischer\'s gold- 
plated economic credentials while criticizing the selection 
of a non-Israeli for such a key position here.  Most 
articles noted that, although Fischer was one of the 
architects of the 1985 Economic Stabilization Plan, which 
brought inflation down from more than 400% in that year to 
the double digits, he does not speak fluent Hebrew, and is 
naturally not completely versed the political and economic 
forces at play in Israel.  Sever Plotzker, Economic Editor 
of Yedhiot Achronot, stressed that, although Fischer \"is not 
familiar in depth with the Israeli economy, speaks only 
basic Hebrew,\" ... the fact that he \"consented to accept the 
post of Governor of the Bank of Israel and give up a salary 
worth millions of dollars and a senior position in an 
American financial institution, sends a highly optimistic 
message about the Israeli economy...  Although it would have 
been better to have an Israeli governor for Israel\'s central 
bank, we will accept him as a new immigrant with open arms.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Fischer\'s Views on the Israeli Economy: 
Watch that Budget Deficit 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) Fischer outlined his economic views at Tel Aviv 
University on November 30, when he was in Israel for the 
jubilee celebration of the Bank of Israel.  Almost to a one, 
they reflect positions championed by Finance Minister 
Netanyahu.  Fischer criticized the centralization of 
interest rate decisions in the hands of the BOI Governor, 
and argued that a monetary policy committee should make such 
decisions.  He cited an ideal inflation rate of around 2 
percent, noting that a negative deviation can be as serious 
as the opposite.  (Note: This appears to have been a 
negative reference to the tight monetary policy pursued by 
Klein, which led to negative inflation in 2003).  Regarding 
taxes, although he did not refer specifically to Israel, he 
indicated that the global trend is reducing tax rates.  He 
felt that Israel needs to take a more serious and systematic 
approach to social welfare.  He is in favor of the Bachar 
capital market reforms. 
 
6.  (U) Regarding the Israeli fiscal framework, Fischer 
argued that the budget deficit remains too large as a result 
of a bloated public sector and inflated defense burden.  He 
spoke strongly in favor of implementing economic reforms. 
Fischer is also known for his belief that there is no growth 
without peace. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Positive Reactions from Economic Circles 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Professional economists almost universally approved 
of the Fischer appointment, quickly issuing comments January 
10.  Former BOI governors were especially effusive.  Yackov 
Frankel told Haaretz that \"This is an excellent nomination 
of a man who is a first-rate professional and who has 
decided to immigrate to Israel and lead the Bank of Israel.\" 
Frankel added that he is convinced that Fischer will 
maintain monetary stability, while promoting sustained 
economic growth.  Former BOI Governor Arnon Gafni reminisced 
to Kol Israel about Fischer\'s key assistance in bringing 
down Israeli inflation in the mid-1980s.  He said that 
Fischer is one of the finest economists in the world, as 
well as a loyal Jew.  Klein himself, whom one MoF official 
said took the news as \"the real gentleman he is,\" noted 
Fischer\'s status as a \"first-rate economist,\" and said that 
Israel will benefit from Fischer\'s broad connections. 
 
8.  (SBU) The private sector was also pleased by the 
announcement.  One mission contact, head of economic 
research at a major Israeli bank, told us he was \"very happy 
and surprised\" by the nomination.  He noted \"foreign 
financial institutions will be very pleased by the 
appointment.\"  He said he expected Fischer to stress the 
importance of fiscal stability.  Although Fischer was likely 
to work well with Netanyahu and other politicians, he was 
likely to be \"tested\" by the Knesset Finance Committee in 
his role as economic advisor to the government.  This 
contact said he expected Fischer to call on his extensive 
international contacts to support his policy positions, and 
would put these contacts to good use in upcoming policy 
battles. 
 
9.  (SBU)  Another mission contact, the head of an 
international bank\'s Israel office, told us he expected 
Fischer to do well as Governor, both domestically and 
internationally.  He had sat in on a number of meetings 
between Fischer and PM Sharon, and noted \"Sharon listens 
when Fischer speaks.\"  Internationally, Fischer possessed 
immense credibility.  Finally, he noted, domestic and 
international banks operating in Israel were certain to find 
out soon that there would be \"no more bullshitting the 
Israeli regulators...\" 
 
10.  (U) Ohad Marani, Former Director General of the Finance 
Ministry, told Kol Israel that in spite of the predictable 
initial criticism, he thinks that this will be one of the 
most successful appointments by the State of Israel.  He 
noted that Fischer\'s ability to integrate the theory and 
practice of economics will result in his being a very 
successful Governor.  Marani stressed that, although Fischer 
is an \"American import,\" Israelis recognize American talents 
in all possible areas - academic, business, art, sport, as 
well as economic. 
 
11.  (U) Perhaps the most objective observer, the stock 
market, racked up immediate gains following the nomination. 
The dollar has remained stable. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Political Echelon: Mixed Reviews 
-------------------------------- 
 
12.  (U) The reaction to the news was more heterogeneous 
within the political sphere.  Labor Party leader Shimon 
Peres, who worked closely with Fischer at the time that the 
1985 Stabilization Program was implemented, expressed wide 
support for the appointment in a January 10 interview with 
Kol Israel.  Peres noted that the nomination of a non-Israel 
was not uncontroversial, but reminded listeners of the many 
prominent Israeli immigrants. 
 
13.  (U) Even MK Amir Peretz, Netanyahu\'s nemesis, appeared 
to be open-minded.  He is pleased that Fischer understands 
the connection between peace and economics, and said that he 
hopes he will be able to resolve economic-social issues. 
Peretz said the test will be whether Fischer succeeds in 
reducing the income gaps in the society. 
 
--------- 
Naysayers 
--------- 
 
14.  (U) Former Shinui Party Minister of the Interior 
Avraham Poraz strongly opposed the nomination, saying that 
it was unacceptable for a non-Israeli to hold such an 
important position. He noted that, although Fischer is 
Jewish, he did not immigrate, did not serve in the army, nor 
did his children, and although he may be a fist-class 
economist, he was divorced from the average Israeli 
experience. 
 
-------------------- 
Fischer\'s Challenges 
-------------------- 
 
15.  On the policy front, Fischer is likely to face at least 
three basic challenges: 
 
Philosophy:  Fischer will have to decide whether the Bank\'s 
effort to maintain price stability should be leavened with 
the political objective of job creation.  Although Klein and 
Netanyahu agreed on the importance of using monetary policy 
to battle inflation, Netanyahu felt Klein\'s conservative 
financial stance was too harsh.  Now that the Labor Party is 
in the government, the pressure to lower the 10 percent 
unemployment rate and to act on the hot button issue of an 
increased poverty index will increase further. 
 
Independence:  The Bank is independent and the Governor 
retains sole decision-making of the interest rate and money 
targets. The Finance Ministry and Klein have sparred on who 
can be primary dealers of government bonds. Finance will 
continue to push to establish a committee with outside 
members chosen by the government to make interest rate 
decisions.  Klein strongly opposed such a step, but it 
appears likely Fischer will be more amenable to working out 
a modus vivendi. 
 
Labor: Klein has tried to tie BOI staff compensation to 
performance and to ensure bank workers are putting in the 
hours they are supposed to and are doing appropriate work. 
For this he got a union revolt with epithets written on the 
bathroom walls. The labor strife with the bank\'s highly 
compensated workforce will continue if the next governor 
tries to bring the bank into the 21st century.

SUBJECT: DESPITE UNITY GOVERNMENT, SHARON STILL STRAINING 
TO PASS BUDGET 
 
Classified By: A/DCM Norman Olsen for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) A division among the 13 Likud disengagement foes in 
the Knesset may prompt several to give Prime Minister Sharon 
the eight or so votes he needs to ensure first-reading 
passage of the 2005 budget.  The 13, known as \"the rebels,\" 
have threatened to vote against the budget -- as they did 
against forming the government -- as a means of derailing 
Sharon\'s disengagement plan.  While his government nominally 
controls 66 Knesset seats, opposition by the 13 rebels would 
leave Sharon scrambling to construct a simple majority from a 
combination of opposition \"pro\" votes and abstentions.  The 
Knesset opens debate on the budget late January 11 and is 
scheduled to vote on it in a first reading January 12. 
 
2.  (C) According to Likud rebel MK Gilad Erdan (strictly 
protect), some of the rebels may support Sharon on the budget 
to prevent early elections, something many of them fear.  Few 
observers believe that Likud would retain its 40 Knesset 
seats in new elections, which could thus cost some MKs their 
seats.  He also discounted what he referred to as \"media 
hype\" that the Likud Party itself could split, joking that 
the Likud name is like \"Coca Cola,\" and no one wants to split 
from such a popular party.  Erdan noted that some of the 
rebels want to separate their opposition to disengagement 
from their basic support for the budget.  Erdan predicted 
that in the end, therefore, Sharon would be able to pass his 
budget.  A noted academic also told the Ambassador that he 
was seeing gaps in the rebels\' ranks and predicted that 
Sharon would try to \"pick them off one by one.\" 
 
3.  (C) Separately, Or Pearl, assistant to Likud 
disengagement foe MK Ehud Yatom, said that while several of 
the rebels have indicated an intention to support Sharon on 
the budget to avoid elections, they may end up following the 
forceful lead of arch disengagement foe Uzi Landau, who will 
likely vote against the budget.  Pearl highlighted that the 
rebels have been lately voting as a bloc and will probably 
meet January 12 prior to the budget vote to decide on a 
uniform position. 
 
4.  (C) Without the rebels, Sharon can count on some 53-54 
MKs from his new coalition and several mavericks from outside 
to support the 2005 budget.  The 14 Shinui MKs, the six 
National Religious Party MKs, the six National Union Party 
MKs, and up to eight MKs from the Arab parties, will probably 
oppose the budget.  The 11 Shas MKs and Yahad\'s six MKs will 
either vote against the budget or abstain.  Support of the 
pro-disengagement Yahad party and the United Arab List\'s two 
abstentions saved Sharon\'s government in the January 10 vote, 
but these parties\' economic policies may prevent them from 
supporting Sharon on the budget.  In addition, Am Ehad, while 
formally part of the coalition since it merged with Labor 
January 1, has indicated it cannot support Sharon\'s budget.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media reported that PM Sharon\'s new government was 
narrowly approved in the Knesset Monday, 58-56, with 6 
abstentions, despite no-confidence votes from 13 
members of his own Likud party, thanks to support from 
outside the coalition by the Yahad faction (except 
Yossi Sarid, who abstained), and the abstention of two 
Israeli Arab Knesset members.  One United Torah Judaism 
(UTJ) Knesset member, Meir Porush, who was slated to 
become deputy transportation minister, abstained; some 
media cited the belief of Knesset sources that he was 
instructed to do so by one of the rabbis on UTJ\'s 
Council of Torah Sages.  Anti-disengagement Hatzofe 
bannered: \"Transfer Government Underway Thanks to Arab 
and Left-Wing Votes.\"  (The newspaper views the 
evacuation of settlements as an illegitimate transfer 
of Jews from their homes.)  The media say that the new 
government\'s first test will come Wednesday when the 
proposed state budget for 2005 is brought before the 
plenum for a first reading.  Maariv and other media say 
that despite Shas\'s current opposition to the 
government, Sharon has demonstrated optimism regarding 
Shas\'s inclusion in his coalition, following the 
victory of Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen): Shas mentor Rabbi 
Ovadia Yosef could change his ruling on disengagement. 
 
Leading media reported that Sharon is expected to 
telephone PA chairman-elect Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) 
today to congratulate him on Sunday\'s election victory. 
Yediot reported that Israel has offered to grant the 
Palestinians control of Ramallah, and later of other 
cities.  Israel Radio reported that President Moshe 
Katsav called Abbas this morning to congratulate him, 
telling him he is interested in meeting with him after 
Sharon does.  The station quoted Defense Minister Shaul 
Mofaz as saying at this morning\'s cabinet meeting that 
Israel must talk with PA representatives.  Jerusalem 
Post quoted Abbas as saying Monday that the 
Palestinians \"are ready for peace.\" 
 
All media reported that President Bush reached out 
Monday to Abbas with a proposal for direct talks and a 
White House meeting, urging him to quickly bolster 
Palestinian security forces to take on militants.  Bush 
praised Israel for letting Palestinian voters in 
Jerusalem have access to polling stations and said 
there were more steps Israel should take, citing the 
need for Israel \"to fulfill its obligation on the 
withdrawal from the territories that it has pledged to 
withdraw from.  He added that Israel \"can play an 
important part in the development of the Palestinian 
state\" and stressed the need for the Palestinian 
leadership to \"consolidate security forces so that they 
can fight off those few who still have the desire to 
destroy Israel as part of their philosophy.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that visiting Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) 
asked Sharon Monday why Israel is not evacuating the 
illegal settler outposts in the West Bank.  The 
newspaper cited Sharon\'s reply that the public mood in 
Israel regarding the disengagement plan, and 
Palestinian terrorism, are making such a move 
difficult.  Jerusalem Post reported that Sharon told 
Kerry that Abbas will be tested by how he stops terror, 
but that as a first step Israel will accept an internal 
Palestinian cease-fire.  Jerusalem Post reported that 
Sen. John Kyl (R-AZ), the head of a visiting 
Congressional delegation, called Monday for the new PA 
leadership to fight terrorism and incitement, and enact 
transparency in finances as a condition for receiving 
more U.S. aid. 
 
All media reported that over 15,000 people attended a 
two hour-long anti-disengagement prayer rally opposite 
the Knesset on Monday.  Maariv and Hatzofe reported 
that on Monday Police Commissioner Moshe Karadi, A-G 
Menachem Mazuz, and State Attorney Eran Shendar decided 
to take stronger measures against manifestations of 
violence expected to take place as the implementation 
of the disengagement plan starts.  Among other proposed 
steps, quick trials would be conducted. 
 
Maariv reported that according to one proposal, 3,000 
Palestinian houses would be demolished to dig the 
trench proposed by the IDF in order to prevent the 
digging of tunnels under the Philadelphi route. 
Jerusalem Post reported that hundreds of Palestinian 
students attending a rally at Bir Zeit University on 
Monday called for more suicide attacks against Israel. 
The newspaper also reported that Sana al-Hibel, a woman 
from the Gaza Strip, called on Abbas to end the firing 
of Qassam rockets. 
 
Israel Radio reported that this morning Qassam rockets 
and mortar shells were fired at Sderot and Gaza Strip 
settlements.  There were no casualties.  In a different 
development, Ha\'aretz quoted senior Israeli defense 
officials monitoring Hizbullah activity as saying that 
the Shi\'ite organization runs a \"conveyor-belt\" 
operation in the territories, as its goal is to create 
as many terrorist cells as possible, and Hizbullah is 
happy with even the smallest attacks. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Monday the UN declared that 
Hizbullah bears the main responsibility for the death 
of a French officer from IDF fire on Sunday. 
Ha\'aretz reported that a military court sentenced a 
soldier who lied to Military Police and his commanding 
officers during a probe into the death of Tom Hurndall, 
a British International Solidarity Mission (ISM) 
volunteer, to five and a half months in jail. 
Ha\'aretz reported that a bill circulating in the 
Palestinian Legislative Council stipulates that the 
PA\'s National Security Council will become the most 
influential PA body over the Palestinian government\'s 
security apparatus.  Abbas will be \"supreme commander\" 
of the security forces, but unlike Yasser Arafat, he 
will not take part in the council\'s meetings. 
 
A senior U.S. administration official was quoted as 
saying in an interview with Jerusalem Post that the 
U.S. does not believe Egypt is secretly developing 
nuclear weapons, despite a finding by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Egypt has been 
conducting experiments which the IAEA says could be 
part of a hidden nuclear weapons program. 
 
Leading media reported that, for the seventh 
consecutive year, U.S., Turkish, and Israeli naval 
forces will hold a joint exercise today in the 
Mediterranean.  Israel Radio notes that Jordan will 
send an observer to the maneuver. 
 
Maariv reported that the Spanish government has invited 
representatives from Arab states and senior PA 
officials, but not Israeli officials, to attend a world 
summit on terror that will take place on the 
anniversary of the March 1, 2004 Madrid bombings. 
 
Last night, Channel 10-TV broadcast a report by its 
team that flew with U.S. troops on an aid mission to 
Banda Aceh, Indonesia.

I.  \"Partner For the Pullout -- and After\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(January 11): \"The victory of Fatah\'s candidate, 
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), in the election for a new 
Palestinian Authority chairman is likely to be an 
important milestone in the efforts to obtain a halt to 
the violent conflict, and thereafter perhaps an 
agreement as well.... The new PA chairman was elected 
against the background of a new reality in the region 
and the world: four years of bloodshed, which resulted 
in many victims and heavy damage; an American 
government that is seeking a way out of the ongoing 
crisis in Iraq; and hints of a new direction in Syria. 
But more important than any of these is the change in 
Israel. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\'s disengagement 
plan, which has just received a boost in the form of a 
new government that includes Labor, is slated to 
dismantle all Israeli settlements and military 
installations in the Gaza Strip this year and transfer 
them to the Palestinians.  This is a dramatic move that 
accords with the Palestinians\' interests.  Abu Mazen 
can integrate his plans for a cease-fire and the 
rehabilitation of the security services in Gaza with 
the PA\'s assumption of full responsibility for the Gaza 
Strip.  Such integration will increase the odds of 
success for the disengagement, which is currently the 
most relevant diplomatic plan on the agenda of both 
parties to the conflict.\" 
 
II.  \"The Voice of the Majority\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in the lead editorial of mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (January 11): 
\"The masses that voted for Abu Mazen in the race for 
the president of the Palestinian Authority ... also 
voted, given the circumstances, against the ideology 
that Arafat nurtured for years. Arafat rejected 
democratic elections, rejected the establishment of a 
Palestinian governmental authority that would disarm 
the terror organizations, rejected genuine dialogue 
with Israel and rejected the establishment of a 
Palestinian state inside borders based on a realistic 
compromise.  All of Arafat\'s rejections became central 
components in the platform on which Abu Mazen ran and 
won.   And who would have believed that Fatah, a 
secular Palestinian political movement, which was 
eulogized by so many experts as washed out and as 
having capitulated to the frothing wave of Islamic 
extremism, would suddenly awaken from its coma, 
organize and achieve such an impressive victory in the 
elections?  But historical surprises abound not only in 
the Palestinian arena, but in our arena as well.  Who 
would have believed that the overtly left wing party 
Yahad would raise its hand in the Knesset in favor of a 
government led by Ariel Sharon, so that Sharon -- as 
the prime minister of a stable government -- might 
implement his plan to remove all Jewish settlements 
from the Gaza Strip?  Who would have believed that the 
silent civil majority that yearns for normalcy would at 
long last make its voice heard loudly in Israel and in 
the Palestinian Authority?  This is a clear and 
practical voice that democratically defeats both Jewish 
messianism and Palestinian messianism.  Those who did 
not believe, evidently, were people of little faith.\" 
 
III.  \"Sharon and Abu Mazen: Together But Alone\" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of 
Yediot Aharonot (January 11): \"This could have been an 
era of positive change.  A new president was elected to 
the Palestinian Authority who he has consistently 
spoken out against terrorism and violence.  The 
majority that he received gives him prestige in the 
world and a mandate to make changes at home.  He needs 
a strong, self-assured Israeli government that will 
help him establish himself.  Sharon has the 
resoluteness, but he wants for votes.  Abu Mazen has 
the votes, but many people doubt how resolute he is. 
The two of them are planning to make revolutionary 
changes in the Middle Eastern reality.  All provided 
that [\'rebel\' Likud Knesset Members] Madame Naomi 
Blumenthal and Monsieur Mickey Ratzon, not to mention 
Yehiel Hazan, deign to give them permission.\" 
 
IV.  \"A Victory For the Two-State Approach\" 
 
Arab affairs commentator Danny Rubinstein wrote in 
Ha\'aretz (January 11): \"Mahmoud Abbas\'s impressive 
victory in the Palestinian Authority\'s presidential 
elections is to a large extent also a victory for the 
Fatah movement.... The Fatah movement has not only not 
disintegrated, but it appears to have pulled itself 
together and been strengthened.... This success for the 
movement is of enormous importance because it is the 
movement that led the Palestinian public and the PLO to 
recognize the state of Israel and stick to a \'two 
states for two peoples\' strategy.... Abbas and Fatah\'s 
election victory can definitely be interpreted as a 
victory of the strategy of negotiations with Israel and 
establishing a state alongside it, and not instead of 
it.  Even at the height of the suicide bombings, polls 
in the territories showed that the majority still 
believed that a two-state arrangement would be the best 
-- and the elections this week confirm that remains the 
overwhelmingly prevailing view.\" 
 
V.  \"The Second Palestinian Revolution\" 
 
Oslo accords architect Ron Pundak wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot (January 11): \"Abu Mazen\'s election to the 
presidency of the Palestinian Authority, and his new 
status at the head of the PLO are placing the 
Palestinians and their leadership at a new crossroads. 
The easier direction would be the continuation of the 
violent Arafat-style revolution.  The more difficult 
course leads to an Abu-Mazen-style civilian revolution. 
In actual fact, we are already in the twilight zone 
between the two, but an opportunity for significant 
change has now been created.  In this context, Israel 
can be compared to traffic lights.... The course 
steered by Abu Mazen could lead to peace and security 
in this region, but it takes two to tango.  In order 
for the Palestinians to show restraint and considerable 
tolerance required of them, Israel must help Abu Mazen 
create an increasing number of positive stimuli. 
Alongside a true dialogue, a release of prisoners, the 
lifting of roadblocks, and a general change of attitude 
will help Abu Mazen turn the [Palestinian] street from 
violence and incitement into conciliation and a 
diplomatic solution, fighting and the war into a 
dialogue and peace, the first revolution into the 
second one.  Now more than ever, the key is in Israel\'s 
hands.  If we so want, we\'ll make Palestinian change 
possible.  If we don\'t, we\'ll perpetuate war and 
terror.\" 
 
VI.  \"Challenge and Promise\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(January 11): \"The new government\'s most daunting goal 
will, of course, be to pull Israel out of the Gaza 
Strip and northern Samaria [i.e. the northernmost part 
of the West Bank], as has already been decided by the 
outgoing government and approved by the Knesset.  That 
goal, however, could have been accomplished by a 
secular coalition.  The reason such a configuration was 
not chosen was the great desire to avert civil strife, 
a goal that stands a better chance of being 
accomplished with at least some religious politicians 
on Sharon\'s bandwagon.  It follows that a major goal 
for this coalition in general, and its religious 
members in particular, is to avert a civil war as 
Israelis are detached from communities they built with 
the government\'s encouragement.\"

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Israel Radio reported that this afternoon the Knesset 
approved the 2005 state budget in a first reading, 64- 
53, as the \"rebel\" Likud Knesset members -- except 
former FM David Levy and Yehiel Hazan -- decided to 
endorse it.  All media had led with the possibility 
that the vote of the \"rebels\" could have toppled PM 
Sharon\'s new national unity government.  Leading media 
reported that United Torah Judaism (UTJ) is splitting 
into its two component factions -- Agudat Yisrael and 
Degel Hatorah -- which will remain in the government 
coalition. 
 
Leading media reported that Tuesday Sharon 
congratulated PA chairman-elect Mahmoud Abbas (Abu 
Mazen) on his \"personal achievement\" in the elections, 
and told the cabinet that he would be meeting him in 
the \"near future.\"  Israel Radio quoted Secretary of 
State Colin Powell as saying Tuesday on Fox News-TV 
that if Abbas fights those who support violence, \"the 
U.S. will be able to support him.\'\'   The radio 
reported that Powell talked on the phone with Sharon 
and FM Silvan Shalom, and urged them to advance the 
peace process.  Israel Radio reported that Jibril 
Rajoub, the PA\'s National Security Advisor, has 
tendered his resignation.  However, he could receive a 
new position after the establishment of a new 
Palestinian government.  Jerusalem Post quoted sources 
close to Abbas as saying that at least six PA ministers 
would lose their job in the Palestinian government 
reshuffling.   Nagi al-Ghatrifi, deputy chairman of 
Egypt\'s Al-Ghad Party, was quoted as saying in an 
interview with Jerusalem Post that Sunday\'s election 
was the jolt that the totalitarian political systems of 
the rest of the Arab world needed. 
 
Israel Radio reported that this morning an Israeli was 
killed and three IDF soldiers were wounded in an 
explosion near the southern Gaza Strip settlement of 
Morag.  Qassam rockets have been fired at Israeli 
targets in the Gaza Strip.  All media reported that an 
Israeli who was wounded by a shell at the Erez Crossing 
10 days ago died of his wounds.  Israel Radio reported 
that this morning IAF helicopters fired at targets in 
the south of Gaza City.  The radio also reported that 
IDF troops killed two wanted Hamas men in a clash near 
Ramallah, and that security forces made arrests in the 
West Bank. 
Yediot and Israel Radio reported that the defense 
establishment has finalized its settlement evacuation 
plans.  Yediot says that the project will be approved 
at Sharon\'s office on Thursday.  Yediot reported that, 
at the conclusion of the plan\'s implementation in the 
Katif Bloc, the settlers\' houses will be buried under 
sand.  Ha\'aretz cited recommendations submitted to the 
GOI by the IDF, according to which the IDF is planning 
to maintain a mobile presence in the areas of the four 
settlements to be evacuated from the northern West 
Bank.  The newspaper also quoted Col. Uzi Buchbinder, a 
Home Front Command official as saying Tuesday that 46 
communities in the western Negev will be exposed to 
Qassam rocket fire after the disengagement plan is 
implemented.  Jerusalem Post reported that on Tuesday, 
experts told the Knesset\'s Interior Committee that 
strategic energy facilities in Ashkelon and water 
supplies in northern Israel could be in danger if the 
disengagement plan is carried out. 
 
Maariv reported that incoming Interior Minster Ophir 
Pines-Paz (Labor) has decided to dry up the settlers\' 
anti-disengagement PR campaign, whose cost thus far has 
been estimated at USD 7 million.  Following a petition 
to the High Court of Justice by Peace Now Secretary- 
General Yariv Oppenheimer, Pines-Paz will enforce the 
ban on fund transfers from the local councils. 
Ha\'aretz quoted O/C Northern Command Maj. Gen. Benny 
Ganz as saying Tuesday that the wave of threats from 
pro-settlement elements to refuse to obey army orders 
to evacuate settlements \"is more dangerous than any 
flying rocket.\" 
 
Israel Radio reported that Israel has asked the U.S. 
administration and Congress to help it set up new 
border crossings to the PA, and to improve existing 
crossings. The station quoted Washington sources as 
saying that the cost of the plan is USD 450 million, 
and that Israel is asking the U.S. to participate with 
USD 180 million.  The radio also reported that the U.S. 
is preparing a new aid package for the Palestinians, in 
the sum of USD 200 million, to bolster Abu Mazen.  This 
aid comes on top of a similar sum that the U.S. is 
transferring to the Palestinians, by means of the UN 
and other organizations. 
 
Citing AP, Maariv reported that Israel has returned 
parts of repaired Harpy drones to China -- after the 
U.S. expressed concerns over the matter. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Tuesday UN Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan forwarded a letter to the UNGA setting out a 
framework and the next moves for the creation of a UN 
register of the damage Israel\'s construction of a 
separation barrier is causing Palestinians in the 
occupied West Bank.  The UNGA called for the registry 
last summer after demanding that Israel comply with an 
advisory opinion issued by the International Court of 
Justice (ICJ). 
Israel Radio and Ha\'aretz quoted IDF Intelligence chief 
Maj. Gen. Aharon Zeevi-Farkash as saying Tuesday that 
Iran will be capable of enriching uranium in six 
months.  Maariv quoted him as saying that Abbas is weak 
and unpopular, and that he will not fight the 
Palestinian public.  Zeevi was speaking at Haifa 
University. 
 
All media reported that the Haifa District Court is due 
on Wednesday morning to sentence the leaders of the 
radical northern branch of Israel\'s Islamic Movement, 
after they reached a plea bargain agreement with the 
state prosecution.  The Islamic leaders had mainly been 
indicted for contact with a foreign (Iranian) agent and 
abetting Hamas.  Raed Salah, the group\'s leader, will 
be released in six months, and the other defendants in 
a few days.  While citing the prosecution a saying that 
the case represents one of the first actions against 
financing of world terror, Israel Radio cited the 
Islamic Movement as saying that \"the mountain gave 
birth to a molehill.\"  The Shin Bet opposed the deal. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that Israel has reported to the U.S. 
administration on the recent crisis with Russia.  The 
newspaper says that Israel did not ask the U.S. to 
intervene in solving the problem that caused the crisis 
to erupt, even though the U.S. has dealt with this 
matter in the past.  Yediot cited a denial by official 
Israeli sources of a Channel 2-TV report that the 
bilateral crisis was the result of a claim by President 
Vladimir Putin that Israeli elements have assisted and 
funded Viktor Yushchenko\'s election campaign.  Ha\'aretz 
also reported that tension is mounting in Jerusalem 
ahead of Syrian President Bashar Assad\'s visit to 
Moscow, on January 24. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that, three weeks after Israel 
and Syria agreed that Golan Druze could sell their 
apples in Syria, bureaucratic snags are delaying the 
deal. 
 
Israel Radio reported that the UN Security Council 
asked Israel and Hizbullah on Tuesday to respect the 
\"Purple Line\" demarcating the Israeli-Lebanese border. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that an Arabic translation of 
portions of the most extensive planning document ever 
produced in Israel -- the master plan for the year 2020 
-- has been published by the Center of Arab Unity 
Studies in Beirut.  This institution brings together 
intellectuals from the Arab countries with the goal of 
reviving pan-Arabism and addressing \"Zionism and 
imperialism.\" 
Yediot reported that Orly Benny-Davis, a former Israeli 
who resides in South Carolina and is a \"respected 
political activist in the Republican Party,\" will 
arrive in Israel next week to promote the construction 
of a \"third temple.\"  She is prepared to hear any 
suggestion, except blowing up the mosques on the Temple 
Mount. 
 
Ha\'aretz quoted a well-placed official Israeli source 
as saying that the GOI believes that Stanley Fischer\'s 
appointment to the post of governor of the Bank of 
Israel will increase Israel\'s chances of acceptance to 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD). 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that visiting state attorneys 
from U.S. states, in particular Delaware Attorney- 
General Jane Brady, have expressed their admiration for 
Israel\'s state of preparedness against terrorist 
attacks. 
 
Maariv, Jerusalem Post and Hatzofe reported that at a 
news conference Tuesday, President Bush presented the 
new Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, 
who Maariv says is a Jew, and Jerusalem Post \"a rabbi\'s 
son.\" 
 
Ha\'aretz and Jerusalem Post quoted UN Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan as saying Tuesday that he will convene a 
special session of the UNGA on January 24 to mark the 
60th anniversary of the liberation of the extermination 
camps in Europe. Over 110 member nations of the UN have 
already agreed to hold the meeting -- there have only 
been 27 such sessions since the foundation of the UN.

I.  \"Helping the Chick Grow Its Feathers\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Uzi Benziman observed in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (January 12): 
\"Official Jerusalem understands that something happened 
this week: a new government arose in Ramallah and in 
Israel, and in another week a new administration will 
take office in Washington.  And there\'s the rub.  The 
powers that be in Israel are taking into account that 
the second Bush administration will not necessarily be 
identical with the first: neither in its approach to 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, its composition, nor 
the balance of power inside it.  A significant change 
is expected in Bush\'s attitude toward the Palestinians, 
as could already be seen in the president\'s warm 
congratulations to Abu Mazen and the invitation to the 
White House that Bush extended to the new Palestinian 
president.  The U.S. administration will be the power 
supply that sends current to Jerusalem and Ramallah to 
divert the violent conflict to a track of political 
dialogue.  He will demand that Abu Mazen make a major 
change in his government\'s capability for enforcing his 
will on the Palestinian street and foremost on the 
terror organization, and he will demand that Israel 
help Abu Mazen and thus fulfill its part in the 
actualization of the road map.  As things appeared this 
week, Sharon and his new government intend to grab the 
opportunity offered with the election of Abu Mazen and 
not repeat the mistake of the previous government, 
which waited for Abu Mazen the chick to grow its 
feathers.\" 
 
II.  \"An Illegitimate Government\" 
 
Senior columnist Haggai Huberman wrote in nationalist, 
Orthodox Hatzofe (January 12): \"Ariel Sharon has broken 
[a] record.  A Likud-led government -- Sharon\'s -- is 
being supported by the votes of the Left and the Arabs, 
without a Jewish or Zionist majority.  All those who, a 
decade ago, claimed that the Rabin government was 
illegitimate because it didn\'t enjoy a Jewish or 
Zionist majority, cannot evade this contention today 
when we\'re talking about the extreme Left government 
headed by Ariel Sharon -- the government of the 
transfer [of Jews from their homes].\"

                       Summary:

Defense and foreign affairs columnist Amir Oren wrote 
in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"The Foreign 
Ministry ... has been warning in recent weeks about the 
formation of a Sino-Russian axis as a counterweight to 
the American supremacy in the world.\"

\"A Cold Wind Is Blowing\" 
 
Defense and foreign affairs columnist Amir Oren wrote 
in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (January 12): 
\"The Foreign Ministry\'s center for political research, 
the smallest and poorest of Israel\'s intelligence 
branches but perhaps the most sober of all of them in 
its political assessments, has been warning in recent 
weeks about the formation of a Sino-Russian axis as a 
counterweight to the American supremacy in the world, 
which would have a bad influence on Israel\'s strategic 
position.  Such an alliance could rip open a hole in 
the front that has formed against a nuclear Iran.  Bush 
prefers to devote 2005 to political activity, to go 
through two more elections in Iraq (for a constitution 
and the permanent government), and only after 2006 go 
to war against the ayatollahs.  But Sino-Russian 
opposition could speed up Bush\'s military moves.  The 
incoming American foreign policy leadership -- 
Condoleezza Rice, the designated undersecretary Robert 
Zoellick and the designated deputy secretary for 
political affairs Nicolas Barnes, now ambassador to 
NATO -- is considered friendlier to Israel than the 
outgoing trio -- Colin Powell, Richard Armitage and 
Mark Grossman.  That leadership is more aggressive 
toward Iran, more suspicious of Russia and more 
combative toward Syria, against whom the U.S. has 
suspended its tensions for the coming weeks in exchange 
for a promise from Damascus to freeze its aid to the 
opponents of an Iraqi election.  This is all far from 
being a replay of the Cold War, the conflict that had 
so many ramifications for the Israeli-Arab front, but 
there is a searing cold in the air.  It may be 
seasonal, but it could last.\"

                       Summary: 
                       -------- 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
\"Should we not ... be proud that we, a small country, 
have attracted an economist of such global stature?\" 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized: \"The 
opposition to the appointment of a new immigrant to a 
senior position is narrow-minded.\" 
                     Block Quotes: 
                     ------------- 
 
I.  \"Welcome, Stanley Fischer\" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(January 12): \"The choice of Stanley Fischer as the 
eighth governor of the Bank of Israel was not an 
obvious one, nor without risks.  But it was a brave and 
possibly inspired choice, both on the offering and 
accepting ends.... The reaction of some, that this 
choice is a slight against our own qualified economists 
and business leaders, is somewhat small-minded.  Should 
we not instead be proud that we, a small country, have 
attracted an economist of such global stature?  Are we 
not signaling, properly, that our economy is not an 
island, and not just a bystander, but a potential 
competitive player in the global economy?\" 
 
II.  \"Stanley Fischer, One of Our Own\" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized 
(January 12): \"The opposition to the appointment of a 
new immigrant to a senior position is narrow-minded. 
It is as if Israelis are willing to see new immigrants, 
at least in the early days of their integration, only 
as street-cleaners or standing behind the supermarket 
check-out counter, no matter what their profession. 
Opposition to the appointment of a bank governor, 
either from Israel or America, who represents too right- 
wing -- essentially Thatcheresque -- a worldview, could 
be understood.  But as long as the policy of the 
government and the finance minister is such, it is 
impossible to expect the appointment of a governor with 
a different worldview.\"

SUBJECT: (C)  SHARON TO CODELS: KEY TO PROGRESS WITH 
PALESTINIANS IS SECURITY 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for Reasons 1/4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C)   Summary: In separate meetings with Senators Kyl, 
Martinez, Murkowski, Sununu, and Biden, and Congressman Adam 
Smith January 9 and with Senator Kerry January 10, Prime 
Minister Sharon emphasized that progress with Palestinians 
depends fundamentally on whether terrorism, violence and 
incitement stop and whether Palestinians start making a one 
hundred percent effort to uproot terrorist organizations and 
infrastructure.  Sharon made clear he intends to proceed with 
disengagement from Gaza and four settlements in the northern 
West Bank, and said he would coordinate disengagement to the 
extent the Palestinians exercise security responsibility.  On 
Iran, Sharon argued for tougher diplomacy, including 
reference to the UN Security Council and the imposition of 
sanctions so as to pressure Iran to stop its nuclear weapons 
program.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Sharon opened both meetings by thanking the 
Congressional delegations for the strong support the United 
States has provided to Israel and our bilateral strategic 
cooperation.  He said Israel had committed itself to 
facilitating Palestinian elections and had, in fact, taken 
the necessary steps to enhance freedom of movement and 
mobility.  In the January 9 meeting, Sharon noted the 
positive role played by former President Carter in resolving 
some issues related to Palestinian voting in Jerusalem. 
 
3.  (C)  Sharon said that, once Abu Mazen has taken office, 
Israel expects concrete steps on security, without which 
nothing would advance.  Sharon\'s requirements included: 
 
-- A complete cessation of terrorism and violence. 
 
-- One hundred percent effort to prevent terrorism, including 
acting upon intelligence, arresting perpetrators, and 
punishing convicted terrorists. 
 
-- Thorough reform of the Palestinian security services, 
especially the consolidation of the more than a dozen such 
organs into three bodies, as called for in the Tenet and 
Zinni work plans. 
 
-- The collection of illegal weapons and their transfer to a 
third party for removal from the area. 
 
-- The dismantlement of terrorist organizations. 
 
-- The complete cessation of incitement and beginning 
\"education for peace.\" 
 
4.  (C)  Sharon said that these steps by Palestinians will 
open the door to renewed security and intelligence 
cooperation with Israel.  Also, in emphasizing his 
determination to proceed with the disengagement plan, Sharon 
said that Palestinian security actions would pave the way for 
cooperation and coordination on disengagement.  On the other 
hand, Sharon made clear that, without these steps by 
Palestinians, \"nothing will happen here.\" 
 
5.  (C)  Sharon repeated his willingness for \"painful 
compromises\" but said that he will not compromise on the 
issue of Israeli security or the security of Israeli 
citizens.  \"There will be no compromises now or in the future 
on these issues.\"  Sharon also warned against any attempts to 
apply pressure on Israel to compromise on what Israel 
determines to be its security requirements.  He said it is 
his historic responsibility to provide security to Israelis 
and he will not be pushed into compromises on this. 
 
6.  (C)  Sharon said he is ready to meet with Abu Mazen and 
that security will be at the top of the Israeli agenda. 
Sharon plans to tell Abu Mazen that it is absolutely critical 
that Israel\'s withdrawal from Gaza not take place under fire. 
 Sharon promised a \"very hard reaction\" if Palestinian groups 
attack or fire on the Israeli convoys evacuating settlers 
from Gaza. 
 
7.  (C)  Sharon said that the Israelis and Palestinians are 
not currently working on the roadmap but that disengagement 
could pave the way to return to the roadmap.  In this regard, 
as Israel disengages, Palestinians must take steps that 
create the opportunity to return to the roadmap following 
disengagement. 
 
8.  (C)  Asked about Israel\'s relations with Jordan and 
Egypt, Sharon said Israel enjoys \"close strategic relations\" 
with Jordan, but a \"cool peace\" with Egypt.  In both cases, 
relations between governments have not been matched by 
relations between peoples.  Unions and popular organizations 
in both countries continue to boycott Israel.  Sharon said he 
does not foresee real peace with the Arab world until the 
Arabs \"recognize the birthright of the Jewish people to an 
independent Jewish state in the cradle of Jewish 
civilization.\"  He said that he maintains contact with 
President Mubarak and King Abdullah and noted that relations 
with Egypt have been improving in the past few months, noting 
in particular the importance of Egypt\'s having released Azzam 
Azzam. 
 
9.  (C)  Asked about Palestinian economic prospects, Sharon 
said it is important that there be investment in the 
Palestinian economy in order to produce jobs.  He warned, 
however, against providing money directly to the Palestinian 
Authority until the donors are sure that the money would not 
be channeled into uses other than those specified.  Sharon 
said that Palestinians need several mega-projects which 
should absorb much of the aid of the donors such as power 
stations, water desalination, infrastructure, a seaport and 
an airport.  Sharon also called for donor support for the 
construction of housing for refugees currently in camps in 
the West Bank and Gaza. 
 
10.  (C)  Sharon said that he recognizes Palestinians are 
likely to try to arrange a ceasefire, but he stressed that 
Israel will not be a party to any ceasefire.  Rather, Israel 
will respond to quiet with quiet.  Until now, Sharon said, 
Palestinians have not taken any measures against terrorism, 
despite the fact that 30,000 Palestinian security personnel 
in Gaza have been untouched by the Intifada.  Sharon assessed 
that Palestinians are capable of taking steps, such as 
preventing Qassam rocket attacks, but they need to deploy and 
take action.  Sharon advised the Congressional 
representatives not to be misled by the apparent reduction in 
Palestinian terrorism.  He said there are constant attempts 
by Palestinians to conduct terrorism, but increasing Israeli 
capabilities have had more success in stopping the terrorism 
before it can succeed. 
 
11.  (C)  Sharon lamented what he termed 120 years of lost 
opportunities by Palestinians to end the conflict with 
Israel.  He said the dispute between Israelis and 
Palestinians did not start with Israel\'s occupation of the 
West Bank and Gaza.  Palestinians now have another chance to 
make peace.  By the end of 2005, there will be no Israeli 
\"villages or towns\" (i.e. settlements) in Gaza, and four 
settlements will also be removed from the West  Bank.  If 
Palestinians do their part on security, Israel and the 
Palestinians can return to the roadmap.  A final settlement 
might take a few years, but it can be achieved.  Sharon said 
it was \"not clever\" to fix a timetable for such progress, 
since many timetables were announced previously to no avail. 
Asked whether he had a broader vision of peace, Sharon said 
that the vision of peace is the same as stated by President 
Bush and incorporated in the roadmap.  If the Palestinians do 
the necessary steps, they can achieve a provisional state, 
and then negotiations could begin on final status. 
 
12.  (C)  Asked about settlements, Sharon\'s aide, Dov 
Weissglas, said that the issue of settlements is not being 
dealt with now, and will await final status negotiations.  He 
continued that no land is being taken by Israel for new 
settlements, and that construction is only taking place 
within the lines of built-up areas inside the settlements. 
Weissglas said \"one hundred\" outposts had already been 
removed and that action would soon be taken on the remainder. 
 Sharon commented that building continues within some 
settlements because \"they have many children.\"  He said 
Israel will continue to build within the settlements until 
the final status negotiations.  Sharon noted that the removal 
of outposts, which he promised to President Bush, would 
continue but that it was very hard to accomplish. 
 
13.  (C)  Asked whether Israel would seek U.S. assistance for 
Gaza disengagement, Weissglas said there have been \"initial 
contacts\" with the Administration but no sums have been 
discussed.  Sharon noted that President Bush had committed to 
help support the Palestinians and Israel.  He summoned the 
Director General of the Prime Ministry, Ilan Cohen, who said 
that the cost to Israel for security issues related to 
disengagement is estimated to be NIS 2-2.5 billion 
(approximately 450-550 million dollars).  The cost to Israel 
for civilian issues of disengagement, such as settler 
compensation and relocation, is estimated to be NIS 3 billion 
(approximately 670 million dollars). 
 
14.  (C)  On Iran, Sharon said that he intends to warn Abu 
Mazen that the greatest danger to Palestinians comes from 
Iran, Syria and Hizbollah, not Israel.  Hizbollah, with 
Iranian support, has been active in Gaza smuggling. 
Hizbollah has also made inroads in directing and financing 
terrorism in the West Bank.  The other danger from Iran is 
its intention to build a nuclear weapons program, coupled 
with missiles that can reach Israel, Europe and Russia.  The 
Iranians have stated publicly their intention to destroy the 
State of Israel and yet no one reacts to those statements. 
Sharon said he wants diplomacy to succeed, but said that the 
Iranian issue must be referred to the United Nations Security 
Council and that sanctions must be imposed, such as a ban on 
Iranian flights, an embargo of Iranian oil, and the like. 
Sharon said he fears that the Europeans, even those countries 
that are leading the negotiations with Iran, have more or 
less accepted that Iran will become a member of the \"nuclear 
club.\"  He said Europe appears \"tired\" and does not show any 
real determination to act.  Sharon was asked whether their 
was a military option against Iran if diplomacy did not work. 
 Sharon responded that Israel\'s 1981 attack on Iraq had 
postponed Iraq\'s nuclear capability for many years.  He said 
Israel knows where the Iranian program is being worked but 
repeated that nothing should be done until the Iranians had 
reached \"the point of no return.\" 
 
15.  (C)  Sharon told the visiting delegations that Syria 
remains a \"center of terror.\"  Terrorists headquarters are 
located in Damascus, there are training bases, orders to 
commit acts of terrorism emanate from Syria, and weapons are 
smuggled from Syria to terrorists.  Sharon said that Syria 
has allowed Iranian revolutionary guards into Lebanon, does 
not allow the Lebanese Army to deploy to the border, and has 
now become a training and logistics center for terrorists 
operating in Iraq.  Sharon claimed that Syrian statements of 
readiness to negotiate with Israel are designed to reduce 
pressure on Syria to change its policies in these other 
areas.  While he is ready to negotiate with every Arab 
country, Sharon said he has not seen the slightest sign from 
Syria of their intention to negotiate seriously, and thus 
does not see why Israel should help Syria escape U.S. and 
international pressure. 
 
16. (U)  The CoDels did not clear this message.

TAGS: PGOV, KPAL, KWBG, IS, ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS 
SUBJECT: MINISTER SHARANSKY: PA ELECTIONS A GOOD START, BUT 
PALESTINIANS NEED INDEPENDENT MIDDLE CLASS 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Minister Natan Sharansky told the Ambassador 
January 10 that the Palestinian elections were important in 
that they have led to new leadership and opportunities.  He 
added, however, that he could not refer to the elections as 
\"free or democratic\" given the \"fear\" that exists in 
Palestinian society.  Sharansky referred to his November 11 
meeting with President Bush, and noted that the President and 
he had agreed that peace would come from promoting democracy 
in the region.  Sharansky opined that newly-elected PA 
President Abu Mazen should be strengthened, but complained 
that Abu Mazen has done little to curb incitement against 
Israel.  The Ambassador underscored that the PA and Israel 
each have responsibilities to undertake in order to advance 
the peace process.  Among them, he noted, is for the PA to 
strengthen the rule of law on the street and for Israel to 
curb provocation and violence by extremist settlers. 
 
2.  (U) Summary cont\'d: Sharansky, an opponent of 
disengagement, who is not a Knesset member, noted to the 
Ambassador that Likud\'s Central Committee agreed January 6 to 
the merger of his Yisrael B\'Aliya party with Likud, which 
would add what Sharansky said are 128 disengagement opponents 
to the Likud Central Committee.  The Yisrael B\'Aliya Central 
Committee will vote on the merger on or about January 16. 
Minister Sharansky was accompanied by his advisor, Aryeh 
Green.  End summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Elections Are a Start 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Minister-Without-Portfolio Natan Sharansky used his 
new book, \"The Case for Democracy: The Power of Freedom to 
Overcome Tyranny and Terror\" as a backdrop to his January 10 
meeting with the Ambassador, stressing the importance of 
supporting democracy, including in Iraq, in order to promote 
peace in the region.  Sharansky referred to his November 11 
meeting with President Bush, noting with pleasure that 
President Bush told him that his book provides the 
theoretical basis for many of the President\'s instincts. 
Sharansky noted that while he does not believe the January 9 
PA elections were \"free and democratic\" because of the \"fear\" 
that exists in Palestinian society, he believes the elections 
were a good start, in that they resulted in a new leadership 
that can now advance democracy.  The Palestinians, he 
underlined, \"have a very good chance of developing a 
democracy since they have an educated middle class.\" 
Sharansky stressed the importance of nurturing an independent 
Palestinian middle class, and of breaking the economic 
\"monopoly\" of three or four Palestinian families.  While he 
complained that newly-elected PA president Abu Mazen has not 
done enough to curb Palestinian religious incitement against 
Israel, Sharansky underlined that Abu Mazen should be 
strengthened. 
 
4.  (C)  The Ambassador noted that participants in the recent 
Oslo donors meeting voiced their willingness to provide 
substantial assistance to the PA with the condition that this 
assistance be tied to reform.  He said that Palestinians have 
responsibilities to fulfill in order to move the peace 
process forward, including instituting judicial reform, 
installing an effective police force and removing weapons 
from the street.  The Ambassador said that Israel also has 
responsibilities in the process, such as curbing provocations 
and violence by extremist settlers.  As an example, the 
Ambassador noted that the GOI could prevent incidents such as 
that where settlers attacked members of an NGO who were 
helping Palestinian residents tend to their olive groves. 
Sharansky said he was not aware of these attacks, and asked 
his advisor, Aryeh Green, to provide him with more 
information. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Sharansky Adds Support to Anti-Disengagement Likudniks 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Sharansky highlighed the January 6 Likud Central 
Committee decision to approve the merger of Sharansky\'s 
Russian immigrant-based Yisrael b\'Aliya Party with Likud. 
The merger, Sharansky noted, adds 128 anti-disengagement 
members to Likud\'s Central Committee.

SUBJECT:  2005 Budget Passes First Reading 
 
 
This cable is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The Knesset approved on January 12 the first 
reading of the 2005 Budget and the 2005 Arrangements Bill by 
a vote of 64 in favor to 53 against.  The vote included a 
number of surprises: Likud party rebels who are vehemently 
opposed to disengagement and threatened to deep six the 
budget vote to show their bloc\'s power voted with the rest 
of their party colleagues to pass the bills.  They were 
joined by Sharon\'s new coalition partners, the Labor Party 
(excluding Amir Peretz\'s Am Echad faction) and United Torah 
Judaism.  Opposition to the bill included Shinui, which , 
until leaving the government, had been one of the strongest 
supporters of the GOI\'s economic policies.  While the anti- 
disengagement Likud MKs known as the rebels have already 
raised the prospect of voting against the budget in its 
second and third readings, today\'s first passage now gives 
Sharon the room to move forward on disengagement. 
 
2.  (U) The Budget and Arrangements Bill will now move to 
the Finance Committee and to other Knesset committees for 
further review and discussion.  The Budget must be passed in 
second and third readings by March 31 or new elections must 
be called.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
NIS 1 Billion Lure Nets 
The Required Votes 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) The 2005 Budget, which totals NIS 264.5 billion 
(USD 59 billion), is essentially the same budget rejected by 
the Knesset in early December, but with additional earmarks 
demanded by the Labor and UTJ parties as a condition for 
joining the Government.  Press reports estimate that Labor\'s 
fiscal demands totaled between NIS 600 million and NIS 700 
million, whereas United Torah Judaism\'s demands stood at NIS 
290 million.  Finance Ministry contacts maintain that the 
new budget maintains the expenditure framework agreed upon 
by the previous coalition. 
 
------------------------------ 
The GOI\'s 2005 Economic Agenda 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (U) In his speeches before the vote, Netanyahu described 
2003 as a year in which Israel\'s economic freefall was 
slowed and 2004 as a return to growth.  The objective for 
2005 is to strengthen growth.  Netanyahu stressed continuing 
tax reduction, restricting increases in government 
expenditures (to 1%), and limiting the 2005 budget deficit 
to 3.4%, including disengagement. 
 
5. (U) Beyond fiscal initiatives, Netanyahu referred to his 
objectives for 2005 of implementing the Bachar capital 
market and banking reforms as well as port reforms.  He 
raised GOI plans for the privatizations of Bank Leumi and 
Discount Bank, as well as of the oil refineries.  Other 
economic policies that the Finance Minister said the 
Government intends to execute include education reforms, 
implementation of the Wisconsin Plan to bring more long-term 
unemployed into the job market, electricity reforms, and a 
new investment encouragement law.

SUBJECT: HAMAS \"THE LEAST OF WORRIES\" ACCORDING TO ABU 
MAZEN\'S TEAM IN GAZA 
 
 
Classified By: A/DCM Norm Olsen, per 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
This message has been coordinated with ConGen Jerusalem. 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Senior Abu Mazen confidants in the Gaza 
Strip Marwan Kanafani, Marwan Abdul-Hamid, and Abdullah 
Effrangi told Poloff January 11 that Abu Mazen is determined 
to bring the numerous militant splinter groups \"back into the 
Fatah fold,\" but, to do so, must first provide both physical 
security from Israeli attacks and the financial security of 
alternative employment.  Senior Hamas leaders in Gaza have 
apparently walked back from January 10-11 public statements 
casting doubt upon the legitimacy of Abu Mazen\'s mandate, 
according to PLC Political Committee Chairman Marwan 
Kanafani.  Kanafani and others further categorized dealing 
with Hamas as a lower priority than successfully 
reintegrating the Fatah militias.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
\"When We say Fatah Now, We Mean Abu Mazen\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) Fatah Revolutionary Council member Marwan Abdul-Hamid 
was ebullient in a conversation with Poloff January 11, 
boasting that \"when we say Fatah now, we mean Abu Mazen.\" 
Everyone participated in the elections, Abdul-Hamid crowed, 
even some Hamas members.  The goal of Abu Mazen supporters 
now, he continued, is to strengthen what he called the Abu 
Mazen stream within Fatah in the run-up to the PLC elections, 
now scheduled for July 17. 
 
3.  (C) PLC Political Committee chairman Marwan Kanafani told 
Poloff January 11 that the Gaza political leadership is 
meeting to assess a situation that Kanafani described as 
\"going in the right direction for the first time in years.\" 
Citing what he called a new willingness to cooperate among 
fractious political factions, Kanafani said that expectations 
of Abu Mazen are so high that Kanafani worries about the 
performance of the new government and how it could possibly 
meet them.  Abu Mazen \"has six months, at most\" to deliver, 
according to Kanafani, and will need to prioritize what has 
to be done. 
 
---------------------------------- 
\"Hamas is the Least of My Worries\" 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) When asked about the January 11 statements from the 
Hamas spokesman and other Hamas leaders in Gaza that 
questioned the legitimacy of Abu Mazen\'s mandate because of 
claimed low voter turnout, Kanafani said bluntly that \"Hamas 
is the least of my concerns.\" (Note: The charge of less than 
50 percent turnout is only applicable if the turnout is 
calculated from the out-of-date civil registry. 
International observers and the CEC, however, determined 
voter turnout at 71 percent based on the recently compiled 
voter registration list.  End Note).  Kanafani said the he 
met January 11 with senior Hamas members who wished to 
\"clarify\" that it had not been the organization\'s intention 
to call into question the legitimacy of Abu Mazen\'s electoral 
victory.  Rather, the statements were intended simply as a 
\"reminder\" to Abu Mazen that he should hold a national 
referendum before deciding major issues such as resuming 
talks with the Israelis or \"disarming\" the Intifadah. 
Despite down-playing the challenge posed by Hamas, Kanafani 
hastened to add that Abu Mazen intends to meet with Hamas 
leaders when he returns to Gaza after his inauguration.  \"Our 
contacts with Hamas are constant,\" he said. 
 
5.  (C) Abdul-Hamid made a similar point with regard to the 
Hamas statements, stressing that the true spokesman of Hamas, 
Khaled Misha\'el in Damascus, called Abu Mazen personally 
January 10 to congratulate him on his victory.  Abdul-Hamid 
dismissed Hamas \"mutterings\" in the Gaza Strip as an effort 
to \"remind people they are still here.\"  Abu Mazen has loudly 
and bravely condemned the rocket attacks in the Gaza Strip, 
he said, despite warnings from some advisors that this 
position would cost him votes.  Instead, the opposite proved 
to be true, Abdul-Hamid claimed, and people who had been 
afraid to criticize militant activity rallied to Abu Mazen 
for having the courage to say the previously unspeakable and 
cast their vote accordingly.  People in Gaza, according to 
Abdul-Hamid, are almost begging Abu Mazen to \"save them from 
Hamas\'s chaotic policies.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Fatah\'s Militant Splinters Looking for Security 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6.  (C) Abdul-Hamid confidently stated that \"all\" Fatah 
militants are also Abu Mazen supporters, implying that they 
will obey orders intended to increase Israel\'s security and 
thus reduce the subsequent need for IDF operations in Gaza. 
When pressed, however, Abdul-Hamid admitted that Abu Mazen is 
expected to deliver something in return to the Fatah 
faithful.  What they are looking for, according to 
Abdul-Hamid, are security from targeted Israeli attacks, 
assassinations and arrest operations, and a decent future 
(read: jobs).  Abu Mazen urgently needs to reach an agreement 
with the Israelis to stop \"hunting\" the militants, said 
Abdul-Hamid, who urged the U.S. to press Israel on this 
point.  Then, Abdul-Hamid continued, Abu Mazen must find a 
way to \"absorb\" the militants, most likely into the various 
security bodies, so that they can have an income that allows 
them to provide for their families.  Abu Mazen needs help, 
Abdul-Hamid said, and lots of it -- soon. 
 
7.  (C) Fatah Central Committee member Abdullah Effrangi 
recently told Poloff that Abu Mazen had made serious efforts 
to reach out to Fatah\'s militant splinter groups during his 
pre-election campaign swing through the Gaza Strip (Note: 
Indeed, Abu Mazen boasted to visiting Senator John Kerry on 
January 10 that he had met with all the al-Aqsa Martyrs\' 
Brigades leaders, \"from southern Gaza to the northern West 
Bank.\"  End Note).  Despite the difficulty of bringing his 
message home when delivering it from amid the rubble of 
destroyed houses in, for example, Khan Yunis, Abu Mazen will, 
according to Effrangi, continue to work the issue with all of 
the militant factions because it is essential to bring the 
fighters back \"inside\" mainstream Fatah.  It is simply too 
dangerous for Palestinian society not to do so.  After 
attending a number of campaign rallies, Effrangi said that he 
is confident that Abu Mazen\'s message is being received and 
that fighters are, indeed, \"willing to come back\" into the 
Fatah fold.  The Fatah leadership, he concluded, has 
determined that it must give these men a chance and is now 
looking for ways to reincorporate them into official 
structures.  While Effrangi felt that it was easiest to 
funnel the fighters into the security organizations, he did 
not rule out finding them jobs elsewhere.

1.  Proposed Russia-Syria Arms Deal 
 
2.  Mideast 
 
3.  Iraq 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha\'aretz and Maariv led with, and all media extensively 
reported on, Israel\'s concerns that a planned Russian 
weapons sale to Syria could reach Hizbullah and 
Palestinian terror groups.  The deal includes advanced 
shoulder-held anti-aircraft SA-18 missiles; some media 
say it also includes ground-to-ground \"Iskander E\" 
missiles -- an advanced, precise version of the Scud. 
Israel Radio cited IDF sources as saying that the 
Israel Air Force knows how to cope with anti-aircraft 
missiles; on the other hand, Ha\'aretz quoted Uzi Rubin, 
a former head of the Homa missile defense project in 
the Defense Ministry, as saying before the Knesset\'s 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, that Iskander E 
missiles could tip the power balance in favor of Syria, 
and that they pose a threat to American forces in Iraq 
as well (Rubin also cited the threat posed to Israel 
and the U.S. forces in Iraq by Iran\'s Shihab 4 missile, 
which is currently under development).  Maariv and 
Israel Radio reported that PM Sharon has written to 
President Vladimir Putin, asking him not to put Israel 
at risk.  The media reported that Israel has recalled 
its ambassador from Moscow, perhaps for consultations. 
Yediot quoted Russia\'s Deputy FM Alexander Saltanov, 
who met last week with FM Silvan Shalom and Shimon 
Peres, as saying: \"Russia will take Israel\'s interests 
into account.\"  Leading media reported that Wednesday 
the State Department expressed strong opposition to the 
deal, and that it hinted at threats of sanctions on 
Syria should the deal take place.  Spokesman Richard 
Boucher said Washington is against the sale of deadly 
military equipment to Syria, which is a \"state sponsor 
of terrorism.\"  Incidentally, several media quoted 
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov as saying that 
the U.S. and Russia may be close to signing an 
agreement to help control the trafficking of shoulder- 
fired aircraft missiles, a weapon highly prized by 
terrorists. 
 
Jerusalem Post reported that Israeli officials are 
expected to tell visiting EU foreign policy chief 
Javier Solana today that Israel will not begin 
diplomatic negotiations with the PA simply because 
Abbas was elected PA chairman. 
 
Israel Radio reported from Washington that the U.S. 
administration intends to deepen its involvement in the 
region and that it is considering naming either a 
permanent envoy to the Middle East, who would be 
secretary of state-designate Condoleezza Rice\'s direct 
 
SIPDIS 
subordinate and reside in the region, or a State 
Department coordinator who would exclusively devote his 
work to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Citing 
recent pressure by European and Arab officials on the 
U.S. to alter its strategy -- they reportedly told the 
U.S. administration that otherwise PA Chairman Mahmoud 
Abbas (Abu Mazen) would resign and a civil war erupt in 
the territories -- Ha\'aretz (English Ed.) also mentions 
the possibility of President Bush appointing a 
presidential envoy in the Middle East, saying that 
former secretary of state James Baker is the preferred 
candidate for the position; the newspaper also brings 
the name of former U.S. representative to the UN John 
Davenport (sic: read Danforth).  The radio reported 
that PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Sharon 
could be invited separately to the White House in 
March. 
 
Ha\'aretz (Aluf Benn) reported that the Israel-U.S. 
dispute concerning the Harpy drones Israel sold to 
China is on the verge of resolution. 
 
Jerusalem Post writes that right-wing activist leaders 
told the newspaper that radical elements in the anti- 
disengagement camp have \"agents\" in the security forces 
helping them in their struggle. 
 
Yediot and Jerusalem Post highlighted the \"heavy price\" 
Sharon is willing to pay to add Shas to his government 
coalition -- 1 billion shekels (around USD 230 million) 
for social welfare in exchange for support of the 
disengagement plan. 
 
Rashid Abu Shabak, the commander of the PA\'s 
Preventative Security in the Gaza Strip, was quoted as 
saying in an interview with Maariv that the PA will do 
everything to prevent violence.  Jerusalem Post 
reported that the independent Gaza newspaper Donia Al- 
Watan on Wednesday published a story about a civil 
lawsuit filed by a local resident against PA Foreign 
Minister Nabil Shaath over alleged corruption. 
 
The media reported that the Haifa Magistrate\'s Court on 
Wednesday sentenced Sheikh Raed Salah, the leader of 
the northern branch of the Islamic Movement, to three 
and a half years in prison for security offenses. 
Salah was also slapped with a three-year suspended 
sentence.  Jerusalem Post quoted Salah as saying that 
Israel would last less than 20 years if another group 
of Israeli Arabs was \"unjustly\" arrested and put on 
trial as his group had allegedly been. 
 
Leading media reported that on Wednesday, the High 
Court of Justice ordered to release Staff Sergeant 
Yossi Pilant, a resident of the settlement of Yitzhar, 
who was sentenced to 28 days in military jail for 
calling on soldiers to refuse to serve orders to 
evacuate two caravans in his settlement.  The High 
Court said that the military court\'s sentence was 
flawed, and that the IDF was entitled to put Pilant on 
trial a second time. 
 
Under the headline, \"Carter Presents: Hypocrisy,\" 
Yediot reported that while Sharon and Shalom received 
former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, who headed the 
international Palestinian election monitoring team, 
Carter told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a 
\"harsh interview\" that Sharon is opposed to the road 
map. 
 
Ha\'aretz cited the Amman registration center for the 
January 30 parliamentary elections in Iraq as saying 
Thursday that Israelis of Iraqi origin may take part in 
the voting.  The newspaper quoted Shlomo Hillel, former 
Knesset speaker and winner of the Israel Prize for his 
activity on behalf of Iraq\'s Jews, as saying Wednesday 
that if former Iraqis living in Israel may vote in the 
elections, \"it would be a very significant step 
signaling Iraq\'s willingness to change direction.\" 
Conversely, Ha\'aretz quoted National Infrastructure 
Minister and former defense minister Binyamin Ben- 
Eliezer, who immigrated to Israel from Iraq at age 12, 
as saying that he does not believe Israelis will vote 
\"because anyone who sees Israel as his country will not 
vote in the Iraqi elections.\" 
 
Yediot reported that incoming Interior Minister Ophir 
Pines-Paz has instructed that the question about 
religion in the form distributed to all tourists 
entering Israel be removed. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported the Foreign Ministry will set up a 
department to fight anti-Semitism and to commemorate 
the Holocaust.

I.  \"Washington Has the Key to Defusing the Crisis\" 
 
Defense and foreign affairs columnist Amir Oren wrote 
in independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (January 13): 
\"The key to the limitation of the Russian-Syrian 
missile deal is to be found in Washington.  U.S. 
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who hosted his 
Russian counterpart Sergey Ivanov on Tuesday, talked 
with him about the Russian commitment to avoid 
disseminating anti-aircraft shoulder-fired missiles, 
which could reach terrorists seeking to down civilian 
airliners.  At a joint press conference, Ivanov said 
that the Russians had completed their version of a 
draft of a treaty providing for the mutual transfer of 
information about such missiles (MANPADs).... Ivanov 
stressed that scrupulous supervision and that the 
signing of the treaty can be expected soon....  Despite 
the fact that Ivanov\'s announcement was released even 
before the deal with Syria became known, it matches the 
Russian will to minimize Israel\'s concern about the 
trickling of ground-to-air missiles to terrorist 
elements in Lebanon and the territories.\" 
 
II.  \"Russian Crisis\" 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever 
Plotker wrote in an editorial of mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (January 13): \"Something bad 
is happening in Russia. The behavior of its president, 
Vladimir Putin, has been incomprehensible of late, 
contradictory and illogical.... Now, the renewal of 
arms deals between Russia and Syria, a small and poor 
Arab country, which angers the U.S. and which gives 
support and immunity to terror organizations has been 
added to the dismal picture.  What are the Russian arms 
dealers seeking there?  The main factor behind all 
these strange developments is the situation in 
Chechnya.  The Putin administration is not only unable 
to stabilize the pro-Russian government there, it 
stands exposed and powerless in face of the anticipated 
wave of murderous terror attacks.  The failure in 
Chechnya, along with the deaths of tens of thousands of 
civilians and soldiers, has undermined the balance of 
the Russian leadership; it has raised to the surface 
dark political forces and is sowing a storm of 
irrationality in the Kremlin.  A Russian crisis is 
developing, which constitutes a real danger to the 
stability of the entire world.\" 
 
III.  \"Pressure\" 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one 
of popular, pluralist Maariv (January 13): \"If the 
[Russian-Syrian arms] deal really goes through in the 
end, the IDF will have to rethink fundamental 
assumptions that no longer apply.  It is already 
impossible to fly freely over the Gaza Strip, and soon 
it will be impossible to fly freely over Lebanon, 
Syria, the northern border.  Army intelligence will 
have to work hard in order to spot the tiny missiles 
being removed from their vehicles (the Russians will 
sell the Syrians the motorized version), turning into 
their miniature version and somehow getting into 
Nasrallah\'s hands.  And then, anything is possible.  It 
looks like we will learn to live with that, too.  [But, 
as the Israeli leadership sees it,] the main thing is 
that we do not surrender to Assad\'s peace maneuvers and 
negotiation spins.\"

Prof. Uzi Arad, who was a senior strategic advisor to 
former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, wrote in

American expectations is ... a clear-cut Israeli 
interest.\"

\"No Automatic Pilot For Disengagement\" 
 
Prof. Uzi Arad, who was a senior strategic advisor to 
former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, wrote in 
independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz (January 13): \"There 
are those who treat the disengagement as if it is 
operating on \'automatic pilot.\'  However, a pragmatic 
approach requires demonstrating sensitivity to changing 
circumstances, and those who support the plan must take 
action to improve the problematic equation between its 
risks and opportunities.... [Among other conditions,] 
Israel cannot dismiss the American demand, which has 
also been made to the Europeans, to work for deepening 
democracy in Palestinian society.  Fulfilling the 
American expectations is also a clear-cut Israeli 
interest.  It is where to find the long-term answer to 
Palestinian acceptance of the Jewish state and a 
permanent agreement.  But above all, the most important 
thing is to do everything possible to reduce the 
\'democratic deficit\' that has built up in the decision- 
making process toward the disengagement.\"

\"Iraq\'s Slippery Slope\" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Guy Bechor, a lecturer 
at the Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in mass- 
circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (January 13): 
\"The Americans have erred in some strategic decisions 
they made concerning a proud and despondent nation 
[Iraq], which had in the past been the intellectual 
heart of the Arab world.  One of those mistakes was the 
dismantling of the \'Arab Army,\' i.e. the Iraqi army.... 
The \'democratic constitution\' that was dictated to the 
Iraqis has turned into a farce; no community intends to 
carry it out.... It is too bad that Iraq was not 
immediately split into three different countries.... 
Lastly, how were the Americans been so foolish in 
organization those proportional elections?.... It 
surely is too much to expect a country that has always 
been controlled by the fear of the other to immediately 
become a democracy that protects minorities.  Those 
American mistakes are leading Iraq and the region into 
a worrying direction.  The unending wave of terror, the 
looming elections, and the loss of the ability to 
govern, could bring down Iraq in the next few weeks to 
the edge of a civil war.\"
