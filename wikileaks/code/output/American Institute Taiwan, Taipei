SUBJECT: TAIWAN REACTIONS TO THE TIANANMEN MASSACRE 
 
REF: TAIPEI 3626 (NOTAL) 
 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  THE TAIWAN AUTHORITIES HAVE REACTED 
TO THE DRAMATIC JUNE 4 EVENTS IN BEIJING BY MAKING A 
SERIES OF DECLARATIONS.  PRESIDENT LEE ISSUED A 
DENUNCIATION OF THE BLOODY SUPPRESSION OF THE TIANANMEN 
DEMONSTRATORS AND A CALL FOR INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR 
THE PRC DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT.  A SIMILAR RESOLUTION WAS 
ADOPTED BY THE KMT CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S SECOND PLENUM, 
WHICH ABANDONED ITS AGENDA IN FAVOR OF AN ALL-DAY 
DISCUSSION OF MAINLAND POLICY.  FOREIGN MINISTER LIEN 
CHAN CALLED IN AMBASSADORS TO ASK FOR THEIR GOVERN- 
MENTS\' SUPPORT, WHILE THE TAIWAN\'S ARMED FORCES WERE 
PLACED ON ALERT AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.  MONEY IS 
BEING COLLECTED IN SUPPORT OF THE DEMONSTRATORS, AND 
TAIWAN\'S RED CROSS IS ATTEMPTING TO FIND WAYS TO 
DELIVER ASSISTANCE.  MEANWHILE, PREMIER LEE HUAN AND 
OTHERS HAVE DECLARED THAT TAIWAN\'S POLICY OF ALLOWING 
VISITS TO THE MAINLAND WILL NOT CHANGE.  IN THE MIDST 
OF CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PRC, 
SOME VOICES HAVE BEEN RAISED CAUTIONING AGAINST 
TAIWAN\'S TRADE WITH THE MAINLAND, AND WE EXPECT THAT 
THE DETAILS, IF NOT THE OVERALL THRUST, OF TAIWAN\'S 
MAINLAND POLICY WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE 
DEBATE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE STUDENTS\' SUPPRESSION. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  PRESIDENT LI TENG-HUI, IN A STATEMENT TO THE 
KMT CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM JUNE 4, CONDEMNED THE 
ATTACK BY THE PLA ON THE DEMONSTRATORS IN BEIJING.  LI 
SAID THAT THE VIOLENCE IN BEIJING EXPOSES THE CRUELTY 
OF THE COMMUNISTS AND WILL LEAD TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE 
PRC GOVERNMENT.  HE CALLED ON OTHER COUNTRIES TO 
CONDEMN THE COMMUNISTS AND ON OVERSEAS CHINESE TO 
SUPPORT THE DEMONSTRATORS AND OPPOSE THE COMMUNISTS. 
THE PRESIDENT ALSO WARNED OF POSSIBLE COMMUNIST 
MILITARY MOVES AGAINST TAIWAN AND TOLD THE PEOPLE AND 
THE ARMED FORCES TO BE ON THE ALERT.  HE PLEDGED 
CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR RESISTANCE ON THE MAINLAND AND 
STATED THAT THE GOAL OF TAIWAN IS TO \"UNITE ALL ANTI- 
COMMUNIST AND PATRIOTIC FORCES IN THEIR UNTIRING 
EFFORT TO OVERTURN THIS TYRANNY.\" 
 
3.  (U)  THE PRESIDENT\'S STATEMENT WAS ONE OF A 
NUMBER OF DECLARATIONS IN THE WAKE OF THE TIANANMEN 
CRACKDOWN.  THE KMT CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM, MEETING 
YESTERDAY ON THE SECOND DAY OF ITS THREE-DAY SESSION, 
SCRAPPED ITS ORIGINAL SCHEDULE AND DEVOTED THE ENTIRE 
DAY TO A DISCUSSION OF MAINLAND POLICY.  A RESOLUTION 
ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE CONDEMNED 
THE MASSACRE OF THE STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS, DECLARED 
CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM ON THE 
MAINLAND, CALLED FOR LONG-TERM \"MORAL AND MATERIAL 
SUPPORT\" FROM ABROAD FOR THIS GOAL AND URGED STRONG 
INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION AND UNSPECIFIED SANCTIONS 
AGAINST THE PRC.  IT ALSO PLEDGED SUPPORT FOR CHINESE 
COMPATRIOTS STRUGGLING TO COMPEL BEIJING TO GIVE UP 
ITS \"FOUR CARDINAL PRINCIPLES\" AND \"EVENTUALLY 
OVERTURN THE CHINESE COMMUNIST TYRANNY.\" 
 
4.  (C)  MEANWHILE, FOREIGN MINISTER LIEN CHAN MET WITH 
AMBASSADORS ACCREDITED IN TAIPEI FROM SOUTH AFRICA, 
SOUTH KOREA, HAITI, HONDURAS, AND GUATEMALA TO REQUEST 
THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS CONDEMN THE ATTACK 
AND TO DEMAND THAT PRC AUTHORITIES PUNISH THOSE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VIOLENCE.  WHILE THIS MEETING WAS 
PUBLICIZED, THE PARALLEL APPROACH BY PRESIDENT LEE TO 
AIT (REFTEL) HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED IN THE PRESS. 
 
5.  (C)  IN A SEPARATE ACTION, PRESIDENT LEE ORDERED 
THAT TAIWAN\'S ARMED FORCES BE PLACED ON ALERT TO 
GUARD AGAINST ANY ATTACK FROM THE MAINLAND.  ARMED 
FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF HAU PEI-TSUN CONFIRMED THE 
ORDER, TELLING THE PRESS THAT HE SAW NO IMMINENT 
THREAT TO TAIWAN\'S SECURITY BUT WAS CONCERNED THAT 
THE PLA COULD TRY TO MAKE TROUBLE IN ORDER TO DIVERT 
ATTENTION THE PRC\'S INTERNAL DISORDER.  DESPITE 
THE INCREASED ALERT STATUS, AT LEAST ONE HIGH-RANKING 
ADMIRAL WAS STILL ON THE GOLF COURSE SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 
 
6.  (U)  THE DRAMATIC CRACKDOWN IN BEIJING HAS 
IMMEDIATELY RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT TAIWAN\'S POLICY 
TOWARD MAINLAND CONTACTS.  PREMIER LEE HUAN TOLD 
REPORTERS JUNE 4 THAT THE POLICY OF ALLOWING PRIVATE 
VISITS WOULD NOT ONLY CONTINUE, BUT SHOULD BE EXPANDED 
EVEN FURTHER.  VICE PREMIER SHIH CHI-YANG, IN 
CHARGE OF THE CABINET\'S MAINLAND TASK FORCE, LIKEWISE 
STATED THAT CONTACTS WOULD CONTINUE, SINCE THEY SERVED 
THE LONG-TERM PURPOSE OF FOSTERING DEMOCRACY.  TASK 
FORCE SECRETARY MA YING-JEOU FOR HIS PART DECLARED 
THAT TIANANMEN DEVELOPMENTS WOULD NOT AFFECT ONGOING 
EFFORTS TO COMPLETE THE DRAFT REGULATIONS ON CROSS- 
STRAIT CONTACTS. 
 
7.  (U)  OTHER EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO INFLUENCE 
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRC.  THE DLRECTOR-GENERAL OF 
TAIWAN\'S INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT CENTER, 
JOHN NI, ANNOUNCED AT THE KMT PLENUM THE SETTING UP 
OF A FUND TO FINANCE OVERSEAS ADVERTISING DENOUNCING 
THE COMMUNISTS\' ACTIONS AND SOLICITING SUPPORT FOR 
THE PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT.  THE GOAL IS REPORTED TO 
BE A FUND OF USD 100 MILLION OF WHICH US$ 280,000 IS 
SAID SO FAR TO HAVE BEEN RAISED.  THE LOCAL RED CROSS 
SOCIETY WILL OFFER MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND SUPPLIES TO 
THE PRC RED CROSS SOCIETY ACCORDING TO ITS SECRETARY- 
GENERAL.  THIS FOLLOWS A PRESIDENTIAL DECISION, 
REPORTED IN THE CENTRAL DAILY NEWS, THAT ASSISTANCE 
BE OFFERED VIA THE INTER INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO 
THE VICTIMS OF THE TIANANMEN VIOLENCE AND THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
 
8.  (U)  TAIWAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLYMEN, LEGISLATORS, AND 
CONTROL YUAN MEMBERS FROM KMT AND OPPOSITION PARTIES 
CONDEMNED THE ATTACK ON THE PRO-DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATORS. 
COMMENTS INCLUDE CALLS BY KMT ASSEMBLYMEN AND 
SUPPLEMENTAL LEGISLATORS FOR THE TAIWAN AUTHORITIES TO 
GIVE ALL POSSIBLE SUPPORT TO THE PROTESTORS AND TO MAKE 
A CRITICAL REAPPRAISAL OF TAIWAN\'S POLLCY TOWARD THE 
MAINLAND AS WELL AS EXPRESSIONS OF ANGER AND SORROW ON 
THE PART OF OPPOSITION LEGISLATORS AT THE SUPPRESSION 
OF DEMOCRACY ON THE MAINLAND. 
 
9.  (U)  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN CALLS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES, 
INCLUDING THE U.S., TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO PUT 
AN END TO THE BLOODSHED IN BEIJING.  AIT HAS HAD 
SEVERAL PRESS INQUIRIES ABOUT WHAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 
WOULD DO.  IN ADDITION, NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY 
PROFESSOR THOMAS PENG, CLAIMING TO REPRESENT THE 
UNIVERSITY FACULTY ASSOCIATION, CALLED AIT TO ASK 
THAT THE U.S. SPEAK OUT STRONGLY AGAINST THE KILLING 
OF DEMONSTRATORS. 
 
10.  (U)  OTHER REPORTED RESPONSES TO THE ATTACK 
INCLUDE AN EXPRESSION OF SHOCK AND SORROW BY THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC PROGRESSIVE 
PARTY WHO ATTRIBUTED THE VIOLENCE TO THE LACK OF 
TOLERANCE FOR DEMOCRACY ON THE MAINLAND AND A REQUEST 
OF THE CHINA DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY THAT JUNE 4 
BE DECLARED A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR THOSE KILLED IN 
THE ATTACK AND THAT SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS BE AMENDED TO 
RECORD THE EVENT.  A LIST OF ACTIONS REPORTED TO BE 
UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE AUTHORITIES INCLUDE: 
 
--  A TEMPORARY LIFTING OF THE BAN ON DIRECT FAX 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE MAINLAND TO PERMIT MESSAGES 
OF SUPPORT FOR THE DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT TO BE SENT TO 
THE PRC. 
 
--  A PERIOD OF MOURNING FOR THOSE KILLED AT TIANANMEN 
INCLUDING LOWERING THE TAIWAN FLAG TO HALF MAST. 
 
--  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A \"MORE AGGRESSIVE\" 
MAINLAND POLICY IN WHICH TAIWAN AUTHORITIES WILL 
PLAY A \"MORE LEADING ROLE\" IN INFORMING PEOPLE ON 
THE MAINLAND OF TAIWAN\'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL 
DEVELOPMENT. 
 
11.  (C)  COMMENT.  THE KMT\'S EVIDENT DETERMINATION 
TO MAINTAIN ITS OPENING TO THE MAINLAND WAS SIGNALLED 
THE DAY BEFORE THE PLA\'S ACTION IN TIANANMEN WHEN LEE 
TENG-HUI ADDRESSED THE OPENING SESSION OF THE KMT 
SECOND PLENUM.  IN HIS ADDRESS, LEE STATED THAT THE 
EASING OF RESTRICTIONS ON VISITS \"HAS MADE THE PEOPLE 
ON THE CHINESE MAINLAND LONG FOR THE LIFE ON THE 
ISLAND\" AND HAS INCREASED THEIR DOUBTS ABOUT 
COMMUNISM.  CALLS FOR DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM, LEE 
DECLARED, ARE \"ONE INESCAPABLE RESULT OF THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR MAINLAND POLICY.\"  DESPITE THIS, 
THE BLOODSHED IN BEIJING MAY CAUSE THE AUTHORITIES 
TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF TRADE AND 
INVESTMENT IN THE PRC.  LEE HUAN DISTINGUISHED THIS 
FROM THE QUESTION OF CONTINUING VISITS, AND SAID IT 
WOULD HAVE TO BE STUDIED IN LIGHT OF EVENTS.  DEFENSE 
MINISTER CHENG WEI-YUAN IS QUOTED AS CALLING FOR TRADE 
SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PRC, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR 
WHETHER HIS REMARKS WERE INTENDED TO INCLUDE TAIWAN\'S 
OWN TRADE WITH THE MAINLAND.  THE DETAILS OF TAIWAN\'S 
MAINLAND POLICY ARE LIKELY TO BE THE SUBJECT OF INTENSE 
DISCUSSION IN THE DAYS AHEAD.  END COMMENT.

15TH KMT CENTRAL STANDING COMMITTEE ON AUGUST 28 
APPROVED THE APPOINTMENTS OF A SLIGHTLY RESHUFFLED 
CABINET UNDER INCOMING PREMIER VINCENT SIEW.  SIEW AND 
HIS CABINET WERE SWORN IN ON SEPTEMBER 1.  SIEW\'S 
FORTY-MEMBER CABINET INCLUDES 12 INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE 
EITHER NEW FACES ENTIRELY OR HAVE SWITCHED POSITIONS. 
BELOW WE PROVIDE BIO INFORMATION ON THOSE 12 
INDIVIDUALS.  END INTRODUCTION. 
 
 
PREMIER:  VINCENT SIEW 
---------------------- 
 
3. (U)  VINCENT SIEW (HSIAO WAN-CHANG) WAS BORN IN 1939 
IN CHIAYI CITY AND IS MARRIED TO SUSAN CHU.  THEY HAVE 
THREE DAUGHTERS.  SIEW RECEIVED A  BACHELOR OF ARTS AND 
A MASTER\'S DEGREE IN FOREIGN RELATIONS FROM NATIONAL 
CHENGCHI UNIVERSITY, TAIPEI.  (HE GRADUATED FIRST IN 
HIS UNDERGRADUATE CLASS.)  A FORMER MEMBER OF TAIWAN\'S 
FOREIGN SERVICE, SIEW SERVED AS VICE-CONSUL (1968-1969) 
AND CONSUL (1969-1972) IN KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA, AND 
SECTION CHIEF AT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MOFA) 
EAST ASIAN AND PACIFIC AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT (1972). 
 
4.  (C) MOVING TO THE ECONOMIC SPHERE, SIEW THEN SERVED 
AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND SUBSEQUENTLY DIRECTOR OF THE 
FOURTH (BILATERAL) DIVISION OF THE BOARD OF FOREIGN 
TRADE (BOFT) IN  THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS 
(MOEA) (1972-1977).  HE WAS PROMOTED TO DEPUTY 
DIRECTOR-GENERAL AT THE BOFT (1977-1982) AND LATER TO 
DIRECTOR-GENERAL (1982-1988).  IN 1988, HE BECAME VICE- 
CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL FOR ECONOMIC PLANNING AND 
DEVELOPMENT (CEPD), AND, IN 1989, HE WAS MADE DIRECTOR 
OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT OF THE KMT 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  IN 1990, SIEW WAS APPOINTED 
MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS, A POST HE HELD UNTIL 
1994.   IN 1993, HE WAS MADE CONCURRENT CHAIRMAN OF THE 
CEPD.  SIEW\'S PEERS AND SUBORDINATES IN ECONOMIC 
CIRCLES ALL SEE HIM AS SOMEONE WHO ROSE THROUGH THE 
RANKS BECAUSE OF HIS INTELLIGENCE, HIS TECHNICAL 
ABILITY, AND HIS HARD WORK.  OVER YEARS OF DEALING WITH 
U.S. NEGOTIATORS ON MANY THORNY BILATERAL TRADE ISSUES, 
HE EARNED A REPUTATION AS A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR 
ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION. 
 
5.  (U)  IN 1994, SIEW LEFT THESE ECONOMIC POSTS TO 
BECOME CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE YUAN\'S MAINLAND 
AFFAIRS COUNCIL (MAC).  IN 1995, SIEW -- AT THE URGING 
OF PRESIDENT LEE -- STEPPED DOWN FROM THE MAC TO RUN 
FOR THE LEGISLATIVE YUAN (LY) SEAT FROM CHIAYI CITY. 
SIEW DEFEATED THE INCUMBENT DPP CANDIDATE.  WHILE 
SERVING IN THE LY, SIEW MANAGED PRESIDENT LEE\'S 
SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN IN THE MARCH, 1996, PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION. 
 
6.  (C) SIEW HAS PROVEN AN ABLE AND ACTIVE LEGISLATOR, 
WELL-RESPECTED BY HIS PEERS.  HE TOOK THE LEAD IN 
HELPING TO FORM A NON-PARTISAN CAUCUS WITHIN THE LY 
AIMED AT PROMOTING ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION.  THIS 
CAUCUS IN TURN ENSURED LY PASSAGE OF A WHOLE RAFT OF 
NECESSARY ECONOMIC LEGISLATION.  PRESIDENT LEE ALSO 
TURNED TO SIEW TO SPEARHEAD THE RULING PARTY\'S EFFORTS 
AT LAST DECEMBER\'S NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 
(NDC), A MULTI-PARTISAN MEETING WHICH HELPED FORGE 
ISLAND-WIDE CONSENSUS ON ECONOMIC POLICY AND ON CROSS- 
STRAIT RELATIONS.  THE TWO LARGEST PARTIES -- THE KMT 
AND THE DPP -- ALSO REACHED AGREEMENT AT THAT TIME ON 
PROPOSALS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM.  SIEW PLAYED A KEY 
ROLE IN THE INTER-PARTY NEGOTIATIONS THAT ULTIMATELY 
LED TO THE JULY 1997 ADOPTION OF A PACKAGE OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS BASED ON THE NDC AGREEMENTS. 
 
7.  (C) SIEW HAS REPRESENTED TAIWAN AT APEC LEADERS\' 
CONFERENCES, WHERE HE RUBBED ELBOWS WITH PRESIDENTS AND 
PRIME MINISTERS.  NEVERTHELESS, SIEW IS CONSIDERED BY 
MOST PEOPLE HERE TO BE A RELATIVELY HUMBLE MAN.  IN 
CONTRAST TO OUTGOING PREMIER LIEN CHAN, WHOSE FATHER 
WAS A FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER, SIEW COMES FROM MODEST 
ORIGINS: HIS PARENTS WORKED IN THE FIELDS OUTSIDE 
CHIAYI.  PERHAPS TO REINFORCE THIS IMAGE, SIEW\'S STAFF 
ANNOUNCED AS HE WAS TAKING OFFICE THAT THE NEW PREMIER 
WOULD DO WITHOUT THE POLICE ESCORTS THAT HIS 
PREDECESSOR HAD USED, FREQUENTLY TO THE CONSTERNATION 
OF INCENSED DRIVERS WAVED ASIDE BY THE ESCORT.  (SIEW 
REPORTEDLY WAS UPSET THAT HIS STAFF APPEARED TO BE 
TRYING TO MAKE LIEN CHAN LOOK BAD AND TOLD THEM TO PUT 
A LID ON COMMENTS THAT MIGHT PUT A BAD LIGHT ON HIS 
PREDECESSOR -- WHO REMAINS THE VICE PRESIDENT AND 
PRESIDENT LEE\'S HEIR APPARENT WITHIN THE KMT.)  SIEW 
ALSO HAS A REPUTATION FOR PROBITY AND A STRONG GRASP OF 
ECONOMIC ISSUES.  OBSERVERS HERE ATTRIBUTE HIS SUCCESS 
WITHIN BOTH THE BUREAUCRACY AND THE LEGISLATURE TO HIS 
ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE PERSISTENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY 
WITHOUT ALIENATING HIS INTERLOCUTORS. 
 
 
VICE PREMIER:  JOHN CHANG 
------------------------- 
 
8. (U) JOHN H. CHANG (CHANG HSIAO-YEN) WAS BORN IN 1941 
IN JIANGXI PROVINCE OF MAINLAND CHINA.  CHANG RECEIVED 
A BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE FROM SOOCHOW UNIVERSITY, 
TAIPEI, AND STUDIED AT THE BRUSSELS LIBERAL UNIVERSITY, 
1970-1971.  IN 1976, HE EARNED A MASTERS DEGREE FROM 
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY. 
 
9.  (U) CHANG PASSED TAIWAN\'S CIVIL SERVICE EXAM IN 
1968 AND ENTERED THE FOREIGN SERVICE.  AFTER JOINING 
THE FOREIGN SERVICE, HE SERVED AS A STAFF MEMBER OF THE 
MOFA EUROPEAN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT (1971-1972); SECRETARY 
TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER (1972- 
1973); THIRD AND THEN SECOND SECRETARY AT THE \"ROC\" 
EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.(1974-1977); CHIEF OF THE 
FIRST (POLITICAL) SECTION, MOFA NORTH AMERICAN AFFAIRS 
DEPARTMENT (1977-1980); DEPUTY DIRECTOR, MOFA NORTH 
AMERICAN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT (1980-1981); DEPUTY 
SECRETARY-GENERAL, THE COORDINATION COUNCIL FOR NORTH 
AMERICAN AFFAIRS (CCNAA), THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL COVER 
OFFICE FOR TAIWAN\'S UNOFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH THE 
UNITED STATES, 1981; SECRETARY-GENERAL, CCNAA (1981- 
1982); DIRECTOR, MOFA NORTH AMERICAN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT 
(1982-1986); AND ADMINISTRATIVE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER 
(1986-1989).  IN 1989, CHANG LEFT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY 
TO BECOME DIRECTOR, KMT CENTRAL COMMITTEE OVERSEAS 
AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT (1989-1990).  HE RETURNED TO MOFA TO 
SERVE AS POLITICAL VICE FOREIGN MINISTER (1990-1993), 
AND SUBSEQUENTLY WAS NAMED CHAIRMAN OF THE OVERSEAS 
CHINESE AFFAIRS COMMISSION, A CABINET-LEVEL POSITION 
(1993-1996).  CHANG HAS ALSO SERVED AS A MEMBER OF THE 
KMT CENTRAL COMMITTEE SINCE 1988 AND AS A MEMBER OF THE 
KMT CENTRAL STANDING COMMITTEE SINCE 1996.  IN 1996, 
CHANG WAS ELECTED TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA), 
TAIWAN\'S CONSTITUTION-AMENDING BODY.  HE IS MARRIED TO 
HELEN HUANG, AND THEY HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND ONE SON. 
 
10.  (C) ALTHOUGH AN ETHNIC MAINLANDER, CHANG IS WELL- 
LIKED BY ETHNIC TAIWANESE (INCLUDING, REPORTEDLY, 
PRESIDENT LEE).  AN ILLEGITIMATE SON OF THE LATE 
PRESIDENT CHIANG CHING-KUO, CHANG WAS RAISED IN RATHER 
HUMBLE CIRCUMSTANCES -- AMONG ETHNIC TAIWANESE 
PLAYMATES -- OUTSIDE OF TAIPEI.  (HE REPORTEDLY IS AS 
FLUENT IN TAIWANESE AS HE IS IN MANDARIN.)  IN RECENT 
YEARS, CHANG HAS PROVEN LOYAL TO -- AND A VALUABLE 
ASSET FOR -- THE KMT OF LEE TENG-HUI.  DURING THE 1995 
LY ELECTION CAMPAIGN, CHANG CAMPAIGNED VIGOROUSLY FOR 
KMT CANDIDATES IN TAIWAN\'S MAINLANDER-DOMINATED 
MILITARY VILLAGES.  GIVEN THE WIDE RESPECT IN THE 
VILLAGES FOR CHANG, HIS EFFORTS HELPED KEEP THE KMT\'S 
LOSSES THERE TO A MINIMUM.  CHANG ALSO PROVED ONE OF 
THE MOST POPULAR VOTE-GETTERS FOR THE KMT IN THE 1996 
NA ELECTION. 
 
11.  (C) IN LIGHT OF UNRELENTING PRESSURE FROM BEIJING, 
CHANG FACED CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTIES AS FOREIGN 
MINISTER.  SOUTH AFRICA -- THE LAST SIGNIFICANT COUNTRY 
TO MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN -- ANNOUNCED DURING 
HIS WATCH THAT IT WOULD SWITCH ALLEGIANCE TO BEIJING. 
(CHANG AT ONE POINT TERMED THE JOB OF TAIWAN\'S FOREIGN 
MINISTER THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE IN THE WORLD.)  STILL, 
CHANG OBVIOUSLY DID HIS BEST TO IMPLEMENT TAIWAN\'S 
\"PRAGMATIC\" DIPLOMACY:  HE REPEATEDLY VISITED TAIWAN\'S 
FEW REMAINING DIPLOMATIC ALLIES AND ALSO VISITED A 
NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO RAISE 
TAIWAN\'S INTERNATIONAL PROFILE.  THESE ENTHUSIASTIC AND 
WHOLE-HEARTED ATTEMPTS TO PROMOTE \"PRAGMATIC\" DIPLOMACY 
STOOD IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE MORE ALOOF OPERATING 
STYLE OF HIS PREDECESSOR, FRED CHIEN. 
ORGANIZATIONALLY, CHANG\'S TENURE AS FOREIGN MINISTER 
WAS ALSO NOTEWORTHY FOR HIS ATTEMPTS TO BOOST THE 
STATUS OF WOMEN OFFICERS IN TAIWAN\'S FOREIGN SERVICE; 
HE ELIMINATED QUOTAS IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE ENTERING 
CLASSES, THEREBY INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN PER 
CLASS FROM 15 PERCENT TO MORE THAN HALF.  HE ALSO 
APPOINTED TAIWAN\'S FIRST FEMALE AMBASSADOR. (KATHERINE 
CHANG -- THE HEAD OF TECRO\'S SEATTLE OFFICE -- HAS BEEN 
ASSIGNED AS AMBASSADOR TO THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN.) 
 
 
MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  JASON HU 
-------------------------------------- 
 
12. (U)  JASON HU (HU CHIH-CHIANG) WAS BORN IN 1948 IN 
JILIN PROVINCE IN MAINLAND CHINA.  HE RECEIVED AN LL.B. 
IN FOREIGN RELATIONS FROM NATIONAL CHENGCHI UNIVERSITY, 
TAIPEI (1970) AND A MASTER OF SOCIAL SCIENCE FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON (1978) AND A PH. D. FROM 
OXFORD UNIVERSITY (1984).  HE SERVED AS A RESEARCH 
FELLOW AT ST. ANTHONY\'S COLLEGE, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, IN 
1985, AND AS ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR, 
ACADEMIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE, NATIONAL SUN YAT-SEN 
UNIVERSITY, KAOHSIUNG (1986-1990).  HE HAS BEEN 
SECRETARY-GENERAL, \"ROC\" CHAPTER, WORLD LEAGUE FOR 
FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY (1989-1991) AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
OF THE FIRST BUREAU OF THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE AND 
ENGLISH INTERPRETER FOR PRESIDENT LEE TENG-HUI (1991). 
HE SERVED AS GOVERNMENT INFORMATION OFFICE DIRECTOR- 
GENERAL (AND OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN) FROM 1991 TO 1996 AND 
TECRO WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVE (1996-1997).  HE WAS 
ELECTED A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) MEMBER FROM TAICHUNG 
CITY IN 1996, RECEIVING THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES OF 
ANY KMT CANDIDATE IN THE NA ELECTION.  HE HAS ALSO 
SERVED AS A MEMBER OF THE KMT CENTRAL COMMITTEE SINCE 
1993. 
 
13.  (C) AFFABLE AND GREGARIOUS, HU IS WIDELY CREDITED 
HERE WITH HAVING HELPED STABILIZE TAIPEI\'S RELATIONS 
WITH WASHINGTON.  (EVEN THE PRESIDENCY IMPLICITLY 
ADMITS NOW THAT HU\'S PREDECESSOR IN THE POSITION AS 
TECRO WASHINGTON HEAD, BENJAMIN LU, WAS LESS THAN 
SUCCESSFUL IN HANDLING TAIWAN\'S ALL-IMPORTANT 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S.)   HU TAKES ON THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY NOT ONLY WITH A GRASP OF THE U.S. RELATIONSHIP 
BUT ALSO WITH THE GOOD-WILL OF TAIWAN\'S HYPER-ACTIVE 
PRESS AND A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISLAND\'S ELECTED 
POLITICS. 
 
 
MONGOLIAN AND TIBETAN AFFAIRS COMMISSION (MTAC) 
CHAIRMAN: KAO KONG-LIAN 
-----------------------

MAINLAND AFFAIRS COUNCIL (MAC) VICE CHAIRMAN AND 
SPOKESMAN (1991-1997). 
 
15.  (C) AS ONE OF THREE MAC VICE CHAIRMEN, KAO FOCUSED 
HIS EFFORTS MAINLY ON ECONOMIC RELATIONS ACROSS THE 
TAIWAN STRAIT.  WE FOUND HIM A WILLING AND FRANK 
INTERLOCUTOR.  THE MONGOLIAN AND TIBETAN COMMISSION 
(MTAC) IS A CONTROVERSIAL LEFTOVER FROM THE DAYS WHEN 
THE NATIONALISTS CONTROLLED ALL OF MAINLAND CHINA. 
(THE DPP HOLDS THAT THE MTAC IS AN ANACHRONISM THAT 
SHOULD BE SCRAPPED.) 
 
 
MINISTER W/O PORTFOLIO:  LIN FENG-CHENG 
---------------------------------------

THE KMT CENTRAL STANDING COMMITTEE SINCE 1993. HE HAS 
ONE SON AND TWO DAUGHTERS.  ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS 
MARRIED A CHINESE-AMERICAN ATTORNEY IN HAWAII 1996. 
 
17.  (C) LIN STEPPED DOWN AS INTERIOR MINISTER IN MAY, 
1997, IN ORDER TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INABILITY 
OF THE POLICE TO SOLVE A SERIES OF HIGH-PROFILE MURDERS 
AND SEVERAL SPECTACULAR UNSOLVED CRIMINAL CASES.  LIN 
IS SAID TO BE CLOSE BOTH TO PRESIDENT LEE TENG-HUI AND 
TO TAIWAN PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR JAMES SOONG.  GIVEN HIS 
STRONG BASE IN TAIPEI COUNTY AND HIS YEARS OF 
EXPERIENCE, LIN REMAINS A POWERFUL FIGURE IN HIS OWN 
RIGHT IN TAIWAN POLITICS.

SUBJECT: KAOHSIUNG OBSERVES 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
FORMOSA MAGAZINE INCIDENT 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: IN KAOHSIUNG ON DECEMBER 10, 1979, A 
GROUP OF DEMONSTRATORS CONNECTED TO THE \"DANG WAI\" 
(OUTSIDE THE PARTY OR NON-KMT) MAGAZINE \"MEILIDAO,\" OR 
FORMOSA, ATTEMPTED TO MARCH TO A NEARBY PARK WHERE THEY 
PLANNED TO RALLY IN COMMEMORATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN 
RIGHTS DAY. SHORTLY AFTER THE MARCH BEGAN, THE 
DEMONSTRATORS RAN INTO A SOLID PHALANX OF POLICE. THE 
VOLATILE SITUATION WAS EXACERBATED BY THE PRESENCE OF 
HUNDREDS OF LOCAL \"LIUMANG\" (HOODLUMS) RECRUITED TO ACT 
AS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS. IN THE MELEE THAT ENSUED, A 
NUMBER OR DEMONSTRATORS AND POLICE WERE INJURED. THE 
EVENT LED TO A CRACKDOWN IN WHICH MANY OF THE DANG WAI\'S 
SUCCESSOR DEMOCRATIC PROGRESSIVE PARTY\'S (DPP) CURRENT 
LEADERS WERE AMONG THE 150 PEOPLE ARRESTED. THE 
ANNIVERSARY HAS BEEN THE OCCASION FOR A SPECIAL EXHIBIT 
AT THE KAOHSIUNG HISTORY MUSEUM AND A SERIES OF SYMPOSIA 
ON THE EVENT. AIT/K SPOKE TO A NUMBER OF JOURNALISTS, 
SCHOLARS, WITNESSES TO AND PARTICIPANTS IN THE EVENT TO 
GET A SENSE OF THE HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE 
OF THE INCIDENT. END SUMMARY. 
 
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
--------------------- 
2. (U) FORMOSA MAGAZINE\'S FIRST ISSUE APPEARED ON AUGUST 
29, 1979 AND SOLD MORE THAN 110,000 COPIES. CIRCULATION 
QUICKLY INCREASED AND BY THE THIRD ISSUE HAD REACHED 
NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES. THE MAGAZINE\'S 
KAOHSIUNG OFFICE OPENED ON SEPTEMBER 28. THE MAGAZINE\'S 
EXPLODING CIRCULATION AND ITS FOCUS ON DEMOCRACY AND 
TAIWANESE IDENTITY UNNERVED A KMT LEADERSHIP ALREADY 
SHAKEN BY THE UNITED STATES\' DECEMBER 1978 DECISION TO 
SWITCH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS FROM THE ROC TO THE PRC. 
AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE DECISION BY THE MAGAZINE\'S 
STAFF TO ORGANIZE A MARCH AND RALLY TO COINCIDE WITH 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DAY ON DECEMBER10 LED TO THE 
VIOLENT CONFRONTATION WITH POLICE ND TROOPS FROM THE 
TAIWAN GARRISON COMMAND, AND TO THE SUBSEQUENT CRACKDOWN. 
THESE EVENTS LAUNCHED THE CAREERS OF MANY OF TODAY\'S DPP 
LEADERS. 
 
DECEMBER 9: THE KUSHAN INCIDENT 
------------------------------- 
3. (U) THE EVENT WHICH HELPED SPARK THE VIOLENCE OF 
DECEMBER 10 WAS THE ARREST AND BEATING OF SEVERAL OF THE 
MAGAZINE\'S STAFF WHO WERE PUBLICIZING THE NEXT DAY\'S 
MARCH AND RALLY. SHORTLY AFTER DARK ON DECEMBER 9, 
SEVERAL VOLUNTEERS ON THE STAFF, INCLUDING CURRENT DPP 
LEGISLATOR DAI ZHEN-YAO, SET OFF IN SPEAKER TRUCKS FOR 
KAOHSIUNG\'S KUSHAN DISTRICT. AS THE DRIVERS ENTERED A 
NARROW STREET, THEY ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL LOCAL POLICE 
OFFICERS WHO ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE TRUCKS BY LYING DOWN 
ACROSS THE ROAD. AFTER A BRIEF STAND-OFF THE MAGAZINE 
STAFF BODILY REMOVED THE POLICE FROM THE ROAD AND 
CONTINUED ON THEIR ROUTE. A SHORT DISTANCE ON, THE ROAD 
WAS BLOCKED FORE AND AFT BY POLICE VEHICLES AND POLICE 
OFFICERS WHO BROKE ONE TRUCK\'S WINDSHIELD AND BEAT THE 
DRIVER. 
 
4. (U) IN THE FIGHT THAT FOLLOWED, TWO OF THE MAGAZINE 
STAFF WERE ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO KUSHAN POLICE STATION. 
WHEN WORD OF THE ARRESTS SPREAD, A CROWD OF SOME SIXTY 
PEOPLE INCLUDING DPP ELDER AND FORMER PARTY CHAIRMAN SHIH 
MING-TE (THEN THE MAGAZINE\'S GENERAL MANAGER), SURROUNDED 
THE STATION AND DEMANDED THE RELEASE OF THE PRISONERS. 
THE MOOD OF THE CROWD TURNED VIOLENT WHEN IT WAS LEARNED 
THAT THE PRISONERS HAD BEEN DRAGGED UPSTAIRS BY THE FEET 
AND THAT ONE HAD SUFFERED A CONCUSSION. ACCORDING TO 
DAI, POLICE ARMED WITH RIFLES AND BAYONETS SURROUNDED THE 
CROWD, WHICH HAD REFUSED ORDERS TO MOVE ON. THE TWO WERE 
EVENTUALLY RELEASED AT ABOUT 2:00 AM AND THE CROWD 
DISPERSED. THOUGH THERE WERE NO SERIOUS CONFRONTATIONS 
WITH POLICE AT THE STATION, THE INCIDENT INCREASED 
TENSIONS AND SET A CONFRONTATIONAL TONE FOR THE FOLLOWING 
DAY. 
 
DECEMBER 10: THE KAOHSIUNG RIOT 
------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) THE DECEMBER 10 MARCH WAS TO HAVE BEGUN AND 
ENDED AT KAOHSIUNG ROTARY PARK, TAKING A CIRCULAR ROUTE 
PAST THE HSIN HSENG POLICE STATION. APPROXIMATELY SIX 
HUNDRED MARCHERS SET OFF. ONLY TWO HUNDRED METERS INTO 
THE MARCH, THE DEMONSTRATORS ENCOUNTERED A SOLID WALL OF 
RIOT POLICE WHILE THE ROAD ON BOTH SIDES WAS OCCUPIED BY 
APPROXIMATELY 400 LIUMANG ALLEGEDLY RECRUITED BY THEN 
KAOHSIUNG MAYOR WU YU-YUN. ACCORDING TO SEVERAL OF OUR 
INTERLOCUTORS, THE TWO LEADERS OF THE GANGSTER ELEMENTS 
WERE TSAI SUNG-HSIUNG, WHO IS NOW DEPUTY SPEAKER OF THE 
KAOHSIUNG CITY COUNCIL, AND CHANG HSING-WU, WHO IS ALSO A 
CITY COUNCILMAN. (NOTE: WU YU-YUN HAS CONSISTENTLY 
DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT IN RECRUITING GANGSTERS TO DISRUPT 
THE MARCH. END NOTE) 
 
6. (U) WHILE THE ENSUING SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IS NOT 
ENTIRELY CLEAR, WITNESSES AND PARTICIPANTS AGREED THAT 
THE GANGSTERS ACTED AS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS, ATTACKING 
BOTH POLICE AND MARCHERS WITH BAMBOO POLES AND IRON RODS. 
IN THE MELEE THAT ENSUED THE POLICE USED TEAR-GAS AND 
RIOT STICKS TO BREAK UP THE MARCH. REPORTS OF INJURIES 
RANGE FROM THE HUNDREDS TO MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND WITH 
ONE DEMONSTRATOR LATER DYING OF HIS INJURIES. OVER THE 
NEXT MONTH, MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARTICIPANTS 
AND SYMPATHIZERS WERE ROUNDED UP. SHIH MING-TE AND SIX 
OTHERS WERE TRIED IN MILITARY COURTS AND SENTENCED TO 
PRISON TERMS OF BETWEEN TWELVE YEARS AND LIFE. SEVERAL 
INTERVIEWEES TOLD US THAT ONLY PRESSURE FROM US 
CONGRESSMEN AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS 
PREVENTED SHIH MING-TE FROM BEING SENTENCED TO DEATH. 
THIRTY-FOUR OTHERS WERE TRIED IN CIVILIAN COURTS AND 
SENTENCED TO TERMS OF FOUR TO SIX YEARS. THE ARRESTS 
EFFECTIVELY SILENCED THE OPPOSITION UNTIL ITS LEADERS 
WERE PAROLED IN 1987. 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT: THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
MEILIDAO INCIDENT IS THAT IT WAS THE CRUCIBLE IN WHICH 
THE CAREERS OF TODAY\'S OPPOSITION LEADERS WERE FORGED. 
THE LIST OF THOSE ARRESTED AND JAILED IS A WHO\'S WHO OF 
THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT. AMONG THEM ARE DPP VICE 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANNETTE LU (LU HSIU-LIEN), FORMER 
DPP CHAIRMAN AND PARTY CO-FOUNDER SHIH MING-TE, CURRENT 
DPP CHAIRMAN LIN YI-HSIUNG, DPP FOUNDING FATHER HUANG 
HSIN-CHIEH, LEGISLATOR DAI ZHEN-YAO AND NATIONAL POLICY 
ADVISOR CHOU PING-TE. OTHERS, INCLUDING DPP PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE CHEN SHUI-BIEN AND KAOHSIUNG MAYOR FRANK HSIEH 
(HSIEH CHANG-TING), GOT THEIR POLITICAL START AS 
ATTORNEYS DEFENDING THE ARRESTED ACTIVISTS. ONE 
COMMENTATOR SAID THAT HE BELIEVES THAT PRESSURE FROM THE 
UNITED STATES ON KMT-RULED TAIWAN TO DEMOCRATIZE 
INCREASED AFTER 1979 AND LED DIRECTLY TO THE END OF 
MARTIAL LAW, THE END OF THE BAN ON POLITICAL PARTY 
FORMATION AND THE END OF RESTRICTIONS ON THE PRESS. 
 
8. (SBU) COMMENT (CONT.) OUR INTERLOCUTORS AGREED THAT 
THE MELIDAO INCIDENT WAS THE TURNING POINT IN TAIWAN\'S 
DEMOCRATIZATION. THE IDEOLOGICALLY FRACTURED TANG-WAI 
WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A COHERENT POLITICAL PARTY CAPABLE 
OF FORMING A VIABLE OPPOSITION. THE INCIDENT AND THE 
OPEN TRIAL OF THE ACCUSED RAISED POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS 
IN TAIWAN AND BROUGHT HOME THE VALUE OF DEMOCRACY. THIS 
IN TURN LED THE ELECTORATE TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVISTS, 
THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR DEFENSE TEAM AT THE BALLOT BOX 
ENABLING MANY OF THEM TO BECOME ELECTED OFFICIALS AT ALL 
LEVELS. TAIWANESE OVERSEAS ORGANIZED INDEPENDENCE 
MOVEMENTS WHILE SCORES OF TAIWAN GRADUATE STUDENTS 
ABANDONED THEIR STUDIES IN THE US, EUROPE, AND JAPAN TO 
RETURN HOME AND JOIN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. THUS WERE 
SET IN MOTION THE FORCES WHICH HAVE MADE TAIWAN A 
VIBRANT, MULTIPARTY DEMOCRACY, AND PUT THE OPPOSITION DPP 
IN THE POSITION OF MOUNTING A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO 
CONTINUED KMT RULE IN THE MARCH, 2000 PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: TAIWAN FIGHTS AN UPHILL BATTLE TO CONTAIN HIV/AIDS 
 
REF:  SECSTATE 168905 
 
1.  Summary. In response to reftel, AIT has assessed the 
scope and government response to the AIDS epidemic in 
Taiwan.  The Government is committed at the highest levels 
to controlling its spread and based on the numbers, HIV/AIDS 
rates are still manageable.  In close cooperation with NGOs, 
Taiwan has adopted a comprehensive approach to control and 
prevent the disease.  Taiwan\'s National Health Insurance 
also makes treatment affordable and universally available. 
Despite such efforts, however, Taiwan\'s rates of infection, 
while relatively low by Southeast Asian standards, are 
growing, particularly among young people.  Taiwan will need 
to remain vigilant if it is to maintain control of the 
uphill battle against the spread of HIV/AIDS.  End Summary. 
 
Political Will is Strong and Present 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. Political leadership in Taiwan appears to take the issue 
of containing the spread of HIV/AIDS seriously.  In 2001, 
the Executive Yuan (EY) established an inter-agency AIDS- 
Prevention Committee.  The Committee is chaired by the Vice 
Premier and overseen by Department of Health (DOH) in 
consultation with a team of medical professionals and 
experts from government, academia and NGOs.  President Chen 
Shui-bian demonstrated his support to the Committee\'s 
efforts by becoming personally involved in a campaign to 
raise awareness of the issue by publicly urging every 
citizen to get involved in HIV/AIDS prevention and control. 
 
Government Actions Support Words 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. Taiwan funds AIDS prevention, control and treatment 
activities in 12 different government agencies.  DOH 
receives the lion\'s share of approximately 1/3 of Taiwan\'s 
USD 3.8 million annual AIDS-prevention budget.  Furthermore, 
DOH has the lead in ensuring the coordination of all 
government-funded programs, which range from education 
campaigns, to screening programs, to treatment regimens. 
 
4. Taiwan is also committed to containing the global spread 
of HIV/AIDS and to this end contributed USD 1 million to the 
Global AIDS Fund both in 2002 and 2003.  Taiwan has also 
agreed to provide bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance to Haiti, 
one of the countries that maintains diplomatic ties with 
Taiwan.  Minister of Health Chen Chien-jen visited Haiti in 
August 2004 and committed USD 2 million to establish a 
disease research laboratory in Haiti.  Initially the 
laboratory will be dedicated entirely towards HIV/AIDS 
testing and prevention.  Taiwan is fully funding both the 
construction of the building and the internal laboratory 
facilities.  Construction of the laboratory is expected to 
be completed within one year.  Taiwan has also partnered 
with the US Centers for Disease Control (USCDC) to provide 
staff and technological support once the project is 
completed. 
 
5. Taiwan offers comprehensive and affordable HIV/AIDS 
treatment. The HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) 
drug cocktail treatment for HIV-positive patients has been 
completely covered by National Health Insurance Program 
since 1997.  According to Taiwan\'s Center for Disease 
Control (TCDC), HAART has been very effective and one study 
has shown that the provision of free HAART decreased HIV 
transmission by 53 percent in Taiwan.  TCDC also told AIT 
that, currently, the 10-year life expectancy rate for AIDS 
patients under the HAART treatment is up to 84 percent. 
 
6. Finally, since Dec. 17, 1991, Taiwan has had a regulation 
on AIDS prevention in effect, which imposes jail sentences 
of up to 7 years for any individual that knowingly engages 
in unprotected sex, sharing needles or donating blood, 
organs or other bodily fluids. 
 
The Numbers 
----------- 
 
7. Since its first recorded case of HIV in 1984 through July 
2004, Taiwan has 6,255 HIV confirmed infections.  This 
number includes 5,789 local citizens and 466 foreigners.  Of 
the 6,255 cases, 1,724 have developed AIDS, 971 of which 
have died.  In 2004 alone, already 602 new cases have been 
identified.  It is expected that the growth rate in 2004 
will represent a 20 percent increase from 2003.  This would 
indicate a growing rate of infections as, over the past five 
years, Taiwan\'s rate of infection has typically increased by 
10 - 15 percent annually.  While the above represent 
Taiwan\'s official statistics, Taiwan\'s Center for Disease 
Control (TCDC) has told AIT that the real number of 
infections may be five times higher than the reported cases 
and the projected number for Taiwan\'s HIV/AIDS patients is 
anticipated to reach 14,536 by 2011. 
 
8. Comment.  According to Dr. Fang Chi-tai, one of Taiwan\'s 
leading AIDS/HIV Researchers at National Taiwan University 
Hospital, the actual number is closer to two times CDC\'s 
confirmed number of cases.  Dr. Fang said that TCDC tends to 
exaggerate the situation in order to encourage more people 
to take the issue seriously.  He said the main reason for 
the discrepancy is that, due to the sometimes long 
incubation period, many people with HIV are asymptomatic and 
do not think to be tested.  He noted, however, that this is 
not the case among perceived high-risk groups such as 
homosexuals who tend to be more aware of the risks and test 
themselves regularly.  He added that even those who test for 
the disease may not know they have it because, in its early 
stages, testing sometimes results in false negatives.   End 
Comment. 
 
The Patients 
------------ 
 
9. Of the 5,789 Taiwan citizens confirmed to be HIV 
positive, 37 percent identified themselves as heterosexual, 
35 percent identified themselves as homosexual, 11 
identified themselves as bisexual, and 17 percent did not 
specify their sexual preference. 
 
10. Unfortunately, the number of infections among young 
people have grown at an alarming pace. Official figures show 
that the number of 15-24 year olds testing HIV positive 
increased from 58 in 1998 to 136 in 2002.  The proportion of 
new infections occurring in young people has also steadily 
increased over recent years.  In 1998, 15-24 year olds made 
up 14.9 percent of total new infections in Taiwan.  In 1999 
15-24 year olds made up 18.1 percent, in 2000 they made up 
19.4 percent and in 2001 they made up 21.5 percent of total 
new infections. 
 
11. Moreover, of the total 5,789 citizens infected with HIV, 
almost 40 percent of the patients (2,154) contracted the 
disease between 20-29 years of age.  Seventy percent of the 
5,789 cases contracted HIV when they were between 20-39 
years of age. 
 
12. Another population of concern is commercial sex workers. 
Sex workers in Taiwan fall into three categories: 1) career 
sex workers who, since commercial sex work was banned in 
1999, have either lost their licenses or are working in the 
approximately 100 remaining brothels grand-fathered under 
the new law; 2) women who work in the \"entertainment 
industry\" (teahouses, barber shops, and karaoke clubs), some 
of whom occasionally have sex for money; and 3) \"escorts,\" 
generally recruited and managed by organized crime groups 
and include many women who have immigrated illegally from 
Mainland China. 
 
Transmission 
------------ 
 
13. According to TCDC, over 90 percent of the HIV infections 
in Taiwan are believed to result from unprotected sex. TCDC 
claims that over the past 3 years, however, transmission as 
a result of intravenous drug use has been a growing factor. 
As of June this year, the percentage of total infections 
resulting from shared needles is estimated to be 3.49.  More 
alarming is the growing rate of new infections resulting 
from drug use.  Where in 2002, 12 new cases were determined 
to have resulted from sharing needles, intravenous drug use 
has been linked to 63 new cases in 2003 and 65 new cases in 
the first half of 2004.   Other transmission routes in 
Taiwan of concern are those from mother to child and those 
from Taiwan businessmen who contract the disease while in 
Mainland China and then transmit it to their wives in 
Taiwan. 
 
Education Programs 
------------------ 
 
14. In an effort to address the growing rates of infection, 
particularly among young people, Taiwan has stepped up its 
HIV/AIDS education efforts.  Since 2002, Taiwan\'s Department 
of Education (DOE) has mandated that all high-school 
students receive two hours of information on HIV/AIDS per 
year.  To this end, in 2001, DOE established an \"AIDS 
Prevention Education Committee.\"  The Committee is 
responsible for overseeing AIDS prevention activities, 
systematizing AIDS-related materials and curriculum, 
training educators on how to teach AIDS prevention, and 
protecting the rights of the HIV/AIDS infected students in 
all schools.  The Committee\'s goal is to ensure that at 
least 90 percent of high-school students understand what 
AIDS is and how to prevent its spread.  The Department 
typically partners with NGOs to facilitate its training 
programs for teachers (see paras. 16-18). 
 
15. In 2003, DOE designated the first week of December as 
\"AIDS prevention week\" and implemented a \"Love\'s Red Ribbon\" 
program, which involved distributing red ribbons to raise 
awareness about AIDS and AIDS prevention among young people. 
DOE also urged schools at all levels schools to promote 
HIV/AIDS awareness among their students.  Taiwan is a strong 
proponent of the AIDS-prevention slogan: ABC (Abstinence, Be 
faithful and Condoms). 
Role of NGOs 
------------ 
 
16. NGOs play an important role in controlling HIV/AIDS 
transmissions in Taiwan. Taiwan AIDS NGO Alliance consists 
of more than 27 private groups, that are working towards 
promoting safe sex, striving for basic human rights and 
addressing the stigma of AIDS and discrimination.  These 
groups are active in all aspects of disease control from 
education campaigns to testing and counseling programs. 
 
17. Most notably, the Department of Education cooperates 
closely with NGOs to implement its HIV AIDS education goals 
and activities.  NGOs are integrally involved in helping to 
design and teach AIDS prevention curricula both within and 
outside of schools.   For example, DOE helps fund the NGO 
Mercy Hill Medical Foundation, which jointly with Taipei 
Normal University runs programs to educate teachers to 
address sex and sexuality issues in classrooms.  Programs 
are available for educators at all levels (from elementary 
schools to college campuses).  These programs are held 3-4 
times a year and approximately 100 teachers attend each 
session.  Since 1989, over 4,500 teachers in Taiwan have 
been trained to teach AIDS education through these programs. 
 
18. The Taiwan Center for Disease Control (CDC) has also 
funded efforts by other NGOs including Light of Friendship 
and the Presbyterian Church of Taiwan-affiliated AIDS 
Education Foundation to train teachers and students at all 
levels. 
 
19. Another NGO involved in preventing the spread of AIDS is 
Taipei\'s Collective of Sex Workers and Supporters (COSWAS), 
an advocacy group for licensed and formerly licensed sex 
workers.  Taipei\'s Municipal STD Prevention Clinic has 
enlisted the organization to spearhead education efforts 
among acknowledged sex workers.  However, according to 
COSWAS, few women who work in the entertainment industry are 
willing to acknowledge that they have sex for money, while 
escorts, because of their connections with organized crime 
and/or illegal immigration status, are often impossible to 
reach. 
 
Public Reaction to AIDS Education 
--------------------------------- 
 
20.  While there is almost no resistance to sexual education 
in schools by parents, major education NGOs take markedly 
different approaches to the controversial issue of 
abstinence versus condom use in preventing infection.  As a 
result, the approach taken by each school depends entirely 
on which NGO the Administrators choose to help run the 
programs. 
 
Public Screening Programs 
------------------------- 
 
21. Since the outbreak of the AIDS epidemic, Taiwan has 
conducted more than 33 million HIV tests.  Furthermore, 
groups such as blood donors, expectant mothers, foreign 
workers, and inductees for military service are tested on a 
routine basis. 
 
22. In an effort to reduce transmission rates, the 
government has recently stepped up its screening efforts 
among pregnant women and individuals with other known 
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  Beginning in March 
2004, Taiwan\'s Department of Health worked with Taoyuan 
County (where the current rate of infection is six out of 
100,000) to test all pregnant women.  DOH is hoping to 
expand the practice throughout Taiwan in an effort to reduce 
the number of mother-to-baby HIV transmissions.  In 
addition, in early 2004, DOH initiated a Sentinel 
Surveillance System, which requires all doctors to screen 
individuals diagnosed with other sexual related diseases for 
HIV. 
 
Anonymous Screening Programs 
---------------------------- 
 
23. In Taipei, most anonymous tests are performed on-site by 
the Taipei Municipal STD Prevention Clinic.  There are also 
ten hospitals spread throughout Taiwan that perform 
anonymous testing.  In addition, several NGOS offer antibody 
testing (using blood or saliva samples) at homosexual 
meeting places.  Volunteers collect the samples and counsel 
clients; the samples are then forwarded to the STD Clinic 
for testing, and clients call the NGO to receive the 
results.  NGOs also mail testing kits and instructions to 
individuals who wish to conduct the test at home.  Activists 
justify these methods, which differ from the more rigorous 
counseling and privacy protocols in place in many testing 
facilities in the U.S., in terms of meeting the clients\' 
comfort level and maximizing the number of tests performed. 
 
24. Despite these anonymous programs, TCDC is concerned that 
many people who think they may have HIV are using blood 
donation as a screening method.  TCDC told AIT that in 2003, 
60 blood donors were found to be HIV/AIDS carriers and there 
have been 10 cases of infection as a result of blood 
transfusion since 1998. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
25.  Overall, Taiwan\'s commitment to tackling the disease is 
strong and visible.  Unfortunately, with rising rates of 
infection among 15-24 year olds, the efforts to educate its 
young population have not yet appeared to change behavior. 
Hopefully, it is a program, which simply needs more time to 
take affect.  In any case, Taiwan will need to remain 
vigilant if it is to maintain control of the uphill battle 
against the spread of HIV/AIDS in Taiwan.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR CUBAN SUGAR ASSURANCES 
- FY 2005 
 
REF: STATE 171566 
 
1. In response to our letter to TECRO on August 12 
requesting information on Taiwan\'s policy on purchase and re- 
export of Cuban sugar, we received the reply from the Board 
of Foreign Trade (BOFT). 
 
2. Below is the text of BOFT response from Director General 
Huang Chih-peng. 
 
3. Begin text. 
 
Your office\'s letter addressed to TECRO of August 12, 2004, 
requesting a written verification that Taiwan does not 
import Cuban sugar for re-export to the United States, was 
forwarded to this Bureau for reply. 
 
Let me start by stating that this Bureau is delighted to 
hear that the United States government has granted Taiwan 
the tariff-rate quota of 12,636 metric tons of raw cane 
sugar for the period October 1, 2004-September 30, 2005. 
Please rest assured that we know the United States prohibits 
the importation of Cuban sugar into the United States.  We 
will take appropriate measures to guarantee that your 
regulations are not violated. 
 
For your information, under Taiwan\'s current administration 
system, an import permit would still be required for 
importing any merchandise from Cuba, including any form of 
sugar.  According to our statistics, Taiwan has never 
imported sugar or sugar products from Cuba in the past.  We 
would also like to affirm that Taiwan will not import Cuban 
sugar for re-export to the United States. 
 
Moreover, as Taiwan Sugar Corporation is the sole 
manufacturer of sugar in Taiwan, we can also affirm that 
Taiwan Sugar Corporation will continue to be the certifying 
authority.  Attached please find a copy of the statement 
from Taiwan Sugar Corporation which certifies that they only 
export sugar of Taiwan origin to the United States and do 
not import Cuban sugar for re-export to the United States. 
 
Please feel free to contact us again if you have any further 
questions.

1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Following-up the AIT-BOFT meeting 
reported ref A, on October 1 BOFT faxed to AIT additional 
documents related to Taiwan\'s export control system and 
correspondence regarding the Ching Hwee International Trading 
Company.  These documents have been relayed via fax to EAP/TC 
and are translated informally below.  Separately, AIT has 
accepted a BOFT invitation to visit two machine tool 
companies near Taichung and learned the inter-agency debate 
over technology transfer legislation continues.  End summary. 
 
 
AIT Informal Translation of BOFT Letter to Customs 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (SBU) Board of Foreign Trade letter to the Directorate 
General of Customs, dated September 15, 2004: 
 
(Begin text of letter) 
 
Subject: To meet BOFT\'s need to strengthen sensitive high 
technology commodities (SHTC) export control, the Directorate 
General of Customs is advised to enroll the company \"Ching 
Hwee International Trading Company, Ltd\" (registration 
number: 23003535) in the Customs\' \"manufacturers high-risk 
management list\", and to closely monitor the machine tools 
exported from the subject company to the controlled areas 
including North Korea. 
 
Explanations: 
 
I.  This action is based on MOFA\'s August 2, 2004 letter 
responding to the written request from TECRO/W dated July 30, 
2004. 
 
II.  Mr. Randy Schriver from the State Department conveyed 
the message to TECRO/W Representative Mr. David Lee that 
showed one Taiwan company \"Ching Hwee International Trading 
Co., Ltd\" has been involved in exporting machine tools to 
North Korea and that these commodities will likely be used in 
nuclear development projects.  In response, Mr. Lee 
reiterated that Taiwan is willing to comply with U.S. 
requests on antiterrorism and anti-WMD, and he would ask 
Taiwan\'s related agencies to work together on this case. 
Senior Advisor Mr. David Asher from the State Department also 
brought up this issue in the meeting with MOJ on August 30, 
2004. 
 
III.  BOFT has collected the export statistics of the subject 
company on machine tools from 2001-May 2004 and has requested 
the company to quickly provide detailed information related 
to these exports including descriptions of the machines, 
ordering and shipping information, and importer addresses. 
After receiving the information, the Industrial Technology 
Research Institute (ITRI) will determine whether these 
commodities were SHTC. 
 
IV.  According to BOFT,s December 31, 2003 circular entitled 
\"SHTC Categories, Special SHTC Categories and Exporting 
Control Areas,\" North Korea is one of the SHTC export 
controlled areas.  The circular references the Wassenaar 
Arrangement, which includes machine tools among controlled 
commodities.  Moreover, the circular states that commodities 
not on controlled lists, but which could possibly be used to 
produce or develop nuclear or biochemical weapons or missiles 
would be categorized as SHTC.  Exporters of such commodities 
must apply for a SHTC export permit from BOFT in advance. 
 
V.  BOFT requests all Customs offices to strengthen 
inspections of Ching Hwee\'s machine-tool exports (Customs 
Commodity Codes 8456-8466) to any controlled areas including 
Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and China, and immediately 
inform BOFT of any finding that Ching Hwee has violated 
regulations. 
 
(End text of letter) 
 
AIT Informal Translation of Customs\' Reply 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (SBU) Directorate General Customs letter to BOFT dated 
September 23, 2004. 
 
(Begin text of letter) 
 
Subject: Customs will keep a close watch on the machine tool 
exports of Ching Hwee to controlled areas, and, acting 
according to the regulations, will only allow these exports 
when accompanied by SHTC export permits. 
 
Explanations: 
I.  This action is based on BOFT\'s September 15 letter. 
 
II.  To prevent Ching Hwee from exporting SHTC commodities 
without approval, all customs bureaus shall tighten 
inspections of machine tools exported to Iran, Iraq, Libya, 
North Korea, China, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria.  Please report 
any findings of illegal exports of SHTC commodities. 
 
(End text of letter) 
 
Increased Number of Export Licenses 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) A separate document received via fax from BOFT on 
October 1 shows the number of export licenses granted in 2002 
was 5,636; in 2003 was 8090; in the first quarter of 2004 was 
2363; and in the second quarter of 2004 was 2442.  The number 
of licenses granted in first two quarters of 2004 represented 
year-on-year increases of 41.9 and 32.6 percent respectively. 
 BOFT suggested the numbers were up partly because of 
increased awareness among businesses of the need for export 
licenses. 
 
Invitation to Join BOFT/Customs Training Excursion 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5.  (SBU) AIT has accepted an invitation from BOFT to join a 
BOFT-organized training program for Taiwan Customs officers. 
The training will involve visits on October 22 to two machine 
tool companies in the Taichung area (Victor Taichung 
Machinery Works Company, Ltd., and Yeong Chin Machinery 
Industries Company, Ltd.).  The purpose of these visits is to 
give Customs officers a better understanding of the different 
types and technologies of machine tools. 
 
Technology Transfer Legislation 
------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) BOFT informed AIT in a telephone conversation on 
October 1 that it is trying hard to persuade Taiwan\'s NSC to 
permit it to provide AIT with a draft of the pending 
legislation on technology transfer.  AIT asked BOFT for 
additional infomation on commodity types and destinations of 
the exports which have received SHTC permits in recent 
months, as well as for information on Ching Hwee\'s exports of 
machine tools to non-restricted countries.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, 
TAIWAN\'S ARMS PROCUREMENTS, KEYSER CASE 
 
 
1. U.S. Presidential Election 
 
A) \"The United States Needs to Re-organize Its 
Relations with [Its] Asian Allies\" 
 
Lai I-chung, International Affairs Director of the 
Taiwan Think Tank, said in an op-ed in the centrist, 
pro-status quo \"China Times\" (10/1): 
 
\"Judging by the strategic traits of the two U.S. 
presidential candidates\' staff specializing in Asia- 
Pacific policy, this November\'s U.S. presidential 
election can be basically viewed as a race between the 
`Pan Asia\' faction whose Asian strategic focus lies in 
the `U.S.-Japan alliance,\' and the `China Hand\' faction 
whose Asian policy centers on the `U.S.-China strategic 
partnership.\'   The `Pan Asia\' faction not only has 
dominated the U.S. government\'s Asia policy for the 
past four years, but its source can also be traced back 
to the strategic views adopted by former Secretary of 
State George Schultz of the Reagan administration.  The 
`China Hand\' faction, however, refers to former U.S. 
President Bill Clinton\'s senior staff members during 
his second term of office.  No matter who is elected 
U.S. president [in November], he will face an Asian 
strategic environment that has been fundamentally 
changed.  As a result, it has become a key issue as to 
how to deal with the United States\' relations with its 
allies in Asia. . 
 
\"Some people might think that Washington will not have 
to go through much hardship in dealing with its 
relations with its Asian allies if it views `U.S.-China 
relations\' as the core of its Asian policy.  Such an 
argument is basically wrong.  If Washington lacks a 
stable relationship with its Asian allies, it will 
diminish Beijing\'s needs regarding Washington, which 
will, in turn, lose a powerful bargaining chip when 
dealing with Beijing.  Such a development, as a result, 
will add more variables to Washington-Beijing ties. 
Thus, for either the `Pan Asia\' faction or the `China 
Hand\' faction, it is very important [for the United 
States] to maintain strong and powerful alliances in 
Asia. 
 
\"The escalating nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula 
has put the question of whether the current regime in 
Pyongyang is sustainable under the spotlight.  The 
impact of Taiwan\'s democratic development versus 
China\'s swelling nationalism and its military expansion 
have also made it really difficult to maintain the 
`status quo\' across the Taiwan Strait.  All these 
indicate that the next U.S. president may be required 
to face and deal with problems such as the unification 
on the Korean Peninsula and conflicts across the Taiwan 
Strait.  Thus, re-identifying [the United States\'] 
Asian alliances will be a top priority for the new U.S. 
president .\" 
 
B) \"Revelations [from the] U.S. Presidential Election: 
Fair Competition Is the Bottom Line for Democratic 
Rule\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
observed in an editorial (10/4): 
 
\". U.S. society is indeed experiencing an atmosphere of 
confrontation because of the heated presidential 
election; some people even believe that a dividing 
crisis rarely seen over the past few decades is 
happening in the United States.  However, as was shown 
in the debate by [U.S. President George W.] Bush and 
his rival [Senator John] Kerry, the democratic rules of 
the game that have been built up gradually since the 
founding of the United States are still the bottom line 
governing each presidential candidate. . 
 
\"A president who seeks to expand the hegemonic power 
[of his nation over] the world is still bound by the 
domestic system of his country, from accepting 
criticism of the Congress in its investigative reports 
to signing an agreement before the presidential debate. 
All these indicate the check and balances of democracy 
and the spirit of fair competition honored by a society 
ruled by law.  Watching the U.S. presidential race from 
across the Pacific Ocean, [we hope] Taiwan . could also 
reach a consensus on the rule of fair competition.\" 
 
C) \"Keeping Kerry\'s Asia Policy on Track Is Vital to 
Taiwan\" 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" noted in an editorial (10/3): 
\". While Bush and Kerry did not mention anything about 
the Taiwan Strait [in their first debate], the exchange 
clearly showed that both men have placed East Asia high 
on their list of priorities and take Asian issues very 
seriously.  That is another reason why will have to be 
active and adamant in getting our positions 
communicated to both sides as they continue to expand 
on issues dealt with in the first debate over the 
coming days and weeks. 
 
\"This task may not be as urgent for dealing with the 
incumbent administration, since we already have strong 
channels of communication with officials currently in 
power. 
 
\"But we will have to strengthen our efforts toward the 
Kerry campaign, as thy are still in the early stages of 
putting together a policy. 
 
\"Now that we have `established a beachhead\' with 
advisers to the would-be American president, we hope 
that our diplomats will build on these efforts and take 
our causes deep into the heart of the Kerry camp.\" 
 
2. Taiwan\'s Arms Procurement 
 
\"China\'s Double Play Strategy toward Taiwan: Anti-Arms 
Sales at the United States and Anti-Arms Procurement in 
Taiwan\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" editorialized 
(10/2): 
 
\". Beijing is coming to realize that the United States\' 
one-China policy is different from its own one-China 
principle and that Washington will give almost 
unreserved support to its commitment to Taiwan\'s 
security.  Beijing\'s understanding is that Washington\'s 
cross-Strait policy will meet the `dream of the one 
China empire;\' namely, Washington is only interested in 
maintaining peace [in the Taiwan Strait] and will not 
`push for unification.\'  Based on such a policy, the 
United States will naturally express serious concern 
and respond to China\'s use of force against Taiwan, as 
demonstrated by U.S. determination during cross-Strait 
tension in 1996.  To prevent the cross-Strait situation 
from getting out of control, the United States\' 
emphasis on keeping a balance of military strength 
across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan\'s purchase of 
weapons from the United States based on its needs to 
defend itself against China\'s threats have become a 
very important interaction that safeguards Taiwan\'s 
security. 
 
\"Getting to understand the significance of the U.S. 
arms sales to Taiwan, Beijing has put its focus while 
dealing with the United States over the past few years 
on demanding that Washington stop arms sales to Taiwan. 
.  The United States of course would not do whatever 
Beijing tells it to.  But what is worth noticing is 
that China has shifted its focus to Taiwan since it 
discovered that it could not ask Washington to stop 
arms sales to the island.  Beijing\'s plan is evident: 
even though the United States refuses to stop arms 
sales to Taiwan, it could still reach the goal of 
[retarding] Taiwan\'s defensive capabilities by urging 
people in Taiwan to stop arms procurements from the 
United States.  Those who voice opposition to arms 
procurements in Taiwan thus must realize their roles in 
China\'s anti-arms sales strategy.\" 
 
3. Keyser Case 
 
\"US-Taiwan ties need patching up\" 
 
Edward Chen, Director of the Graduate Institute of 
American Studies at Tamkang University, said in an op- 
ed in the pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei 
Times\" (10/4): 
 
\". There are four respects in which the Keyser affair 
is likely to affect Taiwan.  First, Keyser, who was in 
line to be the next chairman of the American Institute 
in Taiwan, will now certainly not be taking up that 
post. 
\"It is questionable whether another nominee will be as 
favorable to Taiwan. 
\"Second, revelations of a `national security\' leak will 
make US officials less forthcoming and more secretive 
in their regular meeting with Taiwanese officials and 
academics at Taiwan\'s US representative office. 
 
\"Third, the official counterpart of Taiwan\'s National 
Security Bureau (NSB) is the CIA but on the insistence 
of high officials in the US government, the matter is 
being handled by the State Department. 
 
\"As the case has affected regular diplomatic and 
intelligence-gathering operations, it is possible that 
there will be friction between the diplomatic and 
national security units within Taiwan\'s representative 
office in the US. 
 
\"Fourth, in the short term at least, the morale of 
intelligence agents working with the US will take a 
blow, and their freedom of action may also be more 
constrained. 
 
\"In the investigation of the Keyser case, Taiwan may be 
able to minimize the damage to Taiwan-US relations and 
trust if it faces the matter truthfully, cooperates 
fully with the US, rewards and fairly punishes those 
involved and - most of all - maintains clear lines of 
diplomatic communication. . 
 
\"The Keyser case is different from conventional cases 
of diplomatic or intelligence personnel breaking the 
rules.  Strictly speaking, it is a political case.  Its 
significance depends on how it is considered. 
 
\"I believe the best way to resolve the Keyser case is 
to discover its root cause. 
 
\"That is to say, we should look at the big picture, and 
seek to reverse the decline in Taiwan-US relations of 
the last few years. 
 
\"For example, in meeting the US demand that Taiwan not 
alter the status quo, we must do what we say and not 
try to play word games with the Americans.  In the 
context of US-China-Taiwan relations, we should 
probably take a new tack, implementing policies that 
benefit the US, but also meet our own interests. 
 
\"We must build on our commercial and technical 
strength, seek security assurances from the US and at 
the same time seek parity in our commercial dealings 
with China. .\"

1. (C) Summary: President Chen Shui-bian announced on October 
3 that he will use his October 10 National Day address make a 
\"major statement\" on cross-Strait relations that will serve 
Taiwan\'s long-term security and normalize relations across 
the Taiwan Strait.  Chen pledged to use the speech to respond 
to the PRC\'s May 17 statement on Taiwan policy.  Presidential 
aides say that Chen\'s 10/10 speech will \"go beyond\" his May 
20 inaugural address, and will include concrete assurances 
that Taiwan will not move towards de jure independence.  They 
hope a positive gesture by the president now will help start 
off relations with a consolidated Hu Jintao government on a 
positive footing.  Details of the October 10 text are yet to 
be finalized, but officials promise to keep AIT abreast of 
the process.  End Summary. 
 
Beyond May 20 
------------- 
 
2. (C) President Chen Shui-bian told a group of 
Mainland-based Taiwan business people (Taishang) on October 3 
that he will redouble efforts to create a stable environment 
for cross-Strait relations.  According to a text provided to 
AIT by the Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) before the 
speech, Chen said that his government remains committed to 
moving forward with direct transportation links and renewed 
dialogue in order to build a basis of trust across the Taiwan 
Strait.  Chen said his government\'s main goal is to create an 
environment under which the PRC could achieve its goal of a 
\"peaceful rise\" without upsetting regional stability.  Chen 
reiterated his May 20 formulation that his government would 
not rule out any form of future relationship between Taiwan 
and the Mainland as long as it is acceptable to the Taiwan 
people. 
 
3. (C) In this context, Chen announced that in \"seven days,\" 
he would make an \"important statement\" (zhongyao tanhua) that 
would further Taiwan\'s long-term security interests and help 
\"normalize\" cross-Strait relations.  Chen said that this 
statement would include a response to the PRC\'s May 17 Taiwan 
policy platform (Ref A).  Chen stated that his October 10 
speech would be in the spirit of his May 20 inaugural address 
and would not be influenced by domestic political factors. 
During his October 3 remarks, Chen also made reference to 
Taiwan\'s efforts to strengthen its self-defense capabilities. 
 While warning against harboring \"illusions\" over PRC 
intentions, he stated that Taiwan\'s defense modernization was 
aimed at protecting the island\'s democracy and economic 
growth, not provoking a cross-Strait arms race. 
 
Seizing an Opportunity 
---------------------- 
 
4. (C) Chen advisors say that the president\'s October 10 
speech will aim to provide PRC President Hu Jintao a basis 
for making a reciprocal goodwill gesture during his 
anticipated January speech to mark the 10th anniversary of 
Jiang Zemin\'s \"Eight Points\" on Taiwan policy.  National 
Security Council (NSC) Senior Advisor (and long-time Chen 
senior speechwriter) Lin Jin-chang told AIT that the 
president believes there is a unique opening for improved 
cross-Strait ties in the wake of Jiang\'s sudden departure 
from the Central Military Commission (CMC).  \"He wants to use 
this occasion to mark a \'new beginning\' in relations between 
the two sides,\" Lin remarked.  Lin added that Chen is willing 
to tone down the Democratic Progressive Party\'s (DPP) 
campaign plan for the December legislative election to 
achieve this goal, even if it means losing votes to the 
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). 
 
Direction Set: Devil in the Details 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) NSC Senior Advisor for cross-Strait policy Chen 
Chung-hsin told AIT that while there is agreement over the 
direction for the president\'s October 10 address, the text 
has not been finalized.  Chen said that the president has 
told his staff that he wants to \"go beyond May 20\" in terms 
of tone and substance, but added that there is still an 
ongoing internal discussion over whether to offer specific 
policy proposals or simply send a generalized goodwill 
message.  Chen asserted that the important point will be to 
address the \"first part\" of the May 17 PRC statement, which 
demanded that Taiwan accept \"one China\" and cease Taiwan 
independence activities.  Chen said that finding a workable 
formula on \"one China\" may be difficult, but he is pushing 
hard for the president to borrow language from the 1979 
U.S.-China communique and declare that Taiwan \"acknowledges 
the PRC position that there is but one China and that Taiwan 
is part of China.\"  Chen said that NSC Secretary General 
Chiou I-jen has responded positively to this suggestion, but 
noted that the initiative has not yet been cleared by the 
Presidential Office. 
 
6. (C) Even more important than finding a \"one China\" 
formula, Chen continued, would be for the president to signal 
on October 10 his resolve not to move towards de jure 
independence.  Chen said the president has been concerned 
that recent statements by the premier (Ref B) and Foreign 
Minister may have given Beijing the perception that the DPP 
government is drifting in more extreme directions.  Chen 
asserted that the best way for the president to address this 
concern will be to strengthen his May 20 pledges over future 
constitutional reforms. 
 
7. (C) Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Senior Secretary Jan 
Jyh-horng said that AIT would be kept informed as the text 
draft is firmed up.  Jan expressed hope that the drafting 
process would be done in a more methodical way than President 
Chen\'s October 3 speech text, which was prepared in the span 
of a few hours.  Jan noted that the president was not 
originally scheduled to attend the October 3 dinner hosted by 
the SEF.  It was not until late Saturday evening (October 2) 
that Chen informed MAC Chair Joseph Wu that he wanted to 
deliver the keynote address in Wu\'s place.  Jan said that 
Chen told Wu that he felt the need to personally set the 
record straight following the string of \"confusing\" 
statements made by senior officials in his government. 
 
Comment: Good Intentions, Uncertain Follow-Through 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8. (C) It is encouraging that Chen has decided to seek an 
early opportunity to send a goodwill message to the PRC 
leadership.  However, we will watch carefully how he follows 
through on these good intentions.  In the past, many of 
Chen\'s attempts to send positive signals have been so ill 
crafted as to produce the opposite result.  An over-ambitious 
offer that appears out of line with other recent policies or 
statements is likely to be dismissed by Beijing as a mere PR 
ploy.  Chen will also need to resist the temptation to mix 
his October 10 messages to please different constituencies. 
Chen\'s timing and specific points may prove critically 
important in light of recent indications from travelers to 
Beijing and Hong Kong press reports that the PRC is renewing 
an offer of dialogue.  We will closely follow the drafting 
process over the coming days and encourage the Chen 
government to seize real opportunities if they emerge and 
avoid past pitfalls.

Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason 1.4 b/d 
 
1. (C)  SUMMARY: Taiwan\'s recent change in attitude towards 
making efforts to resolve long-standing bilateral trade 
concerns with the U.S. has led to real improvements in the 
environment for intellectual property protection, 
agricultural trade, telecommunications liberalization, and 
pharmaceutical access requirements, and is about to pay 
dividends in the form of the establishment of a National 
Communications Commission and a data exclusivity regime for 
innovative pharmaceuticals.  Setting a schedule for TIFA 
discussions will reinforce this new \"can do\" attitude. 
Holding out for additional gains risks jeopardizing not only 
Taiwan\'s continued cooperation, but also the influence of 
those responsible for driving the return to engagement on the 
U.S. bilateral trade agenda.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C)  Since Taiwan\'s entry into the WTO in January 2002, 
the US-Taiwan bilateral trade relationship has been marked by 
Taiwan foot dragging on implementation of WTO accession 
commitments and frustration on the part of US policy-makers 
over Taiwan\'s unwillingness to enact promised changes.  In 
August 2003, US Trade Representative Zoellick wrote a letter 
to Premier Yu Shyi-kun, laying out in detail our bilateral 
trade concerns and holding out the promise of high-level 
economic discussions, including resumption of discussions 
under the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), if 
Taiwan could demonstrate it was implementing its commitments 
in IPR, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and telecommunications. 
 Over the past 12 months, Taiwan has made significant 
progress in resolving many of our outstanding bilateral trade 
questions, including significant improvements in the 
enforcement of intellectual property rights, liberalization 
of fixed line telecommunications, and moving to create data 
exclusivity protection for innovative pharmaceuticals and 
establish a workable rice quota regime. 
 
3. (C)  Even more significant than these positive steps is 
what appears to be a sea change in attitude among Taiwan 
officials responsible for trade policy.  The new cabinet, 
inaugurated in May, has moved with heretofore unseen purpose 
and coordination to push difficult changes through both the 
bureaucracy and the Legislative Yuan (LY).  Taiwan officials\' 
cooperation has clearly been motivated by the promise of the 
resumption of high-level trade discussions under the TIFA. 
Taiwan officials view resumption of high-level economic talks 
with the United States (which they hope will lead to a Free 
Trade Agreement) both as a quid pro quo for their efforts to 
make difficult political decisions, and as a political 
strategy to counter their economy\'s growing entanglement with 
China.  We have made clear that restarting TIFA is a 
necessary precondition before the possibility of entering 
negotiations a US/Taiwan FTA could be considered.  Taiwan 
views the possibility of a FTA with the U.S. as the key that 
could unlock closer economic relations with other key 
regional trading partners.  The continued effectiveness of 
key policy makers essential in pushing the bureaucracy to 
address U.S. bilateral trade concerns will be heavily 
influenced by their ability to deliver economic engagement 
with the U.S. (refs H, I) 
 
------------------------------------- 
IPR Environment Dramatically Improved 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U)  AIT has reported extensively on Taiwan government 
actions to improve the IPR climate.  The frequency of 
inspections of Optical Disk (OD) factories continues to 
increase, while the number of infringing goods and equipment 
seized by Taiwan enforcement agencies has dropped to half 
2003 levels.  In December 2003, Taiwan officials, working in 
cooperation with rightsholders and in coordination with other 
enforcement authorities, broke up two major counterfeit 
software manufacturers.  The National Police have increased 
the frequency of their raids against manufacturers and 
sellers of pirated goods, leading to an increase in arrests. 
Four Taiwan enforcement agencies cooperated in the 
investigation, raid, and closure of a major OD counterfeiting 
operation in May that was suspected to account for as much as 
ten percent of illegal OD manufacturing in Taiwan. 
5.  (U)  Shipments of all counterfeit products from Taiwan 
seized by U.S. Customs in FY03 dropped to less than three 
percent of FY02 levels and fell even further in the first 
half of FY04.  After a concerted lobbying campaign by Taiwan 
government officials, Taiwan\'s legislature passed revisions 
to the copyright law that substantively meet the demands of 
U.S. based rightsholders groups for stiffer penalties for 
counterfeiters and protection for technical protection 
measures, adding to amendments from 2003 that made sale of 
counterfeit goods a public crime.  Taiwan has also moved to 
create a specialized IPR court that is scheduled to begin 
operation before the end of 2004. (refs B, C, E, and K) 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Telecom Liberalization in Process - NCC Holding 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (U)  Taiwan\'s Directorate General of Telecommunications 
(DGT) announced in September the opening of a one-month 
bidding period for new entrants into Taiwan\'s fixed line 
telecommunications market.  This is the result of legislation 
passed in December 2003 that mandated liberalization of the 
fixed line market by allowing new entrants to apply for 
licenses to enter the market twice yearly and by 
significantly reducing capital and build-out requirements. 
In December 2003, the legislature also passed a bill 
authorizing the establishment of a National Communications 
Commission modeled on the US FCC.  The implementation bill 
has been held hostage in the legislature by partisan 
wrangling, first over the number and composition of 
commissioners, and more recently over unrelated broadcast 
media licensing requirements.  The executive branch remains 
committed to pushing this bill through at the earliest 
possible opportunity. (refs A, G, and M) 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Pharmaceuticals: Engaging on DE and Validation 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7. (C)  In spite of bureaucratic obstinance and strong 
opposition from local industry, Premier Yu and the Minister 
of Health have forced a bill to protect pharmaceutical data 
through the Ministry of Health and Executive Yuan.  It is now 
awaiting action by the LY Environment and Health Committee. 
The bill provides five years of protection for new chemical 
entities and three years for new indications.  In response to 
industry\'s remaining concerns, the Department of Health has 
privately offered assurances that they will draft 
implementation regulations favorable to innovative 
pharmaceutical manufacturers.  In meetings with 
representatives from PhRMA in June 2004, the Board of Food 
and Drug Administration (BFDA) agreed to consult with 
industry in revising the methodology for determining Risk 
Priority Numbers (RPNs) used to identify companies for 
on-site inspections.  In March, the LY passed legislation 
that substantially increased penalties for manufacturers, 
distributors, and sellers of counterfeit pharmaceutical 
products.  (refs D, F, L, and N) 
 
------------------- 
Rice CSQ,s on Track 
------------------- 
 
8. (SBU)  Taiwan\'s Council of Agriculture (COA) recently 
recommended adopting U.S. supplied draft language on a 
country specific quota (CSQ) system for rice imports on the 
condition that we accept Taiwan\'s high out-of-quota duty rate 
and negotiate with Australia, Thailand, and Egypt on specific 
quota amounts.  Taiwan also agreed to abandon its proposal to 
leave ten percent of public imports open to all countries as 
a \"global quota.\"  U.S. industry reportedly supports further 
discussions in TIFA talks.  Like the other economic 
ministries, Taiwan\'s COA has also recently evidenced a 
greater willingness to work with the U.S. to resolve 
bilateral trade issues.  Implementation of Taiwan\'s rice 
import commitments has dramatically improved.  For example, 
in 2004 no public tenders were cancelled because price bids 
exceeded a COA-imposed ceiling price.  In addition, COA has 
been fully cooperating in efforts to re-open Taiwan\'s market 
to U.S. beef. 
--------------------- 
Time to Engage is Now 
--------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  COMMENT: Taiwan\'s recent willingness to engage on 
our bilateral trade agenda is based on the belief that doing 
so will bring a positive return in the form of renewed 
high-level economic discussions under TIFA.  This 
understanding has been reinforced in our regular meetings 
with all levels of the Taiwan economic policy community. 
Taiwan officials will undoubtedly push for a U.S. commitment 
to future FTA negotiations, but understand that TIFA must 
come first, before any possibility of discussing an FTA can 
be considered.  The suspension of high-level economic 
discussions in 2002 was an effective strategy to force 
Taiwan\'s trade policy bureaucracy to stop basking in the warm 
afterglow of WTO accession and refocus attention on resolving 
U.S. bilateral trade concerns.  But this strategy is reaching 
the limits of its usefulness.  By committing now to a 
schedule for TIFA talks, we can reinforce Taiwan\'s 
willingness to engage and continue to make progress on 
bilateral trade issues, including dismantling non-tariff 
barriers to trade and reaching an agreement on a CSQ for 
rice.  Postponing TIFA discussions would deal a severe blow 
to those in the Taiwan government who have been the most 
forceful advocates of engagement with the U.S. to resolve 
concerns on IPR, pharmaceuticals, rice and telecoms.  Failure 
to deliver engagement with the U.S. will damage or even 
destroy their ability to be helpful in the future.  Now is 
the time to build on the positive momentum of the past 
several months by raising the level of engagement on economic 
issues.

SUBJECT: LATIN AMERICA: TAIWAN TAKES STOCK OF NEW POLITICAL 
ALIGNMENT 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reasons: 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary: MOFA officials are nervous over a string of 
recent political transitions in Latin America.  Over the last 
13 months, 6 of these countries -- Panama El Salvador, the 
Dominican Republic, Haiti, Guatemala, and Paraguay -- have 
seen new governments come to power.  Taiwan is adjusting its 
political and economic carrots to ensure the new governments 
remain committed to recognizing Taipei over Beijing.  MOFA 
officials are particularly concerned over its relationship 
with the new Torrijos government in Panama, despite 
assurances from Panama that it has no intention to 
immediately review its diplomatic ties with Taiwan.  Taipei 
is also worried about Beijing\'s recent use of economic 
pressure to squeeze Paraguay multi-laterally.  In the 
Caribbean, Taiwan initially feared government changes in 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic, but relations with the new 
governments there appear to be firmer than expected.  End 
summary. 
 
Panama Remains Primary Concern 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) With the inauguration of President Torrijos on 
September 1, Taiwan is facing uncertainty from arguably its 
most important diplomatic partner.  MOFA Deputy 
Director-General for Latin America, Wu Chin-mu, told AIT that 
despite President Chen Shui-bian\'s recent visit to Panama, 
Taipei believes the situation in Panama remains clouded.  To 
illustrate his concerns, Wu pointed out that for the first 
time in four years, Panama did not support Taiwan\'s recent 
bid to become a member of the UN on the grounds that the new 
government is reevaluating all foreign policies of the 
previous administration.  Wu expressed skepticism over this 
line, and said he feared that this might be a sign of things 
to come. 
 
3. (C) Wu said that during his September visit, President 
Chen did receive assurances that, at least for the time 
being, Panama will continue to recognize Taipei over Beijing. 
 Wu lamented, however, that the new Torrijos administration 
reportedly criticized its predecessor during the election 
campaign for being too close to Taiwan and pledged that it 
will increase ties to the PRC.  Wu noted that the PRC already 
has approximately $300 million worth in commercial ties with 
Panama and is looking to increase PRC business activities 
there.  Wu had little to offer on what Taiwan was planning to 
do to counter the PRC\'s lobby campaign.  He specifically 
dismissed the idea of working multi-laterally with other 
diplomatic relationships in Central America, such as 
Guatemala and Nicaragua, assessing that such nations have 
little or no influence with the Panamanian Government.  Wu 
did say that Taiwan would like to work more closely with the 
USG to promote Taiwan\'s position in Panama. 
 
Paraguay Also a Focus for the PRC 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Wu told AIT that the PRC is also working on several 
levels to convince Paraguay to de-recognize Taiwan.  For 
instance, Wu noted that Beijing has invited Paraguayan 
legislators and businessmen to the PRC for talks on expanding 
commercial and official ties.  In addition, Wu asserted that 
the PRC is undertaking a public relations campaign in 
Paraguay to influence popular views over its policy toward 
Taiwan.  More troubling, Wu noted, was the PRC\'s attempts to 
use other countries in the region to pressure Paraguay.  Wu 
asserted that during his recent visit to Beijing, Brazilian 
President Luiz Inacio Lula promised to encourage Paraguay to 
switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing in exchange for 
trade concessions from the PRC.  However, Wu remarked that 
because of recent PRC-Brazil trade disputes, Brasilia has 
informed Beijing that Brazil will cease pressuring Paraguay 
to de-recognize Taiwan. 
 
5. (C) Despite alleged PRC-Brazil trade friction, Wu said 
that Taiwan is still concerned over Paraguay\'s ability to 
resist the PRC\'s regional approach.  He noted that the PRC is 
currently linking free trade negotiations with MERCOSUR to 
the Taiwan issue.  Beijing has reportedly warned that 
Paraguay\'s ties to Taiwan are an obstacle to finalizing any 
PRC-MERCOSUR free trade framework.  Regional pressures 
notwithstanding, Wu said Asuncion has recently assured Taiwan 
that they will not change their recognition.  Moreover, Wu 
pointed out that the PRC doesn\'t even have a trade office in 
Paraguay and there are almost no economic ties between the 
two governments. 
 
Caribbean Appears Safe 
---------------------- 
 
6. (C) Wu was relatively less concerned about Taiwan\'s 
diplomatic relationships with the Dominican Republic and 
Haiti.  Wu said Taiwan was pleased with the election of 
Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez.  Wu said that 
President Fernandez is very pro-Taiwan and has visited the 
island several times and almost considers it his second home. 
 President Fernandez has assured Taiwan that he will never 
offer diplomatic relations to Beijing, but has said he will 
try to seek to improve business ties with the PRC. 
Concerning Haiti, Wu admitted that Taipei had been one of the 
few international supporters of the Aristide government. 
After Aristide was removed from power, Taiwan officials were 
worried they would lose recognition with the new government. 
However, Wu told AIT that the new government in Haiti has 
assured Taiwan that they will not change their recognition at 
this time.  Wu noted that Taiwan has various commercial and 
humanitarian aid projects in Haiti and assessed that the 
Haitian Government is presently satisfied with the state of 
the relationship. 
 
Chile as APEC Chair 
------------------- 
 
7. (C) Wu noted that Taiwan has a strong economic 
relationship with Chile and is satisfied with Santiago\'s 
handling of APEC this year.  According to Wu, in terms of 
administration and protocol, everything is being conducted 
exactly how it was by Thailand last year.  Wu said that Chile 
has good relations with both Taiwan and the PRC and it 
usually tries to balance its approach.  He noted that in 
order not to anger Beijing but still give a high level of 
respect to Taiwan, Chile recently sent its Foreign Minister 
to visit Taiwan, but Santiago characterized the visit as an 
APEC mission rather than an official visit. 
 
Strategic Challenge 
------------------- 
 
8. (C) Stepping back from the current state of play, Wu 
lamented that the PRC\'s growing economic power and political 
influence in the world is causing a lot of problems for 
Taiwan.  Wu noted that the PRC is leveraging its new-found 
clout to redouble its efforts to erode Taiwan\'s last bastions 
of international diplomatic influence.  However, Wu assessed 
that Beijing\'s strategy will be counter-productive to its 
real core interests since the more the PRC tries to 
strong-arm Taiwan abroad, the stronger pro-independence 
sentiment will become at home. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Growing public and media scrutiny is making it 
increasingly difficult for Taipei to match Beijing\'s \"check 
book diplomacy\" campaign in Latin America.  The media is 
becoming especially critical of under-the-table payments to 
political parties and foreign leaders, long a mainstay of 
Taiwan\'s diplomatic strategy.  There are already rumors 
circulating Taipei that Nicaragua\'s current President, 
Enrique Bolanos, is looking for the same sorts of direct 
payments from Taiwan previously paid to his predecessor, 
Arnoldo Aleman, who is under house arrest for money 
laundering and embezzlement.  With Beijing apparently now 
willing to use sticks as well as carrots to win over Taiwan\'s 
dwindling diplomatic relationships, Taipei\'s options are 
looking increasingly bleak.

SUBJECT: TAOYUAN FTZ - UNREALISTIC CLAIMS OF PENDING DIRECT 
AIR LINKS 
 
REF: AIT TAIPEI 2997 
 
Classified By: AIT TAIPEI DIRECTOR DOUGLAS H. PAAL, REASONS 1.4 (B/D) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The Taoyuan Free Trade Zone near Taipei,s Chiang 
Kai-shek airport is a key component of Taiwan,s Global 
Logistics Development Plan (reftel).  The Far Glory Group 
will build the FTZ under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) 
contract.  Far Glory plans to invest NT$ 21.3 billion (USD 
636 million) in the project.  However, unrealistic claims 
about cross-Strait links, vague explanations of the special 
benefits of the FTZ, and unwillingness to build to tenants\' 
specifications suggest the project may face difficulties 
finding customers. 
 
Far Glory\'s Big Plans for Taoyuan FTZ 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) The Taiwan government is implementing its Global 
Logistics Development Plan.  In addition to free trade zones 
in Taiwan\'s two largest ports (reported reftel), a third key 
element in the plan is a free trade zone near Taipei\'s Chiang 
Kai-Shek Airport in Taoyuan.  Taiwan\'s Far Glory Group is 
developing the Taoyuan FTZ under a build-operate-transfer 
(BOT) contract with the Taiwan government. 
 
3.  (C) Far Glory is a diversified conglomerate with 
interests in real estate development, construction, tourism 
and insurance.  It also currently operates the Far Glory Air 
Cargo Terminal near Chiang Kai-Shek Airport.  The Taiwan 
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) announced the tender 
for construction of the Taoyuan project in May 2002.  At that 
time it was known as the &Taoyuan Air Cargo Park.8  CAA 
officials tell AIT that about 30 firms placed bids on the 
project.  Far Glory\'s experience in developing the Far Glory 
Air Cargo Terminal helped it win the project.  However, other 
observers have pointed out that Far Glory\'s executives have 
close ties to the Chen Administration.  One source told us 
Far Glory\'s Chairman Chao Teng-hsiung was a member of 
President Chen\'s party on his last trip to Latin America. 
 
4.  (U) According to the BOT contract, Far Glory will build 
and manage the FTZ for 50 years, after which Far Glory will 
turn the FTZ over to the Taiwan government.  Far Glory plans 
to invest a total of NT$ 21.3 billion (USD 636 million) in 
the project and has already spent NT$ 1 billion (USD 30 
million) in the first phase.  A consortium of 10 banks headed 
by Taiwan\'s Chao Tung Bank has invested another NT$ 3 
billion.  Far Glory executives say that the FTZ will target 
the needs of high-tech companies to rapidly produce and 
customize products in response to customer orders. 
 
Shift in Focus, Unrealistic Claims 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Far Glory executives marketing the Taoyuan FTZ have 
made unrealistic claims about what kind of cross-Strait 
access the FTZ will be able to provide.  They have expressed 
confidence that the FTZ will be able to service direct 
aviation links with the Mainland.  In addition, they told AIT 
that Mainland Chinese will be able to stay in the FTZ for up 
to 72 hours without visas or entry permits.  According to MAC 
Department of Economic Affairs Director Fu Don-cheng, the 
Taoyuan FTZ was originally conceived as a zone whose primary 
purpose would be to facilitate cross-Strait links.  It was 
subsequently reformulated as a free trade zone.  This helps 
explain why Far Glory makes these unlikely claims about 
cross-Strait travel and transportation to the FTZ. 
 
6.  (C) Fu and other officials have told AIT that after the 
December Legislative Yuan elections, the Chen Administration 
is likely to move actively toward opening a dialogue with the 
Mainland on direct aviation links.  Even assuming that such 
an opening occurs, it is still optimistic to predict direct 
flights by the projected opening of the Taoyuan FTZ in 
November 2005.  Fu also says that the only travel benefit for 
Mainland Chinese going to the FTZ will be reduced visa 
processing time.  He says that they should be able to acquire 
their visas in less than 10 days compared to the current 
procedures that can take up to a month.  This is very similar 
to proposals under consideration that would be applied to all 
PRC travelers to Taiwan. 
 
7.  (C) Direct links are even more important to the success 
of the Taoyuan FTZ than to the Keelung and Kaohsiung free 
ports.  The additional time and expense of passing through 
Hong Kong or Japan are proportionally smaller for sea 
freight.  In fact, one source tells us that some ships find 
ways to obtain the necessary documentation without actually 
stopping in a third port, for example by having Japanese 
customs officials meet the ship at sea to provide the 
documentation.  For air cargo the extra hours and expense 
imposed by a transit stop are considerable.  In addition, 
Keelung and Kaohsiung Harbors have newly-established offshore 
transshipment centers that allow cargo coming directly from 
the Mainland to be offloaded and loaded in the transshipment 
centers as long as it is then shipped to a third location 
without passing through Taiwan customs. 
Marketing Problems 
------------------ 
 
8.  (C) Although Far Glory has claimed that firms such as IT 
manufacturers Quanta, Asustek and Hewlett-Packard are 
interested in occupying space in the FTZ, the firms 
themselves have yet to publicly express interest.  Quanta 
Group Deputy Spokesman Jason Lin told econoff that Quanta\'s 
interest is not high.  He noted that Quanta\'s manufacturing 
facilities in Taiwan already enjoy many of the benefits of 
the FTZ, including exemption of customs duties on imported 
components that are re-exported and expedited customs 
clearance. 
 
9.  (C) DHL Taiwan Director of Operations Nick Chen pointed 
out that in addition to making unrealistic claims about the 
certainty of cross-Strait access for the FTZ, Far Glory has 
also been vague about other benefits that will be available 
to firms in the FTZ.  Far Glory has not been able to explain 
in detail to potential tenants the customs clearance 
procedures or tax exemptions for the FTZ.  Chen also noted 
that many high-tech firms, including tenants of the Hsinchu 
Science and Technology Park already enjoy similar benefits. 
DHL\'s plan is to wait and see how many other firms move into 
the FTZ.  If there is enough interest by potential DHL 
customers, DHL will consider establishing a facility. 
 
10.  (C) Another potential problem for the Taoyuan FTZ is 
that Far Glory plans to build most of the FTZ facilities 
first and them fill them with tenants, as opposed to a 
build-to-suit approach of identifying tenants and then 
building the facilities they need.  Sharon Hann, marketing 
director for commercial real estate consulting firm NAI 
Taiwan, who has worked with Far Glory on other projects, 
points out that this may be especially problematic for 
high-tech firms, which often have unique specifications for 
manufacturing facilities.  Taiwan Association of Logistics 
Management Secretary General James Cheng explained that this 
type of development approach was one of the mistakes that 
contributed to the failure of the Taisugar Logistics Park 
(reftel). 
 
Comment ) Warning Bells 
----------------------- 
 
11.  (C) Unrealistic claims about cross-Strait links, vague 
explanations of the special benefits of the FTZ, and 
unwillingness to build to tenants\' specifications are all 
troubling signs that Far Glory will not be able to make the 
Taoyuan Free Trade Zone a success.  With projected investment 
of over USD 600 million, the potential losses are high. 
Under the BOT contract, the financial risk borne by the 
Taiwan government may be low, but the prospects for the 
Global Logistics Development are not good.

their own national anthem, or even a flag of their own 
choosing.  This is a strongly self-contradictory 
approach.  Indeed, if the Taiwanese people cannot 
identify with a normal country, for whom are they 
buying so such weaponry and against whom are they 
fighting?  Also, the same article pointed out that the 
United States\' adherence to the One-China policy will 
only reinforce the Communist dictators\' conviction that 
their view of Taiwan is the correct one and that they 
have the inalienable right to decide Taiwan\'s future. 
[What the United States is doing] is to tempt China to 
damage the peace across the Taiwan Strait. 
 
\"We hope [our] American friends can understand with 
their hearts the outspoken statements made by an old 
warrior who has dedicated decades of his life to Taiwan 
and urge the U.S. government to adhere to its 
commitments to democratic and free Taiwan.\" 
 
B) \"[Taiwan Senior Presidential Advisor] K.M. Koo\'s 
Advertisement Displeases the United States\" 
 
Washington correspondent Norman Fu said in the 
\"Washington Outlook\" column of the centrist, pro-status 
quo \"China Times\" (10/6): 
 
\". The Bush administration\'s cross-Strait policy is 
that neither side (meaning Taipei and Beijing) should 
alter the status quo unilaterally.  What is not spoken 
but has been fully understood by everyone is that 
neither can both sides of the Taiwan Strait ask the 
United States to change the status quo - namely, to 
alter or renounce Washington\'s longstanding One-China 
policy. 
 
\"[Beijing\'s Foreign Minister] Lee Zhaoxing told 
[Secretary of State Colin] Powell to his face recently 
that Washington should not let its domestic law 
override an international commitment.  The domestic law 
that Lee referred to is the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). 
It is surprising to see that Koo echoed Lee by pointing 
out that TRA is a domestic law, under which Taiwan has 
neither rights nor any obligations.  Has Koo forgotten 
that Taiwan, under the TRA, enjoys the right of being 
provided with defensive weapons from the United States? 
It is a fact that the TRA is a domestic law of the 
United States.  But Koo is probably the first Taiwanese 
person to directly point out that the TRA is a domestic 
law made in the interests of the United States.  Koo\'s 
tone was so severe that it almost sounded equal to his 
displeasure with the United States\' One-China policy. 
This is really weird logic - given Koo\'s life-long 
efforts dedicated to the push for Taiwan independence, 
he is not supposed to betray his belief and echo the 
`communists\' across the Taiwan Strait!\" 
 
C) \"Taiwan Must Not Overlook the United States\' 
Unpleasant but Honest Advice\" 
 
Washington correspondent Nadia Tsao said in the pro- 
independence \"Liberty Times\" (10/6): 
 
\"Even though Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Richard 
Lawless\' remarks [at a U.S.-Taiwan defense industry 
meeting in Arizona on Taiwan\'s arms procurements] 
sounded a little bit unpleasant, they are vital to 
Taiwan\'s problems. . 
 
\"The United States is the only country in the world 
that is willing to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan. 
Naturally, the price tag offered by Washington for the 
weapons it wants to sell displeases Taiwan and makes it 
feel that it is being controlled by others, and it is 
understandable that the Legislative Yuan wants to 
haggle over the price. .  Lawless\' speech actually did 
not sound fresh to Taiwan.  What\'s new is that it is 
the Americans who are reminding us of that the matter 
concerns Taiwan\'s [very] existence.\" 
 
D) \"Chen Has an Historic Opportunity\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
noted in an editorial (10/6): 
 
\"On Sunday President Chen Shui-bian announced that he 
would deliver an important speech on cross-Strait 
relations on Double Ten Day. . 
 
\"Chen should use this opportunity to clarify some of 
the most urgent issues facing this nation. 
 
\"First, he must clearly and definitely declare Taiwan 
an independent sovereign state. . 
Second, Chen needs to reiterate his determination to 
carry out constitutional reform.  Though most people in 
this country want a new constitution, some people - 
including U.S. officials - still have concerns. . 
Third, Chen should make it clear that cross-strait 
peace must be built upon a military balance of power. 
Since Taiwan doesn\'t want to annex Chinese territory 
but Beijing has repeatedly stressed its aim of annexing 
Taiwan, the people here cannot but ask the government 
to strength national defense and make necessary 
preparations. . 
 
\"Finally, Chen should make clear to Beijing and the 
international community that according to official 
Chinese statistics, as of the end of last year 
Taiwanese businesspeople had invested US$72.3 billion 
in China, making it that country\'s largest foreign 
investor. . 
 
\"This being the case, there is no reason why China 
should wish for Taiwan to downgrade itself into a 
provincial government.  Conducting commerce under the 
`one China\' principle would be political suicide.  It 
is necessary for Beijing to deal rationally with the 
issue of cross-strait commerce. .\"

INTERNATIONAL CATALOG EXHIBITION - KAOHSIUNG, TAIWAN, 
SEPTEMBER 23-24, 2004 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. One hundred and fifty-nine American businesses 
received 555 trade leads as a result of their 
participation in New Products USA Multi-State Catalog 
Show in Kaohsiung on September 23 and 24, 2004.  U.S. 
State participants were pleased with the high quality 
of the attendees as well as the event\'s organization 
and facilities.  Seminars on commercial services, 
effective communication with US companies and promotion 
of US tourism held on the floor of the show greatly 
increased attendee interest and participation.  This 
year\'s event provides valuable information on demand 
for particular merchandise from the southern Taiwan 
market.  End Summary. 
 
Analysis of End-of-Event Survey 
------------------------------- 
 
2. Four states participated in the show: Florida, 
Georgia, Missouri and New Jersey, represented by 
personnel from their economic development agencies.  On 
the End-of-Event Surveys, all State representatives 
indicated they were very satisfied with the service and 
assistance provided by Department of Commerce and the 
Commercial Section at AIT, Kaohsiung Branch. 
 
3. Missouri and New Jersey stated that they \"probably 
would\" participate again while Georgia was neutral, 
marking \"unsure\". On the other hand, Florida thought 
the catalog show was not for the sophisticated Taiwan 
market and marked \"probably would not\" participate in 
the program again. 
 
4. The following comments were written on the End of 
Event Surveys: 
 
\"Thanks a lot for the great help from U.S. Department 
of Commerce and Commercial Section at AIT, Kaohsiung 
office.\" 
 
\"Show traffic was much less than expected.  May be 
catalog show is no longer suitable for the 
sophisticated Taiwan market.  However, the show was 
very well organized.  CS staff in Kaohsiung was very 
helpful and professional.  Thank you all for your 
dedication!!!\" 
 
\"Opening ceremony was very nice.  Short seminars were 
also a good idea to attract a larger attendee group. 
Tourism presentations were also a nice addition and 
opportunity for states in the show as well as those not 
present.  I think it would be beneficial for state 
partners to have country market briefings in each stop 
and one-on-one time with the SCO\'s/local office reps. 
This gives us good local insight to market that we can 
pass on to our companies.  Local staff was very helpful 
and organized and made the show enjoyable!\" 
 
\"Excellent support from the post, the local staff in 
terms of briefing, logistic support (i.g. Copying 
machine on site); etc\" 
 
5. International Trade Specialists Joe Ruland and 
Jennifer Harrington represented some 96 companies 
recruited by DOC from States not otherwise 
participating. 
 
Initial results from State Representatives 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. The State representatives included their trade leads 
on the End-of-Event survey.  State trade lead totals 
were: 
 
State               Leads     Firms     Ratio* 
 
Florida               78      22         3.5 
Georgia               40      10         4.0 
Missouri              52      15         3.5 
New Jersey            55      16         3.4

Total                555      159        3.5 
 
*Ratio equals average leads per company 
Attendance 
---------- 
 
7. Two hundred and six companies pre-registered for the 
event plus twenty-five companies registered on the spot 
and one hundred and eighty local companies, some with 
multiple attendees, meaning a total of 550 visitors, 
attended.  Pre-screening and pre-registration ensured 
high-quality attendees for the American participants. 
The pre-registration process generated substantial 
background information.  Walk-ins were small in number, 
but of excellent quality. 
 
Visitor Reaction 
---------------- 
 
8. Visitors and State representatives alike were 
impressed by the quality of the venue and set-up.  The 
Commercial Section acknowledges the invaluable 
assistance of AIT/K Management Assistant Joe Chao in 
arranging the dcor and making provision for 
representatives to hang their state flags.  Mr. Chao 
received many compliments on this score.  Two copy 
machines were available free of charge to ensure every 
participant had company/product information. 
 
9. Representatives from various trade associations were 
impressed by the quality of the exhibition.  They 
appreciated the time and effort staff of CS Kaohsiung 
had put into organizing the event.  From their personal 
experience, they empathized with AIT/K staff over the 
time and effort it took to deliver a perfect event. 
 
Marketing 
--------- 
 
10. Promotion for the event was targeted and thus 
extremely effective.  Using the CS Kaohsiung updated in- 
house previous attendee list, direct faxes were sent 
via Winfax for direct and cost effective promotion.  CS 
Taipei\'s E-Export Center pitched in to send out 
additional faxes and e-mail notices.  This year, CS 
Kaohsiung enlisted 4 cosponsors from trade 
organizations and paid for additional faxing lists to 
attract more participants.  Cosponsors  Taiwan External 
Trade Development Council (TAITRA), Kaohsiung and 
Tainan Offices; the Kaohsiung City Importers and 
Exporters Association and the Tainan City Importers and 
Exporters Chamber of Commerce notified several thousand 
potential attendees through their extensive databases. 
CS Kaohsiung and the E-Export Center also worked up a 
number of free press articles and calendar event 
listings in newspapers and trade periodicals. 
 
11. CS Kaohsiung sent additional marketing flyers to a 
list of more than 100 industrial and trade related 
associations.  As noted, AIT/K takes great care in the 
pre-screening and registering of potential visitors to 
ensure that attendees were viable and commercial 
contacts.  In light of the evaluations and comments by 
the participating state representatives and the number 
of trade leads generated, this focused approach is 
highly effective in building qualified leads for US 
companies. 
 
Value-added Support from CS Kaohsiung and Taipei 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
12.A press release in English and Chinese was 
disseminated to local media outlets prior to the 
opening.  On September 23, Lin Yun-chien, Deputy Mayor 
of Kaohsiung, Greg Loose, SCO of CS Taiwan, Robert 
Forden, Chief of the American Institute of Taiwan, 
Kaohsiung Branch and Wang Ming-Jer, Director of Taiwan 
External Trade Development Council delivered opening 
remarks and cut the ribbon to mark the formal opening 
of the exhibition.  Before the opening, SCO Loose and 
Branch Chief Forden briefed delegates of the NPUSA2004 
on the Taiwan market.  Attendees were asked to drop 
their business cards in order to win door prizes. 
Business cards thus collected will be valuable tools 
for further contacts follow-up.  In addition, staff of 
CS Kaohsiung designed and conducted an on-site survey 
to collect information on merchandise/products 
specifically sought after by the visitors. 
13. SCO Loose and PCO Harbaugh conducted a seminar 
introducing various commercial services to an audience 
more than fifty.  Commercial Assistant Cally Tsao also 
walked the audience through the website-BuyUSA.Gov step 
by step so the audience would have a better idea of the 
DOC\'s Internet marketplace. In addition, Commercial 
Assistant Wendy Tien from CS Taipei gave a seminar on 
\"How to Effectively Communicate with US Companies\", 
which also drew a big crowd of attendees.  Since 
tourism is one of the categories of the catalog show, 
CS Kaohsiung worked with SeeAmerica Committee of Travel 
Industry Association of America (TIA) in the USA and 
AmCham VisitUSA subcommittee in Taipei,via the 
coordination of CO Richard Craig and Trade Specialist 
Shirley Wang on US tourism promotion.  Representatives 
from the U.S. states of Idaho, Louisiana and Montana 
gave presentations on the wide range of beautiful and 
historic sites in their respective states.  In 
addition, attractive and informative posters, catalogs 
and brochures on tourism in a number of other U.S. 
states were displayed. 
 
14. This wide range of highly informative seminars and 
other activities added value to the show for attendees 
and state representatives alike. As mentioned, one 
state representative wrote in the comment section of 
her survey, \"Opening ceremony was very nice.  Short 
seminars were also a good idea to attract a larger 
attendee group.  Tourism presentations were also a nice 
addition and opportunity for states in the show as well 
as those not present.\"  Bringing these seminars to the 
catalog show increased the level of excitement in the 
room and helped vary the pace of participant traffic to 
State and DOC booths. 
 
15. Staff of AIT Kaohsiung\'s Public Affairs section 
assisted CS Kaohsiung in obtaining media coverage that 
greatly enhanced the visibility of both New Products 
USA and CS Kaohsiung.  The show received coverage in 
six different newspapers, and garnered mention on local 
television news and radio as well. 
 
Market Evaluation 
----------------- 
 
16. Despite all the effort and value-added programs, CS 
Kaohsiung has noticed an obvious decrease in visitors 
and trade leads.  As one state representative honestly 
stated in the comment section of his end-of show 
survey:\" Show traffic was much less than expected.  May 
be catalog show is no longer suitable for the 
sophisticated Taiwan market.\"  On the other hand, CS 
Kaoshiung was pleased to find how many serious and high 
quality commercial contacts came to the show, with most 
expressing enthusiasm to learn more about American 
product lines.  Our conclusion is that niche 
merchandise can still find a market in Taiwan.  CS 
Taiwan will continue bridging all interested parties 
via different commercial programs and will continue to 
consider, utilize and support catalog shows if DOC 
continues to recruit delegates. 
 
17. Visitors to the show expressed greatest interest in 
the categories of industrial and environmental 
equipment.  However, some of them expressed 
disappointment in not seeing more catalogs on heavy 
machinery, raw industrial materials such as steel, wood 
and paper pulp and automatic packaging equipment.  CS 
Kaohsiung will follow up with and assist these visitors 
in finding their needed products.  In addition, CS 
Kaohsiung will forward relevant trade inquiries to 
responsible trade specialists and participating state 
offices.

1. (C) Summary:  AIT Econ delivered ref A talking points to 
BOFT on October 5, and to NSC on October 6.  BOFT reported 
that on September 30, Taiwan Customs stopped two shipments of 
machine tools being shipped by Ching Hwee to \"COSCO 
Logistics\" in Dalian, China (across the bay from North 
Korea). NSC stated that unless there was proof machine tools 
would be used to produce arms, there was no legal basis to 
stop their export.  End Summary. 
 
Shipments Stopped as Result of U.S. Information 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2.  (C) After AIT delivered ref A talking points on October 
5, BOFT reported that on September 30, Taiwan Customs had 
acted on the instructions contained in the BOFT-DGC letter 
reported ref B (Taipei 03051) and stopped two Ching Hwee 
shipments of machine tools leaving Taichung Harbor bound for 
\"COSCO Logistics\" in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, China (a 
major container port just across the bay from North Korea). 
In response to Ching Hwee,s complaints over this action, 
BOFT informed Ching Hwee executives that the action was taken 
due to suspicions that the machine tools were destined for 
North Korea, and for use in arms production.  BOFT explained 
that according to Taiwan,s export control &catch-all8 
provisions, although the machine tools are not on any 
sensitive high-tech commodity (SHTC) list, the possibility 
that the goods could be used in weapons manufacturing made 
them subject to export controls. 
 
Taiwan,s Ching Hwee and North Korea,s Ryonha 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) BOFT noted that Ching Hwee does not export any goods 
on the SHTC list and has never applied for an SHTC permit. 
In fact, according to BOFT,s investigation, Ching Hwee does 
not product any goods at all, but is only a trading company. 
According to BOFT, Ching Hwee has a total capitalization of 
only about US$ 1 million and is owned by four private 
individuals, who also serve as company executives. If true, 
this raises the question of what Ching Hwee would have to 
offer in a joint venture with the Ryonha Company.  BOFT said 
it will continue and deepen its investigation of Ching Hwee 
and compile information on all of the company,s exports and 
imports. 
 
Strange Information 
------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) A quick search of the internet shows that the 
Ryonha Machinery Joint-Venture Company can be contacted 
through its office in Pyongyang, North Korea.  According to 
Taiwan Customs, shipping documents, the Ryonha Company is 
one of the main purchasers of Ching Hwee,s machine tool 
exports.  However, strangely, the Ryonha Company website 
indicates that it manufactures and exports sophisticated CNC, 
electric discharge, and machining center machine tools 
similar to those that it imports from Ching Hwee.  In fact, 
according to press reports, the Ryonha Company exhibits its 
machine tools, which have been certified by the International 
Standards Organization to meet ISO 9002 standards, at an 
international industrial exhibition held in Pyongyang each 
year.  While the Korean letters in the Ryonha name are 
phonetic and without exact Chinese equivalents, the same 
letters are used by Koreans to phoneticize the main Chinese 
character in Dalian.  The name Ryonha could be taken to mean 
&little Dalian.8  If Washington agencies know the Chinese 
characters used to write Ryonha, this information would be 
useful to AIT in further researching the company. 
 
How the United States Can Champion Strict Export Control 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
5.  (C) BOFT indicated they would like to see further 
restrictions on exports of machine tools from Taiwan to North 
Korea, but needed support from the United States in the 
interagency struggle within the Taiwan government. 
Specifically, BOFT repeated its request for information on 
the restrictions that Japan, South Korea, Italy, Germany, and 
other countries place on machine tool exports to North Korea. 
 If these countries restrict machine tool exports to North 
Korea, that would be a strong argument in persuading Taiwan 
agencies to agree to do likewise.  Second, BOFT mentioned the 
P2S5 chemical that was seized earlier this year in Kaohsiung 
at the request of U.S. agencies.  BOFT indicated that U.S. 
assistance in helping to get rid of the stuff would be a 
criterion in determining future cooperation.  BOFT said 
Taiwan,s Environmental Protection had refused to dispose of 
the chemical.  BOFT was unaware if the United States has 
provided instructions on disposal. 
 
NSC Response to Talking Points 
------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) The NSC response to the Ref A talking points on 
delivered on October 6 was cordial, but not as forthcoming. 
In response to the suggestion that Taiwan should stop machine 
tool to North Korea the NSC officials said that there were no 
legal grounds for stopping these shipments.  When AIT 
suggested that Taiwan,s &catch-all8 provisions provided a 
legal basis, NSC officials said even with the products send 
to North Korea, there was no proof the machines were procured 
to produce weapons.  It would be even more difficult to prove 
that shipments to third territories or front companies were 
intended for weapons production.  The NSC officials suggested 
better information sharing with the United States and 
international export control agencies might help address this 
issue of proof.  They seemed interested in attending the 
planned EXBS workshop on export control laws and regulations 
that will be held in Taipei in November. 
 
7.  (C) Comment: Export control is apparently a hotly debated 
issue within the Taiwan government, with BOFT and Customs 
already going well beyond what the NSC sees as the limits of 
current legislation.  AIT believes that providing BOFT with 
the arguments it needs to prevail in the interagency debate 
would be an effective tactic in getting stronger exports 
control in Taiwan.  End comment.

Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced 
October 1 that Academia Sinica Research Fellow David Huang 
would assume the MAC vice chairman position previously held 
by Alexander Huang.  A specialist in European local politics, 
David Huang has no experience in cross-Strait affairs, and 
has never worked outside of academia.  Huang readily admits 
that he knows little about cross-Strait policymaking and the 
role of MAC in this process, but said he took the job as a 
favor to MAC Chairman Joseph Wu.  While a respected political 
scientist in his own right, Huang is perhaps best known for 
being the son of former Central Election Commissioner George 
Huang.  End Summary. 
 
New kid on the block 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) MAC Senior Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san announced 
October 1 the appointment of David Huang (Wei-feng) to fill 
the post of Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) vice chairman most 
recently held by Alexander Huang.  The post is the most 
junior of three vice chairman positions and is responsible 
for Hong Kong, cultural affairs, and liaison with third 
countries.  Huang is currently an associate research fellow 
at Academia Sinica\'s Institute of European and American 
Studies.  Huang told AIT that his appointment is still 
awaiting President Chen Shui-bian\'s approval, but reasoned 
that MAC Chairman Joseph Wu must have secured President 
Chen\'s consent before offering the job to him.  Huang 
admitted that he has no background on cross-Strait issues, 
but he agreed to take the MAC job in order \"to help Joseph.\" 
 
3. (C) A specialist in European electoral behavior with 
degrees from MIT, Cambridge, and Oxford, Huang said that 
working at MAC would be a challenge for him.  Based on the 
briefings he has received from MAC, Huang told AIT that he 
could not determine whether MAC is a driver or merely an 
administrator of Chen\'s cross-Strait policy.  He said that 
MAC appears to be setting its agenda based mainly on public 
opinion polls.  Citing recent MAC polls, Huang said most 
Taiwan residents claim to strongly favor direct air 
transportation links with the Mainland.  However, equally 
large numbers of respondents say they want Taiwan to proceed 
slowly with direct links and express concern about security 
and immigration problems associated with closer ties with the 
Mainland.  Huang exclaimed, \"With that sort of data, how does 
a government formulate policy?\" 
 
4. (C) While Huang said he was still in a learning mode for 
his new job, he did offer personal views on cross-Strait 
policy that generally track with the Chen administration\'s 
stated approach.  Huang said that President Chen\'s offer 
early in his first term to pursue \"political integration\" 
with the PRC was an opportunity for meaningful dialogue. 
Huang said that Chen would be committing political suicide if 
he used the term \"unification,\" thus the integration 
formulation was the best he could do politically.  If Beijing 
had acted on the offer, at least they would have opened the 
door to an institutionalized framework to pursue eventual 
unification, Huang assessed.  Huang added that he believes 
the United States should take a more active role in 
encouraging Taipei and Beijing to come to the negotiating 
table. 
 
Political Family 
---------------- 
 
5. (C) Although Huang has spent his entire career in research 
and has no government experience, he has observed \"hometown 
politics\" first hand as the son of former Central Election 
Commissioner George Huang (Shih-cheng).  The elder Huang is 
among the most astute and successful \"dangwai\" politicians of 
his generation, serving two terms as a non-partisan Changhwa 
County Magistrate during the era of KMT one-party rule. 
(Note: Huang\'s reputation, however, suffered a bruising in 
the sequence of signal switching the CEC sent concerning the 
conduct of the March 20 election and referendums.  End note) 
The younger Huang said his father did not join the KMT 
because of his distaste for the party\'s authoritarian rule 
and because he had his own ideas about how to govern.  George 
Huang\'s \"distaste\" for authoritarian rule, however, did not 
prevent him from befriending one of Chiang Ching-kuo\'s sons 
and forming a \"blood brother\" pact with him.  George Huang 
later won the political patronage of Lee Teng-hui -- some say 
through his sister, reportedly Lee\'s long-time mistress -- 
and has remained close to Lee to this day.  David Huang said 
that his father never shared the DPP\'s ideology or the former 
president\'s pro-independence stance, preferring to focus on 
the practical issues of local governance.  Ironically, the 
elder Huang decided not to cultivate his more 
intellectually-minded son for a political career.  That 
mantle has fallen to David Huang\'s younger sister.  A 
practicing attorney, she is currently running an independent 
campaign for the Legislative Yuan in Changhwa, the family\'s 
powerbase. 
Comment: Amateur Hour 
--------------------- 
6. (C) The 30-something David Huang was tapped for the number 
four slot in the MAC hierarchy after the job had by turned 
down by former People First Party International Affairs 
Director Raymond Wu (Reftel) and at least three other people. 
 Huang\'s appointment is yet another reminder of how thin the 
Pan-Green foreign policy bench is.  Lacking expertise in 
cross-Strait affairs and experience in government, Huang\'s 
main asset was a personal relationship with MAC Chairman Wu, 
a fellow cross-Strait policy neophyte.  While MAC\'s role may 
be only a shadow of what it was under Tsai Ing-wen, the fact 
that Huang will be tasked with explaining a policy he readily 
admits not understanding himself is a reminder that the DPP 
government remains an amateur operation in many ways, even 
after four years in office.

A) \"Disputes between Political Parties Should Not 
Surpass National Security\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" noted in an 
editorial (10/7): 
 
\". Democratic countries normally protect freedom of 
speech, and disputes between political parties are 
normal situations often seen [in democratic countries]. 
But national defense should be an issue of common 
language shared by all the people of the country. . 
Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Richard Lawless\' 
speech underscored [our] American friends\' thorough 
observations and concerns about Taiwan\'s political 
situation.  To protect the lives and property of 23 
million people and to safeguard Taiwan\'s independent 
sovereignty, we urge opposition party leaders to go 
beyond their position [that this is just] a dispute 
between parties and support the special arms budget. 
In this way we can demonstrate to the international 
community the Taiwan people\'s determination to defend 
the island and to show them that Taiwan is an asset 
rather than a liability in the democratic world.\" 
 
B) \"Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Richard Lawless\' 
Remarks Made at an Inappropriate Occasion\" 
 
Journalist Lu Chao-lung commented in the \"My Views\" 
column of the centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
(10/7): 
 
\". Lawless is a Pentagon official in charge of Asia- 
Pacific defense affairs; he also has the authority to 
decide on issues concerning the Pacific Command.  As 
Lawless is well versed in the United States\' military 
deployment in the area, he is trying to remind Taiwan 
of the importance of these arms deals.  He does not 
want to see Taiwan bungle and ruin the Pentagon\'s chess 
game. 
 
\". Lawless\' strongly worded statements of course 
sounded very pleasant to the ears of American defense 
industry businessmen.  What he said was also very true 
based on his duties and responsibilities. 
 
\"Some Taiwan military leaders know Lawless well and 
believe he has a chance for promotion, but some others 
do not think so.  No matter what, there will be a 
personnel reshuffle in the Pentagon after the U.S. 
presidential elections.  Lawless\' severe remarks on 
Taiwan\'s arms purchases have made him a big winner who 
is standing in an advantageous position.\" 
 
C)  \"An Imbalanced U.S. Policy and the Misled Taiwan 
People\" 
 
Journalist Sun Yang-ming said in the conservative, pro- 
unification \"United Daily News\" (10/7): 
 
\".  American sources that know the inside story said a 
balanced U.S. cross-Strait policy would be to `assist 
with Taiwan\'s self-defense capabilities militarily on 
one hand, and on the other hand, urge Taipei to engage 
in a dialogue with Beijing to reduce tensions across 
the Taiwan Strait.\' 
 
\". Under such a concept, the arms procurements 
mentioned by Lawless . merely assumes the types and 
amount of weapons that Taiwan needs under a certain 
circumstance to maintain a balance [across the Taiwan 
Strait].  But it does not represent a political issue, 
such as whether both sides of the Taiwan Strait should 
resume dialogue.  If people only see it from a single 
perspective, they will misinterpret the U.S. policy. . 
 
\"If people inside Taiwan only take one side of the 
story, believing firmly that it represents an overall 
U.S. policy, and start to promote it, it might be false 
and seriously misleading to the Taiwan people.\" 
 
D) \"Taiwan Has Strong Reasons to Hold Its Ground and 
Should Work Together to Speak out in Challenge of the 
International Community; the United States Which Honors 
Freedom of Speech Should Not Question Whether K.M. 
Koo\'s Advertisement Is `Political Means\'\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Taiwan Daily\" editorialized 
(10/7): 
 
\". Senior Presidential Advisor K.M. Koo paid for the 
advertisement out of his own pocket . doesn\'t such a 
move of idealism and enthusiasm deserve support from 
both the ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan?  Just 
as Government Information Office Director-General Lin 
Chia-lung said, the United States is a country that 
honors freedom of speech, [so] it should not `make any 
associations\' regarding Koo\'s advertisement. 
 
\". We believe that the relevant government agencies 
should consider condensing the contents of Koo\'s 
advertisement, printing it out as a position paper, and 
promoting it widely to the international community, [in 
order to] convey the Taiwan people\'s rejection of the 
ignorant and outdated `one-China policy.\'\"

1. (C) Summary: Internal political maneuvering for the 2008 
presidential nomination is increasingly spilling over into 
the cross-Strait and foreign policy arenas.  Premier Yu 
Shyi-kun\'s advocacy of a cross-Strait \"balance of terror\" is 
the latest in a string of unauthorized statements that 
insiders say are aimed at shoring up his position within the 
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).  President Chen Shui-bian 
has publicly rebuked Yu on more than one occasion, but 
observers say he is unlikely to take firmer action against 
either Yu or Vice President Annette Lu for fear of 
unbalancing the competition among the four contenders for 
future DPP leadership.  Chen\'s willingness to award key 
foreign policy posts to followers of Yu and Lu, the clear 
underdogs among the would-be candidates, has greatly 
exacerbated this problem.  DPP moderates hope that Chen will 
exert more control after the December legislative election, 
but many inside the party warn that this situation may 
continue until 2007, when the formal party nomination process 
begins.  End Summary. 
 
Lame Duck or Kingmaker? 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) A string of recent unauthorized statements by Premier 
Yu Shyi-kun and Vice President Annette Lu on cross-Strait and 
foreign policy (Reftels) appear to be an outgrowth of 
President Chen Shui-bian\'s decision to encourage a four-way 
competition between candidates for the DPP\'s 2008 
presidential nomination.  While Presidential Office and 
National Security Council (NSC) officials fume over this lack 
of discipline, they say that President Chen is unlikely to 
curb either Yu or Vice President Lu for internal political 
reasons.  Presidential advisors tell AIT that Chen fears 
that, if a clear front-runner for future leadership emerges 
too early, he will find himself a lame duck early in his 
second term. 
 
3. (C) While most observers believe only Presidential Office 
Secretary General Su Tseng-chang and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank 
 
SIPDIS 
Hsieh have a realistic chance of leading the DPP\'s 2008 
ticket, Chen continues to encourage Yu and Lu to maintain 
aspirations for the presidency.  National Taiwan University 
Professor (and former Mainland Affairs Council Senior Vice 
Chairman) Chen Ming-tong asserted to AIT that \"a four-way 
race is less destabilizing than a two-way race.\"  Chen 
predicted that the president would keep Yu in the running 
until the DPP nominating process opens in 2007.  Presidential 
Office Deputy Secretary General James Huang told AIT that, 
while Yu\'s ignorance of foreign and cross-Strait policies 
make him clearly unqualified for higher office, his control 
over Executive Yuan (EY) resources will keep him in the 
running indefinitely. 
 
Yu: Puppet with Many Masters 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Yu\'s sudden activism on foreign policy came as a 
surprise to many DPP officials, who have longed dismissed the 
premier as a colorless Chen Shui-bian yes-man.  Some 
presidential advisors assess that Yu has fallen under the 
influence of a cadre of hard-line advisors.  NSC Senior 
Advisor for cross-Strait policy Chen Chung-hsin asserted that 
Yu is being fed his lines by Executive Yuan (EY) Secretary 
General Arthur Iap (Ye Guo-xing) and Government Information 
Office (GIO) Director General Lin Chia-lung.  \"Yu is 
completely ignorant about foreign policy,\" the NSC\'s Chen 
asserted, \"Iap and Lin are simply using him as their 
mouthpiece.\"  NSC Staffer and Tsai Ing-wen confidante Chang 
Hsieng-hwei offered a similar assessment, adding that the 
weak-willed Yu provided an easy target for his two aggressive 
advisors.  \"Iap is acting as Yu\'s spine\" she continued, \"and 
Lin as his brain.\" 
 
5. (C) Yu\'s recent references to offensive weapons and 
containing PRC expansionism closely track a policy line 
espoused by the Taiwan Think Tank (TTT), a group created by 
the GIO\'s Lin in 2001 with substantial financial support from 
Chi-mei Electronics Group founder Hsu Wen-lung, a close 
relative of Lin\'s wife.  Taiwan Institute for Economic 
Research (TIER) Vice President David Hong characterized the 
TTT as the intellectual force behind the hard-core \"Taiwan 
first\" school of foreign policy that appears to hold sway 
over the premier and his inner circle.  TTT Foreign Policy 
Studies Director Lai I-chung has told AIT that Taipei\'s 
policy should focus on strengthening cooperation with 
like-minded counterparts in the U.S. executive and 
legislative branches to counter the \"pro-China\" bias of the 
State Department and AIT.  Closer to home, Lai warned that 
the growing power of NSC SecGen Chiou I-jen and his moderate 
New Tide faction threatens to weaken Taiwan\'s resolve to face 
the PRC threat.  The EY\'s Iap has made a similar case in 
conversations with AIT, noting that Taiwan\'s ultimate goal 
should be to serve as the front-line of a U.S.-Japan-Taiwan 
alliance against PRC expansionism. 
 
Lu: Flakes and Fundamentalists 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) While Yu has been more outspoken of late, DPP 
moderates also remain wary of Vice President Annette Lu\'s 
potential to cause mischief by pushing her traditional 
pro-independence fundamentalist ideology.  Many observers see 
the vice president\'s fingerprints on a range of key foreign 
policy appointments, including MAC Chair Joseph Wu, NSC 
Deputy SecGen Parris Chang, Foreign Minister Mark Chen, MOFA 
Policy Chief Yang-huang Mei-shin, Tokyo Representative Ko 
Se-kai, and Deputy TECRO Washington Rep. Joanna Chang.  NSC 
officials tell AIT that the New Tide faction and the vice 
president clashed sharply over leadership appointments at 
both MAC and the NSC after March 20, with Lu prevailing on 
the former and New Tide on the latter (Ref A).  In recent 
weeks, Lu herself has remained relatively quiet (her allies 
in government much less so).  DPP insiders point out that her 
main strategy of late has been to insist on joining the 
president at nearly all of his public events, reportedly 
upsetting a presidential security detail still jumpy after 
the March 19 shooting incident. 
 
Moderates Muted, For Now 
------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Chen\'s apparent indulgence of Yu and Lu has not 
extended to front-runner Su, according to associates of the 
Presidential Secretary General.  Taipei County Magistrate and 
long-time Su lieutenant Lin Hsi-yao told AIT that Chen 
regularly warns Su to keep a low profile, especially when 
dealing with the premier and vice president.  Lin said Su 
feels under enormous pressure in his new post, in part 
because he often disagrees with Chen\'s handling of 
cross-Strait policy and constitutional reform.  \"Su hates 
that Chen keeps changing his tune (bienlai bienqu) on these 
issues,\" Lin asserted, \"but he knows that if Su\'s real views 
were to get back to Chen, Su\'s future would be in jeopardy.\" 
Lin added that, for this reason, AIT should view anything Su 
says in public or private as reflecting the president\'s 
thinking, not his own (Note: Before assuming his current 
post, Su was extremely candid with AIT in his assessment of 
controversial Chen initiatives.  However, he has been much 
more discrete over the past five months, even in private. End 
Note.)  New Tide political strategist and Strait Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) Deputy Secretary General Yen Wan-ching told 
AIT that faction leaders recently moved their weekly strategy 
sessions with Su from his office to a more secure location 
for fear that Chen would find out and suspect Su of 
intriguing. 
 
8. (C) DPP moderates hope that the current situation will 
improve after the December election.  Taipei County\'s Lin 
asserted that the president has clearly tired of Yu\'s 
constant verbal missteps.  He estimated the chances that Yu 
would be replaced in favor of Su in February at over 80 
percent.  The SEF\'s Yen also predicted a shake-up, but he 
said it was too early to say whether it will be Su, or 
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, who will get Yu\'s job.  Like Su, 
Hsieh has kept a low-profile since the election.  However, 
Presidential Office Deputy SecGen Huang was less confident 
about an early turnover in power.  \"It will be hard for the 
president to replace Yu if the DPP does well in the December 
election,\" he assessed, adding that such a move would end 
Yu\'s hopes for future office.  Chunghwa Institute for 
Economic Research (CIER) Vice President Chang Jung-feng, a 
long-time Lee Teng-hui confidante and ex-Chen NSC Deputy 
Secretary General, told AIT that it looked like the four-way 
 
SIPDIS 
race would dominate DPP politics for the next four years. 
Chang said that former President Lee told him on September 27 
that recent events have made him increasingly depressed over 
Taiwan\'s future.  \"All the Pan-Blue thinks about is March 20, 
2004 and all the DPP thinks about is March 22, 2008,\" Chang 
quoted Lee as saying, \"no one is worrying about the real 
challenges facing Taiwan.\" 
 
Healthy Competition or Balance of Terror? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) NTU\'s Chen Ming-tong urged AIT not to worry about the 
emergence of a hard-line faction around the premier or 
fundamentalists like Lu and FM Chen, because their positions 
will be balanced by moderates at the NSC and Presidential 
Office.  \"Just like in the U.S., policy is the result of a 
consultative process among a diverse set of interests,\" Chen 
added.  However, Hakka Affairs Council (HAC) Minister (and 
long-time CSB \"boy scout\") Luo Wen-chia warned AIT that if 
the president does not exert leadership quickly, the 
hard-line and fundamentalist groups, despite their mutual 
dislike for one another, may push policy towards the 
promotion of a hard-edge \"Taiwanese nationalism\" that might 
sooner or later run head-on with the growing trend towards 
Chinese nationalism on the Mainland.  \"If Chinese and 
Taiwanese nationalism clash,\" he added, \"we lose.\"  Luo said 
President Chen still has time to head this off, but to do so, 
Luo added, he will need to exert leadership now, not simply 
remain above the fray. 
 
Comment: Chaos or Calculation? 
------------------------------ 
 
10. (C) While the March 20 election has forced almost 
everyone in the Pan-Blue to acknowledge that leadership 
change is inevitable, President Chen is trying hard to 
manipulate and delay the onset of serious debate within the 
Pan-Green about his successor. He has strong domestic 
political reasons to delay a DPP consensus about his heir 
apparent, and that has apparently made him eager to encourage 
the aspirations of the two weaker competitors for the 2008 
nomination - Yu and Lu - and to tolerate their repeated 
diversions from the policy course he laid out in his 
inaugural address. 
 
11. (C) Chen, however, has acknowledged that he understands 
the costs of these diversions to his cross-Strait and U.S. 
policies, and he and the DPP have shown in the past that they 
know how to close ranks and enforce discipline when they 
choose. This leaves us with only two possible explanations 
for why Chen has been willing to tolerate this rhetorical 
chaos. The first, and perhaps more charitable, is that he 
cares only about winning the December legislative elections, 
and he is convinced once again that he can somehow fix the 
international side-effects after December.  In short, he is 
willing to risk Taiwan\'s security to win greater domestic 
political power.  The second, and more troubling, is that he 
understands and endorses what Yu Shyi-kun, Mark Chen and 
Annette Lu are saying and that he has decided that the best 
way to advance those proposals is to allow them to stretch 
the international envelope.  This enables him to maintain 
deniability in order to avoid an immediate confrontation with 
China or with us.  Given Chen\'s mastery of indirection, we 
are not certain which is his real intent.

Classified By: AIT Deputy Director David Keegan, Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) At a October 6 meeting at his reception house, 
Legislative Yuan (LY) President Wang Jin-pyng told AIT that, 
with the LY expected to recess in November in order to 
release its members for the December 11 election campaign, 
there is not enough time to debate the Chen administration\'s 
proposed budget to purchase advance defense systems. 
 
2. (C) Moreover, Wang pointed out that the cost needs to be 
reduced.  He said that National Defense Minister Lee Jye had 
updated him October 5 on the progress of the negotiations 
between the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense (MND) and 
U.S. Department of Defense.  Wang said that he has told Lee 
that the MND should hold further negotiations on the price 
before the LY reviews the budget to authorize the purchase. 
Wang intends also to discuss the issue further with PFP 
Legislator Lin Yu-fang, DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung, and the 
MND\'s Vice Admiral Lei Kuang-shuh, all of whom accompanied 
Wang to the U.S. in June 2004. 
 
3. (C) Wang emphasized that the position of the KMT has not 
changed since his previous conversation with AIT in July 
2004.  The KMT will support the Special Budget but will 
continue to seek political advantage by fighting over the 
price and details.  When AIT suggested that the LY consider 
taking a \"two step\" approach by approving the proposal first 
then allocating funds at a later time, Wang replied that the 
LY needs to allocate funds at the same time that it approves 
the package. 
 
4. (C) Comment: Wang\'s comments to AIT and his recent public 
statements indicate in fairly clear terms a decision by the 
KMT to postpone consideration of the budget until after the 
December 11 election.  Pan-Blue officials have assured AIT 
that the LY will take positive action on the bill during the 
lame duck session that is expected to run though mid-January. 
 However, MND officials fear that post-election confusion 
within the Pan-Blue camp may force the budget into the first 
session of the next LY which begins in February.  Septel will 
report on Wang\'s assessment of the current political climate.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EINV, EFIN, ECON, TW 
SUBJECT: Taiwan\'s Semiannual BOP Surplus Soaring 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  Taiwan\'s balance of payments (BOP) surplus in the first 
half of 2004 doubled from a year ago to US$24 billion, 
increasing Taiwan\'s foreign exchange (FOREX) reserves to 
US$234.6 billion.  While this sharp increase is unusual, it 
is not likely to continue, and does not presage financial 
problems.  The sharp increase is mainly due to massive bank 
borrowing to meet local corporate demand for foreign 
currency loans.  The loans are being used primarily to 
purchase production inputs for exports, and local banks own 
huge foreign assets roughly equal to the amounts borrowed. 
Taiwan\'s current account (C/A) surplus almost matched 
capital outflows of direct and portfolio investment.  This 
contributed to a weaker NT dollar (NTD) in the second 
quarter.  The second half will likely bring slower export 
expansion and reduce Taiwan\'s C/A surplus.   END SUMMARY. 
 
BOP Surplus Soaring 
------------------- 
 
2.  In the first half of 2004, Taiwan\'s BOP surplus totaled 
US$24.15 billion, more than doubled the surplus for the same 
period of 2003.  Depreciation of the Euro and the Japanese 
yen relative to the US$ reduced the US$ value of Euro- and 
Yen-denominated assets by US$0.67 billion.  Consequently, 
Taiwan\'s FOREX reserves after valuation change increased by 
US$23.5 billion, from US$211.1 billion in December 2003 to 
US$234.6 billion in June 2004. 
 
Banking Sector\'s Huge Borrowing from Abroad 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  According to Chen Yu-shiu, a section chief at the 
Central Bank of China\'s Economic Research Department, banks 
borrowing from abroad to fund foreign currency loans to 
local business firms was a major factor behind the sharp 
increase in Taiwan\'s BOP surplus.  Foreign currency loans 
reached some US$25 billion in the first half of 2004, about 
2.3 times higher than the nearly US$11 billion in the same 
period of 2003.  These foreign currency loans were needed to 
purchase production inputs used to fill surging export 
orders.  In the first six months of this year, Taiwan\'s 
imports have shot up by 35%.  The borrowing contributed to 
the banking sector\'s increased foreign liability from 
US$26.8 billion in December 2003 to US$46.2 billion in June 
2004, while the value of banks\' foreign assets remained at 
US$43.5 billion. 
 
Capital Outflow Weakens NT Dollar 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  In response to Taiwan\'s opening of the stock and bond 
markets to foreign investors in October 2003, large sums of 
foreign capital flowed into the island in the third quarter 
of 2003.  However, political events after Taiwan\'s March 
2004 presidential election, and fluctuations in New York 
Stock Exchange share prices caused mutual fund managers to 
pull out money from Asian markets, including Taiwan. 
Foreign portfolio investors took US$1.2 billion out of 
Taiwan in the second quarter of 2004, reversing an inflow of 
US$7.3 billion in the first quarter, and reducing foreign 
portfolio investors\' cumulative net capital inflow in the 
first half of 2004 to US$6.2 billion, down from US$7.4 
billion a year ago. 
 
5.  The capital outflow weakened the NTD and share prices on 
Taiwan\'s stock market.  The stock market index plunged 25% 
from 7,034 points in early March to 5,316 points in early 
August.  The NTD depreciated 4.3% from NT$32.798 per USD in 
April 2004 to NT$34.199 per USD in late July 2004. 
 
C/A Surplus Offset by Capital Outflow 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  Taiwan\'s current account (C/A) surplus of US$11 billion 
in the first half of 2004 was almost matched by the net 
capital outflow of US$10 billion in direct and portfolio 
investment.  Outbound direct investment in the first half of 
2004 surged 60% from a year ago to US$3.5 billion, 4.6 times 
inbound direct investment of US$0.7 billion.  Outbound 
portfolio investment declined 33% to US$13.5 billion, but 
was still more than twice the inbound portfolio investment. 
 
Sharp Increase in Service Trade Deficit 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7.  Taiwan\'s service trade recorded a US$2.1 billion deficit 
in the first half of 2004, 74% above a year ago.  The 
increased deficit is partly mainly due to more Taiwan 
residents traveling abroad after the fear of SARS (the 
contagious disease) subsided in late 2003.  Passengers 
departing Taiwan in the first half of 2004 totaled 3.7 
million persons, up 66% from a year earlier and 2.7 times 
the number of inbound passengers.  The \"travel account\" 
deficit in the first half of 2004 soared 83% from a year ago 
to US$2.5 billion. 
 
Export Expansion Prompts Imports to Grow Faster 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
8.  Taiwan\'s C/A surplus in the first half of 2004 declined 
23% from a year ago to US$11 billion due to: 1) imports of 
production inputs, and 2) a sharp increase in overseas 
travel.  Imports on fob basis totaled US$74.5 billion, an 
increase of 35% while exports were US$83.5 billion, 25.8% 
greater than a year ago.  The overall BOP trade surplus fell 
by 19% from a year ago to US$9 billion.  The export growth 
increased demand for industrial materials and semi-finished 
goods. 
 
Income from FOREX Reserves Declines 
----------------------------------- 
 
9.  Interest from CBC FOREX reserves has historically kept 
Taiwan\'s \"factor income\" account in surplus. Taiwan\'s FOREX 
reserves are mainly deposited in U.S. and Japan banks, and 
foreign government bonds.  However, a steady decline in 
interest rates in the United States prior to early July 2004 
drove the CBC\'s interest earnings down by 8% to US$5.2 
billion.  According to George Chou, Director General of the 
CBC\'s Foreign Exchange Department, the rate of return for 
Taiwan\'s FOREX reserves in the first half of 2004 averaged 
3.5 - 4.5%, less than the average 5-6% in the past, but 
higher than bank interest. 
 
Prospects 
--------- 
 
10.  Tsai Hung-kun, Deputy Director of the DGBAS\' 
Statistical Bureau, predicts Taiwan\'s C/A surplus will 
likely continue in the second half of 2004 but will decline 
due to slower export expansion.   He expects export growth 
to slow to barely above 10% in the fourth quarter of this 
year and to 7% in 2005.  He also foresees improved cross- 
strait relations resulting from the recently cancelled 
military maneuvers, and expects foreign portfolio investors 
to bring capital back to Taiwan.  Unless fluctuations in 
foreign stock markets prompt a large redemption, this would 
extend the BOP surplus through the second half of 2004, and 
subject the NTD to heavy appreciation pressure.

TAGS: EINV, EFIN, ECON, TW 
SUBJECT: Taiwan Economic Briefing for September 2004 
 
1.  This cable summarizes selected recent economic events in 
Taiwan in September 2004.  Below is a brief table of 
contents: 
 
Para 2 -- Taiwan\'s economic expansion began to slow in the 
third quarter of 2004, but strong exports of iron, steel and 
petrochemicals will sustain healthy GDP growth and low 
unemployment. 
 
Para 3 -- Taiwan\'s balance of payments posted a huge surplus 
in the first half of 2004, mainly due to bank borrowing for 
purchase of production inputs. 
 
Para 4 -- Taiwan\'s Hsinchu Science Park agreed to cooperate 
and pursue commercial opportunities with New Mexico three 
science parks. 
 
Para 5 - Taiwan\'s draft regulations on packaging concern 
U.S. suppliers. 
 
Paras 6 & 7 -- Despite a decline in the first half of 2004, 
bank capital adequacy ratios remain above the Bank of 
International Settlement requirements. 
 
Slowdown in Economic Expansion 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  The rate of Taiwan\'s economic expansion started to slow 
in the third quarter, with slower export and industrial 
production growth during July-August.  Inflationary pressure 
is building as higher oil prices drive up import costs and a 
series of tropical storms drove up food prices.  In early 
October Taiwan\'s Central Bank of China (CBC) raised interest 
rates for the first time in four years as an anti-inflation 
measure.  Further interest rate increases could dampen the 
real estate sector and the entire economy.  Nevertheless, 
strong foreign demand for Taiwan\'s iron, steel, and 
petrochemicals, and expectations for semiconductor and 
liquid crystal display manufacturing to bottom out later in 
2004 give business circles optimism, prompting forecasts of 
real GDP growth above 4.5 percent and unemployment well 
below five percent for 2005.  These trends should be 
positive factors for the ruling party in the legislative 
elections later this year. 
 
Taiwan\'s Balance of Payments Posts Huge Surplus 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3.  Taiwan\'s balance of payments (BOP) surplus in the first 
half of 2004 doubled from a year ago to US$24 billion, 
increasing Taiwan\'s foreign exchange (FOREX) reserves to 
US$234.6 billion.  While this sharp increase is unusual, it 
is not likely to continue, and does not presage financial 
problems.  The sharp increase is mainly due to massive bank 
borrowing to meet local corporate demand for foreign 
currency loans.  The loans are being used primarily to 
purchase production inputs for exports, and local banks own 
foreign assets roughly equal to the amounts borrowed. 
Taiwan\'s current account (C/A) surplus almost matched 
capital outflows of direct and portfolio investment.  The 
second half of 2004 will likely bring slower export 
expansion and reduce Taiwan\'s C/A surplus. 
 
Cooperation between U.S.-Taiwan Science Parks 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  On August 26, the Deputy Director General of Taiwan\'s 
Hsinchu Science Park and representatives of three science 
parks in New Mexico signed a memorandum of cooperation aimed 
at encouraging the development of the smaller New Mexico 
parks and creating opportunities for commercial cooperation 
between tenants of the Hsinchu park and tenants of the New 
Mexico parks.  Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, who visited 
the Hsinchu park in December 2003, facilitated the 
agreement.  The U.S. parks hope to learn from the experience 
and success of the Hsinchu park, which was established in 
1980 and is now home to 370 high tech firms whose exports 
accounts for 30-35 percent of Taiwan\'s total exports. 
 
New Regulation Against \"Excessive\" Packaging 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  In July, Taiwan\'s Environmental Protection 
Administration (TEPA) introduced a draft regulation against 
\"excessive\" packaging.  While TEPA claims local industry 
supports the proposed legislation, foreign industry 
representatives are strongly opposed.  AIT has persuaded 
TEPA to submit the legislation to WTO for comment, and to 
extend the time-line for finalizing the legislation.  AIT 
ESTOFF has discussed this issue with AmCham, COSTCO and ECCT 
leadership.  Based on those discussions, AmCham and ECCT 
will host a meeting with some of the more proactive industry 
reps. 
 
Taiwan Bank Health 
------------------ 
 
6.  Taiwan banks reported a slight decline in capital 
adequacy ratio from 10.07 percent to 10.01 percent in the 
first half of 2004, still above the eight percent minimum 
set by the Bank for International Settlements.  Central bank 
officials attributed decline in the capital adequacy to 
Taiwan banks\' massive write-offs of bad debt over the past 
five years and to a significant increase in bank loans as 
the economy rapidly expanded over the past year.  Meanwhile, 
the bad debt write-off drove down Taiwan banks\' average non- 
performing loan (NPL) ratio, using internationally accepted 
measures, from a double-digit level in early 2002 to below 
five percent in June 2004. 
 
7.  Despite the improvement, Taiwan\'s Financial Supervisory 
Commission (FSC) continued to strengthen supervision of the 
banking sector.  The FSC has drafted revisions to the 
Deposit Insurance Statute that will authorize the Central 
Deposit Insurance Corporation to take over any financial 
institutions with a capital adequacy ratio of under two 
percent.  The bill requires troubled financial institutions 
to pay extra insurance charges on top of normal premiums to 
further encourage banks to maintain a prudent lending policy 
and protect against insolvency.

SUBJECT:  TAIWAN\'S NEW PACKAGING RULE:  INDUSTRY WORKING ON 
COMMENTS 
 
 
A) TAIPEI 02673 
 
1.  Summary. In July 2004, Taiwan\'s Environmental Protection 
Administration (TEPA) introduced a draft rule to limit 
excessive packaging.  Foreign industry representatives are 
strongly opposed to the rule.  As reported in reftel, AIT 
persuaded TEPA to postpone its implementation (originally 
scheduled for September 2004) to early 2005 and to submit 
the proposed legislation to WTO for comment.  AIT has now 
also persuaded foreign industry representatives to respond 
to TEPA\'s efforts to address their concerns by preparing 
constructive comments, which include concrete examples of 
the current draft rule\'s potential negative impacts to trade 
and clear recommendations of how the rule should be amended. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  Following TEPA\'s willingness to slow down the rule- 
making process to allow for meaningful consultations with 
foreign business interests and trading partners, AmCham and 
ECCT members held a meetinga  with some of the more 
proactive industry representatives including:  COSTCO, 
Wellcome (the largest foreign supermarket chain in Taiwan), 
Proctor and Gamble, Channel and Diagio on October 5.   AIT\'s 
Economic, Agricultural and Commercial Sections all had 
representatives at the meeting.  The business members forged 
a clear strategy and plan to respond to TEPA\'s request for 
comments.   They agreed to look at the most egregious cases 
of packaging waste that, if eliminated, would benefit the 
environment with minimal impacts to trade.   They agreed 
they would support a rule banning them.  They also agreed 
they needed to articulate for TEPA the legitimate uses of 
packaging that would be undermined by the proposed rule as 
currently drafted. 
 
3.  To this end, COSTCO and Wellcome agreed to provide 
examples of the range of products that might no longer be 
available to Taiwan consumers if the rule went into effect 
as currently drafted.   Channel and P&G agreed to highlight 
some of the serious problems the draft rule poses to the 
cosmetics industry.  Gillette will draft comments on how the 
regulation might undermine some of the health and safety 
benefits of packaging, Diagio agreed to draft the comments 
on behalf of the alcohol and beverage industry.   The 
business members further agreed that, in addition to 
providing specific examples of how the rule could harm 
business interests, they also would provide recommendations 
for amendments to the rule that would address their 
concerns. 
 
4.  The various industries committed to provide their 
comments to AmCham and ECCT within the next few weeks. 
AmCham and ECCT will work together to prepare a presentation 
for TEPA in a month or so. 
 
5.  AIT has learned that TEPA intends to issue the second 
draft of the rule, which is not expected to be drastically 
different than the current draft, next week.  TEPA has told 
AIT it will wait until it has responded to comments on its 
second draft before submitting the rule to WTO for comment. 
AIT will meet with TEPA, inform them that foreign industry 
representatives are preparing comments, and request that at 
least a month be allowed to comment on the draft rule.

\"America, Please Sign Again a Joint Defense Treaty 
[with Taiwan] If [You] See Taiwan as a `Partner\'\" 
 
Chen Charng-ven, a professor of law in Taipei, said in 
an op-ed in the conservative, pro-unification \"United 
Daily News\" (10/7): 
 
\". The writer can fully understand [Deputy 
Undersecretary of Defense Richard] Lawless\' position in 
maintaining the United States\' and Taiwan\'s interests. 
But his speech deserves more thorough consideration 
when it is the taxpayers of Taiwan who have to pay the 
bills from the arms deals. 
 
\"First, [is it true that] if the special arms budget 
fails to pass, it will signify that Taiwan pays no 
attention to its national security?  The NT$610 billion 
arms deal does not necessarily equal national security. 
[Taiwan\'s] national security hinges on its goodwill 
gestures to maintain peace, its orderly administration 
of domestic affairs, its people\'s self-confidence and 
also the development of mainland China; it does not 
necessarily rely on its arms procurements. . The best 
example is the former Soviet Union, which collapsed 
partly because of its excessive dedication to military 
buildups without recognizing its limits.  Also, the 
weapons that Taiwan plans to buy from the United States 
do not certainly guarantee [complete satisfaction of] 
Taiwan\'s `national security\' needs. 
 
\"Second, [is it true that] the United States and `other 
countries\' will doubt Taiwan\'s commitment toward its 
own national defense should the budget fail to pass? 
The writer is very curious: what other countries, in 
addition to the United States, are concerned about 
Taiwan\'s security?  In fact, Lawless\' statement just 
underscored one thing, namely, Taiwan and the United 
States no longer shares a joint defense treaty, and the 
United States has no obligations under international 
law to defend Taiwan.  If Lawless can truly represent 
Washington by saying that `the U.S. government will 
stand firmly as the backing for Taiwan\'s self-defense\' 
and if Washington is really interested in being 
Taiwan\'s partner, [we hope that] Washington could re- 
sign a joint defense treaty with Taiwan and guarantee 
the security of Taiwan as a `partner.\'  If the United 
States is willing to do so, it may be worthwhile for 
the taxpayers in Taiwan to pay NT$610 billion or even 
more money for our security. .\"

SUBJECT: DEADLY ENTEROVIRUS STRAIN STRIKES U.S. CITIZEN IN 
TAIWAN 
 
1.  Summary.  AIT/T in cooperation with AIT/K has been 
following the incidence of the infectious disease 
enterovirus, which has thus far claimed 4 lives in Taiwan 
this year.  While this year, the disease appears less 
prevalent than in some recent years past, it has caught 
AIT\'s attention as one of its four victims was a U.S. 
citizen.  Discussions with Taiwan\'s Center for Disease 
Control (TCDC) suggest this year\'s outbreak appears 
contained and not a cause for undue alarm.  End Summary. 
 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
2. Enterovirus, more commonly known as hand, foot and mouth 
disease (HFMD), is a common illness of infants and children. 
It is rarely fatal in most places in the world.  However, 
Taiwan has had outbreaks of a particularly virulent strain 
called eEnterovirus 71 (E71), which has led to fatalities 
every year since 1998. 
 
3. Taiwan has followed the incidence of enterovirus very 
closely ever since 1998 when it experienced a major outbreak 
of the disease.  In 1998, the disease resulted in 78 deaths. 
In 1999, the disease claimed 9 lives, in 2000, it claimed 41 
lives, in 2001, it claimed 58 lives, in 2002 it claimed 30 
lives and in 2003 it claimed 8 lives. 
 
4.  Taiwan\'s enterovirus 71 cases have tended to be 
concentrated in the central and southern parts of Taiwan and 
among babies under the age of one.  According to TCDC\'s 
monitoring record, the outbreak usually starts in mid-March 
and reaches the peak between late May and early June.   It 
usually subsides during summer when schools are out and then 
increases again in September. 
 
5.  So far in 2004, a total of 89 enterovirus cases have 
been reported to TCDC.  Twenty eight of the cases have been 
confirmed as enterovirus.  Four of the cases have resulted 
in death.  Of the 28 confirmed cases, six were in Taichung 
County (one death), four in Taichung City, three in Changhua 
County, one in Miaoli County and one in Nantou County. 
There have been eight cases in southern Taiwan: three in 
Tainan County (one death), two in Pingtung County (one 
death), and one each in Kaohsiung county, Kaohsiung city and 
Tainan City.   There have also been five cases in northern 
Taiwan, two in Taipei County and three in Taoyuan County 
(one death).  Thus far, there have been no reported cases 
from Taipei.  Most of the deaths have been confirmed as 
Enterovirus 71. 
 
Outlook Cautiously Optimistic 
----------------------------- 
 
6. On September 29, 2004, AIT/K was informed that a nine- 
month old U.S. citizen, residing in Southern Taiwan\'s 
Pingtung County, had died of enterovirus.  Subsequently, 
AIT/T and AIT/K both contacted their respective TCDC 
contacts to obtain an update on the enterovirus threat. 
Although little consolation to the family of the Amcit 
victim or the other infant victims this year, TCDC officials 
stress that the four deaths among a total of 28 confirmed 
cases through September 27 this year compares favorably with 
the 60 confirmed cases and six deaths Taiwan had experienced 
during the same period in 2003.  While they continue to 
monitor closely the incidence of enterovirus, TCDC officials 
told us that this year\'s outbreak appears relatively 
controlled and do not believe it is cause for undue alarm. 
AIT/T and AIT/K will continue to monitor the situation and 
keep Washington apprised if this year\'s outbreak of 
enterovirus in Taiwan appears to worsen significantly.

SUBJECT: CHEN 10/10 SPEECH OFFERS CONCILIATORY MESSAGE 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Deputy Director David J. Keegan, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: President Chen Shui-bian used his October 10 
National Day speech to send conciliatory messages to Beijing 
and opposition supporters in Taiwan.  Chen reiterated a 
number of cross-Strait related themes from his May 20 
inaugural address and proposed restarting dialogue with 
Beijing \"on the basis of the 1992 meeting in Hong Kong.\" 
Chen\'s positive overtures on dialogue, enhanced trade 
relations, and a reduction of military tensions were tempered 
by his warning that the \"forces of darkness\" across the 
Taiwan Strait have aimed more than 600 missiles at Taiwan. 
He then used that warning to call for strengthening 
self-defense.  Chen also made a strong pitch for Taiwan\'s 
entry into the United Nations and other international fora, 
blaming PRC diplomatic pressure for pushing Taiwan\'s people 
further away from the Mainland.  On the domestic front, Chen 
appealed for ethnic harmony and political unity.  Chen barely 
mentioned plans for constitutional revision after the 
December Legislative Yuan (LY) elections.  End Summary. 
 
May 20, Part II 
--------------- 
 
2. (SBU) President Chen Shui-bian\'s October 10 National Day 
speech mixed conciliatory gestures to Beijing and opposition 
parties with appeals to Taiwan pride and calls for 
international recognition.  Almost a third of the speech 
related to the future of cross-Strait relations.  Chen 
reiterated a number of his May 20 inaugural themes, including 
his commitment not to rule out any form of future political 
relationship between the \"ROC and PRC or China and Taiwan.\" 
He also emphasized that he would not deviate from his May 20 
commitments during his term in office.  Chen announced that 
he would convene his proposed Committee for Cross-Strait 
Peace and Stability after the December LY election and 
include leaders from all political parties.  He also restated 
post-election plans to move forward on the \"constitutional 
reform project\" and other \"national policy issues that are of 
vital importance to the people.\" 
 
Overtures: The 1992 Formula and Direct Links 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Chen asserted that recent leadership changes in PRC 
offered a new opportunity for progress in cross-Strait 
relations.  Targeting this new leadership, Chen invited the 
PRC to restart dialogue with Taiwan \"on the basis of the 1992 
meeting in Hong Kong.\"  This was the most explicit 
endorsement he has yet given to the formula used to 
facilitate cross-Strait dialogue in 1992, when both sides in 
effect agreed not to challenge the other\'s definition of \"one 
China.\"  Chen characterized the 1992 arrangement as \"not 
necessarily perfect but acceptable\" as a framework for future 
dialogue. 
 
4. (SBU) Chen\'s speech also suggested specific areas for 
possible cooperation, including direct cross-Strait passenger 
and cargo charter flights.  Chen put the charter flight 
proposal in the context of an emerging new economic 
relationship between the two sides that will take advantage 
of a \"division of labor in the global supply chain.\"  Chen 
also called on the two sides to reduce military tensions 
across the Strait.  Noting his own decision to cancel 
September \"Han-kuang\" military exercises, Chen stated that if 
the two sides could exercise self-restraint in the near term, 
it would pave the way for future discussions on terminating 
the current state of hostilities.  Chen said that negotiation 
of a \"Code of Conduct across the Taiwan Strait\" should be set 
as the long-term goal for both sides. 
 
Warnings: Sha Zukang and other \"Forces of Darkness\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5. (SBU) Chen\'s offer for dialogue with the new leadership in 
Beijing was tempered by strong warnings over the threat of 
PRC diplomatic and military intimidation.  Chen disputed the 
PRC\'s claim to represent Taiwan in the United Nations and 
stated that Beijing\'s diplomatic pressure was driving the 
people on the two sides of the Strait further apart.  Without 
citing PRC Ambassador to Geneva Sha Zukang by name, Chen 
recited Sha\'s well-known \"nobody cares about you\" insult to 
Taiwan reporters after Taipei\'s failed 2003 bid for World 
Health Organization (WHO) observership to illustrate the 
Beijing\'s \"flagrant attitude.\" 
 
6. (SBU) To reinforce the need for upgrading Taiwan\'s 
self-defense capabilities, Chen also warned his people about 
the dangers posed by the \"forces of darkness\" across the 
Strait.  Chen said the 600 ballistic missiles pointed at 
Taiwan represented a \"shadow of terror\" that neither Taiwan 
nor the international community could afford to ignore.  Chen 
added that these \"forces of darkness\" and \"shadows of terror\" 
threatened both the peaceful status quo in the Taiwan Strait 
and the security of the region and the world. 
 
Domestic Appeal: \"The Republic of China Is Taiwan\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
7. (SBU) Chen declared that the \"Republic of China is Taiwan, 
and Taiwan is the Republic of China\" in the context of a 
domestic appeal for unity.  Chen told the audience that it 
did not matter whether an individual identifies with \"Taiwan 
or the Republic of China, per se, any such professed 
expression of national identity is a testament to one\'s 
loyalty to this country.\"  Chen promised that he and his 
party would make a candid self-reflection on the issue of 
identity and ethnicity.  At the same time, he urged others 
not to dwell upon the \"victory or defeat of each election\" 
and instead seize new opportunities for rebuilding solidarity. 
 
Comment: Something for Everybody 
-------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Chen\'s speech addressed a wide range of often 
contradictory themes and audiences.  His references to the 
\"1992 Hong Kong\" formula and reducing military tensions were 
clearly meant to be the headliners for Beijing.  At the same 
time, Chen\'s warning about the growing PRC military threat 
was calibrated to strengthen the government\'s case for early 
LY action on the USD 18 billion special defense procurement 
budget.  Similarly, Chen\'s appeals to Taiwan pride and 
greater international recognition likely targeted his own 
base, while his focus on the \"ROC\" and ethnic unity aimed at 
opposition supporters.  Rhetoric about the \"forces of 
darkness\" notwithstanding, Chen\'s 1992 formula should offer 
Beijing some  opening to respond positively, if and when it 
chooses to do so.  Officials in Taipei tell us they will wait 
for Beijing\'s response before deciding on further possible 
concessions to get around the \"one China\" deadlock.

SUBJECT: TITAS 2004 Focuses on Facing 2005: 
Regional Textile Manufacturers\' Differ in Strategy 
 
 
1. Summary. The Taipei International Textile & 
Apparel Show 2004 (TITAS 2004) kicked off on 
September 21.  280 domestic/foreign companies 
participated in the three-day event.  Aside from 
the exhibition, 13 seminars by various agencies 
including the American Apparel Producers\' Network 
(AAPN), Jockey International Inc., Vietnam Textile 
and Apparel Association (VTAA), Karnali Cashmere 
Industries and Trade Card, discussed improvement 
in supply-chain management, customer relations, 
product research and development trends, and 
strategies for facing the elimination of the 
Multifiber Agreement.    End summary. 
 
TITAS 2004: Bigger than Ever 
---------------------------- 
 
2. TITAS 2004, the premier textile trade show in 
Taiwan, was held at the Taipei World Trade Center, 
September 21-23.  Participation in this year\'s 
event was up over 20 percent from 2003. 
 
3. Two hundred ten domestic, 18 foreign, 24 PRC 
based textile manufacturers and 28 related 
domestic/foreign associations sponsored 550 booths 
in the 2004 show.  In 2003, there were 420 booths 
for 182 manufacturers and related agencies. 
 
4. Fifty-one percent of the exhibitors represented 
the apparel and garment industry, 8 percent were 
home/furniture textile related, 36 percent were 
technical/engineered textile related, and the rest 
were associated products/services such as 
designers, media, inspection & certification 
agencies and planning and consulting companies. 
 
5. 18,402 people attended this year\'s event, a 
twenty percent increase over 2003.  Ninety-one 
percent represented domestic industries and nine 
percent were foreign visitors.  In 2003, the ratio 
was ninety-four percent and six percent 
respectively. 
 
Seminars Discuss Boosting Competitiveness 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. Exhibitors from different regions tended to 
focus on different aspects of the textile trade to 
boost their competitiveness.  U.S. manufacturers 
were focused on brand and wholesale management 
strategies, Central-America countries were 
interested in production investment input, Taiwan 
manufacturers prioritized upgrading product 
quality, and Chinese companies are looking to 
strengthen market channels. 
 
7. In a seminar titled \"The Changing American 
Apparel Industry\", Mr. Mike Todaro from the 
American Apparel Producers\' Network (AAPN) pointed 
out the importance of price, supply-chain and the 
instant message.  His message was that the origin 
of production is no longer important, price is now 
the crucial factor.  Todaro predicted that 
companies with their own brands and markets must 
streamline their supply chains.  Whoever owns the 
most powerful and efficient supply chain will have 
the competitive advantage.  Companies also need to 
cut short the distance between themselves and the 
customers by providing better and quicker 
services, such as on-line services. 
 
8. Mr. Brad Beal from Jockey International Inc., 
in the seminar \"Executing a Successful Central 
American Business Plan\", pointed out the 
advantages of investing in Central America in 
anticipation of the Central America Free Trade 
Agreement (CAFTA).  Investors will be able to 
increase the speed of receiving raw materials and 
accessing the U.S. market.  According to Beal, 
cost competitiveness and worker efficiency in 
Central America also appeal to manufacturers. 
Beal emphasized that manufacturers in Central 
America are heading toward what he called the 
\"full packaging\" stage, including tightening the 
supply chain and moving closer to markets. 
 
9. In a discussion on \"Branded Clothing from 
China\", Ms. Chia Hwa from Pei King E-Wan Garment 
Co., Mr. Chen Kuan Chan from Chuan Guen Gran 
Garment Co., and Mr. Chu Gan-ching from Pei King 
Chen Pei Technology Co. shared their experiences 
of establishing brands and opening markets in 
China.  They emphasized the importance of market 
orientation, interaction with employees and 
customers, and service packaging (after service, 
special-day gifts, anniversary booklets). 
Regional Differences as Manufacturers Prepare for 
Lifting of MFA 
 
10.  COMENT:  According to seminar participants, 
global manufacturers are pursuing different 
strategies to strengthen their market position in 
preparation for the lifting of textile quotas in 
January 2005.  Those companies that have their own 
brands are trying to cut down production time and 
cost by centralizing suppliers and shortening 
supply chains.  They also seek to build closer 
relationships with their customers so they can be 
more responsive to consumers needs.  Asian and 
Central American textile manufacturers are 
shifting production lines to places with lower raw 
material and labor costs, as long as time to 
market is not compromised. 
 
11.  Manufacturers in Taiwan and China appear to 
be adopting very different strategies in the face 
of a seismic shift in the textile industry. 
Taiwan based companies are focusing on product 
development and upgrading in an attempt to remain 
competitive in the global market, but have done 
little to develop their own brands or build 
relations with end users.  Chinese companies, 
conversely, seem to be paying little attention to 
product quality but are focused on branding and 
marketing, especially within the Chinese domestic 
market.

Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Taiwan officials tried to put a positive spin 
on the PRC Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) reported rejection of 
President Chen Shui-bian\'s October 10 inaugural address. 
National Security Council (NSC) and Mainland Affairs Council 
(MAC) officials say that TAO Spokesman Zhang Mingqing\'s 
statement largely mirrored the PRC\'s May 17 Taiwan policy 
line and signaled that \"the door to dialogue remains closed, 
but not necessarily locked.\"  MAC Senior Vice Chairman Chiu 
Tai-san told reporters that the TAO spokesman\'s October 13 
remarks would not alter Taipei\'s commitment to easing 
cross-Strait tensions.  Officials admit that President Chen\'s 
assertion on October 10 that \"the Republic of China is 
Taiwan\" likely provoked the negative PRC statement, but claim 
that Chen needed to emphasize Taiwan\'s sovereignty to avoid a 
domestic backlash to his \"1992 Framework\" offer.  One senior 
presidential advisor downplayed the significance of the PRC 
reaction, asserting that Chen\'s real audience on October 10 
was Washington, not Beijing.  End Summary. 
 
TAO Rejects 10/10 Message 
------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Taiwan officials responded cautiously to media reports 
about PRC TAO Spokesman Zhang Mingqing\'s rejection of 
President Chen\'s 10/10 speech.  NSC Senior Advisor for 
cross-Strait policy Chen Chung-hsin told AIT that Zhang\'s 
remarks were, in substance, largely a reiteration of the May 
17 PRC policy statement on Taiwan.  Chen stated that Zhang\'s 
comments suggested that \"the door to dialogue remains closed, 
but not necessarily locked.\"  MAC Planning Bureau Chief Chang 
Shu-ti offered a similar assessment, noting that Zhang 
responded to most questions during the TAO press conference 
with established policy formulations.  Chang said that the 
similarities between the October 13 TAO press conference and 
the May 17 policy statement may indicate that the PRC 
leadership remains in an observation mode awaiting the 
outcome of elections in the United States and Taiwan. 
 
Self-Inflicted Wound? 
--------------------- 
 
3. (C) Chen administration officials say that the negative 
tone of the October 13 TAO statement was likely provoked by 
the president\'s emphasis on the sovereignty of the \"ROC\" and 
its 23 million people during his 10/10 speech.  The NSC\'s 
Chen said that he fully understands why the PRC would be 
\"allergic\" to the president\'s \"ROC equals Taiwan\" 
formulation, but added that he is also sympathetic to the 
domestic political pressures the president faces from within 
his own camp.  Chen said he hoped that Beijing would 
understand that, just as they have to make aggressive noises 
towards Taiwan to satisfy their own hard-liners, President 
Chen needs to also address his own fundamentalist base. 
\"Perhaps this is wishful thinking,\" Chen added, \"but I hope 
they can differentiate between what is meant for them and 
what is for domestic consumption.\" 
 
4. (C) Executive Yuan (EY) Research, Development, and 
Evaluation Council (RDEC) Vice Minister Chen Chun-lin put a 
slightly different spin on the president\'s sovereignty 
formula, asserting that the PRC should understand that Taiwan 
also has its \"bottom line.\"  \"Beijing needs to realize that 
we are ready to talk,\" he stated, \"but only if they accept 
that we are an equal partner, not a local government.\"  Chen 
added that if Beijing\'s precondition is that Taiwan accepts 
that it is part of Beijing\'s \"one China,\" no president will 
be able to gain the necessary public support to open a 
political dialogue. 
 
Taiwan Response: Patient and Maybe Even Unified 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (C) The NSC\'s Chen said that the Chen administration will 
remain low-key on the TAO statement to see how things evolve 
over the coming weeks.  When asked about the October 13 TAO 
comments, MAC Senior Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san told 
reporters that Taiwan would continue to send positive signals 
to Beijing to show Taipei\'s sincerity.  Chiu said that Taiwan 
did not expect Beijing to immediately accept Chen\'s overtures 
and promised that Taipei would give Beijing more time to 
consider ways forward.  A MAC press release issued later in 
the day offered a similar message, and reiterated an October 
11 offer to initiate talks on two-way direct charter flights 
for the Chinese New Year.  MAC Planning Bureau Chief Chang 
told AIT that Taipei will continue to pursue the New Year 
charter plan, despite the TAO\'s reiteration that any 
cross-Strait links be considered domestic in nature.  Chang 
asserted that Taipei is prepared to authorize private 
entities to negotiate two-way charter flights, but said that 
MAC would not explicitly announce this until there was some 
signal from Beijing that talks on the subject may be possible. 
 
6. (C) The NSC\'s Chen told AIT that the immediate challenge 
facing the government is to get everyone back on the same 
page.  Chen complained that Premier Yu Shyi-kun and MAC 
Chairman Joseph Wu should not have engaged in rhetorical 
debates with opposition legislators over the existence of a 
\"1992 consensus\" in the days following the president\'s 10/10 
speech.  Immediately after the October 13 TAO press 
conference, Chen said he personally called EY Spokesman Chen 
Chi-mai and MAC Chair Wu to ensure that everyone used the 
same talking points in their public comments. 
 
7. (C) While NSC and MAC officials search for small signs of 
flexibility from Beijing, Presidential Office Deputy 
Secretary General James Huang told AIT that the major 
 
SIPDIS 
objective of President Chen\'s speech -- satisfying Washington 
-- had already been achieved.  Huang said that whether or not 
Beijing wants to talk to Taiwan is of secondary importance. 
\"That\'s their decision,\" he asserted, \"our main concern is 
reassuring the United States that we are trying to be 
constructive.\"  Huang dismissed the domestic political debate 
over the \"1992 consensus\" that arose from Chen\'s 10/10 
speech.  \"His reference to a \'1992 Framework\' had nothing to 
do with any \'92 consensus,\" Huang stated, \"he used the 1992 
formulation to respond to (EAP) Assistant Secretary Kelly\'s 
April 21 description of the cross-Strait situation that 
existed in 1992.\" 
 
Comment: Mixed Messaging Strikes Again 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) President Chen\'s decision to use the same speech to 
achieve contradictory policy goals scuttled an important 
opportunity for cross-Strait progress yet again.  It is not 
clear whether this was his intention to start with, 
carelessness, or simply force of habit.  It is certainly 
consistent with his past behavior.  In any event, it appears 
from the October 13 TAO statement that Beijing has chosen, 
unsurprisingly, to focus on the portion of the speech Chen\'s 
aides say they were supposed to ignore.  Given the negative 
tone of Beijing\'s public reaction to 10/10, we are not as 
optimistic as officials here that the PRC will reopen the 
door to contacts on New Year charters and other forms of 
dialogue any time soon.

1.  SUMMARY:  LOCAL PRESS REPORTED ON OCTOBER 2 
THAT THE TAICHUNG PROSECUTORS\' OFFICE RAIDED NINE 
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
TAIWAN, SEIZING OVER 2.5 MILLION COUNTERFEIT DRUG 
PILLS, INCLUDING VIAGRA, REDUCTIL, AND STILNOX, 
AND ARRESTING FOUR SUSPECTS, INCLUDING ONE 
LICENSED PHARMACIST.   SUBSEQUENT REPORTS FROM 
INDUSTRY PUT THE FIGURES AT LESS THAN ONE MILLION 
TABLETS TOTAL, INCLUDING 146,000 VIAGRA TABLETS. 
INITIAL PRESS REPORTS OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE 
SEIZED COUNTERFEIT PHARMACEUTICALS ARE CLEARLY 
EXAGGERATED, BUT THIS SEIZURE IS STILL THE LARGEST 
IN TAIWAN THIS YEAR WITH A MARKET VALUE OF SEVERAL 
MILLION US DOLLARS.  THE SUSPECTS FACE CHARGES OF 
VIOLATING TRADEMARK LAW AND THE NEW PHARMACEUTICAL 
AFFAIRS LAW.  AMENDMENTS TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL LAW 
IN MARCH 2004 INCREASED PENALTIES FOR 
COUNTERFEITERS AND DISTRIBUTORS BUT THE DETERRENT 
VALUE OF THE NEW LAW REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
A SUCCESS, BUT NOT AS BIG AS ADVERTISED 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  AFTER RECEIVING A TIP FROM AN INFORMER IN JUNE 
2004, THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION BUREAU 
(MJIB) BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION OF A GROUP PRODUCING 
AND SELLING COUNTERFEIT PHARMACEUTICALS.  ON 
OCTOBER 2, THE TAICHUNG PROSECUTOR\'S OFFICE LED AN 
EIGHTY-MEMBER TASK FORCE ON RAIDS OF NINE 
SUSPECTED PACKAGING HOUSES, PRINTING FACTORIES, 
WAREHOUSES, AND DRUG STORES IN TAICHUNG, MIAOLI, 
AND KAOHSIUNG.  LOCAL PRESS REPORTED THAT THE TASK 
FORCE HAD SEIZED 2.5 MILLION COUNTERFEIT PILLS, 
VALUED AT NT$320 MILLION (US$9.4 MILLION) FROM A 
WAREHOUSE IN TAICHUNG AND ARRESTED FOUR SUSPECTS, 
INCLUDING A LICENSED PHARMACIST AND A 
PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTOR.  INDUSTRY 
REPRESENTATIVES WERE LATER TOLD BY INVESTIGATORS 
THAT THE INITIAL ESTIMATES HAD EXAGGERATED THE 
TOTAL AMOUNT SEIZED AND THAT THE ACTUAL FIGURE WAS 
LESS THAN ONE MILLION TABLETS. 
 
MAINLAND PRODUCTION WITH TAIWAN PACKAGING? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE THE COUNTERFEITING RING 
WAS PRODUCING FAKE PILLS IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE AND 
THEN SMUGGLING THEM INTO TAIWAN BY CONTAINER OR 
FISHING VESSEL FOR PACKAGING AND DISTRIBUTION. 
THE QUALITY OF PACKAGING IS REPORTEDLY EXCELLENT, 
WITH EVEN INDUSTRY INSIDERS UNABLE TO READILY SPOT 
THE FAKES.  INDUSTRY SOURCES SAY THE 
COUNTERFEITERS WERE USING PACKAGING RESEMBLING 
LOCAL TAIWAN PACKAGING AND ASIAN REGIONAL 
PACKAGING, PERHAPS HOPING TO PASS THEIR 
COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS OFF AS PARALLEL IMPORTS. 
 
DISTRIBUTION THROUGH DRUG STORES AND NIGHT MARKETS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4.  UNLIKE SOME OTHER COUNTERFEITING GROUPS WHICH 
SELL PRODUCTS THROUGH MAIL ORDER OR THROUGH A 
WEBSITE, THIS GROUP WAS ALLEGEDLY DISTRIBUTING 
COUNTERFEIT MEDICINES THROUGH TRADITIONAL DRUG 
STORES AND VENDERS IN NIGHT MARKETS.  ACCORDING TO 
PRESS REPORTS, THE COUNTERFEIT PHARMACEUTICALS 
WERE SELLING AT ABOUT A TWENTY PERCENT DISCOUNT TO 
THE REAL PRODUCT.  WIDELY CIRCULATED REPORTS THAT 
THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN THE COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS 
WERE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE LEGITIMATE 
PRODUCT WERE DENIED BY INDUSTRY AND THE MJIB. 
 
INCREASED PENALTIES FOR PHARMA COUNTERFEITING 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  IN MARCH 2004, TAIWAN\'S LEGISLATIVE YUAN 
AMENDED THE PHARMACEUTICAL AFFAIRS LAW TO CREATE A 
STIFFER PENALTY FOR PHARMACEUTICAL COUNTERFEITING 
AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF COUNTERFEIT DRUGS. 
MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS OF COUNTERFEIT 
PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS NOW FACE THE POSSIBILITY 
OF A JAIL SENTENCE OF UP TO TEN YEARS (INCREASED 
FROM SEVEN YEARS UNDER THE PREVIOUS LAW), AND A 
FINE OF UP TO NT$10 MILLION (US$300,000), UP FROM 
NT$150,000 (US$4500).  THE SALE, DISTRIBUTION 
STORAGE, OR DISPENSING OF COUNTERFEIT 
PHARMACEUTICALS WILL BE PUNISHED BY JAIL SENTENCE 
OF UP TO SEVEN YEARS (INCREASED FROM FIVE YEARS) 
AND FINE OF UP TO NT$5 MILLION (US$150,000). 
(REFTEL) 
 
DISTRIBUTION AND ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  INDUSTRY EXPERTS BELIEVE COUNTERFEIT OR 
PARALLEL IMPORTED MEDICINES MAY ACCOUNT FOR UP TO 
TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF TAIWAN\'S PHARMACEUTICAL 
SALES.  ONE EXPERT SUGGESTED THAT TAIWAN\'S 
COUNTERFEIT PHARMACEUTICAL PROBLEM IS PARTLY THE 
RESULT OF A POORLY REGULATED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. 
PHARMACIES REPORTEDLY OFTEN PURCHASE MEDICINES 
FROM UNKNOWN WHOLESALERS OR SALESMEN WITHOUT 
REVIEWING THEIR BONA FIDES.  IN ADDITION TO A 
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THAT ENCOURAGES SALES OF 
COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS, CONFUSION OVER WHICH AGENCY 
SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCEMENT OF TAIWAN\'S 
ANTI-COUNTERFEITING LAWS CONTRIBUTES TO THE 
PREVALENCE OF BOGUS MEDICINES.  THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HEALTH (DOH) AND LOCAL HEALTH BRANCHES, NOT THE 
TAIWAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE (TIPO)OR MJIB, 
ARE CHARGED WITH ENFORCEMENT OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL 
LAW.  HOWEVER, THESE HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS LACK THE 
WILL AND THE ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITY NECESSARY TO 
CRACK DOWN ON PHARMACEUTICAL COUNTERFEITING. 
 
 
POSITIVE COOPERATION, BUT STILL WAITING ON RESULTS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
7.  COMMENT: RESEARCH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS 
TELL US THEY ARE PLEASED WITH THE COOPERATION WITH 
THE MJIB THAT LED TO THESE RAIDS AND THE RESULTING 
SEIZURES AND ARRESTS.  HOWEVER, THEY CAUTION THAT 
ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION MUST BE COMPLETED, 
ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE UNDERGROUND PRINTING 
OPERATIONS, BEFORE THEY CAN DECLARE THIS AN 
UNMITIGATED SUCCESS.  RAIDS BY MJIB IN JULY OF 
PHARMACIES STOCKING COUNTERFEIT PHARMACEUTICALS 
ALSO LED TO SEVERAL ARRESTS, BUT INDICTMENTS ARE 
STILL PENDING.  THIS CASE WILL PROVIDE ANOTHER 
TEST OF THE ABILITY OF THE NEW PHARMACEUTICAL LAW 
TO DETER COUNTERFEITING AND DISCOURAGE RETAILERS 
FROM STOCKING FAKE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS 
PRODUCTS.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: PRESIDENT CHEN\'S NATIONAL DAY 
SPEECH 
 
 
A) \"China\'s Taiwan Affairs Office Fails to Accommodate 
President Chen Shui-bian\'s Soft Landing\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
editorialized (10/14): 
 
\". Judged from various angles, the statements issued by 
China\'s Taiwan Affairs Office\'s Wednesday were already 
tantamount to a political showdown.  Beijing seems to 
say that unless President Chen acknowledges the `one 
China\' principle and thus establishes a political 
premise, it would be meaningless to discuss any future 
issues concerning both sides, including the three 
links, direct charter flights and other interactions 
across the Taiwan Strait - meaning that the door would 
be closed for any cross-Strait discussions. 
 
\"President Chen\'s reference to the `1992 Hong Kong 
meeting as the basis\' [for re-opening cross-Strait 
talks] shows that he is also clearly aware that the 
`1992 consensus\' is the key to resuming cross-Strait 
interaction and that he hopes Beijing could accept his 
`synonym\' to improve on the impasse caused by `one 
China.\'  But Beijing has refused to accept Chen\'s 
attempt to use `1992 Hong Kong meeting\' to replace the 
`1992 consensus\' in exchange for a `soft landing.\' 
Beijing even made a tighter definition [of the `1992 
meeting\'] and directly called Chen `deceptive.\'  For 
Beijing, the three direct links and charter flights are 
no longer its priorities now, and the `one China\' has 
become a political premise that allows no [other]. .\" 
 
B) \"Chen Uses the United States\' `Patience 
Recommendation\' to Wait for Ice to Melt [Across the 
Taiwan Strait]\" 
 
Journalist Lo Chia-wei noted in the conservative, pro- 
independence \"United Daily News\" (10/14): 
 
\". President Chen, in response to China\'s Taiwan 
Affairs Office\'s remarks, said `the United States has 
told us to be patient.\'  Chen\'s words have offered a 
good beginning for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to 
`put aside their disputes.\'  There may be a chance for 
improvements in the cross-Strait situation next spring 
if Taiwan\'s goodwill gestures can last beyond the 
legislative elections and Beijing can act in a softer 
manner . .\" 
 
C) \"To Concentrate Taiwan People\'s `General Will.\'\" 
 
DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung said in an op-ed in the 
centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" (10/14): 
 
\"It is not unexpected that China\'s Taiwan Affairs 
Office would harshly criticize President Chen\'s 
National Day speech.  On the surface, it seems that 
negotiations and reconciliation between the two sides 
of the Taiwan Strait are in the indefinite future.  But 
for Taiwan, now is the best chance for us to work out a 
consensus among ourselves. . 
 
\"Even though Chen\'s speech has failed to win a goodwill 
response from Beijing, it still has indicative 
significance in coordinating the disputes inside Taiwan 
regarding unification and independence.  The president 
has maximized the possible forms for the future 
development of cross-Strait relations - namely, except 
for Taiwan independence, there are other options like 
forming a federation, confederation, commonwealth, or 
even a unified one-China framework.  All of these can 
cover the majority views held by the Taiwan people. 
Chen\'s move proves that he has broken the blockade of 
the fundamentalists regarding cross-Strait issues and 
has returned to the pragmatic central route.\" 
 
D) \"Taiwan, Mainland on a Collision Course\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" said in an editorial (10/14): 
 
\". By offering to use the 1992 meeting instead of the 
1992 consensus as the model for resumed talks, 
President Chen was in fact denying there was such a 
consensus. 
 
\"The `one China principle,\' which implies that both 
Taiwan and the mainland are apart of China, was the 
basis for cross-Strait talks.  The Chen administration 
has been unwilling to acknowledge that there was any 
such consensus because it runs counter to the ruling 
party\'s pro-independence stance. 
 
\"The present predicament makes the prospects for cross- 
strait peace rather dim.  The ruling DPP and its allies 
are determined to bring Taiwan independence to reality. 
Even some political opponents of the `green\' camp, 
believing that this can win them more grassroot 
support, tend to support the independence campaign. 
 
\"The trend is putting Taiwan and the mainland on a 
collision course.  Beijing will by no means tolerate 
the declaration of statehood by the Taipei government. 
It will do everything possible, including the use of 
military force, to thwart the movement of Taiwan toward 
independence.\" 
 
\"Tension in the Taiwan Strait will in all likelihood 
rise further as the independence advocates aggressively 
push for the accomplishment of their goal and the 
Beijing government make intense efforts to stop them. 
The future of Taiwan has become highly unpredictable, 
with the possibility of the outbreak of war growing 
steadily.\" 
 
E) \"The One China Myth Is the Source of Sadness for the 
Taiwan People\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" editorialized 
(10/14): 
 
\". Today, China has made it very clear that only by 
sticking to the one China principle can both sides 
resume talks.  The one China principle is a synonym for 
`annexing Taiwan.\'  Therefore the Pan-Blue politicians 
in Taiwan should cut off their links with the one-China 
principle, identify with Taiwan and accept democracy, 
or they will only bring Taiwan towards the tragic 
ending of war.  Taiwan\'s elected leader should also 
stop wasting his effort in dealing with China 
meaninglessly.  The only right way is to assert 
Taiwan\'s identity and seek a way out for the 23 million 
people.\"

PRESIDENT CHEN\'S OVERTURE 
 
 
1. U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations 
 
\"The Remarks about Coming to Help Defend Taiwan in 12 
Days\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" said in an 
editorial (10/14): 
 
\"Legislator Lee Wen-chung said a high-ranking U.S. 
defense official has given him a guarantee that so long 
as Taiwan buys defensive weapons [from the United 
States], U.S. carrier battle groups will arrive in the 
Taiwan Strait if Taiwan can resist an attack for at 
least 12 days. 
 
\"The remark about coming to help defend Taiwan in 12 
days sounds [like he is using too conservative a time- 
frame].  The United States\' Seventh Fleet has a carrier 
battle group stationed at Japan\'s Yokosuka port, which 
could rush to Taiwan\'s rescue in two days and nights. 
Besides, there are B-52 heavy bombers stationed in 
Guam, too, which could fly to the Taiwan Strait in a 
few hours.  What really matters is that the United 
States\' fundamental position is very clear: the Taiwan 
Straits\' status quo must be maintained. 
 
\"If Taiwan did not do anything but Beijing used force 
against Taiwan, the United States, without a doubt, 
would send its troops to help defend Taiwan.  And it 
would not take 12 days.  The troops would definitely 
arrive in 48 hours.  It would be another story, 
however, if Taiwan plays with fire.  The United States 
is a democratic country, and it requires U.S. 
congressional support for issues like the dispatch of 
troops to fight Beijing.  If Taiwan plays with fire and 
thereby triggers a war, the answer would be very 
obvious as to whether U.S. congressmen would agree to 
sacrifice the lives of American soldiers [for Taiwan]. 
. 
 
\"Surely Taiwan needs to purchase essential defensive 
weapons to defend itself.  But the purchase of 
defensive weapons should not be made as a provocative 
move, nor should it be used in exchange for an 
impractical `guarantee.\'\" 
 
2. President Chen\'s Overture 
 
A) \"China\'s Inflexibility Blocks Progress\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
editorialized (10/15): 
 
\". But what political dispute is left between the two 
sides once Taiwan accepts `one China\' and negotiates on 
that basis?  In view of [Beijing\'s Taiwan Affairs 
Office Spokesman] Zhang\'s usual rhetoric, it is clear 
that China isn\'t ready to deal with Taiwan in any 
manner until Taiwan acknowledges that it is part of 
China.  This was, of course, not the first time that 
Beijing has rejected goodwill gestures made by Taiwan. 
Under the circumstances, one cannot help but wonder: 
why should Taiwan bother to extend an olive branch to 
China?\" 
 
B) \"President Chen Needs to Review His Beijing Policy\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" editorialized (10/15): 
 
\". Chen\'s mainland policy could be divided into two 
aspects: strategic and tactical.  At the tactical 
level, he often used cross-strait relations as a tool 
to gain electoral advantage, manipulating various 
methods contingent on the needs of different elections. 
. 
 
\"At the strategic level, Chen\'s cross-strait policy 
could be summarized into one of using legitimacy to 
protect illegitimacy.  Under this strategy, the 
legitimate status of the ROC would be used as a cover 
to promote an independence agenda. . 
 
\"But by this time President Chen must have realized he 
cannot continue a pro-independence policy without 
provoking a strong backlash from Beijing.  He now may 
have to examine carefully whether such a mighty 
neighbor who has repeatedly threatened to smash any 
moves by Taiwan to change its political status. .\"

Classified By: AIT Deputy Director David Keegan, Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Legislative Yuan (LY) President Wang Jin-pyng 
told AIT that he expects the Pan-Blue to maintain its LY 
majority despite the PFP\'s declining popularity.  Wang 
projected that there would be virtually no change in the 
balance between the two camps from the 2001 election.  Wang 
downplayed prospects that the KMT and PFP would complete 
their merger before the December LY election.  He told AIT 
that given the acrimonious relations between all the parties, 
constructive debate on legislation pending before the LY, 
including the supplemental defense budget, will be difficult. 
 Wang\'s prediction that the Pan-Blue will prevail may reflect 
more his hope to remain speaker than it does cold political 
realities.  End Summary. 
 
December LY Election 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) Commenting on each party\'s prospects in the December 
11 LY election, Wang told AIT October 6 that he thought the 
DPP would win 86 of 225 elected seats.  The TSU, Wang said 
would win 15-16 seats, giving the Pan-Green alliance 101-102 
seats in the next LY session.  Wang estimated that the KMT 
would win 76-78 seats (including four from the New Party). 
He was less optimistic about the PFP\'s election prospects. 
Wang initially predicted that the PFP would gain 46 seats. 
Then in the same breath, he revised this number down to 43, 
thought for a moment, and changed the number to 35.  After 
more thought, he settled on 38-39, as the number of seats he 
expected the PFP to win, giving the Pan-Blue 114-117 seats. 
Wang pointed out that even if the Pan-Green were to win 
another 4 seats, the Pan-Blue would still be the largest camp 
with 110-113 seats.  Wang said that he expected that a few 
pro-Blue independents would give the Blue a working majority. 
 
Bad time for multi-partisan cooperation 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Wang told AIT that he was also trying to heal the 
growing rift between the KMT and PFP but many KMT legislators 
saw the PFP\'s decline in the polls as being beneficial to 
their election prospects.  Wang could not explain why KMT 
elders, such as former Premier Lee Huan, had been attacking 
PFP Chairman James Soong in the press.  As the currently 
situation stands, Wang said he did not expect a KMT-PFP 
merger before the December election. 
 
4. (C) Wang said the relations between all the parties are 
extremely acrimonious at the moment, which has made 
coordination and cooperation on legislation pending before 
the LY very difficult.  He cited the special defense 
procurement budget as an example (Reftel).  He also 
complained that the Presidential Office is trying to taint 
his reputation within the Pan-Blue by creating an impression 
that he is colluding with the DPP on various issues and 
fronts.  He said that those rumors had made it difficult for 
him to operate effectively within the KMT.  When asked about 
the effect of local media reports about his meeting with 
former President Lee Teng-hui, Wang evaded the question and 
said that Lee cannot abide Chen Shui-bian and called those 
meetings to rant about Chen. 
 
Comment: Silent as an oyster 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Throughout the conversation Wang was clearly measuring 
each word and impression like the skilled backroom machine 
politician he has long been.  In response to rumors that he 
has \"green bones\" and has been working with Chen Shui-bian 
and Lee Teng-hui, and to questions about his role within the 
KMT, Wang was as guarded as ever.  As usual, he attacked Chen 
and the Presidential Office for efforts to undermine him, and 
even complained that they were tapping his telephones and 
conversations. 
 
6. (C) Wang\'s assessment of the Pan-Blue\'s election prospects 
appear to be on the optimistic end, giving his side about 
four percentage points higher than what other political 
observers are estimating.  While most observers agree that a 
major shift in LY balance is unlikely, Wang\'s numbers assume 
that voters disillusioned with the PFP would automatically 
shift their support to the KMT.  The estimate may be even 
more unrealistic, given the almost total lack of a Pan-Blue 
election strategy, a subject we will address septel. 
However, since Wang\'s own political future hinges on the 
Pan-Blue maintaining a majority so that he can remain 
speaker, it is not surprising that he would see the cup more 
than half full.

SUBJECT: FUGITIVE COUNTY MAGISTRATE STILL MISSING 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Deputy Director David J. Keegan, Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Yunlin County Magistrate Chang Jung-Wei 
disappeared on August 14, shortly after questions were raised 
about his involvement in a local bribery scandal.  He was 
later declared a fugitive after ignoring repeated summonses 
from prosecutors.  Chang claims he is the victim of a 
vendetta by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government 
over his support for the opposition during the 2004 
presidential election.  Most observers dismiss Chang\'s claims 
of political persecution, noting his past brushes with the 
law.  Chang\'s disappearance will likely be a major issue in 
the upcoming legislative election campaign in Yunlin, which 
will pit Chang\'s sister against his secretary and the county 
councilwoman who exposed the scandal.  The Chang affair is 
typical of the sort of specific local issues that may 
determine the results of the December election.  End Summary. 
 
From Magistrate to Fugitive 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Yunlin County, a rural politically divided district on 
the west coast of south central Taiwan, has a well-earned 
reputation for corruption, money politics and organized 
crime.  KMT County Magistrate Chang Jung-Wei is no exception. 
 On August 13, as part of an investigation into a bribery 
scandal involving the construction of an incinerator in 
Linnei township, Yunlin prosecutors raided both the office 
and residence of the Magistrate.  On August 16, he was 
summoned by prosecutors for questioning, but failed to 
appear.  After he ignored additional summonses, a warrant for 
his arrest was issued on August 23 and he was officially 
declared a fugitive.  On August 26, Taiwan\'s High Court 
upheld a separate conviction against Chang for vote-buying in 
his 1994 election for County Council Speaker, sentencing him 
to 12 months of imprisonment.  To date his whereabouts are 
still unknown, although Chang has given several private 
interviews to local newspapers over the past two months to 
dispel rumors that he has fled to China. 
 
3. (U) The investigation began in June, when Yunlin 
prosecutors received an anonymous tip from a local resident 
that Yunlin government officials, including Chang, had 
accepted a large bribe to approve construction on the Linnei 
Incinerator.  Eight contractors and government officials, 
including Linnei Mayor Chen Ho-Shan were brought in for 
questioning.  Chen admitted in July that he had accepted 
NT$18 million ($530,000) in \"commissions\" from construction 
companies to ensure that contracts would be awarded to them. 
Bank records, however, indicated that over NT$90 million 
($2.7 million) was missing from funds meant to purchase land 
for the incinerator, leading the prosecutors to look at other 
possible suspects, including Magistrate Chang. 
 
Chang: Corrupt Polluter? 
------------------------ 
 
4. (U) The incinerator project has been a flash point of 
controversy ever since Chang proposed it in November 2000. 
Local residents, led by DPP Legislative Yuan (LY) Member Su 
Chi-Fen and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) County Councilwoman 
Yin Ling-Ying, opposed its location just 1.8 km from an 
open-air water treatment facility on public health grounds. 
Yin made repeated attempts over the years to bring the 
incinerator case to court, citing financial irregularities 
and suspicious business practices in the plans for 
construction and operation of the plant.  The incinerator 
issue is the latest incident in a long-running battle between 
Yin and Chang.  In 1999, Yin called in support from the 
international environmental community to fight a 
land-excavation project initiated by Chang that would have 
destroyed the natural habitat of the endangered fairy pitta 
bird.  (Note: Yin is running in the December LY election. 
The DPP\'s Su is not running for re-election this year, but is 
expected to run for County Magistrate next year.  End Note.) 
 
Or Victim of Political Persecution 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Chang has denied all charges and claims to be the 
victim of political persecution.  In newspaper interviews, he 
has said the investigation is being used by the present 
administration to punish him for his outspoken campaigning on 
behalf of the Pan-Blue Lien-Soong ticket during the March 
presidential election.  He claims to have gone into hiding 
because he fears he will be imprisoned for political reasons 
before he can have his day in court.  His sister, Chang 
Li-Shan, held a press conference shortly after his 
disappearance to allege that Tsai Chi-Wen, the prosecutor in 
charge of the case, had close ties to DPP Legislator Su. 
Other allies of Chang on the County Council have attempted to 
discredit the investigation by suggesting that the 
relationship between Tsai and Su may be \"intimate.\"  (Note: 
Chang Li-Shan is running in the coming LY elections. Because 
she failed to secure the KMT nomination, she will run as an 
independent.  End Note.) 
 
6. (C) Lee Chien-Chung, a local lawyer and brother of TSU 
County Councilman Lee Chien-Hsing, said Chang\'s claims of 
political persecution were meant to distract attention from 
his criminal activities.  Newspapers report that Chang\'s 
accusers (Tsai, Su, and Yin) have all received death threats 
from Chang, who has never made a secret of his underworld 
connections and gangster past.  DPP officials involved with 
the 2004 presidential election are even more dismissive of 
Chang\'s persecution claims.  They say that Chang\'s reported 
decision to pocket KMT money before the March 20 election 
rather than distribute it on behalf of the Lien-Soong 
campaign was a major factor in Chen Shui-bian\'s landslide 
victory in Yunlin. 
 
Comment: Politics as usual in Yunlin County 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) While Yunlin\'s reputation for corruption and money 
politics is perhaps the worst on the island, the prominence 
of the Chang affair in the ongoing election campaign is 
indicative of the local, sometimes sordid nature of LY 
campaign politics.  In Yunlin, as in many areas of Taiwan, 
personalities and local power politics matter more than party 
label and policy stands.  Septel will further examine the 
role these factors will play in the upcoming LY election.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: PRESIDENT CHEN\'S NATIONAL DAY 
SPEECH 
 
 
A) \"What Have the National Day Fireworks Lit Up?\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
editorialized (10/18): 
 
\". President Chen\'s National Day speech seems to have 
been related to the United States in many ways.  First, 
in the beginning, rumors had it that the draft of 
Chen\'s speech had been reviewed by Washington before it 
was delivered; then both Washington and Tokyo responded 
to Chen\'s speech immediately, evidently indicating that 
they were both prepared to do so.  Then when his speech 
failed to get the response from Beijing that was 
expected, President Chen went so far as to say that 
`Washington had told me that Beijing would respond to 
it this way.\'  All these signs have made people wonder 
if Chen\'s cross-Strait talk was made at the request of 
the United States.  Some other people also have 
speculated that Chen was trying to use this speech to 
alleviate cross-Strait tensions in an attempt to curry 
favor with the United States. 
 
\"Washington believes that the key to improved cross- 
Strait ties lies in `resuming dialogue\' and `direct 
transportation\' [across the Taiwan Strait].  In April, 
Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly did not mind 
taking all the trouble of writing five paragraphs to 
elaborate on how both sides of the Taiwan Strait 
reached a consensus in the 1992 meeting about different 
interpretations by either side of the `one China\' 
principle, which also led to the Koo-Wang meetings in 
1993 and 1998, respectively. .  Such a move shows that 
Chen referred to the `1992 Hong Kong meeting\' in his 
National Day address because the U.S. government was 
his planned target audience and that such a move was 
made at the request of the United States. 
 
\"Chen did not touch on the `resumption of dialogue\' or 
`direct transportation\' in his May 20 inaugural speech, 
so his National Day speech was like `homework handed in 
late.\'  In Washington\'s eyes, the `1992 Hong Kong 
meeting\' that Chen mentioned in his speech may sound 
equal to the `1992 consensus\' that Washington hoped he 
would say.  But Washington probably has failed to 
notice the difference between the two terms, or maybe 
it did not find out that Chen was `playing with words\' 
until now.  As a result, if the National Day speech was 
a gift by President Chen to the United States, what 
could Washington be feeling now -- surprise at 
receiving a gift, or embarrassment at being made fun of 
for having complimented Chen on the `constructive\' 
message of his speech? .\" 
 
B) \"Incrementalism or Obstructionism\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taiwan News\" 
commented in an editorial (10/18): 
 
\". By issuing another expression of goodwill to the 
other side, President Chen earned domestic and 
international praise. 
 
\"The first and direct benefit will be felt in the DPP\'s 
legislative election campaign, thanks to its rising 
capability to build up an image of a moderate and 
progressive governing force in Taiwan that can secure 
wider support from middle of the road voters. 
 
\"Even without a positive response from Beijing, Chen 
and his party has skillfully drawn support from both 
domestic and external audiences and affirmation on both 
fronts will in turn be helpful to the DPP\'s campaign. . 
 
\"In either case, the key priority for Taiwan\'s 
leadership is to minimize the chance of any severe 
crises or military confrontations [across the Taiwan 
Strait]. 
 
\"International influence, particularly from the United 
States and Japan and other great powers, should play a 
more significant role in both mediation and monitoring 
the maintenance of peace.  A framework of peace is 
essentially needed to craft a stable and constructive 
cross-strait relationship.  Only through talks and 
exchanges of different views can a predictable and 
institutionalized framework for cross-strait 
interaction be advanced.\" 
 
C) \"Can Chen\'s Gesture Be Turned into Real Policy?\" 
 
Freelance writer Ku Er-teh noted in the pro- 
independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" (10/18): 
 
\". Chen certainly shoed goodwill in his [National Day] 
address, although to what degree he was sincere is a 
little more difficult to fathom.  Can this goodwill be 
translated into actual policy?  Some would say the most 
important thing is how the Chinese will respond to it, 
but even more important is whether or not Chen\'s team 
prepare their own contingency plan prior to 
implementing any such policy. 
 
\"It turns out that the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of 
National Defense, and even the Presidential Office had 
no idea what Chen was going to say in his address. 
Based on this, it seems that his words were simply 
intended to communicate his good intentions, but for 
what purpose? 
 
\"I\'m afraid that the consequences of Chen\'s words might 
not have been thought through.  But at least the 
Americans noticed Chen\'s goodwill.\"

1. (C) Summary: Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) officials 
are cautiously optimistic the Pan-Green camp will secure a 
narrow majority in the December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) 
election.  The DPP\'s campaign strategy is focused on sowing 
discord within the opposition alliance and enforcing 
discipline among DPP voters to boost chances for first-time 
candidates with little name recognition.  President Chen 
Shui-bian is using the December election to test the four 
candidates to replace him in 2008, giving each an independent 
role in the campaign.  The DPP has concentrated thus far on 
domestic themes for the election, although some party 
moderates fear that President Chen may revert to pre-election 
PRC-baiting if Lee Teng-hui is able to re-energize the Taiwan 
Solidarity Union\'s (TSU) stagnating campaign.  End Summary. 
 
DPP Mood: With Enemies Like This... 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) DPP officials say they are relatively relaxed about 
the upcoming LY campaign, in marked contrast to the sense of 
crisis that currently grips the Pan-Blue camp (Septel). 
Based on party polls, DPP officials assert that the minimum 
number of seats the Pan-Green can be expected to win would be 
108, five short of a majority but enough to deprive the 
Pan-Blue of its current control of the 225-seat legislature. 
Veteran DPP Legislator Hong Chi-chang told AIT that \"it 
doesn\'t really matter if we get a majority or not -- as long 
as independents hold the balance and not the Pan-Blue, we can 
govern.\"  Executive Yuan (EY) Research, Development, and 
Evaluation (RDEC) Vice Minister Chen Chun-lin, a veteran DPP 
campaign strategist, remarked that the DPP\'s current 
projected 8-9 seat gain materialized before the campaign 
season even started.  Chen assessed that \"it isn\'t that we\'ve 
done anything right, it\'s just that we are lucky to have such 
incompetent opponents.\" 
 
Divide and Conquer 
------------------ 
 
3. (C) Pan-Green campaign officials say the DPP\'s prospects 
have been boosted by a series of strategic errors over the 
past six months on the part of the Pan-Blue.  DPP Deputy 
Secretary General Lee Ying-yuan told AIT that the ruling 
 
SIPDIS 
party was seriously concerned when the Pan-Blue announced 
early in the summer a plan to limit the number of nominees. 
\"There was a period when I feared we had nominated too many 
candidates,\" Lee commented, \"but almost as soon as they 
announced their new restrictions, they started to violate 
them.\"  DPP officials were also worried that collapsing poll 
numbers for the People First Party (PFP) might lead to a 
pre-election Pan-Blue merger (Reftel).  Presidential Office 
Deputy Secretary General James Huang told AIT that the DPP 
has actively countered KMT efforts to marginalize PFP 
Chairman James Soong by singling him out for attacks, making 
him appear to be the DPP\'s real enemy.  The DPP has also 
launched a public campaign to highlight the KMT\'s refusal to 
dispose of its \"ill-gotten\" assets, a key PFP condition for a 
Pan-Blue merger. 
 
4. (C) National Security Council (NSC) Secretary General and 
veteran campaign manager Chiou I-jen told AIT that the DPP 
will use similar tactics at the local level to take advantage 
of Taiwan\'s multi-member district system.  \"We will pick the 
strongest Pan-Blue candidate in each district and focus all 
of our attacks on him,\" Chiou explained, \"that way Pan-Blue 
voters will see that candidate as the one the DPP wants to 
get rid of and shift their votes to defend him, hopefully 
leaving all the other Pan-Blue candidates in the district 
with too few votes to get elected.\" 
 
5. (C) Chiou was less optimistic that the DPP could repeat 
its successful pre-presidential election assault on the KMT\'s 
local faction bases.  To illustrate his concern, Chiou noted 
that the DPP managed to persuade more than a third of the 
membership of Miaoli County KMT Legislator Ho Chih-hui\'s 
faction to vote for Chen Shui-bian in March 20.  \"We could 
get them to vote for Chen because they couldn\'t care less 
about Lien Chan,\" Chiou noted, \"but we know they will all 
vote for Ho because his election matters to them.\"  However, 
other officials insist that the DPP is effectively playing 
local factional politics, but just in different ways.  The 
DPP\'s Lee noted that PFP Taitung County Magistrate Hsu 
Ching-yuan has already declared, and (independent Pan-Blue) 
Miaoli County Magistrate Fu Hsueh-peng is close to declaring, 
support for DPP candidates in their districts.  While Lee 
credited the DPP\'s success to patient relations building, the 
KMT has chosen to run candidates in both areas from factions 
traditionally opposed to the sitting magistrates. 
 
Themes and Appeals 
------------------ 
 
6. (C) DPP officials say that island-wide campaign appeals 
will aim both to suppress opposition turnout and to get 
Pan-Green voters to the ballot stations.  The DPP\'s Lee said 
that the party\'s twin slogans will be \"Advance Reform,\" and 
\"Care about Taiwan.\"  On the reform side, the DPP plans to 
emphasize the need to break gridlock in the LY.  Legislation 
to force the KMT to dispose of its assets, which has been 
blocked by the Pan-Blue in every session since 2002, will be 
a key element of this appeal.  The NSC\'s Chiou said the 
\"Truth Investigation Commission\" law would be another.  Chiou 
asserted that the powers given to the Commission under the 
Pan-Blue enacted law surpassed those enjoyed by the 
government under martial law.  Perhaps more importantly, the 
DPP\'s Lee noted that polls show 70 percent of the public 
supports the DPP\'s position that the commission should 
suspend operations until the Council of Grand Justices rules 
on the constitutionality of the law. 
 
7. (C) Lee told AIT that Pan-Blue opposition to the USD 18 
billion special defense budget package will serve as the main 
target of the DPP\'s \"Care about Taiwan\" (Gu Taiwan) campaign. 
 He said that the party is planning to hold a major rally on 
December 4 to raise public awareness over the need for 
Taiwan\'s defense, and to remind the public that \"there are 
those in the political arena who don\'t care about Taiwan.\" 
DPP LY Defense Committee Convener Lee Wen-chung noted that 
the PFP\'s attempts to block the budget bill offered the DPP a 
perfect opportunity to paint the opposition, including the 
fence-sitting KMT, as pro-China sellouts.  Many DPP officials 
say that the special budget will be the only cross-Strait 
related theme in the DPP campaign, but some warn that a 
resurgence in support for the TSU may tempt President Chen to 
reach for his anti-China card (Septel). 
 
One Campaign: Four HQs 
---------------------- 
 
8. (C) One unique element of this year\'s DPP campaign is the 
existence of four independent campaign headquarters, headed 
by (respectively) DPP Secretary General Chang Chun-hsiung, 
Presidential Office Secretary General Su Tseng-chang, Premier 
Yu Shyi-kun, and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh.  DPP officials 
say that President Chen ordered this model to allow aspirants 
for future party leadership the chance to show their mettle 
as campaign managers.  The EY\'s Chen commented that the only 
measure of coordination will be the DPP party operation, 
which will be largely run by Deputy SecGen Lee.  Lee told AIT 
that ensuring that party heavyweights don\'t trip over each 
other on the campaign trail has been a major headache, but 
added that the structure can be made to work if they follow 
the party\'s game plan.  \"We have made Yu responsible for 
getting his ministers out on the stump, Hsieh is taking care 
of the south, while Su, with his charisma and popular appeal, 
is responsible for helping struggling newcomers gain name 
recognition,\" Lee explained.  The NSC\'s Chiou noted that Vice 
President Annette Lu was put in charge of the party\'s female 
mobilization effort after she complained of being left out. 
Lee said in reality, her role would be to stand next to the 
president and not say anything. 
 
Comment: A Win-win Election? 
---------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The current upbeat mood within the DPP is light-years 
from the tense, life-or-death struggle atmosphere that 
prevailed in the lead up to the March 20 election.  DPP 
officials appear confident that even if they do not gain an 
outright majority on December 11, wavering independents or 
KMT members disgruntled with their own party leadership will 
give them the seats needed for a working majority.  The DPP 
may have considerable leverage to shift the balance after the 
election, since the constitutional amendment to halve the 
size of the LY passed in August will lead many to consider 
alternative forms of future employment.  A number of DPP 
officials have also asserted privately that a strong KMT 
showing would not necessarily be a bad outcome either, as it 
might extend the leadership of the incompetent Lien Chan. 
The DPP\'s positive assessment of the electoral landscape has 
given rise to an unprecedented tolerance for experimentation, 
both with nominations and campaign organization.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EINV, EFIN, ECON, TW 
SUBJECT: Taiwan Economy Slows in Third Quarter 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  Taiwan\'s export and industrial production growth slowed 
in the third quarter, but economists still expect real GDP 
growth of nearly 6 percent this year, and above 4.5 percent 
next year.  Overall, the economy should be a positive factor 
for the ruling party in the December legislative elections. 
SUMMARY. 
 
GDP Growth Mid-Range Among Asian Tigers 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  In spite of high oil prices (which economic planning 
officials think could cut GDP growth by 0.2 percent) and 
efforts to cool China\'s economic growth (China is Taiwan\'s 
largest trade partner), economists expect Taiwan to have 
real GDP growth of nearly 6 percent this year.  They see 
2005 growth above 4.5 percent with unemployment remaining 
below five percent.  Taiwan\'s GDP rose 7.2 percent in the 
first half of this year, behind Singapore\'s 10 percent and 
Hong Kong\'s 9.6 percent, but above the 5.4 percent recorded 
in South Korea in the first half of this year.  The IMF in 
September predicted average GDP growth for Asian NIEs of 5.5 
percent for 2004 and 4.0 percent for 2005. 
 
Trade Growth Still Rapid 
------------------------ 
 
3.  Taiwan\'s export growth slowed in July and August to an 
annual rate of 23 percent, down from nearly 30 percent in 
April to June.  Meanwhile, import growth slipped from 40 
percent to 33 percent.  Growing inventories of unsold goods 
contributed to a delay in projects intended to increase 
production.  This slightly slowed the growth in imports of 
capital goods from 54 percent in the second quarter to a 
still rapid 32 percent in July-August 2004. 
 
Slower Industrial Growth - Tech Sector Impact 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  The slowdown in exports contributed to high inventories 
in both finished products and intermediate goods. 
Consequently, manufacturing growth slowed from 15 percent in 
the first half to 10 percent in July-August.  Growth rates 
for capital- and technology-intensive industries slipped 
from 19 percent in the first half to 13 percent in July- 
August.  According to Central Bank of China (CBC) Economic 
Research Department Deputy Director Yeh Jong-chao, the 
slowdown is particularly significant for semiconductor and 
flat panel screen manufacturers.  Citigroup Equity Research 
has lowered its 2004 and 2005 earning estimates for flat 
panel screen makers by more than 20 percent because of 
potential oversupply.  However, iron, steel and 
petrochemicals have continued rapid growth due to strong 
demand in both local and foreign markets.  China Steel, for 
example, expects strong demand for its products to continue 
into next year. 
 
Investment: Weak Domestically, Strong Overseas 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5.  Inbound direct investment in July-August 2004 declined 
four percent from a year ago, down sharply from 28 percent 
growth in the first quarter and 56 percent growth in the 
second quarter.  However, approved out-bound direct 
investment in July-August 2004 grew nearly 30 percent year- 
on-year.  Approved investment to China was up 39 percent. 
Overseas investment to places other than China grew 2.6 
percent in the second quarter, and ten percent in July- 
August 2004. 
 
Portfolio Investment Down 
------------------------- 
 
6.  Partly in response to unsettling political and business 
events, foreign portfolio investors withdrew US$3.7 billion 
from Taiwan in the second quarter.  Net inward remittances 
in July-August 2004 were only US$200 million, far less than 
the net inflow of US$7.8 billion in the same period in 2003. 
The unsettling news included the large demonstrations after 
the March presidential election, and financial 
irregularities in listed companies uncovered by Taiwan Stock 
Exchange examiners.  As a result of these incidents, Taiwan 
business firms\' issuance of global depository receipts 
(GDRs) dropped to only half a billion of US dollars in July- 
August 2004. 
 
Foreign Exchange Reserves Up Modestly 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  With large capital outflows and fewer GDRs, Taiwan\'s 
accumulation of foreign exchange (forex) reserves slowed to 
US$3.6 billion in the second quarter and US$1.5 billion in 
July-August 2004, down from US$16 billion in the last 
quarter of 2003 and US$20 billion in the first quarter of 
2004.  Nevertheless, Taiwan\'s forex reserves as of August 
2004 amounted to US$231.6 billion, three times Taiwan\'s 
outstanding external debt of US$75 billion (as of March 
2004). 
 
Oil and Inflation Prompt CBC to Raise Interest Rates 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8.  Rising international oil prices pushed Taiwan\'s 
inflation rate to a six-year high of 3.3 percent in July and 
2.5 percent in August of this year.  This prompted CBC to 
raise interest rates for CBC-issued negotiable certificates 
of deposit from 1.075 percent to 1.085 percent, and the 
interest rate for overnight inter-bank call loans to 1.1 
percent in late September.  On October 1, CBC raised the 
discount rate and its interest rates for accommodations by 
0.25 percentage points. 
 
Implications for Taiwan\'s Economy 
--------------------------------- 
 
9.  The increase in prices and interest rates will slow 
Taiwan\'s economic growth by blunting the export sector\'s 
competitive edge, dampening the real estate market, and 
reducing private consumption.  The extent of the impact will 
depend on how long these trends last, but Taiwan\'s Council 
for Economic Panning and Development (CEPD) has already cut 
2004 growth estimates by 0.2 percent.  Statistics Bureau 
officials believe seasonal factors are responsible for the 
unemployment rate rising to 4.7 percent in August.  This is 
still lower than the 5.2 percent unemployment of a year ago. 
 
10.  According to Peng Shu-ling of the Chunghua Institution 
for Economic Research, Taiwan\'s economy is still performing 
well.  August export orders grew 25.5 percent.  Strong 
performance in the iron, steel, and petrochemical industries 
mitigates the downturn of the semiconductor and liquid 
crystal display manufacturers.  A CEPD survey showed the 
percentage of business firms expecting better performance in 
three months increased from 12 percent in July to 18 percent 
in August.  These generally favorable economic trends and 
optimistic expectations bode well for the ruling DPP party 
in the year-end legislative elections.

SUBJECT:  TAIWAN\'S EPA NARROWS SCOPE OF DRAFT PACKAGING 
RULE; AIT PROMOTES BIOPLASTICS AND BIOFUELS 
 
 
A) TAIPEI 03145 B) TAIPEI 02673 C) TAIPEI 03180 
 
1. Summary. In July 2004, Taiwan\'s Environmental Protection 
Administration (TEPA) introduced a draft rule to limit 
excessive packaging.  In response to industry opposition to 
the rule, TEPA issued a second revised draft of the rule on 
October 12.  The second draft is much narrower in scope than 
the original.  Instead of covering a wide variety of 
products, the revised rule primarily focuses on limiting the 
packaging of computer software and gifts.  While TEPA 
initially planned on closing the comment period in October, 
AIT persuaded TEPA to extend the comment period through the 
end of November.  When meeting with TEPA, AIT AGOFF also 
urged EPA to support the increased use of environmentally 
friendly technologies such as bioplastics, biofuels and soy 
ink.  End Summary. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
2.  As reported in Refs A and B, TEPA is eager to pass 
regulations to reduce excessive packaging of goods in order 
to reduce waste and move Taiwan towards its ultimate goal of 
complete recycling and zero waste by 2020.  Initially TEPA 
was hoping to pass the rule by September 2004.  However, in 
part due to the strong negative reaction of foreign industry 
reported in reftel B, TEPA has redrafted the rule and 
postponed its time-line for implementation. 
 
Second Draft Narrows Scope 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  The new draft of the rule has significantly narrowed the 
scope of the rule.  Now, instead of ultimately applying to 
all confectionary items, cosmetics, optical disks, alcohol 
products and processed foods, the rule only applies to 
computer software and gift-packaged confectionary items, 
cosmetics, optical disks and processed foods.  Under the 
second draft, non-gift packaged confectionary items, 
cosmetics, optical disks and processed foods would no longer 
be subject to regulation. 
 
TEPA Extends Comment Period 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  Econ, Ag and Commercial Officers met with Yang Ching- 
shi, Deputy Director General of the Department of Waste 
Management on October 15.  While Yang initially planned on 
closing the comment period within a week or two, the AIT 
delegation persuaded Yang to allow foreign business 
interests to submit comments through the end of November, 
and then to send the draft rule to the WTO for comment.  AIT 
also persuaded TEPA to include an English translation of the 
rule on its web site by Friday October 22.  Yang estimated 
that the rule would only be promulgated by early 2005 at the 
soonest.  AIT has notified the American Chamber of Commerce 
of the new draft and of the November deadline for comment. 
 
AIT Promotes Bioplastics and Biofuels 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.   AIT AGOFF took the opportunity to also promote the use 
of bioplastics and biofuels, both of which have strong 
environmental benefits and could significantly increase the 
demand for U.S. soybeans and corn (Ref C).  AGOFF noted USDA 
and USEPA joint interest in sending an AIT delegation to 
Taipei to provide technical assistance with respect to 
bioplastics and biofuels.  AGOFF also urged TEPA to support 
the removal of a 2.5 percent import duty on corn-based 
polylactic acid (PLA), which has negatively impacted the 
competitiveness of bioplastics.  Yang appeared interested in 
hosting an AIT delegation on bioplastics and biofuels.  Yang 
also stated he supported the principle of eliminating the 
import duty on PLA, but noted TEPA has no authority with 
regard to issues of taxation.  AIT/AGR is currently drafting 
a letter to TECRO requesting the removal of the PLA duty.

FLAGGED: INFO ON INDONESIAN VESSEL REQUESTED 
 
REF: A) TAIPEI 03152     B) STATE 216948 
 
1.  Fisheries Agency Deputy Director-General James Sha has 
provided AIT with a written response to the questions posed 
in Ref B regarding suspected high seas driftnet fishing 
vessels in the North Pacific.  Mr. Sha indicates that none 
of the vessels listed in Reftels are Taiwan-flagged, but did 
provide information on one of the vessels, which did visit 
one of Taiwan\'s ports.  The VICTORIA JAYA 2 is registered in 
Indonesia and has a Taiwanese-national master.  Mr. Sha 
requests that AIT provide any additional information it may 
have with respect to the VICTORIA JAYA 2 to assist Taiwan in 
its investigation of the alleged violation of the master of 
vessel.  Para. 2 contains the verbatim text of Deputy 
Director-General Sha\'s October 18 facsimile.  Additional 
documentation on the VICTORIA JAYA 2 will be transmitted to 
OES/OMC Tom King via facsimile. 
 
2. Begin verbatim text. 
 
Thank you for your fax dated on 8 October 2004, regarding 
the reported high seas driftnet fishing activity in the 
North Pacific Ocean.  After checking the fishing management 
system maintained by this Agency, we have not found any 
information on the vessels as listed on your fax message. 
In other words, none of them is flagged ROC\'s flag. 
 
However, there are some informations I can share with you 
that we have found VICTORIA JAYA 2 entered Kaohsiung harbor, 
Taiwan on 20 March 2004 and departed on 6 April 2004.  The 
related authority had checked the vessel before she left the 
port, and no driftnet gear or equipment were found. 
According to the documents provided by the agent, as 
attached, the nationality, fishing gear, and registered port 
of the vessel are Indonesia, bottom longoine, and Sorong, 
respectively.  Please find the relevant information of the 
vessel as attached for your reference. [to be faxed to 
OES/OMC] 
 
When the vessel departed Kaohsiung harbor, the master was 
identified as a national of Taiwan.  It would be appreciated 
if you could provide any specific evidence that indicated 
the vessel was engaged in high seas driftnet fishing 
activities.  The investigation will be conducted in 
consistent with our domestic law to pursue the alleged 
violation of the master. 
 
As you mentioned in your letter that AIT need further 
information on any vessel operating in the same area during 
April - October, so far Fisheries Agency has not permitted 
any driftnet vessel to operate in the said area, only eight 
squid-jigging vessels were permitted to fish in the North 
Pacific Ocean.  The operating location is between N42-43 and 
E170-175.  Please find the attached information of these 
vessels as well. 
 
It would be very helpful for deterring the illegal 
activities of driftnet fishing by keeping exchange 
information regionally as before.  Looking forward to your 
upcoming information.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S. ELECTION; TAIWAN ARMS 
PROCUREMENT 
 
 
A) \"Will Bush Change His Diplomatic Policies If Re- 
elected?\" 
 
The \"International Watch\" column of the pro-status quo 
\"China Times\" said (10/19): 
 
\"Almost all the countries of the whole world, except 
Israel, are not satisfied with the Bush 
administration\'s foreign policies and practices. Then, 
if Bush gets re-elected, will he change his foreign 
policies? 
 
\"There are two entirely different viewpoints.  Some 
believe he will readjust his policies in accordance 
with developments in the global situation.  Others 
think, since U.S. voters do not oppose the policies, 
why does Bush need to change them? 
 
\"Judging from Bush\'s actions during the presidential 
campaign, there seem to be no signs of change.  He does 
not regret using military force in all places and still 
plans to promote \"U.S.-style freedom and democracy\" 
with military force as one option.  He does not show 
any concessions to those countries that oppose U.S. 
attacks in Iraq.  There are, however, other messages 
that should not be ignored.  One foreign policy advisor 
to Bush\'s father, . Brent Scowcroft, recently suggested 
to [George W. Bush] that he should follow friendlier 
and more cooperative policies in his second term.\" 
 
B) \"Some Thoughts on the U.S. Election\" 
 
Commentator Paul Lin noted in the pro-independence, 
English-language \"Taipei Times\" (10/19): 
 
\". Both China and Taiwan are paying close attention to 
the U.S. presidential election. Although the Chinese 
government outwardly remains neutral, public opinion is 
clearly on Kerry\'s side because his cross-strait policy 
does not mention the Taiwan Relations Act that so 
displeases China, and because once, in a slip of the 
tongue, he supported a solution of the Taiwan issue 
within China\'s `one country, two systems\' framework. 
China therefore has better expectations of Kerry. 
 
\"Two months ago, there was some information saying that 
Chinese President Hu Jintao would visit the U.S. this 
month. After the information was leaked, it then 
appeared that U.S. National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice was paving the way for such a visit 
when she visited Beijing. If Hu does visit the U.S. 
this month, it will be interpreted as support for Bush. 
Maybe because Beijing is asking too high a price for 
such a visit, it now seems it will not take place. 
Instead, the 80/20 Committee, which enjoys a good 
relationship with Beijing, is urging ethnic Chinese to 
vote for the Democratic candidate 
 
\"Although Taiwan remains neutral, there must be 
questions concerning Kerry\'s remarks. Presidential 
advisor Koo Kuan-min\'s recent ads in the New York Times 
and the Washington Post requesting that the U.S. review 
its `one China\' policy were quickly rejected by the 
U.S. government in a clear attempt to avoid having 
external factors affect the presidential election 
campaign. The `one China\' policy issue, however, is not 
only an issue when deciding whom to vote for -- it is 
also an issue that the next U.S. president should 
resolve.\" 
 
C) \"Arms Deal Does Not Equal Security\" 
 
C.V. Chen, a senior partner at the law firm Lee and Li, 
commented in the pro-independence, English-language 
\"Taipei Times\" (10/19): 
 
\"U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard 
Lawless has said that if Taiwan\'s legislature does not 
pass the arms procurement plan, it will only prove that 
Taiwanese democracy has not yet reached a level where 
national security concerns override party politics, and 
that Taiwan would be seen as a liability, not a 
partner, by its friends in the international community. 
 
\"I can sympathize with Lawless\' defense of U.S. and 
Taiwanese interests, but as the bill will be picked up 
by the Taiwanese taxpayer, we need to further consider 
his comments. 
 
\". [W]ill the U.S. and `other countries\' doubt Taiwan\'s 
defense promises? I am curious to know what countries, 
apart from the U.S., are concerned about Taiwan\'s 
security. Lawless\' statement instead highlights the 
fact that a joint defense treaty no longer exists 
between Taiwan and the U.S., and that the US according 
to international law has no obligation to defend 
Taiwan. 
 
\".[D]oes opposition to the arms procurement plan mean 
telling Beijing that its threats are effective? On the 
contrary, I feel that defending the NT$600 billion arms 
procurement plan out of fear is tantamount to telling 
Beijing that threats are effective indeed. If China 
spends one dollar to build missiles, Taiwan has to 
spend four dollars to buy anti-missile equipment. Is 
there any more efficient threat than that? And Lawless\' 
statement is also intended as a threat, using Beijing 
to pressure Taiwan into buying U.S. arms. 
If the people of Taiwan are not brave enough to say no 
to unreasonable behavior, then such threats will only 
increase. 
 
\". Finally, the question of whether or not the NT$600 
billion arms procurement plan will be carried out will 
be symbolic of domestic democratic development and an 
opportunity to transcend the differences between the 
proponents of independence and unification, and members 
of the blue and green camps. It is crucial to whether 
the Taiwanese people will be able to leave behind the 
ideologies that have hijacked our politicians. Let us 
work together and say no to the double threat from 
Beijing and the U.S.\"

A runway accident forced the closure of Taipei\'s Sungshan 
Airport last night.  A TransAsia Airlines Airbus A320 
slipped off the runway at 8:04 pm on October 18 after a 
flight from Hualien, Taiwan.  The aircraft was damaged but 
all 100 passengers and 6 crewmembers were unharmed.  It took 
some time for airport crews to clear the damaged plane, so 
the airport, which has only one runway, was closed to all 
flights until 10:30 am the following morning.  In all, the 
accident caused the cancellation of 30 flights.  Taiwan\'s 
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) blamed a wet runway 
for the accident.  However, Taiwan\'s Aviation Safety 
Council, an agency independent of the CAA, will conduct an 
investigation to determine whether equipment failure or 
human error contributed to the accident.

1. (C) Summary: Presidential Office Deputy Secretary General 
James Huang requested a meeting with the Deputy Director 
October 19 to clarify concerns raised by Beijing over 
President Chen Shui-bian\'s October 10 speech.  Huang, at the 
president\'s instructions, explained that Chen\'s statement 
that \"Taiwan is the Republic of China\" was in no way meant as 
a provocation to the Mainland.  On the contrary, Huang said 
the president made the statement to counter attempts by Lee 
Teng-hui and pro-independence fundamentalists to use the 
upcoming constitutional debate to formally rename the 
\"Republic of China\" as Taiwan or to otherwise redefine 
Taiwan\'s sovereign status.  Huang emphasized that Chen 
remains committed not to address sovereignty-related 
questions in future rounds of constitutional reform.  While 
acknowledging that Beijing is unlikely to fully understand or 
accept the president\'s position, he urged Washington to 
convey Taipei\'s sincerity in seeking improved relations.  The 
Deputy Director reminded Huang that the PRC remains extremely 
skeptical about Chen\'s intentions, and is unlikely to 
distinguish between what Chen identified as intended for 
domestic constituencies and what he meant for Beijing\'s 
consumption.  End Summary. 
 
Point of Clarification 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) Presidential Office Deputy Secretary General James 
Huang requested a meeting with the Deputy Director October 19 
to further clarify President Chen Shui-bian\'s October 10 
National Day Address (Ref A).  Huang noted that the Secretary 
of State would soon be traveling to Asia and would likely 
receive a negative message over portions of the president\'s 
speech during his meetings in Beijing (Ref B).  Huang said he 
shared with the president concerns raised by the AIT Director 
and Deputy Director on October 16 about Beijing\'s strong 
reaction to Chen\'s assertion that the \"Republic of China is 
Taiwan.\"  Huang said that the president provided, in 
response, a lengthy explanation of his thinking and asked 
that this clarification be conveyed to AIT and Washington. 
 
3. (C) Huang asserted that the president\'s \"ROC/Taiwan\" 
statement was meant to respond to calls by fundamentalists, 
especially former President Lee Teng-hui, that Taiwan abandon 
the \"Republic of China\" structure.  He emphasized that this 
was in no way was aimed at provoking Beijing.  Huang said 
that the president is concerned about growing public support 
for Lee\'s call to abandon the title \"Republic of China\" and 
formally change the national title to \"Taiwan.\"  He pointed 
out that Lee has resurrected the traditional term, 
\"rectification of names\" (zheng-ming) as his slogan.  Huang 
noted that President Chen has offered a series of speeches in 
recent months aimed at \"safeguarding\" the \"Republic of 
China\'s\" existence.  Huang said that President Chen reminded 
an audience in Honolulu on August 30 that Dr. Sun Yat-sen had 
come to Hawaii to seek support for his revolution.  Chen 
proclaimed to the group that \"the Republic of China does 
exist and it is thriving.\"  Huang added that Chen also used a 
press availability in Belize on September 2 to refute the 
suggestion (made in August by Premier Yu Shyi-kun) that the 
national title should be changed to \"Taiwan, ROC,\" insisting 
it would remain the \"Republic of China.\" 
 
4. (C) Huang stated that the president\'s specific reference 
to the \"Republic of China\'s\" territory and population in a 
separate section of the speech was meant only as a 
description of the status quo, and denied that there were any 
political connotations.  Huang added that had the president 
meant to make this a message for Beijing\'s consumption, \"he 
would have included it in the portion of the speech on 
cross-Strait relations.\"  Huang noted that the president 
reiterated in his October 10 speech that his May 20 inaugural 
promises would be faithfully followed in his term of office. 
A core element of his May 20 pledge, Huang continued, was 
that the upcoming debate on constitutional reform will not 
touch on the question of national title or definition of the 
\"Republic of China\'s\" territory. 
 
5. (C) Huang said that \"while we are not so naive to think 
that Beijing would fully accept our clarification,\" he hoped 
that \"our friends in Washington\" would understand the complex 
political pressures the president is under.  Huang added his 
appreciation for recent statements by the State Department 
Spokesman on cross-Strait relations.  Huang asked the USG to 
convey to Beijing that \"it takes two to tango\" and that some 
sort of clear positive gesture from the other side will be 
critical to restarting communications.  Huang added that the 
PRC\'s refusal to accept the \"Republic of China\" nomenclature 
makes the Chen administration\'s attempts to suppress 
fundamentalists calls for a name change even more difficult. 
 
Beware of PRC Suspicions 
------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The Deputy Director noted in response that Beijing 
remains deeply suspicious of any statement from President 
Chen that relates to Taiwan\'s sovereignty, especially in the 
lead-up to discussions on constitutional reform.  He added 
that the PRC is extremely unlikely to discriminate between 
messages meant for domestic constituencies and those aimed 
across the Taiwan Strait.  The Deputy Director added that 
Beijing\'s leadership also faces intense internal political 
pressures to stand firm on Taiwan, making a public positive 
gesture unlikely.  That said, he noted that there are some 
signs that Beijing may be willing to de-link political and 
economic issues in the coming months.  For this reason, the 
Deputy Director urged the Chen administration to tread very 
cautiously during the ongoing Legislative Yuan (LY) election 
campaign, and to consistently reiterate the president\'s 
conciliatory message. 
 
Comment: Washington Remains Priority Number One 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (C) President Chen\'s quick response to our observations 
makes it clear that he remains determined to persuade the 
United States of his commitment to a conciliatory approach to 
the PRC.  We are, as many here have noted, his primary 
audience.  He is willing to accept, at least in the short 
term, a more chilly response from Beijing.  It is not clear, 
however, that he accepts the need to be consistent in his 
message.

1. (C) Summary: Yunlin is shaping up to be a battleground 
county in the December legislative elections.  With eighteen 
candidates vying for six seats, both Pan-Blue and Pan-Green 
have nominated aggressively in the hopes of gaining 
territory.  Furthermore, KMT County Magistrate Chang 
Jung-Wei\'s disappearance after being implicated in a bribery 
scandal promises to become a key issue in the election.  It 
is still too early to predict, but the Pan-Green camp seems 
more likely to gain an extra seat.  Nantou County, by 
contrast, is more predictable.  Although there are eleven 
candidates running for four seats, the Pan-Blue has gone on 
the defensive, with the KMT and People First Party (PFP) 
nominating just one candidate each.  The KMT incumbent is a 
shoe-in and the PFP candidate should have a better than even 
chance.  The main question in Nantou seems to be whether the 
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will take both remaining 
seats or split them with the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). 
End Summary. 
 
Yunlin County: A Battleground 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Yunlin County (pop. 738,158) has six Legislative Yuan 
(LY) seats up for election in December.  A total of eighteen 
candidates registered by the October 12 deadline, but only 
eight or nine are \"serious contenders,\" according to Yunlin 
County Government Information Bureau Director Hung Po-Lin. 
In the last election three seats went to Pan-Blue candidates, 
two to Pan-Green, and one to an independent who later joined 
the DPP.  Both sides have nominated four candidates, hoping 
to gain territory in the LY, but a large number of maverick 
and independent candidates may complicate the election. 
 
DPP: A Team of Three 
-------------------- 
 
3. (C) The DPP has nominated three candidates.  Lin Kuo-Hua, 
an incumbent, has a strong base of support and is widely 
considered a safe bet for reelection.  The other two 
candidates, former National Assembly member Lin Shu-Shan and 
Yunlin County Council member Chen Hsien-Chung do not enjoy 
the same level of name recognition.  Chen is considered by 
many observers to be a particularly weak candidate.  (Note: 
The DPP\'s other incumbent, Su Chih-Fen decided not to run for 
reelection, reportedly because she intends to run for County 
Magistrate next year.  End note.)  The DPP\'s strategy 
therefore is to have the three campaign as a team, explained 
DPP Yunlin County Chairman Wang Kao-Hsing, so that Lin 
Kuo-Hua can lend his support to the others.  Campaign posters 
display the three candidates standing together with Lin 
Kuo-Hua prominently featured in the middle.  Furthermore, the 
DPP plans to conduct periodic internal polls to determine 
which candidates the campaign should focus on.  If necessary, 
they will implement a \"peipiao\" strategy in the final days of 
the campaign, in which the DPP vote will be split among the 
candidates by directing voters, based on their birthday or 
the last digit of their national ID number, to vote for 
particular candidates. 
 
TSU: The Activist Councilwoman 
 
SIPDIS 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) The TSU has nominated one candidate, Yunlin County 
Council member Yin Ling-Ying.  She enjoys a reputation as an 
environmental activist, having successfully stopped a 1999 
land development project that would have destroyed the 
habitat of an endangered bird species.  Most recently, she 
exposed a major bribery scandal involving the County 
Magistrate, Chang Jung-Wei (Reftel).  Yin is enjoying a boost 
in popularity because of the attention she has received in 
the Chang scandal.  However, local attorney Lee Chien-Chung, 
who is also the brother of one of Yin\'s TSU colleagues on the 
County Council, said he worries that her support is too 
dependent on the scandal.  Should the scandal fade from 
memory, her voters might instead support one of the 
better-known independent candidates, such as Kao Chin-Lang of 
the Taiwan Independence Party (TAIP).   Yunlin County 
Information Bureau Director Hung Po-Lin, a Chang appointee, 
was even more skeptical of her chances, saying that her 
support is \"in the air.\"  He further suggested that her 
activism has gone too far, and that by accusing reporters of 
accepting bribes to underreport government corruption, she 
has alienated her most important ally: the press.  DPP Deputy 
SecGen Lee Ying-yuan, a Yunlin native, offered a completely 
different assessment.  Yin, he said, \"is a shoe-in.\" 
 
KMT: Three Candidates, Four Mavericks 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The KMT has nominated three candidates: Hsu Shu-Po, an 
incumbent; Hou Hui-Hsien, who previously served as a 
legislator from 1999-2001, but lost her reelection campaign 
in 2001; and Chang Shuo-wen, secretary to fugitive Magistrate 
Chang Jung-Wei.  The biggest threat to their chances comes 
from several other candidates who have decided to run 
independently after failing to secure KMT nominations.  Among 
these is an incumbent, Tseng Tsai Mei-Tso, who received the 
most KMT votes in the last election.  KMT Yunlin County 
Chairman Cheng Ching-Chen claimed she wasn\'t nominated 
because she lost a primary election within the party. 
However, local attorney Lee said she might have been dropped 
because her brother is a well-known gangster and the KMT 
fears another scandal.  Another former KMT lawmaker with 
gangster ties, Lin Ming-Yi, is running under the Nonpartisan 
Solidarity Union (NSU) banner.  The fugitive Magistrate\'s 
sister, Chang Li-Shan, is also running, and many predict she 
could collect the sympathy vote from those who believe her 
brother\'s plight is the result of a DPP vendetta.  Former KMT 
legislator Liao Fu-Pen, also known as \"Red Envelope\" 
(Hong-Bao) Pen because of his flagrant vote-buying, is also 
running.  KMT Chairman Cheng was dismissive of these 
mavericks, saying that without access to the KMT\'s extensive 
network of local campaign offices they don\'t stand a chance 
against his nominees.  Local attorney Lee offered a similar 
assessment, noting that the well-oiled KMT election machinery 
should be able to generate enough votes to support its three 
candidates. 
 
PFP: An Uphill Battle 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) The PFP has renominated its incumbent, Chen 
Chien-Song.  PFP County Director Wu Chih-Chou admitted that 
Chen faces an uphill battle.  Their campaign has little money 
and almost no support from the central party.  Chen, a former 
engineer with his base of support in his hometown of Shuilin, 
plans to run on his record of service.  When asked what 
Chen\'s strategy for the campaign would be, Wu offered the 
example that \"Chen attends many funerals in his district to 
grieve with his constituents.\"  Wu lamented, however, that 
the PFP was being marginalized because many locals assume it 
is just a party for ethnic Mainlanders. 
 
All Quiet on the Nantou Front 
----------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Nantou County (pop. 539,721), a land-locked 
mountainous district located in Taiwan\'s geographic center, 
is represented in the LY with four seats. Eleven candidates 
registered for this year\'s election.  However, in contrast to 
neighboring Yunlin County, Nantou\'s election looks to be 
rather predictable.  In the last election the DPP took two 
seats and the KMT and PFP each took one.  With three of the 
four incumbents running for reelection this time, no major 
changes are expected. 
 
Pan-Blue: On the Defensive 
-------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The Pan-Blue in Nantou has taken a defensive posture, 
nominating only their two incumbents, former Kaohsiung Mayor 
and nationally recognized politician Wu Dun-Yi (KMT) and Chen 
Chih-pin (PFP).  The decision not to attempt to gain 
territory in Nantou was the result of an agreement between 
the KMT and PFP, according to KMT Nantou County Section Chief 
Tseng Ching-chen.  Had the KMT nominated two candidates, 
 
SIPDIS 
explained Tseng, the second candidate would not stand a good 
chance of winning because of Wu\'s extreme popularity, and 
might squeeze out the PFP candidate by siphoning off some of 
his votes.  Now the KMT can instead encourage some of its 
voters to support the PFP\'s Chen if polls indicate he is in 
danger of losing to a Green candidate, Tseng added.  Lin 
Po-wen, who would have been the KMT\'s second candidate, was 
predictably upset.  He camped in front of KMT headquarters 
protesting this decision until the October 12 deadline, at 
which point he registered as an independent.  Tseng was 
dismissive of Lin\'s chances, explaining that in the internal 
party primary, Lin only received 4% of the votes, while Wu 
got 91%. 
 
Pan-Green: Hoping for a PFP Split 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The DPP nominated one of their incumbents, Tang 
Huo-Sheng and a newcomer, Lin Yun-Sheng (the current 
Magistrate\'s son).  The other DPP incumbent, Tsai Huang-lan, 
decided not to run for reelection because he is planning to 
run for Magistrate next year.  The TSU has once again 
nominated Chen Tse-Chi, who lost in the previous election. 
With the three incumbents\' seats widely considered 
unassailable, the only question seems to be whether the last 
seat will go to the DPP\'s Lin or the TSU\'s Chen.  DPP County 
Chairwoman Lai Yen-Hsueh was more optimistic than outside 
observers about the Pan-Green\'s chances in Nantou, saying 
that former PFP Legislator and James Soong spokesperson Chen 
Chen-Sheng, who is running on the Nonpartisan Solidarity 
Union (NSU) nomination, might steal enough votes from the 
PFP\'s Chen Chih-Pin to make it possible for all three Green 
candidates to win. 
 
Comment: Issues Take a Back Seat to Tactics, Personalities 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
10. (C) Predictions at this point are difficult to make. As 
PFP Yunlin Director Wu explained, early polls are unreliable 
because vote-buying becomes rampant in the last few weeks of 
the campaign.  Although this region is notorious for having 
the most flagrant vote-buying in Taiwan, it is unclear how 
much of a factor this will be in December.  However some 
things do seem clear.  Because of the Pan-Blue\'s defensive 
nomination strategy in Nantou, it is very unlikely that the 
current 2:2 split will change.  The situation in Yunlin is 
far more complex due to the Magistrate\'s disappearance in a 
bribery scandal, the aggressive nominations on both sides, 
and the number of independents taking part in the election. 
However, most observers agree that because the Pan-Blue has 
so many serious mavericks challenging its nominees, it will 
face a great disadvantage.  Provided the more disciplined 
Pan-Green makes no big mistakes, they should have little 
problem maintaining the 3:3 split, and could very likely gain 
a seat in Yunlin, bringing them closer to their goal of a 
majority in the LY this December. 
 
11. (C) As the very different election situations in these 
two counties illustrate, issues may play at best a secondary 
role in this December\'s LY election.  Factors like the number 
of nominees and the presence of mavericks on either side 
largely determine the nature of the contest.  Rather than 
national policy issues, factors like connections, 
personalities, media attention, money and tactical decisions 
like \"peipiao\" vote-distribution will likely decide the 
outcome.  DPP Yunlin County Chairman Wang\'s answer to AIT\'s 
questions about campaign issues was atypical only in its 
succinctness: \"Issues?!\" he growled, \"The issue is we have 
three candidates!\"

1. (C) Summary: Candidate registration for the December 11 
Legislative Yuan (LY) election campaign closed October 12 and 
the campaign season has begun.  Neither camp is expecting any 
dramatic swings in the current LY balance, but most observers 
expect the Pan-Blue to lose its current slim majority.  The 
Pan-Green\'s prospects for securing a slim majority may hinge 
on whether Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) can enforce 
discipline among its voters and the ability of the Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU) to advance beyond the 16 seats it is 
currently projected to win.  Both the KMT and Pan-Green 
parties are looking to capitalize on the declining fortunes 
of James Soong\'s People First Party (PFP).  However, the real 
beneficiaries from the PFP\'s slide may be political 
independents, who may well hold the balance after December 
11.  In addition to determining the make-up of the next LY, 
this election is seen by many as an informal primary for both 
Green and Blue candidates for the 2008 presidential election. 
 End Summary. 
 
Who Wants to be a Legislator? 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Registration for the December 11 LY election closed on 
October 12, marking the informal start of the campaign 
season.  A total of 387 candidates registered to contest 176 
geographic and aboriginal district seats.  Geographic 
districts range in size from one to 13 seats, with each voter 
allowed to cast a single ballot for a candidate, rather than 
a party (Note: We will review septel the arcane procedural 
and political realities of Taiwan\'s legislative elections. 
End Note).  A further 49 seats will be divided among 
proportional party and overseas lists.  The DPP is running a 
total of 92 candidates for district seats, the KMT 74, People 
First Party (PFP) 41, and TSU 30.  The remaining 150 plus 
candidates represent minor parties or are running as 
independents.  Among district seats in the 2001 election, the 
DPP won 69 (87 overall, including proportional candidates), 
KMT 53 (68 overall), PFP 35 (46 overall), and the TSU 8 (13 
overall). 
 
Both Camps Aim for Slim Majority 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Both camps have set a small majority as their stated 
goal, but observers say that it is possible that neither camp 
will surpass the 113 seat target.  National Security Council 
(NSC) Secretary General Chiou I-jen, architect of President 
Chen Shui-bian\'s March 20 victory, told AIT that he is 
absolutely confident that the Pan-Blue will lose its current 
one-seat majority, but could not guarantee the Pan-Green will 
surpass the 113 mark.  DPP Survey Center Director Pan I-shuan 
said that the party\'s most recent poll estimates the 
Pan-Green will win 109 seats total (93 DPP, 16 TSU) versus 
105 for the Pan-Blue (69 KMT, 32 PFP, and 4 New Party).  Pan 
noted that this number will serve as the DPP\'s baseline 
figure, since it reflects the situation before the campaign 
started. 
 
DPP Challenge: Enforcing Discipline 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Given Taiwan\'s multi-member districting system, both 
camps are focusing attention on candidate coordination. 
Veteran DPP Legislator Hong Chi-chang told AIT that the 
Pan-Green\'s chances for a majority hinges on its ability to 
persuade Pan-Green voters to spread their support evenly 
among DPP candidates, a system referred to as \"peipiao.\" 
Hong noted that the DPP is running a large number of 
first-time candidates who lack name recognition.  \"Without a 
peipiao system in place,\" Hong commented, \"many of these 
candidates will lose.\"  DPP Deputy Secretary General Lee 
Ying-yuan commented that discussions for candidate 
coordination were just getting under way, but so far 
candidates have been eager to participate, hoping to convert 
the DPP edge in opinion polls into the seats needed for an LY 
majority. 
 
TSU: Modest Expectations 
 
SIPDIS 
------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Early expectations for major gains by the TSU appear 
to have fizzled, with observers inside and outside of the 
party predicting only modest gains over 2001.  TSU Policy 
Chief Lee Shangren told AIT that the party has revised its 
internal goal to 20 seats, but admitted that even this figure 
would be hard to achieve.  DPP Taipei County Magistrate Lin 
Hsi-yao asserted that the TSU could break its current malaise 
if it were to exploit popular sentiment against the 
government\'s support of direct transportation links with the 
PRC.  \"During the presidential campaign, we were disturbed by 
the depth of anti-Three Links sentiment among many voters 
outside of major urban centers,\" Lin said. 
 
6. (C) However, the TSU\'s Lee said his party would pass up 
the opportunity to attack the Three Links and continue to 
focus on politics rather than trade.  \"We are under intense 
pressure from our business supporters not to campaign against 
the Three Links,\" Lee explained, \"so it comes down to a 
choice between the common people and the business community 
-- we\'d rather have the money than the votes.\"  While the 
TSU\'s decision to hold off on attacking the Three Links has 
 
SIPDIS 
relieved some pressure on the DPP, party officials express 
concern that recent attacks by former President Lee Teng-hui 
on the government\'s post-May 20 cross-Strait policy line may 
provoke President Chen Shui-bian to revert to the sort of 
China-baiting that featured prominently in the presidential 
election campaign. 
 
Pan-Blue Challenge: Keeping PFP Votes in the Family 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7. (C) The Pan-Blue camp will have an even tougher time of 
coordinating campaign strategy due to ongoing tensions 
between the KMT and PFP and the presence of a large number of 
renegade Pan-Blue candidates.  PFP Legislator (Taichung City) 
Daniel Hwang (Yi-jiao) told AIT that \"we will talk big about 
peipiao, but we couldn\'t do this even among PFP candidates, 
let alone together with the KMT.\"  KMT Legislator (Taipei 
City South) Apollo Chen (Shei-sheng) offered a similar 
assessment.  \"For the Pan-Blue, it will be everyone for 
themselves,\" Chen concluded.  KMT Policy Chief Tseng 
Yung-chuan told AIT that the KMT does not necessarily need a 
peipiao system because its candidates will be boosted by 
flagging public support for the PFP.  \"Sure, the PFP will 
lose seats this time,\" Tseng assessed, \"but that just means 
more votes for KMT candidates.\" 
 
Independents May Hold Balance 
----------------------------- 
 
8. (C) However, many observers caution that PFP voters may 
not automatically shift their support to the KMT.  Institute 
for National Policy Research Executive Director (INPR) Lo 
Chih-cheng told AIT that one factor to watch for is whether 
educated Pan-Blue voters, disenchanted with the PFP over its 
post-March 20 behavior but unwilling to vote for an 
unreformed KMT, might look to independent candidates as an 
outlet for their protest votes.  Samuel Wu, a political 
advisor to KMT Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, told AIT that 
the Pan-Blue should worry more about independents than the 
Pan-Green.  \"Our supporters are different from the DPP\'s,\" he 
asserted, \"DPP voters will never cast ballots for someone 
without official nomination, but Pan-Blue voters are just as 
likely to vote for a non-partisan as for a candidate with 
party backing.\"  This factor may be especially important in 
Taipei City, where there are almost as many independent 
Pan-Blue candidates as there are registered ones.  Among the 
candidates considered as potential threats to the Pan-Blue 
camp are two former DPP Chairmen -- Shih Ming-te and Hsu 
Hsin-liang -- both of whom are polling strongly among 
Pan-Blue (but not DPP) voters. 
 
9. (C) Officials in both camps suggest that the Non-Partisan 
Solidarity Union (NSU), a loose grouping of political 
independents (most of whom were expelled by major parties on 
ethical or loyalty grounds), may play a key role in 
determining the election\'s outcome.  This election marks the 
first time the NSU has registered as a political party, 
making it eligible to receive proportional seats if it gains 
more than 5 percent of the island-wide vote.  The DPP\'s Hong 
asserted that such an outcome would impact negatively on both 
the DPP and KMT, making it more likely that independents will 
hold the balance of power in the next LY.  How this would 
influence the DPP\'s ability to govern is subject to debate. 
Taipei County Magistrate Lin asserted that as long as the 
Pan-Green is within five seats of a majority, it will be able 
to easily entice non-partisan candidates into its coalition. 
The KMT\'s Tseng, however, asserted that the NSU is 
ideologically closer to the Pan-Blue, thus will back the KMT 
on major policy issues.  The DPP\'s Hong assessed that the 
wider the margin between the Pan-Green and an outright 
majority, the higher the price non-partisans will be able to 
demand from the government in terms of political pork. 
 
The 2004 Primary for the 2008 Election? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Officials in both camps say this election may also 
serve as an early primary for the 2008 presidential contest. 
President Chen has intentionally given the four competitors 
for future DPP leadership their own independent campaign 
staffs for the LY election (Reftel).  Similarly, the three 
contenders for future KMT leadership -- LY President Wang 
Jin-pyng, Taipei Mayor Ma, and PFP Chairman Soong -- are 
using the campaign to build support for their own 
candidacies.  Ma advisor Wu told AIT that the Taipei Mayor 
will only campaign for those Pan-Blue candidates (including 
independents) whom he believes will help him rebuild a new, 
more moderate KMT.  Wang has been less discriminatory, likely 
because his prospects for future leadership depend heavily on 
support from within the LY.  Soong is also stumping for 
candidates from across the Pan-Blue spectrum.  However, even 
members of his own party are discounting his potential for 
future political office (Septel).  In one very public 
example, PFP legislator (Taipei North) Chin Huei-chu loudly 
denounced Taipei Mayor Ma October 10 for refusing to help her 
re-election campaign and threatened to retaliate by 
supporting LY Speaker Wang (not Soong) for KMT Chairman after 
the election. 
 
Comment: No Major Sea-Change 
---------------------------- 
 
11. (C) The upcoming election is unlikely to see a major 
shift in seats between the two camps because Taiwan\'s 
multi-member districting system encourages competition within 
partisan camps rather than between them.  Nevertheless, a 
modest Pan-Green majority, with or without the help of 
independents, seems to be the likeliest outcome given the 
DPP\'s advantage in resources, organization, and morale. 
Perhaps more significant than the final outcome will be how 
votes divide within the Pan-Blue camp.  PFP poll numbers 
continue to slide and there is growing fear within the party 
of a looming collapse.  While the PFP is unlikely to 
disappear the way the New Party did in 2001, a large setback 
could have major implications for future political 
realignment within the Blue camp.  A greatly weakened PFP 
will not be in a position to place unpalatable ideological or 
personnel conditions for of a post-election Pan-Blue merger. 
This may help create a \"soft-landing\" for the Pan-Blue, 
allowing for the emergence of a more stable and moderate KMT 
leadership capable of playing an effective, and responsible, 
balancing role in opposition.

SUBJECT: THE KMT\'S LY ELECTION NON-STRATEGY 
 
REF: A. TAIPEI 03031 
     B. TAIPEI 03234 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  With just over a month to go before the 
December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) election, the KMT is close 
to abandoning efforts to formulate a coherent, coordinated 
strategy for retaining its current LY majority.  The KMT 
failed to enforce discipline during the nomination process, 
and party officials do not expect compliance with planned 
coordinated voting distribution system.  An aborted 
eleventh-hour attempt to merge the KMT and People First Party 
(PFP) has deepened existing distrust within the Blue camp. 
The lack of a consensus on major policy issues means that the 
Pan-Blue leadership is even less capable of responding to 
Pan-Green attacks than they were during the presidential 
election campaign.  Nevertheless, many individual KMT LY 
candidates are confident that their strong grassroots bases, 
and crumbling PFP support, will ensure them victory on 
December 11.  End Summary. 
 
Divided We Stand 
---------------- 
 
2. (C) The KMT has largely abandoned an attempt to formulate 
a unified campaign for the December 11 LY election.  Party 
officials have tried to put a positive spin on the problem, 
noting the local focus of LY campaigns.  KMT Overseas Affairs 
Director Ho Szu-yin told AIT that in LY elections, \"all 
politics is local,\" and individuals rely on their personal 
qualifications and community connections.  Soochow University 
Political Science Professor and informal KMT advisor Emile 
Sheng asserted that a coordinated island-wide campaign would 
only move the vote by three percentage points in any case. 
KMT Organizational Development Deputy Chairman Elton Liou 
told AIT that since June he has been visiting local KMT 
organizations to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each 
LY candidate and found most candidates uninterested in help 
from Taipei HQ.  Liou asserted that this was natural, since 
most KMT LY members rely on their own relationships and 
connections to secure re-election.  Compared to a 
presidential or magistrate election, he continued, the 
central organization has less of a role to play in LY 
campaigns. 
 
3. (C) Nevertheless, political observers emphasize that in 
Taiwan\'s multi-member district system, party headquarters do 
play a number of critical roles.  Perhaps none is more 
important than ensuring the nomination of a correct number of 
candidates.  While the PFP remained conservative in its 
nomination numbers, the KMT nominated about 40 percent more 
than the number of its incumbents.  Moreover, many party 
members who did not win party nomination have launched 
independent campaigns.  Elton Liou said that little could be 
done about the problem.  \"This is the KMT, this is our 
tradition,\" he sighed.  Liou said the biggest difference 
between the DPP and KMT is that \"KMT members always think 
they do not derive their power from the party.\"  KMT 
officials are equally pessimistic over their ability to 
enforce a coordinated voting distribution strategy (peipiao). 
 Ho Szu-yin told AIT that psychologically it is very 
difficult to ask voters not to cast a vote for the candidate 
of their choice, even if it is for the good of the party as a 
whole.  Former Organizational Development Chairman Ting 
Shou-chung said that \"peipiao\" might work in northern urban 
areas but local factions in central and southern Taiwan have 
their own ideas on who they want to support. 
 
Three Issue That Could Undo the Blue 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Despite the emphasis on local campaigns, some in the 
KMT say there are national issues that could affect the 
Pan-Blue\'s election prospects.  KMT Legislator (Taipei South) 
Apollo Chen (Shei-sheng) told AIT that, in a September 
meeting with KMT Chairman Lien Chan, he outlined three issues 
that the party must handle successfully in order to remain 
competitive in the year-end election -- the KMT-PFP merger, 
the November 4 court decision on the presidential election 
challenge, and the December 10 commemoration of the Formosa 
Incident (marking the anniversary of the KMT government\'s 
1979 crackdown on an opposition magazine run by senior 
members of the current administration).  Since Chen\'s 
warning, the Pan-Blue has already dropped the ball on the 
first issue.  A very public KMT attempt in the final days of 
the registration period to bully the PFP into accepting a 
merger has only increased animosity between the two parties 
and further hindered cooperation (Ref A).  While both sides 
have tried to bury the hatchet, the issue continues to 
fester.  Despite a renewed call for immediate merger last 
week by PFP legislators from central and southern Taiwan, few 
observers believe that a merger can be realized before the 
election. 
 
5. (C) The courts are not expected to rule on the first of 
the two March 20 election-related cases until November 4, but 
the KMT is already showing signs of fumbling that issue in 
the form of its \"Truth Investigation Commission\" created by 
Pan-Blue legislators in August.  KMT moderates complain that 
the leadership\'s continued focus on the last election has 
distracted the party from adequately planning for the next 
one and alienated centrist voters who likely regard the 
Pan-Blue protest as \"sour grapes.\"  KMT Taipei City Councilor 
Chen Yu-mei bemoaned to AIT that during a recent meeting with 
Lien Chan, the Chairman took a full hour complaining about 
March 20, but did not make even a single mention of the LY 
election.  Lien and other top KMT officials continue to see 
all politics through the lens of March 20, without reference 
to political realities.  When asked by AIT in early October 
what the Pan-Blue election strategy would be, KMT LY 
President Wang Jin-Pyng replied \"the Truth Investigation 
Commission.\"  When pressed to elaborate on how exactly this 
would help the KMT\'s LY prospects, Wang thought about it and 
said, \"actually it really is a DPP issue.\" 
 
6. (C) Apollo Chen\'s third issue, \"the Formosa Incident,\" 
represents a more generalized fear that the Pan-Blue will 
fall into the same nationalism trap the Pan-Green set for 
them during the last election (Ref B).  Chen told AIT that he 
specifically warned Lien not to let the PFP trick him into 
making sour and sarcastic remarks before the December 10 
anniversary of the incident.  Chen asserted that this would 
only alienate the majority of ethnic Taiwanese KMT supporters 
and boost the PFP among the minority ethnic Mainlanders. 
Confident that the current leadership can not win on the 
issue, many light Blue candidates are themselves trying to 
avoid anything related to Taiwan nationalism.  The KMT\'s 
Ting, who is running in Taipei\'s North District, told AIT he 
will simply focus on non-sensitive issues like the economy, a 
volunteer army, and stability.  However, other candidates, 
such as PFP Legislators Lin Yu-fang and Sheu Yuan-kuo, are 
actively campaigning against issues like the USD 18 billion 
defense procurement budget as part of their appeal to deep 
Blue voters in Taipei City.  As with the Formosa Incident, 
KMT moderates fear that the PFP\'s posturing on the defense 
budget will leave the entire Pan-Blue camp vulnerable to 
charges of selling out to Beijing. 
 
Herding Cats 
------------ 
 
7. (C) KMT\'s Elton Liou told AIT that there is a recognition 
that the Pan-Blue needs to at least respond to DPP attacks 
during the campaign, but they have not yet reached a 
consensus on how.  Liou noted that the party has identified 
the Truth Commission, party assets, and the KMT\'s 
passive-aggressive stance on the special defense procurement 
budget as key vulnerabilities, but internal divisions have 
made it impossible to craft a coherent response.  After 
arguing for hours on the problem, Liou said the only thing 
the KMT could agree upon was to adopt the ambiguous slogan 
\"Make things right.\"  Personality clashes and personnel 
reshuffles are compounding the KMT\'s woes.  Su Chi, an 
influential Lien advisor, angrily quit the party\'s think tank 
after being denied a \"safe\" seat on the KMT\'s proportional 
candidate list.  On October 18, another key player in the 
discussion, KMT Legislator and party Spokesman Alex Tsai, was 
summarily fired over a still obscure spat with a scion of the 
Chiang dynasty. 
 
Comment: Incompetence is Relative 
--------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) If we needed proof that the KMT has changed over the 
last four years, this campaign provides it.  First, the KMT 
has abandoned the centralized bureaucratic organization that 
was key to past electoral victories.  The KMT created the 
peipiao voter allocation system.  Now the KMT says it cannot 
enforce this system among its supporters.  Second, the party 
that build the ROC military and took considerable pride in 
cultivating an image of defenders of freedom now campaigns 
against funding defense. 
 
9. (C) This is the situation that many KMT legislators feared 
in the aftermath of March 20 when the party leadership 
diverted all their attention and resources to fighting the 
presidential election outcome.  Despite the chaos in the 
central headquarters, the KMT is not expecting a train wreck. 
 Individual candidates in both northern and southern Taiwan 
are polling well in their districts, and confident of their 
own victory.  This stems in large part from the fact that, 
compared to the PFP (Septel), the KMT is a model of cohesion 
and unity.  Most KMT candidates are optimistic that their 
individual strengths, and the PFP\'s weaknesses, will allow 
the KMT as a party to come out of the election at least as 
strong as it started.

\"[President Chen] Ruins [U.S. President] Bush\'s Big 
Plan, Forcing [Washington and Beijing to Strengthen the 
Mechanism] to Prevent [Taiwan] Independence and to Push 
for [Cross-Strait] Talks\" 
 
Chen Yi-hsin, professor at the American Studies 
Institute of Tamkang University, said in an op-ed piece 
in the conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily 
News\" (10/21): 
 
\"U.S. State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher said 
recently that when Secretary of State Colin Powell 
meets with Chinese President Hu Jintao on October 25, 
he `expects to have an opportunity to respond to 
Beijing about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.\'  Boucher\'s 
remarks indicate that the Bush administration is 
displeased with the small tricks President Chen Shui- 
bian played [with] his National Day speech.  Boucher\'s 
remarks also show that Washington has decided to 
discuss with Beijing how to further strengthen an 
agreement reached between Vice President Dick Cheney 
and the Beijing leaders when [Cheney] visited China in 
April, in which both sides agreed to establish a 
mechanism to prevent Taiwan independence and to push 
for talks across the Taiwan Strait. 
 
\"The main reason that Washington is displeased [with 
Taipei] is that other than the goodwill gesture, Taipei 
failed to report to the United States in advance about 
those negative remarks Chen made [in his National Day 
speech]. . 
 
\"It is noteworthy that when meeting with the 
journalists in Washington in May, Powell confirmed that 
Washington and Beijing have started to work on 
resolutions to the Taiwan issue that is of mutual 
concern.  Powell\'s remarks have indirectly confirmed 
that a cooperative mechanism has been established 
between Washington and Beijing since Cheney\'s China 
visit in an attempt to prevent Taiwan from altering the 
status quo.  Nonetheless, the Bush administration has 
long been displeased about Taipei\'s refusal to listen 
to the United States\' warnings and its insistence on 
the `secret independence\' route.  Taipei toyed with the 
United States again this time using Chen\'s National Day 
speech, treating President Bush as a `lame duck\' 
president.  This has, without doubt, pushed Washington 
to accelerate its pace of talking with Beijing on how 
to further strengthen their bilateral plan to prevent 
Taiwan independence and push for cross-Strait talks.\"

\"The Need for Trust and Better Communication\" 
 
Former chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan Nat 
Bellocchi wrote in the pro-independence \"Taipei Times\" 
(10/22): 
 
\"The Double Ten National Day speech by President Chen 
Shui-bian lifted some of the tension that still exists 
in the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, but events connected 
with the recent full-page advertisement by Koo Kwang- 
ming in two leading American newspapers, and a 
symposium on Taiwan\'s Constitution and U.S.-Taiwan 
relations, show that some bilateral tension and 
mistrust remains -- based more on evasion of reality 
than any misunderstanding. It is not good at a time 
when the United States must work closer than ever with 
Taiwan through understanding and dialogue. . 
 
\"There is much to ponder in the broader tripartite 
relationship. One immediate task will be to determine 
what can or should be done once elections are completed 
and policy review begins. The United States will need 
policies that take into account the mainstream opinion 
while maintaining good relations with China. 
 
\"If one looks at what lies ahead for Taiwan -- a new 
constitution, a referendum and perhaps dialogue with 
China -- the United States may find it necessary to 
become quite intrusive in Taiwan\'s domestic affairs. 
That\'s dicey in any event, and in any country. Foreign 
intrusion in domestic matters is never welcome. 
 
\"The United States will have to work with that reality. 
The core need is close, effective and broader 
communication with one another. In Taiwan, there are 
frequent symposiums that invite American and other 
scholars to take part. The Unite States does this as 
well, but when it comes to Taiwan, it seldom if ever 
includes people who do not agree with U.S. policy. This 
is unfortunate, as understanding is the base for better 
communication between governments. 
 
\"One possibility in pursuing better government 
communication is for the United States to establish a 
cross-strait task force made up of deputy assistant 
secretaries -- or people of equivalent rank -- from the 
 
SIPDIS 
State Department, the Defense Department, the National 
Security Council and perhaps others. This group would 
be tasked with producing a regular report to the 
president. The report could be drawn from a regular 
quarterly meeting of the group and their Taiwanese 
counterparts, and would include recommendations on any 
matter that should be addressed. 
 
\"The Taiwanese side would be expected to start a 
similar process to ensure the president is well 
informed. There is a need for presidential aides on 
both sides to be kept well informed about this 
relationship. 
 
\"Unfortunately, raising the frequency and level of 
communication tends to be seen in Taipei first and 
foremost in terms of high-profile visits or publicly 
announced bilateral meetings which strain the United 
States\' relationship with China. The biggest obstacle 
to more regular, higher-level liaisons between the 
United States and Taiwan in national security matters, 
of course, is objections from China. Yet there have 
been similar, if less structured, liaisons in the past 
that were manageable. It does require trust, however, 
and broadening the number of people involved in this 
liaison strengthens government support on both sides. 
 
\"There are doubtless many other possibilities for 
enhancing communication. The United States has endorsed 
Chen\'s Oct. 10 speech, and one hopes that it could 
eventually result in a dialogue between Taiwan and 
China. Even so, it is unlikely to remove the U.S.\' need 
for a continuing and perhaps even closer relationship 
with Taiwan.\"

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  During the third quarter of 2004, the PRC legalized 
tourism to Kinmen and Matsu for all Fujian residents. 
Taiwan legalized 81 product categories for import from the 
PRC.  However, most are agricultural goods that will still 
be restricted for lack of cross-Strait sanitary and 
inspection agreements.  Taiwan also decided to allow a fifth 
PRC media outlet to station reporters in Taiwan.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION 
------------------------- 
 
2.  PRC LIBERALIZES MINI-LINKS TOURISM: Fujian Deputy 
Governor Wang Mei-xiang told visiting Kinmen County 
Commissioner Lee Juh-feng and Taiwan Legislator Wu Cheng- 
dian on September 16 that Fujian would remove restrictions 
on the travel of Fujian residents to Kinmen and Matsu for 
tourism.  Taiwan had lifted its tourism ban on Fujian 
residents in 2001 in order to boost economic development for 
Kinmen and Matsu.  Taiwan\'s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) 
in response announced on September 26 a few small measures 
to expand the mini-links.  Notably, MAC will allow Taiwan\'s 
colleges and universities to open Executive MBA programs in 
Kinmen and Matsu for employees of Taiwan firms in the PRC. 
 
3.  GREEN BUSINESSMAN DENIED VISA: Lin Wen-yuan, Chairman of 
Taiwan\'s state-owned China Steel, was denied an entry permit 
to visit the PRC.  Taiwan\'s local press speculated that 
Lin\'s close ties with President Chen Shui-bian were the 
cause.  Lin had visited China last November to inspect 
investments there.  Because Lin is also the Chairman of 
Taiwan Steel and Iron Industries Association, the move may 
have impeded consultations on the PRC\'s investigation of 
Taiwan\'s alleged iron and steel dumping.  In January 2004, 
China imposed anti-dumping duties of up to 55 percent on 
cold press steel plate from Taiwan, South Korea, Ukraine and 
Russia.  The PRC announced in May that it would reevaluate 
the anti-dumping duties.  Taiwan exported almost USD 1.2 
billion worth of iron and steel to the PRC during the first 
half of the year. 
 
4.  TAIWAN TIGHTENS CONTROL OF MINI-LINKS: Because 
authorities believe many unqualified travelers take 
advantage of mini-links travel available to Taiwan\'s small 
businesses with investment in the Mainland, the Bureau of 
Immigration and the Investment Commission tightened the 
review process for travelers.  Taiwan travelers must now 
show PRC business licenses and PRC approved investment plans 
before traveling.  Separately, two members of the Control 
Yuan, one Taiwan\'s five branches of government with 
oversight functions similar to an Inspector-General or the 
Government Accountability Office, visited Fujian via Kinmen 
and Matsu on August 23 to inspect the mini-links operation, 
investigating complaints of customs clearance and other 
travel inconveniences.  It was the first Control Yuan 
inspection of the mini-links. 
 
5.  LOW INTEREST IN TAICHUNG TRANSSHIPMENT: After more than 
two months of operation, only one vessel, a Yangming Marine 
Transport Corp. ship, had taken advantage of the new 
Taichung offshore transshipment center with a voyage 
directly to Shanghai, according to Taichung Harbor 
Administration.  Observers blame low interest on the 
Taiwan\'s government prohibition of Taichung-Fuzhou and 
Taichung-Xiamen routes. 
 
-------------------- 
TRADE AND INVESTMENT 
-------------------- 
 
6.  MORE IMPORT BANS LIFTED: On September 4, Taiwan\'s BOFT 
eliminated import bans on 81 PRC products.  Nine categories 
of manufactured goods such as portable outdoor gas grills 
were legalized.  The remaining 72 categories are 
agricultural or fishery products legalized to comply with 
WTO standards.  However, because there are no cross-strait 
sanitary and inspection agreements, these new categories of 
agricultural products are still unable to enter Taiwan\'s 
market.  Access for these categories is unlikely without 
cross-Strait negotiations. 
 
7.  PRC ANTI-DUMPING MOVE: The PRC\'s Ministry of Commerce 
announced on August 27 that it would impose an antidumping 
duty on yarn of nylon and textured yarn of nylon imported 
from Taiwan.  More than 13 Taiwan firms were affected. 
According to Taiwan Customs, the PRC is Taiwan\'s largest 
export market for these nylon products, accounting for over 
70 percent of exports.  The PRC had previously imposed 
antidumping taxes on caprolactam (CPL), a chemical used in 
the manufacture of synthetic fibers, including nylon. 
8.  NEW SERVICE SECTOR INVESTMENTS: Following the PRC\'s 
approval of its insurance joint venture in Shanghai, Cathay 
Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Taiwan\'s leading life insurance 
company, dispatched some 40 Taiwan professionals to Shanghai 
for marketing, training and logics.  It plans to expand its 
Shanghai site to employ over 60 Taiwanese employees.  On a 
separate note, the PRC approved on August 10 the 
establishment in Dongguan, Guangdong province, of the first 
Taiwan-owned hospital in the Mainland.  Taiwan investors in 
Dongguan will own 80 percent of the hospital, and Taiwan\'s 
Cheng Hsin Rehabilitation Medical Center will own the 
remaining 20 percent.  Construction is scheduled to begin in 
November. 
 
9.  PRC COURT ACCEPTS TAIWAN ARBITRATION RESULTS: On August 
19, the settlement of a dispute between two Taiwan investors 
regarding a property in Xiamen that had been mediated in 
Taiwan by the Chinese Arbitration Association, Taipei (CAA) 
was honored by a Xiamen court and implemented.  CAA says 
this marks the first time that the result of a cross-strait 
commercial dispute mediated by CAA has been accepted and 
implemented by a PRC court and indicates the protection of 
cross-strait commercial activities is improving. 
 
10.  TELECOM COMMERCIAL COOPERATION: Taiwan\'s Chunghwa 
Telecom and the PRC\'s China Telecom jointly announced cross- 
Strait private line services available to enterprises 
located in Suzhou, Taipei, Kaohsiung and Tainan.  The 
service may be expanded soon to other areas such as Beijing, 
Shanghai, Guangdong, Shenzhen, Xiamen and Dongguan. 
 
---------------------- 
EXCHANGES AND CONTACTS 
---------------------- 
 
11.  MAC APPROVES PRC NEWS SERVICE: On July 27, the MAC 
announced that it would approve a fifth mainland media, 
China News Agency (CNA), to station reporters in Taiwan on a 
trial basis.  CNA can post two reporters for two months, 
after which the MAC will make a final decision on whether 
the agency can stay. 
 
12.  IPR VISIT UNDERSCORES STEADY FLOW OF EXCHANGES: The 
pace of people-to-people exchanges across the Strait 
continued unabated during the quarter.  Notably, a 20-member 
PRC delegation made up of judges and officials of the Taiwan 
Affairs Office and Bureau of Trademarks traveled to Taiwan 
to meet with Taiwan\'s Intellectual Property Office to 
discuss trademark protection.  Liu You-mei, a member of the 
PRC\'s Chinese People\'s Political Consultative Conference 
also visited Taiwan to attend a railroad construction and 
technology conference.  Other highlights included Taiwan 
Strait Shipping Association Chairman Chen Ting-hui, Taiwan 
Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association Chairman 
Rock Hsu, and Taiwan\'s Petrochemical Industry Association 
Chairman Chiou Huai-hsin traveling separately to the 
Mainland.  In addition, numerous conferences and trade shows 
were held on each side with cross-Strait participation. 
Many focused on cross-Strait relations, but other Topics 
ranged from wireless local area networks to Chinese opera.

Classified By: AIT Deputy Director David J. Keegan, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: AIT Econ Chief delivered reftel talking 
points to MOFA Department of International Organizations 
(DIO) and the Taiwan Center for Disease Control (CDC) on 
October 21.  DIO provided additional detail about its 
proposal to add language to Article 65 of the draft 
International Health Regulations (IHRs) and requested US 
assistance in getting it accepted.  AIT expressed support of 
Taiwan\'s goal of being included in an international 
surveillance system, but emphasized the importance of timing 
and getting the substantive portions of the regulations 
agreed.  To this end, AIT urged Taiwan to closely coordinate 
its position and strategy with the US delegation.  DIO said a 
lesson was learned at the May meeting of the WHO, concluding 
that it was not in Taiwan\'s interest to derail the revision 
of the IHRs by prematurely proposing its amendment.  CDC said 
it understood and was satisfied with the US position on the 
IHRs and would continue expanding its surveillance and 
response capabilities to safeguard global public health.  End 
Summary. 
 
MOFA Requests Help Amending Article 65 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) AIT Econ Chief called on MOFA Deputy Director General 
for International Organizations Jieh Wen-Chieh on October 21 
to convey the reftel demarche.  Jieh explained that Taiwan 
was sending a delegation to the meeting under the cover of an 
NGO, and said that Nicaragua had submitted a proposal to 
amend Article 65 of the IHRs to allow Taiwan to be included 
in the global disease surveillance program.  He requested US 
assistance in getting it accepted and provided AIT with a set 
of talking points supporting Taiwan\'s participation (see para 
6).  AIT stated that the US was still examining Taiwan\'s 
proposed language for Article 65 of the IHRs and could not 
comment at this time. 
 
Not in Taiwan\'s Interest to Derail Proceedings 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. (C) AIT suggested Taiwan\'s \"NGO\" delegation should 
coordinate with the US delegation before the meeting.  Jieh 
agreed, saying that Taiwan would welcome any pre-negotiation 
discussions.  He said that Taiwan did not want to make a 
\"sudden attack\" or provoke a heated debate.  Jieh said that 
Taiwan had learned a lesson during the May WHO meeting that 
it is not in Taiwan\'s interest to derail the proceedings by 
prematurely bringing the controversial topic of Taiwan and 
the WHO into the debate.  He said Taiwan would be reasonable, 
but was committed to seeing its cause brought up. 
 
CDC: Taiwan will be Cooperative and Patient 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) AIT also called on the new CDC Director Steve H.S. 
Kuo.  Kuo assumed the position on October 18 after four years 
in Washington as the TECRO Health Advisor.  After AIT 
conveyed the reftel talking points, Kuo noted the issue of 
IHRs was not necessarily linked to Taiwan\'s main concern, 
which was participation in the WHO.  He said he understood 
that the US goal of revising the IHRs was to bring a measure 
of transparency to countries like China and Vietnam.  He said 
he agreed that it would not be productive to block progress 
on that issue or give China an excuse to delay reform by 
prematurely bringing up the controversial topic of Taiwan\'s 
WHO membership. 
 
5. (C) Kuo said his agency would be cooperative and patient, 
promising to remain open and transparent about public health 
issues.  Taiwan would not become an information \"black hole\" 
on public health to blackmail the world into allowing it 
access to the WHO.  He said he agreed that Taiwan\'s interests 
are best served if it tries to set an example for good 
conduct, plays by the rules, and proves to the world that it 
has much to contribute to global health.  Kuo warned, 
however, that some in Taiwan question this strategy, saying 
it is flawed because if Taiwan already provides the world 
with everything, there is no incentive for other countries to 
allow it access to the WHO.  He said it was important for the 
US to push harder for Taiwan\'s expanded role in the WHO to 
prevent such voices from getting stronger. 
 
DIO\'s Talking Points (Verbatim) 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Begin verbatim text. 
 
Talking Points for Supporting Taiwan\'s Participation in the 
International Health Regulations (IHR) 
 
(1) The importance of the principles of \"universality\" and 
\"inclusiveness\" cannot be overemphasized in the International 
Health Regulations (IHR).  Dr. Jong-wook LEE, 
Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), 
recognized the importance of those principles in his address 
to the World Health Assembly (WHA) on May 18, 2004, by 
stating that \"the SARS epidemic showed us that we cannot 
afford any gap in our global surveillance and response 
network.\" 
 
(2) Epidemics and other international health risks do not 
recognize political borders.  It is of paramount importance 
that the IHR should apply to people, conveyances, cargos 
(sic), containers, and the like from both Member States and 
non-members of the WHO if the WHO is to cope effectively with 
any health risk of international magnitude (e.g. SARS).  This 
is not a political issue, but a health one.  The 
effectiveness of the IHR should not be compromised by any 
unwarranted obstruction. 
 
(3) The forthcoming IHR cannot afford excluding Taiwan. 
Taiwan is not only the 15th largest trading power in the 
world, but also one of the most important international 
transportation hubs linking Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia. 
 
-- (1) In addition to its 23 million people, Taiwan\'s health 
administration annually has to deal with the health matters 
of 22.4 million international air passengers, 161,847 
international flights, 51,000 international-serviced vessels 
and hundreds of millions of tons of international cargo. 
 
-- (2) Moreover, the Taipei Flight Information Region (Taipei 
FIR), an area covering around 200,000 square kilometers 
designated by the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO), with 12 major international air routes as well as 4 
domestic air routes passing through it, constitutes an 
integrated route network.  Over 1.54 million flights receive 
air traffic control services within the Taipei FIR annually. 
This area is an important international air services market 
in the world, where the annual international passenger 
traffic volume is around 22.4 million passengers and the 
freight traffic volume is around 1.47 million tons.  There 
are 38 airlines operating international scheduled services in 
this area, among them 32 foreign carriers, which fly into and 
from there around 150,000 flights each year.  None other but 
Taiwan\'s health administration can enforce the new IHR and 
handle any health-related crises emerging from such a huge 
international traffic volume. 
 
-- (3) It is indisputable that only Taiwan\'s health 
administration and health authorities can enforce the new IHR 
and handle public health emergencies related to such a huge 
volume of international traffic. 
 
(4) In addition, while the 23 million people of Taiwan are 
entitled to equal and fair protection within the new IHR 
system, Taiwan is also committed to doing its part by working 
together with the world community and contributing its 
resources and experience in order to advance the noble goal 
of health for all peoples. 
 
(5) In order to make IHR more inclusive, an amendment to 
Article 65 (*1) in the current draft of the IHR will be 
needed.  The text (*2) presented by the Nicaragua government 
is generally conducive in that regard.  My government 
strongly supports Nicaragua\'s proposal and wants to see the 
amendment of the Article 65 of the draft of IHR in accordance 
with the Nicaragua text. 
 
(6) Articles 65 and 59 of the IHR draft regulate the 
participation of States who are not members of the WHO to the 
new IHR.  Article 65 provides the conditions and procedure 
for non-WHO member states to become a party to the new IHR. 
 
There are two separate  c o n d i t i o n s  for States not 
members of the WHO to become a party to the IHR: 
 
- Already existing legal grounds:  Any State, that is not a 
member of the WHO, needs to be a party to at least one of the 
existing 11 conventions, regulations and similar agreements 
as listed in Article 59; or, 
 
- On \"invitation\" by the Director General:  Any State, that 
is not a member of the WHO, receives from the WHO\'s Director 
General a notification of the adoption of the IHR by the WHA. 
 
The  p r o c e d u r e  to become a party to the IHR first 
requires from the non-member State to meet one of the two 
conditions mentioned above.  After that, it will need to 
notify its acceptance of the IHR to the Director General. 
Finally, entry into force will become effective upon the day 
of the entry into force of the IHR, or, if the acceptance is 
notified after, three months after the date of receipt by the 
Director General. 
- The Republic of China, or Taiwan, in the past has signed 
 6   of   the   11   conventions,   regulations   and 
 similar   agreements  as listed in Article 59 (*3). 
 
- It is proposed that an amendment be made to Article 65 to 
include, in addition to non-member states,  any   entity 
 with   a   separate   health   administration  as well. 
Otherwise, under the current language, it seems only the Holy 
See and Liechtenstein will be qualified. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
 
 
(*1) Article 65 of the current IHR working paper: 
 
\"Any State not a Member of WHO, which is a party to any 
international sanitary agreement or regulations listed in 
Article 59 or to which the Director-General has notified the 
adoption of these Regulations by the Health Assembly, may 
become a party hereto by notifying its acceptance to the 
Director-General and, subject to the provisions of Article 
62, such acceptance shall become effective upon the date of 
entry into force of these Regulations, or, if such acceptance 
is notified after that date, three months after the date of 
receipt by the Director-General of the notification of 
acceptance\". 
 
(*2) The comments presented by the Nicaragua government: 
 
\"Any State not Member (sic) of WHO, which is a party to any 
conventions, regulations, and similar agreement listed in 
Article 48 or to which the Director-General has notified the 
adoption of these Regulations by the World Health Assembly, 
may become a party hereto by notifying its acceptance to the 
Director-General.  In the same way, due to the importance of 
participation of those areas that have independent systems of 
health, these can be parts in the same one, also signing 
their acceptance to the Director-General and, subject to the 
provisions of Article 50, such acceptance shall become 
effective upon the date of entry into force of these 
Regulations, or, if such acceptance is notified after that 
date, three months after the date of receipt by the 
Director-General of the notification of acceptance.\" 
 
(*3) The 6 (six) international health conventions refereed 
(sic) to in Article 59 of the current draft which were signed 
by the Republic of China on Taiwan are: 
 
- International Sanitary Convention, signed in Paris, 21 
January 1926; 
 
- International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation, 
signed at the Hague, 12 April 1933; 
 
- International Sanitary convention (sic), 1944, modifying 
the International Sanitary Convention of 21 June 1926, opened 
for signature in Washington, 15 December 1944; 
 
- Protocol of 23 April 1946 to prolong the International 
Sanitary Convention, 1944, signed in Washington; 
 
- Protocol of 23 April 1946 to prolong the International 
Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation, 1944, signed in 
Washington; 
 
- International Sanitary Regulations, 1951, and the 
Additional Regulations of 1955, 1956, 1960, 1963, and 1965.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: SECRETARY POWELL\'S VISIT TO 
CHINA 
 
A) \"The Message Revealed by Powell\'s Whirlwind Beijing 
Trip\" 
 
The pro-status quo \"China Times\" said in its 
editorial(10/26): 
 
\". Since President Bush\'s remarks before Wen Jiabao 
last year, there has been fine-tuning of the U.S. cross- 
Strait policy.  In addition to asking China not to `use 
force,\' the Republican government is more specific in 
asking Taiwan not to `seek independence.\'  Taiwan 
should not expect that the United States would defend 
Taiwan under any circumstances.  The Bush government in 
its second term will put heavier pressure on Taiwan 
than before. It will make itself clearer and clearer 
regarding [Taiwan\'s] constitutional reforms and 
referenda and will no longer tolerate any tension 
caused by any misjudgment by the two sides. 
 
\"But what really concerns Taiwan is whether the United 
States will push the two sides to go the negotiation 
table next year.  President Chen Shui-bian and Vice 
President Annette Lu repeatedly stressed that early 
spring of 2005 will be a good time for cross-Strait 
talks.  And now judging from Powell\'s remarks and the 
remarks by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice 
on her recent visit to Beijing, one can say there is a 
tacit agreement between Taiwan and the United States 
about resuming cross-Strait talks. . However, the 
United States is pushing for the talks for its own 
interests.  It does not want to get involved in a war 
because of a deadlock, in which the two sides of the 
Strait are to blame.  Since Beijing is insistent on its 
position, [seeking] `concessions by both sides\' will 
very likely become the reasoning behind the United 
States exertion of pressure.  Then, in what ways will 
Taiwan be asked to make concessions may be the focus of 
what we should pay attention to. 
 
\"In other words, we need to take into account the 
upcoming [APEC] Bush-Hu summit, the new cross-Strait 
policy planning of the new U.S. government, and the 
possibility of resuming cross-Strait talks when 
assessing Powell\'s Beijing visit.\" 
 
B) \"Speaking Clearly on Anti-independence and Pro- 
unification, Powell Sacrifices Taiwan Independence; He 
Repeatedly Reiterates That the United States Does Not 
Support Taiwan Independence and Overturns the 
`Ambiguity\' Policy in One Move\" 
 
Washington Correspondent Vincent Chang wrote in the 
conservative/pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
(10/26): 
 
\"On October 25, in addition to a press conference in 
Beijing, Powell was interviewed by Hong Kong\'s Phoenix 
Television and CNN.  The U.S. Department of State, on 
the other side of the world, released the entire 
transcripts of the press conference and the interviews 
even faster than the TV broadcasted [them]. 
 
\"Powell\'s remarks denying `Taiwan\' is a sovereign and 
independent nation, on the one hand, indicates that 
cross-Strait tension resulting from the various radical 
measures taken by the DPP government since 2003 on the 
referendum issue has made the Bush administration, 
which has been friendly to Taiwan, determined to 
frankly express its attitude without any ambiguity.  On 
the other hand, this reflects the reality that the Bush 
administration must be engaged with the mainland.  As a 
result, it finally decided to sacrifice Taiwan 
independence. 
 
\"These two statements by Powell, which can be said as 
unheard of before to Taiwan, will rattle the most 
sensitive nerves between the two sides of the Strait 
for some time.  How President Chen Shui-bian [should] 
face this final move by the United States to completely 
cut off any ambiguous link between `one-China\' and 
`Taiwan independence,\' and the fact that the United 
States may play a role in `facilitating unification,\' 
is testing his wisdom as the head of state.\" 
 
C) \"The Pressure to Resume [Cross-Strait] Dialogue 
Falls on China\" 
 
Journalist Huang Chung-jung commented in the pro- 
independence \"Liberty Times\" (10/26): 
 
\". U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell visited Beijing 
and urged China to resume talks with Taiwan.  The move 
evidently shows that the United States is aware that 
the key to the deadlocked cross-Strait situation does 
not lie in Taiwan.  In order to defend its best 
interests in Asia, the United States will definitely 
put the pressure of resuming [cross-Strait] dialogue on 
China so as to effectively alleviate the tensions 
across the Taiwan Strait. . 
 
\"Judged from the strategic interests of those 
democratic countries like the United States and Japan, 
it would constitute a direct threat to these countries\' 
security if Taiwan were annexed by China.  As a result, 
to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait is in 
the best interests of these democratic alliance 
countries - namely, Taiwan can maintain its sovereign 
and independent status and help the democratic camp 
whenever necessary.  In the meantime, these countries 
also do not hope to see any moves that could provoke 
Beijing to use force against Taiwan. . 
 
\"The United States must urge China to engage in a 
dialogue with Taiwan because alleviating the cross- 
Strait situation will not increase Washington\'s burdens 
when it has to deal with other issues like North Korea 
and anti-terrorism.  Such a development would also be 
conducive for the re-election of the Bush 
administration.  This is exactly one of the major 
missions of Powell\'s trip to East Asia.\" 
 
D) \"Powell Visit No Cause for Panic\" 
 
The pro-independence, English language \"Taipei Times\" 
editorialed (10/26): 
 
\"U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell is set to discuss 
Taiwan\'s arms procurement plan with China when visiting 
Beijing next week. China\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Spokesperson Zhang Qiyue confirmed that Beijing and 
Washington will talk about the US-Taiwan arms deal, the 
cancellation of Taiwan-U.S. military exchanges and the 
Taiwan independence issue. Her words have caused a 
commotion in Taiwan\'s media. Independent Legislator 
Sisy Chen even said the United States will soon scrap 
its arms deal with Taiwan. 
 
\"But if we study the situation carefully, it\'s clear 
that the United States only says that it expects to 
have a chance to respond to the issue regarding the 
proposed arms deal. In other words, Washington\'s 
position will be `passive.\' This stance is completely 
different from taking the initiative to discuss it, and 
the pan-blue camp is in fact creating trouble for 
itself by sensationalizing the issue. . 
 
\"Powell\'s decision to visit Japan, China and South 
Korea on the eve of the U.S. election is clearly aimed 
at achieving various diplomatic and domestic political 
goals. Although Taiwan needs to keep a close eye on 
Sino-US relations, and take precautions against the 
United States sacrificing Taiwan to win China\'s 
cooperation for its own advantage, we should watch 
developments calmly, avoiding reading too much into any 
given situation and frightening ourselves as a result.\"

SUBJECT: ANATOMY OF A TAIWANESE LY ELECTION 
 
REF: TAIPEI 02662 
 
1. (U) Summary: Individual and party strategies for the 
December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) election will be shaped in 
large part by Taiwan\'s complex election system, which 
combines direct elections with proportional representation. 
The structures of both the direct and proportional elections 
promote smaller parties and more extremist candidates, and 
facilitate factionalization within the two major parties. 
Furthermore, the multi-member districts used in the direct 
elections encourage parties and candidates to focus on 
tactics over issues.  If the National Assembly confirms the 
constitutional revisions passed in August to reform the LY\'s 
structure, this will be the last election conducted under the 
system.  End Summary. 
 
The Constituency Seats 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) Campaign season is underway for the 6th Legislative 
Yuan, which will start its three year term on February 1, 
2005.  All 225 seats in the LY are at stake in the elections 
scheduled for December 11.  Of these, 176 will be directly 
elected from 29 geographical electoral districts, each 
corresponding to a city, a county, or a subdivision of a 
large city or county, and two ethnic districts reserved for 
plains and mountain aborigines, respectively.  Based on 
population, each geographic constituency sends from one to 
thirteen representatives to the LY.  The aboriginal districts 
are fixed at four members each.  However, no matter how many 
members will represent each district, voters everywhere get 
only one vote to use on one candidate each.  Those candidates 
receiving the most votes win the election.  Any surplus votes 
cast for a particular candidate beyond the number required to 
get elected cannot be used to help another candidate from the 
same party who did not get enough votes. 
 
The Single Non-Transferable Vote System 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) This system, known as single non-transferable vote 
(SNTV) balloting, can and often does result in strange 
election outcomes.  In the 2001 LY elections in Nantou County 
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took 35.1% of the vote 
and won two seats.  The KMT, despite doing slightly better 
with 37.5% of the vote won only one seat, the same number as 
the People First Party (PFP), which took 11.7% of the vote, 
or less than a third of the KMT\'s share.  The reason for 
these anomalous results was the overwhelming popularity of 
one KMT candidate, former Kaohsiung mayor Wu Dun-yi.  Wu took 
the lion\'s share of the KMT vote and left his colleague with 
too few votes to get elected.  Under the SNTV system, 
candidates compete not only against candidates from the 
opposition parties, but also against others from their own 
party. 
 
Nomination Strategy is Key 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Taiwan\'s SNTV election system requires that parties 
accurately predict how much support they will get in each 
district so that they can nominate the right number of 
candidates.  A party that nominates too many candidates in a 
district risks spreading its votes too thinly and losing 
seats.  Likewise, nominating too few candidates means 
forfeiting seats that might easily have been captured.  Yet 
even a party that perfectly forecasts its support level in a 
district and nominates an appropriate number of candidates 
could have its plans spoiled if the disgruntled candidates it 
did not nominate decide to run anyway as independents, 
cannibalizing their former party\'s vote.  Such so-called 
\"mavericks\" rarely get elected, but they often dramatically 
influence the outcome of tight contests. 
 
Vote Distribution Tactics 
------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Nominating the right number of candidates is only half 
the battle.  A successful campaign also depends on optimally 
sharing votes among the nominees to avoid the type of 
lopsided distribution that was so disastrous for the KMT in 
the 2001 Nantou election.  In rural districts this is often 
accomplished by focusing the campaign on different candidates 
in different areas or having local factions and organizations 
like Farmers Associations rally their respective members 
around specific candidates.  These techniques are less 
effective in urban areas, where voters are harder to 
subdivide geographically and are more influenced by the media 
than by community leaders and social institutions.  In 
response to this, some parties try to implement coordinated 
vote-distribution (\"peipiao\") schemes where loyal voters are 
asked to support a specific candidate based on things like 
the month of their birth or the last digit of their national 
ID number. 
 
Reserved Seats for Women 
------------------------ 
 
6. (U) Complicating Taiwan\'s constituency LY elections 
further, a rule stipulates that at least one of every five 
seats in a district must go to a woman, even if male 
candidates receive more votes.  This adds yet another layer 
of complexity to the tactical considerations that go into a 
campaign in districts with five or more seats at stake. 
Popular DPP incumbent Su Chih-fen\'s decision not to run for 
reelection in Yunlin County, for example, led some to 
speculate that part of her motivation was to leave the 
reserved female seat for her ally Yin Ling-ying of the Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU). 
 
The At-Large Seats 
-------------------- 
 
7. (U) The 49 remaining seats in the LY are considered \"at 
large\" and are filled according to proportional 
representation.  Votes for candidates in all of the SNTV 
districts are tallied according to party, and parties that 
receive at least 5% of the total popular vote divide the 
at-large seats according to their share of the vote.  Because 
eight of the at-large seats are reserved for the \"overseas 
Chinese\" community, parties actually nominate candidates for 
the proportional seats on two separate lists.  Predictably, 
the definition of \"overseas Chinese\" is often stretched by 
candidates hoping to get nominated to that list.  It is not 
unheard of for politicians to have family members in the US 
petition for their immigration shortly before an election so 
they can move overseas and be eligible for nomination.  After 
winning election, they move back to Taiwan to serve their 
term.  In an even more peculiar twist, an overseas candidate, 
if elected, must renounce any foreign citizenship in order to 
be seated.  If they wish to run for reelection as an overseas 
candidate, they must then renew their overseas status, for 
example by obtaining a new immigrant visa.  However, in the 
end, no party renominated an incumbent \"overseas Chinese\" 
legislator, obviating the need for a ruling by the Central 
Election Committee on what constitutes an \"expatriate.\" 
 
Ramifications : Tactics Over Issues 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) Taiwan\'s complicated electoral system for the LY has a 
number of important political ramifications.  At the party 
level, the peculiar requirements of the SNTV system cause 
parties to expend much of their focus and energy on voting 
mechanics.  The main strategic concern is nominating the 
right number of candidates in each district, and the campaign 
is then dominated by tactical concerns like mobilizing voters 
and distributing them equally among candidates.  Policies and 
issues tend to take a back seat.  Issue-based campaigns, in 
particular, are to be avoided because they can easily lead to 
a situation where one candidate becomes too popular and 
thereby squeezes out other allied candidates. 
 
Intra-Party Factionalism 
------------------------ 
 
9. (U) Furthermore, because candidates compete with members 
of their own party as much as (if not more than) with members 
of opposition parties, SNTV encourages intra-party 
factionalism and an emphasis on local connections and 
personalities.  Those in danger of losing an election, 
particularly, tend to focus their attacks on members of their 
own party rather than the opposition, because it is far 
easier to steal votes from an ideologically similar opponent. 
 A breakdown in discipline is especially likely if a party 
has overnominated, or there are too many mavericks.  In such 
situations, candidates decide it is \"every candidate for 
himself,\" peipiao schemes are abandoned, and a better 
disciplined party usually claims an extra seat or two. 
 
10. (U) Factionalism rears its ugly head in the at-large 
elections as well.  The at-large seats added in 1991, 
ostensibly to represent the mainland and overseas Chinese 
communities, were unofficially intended as a means of 
increasing party cohesion and bringing more professionals and 
minorities into the LY.  In reality, positions on the 
nomination list for these \"safe\" seats are often treated as a 
currency for party leaders to buy the loyalty of various 
party factions. 
 
Independents, Gangsters and Vote-Buying 
--------------------------------------- 
 
11. (U) Additionally, the low election threshold in 
multi-member districts makes it possible for independents, 
single-issue candidates, gangster bosses, or anybody else 
with strong personal connections and deep pockets to win and 
hold onto an LY seat.  In Taoyuan county\'s thirteen member 
district, for example, a reliable 4-5% of the vote is all 
that is necessary to take a seat.  The margin of victory 
between the last-place winner and the first runner-up in the 
larger districts also tends to be extremely small (often just 
a few hundred votes) increasing the temptation for, and 
effectiveness of, vote-buying and voter intimidation. 
 
Changes Likely for Next Election 
-------------------------------- 
 
12. (U) A proposed constitutional amendment passed by the LY 
in August (reftel) will halve the number of seats in the LY 
to 113, lengthen the term to four years (to match that of the 
Presidency), eliminate the \"overseas Chinese\" seats and 
replace SNTV with a single member district \"first past the 
post\" system.  This will help address the many obvious flaws 
in the existing system and weed out extremist and nuisance 
legislators from the LY.  However the amendment has not yet 
been approved by the National Assembly and any changes would 
not take effect until 2008.  The current election will be 
held under the old rules and all the complications arising 
out of that system will be a prominent part of the campaign, 
as they have been in past elections.

REF: STATE 225331 
 
1. (SBU) While delivering reftel demarche to the Taiwan 
Center for Disease Control on October 21, AIT became 
acquainted with the CDC\'s new director, Steve H.S. Kuo.  Kuo 
introduced himself, saying that he just assumed his new 
position on October 18, after working in Washington for four 
years as the Health Advisor at the Taipei Economic and 
Cultural Representative Office (TECRO).  He explained that in 
the post-SARS era, political will in Taiwan was strong for 
expanding the government\'s capacity for dealing with future 
outbreaks of infectious diseases.  Kuo detailed some of the 
changes: the CDC\'s budget has been increased from $61 million 
to $100 million a year; it is actively recruiting young, 
ambitious physicians, expanding its medical staff from 3 to 
30; and there is a proposal currently under consideration 
that would earmark an additional $300 million to finance a 
new vaccine production facility in Taiwan that would combat 
avian flu and other diseases. 
 
2. (SBU) Kuo described his efforts to increase cooperation 
between the Taiwan CDC and its US counterpart.  He said that 
a 1994 umbrella agreement between the Taiwan Department of 
Health (DOH) and the US CDC was a good foundation for such 
cooperation, citing the example of a 1999 implementation of 
that agreement for a joint project to control the spread of 
tuberculosis.  Taiwan, he explained, is an important partner 
for the US in a global public health network.  Every year 
millions of Taiwanese businesspeople and tourists travel to 
and from the Mainland, including those parts of southern 
China where many infectious diseases first appear.  With its 
sophisticated detection technology and modern, transparent 
public health infrastructure, he said, Taiwan is ideally 
situated to act as a \"sentinel\" for new diseases coming out 
of China.  He said that he looked forward to any 
opportunities to cooperate with the US and that he envisioned 
Taiwan becoming an essential part of a global disease 
prevention network.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) In what Hewlett-Packard (HP) Taiwan has described 
privately as an &ambush,8 President Chen publicly called on 
visiting HP chairman Carly Fiorina to promote cross-Strait 
direct charter flights with Beijing.  HP responded by 
publicly declining any role in dealing with political matters 
such as cross-Strait relations.  HP had understood that the 
meeting would not include press and would only be a courtesy 
call.  However, HP should not have been surprised by Chen\'s 
desire to use the event to further the cause of direct links 
and may have worsened the situation by attracting further 
media attention.  HP told AIT/T econ and comm officers that 
the row may cause HP to reexamine future plans for business 
in Taiwan.  End summary. 
 
Dueling Statements 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U) On Friday, October 15, Hewlett-Packard\'s visiting 
chairman and CEO Carly Fiorina paid a courtesy call on Taiwan 
President Chen Shui-bian.  During the meeting, Chen read a 
statement to the press calling on Fiorina and HP to send a 
message to Beijing promoting direct cross-Strait charter 
flights.  The meeting received broad media coverage in 
Taiwan.  A few hours after the meeting, HP released a short 
statement explaining that businessmen should concentrate on 
business, and political questions should be solved by 
politicians.  The statement said HP would not participate in 
any political discussions.  On Saturday, the Presidential 
Office released its reaction to HP\'s rebuttal.  The 
President\'s spokesman said that HP had misinterpreted Chen\'s 
speech.  He said Chen had not intended to solicit Fiorina\'s 
help as an intermediary; he had only wanted to underscore the 
benefits of direct transportation links to both the public 
and private sector.  The spokesman noted that the President 
doesn\'t need a private sector go-between to deal with 
cross-Strait relations. 
 
HP Angry and Frustrated 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (C) HP was angry about the way the meeting was handled 
and the content of the President\'s statement.  According to 
Rosemary Ho, Managing Director of HP Taiwan, the Presidential 
Office had requested the meeting and gave HP no warning that 
the content would be so political and sensitive.  When HP 
scheduled the meeting they provided a list of 
business-related topics for discussion.  The Presidential 
Office told them that there was no time for so much substance 
and the meeting should instead be a friendly exchange of 
courtesies.  HP also believes it had a clear understanding 
with the Presidential Office that there would be no press at 
the meeting.  Ho said that she had confirmed the no press 
conditions several times before the meeting.  Furthermore, 
reporters and cameras left immediately after the President\'s 
statement, giving Fiorina no opportunity to respond publicly. 
 
4.  (C) Ho stated that although HP had previously called 
privately for direct charter flights, they have never done so 
publicly.  She noted that in earlier discussions with 
Ministry of Economic Affairs officials they have maintained 
that they would deny promoting charter flights if exposed 
publicly.  HP may fear difficulty doing business in the PRC 
if it becomes too closely linked to Chen Shui-bian and his 
cross-Strait agenda.  HP is particularly sensitive to PRC 
concerns on cross-Strait issues right now, so soon after the 
PRC\'s cool reaction to Chen\'s overtures in his October 10 
National Day speech.  HP is the biggest foreign buyer of 
Taiwan products.  In Chen\'s own statement he pointed out that 
HP accounted for one third of the total value of Taiwan 
products sold to foreign firms.  So, HP was especially 
dismayed that the President would treat Taiwan\'s biggest 
customer in this way. 
 
Presidential Office Offers Different Version of Events 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5. (C) Presidential Office aide Liu Shih-chung offered a very 
different version of events.  Liu said it was HP that asked 
for the meeting, and denied that there was any intention to 
\"ambush\" Fioirina.  \"Frankly, we treated this just as one of 
the other many courtesy calls the president has each day,\" 
Liu remarked, adding that little effort was put into 
preparing the president to discuss substantive issues.  Liu 
attributed HP\'s reaction to hyper-sensitivity on Ho\'s part. 
Liu asserted that Ho met with President Chen in 2003 and 
offered to \"use her contacts in Beijing\" to help jumpstart 
direct charter flights.  Liu said that Chen humored her by 
saying that he welcomed her efforts, but it appeared in 
retrospect that Ho left convinced she was authorized by the 
president to serve as a special channel.  Liu suggested that 
Ho, witnessing recent PRC discrimination against pro-DPP 
business people on the Mainland, feared that Chen\'s comments 
on direct links might remind Beijing of her past efforts as a 
self-appointed \"secret envoy\" for the Chen administration. 
Separately, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Senior Vice 
Chairman Chiu Tai-san offered a similar assessment.  \"Chen\'s 
public remarks at the meeting were simply a rehash of the 
same points he has used in every single meeting with business 
leaders or Taishang (Taiwan investors) over the past three 
weeks,\" Chiu asserted. 
 
HP Reevaluating Taiwan Plans 
---------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) After the spate of media coverage of the 
controversial meeting caused in large part by HP\'s public 
rebuke of the President, HP is keeping quiet for now.  They 
have not made any public statement since Friday evening\'s 
short press release, and will wait until media attention is 
fully drawn to other issues.  However, Ho told AIT/T that HP 
would now reexamine its plans for business in Taiwan in light 
of the run-in with the President. 
 
7.  (C) HP has a strong interest in establishing charter air 
cargo flights from its factories in Shanghai to Taipei.  HP 
has been developing a plan that would expand the use of 
Taipei as a logistics hub for notebook computer deliveries 
around the world.  HP ships 36,000 tons of notebook computers 
every year by airfreight primarily from Eastern China -- 
enough to fill 366 planes. According to Ho, HP estimates it 
can save USD 30 million per year by shipping notebook 
computers from assembly plants near Shanghai to the U.S. and 
Europe via Taipei instead of directly from Shanghai.  Because 
cargo space on flights out of Shanghai is so costly and 
unpredictable, HP believes that it can achieve these savings 
if it can take advantage of reliable charter flights from 
Shanghai to Taipei.  Ironically, the President\'s effort to 
promote this key element in HP\'s plan may lead HP to 
reconsider its strategy to Taiwan\'s detriment economically. 
 
Comment ) Impact on Business and Cross-Strait Relations 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
8.  (C) In the meeting with AIT/T, HP\'s Ho was clearly 
frustrated and angry at Chen\'s office.  The perception that 
Chen \"ambushed\" Fiorina has compromised HP Taiwan within the 
firm and damaged HP\'s goodwill toward Taiwan.  In addition, 
the executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in 
Taiwan told AIT/T that the effects may well spread to other 
multi-nationals in Taiwan who may think twice before meeting 
with the President and possibly other high-level officials as 
well.  Ho expressed dismay at the President\'s motivation for 
taking this approach, noting that it could actually harm 
efforts to establish direct links by alienating businesses 
that would otherwise be natural allies. 
 
9.  (C) However, HP must share some blame.  Ho and her 
associates should not have been surprised by the change in 
ground rules for the meeting, which may have been due in part 
to miscommunication.  The Presidential Office may have 
mistakenly understood that HP\'s concern about the press 
applied only to certain business-sensitive issues that were 
included in HP\'s original suggested topics for discussion. 
Furthermore, Chen\'s frequent use of the press at high-level 
meetings to pursue his public relations goals is well known. 
Even after confirmation of &no press8 ground rules, HP 
Taiwan executives should have been prepared for the 
possibility that they would be ignored.  They may also have 
overreacted to the content of his statement, which did not 
break new territory for Chen.  Their press statement in 
response only attracted more media attention to the incident. 
 It is likely that this was just a miscalculation on the part 
of the Presidential Office.  Taiwan officials have 
consistently told AIT/T that making progress on Taiwan\'s 
terms on direct air links and charter flights in particular 
is one of the President\'s highest priorities.  Unfortunately, 
this latest maneuver was probably counterproductive.

SUBJECT: KAOHSIUNG PROTESTS SECRETARY POWELL\'S REMARKS 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU) A candidate in Taiwan\'s upcoming Legislative Yuan 
(LY) elections led a group of around 20 supporters to 
protest in front of AIT Kaohsiung the morning of October 27. 
The protest was noisy, but peaceful, and dispersed within 
half an hour, after a letter of protest was read out for 
television and print reporters present and then delivered to 
AIT Kaohsiung.  The LY candidate, Huang Wan-chuan, is a 
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) candidate from Kaohsiung 
County.  In his speech and letter of protest, Huang 
expressed \"anger and regret for the Secretary\'s comments in 
Beijing that Taiwan is not a sovereign state.\"  Noting that 
the U.S. \"recognized Taiwan\'s democracy\", Huang stated that 
Taiwan had its people, government and controlled its own 
territory, all of which \"indisputably comprised the 
components of a sovereign county.\" 
 
2.  (SBU) Separately, the afternoon of October 27, Yan Wen- 
li, the chairman/owner of a popular local radio station, 
\"Boss (chu-ren) Radio\" notified AIT Kaohsiung that he would 
lead a group of employees to AIT Kaohsiung offices to 
deliver a protest of Secretary Powell\'s remarks.  The radio 
station also issued a press release on their plans to 
protest at AIT.  Yan arrived with about a dozen members of 
his reporting/editorial staff and presented AIT Kaohsiung 
with a framed letter, \"thanking Secretary Powell for 
reminding the people of Taiwan that they have not yet 
achieved their independence.\"  Yan asserted that Secretary 
Powell\'s remarks would help invigorate the Taiwan 
independence movement and ensure the founding of the new 
nation named \"Taiwan.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) In both instances, Kaohsiung City police were 
aware of the planned protests at least an hour or so before 
they occurred and provided more than sufficient extra police 
to ensure the small protests were well-controlled and 
prevented from blocking the entrance to the commercial 
building in which AIT Kaohsiung is located and/or the floor 
on which AIT Kaohsiung\'s office suite is located.  Both 
protests were orderly and dissipated rapidly after the 
written protests were delivered to AIT Kaohsiung. 
 
4.  (SBU) Comment: The protests, while small and brief, are 
representative of the reaction among many here in the 
heartland of Taiwan\'s minority \"pro-independence movement\" 
to media reports of the Secretary\'s interviews.  Popular 
political talk shows on local television and radio stations 
have also been full of similar sentiments from those 
sympathetic to Taiwan independence.  As Taiwan is also in 
the midst of an LY election season, the debate around these 
issues undoubtedly will be seized upon by candidates to gain 
attention.  For that reason, we would not be surprised to 
see further such protests in the coming days.

1. (C) Summary: Foreign Minister Mark Chen asked the AIT 
Director to a meeting October 26 to seek clarification over a 
set of interviews given by Secretary Powell in Beijing on 
October 24.  Chen said the Secretary\'s reported statements on 
eventual reunification and Taiwan\'s lack of sovereignty 
deeply \"hurt the feelings of the Taiwanese people\" and 
appeared to be a departure from past U.S. policies and 
commitments.  Chen requested that the USG make further public 
clarifications over the matter in order to avoid further 
damage to the relationship.  The Director responded that 
there has been no change in U.S. policy nor did the Secretary 
intend to signal one.  He added that the Secretary\'s visit to 
Beijing was aimed at advancing cross-Strait dialogue and 
defending Taiwan\'s right to participate in APEC and the World 
Health Organization (WHO).  The Director cautioned, however, 
that repeated public statements over Taiwan\'s sovereignty led 
reporters to press the Secretary on the question of Taiwan\'s 
sovereignty, an issue we have long sought to avoid speaking 
about openly.  End Summary. 
 
Clarification, Not a Protest 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Foreign Minister Mark Chen asked the AIT Director in 
for an urgent meeting October 26 regarding a set of 
interviews Secretary Powell gave on October 24 in Beijing. 
Chen emphasized that the meeting was to seek further 
clarification, and he did not intend to deliver a formal 
protest.  Chen noted that the government was under intense 
pressure from the media and Legislative Yuan (LY) over the 
Secretary\'s statement that Taiwan was not a sovereign 
 
SIPDIS 
independent country and suggestion that the USG supports 
eventual unification.  Chen stated that the reason the 
Secretary\'s statements had caused so much harm to the Taiwan 
 
SIPDIS 
people was that they came from the United States, Taiwan\'s 
best friend.  \"If it was China or anyone else, we could 
understand it,\" he added, \"but coming from the United States, 
it is a deep shock.\"  Chen said he was especially surprised 
that the U.S. made such a \"heavy\" statement after months of 
effort on Taipei\'s part to reopen dialogue with Beijing. 
 
Violation of the Six Assurances? 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Chen noted that the State Department Spokesman\'s 
October 25 clarification addressed Taipei\'s concern over the 
reference to reunification.  Chen asserted, however, that the 
Secretary\'s remarks about Taiwan\'s sovereignty appeared to 
 
SIPDIS 
violate the \"Six Assurances\" provided to Taiwan by the United 
States in 1982.  Chen said that he could tell the media and 
public that U.S. policy has not changed, but no one would 
believe him because the Secretary\'s statement on Taiwan\'s 
sovereignty did depart from the long-standing USG practice of 
remaining silent on the issue of Taiwan\'s status.  Chen 
asserted that the Secretary\'s statement would undermine the 
Taipei government\'s attempts to build a consensus behind 
renewed dialogue with Beijing and give the PRC less reason to 
engage with Taipei. 
 
4. (C) The Director responded that the \"Six Assurances\" only 
committed the United States not to change its position on 
Taiwan\'s status, not whether or not it would state what that 
position is.  He noted that the Secretary\'s statement that 
Taiwan is not a sovereign, independent country reflects a 
policy that has been in place since 1978.  The Director 
acknowledged that we try to avoid having to publicly explain 
our position, but pointed out that Taiwan\'s status only 
became a major public issue after President Chen Shui-bian 
and other senior Taiwan officials repeatedly drew attention 
to it.  The Director reminded FM Chen that the Secretary\'s 
comments came in response to a quite specific question about 
whether the U.S. endorsed President Chen\'s recent assertion 
that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country.  He added 
that Taipei\'s insistence on this formulation has also 
provided Beijing an excuse not to respond to Taiwan\'s recent 
offers to restart dialogue. 
 
Managing the Media 
------------------ 
5. (C) The Foreign Minister said he took the Director\'s 
point, but stated that \"it is too much to ask\" for President 
Chen or his ministers to deny they represent a sovereign and 
independent country.  However, Chen insisted that the most 
important task at hand was to prevent the episode from 
further damaging the relationship.  In this context, Chen 
requested that the Secretary \"or one of his deputies\" find an 
opportunity in the coming days to fully clarify the U.S. 
position. 
 
6. (C) The Director said he would convey this request, but 
suggested that Chen and other Taiwan leaders take a more 
active role in shaping the public response.  The Director 
noted that the purpose of the Secretary\'s visit to Beijing 
was not to give media interviews, but to press Beijing on 
issues of concern to Taipei.  In addition to encouraging 
Beijing to respond positively to President Chen\'s October 10 
address, the Director said the Secretary pressed PRC leaders 
on Taipei\'s participation in APEC and the WHO and restated 
that we would not yield to demands to cease arms sales.  The 
Director asserted that if Taiwan focuses on the positive 
elements of the relationship, it will demonstrate the 
strength of ties between the two sides.  However, if it 
dwells on issues where we differ, such as Taiwan\'s status, it 
will only increase attention to differences. 
 
Media Groundrules 
----------------- 
 
7. (C) Chen said that he would be talking to the media later 
in the day, but promised to keep the Director\'s meeting out 
of the press.  However, as the meeting closed, there was a 
reporter waiting outside of Chen\'s office to take still 
photos of the Director and Foreign Minister departing.  AIT 
will report media reaction Septel. 
 
Comment: Damage Control Overdrive 
--------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The Foreign Minister and other senior officials remain 
in a high state of agitation over the media and political 
fallout from the Secretary\'s interview.  FM Chen was clearly 
seeking a more public USG clarification of the Secretary\'s 
remarks rather than insights into why they may have been 
made.  Chen did acknowledge the broader policy context, but 
only after several attempts were made to frame the issue for 
him.  Even then, however, his mind was focused on how to get 
the issue off the front pages before his next appearance 
before the LY and how to phrase the U.S. stance to his boss, 
President Chen.

CHINA AND U.S. POLICY 
 
 
A) \"The United States Has Decided Not to Play the 
Marginal Game of Taiwan Independence Along with 
President Chen\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
said in its editorial (10/27): 
 
\"As the U.S. presidential election campaign entered its 
last week, Secretary of State Colin Powell disclosed in 
Beijing a new framework for U.S.-China policy.  There 
are new elements in this framework.  Some people in 
Washington believe it `has changed U.S. policy.\' 
 
\"From the perspective of the campaign, Powell appears 
to be telling American voters that the U.S. government 
will not get itself involved in any cross-Strait 
confrontations.  From the perspective of policy, this 
indicates that the Bush administration is making an 
overall revision of its `unilaterialism,\' including its 
China policy. 
 
\". In Powell\'s new framework, the U.S. `one-China\' 
policy remains unchanged.  His mentioning of `seeking 
peaceful reunification\' also increased China\'s 
political profit.  Therefore, the main pressure is on 
Taiwan.  The United States believes the head of 
Taiwan\'s government is seeking Taiwan independence. 
But this is not in the interest of the United States 
and China.  In other words, neither of them needs to 
make any changes under the new framework.  The one that 
must change is the Taiwan authority. .\" 
 
B) \"Facilitating a Dialogue or Facilitating 
Unification?\" 
 
An unsigned commentary in the pro-status quo \"China 
Times\" said (10/27): 
 
\"Why has the United States changed its position from 
Bush\'s remarks of `sparing no effort to defend Taiwan\' 
and the principle that `Taiwan\'s future should be 
decided with the consent of its people\' into Powell\'s 
saying `Taiwan is not a sovereign state and the two 
sides across the Strait should move toward peaceful 
reunification\'? 
 
\"To speak frankly, Bush is not to blame.  Imagine you 
are Bush.  Just as you have been supporting Taiwan to 
the point of nearly clashing with China, Chen Shui-bian 
does not even inform you of his intention to hold 
referendum to help his re-election.  When you send a 
secret envoy to Taiwan to mediate, he returns empty- 
 
SIPDIS 
handed.  Under these circumstances, could you continue 
your support?\" 
 
C) \"The Words Are Ear-piercing; Taiwan Cannot Be 
Unalarmed; Powell\'s Remarks Indicate That There Is Less 
U.S. Ambiguity Toward Taiwan Independence; No Matter 
Whether U.S. Policy Has Changed, the Feeling of 
Interactions Have Been Different; Taipei Should Be More 
Sensitive\" 
 
Washington Correspondent Nadia Tsao of the pro- 
independence \"Liberty Times\" noted (10/27): 
 
\"Another issue which is worth noticing is that the 
atmosphere seems to be different between Taiwan and the 
Bush administration.  Although the policy remains 
unchanged; the communication channels are still there; 
and the United States cannot `sell\' Taiwan because of 
the North Korean issue, etc, some officials, including 
Powell, seem to believe that Taiwan has deliberately 
misunderstood U.S. policy or ignored U.S. thinking. 
This has increased U.S. difficulty in `managing\' its 
cross-strait policy. 
 
\"In the interviews, Powell openly praised China\'s 
diplomatic endeavors as maturing while having warned 
Taiwan many times [that it needed to act more 
maturely].  Even if Powell may not stay [in his 
position], whether this kind of thinking will become 
mainstream in the new Bush administration is something 
Taiwan can not overlook.\" 
 
D) \"Taiwan\'s Independence is an Objective Fact; It Will 
Not Disappear Because of Negligence by Others; Lame- 
Duck Secretary of State Powell\'s Remarks in Beijing 
Disgraced the Taiwan People and Himself As Well\" 
 
The pro-independence, \"Taiwan Daily\" editorialized 
(10/27): 
 
\". Everybody knows that Powell is almost certain to 
leave his position as Secretary of State even if Bush 
wins re-election.  On all major international issues, 
Powell\'s viewpoints differ greatly from those of Vice 
President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.. 
During the most heated time of the [election] campaign, 
when there seems to be no one in control in the White 
House, a lame-duck secretary of state went to China for 
his commencement trip.  He said in press interviews 
several sentences that no one could tell there is 
anything new except those who know the subtle 
relationship between the United States, China, and 
Taiwan very well.  The issue how should one interpret 
his remarks will certainly keep U.S., Chinese and 
Taiwan experts busy for some time. .\" 
 
E) \"Democracy, Yes; Sovereignty, No\" 
 
A commentary by Academia Sinica research fellow Hsu 
Yung-ming in the pro-status quo \"China Times\" said 
(10/27): 
 
\". This frank statement [by Powell] seems to have 
broken the myth that many of us have had regarding 
Taiwan\'s democratic development: democracy does not 
mean sovereignty.  Supporting Taiwan\'s democratization 
does not equal supporting the Taiwan people regarding 
being their own master.  The U.S. treatment of Taiwan\'s 
position is not much better than Beijing\'s treatment of 
Hong Kong.  At least Tung Chee Wah can go to Beijing. 
Can Chen Shui-bian go to Washington? 
 
\"The DPP government should let the public know about 
the difference between being democratic and enjoying 
sovereignty.  The Blue and the Green camps should 
express their positions toward this disconnect. . The 
main point is whether we want both democracy and 
sovereignty or can we tolerate democracy without 
sovereignty.  There is no room for ambiguity any 
longer. .\" 
 
F) \"Poor Word Choice or a Policy Shift?\" 
 
The pro-independence, English language, \"Taipei Times\" 
commented in an editorial (10/27): 
 
\"U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said on Monday 
that Taiwan is not a sovereign and independent country. 
The question is: Is Powell really clear on what he is 
talking about? If the status of Taiwan really is what 
Powell claims it to be, then his statement could be 
interpreted as meaning either that sovereignty over 
Taiwan remains undetermined, as stated in the 1952 San 
Francisco Peace Treaty, or that Taiwan comes under the 
sovereignty of China. 
 
\"The question of whether this China is the Republic of 
China (ROC) or the People\'s Republic of China (PRC) 
will surely lead to further dispute. To those 
interpreting Powell\'s statement as meaning that Taiwan 
belongs to the PRC, we can only say that this goes 
further than any of the communiqus signed by 
Washington and Beijing, and it is not consistent with 
the U.S.\' position. 
 
\". When U.S. officials speak on the international stage 
about Taiwan\'s lack of national sovereignty, they 
clearly demonstrate how perilous Taiwan\'s situation is 
today -- even its closest friend finds itself unable to 
lend public support. 
 
\"Only if Taiwanese show determination and are willing 
to defend themselves at any cost will they be able to 
avoid being swallowed up by China by one means or 
another. Beijing\'s most devious ploy is to get 
Taiwanese to take national defense lightly. 
 
\"If Taiwan loses its military ability to oppose China\'s 
threats, what reason would Beijing have to sit down at 
the negotiating table to engage in substantive and 
meaningful talks with Taiwan? China would be able to 
threaten Taiwan militarily at any time -- and continue 
to do so until this nation surrenders. If this is a 
situation that the pan-blue camp finds intolerable, 
then they have no reason to oppose the arms-procurement 
budget that has turned the Legislative Yuan into a 
battleground. 
 
\"Taiwan meets all the conditions for being a modern 
democratic nation, so Powell\'s comments about Taiwan 
not having sovereignty are a slap in the face. Unless 
the people of Taiwan are willing to face the same fate 
as the residents of Hong Kong and Macao, then there is 
only one thing they can do. They must convince the 
legislators they elected to represent them that Taiwan 
must equip itself with advanced weapons. The government 
must accelerate the development of a society sharing a 
strong sense of common identity. The people and the 
government must show their determined resistance to 
communist rule. This is a road that Taiwan has no 
choice but to follow.\"

SUBJECT:  TAIWAN: LATE-SEASON TYPHOON STRIKES TAIWAN 
 
1. Summary.  Typhoon Nock-ten struck Taiwan\'s northeast on 
October 25.  Nock-ten moved more swiftly than July\'s Typhoon 
Mindulle and August\'s Aere and caused less damage. 
Nevertheless, four people were killed, one remains missing, 
and more than 100 were injured.  Taipei was one of the 
hardest hit areas.  Schools and offices in Taipei and some 
eastern cities were closed, and financial markets were shut 
down for one day.  380,000 households lost power, but 
service was restored quickly to most.  Taiwan\'s Council on 
Agriculture estimates total agricultural losses to be USD 
8.75 million.  End summary. 
 
 
Strong Winds and Floods 
----------------------- 
 
2. Gusting winds and torrential rains battered northern 
Taiwan as Typhoon Nock-ten struck the island on October 25. 
The fast-moving storm spent most of a day working its way up 
Taiwan\'s eastern coast to the capital Taipei, disrupting 
road and air traffic.  Hardest hit was the northeast, where 
Keelung harbor was temporarily closed and many flights in 
and out of Taipei were canceled.  Schools and offices in 
Taipei and some eastern cities were closed.  Financial 
markets were also shut down for one day.  Sandbags were 
piled at the entrances to Taipei\'s subway system to prevent 
flooding.  However, as the Typhoon moved swiftly over the 
island its influence quickly dissipated.  Although the 
powerful winds flipped over a truck on the highway, 
officials said that precipitation was much less than 
predicted. 
 
3. The Taiwan government\'s Flood Disaster Relief Center 
announced on October 26 that Typhoon Nock-ten had resulted 
in a total of four deaths, one missing and 100 injuries. 
Among the four deaths, three people were killed in flash 
floods, including a TV reporter and a rescue worker who were 
swept away by raging waters.  Typhoon Nock-ten was the 24th 
typhoon reported in the Pacific Ocean this year.  Taiwan\'s 
death toll this year so far due to Typhoons stands at 53 
people.  An additional, 30 people are still listed missing. 
Nock-ten formed particularly late in the season.  Taiwan\'s 
Central Weather Bureau officials said that the last typhoon 
to strike Taiwan this late in the year occurred in 1959. 
 
Power and Water Disruption 
-------------------------- 
 
4. On October 25, about 380,000 households in Taiwan lost 
electricity, but power was quickly restored to most.  By the 
evening of October 26, only 28,000 households were still 
without power.  The state-owned Taiwan Power Company 
indicated that all service should be restored by October 27. 
High turbidity levels disrupted water supplies after the 
last two typhoons.  However, the Water Resources Agency 
stated that this storm did not affect reservoirs.  Water 
turbidity levels are within the acceptable range, and water 
supplies are operating normally. 
 
Agricultural and Economic Impact 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. The Council of Agriculture estimated on October 26 that 
the total damage to the agricultural sectors was NTD 295.9 
million (about USD 8.75 million), but those figures may be 
revised upwards.  Rice, leafy vegetables and various 
seasonal fruits were the hardest hit.  Despite the losses, 
agricultural officials said most supplies should not be 
affected since the fast-moving storm missed the central and 
southern parts of Taiwan where the majority of the island\'s 
vegetables are grown.  Because electricity and water 
supplies were not badly disrupted, industrial losses were 
minimal.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: SECRETARY POWELL\'S BEIJING 
TRIP AND U.S. POLICY 
 
 
A) \"[Taiwan Must] Calmly Face the Reality Before It 
Hits the Road Again\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
editorialized (10/28): 
 
\". For Washington, it is in the overall interests of 
the United States to keep Taiwan in a position that can 
restrain China, create bargaining chips for U.S.-China 
negotiations and at the same time not really trigger a 
war in the Taiwan Strait.  Washington does not want 
Taiwan to stand in its way in areas where it wants to 
develop relations with China - such as trade markets. 
But it needs Taiwan to block Beijing when it comes to 
areas where it wants to overpower China - such as 
[China\'s] military hegemonic power.  Taiwan\'s position 
or value lies in playing the part of accommodating 
[party in] the United States\' great strategy toward 
China.  Whenever there is a major conflict between the 
United States and China, the unprotected Taiwan can get 
support from the United States, but the room for Taiwan 
will be squeezed when conflicts between the United 
States and China are reduced or when they share the 
same interests.  Thus, chances are higher that 
[Secretary of State Colin] misspoke regarding `peaceful 
unification\' because Washington has no need to reduce 
the room in which it moves around in with its policy 
and `peaceful resolution\' would provide more bargaining 
chips for the United States. 
 
\"Even so, Powell still did deal a heavy blow [to 
Taiwan].  Recently, Washington has repeatedly warned 
and stated that it does not support Taiwan 
independence.  Powell\'s remarks months ago which said 
that a resolution to the issue must be accepted by both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait was a new approach to 
further illustrate that [the United States] does not 
support Taiwan independence, which has also become one 
of the keynotes of U.S. policy. . 
 
\". After the DPP came into power, it strived to rebuild 
foreign and cross-Strait policies that are politically 
correct and closely related to Taiwan\'s national 
identity. .  Also, some high-ranking Taiwan officials 
have tried to use the island\'s foreign relations as a 
campaign tool and turned the United States\' goodwill 
and support into their personal campaign resources.  A 
series of rash behavior, remarks and provocative acts 
by Taipei, including the referendum, have not only 
undermined the long-standing trust between Taiwan and 
the United States but have also turned Taiwan into a 
variable that threatens U.S. interests. 
 
\"The United States will not be afraid to take 
`preventive\' action in the face of any threat that 
could endanger its national interests.  The support 
that Washington gives Taipei is not so great as to the 
extent that it would sacrifice its soldiers for Taiwan. 
If Taiwan works and waits patiently, maybe it could 
create a new status for itself in the international 
community.  But Taiwan made an early move to challenge 
the United States\' one-China policy before the 
international climate matures, so it got slapped in the 
face by the United States. . 
 
\"The United States has repeatedly urged both sides of 
the Taiwan Strait to resume dialogue.  It would be more 
appropriate to say that Washington\'s purpose is to 
reduce cross-Strait tension rather than just push for 
talks across the Taiwan Strait.  The mistrust of the 
United States, the saber rattling of China and the 
indifference of the international community are the 
reality that Taiwan must face calmly and bravely.  .\" 
 
B) \"The Real Connotation of Washington\'s One China 
Policy\" 
 
Shao Chung-hai, a professor at National Chengchi 
University\'s Sun Yat-sen Institute, said in an op-ed 
piece in the centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
(10/28): 
 
\"If this [i.e. what Secretary Powell said and what 
State Department Spokesman Ereli later clarified] is 
the U.S. government\'s long-standing policy toward 
Taiwan\'s status, Powell\'s remarks have clearly 
indicated the real connotation of Washington\'s one- 
China policy - namely, the meaning of `one China\' 
remains ambiguous, but [Washington\'s position] toward 
Taiwan\'s status is moving toward clarity. . 
 
\"Taipei was shocked [by Powell\'s remarks] partly 
because Washington did not mention in its earlier 
briefing to Taipei that Powell would speak in such a 
direct and candid manner.  It is also because Taipei 
had overlooked Powell\'s trip, thinking that he would 
soon leave his current position and he would not talk 
about any substantive issues when he visited Beijing. 
But what is more important is that Taipei, for a long 
time, has been trying to interpret the direction of 
Washington\'s Taiwan policy from its own position, 
arbitrarily judging that Washington\'s attempt to create 
ambiguity for its cross-Strait policy in the past was 
[meant] to create a background for Taiwan to split from 
mainland China.  The DPP government . especially 
misinterpreted the United States\' position that neither 
side of the Taiwan Strait should unilaterally change 
the status quo as silent recognition the `fact\' of an 
independent Taiwan. .\" 
 
C) \"Taiwan Independence Is a Mere Illusion\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" said in an editorial (10/28): 
 
\". Powell\'s comment departed from the usual U.S. 
practice of calling on both sides to settle their 
differences peacefully via dialogue and of avoiding 
taking any stance on what the resolution should be. . 
 
\"Two factors contributed to the apparent shift in U.S. 
policy.  For one thing, the U.S. needs the help of 
Beijing in implementing its anti-terrorist mission, 
especially in dealing with North Korea, which President 
George W. Bush once described as the `Axis of Evil\' 
along with Iran and Iraq. 
 
\"Another factor is the DPP government and its allies\' 
aggressive push for independence.  Apparently, the U.S. 
government believes Taiwan\'s movement toward statehood 
has made the Taiwan Strait more treacherous than ever 
before. 
 
\"The independence activists\' attempt to separate Taiwan 
from the mainland permanently has produced just the 
opposite effect.  Their pursuit, ironically, is making 
the outlook for Chinese reunification brighter.\" 
 
D) \"Powell Should Not Withhold Reorganization of the 
Fact that `Taiwan Is an Independent Sovereign State\'\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" commented in an 
editorial (10/28): 
 
\". When we looked back at the contents of the United 
States\' cross-Strait policy, they all focused on 
`peaceful dialogue,\' `respect for the will of the 
Taiwan people,\' and `maintaining the status quo.\' 
Judged from these contents, [we know that] even Powell 
misspoke, the focus of his meeting with the Chinese 
leaders still centered on `urging both sides to resume 
dialogue\' `opposition to any unilateral attempt the 
change the status quo,\' and `firm commitment to arms 
sales to Taiwan.\'  Just as noted in the clarifications 
by the State Department and AIT, the United States\' 
Taiwan policy remains unchanged.  However, even though 
Powell\'s inappropriate remarks were a slip of the 
tongue, which were later clarified by U.S. officials, 
Powell\'s remarks have undeniably deviated from the 
historical reality and seriously harmed Taiwan\'s 
interests as well as the feelings of the 23 million 
Taiwan people.  As a result, Taiwan people must ask the 
United States to make a powerful clarification and 
commitment, and Powell must also apologize to the 
Taiwan people in public. .\" 
 
E) \"Powell\'s Misspeaking Alerts Taiwan People to 
Quickly Become a `Normal Country\' through the Process 
of Instituting a New Constitution\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Taiwan Daily\" said in an 
editorial (10/28): 
 
\". But in our eyes, Powell\'s statements that `Taiwan is 
not independent\" and `does not enjoy sovereignty as a 
nation\' have actually underscored the necessity and 
urgency for Taiwan to become a `normal country\' through 
the process of public self-determination to rectify 
Taiwan\'s name and institute a new constitution. .\" 
 
F) \"K.M. Koo: I Do Not Believe That `Peaceful 
Unification\' Is the U.S. Policy\' 
 
Senior Presidential Advisor K.M. Koo said in an 
exclusive interview with the pro-independence \"Liberty 
Times\" presented as a commentary (10/28): 
 
\"Senior Presidential Advisor K.M. Koo said in an 
exclusive interview with this newspaper that the reason 
why both sides of the Taiwan Strait have failed to 
resume a dialogue is because China has done a good job 
in pressuring Taiwan through the United States.  China 
will not sit down to talk with Taiwan as long as the 
United States continues implementing its one-China 
policy.  China\'s turning down [the offers] as proposed 
by both President Chen and Secretary Powell are the 
best examples.  Unless the United States gives up the 
role to speak for China, chances will be slim for both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume talks. . 
 
\". Koo said Powell did seem `very calm and composed\' 
when he talked about `peaceful unification.\'  But 
Taiwan\'s strategic importance in Asia will not be 
affected by the remarks of a government, a certain 
political party, or a secretary of state.  It will be a 
very dangerous idea if `unification\' is what Powell has 
in mind. 
 
\"According to Koo, `unification\' would mean giving up 
on Taiwan, an idea which is by no means in the United 
States\' interests.  Also, if Taiwan becomes part of 
China, it will have a great impact on the peace in 
Asia, which was established in the wake of the Second 
World War.  China\'s basic idea is to drive the U.S. 
influence out of Asia and establish its leading role in 
the region.  But this will certainly trigger resistance 
from both Japan and Korea.  As a result, Koo said he 
will never believe that `peaceful unification\' will 
become the U.S. policy. .\" 
 
G) \"The Wake-up Call in Powell\'s Words\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taiwan News\" 
editorialized (10/28): 
 
\". Naturally, the most likely possibility is precisely 
that Powell, who is evidently not very familiar with 
the intricacies of Taiwan\'s `China problem\' or China\'s 
`Taiwan problem,\' did indeed make verbal errors without 
prior malice or forethought. . 
 
\"While we can welcome the clarifications, we should not 
neglect preparations for alternatives. 
 
\"For example, there remains a possibility that Powell 
and the U.S. State Department or even President George 
W. Bush are playing a \'bad cop, good cop\' routine with 
both Taipei and Beijing. 
 
\"While the goal of the U.S. secretary of state may be 
to maintain stability, his initiative may bred even 
more tension. 
 
\"Indeed, Powell\'s strident defense of `our one-China 
policy,\' a posture which is quite distinct from 
Beijing\'s `one-China principle,\' cannot hide the fact 
that its foundations have been gravely eroded by 
Taiwan\'s democratization and emergence as a \'subject\' 
in the triangular relationship and by the PRC\'s own 
economic and military rise. 
 
\"Unfortunately, instead of compelling Beijing to accept 
the fact of Taiwan\'s actual-existing sovereignty, the 
U.S. secretary of state\'s clumsy intervention has set 
back progress by fostering both anger in Taiwan and 
unrealistic expectations in Beijing that any government 
in Washington may be able to make the problem of facing 
up to the reality of Taiwan\'s `people-based 
sovereignty\' wither away. . 
 
\"In a sense, Powell may have done Taiwan a backhanded 
favor by reminding us of the need to cultivate a far 
broader base of support in global public support to 
buttress the genuine `enjoyment\' of sovereignty by 
Taiwan\'s people and thus ease our security dependence 
on the United States. . 
 
\"Truly, the best way to help ourselves is to help 
others help themselves.  In order to lay the 
foundations for its own sustainability and lasting 
autonomy, a democratic Taiwan should boldly take up the 
unaccustomed role of acting as an agenda-setter instead 
of passive follower in the global arena in party by 
laying the foundations for our own sustainability as 
President Chen hinted in his May 20 inaugural speech.\"

TRIP AND U.S. POLICY 
 
 
A) \"The Supporter [Who Was] Behind [Us] Unexpectedly Is 
the First to Hit [Us]\" 
 
Journalist Liu Pao-chieh said in the conservative, pro- 
unification \"United Daily News:\" (10/29): 
 
\"U.S. Secretary Powell said Thursday a `peaceful 
resolution\' is [the basis of] Washington\'s cross-Strait 
policy, but so far he has not yet changed his denial of 
Taiwan\'s sovereign status, and this is what deserves 
more attention.  This development should prompt the DPP 
government to reconsider its cross-Strait policy that 
emphasizes relying wholly on the United States [to 
counter China]. . 
 
\"When considering Taiwan\'s relations with the United 
States and Japan, the DPP always assumes that the two 
countries would not want to see Taiwan fall into the 
hands of China.  The reason that Washington wants both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume a dialogue, 
according to the DPP, lies in the hope of stabilizing 
cross-Strait relations, and the DPP believes that 
Washington will not be happy to see both sides move 
toward unification.  In the DPP\'s eyes, what the United 
States has been doing is just the manipulation of a two- 
handed strategy. . 
 
\"Thus, even while a superpower like the United States 
is seeking rapprochement with China, Taiwan continues 
to go the opposite way.  Many political figures [in 
Taiwan] have expressed strong hostility toward China 
and thought they had U.S. support behind them.  They 
have failed to realize that, in fact, the United States 
has changed its position [over the past four years]. 
 
\"[Senior Presidential Advisor] K.M. Koo placed 
advertisements in U.S. newspapers but got slashed by 
the United States.  Those pro-independence people 
originally planned to rely on the United States as a 
strong backing for fighting against China, but they did 
not expect that the first one to hit [against Taiwan] 
is the United States.  This is political reality.\" 
 
B) \"[Should Taiwan] Apply to Become One of the States 
of the United States?\" 
 
The \"News Watch\" column of the pro-independence \"Taiwan 
Daily\" said (10/29): 
 
\"When [Secretary] Powell said Taiwan is not an 
independent sovereign state, some politicians in Taiwan 
got very angry and they protested.  Of course, some 
other politicians were as happy inside their hearts as 
if they had seen the `end of Taiwan independence.\'  But 
are things really that bad? 
 
\"Have the Americans ever looked at Taiwan as an 
independent sovereign state?  If we reflect on the 
annual talks between Taiwan and the United States over 
intellectual property rights, we see that Taiwan was 
forced to give up its administrative, legislative, even 
judicial rights.  When did the Americans ever treat 
Taiwan as an independent sovereign state? . 
 
\". In some Americans\' eyes, Taiwan is of course not an 
`independent sovereign\' state, otherwise how could the 
Taiwan Relations Act be a domestic law of the United 
States?  See, the U.S. military needs to protect 
Taiwan!  Some people in Taiwan launched a movement 
intending to apply to become one of the states of the 
United States.  It seemed more like an act of kissing 
the ass of the Americans.  But just look at the United 
States\' influence on Taiwan: even if Taiwan is not a 
state of the United States, it should at least be a 
special administrative region of the United States, 
like the status of Puerto Rico. .\" 
 
C) \"Powell\'s Storm and Taiwan\'s Situation\" 
 
The Sun Ching-yu column said in the pro-independence 
\"Taiwan Daily\" (10/29): 
 
\"Secretary Powell remarks could be viewed as a warning 
signal for the Chen Shui-bian administration.  Despite 
the fact that Chen managed to stick to his bottom line 
in his May 20 inaugural speech and National Day speech, 
his administration still had to pay the price for 
Chen\'s challenge of Washington\'s `one China\' policy. 
The pro-independence camp believes that Taiwan should 
push all the more for the rectification of Taiwan\'s 
name because the international community does not 
recognize the Republic of China (ROC).  But they have 
never really paid attention to the fact that Powell was 
not denying the sovereignty of the ROC but the 
`independence\' and `sovereignty\' of Taiwan.  Before 
last year, the Bush administration had many times 
addressed Taiwan as the `Republic of China.\' 
 
\"Whether this new change in the United States\' Taiwan 
policy will turn from `words\' into `action\' is the 
touchstone to see if Taiwan will really split from the

Liu Kuan-teh, a political commentator based in Taipei, 
said in an op-ed of the pro-independence, English- 
language \"Taipei Times\" (10/29): 
 
\". It is true that there have been ups and owns in 
relations between Washington and Taipei in the past 10 
months.  As Taiwan\'s leaders keep emphasizing Taiwan\'s 
independence sovereignty, Beijing has doubled its 
pressure on Washington. 
 
\"It is natural for the Bush administration to make an 
extra effort to maintain a friendly atmosphere with its 
Chinese counterpart before the general election. 
Nevertheless, appeasing China should not be conducted 
at the expense of Taipei\'s pursuit of dialogue and 
normalization with Beijing. 
 
\"Perhaps this was an unfortunate break in the momentum 
to press Beijing to be flexible on the resumption of 
cross-Strait dialogue.\"

SUBJECT: A FRIGHTENING PROSPECT: PRC INFANTS ADOPTED 
FROM TAIWAN 
 
REF: BALLIF-BROWN UNCLASS E-MAIL 22 OCT 04 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On 23 October, AIT Taipei received the 
referenced e-mail regarding the possibility of the Frank 
Foundation, a US-based international adoption 
organization facilitating the adoption of the infant 
children of illegal PRC mothers currently in immigration 
detention in Taiwan. Based on visits by an AIT officer 
to this detention facility and information obtained from 
local NGOs, it appears that the current situation and 
the future faced by both the mothers and infants in 
detention is considerably more positive than described 
by the Foundation. AIT is strongly opposed to the 
adoption of these infants in Taiwan, for administrative, 
legal, and humanitarian reasons.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) On 23 October, AIT received the referenced e- 
mail concerning the situation of PRC mothers and infants 
being held in immigration detention centers in Taiwan 
and the possibility of assisting private U.S. groups in 
the placement (i.e. adoption) of the children.  This 
possibility was raised by the Frank Foundation, an 
international adoption advocacy organization.  The 
Foundation\'s website includes a section dedicated to the 
mothers and children in a Taiwan detention center, where 
it claimed that the female inmates were prostitutes who 
were \"broken physically, psychologically, and 
spiritually,\" that their babies were unwanted, and 
advocated the \"rescue\" (i.e. adoption) of these infants 
to save them from a \"terrifying and tragic\" fate, 
suggesting that many of the women might kill their 
children upon their return to China. 
 
3.  (SBU) As part of the research for last year\'s 
Trafficking in Persons report, an AIT officer visited 
the immigration detention center in Hsin Chu, in all 
probability the specific center referred to on the Frank 
Foundation website, and conducted private, unmonitored 
interviews with some of the female detainees.  The 
officer found that the conditions at the Hsin Chu 
facility were neat and clean, the inmates described 
their treatment as fair, there was no sign of widespread 
psychological trauma among the detainees, and the 
Taiwanese authorities were going out of their way to 
make sure the women with infants are particularly well 
cared for. This conclusion corresponds with reports from 
local NGOs and other foreign representative offices that 
have visited the detention center as well. 
 
4. (SBU) While it is certain that some of the female 
detainees practiced prostitution prior to their 
detention by the Taiwan authorities, it is not at all 
clear that even a majority were engaged in prostitution 
or any aspect of the sex industry.  There are no 
statistics available and none of the detainees admitted 
to working in the sex trade.  However, based on 
information from a variety of sources, we know that most 
PRC illegals in Taiwan work in industries other than sex 
and prostitution, including working as cooks, 
dishwashers, janitors, manual laborers, domestic 
helpers, etc. 
 
5. (SBU) The Taiwan authorities have the right to detain 
PRC nationals found working in Taiwan as illegal aliens 
pending their return to the PRC, but they have sought to 
return these aliens to their place of origin as quickly 
as possible.  However, the PRC government\'s reluctance 
to accept their nationals back en masse has resulted in 
a long and slow repatriation process. For example, from 
January through March 2004 five groups of illegal PRC 
nationals were repatriated. According to Taiwan\'s Bureau 
of Immigration, repatriations stopped from March to 
August, and since August 424 PRC nationals have been 
repatriated, including 232 females and 19 infants. 
According to Chang Hsu-ti from the Taiwan Mainland 
Affairs Council, as of 28 October there were 2197 female 
and 406 male PRC nationals, including 12 children, 
remaining in detention centers in Taiwan. It should be 
noted that children born in Taiwan to PRC national 
mothers have no right of abode in Taiwan because, by 
law, birth in Taiwan does not confer automatic 
citizenship. Additionally, the Taiwan authorities will 
not issue these children travel documents. 
6. (SBU) The possibility that U.S. families might wish 
to adopt these children from Taiwan also raises serious 
U.S. immigration, consular and fraud issues. Attempting 
to verify the bonafides of a PRC orphan in Taiwan, when 
AIT has no access to PRC government offices or documents 
and has no means to fact-check, would make the approval 
of an I-600 petition and orphan investigation nearly 
impossible.  There is also the possibility that children 
would be smuggled from the PRC to Taiwan to take 
advantage of the situation, were we begin processing 
these adoptions.  For the protection of these children 
and to maintain the integrity of the 
adoption/immigration process, any adoptions of PRC 
children should continue to be handled by the U.S. 
Consulate in Guangzhou, not at AIT Taipei. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: There is no evidence to support the 
allegations made by the Frank Foundation concerning the 
hardships faced by PRC detainees in Taiwan or the fate 
of their children.  Suggesting that PRC mothers, many of 
whom are not well-educated, give their children up for 
adoption while still detained in Taiwan would set a 
dangerous precedent fraught with legal, humanitarian and 
fraud concerns. Any intervention or pressure by the USG 
or AIT, real or perceived, even with the best of 
intentions, risks further complicating what is already a 
very sensitive issue.

SUBJECT: CROSS-STRAIT SHIPPING - INEXPENSIVE, NOT 
INSIGNIFICANT 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Economic Section Chief Daniel K. Moore, Reason 1.4 ( 
B/D) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U) Businesses on both sides of the Taiwan Strait look 
forward to the possibility of direct marine cargo links 
between the Mainland and Taiwan.  However, they have also 
been very resourceful at taking advantage of small openings 
and the flexibility of Taiwan, PRC and other authorities to 
ship goods inexpensively through different routes across the 
Strait.  As a result, the additional expense imposed by the 
lack of direct links on sea freight is very small.  As one 
observer put it, Taiwan and the PRC already have virtual 
direct shipping links; they,re only indirect on paper. 
Establishing direct shipping links will have a positive 
impact on Taiwan,s economy.  Initially the impact will be 
small, but the importance of direct shipping will grow in the 
long run.  Taiwan,s experience with various methods of 
indirect shipping provides a good base for making progress on 
direct marine links and improved cross-Strait relations. 
(End Summary) 
 
Gradual Liberalization Stills Falls Short 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) The restrictions on cross-Strait shipping are neither 
absolute nor static.  Over the past 10 years, several 
openings have been made to ease cross-Strait transportation 
while maintaining the basic prohibition against direct 
shipping.  Two significant openings stand out: in 1995 Taiwan 
approved cross-Strait offshore transshipment through 
Kaohsiung Harbor, which was further expanded in 2004 to 
Keelung and Taichung Harbors.  The second big opening 
occurred in 2000 when the mini-links from Kinmen and Matsu, 
controlled by Taiwan, to the Mainland ports of Xiamen and 
Fuzhou were opened.  These and other gradual changes have 
substantially liberalized cross-Strait transportation and 
paved the way for direct shipping links.  However, the 
current situation still imposes some small costs and 
inconveniences. 
 
Various Routes Across the Strait 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Several options currently exist for moving goods by 
sea across the Taiwan Strait.  All are subject to 
restrictions, but shipping companies and their customers have 
found means to minimize the cost imposed by these 
restrictions.  According to industry experts, it is difficult 
to gauge and compare the volume of cargo shipped through the 
various routes because they are measured by different 
organizations using different standards )- if measured at 
all.  These methods can be grouped into three main categories. 
 
--International Shipping Link - Any ship can travel between 
the PRC and Taiwan with an intermediate stop in a third 
location.  This method of shipping makes up the bulk of 
cross-Strait shipping and virtually all Taiwan-PRC trade that 
is shipped by sea.  Dai Heui-huang, professor at National 
Kaohsiung Marine University, told AIT that the volume of 
cargo that is shipped across the Strait is very difficult to 
estimate.  However, he indicated that at least 1 million TEU 
of cargo is shipped this way.  The most common stopping 
points are Hong Kong and Ishigaki Island, Japan.  Ships are 
required to show documentation from the stopover port upon 
arrival.  Some contacts report that many ships, possibly 
most, do not physically stop in a third port, but instead 
obtain their paperwork through other channels.  For example, 
Japanese customs officials will reportedly meet ships at sea 
without requiring the vessel to actually dock at a Japanese 
port.  One contact indicated that the necessary Hong Kong 
documentation could be obtained for as little as USD 200 
without a physical stop in the port. 
 
--Offshore Transshipment Link ) Ships flying flags other 
than ROC or the PRC, including ships owned by Taiwan and PRC 
shipping firms, travel directly to and from PRC ports on 
routes that include a third destination.  However, they 
cannot ship cargo directly.  No PRC-origin cargo can clear 
customs in Taiwan and no Taiwan-origin cargo can clear 
customs in the PRC, unless the ship has passed through 
another port in between.  For example, a ship in Taiwan could 
take on cargo bound for the U.S., travel to the PRC, take on 
more cargo, and then return to the U.S.  This route cannot be 
used for cross-Strait trade, so the main beneficiaries in 
Taiwan are shipping companies.  Keelung and Taichung were 
only approved as offshore transshipment centers this year. 
In 2003, a total of 630,336 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU 
) a unit of cargo volume equal to one twenty-foot container) 
was loaded or unloaded at Kaohsiung Harbor.  However, 
Professor Dai estimates that 70 to 80 percent of the total 
volume is comprised of empty containers enroute to the PRC to 
be filled with exports. 
 
--Mini Three Links ) Taiwan and Mainland Chinese vessels 
flying ROC and PRC flags are able to travel directly between 
Taiwan-controlled Kinmen and Matsu and the Mainland ports of 
Xiamen and Fuzhou.  They carry both passengers and cargo. 
However, cargo is limited to goods produced locally or for 
local consumption on the small Taiwan-controlled islands just 
off the Mainland coast.  As a result, mini-three-links cargo 
makes up only a tiny fraction of goods shipped across the 
Strait. 
 
Cheap for Now 
------------- 
 
4.  (U) Despite regulations and the complications of 
cross-Strait shipping, industry experts estimate that current 
costs are not substantially higher than direct shipping costs 
would be; delays are generally short as well.  For example, 
Bob Hsu, Secretary General of the National Association of 
Chinese Ship Owners (NACS), estimates that the fare for 
shipping one TEU from Kaohsiung to Tienjin via Japan,s 
Ishigaki Island is approximately USD 480.  Direct sea cargo 
links would reduce the price only to USD 475.  The Japan stop 
(or sail-by) only adds about one day to the total shipping 
time.  Hsu estimates that there would be no cost savings 
whatsoever on the shorter Kaohsiung-Shanghai route.  A stop 
in Hong Kong en route to Guangzhou only adds about two 
dollars to the cost of shipping each TEU and increases 
shipping time by less than one day.  Greater savings would be 
found on Kaohsiung-Fuzhou and Kaohsiung-Xiamen routes where 
direct shipping would cut costs by approximately 7 percent. 
The time saved on these routes would be more substantial, 
cutting a three to four day trip down to one day. 
 
Impact of Direct Shipping ) Stronger in the Long Run 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5.  (C) Direct marine cargo links would leave their strongest 
impact on the shipping industry itself.  However, much of the 
impact would come from increased access to the Chinese market 
for Taiwan shipping firms rather than the reduced costs. 
NACS Secretary General Hsu tells AIT/T that Taiwan shipping 
firms expect that negotiations on direct shipping links would 
also result in an agreement that would permit greater access 
to the Mainland market, particularly the authority to set up 
branch offices in China.  Currently, the PRC will only 
approve representative offices, which are permitted to engage 
in promotional activities.  Branch offices would also be 
allowed to engage in sales and issuance of bills of lading. 
Taiwan,s major shipping companies generate about 50 to 60 
percent of their revenue from the greater China market. 
Evergreen and Yangming shipping companies report that 1.5 
percent of their revenue from business in the China market 
goes to commissions paid to Mainland brokers.  Branch offices 
in China would cut their expenses significantly and help them 
increase opportunities in China. 
 
7.  (C) In the short term, the real economic impact of direct 
cross-Strait shipping on Taiwan,s overall economy would be 
much smaller.  The cost savings from direct shipping would be 
an almost negligible fraction of an already inexpensive 
transportation option.  Saved shipping time would also be 
small for most routes.  Chinese National Federation of 
Industries Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Horng-ming told us 
that in shipping Taiwan and the PRC already have virtual 
direct links; they,re only indirect on paper.  (In contrast, 
the savings offered by direct air cargo links would be much 
more substantial and immediate.  We will report on the 
potential impact of direct air links via septel.) 
 
8.  (U) However, over time, these small cost and time savings 
will grow in relative importance.  As PRC ports expand and 
improve their services, Taiwan ports will be less competitive 
without direct links.  With the continued expansion of 
cross-Strait trade, the total cost imposed by indirect links 
will grow.  As Mainland industrial technology advances, 
Taiwan,s manufacturing industries will need to work harder 
and further cut costs to maintain competitiveness.  Small 
variations in shipping expenses will grow in significance. 
 
Comment ) An Opening for the Cross-Strait Relationship 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
9.  (U) Although the economic benefits of cross-Strait direct 
shipping are relatively small in the short run, direct 
shipping should still be a priority for the Chen 
administration.  In addition, to growing importance in the 
long run, cross-Strait direct shipping could provide a 
valuable opportunity to improve cross-Strait relations. 
Because of Taiwan,s experience with the mini links and 
offshore transshipment, establishing direct marine cargo 
links may present fewer problems than direct air links. 
Establishing direct shipping links would send a very positive 
message about the state of cross-Strait relations.  The 
implications for future regional stability and further 
normalization of economic relations would increase confidence 
and improve the investment environment in Taiwan.

1. (C) Summary: Chen administration officials are working to 
limit media and political fallout from a set of interviews 
given by Secretary Powell in Beijing on October 24. 
President Chen Shui-bian expressed appreciation to the AIT 
Director on October 28 for a series of public statements by 
the Secretary and other Department officials clarifying that 
U.S. policy has not changed.  Nevertheless, the media and 
political parties continue to utilize the episode to advance 
a variety of domestic political agendas.  The Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU) has focused on the Secretary\'s remarks 
in an attempt to resuscitate their flagging Legislative Yuan 
(LY) campaign while the opposition Pan-Blue has used the 
episode to justify opposition to the USD 18 billion special 
defense procurement budget.  Former President Lee Teng-hui 
has played both sides of the public debate, asserting on the 
one hand that the Secretary\'s remarks were blown out of 
proportion by an ignorant Taiwan media but also asserting 
that the comments should remind Taiwan\'s people of the need 
to become a \"normal country.\"  Some Democratic Progressive 
Party (DPP) officials warn that the episode could have longer 
term policy consequences, including over the fate of the 
special defense budget.  Other observers, however, suggest 
that the incident will help remind leaders in Taipei that 
Taiwan does not exist in a vacuum.  End Summary. 
 
Switch to Moderation 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) Chen administration officials are sending out 
reassuring messages to the media in an effort to stem the 
public relations furor that they themselves fanned after 
Secretary Powell\'s comments on Taiwan\'s status during two 
 
SIPDIS 
October 24 interviews in Beijing (Ref A).  President Chen 
Shui-bian told the Director October 27 that he appreciated 
the Secretary\'s subsequent clarification and the State 
Department\'s reassurances that U.S. policy had not changed. 
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary General James Huang told 
reporters the same day that the Powell CNBC interview and 
statement by EAP DAS Schriver to TECRO Washington Rep. David 
Lee that the USG still respects the 1982 U.S.-Taiwan \"Six 
Assurances\" were \"helpful and positive.\"  Unnamed 
presidential aides told the Taiwan media that the leadership 
\"breathed a sigh of relief\" following Washington\'s 
clarifications that the Secretary did not intend to signal a 
new policy change.  Soon thereafter, signs emerged of efforts 
to stop the damage and take credit for effective \"crisis 
management\" by the Chen administration. 
 
3. (C) The initial response in Taipei to the Secretary\'s 
interviews was shock, combined with fear that the USG had 
decided on a major policy reorientation without Taipei\'s 
knowledge.  Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu 
told AIT that Taipei\'s biggest concern was that the 
Secretary\'s statements on reunification and non-sovereign 
 
SIPDIS 
status would become regular policy formulations. 
Presidential Office Secretary Liu Shih-chung said Taipei was 
also surprised over the timing of the statements, noting that 
Taipei has been trying for months to repair relations with 
both Beijing and Washington.  Green-leaning Academia Sinica 
political analyst Hsu Yung-ming asserted that \"what the DPP 
feared most was that there was some major U.S. policy 
decision made and they had totally missed signs of its 
formulation.\" 
 
4. (C) The Chen administration\'s current attempts to play up 
the strength of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship stand in 
contrast to the initial barbed public response to the 
Secretary\'s references to Taiwan\'s lack of sovereignty (Ref 
 
SIPDIS 
B).  President Chen used public meetings with visiting 
foreign delegations on October 25-27 to emphasize Taiwan\'s 
sovereign and independent status and complain that it is 
\"unfair\" that many countries do not recognize this \"fact.\" 
Premier Yu Shyi-kun and Foreign Minister Mark Chen offered 
similar comments during Legislative Yuan (LY) interpolations. 
 Yu went further than other officials on October 28 when he 
used the \"one country on each side\" formulation initially 
coined by Chen Shui-bian in 2002 to describe relations 
between Taiwan and the Mainland.  No senior official has used 
the phrase since the March 20 election. 
5. (C) The decision to take a combative public line was 
clearly made at the top.  Officials like MAC\'s Wu and 
Presidential Office Deputy SecGen Huang told AIT immediately 
after the Secretary\'s interview was reported in Taipei that 
they would counsel a quiet, low-key response.  MOFA North 
American Affairs Director General Victor Chin told the Deputy 
Director that the decision to tone down rhetoric was also 
made at the top.  Chin said that Chen discarded plans to make 
barbed comments at an Asia Foundation dinner on October 28 
after learning about Secretary Powell\'s interview with CNBC. 
However, just as Yu appeared to play domestic politics with 
\"one country on each side,\" officials like Huang and Wu 
consistently used restrained language with the media 
throughout the week to signal to us that Taipei\'s commitments 
to improved relations with Washington and Beijing remain 
strong. 
 
Political Reaction Polarized 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (C) DPP officials expressed somewhat contradictory 
concerns over the political ramifications of the controversy. 
 DPP Secretary General Chang Chun-hsiung told AIT that the 
government feared that the Secretary\'s interview may signal 
to the public that the USG was pushing Taiwan towards 
unification.  \"Many centrists in Taiwan might come to the 
conclusion that even the United States wants Taiwan to be 
unified with China,\" he stated, \"so they may decide to simply 
give up hope.\"  That, he suggested, might also reduce support 
for the special defense budget.  However, Chang\'s deputy, 
Chung Chia-bing, and officials at the Presidential Office and 
MAC expressed the exact opposite concern, warning that the 
Secretary\'s sovereignty language would strengthen the hand of 
 
SIPDIS 
pro-independence fundamentalists.  Chung noted that the TSU 
decided after the Powell interview to reschedule a \"name 
rectification\" rally on December 5 that had been originally 
canceled under pressure from the DPP, which is planning a 
rally on December 4 that will feature a more moderate 
nationalist agenda (Ref C).  Academia Sinica\'s Hsu asserted 
that the Secretary\'s comments on Taiwan sovereignty breathed 
new life into the TSU\'s floundering electoral campaign.  Hsu 
warned that the TSU may follow-up on the episode by proposing 
a referendum on whether or not \"Taiwan is a sovereign, 
independent country\" in conjunction with the December 11 LY 
election, a move Hsu said would put the DPP in an awkward 
position. 
 
7. (C) Opposition leaders seized on the Beijing interviews to 
lash out at the DPP\'s mismanagement of relations with 
Washington, burnish their own nationalist credentials, and 
justify their recent opposition to action on the USD 18 
billion special procurement budget for U.S. defense articles. 
 Pan-Blue legislators placed a hold on the special budget 
bill in the LY pending a \"satisfactory U.S. explanation for 
the Secretary\'s remarks,\" provoking a food fight with ruling 
party counterparts at a lunch-time committee meeting.  LY 
President Wang Jin-pyng told reporters on October 28 that the 
controversy had negatively impacted on the atmospherics for 
the special budget debate but said that this did not excuse 
Pan-Blue parties from fulfilling their commitment to start 
deliberations on the authorization portion of the bill before 
the November 11 recess.  However, DPP LY Defense Committee 
Convener Lee Wen-chung told AIT that the latest confrontation 
will make it virtually impossible for any serious 
deliberations on the special budget until after the December 
11 election.  Lee added that the controversy over the 
Secretary\'s interview would likely not be a factor in the 
 
SIPDIS 
special budget\'s prospects after December 11. 
 
Lee Teng-hui Plays Both Sides 
----------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Former President Lee Teng-hui offered sharply 
divergent responses to the Secretary\'s interview, perhaps 
reflecting conflicting pressure from the TSU and his more 
realist advisors (Septel).  Lee\'s first reaction was to scold 
the Taiwan media for blowing the incident out of proportion, 
asserting that the Secretary\'s formulation on Taiwan\'s 
sovereignty was simply a recitation of the USG\'s 
long-standing position.  However, Lee later characterized 
Powell\'s comments as a reminder of Taiwan\'s current abnormal 
status.  While TSU candidates used the recent media attention 
to boost their campaign efforts, some moderate Lee associates 
also expressed satisfaction over the episode for very 
different reasons.  Lo Fu-chen, Chairman of the 
quasi-official Association of East Asian Relations and a 
long-time Lee confidante, told AIT that the Secretary\'s 
statement will serve as a useful reminder to Chen Shui-bian. 
\"Chen gets too wrapped up in domestic political dynamics and 
forgets that as a leader he also needs to operate at the 
international level,\" Lo stated.  Lo said that he appreciates 
Washington\'s willingness to remain ambiguous about Taiwan\'s 
status, but added that \"sometimes you need to inject some 
clarity to remind Chen about how important ambiguity is in 
the cross-Strait setting.\" 
 
Comment: Lessons Learned? 
------------------------- 
 
9. (C) It is still too early to say conclusively whether the 
Chen administration has learned the lesson that it must be 
more restrained in its public as well as private dealings 
with the United States.  The history of the last few years 
does not encourage optimism.  The Chen administration has 
clearly instructed its officials to send the message that it 
is business as usual.  This is likely aimed, at least in 
part, to prevent the TSU and Pan-Blue from scoring additional 
political points in the ongoing election campaign. 
 
10. (C) If there is a silver lining, it may be that the 
episode has created a renewed appreciation for how much 
influence Washington can wield over Taiwan\'s domestic 
political environment.  DPP SecGen Chang noted that President 
Bush\'s December 9, 2003 statement on Taiwan nearly destroyed 
Chen\'s hopes for re-election and expressed fear that the 
Secretary\'s October 24 remarks might do something similar in 
 
SIPDIS 
the current LY campaign if not handled correctly.  In 
assuring Taiwan officials that U.S. policy has not changed, 
AIT has also used the opportunity to remind them about how 
important ambiguity regarding Taiwan\'s sovereign status is 
for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

2. (C) James Soong confidante Daniel Hwang (Yih-jiau) told 
AIT October 20 that the People First Party (PFP) has overcome 
its crisis of confidence and that the party is heading into 
the final stretch of the LY election with renewed vigor and 
energy.  Hwang admitted that pressure on the party was 
enormous after PFP Legislators Lee Ching-an and Lee Ching-hua 
publicly called for merger with the KMT by October 10.  He 
alleged that the situation was made worse by \"some elements 
of the KMT\" who wanted to marginalize the PFP by portraying 
the party as obstructing Pan-Blue unity.  However, Hwang 
said, PFP members stood firm by their commitment to the 
party, and no open rebellion occurred.  He said October 10 
was the watershed, and when 41 LY candidates registered by 
the October 12 deadline to run under the PFP banner, everyone 
in the PFP knew they had \"braved the storm.\"  Hwang said that 
party Chairman Soong has also finally emerged from the mental 
haze that he has lived in since March 20 and is ready to lead 
the party into the December 11 election. 
 
3. (C) After the KMT\'s failed attempt at a \"hostile takeover\" 
by marginalizing Soong, Hwang told AIT that the PFP came back 
with a proposal to finalize a negotiated merger by the end of 
October.  While the KMT rejected the initiative, Hwang 
pointed out that the KMT has done the math and now realizes 
that even if every one of the 85 KMT and New Party nominees 
got elected, they would still be short of a working majority. 
 Hwang asserted that 31 of the 41 PFP nominees are in safe 
seats, and that with those numbers, the KMT and PFP 
supporters cannot abandon the PFP.  He said that the KMT and 
PFP expect to sign a letter of intent to complete the 
integration by February 2005.  Hwang explained that such a 
letter would give Pan-Blue supporters the impression that 
there is cooperation, stability and unity among the KMT, PFP, 
and New Party.  He admitted that the Pan-Blue does not have a 
LY election campaign chairman, and that each party has its 
own campaign mechanism, but he dismissed campaign 
coordination as unnecessary.  He said, \"our unity is symbolic 
and that is enough,\" adding \"Chinese people are not 
meticulous.\" 
 
Resurrected or Placed on Life-Suport? 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Hwang\'s confidence in his party, however, is not 
shared by many of his colleagues.  Many of James Soong\'s 
other advisors find it difficult to talk to Soong these days, 
saying that Soong prone to burst into fits of rage.  PFP 
Public Affairs Deputy Director Liao Wen-chang told AIT that 
he tries to go through Soong\'s wife whenever he needs to 
report something to Soong.  Former PFP International Affairs 
Director Raymond Wu told AIT that PFP Vice Chairman Chang 
Chau-hsiung has totally detached himself from party 
operations, and Secretary General Tsai Chung-hsiung has 
returned to the United States disgusted with intra-party 
infighting.  Wu told AIT that Acting Secretary General Chin 
Ching-sheng, now charged with running party operations, is a 
former KMT \"organization man\" who is not trusted by Soong and 
is not part of his inner circle.  Although Chin has been 
designated as the liaison to the KMT, Wu said he does not 
know how he can fulfill his duties since he has had a 
long-standing feud with KMT Secretary General Lin Fong-cheng, 
the PFP\'s main point of contact.  As for the PFP\'s activist 
LY Caucus Leader Liu Wen-hsiung, Wu said \"he is nothing more 
than a gangster.\" 
 
5. (C) When pressed on the PFP\'s problems, Hwang admitted 
that things could be better.  Hwang acknowledged that Soong 
remains \"bitter and angry,\" but Hwang said he has worked very 
hard to calm Soong down and Soong is \"better now.\"  Hwang 
said that Vice Chairman Chang\'s detachment stemmed from his 
opposition to merger talks with the KMT and attributed Tsai\'s 
disappearance to the SecGen\'s inability to get along with 
others in the party leadership.  While acknowledging that 
acting SecGen Chin has many drawbacks, Hwang asserted that he 
is loyal and obedient, adding that \"these qualities are good 
enough.\" 
 
Comment: Party of Convenience 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The PFP as an organized political force has largely 
ceased to exist in the wake of the physical and/or mental 
disengagement of its senior leadership.  Thus far, this has 
not eliminated the PFP from contention in the upcoming 
election.  Those PFP candidates with high personal name 
recognition, perhaps not Hwang\'s 31 but at least two dozen, 
appear to be holding ground in public opinion polls, making a 
New Party-style collapse unlikely.  However, without strong 
direction from the top, the PFP has evolved into an 
incoherent mix of moderates like spokesman Hwang, radical 
bomb-throwers like Caucus Leader Liu, and non-ideological 
political operators like acting SecGen Chin.  What held these 
disparate groups together in the past was their shared 
loyalty to Soong and expectations that this loyalty would 
result in rewards once the Pan-Blue came to power.  With 
Soong\'s political career in tatters, this contract has broken 
down and for many in the PFP, the question of returning to 
the KMT, likely on KMT terms, is now only a matter of when, 
not if.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/26/2014 
TAGS: PGOV, TW 
SUBJECT: LY ELECTION PREVIEW: NORTH EASTERN TAIWAN 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Deputy Director David Keegan; Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
 1.  (C) Summary: Keelung and Ilan counties, while at odds 
politically, both look to be equally predictable in the 
December legislative Yuan (LY) elections.  Keelung is about 
60 percent Pan-Blue and has five candidates vying for three 
seats.  There are only four candidates running for three 
seats in the Green-stronghold of Ilan.  There is little 
energy in the campaigns in either district, with voter 
turn-out expected to be lower than in the 2001 LY elections. 
In Keelung, two of the three seats will likely go Pan-Blue, 
with the KMT and People First Party (PFP) splitting the seats 
and the third seat going to the DPP.  There is, however, some 
concern in the Pan-Blue camp that voters may throw too much 
support behind one of the candidates and allow a Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU) dark-horse to slip past the post.  In 
Ilan, early polls suggest that the DPP will grab two seats 
and the KMT will get the remaining seat.  The Pan-Blue in 
theory have enough votes to evenly split the vote between the 
KMT and PFP candidates and pick up two seats, but both sides 
think this is a long shot since the DPP has traditionally 
been better at this game and the KMT candidate\'s campaign 
strategy is focused on achieving victory for himself without 
concern for the PFP\'s prospects.  End summary. 
 
Keelung County: Still Blue 
-------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Keelung County (pop. 385,000) has three LY seats up 
for grabs in December.  A total of five candidates registered 
by the October 12 deadline, but only three of those 
candidates are being taken seriously.  According to the local 
KMT, PFP, and DPP organizations, Keelung is Pan-Blue 
territory with about 60 percent of voter support for the 
opposition.  Voter turn-out is expected to reach around 60-65 
percent based on past precedent.  Both sides have nominated 
two candidates each, but the TSU\'s Wang Tung-hui is 
struggling because his multiple party switches -- from KMT, 
to the DPP, and now the TSU -- has weakened his credibility 
among Keelung voters.  Both sides say the independent 
candidate Lu Mei-lung, is not a factor, since it is hard to 
win in Keelung without party support.  According to Keelung 
City Mayor Hsu Tsai-hi, the county was hit hard by the recent 
economic downturn, and voters will be looking for candidates 
that can use their party\'s weight in the LY to bring in money 
from the central government to develop Keelung\'s port and 
improve the area\'s infrastructure. 
 
Pan-Blue: Divide and Conquer 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Keelung\'s KMT Chairman, Li Poi-yuan, is confident the 
KMT and PFP candidates will win seats.  KMT candidate Hsu 
Shao-ping is an incumbent LY member and well-known to voters. 
 However, Li did express concern that the PFP candidate, 
Hsieh Kuo-liang, could steal away too many votes from the 
KMT, because of his family connections in Keelung, and give 
the Pan-Green an opening to win two seats.  Hsieh at 29 with 
a Masters degree from MIT, has a clean image, family wealth, 
and provides a fresh face in Keelung politics.  While he may 
be new to Keelung politics, his family is not; both his 
father and grandfather were prominent Keelung KMT members. 
He is running on the slogan of \"youth, professionalism, 
creativity, and technology.\"  Keelung PFP Chairman Yu 
Cheng-chen, also expressed concern about the voters taking 
overly supporting one of the candidates and like the KMT, is 
trying to ensure that voters support the candidates evenly. 
But Yu admitted that this is hard to control.  Yu said the 
main issues the PFP are focusing on are: \"Chen Shui-bian\'s 
dictatorship\" and \"Taiwan is finished\" if the Pan-Green 
achieves a majority in the LY.  Both Li and Yu told AIT that 
at this early stage in the election, they are confident they 
can garner a fairly even split and allow both candidates to 
win seats for Pan-Blue. 
 
DPP Expecting Final Seat 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) Keelung DPP Chairman, Shih Shih-ming, told AIT he is 
certain both the DPP, with incumbent candidate Wang To, and 
the KMT will each win one seat.  Shih said that the question 
remains who will pick up the third and final seat. 
Privately, Shih told AIT that the PFP has a better chance 
than the TSU of picking of the last seat.  Shih said the PFP 
candidate can win if he gets some of the KMT votes and uses 
his family connections.  Shih expressed only slight concern 
that the TSU may take away some votes from their candidate. 
Shih admitted the DPP\'s relationship with the TSU candidate 
is not close and that they are not planning to cooperate in 
Keelung.  The DPP\'s primary slogan is to \"seize the majority 
in the LY to end the chaos.\" 
 
Ilan County: True Green 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Ilan County (pop. 453,000), on the northeast coast of 
Taiwan has only three seats in the LY.  Since the last LY 
elections in 2001, it lost one seat due to its declining 
population.  This year, the mood appears to be sedate with 
only four candidates running down from the ten who ran for 
four seats in 2001.  Still, both sides estimate that each 
candidate will likely spend about $240,000 to $300,000 
(NT$8-10 million) on the campaign.  Ilan has traditionally 
been a Pan-Green stronghold with more than 50 percent of the 
population supporting Pan-Green candidates.  Voter turn-out 
is expected to be around 60 to possibly 65 percent, lower 
than the 71 percent voter turn-out in 2001.  Both sides have 
nominated two candidates and the two DPP candidates are 
expected to win seats.  The final seat is expected to go to 
the KMT candidate, who is running ahead of the DPP first 
local polls.  The incumbent PFP candidate is a distant fourth 
and is expected to lose her seat.  The DPP has been making a 
campaign issue of the KMT\'s assets since the KMT has two 
large properties in Ilan. 
 
DPP Running as a Team 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Ilan County DPP Chairman, Chen Ou-po, told AIT that 
their main focus is to get the two DPP candidates elected by 
splitting the vote (peipiao).  Both candidates, Chang 
Chuan-tien and Chen Chin-te, are incumbents and are running 
as a team.  The two always appear together at campaign 
rallies.  DPP Ilan County Council Deputy Speaker Chen 
Wen-chang remarked to AIT that the DPP has never had to worry 
about splitting votes in Ilan before, but they might have to 
for this election since there are only 3 seats now. 
According to Chen, the DPP does not have a set approach to 
divide the votes yet, but they are considering a variety of 
measures including having families split their votes among 
the two candidates.  DPP County Chairman Chen said the DPP is 
getting organizational and personnel support from DPP party 
central, but no funding.  Chen remarked that he is most 
worried that one candidate will be too selfish and try to 
take too many voters, which could give the PFP a chance.  But 
he quickly stated that this is not a major concern at this 
point. 
 
KMT Ahead, Won\'t Share Votes 
---------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The KMT\'s main strategy is to make certain they don\'t 
lose this year.  Their candidate, Chen Chien-jung, who serves 
as the Ilan County KMT Chairman, was number one in opinion 
polls prior to the 2001 LY election and lost because voters 
shifted their votes to other Pan-Blue candidates.  According 
to the KMT\'s Ilan County Headquarters Director, Chen 
Ming-chang, KMT candidate Chen is again ahead in the polls, 
but is taking nothing for granted this time.  For this 
reason, the KMT is looking to solidify their traditional 
support base and will do nothing to help the PFP.  Overall, 
Chen remarked that he is confident the KMT will win because 
their candidate is popular in Ilan, has name recognition from 
the last election, and has a good connection with the voters. 
 Chen told AIT that they expect some Pan-Blue voters to 
support the PFP, but recent polls say the PFP incumbent, 
Cheng Mei-lan, is running at only 5 percent.  Chen bluntly 
remarked that Cheng should not be running since there is no 
room for the PFP in Ilan and claimed that she was elected by 
accident last time.  He said it would take a \"miracle\" for 
Cheng win again.  Chen said one concern is the DPP making the 
KMT\'s property assets in Ilan a campaign issue.  Chen also 
accused the DPP of vote buying, but admitted he has no 
evidence of this. 
 
PFP Not Much Hope, But a Noble Candidate 
---------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Incumbent PFP candidate Cheng admits she has a long 
road ahead and not much of a chance.  She told AIT she is not 
just running for herself, but to give the voters another 
choice and help the Pan-Blue cause.  Cheng said that she has 
done a lot for the residents of Ilan, particularly for the 
women, and believes she should offer them a choice since she 
is the only female candidate.  Cheng also said she believes 
that her running will greatly increase Pan-Blue voter turn 
out in Ilan and help the Pan-Blue coalition gain or maintain 
an additional seat on the proportional list.  While admitting 
that she faces an uphill battle, Cheng asserted that she has 
a chance in this campaign if she can peel off some KMT 
voters.  She calculates she will get about 38,000 votes on 
her own and if she can get 20,000 KMT votes, she can win. 
Cheng said that this would still leave the KMT candidate Chen 
with more than enough votes (about 70,000) to win and the 
Pan-Blue could get two seats from Ilan.  But Cheng lamented 
that Chen will not give her any votes because of what 
happened during the last election so she must appeal to the 
voters themselves to support her. 
 
Comment: Voters Tired, Not Interested in National Issues 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
9.  (C) While it is still early in the campaign, the 
situation in both Keelung and Ilan appears to be predicable, 
barring any major developments or scandals.  Both sides 
expect the Pan-Blue to win two seats in Keelung and one seat 
in Ilan and the Pan-Green to win one seat in Keelung and two 
seats in Ilan.  The central party organizations seem to agree 
since candidates in both counties are not receiving any 
financial support and are relying on local fundraising 
efforts or their own personal wealth for funds.  The 
candidates do expect to have prominent party leaders come 
campaign and lead rallies, but this is likely due more to the 
two district\'s proximity to Taipei rather than their 
importance to the campaign.  National issues are not at the 
forefront of the this campaign, and the voters seem tired of 
politics after the presidential election earlier this year. 
Keelung City Mayor Yu remarked that \"the voters don\'t care 
about the issues\" while in Ilan, Deputy Speaker Chen said the 
climate has turned \"cold\" for the LY elections.

SUBJECT: MOFA ON THE DEFENSIVE OVER CENTRAL AMERICA AID 
 
REF: SAN JOSE 02803 
 
Classified By: AIT Deputy Director David J. Keegan, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  Taiwan officials are on the defensive in 
the wake of press allegations that MOFA funneled US$1.4 
million to former Costa Rican president Miguel Angel 
Rodriguez.  MOFA officials claim only $400,000 was given to 
Costa Rica for training programs and that Rodriguez 
apparently misused the funds.  Lawmakers have since released 
the approximately $40 million in confidential aid for Central 
America that had been frozen over the incident, but only if 
certain conditions are met by MOFA.  The scandal, however, is 
not likely to alter the way Taipei disperses aid to Central 
America in the immediate term.  MOFA and members of the 
Legislative Yuan (LY) appear most concerned with how the 
incident will affect Taipei\'s diplomatic battle with Beijing 
in the region, rather than whether it signals a need for more 
fundamental reform to Taipei\'s confidential aid procedures. 
Officials are adamant that a mechanism be established to 
ensure aid to Taiwan\'s diplomatic nations remains secret. 
Adding to Taipei\'s woes, the government of Nicaragua is also 
planning to officially request that Taiwan respond to 
allegations that it gave $1.5 million to former President 
Aleman.  MOFA officials tacitly acknowledge that some 
payments were made to Aleman.  End summary. 
 
MOFA Denies Payments Went to Rodriguez 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) MOFA officials assured lawmakers from the LY\'s 
Foreign Affairs Committee that press reports in Costa Rica 
that claimed Taiwan funneled $1.4 million in payments over 3 
years to former President Rodriguez were completely false. 
MOFA Deputy Director General for Latin American Affairs, Wu 
Chin-mu, told AIT that MOFA provided a total of $400,000 in 
2001 and 2002 for personnel training programs and conferences 
in response to a request from the Costa Rican government.  Wu 
said Rodriguez may well have misused the money for his own 
benefit without MOFA\'s knowledge.  Wu said that he knew 
nothing about the other $1 million that was reportedly passed 
to a Rodriguez affiliated company in Panama.  Wu also told 
AIT that this was the same explanation that was officially 
provided via Taipei\'s Embassy in San Jose to the Costa Rican 
government. 
 
Central American Aid Released With Conditions 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) After the Rodriguez scandal broke, $40 million in 
confidential aid funds for Central America were frozen by the 
 
SIPDIS 
LY\'s Foreign Affairs Committee.  The money was only released 
by the Foreign Affairs Committee after Foreign Minister Mark 
Chen personally agreed to meet certain conditions demanded by 
legislators.  Bill Sun, a lame duck KMT legislator on the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, told AIT that the LY\'s first 
requirement was that MOFA immediately form a multi-agency 
task-force comprised of diplomats, financial auditors, and 
lawmakers to investigate the Rodriguez allegations and to 
evaluate Taiwan\'s aid programs for Central America.  Sun also 
said he wanted to confirm that the $1 million had not been 
provided to Rodriguez through some other avenue, such as via 
the National Security Bureau (NSB).  Secondly, Sun said that 
MOFA had agreed to hold a video-teleconference with 
lawmakers, MOFA officials, and Taiwan\'s Central American 
Ambassadors to determine the best strategy over the next six 
months to minimize damage to Taiwan\'s relationship with its 
diplomatic partners.  Sun asserted that the task force may 
eventually evolve into a policy making group to review 
methods for providing aid and safeguards to ensure 
confidentiality. 
 
SIPDIS 
4. (C) Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Foreign Affairs 
Committee Convener Bi-khim Hsiao told AIT that the recent 
revelations were unfortunate, but demonstrated the challenges 
Taiwan faces in trying to maintain its dwindling numbers of 
formal diplomatic relationships.  Hsiao noted that Foreign 
Minister Mark Chen and his recent predecessors have all 
endorsed the need for more transparency in the way Taiwan 
distributes foreign aid, but their enthusiasm has been 
tempered by fear of being the one held responsible for 
\"losing\" a diplomatic partner.  Hsiao said that a full 
disclosure of Taiwan\'s aid programs may also incite a bidding 
war among Taiwan\'s developing country relations.  Hsiao 
asserted that the only course open to the DPP government is 
to incrementally reform its money-based foreign policy 
approach to enhance accountability. 
 
Impact on Diplomatic Relations? 
------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) MOFA officials do not believe the scandal will have 
any immediate consequences on Taipei\'s diplomatic standing in 
Central America.  However, there is concern that in the long 
term this could have serious ramifications on Taipei\'s 
competition with Beijing in Latin America.  Sun told AIT he 
is worried that Taiwan\'s interests would be jeopardized if 
Taipei\'s Central American partners started to \"compare notes\" 
over how much they each receive from Taiwan.  Sun also 
expressed concern over the PRC\'s ability to discover the 
amount of aid Taiwan is giving and the manner in which it is 
distributed.  Wu echoed Sun\'s comments and expressed dismay 
that details of MOFA foreign aid practices had been publicly 
revealed.  He was particularly concerned that Beijing\'s 
knowledge of Taipei\'s activities in the region might allow 
them to outbid Taipei, as he claimed occurred with Antigua 
earlier in the year.  Wu added that the PRC is very active in 
the region and is trying to steal away Taiwan\'s diplomatic 
relationships. 
 
Et Tu Managua? 
-------------- 
 
6.  (C) Within days of the Costa Rican allegations came 
reports that MOFA may have provided payments to the 
Nicaraguan former president, Arnoldo Aleman.  When asked 
about the allegations that $1.5 million had been transferred 
to Aleman while he was president, MOFA DDG Wu did not deny 
the allegations.  Rather, he explained to AIT that Taiwan 
faces unique diplomatic challenges and cannot always rely on 
traditional forms of diplomacy.  Wu refused to say how Taipei 
would respond to reported plans by Nicaragua to ask Taipei 
for an official explanation over the Aleman affair. 
 
Comment: Will Anything Really Change? 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Despite the embarrassment this scandal has caused 
Taipei and MOFA, Taiwan shows little inclination in the 
short-run to change the way aid is dispersed to Central 
America.  Under-the-table payments to foreign leaders have 
been a mainstay of Taipei\'s foreign policy for decades. 
However, with Beijing becoming increasingly active in the 
region and new, potentially less friendly (and less corrupt) 
governments in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama, Taipei has 
little margin for error in the diplomatic recognition game. 
New administrations in Central America may find that it is 
not worth the embarrassment of dealing with Taiwan if these 
aid flaps continue, especially if Beijing steps up to the 
plate with more attractive above board incentive packages. 
Moreover, a growing backlash at home and abroad against the 
practice of direct payments to political parties and foreign 
leaders also complicates the traditional approach.

SUBJECT: Problem Bank for Sale 
 
 
1.  Summary.  Taiwan authorities will auction off another 
problem bank currently in receivership at the beginning of 
December, part of their on-going effort to reduce the number 
of banks and thereby improve the health of Taiwan\'s 
financial sector.  However, creditor banks will not receive 
payment until the legislature provides additional funding 
for the financial reconstruction fund charged with 
addressing problem banking institutions.  Taiwan has 11 
other banks and dozens of small community financial 
institutions with relatively high non-performing loan ratios 
that have not yet been addressed.  End Summary. 
 
Bidding Schedule, Qualifications 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  Taiwan\'s Central Deposit Insurance Corporation. (CDIC) 
will conduct open bidding on December 9 for the Chung Shing 
Bank (CSB), the last problem financial institution still 
under CDIC receivership (CDIC has not yet addressed the 11 
other problem banks).  A CDIC official told AIT that 
qualifications for bidding have been relaxed to permit both 
domestic and foreign securities firms, insurance companies, 
and investment institutions.  (In the past, only local and 
foreign financial holding companies and banks were permitted 
to bid for problem banking institutions.)  Interested 
companies are required to register before November 4.  CDIC 
also requires that the winning bidder must raise CSB\'s 
capital from the current NTD 5 billion to above NTD 10 
billion within three years.  If a bank wins the bid, the 
bank must still meet the 8 percent capital adequacy ratio 
after acquiring CSB. 
 
Good and Bad Parts of the Bank Separated 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  Although the CDIC sold most of CSB\'s non-performing 
loans in December 2003 and March 2004, the December sale 
will also exclude some of CSB\'s remaining liabilities.  The 
excluded liabilities are time deposits, deposits of other 
banks, negotiable certificates of deposit issued by CSB, and 
liabilities obtained from the inter-bank market.  CDIC has 
obtained the creditor banks\' assent to delay repayment of 
the NT$64.9 billion owed to them until the Legislative Yuan 
passes a bill to increase the funding for the Financial 
Reconstruction Fund (FRF, similar to the U.S. RTC.) 
According to an official at CDIC\'s Banking Institution 
Disposal Department, if the additional funding bill fails to 
pass before the FRF expires on July 9, 2005, the Treasury 
will pay the CSB\'s outstanding liabilities.  CSB will not be 
required to pay this amount.  FRF funding has come from a 2- 
percent gross business receipt tax collected from financial 
institutions.  The CDIC sale in December will be the 
remaining, relatively healthy, parts of the bank with a 
positive net worth of NTD 6.4 billion.  There will be no 
need for any additional compensation to the winning bidder 
from FRF, as was needed in the two other sales of problem 
banks this year. 
 
4.  CDIC has received inquiries about the sale from several 
foreign firms and seven local financial institutions 
(including Cathay United Bank and ChinaTrust Commercial 
Bank).  Late last year, Taiwan\'s Bureau of Monetary Affairs 
stopped issuing permits for new bank branches in an effort 
to address the problem of too many banks for the size of the 
market.  (Taiwan has more than double the number of bank 
branches per capita of other Asian markets.)  This leaves 
merger or acquisition as the only way to expand bank 
networks.  The winner of the bid for CSB will take over its 
34 branches and will be allowed to open another 12 branches. 
The bid winner will also be authorized to transform the CSB 
trust department into a branch office and to relocate 
offices as desired. 
Two Earlier Sales of Problem Banks 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  The use of the financial reconstruction fund to repair 
the banks books and the chance to acquire additional bank 
branches proved attractive to other domestic banks.  In late 
May the CDIC sale of the Kaohsiung Business Bank (KBB) 
attracted bids from eight local financial institutions.  The 
winner was the E. Sun Bank, which wanted to expand its 
presence in southern Taiwan.  In exchange for acquiring the 
KBB\'s 60 banking offices, E. Sun paid NTD 3.73 billion. 
This amount was the gap between the FRF\'s compensation of 
NTD 13.37 billion and the KBB\'s net worth of negative NTD 
17.1 billion.  In July, the sale of the problem Fifth Credit 
Cooperative Association of Fengshan (FCCAF) also attracted 
eight bids.  The winner was the ChinaTrust Commercial Bank, 
which, in exchange for the FCCAF\'s 10 banking offices, paid 
NTD 760 million, the gap between FRF\'s compensation of NTD 
1.1 billion and the FCCAF\'s net worth of negative NTD 1.86 
billion. 
 
Serious Problems Remain 
----------------------- 
 
6.  The resolution of CSB will totally exhaust the FRF 
funding of NTD 140 billion.  If Taiwan\'s legislature fails 
to increase the funding, there will be no ready solution for 
the other 11 problem banks and 93 problem credit departments 
of farmers\' associations.  Financial officials estimate that 
NTD 270-280 billion will be required to address these 
problem institutions.  Taiwan officials have said they 
welcome foreign ownership of a local bank to heighten 
competition in the banking sector.  However, while foreign 
investors are allowed to bid for CSB, the restriction on 
opening new branches encourages local banks to consider 
acquiring CSB in order to expand their business.  This 
pressure may increase the amount that domestic banks are 
willing to pay for CSB.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: SECRETARY POWELL\'S BEIJING 
TRIP AND U.S. POLICY, WAR ON TERRORISM 
 
 
1. Secretary Powell\'s Beijing Trip and U.S. Policy 
 
A) \"President Chen Once Said He Would Make the United 
States Happy and Give Beijing No Excuse [to Attack 
Taiwan]\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
editorialized (10/31): 
 
\". Judged from whichever perspective, Secretary 
Powell\'s remarks [in Beijing] indicate that President 
Chen\'s previous rhetoric that he `would make the United 
States feel happy and give Beijing no excuse [to attack 
Taiwan]\' has proved to be a mere illusion.  Now, not 
only does Beijing have a lot of excuses [to attack the 
island], but also Washington even has scolded Taiwan 
publicly in Beijing.  The heavy blow dealt by Powell 
shows that the position held by the Chen Shui-bian 
administration that `Taiwan is an independent sovereign 
state\' has led Taiwan to a road that will [cause it to] 
have to confront two major powers - Washington and 
Beijing.  In the past, the Chen Shui-bian 
administration was able to move around in the somewhat 
narrowed cross-Strait relationship and it would 
manipulate `war flame diplomacy\' by relying on the 
goodwill of the Bush administration.  Without such a 
shield, Taiwan, which is splitting domestically, will 
face a will-centered and power-centered mainland China. 
This is the most perilous situation that Taiwan has 
never encountered in the past five decades. .\" 
 
B) \"`Powell Disturbance\' Happens Because Taiwan\'s and 
Washington\'s Cross-Strait Policies Both Deviate from 
Reality\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" said in an 
editorial (10/30): 
 
\". The `Powell disturbance\' . reminded Taiwan that it 
needs to accelerate its pace in moving toward normal 
country [status] and terminate the `Republic of China\' 
that implies entanglement with China, so that Taiwan\'s 
sovereign status can be safeguarded by the 
international community.  The `Powell disturbance\' also 
reminded Washington to adjust its cross-Strait policy 
as early as possible, renouncing the `one China policy\' 
that is not supported in Taiwan, recognizing Taiwan\'s 
sovereignty and respecting the will of the Taiwan 
people.  Only when Taiwan and the United States quickly 
mend the gap between their policies and reality can 
they jointly urge Beijing to face reality. .\" 
 
C) \"The United States Owes Taiwan an Explanation\" 
 
The \"News Watch\" column of the pro-independence \"Taiwan 
Daily\" noted (10/30): 
 
\". If Taiwan is not an `independent sovereign state,\' 
why does it have to buy weapons and have its own 
military?  If Taiwan is a province of China, why then 
does the United States need to sell weapons to us? 
This is a bizarre question that the United States 
should offer an explanation about to Taiwan.\" 
 
D) \"The United States Should Accept the Fact That 
Taiwan Has Grown up\" 
 
Correspondent James Wang said in the \"Washington 
Review\" column of the pro-independence \"Taiwan Daily\" 
(10/30): 
 
\". The United States should seriously reconsider that 
the so-called `one China\' policy will face more 
disputes and backlashes if Washington refuses to accept 
the status quo that Taiwan is already a sovereign 
nation.  It hurt the feelings of the Taiwan people 
badly when the United States said Taiwan, which was 
built following the model of U.S. democracy, is `not\' a 
country.  Even if Washington cannot change its policy 
for the time being, it should at least be more 
sensitive to Taiwan\'s sovereign status.\" 
 
E) \"Strategic Thinking Needed in Handling U.S.-Taiwan 
Ties\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taiwan News\" 
editorialized (11/1): 
 
\"After the week-long fracas over the apparent flip- 
flopping statements by United States Secretary of State 
Colin Powell, Taiwan faces an even more serious 
challenge as we and the world await the results of the 
November 2 U.S. presidential election. 
 
\"To face the new era that will come from the results of 
this poll, the Democratic Progressive Party 
administration of President Chen Shui-bian urgently 
needs an entirely new pattern of strategic thinking 
regarding the Taiwan-U.S. relationship. . 
 
\". Washington\'s so-called `Our One-China Policy\' 
remains the same, but its strategy has changed. 
 
\"Taiwan leaders now need to bear this new political 
reality in mind.  No matter who wins the U.S. 
presidential election, more pressure will be put on 
Taiwan to refrain from making moves or `trouble\' that 
could hurt what the current administration in 
Washington perceives as U.S. national interests.  This 
state of affairs has arisen not because Taiwan has 
weakened, but because Taiwan is more democratic and the 
PRC is both undemocratic and less predictable. 
 
\"Hence, discussions on whether Bush or Kerry is 
`friendlier\' to Taiwan are meaningless.  Any preference 
for either side should thus not be founded on 
exaggerated expectations of improvement in bilateral 
relations, but on broader concerns, namely which 
candidate offers to foster a global environment more 
favorable for Taiwan to proceed on our road toward 
democracy, peace and sustainability. .\" 
 
2. War on Terrorism 
 
\"Taiwan Should Watch Closely the United States\' Anti- 
Terrorism Strategic Deployment after the General 
Elections\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" editorialized 
(11/1): 
 
\". [T]he focus of the United States\' global strategic 
deployment will remain basically the same . in the 
future.  For Taiwan, this means both an opportunity and 
a challenge.  The challenge is that the United States 
hopes China would assist in the war on terrorism, and 
thus it makes it possible for China to blackmail 
Washington using the Taiwan issue.  The opportunity, 
however, is that both [U.S. President George W.] Bush 
and [Democratic presidential candidate John] Kerry 
insist on continuing selling defensive weapons to 
Taiwan and they support a peaceful resolution to cross- 
Strait disputes with the consent of the Taiwan people. 
Since the September 11 tragedy, Taiwan has been a great 
supporter of the global war on terrorism led by the 
United States, and this has proved [that] deep mutual 
interests [exist] between Taipei and Washington.  In 
the wake of the U.S. general elections, Taiwan and the 
United States could strengthen their communication and 
contact to effectively control the tensions caused by 
China\'s military intimidation and jointly promote the 
two sides\' mutual interests and democratic values in 
the Asia-Pacific region.\"

TRIP AND U.S. POLICY 
 
 
A) \"Have [Our] Rulers Really Tried Every Means to Stop 
War?\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
editorialized (11/2): 
 
\". U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell\'s recent 
remarks have triggered a storm [in Taiwan], but they 
have also fully proven that `arms sales alone are not 
adequate to protect peace in Taiwan.\'  The focus of 
Powell\'s remarks was the denial of Taiwan\'s independent 
sovereignty and an emphasis on a `peaceful resolution\' 
[to cross-Strait disputes].  He even misspoke or hinted 
about the `peaceful unification\' of both sides of the 
Taiwan Strait.  Powell\'s talks . mainly stick to the 
principle of maintaining peace across the Taiwan 
Strait, and he warned the Taiwan authorities not to 
transgress the boundaries.  For now, what can be 
certain is that no matter how Washington-Beijing-Taipei 
ties will develop in the future, the United States will 
not go to war with China for the Taiwan issue, and 
Taiwan (no matter whether it buys those weapons [from 
the United States] or not) cannot afford to resolve the 
cross-Strait disputes by means of war.  China\'s missile 
threat [against the island] is a fact, but [Taiwan\'s] 
push for and provocative movements towards Taiwan 
independence is also a reality.  The United States, 
however, is strongly opposed to any `unilateral attempt 
to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.\'  Under 
such a situation, the only factor that Taiwan can 
control is not to purposely cross the `red line.\'  The 
[Taiwan] government, however, is trying to solicit 
political support by occasionally `sneaking in\' some 
movement to push for Taiwan independence but at the 
same time trying to engage in an arms race [with 
Beijing] by spending a huge amount of money buying 
weapons.  Can such an attitude of making combat 
readiness, engaging in an arms race and even [taking] 
provocative movements help in the pursuit of peace for 
Taiwan? .\" 
 
B) \"A Self-ruled Chinese Non-state\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" said in an editorial (11/2): 
 
\". Taipei\'s reckless push for independence, defying 
repeated U.S. cautions and ignoring the basic rules of 
courtesy, prompted Powell\'s tough talk.  Some critics 
have openly scolded Taipei for `biting the hand that 
feeds it.\' 
 
\"The U.S. has come to the realization that separatism, 
if unchecked, is bound to spark a cross-strait war, 
disrupting regional peace and stability and dragging 
the reluctant U.S. into it. 
 
\"Washington also aims to influence Taiwan\'s December 
legislative election, reminding voters of the risk of 
supporting pro-independence candidates.  When Powell 
stated that Taiwan was not a sovereign state, he was 
describing a historic fact.  As a piece of Chinese 
territory, it was never a state. . 
 
\"The Powell episode suggests Taiwan\'s course for the 
future is limited. 
 
\"Like it or not, the U.S. message is loud and clear: 
`Taiwan can continue its self-rule as long as Beijing 
is not disturbed.\'\"

SUBJECT: TAIWAN - TFT-LCDS, NOT THE NEXT SEMICONDUCTORS 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas H. Paal, Reason 1.4 (B/D) 
 
Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
 
1.  (U) TFT-LCD (thin-film transistor liquid crystal display) 
manufacturing is a key industry in Taiwan with high 
expectations for future expansion.  TFT-LCDs and other 
flat-panel displays, which are used in all laptop computers, 
most desktop monitors and increasingly in televisions, earned 
USD 12.4 billion for Taiwan in 2003.  Taiwan firms accounted 
for 34.9 percent of large-size panels.  The government has a 
plan to further develop the industry, placing it on a par 
with semiconductor manufacturing.  However, the industry is 
currently experiencing severe oversupply due to excessive 
investment.  A turnaround is unlikely before the second half 
of next year.  Analysts argue that Taiwan\'s five major 
manufacturers need to merge to compete successfully in the 
long term, but despite current excess supply problems, no 
financial pressure to merge exists at this time.  As in 
Taiwan\'s other high-tech industries, Taiwan produces high 
tech components, which are primarily exported to the PRC for 
assembly into finished consumer electronic goods and then 
re-exported to the U.S., Europe and Japan. 
 
2.  (C) Despite the current downturn and fierce price 
competition, TFT-LCD manufacturing will continue to be an 
important engine for growth in Taiwan\'s economy.  However, 
the industry will not have the same kind of impact as 
semiconductor manufacturing.  Even the most optimistic 
predictions of TFT-LCD applications cannot match the 
versatility and widespread need for semiconductors. 
Moreover, TFT-LCDs will also not have the strategic 
implications of semiconductors that have raised Taiwan\'s 
profile politically as well as economically.  (End summary 
and comment.) 
 
Aiming for Number One 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (U) The role of TFT-LCD manufacturing in the Taiwan 
economy is important and growing.  In 2003, the flat-panel 
display industry\'s total output value for Taiwan was NT$ 
416.2 billion (USD 12.4 billion).  TFT-LCD panels are the 
largest component of Taiwan\'s flat-panel display industry. 
Taiwan produced 34.9 percent of the world\'s large-size (10 
inches or larger) TFT-LCD panels last year.  TFT-LCD export 
revenues totaled USD 3.9 billion in the second quarter of 
2004, an increase of 129 percent from the same period the 
previous year.  TFT-LCDs account for approximately six 
percent of Taiwan\'s export revenue.  TFT-LCD manufacturers 
currently account for some 60 to 70 percent of revenue 
generated in the Southern Taiwan Science-based Industrial 
Park (STSIP). 
 
4.  (U) Taiwan has identified the display industry as one of 
the \"Two Trillions\" in the Ministry of Economic Affairs\' \"Two 
Trillions, Twin Stars\" plan.  This plan aims to strengthen 
what the Taiwan government sees as four of the most important 
industries for Taiwan\'s future: the two potential NT$ 1 
trillion revenue industries of semiconductors and displays 
and the two potential stars of the future, biotechnology and 
digital content.  TFT-LCDs are the key component in the 
display manufacturing industry.  The plan aims for Taiwan\'s 
display production to reach NT$ 1.37 trillion in 2006.  The 
government has also set the goal of overtaking South Korea to 
become the number one producer of TFT-LCD products in the 
world.  It appears set to do that this year.  Towards these 
ends, the government has encouraged joint research and 
development among TFT-LCD producers, vertical industry 
integration into upstream and downstream manufacturing 
processes, and education and training to meet the industry\'s 
needs. 
 
Market Glut 
----------- 
 
5.  (U) However, the TFT-LCD industry\'s outlook is not at all 
promising in the near term.  According to industry observers, 
the TFT-LCDs industry is very cyclical and is currently 
experiencing a serious downturn.  Heavy investment in recent 
years, especially in Taiwan, is bringing more factories 
online.  A report by the government\'s Industrial Technology 
Research Institute (ITRI) indicated that spending on TFT-LCD 
manufacturing equipment worldwide has surged 43 percent this 
year.  Supply is currently outpacing demand.  Inventories are 
rising, and prices are falling.  ITRI reported that supply 
would exceed demand by 20 percent in the first quarter of 
2005.  About half of the current oversupply is made up of 
larger panels designed for televisions.  AU Optronics and Chi 
Mei, Taiwan\'s largest producers, last week announced earnings 
for the third quarter of 2004 were down 70 and 63 percent 
respectively.  Both are reportedly considering deferring 
construction of the next generation of factories due to 
excess supply. 
 
6.  (C) Analysts have differing views on when the industry 
will turn around.  Some predict that a turnaround could begin 
by the end of this year or in the first quarter of the next. 
However, most foresee a longer slump.  Abel Wang, research 
director at the Market Intelligence Center (MIC), an IT 
industry analysis and consulting firm, told AIT/T that the 
turnaround won\'t come until the fourth quarter of 2005. 
According to Wang, by that point, the cost of TFT-LCD 
television sets will have dropped to half of current prices 
and will reach a point where a critical mass of consumers 
will choose TFT-LCD televisions over cathode ray tube (CRT) 
ones.  TFT-LCD panels already account for 100 percent of 
laptop computers and 75 percent of desktop monitors.  Most 
producers now look toward televisions as the main area for 
expansion over the next five years.  During a visit to 
Tainan\'s STSIP by AIT/T and AIT/K on October 13, Chi Mei 
representatives confirmed Wang\'s prediction by openly 
predicting that flat-panel television sets will drop sharply 
in price by the second half of 2005.  They recommended that 
if you are in the market for a TV, wait a while and save a 
lot. 
 
No Urge to Merge 
---------------- 
 
7.  (U) While the number one producer, South Korea, has two 
dominant TFT-LCD manufacturers, Samsung and LG Phillips, 
Taiwan\'s industry is more fractured.  Some say that Taiwan\'s 
TFT-LCD industry has \"two tigers,\" AU Optronics and Chi Mei, 
and \"three kittens,\" HannStar, Quanta, and Chunghwa Picture 
Tube (CPT).  Many experts have argued that Taiwan\'s 
manufacturers need to merge in order to be able to compete 
with the big South Korean firms in the long run.  As a 
result, media reports indicate that the government is 
considering offering low-interest loans, tax breaks and other 
incentives to encourage consolidation. 
 
8.  (C) TFT-LCD manufacturers have responded negatively to 
suggestions that they need to merge.  As MIC\'s Wang explained 
to AIT, the need to develop new technologies and finance new 
investment as well as manufacturing economies of scale offer 
important advantages to larger TFT-LCD producers.  However, 
Taiwan\'s producers do not feel that these factors necessitate 
industry mergers at this time.  They claim that because they 
each use different manufacturing processes, mergers would not 
improve their research and development potential.  They also 
claim different technologies would impede integration between 
existing firms.  The technology differs because the various 
Taiwan firms import their manufacturing equipment from 
different Japanese firms.  For example, AU Optronics buys its 
equipment from Toshiba and Panasonic; Chi Mei buys from 
Fujitsu; Quanta buys from Sharp, etc.  Wang also pointed out 
that despite recent troubling signs for the industry, 
especially in the near term, none of the Taiwan producers has 
had difficulty raising capital.  Without any real financial 
pressure, mergers are unlikely. 
 
Another Cross-Strait Supply Chain 
--------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) TFT-LCD manufacturing is another industry in which 
increasing investment in Mainland China is driving Taiwan\'s 
exports of components.  Taiwan TFT-LCD producers do not 
generally manufacture finished consumer electronic goods. 
Their main product is the TFT-LCD module, which is used as a 
component in laptop computers, desktop monitors, television 
sets and other products.  The finished products are not 
manufactured in Taiwan in large amounts.  Most are assembled 
in the PRC.  In addition, Taiwan\'s TFT-LCD manufacturers have 
moved some of the downstream, labor-intensive processes in 
manufacturing TFT-LCD modules, particularly the final module 
assembly, to factories in the Mainland.  The most capital and 
technology-intensive processes are still entirely performed 
in Taiwan.  These include manufacturing of the panel array 
and the cell.  The Taiwan government currently forbids Taiwan 
firms from investing in cell and array manufacturing plants 
in the PRC.  MIC\'s Wang believes that Taiwan still holds an 
advantage in these capital-intensive processes.  He predicted 
that it would not be economically advantageous to move array 
and cell manufacturing to the Mainland for the next five to 
ten years.  However, Wu Tai-kang, President of HannStar, one 
of Taiwan\'s three second-tier producers, told AIT that his 
firm would be interested in investing in array and cell 
manufacturing in the Mainland if it were legal now. 
 
10.  (U) As is the case with most of Taiwan\'s information 
technology and other high-tech industries, high-tech 
components are manufactured in Taiwan, exported to the 
Mainland for assembly into consumer goods, which are in turn 
exported to the United States, Europe and Japan.  In the case 
of TFT-LCDs, another important link in the supply chain 
involves the modules\' inputs, which historically have been 
imported primarily from Japan.  One key input is the 
manufacturing machinery produced by Japanese firms like 
Toshiba, Fujitsu and Sharp.  Japanese producers also dominate 
the production of TFT-LCD manufacturing materials, such as 
glass, chemicals, and color filters.  While Taiwan does not 
yet have the industrial capacity to produce the manufacturing 
machinery, the other inputs are increasingly produced in 
Taiwan.  U.S. firms are also taking part in this trend. 
Corning Glass is building a new LCD glass manufacturing plant 
in Taichung\'s new science and technology park.  In early 
October, it announced it would expand its investment in the 
plant by USD 326 million.  In mid-October, 3M broke ground on 
a new brightness-enhancement film (BEF) plant in Tainan\'s 
STSIP. 
 
TFT-LCD Role In Taiwan\'s Economic Future 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11.  (U) The Taiwan government and TFT-LCD producers 
increasingly see TFT-LCD manufacturing as a pillar for 
Taiwan\'s economy, much as semiconductors were in the 1980s 
and 1990s.  There are clear disadvantages in relying heavily 
on the TFT-LCD industry.  First, like semiconductors, the 
TFT-LCD industry is very cyclical.  Profitability for 
manufacturers has risen and fallen sharply as TFT-LCD 
displays have penetrated new product markets and then 
successfully saturated the market.  In one sense, the cycle 
is even more hazardous than the semiconductor cycle.  While 
semiconductor prices go up and down, prices usually return to 
previous levels driven by new technology with more 
capabilities.  TFT-LCD prices, on the other hand, are likely 
to trend downward over time because of limited potential for 
improving the product\'s capability. 
 
12.  (C) Some observers also note that TFT-LCDs do not have 
as many applications as semiconductors or the strategic value 
of semiconductors.  They are currently used in a much 
narrower range of products than semiconductors and can be 
replaced by other display technologies.  Nevertheless, some 
inside the industry have high expectations for the expansion 
of TFT-LCD use in a wide variety of goods.  HannStar\'s Wu 
told us that while many are focused on television sets as the 
source of the industry\'s future growth, he believes that 
televisions are not the best fit for TFT-LCD technology.  He 
points out that the technology\'s greatest advantages are its 
low weight and low power consumption.  He sees vast potential 
in all forms of consumer electronics, especially portable and 
mobile electronics.  He predicts that TFT-LCDs can be part of 
a revolution in how people interface with technology.

1.  (C) Summary:  Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh 
will once again represent Chinese Taipei at the APEC Leaders\' 
Meeting in November in Santiago, Chile.  Academia Sinica\'s 
Michael Hsiao and National Security Council\'s Connie Yang 
believe the Chinese Taipei delegation will try to avoid any 
controversial moves at the APEC Summit but will seek to play 
an active role in discussion of health and high tech issues. 
Hsiao and Yang promised that Chinese Taipei would support 
U.S. initiatives on transparency and anti-corruption, but 
would not be active on security related issues.  Chinese 
Taipei will seek a handful of official and unofficial 
bilateral meetings, but is not planning for any detailed 
discussions at the Leaders\' Meeting.  Chinese Taipei 
representatives to the Ministers\' Meeting are more likely to 
engage on substantive discussions on the margins, possibly 
including cross-Strait transportation.  End Summary. 
 
Chinese-Taipei Picking its Spots in APEC 
======================================== 
 
2.  (SBU) President Chen announced September 21 that Academia 
Sinica President Dr. Lee Yuan-tseh would once again represent 
him at the APEC Leaders\' Meeting November 20-21 in Santiago, 
Chile.  This will be the third straight year Lee, a 1986 
Nobel Prize laureate in chemistry, has represented Chen at 
the annual meeting.  Academia Sinica researcher Michael 
Hsiao, Lee\'s aide de camp in previous meetings and a member 
of the National Security Council-led group discussing 
Taiwan\'s goals for the APEC Summit characterized Chinese 
Taipei\'s objectives for the 2004 Leaders\' Meeting as the same 
as last year: trying to secure as many formal and informal 
bilateral meetings with other APEC leaders as practical, 
actively participating in those areas where Taiwan has 
specific interests or expertise, and avoiding controversial 
situations that might damage Taiwan\'s standing within APEC. 
 
3.  (SBU) He saw particular opportunities for Chinese Taipei 
to play a role in discussions on health and the utilization 
of high technology to facilitate trade and bridge the digital 
divide.   The SARS crisis in 2003 spurred the creation of a 
Health Task Force to analyze health consequences of trade 
policies, support regional health preparedness policies and 
to develop strategic priorities for cooperation.  The recent 
outbreaks of Avian Flu in Asia suggest to Hsiao that it might 
be useful to expand this task force to allow it to better 
share information, review best practices, and coordinate 
responses.  Chinese Taipei would support a call for Health 
Ministers to expand the scope of the Heath Task Force for 
this purpose.  Hsiao said Chinese Taipei would also support 
efforts to establish an APEC-supported AIDS Center in 
Thailand and establishment of a clearinghouse for information 
on vaccines. 
 
4.  (SBU) In high-tech areas Taiwan has expertise that it is 
eager to share with other economies in APEC.  Hsiao noted the 
recent report issued by the APEC Secretariat lauding Chinese 
Taipei\'s use of technology to facilitate trade by increasing 
transparency and efficiency.  Chinese Taipei has been active 
in efforts to bridge the digital divide within APEC, for 
example, by promoting telecenters for computer and digital 
training, and will seek to continue and expand that role, 
including through allocation of resources, including funding, 
to appropriate projects. 
 
5.  (SBU) NSC Senior Economic Advisor Connie Yang echoed 
Hsiao\'s comments that Taiwan would focus its efforts in areas 
where it felt it could contribute most to APEC initiatives. 
She highlighted in particular the issue of Avian Flu and 
suggested that Taiwan was well-placed to play a significant 
role in the development of the Health Task Force into an 
entity that could better support regional health preparedness 
activities and information sharing.  Yang also noted Chinese 
Taipei\'s efforts to help other member economies develop their 
digital technology capabilities. 
 
Support for U.S. Initiatives, But Security Takes Backseat 
============================================= ============ 
 
6.  (C) Hsiao said that Chinese Taipei will support U.S. led 
anti-corruption initiatives.  Although Chinese Taipei cannot 
sign the UN Convention against Corruption, the government is 
planning to incorporate the principles of the convention in 
Taiwan law.  Chinese Taipei will also support proposals for 
APEC reforms.  Chinese Taipei will not seek a prominent role 
in discussion of security related issues, but will support 
APEC consensus.  Although supporting U.S. calls for 
counter-terrorism activities within APEC, including 
nonproliferation, restrictions on MANPADS, and attention to 
economic security issues, Hsiao was concerned that an active 
approach in security related discussions would be 
counterproductive.  Yang later agreed that the NSC also 
believes any intervention by Chinese Taipei on these issues 
would be more damaging than helpful.  She said the NSC 
clearly understands that it is best for Taiwan to remain 
silent in these discussions. 
 
Seeking Bilateral Meetings... 
============================= 
 
7.  (C) As in past years, Chinese Taipei will try to take 
advantage of the APEC Leaders\' Meeting to schedule official 
and informal bilateral meetings with regional leaders.  Hsiao 
suggested Chinese Taipei would attempt to schedule four or 
five official meetings, listing Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, 
and Papua New Guinea as potential partners.  Topics of 
discussion might include trade issues, development assistance 
for PNG, and Taiwan\'s security relationship with Japan. 
Taiwan is likely to again request a meeting with a high-level 
U.S. official (not the President) during the Summit. 
 
But No Substantive Cross-Strait Dialogue 
======================================== 
 
8.  (C) Hsiao was hopeful that Lee would have the opportunity 
to have an informal discussion with Chinese President Hu 
Jintao, but insisted there were no plans for Lee to pass any 
detailed message from President Chen regarding the 
possibility of expanding dialogue between the two sides of 
the Strait.  Lee said to the press November 2 that he felt he 
was not the right envoy for a cross-strait dialogue and 
declared the most effective way to conduct cross-strait 
communication is for Hu and Chen to meet face to face. Lee 
said he will make this suggestion directly to Hu Jintao at 
APEC if he has a chance to meet him.   Hsiao said Chinese 
Taipei was optimistic that detailed discussions regarding 
cross-Strait ties, including direct flights for Chinese New 
Year, might occur during the Joint Ministerial Meetings, 
November 17-18. 
 
9. (SBU) Comment: Taiwan\'s leadership has traditionally used 
APEC, one of the few prominent international organizations of 
which Taiwan is a full member, primarily as a forum in which 
to interact on an equal basis with regional partners.  This 
has paid dividends in areas where Taiwan is strong, such as 
telecommunications and high technology discussions, and 
Chinese Taipei\'s representatives have been valuable 
contributors to APEC\'s activities on these topics.  In the 
health care field, Taiwan clearly sees APEC\'s Health Task 
Force as an opportunity to demonstrate its value in 
international health cooperation.  The Taiwan government 
appears to be reluctant to risk its standing in APEC by 
courting the controversy that would invariably surround an 
attempt to support actively discussion of security issues. 
Although supportive of including security discussions within 
APEC, Taiwan policy-makers believe Taiwan\'s interests are 
best served by taking a low-profile approach at the upcoming 
Leaders\' Meeting and benefiting from any positive outcomes.

1. (C) Summary: Changhua County (ten seats) and Taichung City 
(eight seats) are likely to be major battlegrounds in the 
struggle for control of the Legislative Yuan (LY) in this 
December\'s elections.  Both districts have traditionally been 
strongholds for the Pan-Blue, but weakness in the Pan-Blue 
alliance and shifts in voting patterns seen in the March 
presidential election have encouraged the Pan-Green to go on 
the offensive.  In both districts, the Democratic Progressive 
Party (DPP) has nominated all of its incumbents and added a 
strong moderate to the slate in each in the hopes of taking 
an extra seat and getting closer to a working majority in the 
LY.  If the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) candidate in 
Changhua and a pro-Green former Mayor in Taichung also do 
well, the Pan-Green could potentially take two extra seats in 
each district, although a gain of just one seat in each is 
more likely.  The Pan-Blue, for its part, is trying to hold 
onto the seats it currently has, but problems of 
overnomination and the presence of ex-KMT mavericks threaten 
to undermine their position.  End Summary. 
 
Changhua County: Shifting Toward Pan-Green? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Changhua County (pop. 1,316,321), located on Taiwan\'s 
central west coast, is represented in the LY with ten seats. 
Nineteen candidates are registered for the December 
elections, in which Changhua will likely be a key 
battleground in the struggle for control of the LY. 
Historically the district has solidly been Pan-Blue 
territory: in the 2001 LY election, they took 54 percent of 
the vote, while the Pan-Green mustered only 38 percent. 
However, in the March presidential elections, the Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) won in Changhua by 4.5 percent. 
Encouraged by this shift, the Pan-Green have nominated six 
candidates in the hopes of winning a majority in Changhua for 
the first time.  The Pan-Blue, confident in their traditional 
control of the county, have aggressively nominated seven 
candidates. 
 
DPP: A Team Campaign 
-------------------- 
 
3. (C) DPP Changhua County Chairman Liang Tseng-hsiang 
expressed optimism about his party\'s chances this year.  The 
DPP has nominated all four of its incumbents -- Charles 
Chiang (Chao-yi), Chiu Chuang-chin, Chou Ching-yu, and Wei 
Ming-ku -- for reelection and hopes to gain a seat with the 
nomination of Ke Jin-te.  Ke is a protege of the County 
Magistrate Weng Chin-chu and a member of the moderate New 
Tide faction of the DPP.  Liang said that the party plans to 
use the same \"joint campaign\" strategy that the DPP is using 
elsewhere, hoping that a team approach and an emphasis on the 
importance of taking a majority in the LY will result in an 
even distribution of votes among the candidates.  When asked 
about the possible use of a \"peipiao\" vote-distribution 
scheme, he said it was too early to discuss, noting that 
incumbent lawmaker Charles Chiang is opposed to it.  Peipiao 
schemes generally assume that each candidate will have a core 
group of supporters who will vote for him regardless of the 
party\'s instructions.  The more obedient party supporters are 
then divided among all candidates to ensure that each gets 
enough votes to win election.  Chiang reportedly believes 
that most of his supporters would be more loyal to the party 
than to him, and that much his support would therefore 
evaporate if a peipiao system were implemented.  Liang said 
he was not so worried about the incumbents\' chances, noting 
that they had been elected in 2001 when the DPP garnered just 
under 30 percent of the vote.  This time, he estimated, the 
DPP should have no problem taking at least 40 percent, which 
would be more than sufficient to elect four or even five 
candidates.  (Note: Under Taiwan\'s single non-transferable 
vote election system, winning candidates are often elected 
with as little as five percent of the vote in a ten seat 
district like Changhua.  See Reftel A.  End Note.)  He added 
that Chen Shui-bian, who won the presidential election in 
March with over 52 percent of the vote in Changhua, will 
\"without a doubt\" come out and stump for all five candidates. 
 
KMT: Cultivating Local Connections 
---------------------------------- 
4. (C) KMT Changhua County Chairman Hsu Fu-ming said the 
DPP\'s performance in the March presidential election does not 
worry him.  Local connections and image, he said, determine 
the outcome of LY elections more than party affiliation.  Hsu 
noted that all five of the KMT nominees have long cultivated 
strong grassroots support and connections in the local 
townships and villages in Changhua County.  For example, 
incumbent lawmaker Chen Chieh, who is running for reelection, 
is the brother of the mayor of Changhua City.  Chen 
Hsiu-ching, another KMT nominee, is the wife of Lin Jin-chun, 
a KMT legislator who will step down at the end of this term. 
Each of the other KMT nominees (incumbent Cho Po-yuan and 
newcomers Chen Chung-ming and Lin Chang-ming) has a local 
base of support, he said.  The KMT\'s strategy, Hsu explained, 
is to assign each candidate an exclusive region where they 
can build a base and allow them to pick up additional votes 
by campaigning in open districts.  Hsu said that he was 
confident that with this candidate-oriented campaign and the 
organized support of local campaign offices, all five 
candidates will \"definitely\" reach the 40,000 vote threshold 
needed to get elected. 
 
PFP: A Nomination Blunder? 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Despite taking only one seat in the previous election, 
the People First Party (PFP) has nominated two candidates 
this year.  PFP Changhua Chairman Hung Pen-chiao admitted 
that newcomer Chen Chao-jung\'s chances for election are not 
as good as the incumbent Hsieh Chang-chieh, who \"is much more 
organized and has a lot of local support\".  Hung was unable 
to articulate a coherent strategy for the election of the 
PFP\'s two candidates, and instead responded to AIT\'s 
questions with a litany of complaints ranging from the 
injustice of the last presidential election to the larger 
parties\' unfair vote-buying practices.  Without vote-buying, 
he claimed, the PFP\'s two candidates would certainly be 
elected. 
 
TSU: Lost in the Crowd 
 
SIPDIS 
---------------------- 
 
6. (C) The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) took eight percent 
of the vote in the previous election, enough for one seat, 
but because their vote was split between two candidates, the 
seat instead went to an independent, Chen Chin-ting, who is 
not running for reelection.  This year, the TSU decided to 
nominate only one candidate, Chen Yang-te, the less popular 
of the two nominees from 2001.  Chen\'s lack of 
name-recognition will be a significant challenge in the 
uphill fight to distinguish himself from the six other 
relatively unknown candidates running without major party 
support.  Chen Jing-ting, who has the Nonpartisan Solidarity 
Union (NSU) nomination and independent Huang Wen-ling, the 
daughter of former Central Election Commissioner George 
Huang, stand out as his most likely competitors, according to 
DPP Chairman Liang.  However, most observers think that the 
chances of the TSU or independent candidates winning election 
this year are all exceedingly slim. 
 
Taichung City: Solid Blue Territory? 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (U) Just north of Changhua County is Taichung City (pop. 
1,114,080), Taiwan\'s third largest metropolitan district, 
which will have eight LY seats.  This is one seat more than 
it currently has, a reflection of the city\'s growing 
population.  Taichung is also considered a long-time Pan-Blue 
stronghold.  In the 2001 LY election, the Pan-Blue took 52 
percent of the vote and four seats, while the Pan-Green took 
42 percent and the remaining three seats.  In the 2004 
presidential election, the city remained Blue territory, 
voting for KMT nominee Lien Chan by a five percent margin. 
Six of Taichung\'s seven incumbents are running for reelection 
this year, but the additional seat this year has energized a 
large number of new candidates (including a popular former 
Mayor) to try for election. 
 
Pan-Green: New Seat Might Tip the Balance 
----------------------------------------- 
8. (C) The Pan-Green has nominated all of its incumbents (Lee 
Ming-hsien and Hsieh Ming-yuan of the DPP and Ho Min-hao of 
the TSU) as well as a DPP newcomer, Wang Shih-shun of the 
moderate New Tide faction, in the hopes of claiming 
Taichung\'s new seat.  DPP Taichung City Chairman Chen Da-jun 
acknowledged that Taichung has traditionally been a Pan-Blue 
stronghold, but he said he is confident that the DPP\'s 
organized \"joint campaign\" strategy and a successful peipiao 
system will help all three DPP candidates win election. 
Everybody AIT spoke with agreed that TSU candidate Ho\'s seat 
was safe because of his incumbent status and his strong 
family connections. 
 
Pan-Blue: On the Defensive 
-------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The Pan-Blue nominated more conservatively, hoping 
only to hold onto the territory they already have.  Newcomer 
Tsai Jin-lung will join popular incumbent Lu Hsiu-yen in 
 
SIPDIS 
running under the KMT banner.  The other KMT incumbent, Hung 
Chao-nan, decided to step down after nine terms as a 
legislator to make room for a younger generation, explained 
KMT Taichung City Chairman Mu Kuei-hsin.  Mu said that rising 
Taiwanese identity will likely erode the Pan-Blue\'s ten 
percent lead from the last LY election, but he was still 
confident they will hold onto four seats.  The KMT\'s support 
level is high enough that it only needs to make sure to split 
the vote evenly between its two candidates to ensure their 
victory, he explained, so their strategy is simply to ask 
supporters to pair off and \"cast one vote for Lu and one for 
Tsai.\" 
 
SIPDIS 
 
10. (C) The PFP nominated both of its incumbents, Daniel 
Hwang (Yih-jiau) and Shen Chih-hui.  Hwang enjoys better 
name-recognition, but Shen\'s position is safer, said PFP 
Taichung City Chairman Lin Ping-yuan.  \"In Taichung,\" he 
explained, \"service counts for more than popularity.\"  As 
James Soong\'s spokesman, Huang has spent most of his time in 
Taipei, while Shen has taken time to provide services to her 
voters.  Taichung Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chih agreed, saying 
that Shen\'s record of constituent service would ensure her 
reelection despite her notorious role in leading a crowd of 
demonstrators in an attempt to storm the High Court on the 
evening of March 20 in protest of the presidential election. 
With Shen\'s seat safe, Lin said his campaign is focused more 
on helping Huang win reelection.  However not all of Shen\'s 
voters, apparently, are so satisfied with her service record. 
 On October 29, Shen was stabbed by a disgruntled constituent 
allegedly upset with her for failing to help him recover 
money lost in a scam.  According to newspapers, her injuries 
were not serious and she is doing fine. 
 
Independents, Mavericks, and the Former Mayor 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) The addition of a new seat in Taichung has tempted 
many independent candidates into joining the fray.  No fewer 
than eight candidates registered as independents by the 
October 12 deadline.  In addition to these, Lin Pei-le 
registered with the Nonpartisan Solidarity Union (NSU) after 
failing in the KMT primary.  New Party member Chen Su-wan 
will run under the KMT banner, although his campaign is not 
otherwise receiving support from the KMT.  (Note: This 
reflects an agreement reached when the New Party agreed to 
dissolve and have its members rejoin the KMT.  End Note.) 
Most observers agree that these independents and mavericks 
have little chance for election, although Lin and Chen might 
siphon off some of the KMT\'s support.  The one exception, 
however, is former Taichung Mayor Chang Wen-ying, who enjoys 
high name-recognition and will likely end up squeezing out 
the weakest of the major party candidates.  Although she left 
the DPP in 2001 and has registered for this election as an 
independent, her husband is the former DPP Taichung City 
Chairman, and she generally favors Pan-Green positions. 
 
Comment: DPP Storming the Walls 
------------------------------- 
 
12. (C) It appears the DPP has spotted cracks in the 
fortifications of traditional Pan-Blue strongholds Changhua 
County and Taichung City, and has gone on the attack.  In 
both districts it has renominated all its incumbents and 
added a strong New Tide moderate in the hopes of claiming an 
extra seat in each.  As we have seen in other districts, the 
DPP strategy is to run all their candidates as a team to 
ensure they are equally familiar to voters, while they keep a 
peipiao scheme in reserve in case it looks like the votes 
will not be distributed evenly.  This sophisticated national 
strategy starkly contrasts with the lack of coordination and 
discipline on the Pan-Blue side.  Pan-Blue candidates 
generally run independent campaigns centered on their \"home 
turf,\" which can result in lopsided vote distribution and, if 
the party has overnominated, bitter infighting.  Although the 
Pan-Blue nominations in Changhua County and Taichung City 
were more disciplined than in neighboring Yunlin County 
(Reftel B), the presence of several ex-KMT mavericks in 
Taichung and the PFP\'s inexplicable decision to nominate two 
candidates in Changhua could spell trouble. 
 
13. (C) In Changhua, all the incumbents are widely expected 
safely to win reelection.  In addition, the KMT should have 
no trouble getting at least one of its newcomers elected. 
This gives both camps four seats.  The DPP\'s Ke, the TSU\'s 
Chen, and one of the remaining KMT candidates will compete 
for the remaining two seats.  This means Changhua is likely 
to split 5-5 (giving the Pan-Green an extra seat in the LY), 
or possibly 6-4 if the Pan-Green side campaigns particularly 
well.  The Pan-Green will probably also gain ground in 
Taichung.  There too, the six incumbents (2 DPP, 1 TSU, 1 
KMT, 2 PFP) are all expected to win.  The remaining two seats 
will be contested by the DPP\'s Wang, the KMT\'s Tsai, and the 
pro-DPP former Mayor Chang.  Again, the most likely outcome 
will be a 4-4 split (meaning an extra seat for Pan-Green) 
with a distinct possibility that the city will go 5-3 in 
favor of the Pan-Green.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: Taiwan,s Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) 
officials relayed to AIT on November 1 new information that 
shows the Ching Hwee Company (which we discussed earlier with 
Taiwan, see ref B) has played a dominant role in Taiwan\'s 
machinery exports to North Korea.  BOFT investigations (per 
ref C request) into the Royal Richard Company revealed little 
trading activity, and no imports from China or exports to 
North Korea.  AIT notified BOFT the U.S. will not provide 
EXBS training November 2-5.  End summary. 
 
Restricted Customs Data Gives Insights 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) BOFT Import-Export Administration Director Peter Ho 
provided AIT with restricted Taiwan Customs data from 2001 
through May of this year on all imports and exports of the 
Ching Hwee Trading Company, a Taiwan company known to export 
sophisticated machine tools to North Korea.  The data makes 
it clear that Ching Hwee has negligible imports.  Over half 
of all Ching Hwee exports, by value, go to North Korea.  Its 
exports to North Korea in the first five months of 2004 
totaled USD 666,468, accounting for 65 percent of its total 
export sales.  Over 95 percent of Ching Hwee\'s exports to 
North Korea are machine tools. In some machine tool tariff 
categories, Ching Hwee accounts for 100 percent of Taiwan,s 
exports to North Korea, and in some other tariff categories 
it accounts for the majority of Taiwan,s exports to North 
Korea by value.  In 2002, for example, Ching Hwee alone 
accounted for all of Taiwan\'s exports to North Korea of 
machining centers, numerically controlled lathes, and 
numerically controlled shearing machines.  Ching Hwee also 
exports to Australia, China, Iran, Jordan, Pakistan, 
Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam. 
 
3.  (C) Director Ho said the owners of Ching Hwee denied 
having any joint venture with the Ryonha Machinery J/V 
Corporation of North Korea, as reported in ref A talking 
points.  The owners told BOFT that they believed Ryonha had a 
joint venture with a Japanese company.  Most of the machine 
tools sold by Ching Hwee use Mitsubishi computer numerical 
controller (CNC) panels.  BOFT has determined that Ching Hwee 
is only a trading company that does not actually produce any 
of the products it trades (ref B).  As part of its 
investigation into machine tool exports to North Korea, BOFT 
has identified five local companies that manufacture the 
machine tools exported by Ching Hwee, and it is looking into 
the nature of the relation between Ching Hwee and these five 
manufacturers to see if there are any common owners or other 
significant links.  Ching Hwee told BOFT that contrary to the 
usual practice in machine tool sales, it does not provide any 
warranty or after sales service to the machines it sells to 
North Korea. 
 
AIT, BOFT and Taiwan Customs Visit Machine Tool Factories 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
4.  (C) BOFT has recently begun organizing export control 
training for Taiwan Customs officials.  Two AIT 
representatives joined a training tour of machine tool 
factories in central Taiwan (reported septel).  The factories 
that the Customs officials visited on this training tour were 
not suspected of any illegal activity, but were requested to 
provide basic information on how to identify high performance 
machine tools.  The factory executives emphasized the 
importance of software and the CNC panel as decisive in 
determining the capabilities of any machine tool.  They also 
noted that warranty and after-sales service, including 
periodic software updates, were normally key considerations 
in machine tool sales. 
 
Ho Notes that Critical Parts Not of Taiwan Origin 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5.  (C) While discussing the lessons learned from the joint 
AIT/BOFT/Customs training tour, Director Ho noted that Taiwan 
did not manufacture any sophisticated CNC panels; rather, it 
invariably imported these components from Japan and Germany. 
Before these products can be exported to Taiwan from Japan or 
Germany, high-tech CNC panels must have export licenses and 
end-user verifications issued by the country of origin. 
Director Ho said it was unclear whether imported high-tech 
CNC panels were already installed on the machine tools that 
Ching Hwee had exported to North Korea.  He agreed with the 
AIT suggestion that this issue should be investigated 
further.  Ho said the Taiwan Industrial Research Institute 
(ITRI) is currently assisting BOFT in determining if past 
Ching Hwee exports included controlled items.  In the cases 
researched so far by ITRI, the item descriptions provided by 
Ching Hwee indicated that a less sophisticated type of 
control was shipped with the machine tools sent to North 
Korea. 
 
Royal Richard Not a Major Trading Company 
----------------------------------------- 
6. (C) BOFT reported that in response to ref C demarche, it 
had investigated the Royal Richard Taiwan Company Limited and 
found that it has made only two international transactions in 
2004.  According to Taiwan Customs data, in May, Royal 
Richard imported a single item from South Korea valued at USD 
180 and in August, it exported a single item to Ghana worth 
USD 411.  The value of these items did not meet the threshold 
for recording the item description in regular reports, but 
BOFT is currently seeking additional information.  Director 
Ho clarified that while Taiwan has a law against brokering 
military-use items, and has pending legislation covering the 
transfer of sensitive technologies, it does not have any law 
against brokering dual-use chemicals if the item never 
transits Taiwan.  He pointed out that in this case, it was 
the responsibility of the PRC law enforcement agencies to 
enforce their laws against exporting the chemical to North 
Korea.  Director Ho also indicated that Taiwan has provisions 
for maintaining export controls even for items transiting 
through free trade zones. 
 
7. (C) Comment: That BOFT has provided us with restricted 
Customs data shows again a willingness to go beyond the 
letter of the law in cooperating on export controls.  That 
BOFT would on its own organize export training for Taiwan 
Customs shows initiative.  BOFT seemed to take in stride our 
notification that the EXBS training will not be held November 
2-5.  End comment.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S. ELECTIONS AND U.S. 
POLICY, SECRETARY POWELL\'S REMARKS IN BEIJING 
 
 
1. U.S. Elections and U.S. Policy 
 
A) \"Bush Gets Re-elected with a Narrow Margin, But the 
Price He Pays Is the United States\' Unity and 
Democratic Image\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
commented in an editorial (11/4): 
 
\"Over the past four years, [U.S. President George W.] 
Bush has lost the United States\' glory and the world\'s 
respect for [his country].  Domestically, it is even 
more difficult to calculate what Bush has lost for his 
country.  The campaign strategy that Bush adopted this 
time was to renounce the middle road that the United 
States used to pursue.  As a result, he has incited 
voters that believe in different values to confront 
each other and left the society no room for tolerance. 
That is why some people described this U.S. election as 
a `domestic war.\'  The Bush administration\'s use of a 
drastic manipulative approach in an attempt to win the 
majority of votes also means that he has given up the 
hope to win the hearts of the other half of American 
voters.  Such an unorthodox approach shows that Bush 
lacks the open-minded bearing and vision that a state 
leader requires.  Even though he succeeded by 
manipulating the anti-terrorism issue and employing a 
negative campaign strategy against his opponent, he 
could hardly convince his rival and the rival\'s 
supporters. . 
 
\"In fact, Bush\'s re-election may not necessarily 
benefit Taiwan\'s political reality.  Let\'s not forget 
the strong-worded statements made by U.S. Secretary of 
State Colin Powell during his trip to East Asia just a 
few days before the general elections.  Powell\'s 
remarks, including his call for cross-Strait dialogue 
and [the United States\'] lack of support for Taiwan 
independence, should be the new bottom line of the Bush 
administration.  It is really difficult to imagine that 
Bush, if re-elected, will continue to insist on facing 
the world with his `unilateralism.\'  If Bush has even 
the slightest intention to heal the hurt, his cross- 
Strait policy will not possibly continue to stay 
severe.  If so, then the `Powell framework\' will then 
likely become a blueprint for Bush to deal with the 
cross-Strait situation in the future. .\" 
 
B) \"A Divided United States Is Bush\'s Biggest Challenge 
after He Is Re-elected\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" observed in 
an editorial (11/4): 
 
\". Over the past three years, the political division 
and the confrontations in public views created by Bush 
in the United States have been more serious than those 
during the Vietnam War.  This presidential campaign has 
also further ignited the different sentiments of 
`support for Bush\' and `opposition to Bush.\' . 
 
\"We want to say objectively that even though Bush has 
won a majority of the votes, it is because [Senator 
John] Kerry had the cardinal principles in mind and 
took the overall situation and the unity of the United 
States into account so that the election could end 
smoothly.  As a re-elected president, Bush must observe 
and understand the expectations of [U.S.] society and 
the international community, serving as a `unifier,\' 
and seeking to win the support of the other half of 
American voters who did not vote for him during this 
election.  This is where his heavenly mandate and 
challenge lies.\" 
 
C) \"Bush\'s Re-election and Prospects for U.S.-Taiwan 
Relations\" 
 
Washington correspondent James Wang said in the 
\"Washington Reviews\" column of the pro-independence 
\"Taiwan Daily\" (11/4): 
 
\". We anticipate that the Bush administration will 
continue putting emphasis on Taiwan\'s security issues. 
Taiwan\'s strategic status weighs heavily in the Bush 
administration\'s strategic perception, and the United 
States will not overlook China\'s threats against 
Taiwan. 
 
\"We also anticipate that the Bush administration will 
maintain an impartial attitude when urging Taiwan and 
China to engage in a dialogue to alleviate cross-Strait 
tensions, but it will not force Taiwan to compromise 
and accept China\'s position. . 
 
\"The general position and wishes of the Taiwan people 
are that we insist that Taiwan is an independent 
sovereign state and we hope that the United States 
could accommodate Taiwan\'s democratic evolvement and 
recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation.  The United 
States, as a model for democracy, should clearly 
understand [the Taiwan people\'s position]. 
 
D) \"Bush\'s Re-election Is the General Trend\" 
 
Washington correspondent Norman Fu said in the 
\"Washington Outlook\" column of the centrist, pro-status 
quo \"China Times\" (11/4): 
 
\"In general, Bush\'s re-election might not necessarily 
be favorable for the entire world situation.  Bin 
Laden\'s terrorism and chaos in Iraq will continue and 
will grow more severe.  Chances are smaller that the 
United States and EU nations will reconcile.  The 
conservative powers inside the United States will 
become consolidated all the more and confrontations 
between the Republicans and Democrats will grow 
stronger.  Bush\'s `unilateralist\' superpower diplomacy 
will likely move toward the direction in that `those 
who submit will thrive and those who resist shall meet 
ruin.\'  For Taiwan, which needs the United States\' help 
for almost everything, how can it dare to offend the 
United States by doing whatever it wants?\" 
 
E) \"US, Taiwan Are Democratic Partners\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
editorialized (11/4): 
 
\". As an ally of the US., Taiwan is surely interested 
in the re-election of Bush.  We are not concerned about 
the possibility of the Bush administration shifting its 
Taiwan policy.  After all, the US is already a mature 
democracy.  Taiwan-US relations have steadily developed 
on the basis on a long-term friendship.  Although there 
were some ups and downs in the past, Taiwan-US 
relations are unlikely to alter unless a drastic change 
takes place across the Taiwan Strait. 
 
\"We are concerned about the election because Taiwan-US 
relations are complex.  We hope that post-election 
legal squabbling will not damage the image of US 
democracy.  An incident-free outcome will help Taiwan 
and the US continue to boost their bilateral exchanges. 
Taipei needs to get on with talking to Washington about 
the proposed arms procurement plan, as well as our 
efforts to enter the World Health Organization and 
other international bodies. .\" 
 
F) \"U.S. Needs Reform, Lien Chan Must Go\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taiwan News\" 
said in an editorial (11/4): 
 
\". Four more years of George W. Bush are likely to be 
four more years of a festering morass in Iraq, 
explosive tensions in the Middle East and a `head in 
the sand\' (or rather, prayer book) attitude to efforts 
by the world community to resolve critical global ills 
through multilateral efforts from the Kyoto Protocol on 
global warming to the International Criminal Court. 
 
\"Global cooperation may well be affected by the clash 
between a highly conservative Republican regime in the 
U.S. with the surfacing trend for `center-left\' 
governments in Europe, Latin American [sic] and much of 
Asia. 
 
\"The continuation of a Republican administration may 
also not be as positive for Taiwan as some pundits seem 
to expect. 
 
\"The continuity of leadership in the U.S. and Taiwan 
along with the consolidation of the power of People\'s 
Republic of China State Chairman Hu Jintao may boost 
prospects for dialogue as Washington is likely to take 
a proactive role in brokering such talks at the same 
time as supplying Taiwan with defensive weaponry. 
 
\"But the flip side will include pressure on Taiwan\'s 
Democratic Progressive Party government and the 
Taiwanese people to refrain from any action that might 
`provoke\' Beijing, including affirming our sovereignty 
or revamping our Constitution. 
\"Demands for more assistance in campaigns against 
`terrorism\' and the Iraqi quagmire are also likely to 
be voiced by Washington in step with the declining 
degree of tolerance by other members of the world 
community for the Bushian `crusades.\' 
 
\"Gaps in priorities are likely to emerge between the 
U.S. `faith-based\' government and the DPP government, 
which is trying to traverse a `Taiwan road\' of 
democracy, human rights, and sustainability. .\" 
 
G) \"The U.S. Won\'t Tolerate Taiwan Independence\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" noted in an editorial (11/4): 
 
\". It is true that the Republicans are traditionally 
more supportive of Taiwan.  But this hardly justifies 
the conclusion that, when the U.S. president is a 
member of the Grand Old Party, Taiwan will be safer 
from a mainland Chinese attack. 
 
\"Recently U.S. Secret [sic] of State Colin Powell, 
during a visit to Asia, said Taiwan does not enjoy 
sovereignty as a nation, and stated that 
`reunification\' with mainland China must be achieved by 
peaceful means.  The remarks have dealt the Taiwan 
independence movement a crushing blow.  Those who 
pursue Taiwan independence must not have the 
misconception that Taiwan can always count on America 
to come to its aid in the face of an attack from 
mainland China.  Should the Taipei government go too 
far in its attempt to make the island an independent 
state, the U.S. will certainly intervene, whoever its 
president is.\" 
 
2. Secretary Powell\'s Remarks in Beijing 
 
Hsu Yung-ming, assistant research fellow at the 
Academia Sinica, said in the pro-independence, English- 
language \"Taipei Times\" (11/4): 
 
\". Powell\'s words have completely changed the myth 
about Taiwan\'s democratic development.  We finally 
understand that enjoying democracy does not equal 
enjoying sovereignty as a nation, and supporting Taiwan 
to boost democracy is not supporting the Taiwanese 
people to become their own masters.  Thus, the way 
Washington treats Taipei is no better than the way 
Beijing treats Hong Kong. . 
 
\"The Taiwanese people think that they are becoming 
their own masters when striving for democracy.  But 
from a US perspective, it is just an improvement of 
human welfare.  The Taiwanese people think that they 
are deepening democracy and resolving a political 
deadlock through the push for referendums.  But from a 
US perspective, it is a push for Taiwan independence. 
Obviously, under this US patriarchy, Washington\'s views 
Taipei as a democratic offspring that needs its special 
care.  But the former also locks the latter in a 
birdcage, so that it will not fly away and cause 
trouble. 
 
\"Viewed from this perspective, perhaps it is better for 
Taiwan and China to resume their talks.  At least, 
Taiwan will have a chance to speak for itself without 
US pressure.  It must take the initiative, rather than 
depending on the US forever.  The Democratic 
Progressive Party government should make the public 
aware of the gap between Taiwan\'s democracy and 
sovereignty, and both the blue and green camps should 
clarify their stances on the issue.  Apart from the 
Taiwanese people\'s pro-unification and pro-independence 
sentiments, the key lies in the fact that there is no 
longer a gray area.  Taiwan cannot now enjoy both 
democracy and sovereignty - just democracy without 
sovereignty. .\"

E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/2013 
TAGS: PGOV, TW 
SUBJECT: HIGH COURT DISMISSES MARCH 20 ELECTION CASE 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Deputy Director David J. Keegan, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The Taiwan High Court rejected a case filed 
by opposition leaders Lien Chan and James Soong to overturn 
the March 20 election.  The court announced that the 
opposition failed to support its claims that President Chen 
Shui-bian won the election through illegal means.  Opposition 
lawyers immediately announced their intention to appeal the 
ruling and expressed confidence that a separate case 
challenging the conduct of the election would result in a 
more favorable verdict.  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) 
officials urged Lien to follow the example set by Senator 
John Kerry and gracefully accept defeat.  Instead, KMT 
Chairman Lien Chan declared that the court\'s ruling marked 
the \"darkest day in the history of Taiwan\'s judiciary.\"  On 
the eve of the verdict, Lien offered the inflammatory 
suggestion to the KMT\'s Central Standing Committee (CSC) that 
Chen be subject to assassination as an illegitimate leader. 
The November 4 decision did not come as a surprise to either 
camp.  However, observers on both sides believe the 
Pan-Blue\'s apparent rejection of the legal process may 
alienate moderate voters in the December 11 election.  End 
Summary. 
 
Verdict In: Lien is a Loser 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Taiwan High Court on November 4 rejected a civil 
suit brought by the Lien-Soong campaign over the results of 
the March 20 presidential election.  The Pan-Blue alleged 
that Chen\'s victory was illegitimate because of voting 
irregularities and the alleged concoction of the March 19 
shooting of Chen and Vice President Annette Lu.  A High Court 
spokesman held a press conference after the announcement to 
explain the court\'s rulings on each part of the Pan-Blue\'s 
case.  The spokesman noted that the court\'s full recount of 
the March 20 ballots changed the election results by only 
4,000 votes (reducing Chen\'s margin of victory from 29,518 
votes to 25,563 votes).  The court also found that the 
plaintiffs failed to prove their allegations that the March 
19 shooting incident was staged, that the decision to hold 
the referendum on the same day as the election skewed the 
results, or that military and police personnel were deprived 
of their right to vote due to the shooting incident.  As the 
losers in the case, the Pan-Blue was ordered to pay nearly 
NTD 17 million (USD500,000) in court fees.  Lawyers 
representing the Pan-Blue leaders announced plans to appeal 
the decision immediately after the verdict was announced. 
 
3. (C) KMT Chairman Lien rejected the court\'s verdict, 
declaring November 4 the \"darkest day in the history of 
Taiwan\'s judiciary.\"  Lien asserted that it was not the 
Pan-Blue\'s responsibility to provide proof to back its 
allegations, but rather the court\'s duty to thoroughly 
investigate them.  In the days leading up to the court 
decision, the Pan-Blue camp placed ads in major papers 
denouncing the legal process and accusing the DPP government 
of manipulating the courts.  At a November 3 KMT CSC meeting 
with open press, Lien sparked controversy by using an ancient 
Chinese phrase (\"renren zhizhu\") to suggest that the 
president should be assassinated if the court ruled in Chen\'s 
favor.  A proposal by Lien that the KMT mobilize supporters 
to surround the courthouse before the verdict was announced 
was reportedly rejected by party vice chairmen Wang Jin-pyng 
and Ma Ying-jeou.  Nevertheless, several hundred Pan-Blue 
supporters along with a handful of Pan-Blue Legislative Yuan 
(LY) candidates gathered in front of the court to protest the 
verdict.  Some protesters threw eggs at riot police. 
 
4. (C) Despite their combative public stance, Pan-Blue 
officials privately say they did not expect the court to find 
in its favor.  People First Party (PFP) Deputy Policy Chief 
Lee Yun-jie told AIT on the eve of the court decision that 
there was zero expectation the case would go for Lien and 
Soong.  \"This isn\'t a matter of political interference in the 
judiciary,\" he stated, \"it is simply that no judge in Taiwan 
would consider overturning a major election, even if there 
was clear proof of fraud.\"  KMT Policy Chief Tseng 
Yung-chuan, a Lien loyalist, told AIT weeks before the 
verdict that the Pan-Blue camp had largely written off the 
challenge to the election results, but still held out hope 
that a separate court case filed against the Central Election 
Commission (CEC) over the voting process might produce a more 
positive result. 
 
DPP Response: The Kerry Model 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Presidential Office Secretary General Su Tseng-chang 
publicly urged Lien and Soong to look to Senator John Kerry\'s 
statesman-like concession speech on November 3 as a model for 
resolving the divisions that have existed within Taiwan since 
the March 20 election.  Presidential Office Secretary Liu 
Shih-chung told AIT that the DPP would use Kerry\'s concession 
speech as a core theme in its campaign for the December 11 LY 
election.  \"The timing of Kerry\'s graceful concession speech 
juxtaposed with Lien\'s threat against the president could not 
have been better from our perspective,\" Liu remarked. 
 
Pan-Blue Reaction: Strike Two 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The court decision was not unexpected, but Lien Chan\'s 
statements in the lead-up to the ruling have handed the DPP 
yet another free PR victory.  For weeks, Pan-Blue moderates 
have expressed fears that an emotional, provocative reaction 
by Lien or Soong to the court ruling would further alienate 
centrist voters in December.  What is more troubling than 
Lien\'s outburst is silence on the part of the two contenders 
for future KMT leadership, Ma Ying-jeou and Wang Jin-pyng. 
The KMT\'s immediate response after the verdict was announced 
was less provocative than its earlier public statements, but 
Lien\'s November 3 apparent threat against the president has 
already set back the KMT\'s efforts to portray itself as a 
responsible, moderate voice of opposition.

SUBJECT: TAIWAN MINISTER OF FINANCE ON GOVERNMENT DEFICIT 
 
REF: TAIPEI 3444 
 
 1.  (SBU) Summary:  Finance Minister Lin Chuan discussed 
financial reform, taxation, and public finance during a 
courtesy call by AIT/T/DDIR Keegan and EAP/TC/DD Levy on 
October 28.  Lin said that the government budget deficit was 
the most time-consuming of his responsibilities.  He asked if 
there were opportunities for Taiwan tax officials to 
participate in training or exchange programs with U.S. tax 
officials (action request para 11.)  End summary. 
 
Budget Deficit the Biggest Worry 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) During a &familiarization8 call by AIT Deputy 
Director Keegan and EAP/TC Deputy Director Levy, Taiwan 
Finance Minister Lin Chuan said that the central government 
budget deficit was a constant worry.  Lin noted that 
Taiwan,s central government had suffered budget deficits 
since the early 1990,s for various reasons, including the 
relocation of labor-intensive industries offshore and 
economic recession in 2001.  The integration of corporate and 
personal income tax into a single return in the late the 
1990s resulted in significant losses of tax revenue.  Lin 
observed that since President Chen was elected in 2000, the 
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan (LY) set numerous 
restrictions to prevent the planned sales of equity shares in 
state-owned companies*- a major source of revenue for 
previous administrations. 
 
Tax Reform Key, But Difficult 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Lin said that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) hopes 
tax reform can help address the budget deficit issue, but 
reaching consensus among government agencies and legislators 
on tax issues was difficult. 
 
Local Government Funding 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) Minister Lin noted that many of Taiwan,s local 
governments are also having fiscal problems.  Taiwan,s local 
governments are popularly elected, and have authority to 
spend, but lack authority to impose taxes and must rely on 
funds from the central government.  Competition for funds 
between Taipei City and other municipalities in Taiwan has 
become more intense.  The MOF has developed a more 
transparent and equitable formula to allocate central 
government funds, but has assured Taipei City that its 
funding will not decrease. 
 
Financial Reforms Can Also Reduce the Deficit 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Minister Lin thought the budget deficit could also 
be remedied by continuing the financial reforms already 
underway and developing service sector industries, 
particularly financial services, to replace lost 
manufacturing jobs and tax revenues.  Lin hoped that along 
with expansion of the financial sector would come a more 
sophisticated approach to taxation and a better understanding 
of new financial products.  However, he noted that primary 
responsibility for financial reform had shifted from the MOF 
to the new Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) that was 
established in July.  (Note: The FSC was established to 
consolidate regulatory control of banking, insurance, and 
securities products from the three agencies previously 
responsibile for these areas.  A single regulatory agency was 
supposed to provide better supervision and better risk 
management, and be more in line with international trends. 
End note.) 
 
First Phase of Financial Reform Complete 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Minister Lin said that when reforms started in 
2001, increased transparency in the banking sector brought 
hidden problems to light.  In 2002 the average non-performing 
loan (NPL) ratio shot up above 11% (using the internationally 
accepted definition of NPLs-- i.e., loans with principle or 
interest payments more than three months overdue. Up to now, 
Taiwan has only treated loans six months overdue as 
non-performning.)  To address this problem, Taiwan required 
that banks write off bad debts or sell problem assets.  He 
said that under the first-stage financial reform, the NPL 
ratio had dropped to below 5%. 
 
7.  (SBU) Minister Lin noted that the MOF had also built a 
mechanism for problem banks to retreat from the market.  The 
Financial Reconstruction Fund (FRF), similar to the U.S. 
Resolution Trust Corporation, was funded with NT$140 billion 
to resolve bad bank debt.  However, the fund was almost 
exhausted by the problems of small community financial 
institutions (farmers and fishermen credit coops) and the 
sale earlier this year of the Kaohsiung Business Bank. 
Minister Lin believed the MOF had gained much valuable 
experience dealing with closing banks that would benefit the 
FSC in managing the sale of other problem banks. 
 
Foreign Investors Uninterested in Chung Shing Bank 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8.  (SBU) Taiwan will auction off the Chung Shing Bank (CSB) 
and its 34 branches, now in receivership, on December 9 as 
part of on-going efforts to reduce the number of banks and 
improve the health of the financial sector (reftel). 
Minister Lin said that while foreign investors were permitted 
to bid, he did not think they were interested in actually 
running the bank.  He thought they were only interested in 
profiting from dismantling it.  Lin noted that the bid winner 
can reduce CSB employees substantially, but must provide a 
defined severance pay. 
 
The Next Stage of Financial Reform 
---------------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) In the next stage of financial reform, Lin said, 
the top priority is to reduce the number of financial 
institutions.  One difficulty is that many of Taiwan\'s 
private banks are family-owned and managed, and the families 
resist merging with larger banks. The MOF has developed plans 
for the merger of the less efficient state-owned banks. 
Under past privatization programs, equity shares in 
state-owned banks have been sold and, consequently, 
government ownership in many of these banks is already below 
50%.  Minister Lin said Taiwan hopes to sell 100% of 
ownership of one or two healthy state-owned banks to foreign 
investors in order to sharpen competition and pressure other 
banks to consolidate.  One good candidate for such a foreign 
sale is the banking part of the Central Trust of China (CTC). 
 With 26 branches, the CTC,s banking operations are small 
but good. 
 
Financial Policy 
------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) According to recent draft amendments to the EY 
(i.e., executive branch) Organization Statute, financial 
policy-making authority will shift from the FSC back to the 
MOF.  Minister Lin explained that earlier legislation 
strictly defined FSC as an independent agency, not subject to 
executive branch jurisdiction.  Lin believed the shift of 
policy authority to MOF is necessary for the executive branch 
to retain control of financial policy-making. 
 
Request for Information on Tax Training/Exchange 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
11.  (SBU) Minister Lin asked for information on the 
possibility of Taiwan tax officials participating in training 
or exchange programs with U.S. counterparts in order to 
improve Taiwan,s taxation technical skills.  AIT would 
appreciate information on whether there are any appropriate 
U.S. Treasury programs for training foreign tax officials.

\"Taiwan May Be Priority Issue for Bush\'s New Foreign 
Agenda\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language

\"U.S. President George W. Bush, who won a second term 
in the Tuesday poll after defeating his Democratic 
challenger Senator John Kerry with 274 Electoral 
College votes and a projected margin of 3.5 million 
national popular ballots, is very likely to set Taiwan 
as one of his major diplomatic priorities during the 
next four years of his new administration. 
 
\"The reason is simple and clear: Bush does not want 
Taiwan, an issue which has already troubled him and his 
administration during much of his first term, to 
continue to stand in the way of his effort to 
strengthen Washington\'s Beijing relations. . 
 
\"A new U.S. administration would no longer just 
passively express a position of not supporting Taiwan 
independence.  It could distinctly tell Chen that 
Washington disagrees with his claim that Taiwan is a 
sovereign country.  And that it is opposed to any moves 
by Taipei to pursue de jure independence. 
 
\"Meanwhile, any new U.S. initiative in easing tension 
in the Taiwan Strait can be expected to include in 
increased effort to bring Taipei and Beijing to the 
negotiating table.  A resumption of contacts and 
dialogue has been believed by Washington to be the best 
way to settle differences between the two sides. .\"

SUBJECT: TAIWAN RESPONSE TO TEXTILE TRANSSHIPMENT MOU 
DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 224893 
 
 1.  This is an Action Request.  Please see Para 8. 
 
2.  Summary: AIT/T delivered reftel demarche to Taiwan\'s 
Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Import/Export Director Peter Ho 
November 5.  Ho was accompanied by several staff and 
representatives from the Taiwan Textile Federation (TTF).  Ho 
protested that there was not enough time to fully consult 
with manufacturers before the end of 2004.  He had several 
concerns on the draft Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), most 
significantly the question of whether Taiwan could provide 
manufacturer (as opposed to exporter) information on the 
invoice, and whether this MOU would require Taiwan to retain 
some type of licensing requirement for textile exporters.  He 
asked that AIT/T request additional information from 
Washington agencies on these and other questions in order to 
allow him to discuss the MOU with appropriate government 
offices and private industry contacts.  The TTF 
representatives suggested that its members might be reluctant 
to support such an MOU.  End summary. 
 
3.  AIT/T shared the text of the draft MOU with BOFT November 
5 and discussed the possibility of signing such an agreement. 
 Ho began by noting that AIT and TECRO had been negotiating a 
textile transshipment agreement in 2001, but that those 
discussions had been suspended.  He protested the short time 
frame, noting that the  Agreement on Textiles and Clothing 
(ATC) is scheduled to expire January 1, 2005.  Ho objected 
that it would be very difficult to consult within the 
government and with manufacturers in time to have an 
agreement ready to be signed before January 1.  He then 
outlined several specific concerns with the draft MOU. 
 
4.  Ho noted that with the end of the Multi-fiber Arrangement 
(MFA) and the ATC, many of the U.S. laws and regulations that 
governed trade in textiles might lapse.  He requested 
information regarding new U.S. regulations governing textile 
trade after January 1, 2005.  BOFT was concerned that the MOU 
would require Taiwan to revise its regulations to mandate 
that manufacturer information be included on invoices and 
other documentation.  Currently, only export information is 
required.  Ho wondered if this kind of requirement by the 
U.S. would violate WTO principles.  Econoff reminded BOFT 
that this draft MOU was based on one that was currently being 
negotiated with Hong Kong and that voluntary regulation to 
prevent illegal transshipment would not violate WTO rules. 
 
5.  BOFT and TTF expressed concern that Taiwan manufacturers 
could react negatively to provisions allowing for joint 
visits to determine whether rules of origin were being 
circumvented.  TTF representatives advised that many 
manufacturers were eagerly looking forward to expected 
savings from reduced regulatory requirements when the MFA and 
ATC go out of force.  They would not likely be eager to 
continue devoting resources to complying with a new licensing 
or inspection regime. 
 
6.  BOFT also questioned whether all textile products would 
be covered by the proposed MOU or just those at risk of 
transshipment.  Ho asked whether Hong Kong and Macao were 
planning to continue their current licensing regime or adopt 
some other mechanism to certify textile exporters.  He also 
suggested including language from the abandoned 2000 draft 
textile transshipment MOU that would require the U.S. to 
provide prior notice when denying entry. 
 
7.  Comment: The initial reaction from BOFT to signing the 
proposed draft MOU indicates that more work needs to be done 
to educate the government and industry about the need for 
this agreement.  While BOFT is willing to consider signing an 
MOU, given the short time horizon, it is not likely that an 
agreement can be reached before the end of 2004 without a 
significant investment of resources. 
 
8.  Action Request: Please provide answers to BOFT questions 
contained in Paras 4-6 and advise whether EB/TPP/ABT and USTR 
would be willing to allow for more time to negotiate an 
agreement that could be signed early in 2005.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: NEW BUSH ADMINISTRATION; IRAQ 
 
A) \"To Face the Growing Conservative Atmosphere in the 
U.S. Political Arena\" 
 
The pro-status quo \"China Times\" said in an editorial 
(11/6): 
 
\". The U.S. media have pointed out that the key issue 
to the latest elections is neither the war in Iraq nor 
economic issues but `ethical values.\' 
 
\". Such Conservative thinking will certainly be 
reflected in U.S. foreign and defense policies in the 
next four years. 
 
\"After the election results were clear, President Bush 
is both domestically and internationally expected to be 
able to commit himself to `correcting the wrong\' of the 
past, as he does not have any re-election pressure 
anymore.  [People] hope that he can be a truly tolerant 
leader, who will listen to those who did not vote for 
him in the United States and respect different views of 
foreign countries about U.S. policies.  Thus, the world 
can enjoy post-Cold War peace and stability under U.S. 
leadership.  However, the executive, legislative, and 
judicial branches will all be under Republican control, 
and Bush has won so much popular support, which gives 
him a strong mandate.  As a result, in the next four 
years the whole world may have to give up unrealistic 
expectations and pragmatically face a world depicted 
under the dominance of U.S. Conservatism. 
 
B) \"Heavy Attack to Seek an End and Let U.S. Troops Go 
Home for Christmas?\" 
 
Kung Yan, an associate professor in Taipei, wrote in 
the conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
(11/8): 
 
\"Bush sent 20,000 troops to Fallujah just after he was 
re-elected.  This was also the largest-scaled action in 
Iraq since April 2003.  The world became nervous again. 
 
\"Why is Bush doing this?  We need to notice two 
reasons.  First, the anti-terror war needs an ending 
after it was started.  Second, the fighting in Iraqi 
fields must be completed as soon as possible.  The best 
is to settle it before Christmas. 
 
\". Without trying to feel and understand in depth about 
the belief and lifestyle of the Islamic world, this war 
is determined to cause high casualties.  One only wants 
to ask, when he was making policy decisions, why Bush 
did not think of using religious communications and 
dialogue to resolve disputes and seek peace?\"

REMARKS 
 
REF: TAIPEI 3409 
 
Classified By: AIT Acting Director David J. Keegan, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: During an open-press November 7 speech to a 
group of pro-independence university professors, President 
Chen Shui-bian emphasized Taiwan as a \"sovereign and 
independent country\" and asserted that Taiwan\'s current 
constitution was \"made in China, for China\" and was not 
appropriate for Taiwan.  Chen shared the stage at the event 
with former President Lee Teng-hui, who told the audience 
that Taiwan needed to elect a Pan-Green majority on December 
11 so it could change the constitution to create a \"Republic 
of Taiwan.\"  Senior aides to the president say they were 
surprised by Chen\'s comments, which they did not write, and 
they speculate that Chen was once more playing to the crowd. 
Officials assert that they will try to limit the fallout on 
cross-Strait relations by having the president offer more 
concrete gestures of goodwill in upcoming public speeches. 
However, these same officials fear that Chen will make 
further destabilizing statements while on the Legislative 
Yuan (LY) campaign trail in the lead up to the December 11 
election.  The formulations floated by Chen on November 7 are 
likely to further increase suspicions in Beijing that Chen is 
pursuing a hidden independence agenda in concert with Lee 
Teng-hui.  End Summary. 
 
Chen Falls Off the Wagon 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) President Chen Shui-bian emphasized Taiwan\'s 
sovereignty during a November 7 speech to the 
pro-independence Taiwan Association of University Professors. 
 Chen asserted that \"we have 23 million people, a territory, 
a government, an army... if you say this is not a sovereign, 
independent country, what is it?  Taiwan is a country, Taiwan 
is a beautiful country, Taiwan is an advanced country, Taiwan 
is a great country.\"  To drive home the point, Chen added 
that \"Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country and no 
person or country can deny this fact.\"  Chen bemoaned, 
however, that Taiwan\'s 23 million people could not enjoy 100 
percent sovereignty because of unique historical factors and 
\"China\'s unfeeling suppression.\" 
 
3. (C) Chen went on to criticize the \"Republic of China 
Constitution currently in use in Taiwan.\"  He stated that 
this constitution was not established \"in Taiwan or for 
Taiwan,\" but rather was \"established in China and for China.\" 
 For this reason, Chen pledged to complete a \"major reform of 
the constitutional system\" (wancheng xianzheng da gaige) to 
produce a \"New Taiwan Constitution\" (Xin Taiwan Xianfa). 
Much of the rest of his speech was devoted to criticizing 
\"those people\" in Taiwan who have spent the past four years 
trying to undermine the Chen administration in order to curry 
favor with China.  He said that some even held up the \"enemy 
country\" (diguo) as their \"mother country\" (zuguo).  These 
same people, Chen continued, also remain confused over 
Taiwan\'s history and geography, believing that \"China and 
Mongolia\" are parts of \"our country\'s\" (benguo) territory. 
Chen stated that \"we all know that the People\'s Republic of 
China is a different country and the Republic of Mongolia is 
a different country, they are not our country.\"  (Note: The 
Liberty Times reported that Chen used the term \"China\" 
(Zhongguo), while the Presidential Office transcript and most 
other media outlets quote him as referring to the \"People\'s 
Republic of China.\"  End Note.) 
 
4. (C) Speaking at the same event, former President Lee 
Teng-hui offered a similar line on Taiwan\'s history and 
sovereignty.  Lee argued that only if the Pan-Green wins a 
majority on December 11 can Taiwan create a new constitution 
that will \"correct\" Taiwan\'s official name.  Both Lee and 
Chen praised the sponsoring organization\'s work to promote 
awareness of Taiwan\'s democratic reforms and sovereignty. 
 
Chen Advisors Express Surprise, Annoyance 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Senior Chen aides expressed surprise, even annoyance, 
over the president\'s November 7 comments.  National Security 
Council (NSC) Senior Advisor for cross-Strait affairs Chen 
Chung-hsin said that NSC Secretary General Chiou I-jen had 
scheduled a meeting on November 8 to discuss how to keep the 
president from going beyond his brief during 40 planned 
campaign appearances scheduled to start on November 12. 
According to Chen, Chiou read about the president\'s remarks 
in the papers the morning after they were made.  \"Chiou said 
he thought we still had a week to plan how to prevent exactly 
this sort of thing from occurring,\" Chen added. 
 
6. (C) Longtime presidential senior speechwriter Lin 
Jin-chang told AIT that the president was not speaking off a 
prepared text.  \"He got some talking points on educational 
reform, but apparently decided to discard them and talk off 
the cuff,\" Lin added.  Lin speculated that Chen \"got carried 
away by the audience and Lee Teng-hui.\"  The NSC\'s Chen said 
that in order to limit the damage from the November 7 
remarks, the president agreed to a suggestion by Chiou that 
he give a series of more conciliatory public statements. 
Chen said that the president expressed a willingness to 
\"flesh out some of the concepts from his October 10 National 
Day speech\" in order to ease PRC fears.  Speechwriter Lin 
acknowledged that the November 7 speech would damage the 
president\'s credibility with Beijing, but offered that it 
could have been worse.  \"At least he didn\'t say this at a 
formal occasion,\" Lin asserted, adding that \"Beijing should 
realize that these were just informal comments to a group of 
fundamentalists.\"  (Comment: Lin is among the president\'s 
three longest serving confidantes and author of virtually all 
of Chen\'s major speeches over the past decade.  His apparent 
belief that public messages can be compartmentalized for 
different audiences track quite closely with the president\'s 
long-standing practice.  End Comment.) 
 
KMT: Chen Toying with Independence 
---------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) KMT Spokesman Chang Jung-kung publicly criticized the 
president on November 8 for saying different things to 
different audiences and called on Chen to \"go ahead and 
insert the \'State-to-State theory\' into the constitution.\" 
Chang also assailed the president\'s comments on Taiwan\'s 
geographical definition, asserting that the \"country\'s\" 
borders should be seen in historical terms, not just from the 
perspective of what the government currently administers. 
 
Comment: Political Ploy or Ideological Commitment? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8. (S) Chen\'s November 7 comments are disturbing regardless 
of whether or not you believe the alibi provided by our NSC 
contacts.  If Chen were simply caught up in the emotion of 
the crowd, we may be in store for another rough period 
between now and the election on December 11.  It is likely 
that Beijing will take the even less charitable, but perhaps 
as plausible, view that Chen\'s November 7 remarks reflect his 
true thinking, or at least the thinking of the majority 
within his own political base.  While Chen did not explicitly 
contradict his May 20 pledge not to touch on sovereignty 
definitions during the upcoming round of constitutional 
reforms, his formulations certainly suggests where his 
sympathies lie.  Senior Chen administration officials, 
including his Vice President, Premier, and Foreign Minister, 
have been more than willing to voice interpretations of the 
president\'s intentions very different than those provided to 
us by Chen\'s scripted messages and the more pragmatic 
advisors who wrote them. 
 
9. (S) Chen\'s November 7 remarks once again raises serious 
questions over the president\'s willingness to level with 
elements of his own base in pursuit of broader regional 
security interests.  The inability (or unwillingness) of 
Taiwan\'s opposition parties to offer a credible alternative 
to the DPP has shifted the political balance away from where 
it once lay.  Responsibility for putting down markers on how 
far Taiwan can push the independence agenda may increasingly 
fall on our shoulders.  The reactions to Secretary Powell\'s 
recent interviews in Beijing (Reftel) and to President Bush\'s 
December 9, 2003 warning against unilateral changes to the 
status quo both demonstrate that the Taiwan public takes USG 
views seriously.  AIT will continue to press Chen 
administration officials on the need for restraint in 
private.  Public warnings from Washington will also be an 
important tool for reminding Taiwan\'s politicians and people 
that there are limits to our tolerance for this kind of 
provocative talk.

SUBJECT: TAIWAN CONFIDENT OVER VANUATU SWITCH 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Acting Director David Keegan; Reasons: 1.5 (B/D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  MOFA officials say they are certain that 
the Vanuatu government will formalize the switch in 
recognition from Beijing to Taipei announced by Prime 
Minister Serge Vohor and Foreign Minister Mark Chen on 
November 3 in Taipei.  Taiwan officials acknowledge that 
Vohor\'s decision does not yet have the formal blessing of his 
cabinet, but say that Vohor assured Taiwan that he will bring 
his cabinet in line after his return home.  MOFA officials 
said that they expect Beijing to try to convince Vanuatu 
cabinet members to reject the change in diplomatic ties, but 
officials expressed confidence that Vohor\'s decision would 
stand.  MOFA has declined to specify the amount of aid that 
was promised to Vanuatu in exchange for recognition, but 
Vohor\'s spokesman claimed that Taipei offered $28 million 
with no strings attached.  End summary. 
 
Surprise Announcement in Taipei 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Taiwan Foreign Minister Mark Chen and Vanuatu Prime 
Minister Serge Vohor announced on November 3 the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the \"Republic 
of China\" and Vanuatu.  MOFA officials told AIT that Vohor 
secretly arrived in Taipei on November 2 to finalize the 
 
SIPDIS 
deal.  During a meeting with Vohor, President Chen Shui-bian 
hailed the opening of relations between the \"Republic of 
China\" and Vanuatu after 20 years of hard work.  He said the 
\"ROC\" and Vanuatu are both \"oceanic nations\" and will work to 
expand cooperation in the fisheries sector.  Vohor said that 
Vanuatu will use its voice in various international 
organizations \"to help Taiwan gain recognition as a sovereign 
country.\" 
 
Confusion Reigns After Announcement 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) The surprise announcement in Taipei sparked 
controversy over Vohor\'s authority to determine Vanuatu\'s 
diplomatic relationships.  Vanuatu\'s acting Prime Minister 
Ham Lini told reporters in Port Vila that Vanuatu \"supports 
the one-China policy,\" and only recognizes the PRC.  He 
characterized reports that Vohor signed a diplomatic accord 
in Taiwan as a mistake because Vanuatu had already signed a 
recognition agreement with Beijing.  There were also wire 
reports that the communiqu had not yet received the support 
of Vohor\'s cabinet, which is required for the agreement to be 
finalized.  The PRC Foreign Ministry announced on November 4 
that Beijing had received a guarantee from Lini that 
Vanuatu-PRC diplomatic ties would continue. 
 
Taiwan Confident of Switch 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Taiwan officials assert that Vohor\'s announcement was 
final and that they fully expect his cabinet to support the 
decision.  MOFA Assistant Director General for East Asian and 
Pacific Affairs Philip Lee told AIT that Vohor guaranteed 
Taiwan that his cabinet would support the communiqu he 
signed.  Lee remarked that Vohor told his Taiwan counterparts 
that he would \"take care of\" the cabinet after returning to 
Vanuatu.  According to Lee, Vohor shared his plan to 
de-recognize Beijing with key members of his cabinet before 
arriving in Taipei.  Lee said that the reason for the 
confusion after the announcement was that this agreement had 
to be undertaken in secret to ensure Beijing did not 
interfere.  Lee noted that Taipei had been working since 1988 
to convince Vanuatu to de-recognize Beijing and MOFA first 
had discussions with Vohor in 1992 about establishing 
official ties when he was Foreign Minister.  Lee added that 
Vohor had become a good friend of Taiwan and that this was 
his decision. 
 
5.  (C) It is still unclear how much economic assistance 
Vanuatu will receive in exchange for recognition.  Vohor\'s 
spokesman reported to the Vanuatu press over the weekend that 
Taiwan had agreed to provide up to $28 million next year with 
no strings attached.  MOFA Vice Foreign Minister Michael Kau 
publicly denied this and said that this was an \"imaginary\" 
figure.  Assistant Director General Lee refused to tell AIT 
how much aid, and in what form, was promised to Vanuatu in 
exchange for the diplomatic switch, asserting that details 
would be worked out later.  He did mention that Vohor had 
been frustrated with Beijing\'s empty promises in providing 
aid.  Lee also remarked that Taiwan is more than happy to 
assist Vanuatu economically.  Lee lamented that given 
Taiwan\'s diplomatic isolation, it must offer countries 
economic expertise and experience in exchange for 
recognition. 
 
Beijing Surprised, Working to Counter Move 
------------------------------------------ 
6.  (C) MOFA officials noted that Beijing was caught off 
guard by Vohor\'s announcement, but moved quickly to lobby 
members of Vanuatu\'s cabinet to reject the move.  During an 
official visit to Beijing in September, Vohor reportedly 
assured President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao that 
Vanuatu would continue to recognize Beijing.  Assistant 
Director General Lee told AIT that they expect Beijing to try 
to convince Vanuatu cabinet members not to support the switch 
in diplomatic ties, but Lee and other Taiwan officials 
claimed that they are not concerned that Vohor\'s decision 
would be overturned. 
 
Comment: The Usual Muddle 
------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Vanuatu marks another round in the ongoing 
Beijing-Taipei diplomatic chess match.  MOFA officials were 
clearly ecstatic over the small win, which they see as a 
pay-off for more than a decade of work cultivating Vohor. 
However, the personalized nature of the deal raises questions 
about whether the new Taiwan-Vanuatu relationship is 
sustainable.  Even if Vohor succeeds in bringing his cabinet 
around, it is far from certain whether Vanuatu will switch 
back to Beijing once more after he leaves the political 
arena.  Equally unclear is whether Taiwan\'s own legislature 
will be willing to underwrite once again Taiwan\'s dollar 
diplomacy, especially if it turns out that money is going 
into Vohor\'s personal bank account rather than legitimate 
development projects. 
 
8.  (C) However this latest episode in Taiwan\'s courtship of 
available diplomatic relationships plays out, it begs the 
larger question.  How long can Taiwan persuade its 27 formal 
diplomatic partners to resist the blandishments and 
intimidation that Beijing can deploy?  Does Taiwan have a 
sustainable strategy to maintain its \"international space\" if 
and when its formal diplomatic relations disappear one by 
one?  We will explore that question over the coming months.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Largely for symbolic reasons, the Taiwan government 
is pushing once again for cross-Strait charter flights to 
bring Taiwan investors in the Mainland home to Taiwan for 
Lunar New Year 2005.  After losing money in 2003 and never 
getting off the ground in 2004, Lunar New Year charter 
flights in 2005 are not commercially attractive to Taiwan\'s 
air carriers.  Taiwan has shown some readiness to overcome 
Beijing\'s objection to 2004 charter flights, but they remain 
reluctant to allow full participation for Chinese airlines. 
Taiwan\'s carriers can make much more money on other routes 
during the busy Lunar New Year travel season, but if the 
Taiwan government asks them to participate, they will comply. 
 Nevertheless, Taiwan\'s December 11 legislative elections 
could prevent charter flights from returning this year. 
Taiwan airline officials have warned us that unless the 
Taiwan government reaches an agreement with the PRC soon, 
there wouldn\'t be time to arrange the flights.  Mainland 
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu told AIT/T that 
Beijing has shown a willingness to move forward on charter 
flights, but not before the December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) 
elections.  Charter flights are still a possibility, but the 
clock is ticking and will run out very quickly after the 
elections.  (End Summary) 
 
Lost Money in 2003, Grounded in 2004 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U) In February 2003, the six Taiwan airlines made 
history by successfully completing Lunar New Year charter 
flights between Shanghai and Taipei via Hong Kong and Macau 
to provide transportation for Taiwan businessmen and their 
families in the PRC (ref A).  Charter flights could not be 
arranged in 2004 for four main reasons: 1) the PRC demanded 
that its carriers be allowed to participate, 2) Taiwan 
insisted on semi-official talks to arrange the flights, 3) 
Taiwan\'s carriers were reluctant to participate in a venture 
that was likely to be unprofitable, and 4) the political 
situation at the time was particularly tense leading up to 
Taiwan\'s presidential election (ref B). 
 
3.  (U) President Chen in his October 10 National Day speech 
this year and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on several 
occasions in the last month have publicly declared Taiwan is 
eager to implement cross-Strait charter flights again during 
the Lunar New Year in February 2005.  MAC has already taken 
steps toward resolving some of the problems that prevented 
charter flights in early 2004.  MAC has said that Taiwan is 
willing to allow PRC airlines to participate.  Moreover, both 
sides have indicated that industry representatives acting on 
behalf of government authorities can negotiate the conditions 
for charter flights.  Government officials would probably act 
as unofficial advisors to industry representatives during 
discussions. 
 
High Opportunity Costs in 2005 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  (U) However, concerns about the profitability of Lunar 
New Year charter flights remain.  Airline officials have told 
AIT that all of the airlines that participated in the 2003 
charter flights lost money.  Lunar New Year is the busiest 
time for airlines throughout Asia.  They can make a lot of 
money on other routes that will be far more heavily booked 
and don\'t have spare equipment to dedicate to unprofitable 
charter flights. 
 
5.  (U) The charter flights lost money primarily due to two 
factors.  First, airlines were only allowed to carry 
passengers one-way each trip.  At the start of the Lunar New 
Year, the airlines had to fly empty planes to Shanghai to 
pick up passengers.  At the end of the holiday, after 
passengers returned to Shanghai, empty planes flew back to 
Taipei.  On October 13 2004, MAC vice-chairman Chiu Tai-san 
stated publicly that Taiwan would allow airlines to carry 
passengers both ways without an intermediate stop. 
Accordingly to airlines, this would significantly improve 
profitability. 
 
6.  (SBU) Airlines also lost money due to low passenger 
loads.  Overall, the 2003 charter flights were only 70 
percent full.  The inaugural China Airlines (CAL) flight was 
only 30 percent full.  Because the charter flights were 
arranged hastily, there was little time to market the 
flights.  Lunar New Year is a busy travel time, and travelers 
book early.  Eva Airlines (EVA) claims it did fairly well in 
2003 and flew at near capacity.  CAL officials told AIT/T 
that because of its experience in 2003 and more developed 
infrastructure in the Mainland, it would be easier for CAL to 
sell tickets for 2005 charter flights.  Nevertheless, both 
airlines said that participation in charter flights in 2005 
would hurt the carriers\' bottom lines. 
 
An Invitation They Can\'t Refuse 
------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Despite the likelihood of losing money, the six 
Taiwan airlines enthusiastically participated in the 2003 
charter flights, if only for the public relations value. 
Having already reaped the publicity benefits, they will be 
less eager to participate in 2005.  However, they are not 
likely to refuse the Taiwan government\'s invitation to 
participate if Taiwan and PRC can agree on the conditions. 
The government still owns about 70 percent of CAL\'s shares. 
In addition, airlines will want to facilitate any government 
effort to move closer to regular cross-Strait direct air 
links.  CAL and EVA officials were both confident that if the 
government asks the airlines to conduct charter flights, all 
of Taiwan\'s carriers will participate. 
 
Political Delay May Preclude Charters 
------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) The election cycle is having an impact on the 
possibility of charter flights again.  Both CAL and EVA 
officials told us that they do not expect to see any 
substantial progress on the negotiation of charter flights 
before the December 11 LY election.  They also warned that if 
Taiwan and PRC authorities cannot reach an agreement almost 
immediately after the election, there would not be enough 
time for airlines to make the necessary arrangements.  EVA 
officials told us that negotiating charter flight conditions 
would take much longer if PRC airlines participate.  They 
speculated that Taiwan\'s Civil Aeronautics Administration 
(CAA) might require special inspections for PRC aircraft, 
possibly even require that CAA officials accompany the 
flights.  One MAC official told us that it would be much 
easier to implement charter flights if the PRC backed away 
from insisting on PRC airline participation ostensibly as a 
humanitarian gesture for Taiwan businessmen in the Mainland. 
 
9.  (C) In its October 27 press briefing, the PRC\'s Taiwan 
Affairs Office pointed out that Taiwan had not yet identified 
local partners to work with Mainland organizations on charter 
flights (ref C).  MAC Chairman Joseph Wu told AIT/T that they 
saw this pragmatic statement as a very positive sign from the 
PRC.  Using an aviation industry contact as an unofficial 
channel, MAC inquired whether this comment represented a new 
opening and whether there was the possibility of moving 
forward before the December 11 LY elections.  According to 
Wu, the PRC indicated that the statement was sincere, but 
that Beijing would not make any real policy adjustments until 
after the elections.  MAC Senior Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san 
speculated that the constructive October 27 statement may 
have been in response to Secretary of State Powell\'s request 
earlier in the week that Beijing show flexibility in it 
approach to Taiwan. 
 
10.  (C) Wu said that the Taiwan government will tone down 
its public statements on charter flights before the election 
for fear that a negative reaction from Beijing will allow the 
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) to make cross-Strait issues a 
focus of the campaign.  Wu said that MAC had informed Taiwan 
airlines that they could independently apply to PRC 
authorities for permission to conduct charters, per the 2003 
practice, but has not explicitly urged them to do so.  Under 
those conditions, airlines are unlikely to respond.  In 
addition, MAC passed the word to PRC authorities that 
Mainland airlines could apply to Taiwan\'s Civil Aeronautics 
Administration for permission to conduct charter flights. 
 
11.  (C) Comment: These developments suggest that even though 
time is running out, there is still some possibility that 
charter flights could take place.  A key indicator will be 
whether any Chinese airline takes up MAC\'s offer and 
approaches Taiwan civil aviation authorities about 
participating.  We don\'t expect to see significant progress 
between now and December 11.  If the Taiwan government is 
determined to see charter flights in February and moves very 
quickly after the election, there may still be time to make 
it happen )- but not much.  (End comment.)

denying Taiwan\'s sovereignty and promoting dialogue, 
indicates a `push-back\' to the relatively balanced 
framework. 
 
\"During the Clinton administration the United States 
began a relatively balanced policy after the Chinese 
missile crisis before the 1996 Taiwan presidential 
election.  One the one hand, it tried to improve 
Taiwan\'s military capabilities, including resuming 
bilateral military cooperation after a 20-year 
suspension and selling new arms to Taiwan.  On the 
other hand, the United States declared a `peaceful 
unification\' policy and asked the two sides across the 
strait to start dialogue.  This included forced Taipei 
and Beijing dialogue as exemplified in the 1998 Koo- 
Wang talks in Shanghai. 
 
\". When the Bush administration took over, it intended 
to build a U.S.-led unilateral global power structure. 
This had made the DPP-ruled Taiwan just right for a 
position in the strategic plan to contain China. 
 
\".The Clinton framework became meaningless under the 
circumstances.  The U.S. Taiwan policy also lost its 
balance and left the impression that the United States 
supported Taiwan independence. 
 
\"But the global anti-terror efforts after the 9-11 
incidents and the North Korean nuclear weapon issue 
gave China an indispensable role as the United States 
faces a new global strategic situation. .At the same 
time Taipei was moving faster and faster toward 
independence. 
 
\"If the policy implied in Powell\'s remarks concerning 
Taiwan sovereignty and cross-strait dialogue can be 
implemented, together with continued arms sales and 
military cooperation, it is likely that the current 
tension across the strait as well as between the United 
States and China can be pushed back to the relatively 
stable and eased condition in the past. 
 
\"However, this would be a return to the framework of 
the Clinton administration, which had been strongly 
criticized by the Republicans.\" 
 
B) \"Cross-strait Problems Have a Very Long History\" 
 
Associate Professor Hsieh Min-chieh of the Graduate 
Institute of Political Science at National Chung Cheng 
University commented in the pro-independence, English- 
language \"Taipei Times\" (11/9): 
 
\"After U.S. President George W. Bush\'s successful re- 
election, Taiwan-U.S. relations are likely to further 
prosper in light of his friendly attitude in the past. 
Washington will continue the unified and consistent 
cross-strait policy within the basic framework of 
`structural realism\' adopted by 11 Republican and 
Democratic presidents over more than half a century: 
maintaining security in the Taiwan Strait while pushing 
for a peaceful resolution to the cross-strait issue. 
 
In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States had to deal 
with an authoritarian Taiwanese government. It was able 
to control the main direction through its control of a 
few leaders. Besides, since the U.S. request of not 
using force tallied with mankind\'s longing for peace, 
Washington did not contradict its fundamental 
principles. But since the 1990s, the United States is 
facing a democratic Taiwan. Because of their democratic 
development, the Taiwanese people\'s demand for the 
right to decide their own future has constantly grown, 
while the United States is trapped in a dilemma of 
realism and idealism. After Taiwan successfully 
realized the core value promoted by the United States 
across the world, the United States is ironically 
restricting Taiwan from upholding this value. 
 
\"Democracy endows people with the right to decide their 
own future. However, in reality, the United States is 
worried that once Taiwan really chooses to declare de 
jure independence, there is risk of China taking 
extreme action, which might implicate the United 
States. Compared to the 1950s and 1960s, when 
Washington requested that Taiwan control itself 
militarily, the United States is now, after the 1990s, 
requesting Taiwan to restrict itself politically in 
order to achieve a peaceful resolution.\" 
 
C) \"Bush\'s Agenda on Taiwan\" 
 
The conservative/pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" said in an editorial (11/9): 
 
\"One Week before his re-election, President George W. 
Bush sent his Secretary of State Colin Powell on a 
whirlwind visit to Tokyo, Beijing, and Seoul. 
 
\"The Powell episode was obviously intended to alleviate 
Beijing\'s anxiety about having to prepare for war when 
Taipei rewrites its Constitution in 2006 and implements 
it two years later.  The Bush administration won\'t 
allow that to happen. 
 
\"So, at least for the next four years, Beijing is 
assured that Taiwan\'s separatists are under effective 
U.S. control. 
 
\"When Bush meets President Hu Jintao later this month 
during the APEC conference in Chile, concerted efforts 
to bring Taiwan back to the one-China fold will be 
their priority agenda.\"

ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN 
 
 
\"Once Bush and Hu Meet and Talk About Arms Sales to 
Taiwan . Hu Jintao [Raises the Issue] and the United 
States Replies, It Will Be Like Opening Pandora\'s Box\" 
 
Professor Chen I-hsin of the Graduate Institute of 
American Studies, Tamkang University, commented in the 
conservative, pro-unification, \"United Daily News\" 
(11/10): 
 
\"One development in the recent U.S. general elections 
that is related to cross-Strait affairs is the rise of 
U.S. conservative forces.  This indicates that the 
Republican Party will focus more on business and market 
interests.  As China now enjoys a huge economic appeal 
and increasing national strength, the answer would be 
obvious if one is asked to choose sides between the 
mainland and Taiwan.  Therefore, regarding the upcoming 
Bush-Hu [APEC] meeting, Taiwan\'s national security and 
foreign relation units should never be as negligent as 
they were during Secretary of State Colin Powell\'s 
visit to Beijing . If Hu Jintao raises more demands to 
the United States, we can expect that, in addition to 
abiding by the `one-China\' policy and further bilateral 
cooperation in preventing `Taiwan independence,\' he 
would certainly ask for reduced U.S. arms sales to 
Taiwan. 
 
\". Limiting U.S. arms sales to Taiwan has always been 
Beijing\'s goal.  The main reason is that arms deals are 
made between sovereign states.  Beijing knows that as 
long as the United States continues to sell arms to 
Taiwan, it cannot totally deny the de facto and de jure 
existence of Taiwan\'s sovereignty. . Should [the U.S. 
side] reply to Beijing\'s question about U.S. arms sales 
to Taiwan, it may result in something like the opening 
of Pandora\'s box and bring about many problems. . 
Therefore, whether Hu Jintao will raise the arms sale 
issue during his meeting with President Bush at APEC is 
an important indicator that is worth watching closely.\"

1. (C) Summary: Taipei County, with its 28 seats (one more 
than last election), will be the site of fierce fighting in 
the election battle for a majority in the Legislative Yuan 
this December.  The Pan-Blue parties have shown remarkable 
restraint in coordinating their nominations, resulting in a 
strong slate of candidates in each of Taipei County\'s three 
electoral sub-districts.  The Pan-Green, by contrast, has 
nominated aggressively in Taipei County, hoping to get closer 
to their goal of a legislative majority.  With successful 
peipiao vote-distribution, they might be able to take an 
extra seat, but it seems more likely that the more 
disciplined Pan-Blue will take an additional seat or two, 
shifting the balance in Taipei county from its current 14-13 
in favor of Pan-Green to 14-14 or even 13-15.  End Summary. 
 
Taipei County: The Big Prize 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Taipei County (pop. 3,689,664) is a sprawling northern 
Taiwan district encircling Taipei City.  It is the most 
populous county in Taiwan (its population also significantly 
exceeds Taipei City\'s), and has therefore been divided into 
three sub-districts for the purpose of Legislative Yuan (LY) 
representation.  Taipei County elects 28 legislators, fully 
one sixth of the total elected from geographical districts, 
and will be a major focus for every party in the December 11 
elections for control of the LY.  Taipei County, like many 
districts in the north, is traditionally considered Pan-Blue 
territory.  KMT presidential candidate Lien Chan won the 
county by more than six percent in the March election.  The 
Pan-Blue also did well in the 2001 LY elections, in 
percentage terms, beating the Pan-Green by an 11 point 
margin.  However, because the Democratic Progressive Party 
(DPP) distributed votes much more evenly among its 
candidates, the Pan-Green managed to take 14 seats to the 
Pan-Blue\'s 13.  This year both sides aim to gain seats in 
Taipei County, nominating a total of 19 candidates on the 
Pan-Green side against 18 from the Pan-Blue.  Additionally, 
16 independent and minor party candidates have joined the 
fray. 
 
Party Strategies Reflect Different Strengths 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) These numbers ensure that Taipei County will be hotly 
contested.  Each party has adopted a strategy tailored to its 
particular strengths and weaknesses.  The DPP, for example, 
enjoys more ideological and organizational cohesion than 
other parties, so it will rely on a heavily party-based 
campaign.  Candidates in each electoral district are running 
as a team, always appearing together at rallies and on 
campaign posters.  This helps ensure that all candidates 
enjoy similar levels of name recognition and popularity. 
Loyal voters are then encouraged to split their votes among 
DPP candidates according to a \"peipiao\" vote distribution 
scheme (see Reftel A for more on peipiao and why a party 
would implement it).  The DPP\'s expertise with peipiao was 
largely responsible for its good performance in Taipei County 
in the 2001 LY elections. 
 
4. (C) The KMT\'s strategy will focus on helping candidates 
cultivate local connections.  Nominees are selected for and 
assigned to distinct \"home territories\" in which they build 
their own base of support.  This candidate-centered style, 
which can result in lopsided vote distribution, has been 
blamed for the KMT\'s disappointing results in the 2001 
elections.  However, KMT Taipei County Vice Chairman Chao 
Jung-sheng said he disagrees with this assessment and 
asserted that he is confident the KMT\'s local candidate-based 
strategy will prove to be successful in December\'s election. 
The Pan-Blue\'s problems in the 2001 election were not 
fundamentally a result of this campaign style, he said, but 
rather came about because there were simply too many 
nominations.  He noted that in Taipei County\'s first 
sub-district the KMT nominated four candidates in 2001, but 
only took one seat.  This year, they more realistically 
nominated only two candidates, he said, and both would very 
likely be elected. 
5. (C) Chao explained that the PFP and KMT leadership 
coordinated their nomination strategy this year.  Results of 
the last two elections were compared to current polls and 
analyzed to determine a maximum number of nominations in each 
sub-district.  These quotas were then divided between the KMT 
and the PFP according to the relative strength of each 
party\'s candidates.  Chao remarked that with a realistic 
number of nominees, overt peipiao schemes of the sort used by 
the DPP would be unnecessary.  Simply making sure that each 
candidate was assigned a large enough territory in which to 
cultivate support and then making the KMT\'s organizational 
resources available to all the candidates would \"do the work 
of peipiao for us.\" 
 
Sub-District One: A Crowded Field on Both Sides 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
6. (C) Taipei County\'s First Sub-District is its smallest. 
Located in the urban southwestern portion of the county, this 
sub-district is roughly centered along the main 
transportation links from Taipei City to the western and 
southern parts of the island.  It includes the cities of 
Panchiao, Shulin and Tucheng and the towns of Sanhsia and 
Yingko, and is represented by eight LY seats, currently split 
5-3 for the Pan-Green.  The KMT\'s two nominees are Lee 
Chia-chin, an incumbent, and Lin Hung-chih, the current Mayor 
of Panchiao.  As part of their agreement with the KMT, the 
PFP also nominated two candidates: the incumbent Chou Hsi-wei 
and a former Panchiao Mayor, Wu Ching-chih.  Additionally, 
the New Party (NP) nominated a former LY member, Lee 
Sheng-feng, who will officially run under the KMT banner but 
who is otherwise not connected to the main KMT campaign, and 
therefore was not counted against their quota in the KMT-PFP 
nominations agreement.  Most observers are dismissive of his 
chances for election.  Vice Chairman Chao said he believes 
both KMT and both PFP nominees can get elected, but KMT 
Organization and Development Committee Chairman Liao Fung-te 
said that the PFP\'s Wu was not likely to win unless the PFP 
managed to divert some votes to him from the more popular 
Chou.  PFP County Chairman Wang An-pang, however, complained 
that the real problem was that the KMT was \"unwilling to 
share its votes,\" and was instead trying to \"steal PFP 
supporters by playing up the inevitability of a merger\" 
between the two parties. 
 
7. (C) On the Pan-Green side, the DPP nominated three of its 
incumbents (Lee Wen-chung, Chang Ching-fang, and Wang 
Shu-hui) as well as Chuang Shuo-han, the former Vice Chairman 
of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.  The DPP\'s fourth 
incumbent did not stand for reelection because he is 
currently serving a sentence for corruption in a Hualien 
prison.  The TSU nominated its incumbent, Liao Pen-yen, as 
well as a County Councilmember, Hsiao Kuan-yu.  The 
nomination of six candidates in an eight seat sub-district 
which has historically favored the other side by a few points 
has put the Pan-Green candidates in a difficult position. 
The DPP candidates have agreed that a peipiao scheme will 
need to be implemented but have not been able to settle on 
the details, because as it stands the vote might be spread 
too thinly for all of them to be elected.  The DPP\'s Lee told 
newspapers that in the end, weaker candidates might need to 
be sacrificed to save the rest.  Wang said she was afraid her 
votes would be \"shared away\" from her, because the other 
candidates assume she can rely on taking one of Taipei 
County\'s two seats set aside for women.  Although she is the 
only woman running in sub-district one, the other 
sub-districts have several women who will likely do well, she 
said, meaning she cannot take her seat for granted.  DPP 
County Chairman Chang Chi-chang said there were enough votes 
for all four DPP candidates, and that it was the TSU that had 
over-nominated.  He said that only the DPP newcomer Chuang 
was in any danger: he would be competing with the TSU 
incumbent for the last seat. 
 
Sub-District Two: Pan-Green Overnomination? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Taipei County\'s Second Sub-District encompasses the 
northern coastal portion of the county, including the cities 
of Sanchung, Hsinchuang and Luchou, the port town of Tamsui, 
and a number of smaller townships.  In 2001, its ten seats 
split 5-5, but this year a new seat has been added to reflect 
the area\'s growing population.  The KMT has nominated two of 
its three incumbents (Tsai Chia-fu and Lee Hsien-jung) as 
well as Wu Yu-sheng (a former spokesman for Taipei Mayor Ma 
Ying-jeou) and Chu Chun-hsiao (a former National Assembly 
member and son of a former Sanchung Mayor).  The PFP 
nominated its two incumbents, Lee Hung-chun and Ko Shu-min. 
PFP Chairman Wang said he is confident all six Pan-Blue 
nominees can win election.  KMT Vice Chairman Chao said that 
both PFP seats are safe, and that only Chu is in any danger. 
He was quick to point out that the reason for Chu\'s 
disappointing lack of support is that he joined the campaign 
late, after having been asked by the party leadership to run. 
 Chao explained that Chu was selected for his connections 
with Sanchung, where the KMT had no other candidates running. 
 As voters become more familiar with Chu, he said, his level 
of support should rise quickly.  KMT Committee Chairman Liao 
had a similar assessment, but added that the party would look 
for ways to have voters outside Chu\'s region boost his 
support. 
 
9. (C) On the Pan-Green side, the DPP nominated six 
candidates (incumbents Chen Ching-chun and Chen Mao-nan, 
County Councilmembers Tsai Lai-wang and Lin Shu-fen, former 
Luchou Mayor Huang Chien-hui, and Wu Ping-jui, the former 
secretary to Presidential Office SecGen Su Chen-chang).  The 
 
SIPDIS 
TSU nominated the incumbent Hsu Teng-kung as well as former 
 
SIPDIS 
DPP Organizational Affairs Director Liu I-te.  DPP Chairman 
Chang acknowledged that with so many candidates, the 
Pan-Green is \"under a lot of pressure.\"  He explained the 
DPP\'s decision to nominate six candidates was justified by 
the fact that \"last time we got enough votes for five, but 
only nominated four.\"  This time, he said, \"because the 
second district got a new seat, we decided to nominate six.\" 
Furthermore, he added, this sub-district was meant to serve 
as an experiment, to test the theory that nominating more 
candidates will attract more voters, so that even if all of 
them do not win, the DPP will be able to take a greater share 
of the proportional representation seats.  With four of the 
six DPP candidates being newcomers, Chang explained that the 
DPP\'s \"team campaign\" strategy is key to ensuring that all of 
them get elected.  He added that peipiao arrangements had 
already been made.  Voters will likely be asked to give their 
votes to candidates based on the month of their birth.  With 
each candidate assigned two months, the result should be an 
equal distribution among all candidates, Chang claimed, 
ensuring all six get elected. 
 
10. (C) TSU candidate Hsu Teng-kung offered a different 
assessment of the electoral landscape: \"The DPP nominated too 
many candidates.  At best five can win.\"  He partially blamed 
this overcrowding for his own campaign\'s problems, but said 
that the biggest reason for his disappointing performance in 
recent polls was his late start.  Until August, he explained, 
the TSU had only planned to nominate Liu, but then party 
founder Lee Teng-hui felt they should be more ambitious and 
try to gain seats in the LY.  \"Lee came and personally asked 
me to run again,\" he said. 
 
Sub-District Three: Blue Territory 
---------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Taipei County\'s Third Sub-District, which includes 
the more rural south and southeast parts of the county as 
well as the cities of Chungho, Yungho, Hsintien and Hsichih, 
has nine seats and has traditionally been the Bluest part of 
the county.  In 2001, the Pan-Blue sent six candidates to the 
LY against the DPP\'s three, explained KMT Chairman Chao. 
However, KMT maverick Chao Yung-ching joined the DPP after 
getting elected, bringing the current balance to 5-4.  This 
time, the KMT and PFP each nominated three candidates to 
attempt to reclaim the lost seat.  Additionally, the NP has 
nominated popular former TV talk show host Joanna Lei (Chien) 
under the KMT banner.  KMT Vice Chairman Chao explained that 
the KMT was using the same regional strategy as in the other 
sub-districts, nominating candidates from different parts of 
the sub-district to allow each territory within which to 
build support.  The two incumbents Hung Hsiu-chu and Lo 
Ming-tsai are from Yonghe and Hsintian, he said, and former 
National Assembly member Chang Ching-chung is from Chungho. 
All three, in addition to the NP\'s Lei, are doing well, Chao 
said, but Chang\'s newcomer status made his election less 
certain.  The PFP nominated incumbents Lee Ching-hua, Lin 
Te-fu and Cheng San-yuan, all three of whom are on track for 
reelection, according to PFP Chairman Wang as well as recent 
newspaper polls. 
 
12. (C) The DPP hopes to hold onto its four seats in the 
third sub-district, said DPP Chairman Chang, so it has 
nominated three of its incumbents (Chao, Chou Ya-shu, and 
Chen Chao-lung) as well as County Councilmember Shen Fa-hui. 
Chang explained that although the DPP\'s historical share of 
the vote in sub-district three is only enough to support 
three candidates, ex-KMT legislator Chao should be able to 
bring some of his supporters with him.  With \"a little more 
effort,\" he said, and a good peipiao scheme, the DPP should 
be able to get all four elected.  The peipiao arrangements, 
as in sub-district two, would be based on the month of a 
voter\'s birth, with each of the four candidates getting three 
months.  The TSU, which won no seats in 2001, nominated 
County Councilmember Chen Yong-fu.  KMT Committee Chairman 
Liao said the TSU\'s nomination of Chen only threatened the 
reelection of the DPP\'s Chen, and if the two split the vote, 
it might make room for the KMT\'s Chang and throw the 
sub-district balance to 7-2 in the Pan-Blue\'s favor.  DPP 
Chairman Chang offered a different assessment, saying that 
the TSU\'s Chen was attracting voters from a different base 
and not \"stealing them\" from the DPP.  The DPP and the TSU, 
he noted, had a tacit understanding that they would work 
together to take a majority in the LY this year. 
 
Independents - Impact Will Be Indirect 
-------------------------------------- 
 
13. (C) A total of sixteen independent and minor party 
candidates registered in Taipei County\'s three sub-districts. 
 Few observers think any of them have a serious chance at 
election.  According to DPP County Chairman Chang, except for 
mavericks from the major parties who run on their own 
nomination (such as ex-KMT now-DPP incumbent Chao 
Yung-ching), no independent has ever won in Taipei County. 
That said, there are a few independent candidates who might 
have a significant impact on the election.  In the first 
sub-district, the infamous leader of the \"Tientaomeng\" gang, 
Lo Fu-chu nominated himself for election, but recently said 
he was dropping out because of his mother\'s objection to his 
involvement in politics.  A more credible reason offered by 
KMT Committee Chairman Liao is that Lo wants to help his son, 
KMT candidate Lo Ming-tsai, win election in the third 
sub-district.  DPP Chairman Chang noted that given \"Lo 
Fu-chu\'s special connections,\" Lo Ming-tsai\'s reelection was 
all but assured.  In the second sub-district, the Pan-Green\'s 
over-nomination worries could be further complicated by 
Nonpartisan Solidarity Union incumbent Cheng Yu-chen.  Cheng 
won election in 2001 as a DPP candidate but was expelled from 
the party after a scandal over his leaving his wife to live 
with a TV anchorwoman mistress in Los Angeles.  Nobody AIT 
spoke with gave Cheng any chance of winning reelection in the 
wake of the scandal, but KMT Vice Chairman Chao said he was 
hopeful Cheng would skim off some DPP\'s supporters. 
 
Comment: The Pan-Green\'s Gamble 
------------------------------- 
 
14. (C) The Pan-Blue nominations in Taipei County were 
tightly controlled and coordinated between the two parties, 
resulting in a strong slate of candidates in each 
sub-district, nearly all of whom stand a good chance of being 
elected.  The Pan-Blue seems to have learned its lesson from 
past elections, at least in Taipei County, and might be 
rewarded for its newfound discipline.  The Pan-Green 
nominations, by contrast, seem aggressive to the point of 
recklessness.  DPP County Chairman Chang justified the 
strategy by explaining that there is no more territory to be 
won in southern districts that form the Pan-Green heartland, 
so the only way to capture a majority in the LY is by 
aggressively taking seats in the north in traditional 
Pan-Blue strongholds like Taipei County.  The DPP\'s famous 
peipiao techniques will be put to the test in trying to 
assure all six of its nominees (including four newcomers) in 
sub-district two, for example, win election.  The Pan-Green 
looks more likely than not to lose one seat each in the first 
and third sub-districts to the more organized Pan-Blue and 
may well ask one candidate in each district to cease 
campaigning.  In the second district, both sides will likely 
hold onto their five seats, and it will be a close fight for 
the new seat added this year.  Therefore it seems the best 
the Pan-Green can hope for (barring any disastrous blunders 
on the Pan-Blue side before December 11) is to fight off the 
Pan-Blue in sub-districts one and three and take the new seat 
in sub-district two, shifting the balance one seat further 
into their favor at 15-13.  Far more likely is a result of 
14-14 or 13-15, driving them one or two seats further from 
their goal of a majority in the LY.  The worst case scenario 
for the Pan-Green would be a loss in both sub-districts one 
and three and to give up the extra seat in sub-district two 
to the Pan-Blue, shifting the balance to 12-16.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: National Security Council (NSC) Secretary 
General Chiou I-jen provided the Acting Director on November 
10 an advanced copy of a 10-point policy statement President 
Chen Shui-bian planned to unveil later in the day.  The 
policy reiterates themes from Chen\'s May 20 and October 10 
speeches, providing slightly more clarity over Taipei\'s 
position on the \"1992 Hong Kong\" framework and opening of 
direct transportation links.  Chen will also call on his 
government to craft a set of \"Sunshine Policies\" to 
facilitate closer substantive relations with the Mainland. 
Chiou said the president wants to signal Beijing that 
dialogue could be resumed by either addressing \"principle\" 
issues first, hence the \"1992 Hong Kong\" formulation, or 
technical issues, such as direct links.  Chiou acknowledged 
that some of Chen\'s recent statements aimed at domestic

deviating from the course Chen set on May 20, but he asserted 
that this sort of suspicion underscores the need for 
effective channels of communication.  End Summary. 
 
Chen\'s 10 Points 
---------------- 
 
2. (C) NSC Secretary General Chiou I-jen asked the Acting 
Director for an urgent meeting on November 10 to preview a 10 
point cross-Strait/foreign policy plan that he predicted 
would be announced later in the day by President Chen 
Shui-bian (See para 8 for AIT\'s informal translation). 
According to Chiou, Chen wanted to demonstrate to Beijing and 
Washington that the conciliatory policy line he set on May 20 
is not only unchanged, but is being reinforced in substantive 
terms.  Chiou said that Taipei sees a window of opportunity 
after the December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) election to 
restart some form of dialogue with Beijing.  The November 10 
address would aim to lay the policy groundwork to move 
forward.  Chiou noted that Chen would preside over 4 hours of 
meetings later in the day with his foreign policy team, and 
if there were no serious objections, the points he provided 
to AIT would be read out by the president in front of 
television cameras.  Chiou noted that he would follow-up with 
a press conference to provide further background on the 
policy initiatives. 
 
3. (C) Chiou highlighted several elements of the address for 
AIT.  Chiou said that in point number 3, the president would 
expand a bit on his \"1992 Hong Kong basis\" formulation first 
floated during Chen\'s October 10 National Day address.  Chen 
would acknowledge Beijing\'s insistence on the \"one China 
principle\" and ask Beijing to respect the Taiwan people\'s 
loyalties to the \"Republic of China.\"  Chiou noted that in 
the following point, Chen would call for opening talks on 
direct transportation links using the \"Taiwan-Hong Kong 
aviation talks\" model referred to recently by the PRC State 
Council Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO).  Chiou asserted that the 
two points were meant to give Beijing an option.  If they 
want to address political principles first, Taiwan was 
willing to look back to the 1992 Hong Kong talks, which 
focused on bridging the political gap between the two sides. 
If the PRC preferred to start with less sensitive subjects, 
Chiou asserted that point number 4 offered Beijing the model 
of the 1993 Singapore talks, which established protocols for 
technical cooperation between the two sides. 
 
4. (C) In addition to calling for direct transportation 
links, Chiou said that Chen would order that Taiwan\'s 
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) expand their operations beyond 
Taiwan\'s borders.  Chiou said that following the president\'s 
address, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and Ministry of 
Economic Affairs (MOEA) would be tasked with revising current 
restrictions on the operations of SOEs overseas, including on 
the Mainland (Comment: the points provided to AIT do not 
refer to SOE operations on the Mainland, but Chiou explicitly 
stated that the PRC would be part of the SOE globalization 
initiative.  End Comment.)  On the military side, Chiou said 
that Chen will announce that Taiwan will \"absolutely not\" 
procure weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and call on China 
to openly renounce the use of WMDs against Taiwan.  He 
acknowledged that this commitment meant that there would be 
no plans for an attack on Shanghai.  Chiou noted that Chen 
will also call for talks on the establishment of an air and 
sea buffer zone between the two sides, and pledge to reduce 
the size of Taiwan\'s military to 100,000 personnel. 
 
Staying on Message 
------------------ 
 
5. (C) The Acting Director responded positively to Chen\'s 
renewed commitment to the constructive steps laid out in his 
inaugural and 10/10 speeches, but he re-emphasized the 
importance of consistency in Taipei\'s public messages.  Chiou 
acknowledged that President Chen\'s November 7 speech to the 
Taiwan Association of Professors (Reftel) may have caused 
concern in Beijing, but Chiou assured AIT that they did not 
represent a change in policy.  Chiou said that the president 
informed him after the fact that Chen was careful to use the 
term \"People\'s Republic of China\" rather than \"China,\" as 
some media outlets reported, to describe the other side.  In 
addition, Chiou asserted that Chen did not say anything that 
contradicted his May 20 pledge not to address sovereignty 
issues in the upcoming round of constitutional reforms.  The 
Acting Director countered that the tone of the speech left 
considerable room for interpretation and could encourage 
skeptics in Beijing to question Chen\'s sincerity.  Chiou 
accepted that this may be the case, but added that if Taiwan 
could communicate with Beijing like it does with the United 
States, such \"misinterpretations\" could be avoided. 
 
6. (C) Later in the day, NSC Senior Advisor for cross-Strait 
affairs Chen Chung-hsin informed AIT that the 10 points had 
been accepted at the afternoon foreign policy meeting with 
only one or two small word changes.  Chen noted that Vice 
President Annette Lu urged that the point dealing with the 
\"1992 Hong Kong\" framework be removed, ostensibly because 
domestic reaction to president\'s October 10 reference to the 
formula was not positive enough.  Chen said that the 
president rejected Lu\'s demand, stating that the \"1992 Hong 
Kong\" framework was integral to the government\'s efforts to 
find a way forward.  However, the president did agree to Lu\'s 
demand to add \"or develop\" to the call for the PRC not to use 
nuclear weapons.  Chen asserted that he and others argued 
against the change, noting that it would make Taiwan look 
naive, but the president agreed to include the change \"in 
order to shut her (Lu) up.\"  According to Chen, a pool camera 
filmed the president reading out the statement at about 6:00 
pm local time.  He expected the tape to be broadcast later in 
the evening.  Chen added that he had alerted his cross-Strait 
media and academic contacts to pay special attention to the 
initiative. 
 
Comment: Getting Back on Track 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) As promised (Reftel), Chen\'s moderate NSC advisors 
have redirected the president back to the conciliatory May 20 
line.  Chen\'s points should lay down a helpful marker on a 
number of issues, even if some of the military confidence 
building measures (CBMs) initiatives are seen as overly 
optimistic.  The larger problem remains consistency.  While 
Chiou offered assurances that the president has no intention 
on changing the substance of his May 20 policy line, he 
admitted that pressures from Chen\'s fundamentalist base will 
constrain the president\'s room to maneuver on the question of 
Taiwan\'s sovereignty.  Chen\'s plan to hit the campaign trail 
starting November 12 may test his ability to stay on message. 
 
8. (C) (Begin informal AIT translation of the president\'s 
draft policy statement) 
 
1) The maintenance of stability in the Taiwan Strait and the 
status quo of peace continues to be a matter of great concern 
to the international community and an area where the United 
States plays an important role.  Taiwan and the United States 
both have long enjoyed common values of freedom, democracy, 
and human rights.  Over the past half century, Taiwan\'s 
democratic and economic development has become an asset to be 
enjoyed by the international community.  It is certainly not 
a liability.  We thank the United States for its continued 
commitment to the \"Taiwan Relations Act\" and the \"Six 
Assurances.\"  In the future, the two sides should continue to 
cooperate to maintain peace and stability in the Asia Pacific 
region on the basis of a common alliance of values. 
 
2) We believe the coming two years should be viewed as a 
unique opportunity to restart dialogue across the Taiwan 
Strait in the common pursuit of long-term peace and 
stability.  The two sides\' governments and leaders should 
wisely use this \"window of opportunity\" to create a basis for 
peace and happiness.  While there are many factors that 
contribute to the other side\'s inability to respond to our 
goodwill and sincerity, our determination and patience will 
not change.  We would like to once again reiterate that the 
cross-Strait policy direction set out in the president\'s May 
20 Inaugural Address and this year\'s National Day Address 
will not change in any way during the (the president\'s) term 
of office.  On the basis of the \"Two No Changes,\" government 
agencies should actively explore reopening dialogue, reducing 
tensions, and cooperatively developing \"Sunshine Policies\" to 
promote cross-Strait cooperation. 
 
3) We fully acknowledge (renzhidao) the Beijing authority\'s 
insistence on the \"one China\" principle.  At the same time, 
we urge the other side to positively view the reality of the 
\"Republic of China\'s\" existence and the democratic 
determination of Taiwan\'s 23 million people to be their own 
masters.  If the two sides can extend mutual understanding 
and tolerance, we can use peaceful dialogue to rationally 
discuss how to resolve our differences and eliminate 
confrontation.  The \"1992 Hong Kong talks\" embodied exactly 
this spirit. 
 
4) On the basis of the \"1992 Hong Kong talks,\" the government 
is actively pursuing cross-Strait economic and cultural 
exchanges, including the Three Links.  At this stage, we can 
use the Taiwan-Hong Kong Aviation Talks model to immediately 
open consultations on direct two-way air cargo and Chinese 
New Year\'s charter flights. 
 
5) In order to fulfill the economic strategy of \"promote 
development in Taiwan, reach out to the world,\" the 
government should take a cue from the private sector and 
encourage major State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to expand 
their international operations and investment.  They should 
also actively encourage foreign capital and labor talent to 
come to Taiwan in order to accelerate the globalization of 
our industrial base. 
 
6) The Ministry of National Defense has already completed a 
plan to reduce the term of compulsory military service to 18 
months starting July 1 next year with a target of cutting our 
military forces to 100,000 by the year 2008.  This effort 
will help ease cross-Strait military tensions, create a lean, 
more effective military force, and enhance our self-defense 
capabilities. 
 
7) For humanitarian reasons and in view of international 
norms, we believe that the use of nuclear, chemical, and 
biological weapons should be banned in the Taiwan Strait.  We 
are willing to publicly pledge that we will absolutely not 
develop these sorts of weapons of mass destruction and 
strongly urge China to publicly announce that it will not or 
develop or use weapons of mass destruction against Taiwan. 
 
8) In order to avoid miscalculations or unintended military 
clashes, we recommend that the two sides consider 
establishing a military buffer zone.  Aircraft and ships 
should avoid entering this zone, or if they do need to enter 
it, they should first notify the other side. 
 
9) We recommend that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait 
consider the approach used in the 1972 U.S.-Soviet \"Maritime 
Incident Agreement\" and the 1998 U.S.-China \"Maritime 
Cooperation Agreement\" to create a Taiwan Strait military and 
security consultative mechanism that can promote the eventual 
creation of a \"Taiwan Strait Code of Conduct.\"  This effort 
would be similar to the international demilitarized zone 
created between South and North Korea and the communication 
mechanism between India and Pakistan. 
10) Security in the Taiwan Strait is more important than the 
interests of individual political parties or personalities. 
The development of peace across the Taiwan Strait is the 
common hope of all people.  We can only develop cross-Strait 
relations if Taiwan is united internally and stable 
politically.  After the year-end legislative election, we 
will invite representatives from various political parties 
and social groups to join the \"Cross-Strait Peace and 
Development Committee.\"  We do not rule out inviting the 
leaders of the opposition parties to serve as members.  Our 
hope is to develop a consensus among all political parties 
and the public behind a long-term \"Cross-Strait Peace and 
Development Platform\" that will serve to actively promote 
cross-Strait peace and stability, and create a sustainable 
and prosperous new cross-Strait relationship.

TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, KPAO, TW, Foreign Policy, Cross Strait Politics 
SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
 
A)  \"Change in the Nature of the Triangular 
Relationship between Washington, Beijing and Taipei\" 
 
Journalist Wang Ming-yi said in the \"My Views\" column 
of the centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\": 
 
\". The Chen Shui-bian administration\'s national 
security team has evidently sensed that `cross-Strait 
stability and maintenance of the peaceful status quo in 
the Taiwan Strait have always been issues of common 
concern for the international community, ones in which 
the United States plays an essential role.\'  This is 
[the team\'s] reflection and review of the mutual trust 
crisis between the United States and Taiwan.  But the 
question is: [U.S. President George W.] Bush\'s 
criticism of Taiwan leaders and [Secretary of State 
Colin] Powell\'s disregard of Taiwan\'s sovereign status 
did not come about simply because the Taiwan 
authorities have become `unpredictable friends\' of 
Washington.  Instead, they are the result of a 
fundamental change in Washington\'s thinking in dealing 
with the Taiwan issue. 
 
\"Neither side of the Taiwan Strait can possibly deny 
that the United States\' national interests are the real 
variables that affect the cross-Strait situation. 
Lately, Washington has been playing a more proactive 
role in setting foot in cross-Strait issues.  It does 
not want to be a mere `facilitator\'; instead, it wants 
to be an `arbitrator.\'  Washington does not support 
Taiwan independence and is opposed to China\'s use of 
force against Taiwan.  The status quo of `peaceful 
confrontation\' across the Taiwan Strait is, reasonably 
speaking, in the best interests of Washington. . 
 
\"Sources said prior to Powell\'s visit to Beijing in 
late October, relevant think tanks in Washington had a 
closed-door meeting with State Department officials. 
In the meeting, a heavy-weight `pro-China\' think tank 
person suggested that since the political situation in 
Taiwan headed by President Chen is full of 
`unpredictability,\' Washington should seriously 
consider how to work with Beijing to `jointly handle\' 
the Taiwan issue in an attempt to effectively control 
or prevent any `Taiwan variables\' that might seriously 
endanger future Washington-Beijing ties.  When both 
[Taiwan\'s] friend and its rival have started to adopt a 
wait-and-see and cautious attitude toward the Taiwan 
authorities, it will be the biggest crisis for Taiwan\'s 
existence and development.\" 
 
B) \"Why U.S., Japan Must Defend Taiwan\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taiwan News\" 
editorialized (11/11): 
 
\". Taiwan\'s strategic position is extremely important 
to both the United States and Japan.  Therefore, if 
China is able to take over Taiwan, Beijing will secure 
a virtual stranglehold over the Taiwan Strait and thus 
influence the security of Japan\'s crucial marine 
communication lines with Southeast Asia and the Middle 
East. 
 
\"Therefore, it is strategically necessary for both 
Washington and Tokyo to join together and defend Taiwan 
in order to safeguard both Japan\'s national security 
and the interests of the U.S. in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
 
\"Therefore, the most urgent task facing Tokyo is to 
develop channels and methods with Washington to 
cooperate in the defense of the Taiwan Strait. 
Moreover, Japan\'s naval Self-Defense Forces should work 
hand in hand with Taiwan\'s navy to ensure the security 
of the seas surrounding Taiwan and thus ensure that the 
U.S. Navy can smoothly and rapidly send naval carrier 
task forces to Taiwan Strait in order to cope with an 
emergency situation.\" 
 
C) \"On Friendship\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" said in an editorial (11/12): 
 
\". In Taiwan\'s case, the `special friend\' is the United 
States.  If it were acting in sheer self-interest, the 
U.S. would have abandoned Taiwan long ago.  Taiwan, to 
be quite honest, is an irritant between the U.S. and 
China - the relationship between the world\'s most 
powerful and it\'s [sic] most populous is something 
which is vital in foreign policy, and likely to be the 
century\'s most crucial bilateral relationship.  In 
truth, the U.S. State Department seems to view Taiwan 
just as that - an irritant.  Sometimes Taiwan seems to 
think that friendly is all one way - that the U.S. 
should aid Taiwan, without Taiwan doing anything in 
return. 
 
\"When it comes to defense, the U.S. acts likes a friend 
- at times it speaks frankly as a friend would, but 
Taiwan often acts more like a customer in a marketplace 
than a friend, haggling over small details and not 
accepting what is a good deal without trying to beat 
the seller down. 
 
\"Taiwan\'s friends in the U.S. are mainly in the 
Congress.  These people like and admire Taiwan as a 
brave and resourceful ally, but this patience at times 
must wear thin as well.  But like friends, they accept 
there will occasionally be differences of opinion.  But 
it is in the nature of friends to speak frankly, and 
when these friends speak, we should listen. .\"

1. (C) Summary: Former PFP International Affairs Director 
Raymond Wu told AIT that he intends to join President Chen 
Shui-bian\'s inter-party Cross-Strait Peace and Stability 
Committee after it is set up in early 2005.  Wu said he would 
join the committee even if his political mentor James Soong 
objected because he believes Soong and current Pan-Blue 
leaders have lost sight of the true aspirations of the Taiwan 
people.  Wu said that he attempted to introduce innovative 
ideas on cross-Strait policies to the Pan-Blue leadership but 
was ignored.  The Pan-Blue has said that it will boycott the 
committee.  However, should the DPP succeed in attracting 
other prominent Pan-Blue experts to participate, the Pan-Blue 
might find itself left out of cross-Strait policy debates. 
End Summary. 
 
DPP courts Wu again 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) Former People First Party (PFP) International Affairs 
Director Raymond Wu told AIT that National Security Council 
(NSC) Secretary General Chiou I-jen had asked him to 
participate in the inter-party Cross-Strait Peace and 
Stability Committee that Chen Shui-bian said he intends to 
set up in early 2005.  Wu said that he and Chiou had met to 
talk about the Committee twice since August, when Wu turned 
down an offer to be the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) vice 
chairman (Reftel).  Wu said that his decision to join the 
Committee would be contingent on whether or not the Chen 
administration showed it was serious about reducing 
cross-Strait tensions and resuming dialogue with the PRC.  Wu 
said he intends to ask the question directly to Chiou the 
next time they met. 
 
Pan-Blue out of touch with Taiwan 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Wu asserted that he would join the committee even if 
his political patron James Soong objected.  Wu admitted to 
AIT that he had rejected MAC\'s offer to be vice chairman 
solely because of Soong\'s flat disapproval.  However, after a 
period of soul searching, Wu explained, he had despaired over 
how out of touch with \"Taiwan reality\" Soong and current 
Pan-Blue leaders truly were.  Wu said that he traveled 
extensively throughout Taiwan with Soong during the 2000 
election, and heard what Taiwan people in the cities, 
countryside, towns, and villages had to say.  Wu said that it 
was infinitely clear that Taiwan identity is on the rise and 
if it were not for their fear of PRC attack, the people would 
choose independence. 
 
4. (C) Wu said he is baffled by Soong\'s recent declaration 
that there should be no trace of independence sentiment in 
the Pan-Blue.  Wu asserted that Soong heard the same voices 
on Taiwan identity and independence that he did, and at the 
time appeared more open to innovative ideas on cross-Strait 
relations.  Wu claimed that Soong gave him license to think 
creatively, and as a result, Wu wrote a policy paper that 
included the formulation \"Taiwan is the Republic of China, 
the Republic of China is Taiwan\" (Taiwan jiu shi Zhonghua 
Mingguo, Zhonghua Mingguo jiu shi Taiwan). 
 
5. (C) Wu said that he gave Soong and KMT Secretary General 
Lin Fong-cheng the policy paper during the 2004 presidential 
election but they took no action on it.  After the election, 
Wu presented his ideas to KMT Vice Chairman Vincent Siew, and 
Siew promised to propose them at a KMT Central Standing 
Committee (CSC) meeting.  Wu said in frustration, the 
formulation was watered down to \"some meaningless phrase 
about the ROC being the best defense for Taiwan.\"  Wu said he 
feared that the Pan-Blue had no one working on cross-Strait 
policy at the moment, pointing out that former MAC Chairman 
Su Chi was no longer at the National Policy Foundation.  Wu 
asked rhetorically, \"And who is left around James Soong?  PFP 
Policy Chief Chang Hsien-yao?  He stopped thinking when he 
started his LY campaign\" 
 
In Soong\'s defense 
------------------ 
7. (C) While many of Soong\'s once close advisors have 
abandoned the increasing erratic PFP Chairman, PFP Legislator 
and Spokesman Daniel Hwang (Yih-jiau) defended the reasoning 
behind Soong\'s tack to the pro-unification extreme.  Hwang 
told AIT that Soong was convinced that there was no room in 
the Pan-Blue for Taiwan independence sentiments.  Hwang 
explained that the Pan-Blue must rid itself of Lee Teng-hui 
elements because \"any hint of independence thinking would 
cause tensions with the PRC.\"  Hwang continued, \"we do not 
buy ROC equals Taiwan, the ROC is still the union of the 
whole of China.\"  When asked about the Pan-Blue\'s 
presidential campaign promise that independence was an option 
for the future, Hwang replied that \"Wang Jin-pyng said it; 
James Soong did not.\"  Hwang admitted that Soong did say the 
debate should be postponed, but explained that \"postponing 
the debate does not mean that we are going to pursue 
independence.\"  He added that the PFP still stood for 
eventual reunification, but wanted China to catch up 
politically and economically.  Hwang stated that the PFP 
approach has been: \"we will concentrate on the economy and 
act like an ostrich on political issues.\" 
 
Comment: Is Pan-Blue losing out? 
-------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) It will be interesting to see whether any other 
prominent Pan-Blue figures will break rank with the 
leadership and join the DPP\'s cross-Strait committee.  LY 
President and KMT Vice Chairman Wang Jin-pyng told AIT Acting 
Director November 9 that the Pan-Blue will boycott the 
committee as a DPP public relations ploy.  However, that 
characterization would be difficult to sustain should the DPP 
succeed in convincing other serious Pan-Blue cross-Strait 
policy experts to participate.

Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Both political camps are using national 
sovereignty and foreign policy issues to mobilize core 
supporters ahead of the December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) 
elections.  In his first weekend of campaigning, President 
Chen Shui-bian played all sides of the ideological spectrum, 
defending the \"Republic of China\'s\" links with the Mainland 
in one breath and calling for entry into the United Nations 
under the title \"Taiwan\" in another.  Chen may have also 
undermined his recent calls for renewed dialogue with Beijing 
by denouncing the \"1992 consensus\" as a \"consensus of 
surrender\" fabricated by the former KMT government.  Vice 
President Annette Lu and members of Premier Yu Shyi-kun\'s 
cabinet have been even more vocal in their campaign stump 
challenges to the \"ROC\'s\" legitimacy in Taiwan.  While recent 
rhetoric may be destabilizing for cross-Strait relations, it 
appears to having some positive effects for the Pan-Green 
campaign.  Senior KMT moderates complain to AIT that Pan-Blue 
leaders Lien Chan and James Soong have once again left the 
opposition vulnerable on nationalist themes by espousing 
positions that appeal only to hard-core Blue voters.  End 
Summary. 
 
Nationalism and Negativism 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In the first weekend of the official campaign period, 
both camps sharpened their messages in a bid to mobilize core 
supporters.  While individual candidates are mostly 
campaigning on local issues, senior party leaders on both 
sides are emphasizing basic ideological themes to complement 
a constant stream of negative personal attacks.  President 
Chen Shui-bian entered the fray on November 12, delivering 
the first of a planned series of 47 campaign speeches around 
the island.  Despite assurances to AIT by National Security 
Council (NSC) Secretary General Chiou I-jen that Chen would 
stick to \"sentimental\" domestic themes, Chen used his first 
set of campaign appearances to deliver a contradictory set of 
messages on Taiwan\'s sovereignty and foreign policy. 
 
3. (C) President Chen\'s decision to divide DPP campaign 
leadership among the four contenders for future party 
leadership had already created a split personality in the 
Pan-Green effort.  Both Premier Yu Shyi-kun\'s Executive Yuan 
(EY) campaign team and Vice President Annette Lu have 
regularly invoked sensitive issues like establishing a new 
constitution on the campaign trail in recent weeks.  Most 
recently, Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng sparked a loud 
political debate on November 10 when he presented draft 
revisions to Taiwan\'s textbook guidelines that would require 
students to learn about the first decades of the \"ROC\" as 
part of Chinese (vice Taiwan) history.  Tu and Justice 
Minister Chen Ting-nan drew even harsher public criticism 
from the Pan-Blue camp after they supported an assertion by 
Examination Yuan (ExY) President (and pro-independence 
fundamentalist) Yao Chia-wen that ROC founder Sun Yat-sen was 
a \"foreigner.\"  DPP officials, including LY Caucus Leader 
Tsai Huang-lang, tried to distance the party from the history 
 
SIPDIS 
controversy, stressing the DPP\'s respect for Sun Yat-sen and 
his contributions to the \"ROC\'s\" history. 
 
CSB: Something for Everyone 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (C) President Chen Shui-bian entered the debate on 
November 11 by publicly rejecting the 
fundamentalist/Education Ministry attempts to cast doubts on 
the legitimacy of the \"ROC.\"  Chen told a visiting group of 
European business leaders that it was important that Taiwan\'s 
people learn about the \"Republic of China\'s\" experience in 
Mainland China before 1949 as well as its rule in Taiwan 
after the Chinese civil war.  In a November 13 speech in 
Taipei City, Chen praised Sun Yat-sen as the \"country\'s 
founder\" and embraced the \"ROC\" flag as the \"country\'s flag.\" 
 At a Taichung County rally, Chen touted his government\'s 
willingness to engage in dialogue with the PRC on the basis 
of the \"Hong Kong talks.\"  However, Chen used the same speech 
to deny the existence of a \"1992 consensus,\" terming the 
concept a KMT fabrication that amounted to a \"surrender 
consensus.\"  At a November 12 speech in Tainan, Chen also 
reiterated his recent formulation (Reftel) that \"the PRC is a 
different country... it is a foreign country,\" adding in the 
same breath that \"we should learn about Taiwan history before 
we learn about foreign history.\"  Chen also brought out 
appeals last used before the presidential election for a \"New 
Taiwan Constitution\" that would allow the island to become a 
\"normal country.\" 
 
\"Taiwan\'s\" New Diplomatic Strategy 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) During the Tainan rally, Chen also suggested a new 
approach to foreign policy.  Criticizing the \"sucker 
diplomatic strategy\" he inherited from the KMT, Chen pledged 
to end the practice of paying for diplomatic relationships. 
Potentially more problematic was Chen\'s announcement at a 
November 14 rally in Keelung that Taiwan would seek entry 
into the United Nations under the name of \"Taiwan.\"  Chen 
reportedly told the crowd that the issue of \"China\'s 
representative\" at the UN was resolved long ago, but the 
problem of \"Taiwan\'s representative\" remained outstanding. 
(Comment: Chen raised the possibility of applying for UNGA 
membership under the name \"Taiwan\" during a September 15 
videoconference with UN-based journalists, but at that time 
he asserted that this would be akin to the \"two Germany\'s/two 
Koreas model\" and would not preclude future PRC-Taiwan 
integration.  End Comment.) 
 
Pan-Blue: Self-Inflicted Wounds? 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) KMT Senior Vice Chairman (and former Premier) Vincent 
Siew complained that Chen\'s campaign rhetoric would further 
undermine cross-Strait ties.  \"Chen has never matured into 
the role of president,\" Siew continued, \"he doesn\'t realize 
that at a certain point you need to remain above the fray and 
focus on the national interest.\"  However, Siew placed part 
of the blame on the Pan-Blue leadership\'s inability to 
articulate a position that would prevent the Chen and the DPP 
from constantly using the nationalism issue for electoral 
gain.  \"The problem isn\'t a policy divide over independence 
or unification,\" Siew asserted, \"it is simply that from 
Changhua County (in central Taiwan) on south, the Green is 
seen as the party of Taiwan and the Blue as the party of 
China.\"  Siew said that ethnic Mainlander, 
unification-leaning people make up only 20 percent of the 
traditional Pan-Blue support base, but a full 80 percent of 
the leadership, including key officials surrounding KMT 
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman 
James Soong.  \"For most Taiwanese, they are the face of the 
Pan-Blue,\" Siew added.  Siew noted that in this election, 
candidates from central and southern Taiwan have asked that 
Lien and Soong not appear in public with them for fear of 
losing votes. 
 
7. (C) Fellow KMT Vice Chairman and LY President Wang 
Jin-pyng separately offered a similar assessment.  He blamed 
Soong\'s insistence on solidifying ethnic Mainlander votes 
behind the PFP for the Pan-Blue\'s decision to come out 
against the USD 18 billion special procurement budget for the 
purchase of U.S. weapons systems, a decision that has led 
Chen and other DPP officials to label the opposition parties 
as PRC puppets.  \"Mainlanders oppose the budget in far 
greater numbers than ethnic Taiwanese,\" Wang asserted, \"it 
was a decision based purely on electoral calculations.\"  Wang 
acknowledged that the KMT\'s acquiescence to Soong\'s hard-line 
position was opposed by many KMT moderates.  However, Wang 
told AIT that the senior KMT leadership decided it was more 
important to project an image of Pan-Blue unity by accepting 
the PFP\'s approach. 
 
Comment: Same Vicious Circle 
---------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Electoral politics may once again have undermined 
prospects for cross-Strait progress.  In recent weeks Chen 
himself has publicly and privately emphasized the importance 
of taking a low profile between now and the election in order 
to create an environment for renewed cross-Strait contacts 
next Spring.  His actions on the campaign trail raise 
questions about his commitment to such an opening.  While the 
Pan-Blue may bear some responsibility for once again ceding 
the political center to the DPP, Chen could have easily sat 
this election out if his real priority were cross-Strait 
stability.  With both sides privately telling AIT that the 
election may hinge on mobilizing core supporters to get out 
and vote, divisive rhetoric is only likely to increase in the 
final three weeks of the campaign.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U) Summary: A persistent complaint of multinational 
firms in Taiwan is the difficulty of bringing PRC employees 
to Taiwan for meetings, training, research, or other 
temporary assignment.  Some firms have learned how to work 
the system and bring a relatively large number of Mainland 
employees to Taiwan on a regular basis.  However, many firms 
complain that the process requires too much documentation, 
takes too long, and does not meet the needs of multinational 
firms even when it works.  The Taiwan government has taken 
some steps to improve the process and has more changes on the 
drawing board that will address some of the problems but not 
all of them.  As in other areas of cross-Strait commerce, 
many firms have found a way to get what they need within the 
limitations of a flawed system.  Nevertheless, if the Taiwan 
government doesn\'t get serious soon about liberalizing this 
and other obstacles in its cross-Strait economic relations, 
the trend toward marginalization will continue.  (End 
summary.) 
 
 
Perennial Problem Becoming More Important 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Multinationals with offices in Taiwan have long 
complained about the restrictions Taiwan imposes on PRC 
employee travel to Taiwan.  This problem was highlighted in 
the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei\'s annual white 
paper in 2004 as well as previous years.  The European 
Chamber of Commerce highlighted this issue in its White Paper 
issued in October 2004.  Multi-nationals point out that these 
impediments make it hard to do business in Taiwan, 
particularly for firms trying to manage greater China or East 
Asian operations from a Taiwan headquarters.  As more firms 
invest in the Mainland and the PRC labor market grows more 
competitive, the need to bring PRC employees to Taiwan, 
especially for training, grows more important. 
 
It Can be Done 
-------------- 
 
3.  (C) Despite the difficulties, some multinational firms 
have learned to navigate the system and bring Mainland 
employees to Taiwan on a regular basis.  Taiwan\'s Ford 
subsidiary, for example, brought about 100 employees to 
Taiwan last year for training and will bring about the same 
number this year.  United Airlines on the other hand, brought 
two employees over in 2003 for training and since decided it 
was too difficult and time consuming to do so again. 
Motorola brings a handful of Mainland employees to Taiwan 
each year but uses a consulting firm to process the Taiwan 
entry permits for them.  In all, multinationals in Taiwan 
brought 816 Mainland visitors in the first ten months of 2004 
compared to 381 during all of 2003.  Taiwan firms, which are 
subject to more restrictions than multinationals, brought 971 
visitors through October this year and 227 in 2003.  By 
comparison, thousands of Taiwan businessmen fly to and from 
the PRC every day. 
 
Too Many Documents 
------------------ 
 
4.  (U) The Taiwan government requires an inordinate number 
of documents for entry permit applications for PRC nationals 
employed by Taiwan-owned firms or multinationals operating on 
the Mainland.  For professional employees (who must have 
worked for the multinational or Taiwan-owned firm for at 
least three months) coming to Taiwan for a short visit, an 
application and at least nine other documents are required. 
The documentation required to show the legitimacy of the 
inviting company and its investment in the PRC is 
particularly burdensome.  The firm must provide copies of the 
Taiwan company license; Taiwan income tax report for the 
previous year; letter of authorization to invest in the PRC 
and notification of investment )- for Taiwan firms )- or 
documentation showing that the firm\'s Taiwan presence is a 
foreign investment )- for multi-nationals; PRC business 
license; and PRC business authorization certificate. 
Clearly, Taiwan officials are aware of the burdensome nature 
of the process.  When AIT officers ask simple questions about 
how the process works, the response generally includes an 
offer to help facilitate the process if AIT would like to 
refer cases to Taiwan agencies. 
 
It Takes Too Long 
----------------- 
 
5.  (C) The Taiwan government claims that for routine cases 
entry permits can be issued to PRC employees of multinational 
firms in ten working days once all the documents have been 
gathered.  However, multi-national firms report that the 
Taiwan government rarely meets the ten-day approval goal. 
Taiwan offers a \"one-stop\" window for entry permit 
applications at the Bureau of Immigration.  However, the 
Bureau of Immigration must then distribute the application to 
the agencies that must also approve it, namely the Mainland 
Affairs Council (MAC) and local police in the jurisdiction 
where the visitor will stay.  According to Robert Wang, 
government programs executive for IBM Taiwan, the Bureau of 
Immigration will not ensure that other agencies meet the 
ten-day time limit.  Wang reported that the process is often 
delayed by local police visits to the inviting company or 
even the home of the sponsoring individual.  IBM brought 
about 30 employees to Taiwan in 2003 and will bring more by 
the end of 2004.  In Wang\'s experience, approval of the entry 
permit usually takes about a month. 
 
6.  (C) In addition, after Taiwan approves the entry permit, 
the inviting firm must then apply for a PRC exit permit. 
Businesses in Taiwan report that the PRC exit permit 
application cannot be submitted without the approved Taiwan 
entry permit, so the two cannot be processed simultaneously, 
substantially lengthening the entire process.  Businesses 
report that approval of the PRC exit permit takes up to a 
month.  According to Y.M. Yen, Employee Services Manager of 
Ford Lio Ho Motor Company, Taiwan\'s Ford subsidiary, even a 
firm that has considerable experience navigating this process 
like Ford needs at least two months to prepare the paperwork 
and obtain the entry and exit permits.  For a firm new to the 
system it can take six months. 
 
Too Many Limitations 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Unfortunately, even after the time and trouble 
involved in getting an entry permit, multinational firms 
still complain that what the Taiwan government offers doesn\'t 
meet their needs.  First, Taiwan generally only issues single 
entry permits for stays of short duration.  For most business 
travelers the entry permit allows a two-month stay extendable 
up to a total of four months.  For intra-company transfers or 
technological research, longer stays are allowed.  However, 
in nearly all cases, Taiwan will only issue a single-entry 
travel document, which is renewable in some cases.  This is 
particularly burdensome for visitors staying for longer 
durations, but causes problems for short-term travel as well. 
 It does nothing for executives and senior technical and 
marketing staff who need the ability to travel frequently. 
 
8.  (U) In addition, except for transferees and researchers, 
Taiwan will not issue travel documents for spouses or other 
family members who wish to accompany the visitor.  Businesses 
find this limitation especially problematic for longer-term 
trainees who may be staying in Taiwan for up to four months. 
Furthermore, even for long-term visitors, Taiwan has no 
system in place at this time to provide work permits.  This 
can prevent long-term visitors from opening a bank account, 
renting an apartment, obtaining a driver\'s license, etc. 
Finally, the number of entry permits issued to employees of a 
single firm each year is limited for some firms.  Many 
multinationals, depending on the size of their presence in 
Taiwan, are not subject to a quota.  All Taiwan-owned firms 
have a quota based on the amount of capital the firm has 
invested in Taiwan.  The maximum quota is 30 visits per year, 
a minuscule fraction of the number of trips employees of any 
of these companies take to the PRC in a year. 
 
Reformed Already, More on the Way 
--------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) The Taiwan government has made some effort to 
simplify the process of applying for Taiwan entry permits and 
reduce the time required for approval.  A package of 
simplifications was approved in 2002.  MAC Department of 
Economic Affairs Director Fu Don-cheng told AIT that another 
set of reforms is awaiting Executive Yuan approval and should 
be implemented within the next two months.  He would not 
provide a copy of the proposed changes, but said they 
included simplification of the application form, lengthening 
the maximum stay for most short term visitors to six months, 
allowing spouses and one other relative to accompany 
short-term visitors, and expanding the quota that Taiwan and 
some foreign-owned firms are subject to.  He said the 
proposed reforms should be available within the next two 
weeks.  We will report on the proposed changes septel when 
they are released.  In addition, the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs recently announced that PRC employees of high-tech 
firms with special skills will be able to apply for permanent 
residency after a two year stay in Taiwan.  The Council of 
Labor Affairs is also working on a proposal to grant work 
permits to PRC employees on long-term temporary assignment in 
Taiwan that should be implemented sometime next year. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C) As in other areas of cross-Strait commerce, many 
firms have found a way to get what they need within the 
limitations of a flawed system.  The market has also stepped 
in to help them as demonstrated by the availability of 
consulting services to assist in obtaining entry permits. 
Nevertheless, the entry permit process for Mainland visitors 
is another example of how Taiwan\'s cross-Strait restrictions 
reduce Taiwan\'s competitiveness.  Others include lack of 
direct air links, import bans, prohibited categories of 
investment, and currency exchange restrictions.  These 
impediments make Taiwan firms less competitive when it comes 
to taking advantage of business opportunities in the 
Mainland, and discourage foreign firms from conducting 
greater China business from Taiwan.  Many observers believe 
that multinationals are increasingly bypassing Taiwan 
altogether as a small market on the fringe of China.  As a 
result, Taiwan firms that want to remain competitive in 
regional and world markets face growing pressure to move 
management and other operations to the Mainland along with 
manufacturing.  If the Taiwan government doesn\'t get serious 
soon about liberalizing this and other obstacles in its 
cross-Strait economic relations, the trend toward 
marginalization will continue.  (End comment.)

A) \"A Strategic Chess Piece That Can Be Given up 
Anytime\" 
 
Professor Chu Yun-han of National Taiwan University\'s 
Department of Political Science noted in the \"Weekly 
Comment\" column of the centrist, pro-status quo \"China 
Times\" (11/15): 
 
\". In the National Security Council, President Chen 
recently delivered a ten-point announcement in an 
attempt to diffuse the negative effects triggered by 
his `National Day Address.\'  Although the Taipei 
administration tried to play down the striking remarks 
that Secretary of State Colin Powell made in Beijing, 
they have sensed the policy adjustment regarding the 
cross-Strait situation that is being initiated by 
Washington.  President Chen\'s `ten-point\' initiative 
may clear up international worries that Taiwan might 
develop weapons of mass destruction and preclude the 
[possibility] that Beijing may use [these worries] as 
an excuse for a first strike.  However, in the midst of 
the political and cultural constructions in Taiwan that 
are aiming for the building of a new nation, these 
decorative declarations can neither extinguish the 
anger of Beijing leaders nor relieve the anxiety in 
Washington. 
 
\"Top-level visits to Beijing from Washington have been 
frequent this year because the Americans are aware that 
preventive diplomacy as well as preventive defense 
measures have gradually grown ineffective.  Neither the 
strengthening of the forward military deployment in the 
West Pacific Region nor the management of seven carrier 
fleets for real time global exercises can successfully 
suppress the thought that `a cross-Strait war is 
unavoidable\' in the Beijing leaders\' minds.  Neither 
the sending of an envoy to persuade Taipei [to be 
prudent] nor the expression of disagreement by the U.S 
president can stop the Taiwanese from testing the 
bottom line of Beijing\'s tolerance.  Given the 
development of these trends, the United States will be 
forced, sooner or later, to choose between the worst 
scenarios, namely, either to compete with Beijing 
militarily and engage in an unlimited and unimaginable 
millennium war, or to force Taipei to sign a treaty in 
recognition of Beijing\'s sovereignty over Taiwan and, 
thus, reduce the leadership credentials in East Asia 
and [allow the beginning] of a hegemonic transition [in 
the region]. 
 
\"Only the two worst options are left for the United 
States.  The reason is that once the People\'s 
Liberation Army takes the ASAP strategy to attack 
Taiwan, the [only] remaining effective option for the 
United States is militarily intervention due to 
Taiwan\'s weak defensive capabilities as well as the 
fragile domestic psychology and economic 
infrastructure.  Some experts have already made private 
predictions, after objective analysis, that the only 
realistic strategic option for the United States is to 
abandon Taiwan\'s position of self-determination [in the 
face of otherwise] unimaginable consequences, 
unbearable costs and risks that Americans would 
otherwise confront . . 
 
 
\"It is expected that the decision-making circle in 
Washington is now very concerned about the cross-Strait 
situation, and this is not simply because the United 
States is already too busy handling the difficult 
situation in Iraq or because it needs to rely on China 
to help resolve the nuclear crisis on the Korean 
Peninsula.  The cross-Strait issue will be the greatest 
diplomatic challenge for President George W. Bush 
during his second term because once this potential 
crisis breaks out, it will create the most severe 
challenge to the United States\' strategic leadership in 
East Asia.  If the United States fails to control the 
situation and is forced to make a choice between the 
two worst scenarios, it would be practically like 
making an announcement of a major setback in U.S. 
foreign policy, and this is something that the current 
U.S. foreign policy makers would definitely try to 
avoid.  Thus, Washington needs to start taking some 
preventive measures that it did not want to take before 
to try every means it can to prevent the cross-Strait 
situation from getting out of control. 
 
\"Secretary Powell\'s rigid remarks in Beijing that 
`Taiwan is not independent and it does not enjoy 
sovereignty as a nation\' have reluctantly given away 
all the ambiguity that the United States hoped to 
maintain over the past two decades.  This means that 
for the decision makers in Washington, since they could 
not expect the leaders in Taipei to strictly abide by 
the `four No\'s\' policy, the United States is then 
forced to set a clearer and tighter framework for 
Taipei.  The framework is quite obvious as [we] look at 
Powell\'s comments together with Assistant Secretary of 
State James Kelly\'s policy announcement that `the 
United States is opposed to any unilateral attempt to 
change the status quo, a status quo that is defined by 
the United States.\'  To put it in plain language, it 
means that `the status quo as defined by the United 
States\' is `Taiwan is not independent and that it does 
not enjoy sovereignty as a nation.\'  If Taiwan tries to 
use political actions to assure its independence and 
sovereign status, it would mean it is attempting to 
alter the status quo defined by the United States. . 
 
\". U.S. decision makers have began to sense that the 
situation\'s development has forced them to re-evaluate 
Taiwan\'s value on a strategic scale.  Once the costs 
and risks to protect Taiwan have evidently outweighed 
the limits that the United States can sustain, it would 
have to give up the strategic chess piece [Taiwan] 
overnight.\" 
 
B) \"Seize the Opportunity for Peace\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
editorialized (11/13): 
 
\". Taiwan saw Chen [Shui-bian] win a second term in 
March.  In the US, President George W. Bush has also 
just won a second term, and in China, President Hu 
Jintao recently consolidated party, government and 
military power in his hands.  In all three nations, 
power has been confirmed, making this the best time to 
seek cross-Strait peace. 
 
\"The US has already said that Chen\'s 10-point 
initiative `lays the foundation\' for progress toward 
resumption of dialogue.  But we hope that when Bush and 
Hu meet in Chile for APEC summit later this month, they 
will also accept the participation of Taiwan\'s special 
envoy Lee Yuan-tseh to engage in three-sided talks over 
the 10 points, opening up a new opportunity for peace 
across the Taiwan Strait.\"

1. Summary. In July 2004, Taiwan\'s Environmental Protection 
Administration (TEPA) introduced a draft rule to limit 
excessive packaging.  In response to industry opposition to 
the rule, TEPA issued a  revised draft of the rule on 
October 12.  As reported in ref A, the second draft is much 
narrower in scope than the original. Costco and Proctor and 
Gamble, which initially strongly opposed the rule, are now 
both satisfied with the changes and with TEPA\'s response to 
their concerns.  End Summary. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2.  As reported in Refs A-D, TEPA is eager to finalize 
regulations to restrict excessive packaging of goods in 
order to reduce waste, and move Taiwan towards its ultimate 
goal of complete recycling and zero waste by 2020. 
Initially TEPA was hoping to finalize the rule by September 
2004.  However, in part due to the strong negative reaction 
of foreign industry as reported in reftel B, TEPA has 
redrafted the rule and postponed its time-line for 
implementation. 
 
US COMPANIES SATISFIED WITH CHANGES 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.  As reported in Ref A, the second draft of the rule 
issued on October 12 significantly narrowed the scope of the 
rule.  Following the issuance of the draft, AIT informed 
both AmCham and key US companies of the changes and of the 
deadline to comment.  In anticipation of the comment 
deadline at the end of this month, AIT followed up with the 
two US companies, which had expressed the most opposition 
to the initial draft of the rule.  Those companies, Costco 
and Proctor and Gamble, are now both satisfied with the 
changes to the rule and with TEPA\'s willingness to work with 
them to accommodate their concerns.  Neither company plans 
to submit any formal comments as all of their major concerns 
have already been addressed.

\"President Chen\'s [Practice of] Informing the United 
States Before He Makes Announcements on Cross-Strait 
Policy Has Become Standard Practice\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
editorialized (11/16): 
 
\". Evidently, the consistent context as well as the 
central theme manifested in President Chen\'s `inaugural 
speech,\' `National Day address,\' and his `announcement 
at the National Security Council\' are: the United 
States wants President Chen to publicly announce that 
he will accept using the `1992 consensus\' to deal with 
the `one China\' issue.  This [request] is different 
from [Chen\'s announcement of] the `five No\'s\' policy. 
The `five No\'s\' policy is simply a request asking 
President Chen to pledge what he will not do, but now 
the [United States] wants Chen to say affirmatively 
that he accepts the \'1992 consensus\' and \'one China 
[policy].\' . 
 
\"Within just one month, the United States has twice 
asked President Chen to make a formal announcement in 
public; Washington\'s concerns over the cross-Strait 
situation are thus perceived.  Likewise, Chen\'s 
predicament is also made evident by the fact that he 
had to make a public announcement twice within one 
month at the request of the United States, and his 
second announcement was even a supplement to and 
revision of his first one. . 
 
\"[National Security Council Secretary-General] Chiou I- 
jen said the United States will talk with Beijing from 
its perspective over Chen\'s overture at the National 
Security Council.  What Chiou was saying was that 
[Taipei] has done what the United States requested and 
it is now up to Washington as to how it will promote 
Chen\'s `goodwill gesture\' to Beijing. 
 
\"For President Chen, it is easy for Washington to put 
words into his mouth and ask him to say in public 
whatever the United States wants him to say. 
Nonetheless, whether Chen\'s remarks will have any 
positive effect does not really rely on the United 
States; rather, it depends on President Chen . .\"

SUBJECT: A DPP PERSPECTIVE ON TAIWAN ETHNIC POLITICS 
 
REF: TAIPEI 3604 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason 1.4 (B/D) 
 
 1. (C) Summary: The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) 
believes it could benefit in the December legislative 
election from its efforts to define and build a Taiwan 
identity that is \"multi-cultural,\" and it aims to broaden the 
appeal of the DPP beyond its traditional ethnic Taiwanese 
base of support.  Long seen by the Taiwan electorate as a 
party representing primarily ethnic Taiwanese (benshengren) 
interests, the DPP is increasingly trying to appeal to Hakka 
and Aborigine minorities.  DPP outreach to the Hakka and 
Aborigine populations -- estimated at 22 per cent of Taiwan\'s 
total population -- were effective in garnering support for 
President Chen Shui-bian during the presidential elections 
this spring.  DPP officials say their party continues to make 
inroads into the grass-roots organizations of these minority 
ethnic groups that traditionally had been heavily 
pro-Kuomintang (KMT) and are projecting that the DPP will 
expand its support in those constituencies.  Most DPP 
strategists, however, are content with playing the Taiwanese 
versus Mainlander ethnic card and painting the opposition 
Pan-Blue camp, especially the People First Party (PFP), as 
dominated by Mainlander Chinese.  End Summary. 
 
Building a Taiwan Identity for \"Everyone\" 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) DPP Director for Ethnic Affairs Yang Chang-cheng told 
AIT on November 8 that President Chen articulated in his May 
20 and October 10 speeches a vision for a more open, 
tolerant, and unified society with deeper roots in Taiwan. 
Chen\'s aim, according to Yang, is to lay a foundation from 
which to reconstruct Taiwan\'s national identity.  Yang 
asserted that such a project will entail redefining Chinese 
culture and its role within a new Taiwan national identity. 
He said one of the key challenges would be going beyond the 
narrow vision many Taiwanese intellectuals present of an 
ethnic Taiwanese-centric identity and to avoid continuing to 
alienate ethnic Mainlanders from the DPP cause. 
 
Wooing the Hakka Vote 
--------------------- 
 
3. (C) The more pragmatic side of the DPP offers a vision of 
a \"multi-ethnic\" Taiwan identity in order to expand the DPP\'s 
appeal to Taiwan\'s Hakka population, which comprises about 20 
percent of the island\'s inhabitants and is key to the DPP\'s 
efforts to build a lasting majority.  Yang said that that DPP 
expects to pick up 30 to 40 percent of the Hakka vote in 
Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Miaoli counties where Hakka make up 40, 
70, and 67 percent of the population, respectively.  He 
projected that support levels for DPP candidates as a whole 
in these areas are unlikely to exceed the 40 percent mark 
reached in the 2004 presidential election.  Yang attributed 
growing DPP support among Hakka communities to the extensive 
attention President Chen has paid to promoting Hakka issues 
and interests, both at the local and national level, such as 
the promotion of Hakka language, television shows, and 
cultural activities.  Hakka leaders have been \"pleasantly 
surprised\" with Chen\'s support for the Hakka since 2000. 
Yang stated that DPP-backed Hakka candidates are unlikely to 
run campaigns exclusively along ethnic lines for fear of 
alienating potential support from ethnic Taiwanese. 
 
Making Inroads with Aborigines 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) The DPP\'s outreach efforts to Taiwan\'s aboriginal 
peoples have enjoyed less success.  Yang highlighted DPP 
difficulty in penetrating the existing tribal-based 
grassroots political networks that largely continue to feed 
into the Pan-Blue camp.  Nevertheless, Yang projected that 
the DPP is sure to pick up one aborigine seat from the plains 
districts and has a good chance of picking up another seat 
from the mountain districts.  Any gains among the aborigine 
vote would be a big achievement since the DPP currently has 
no legislators from the aborigine districts. 
 
But Writing off the Mainlanders, For Now 
---------------------------------------- 
5. (C) The DPP rhetorical appeal to a more inclusive Taiwan 
identity and national polity has largely failed to win much 
support with the ethnic Mainlander electorate or even among 
DPP campaign officials.  Yang said most of his colleagues 
planning DPP election strategy do not actively discuss how to 
win over the ethnic Mainlander vote, which they see as a lost 
voting block.  In many areas, the DPP continues to promote 
subtle \"ethnic Taiwanese-first\" themes to draw attention to 
the Mainlander-dominated leadership of the Pan-Blue.  For 
example, during the presidential campaign many DPP posters 
urged voters to \"elect a Taiwanese (Taiwanren) president,\" 
playing on the popular perception that KMT candidate Lien 
Chan, who was born on the Mainland to a Taiwanese father and 
Mainland mother, is at best only a \"half-Taiwanese.\"  Senior 
ethnic Taiwanese KMT officials regularly complain to AIT that 
the DPP is increasingly successful in eroding the KMT\'s 
ethnic Taiwanese base.  However, many KMT moderates assert 
that the anti-mainstream policies of the KMT leadership 
contribute at least as much to this trend as divisive DPP 
ethnic appeals (Reftel). 
 
6. (C) While the DPP has generally written off Mainlanders 
for the December election, the party will be sponsoring a 
series of conferences next year to start a dialogue with 
ethnic Mainlanders so as to not alienate them permanently 
from the DPP or marginalize them from participating in the 
national polity.  Yang said he expects President Chen to 
renew his efforts to appeal to Mainlanders after the December 
elections.  Separately, Taipei County Magistrate Lin Hsi-yao 
told AIT that the DPP will at least try in the medium term to 
minimize hostility among ethnic Mainlanders to the ruling 
party.  Lin, a confidante of Presidential Office Secretary 
General Su Tseng-chang, asserted that Su has already decided 
that when (and if) he is appointed Premier, he will choose 
ethnic Mainlander Finance Minister Lin Chuan as his deputy to 
demonstrate that the DPP is not only a party of and for 
Taiwanese.  Lin\'s moderate DPP New Tide faction has been 
particularly aggressive in promoting Mainlander members.  The 
faction\'s current leader, Tuan I-kang and DPP Deputy 
Secretary General (and New Tide member) Chung Chia-bing, are 
 
SIPDIS 
both ethnic Mainlanders. 
 
Ethnic Politics: The Final Frontier 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Comment: The DPP\'s push to win over ethnic minorities 
is a major change from its past \"ethnic Taiwanese-first\" 
focus and a key element of its plan to establish a 
sustainable ruling base.  Minority politics used to be the 
preserve of the KMT, which effectively used resources and 
personnel appointments to secure support from aborigine and 
Hakka communities.  As in many other areas, the DPP is taking 
a page out of the KMT\'s book, lavishly spending government 
funds to promote Hakka and aboriginal culture and appointing 
minorities, like Hakka Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan, to senior 
positions in government.  While this approach seems to be 
showing some results, especially with the Hakka community, 
Mainlanders will remain a hard target.  For many Mainlanders, 
aversion to the DPP is not only a matter of ethnicity but 
extends to the DPP\'s core Taiwan-first ideology.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/12/2014 
TAGS: PGOV, ECON, TW 
SUBJECT: TWO VIEWS OF TAIWAN\'S MEDIA AND THEIR POLITICAL 
USES 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal; Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary. A recent report authored by the KMT\'s 
National Policy Foundation (NPF) alleges that the Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP), via the Government Information 
Office (GIO), is manipulating Taiwan\'s media and suppressing 
negative press reporting through its authority to regulate 
the media licensing process.  The report also claims that 
Taiwan\'s media outlets are reluctant to go too far in 
criticizing the government because they rely on advertising 
revenue from government-owned banks and enterprises.  GIO 
officials maintain that these claims by the NPF are baseless 
and that the GIO operates within the laws of the 1976 
Broadcasting and Television Act.  The GIO asserts media 
reform is long overdue and that reform efforts are targeting 
all underground stations and not just those that are pro-DPP. 
 They also added that the GIO\'s advertising budget 
compromises only about 2 percent of Taiwan\'s entire 
advertising budget.  End summary. 
 
GIO Implementing Media Reforms 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) Taiwan\'s GIO has embarked on a broadcasting 
reorganization plan that aims to restructure public-owned 
radio networks and reorganize the distribution of 
frequencies.  The plan also calls for the easing of the 
process for \"underground radio\" stations to register legally 
with the government.  The opposition has criticized the plan 
because it will require some KMT controlled broadcasting 
companies, particularly the Broadcasting Corporation of China 
(BCC), to return some of its existing frequencies to the 
government for redistribution in the media market. 
Legislation was also passed last year that bars the 
government and political parties from owning or running media 
organizations and calls for the creation of a National 
Communications Commission (NCC) to replace the GIO in 
overseeing the operations of the broadcast media.  The NCC is 
expected to begin operations in 2005. 
 
KMT Unhappy with Reforms 
------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) KMT supporters argue that the DPP, under the auspices 
of the GIO, is interfering with the media and undermining the 
freedom of the press in Taiwan.  Professor of Journalism 
Huang-fu Ho-wang, one of the contributors to the NPF report, 
met with AIT to articulate his concerns regarding perceived 
DPP abuses against KMT controlled media outlets and the 
general state of the press in Taiwan.  Huang-fu lamented that 
never has the GIO been so powerful and that it is abusing its 
power in the radio and television station licensing process. 
As a member of the GIO licensing committee for 6 years in the 
1990s, Huang-fu stated he is fully aware of the license 
renewal process and that the GIO is operating illegally in 
terms of how it is taking back radio station frequencies from 
the BCC.  He alleged that the DPP is trying to retaliate 
against media outlets run by the KMT and is only seeking to 
help those unlicensed radio stations become legitimate that 
helped President Chen during the election campaign. 
 
GIO Claims Actions are Legal 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) GIO officials maintained that the GIO operates 
according to the Broadcasting and Television Act of 1976, 
which was passed under the KMT.  AIT met with Tseng Yi-hung, 
the GIO\'s Deputy Director of Broadcasting Affairs, and 
Chi-shen Ho from the GIO\'s Department of Radio and Television 
Affairs, to discuss the NPF accusations.  Under the act of 
1976, the GIO is authorized to renew licenses for local 
television and radio stations every two years and according 
to Tseng, the GIO has never in its history revoked the 
license of any radio or television station.  Tseng pointed 
out that the GIO has been planning to promote media reform 
for a long time and that this year was the optimal time 
because the GIO is currently reviewing station licenses.  The 
BCC has the largest number of frequencies in Taiwan, and had 
agreed in 1992 (under the KMT) to return 14 frequencies that 
had been previously used to block radio broadcasting from 
mainland China.  Tseng added that the BCC already had agreed 
to give up these frequencies several years ago and even after 
the reforms, they will still be the largest radio network in 
Taiwan.  Despite the 1992 agreement, the KMT has complained 
about the manner in which the GIO is forcing the BCC to sell 
the frequencies and the requirement that the frequencies 
cannot be sold to a foreign investor, the result of which 
makes the properties\' value significantly reduced. 
 
5.  (C) Concerning the issue of streamlining the licensing 
process for underground stations, Tseng noted that these 
underground stations have been a problem for several years 
and that they do not pay taxes and are unregulated.  Thus, 
the GIO decided it would be in Taiwan\'s best interest to find 
a way to legalize these stations.  In response to AIT 
questions about the DPP loyalty of these stations, Tseng said 
that these illegal stations are located throughout Taiwan and 
not just in the DPP-leaning south.  Tseng said that it is 
simply untrue that their efforts are benefiting pro-DPP 
stations because the new process will allow all underground 
stations, including pro-KMT stations, to become legal. 
(Note: We have no information available on the actual 
locations of these underground stations to confirm if the 
majority are in the south as claimed by the NPF.  End note). 
 
 
Media Market too Saturated? 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Huang-fu also charged that Taiwan\'s relatively small 
media market is unable to support its large broadcasting and 
print media industry.  He argued that because Taiwan\'s media 
outlets are so numerous, there is intense competition for 
advertising revenue.  As such, media companies are reluctant 
to go too far in criticizing the government because stations 
and newspapers are reliant on government funds for 
advertising revenue and government banks to provide loans. 
Huang-fu said this situation allows the government to use its 
political influence and financial leverage to interfere with 
media reporting to ensure positive coverage.  He commented on 
the case of the China Times, where according to Huang-fu, 
since legal actions were taken against one of its reporters, 
the paper had become less critical of the government. 
Huang-fu is certain that the paper is under financial 
pressure after it acquired loans from banks, which he claims 
are under the control of the DPP.  (Note: In 2001, the China 
Times laid off personnel.  We have no information available 
to confirm the paper\'s current financial situation.  However, 
the paper\'s circulation has dropped from number one to number 
three over the past two years.  End note). 
 
7.  (C) Tseng agreed that Taiwan\'s media market is 
substantial considering the small size of the island.  But he 
commented that this is an example of how Taiwan\'s press is 
open and represents the full spectrum of views within 
society.  In terms of government influence in the market 
through advertising, Tseng told AIT the GIO\'s advertising 
budget totaled about $30 million (NT$1 billion).  The budget 
is focused on publishing new government policies or 
administrative measures--like SARS awareness last year. 
According to Tseng, this budget accounts for only 4 percent 
of the television and radio advertising market of $735-880 
million (NT$25-30 billion) and less than 2 percent of the 
entire media advertising market of $1.75 billion (NT$60 
billion) in Taiwan. 
 
DPP Using Other Tools to Influence? 
---------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Huang-fu also asserted that the DPP is tightening 
control of the media through other organizations such as the 
Taiwan Advertiser\'s Association (TAA) and the Broadcasting 
Development Fund (BDF).  Huang-fu characterized these 
organizations as political arms of the DPP which are being 
used to influence the media.  The TAA is composed of 33 
private corporations, which formed the organization in 2000, 
to encourage quality media programs and accurate reporting. 
Huang-fu noted that most of the corporations who are members 
of the TAA donated heavily to the DPP during the recent 
election campaign.  The BDF is financed from the tax revenue 
of radio and TV stations and designed to promote television 
and radio station interests.  Huang-fu said that the 
organization merely serves as a DPP pawn used to reward 
pro-DPP station owners with cash. 
 
9.  (C) Tseng pointed out that the TAA is a private 
organization with a broad goal of improving local television 
and radio programs.  The government has no influence who 
joins, and any corporation is eligible to participate.  Tseng 
said many of the member corporations are not involved in the 
TAA\'s decision making process and do not always agree with 
the TAA\'s recommendations.  As far as the BDF is concerned, 
Tseng noted the BDF has seen its revenues drop from about $15 
 
SIPDIS 
million (NT$500 million) in 2002 to $300,000 (NT$10 million) 
in 2003 due to Taiwan\'s economic slowdown.  He claimed that 
the BDF has little influence or ability to change government 
policies and does not play a significant role in influencing 
actual programming. 
 
Final Thoughts 
-------------- 
 
10.  (C) Tseng summed up the government\'s position by saying 
the GIO is merely trying to make much needed reforms to 
Taiwan\'s media industry and denied that the GIO is abusing 
its power.  Doing so would raise criticism not only 
lawmakers, but also from the public at large since the media 
business is so transparent.  According to Tseng, if the GIO 
were really trampling the free press on behalf of the DPP, 
all of Taiwan and the world would be able to see it.  Tseng 
also said that media reform is a controversial task and not 
everyone is going to be happy.  He speculated that many in 
the KMT are likely unhappy because these reforms are being 
carried out as quickly as possible.  Huang-fu\'s final remarks 
were centered on that he is not a KMT member, but concerned 
for all the people in Taiwan.  He wanted to emphasize that 
everything in the NPF report that he and his colleagues used 
was publicly available.  This was not a partisan witch-hunt 
comprised of made up events designed to criticize the DPP. 
Huang-fu said that he and his colleagues only wanted to show 
the public what was happening to the free press in Taiwan. 
 
Comment: Lots of Smoke 
---------------------- 
 
11. (C) The DPP has used EY advertising funds for political 
ends in the past, most notably during the 2004 presidential 
election when EY-sponsored ads were indistinguishable from 
party campaign commercials.  Proof of more insidious media 
manipulation, however, is harder to come by. In a report 
released in October, Taiwan was ranked 60th among 167 
countries and areas for press freedom by the Reporters 
without Borders organization. There is no doubt that the 
Taiwan media market is saturated and in dire need of a major 
shake-out.  The weak financial state of media outlets makes 
them vulnerable to political manipulations from both sides, 
although the government clearly has the greater variety of 
tools.  While depoliticization of the media has been a DPP 
goal for much of the party\'s existence, the current 
polarization of Taiwan\'s political spectrum makes it unlikely 
that any action by a DPP government on media reform will be 
really balanced fairly between Green and Blue broadcasters or 
be perceived as fair and non-biased.

TAGS: EINV, EFIN, ECON, TW 
SUBJECT: Taiwan Economic Review for October 2004 
 
1.  This cable summarizes selected economic events in Taiwan 
in October 2004.  Below is a table of contents: 
 
- China\'s Interest Rate Hike 
 
- Central Government Budget 
 
- China Airlines Privatization 
 
- Cross-Strait Economic Normalization 
 
- Problem Financial Institutions 
 
Effect of China\'s Interest Rate Hike 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  In late October 2004, the People\'s Bank of China (PBC), 
China\'s central bank, raised interest rates for the first 
time in nine years.  Taiwan\'s exports rely heavily on 
production lines based in China, and Taiwan companies will 
face some increased operating costs brought on by higher 
interest rates.  Taiwan economists expect that higher 
interest rates will dampen China\'s real estate sector and 
cut into Taiwan\'s exports of construction materials such as 
iron and steel.  However, this will have little impact on 
Taiwan\'s China-based manufacturing, since most of its 
production is for export to the U.S. and other developed 
markets. 
 
Taiwan\'s Central Government Budget 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  According to the proposed 2005 Taiwan government budget, 
income taxes remain the major source of Taiwan\'s central 
government revenue.  However, Taiwan\'s Executive Yuan 
expects proceeds from sales of public enterprise equity 
shares to double this year.  It hopes to use these proceeds 
to reduce the growing budget deficit.  Public debt is nearly 
NTD 3.67 billion (USD 107.9 billion) or 35.7 percent of 
Taiwan\'s GNP.  The extent to which equity sales are able to 
cut public debt will depend on how much can actually be sold 
in the face of strong opposition from labor groups and some 
legislators. 
 
Privatization Plans for CAL Changed 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  Taiwan\'s Ministry of Transportation and Communications 
(MOTC) stepped back from plans to fully privatize China 
Airlines (CAL), which is currently 69 percent state-owned, 
by the end of 2005.  In a recent speech, MOTC Minister Lin 
Lin-san said the government needed to keep a controlling 
stake in the airline, though not more than 50 percent.  He 
said that like many other nations, Taiwan should have a 
\"national\" airline that can demonstrate Taiwan\'s sovereignty 
to other countries.  CAL\'s recent profit report for 2004 may 
have influenced the change in policy.  On October 20, CAL 
predicted its 2004 profit would be NTD 90 billion (USD 2.7 
billion). 
 
Cross-Strait Investment Festival 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  The Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs, Straits 
Exchange Foundation, and Mainland Affairs Committee (MAC) 
hosted some 300 participants at their 2004 mid-autumn 
festival event for Taiwan investors in China on October 3-4 
in Taoyuan.  President Chen, Vice President Lu, Premier Yu, 
and MAC Chairman Joseph Wu all took part in the event.  In 
his public remarks, Premier Yu said that Taiwan would 
continue to promote cross-strait economic and trade 
normalization, including expanding China\'s permitted 
commercial activities in Taiwan, liberalizing tourism and 
professional exchanges, expanding imports, and initiating 
consultations on cross-Strait direct transportation.  MAC 
Chairman Wu reiterated Taiwan\'s willingness to discuss 
charter flight service with China for Taiwan investors\' 
returning to Taiwan for the 2005 Chinese New Year holidays. 
 
6.  Separately, the twelfth annual Taiwan, PRC, and Hong 
Kong insurance cooperation conference took place in Taipei 
from October 25 to 26.  In recent years, Taiwan\'s Cathay 
Life, Taiwan Life, and Min Tai (Non-life) have all set up 
offices in the PRC.  This year the level of the PRC\'s 
government representation at the conference was raised to a 
division head insurance supervisory official. 
 
Problem Financial Institutions 
------------------------------ 
 
7.  After more than two years of financial reform, Taiwan\'s 
smaller financial institutions still have serious, although 
sometimes hidden, problems.  The Agricultural Financial 
Bureau reported to the Legislative Yuan in mid-October 2004 
that only three Farmers\' Associations credit departments had 
negative net worth. However, a legislator revealed an 
internal Agricultural Financial Bureau report that concluded 
that 92 out of 279 Farmers\' Association credit departments 
had negative net worth.  The internal report also indicated 
that 99 Farmers\' Association\'s credit departments reported 
non-performing loan ratios above 15%.  The discrepancy was 
the result of using two different ways to calculate non- 
performing loans.  The stricter method, which uses the 
internationally accepted definition of non-performing loans 
as no payment of interest or principle for at least three 
months, indicates more of the credit departments have 
negative net worth.

Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal 1.5 (B/D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Taiwan\'s International Cooperation and 
Development Fund (ICDF) is one of the foreign policy tools 
used to advance Taiwan\'s standing with nations that recognize 
Taipei.  Taiwan publicly parades the ICDF as a global 
humanitarian organization which seeks to combat poverty and 
provide technical assistance around the world.  Privately, 
however, ICDF officials admit the bulk of the ICDF budget is 
geared towards rewarding those nations that continue to 
recognize Taiwan diplomatically over China.  The foundation 
serves Taiwan\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and is 
largely self-financed through investments from its original 
endowment.  The ICDF serves as the \"public face\" for Taiwan\'s 
international aid and is not likely a vehicle used by Taipei 
for the direct cash payments that are often provided to 
Taiwan\'s diplomatic partners.  The recent embarrassment over 
the on-again off-again relationship with Vanuatu (reftel) is 
a vivid reminder of the role of direct cash payments.  The 
ICDF is also making efforts to increase its leverage with 
NGOs and other aid organizations to increase Taipei\'s 
visibility and diplomatic efforts abroad.  End summary. 
 
Used to Advance Diplomatic Ties 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Despite Taipei\'s best efforts to classify the ICDF\'s 
mission as assisting developing countries throughout the 
world, in reality the organization serves as an arm of MOFA 
to disperse aid to Taiwan\'s diplomatic partners.  Taiwan 
works hard via international conferences, glossy brochures, 
and professional video productions to tout the ICDF as a 
global organization that promotes international cooperation 
and as a mechanism for Taiwan to express its gratitude for 
the foreign aid it received before it became an economic 
success story.  ICDF Deputy Secretary General, Liao 
Shih-chieh, told AIT that Taiwan is particularly concerned 
with Beijing\'s efforts to usurp Taipei diplomatically.  When 
asked where the bulk of ICDF money and aid is focused, Liao 
admitted that the vast majority does go to Taiwan\'s 
diplomatic partners.  In 2003, of the approximately $57 
million that was approved for direct financing, all but about 
$6 million was earmarked for countries that maintain formal 
relations with Taiwan.  There is some small scale funding and 
projects geared towards Taiwan\'s non-diplomatic partners, but 
this is largely window dressing and done for publicity 
purposes.  Liao told AIT that if one of Taiwan\'s aid 
recipients were to switch recognition to China, then all ICDF 
aid would immediately be halted. 
 
Self-Financed, Supports MOFA 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The ICDF is almost completely self-funded for its 
activities and mirrors MOFA directives.  In the wake of 
Taiwan\'s declining diplomatic support around the world, the 
ICDF was formed in 1996 with a government grant of 
approximately $880 million (NT$30 billion) to promote both 
humanitarian and technical assistance programs.  Liao told 
AIT that a Board of Directors is responsible for making 
policy, approving aid projects and dispersing the budget. 
Members of the board are composed of prominent government and 
private sector officials including Foreign Minister Mark 
Chen, Economic Minister Ho Mei-yueh, and Perng Fai-nan, 
Governor of the Central Bank.  These officials ensure that 
ICDF aid support MOFA foreign policy goals and is used 
effectively to bolster ties with countries that recognize 
Taipei.  Liao said that in addition to some government 
grants, most of ICDF funding comes from investments financed 
from its endowment, which currently total about $440 million 
(NT$15 billion).  At the end of 2003, the ICDF\'s pledged 
investment and lending amounted to a total of approximately 
$495 million. 
 
4.  (C) Liao said that the foundation largely provides what 
the recipient country wants and offers a range of development 
and technical assistance programs.  According to Liao, ICDF 
holds consultations with each country and once a desire or 
need is expressed, the ICDF works to meet those goals.  For 
African allies, the ICDF is mostly focused on providing 
technical assistance to increase agricultural productivity as 
well as to promote investment to encourage education and 
promote worker training.  In Latin America, the ICDF funding 
is more geared towards assisting these nations promote 
economic investment and expand small and medium enterprises. 
The ICDF is involved with actual aid projects and does not 
appear to be involved with direct payments abroad.  The 
organization\'s books are open for the public to see and AIT 
was given a copy of last year\'s audit report. 
 
Increasing NGO Cooperation 
-------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  ICDF is also working to increase its cooperation 
with NGOs and other international aid organizations to 
improve its international prestige and status.  AIT officials 
attended a conference that focused on the ICDF\'s role in 
cooperating with aid organizations and NGO\'s.  The ultimate 
goal of this cooperation is to advance Taiwan\'s foreign 
policy goals through a variety of new mechanisms and increase 
access to other countries through international 
organizations.  ICDF and MOFA officials admitted to AIT that 
Taiwan must find a way to break free of Beijing\'s efforts to 
isolate Taiwan in the global community and this could be a 
new path.  (Comment: Taipei has been blocked from virtually 
all organizations and has little leverage to practice 
multi-lateral diplomacy abroad.  End comment). 
 
Final Thoughts: Concern Over Beijing 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) At the end of the meeting, Liao expressed concern 
with Beijing\'s increasing efforts to counter Taiwan\'s aid 
efforts with nations that maintain diplomatic relations with 
Taipei, particularly in Latin America.  Liao mentioned his 
particular dismay that the Organization of American States 
(OAS) granted China observer status and not Taiwan.  Liao 
also said that Beijing uses this observer status to ensure 
that Taiwan\'s interests are left out of OAS discussions and 
programs.  However, Liao noted that Taiwan enjoyed good 
relations with OAS under former Secretary General Miguel 
Angel Rodriguez, who was a supporter of Taiwan when he was 
president of Costa Rica.  (Comment: Rodriguez now stands 
accused in his native Costa Rica of taking money from, among 
others, Taiwan while serving as president.  End comment). 
 
Comment: Uphill Battle

7.  (C) The ICDF may play an increasingly central role in 
Taiwan\'s diplomatic strategy given a growing backlash at home 
and abroad over less ethically acceptable forms of foreign 
assistance in places like Costa Rica and 
Nicaragua--particularly because the ICDF is largely 
self-sufficient and involved in legitimate aid work.  The 
Chen administration is also eager to use Taiwan\'s foreign aid 
program to enhance its relations both with international 
organizations and major non-diplomatic partners such as Japan 
and the United States.  Over the past six months, Taiwan has 
actively expanded contacts with Japanese Overseas Development 
Assistance experts and have expressed interest to AIT in 
forming consultative relationships with USAID.  It is likely 
Taiwan is reaching out to NGO organizations because they have 
been unsuccessful in their bids to join international 
organizations because of the PRC\'s influence and Taipei the 
ICDF as a possible avenue for multi-lateral diplomacy.  While 
Taiwan targets its assistance programs to further its 
diplomatic agenda, the island does have much to offer the 
developing world in the areas of agricultural technology, 
microfinance, technical education, and small business 
development.

SUBJECT: BEIJING ACCELERATING GLOBAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
TAIWAN 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal; Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary. Taiwan officials say Beijing is effectively 
leveraging its growing international clout to orchestrate a 
global campaign to isolate Taipei.  Officials assert that 
Beijing\'s recent efforts have become increasingly 
coordinated, organized, and creative.  Taiwan MOFA officials 
maintain that the PRC\'s most recent tactic has been to cite 
Taiwan\'s non-participation in international forums, such as 
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) to pressure some 
Taiwanese companies into supporting Beijing\'s interests.  In 
Europe, officials claim that Beijing has offered substantial 
economic carrots to France and Germany in exchange for 
leading the charge to lift the EU arms embargo.  In Latin 
America, the PRC has upped the stakes in the PRC-Taiwan 
diplomatic chess match by employing surrogates like Venezuela 
and Brazil to pressure Taiwan\'s diplomatic partners in the 
region and increasing aid.  Beijing has continued effectively 
to block Taipei\'s efforts to join international 
organizations.  Taiwan believes that its international 
position is only getting worse, and it sees little hope of 
countering Beijing\'s efforts in light of the PRC\'s growing 
international clout.  Most Taiwan officials believe Taipei\'s 
only option is to rely on the U.S. for support.  End summary. 
 
Beijing\'s Full-Court Press More Unified 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) MOFA officials report that Beijing has stepped up its 
full court press around the world to isolate Taipei.  MOFA 
International Organizations Deputy Director General (DDG) 
Jieh Wen-chieh told AIT that what concerns him most is that 
it has only been in the last couple of years that the PRC\'s 
efforts have become so focused, unified, and global in scope. 
 He said that it seems all PRC officials and organizations 
around the world are working in unison to pursue Beijing\'s 
goal of isolating Taiwan.  Jieh remarked that he has never 
seen such an effective campaign before.  Jieh said that this 
is occurring on all fronts -- politically, economically, and 
through international organizations. 
 
A Dangerous New Tactic? 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (C) MOFA officials say that the PRC has adopted a new 
tactic of approaching Taiwanese companies and asserting that 
Taipei cannot effectively represent their interests abroad. 
DDG Jieh told AIT that he believes this has the potential to 
be Beijing\'s most powerful weapon.  For example, Jieh said 
Beijing has started to warn Taiwanese chemical companies 
about the negative impact on their business interests that 
has resulted from Taiwan\'s lack of membership in the CWC. 
Jieh said that in order for certain chemicals to be traded or 
bought on the market legally, the company\'s host government 
must be a member of this organization.  Jieh told AIT that 
because Beijing has blocked Taipei from joining the CWC, 
Taiwanese firms are having difficulty acquiring or selling 
certain chemicals on the open market.  An Industrial 
Development Bureau official told AIT separately that it is 
very difficult for Taiwan entities to acquire Category I and 
Category II chemicals because CWC member countries are not 
permitted to export such chemicals to non-members.  However, 
Taiwan can import Category III chemicals if the importing 
company applies to the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) for an 
end-user certificate (Note: The BOFT reports that some CWC 
members may be selling chemicals to Taiwan in violation of 
the CWC and some non-CWC members may be selling CWC 
restricted chemicals to Taiwan.  End note). 
 
4.  (C) Jieh told AIT that this PRC strategy is a huge and 
growing concern because it is not just a matter of political 
face and prestige, but of economic survival.  He said it is 
increasingly difficult to protect Taiwan\'s own basic economic 
interests as well those of individual companies.  Jieh added 
that some Taiwanese corporations, which are involved in joint 
ventures with PRC firms, are also feeling the heat from 
Beijing.  Jieh expressed concern that if current trends 
continue, more of Taiwan\'s firms will be at a disadvantage 
and may look to Beijing rather than Taipei for support out of 
necessity.  Jieh said that Taiwan\'s membership in certain 
organizations is essential for its economic and business 
interests and as long as Beijing continues its present 
course, the future is bleak. 
 
Using Carrots to Lift the Embargo in Europe 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Taiwan officials note that the PRC is equally 
aggressive in using its economic prowess in Europe to 
convince EU nations to overturn the embargo on weapon sales 
to Beijing.  Although it is not expected to be lifted this 
year, MOFA officials believe some form of the ban could be 
lifted as early as next year.  MOFA DDG for European Affairs, 
Hsieh Chun-teh, told AIT that he felt by next year there is 
no way to predict what will happen, and he was not 
optimistic.  Hsieh said that Beijing has adeptly convinced 
Germany and France, who often champion human rights causes, 
to take the lead in convincing other EU member states to lift 
the embargo.  Hsieh noted that French President Jacques 
Chirac, during a recent visit to the PRC, pledged to work 
hard to lift the embargo and was rewarded by billions in 
business deals.  Hsieh added that in December, German 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is scheduled to visit Beijing 
and will likely sign similar trade pacts. 
 
Upping the Stakes in Latin America 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Beijing has expanded the scope of its diplomatic 
pressure on Latin American nations that recognize Taiwan. 
MOFA DDG for Latin America, Wu Chin-mu, noted that the PRC is 
leveraging its new found clout to redouble its efforts to 
erode Taiwan\'s last bastions of international diplomatic 
influence.  Wu cited the case of Dominica, which earlier in 
the year switched diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China 
after Beijing offered a $112 million aid package over 5 
years.  In addition, Wu believes the situation in Panama, 
arguably Taipei\'s most important diplomatic partner, is 
clouded as Panama City did not support Taiwan\'s recent bid to 
become a member of the UN as it had in previous years.  The 
new Torrijos administration in Panama has pledged that it 
will increase ties to Beijing and Wu noted that the PRC is 
looking to increase business activities there.  National 
Security Council (NSC) Deputy Secretary General Parris Chang 
told AIT that Beijing has offered Panama advisors and 
engineers who worked on the Three Gorges dam project to widen 
the Panama canal in exchange for diplomatic recognition. 
 
7.  (C) Beijing is also using its clout with other countries 
in the region to pressure nations that recognize Taiwan.  Wu 
asserted that in a recent visit to Beijing, Brazilian 
President Luiz Inacio Lula promised to encourage Paraguay to 
switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing in exchange for 
trade concessions from the PRC.  Wu said that Taiwan is 
concerned over Paraguay\'s ability to resist the PRC\'s 
regional pressure.  He noted that Beijing is also linking 
free trade negotiations with MERCOSUR to the Taiwan issue. 
Beijing has reportedly warned that Paraguay\'s ties to Taiwan 
are an obstacle to finalizing any PRC-MERCOSUR free trade 
framework.  Chang told AIT that Beijing also encouraged 
Argentinean President Nestor Kirchner to lobby Paraguay to 
recognize the PRC after Kirchner visited the PRC earlier this 
year and the two countries signed billions of dollars worth 
of commercial contracts.  The NSC\'s Chang added that PRC 
President Hu Jintao will likely reinforce this pressure 
during his upcoming state visit to Buenos Aires. 
 
8.  (C) Chang noted that the PRC is increasingly looking to 
Venezuela as its surrogate in the region.  He asserted that 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has recently pressured the 
Dominican Republic on the Taiwan issue.  According to Chang, 
Chavez has threatened to cease its sale of oil at so-called 
\"friendship prices\" to the Dominican Republic if Santo 
Domingo does not sever ties with Taipei.  Chang added that 
Taiwan is also concerned that the PRC peace-keepers deployed 
to Haiti may be used as a tool to influence the upcoming 
election campaign there. 
 
Blocking International Organization Bids 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) Taipei officials say they see no let-up in the PRC\'s 
efforts to block Taipei\'s membership in all forms of 
international organizations.  MOFA International 
Organizations DDG Jieh told AIT that Beijing views Taiwan\'s 
membership in international organizations as a \"zero sum 
game.\"  Jieh remarked that in the PRC\'s eyes, if Taipei gains 
membership to any international organization, then it is the 
same as diplomatic recognition.  To illustrate how serious 
Beijing is, he cited a recent APEC meeting where the PRC 
delegation approached Taipei\'s delegation and bluntly warned 
Taiwan that its position on the cross-Strait issue will have 
a negative impact all over the world and demanded that Taipei 
accept its \"proper position,\" as defined by Beijing.  The 
NSC\'s Chang noted that Beijing appears eager to call for a 
vote in the Organization of American States to reject 
decisively Taiwan\'s bid for observership. 
 
10.  (C) Jieh said that Beijing\'s efforts are having dire 
consequences for Taiwan politically and economically in an 
increasingly globalized economy.  According to Jieh, no 
organization is too obscure for Beijing to keep Taiwan out 
of.  Jieh told AIT that Taiwan recently was interested in 
becoming a member of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, which 
is composes of nations that have fishing interests in the 
Indian ocean.  Despite the fact that Beijing does not have 
even one fishing vessel in the Indian ocean, the PRC sought 
membership so it could block Taiwan\'s own entry, just in case 
Taipei might seek to join.  He commented that Beijing\'s 
hard-line is also preventing Taipei from implementing key 
international law enforcement commitments such as money 
laundering, narcotics trafficking, and terrorism.  Jieh 
remarked that this will impact the international community at 
large, not just the PRC-Taiwan competition.  Jieh illustrated 
the case of Beijing\'s efforts to keep APEC from working 
counter-terrorism issues because the PRC did not want Taiwan 
involved in any type of global law enforcement issues that go 
beyond economics.  Jieh lamented that with the importance of 
membership to international organizations growing, Taiwan is 
increasingly at a disadvantage. 
 
Comment: Time to Face the Music 
------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) Taiwan officials seem to have concluded that there 
is little they can do.  Practically every MOFA official that 
AIT met with pleaded for increased U.S. support.  It is clear 
they do not have an effective plan for how to deal with the 
quandary they face.  There is some debate within MOFA circles 
over whether this chess match can be continued.  Taiwan has 
continued to do all it can diplomatically and financially to 
maintain its diplomatic partners, but no one is confident 
over how long can Taiwan keep its 27 formal diplomatic 
relationships in the face of Beijing\'s money diplomacy and 
pressure tactics.  On the home front, legislators and the 
public are also growing weary of blank checks being offered 
to third world nations simply to maintain formalistic 
diplomatic ties.  The embarrassing ongoing scuffle over 
Vanuatu will only increase that sense.  However, no one seems 
to willing to contemplate what happens if it loses what 
minimal space it has carved out for itself.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: SECRETARY POWELL\'S RESIGNATION 
AND U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
 
A) \"Since [Chen] Has Extended an Olive Branch [to 
Beijing], Why Does He Still Want to Add Fuel to the 
Fire [across the Taiwan Strait]?\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
editorialized (11/17): 
 
\"U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has tendered his 
resignation, and according to a White House official, 
President George W. Bush has already invited National 
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice to head the State 
Department.  The personnel shake-up in Washington\'s 
diplomatic circles in the wake of the U.S. general 
election is quickly taking shape.  Taiwan, of course, 
must monitor and pay special attention to the United 
States\' new diplomatic team and its implications for 
Washington\'s Asia-Pacific policy.  But more 
importantly, Taiwan needs to try hard to rebuild its 
image, in the eyes of the U.S. decision makers, as a 
responsible and rational player whose interests are 
consistent with those of the United States. . 
 
\"Among everything, the most important thing is to 
rebuild the United States\' trust in Taiwan because 
during the past period, unexpected rifts have occurred 
in the mutual trust between Taiwan and the United 
States due to Taiwan\'s referendum and its plans to 
institute a new constitution and to rectify the 
nation\'s name.  [Secretary] Powell\'s recent comment in 
Beijing that Taiwan is not a sovereign state indicated 
that President Bush\'s decision-making circle is 
determined to strengthen its suppression of Taiwan\'s 
press for independence in an attempt to avoid a war 
across the Taiwan Strait.  Different from Powell\'s 
moderate style, Rice is a tough hard-liner.  After 
learning the lesson from her predecessor, the Rice team 
may act more cautiously and seek to squeeze the room 
allowed for Taiwan.  When such an attitude is 
transformed and applied to a cross-Strait 
confrontation, it might pose a more unfavorable 
challenge for Taiwan. . 
 
\"The responsibility of a state leader is to protect the 
nation\'s dignity, security and prosperity.  For Taiwan, 
the cross-Strait relationship is what is most closely 
related to its national dignity, security and 
prosperity, and what the United States expects from 
Taiwan is exactly its responsible and prudent attitude 
in handling cross-Strait issues.  When the United 
States believes that Taiwan\'s moves hit the red line 
and threaten U.S. national interests, it would 
certainly attempt to destroy the threat.  In any 
situation such as participation in the international 
community, cross-Strait security and confrontation 
across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan needs support from the 
United States.  Hence, it is already more than 
important for Taiwan to enlarge its mutual interests 
with the United States.  How can this island allow 
itself to become a threat in the eyes of the Untied 
States? . 
 
\"To be frank, if [Chen] has to add fuel to the fire 
[across the Taiwan Strait] every time after he extends 
an olive branch, any beautiful olive branch will become 
the firewood that keeps cross-Strait confrontation 
burning.  Bystanders like the United States and 
international society would not feel the sincerity of 
Taiwan\'s [desire] for reconciliation.  It is a good 
idea to seek accession into the United Nations under 
the name of Taiwan, but let us open our eyes and look 
at reality.  Taiwan has failed each year in its efforts 
to join the United Nations and still we have not seen 
any progress on this matter.  The key actually lies in 
the current international political situation and the 
relatively disadvantageous position Taiwan is in when 
compared with China.  It actually has nothing much to 
do with Taiwan\'s name. 
 
\"Some scholars and politicians in the United States are 
worried that Chen Shui-bian will push for incremental 
independence for Taiwan in a `salami slicing\' way.  But 
now it seems that Taiwan is actually trying to `scoop a 
salami.\'  It is not using a knife on the surface; 
however, it is using a spoon to scoop out the salami 
once in a while.  [Chen] claims one day that the 
Republic of China is Taiwan, and that Taiwan is the 
Republic of China. Then another day [he] says Taiwan 
wants to push for its constitutional reform by carrying 
out the true spirit of instituting a new constitution. 
Later, [he] says that Taiwan wants to join the United 
Nations using the name Taiwan, and then he claims that 
the 1992 consensus is a consensus to surrender.  Given 
all such remarks, even though the salami has not been 
cut through, it has actually been scooped empty inside 
with only the skin left on the outside. . 
\"Perhaps many of the remarks that President Chen has 
made over the past few years were for campaign 
purposes, but many previous examples have shown that 
the Chen Shui-bian administration seems to believe that 
a strained cross-Strait relationship could greatly 
benefit the Pan-Green camp.  This may work well as a 
campaign strategy, but in the eyes of the United States 
and the international community, it merely proves that 
the Taiwan authorities are unable to transcend 
political party disputes and work out a policy that is 
in the national interest of the island.  As a result, 
both Washington and the international community may 
find it hard to truly trust Taiwan, [and the distrust] 
will further alienate Taiwan from the United States and 
allow Beijing to have a greater influence and 
capability to effectively suppress Taiwan.  When it 
comes to the responsibilities of a state leader to 
safeguard a nation\'s dignity, security and prosperity, 
shouldn\'t President Chen have higher expectations for 
himself other than winning an election?\" 
 
B) \"The Key of the United States\' Cross-Strait Policy 
Lies in Taiwan\'s Behavior\" 
 
Journalist Sean Liu observed in the centrist, pro- 
status quo \"China Times\" (11/17): 
 
\". [National Security Advisor Condoleezza] Rice is no 
stranger to the cross-Strait issue, and she is expected 
to handle the Taiwan policy on the United States\' 
existing basis, which includes Washington\'s long- 
standing displeasure with the Chen Shui-bian 
administration, its firm opposition to Taiwan 
independence and the push for Taiwan to buy weapons. 
President George W. Bush, during his second term, will 
certainly urge China to demonstrate flexibility and to 
resume talks with Taiwan.  But if the Taiwan leaders 
continue with their actions or words that often 
challenge the United States\' `one China policy,\' it is 
evident that Beijing will not be the target of U.S. 
pressure.\" 
 
C) \"Condoleezza Rice May Adjust U.S. Policy toward 
Taiwan\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" noted in an editorial (11/17): 
 
\"For Taipei, newly re-elected President George W. 
Bush\'s appointment yesterday of his National Security 
Advisor Condoleezza Rice to replace Colin Powell as 
U.S. secretary of state may provide a new opportunity 
to improve Washington relations strained in the last 
two years over the way President Chen Shui-bian pushed 
his political agenda and addressed his differences with 
Beijing. 
 
\"Rice is unlikely to change Washington\'s basic `one 
China\' policy, a position which has been followed by 
all past administrations since the U.S. shifted 
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing more than 
two decades ago.  However, she could adopt a clearer 
stance against Taiwan\'s passionate campaign to pursue 
formal independence and its escalating anti-Beijing 
rhetoric. 
 
\"A State Department under Rice could move more actively 
to encourage the resumption of long-stalled contacts 
and talks between Taipei and Beijing.  The above policy 
trends have already become apparent during the latter 
part of the current Beijing term.  Such policy 
adjustments have been considered necessary to prevent 
the simmering tension between the two sides from 
escalating into hot war, a conflict that the U.S. could 
be drawn into. .\"

attended the March 2004 FAO \"Expert Consultation on 
Interactions between Sea Turtles and Fisheries in the

web-site.  He also indicated that Taiwan has deployed 
observers on board its fishing vessels operating in three 
oceans to collect bycatch data on sea birds, sea turtles and 
other species.  He further told AIT that Taiwan is conducting 
a circle-hook pilot program in its deep-seas longline 
fisheries to reduce the mortality of sea turtles.  He noted, 
however, that more data and analysis would be needed before 
the program could be introduced to Taiwan\'s fishing fleet. 
Huang believes that more needs to be done to reduce sea 
turtle bycatch.  He is looking forward to attending the FAO 
Technical Consultations to collect information and share 
views on the conservation of sea turtles in fisheries.

Classified By: DIR Doug Paal for reasons 1.4 (b,d,and f) 
 
1. (C) Summary. AIT and TECRO held bilateral discussions on 
the margins of the 20th annual Joint Standing Committee on 
Civil Nuclear Cooperation in Seattle (JSCCNC) (Nov 4-5).  The 
two sides discussed:  UN Security Council resolution 1540, 
environmental samplings from the 1980s, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency\'s (IAEA) Additional Protocol and the 
implications for Taiwan\'s Atomic Energy Council (AEC) and the 
Institute for Nuclear Research (INER) of the reorganization 
of Taiwan,s government.

PARTICIPANTS 
------------ 
 
2. (U) AIT and TECRO held bilateral discussion on the margins 
of the JSCCNC in Seattle (Nov 4-5).  State/NP/NE Deputy 
Director Alex Burkart, AIT ESTOFF Erica Thomas and AIT Joint 
Standing Committee Principal Coordinator Harold Bengelsdorf 
represented AIT.  Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Minister 
Ouyang Min-shen, TECRO Washington Science Attache Dr. Chen 
Shih-kuei, AEC Director of Planning Dr. David Yao, and AEC 
International Affairs Chief Dr. Gone Jec-kong represented 
TECRO. 
 
--------------- 
RESOLUTION 1540 
--------------- 
 
3. (U) Burkart noted the fact that the UN Security Council 
passed resolution 1540, which states that all states should 
refrain from any kind of support of any development of 
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) by non-state actors, that 
they should adopt laws that prohibit activities that could 
enable non-state actors to access WMD and that they should 
establish domestic controls to prevent the proliferation of 
WMD.  He noted that the Resolution established a process for 
States to report on the steps they have taken to implement 
the provisions of the Resolution.  Burkart acknowledged that 
Taiwan, due to its unique status, is not formally part of the 
Resolution\'s reporting process, which is intended to ensure 
that states have the means to implement their 
non-proliferation obligations.  He emphasized the fact that 
1540 does not impose any new obligations, but simply is 
intended to ensure that the legal infrastructure is in place 
to enforce existing treaty obligations. 
 
4. (U) Burkart conveyed the U.S. interest in Taiwan preparing 
a report consistent with 1540 that could be exchanged 
bilaterally with the U.S.  To that end, Burkart provided 
Taiwan with a copy of Resolution 1540, a copy of the 
guidelines for the report and a copy of the UK report as an 
example.  He suggested that the UK approach might be easier 
to follow as it is only 14 pages compared to the U.S. report, 
which is 60 pages.  Burkart recognized that 1540 goes beyond 
just nuclear issues and that Taiwan,s response to this 
request would require approval beyond AEC. 
 
------------------- 
ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL 
------------------- 
 
5.  (U) Burkart addressed the International Atomic Energy 
Agency,s (IAEA) Additional Protocol.  He emphasized the USG 
commitment to seeing the successful implementation of the 
Protocol.  To that end, he noted that the USG has promised to 
open up its facilities in the same way it wants other 
countries to open up their facilities, exempting only those 
related to activities of direct national security 
significance.  He further informed Ouyang that, as soon as 
the implementing legislation is in place, the USG will ratify 
the Additional Protocol.  AEC,s International Affairs Chief 
Dr. Gone Jec-kong noted that Taiwan signed the Protocol in 
1998 and that it has already had 3 IAEA inspections.  He 
believed that the IAEA would replace its routine inspections 
of Taiwan,s nuclear plants with monitoring under integrated 
safeguards procedures. 
 
6. (C) Burkart commented that IAEA,s evaluation of Taiwan 
with respect to the history of its nuclear program had not 
been completed.  Dr. Yao revealed that the reason for this is 
that INER has not been able to provide satisfactory answers 
regarding some environmental samplings suggesting possible 
nuclear activities may have occurred during the 1980s.  He 
indicated that AEC and INER are still working on explaining 
the sampling results, but that it is difficult to recreate 
history, particularly because some of the people privy to the 
relevant information have since died.  Yao was hopeful that 
the IAEA was sympathetic to all of the effort AEC has put in 
to date with respect to IAEA inspections. 
 
7 (C) Burkart emphasized the importance of explaining the 
findings and offered assistance in sharing some of his 
records from the past 30 years to help reconstruct history. 
He also asked if AEC has been working with Chungshan 
Institute to answer the questions.  Yao claimed that 
Chungshan has been very cooperative and informed AIT that AEC 
will meet with Chungshan again next month to try to address 
the outstanding questions.  Yao said he would contact AIT 
ESTOFF if he had questions regarding information he thought 
Burkart might have.  Burkart once again impressed upon the 
TECRO side the extreme importance of making sure the 
evaluation is completed.  Burkart noted that it is critical 
to understand the past in order to understand the present 
situation.  Burkart expressed satisfaction that cooperation 
is ongoing and urged its continuance to ensure the matter is 
resolved quickly. 
8. (U) Minister Ouyang spoke to the current Administration\'s 
stand on nuclear issues. He assured AIT that the Chen 
Administration has no interest in non-peaceful uses of 
nuclear materials. He emphasized that Taiwan,s top nuclear 
priority is power generation. He noted that Taiwan is also 
very committed to nuclear safety and economically efficient 
and productive technologies.  Ouyang further expressed an 
interest in helping Mainland China to ensure its plants are 
safe if a way to cooperate could be found. (Comment. The Chen 
Administration has not softened its anti-nuclear rhetoric, 
including on nuclear energy.  It is not clear whether 
Minister Ouyang\'s interpretation of nuclear power generation 
being a priority is his personal goal or one shared more 
widely within the Administration.  End Comment).

9.  (U) Lastly, Burkart noted that the AIT-TECRO agreement 
covering the operation of the JSCCNC had renewed 
automatically by its terms at the end of the previous month. 
He suggested, however, that it is out of date and both sides 
might consider updating its terms.  There is no requirement 
that it be revised, but he encouraged the TECRO delegation to 
look it over.  This could be particularly important if the 
JSCCNC is to begin to incorporate non-nuclear energy 
activities as proposed by INER on several occasions. 
 
10. (U) Ouyang welcomed the suggestion, but he noted that the 
Taiwan government is planning a massive reorganization that 
will likely move AEC from being an independent body to a 
subsidiary agency within an upgraded Ministry of the 
Environment.  Both sides agreed that it would make sense to 
wait until after the reorganization to review the JSCCNC 
terms. 
 
11. (C) Comment. AIT was surprised and encouraged by Yao\'s 
openess in revealing the problems it is encountering with 
respect to environmental samplings taken by the IAEA. 
Unfortunately, there was no indication that AEC is close to 
being able to provide satisfactory answers to the IAEA. 
Another item of potential concern is the fact that, under the 
proposed restructuring of Taiwan,s government, AEC would 
become part of the new Ministry of the Environment.  It is 
important that AEC continue to maintain its independent 
regulatory oversight role after the reorganization.  To 
ensure that this is the case, this issue may warrant follow 
up with TECRO contacts.  In addition, as AEC\'s current 
mandate is limited to oversight of nuclear safety, it would 
be useful to determine which agency will have oversight of 
the alternative energy programs planned for INER after the 
government reorganization takes place.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: LY ELECTION PREVIEW: MIAOLI COUNTY 
 
REF: TAIPEI 03646 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Miaoli County (four seats), with its large 
Hakka population, has been a long-time Pan-Blue stronghold. 
Hoping to keep it that way, the Pan-Blue has nominated its 
three incumbents, and will run a campaign in which ethnic 
politics (likely masquerading as \"local roots\") will feature 
prominently.  The DPP believes that its Hakka outreach 
efforts of the last few years might now bear fruit and help 
it unseat one of the KMT incumbents, Ho Chih-hui, who is 
embroiled in a corruption scandal that had him spending most 
of the last year in exile in Shanghai.  If it is successful, 
the DPP hopes that this will usher in a new era for Miaoli 
politics, in which party identity and ideology will supplant 
ethnicity and factionalism as the most important electoral 
issues.  Even if it fails, however, the DPP is all but 
guaranteed to hold onto its one seat.  End Summary. 
 
Miaoli: Majority Hakka and Staunchly Pan-Blue 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Miaoli County (pop. 560,597) in northwestern Taiwan is 
home to one of Taiwan\'s largest concentrations of ethnic 
Hakka.  Hakka have traditionally been stalwart Pan-Blue 
supporters, and Miaoli is therefore considered a Pan-Blue 
stronghold.  The Pan-Green currently holds only one of 
Miaoli\'s four seats in the Legislative Yuan (LY) and in the 
2004 Presidential election, Miaoli residents voted for Lien 
Chan of the Kuomintang (KMT) over Chen Shui-bian of the 
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) by a 21.5 percent margin. 
Despite these intimidating demographics, the Pan-Green has 
nominated three candidates for this December\'s LY election, 
hoping to wrest an additional seat or two from the Pan-Blue\'s 
three incumbents, who are all standing for reelection.  Four 
independent candidates have also registered, but none is 
expected to be a serious contender. 
 
Pan-Blue: A Time-Tested Formula 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Pan-Blue campaign organizers said they are confident 
the Pan-Blue incumbents can hold onto their three seats.  KMT 
Miaoli County Chairman Lee Chin-sung said that the Pan-Blue 
is using a time-tested formula for success in Miaoli.  The 
three Pan-Blue candidates, he explained, each represent one 
of the major geographical subdivisions of the county: the 
KMT\'s Liu Sheng-hung and Ho Chih-hui are from the coastal and 
mountain areas respectively, and Hsu Yao-chang of the People 
First Party (PFP) is from the Chunggang river area.  Both Ho 
and Hsu are ethnic Hakkas, he added.  The Pan-Green 
candidates, by contrast, are all ethnic Taiwanese from the 
coastal region, he said.  The KMT will use its ethnic and 
geographic diversity to its advantage, Lee explained.  Ho, 
for example, will emphasize the need to keep a representative 
from the mountain area in the LY as part of his campaign. 
KMT candidates will also campaign on their legislative 
record, he said, reminding voters of the construction and 
development projects they have brought to Miaoli.  The PFP\'s 
Hsu will use a similar strategy, said PFP County Councilor 
Tsou Yu-mei. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
DPP: Not as Reckless as it Might Seem 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) DPP Miaoli County Chairman Hsu Chin-jung defended the 
DPP\'s nomination strategy.  The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) 
candidate, Chiu Te-hong, \"doesn\'t stand a chance\", he 
explained, so he should not count as a serious Pan-Green 
nominee.  In fact, Chiu only recently left the KMT to join 
the TSU, he said, so he is just as likely to steal votes from 
KMT candidates as from the DPP\'s nominees.  (Note: Chiu was a 
founding member of the \"Blue Eagle Warriors,\" a group of 
young up-and-coming KMT members who in April urged the party 
leadership to admit defeat in the March presidential 
election, conduct a generational transfer of power, back 
comprehensive reform and shift the party\'s ideology toward 
the political center.  He became increasingly critical of 
Lien Chan, at one point calling him a \"lazy worm\" to his 
face, and was expelled from the KMT in late July after 
accepting the TSU\'s nomination in Miaoli.  End Note.) 
5. (C) Hsu added that DPP nominee Chen Chao-ming can not be 
considered a newcomer because he previously served as an 
independent LY member from 1998-2001 and only narrowly lost 
his reelection bid in the last election.  Furthermore, he 
predicted, the formerly independent Chen will attract many of 
his old supporters, and will not have to rely solely on loyal 
DPP voters.  Hsu also downplayed the DPP\'s lack of 
geographical diversity, noting that although incumbent Tu 
Wen-ching is originally from the coastal area, he has lived 
in Miaoli City, located in the mountain area of the county, 
for the past 13 years and has proven himself to the local 
population by previously serving as a locally elected County 
Council-member. 
 
Scandal Plagued Ho Chih-hui 
--------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Hsu said the DPP \"stands a good chance of taking two 
seats\" in this election because of the controversy 
surrounding KMT nominee Ho Chih-hui.  Ho fled to Shanghai in 
October 2003 to avoid an investigation into charges he had 
illegally used his position as County Magistrate in the 
mid-1990s to secure loans for himself.  In May 2004 he was 
officially indicted on charges of corruption carrying a 
recommended sentence of 18 years imprisonment.  He returned 
to Taiwan in September to vote on the \"Truth Investigation 
Commission\" bill authorizing an LY-appointed committee to 
investigate the circumstances of President Chen\'s March 19 
shooting and its impact on the subsequent election.  He also 
registered to become a member of the LY Judiciary Committee 
in a crass attempt, media and Pan-Green critics alleged, to 
influence his own case.  Ho is currently protected by 
legislative immunity and cannot be arrested.  If he wins 
election, Hsu predicted, he will drag the case out 
indefinitely or until the charges are dropped.  If Ho loses, 
Hsu said, he will likely have friends smuggle him to Shanghai 
again despite a court order restricting him from leaving the 
country. 
 
Ho\'s Supporters Abandoning Him 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Hsu said he was hopeful that many voters uneasy with 
Ho\'s \"many flaws\" will vote instead for one of the DPP 
candidates.  The PFP\'s Tsou independently noted that many of 
the local community leaders who previously endorsed Ho are 
now supporting the DPP\'s Chen Chao-ming.  Furthermore, Miaoli 
County Magistrate Fu Hsieh-peng (a PFP-leaning independent) 
has been attending the rallies of DPP candidate Tu Wen-ching 
in addition to those of the PFP\'s Hsu Yao-chang.  KMT 
Organizational Development Committee Chairman Liao Feng-te 
speculated that Fu has thrown his support behind Tu because 
of a personal grudge he has with Ho.  KMT County Chairman Lee 
acknowledged that Fu and Ho have had a less than friendly 
relationship since they ran against one another six years ago 
in a very negative campaign for County Magistrate.  Both 
filed libel suits against one another at the time, he said, 
and one of these suits is still pending.  However, Lee 
asserted that Fu\'s willingness to appear at Tu\'s rallies is 
not a snub directed toward Ho, but rather an effort to build 
good relations with both sides before his retirement.  Deputy 
Magistrate Chen Hsiu-lung offered a similar explanation, 
saying \"Fu wants to be friends with everybody now, so he 
wants to remain neutral.\"  He added that Fu will attend any 
candidate\'s rallies, including Ho\'s, if he is asked to. 
 
DPP Wants to Change Political Landscape in Miaoli 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
8. (C) DPP Chairman Hsu said he hoped that the DPP would be 
successful in getting both of its candidates elected because 
this would \"forever change the political landscape in Miaoli\" 
from one based on factional politics to one of party 
politics.  Indeed, a striking feature of the campaign in 
Miaoli is the relative lack of attention given to the 
political parties.  Campaign posters for both the PFP\'s Hsu 
and the KMT\'s Liu do not indicate their respective party 
affiliations at all.  Even the DPP\'s normally very cohesive, 
party-centered campaign is notably absent in Miaoli.  Its 
candidates are running independent campaigns and are 
reluctant to implement the party\'s trademark \"peipiao\" vote 
distribution scheme.  DPP Chairman Hsu noted that the only 
way for his office nominally to comply with central party 
instructions to run a \"team campaign\" was for him personally 
to print up leaflets with photos and information about both 
candidates on the same page.  He added that should peipiao 
become necessary in the end, the only way to implement it 
might be to have President Chen Shui-bian personally come 
down to Miaoli and call on voters to distribute their votes. 
 
Factionalism and Ethnicity 
-------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Instead of partisanship, factionalism and ethnicity 
are playing a much bigger role in Miaoli.  KMT Chairman Lee 
asserted that the reason for DPP candidate Chen Chao-ming\'s 
high level of support is because of his affiliation with the 
\"Liu faction,\" which emerged after an internal KMT split over 
a County Magistrate election 40 years ago.  The KMT\'s Ho is 
also in the \"Liu faction\", he said, so the willingness of 
some of Ho\'s supporters to back Chen instead is not very 
surprising.  More prominent, however, are Miaoli\'s ethnic 
politics.  The KMT and PFP are trying to mobilize the 
traditionally Pan-Blue Hakka vote by subtly playing up the 
Hakka ethnicity and local roots of their candidates Ho and 
Hsu. 
 
DPP Reaches out to Hakkas 
------------------------- 
 
10. (C) However, the DPP\'s Tu is also actively courting the 
Hakka vote by emphasizing his long residence and service to 
the Hakka-dominated mountain areas of Miaoli and by 
minimizing references to his ethnic Taiwanese identity and 
membership in the DPP.  Photos of ethnic Taiwanese Chen 
Shui-bian, for example, are conspicuously absent from his 
campaign posters and other materials.  DPP County Chairman 
Hsu\'s office is also campaigning for the Hakka vote, 
reminding them of the party\'s efforts on their behalf in the 
last few years, such as the formation of the Hakka Affairs 
Council, promotion of Hakka-language education, the creation 
of a Hakka-language television channel, and other 
celebrations of Hakka culture (Reftel).  Hsu said he is 
confident that a genuine appreciation among Hakka for the 
DPP\'s Hakka-friendly policies, combined with a sentiment 
among many Hakka that they should back the party in power to 
best gain influence, will result in a historically high 
turnout among Hakka for the DPP. 
 
Comment: DPP Enjoys Room for Experimentation 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Miaoli represents a test for the DPP\'s efforts to 
expand from its roots as a party largely for ethnic Taiwanese 
into a genuinely multi-ethnic political party.  They will 
need to attract some of the Hakka vote if they hope to take 
two seats.  The KMT\'s decision to renominate a candidate as 
unattractive as the scandal-plagued Ho Chih-hui has made that 
task somewhat easier.  In any case, the DPP has little to 
lose in Miaoli: they are virtually assured of keeping the one 
seat they have, as the Pan-Blue only nominated three 
candidates, and none of the independents poses a serious 
threat.

1.  (SBU)Summary: Taiwan authorities charged with protecting 
Intellectual Property Rights have made substantial progress 
since the last review in March 2004.  AIT recommends reducing 
Taiwan\'s current Special 301 classification from the Priority 
Watch List to the Watch List.  Further reductions might be 
warranted once Taiwan meets its WTO commitments to protect 
pharmaceutical data, deter on-line piracy, control illegal 
copying on University campuses, and improve the judicial 
process to ease prosecution of IPR cases.  Taiwan will also 
need to continue effective enforcement actions against 
counterfeiting activities.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) The period from March to November 2004 has seen 
Taiwan authorities take significant actions to improve the 
environment for IPR protection in Taiwan and to continue 
positive enforcement activities.  Most significant of these 
improvements was the passage of amendments to the copyright 
law that addressed serious shortcomings in the legal 
environment for copyrighted materials.  Taiwan also created 
new protections for pharmaceuticals, and stepped up 
enforcement actions to protect optical media, 
pharmaceuticals, and branded goods.  Increased surveillance 
by Customs authorities is credited by Taiwan officials with 
further limiting exports of counterfeit products, and new 
powers for those authorities 
should increase their effectiveness.  Taiwan 
institutionalized what had previously been an ad hoc joint 
task force focusing on retail Optical Disk piracy enforcement 
and plans to expand its membership, and is drafting plans to 
create a specialized IPR court.  The Department of Health 
(DOH) drafted and submitted to the Legislative Yuan (LY) a 
Data Exclusivity (DE) law.  Problems still remain, 
specifically, the failure of the LY to pass DE legislation, 
the continued operation of P2P sites, continued digital and 
print piracy on university campuses, and protracted legal 
procedures that discourage resolution of IPR complaints. 
 
Legal Environment:  Copyright amendments 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) On August 24, responding to high level lobbying from 
the government, Taiwan\'s LY passed amendments to the 
copyright law that plugged many of the holes left by the 2003 
attempt at copyright reform.  The new law granted Taiwan 
Customs ex officio authority to impound suspected counterfeit 
goods, provided protection for \"anti-piracy measures\", 
created minimum sentences for those convicted of commercial 
piracy, and eliminated arbitrary personal use provisions. 
Those convicted of violating IPR with commercial intent will 
now receive a sentence of six months to five years and be 
fined between USD15,000 and USD150,000.  Non-commercial 
piracy is punishable by up to three years in prison and/or a 
fine of up to USD22,000.  Industry pronounced itself mostly 
pleased, but noted that the amendments did not address the 
issue of internet piracy. 
 
Stiffer penalties for pharmaceutical piracy 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) On March 30, Taiwan passed amendments to the 
Pharmaceutical law that increased penalties for producing, 
distributing or selling counterfeit products.  Penalties for 
producing or importing counterfeit drugs now include 
imprisonment for up to twelve years and a fine of up to 
USD750,000, under certain circumstances.  This is up from the 
former maximum penalty of a USD4,500 fine.  The penalty for 
sale or distribution of counterfeit pharmaceuticals is now up 
to seven years in jail and a fine of up to USD150,000. 
 
Changes to Patent and Trademark laws and regulations 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5.  (U) The Patent Act was amended in February 2003 and 
revisions took effect in July 2004.  The changes make patent 
applications easier to file, including instituting an 
e-filing system, simplified patent litigation procedures, and 
adopting a post-grant dispute filing system.  Trademark 
examiners were made subject to new regulations requiring them 
to take into account usage in determining whether the mark is 
likely to cause confusion.  The examination standards for 
three-dimensional shapes, colors and sounds took effect July 
1, 2004. 
 
Establishment of an IPR Court 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) After several months of consideration, the Judicial 
Yuan has decided to support the creation of a specialized IP 
court.  Debate has centered on whether such a court would 
have power to adjudicate criminal, civil and administrative 
cases, whether the court should be at a district or appellate 
level, and whether judges should be permanently assigned or 
rotated through the court.  Ministry of Justice contacts 
inform AIT that the Judicial Yuan will formally propose the 
Court in next Legislative session. 
 
Illegal Photocopying 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Although illegal photocopying continues to be a 
problem on university campuses, the American Association of 
Publishers (AAP) tells AIT it is generally satisfied with the 
increased awareness and level of cooperation they are 
receiving from enforcement officials.  In conjunction with 
AAP, the National Police conducted a series of raids and 
inspections in mid and late September around many of the 
major universities in Taiwan in an attempt to discourage 
illegal photocopying of textbooks at the beginning of the new 
fall term.  AAP plans to work with the Ministry of Education 
to develop policy guidelines that 
discourage illegal photocopying. 
 
Enforcement Actions: Legalization of the IETF 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U) On November 1, 2004 Taiwan officially 
institutionalized what had been an ad hoc anti-piracy task 
force.  The Integrated Enforcement Task Force (IETF) is a 
220-person police detail committed to combating retail 
optical disk piracy.  During the first nine months of 2004, 
the IETF conducted 2,964 inspections, made almost 800 arrests 
for optical media piracy, and confiscated over 590,000 
illegal CDs.  Despite this record of improved enforcement, 
stakeholders were concerned that the ad hoc nature of the 
task force was detrimental to recruitment of personnel and 
betrayed a lack of commitment to continued enforcement 
actions.  The task force is now a permanent body that falls 
under the jurisdiction of the national police but will be 
funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.  There are 
reportedly plans to increase the number of personnel to 600 
by 2006. 
 
Major Blow to Optical Media Piracy 
---------------------------------- 
 
9.  (U) In May, Taiwan police, Coast Guard, and Ministry of 
Justice (MOJ) officials conducted a series of raids in the 
Taichung area that resulted in the seizure of over 400,000 
illegal CDs, 400 CD burners, and one unlicensed CD injection 
machine.  Eight suspects were arrested and seven were 
indicted.  The suspects could face sentences as long as five 
years inprisonment.  According to the Taichung Prosecutors 
Office, the suspects were eligible for bail and are currently 
not in custody.  Police estimate the group was responsible 
for as much as ten percent of all counterfeit optical media 
produced in Taiwan. 
 
Attacking Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals 
------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (U) The MOJ has made the investigation of pharmaceutical 
cases a top priority.  In October, Taichung enforcement 
authorities raided nine separate locations in Central and 
Southern Taiwan and seized almost one million counterfeit 
tablets of Viagra, Reductil, and Stilnox.  Four persons were 
arrested, including a licensed pharmacist.  Subsequent 
investigation suggests the tablets were produced in China and 
smuggled into Taiwan, but that the high-quality packaging and 
printing was done in Taiwan.  The Ministry of Justice 
Investigation Bureau (MJIB) has assured AIT that the 
investigation into the source of the tablets, as well as the 
printing and packaging materials, continues.  MOJ and DOH 
inspections of pharmacies in the weeks following the arrests 
showed a marked decrease in the incidents of counterfeit 
pharmaceutical products for retail sale, according to MOJ 
sources. 
 
Additional Enforcement Actions 
------------------------------ 
 
11.  (U) In June, the IETF uncovered an optical disk piracy 
operation outside of Taipei that resulted in the confiscation 
of over 15,000 illegal optical disks, 
including software, games, VCDs, pornography, and music. 
Twenty seven CD burners and 4 computers were also seized.  In 
addition to the actions by IETF, the National Police 
Administration, through September reported over 3,000 raids 
on suspected IP violators and arrested over 3,000 suspects 
for IP related crimes.  The Joint Optical Disc Enforcement 
Task Force (JODE) conducted over 800 raids during the same 
time period, including 300 at night.  They found six 
instances 
of illegal optical disk manufacturing, closed eight illegal 
manufacturing plants, seized five optical disk machines and 
over 100,000 optical disks.  Taiwan Customs seized over 
64,000 illegal optical disks through September 2004, 
including more than 16,000 pirated PS2 optical disks. 
Customs also seized substantial amounts of counterfeit 
branded goods, including purses and clothing, perfume and 
other trademarked goods.  Most of these products allegedly 
originated in China. 
 
Public Education and Training 
----------------------------- 
 
12.  (U) The Ministry of Economic Affairs has created a 
reward program for informants in optical disk piracy cases. 
At an awards ceremony in June 2004, MOEA paid over NT$17 
million to informants and law enforcement for tips that led 
to the closure of five illegal optical media plants and 
confiscation of nine injection molders, 19 other pieces of 
heavy manufacturing equipment and over 630,000 pirated disks. 
 
 
13.  (U) In April 2004, TIPO began to publish a weekly IPR 
column in one of Taiwan\'s most important business dailies. 
The column aims to educate business people on IPR related 
concepts.  Since April 2004, IPR promotion advertisements 
have been posted in public areas such as the subway and in 
airports and broadcast on television. 
 
14.  (U) Training for law enforcement personnel, prosecutors 
and judges is occurring regularly.  In May, TIPO conducted 
training for 137 new IETF officers.  Representatives from the 
US Department of Justice and the FBI in September held a 
seminar for law enforcement on combating cyber-crime.  In 
April, the Ministry of Justice and Chiao Tung University 
conducted training on IPR crimes for prosecutors.  TIPO, in 
cooperation with Taiwan National Politics University\'s IPR 
Center, will host additional training for judges and 
prosecutors November 25-26. 
 
Unfinished business: DE protection... 
------------------------------------- 
 
15.  (SBU) During AUSTR Charles Freeman\'s July visit to 
Taiwan, the DOH committed to draft and submit to the LY a 
bill to protect research-based pharmaceutical and chemical 
data.  After consultations with a resistant local industry, 
DOH finally submitted the draft bill to the Executive Yuan 
for submission to the LY Procedure Committee in late 
September.  However, due to political disputes in the LY tied 
to the upcoming LY elections in December, the Procedure 
Committee has not yet assigned the bill to the Environment, 
Science and Health Committee for consideration.  With the LY 
in recess until after the December 11 elections and the LY 
session scheduled to conclude in late January, it will be 
difficult to pass this bill in the current session. 
 
16.  (SBU) The draft bill does address most of industry\'s 
concerns for Data Exclusivity (DE).  New chemical entities 
would be granted a five-year period of DE protection.  New 
indications would be protected for three years under the 
draft bill.  The innovative research pharmaceutical industry 
has raised concerns about one provision that would require 
new products to register in Taiwan within three years of its 
initial sale in another market or face the loss of DE 
protection in Taiwan.  Industry worries that three years will 
not allow them to complete Taiwan\'s complex registration 
requirements.  In an October 11 letter, the Minister of 
Health, assured AIT that companies need only file for 
registration within three years to avail themselves of DE 
protection.  He wrote that there is no need to complete the 
registration procedure within three years to benefit from the 
provisions of the proposed law. 
 
...and Internet Piracy 
---------------------- 
 
17.  (U) Although indictments against Peer to Peer (P2P) file 
sharing companies EZPeer and Kuro were filed in December 
2003, the legal process to restrict the use of these services 
for copyright infringing file trading between subscribers is 
glacially slow.  The cases are still under consideration by 
the Taiwan courts.  In response to a lawsuit brought by the 
International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI), 
the P2P sites posted a list of songs that users were urged 
not to download, but the operators of the sites did not make 
any efforts to prevent the sharing of the specified 
copyrighted works.  The Taipei prosecutors office has made 
the this case a priority, assigning two expert prosecutors to 
handle the case, but is still awaiting judicial action. 
While Taiwan enforcement authorities are becoming 
increasingly aware of the problem of internet piracy, they 
have yet to articulate a coherent strategy for dealing with 
this threat. 
 
18.  (SBU) AIT Assessment: As a result of a united USG 
interagency front, the IPR environment in Taiwan is steadily 
improving.  Many of the issues highlighted in the 2004 
Special 301 Review have been addressed, including better 
cooperation to combat photocopying, effective efforts to 
resolve conflicts over power of attorney requirements, and 
institutionalization of the Integrated Enforcement Task 
Force.  Taiwan\'s efforts to address serious problems warrant 
its removal from the Priority Watch List.  However, work 
remains to be done in several areas, including passing 
legislation to protect pharmaceutical data and addressing 
growing concerns about internet piracy and the slow legal 
process for protecting IPR.  Until these remaining concerns 
are addressed, it is premature to consider dropping Taiwan 
from the Special 301 Watch List.   End Comment.

1. (C) SUMMARY: Recent conversations with Taiwan artists and 
academics have revealed their growing concern that the ruling 
DPP\'s political drive to create a new national identity has 
created a battleground in the arenas of art and education. 
Artists and officials alike lament the fact that culture is 
not being viewed as a means to unite Taiwan\'s polarized 
public, but as yet another weapon on the political 
battleground.  Our contacts agree that the DPP\'s political 
agenda is, at a minimum, limiting the development of art, 
film and education.  At a maximum, they say the government is 
making cynical use of a different sense of identity between 
Taiwan\'s younger and older generations in order to further 
its political goal of independence.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Government Support of the Arts (or Lack Thereof) 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (C) Cultural Minister Chen Chi-nan and Taiwan\'s Council 
for Cultural Affairs (CCA), have written a new mission 
statement to guide cultural and art policies: Taiwan is 
\"facing a hard time of ethnic confrontation and national 
identification\" and \"hopes culture and art can be a unifying 
force.\"  According to contacts in the cultural and 
educational field, despite this mission statement the 
government is taking politically motivated and divisive 
actions to alter Taiwan\'s cultural identity.  By way of 
example, Liao Hsien-hao, Taipei City\'s Cultural Bureau 
Commissioner, points to the CCA\'s decision to withdraw 
funding from organizations which include references to 
\"Republic of China\" in their mission statements or names.  He 
also decries the government decision to rename 
organizations-- like the Han and Tang dance troupe-- or 
rewrite traditions-- the Dragon Boat races as a celebration 
of river gods as opposed to the original association with 
China\'s poet Qiu Yuan.  He believes the goal of the policy is 
to desinicize Taiwan and ultimately increase the distance 
between its people and Mainland China. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Camouflaging Taiwan\'s Cultural Identity 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3. (C) While some of our contacts would argue that these 
actions are necessary in order to compensate for decades of 
KMT control and repression of non-Han culture, Liao and 
others view the DPP actions as an attempt to redefine 
Taiwan\'s identity for poltical purposes. In their eyes the 
DPP\'s efforts to define a separate Taiwan identity, which 
excludes Han Chinese culture, ignores the reality of Taiwan\'s 
multi-cultural society.  They view the DPP\'s effort to create 
a new consensus on the definition of Taiwan culture as an 
attempt to redefine what representing the people of Taiwan 
means. Under this strategy, the KMT is viewed not only as the 
historical oppressor, but also as a party representing a 
foreign culture.  The DPP, by defining culture and art in 
such narrow terms as to exclude or camouflage any Han Chinese 
content, has succeeded in alienating those artists whose 
performance or artwork is steeped in such content.  Many of 
these artists have refused to change the content or name of 
their organization because of their affinity to Han culture. 
According to many contacts the CCA\'s support of art and 
culture, so narrowly defined, has failed to unify Taiwan 
society and only succeeded in limiting artistic expression 
and development. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Taiwan\'s Foundering Film Industry: 
A Victim of Politics or Free Trade? 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Robert Chen, Director of the Graduate School of 
Applied Media arts at the National Taiwan University of the 
Arts, and a DPP supporter, points to the decline in Taiwan\'s 
film industry as a concern largely ignored by a government 
content to embrace \"all things international.\" Chen and some 
aspiring young film directors we have met believe Taiwan is 
in a unique position to be a leader in cultural content in 
Asia, but has fallen behind Singapore and Mainland China, 
even though directors and producers there are subject to 
government control.  In their eyes, the DPP leadership has 
failed both to protect Taiwan,s nascent film industry from 
international competition and to recognize the potential film 
and art offer to help forge a Taiwan identity. They argue 
that Taiwan, unlike South Korea, gave up any protection for 
its film industry, under U.S. pressure, in order to join the 
WTO.  As a result Taiwan,s films are not commercially viable 
even in their own theaters while U.S., Korean, and Japanese 
films flood the market. 
 
5. (C) While there are numerous explanations for the decline 
of Taiwan\'s film industry, many local contacts focus on the 
damage domestic politics has done to Taiwan\'s cultural 
community.  Many are quick to point out that artists have 
been criticized if they try to maintain a neutral political 
position.  Hou Hsiao-hsien, a significant and important 
Taiwanese director whose previous films depicted life and 
change in Taiwan society, was accused of not \"loving Taiwan 
enough\" and consequently turned to Japan for funding, actors, 
and support for his next film. 
 
6. (C) Young artists and directors say that they have had to 
ask themselves over the past few years whether or not their 
subjects or the content of their films would be supported by 
the CCA.  Wu Yi-feng, a film director and founder of the Full 
Shot Communication Foundation, points to the controversy 
surrounding his latest film as an example of the 
politicization of culture.  His documentary film, \"Life\" 
which follows the stories of several Taiwan families 
following the massive devastation of Taiwan,s 1999 
earthquake, has generated great public interest and is 
currently touring the island.  With its success have come 
numerous requests for Wu to participate in political 
campaigns and, on the occasion of National Day, President 
Chen Shui-bian openly praised the film.  To his dismay, Wu 
believes his film has been unfairly labeled a \"Pan-Green\" 
film although it contains no political content.  Pan-Blue 
legislators accused the government of trying to brainwash 
bureaucrats by screening the movie in Executive Yuan (EY) 
agencies.  According to Wu, when the movie was not included 
in the Golden Horse competition, the Pan-Green media went on 
to accuse the competition\'s chairman of political 
partisanship and for not \"loving Taiwan enough\" despite prior 
knowledge that his film could not be included in the Golden 
Horse competition because it was shot with digital video as 
opposed to 35 millimeter film. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Preservation of Indigenous Culture: Education or Commodity? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
7. (C) The CCA has described as part of its mission, in 
collaboration with the education ministry, to support the 
development and cultural preservation of the indigenous 
peoples of Taiwan.  According to Tian Ming-sheu, a professor 
at the Graduate Institute of Compulsory Education at the 
National Hualien Teachers College and a member of the central 
government ministry of education, over 20 billion NT dollars 
has been spent to support the development of schools in areas 
which have fallen behind the national average.  Many of these 
schools are located in remote areas that are home to Taiwan\'s 
aboriginal peoples.  Tian believes much of this funding has 
been misspent, particularly with regard to improving the 
education of Taiwan indigenous people.  Instead of focusing 
on their history, students in these areas, regardless of 
ethnicity, are being forced from grade school on to take time 
away from studies to prepare for performances to showcase 
native aboriginal dance and dress.  School principals in 
Hualien, during a discussion of Taiwan\'s cultural identity, 
expressed extreme anger and frustration with the central 
government, which they describe as having done little to 
improve the lives of the indigenous people while at the same 
time exploiting their traditional dance and dress to promote 
a new Taiwanese identity.  Professor Tien Tai-wu, Director of 
the Institute of Ethnic Relations and Culture at National 
Dong Hwa University and frequent speaker on the issue of 
national identity in Taiwan, has raised the concerns of 
Taiwan\'s indigenous peoples to the central government with 
little success.  She says she remains pessimistic about the 
government\'s motives because specific educational needs are 
often ignored in favor of spending on cultural performance 
events and conferences. 
 
 
8. (C) COMMENT: Polls show that Taiwan\'s youth already have a 
stronger identification with Taiwan than their parents\' 
generation (Ref A).  The government is clearly attempting to 
capitalize on or actively encourage the growth of this trend 
to create a uniquely Taiwanese identity in arts and 
education.  The DPP\'s objectives are two-fold.  Emphasizing 
Taiwan\'s separate identity appeals to its core support base. 
Programs that enhance the prominence of Hakka and Aboriginal 
culture are calibrated to expand that base by attracting 
ethnic groups that previously voted Blue (Ref B). Whether or 
not this effort is simply partisan politics, or one further 
step towards the larger political goal of creating a separate 
Taiwan identity different than China is a matter of debate. 
In the meantime, many artists and academics feel that while a 
new cultural policy could have been a unifying, inclusive 
force, they say in reality it is having the effect of 
politicizing and polarizing the arts and education 
communities in the way that politics has polarized Taiwan 
society as a whole.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: RICE NOMINATION AND 
WASHINGTON\'S CROSS-STRAIT POLICY 
 
 
A) \"United States\' New Diplomatic Team and Future 
Changes in Cross-Strait Relations\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" observed in 
an editorial (11/19): 
 
\". Will President George W. Bush\'s policy during his 
second term be favorable for Taiwan?  While commenting 
on Bush\'s nomination of Condoleezza Rice as the new 
Secretary of State, many people believe that there 
 
SIPDIS 
should not be many changes [in Bush\'s policy].  But an 
in-depth study would show that Rice\'s personal traits 
as a realist would prevail over her personal traits as 
an idealist and the role Rice will play as the 
Secretary of State will also differ from her role as 
 
SIPDIS 
the National Security Advisor. 
 
\"It is generally believed that religious conservatism 
will dictate Bush\'s second term.  Being a devout 
Christian herself, Rice also received academic training 
in international politics during the Cold War era, so 
she is clearly aware of the importance of strategic 
reality.  Given the fact that the United States already 
has a lot of issues that need to be resolved, including 
the Israeli-Palestinian situation, the aftermath of the 
war in Iraq, and the crisis on the Korean Peninsula, 
there is really no need for Washington to confront 
China just for the sake of advocating democratic and 
moral values. . 
 
\"When it comes to Taiwan, [it is evident that] Beijing 
has put the focus of all its foreign relations on 
preventing Taiwan independence.  Such a development 
overlaps with the United States\' cross-Strait policy 
for the next four years.  Learning from its experience 
over the past two years, the Bush administration must 
make sure that its mechanism `to control the rise of 
tension\' [across the Taiwan Strait] will function 
accordingly.  As the real policy planner for 
Washington\'s policy that `neither side of the Taiwan 
Strait can unilaterally change the status quo,\' Rice 
will surely act very cautiously in implementing the 
policy, [and] not allow the actions of one side to 
provoke the other side to take action unfavorable [to 
the status quo].  We must say this in a very candid 
manner: in the next four years, [Washington\'s] pressure 
will likely fall on the Taiwan side, and the pressure 
will increase as Taiwan pushes for a new constitution. 
.\" 
 
B) \"Bush Needs Stability in Asia\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
editorialized (11/19): 
 
\". It is generally believed that, under Rice\'s 
leadership, the new decision-making team will reshuffle 
the State Department to eliminate opposition and carry 
out Bush\'s hawkish policies. 
 
\"At the moment, Rice should review the State 
Department\'s China policy and handle multilateral 
relations in East Asia with caution.  Moreover, she 
should adjust the methods employed by Powell, who has 
made excessive concessions to China over the past six 
months, and resume the global strategic arrangement 
adopted at the beginning of Bush\'s first term. . 
 
\"An important goal for Bush in reshuffling his 
administration would be to resolve long-standing battle 
between the State Department, White House and Pentagon. 
More importantly, Bush needs to redirect the US\' policy 
in Asia, where it seems to have lost its direction to 
such an extent that it was hurting its allies in order 
to make goodwill gestures to its strategic competitor. 
 
\"The main forum for the US to re-establish order in 
East Asia will be on the sidelines of the APEC summit, 
where Bush will have the opportunity of speaking 
individually with many Asian leaders.  We hope that 
Bush will make the best use of this opportunity to warn 
its competitor while re-emphasizing its commitments to 
allies like Japan and Taiwan.\" 
 
C) \"Frank Talks Essential to Security in the Strait\" 
 
Liu Kuan-teh, a Taipei-based political commentator, 
said in the pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei 
Times\" (11/19): 
 
\"The fact is, any speculation on whether the rotation 
of people dealing in Asian affairs in the new Bush 
Cabinet will bring about a huge change of policy toward 
the region would be an exaggeration.  From a global and 
regional strategic perspective, the second Bush team 
will stick with the old path and pursue an even tougher 
campaign against international terrorism.  When it 
comes to its influence in Asia, the new team will put 
North Korea on top of its priorities. 
 
\"For both policies, Washington will need Beijing to 
cooperate.  But where does Taiwan fit into such a 
transforming international landscape?  The US stated 
quite clearly in its \"Six Assurances\" of 1982 that it 
would not be a mediator between Taiwan and China, and 
this policy has not changed.  However, the role of the 
mediator could be indirect.  Since the growing 
Taiwanese consciousness has met with China\'s closed- 
door policy, Washington has no choice but to play a 
more positive and constructive role in securing peace 
and stability across the Strait. 
 
\"Therefore, initiating the resumption of cross-Strait 
dialogue constitutes the most urgent task for Rice\'s 
new Asian team.  Since President Chen Shui-bian has 
suggested the establishment of a peace and stability 
framework, as well as a non-military buffer zone in the 
Taiwan Strait, the Bush administration should utilize 
every possible channel to encourage leaders from 
Beijing to go to the negotiation table.  The meeting 
between Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao at the 
APEC summit this week is the most appropriate timing 
for Washington to ring the bell. . 
 
\"Only through establishing frank, candid and 
institutionalized channels of communication between 
Taipei and Washington can the second Bush 
administration continue to uphold its commitment to the 
security of Taiwan.\"

SUBJECT: LY ELECTION PREVIEW: TAOYUAN COUNTY 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Taoyuan County, with thirteen seats, is the 
largest Legislative Yuan (LY) election district in Taiwan. 
As in other northern districts, the Democratic Progressive 
Party (DPP) has taken an aggressive nominating strategy and 
at a minimum hopes to parlay its strong showing during the 
2004 presidential election into a modest gain in legislative 
seats, while the Pan-Blue coalition is seeking to preserve 
its eight to five seat advantage gained during the last 
legislative election in 2001.  A disintegrating People\'s 
First Party (PFP), however, increasingly appears unable to 
deliver all three seats it gained in 2001 to the Pan-Blue 
coalition again, and the advantage of Pan-Blue forces is 
likely to be reduced to a one seat margin of seven to six. 
End Summary. 
 
A Close Race Worth Watching 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) With a population of 1.8 million people, Taoyuan is 
the second largest county in Taiwan, after Taipei County, and 
has the largest number of seats for any single election 
district on the island.  The Taoyuan electorate traditionally 
has leaned toward Pan-Blue candidates and its eight to five 
seat distribution in favor of the Pan-Blue was key to 
securing a Pan-Blue majority in the legislature elected in 
2001.  During those elections the Kuomintang (KMT) nominated 
seven candidates and, with 29.8 percent of the vote, won five 
seats.  The PFP grabbed 23.3 percent of the 2001 vote, but 
was less successful in distributing votes among its slate of 
five candidates, filling only three seats.   The Pan-Green 
was able to garner over 40 percent of the vote in 2001, most 
of which (34.4 percent) went to Democratic Progressive Party 
(DPP) candidates who captured five seats. Pan-Blue support 
remained strong in the 2004 presidential election when the 
Lien-Song ticket gained 55 percent of the vote, but the DPP 
believes it can retain support from the 45 percent of the 
electorate that voted for President Chen Shui-bian.  To 
consolidate its vote, the Pan-Blue camp has nominated this 
year a total of ten candidates, down from thirteen in 2001, 
with the reduction coming from PFP, which is nominating only 
two incumbents and one failed candidate. The Pan-Green has 
nominated a total of nine candidates again this year; the DPP 
upped its number from six to seven while its Pan-Green ally, 
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), lowered its nominations 
from three to two. 
 
3. (C) Leading pollsters on Taiwan tell AIT that the race for 
the top six seats in Taoyuan county looks quite stable, with 
the KMT taking two seats, the PFP one, and the DPP three. 
All polls indicate, however, that competition for the 
remaining seven seats will be fierce as the distance between 
the slate of candidates ranking seven through sixteen is 
smaller than the polling margin of error.  The battle for 
these remaining seven seats will be waged primarily between 
candidates from either the KMT or DPP.  A strong showing from 
the TSU or PFP could displace one of the lower ranked 
candidates from their larger coalition partners, but it would 
probably not disturb the projected distribution of seats 
(seven to six) between the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green camps. 
 
The DPP: Poised To Make Slight Gains 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) The DPP upped its number of nominations for 
legislative seats this year because of confidence that it can 
continue to expand its vote in the county, according to DPP 
Taoyuan County Executive Director Chiou Chuang-tien.  DPP 
Survey Center Director Pan Yi-Shuan told AIT on November 10 
that internal party polls show there is enough support in 
Taoyuan to gain six of the DPP\'s seven candidates seats if 
the vote is evenly distributed.  Although the DPP would like 
to see all seven candidates win a seat, Chiou said most 
likely the party will have to drop support for the weakest 
candidate in the final week of the campaign and enforce a 
distribution of votes (peipiao) from the two front runners to 
the sixth candidate.  Chiou is confident that both candidates 
and DPP supporters in Taoyuan will be willing to put aside 
their personal interests and follow party directives to 
ensure the DPP gets six seats. 
 
5. (C) Chiou indicated that the three DPP front runners are 
two incumbents, Peng Tien-fu and Chiu Chui-chen, and former 
candidate for Taoyuan county magistrate, Peng Shao-jin.  The 
two Peng\'s are expected to get a large enough share of the 
ethnic Hakka vote to guarantee them seats.  Two other DPP 
incumbents, Lee Chen-nan and Chen Tsung-yi, have strong 
grass-roots organizations and substantial finances, according 
to Taoyuan County Vice Magistrate Huang Min-kong, and should 
pull through giving the DPP another two seats. Lee Yue-chin, 
Mayor of Ping-Chen city, and Guo Jung-tsung, an incumbent, 
have smaller bases of support and are likely to be the ones 
fighting fiercely with each other to squeeze into the 
thirteenth seat.  Executive Director Chiou said the party is 
concerned that if the DPP vote is spread out too thinly, 
especially between the sixth and seventh ranking DPP 
candidates, one of the two TSU candidates could beat out a 
DPP candidate or could draw off enough Green votes to allow 
another Pan-Blue candidate to squeeze into the top thirteen. 
The KMT: Holding its Own 
------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The KMT is confident that six of the seven candidates 
running under its banner will gain a seat, according to KMT 
Taoyuan County Chairman Fu Chung-hsiung. In Taoyuan, the KMT 
was conservative in its nomination, putting forward only six 
party members -- the seventh, Chen Li-ling, is a New Party 
(NP) member running under the KMT flag.  Unlike in many other 
areas of the island, the KMT is not plagued by a plethora of 
breakaway KMT members running as independents.  The KMT 
front-runners assured of seats, according to Fu, are 
incumbent Chu Fung-chih who enjoys a strong base of support 
among the ethnic Mainland community of retired military 
families, and a young newcomer Wu Chih-yang, the son of KMT 
Vice Chairman Wu Bo-hsiung, who has strong support from his 
father\'s local Hakka political base. Yang Li-huan and Chang 
Chang-tsair, two incumbents, also enjoy a strong local base 
and will be getting enough financial support from the KMT, 
according to Fu, to gain a seat. The other two, incumbent 
Chen Gen-te and Kui-shan district chief Lin Cheng-fung, have 
local bases that will be contested by the TSU\'s Chen 
Chiang-shun and independent Luo Huan-lu, respectively.  Vice 
Magistrate Huang assessed that the two KMT candidates, 
nevertheless, have enough backing to overcome the challenge. 
Political observers in Taoyuan say that Chen Li-ling is not 
competitive as NP support in 2001 was only 15,000 votes and 
these votes are likely to go to Cheng Chin-ling, a PFP 
candidate who has strong support from the ethnic Mainland 
community. 
 
The PFP: On the Verge of Collapse 
--------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) PFP Taoyuan Vice Chairman Yang Chuh-Hsiung says his 
party expects overall support to contract by 20 to 30 percent 
from 2001 levels.  This time he predicted the party will only 
garner about 140,000 votes.  By reducing the slate of 
candidates to three, the PFP hopes to preserve its three 
seats, but even Yang conceded that would be a Herculean task. 
 For starters, the PFP would have to distribute votes from 
its star incumbent, Sun Ta-chien, who was the single largest 
vote winner in all of Taiwan in 2001 and remains a highly 
popular figure.  If Sun takes close to the 90,000 votes he 
received in 2001, a shrinking PFP pie only gives about 50,000 
votes to distribute between the two remaining candidates, 
making it unlikely both would be able to win a seat.  Even if 
Sun supporters decide to help other candidates, Chiu 
Chang-liang, an incumbent breakaway from the PFP running as a 
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NSU) member, is likely to draw 
many PFP votes, according to Vice Magistrate Huang.  With a 
reduced support base, poor track record in distributing 
votes, and competition from former PFP members, the PFP 
appears unlikely to retain its three seats. At best, it can 
hope that Sun will distribute enough votes to incumbent Cheng 
Chin-ling to raise Cheng over the bar. 
 
Comment: Building a Majority One Seat at a Time? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
8. (C) The race in Taoyuan is emblematic of the contrasting 
strategies and positions of the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green forces 
in the north of the island.  Although the Pan-Blue has taken 
a conservative nomination approach and retains significant 
grass-roots support, it is poised to retain only a slight 
edge with a reduced margin of victory that will come 
primarily at the expense of the PFP.  The DPP, on the other 
hand, has made more aggressive nominations in the north 
because it sees room to grow there.  By picking up an 
additional seat in Taoyuan, the DPP will be taking a step 
toward expanding both the Pan-Green coalition\'s 
representation in the LY and the DPP\'s share within the 
Pan-Green coalition.  To do so, however, it must succeed in 
persuading its followers to allocate their votes (peipiao).

1. (C) Summary: Hotly contested Yunlin County (six seats) 
remains one of the most volatile races in the LY campaign. 
The fugitive Magistrate Chang Jung-wei is still missing, but 
he and his criminal case remain the focus of the election. 
Bitter infighting has broken out as candidates realize each 
side overnominated, although the situation is much worse for 
the Pan-Blue.  Unless the Pan-Blue gets its act together and 
rallies behind its strongest candidates, it seems likely that 
each side will take three seats (a gain of one seat for the 
Pan-Green).  End Summary. 
 
The Perils of Polling in Yunlin 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Much has changed in the month since AIT\'s last visit 
(Ref A) to hotly contested Yunlin County, but the outcome of 
the December Legislative Yuan (LY) election remains as 
unpredictable as ever.  Eighteen candidates registered in 
October to compete for Yunlin\'s six seats, and although none 
has officially given up yet, the number of serious contenders 
has narrowed to about ten or eleven, more than initially 
expected.  Several newspaper polls have come out in the last 
few weeks, but local observers are hesitant to make any 
predictions because polls are considered especially 
unreliable in Yunlin County.  As many as 60 percent of those 
surveyed indicate that they are still \"undecided\" or 
otherwise do not want to reveal their preference.  Tai Li-an, 
director of ERA Survey Research Center, a polling company, 
speculated that many people refuse to answer surveys in 
Yunlin \"because they\'re afraid it\'s somebody (such as a 
vote-buyer or a gangster) checking up on them.\"  Yunlin is 
notorious for rampant vote-buying, voter intimidation, and 
the involvement of organized crime in local politics, factors 
that further complicate any efforts at predicting the outcome 
of the election. 
 
Likely to Split 3-3; Independents Remain a Wild Card 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3. (C) Nevertheless, many people AIT spoke with were willing 
to forecast levels of overall support for each side and these 
predictions were remarkably consistent.  Observers on both 
sides said the Pan-Blue (including mavericks) would likely 
get 200,000 votes.  Estimates for the Pan-Green varied from 
130,000 to 150,000 votes.  These numbers would seem to favor 
the Pan-Blue, and both People First Party (PFP) County 
Director Wu Chih-chou and Kuomintang (KMT) County Chairman 
Huang Shang-wen said they are confident that Pan-Blue 
candidates can take four of Yunlin\'s six seats.  However, 
they both acknowledged that because there are more candidates 
running on the Pan-Blue side (as many as seven serious 
contenders against four on the Pan-Green side), there is a 
significant chance the vote might be spread too thinly, 
thereby allowing the Pan-Green to capture three seats. 
Pan-Green observers said their more disciplined nomination 
strategy and better \"peipiao\" vote-distribution make a 3-3 
split the most likely outcome in December.  (Note: The danger 
of overnomination and the role of peipiao in Taiwan\'s 
multi-member districts is explained more fully in Ref B.  End 
Note.) 
 
The Fugitive Magistrate Makes House Calls? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Chang Jung-wei, the fugitive County Magistrate who 
disappeared in August after being implicated in a bribery 
scandal (Ref C), is still missing.  However it is not a 
secret that he is still in Yunlin, as Democratic Progressive 
 
SIPDIS 
Party (DPP) legislator Su Chih-fen noted: \"Chang is still 
here, he\'s still the Magistrate, and he still has influence.\" 
 Rumors abound that he is involved to various degrees in the 
LY election campaign of his younger sister Chang Li-shan, a 
KMT maverick running without a party endorsement.  KMT 
Organizational Development Committee Chairman Liao Feng-te 
said in Taipei that he heard Chang is able to visit 
supporters around the county, and eludes capture by traveling 
in one of five identical vehicles.  Other rumors have him 
attending the funerals of family friends at night, or even 
suggest he might have set up a secret meeting with Chen 
Shui-bian to negotiate a pardon.  KMT County Chairman Huang 
was dismissive of such gossip, saying that \"Chang is too 
famous to appear in public safely.\"  Huang acknowledged, 
however, that Chang is involved in his sister\'s election 
campaign, primarily \"by lending her resources, and using his 
connections.\" 
 
Two Incumbents, the Sister and the Secretary 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Because of the Magistrate\'s support, most observers 
think Chang stands a very good chance of being elected. 
However, KMT incumbent Hsu Shu-po is the only Pan-Blue 
candidate whose seat is considered safe.  Huang said that 
Hsu\'s reliable support comes from his influence with the 
Farmers\' Associations and the connections of his father, a 
former County Magistrate.  The other two Pan-Blue 
front-runners are PFP incumbent Chen Chien-sung and the KMT\'s 
Chang Shuo-wen, whose father is the Farmland Irrigation 
Association Chairman.  However, Chang is also the 
Magistrate\'s former secretary and much of his support comes 
from the Magistrate\'s faction, noted DPP legislator Su.  If 
the Magistrate is really urging his supporters to vote for 
his sister, Su said, \"Chang Shuo-wen might lose his seat.\" 
 
The Loser, The Snubbed Incumbent, and Two Gangsters 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
6. (C) Most observers say that former legislator Hou 
Hui-hsien, the KMT\'s third nominee, is unlikely to win 
election, since she also ran and failed to take a seat in the 
2001 LY election.  Depending on how much support she gets, 
however, she might siphon off enough Pan-Blue votes to allow 
the Pan-Green to capture an extra seat.  KMT incumbent Tseng 
Tsai Mei-tso, who is reportedly upset at being passed over 
 
SIPDIS 
for nomination in favor of Hou despite having received the 
most KMT votes in 2001, has decided to run as an independent. 
 Tseng\'s level of support is abnormally high for an 
independent, and rumors abound as to the reasons why.  PFP 
County Director Wu speculated that DPP legislator Su is 
helping her in an attempt to win the support of Tseng\'s 
faction for her planned candidacy in next year\'s County 
Magistrate election.  However, when AIT met with Su, she had 
almost nothing positive to say about Tseng. 
 
7. (C) Gossip tabloids have offered another explanation for 
Tseng\'s performance.  The cover of a recent issue had photos 
 
SIPDIS 
of her meeting with alleged representatives of the 
Yamaguchi-gumi, a major Japanese Yakuza clan.  The article 
claimed that the group is actively helping her with her 
reelection campaign.  When asked about these rumors, KMT 
County Chairman Huang laughed and said, \"Oh, that would be 
her little brother.\"  Tseng\'s brother, he explained, is a 
major figure in the Yunlin underworld.  The PFP\'s Wu said 
that her brother is known as \"Blackbeard\" and will ensure 
that she gets all the underground vote.  He added that he 
thinks she is more likely to win than Chang Li-shan, the 
Magistrate\'s sister.  Another gangster, former KMT legislator 
Lin Ming-yi, is running under the Nonpartisan Solidarity 
Union (NSU) banner.  Huang was dismissive of this threat, 
saying Lin\'s influence on the final outcome would not be 
large, because \"he\'s out of money now and can\'t afford to buy 
votes anymore.\" 
 
The DPP\'s Underground Radio Snake-Oil Salesman 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
8. (C) DPP incumbent Lin Kuo-hua\'s seat is widely considered 
safe.  Peipiao will help one, and maybe both, of the other 
nominees win election.  Although he was considered the weaker 
candidate by observers in October, Chen Hsien-chung now looks 
the more likely of the two to win election.  The KMT\'s Huang 
said this is because Chen is constantly reminding voters that 
he was personally asked by Chen Shui-bian to run for 
election.  The other DPP nominee, Lin Shu-shan, is less 
likely to win, said County Information Director Hung Po-lin, 
a KMT appointee, because he is best known for running an 
unlicensed radio station on which he sells overpriced vitamin 
supplements of dubious medicinal value.  Huang added that 
because of Lin\'s negative image, DPP voters might not abide 
by a peipiao scheme that demands they vote for him.  DPP 
legislator Su was silent about Lin, explaining her decision 
to help only Chen\'s campaign by saying \"we\'re from the same 
hometown.\" 
 
The TSU\'s Activist Councilwoman 
------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Su is also actively campaigning on behalf of her 
friend, TSU County Councilwoman Yin Ling-ying, who has been 
her ally in her long battle with Magistrate Chang Jung-wei. 
Over the past few years, Su and Yin have opposed many of 
Chang\'s construction and development plans on environmental 
as well as ethical grounds, accusing him of taking bribes and 
giving contracts to friends and relatives.  His current legal 
predicament was the result of Yin\'s efforts.  Her popularity 
with voters has been boosted by the bad publicity the 
Magistrate gets, so Su and Yin take every available 
opportunity they can find to criticize Chang.  However, 
another TSU County Councilmember, Lee Chien-sheng, said he is 
worried that the DPP will try to squeeze out Yin if it does 
not have enough votes for all three of its own candidates. 
Information Director Hung offered a similar assessment, but 
said the attack had already begun.  He explained that Lin 
Kuo-hua and his allies on the County Council have started 
criticizing her for being too obstructionist, thereby keeping 
needed development and jobs out of Yunlin. 
 
Comment: Infighting to be Expected 
---------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) The type of bitter infighting that is breaking out in 
Yunlin County is typical of an overnominated district in 
Taiwan\'s multi-member single non-transferable vote system 
(Ref B).  Candidates on both sides have all but stopped 
campaigning against their opponents in the other camp in 
favor of trying to steal easier votes from their \"allies\". 
The degree to which parties on either side can get voters to 
rally around their strongest candidates and drop the weakest 
will determine the final makeup of Yunlin\'s LY seats.  The 
Pan-Green side will have a much easier job of this as they 
only have four candidates.  If the DPP were to drop one of 
its candidates, the Pan-Green would be all but assured of 
taking three seats.  Given the chaos on the Pan-Blue side, 
however, this might not be necessary or even desirable.  If 
the Pan-Blue divides its votes particularly poorly, the 
Pan-Green even stands a slim chance of getting all four 
candidates elected. 
 
11. (C) The biggest variable is how the vote will be split 
among Pan-Blue candidates, and that is difficult to predict 
until after the vote-buying has begun in earnest.  The KMT 
would not likely be able to sacrifice a candidate 
successfully even if it tried.  KMT candidates are far less 
disciplined than DPP candidates, and the sacrificed candidate 
would likely continue campaigning independently, just like 
all the mavericks who lost in the KMT primaries.  With seven 
serious candidates on the Pan-Blue side (with and without 
party endorsements), it will not be easy to hold the 
Pan-Green to its current two seats, even with the expected 
advantage in votes (200,000 vs. as little as 130,000 on the 
Pan-Green side).  The most likely outcome still appears to be 
three seats for each side, which will represent a gain of one 
seat for the Pan-Green in its quest to build a majority in 
the LY.

 1.  Summary:  AIT Econ Chief delivered reftel demarche to 
Ministry of Economic Affairs Vice Minister Steve Chen on 
November 17, 2004.  Chen was familiar with the case and said 
that Taiwan has about a month before it would need to submit 
a report to the World Customs Organization.  Apparently, 
Taiwan has yet to make a final determination on the proper 
classification of the Tyco thermistors.  End Summary. 
 
2.  On November 17, 2004, AIT Econ Chief used a previously 
scheduled meeting with Ministry of Economic Affairs Vice 
Minister Chen Ruey-long (Steve Chen) to deliver reftel 
demarche regarding Tyco\'s appeal of Taiwan Customs\' 
classification of its electronic thermistor devices.  Even 
though we had not been able to give Chen advance notice of 
this topic, he was clearly familiar with the issues involved. 
 
 
3.  Citing the relevant Harmonized System tariff numbers from 
memory, he noted that the World Customs Organization had 
recommended that the devices be classified as resistors, but 
added that the WCO has some divergent views on this issue. 
As he explained it, the WCO recommends classifying the 
devices under HS 8533, but also believes that a case can be 
made for classifying them under HS 8536. 
 
4.  Chen said that he had chaired a recent meeting with the 
Ministry of Finance and Customs about Tyco\'s appeal of 
Customs\' classification of the devices.  Clearly aware of 
Taiwan\'s obligations to respond to WCO rulings, Chen said 
that he has asked Taiwan Customs to review the case.  If 
Customs continues to believe that the devices should be 
classified as fuses rather than resistors, then he has 
requested Customs to prepare a report for the WCO explaining 
this decision.  Chen said that Taiwan has a two month period 
in which to provide comments to WCO and has about one month 
left before the report is due.  We expect that Taiwan will 
use the full two months to mull over this classification 
decision. 
 
5.  Finally, Chen noted that the issue is complicated by the 
fact that a Taiwan company has filed a case against Taiwan 
Customs over classification of the devices.  He also noted 
that a fine of some type has been levied against Tyco and 
that Tyco believes the fine is unjustified.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: BUSH-HU MEETING AT APEC, RICE 
NOMINATION 
 
 
1. Bush-Hu Meeting at APEC 
 
A) \"The United States Casts a Curse on the Futures of 
Both Sides of the Taiwan Strait\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
editorialized (11/22): 
 
\". It seems inevitable for Washington to describe [its 
`consistent\'] position regarding the cross-Strait 
situation as a `curse\' because, after all, either side 
of the Taiwan Strait is constantly testing the bottom 
line of the other side intentionally or 
unintentionally.  On the surface, it seems that 
Beijing\'s logic is that `China will use force if Taiwan 
declares independence\'; whereas Taipei\'s logic is 
`Taiwan will declare independence if China uses force.\' 
But in reality, China has never slowed down its steps 
in expanding its military buildup, and Taiwan has never 
slowed down its pace in probing for the institution of 
a new constitution or referendum under the slogan of 
`no independence.\'  The gaps between words and 
behaviors have provided an excuse for the hawkish 
faction within both sides to escalate their 
confrontations.  A consequence of this spurring each 
other on has also forced the United States to state 
[its position] more and more explicitly. 
 
\"As a matter of fact, the curse that the United States 
has cast on both sides of the Taiwan Strait with regard 
to the \"consistency\" of its one-China framework has 
produced a certain chemical reaction in the subtle 
triangular relationship between Washington, Beijing and 
Taipei.  The chemical reaction is that both sides of 
the Strait seem rather uninterested in improving their 
mutual relationship but are trying every means they can 
to work on their relationship with the United States. 
The formal talks on cross-Strait issues by President 
Chen have begun to focus more and more on `stabilizing 
Washington,\' while statements made during election 
campaigns seem to be \"irritating Beijing\" whether 
intentional or not.  The consequence [of Chen\'s 
approach] resembles the summit between President George 
W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao in the way that 
Bush used Chen\'s formal speeches aimed at alleviating 
cross-Strait tensions to persuade Beijing, and Hu, in 
return, uses Chen\'s campaign rhetoric to lodge 
complaints with Washington. Such a model has recurred 
several times this year.  If judged from the 
consequence, chances are high that the results are 
unfavorable for Taipei.  Was Taipei not the victim 
[following][Chinese Premier] Wen Jiabao\'s visit to the 
United States at the end of last year and Secretary of 
State Colin Powell\'s visit to China last month?  No 
wonder whenever there are high level contacts between 
U.S. and Chinese officials, the only focus of Taipei\'s 
administration falls on whether there will be any 
`unexpected remarks\' by the United States. 
 
\"It is expected that after the year-end legislative 
elections, no matter what the final results are, the 
newly elected legislators will simultaneously explode 
the issues of `instituting a new constitution\' and 
`referendum\' by `amending the referendum law and by 
`starting the process of amending the constitution.\' 
The expected situation will be that the Pan-Green 
Alliance will be the initiators of the two issues while 
the Pan-Blue Alliance would probably not hold it back 
any longer.  Will such a development break the curse 
set by the United States?  We are all eyes.\" 
 
B) \"Bush, Hu Each Express Their Own Views under the one 
China Curse\" 
 
Washington correspondent Vincent Chang said in the 
conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
(11/22): 
 
\"The White House official\'s move to interpret 
[Washington\'s] cross-Strait policy using the statement 
that `consistency is the key\' was a repetition of 
Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly\'s comments at 
the House International Relations Committee hearing 
April 20, in which he indicated that the `status quo\' 
across the Taiwan Strait should be defined by the 
United States.  The White House official\'s remark also 
demonstrated that the Bush administration\'s 
determination is to handle the cross-Strait situation 
from its own perspective. 
 
\"In other words, during its second term, the Bush 
administration may likely demand more strongly that 
Beijing and Taipei act according to the rules set by 
the United States.  Such a move by the White House may 
be pro-active, but its purpose is to passively defend 
the U.S.-defined status quo in the Taiwan Strait; this 
is why Washington chose to use the `consistent\' 
principle to stop both sides of the Taiwan Strait in 
order to ensure that neither side would transgress 
outside the United States\' consistent policy and thus 
put the region in danger. 
 
\"Judged from this perspective, the Bush administration 
has evidently learned from its previous experiences 
over the past four years in dealing with both sides of 
the Taiwan Strait and it will demonstrate greater 
confidence during its second term to maintain a dynamic 
balance of the cross-Strait situation.  The Taiwan 
government, as a result, will have less room to move 
around like it did over the past four years if it wants 
to go beyond Washington\'s `consistent\' principle.\" 
 
2. Rice Nomination 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" editorialized (11/20): 
 
\". With Rice\'s ascent to the top foreign policy post, 
what\'s in store for Washington\'s China policy?  Will it 
bode well for Taiwan and cross-strait relations? 
 
\"Nobody knows.  But one thing is certain: Washington\'s 
one China policy will not change.  Washington will 
continue to sell arms to Taiwan, to be sure.  But it 
would be wrong for Taiwan to assume that the neo- 
conservatives in the Bush administration will tolerate 
President Chen to keep taking dangerous moves toward 
independence, which would spell trouble for Washington. 
. 
 
\"Is Rice capable of doing the same as Henry Kissinger 
did for Nixon three decades ago?  We hope not, but 
nobody can rule out the possibility.  In realpolitik, 
all that counts is national interests, not moral 
principles.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U) The United States\' unofficial relations with Taiwan 
focus on regional security and trade.  Taiwan is considering 
the purchase of USD 18 billion in military equipment from 
the U.S.  Outstanding trade issues include intellectual 
property rights, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications 
market access, and rice imports.  December 11 legislative 
elections will determine if President Chen\'s Democratic 
Progressive Party will gain control of Taiwan\'s legislature 
for the first time.  The economy is returning to strong 
growth after Taiwan\'s first recession in half a century. 
Despite the impact of cross-Strait political tensions, the 
economy increasingly depends on exports to Taiwan\'s PRC- 
based manufacturing.  The primary concern of Taiwan\'s 
aviation industry is the lack of direct air links with the 
PRC.  (End summary.) 
 
U.S.-Taiwan Relations - Security and Trade 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U) On January 1, 1979, the United States changed its 
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.  In the U.S.- 
P.R.C. Joint Communique that announced the change, the 
United States recognized the Government of the People\'s 
Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and 
acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one 
China.  The Joint Communique also stated that within this 
context the people of the United States would maintain 
cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with 
the people on Taiwan.  In April 1979 the Taiwan Relations 
Act (TRA) created the legal authority for the establishment 
of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), a private 
nonprofit corporation.  U.S. Government visitors to Taiwan 
are considered AIT consultants while conducting USG business 
in Taiwan and must travel on a tourist passport.  Travel by 
USG senior officials to Taiwan is carefully controlled and 
rare; your visit will attract attention. 
 
3.  (U) Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States is 
committed to offering military equipment that Taiwan needs 
to defend itself.  The Legislative Yuan is currently 
considering a USD 18 billion special budget, which will 
allow Taiwan to purchase diesel submarines, P-3C anti- 
submarine patrol aircraft, and PAC-III anti-missile 
batteries.  Consideration of the budget bill has been 
delayed until after the December 11 elections. 
 
4.  (SBU) Market access and trade issues are the main 
concerns in U.S.-Taiwan economic relations.  Taiwan joined 
the WTO in 2002 and committed to reduce barriers to trade in 
several areas, including telecommunications and government 
procurement.  Many of these commitments remain incomplete. 
For several years, intellectual property rights have also 
been a key point of contention.  Taiwan has been a center 
for piracy of optical media and has seen an influx of 
counterfeit products, including pharmaceuticals and branded 
goods, from China.  However, in the last year, Taiwan has 
improved enforcement of its intellectual property laws, 
passed an amended Copyright Law, and proposed legislation to 
create a data-exclusivity regime for pharmaceuticals.  These 
improvements have led the U.S. Trade Representatives office 
to open an out-of-cycle review to consider Taiwan\'s status 
on the Special 301 Priority Watch List.  The U.S. still has 
concerns about market access for pharmaceuticals and 
telecommunications service providers.  We also continue 
discussions with Taiwan on its tariff and quota regime for 
rice imports.  On November 29, the U.S. and Taiwan will 
resume talks under the Trade and Investment Framework 
Agreement to further progress toward resolving some of these 
outstanding issues. 
 
Politics - More Divided Government? 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) When Taiwan\'s President Chen Shui-bian was first 
elected in 2000, it marked the first transition of political 
power in Taiwan since World War II and the consolidation of 
democracy in Taiwan.  Chen\'s independence-leaning Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) has asserted increasing control over 
the executive branch bureaucracy, which had been dominated 
for decades by the Kuomintang (KMT).  In March 2004, Chen 
was narrowly reelected with less than 50.1 percent of the 
popular vote.  A controversial shooting incident the day 
before the election, in which Chen and Vice President 
Annette Lu were mildly injured, and the KMT candidates\' 
refusal to accept the results of the 2004 election have 
contributed to a particularly bitter partisan environment. 
 
6.  (SBU) Legislative elections scheduled for December 11, 
2004, will determine whether Taiwan will have another three 
years of divided government.  The KMT, with its opposition 
partner the People First Party (PFP), forms the \"Pan-Blue\" 
alliance, which controls the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan\'s main 
legislative body.  The DPP with its \"Pan-Green\" partner, the 
strongly pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), 
hopes to take control of the legislature for the first time. 
Many observers predict that neither camp will have a strong 
majority.  Both camps will need to form ad-hoc alliances to 
move legislation.  That could slow passage of needed 
economic and financial reforms, but it could also discourage 
legislation that might increase cross-Strait tensions. 
 
Economy - Resurgent Growth 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Taiwan is the 17th largest economy in the world. 
For nearly 50 years before 2001, Taiwan experienced rapid 
economic expansion, low unemployment, and low inflation -- 
often called \"Taiwan\'s Economic Miracle.\"  In 2001, the 
economy contracted for the first time since 1952, largely 
due to fallout from the global high technology industry 
downturn that reduced demand for exports in the key markets 
of the U.S., Europe and Japan.  After two more years of 
disappointing growth in 2002 and 2003, the economy has 
boomed this year with double-digit export growth. 
Economists predict that Taiwan\'s economy will once again 
return to strong growth in 2004, with real GDP growth 
reaching nearly 6 percent. 
 
8.  (U) Exports of information technology and other high- 
tech goods continue to be one of the main drivers of 
Taiwan\'s economy, even as many firms move manufacturing 
operations to China or Southeast Asia.  In the first half of 
2004, Taiwan\'s exports grew 26 percent over the same period 
last year.  Semiconductors have been an especially important 
component of Taiwan\'s economic success.  Today, flat panel 
displays are also playing an increasing role.  Taiwan\'s 
government has plans to continue to stimulate the growth of 
these high-tech sectors, as well as to develop new 
technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology. 
Taiwan\'s government also hopes to diversify Taiwan\'s economy 
beyond manufacturing into digital content, logistics, 
finance and other services. 
 
9.  (U) Taiwan\'s macroeconomic policy has sought to maintain 
stable exchange rates, low inflation and low interest rates. 
Taiwan, after China and Japan, has the third largest stock 
of foreign exchange reserves in the world.  It has made 
progress in strengthening a banking system that was in 
serious trouble in 2001 and 2002 and improving the 
supervision of financial institutions.  However, the Taiwan 
government has yet to fully deal with a number of insolvent 
institutions.  Taiwan\'s eroding tax base, a \"no new taxes\" 
pledge, and growing social welfare costs have left the Chen 
administration with a large budget deficit and limited 
options to pursue new spending on key economic and defense 
objectives.  The budget crunch will continue unless Taiwan 
manages to choose between the politically unfeasible options 
of raising taxes, cutting popular social programs, or 
running historically high deficits.  None of these 
alternatives will be politically palatable, especially if 
political power is evenly divided in the Legislative Yuan. 
 
Cross-Strait Tension and Economic Integration 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) While strained political relations with Beijing 
dominate both Taiwan\'s domestic politics and national 
security issues, investment in the Mainland and trade across 
the Strait are increasingly the driving forces in Taiwan\'s 
economy.  The ruling DPP promised early on in the current 
election season to keep cross-Strait relations and issues of 
sovereignty out of the legislative elections.  Nevertheless, 
political rhetoric is again increasingly focused on the 
government\'s and the president\'s approach to cross-Strait 
relations.  The official name of the Republic of China and 
President Chen\'s proposal to write a new constitution for 
Taiwan are also sensitive domestic political issues that 
threaten to increase cross-Strait tension.  Taiwan companies 
that have supported the DPP have found their activities in 
the PRC subject to increased scrutiny. 
 
11.  (U) In 2003, China replaced the U.S. as Taiwan\'s number 
one trading partner.  Exports to the PRC and Hong Kong make 
up 35 percent of Taiwan\'s total exports.  The PRC accounted 
for more than 70 percent of Taiwan\'s outward foreign 
investment in the first half of 2004.  Much of Taiwan\'s 
labor-intensive manufacturing has moved to the Mainland, 
especially in industries like textiles, shoes, toys, 
furniture, etc.  In information technology and other high- 
tech industries, the manufacture of technology and capital- 
intensive components has in large measure stayed in Taiwan, 
while downstream assembly of final products has moved to 
Mainland China.  However, increasingly Taiwan investors are 
moving the manufacture of upstream high-tech components to 
the PRC as well.  Despite pressure from businesses, the 
Taiwan government continues to restrict investment in the 
Mainland for certain categories of high-tech manufacturing. 
Most of the electronics consumer goods manufactured by 
Taiwan firms in the PRC are subsequently exported to the 
U.S., Japan, or Europe.  In that sector, Taiwan\'s economy is 
not reliant on domestic demand in the PRC.  Other Taiwan 
industries that have high levels of Mainland trade and 
investment, especially the cement, petrochemical and steel 
industries, are more strongly influenced by changes in the 
PRC economy. 
 
Aviation Issues -Direct Links, ICAO, Cargo 7ths 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
12.  (U) The lack of direct aviation links between Taiwan 
and the PRC is the primary concern of Taiwan\'s aviation 
industry and the largest remaining obstacle to deeper 
economic relations across the Strait.  In February 2003 
during the Lunar New Year, Taiwan airlines were permitted to 
conduct charter flights between Taipei and Shanghai with 
stops in Hong Kong.  The Chen government has indicated that 
it wants to negotiate direct charter flights in 2005 for 
both Taiwan and PRC carriers with no stopovers as the next 
step toward regular direct aviation links (reported 
reftels).  On both sides of the Strait this is a highly 
charged political issue.  To date, the PRC government has 
not accepted Chen\'s invitation to negotiate charter flights, 
insisting that Taiwan first accept the \"one-China\" principle 
and its corollary that cross-Strait flights would be 
\"domestic.\" 
 
13.  (U) Taiwan seeks to join the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO) as a full member or observer. 
Because it is not a sovereign state, Taiwan is excluded from 
such UN organizations and many other international 
organizations.  Entry into organizations such as ICAO and 
the World Health Organization that focus on economic and 
health issues has been a key priority of Taiwan\'s foreign 
policy.  The U.S. supports Taiwan\'s efforts to gain 
increased access to ICAO discussions and technical 
information to improve its flight safety efforts. 
 
14.  (U) In 2003, AIT urged Taiwan to add \"seventh freedom\" 
rights for all-cargo services to our bilateral open skies 
agreement and to join the Multilateral Agreement on 
Liberalization of International Air Transportation, which 
includes cargo sevenths.  The Taiwan government rejected 
both proposals.  Taiwan\'s carriers rely heavily on cargo 
shipments to make them profitable and support continued 
restrictions of international participation in Taiwan\'s 
cargo routes.  Taiwan\'s recently concluded bilateral air 
services agreement with South Korea excludes cargo fifth 
freedom rights.  Taiwan and South Korea signed the new 
agreement on September 1 after a dozen years without direct 
air links.

SUBJECT: TAIWAN CURRENCY APPRECIATION 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  On November 22, Taiwan\'s Central Bank of 
China (CBC) intervened in foreign exchange markets to slow 
the ongoing appreciation of the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) after 
the currency reached its highest levels in almost four years. 
  Speculators are moving additional foreign capital to Taiwan 
in anticipation of further declines in the USD.  A CBC 
official told AIT that despite the weak USD, Taiwan would 
continue to keep most of its foreign exchange reserves in USD 
denominated assets, placing safety and liquidity ahead of 
profit.  End summary. 
 
Cause and Effect of the Rising NTD 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Taiwan CBC officials have confirmed to AIT that they 
intervened in currency markets on November 22 to slow the 
rise of the NTD.  They claim the intervention was slight, 
less than one percent of market volume.  The NTD opened on 
November 23 at NTD 32.495 per USD after CBC intervention, 
slightly down from its 44-month high close of NTD 32.420 per 
USD on November 18.  The value of the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) 
in USD terms has risen sharply in recent weeks, gaining more 
than 4 percent on the USD since late September.   However, 
the Korean Won has gained more against the USD in recent 
weeks than has the NTD, and the Japanese Yen has also gained 
about four percent. 
 
3.  (C) The ongoing appreciation of Asian currencies and an 
announcement by Morgan Stanley that it will increase the 
weighting of Taiwan share prices in its international capital 
index have attracted foreign capital to Taiwan.  Foreign net 
purchases of Taiwan\'s traded stocks have already reached NTD 
200 billion this year.  The widening U.S. trade and Federal 
fiscal deficits, and widespread anticipation of a loosened 
trading band for China\'s Renminbi has fueled speculation of 
continued declines in the value of the USD.  The impact on 
the competitiveness of Taiwan companies will be closely 
linked to exchange rates in Japan and South Korea, where 
Taiwan\'s main commercial rivals are located. 
 
4.  (C) Until November 22, CBC claimed it had made no 
significant effort to check the NTD appreciation.  However, 
CBC officials admitted to AIT that they routinely \"manage\" 
foreign exchange reserves to avoid losses.   In an indication 
of some tolerance for NTD appreciation, CBC officials noted 
to AIT that currency appreciation is an effective way to 
fight import-led inflation and Taiwan was among the first 
Asian economies to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in raising 
interest rates (CBC raised Taiwan\'s discount rate by 0.25 
percent on September 30). 
 
The Middle Way 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The criteria used by CBC to manage the NTD exchange 
rates are closely guarded.  However, some AIT financial 
sector contacts believe that changes in the value of the NTD 
closely follow fluctuations in the USD-Yen exchange rate, and 
that the NTD keeps to an average value between the two 
currencies; i.e., the NTD usually gains or loses value in 
concert with the Yen\'s gains or losses against the USD.  In 
addition, many Taiwan companies involved in international 
trade have reportedly already taken action to hedge against 
this risk, as they have been urged to do by Taiwan\'s Minister 
of Economics.  On November 8, when the NTD reached a six 
month high of 32.89 per USD, Minister Ho tried to reassure 
the business community by saying the NTD appreciation thus 
far would not have a significant negative impact on Taiwan\'s 
external trade.  The relative stability of the NTD exchange 
rate against the USD is viewed as a positive factor by the 
business community. 
 
6.  (C) While local economists predict some impact on 
Taiwan\'s exports to the United States, appreciation in the 
current 4 percent range is seen as tolerable.  However, 
several Taiwan industry associations have openly called for 
CBC to intervene to slow the NTD\'s \"too rapid\" rise, and with 
legislative elections scheduled for December 11, the NTD 
appreciation is a sensitive political issue.  On November 20, 
the Vice Minister of Economic Affairs urged Taiwan 
manufacturers to speed up the globalization of their business 
operations to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations. 
There will be additional upward pressure on the NTD at the 
end of the month, when exporters often sell off their USD 
receipts. 
 
U.S. Election Profitable for Central Bank 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
7.  (C) CBC Foreign Exchange Department Director General 
George Chou told AIT that CBC\'s Foreign Exchange Trading team 
monitors global foreign exchange markets well beyond regular 
office hours.  In spite of the 13-hour time difference some 
team members are assigned to monitor trading activity in New 
York.  Chou receives updates on U.S. market trends, farm 
reports, payroll figures, and other financial reports well 
into the night.  Chou mentioned that on the night of the U.S. 
presidential election, his foreign exchange trading team 
earned USD 300,000 from management of CBC\'s assets in foreign 
markets and capitalizing on USD fluctuations during the 
ballot counting. 
 
CBC Will Continue to Hold USG Bonds 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
8.  (C) In general, Chou said, Taiwan\'s CBC follows three 
principles in managing its foreign exchange reserves: safety, 
liquidity, and profitability, with safety and liquidity the 
priorities.   When international situations pose a threat to 
the safety of Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves, CBC will 
take defensive action, including moving assets out of a 
region.  To illustrate this point, Chou mentioned that CBC 
stopped including Hong Kong dollars in its foreign exchange 
portfolio after Hong Kong\'s retrocession to China, since this 
made Hong Kong less secure, from Taiwan\'s point of view.  It 
is with safety foremost in mind that CBC will continue to 
hold a large percentage of its assets in U.S. Government 
bonds, and to keep large bank deposits in the United States. 
While the exact ratios of foreign currencies in Taiwan\'s 
portfolio of USD 235 billion (as of September 2004) in 
foreign exchange reserves is considered confidential 
information, local economists believe it is roughly USD 65%, 
Euro 20%, and Japanese Yen 15%. 
 
Other Factors Influencing the NTD 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) Chou mentioned that another factor affecting the 
composition of CBC\'s foreign exchange reserves is interest 
rates.  The U.S. Fed\'s raising interest rates reinforces 
CBC\'s intent to keep its deposits in U.S. banking 
institutions.  However, it is also widely believed that over 
the past two years CBC has increased its holdings of Euros to 
take advantage of their appreciation trend.   The PRC\'s 
recent raising of interest rates for the first time in nine 
years and new lending restrictions designed to cool economic 
growth are expected to result in an increased outflow of 
capital from Taiwan to China Mainland as PRC-based Taiwan 
companies turn to Taiwan financial institutions for cheaper 
working capital.  The capital inflow into Taiwan precipitated 
by the Morgan Stanley weighting increase is seen as short 
term.  As the net inflow of capital lessens in coming months, 
this source of pressure on the NTD to appreciate will also 
lessen.  However, Taiwan\'s relatively high growth rates 
compared with other Asian economies, and close economic 
relations with China still make the NTD an attractive target 
for speculators. 
 
Contradictory Goals 
----------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Comment: There will always be tradeoffs among CBC 
goals of safety, liquidity, and profitability for Taiwan\'s 
foreign exchange reserves.  Even a small percentage decline 
in the value of Taiwan\'s USD 235 billion foreign exchange 
reserve translates into an enormous loss.  In spite of Chou\'s 
assurances that Taiwan will keep the bulk of its foreign 
exchange reserves in USD denominated assets, as a banker 
conditioned to minimize risk and maximize profit, he will 
surely face strong pressure to protect against the loss of 
value that would result from further declines in the USD. 
From a purely economic point of view the NTD appreciation 
thus far will have only a minor impact on Taiwan\'s external 
trade, especially given the even greater appreciation in the 
currencies of other economies.  Under the additional pressure 
of loud opposition from local businesses to the rapid NTD 
appreciation, CBC has opted to slow the NTD\'s rise prior to 
the December 11 elections.   There is likely to be continued 
upward pressure on the NTD in coming weeks.  End comment.

SUBJECT: TAIWAN PESSIMISTIC ABOUT EU ARMS EMBARGO 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal; Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary. Taiwan officials say that there is little 
they can do to prevent the eventual lifting of the EU arms 
embargo against the PRC.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) 
officials are confident that the embargo will not be lifted 
this year, but they expect Beijing to offer some sort of 
concessions on human rights that will give EU states the 
cover they need to remove the ban by the end of 2005.  Taipei 
maintains that Beijing is using its economic leverage to sway 
EU members and has offered substantial economic carrots to 
France and Germany in exchange for leading the charge.  MOFA 
officials assert that another major reason France and Germany 
want to lift the embargo is to counter U.S. global power. 
Taipei has focused its lobbying efforts with human rights 
organizations and the Vatican.  However, MOFA officials admit 
that Taiwan does not have much leverage to counter Beijing 
and is relying on U.S. and Japanese opposition to slow down 
the EU decision.  End summary. 
 
No Consensus...Yet 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) MOFA officials believe that the EU arms embargo will 
not be lifted this year because member states are too far 
from a consensus on the matter.  MOFA Deputy Director General 
(DDG) for European Affairs Hsieh Chun-teh told AIT that he is 
hearing that the Nordic countries and many of the 
Central-Eastern European members are opposed to a quick 
lifting of the embargo in light of the PRC\'s lack of progress 
on human rights, the potential impact of arms sales on 
regional stability, and opposition from key EU allies such as 
the U.S. and Japan.  However, Hsieh told AIT he is not 
optimistic that a decision could be delayed past next year 
because of Beijing\'s increasing economic power and the 
growing influence of Germany and France inside the EU.  Hsieh 
also stated that at the upcoming EU-PRC summit in December, 
Beijing will likely lobby key fence-sitters with promises of 
economic incentives.  Hsieh told AIT that the summit will be 
important because it will reveal more clearly how the various 
member states come down on the issue. 
 
France and Germany Leading the Charge 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Taiwan officials assert that Beijing has adeptly 
convinced Germany and France to take the lead in convincing 
other EU member states to lift the embargo.  Vice Foreign 
Minister Michael Kau told AIT that he believes French 
President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder were personally leading the efforts for economic 
and geo-political reasons.  He said the main goal behind 
France and Germany\'s efforts is to counter-balance U.S. 
political and economic power.  MOFA DDG Hsieh separately 
noted that the commercial success of Chirac\'s most recent 
visit to Beijing was a result of Chirac\'s efforts on the arms 
embargo issue.  Hsieh added that in December, Schroeder is 
scheduled to visit Beijing and will likely receive similar 
rewards for his work. 
 
4. (C) Lai I-Chung, the Director of Foreign Policy Studies at 
the Taiwan Think Thank, told AIT that most of the public in 
France and Germany is against lifting the embargo.  Lai said 
that his military contacts in France have told him that most 
mid-level French defense officials do not support lifting the 
embargo, but have been ordered to get into line behind 
Chirac\'s policy.  Lai added that his contacts believe that 
Chirac sees lifting the embargo as a step toward creating a 
multi-polar world, because it would increase tensions between 
Beijing and Washington, allowing France to consolidate power 
and influence in Europe.  As for Germany, Lai asserted that 
Schroeder wants Germany to be more integrated into the EU and 
sees this as an important step.  Lai noted that the German 
Bundestag recently passed a non-binding resolution condemning 
the government\'s decision to support the lifting of the ban. 
Lai commented that the government\'s decision to proceed 
anyway highlights Schroeder\'s determination on this issue. 
UK Sitting on the Fence 
----------------------- 
 
5. (C) MOFA assesses that the UK is playing the middle 
ground, but will probably eventually support lifting the 
embargo.  Hsieh remarked that the UK is \"a clever country\" 
and is still hedging its bets on supporting or opposing the 
lifting of the embargo.  Hsieh said that although London is 
genuinely concerned about China\'s human rights record, the UK 
government does not want to anger Beijing and has thus far 
remained silent on this issue.  Hsieh lamented that this 
leads him to believe that the UK will eventually support 
lifting the ban.  Hsieh maintained that London will likely 
seek certain conditions before the embargo is lifted such as 
limiting the scope of what kind of weapons can be sold to the 
PRC.  Taiwan Think Tank\'s Lai separately told AIT that the 
UK\'s standing has been hurt in the EU by its association with 
the U.S.  He asked rhetorically why should it expend more 
capital by agreeing with the U.S. on this issue - especially 
since the embargo will eventually be lifted. 
 
Strategy, What Strategy? 
------------------------ 
 
6. (C) Taipei has remained largely on the sidelines in the 
diplomatic battle over the embargo.  When asked about MOFA\'s 
plan of action on the issue, MOFA DDG Hsieh told AIT that 
Taipei\'s strategy is to cooperate with Japan and the U.S.  He 
added that Taiwan is using a variety of channels to express 
opposition such as working with human rights organizations 
and the Vatican, but Hsieh admitted that Taiwan has little 
leverage in Europe compared to Beijing.  Hsieh suggested that 
the USG should focus on Central and Eastern Europe because 
they are more inclined to support the U.S. and generally 
don\'t like being pushed around by Germany and France. 
However, he admitted that Taipei has not actively lobbied 
Eastern European capitals.  Separately, Lai told AIT he was 
doubtful that MOFA actually had a viable diplomatic strategy. 
 He said that Taipei should shift its diplomatic focus to 
Eastern Europe because these nations share many common values 
and experiences with Taiwan. 
 
Tactical Barriers, Strategic Clarity 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) While MOFA officials admit that more could be done to 
delay the EU decision, they are clearly resigned to the final 
outcome.  MOFA\'s Hsieh predicted that the issue will be 
finally resolved through a quid pro quo that would have the 
EU overturn the embargo in exchange for a Beijing concession 
on human rights.  DDG Hsieh and his staff told AIT that 
\"Beijing will give something to its EU friends\" to help 
assuage their domestic constituencies.  Hsieh said he is 
pessimistic because lifting the embargo appears to make 
strategic sense on both sides.  Beijing wants to portray 
lifting the ban as a major gauge of the quality of EU-PRC 
relations, he remarked, while the EU sees the issue as a 
means to secure its economic relationship with China.  To a 
certain extent, Hsieh assessed, both Beijing and leading EU 
capitals also see some benefit in using the issue to 
undermine Washington\'s influence in Asia.  As to whether EU 
sourced weapons might eventually be used against U.S. forces, 
Vice Foreign Minister Kau told AIT that any change in the 
PRC\'s military ability would be devastating for Taiwan.  Kau 
added that it is very important that the cross-strait 
military balance be maintained and he encouraged the U.S. to 
emphasize this point to Europe. 
 
Comment: Taipei\'s Fatalistic Diplomatic Strategy 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
8. (C) There is little doubt Taiwan is hoping the U.S. and 
Japan can keep the arms embargo from being lifted for as long 
as possible.  However, it is apparent that MOFA officials 
realize that their influence is limited in the face of 
Beijing\'s economic power and have concluded that there is 
little they can do to change the situation.  As in many other 
areas of the world, Taipei finds itself on the defensive in 
Europe without any realistic plan for holding its ground.  It 
would seem logical for Taipei to seek allies among the new 
democracies in Eastern Europe rather than devoting its 
limited resources lobbying parliaments and human rights 
organizations in the west.  Once again, it appears that 
Taipei is simply cursing its fate and hoping that Washington 
can perform a miracle.

Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Taiwan officials say they are willing to be 
patient with the glacial pace of development in formal 
relations with Japan because they need time to resolve a deep 
internal policy division over how to manage the relationship. 
 The policy debate is driven by sharply divergent assessments 
over future trends in Sino-Japanese relations.  Taiwan\'s 
National Security Council (NSC) is looking to shape a policy 
that seeks to prevent Taiwan from becoming a negative factor 
in Sino-Japanese relations.  They advocate discarding 
Taiwan\'s traditional ties with the Japanese political right 
in favor of interaction with younger, more pragmatic 
policymakers in Tokyo.  NSC moderates and academic observers 
say they fear that association with Japan\'s nationalists will 
not only fail to advance Taiwan-Japan relations, but may also 
make Taiwan an even bigger target for Chinese nationalists 
than it already is.  On the other side of the debate is a 
coalition of pro-independence fundamentalists close to former 
President Lee Teng-hui and a group of foreign policy 
hard-liners in the Executive Yuan (EY).  Both groups seek to 
align Taiwan with Tokyo in expectation of a future strategic 
confrontation between Tokyo and Beijing.  While the NSC has 
the formal lead on Japan policy, President Chen Shui-bian has 
made a series of public statements and personnel assignments 
over the past six months that have favored the hard-liners. 
End Summary. 
 
All Quiet on the Northern Front 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Japan policy officials in Taipei say there have been 
few significant developments in Taiwan-Japan relations since 
Tokyo opened a low-level annual policy dialogue in 2002. 
Taiwan MOFA Japan/Korea Section Chief Kuo Chung-shi said that 
Taiwan was pleased with Japan\'s enhanced support for Taiwan\'s 
observership at the World Health Assembly (WHA) last May, 
opposition to lifting the EU arms embargo on China, and its 
recent moves to grant Taiwan visitors visa-free entry to 
attend the 2005 Aichi Expo.  However, Kuo said that all of 
these initiatives were the result of a Japanese assessment of 
its own interests, rather than skillful diplomacy on Taiwan\'s 
part.  \"Japan\'s health authorities had real concerns about 
having its neighbor outside of the WHO, its military is 
obviously concerned about PLA modernization,\" he added, \"and 
the visa initiative is largely the result of pressure from 
Aichi officials, who expect Taiwanese to be a major source of 
tourists for their expo.\" 
 
3. (C) Kuo noted that the Japanese government, particularly 
the Foreign Ministry, remains reluctant to deepen the 
official relationship for fear of exacerbating already 
strained relations with Beijing.  To illustrate the static 
state of the official relationship, Kuo noted that Japan 
continues to demand that the Taiwan delegation to the annual 
round of quasi-official policy exchanges started in 2002 
(Reftel) be headed by an academic, with the rank of official 
participants from Taiwan\'s MOFA and NSC kept below the 
section chief level.  Kuo added that there has been similarly 
little progress on a bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) 
since the two sides agreed in 2002 to authorize private 
sector think tanks to study the costs and benefits of the 
initiative.  \"It has been studied to death,\" Kuo commented, 
\"but the Japanese keep coming up with excuses over why we 
can\'t move any further.\"  Reading between the lines, Kuo said 
that Tokyo\'s clear message is \"we will negotiate an FTA with 
Taiwan only after we\'ve completed FTA talks with everyone 
else in Asia.\" 
 
A New Policy for a New Japan... 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Taiwan NSC officials nonetheless say they are 
comfortable with slow pace of the relationship, because they 
see overall strategic dynamics working in Taipei\'s favor. 
National Security Council (NSC) Senior Advisor for Asian 
Affairs Lin Chen-wei told AIT that \"Japan is increasingly 
realistic about the challenges it faces in Asia -- protecting 
sea lanes, encouraging the PRC\'s peaceful integration into 
the region and the world economy, and energy security.\"  Lin 
added that these were exactly the same strategic issues 
facing Taiwan.  \"Our task now is to demonstrate to Tokyo that 
we can be a partner in meeting these challenges and are not 
simply a source of further problems in Sino-Japanese 
relations,\" Lin stated.  One new area for contact is the 
field of foreign aid, Lin asserted, both targeting China and 
Southeast Asia.  China\'s environmental and energy policies 
have immediate implications for Taiwan and Japan, Lin 
explained, and the two countries have complementary 
technologies that could help the PRC.  Lin added that Taiwan 
also has comparative advantages in the field of commercial 
development that could assist Japan maintain its economic 
influence both in the PRC and among the overseas Chinese 
business networks in Southeast Asia.  Lin said that 
anti-piracy and law enforcement cooperation, including 
actions against North Korean illicit activities, also offers 
potential for expanded contacts. 
 
5. (C) Lin said that the other reason he is content with the 
slow pace of development in the relationship is that it gives 
the NSC more time to update Taipei\'s Japan policy 
orientation.  Lin asserted that before Tokyo and Taipei can 
create a serious relationship, Taiwan will need to break the 
bad habits of the past.  \"The traditional anti-Communist 
basis underlying Taiwan-Japan relations is no longer relevant 
today,\" he asserted.  Lo Fu-chen, Chairman of the Association 
of East Asian Affairs and recently departed Taiwan 
representative in Tokyo, noted that the long-standing 
division between pro-China and pro-Taiwan politicians in 
Japan is fading into the past.  \"Up-and-coming politicians 
like (Democratic Party of Japan\'s) Maehara Seiji and (LDP 
Acting Secretary General) Abe Shinzo aren\'t pro-China or 
pro-Taiwan,\" he stated, \"they are pro-Japan and will do what 
is best for their own country.\"  Lo added that Taipei needed 
to do more than simply bash the PRC if it wants to build a 
sustainable relationship with Tokyo. 
 
Or an Old Policy for an Old Japan 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Moderates like Lo and Lin acknowledge, however, that 
many do not share the view that PRC-Taiwan-Japan relations 
can become a positive sum game.  Lin said that biggest 
challenge he and his NSC colleagues face is the dominance of 
Lee Teng-hui and his disciples over the Japan policy process. 
 \"These guys are frozen in time,\" complained Lin, \"the 
Japanese they speak is 50 years out of date and their 
contacts, mostly retired Maritime Self-Defense Forces 
admirals, are considered right-wing extremists in Japan.\" 
While NSC Secretary General Chiou I-jen chairs the 
government\'s formal Japan policy inter-agency task force, Lee 
associates hold key Japan policy posts.  Taiwan\'s Tokyo 
representative, Ko Sekai, and his deputy, Chen Hong-chi, are 
long-time Lee associates (Note: Lo is as well, but people 
close to both say they have had a major falling out over 
Lee\'s drift to the fundamentalist extreme.  End Note). 
Officials at MOFA and the NSC say that TECRO Rep. Ko is often 
pursuing his own agenda, greatly complicating management of 
the relationship.  East Asian Affairs Association\'s Lo told 
AIT that \"we are getting constant complaints from Tokyo over 
Ko\'s public remarks on Taiwan sovereignty issues.\" 
 
7. (C) Not all advocates of an anti-PRC Taiwan-Japan alliance 
are elderly fundamentalists, a fact that raises questions 
about the NSC\'s ability to pursue a more moderate line over 
the medium term.  Senior advisors to Premier Yu Shyi-kun form 
another influential hard-line policy node on Japan relations. 
 On the eve of taking his current post in May, Executive Yuan 
(EY) Secretary General Arthur Iap (Ye Guo-xing) complained to 
AIT that, outward appearances notwithstanding, it was Tokyo 
that was more \"realistic\" about the \"China threat\" than 
Washington.  \"Japan doesn\'t voice their fears outwardly 
because it does not serve their immediate interests,\" he 
asserted, \"but when speaking privately, it is clear they 
don\'t harbor the sorts of illusions about prospects for 
\"China\'s peaceful rise\" that many in Washington seem to 
have.\"  Another active player on Japan policy is the Taiwan 
Think Tank, which provides much of the intellectual input 
into Premier Yu\'s foreign policy team.  The think tank 
maintains frequent contacts with conservative Japanese 
counterparts such as the Okazaki Institute and former Prime 
Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro\'s Research Institute for Peace 
Studies (RIPS). 
President Sets the Direction(s) 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) Deputy Secretary 
General Yen Wan-ching, a member of the NSC\'s Japan policy 
committee, told AIT he is pessimistic that the NSC can win 
the bureaucratic battle against the hard-liners.  \"The 
problem is the president,\" Yen continued, \"he is the only one 
who can enforce discipline on the policy debate.\"  Yen 
bemoaned, however, that \"the only time the president even 
thinks about Japan is when there is a Japanese visitor 
sitting in front of him.\"  When the president has spoken on 
Japan policy, he has appeared to side with the hard-liners 
rather than the moderates in his NSC.  For example, during a 
November 20 meeting with Japan Interchange Association 
Chairman Reijiro Hattori, Chen boasted that Taiwan provided 
the intelligence that helped Japan track the Chinese 
submarine that recently strayed into Japanese waters.  During 
the same open press meeting, Chen drew a comparison between 
calls (from Japanese conservatives) for Japan to \"become a 
normal country\" with his own efforts to give Taiwan full 
sovereignty. 
 
Avoiding Bad Company 
-------------------- 
 
9. (C) Moderates inside government and outside analysts warn 
that the future direction of Taipei\'s Japan policy could have 
ramifications beyond the bilateral relationship if it is 
mishandled.  Soochow University Professor Liu Bih-rong warned 
that Taiwan is running long-term risks by siding with Tokyo 
on Sino-Japanese disputes over things like territory.  \"Most 
Chinese can tolerate U.S.-Taiwan relations to a certain 
extent,\" he assessed, \"but they cannot accept the idea of 
Taiwan helping Japan against China, it brings back bitter 
memories.\"  The NSC\'s Lin offered a similar assessment.  \"If 
we aren\'t careful, we could become the target of the growing 
anti-Japan sentiment among the Chinese public,\" he cautioned. 
 Lin added, \"the one thing that motivates Chinese nationalism 
more than the desire for unification is bitterness towards 
Japan.\" 
 
Comment: More About Beijing Than Tokyo 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Taipei\'s policy debate may have a greater impact on 
its ties with Beijing than with Tokyo.  The Japanese 
government has made it clear over the past three years that 
it sets the parameters and pace for the relationship, not 
Taipei.  However, Taiwan\'s public diplomacy, especially its 
positions on disputes between the PRC and Japan, is unlikely 
to escape notice by leaders and the public on the Mainland. 
Taipei\'s repeated embrace of Japanese nationalists like Tokyo 
Governor Ishihara Shintaro, support for Japan\'s position on 
Sino-Japanese territorial disputes, and boasts about 
Taiwan-Japan military cooperation could further exacerbate 
cross-Strait tensions.  These actions may also complicate 
Japan\'s efforts to manage its relationship with Beijing, 
making Tokyo less willing to take risks on issues like the EU 
arms embargo and Taiwan\'s observership in the WHO.

SUBJECT: LIEN, CHEN EXCHANGE RHETORIC OVER REFERENDUM 
 
Classified By: AIT Deputy Director David J. Keegan, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Lien Chan and Chen Shui-bian sparred over the 
topic of referendums during a noisy campaign weekend.  Lien 
dared Chen to hold a referendum on \"independence or 
unification\" on the same day as the Legislative Yuan (LY) 
election.  Chen refused to take the bait, reiterating his 
2000 inaugural \"five no\'s\" pledge, but warned Beijing that if 
its bullying continued, Taiwan \"would not exclude\" holding a 
referendum on the topics of the \"one China policy\" or \"one 
country, two systems.\"  Despite the cross-Strait 
implications, this rhetoric does not represent a new policy 
direction for either side, and the whole exchange is already 
fading from the public\'s memory.  End Summary. 
 
Lien Challenges Chen to Hold Referendum 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, addressing a 
November 21 meeting of the KMT Central Standing Committee, 
accused President Chen Shui-bian of threatening the stability 
of the cross-Strait relationship by his recent actions. 
Chen, he added, was \"consistently deceiving\" the Taiwanese 
people with his talk of \"one country on each side of the 
Taiwan Strait, an independent Taiwan and the establishment of 
a nation.\"  Lien then dared Chen to hold a referendum on 
\"unification or independence\" on December 11, the day of the 
LY election, if he \"had the guts.\" 
 
Chen: Referendum Not Possible 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) At a rally in Taitung County to support local 
Pan-Green LY candidates, Chen responded to Lien\'s challenge 
with a rhetorical question: \"If you wanted us to hold a 
referendum on December 11, why did you not ask earlier?\"  He 
went on to remind his audience that the \"bird-cage\" 
Referendum Law passed last November restricted the issues 
that the public could vote on.  In its present form, there 
was no \"article in the Referendum Law that would allow us to 
hold the referendum suggested by Lien.\"  Chen then promised 
that if the Pan-Green camp wins a majority in the LY 
election, it will press for major revisions to the Referendum 
Law as soon as the new legislature is seated in February 
2005.  Of course Chen\'s audience all understood his subtext - 
that the restrictions in the Referendum Law had been 
introduced and passed by Lien\'s Pan-Blue Alliance over Chen\'s 
objections. 
 
Chen\'s Warning to Beijing 
------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Nevertheless, Chen declared that he would not \"fall 
into the trap\" set by Lien, because he had repeatedly said 
such a referendum is not necessary.  He added that everyone 
knew that he would stick to his 2000 \"five no\'s\" pledge, 
which included \"no referendum on independence or 
unification.\"  He noted, however, that \"China continues to 
pressure us to accept the \'one China principle\', \'one 
country, two systems,\' and the so-called \'1992 consensus.\'\" 
He warned Beijing \"that if you force us too much, we will not 
exclude putting these demands, which we cannot accept, to a 
referendum.\"  Executive Yuan Spokesman Chen Chi-mai announced 
the following day that Article 17 of the Referendum Law 
allows the President to call for such a \"defensive 
referendum\" in the face of an outside threat to change the 
nation\'s status quo or sovereignty.  (Note: This is the same 
provision Chen cited to justify the two referendums held in 
conjunction with the presidential balloting on March 20.  End 
Note.) 
 
Comment: Just a Flash in the Pan 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) This incident is only one example of the escalation of 
rhetoric on both sides in the run-up to the LY election in 
December.  Lien\'s call for a referendum, which surprised many 
in his own party, appeared to be little more than a 
ham-handed attempt to goad Chen into taking an extreme 
position that would alienate centrist voters.  Chen, at least 
for the moment, refused to take the bait, making Lien look 
like the more irresponsible candidate.  The entire exchange 
seems to be fading from the public memory, and has already 
been eclipsed in the media by the latest squabble: Chen\'s 
demand that the KMT change its emblem.

SUBJECT: LUKEWARM RESPONSE FOR TAIWAN FIXED NETWORK LICENSES 
 
REF: TAIPEI 2900 
 
1.  (U) According to the Directorate General of 
Telecommunications (DGT), applications for fixed network 
licenses closed October 28, 2004.  DGT received no 
applications for comprehensive network service and only one 
for the local and long-distance land cable leased-circuit 
business from a cable television provider.  Despite the 
industry\'s lukewarm response, DGT repeated its commitment to 
offer licenses on a biannual schedule in March and September 
and to lower capital requirements for local, long-distance 
and international business licenses.  The next open season 
for fixed network license applications will be in March 
2005. 
 
2.  (U) There may be more interest in licenses for local, 
long-distance and international services in March. 
According to a DGT plan, a new formula will be used to 
calculate the minimum paid-in capital for the local call 
business.  For example, the minimum paid-in capital 
requirement for a local call license for Taipei city would, 
based on the population of the city, be just 1.2 billion NT 
dollars (USD 36.3 million).  Currently, companies interested 
in entering the Taiwan market must have paid-in capital of 
16 billion NT dollars (USD 484.8 million) and must serve the 
entire island.  For long-distance and international 
services, the minimum paid-in capital would be lowered to a 
flat standard of 2 billion NT dollars (USD 60.6 million). 
 
3.  (U) Comment: Liberalization of fixed network licensing 
requirements was a condition of Taiwan\'s WTO accession. 
Industry has criticized the biannual application process and 
Taiwan\'s lower, but still restrictive paid-in capital 
requirements.  The failure of this September\'s open season 
to generate any bids may in part be a reflection of an 
industry waiting for lower requirements.  But more likely, 
Taiwan\'s relatively small fixed network service market is 
not considered attractive to investors facing an 
overwhelmingly dominant state-owned competitor in Chunghwa 
Telecom (CHT).  The long awaited privatization of CHT, now 
predicted for early 2005, may alter the equation 
sufficiently to encourage more competition in the fixed 
network market in 2005.  End Comment.

talks to Ministry of Economic Affairs Vice Minister Chen on 
November 24.  Chen was aware of the content of the demarche 
and understood the need to avoid characterizing the talks as 
discussions on an FTA.  Chen recognized the U.S. desire for 
deliverables during the talks and noted that Taiwan would 
like to be shifted from the Priority Watch List to the Watch 
List under Special 301.  MOEA issued a press release 
announcing the talks late on November 23 and made no mention 
of FTA in its release.  One news article included FTA in its 
reporting on the release while the rest of the newspapers 
echoed the contents of the release.  End summary, 
 
2.  (SBU) AIT/T Econ Chief delivered reftel demarche to 
Ministry of Economic Affairs Vice Minister Steve Chen 
November 24.  Based on previous discussions with AIT/T and 
reports from TECRO Washington, Chen was fully aware of the 
upcoming TIFA talks and was anticipating making an 
announcement during the week of November 22-26.  Given USTR\'s 
decision not to issue an announcement before the November 
29-30 meeting, Chen volunteered that he would hold off as 
long as possible before making any announcement in Taipei. 
 
3.  Chen said that he understood U.S. concerns that the 
meeting not be characterized as an FTA meeting.  He said that 
he would tell all of his colleagues not to make any mention 
of FTA in conjunction with the TIFA talks.  Regarding the 
need for Taiwan to come prepared with deliverables, Chen said 
that he understood U.S. concerns on resolving outstanding 
issues and also noted that Taiwan would like to gain some 
deliverables.  In particular, he cited a desire for Taiwan to 
move from the Priority Watch List under Special 301 to the 
Watch List. 
 
4.  (SBU) Due to concerns that the news would leak out 
shortly, late in the day on Wednesday, November 24, MOEA 
issued a press release announcing that trade talks were 
resuming under the 1994 Trade and Investment Framework 
Agreement and would be held in Washington November 29-30. 
The statement made no mention of FTA.  Chinese and English 
language newspapers carried the press release on November 25. 
 All but one of the reporting articles did so with no mention 
of FTA.  One newspaper, the Chinese language Liberty Times 
referred to TIFA as an important stepping stone to FTA talks. 
 We believe that the FTA reference was made by the newspaper 
and not by Taiwan officials.

Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Spurred by Chen Shui-bian\'s 30,000-margin 
victory in Taichung County during the 2004 presidential 
election, the DPP expects to elect five of its six LY 
nominees there this December, up from the four seats it won 
in 2001.  The KMT nominated its four incumbents and one 
newcomer, with four likely to win seats.  PFP\'s sole nominee, 
incumbent Feng Ting-kuo, is expected to win reelection by 
capturing virtually all of the county\'s Mainlander vote. 
Colorful independent incumbent Yen Ching-piao is another 
iron-clad winner.  Whether or not the DPP can duplicate the 
success it achieved in the presidential election will depend 
on the effectiveness of its vote allocation system versus the 
ability of KMT grassroot organizations to remain a force in 
voter mobilization.  End Summary. 
 
Weathervane of Taiwan Politics 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Eleven legislators represent Taichung County\'s 
population of 1.5 million in the Legislative Yuan (LY). 
During the 2004 presidential election, Chen Shui-bian 
targeted this historically Pan-Blue stronghold as a 
battleground, and by cultivating the faction leaders so 
important in Taichung politics, made significant inroads in 
the county.  Hung Chao-nan, eighth term KMT Legislator from 
Taichung City, told AIT that Chen constantly visited the 
county during the presidential campaign.  For his efforts, 
Chen won in Taichung by a margin of 30,000 plus votes, and 
the DPP now hopes to translate that victory into LY seats. 
Commenting on the significance of this locality, PFP 
Legislator and Spokesman Daniel Hwang (Yih-jiau) told AIT 
that Taichung County is a litmus test for \"where the wind is 
blowing\" in Taiwan party politics. 
 
3. (C) Although 22 candidates have registered to contest the 
11 seats, Taichung party officials across the political 
spectrum agreed that only 13 candidates are serious 
contenders.  Chiu Tai-san, a veteran of Taichung local 
politics before being appointed Mainland Affairs Council 
(MAC) Senior Vice Chairman, assessed that only six incumbents 
are assured of victory -- two DPP, two KMT, PFP Feng 
Ting-kuo, and independent Yen Ching-piao.  Three DPP 
nominees, three KMT nominees, and independent Yang Tien-sheng 
will battle for the remaining five seats. 
 
DPP: Two incumbents, four newcomers 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) In 2001 four of the five candidates nominated by the 
DPP won LY seats.  The two DPP incumbents running for 
reelection -- Kuo Chun-ming and Chien Chao-tung -- are 
assured of victory this December.  Although the other 
incumbents are not running (Chiu Tai-san left the LY for MAC 
in May 2004, and Lin Feng-hsi plans to run for Taichung 
County magistrate in 2005), each has anointed a stand-in -- 
Tsai Chi-chan was Chiu Tai-san\'s chief of staff while Wu 
 
SIPDIS 
Fu-gui is Lin Feng-hsi\'s protege. 
 
5. (C) DPP Taichung County Chairman Sheng Kuo-jung is 
confident the DPP will not only retain its current four seats 
but also gain a fifth seat.  Despite Chiu Tai-san\'s concern 
that Tsai is too much of a policy wonk and has not been able 
to connect with the voters, Sheng told AIT that Tsai is the 
strongest of all the DPP newcomers.  Sheng then turned to 
what he called Wu Fu-gui\'s many strengths -- he is a former 
National Assembly member, his brother is an incumbent county 
councilor, and Lin Feng-hsi\'s base is particularly strong and 
loyal.  Sheng told AIT that a third candidate, Hsieh 
Hsin-nee, will win the break-through fifth seat for the DPP. 
He pointed out that although Hsieh is an outsider from Tainan 
she previously served as DPP Director of Social Development 
and is receiving strong endorsement and support from central 
headquarters. 
 
6. (C) Of the DPP nominees, Liu Jui-lung is the one on the 
cusp.  Sheng believes it is possible for the DPP to gain one 
but not two more seat than it did in 2001.  Sheng said that 
new DPP voters who came over from the KMT during the 
presidential election are likely to return to their old 
voting habits in an LY election.  Another problem, Sheng 
explained to AIT, is the candidate himself.  He said Liu is 
known primarily in the coastal towns, and has not 
sufficiently widened his appeal in the plain and mountain 
areas.  Sheng also remarked that Liu is a poor campaigner. 
He said that so far the party has not made any decisions 
about Liu\'s campaign, or any decisions about voting 
allocation (pei-piao).  When asked whether he thought the DPP 
over-nominated in Taichung County, Sheng told AIT that 
President Chen wanted to win a LY majority and urged the 
party to nominate aggressively in most counties. 
 
KMT: Holding steady 
------------------- 
 
7. (C) The KMT nominated five candidates to run in this 
year\'s election.  Four are incumbents.  Four-term superstar 
legislator Shyu Jong-shyong is by far the most popular 
legislator in Taichung if not in all of Taiwan.  Shyu boosted 
to AIT that he does not need to campaign to win.  The second 
most popular KMT incumbent, Yang Chiung-ying, is virtually 
unknown outside of Taichung.  However, informed observers 
consistently rank her as one of the top three performers in 
the county.  The same observers told AIT that incumbents Liu 
Chuan-chung and Chi Kuo-tung are likely to win reelection as 
well but their victories are not as secure. 
 
8. (C) Although the KMT believes it has enough supporters to 
win five seats, the tangled legacy of the 2001 election may 
render that harder than it might first appear.  In 2001, the 
KMT nominated six and won five seats.  The winner of the 
fifth KMT seat in 2001 was Yang Wen-hsin.  The KMT later 
revoked Yang\'s membership for repeatedly refusing to vote on 
legislation along party lines.  To complicate things further, 
Yang Wen-hsin\'s father, Yang Tien-sheng, is running in his 
place this year.  The family business, Everfortune (Chang-Yi) 
is reportedly in financial difficulty and Chiu Tai-san told 
AIT that the family sees winning a LY seat as vital to saving 
its future. 
 
9. (C) To vie for votes that went to Yang in 2001, the KMT 
has nominated Chiang Lien-fu, the mayor of Taiping township. 
KMT County Chairman Lai Hsin-hsiung told AIT he is optimistic 
all five nominees will prevail and outlined a strategy based 
on geographical allocation of votes.  Former DPP County 
Magistrate Liao Yang-lai agreed that the KMT has a chance to 
win five seats.  PFP Taichung County Chief Lin Yao-hsin 
thought four KMT seats were more likely.  DPP\'s Sheng told 
AIT that Chiang is known in the mountain areas but has had 
difficulty cultivating voters in the coastal and plain towns. 
 Sheng also pointed out that Chiang was Yang Tien-sheng\'s 
protege so their supporter base will overlap. 
 
KMT\'s Bad Reputation 
-------------------- 
 
10. (C) KMT has long relied on grassroot networks to mobilize 
supporters for rallies and other election activities. 
However, the post-March 20 street demonstrations in Taipei 
have taken a toll on the KMT LY election effort.  DPP\'s Sheng 
said that the KMT grassroot organizations have not been very 
active this year because they are all exhausted from the 
March mobilization.  In addition, those scenes of protesters 
attacking police and other public servants have alienated the 
conservative people from the Taichung countrysides.  KMT\'s 
Shyu Jong-Shyong offered a similar assessment, telling AIT 
that he is the only KMT candidate who dares to identify 
himself as KMT member. 
 
PFP: One Candidate for Mainlanders 
---------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Banking on the 150,000 ethnic Mainlanders eligible to 
vote in Taichung County, the PFP in 2001 nominated four 
candidates (three men and a woman), expecting to elect at 
least three of them.  Of the four candidates, three were 
ethnic Taiwanese while one was Mainlander.  Only Feng 
Ting-kuo -- the Mainlander nominee -- was elected in 2001. 
This year as the sole PFP nominee, he is universally expected 
to win reelection.  DPP\'s Sheng told AIT that Feng has a 
terrible reputation in Taichung but with access to almost the 
entire Mainlander vote, he is assured of victory. 
 
TSU: Nomination folly 
 
SIPDIS 
--------------------- 
 
12. (C) Wang Dai Chun-man, the sole TSU nominee in 2001, 
failed to win election by a mere 460 votes.  She might have 
had a good chance to win this year if the TSU had not 
nominated two candidates.  Everyone AIT interviewed agreed 
that TSU does not have enough supporters in Taichung to elect 
two candidates, and that by nominating two candidates, the 
party has jeopardized both of their chances to win.  During 
his discussion with AIT, Wang\'s campaign director cursed TSU 
Chairman Huang Chu-wen, calling him a brainless rotten egg 
(wan ba dan) for insisting on nominating two TSU candidates. 
A tireless campaigner, Wang told AIT that she canvasses for 
votes in traditional markets at 6:00 every morning and at 
night markets until late every evening.  Nevertheless, she 
confessed that her chances are slim. 
 
The Yen Ching-piao Lock 
----------------------- 
 
13. (C) Taichung County is represented in the legislature by 
one of the most famous gangsters in Taiwan.  Rumored to have 
been involved in racketeering and other organized crimes, Yen 
Ching-piao is equally well known as the patron and chairman 
of Chenlan Temple, a powerful Matsu temple.  He has served in 
the Taichung County Council and Taiwan Provincial Council. 
During his term as Taichung County Council Speaker, Yen was 
indicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for murder and 
corruption.  While still in jail, Yen decided to run for 
legislator as an independent -- sending his wife and son to 
campaign on his behalf.  He won in December 2001 and was 
sworn in as a LY member in early 2002.  No one in Taiwan has 
any doubt that Yen will prevail in his reelection effort. 
KMT County Chairman Lai told AIT that Yen does not have to 
get out of bed and he will win. 
 
Hitman with a heart 
------------------- 
 
14. (C) While no one can satisfactorily explain how a known 
gangster can win election in a county known for its 
conservative traditional values, DPP\'s Sheng offered the 
argument that most people do not feel personally threatened 
by Yen.  Former DPP County Magistrate Liao Yang-lai explained 
that Yen has an image of being very diligent, offering 
excellent service to his community, and being filial to his 
parents. 
 
15. (C) The more interesting question is whether Yen will 
vote with the Greens or Blues in the next LY session.  In the 
past, because of his affiliation with James Soong through the 
provincial council, Yen sided with the Blues.  Yen told AIT 
that he has never voted with the Pan-Green but the DPP 
government sometimes used his \"legal problems\" to pressure 
him to stay home.  DPP\'s Sheng is confident that in the next 
session, most independent legislators will vote with the 
Pan-Green.  Sheng said that Yen voted with the Pan-Blue in 
the past because he owed James Soong but pointed out that Yen 
has repaid his debt.  MAC\'s Chiu made a similar point, \"He 
does not care about national issues, so if we need his vote 
on a major bill, we will just build a road for him.\"  A 
survey of the large number of new roads in Yen\'s hometown 
suggests that Yen has cooperated with the DPP more than once. 
 
Comment: Change of political guards? 
------------------------------------ 
 
16. (C) With PFP Feng Ting-kuo and independent Yen Ching-paio 
definitely winning a seat each, the remaining nine seats will 
be split five-four between the DPP and the KMT.  Most 
political observers agreed that the DPP over-nominated this 
year.  Even DPP County Chairman Sheng admitted that DPP\'s Liu 
Jui-lung\'s campaign was \"in danger.\"  The KMT\'s chances for 
electing five candidates may hinge on the KMT\'s ability to 
counter the campaign of independent Yang Tien-sheng because 
their voter base overlaps.  This LY election will also test 
the continued effectiveness of KMT grassroot organizations to 
mobilize voters and the KMT\'s relation with local factions 
(Septel will explore the impact of local factions and voting 
buying in Taiwan LY elections, looking particularly at 
Taichung County).

1. (C) Summary: Taiwan\'s top polling centers are predicting a 
close election race between the Pan-Green and Pan-Blue camps 
for control of the Legislative Yuan (LY), with neither side 
currently expected to gain a majority.  While pollsters agree 
that a majority for either side is unlikely, their estimates 
span a wide spectrum.  The polling estimates range from a 
three seat margin of victory for the Pan-Green over the 
Pan-Blue, with the Pan-Green four seats shy of a controlling 
majority, to a two seat victory for the Pan-Blue.  The 
pollsters consulted by AIT cautioned that, although they 
employ rigorous polling methodologies, their polls cannot 
fully capture Taiwan\'s complex political landscape.  End 
Summary. 
 
Taiwan\'s Top Polling Centers: The Estimates 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The directors of some of Taiwan\'s top polling centers 
say their polling data point to a close LY race with only a 
slim margin of victory for either the Pan-Green or Pan-Blue 
camp.  Almost all media and party surveys predict that 
neither side appears likely to gain a majority.  In the 2001 
legislative election the Pan-Blue camp, made up of the 
Kuomintang (KMT), the People First Party (PFP), and the New 
Party (NP), gained a majority with 115 out of 225 LY seats, 
compared to 101 seats for the Pan-Green alliance, composed of 
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU).  Of those 225 seats, 168 are elected 
from local election districts, 8 from aborigine districts, 8 
from overseas Chinese constituencies, and 41 are at-large 
candidates (Reftel). 
 
3. (C) DPP Survey Center Director Pan Yi-shuan told AIT that 
internal party polls showed the Pan-Green leading the 
Pan-Blue 109 to 106 seats -- an eight seat gain for the 
Pan-Green and a nine seat reduction for the Pan-Blue.  Pan 
said the largest gains in the Pan-Green camp would come from 
the DPP, whose overall seats she projected would rise to 94 
from the 87.  She said the TSU is expected to make marginal 
gains, increasing its seats from 13 to 15. On the Pan-Blue 
side, Pan predicted the KMT would consolidate its position 
and pick up seats at the expense of the PFP.  Pan warned, 
however, that the DPP needs to be concerned that overly 
optimistic predictions that the Pan-Green will gain a 
majority could weaken Pan-Green-leaning voter turnout and 
spur apathetic Blues to flock to the polls to defend their 
endangered legislators. 
 
4. (C) Era Survey Research Center Director Tai Li-an 
estimates a more modest Pan-Green showing based on his polls, 
projecting a four seat gain to 105 seats versus a twelve seat 
loss to 103 for the Pan-Blue.  Tai believes the remaining 17 
seats will go to independents, many of whom lean Pan-Blue but 
could, he said, easily be swayed by selective government 
largesse to support Pan-Green initiatives.  According to Tai, 
his polls show that the weakness within the Pan-Blue camp is 
coming from PFP candidates, especially those in the southern 
and central districts of the island.  Tai remarked that PFP 
candidates are being dragged down by the declining reputation 
of their Chairman James Song and the \"ethnic-Mainlander\" 
brand of their party in heavy ethnic Taiwanese areas. 
 
5. (C) TVBS Polling Center Director Wang Yeh-ting is the only 
one to say the Pan-Blue are in the lead (Note: TVBS 
consistently showed the Pan-Blue ahead by large margins 
during the presidential campaign, with its March 20 exit poll 
projecting a 6 percentage point win by the Lien-Soong 
ticket).  According to Wang, the Pan-Blue will win 105 seats 
versus 103 for the Pan-Green.  Like Pan and Tai, Wang says 
his data show the DPP will make the biggest gains and take 91 
seats while the TSU will gain only 12--far below the 20-plus 
seats the TSU claims they hope to gain.  Wang also says the 
distribution of seats within the Pan-Blue alliance will shift 
heavily in favor of the KMT, which will take 71 seats, to the 
detriment of the PFP, which is projected to get 33 seats--a 
loss of 13 seats from its 2001 showing.  Wang\'s estimates, 
like Tai\'s, project 17 seats for independents with members of 
the Non-Party Solidarity Union (NSU) picking up 10 seats. 
Wang said six of the of the remaining seven independents lean 
Pan-Blue, which could help the Pan-Blue retain control over 
the LY. 
 
How They Do It: A Look at Polling Methods 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) All three polling center directors described their 
polling operations, which are generally similar in size and 
methods.  Each of the three centers employ 50 part-time 
callers and poll randomly selected households during the 
evenings between Monday and Friday.  Their polling samples 
are average 1,000 people -- the three directors agreed that 
samples of 400 to 800 people, used by most other polling 
centers on Taiwan, are too small and create large sampling 
errors.  The centers began LY district-by-district polls in 
early October and completed their first roundabout of the 
island in mid November.  Pan said the DPP\'s efforts will 
continue, focusing on the more hotly contested districts. 
TVBS\'s Wang said his center will re-poll contested areas, 
focusing on places such as Taipei city and county and 
Kaohsiung city that have candidates with \"star power.\"  The 
three centers\' polls have relatively high response rates, 
close to 80 percent for the DPP\'s Survey Center and around 70 
percent for ERA and TVBS.  Pan and Wang attributed the high 
numbers to the use of \"warm-up\" questions and \"bi-lingual\" 
callers who can conduct their interviews in Mandarin Chinese 
and Fujianese (minnanhua) or Hakka dialects, depending on the 
respondent\'s language preference. 
 
7. (C) The three centers, however, have taken different 
approaches to compiling their district polls into an overall 
estimate of the LY outcome, which perhaps accounts for a 
large measure of their variation.  Pan said the DPP Survey 
Center took its polling numbers as a basis, but also factored 
in the results of projected \"vote distribution\" (peipiao) 
into its calculations.  Wang and Tai said their estimates are 
more conservative, tallying up polling numbers without 
heavily factoring vote distribution, which all parties are 
likely to attempt.  Wang admitted that TVBS had yet to 
conduct polls in Penghu, Hualien, Taitung, Kinmen, and Matsu 
and was basing its projections in those areas, as well as for 
the aborigine and overseas Chinese constituencies, on \"past 
experience.\" 
 
What They Can\'t Do: The Limits of Polling 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8. (C) The polling directors acknowledged that the LY 
election outcome -- even more so than the 2004 presidential 
contest -- is difficult to predict because of political 
factors and local variables that their polls cannot fully 
capture.  Tai said that voter turnout and vote distribution, 
in particular, are likely to play a determining role. 
Attempts by both camps in the final week of the election to 
distribute votes from strong to weak candidates also add to 
the unpredictability of the race.  The distribution of votes 
is determined by last-minute maneuvering and party 
calculations that are difficult to gauge in advance through 
public opinion surveys, said Tai.  The 20 to 30 percent 
non-response rate of those polled further compromises the 
accuracy of election projections. 
 
9. (C) Pan and Wang warned that some polling conducted on 
Taiwan is plagued by other \"soft\" factors.  In particular, 
Pan said that local politicians may manipulate polls, even 
commission their own data, for various propaganda purposes, 
such as showing they are a viable contender in their 
district.  Smaller polling centers and companies are known to 
skew their sampling to deliver results desirable to their 
paymaster, according to Wang.  Emile Sheng, an academic 
polling expert who has consulted with both TVBS and ERA, told 
AIT that he was recently threatened with a lawsuit by PFP 
incumbent Pang Chien-kuo.  Sheng said that Pang has alleged 
that Sheng has intentionally skewed polls to show Pang out of 
contention for re-election.  Sheng noted, however, that all 
media polls put Pang in exactly the same position (number 14 
in the competition for a ten-seat district) in the hotly 
contested Taipei City South district. 
 
10. (C) Wang further pointed out that his center\'s polls, 
like all household-based polling on Taiwan, are more likely 
to miss young, unmarried professionals, who rely exclusively 
on cellphones.  Wang said that, on the opposite side of the 
spectrum, some polling companies rely heavily on cellphone 
interviews, which skews samples against people over 60 years 
of age who, in the south, tend to be strong DPP supporters. 
Another group that tends to shy away from participating in 
polls, especially those perceived as \"pro-Blue,\" are 
Pan-Green loyalists.  Many observers attributed the 
inaccuracy of TVBS presidential campaign polling, especially 
their March 20 exit poll, to this factor. 
 
Comment: A Clouded Crystal Ball 
------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) AIT\'s discussion with these polling directors 
suggests that Taiwan polls are at best imperfect soothsayers 
of the LY election outcome.  Election projections, 
nevertheless, appear consistent in pointing to a 
consolidation and expansion of the two major parties, the DPP 
and the KMT, that will come largely at the expense of their 
partners, the TSU and the PFP respectively.  The expectations 
of an overall weaker Pan-Blue position track with what AIT is 
seeing in various districts around the island and point to a 
new post-election landscape for Taiwan.  While the exact 
numbers may be impossible to predict, it appears increasingly 
likely that the Pan-Blue will lose it\'s LY majority and 
present the Pan-Green, if it makes significant gains, with an 
opening to woo independents and form a working majority.

1. (C) Summary: The campaign for the December 11 Legislative 
Yuan (LY) election is entering its final phase with neither 
camp assured a majority of seats.  On balance, campaign 
officials and observers project that the Pan-Green will win a 
plurality, leaving it within reach of a majority with the 
help of non-partisans.  President Chen Shui-bian has 
dominated the campaign agenda, and his Democratic Progressive 
Party (DPP) is running a tightly coordinated campaign.  In 
contrast, Pan-Blue candidates are running individualized 
campaigns, with many downplaying their partisan affiliations. 
 The Kuomintang (KMT), which took a cautious nomination 
approach, will likely roughly retain its current seats, but 
its junior partner, the People First Party (PFP), is set to 
lose between 16-21 of its current 46 seats.  Both sides have 
employed sharply negative themes in order to mobilize core 
supporters, but DPP officials say they will attempt a more 
positive appeal in the final weeks of the campaign in order 
to win over centrist voters.  End Summary. 
 
Some Preliminary Predictions 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) It is still too early to make solid predictions about 
the results of Taiwan\'s Legislative Yuan (LY) election 
scheduled for December 11.  All major polls indicate that 
neither side has more than 50 percent of the electorate\'s 
vote, and differences in support rates for most candidates in 
each electoral district are well within the margin of error. 
Furthermore, polls in Taiwan are notoriously unreliable (Ref 
A) so predicting election outcomes is more art than science. 
Analysts are undaunted, however, and by far the most common 
assessment is that the Pan-Green will win several more seats 
than the Pan-Blue, but neither side will come away with an 
outright majority, so the balance will be held by 
independents.  The second most likely outcome, according to 
the majority of observers, is that the Pan-Green will win a 
very slim majority.  With the exception of the Pan-Blue 
public relations team, however, no commentators or political 
operators AIT has met predict the Pan-Blue will be able to 
hold onto its majority. 
 
3. (C) Turnout for the LY election is expected to be 
significantly lower than the 80 percent seen in the March 
presidential election, some say due to \"election fatigue\". 
Most observers expect turnout to be in the mid-60 percent 
range at best, a figure consistent with historical rates for 
LY elections (66 percent of eligible voters voted in the 
2001, for example).  Academia Sinica election researcher Hsu 
Yung-ming noted that this would mean 2.5 million voters who 
came out to the polls in March will stay home this December. 
With a margin of victory for the multiple seats in many 
districts of fewer than 1000 votes each, he said, all parties 
are therefore scrambling to mobilize their core supporters. 
However, Steve Hsieh (Hsiang-chuan) of the National Policy 
Foundation, a KMT think-tank, suggested that the Pan-Blue was 
at a decided disadvantage this election because as many as 1 
million embittered Pan-Blue supporters might have emigrated 
to Shanghai, among other places, after Chen Shui-bian\'s 
victory in the March presidential elections.  Taipei 
University professor Chiang Min-chin cited the same estimate 
from a weekly news magazine, and added that unlike Pan-Blue 
voters, who often have connections in the US, Canada and 
Mainland China, Pan-Green voters generally have no place to 
go, so their strength in Taiwan is only growing.  (Comment: 
Pan-Blue officials frequently make this claim, but AIT has 
not seen any concrete, or even anecdotal, evidence to support 
it.  End Comment.) 
 
Creating a Sense of \"Crisis\" 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Both sides seem to have decided that the best way of 
spurring apathetic voters into action is by manufacturing a 
sense of \"crisis\" for their constituents, primarily by 
ratcheting up the rhetoric and mounting vicious and negative 
attacks on their opponents.  The danger that such tactics 
would alienate moderate voters may be partly mitigated by the 
fact that such voters are among those least likely to turn 
out in December.  Both camps, for example, have suggested 
that a victory for the other side would spell an end to 
Taiwanese democracy.  The Pan-Blue claims that its control of 
the LY is the only thing standing in the way of a Chen 
Shui-bian dictatorship and accuse him of wielding 
undemocratic control over the press and the judiciary.  The 
PFP\'s James Soong suggested that \"a Pan-Green majority will 
mean war with China.\"  KMT Chairman Lien Chan has repeatedly 
demanded that the DPP organize a referendum on independence 
to coincide with the December 11 election.  KMT Culture and 
Publicity Department Deputy Director Chen Yu-mei told AIT 
that Lien\'s statements were meant to force the president to 
take an extreme position that would alienate centrist voters. 
 However, she bemoaned that the president easily side-stepped 
the attack and within 24 hours was back in control of the 
campaign agenda.  The Pan-Blue\'s campaign agenda does not 
appear to be filtering down to the grass-roots level, where 
many candidates, especially those from outside Taipei, are 
actively downplaying their partisan affiliations. 
 
CSB v. KMT 
---------- 
 
5. (C) While Chen has tacked to the pro-independence extreme 
on several occasions during the campaign, these have been 
mostly in response to statements by former President Lee 
Teng-hui rather than Lien Chan.  The president\'s main focus, 
however, has been assailing the KMT for its party assets, its 
use of the national emblem for its party seal, and 
allegations that the Pan-Blue appealed to KMT loyalists in 
the Taiwan military to attempt a \"soft coup\" after the March 
20 presidential election.  National Security Council (NSC) 
Secretary General (and veteran campaign strategist) Chiou 
 
SIPDIS 
I-jen told AIT that these attacks are part of a calculated 
effort to blame the island\'s woes on the KMT\'s inability to 
disentangle itself from government.  Chiou said the DPP is 
satisfied that the negative campaign push has succeeded in 
energizing the DPP base.  Chiou said that in the final two 
weeks of the election, President Chen will shift to a more 
positive, substantive approach tailored to win over centrist 
voters.  Political commentator Yang Hsien-hong assessed that 
Chen\'s move to the center would open up space for the Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU), which has been largely marginalized 
in the campaign by Chen\'s domination of the Pan-Green air 
waves. 
 
Peipiao Will be Key 
------------------- 
 
6. (C) More than any of these issues however, the single 
biggest variable that will determine the outcome of the 
election in December will be intra-party vote distribution, 
or \"peipiao.\"  In Taiwan\'s multi-member district system, 
proper distribution of votes among candidates is often more 
important than the gross number of votes received (Ref B). 
The Pan-Green has a huge advantage in this area because the 
DPP enjoys greater party cohesion than the other parties and 
its candidates are more willing to cooperate with forced 
peipiao schemes.  Adept use of peipiao allowed the DPP to 
take six percent more seats than its vote share would seem to 
have justified in the last election, according to ERA Polling 
Center Director Tai Li-an, and the party is focusing its 
efforts on repeating that success.  Candidates in most 
districts run as a team and plans have already been made to 
ask voters to divide their votes based on the month of their 
birth or the last digit of their national ID card number. 
DPP voters, who tend to be more ideologically loyal to the 
party than to any particular candidate, can be expected 
reliably to follow the party\'s peipiao instructions. 
 
Can the Pan-Blue Peipiao Successfully? 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Soochow University political science professor and 
political talk show host Emile Sheng (Chi-jen) asserted that 
successful DPP peipiao is a given, and that \"the only 
variable is Pan-Blue peipiao.\"  The outlook for the Pan-Blue 
in this regard is not good.  KMT and PFP politics are 
dominated by personalities and their LY campaigns are far 
more candidate-based than party-based.  KMT Culture and 
Publicity Deputy Chief Chen told AIT that prospects for vote 
coordination within the KMT are close to zero and the 
likelihood of establishing peipiao schemes with other 
Pan-Blue parties is even lower.  Successful peipiao would be 
difficult under the best of circumstances, but Pan-Blue 
candidates are even less likely to show generosity in this 
election.  Academia Sinica\'s Hsu suggested that this is 
because Pan-Blue candidates see this election as a \"primary\" 
for the 2008 LY election.  Since the number of LY seats will 
be halved in 2008 under a constitutional amendment expected 
to be ratified in the spring (Ref C), it is widely believed 
that only incumbents from this election will be considered 
for nomination in the next one, and those with the highest 
vote totals in 2004 will stand the best chance.  An 
additional difficulty for the Pan-Blue is that, in 
opposition, it has few appointments to offer its most 
well-known national figures other than LY nominations.  These 
\"superstar candidates\" are likely to take an unnecessarily 
large share of the vote in their respective districts, and 
are generally unwilling to cooperate with peipiao schemes, as 
these have famously backfired in the past, resulting at least 
twice in 2001 in the most popular candidate losing after his 
votes were \"shared\" away to weaker candidates. 
 
Pan-Green Overnomination in the North? 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) However, even the most perfectly implemented peipiao 
scheme is doomed to failure if the party has run too many 
candidates.  The Pan-Green may be in greater danger in this 
regard.  Encouraged by Chen\'s victory in the March 
presidential election, the DPP nominated aggressively in 
areas where Chen made major gains during the 2004 election. 
In many southern districts where it already enjoys high 
support levels, the DPP\'s nominees will likely find the 
necessary votes.  In northern districts, however, which have 
historically favored the Pan-Blue, the Pan-Green\'s nomination 
strategy ranges from merely aggressive to downright reckless. 
 The DPP is not entirely at fault here, however.  The TSU, 
encouraged by media speculation that it could double its 
seats by riding the wave of growing Taiwanese identity, 
hastily decided to increase its nominations in almost every 
district.  Most of these last-minute additions stand little 
chance of winning election, and will possibly drain enough 
votes from their TSU and DPP allies to give up a seat to the 
Pan-Blue.  The NSC\'s Chiou acknowledged this danger and said 
the DPP would make a call by December 1 about culling weak 
candidates from several northern districts.  Chiou noted that 
if the DPP dropped a candidate each from Taoyuan County, 
Taipei City North, and Taipei County\'s Second District it 
could guarantee a pick up of three seats over 2001 by 
securing the rest of its candidate list in these areas. 
 
Pan-Blue Problems with Mavericks 
-------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The Pan-Blue is not entirely free of overnomination 
worries, however.  Lack of discipline among candidates has 
undermined the KMT\'s generally conservative nomination 
strategy in some districts, as the candidates who did not 
receive nominations decided to run anyway on their own.  Such 
\"maverick\" candidates could potentially split the KMT vote in 
some decisive districts, giving up seats to the Pan-Green and 
reducing the KMT party\'s share of votes for the at-large 
proportional representation seats.  Soochow University\'s 
Sheng noted that the political balance in Taipei City splits 
65-35 in favor of the Blue, yet campaign officials on both 
sides predict that the Pan-Green will win half of the 20 
seats in the capital due to poor Pan-Blue nominations and 
coordination (Septel). 
 
The Decline and Fall of the PFP 
------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) A greater concern for the Pan-Blue is the widespread 
perception that the PFP is on the verge of collapse as a 
result of the Pan-Blue\'s clumsy mismanagement of the proposed 
KMT-PFP merger and the PFP\'s increasingly extremist line on 
many policy issues.  Most of the PFP\'s stronger incumbents, 
especially in northern districts, are unlikely to be hurt by 
this, but PFP newcomers and less well-known incumbents are in 
increasing danger.  This has given rise to PFP calls for the 
KMT to include PFP candidates in its peipiao efforts, but 
with the exception of Nantou County (Ref D), these pleas have 
been ignored.  Hsu Yung-ming offered a typical assessment of 
the Pan-Blue situation, saying that \"the KMT will keep its 
seats because it nominated conservatively, but the PFP will 
suffer, going from 46 seats now to probably less than 30 
after the election.\"  PFP Acting Secretary General Chin 
Ching-Sheng separately offered an estimate of 25-30 seats for 
his party.  LY President (and KMT Vice Chairman) Wang 
Jin-pyng was even more downbeat on the PFP, \"they can count 
on 25 seats, but definitely no more than 28.\" 
 
Comment: First Step Towards a Two Party System? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
10. (C) Although it is too early to predict the final outcome 
of the LY election, some general shifts seem likely.  The 
Pan-Blue will almost certainly lose its control of the LY, 
with its losses coming almost exclusively from the ranks of 
the PFP.  The DPP stands to gain seats, but with TSU support 
remaining stagnant, an outright Pan-Green majority may be 
beyond its grasp.  DPP officials are confident that if they 
are within 3-5 seats of a majority, they can assemble a 
working coalition with like-minded (or buyable) independents. 
 Strong showings by the DPP and KMT vis-a-vis their junior 
coalition partners could reduce TSU and PFP ability within 
the LY to push extremist agendas.  However, much will hinge 
on what happens to the Pan-Blue after December 11.  Opinion 
among Pan-Blue leaders over the opposition\'s post-election 
role is divided.  Some officials, like Wang, have warned that 
the DPP will be allowed to dictate policy, with an unengaged 
and marginalized KMT sitting on the sidelines.  KMT Taipei 
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou have emphasized the need for the KMT to 
play an active, responsible, balancing role in order to 
remain competitive for elections in 2006 and later.  What 
sort of KMT emerges after December 11 could matter more than 
who wins on election day.

billion special budget for the procurement of advanced weapon

Pan-Blue.  Wang emphasized, however, that if the Pan-Blue 
were to retain control of the LY speakership, he would be 
able to find a formula to bring the KMT around to support a 
budget, although at some reduced funding level.  This, he 
claimed, would avoid exacerbating the political divisions 
that currently exist within Taiwan.  End Summary. 
 
Special Budget Post December 11 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C)  Legislative Yuan (LY) President Wang Jin-pyng told 
the AIT Director November 24 that if the Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) controlled the LY speakership, the 
USD 18 billion special budget for the procurement of advanced 
weapon systems would pass but only over vigorous objections 
by the Pan-Blue and its supporters.  Wang said that recent 
polls show that there are more people who oppose the special 
budget than there are people who support it.  He reiterated 
that if the Pan-Blue were deprived of the LY speaker 
position, the opposition would have no reason to support any 
DPP policy initiative.  Wang added that if the special budget 
were pushed through on a party line vote, it could lead to 
renewed street demonstrations like those after March 20. 
Wang said he worried that, in this case, anti-special budget 
protests might deteriorate into expressions of 
anti-Americanism. 
 
3. (C) Wang emphasized, however, that if the Pan-Blue were to 
retain control of the LY speakership, he would be able to 
find a formula to bring the KMT around to support a budget, 
at some reduced funding level, that would avoid exacerbating 
the political divisions that currently exist within Taiwan. 
Wang said that the optics of the LY being able to secure a 
reduction on the cost of the weapon systems is vital to 
winning support from the Taiwan public.  He remarked that 
people go to the traditional markets and haggle over one or 
two NT dollars, thus they expect the government to fight over 
items that cost billions. 
 
4. (C) Wang asked the Director if the USG still sought LY 
passage of the special budget.  The Director responded that 
if the budget did not pass, it would send a clear signal to 
policymakers in Washington that Taiwan is not serious about 
its own self-defense and lead to questions over why the U.S. 
should be prepared to fight for Taiwan when Taipei has shown 
no commitment to defend itself. 
 
DPP\'s Anti-Wang Strategy 
------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Wang told AIT Director that Chen Shui-bian and the DPP 
are now intensifying their attacks on Wang because the DPP 
believes that it will face a Wang-Ma ticket for the 2008 
presidential race.  According to Wang, the DPP\'s strategy is 
to marginalize Wang by taking the LY speakership away from 
him and mothballing him by placing him in the Control Yuan 
(Note: President Chen recently publicly offered the Control 
Yuan position to Wang.  End Note)  Wang said that should the 
DPP succeed in eliminating Wang as a political player, it is 
unlikely that Ma would have a future.  Wang asserted that 
Taiwan would not be able to accept the Hong Kong-born Ma as a 
leader unless Ma was paired up with Wang.  Wang added that 
Taiwan would not even accept Ma as KMT Chairman.  Wang said, 
\"If Ma were KMT Chairman, the party would be branded as the 
Mainlander\'s party.\" 
 
Comment: Self-Interest or Serious Warning? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The clear subtext of Wang\'s comments on the special 
budget was that only he could ensure that the special defense 
acquisition budget would pass in a non-confrontational 
manner.  Thus the U.S. should see his reappointment as LY 
Speaker, even if the Pan-Blue loses on December 11, as in its 
best interests.  Nevertheless, Wang\'s warnings about the 
growing partisan divisions over the issue are legitimate. 
The People First Party\'s (PFP) decision in September to run 
against the defense budget and the DPP\'s response of labeling 
the Pan-Blue as sell-outs for their policy reversal have 
given the issue a partisan overlay that did not exist a year 
ago.  Wang was most likely exaggerating the prospects for 
street confrontations over the budget, since opinion on the 
subject, while divided, does not yet appear to be deep or 
emotional.

2. (C) President Chen Shui-bian told an audience on November 
27 that he will \"terminate the Chinese constitution\" during 
his second term of office, \"no matter how much international 
pressure there is.\"  Speaking at an international conference 
hosted by the Lee Teng-hui affiliated Taiwan Advocates think 
tank, Chen said that if the Pan-Green secured a legislative 
majority on December 11, he will ensure the enactment of a 
\"New Taiwan Constitution\" on May 20, 2008.  Chen asserted 
that this constitution would be subject to a referendum in 
2006 (note: this is required under the draft constitutional 
amendments passed by the Legislative Yuan in August, 2004, 
reftel).  The president compared Taiwan\'s use of the 1947 
\"ROC\" constitution meant for all of China to \"a child wearing 
adult clothes.\"  Chen sidestepped calls from Lee for Taiwan 
to establish a completely new constitution (zhixian), stating 
that what is important is the content of constitutional 
reform, not the terminology for the change. 
 
Lee Teng-hui: Revisions Are Not Enough

3. (C) Speaking at the same event, former President Lee 
criticized plans to simply \"revise\" the constitution, 
asserting that only a whole-scale rewrite of the document 
will allow Taiwan to have a constitution appropriate to 
current realities.  Lee continued that revisions would also 
fail to address the core problems of territorial definitions 
contained in the current constitution.  At a rally in Miaoli 
County the same day, Lee told a crowd that Taiwan needed a 
new constitution in order to finally break its linkages to 
China, drawing a parallel between the United States and Great 
Britain. 
 
Pan-Blue: Understanding and Provocations 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Pan-Blue reactions to Chen\'s statements diverged 
sharply.  KMT Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou told reporters that 
the president\'s statements were simply campaign rhetoric 
aimed at strengthening his core political base.  He expressed 
confidence that the president would not follow through on his 
campaign statements after the election due to pressure from 
the U.S.  He also urged people to \"have understanding\" over 
the president\'s political predicament, including pressure 
from former President Lee.  Other Pan-Blue leaders reacted 
sharply, with KMT Chairman Lien Chan reiterating his demand 
that Chen \"have the guts\" to call for a referendum on Taiwan 
independence on December 11.  People First Party (PFP) 
Chairman James Soong lashed out at both Chen and Ma, 
denouncing \"those Pan-Blue officials who would express 
\'understanding\' over the DPP\'s attempts to promote Taiwan 
independence.\" 
 
5. (C) Mayor Ma told the AIT Director on November 29 that the 
Pan-Blue leadership\'s attempts to respond to Chen\'s rhetoric 
simply played into the DPP\'s hands.  Despite Ma\'s public 
dismissal of Chen\'s constitution plans, the mayor asserted 
privately that he remains concerned over how the issue will 
be dealt with after the election, especially if the Pan-Green 
seizes a majority on December 11.  Ma said, however, that he 
would push for the KMT to play an active and constructive 
role on constitutional reform over the coming two years to 
ensure that the issue does not threaten Taiwan\'s security. 
 
Other Inflammatory Remarks 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (C) In addition to his Taiwan Advocates speech, Chen 
offered a series of other problematic formulations on the 
campaign trail over the November 27-28 weekend.  At a rally 
in Kaohsiung County, Chen stated that if the KMT refused to 
change its party symbol to something other than the national 
symbol, the Pan-Green would use its LY majority to find a new 
national symbol.  At an appearance in Hualien County, Chen 
also challenged \"those who claimed that the Republic of 
China\" encompassed the entire territory of the Mainland, 
Tibet, and Mongolia.  \"The Republic of China isn\'t that big, 
and can never be that big,\" he told the crowd.  At the same 
appearance, he also reiterated his recent formulation that 
the \"PRC is a different country.\" 
 
NSC Spin: Trying to Steer for the Center 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) National Security Council Secretary General Chiou 
I-jen told the Deputy Director on November 25 that the 
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is trying to steer away 
from the pro-independence fringe in the final two weeks of 
the campaign in order to win over centrist voters.  He 
asserted that the DPP refused a request from Lee\'s Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU) for Chen to attend a December 5 \"name 
rectification\" rally in order to distance the DPP from the 
TSU\'s radical agenda.  Chiou added that as a compromise, the 
 
SIPDIS 
DPP agreed to have Chen and Lee appear together at an evening 
campaign rally for Pan-Green candidates in Kaohsiung City on 
December 4.  However, he did not expect that Chen would use 
the venue to push on sensitive subjects like the 
constitution.  (Comment: Chiou did not mention at the time 
that Chen would be appearing together with Lee at the Taiwan 
Advocates conference this past weekend.  End Comment.) 
 
Comment: Same Message 
--------------------- 
 
8. (C) Chen has returned to the cycle of rhetorical 
gamesmanship that has become the hallmark of his campaign 
style.  While Chen often plays to the crowd with Taiwan-first 
themes, his willingness to push the envelope is most apparent 
when standing on stage together with Lee.  Chen\'s aides 
acknowledge this and say they will try to keep the president 
away from temptations during the final days of the campaign. 
Based on his track record, it is more likely that Chen will 
continue to play the Taiwan sovereignty card until voting day 
on December 11.  Afterwards, he will send a team of DPP 
spokespersons to the U.S. to try to control any damage done 
in the election.

1. (C) Summary: AIT relayed ref A and ref B talking points, 
and ref C inquiry regarding possible export control talks on 
December 15-16, to Taiwan\'s Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) and 
National Security Council (NSC) officials.  Both BOFT and NSC 
indicated tentative acceptance of December 15-16 dates. 
Request Washington confirmation of proposed export control 
talk dates/topics/desired participants (para 7).  BOFT 
identified items imported and exported by the Royal Richard 
Company (ref D) and provided a report on the types of machine 
tools exported by the Cheng Hwee Company (ref E).  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) On November 10 and 17 AIT delivered ref A and B 
demarches to NSC and BOFT officials.  Taiwan has not yet 
responded to these demarches, but promised it will do so 
after it completes investigation of the information provided. 
 
 
Export Control Policy Talks on December 15-16, 2004 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3. (C) AIT also informally raised the idea of export control 
talks in Taipei on December 15-16 with NSC and BOFT. Both 
agencies responded positively but asked for agenda details 
and desired participants.  BOFT Import/Export Administration 
Director Peter Ho suggested consulting individually with 
principals in Taiwan\'s key export control agencies on 
December 15, followed by an interagency meeting on December 
16.  NSC Senior Advisor Lin Chen-Wei also told AIT that 
December 15-16 was acceptable but noted a formal AIT proposal 
for talks would be needed to hold the dates open. 
 
BOFT Report on Royal Richard 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (C) On November 18, BOFT detailed Royal Richard\'s imports 
and exports in 2004 (refs D and E): Royal Richard imported 4 
kilograms of photographic papers and 8 kilograms of 
photographic films from South Korea in May 2004.  The total 
value was USD180.  Royal Richard exported 40 units of bug 
zapper lights in August 2004 to Ghana worth USD411.  Taiwan 
regulations require ships to formally declare hazardous 
chemicals such as sodium cyanide that transit Taiwan ports 
even if the cargo does not pass through Customs inspection or 
officially enter Taiwan Customs\' territory.  Customs 
statistics show no transshipments through Taiwan in 2004 of 
any Royal Richard cargoes, and no transshipments of sodium 
cyanide to North Korea or China. 
 
Cheng Hwee Trading Company 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Also on November 18, BOFT relayed to AIT the Taiwan 
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) investigation 
report on the 158 different items that the Cheng Hwee Trading 
Company had exported to North Korea over the past four years 
(ref E).  The report found that none of the items were 
strategic high technology commodities (SHTC).  BOFT added 
that even under Taiwan\'s new \"catch-all\" provisions, none of 
these items needed export licenses since there was no proof 
they would be used to produce military equipment. 
 
6. (C) Comment: Taiwan continues to insist that it is not 
stopping machine tool shipments to North Korea.  Taiwan\'s 
trade with North Korea involves only a few companies and a 
negligible percentage of its overall trade, yet authorities 
resist taking stronger measures to clamp down on machine tool 
exports. AIT believes that policy-level export control 
meetings are needed to drive home the message that potential 
damage to Taiwan\'s reputation far outweighs the benefits of 
trade with North Korea.  End comment. 
 
7. (C) Action Request: Request front channel confirmation of 
the proposal for export control talks on December 15-16, 
information on topics to be discussed, and desired agency or 
individual interlocutors.  End action request.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS, 
UKRAINE ELECTIONS 
 
1. U.S.-Taiwan Relations 
 
\"U.S. Continues Two-pronged Policy\" 
 
Associate professor Yu Pen-li of the Graduate Institute 
of American Studies, Tamkang University, said in the 
pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
(11/29): 
 
\". In the future, the new US government will face 
several new diplomatic challenges, such as the 
reconstruction of Iraq, the Israeli-Palestine situation 
following the death of Palestinian president Yasser 
Arafat and the North Korean nuclear issue.  Doubtless 
they would be glad to see stability in the Taiwan 
Strait and the Asia-Pacific region so that they can 
concentrate on these other issues. 
 
\". Following this logic, China will become its [i.e. 
Washington\'s] most important partner when it comes to 
global anti-terrorism and anti-proliferation efforts. 
Based on a realistic appraisal of the international 
political situation, the members of the Vulcan group 
will expand cooperation with China and downplay 
differences of opinion. 
 
\"In other words, if the Vulcans want to see China as a 
diplomatic and strategic partner in the 21st century, 
it would be impossible for them to oppose Beijing over 
the question of Taiwan. 
 
\"Based on Washington\'s objective of strategic balance 
in the Asia-Pacific region, stability in the Taiwan 
Strait will be an important pillar of US security, and 
Taiwan will be key in supporting this strategic 
balance.  From this perspective, Bush\'s new team will 
not rashly abandon Taiwan, and the US is unwilling to 
tie any other issue to its arms sales to Taiwan. 
 
\"But this support for Taiwan is not a blank check for 
Taiwan to use any which way.  Although Bush didn\'t 
repeat the statements Powell made at a press conference 
in Beijing while meeting with Chinese President Hu 
Jintao at the APEC summit in Chile, this doesn\'t mean 
that the Powell effect has dissipated.  The US leaders\' 
emphasis on a consistent cross-strait policy seems to 
mean that the US will continue its clear, two-pronged 
policy.  China should not take armed action, and Taiwan 
should not declare independence. 
 
\"In other words, the most important goal of US cross- 
strait policy is still to maintain the status quo, as 
defined by the US. 
 
\"If Taiwan\'s government continues to misjudge the 
international situation, and US statements lead them to 
believe that the storm following Powell\'s statement has 
blown out, it may continue to move toward independence 
by, for example, holding a Taiwan independence 
referendum, or amending the law to allow changing the 
national emblem.  This may cause the situation in the 
Taiwan Strait to deteriorate and maybe even give rise 
to a fourth cross-strait crisis. 
 
\"In future, it is possible that Washington will issue a 
fourth communiqu with Beijing, to avert a crisis and 
guarantee stability in the Taiwan Strait and in East 
Asia.  A fourth communiqu could clearly state that 
Taiwan does not enjoy sovereignty and that the US 
opposes Taiwan\'s independence, and even change the 
tactic of `pushing for dialogue\' to `pushing for 
unification\' in order to restrain Taiwan\'s actions. 
This could be even more harmful to Taiwan. 
 
\"For the sake of national interest, the most urgent 
task for Taiwan\'s government is to show restraint, 
strive for cross-strait stability, rebuild mutual trust 
between Taiwan and the US and put the US-Taiwan 
relationship back on track.  This is the only way that 
the nation can continue to exist and develop.\" 
 
2. Ukraine Elections 
 
\"Is Taiwan More Like the United States or Ukraine?\" 
 
Deputy Editor-in-Chief Kuo Chen-lung noted in the 
centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" (11/30): 
 
\"Taiwan\'s democratic development, though characterized 
d 
by its local color, is not really unique.  Other 
countries\' development models can often be used for 
comparison, and recently, the development models of the 
United States and of Ukraine are most frequently 
referred to. . 
 
\"[U.S.] President George W. Bush did not win his re- 
election by adopting a middle-of-the-road route but by 
locating those Christian voters who have rigid 
ideology.  In other words, the neo-conservatism that 
prevailed in Bush\'s first term did not dissipate or 
alter because of the unprecedented close [presidential] 
elections.  Rather, the conservative trend will be even 
more reinforced during Bush\'s second term because Bush 
has identified those fundamentalist voters as his 
`basic supporters.\'  Judged from this perspective, 
Taiwan\'s DPP is more like the current Republicans. . 
 
\"But in the eyes of the Taiwan people, what\'s more 
stirring is to look at the election dispute in Ukraine. 
. 
 
\"People cannot help but wonder what would have happened 
if some of the key political interactions in Ukraine 
had taken place in Taiwan?\" 
 
\"First, [in Ukraine,] the opposition congressmen met by 
themselves and determined that the results of the 
presidential election were invalid.  This move is a 
perfect demonstration of public opinion and Congress 
happens to be the institution that has absolute 
authority to do so when there is contention concerning 
the presidency of a nation.  What if the Pan-Blue camp, 
which held a majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan, 
called for an extraordinary session on March 20 and 
passed a resolution that nullified the president 
election results? 
 
\"Second, Ukraine\'s defense minister issued a statement 
saying he did not mobilize any troops and he did not 
intend to upgrade the alert level of the country. 
People saw such a move as [signifying that] the Ukraine 
military was holding a neutral position . and knew that 
the military would not step in even if there were a 
riot.  What would have happened if the then Taiwan 
Defense Minister Tang Yiau-ming had not claimed he was 
sick and stayed in the hospital and had instead spoken 
in public that the military will act according to the 
constitution and would stay neutral before the 
presidential election result is ascertained? 
 
\"Third, even though Ukraine\'s central election 
commission announced the ballot-counting results, the 
opposition faction demanded straight away that the 
country\'s supreme court stop the central election 
commission from making a formal announcement about the 
president-elect, and the supreme court immediately 
agreed to review the dispute case. . What would have 
happened if the Pan-Blue camp in Taiwan had filed the 
lawsuit regarding the controversial presidential 
election at the Grand Justices meeting instead of at 
the Taiwan High Court and had demanded that the Central 
Election Commission refrain from announcing [Chen Shui- 
bian] as the president-elect?\"

1. (C) Summary: National Security Council (NSC) Secretary 
General Chiou I-jen acknowledged continued USG concerns over 
where President Chen Shui-bian is leading Taiwan, but 
asserted that Chen knows that a move towards de jure 
independence would mean war.  Chiou said that Taiwan will 
continue to seek channels to convey Taipei\'s intentions to 
Beijing and asked Washington to help facilitate contacts. 
Chiou expressed optimism over passage of the USD 18 billion 
special procurement budget in the lame duck Legislative Yuan 
(LY) session that will open after the December 11 election. 
Chiou was upbeat over Pan-Green chances in the December 11 
election, estimating that the government will be able to 
exert working control over the LY with the help of 3-5 
non-partisans even if it does not secure an outright majority 
on its own.  End Summary. 
 
Chiou Says CSB Knows His Limits 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) During a November 25 dinner with the AIT Deputy 
Director, NSC Secretary General Chiou I-jen acknowledged that 
rhetoric used during the 2004 presidential election campaign 
has left many in Washington worried about President Chen\'s 
second term intentions.  Chiou said that President Chen is 
equally cognizant of this fact and is trying to rebuild the 
trust that was lost during the election period.  Chiou 
asserted that the USG \"should not worry\" that Chen will lead 
Taiwan towards independence in his second term because the 
president is fully aware that Beijing and the international 
community would not permit it.  \"If there was no PRC military 
threat, the president, myself, and everyone else in the 
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would prefer that Taiwan 
was independent,\" Chiou asserted, \"but we are not blind to 
reality.\"  Chiou dismissed speculation that Chen seeks a 
declaration of Taiwan independence as his historical legacy. 
\"Why would someone decide to make something that is 
impossible to achieve his overriding political goal?\" Chiou 
asked rhetorically. 
 
3. (C) Chiou acknowledged that there were elements within the 
president\'s base who were less realistic about Taiwan\'s 
constraints.  However, he noted that these voices were almost 
all from the older generation.  \"If you talk to the 
up-and-coming generation in the DPP, you will not hear the 
sorts of things advocated by people like the vice president,\" 
he added.  Chiou pledged to keep an eye on actions by the 
government that may impact on cross-Strait stability.  As an 
example, Chiou said he previewed the Executive Yuan\'s (EY) 
recently introduced revisions to the opposition-passed 
Referendum Law to ensure that they did not lower the bar to 
initiate referenda on constitutional-related subjects. 
(Comment: Chiou acknowledged, however, that he had not 
considered whether the revisions would make it easier to 
initiate a referendum on sensitive subjects like \"one 
country, two systems\" that were not necessarily related to 
constitutional reform.  Nor did he address a possibility 
raised with AIT by KMT Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, that 
non-binding \"consultative\" referenda on sensitive subjects 
could be used to cow the LY opposition into passing 
constitutional amendments they would otherwise oppose, 
Septel.) 
 
Reality as Beijing Sees It 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Chiou said he fully shares USG concerns over Beijing\'s 
increasingly alarmist views of developments in Taiwan, and 
stated that this is the reason Taipei is so eager to 
establish some sort of a dialogue channel with the PRC.  \"We 
may think they are worried about 10 issues when it turns out 
they are focused on 100,\" he stated, \"the only way we will be 
able to clarify their concerns is by talking to them as we do 
with the U.S. and other countries.\"  Chiou noted that recent 
PRC public statements indicate that Beijing is unwilling to 
show flexibility on the \"one China\" precondition for formal 
talks.  If this is the case, he continued, Chiou suggested 
that the two sides open a private channel \"where face will 
not be an issue.\"  Chiou appealed to Washington to help 
facilitate such a channel. 
Special Procurement Budget: Cautious Optimism 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Turning to bilateral issues, Chiou expressed optimism 
that the USD 18 billion special defense procurement budget 
would pass in the December-January lame duck LY session. 
Chiou said he expected Lien Chan and other Pan-Blue leaders 
to oppose the budget out of spite for their losses in the 
presidential and LY elections.  However, Chiou asserted that 
the DPP would exploit anticipated splits within the KMT over 
leadership secession to assemble a majority.  \"KMT reformists 
are likely to embrace the special budget as one of the issues 
to push Lien and his cadre out of power,\" Chiou stated. 
Chiou assessed that KMT LY President Wang Jin-pyng would try 
to use cooperation over the special budget as a bargaining 
chip with the DPP to secure his own political future.  Chiou 
said the DPP would accommodate Wang to some extent, but not 
as far as allowing him to keep his speakership in the next 
LY.  Chiou predicted that, in the end, Wang would facilitate 
passage in order to curry favor with KMT reformists as part 
of his own bid for the KMT chairmanship. 
 
Domestic Politics: Pan-Green Majority Within Reach 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6. (C) Chiou said that the DPP\'s LY campaign is generally on 
track, but said the Pan-Green is not yet confident enough to 
predict an outright Pan-Green majority.  Chiou offered that 
the DPP currently projects that it will win 96 seats, with 
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) picking up an additional 
14, for a total of 110 (out of 225).  Chiou estimated that 
the DPP could gain an additional three seats if it dropped 
one candidate each from its lists in Taipei County Second 
District, Taipei City North, and Taoyuan County.  However, he 
said no decision on shifting resources away from struggling 
candidates would be made until December 1.  Chiou asserted, 
however, that even if the Pan-Green falls short of the 113 
needed for a majority, the DPP can assemble a working LY 
majority with the help of 3-5 friendly non-partisans 
(Septel).  Chiou added that the DPP will certainly appoint a 
non-partisan as LY Vice President, most likely fourth-term 
aboriginal legislator Walis Pelin, to solidify its control 
over the body. 
 
Comment: Is Chiou for Real? 
--------------------------- 
 
7. (C) To us Chiou clearly portrays his role in the Chen 
administration as the voice of moderation, informing the 
political leaders of the international and cross-Strait 
implications of their words and actions and balancing against 
the influence of the DPP\'s pro-independence wing.  However, 
Chiou is actively involved in DPP political strategy, even in 
his current foreign policy position.  It is unlikely that 
Chiou has been as surprised as he claims to be by some of the 
more provocative themes the president has floated in recent 
weeks.  Chen\'s focus on sovereignty themes on the campaign 
trail was not an aberration, it was a core element of the 
DPP\'s plan to stimulate its core support base.  As with the 
last election, Chen and his senior advisors appear to have 
mapped out a strategy that would use \"goodwill\" gestures such 
as the October 10 speech and November 10 \"10 Points\" 
initiatives to distract international attention from more 
provocative elements of the DPP\'s campaign platform.  Chiou 
is among the most respected campaign strategists in the DPP 
camp and thus quite likely a key player in this two-handed 
strategy.

1. (C) Summary: President Chen Shui-bian used an open press 
meeting with a group of visiting U.S. Congressmen on November 
30 to respond to the State Department Spokesman\'s warning 
over constitutional revisions.  Chen stated that there has 
been no change to the policy line he articulated in his May 
20 inaugural address, October 10 National Day speech, and 
November \"10 Points\" policy statement.  Chen noted that the 
constitutional referendum he referred to on November 27 is 
consistent with the established constitutional processes. 
Other Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) officials echoed 
this theme in an effort to respond to Pan-Blue 
characterizations of the State Department statement as a USG 
rebuke to Chen over his recent campaign rhetoric.  End 
Summary. 
 
Chen Responds to U.S. Comments 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Presidential Office Deputy Secretary General James 
Huang informed the AIT Director that President Chen Shui-bian 
used a November 30 press availability to respond to concerns 
raised by State Department Spokesman Boucher on November 29 
over Chen\'s recent references to a constitutional referendum. 
 During an open press meeting with a group of visiting U.S. 
Members of Congress, President Chen told reporters that he 
will not waver during his last term in office from his May 
20, 2004 inaugural promises.  Chen stated that Taiwan will 
conduct the upcoming round of constitutional revisions within 
the bounds of current constitutional procedures.  Chen 
explained that his recent statement about a constitutional 
referendum in 2006 (Ref A) referred to rules established 
under the draft set of constitutional provisions passed by 
the Legislative Yuan (LY) on August 23, 2004 (Ref B).  Chen 
added that he will not deviate from his 2000 \"five no\'s 
pledge\" and the policy platforms laid out in his May 20 
inauguration address, October 10 National Address (Ref C), 
and November 10 \"10 Points\" speech (Ref D).  (Note: Open 
press events are a common feature of presidential meetings 
with visiting dignitaries.  End Note.) 
 
3. (SBU) Presidential Office Deputy SecGen Huang held a 
subsequent press conference to amplify on the president\'s 
remarks and reiterate Taipei\'s willingness to engage with the 
U.S. and other international partners over the constitutional 
revision process.  In the course of the afternoon, the 
Premier, MOFA Spokesman, and DPP party officials echoed the 
president\'s line in their efforts to keep the State 
Department statement out of the pre-election media spotlight. 
 DPP LY Caucus Leader Tsai Huang-lang told reporters that the 
DPP would pursue constitutional revisions within the bounds 
set by President Chen\'s \"five no\'s.\"  Tsai also noted that 
before constitutional revisions are submitted for approval by 
public referendum, they will require prior endorsement by 
three-quarters of the LY membership.  Tsai and other DPP 
officials said they would \"communicate\" this information to 
the U.S. side to clarify apparent \"misunderstandings.\" 
 
Pan-Blue Hails Warning 
---------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Pan-Blue officials quickly claimed that the 
Spokesman\'s remarks vindicated their recent assertions that 
Chen is leading Taiwan towards a cross-Strait crisis.  KMT 
Spokesman Chang Jung-kung characterized the State Department 
statement as a serious rebuke to President Chen and an 
indication that the USG fears a coming cross-Strait conflict. 
 People First Party (PFP) LY Caucus Leader Liu Wen-hsiung 
told reporters that the USG comments reflected the depth of 
problems that have arisen in cross-Strait ties under the Chen 
government. 
 
Comment: A Useful Reminder 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The November 29 Spokesman\'s comments should serve as a 
useful reminder to Taiwan\'s political actors that the ongoing 
LY election campaign is not being conducted in a vacuum. 
Insiders may argue that USG public warnings have less direct 
impact on the ongoing political campaign as they did during 
the presidential race due to the localized nature of LY 
elections and the expected low turnout among conservative 
centrist voters.  Nevertheless, the DPP is eager to portray 
itself as the pro-American party -- and portray the 
opposition as anti-U.S. -- and thus may take the November 29 
statement as a warning that further rebukes will be 
forthcoming if Chen does not tone down his rhetoric. 
Taipei\'s quick reaction to the State Department statement 
serves as yet another reminder that public, as opposed to 
private, warnings are a highly effective means for focusing 
minds in Taiwan\'s media-driven political world.

1. (C) Summary: Presidential Office Deputy Secretary General 
James Huang asked AIT to convey a request for USG 
understanding over President Chen Shui-bian\'s recent 
constitution-related campaign rhetoric.  Huang acknowledged 
that some of Chen\'s recent language had been \"a little 
strong,\" especially his reference to \"putting an end to the 
Chinese constitution.\"  However, Huang asserted that Chen has 
been careful to remain within the bounds of his May 20 
inaugural policy line in substantive terms.  Huang asserted 
that Chen\'s approach on the constitution in the campaign has 
been calibrated to marginalize calls by former President Lee 
Teng-hui to completely replace the current constitution. 
Huang said that the Chen administration will seek in the 
coming days to lay out for AIT and Washington the 
government\'s thinking on constitutional reform after December 
11.  Huang\'s comments to AIT came on the same day the 
president publicly thanked the State Department Spokesman for 
\"welcoming\" Chen\'s November 30 pledge not to go beyond past 
commitments.  End Summary. 
 
Political Calculations 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) Presidential Office Deputy Secretary General James 
Huang asked AIT December 1 to convey to Washington the 
president\'s sincerity in abiding by his May 20 inaugural 
promises.  Huang asserted that Chen has been trying to walk a 
fine line on the constitution issue during the ongoing 
presidential campaign.  On the one hand, Huang claimed that 
Chen is seeking to fend off attempts by Lee Teng-hui to 
dominate the constitution debate (Comment: Which 
coincidentally might also help Lee poach Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) votes for his own Taiwan Solidary 
Union (TSU) party.  End Comment).  At the same time, Huang 
continued, Chen has been careful not to say anything that 
would substantively alter the limits he imposed on the 
constitutional revision process on May 20 and in subsequent 
statements.  Huang acknowledged that some of Chen\'s recent 
language has been \"a little strong,\" especially his reference 
to \"putting an end to the Chinese constitution.\"  However, he 
said that this sort of hyperbole is commonplace in Taiwan 
election campaigns. 
 
3. (C) Huang stated that Chen\'s October 10 reference to \"the 
Republic of China equals Taiwan\" (Ref A) and more recent 
comments about constitutional revision were attempts to 
undercut Lee\'s campaign to \"establish a new 
constitution/rectify the name (of the country)\" (zhixian 
zhengming).  Huang noted that during Chen\'s November 27 
Taiwan Advocates speech, and in subsequent campaign 
references to constitutional reform (Ref B), the president 
had explicitly stated that constitutional reforms would be 
conducted within the procedures established by the current 
constitutional framework.  Huang added that Chen\'s decision 
to attend the November 27 Taiwan Advocates conference was 
intended to ensure that Lee\'s constitutional plan did not 
dominate the weekend headlines. 
 
Taipei Surprised? 
----------------- 
 
4. (C) Huang claimed that prior to the State Department 
Spokesman\'s November 29 comments (Ref C), the Chen 
administration was not aware that the USG was concerned over 
recent rhetoric.  He added that Taipei assumed that 
Washington was less concerned about campaign language than 
about formal policy statements.  In light of the most recent 
episode, Huang said that there is an internal review underway 
over how to enhance communications with the U.S.-side over 
Taipei\'s intentions on the constitution, both before and 
after the December 11 election.  Huang said that he would 
likely contact AIT in the next 24-48 hours to convey a more 
formal message for Washington.  Huang added that, in his 
view, dialogue over the constitution and other sensitive 
issues should be conducted on a regular basis via existing 
AIT/TECRO channels rather than one-off special missions.  In 
this context, Huang said the delegation going to the U.S. 
after the election (whose members include Presidential 
Advisor Tsai Ing-wen, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) 
Deputy Secretary General Y.Y. Lee, and Deputy Minister of 
Defense Michael Tsai) would not be authorized to convey any 
policy message to the USG.  Huang described the group as 
purely \"academic\" in nature. 
 
5. (C) AIT responded that while we would welcome enhanced 
communications, the track record of the past several months 
has been decidedly mixed.  AIT expressed appreciation for the 
government\'s willingness to consult in advance about major 
policy speeches, but pointed out that clarifications over 
Chen\'s October 10 \"ROC equals Taiwan\" and more recent 
constitutional formulations came only after the fact.  This, 
it was noted, raised questions about whether AIT was being 
consulted or simply \"spun.\"  In addition, AIT was not 
informed in advance of the president\'s intention to speak on 
constitutional revision at Lee Teng-hui\'s Taiwan Advocates 
conference.  (Note: This is true even though National 
Security Advisor Chiou I-jen had made a point of reassuring 
AIT two days earlier concerning Chen\'s planned campaign event 
with Lee on December 4 (Ref ).  End Note.)  Huang said Taipei 
would try to do a better job of keeping AIT abreast of the 
president\'s plans.  He also reiterated that the only venue 
where Chen and Lee will appear together between now and 
election day is at a December 4 evening rally in Kaohsiung 
City.  Huang emphasized that Chen would not take part in the 
TSU\'s December 5 \"name rectification\" rally. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
CSB Reiterates No Changes, \"Thanks\" Boucher 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) On the same day as Huang\'s remarks to AIT, President 
Chen used an open press meeting with the Utah Governor 
attended by the AIT Director to amplify his November 30 
pledge to abide by past commitments regarding constitutional 
reform (Ref C).  Chen explained in detail the process for 
constitutional revision under the procedures passed in August 
by the Legislative Yuan (LY) (Ref E).  Chen noted that a 
referendum is stipulated under these provisions, but only 
after \"three out of four\" members of the LY approve them. 
(Note: Chen acknowledged that these new procedures have not 
yet been approval by a yet-to-be-selected National Assembly. 
End Note.).  During his December 1 remarks, Chen also 
expressed appreciation for State Department Spokesman 
Boucher\'s reported reaction to the president\'s November 30 
clarification.  Chen told the press \"I have learned that the 
State Department\'s Spokesman welcomed my remarks, and I would 
like to express sincere appreciation for that.\" 
 
Comment: Damage Control Mode 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Chen and his aides were clearly spooked by the 
Spokesman\'s warning and the widespread media coverage it 
received in Taipei.  Coming the same week that Standard and 
Poor\'s cited cross-Strait tensions among its reasons for 
downgrading Taiwan\'s risk rating, Chen is likely to chart a 
more cautious rhetorical course in the coming days.  The 
president and his advisors are also likely to seek to enhance 
consultations with AIT and Washington, if for no other reason 
than to avoid any further public rebukes.  However, we do not 
accept their claims to be surprised over USG concerns over 
Chen\'s recent \"campaign rhetoric.\"  AIT has repeatedly 
emphasized in private to Chen administration officials from 
the president on down that both Washington and Beijing would 
pay particular attention to the language used during the 
legislative campaign.  With the president in full election 
mode, it apparently required a public reminder and 
accompanying political costs before the president and his 
advisors chose to moderate his rhetoric.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
 
A) \"The Actual Situation Regarding the Timeline for 
[Taiwan\'s] New Constitution and an Evaluation of Its 
External Effects\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" observed in 
its editorial (12/1): 
 
\". We don\'t know if President Chen\'s clarification 
[regarding his plan to hold a referendum on a new 
constitution in 2006] can really eliminate Washington\'s 
worry that Taiwan will have a new constitution in the 
next few years.  But from [State Department Spokesman] 
Richard Boucher\'s remarks [Monday] . and the previous 
statement by a U.S. official that the status quo of the 
Taiwan Strait should be defined by the United States, 
[it is evident that] the United States cannot be rid of 
its doubts about Taiwan\'s intention to unilaterally 
change the status quo just because Chen argues that it 
agrees with Taiwan\'s constitutional procedures to hold 
a referendum on the new constitution.  Or to borrow 
Chen\'s words, what the United States cares about is not 
the argument about whether it is constitutional to hold 
such a referendum but whether the unilateral move by 
Taiwan will cause substantive changes to the status quo 
in the Taiwan Strait, a development that would give 
Beijing an excuse to adopt radical actions to force the 
United States to get involved in the unpredictable 
disputes across the Taiwan Strait.\" 
 
\"Objectively speaking, Washington\'s doubts are 
reasonable because its intention is try to prevent 
anything from happening between the two sides of the 
Taiwan Strait.  But since the United States is reacting 
like this, it is expected that Beijing will react more 
strongly in the regular press briefing by China\'s 
Taiwan Affairs Office today.  President Chen\'s remarks, 
judged from Beijing\'s perspective, have actually proved 
his consistent position from de jure Taiwan 
independence to substantive Taiwan independence. 
Especially in the face of such a timetable for ... the 
new constitution, Beijing may be forced, in response, 
to talk about the timeline for reunification or even 
upgrading its military readiness to use force to stop 
Taiwan from moving toward independence.\" 
 
B) \"Chen Shui-bian Is Exhausting the U.S. Trust in Him\" 
 
Journalist Chang Hui-ying wrote in the centrist, pro- 
status quo \"China Times\" (12/1): 
 
\". No one will trust the positive comments you make if 
you have gone back on your word too many times.  Only 
the negative ones will be heard.  The consequences will 
be the using up of one\'s credibility and the 
disqualification of one\'s privilege to make good-will 
promises.  It is because any good-will gesture will not 
be trusted.  As a result, there will be no space for 
policy [flexibility], and one [Chen] has to live on 
extremist remarks. 
 
\"The United States has obviously shortened 
significantly the `time span of its trust\' toward 
Taiwan.  In the past, Chen Shui-bian would have to have 
overstepped the bounds several times before the United 
States noticed.  But now every step or move by him is 
closely watched all the time.  Whenever he says 
something, he is asked to explain.  There is no time 
lag to play with.  However, at least for the time 
being, Chen Shui-bian has not been intimidated by the 
United States.  After all, there is still the ... lag 
between U.S. pressure and Taiwan\'s elections.\" 
 
C) \"It Is Not in the United States\' Interests to Strike 
Taiwan in Order to Pacify China\" 
 
A commentary by Tsou Jiin-wen in the pro-independence 
\"Liberty Times\" said (12/1): 
 
\"The U.S. Department of State is speaking again.  The 
tone being heard this time by the people of Taiwan is 
entirely different from the feeling they had before the 
U.S. general elections.  Before the elections, the 
Taiwan people were more understanding toward the 
offending but honest comments made by the superpower 
ally.  But after President Bush\'s re-election, many 
Taiwan people would like to say: please, my old friend, 
don\'t treat Taiwan\'s dignity as if it were nothing. 
 
\"Taiwan is already a completely democratic nation.  Its 
people are absolutely entitled to decide what is a 
modern constitution that meets the demands of the time. 
They also have the wisdom to calculate and bear the 
consequences of their choices.  There is no need for a 
foreign spokesperson to openly call on Taiwan\'s head of 
state by name and ask him to provide `an explanation.\' 
 
\"There is no room for dictatorship in Taiwan anymore. 
Even if a president has promised something by himself, 
the promise does not mean anything unless the people of 
Taiwan approve it. 
 
\". [If the United States treats Taiwan] using selective 
democratic standards and conditional justice, it is not 
impossible that the advocacy for a peaceful takeover by 
China will win the upper hand when Taiwan is pushed 
into a corner.  By that time where will the U.S. 
interest lie? .\" 
 
D) \"Chen Is Required by U.S. to Clarify Referendum 
Talk\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" editorialized (12/1): 
 
\"President Chen Shui-bian\'s credibility was questioned 
once again yesterday by Washington when a State 
Department spokesman demanded that the Taipei leader 
clarified (sic) his recent remarks about his intention 
to hold a referendum on a new Constitution for Taiwan 
in 2006. . 
 
\"Here in Taipei, Chen was quick to deny that his latest 
take about holding a referendum to decide a new 
Constitution in 2006 has violated his past promises. 
But the fact is that Chen indeed contradicted the 
remarks he had made in May this year when he assumed 
office to begin his second term. 
 
\"In that inaugural speech, Chen explicitly pledged that 
his constitutional \'re-engineering\' project would be 
achieved in accordance with the \'existing 
constitutional procedures.\'  That is, the reform 
project would be first passed by the Legislature and 
then ratified by an ad hoc National Assembly.  Beyond 
that, he didn\'t say anything about conducting a popular 
vote in 2006 to adopt a new Constitution. . 
 
\"Chen must have anticipated that his remarks could 
provoke Washington and Beijing, earning him charges of 
breaking his important political promises.  But 
obviously he must also have calculated that at this 
point in time nothing counts more than the need for him 
to win a stable majority in the Legislature in next 
week\'s elections. 
 
\"It\'s really unfortunate that we should have a leader 
who would not hesitate to do anything for the good of 
his and his party\'s political interests even if this 
would mean jeopardizing the security of Taiwan and its 
people.\"

SUBJECT: \"CHINA TIMES\" ARTICLES ON WASHINGTON\'S 
CONCERNS OVER TAIWAN\'S PLAN FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION 
 
Summary:  The Chinese-language \"China Times\" carried a 
news analysis by Washington correspondent Liu Ping 
discussing the United States\' concerns over some recent 
moves by Taiwan that might have crossed the \"red line\" 
and as a result, triggered tension across the Taiwan 
Strait.  The \"China Times\" also ran an on-the-spot 
report describing State Department Richard Boucher\'s 
reaction when he replied to a related question at the 
State Department\'s regular news briefing.  Full text 
translation of the news analysis and some block quotes 
of the on-the-spot report follow. 
 
A) \"Worrying about Taiwan Crossing the Red Line, the 
United States Sends out Warnings\" 
 
Washington correspondent Liu Ping said in the centrist, 
pro-status quo \"China Times\" (12/1): 
 
\"On an early autumn evening, in a city away from 
Washington, a U.S official in charge of East Asian 
affairs lamented: \"There has never been any U.S. 
president that is so friendly with Taiwan like 
President George W. Bush.  But many of the approaches 
or moves taken by Taiwan . .\" A senior adviser to 
Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian placed advertisements 
in U.S. newspapers questioning the United States\' cross- 
Strait policy; a Taiwan official whose rank equals that 
of a premier hosted a conference in Washington on 
`instituting a constitution [for Taiwan],\' something 
that Washington hates to see; cross-Strait tension has 
escalated [beyond] that of four years ago; and Taiwan\'s 
special arms procurement budget, which the United 
States cares very much about, has now reached an 
impasse and does not seem to be going anywhere.  All of 
the events above are reasons why this American official 
felt sad.  The statements by Secretary of State Collin 
Powell later that astonished Taiwan also had something 
to do with these reasons. 
 
\"Over the past few weeks, as [Taiwan\'s] legislative 
election approaches, several moves by Taiwan have 
really opened the United States\' eyes.  Candidates 
running in the legislative elections are talking 
recklessly; moreover, President Chen has been 
continuously throwing out one issue after another.  Of 
course the United States can sometimes dismiss such 
issues with a laugh, but for certain issues, it has to 
face them cautiously.  The `soft coup\' issue belongs to 
the former category, while the `referendum on a new 
constitution\' belongs to the latter one. 
 
\"Among the issues that President Chen has talked about 
lately, the new constitution is not the only one that 
the United States is worried about.  The United States 
has also expressed concern over such controversial 
issues as revising `history textbooks\' and `changing 
[Taiwan\'s] national emblem.\'  Rumor has it that Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State Randy Schriver called 
Taipei and inquired about the dispute over history 
textbooks.  What is involved in these issues is not 
only that a new crisis might emerge across the Taiwan 
Strait but also that a confrontation might ignite 
within Taiwan, and this is something that the United 
States does not hope to see. 
 
\"The United States knows that many remarks made by 
President Chen are campaign rhetoric.  However, when 
some comments have been said repeatedly not only by 
Chen himself but also by people who surround him, and 
they have been said not only in Taiwan but also in the 
United States as well, the United States cannot view 
these comments simply as [being meant for] `domestic 
consumption in Taiwan.\'  What the United States is 
concerned about is that Taiwan has been trying to use 
this approach to test the bottom line.  It is uncertain 
when Taiwan will cross the red line if the United 
States does not stop Taiwan right now. 
 
\"As James Mulvenon, an expert at Rand Corp, said at a 
seminar on the Peoples\' Liberation Army, 2006 is a 
critical year because President Chen will hold a 
referendum on [Taiwan\'s] new constitution that year -- 
a move that will indicate `crossing the de jure red 
line\' and bring unexpectedly serious consequences [for 
Taiwan]. 
 
\"Many experts and scholars share the same concerns. 
According to their observations, some people in Taiwan 
firmly believe that China will not use force against 
Taiwan, especially before 2008 (when the Olympic Games 
are to be held in Beijing).  Even if China did use 
force against Taiwan, the United States would 
definitely defeat China.  Hence, the DPP government 
chose to put the new constitution to a referendum in 
2006 and put it into effect in 2008.  Due to these 
concerns, the United States has explicitly expressed 
its view that President Chen\'s \"four No\'s\" pledge and 
the referendum on a new constitution cannot be viewed 
separately. 
 
\"Sources said the United States is actually very 
concerned about [Taiwan\'s] special arms budget.  As a 
result, the United States would be very happy if 
President Chen\'s campaign rhetoric was being made in 
order to help the Pan-Green alliance win the majority 
of seats [in the legislative elections] and, further, 
to get the budget [passed] as soon as possible. 
However, since the purpose of the arms budget is to 
maintain the peace [across the Taiwan Strait], any 
careless campaign rhetoric that may result in burying 
peace is not in the interests of the United States. 
 
\"In the aforementioned seminar, a paper presented by 
Heritage Foundation specialist John Tkacik (which was 
read out by his colleague Harvey Feldman) pointed out 
that many people consider Chinese President Hu Jintao 
to be a reformer, like the Mikhail Gorbachev of China, 
but in reality he is not.  `Gorbachev did not have iron 
teeth, but Hu Jintao does,\' Tkacik said.  The 
implication is that Hu will take a hard stand [toward 
Taiwan] whenever necessary.  Since the ruling 
government in Taiwan welcomes every statement made by 
Tkacik, why does it not take his observation about Hu 
more seriously?\" 
 
B) \"Richard Boucher Puts It in a Serious Way When He 
Asks Chen to Give an Explanation\" 
 
Washington correspondent Liu Ping said in a second 
article in the centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
(12/1): 
 
\". But when asked about President Chen\'s plan to `hold 
a referendum on [Taiwan\'s] new constitution\', [State 
Department Spokesman] Richard Boucher stopped smiling, 
took out written documents that had been prepared in 
advance, and read out verbatim Chen\'s `four No\'s\' 
pledge he made four years ago.  When talking, Boucher 
`complimented President Chen\'s commitment and his later 
reconfirmation,\' but on the other hand, he used words 
like `take it seriously,\' `the (pledge) is very, very 
important\' to express the United States\' strong concern 
about whether [Chen] can keep his commitments. 
 
\"It is rare to hear [Boucher use] words like `such 
commitments must be respected.\'  He was reminding Chen 
that `A ruler is expected to honor all his promises,\' 
but in reality, he was admonishing Chen not to cross 
the red line.  Diplomatic rhetoric can sound very 
reserved, but one must read the meaning concealed 
between the lines.  Boucher is well-known for giving 
moderate replies.  But judging from his choice of 
words, the context, his posture and the scene on the 
spot, what the United States wanted to convey was 
actually very clear.\"

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
 
A) \"A-bian\'s Pledge\" 
 
Washington correspondent Vincent Chang said in the 
conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
(12/2): 
 
\". President Chen immediately reiterated his `four 
No\'s\' pledge in response to the State Department\'s 
concerns.  The Chen Shui-bian administration has 
obviously discovered that unlike the past four years, 
the Bush administration in its second term will no 
longer tolerate Chen\'s willful remarks or behaviors 
that cause him to constantly step on the red line and 
trespass the bottom line set by Washington. 
 
\"Yes, the bottom line has emerged.  Washington has put 
all the pledges that Chen has made over the past four 
years together and woven them into a big net. 
Washington will cast the net over Chen, lock him up and 
push him back every time when it feels that Chen has 
crossed the boundary of `Chen\'s pledge\' as interpreted 
by the Americans.  It looks like the United States will 
not act carelessly or hesitate to inflict punishment 
against Chen\'s move this time. . 
 
\"Having served as president for four years, Chen has 
grown accustomed to using the game of words to test 
Washington\'s bottom line, and he seems to quite enjoy 
doing so.  The Taiwan people have long become used to 
Chen\'s being a chameleon all the time and throwing out 
one promise after another.  What\'s quite unexpected is 
that the Americans take Chen\'s pledge seriously and ask 
him to stick to it.  Now the ever-changing A-bian has 
forced the Bush administration to show all its cards 
regarding the Taiwan policy.  As a result, Chen has 
also exhausted all the flexibility and space that 
Taiwan used to enjoy and left no room for vagueness. 
 
\"This is something probably Chen has never expected.\" 
 
B) \"Military Mutual Trust and Political Mutual Trust\" 
 
Journalist Wu Ming-chieh noted in the centrist, pro- 
status quo \"China Times\" (12/2): 
 
\"Since the end of last year, misunderstanding caused by 
lack of mutual trust between the United States and 
Taiwan has, several times, brought bilateral relations 
to an impasse.  But on the other hand, the mutual trust 
with regard to military between the two sides has been 
enhanced rather than been reduced.  Judged from this 
perspective, [it is evident that] Washington\'s current 
policy toward Taiwan is to separate politics with 
military.  Nonetheless, strengthening military mutual 
trust between Washington and Taipei is still in the 
United States\' interests for the time being, but 
building political mutual trust has become a burden for 
the United States.  It remains to be seen whether these 
two kinds of mutual trust will affect each other in the 
future. . 
 
\"Over the past year, Taiwan and the United States have 
maintained stable military exchanges even when both 
sides did not have sufficient political mutual trust. 
Obviously there is a certain force inside the United 
States that supports Taiwan security.  The foundation 
of such a force comes from the thinking that to 
maintain Taiwan\'s security is to maintain the United 
States\' national interests.  Even though Taiwan can 
make use of this force in exchange for military 
bargaining chips to advance its self defense, it might 
end up in gaining nothing either politically or 
militarily if it hopes to use this bargaining chip to 
alter Washington\'s thinking about the Taiwan policy - 
namely, to renounce `one China\' policy or to accept 
Taiwan independence. .\" 
 
C) \"An Independent Sovereign State Should Have the 
Autonomy to Either Institute or Amend Its Constitution\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" commented in an 
editorial (12/1): 
 
\"[State Department Spokesman] Richard Boucher said `our 
primary interest is in maintaining stability across the 
Taiwan Strait, and the United States is opposed to any 
unilateral steps that would change the status quo.\' `We 
are opposed to any referendum that would change 
Taiwan\'s status or move towards independence.\' 
Boucher\'s remarks showed that Washington is concerned 
about Taiwan\'s push for constitutional reform because 
it misunderstands Taiwan\'s plan for a new constitution 
and thinks it is a referendum that will move toward 
independence.  Also, Washington\'s misjudgment of the 
cross-Strait situation makes it believe that Taiwan 
wants to change the status quo, a move that might lead 
to escalated tension across the Taiwan Strait.  But in 
reality, Washington\'s doubts about President Chen\'s 
timetable for the new constitution is totally 
unnecessary.  First, we have emphasized repeatedly that 
following several decades\' of democratization and 
localization, ... Taiwan is already an independent 
sovereign state.  It does not need to seek to confirm 
its independent status by a referendum or a new 
constitution. .  The plan to give birth to a new 
constitution is actually a movement to make Taiwan a 
normal country.  The making of a timely, relevant and 
viable constitution will make Taiwan a country worthy 
of its name. 
 
\"The goal for Taiwan\'s plan to institute a new 
constitution is to `de-Sanitize,\' to get rid of 
everything that was made by the KMT, and to be a 
normalized country.  This is an internal restructuring 
of Taiwan\'s constitutional system and also a 
manifestation of Taiwan people\'s consciousness of their 
sovereignty.  The move will not jeopardize any other 
countries\' interests and is unrelated to the 
international situation.  Thus, why do people outside 
Taiwan worry that it will unilaterally change the 
status quo and trigger tension across the Taiwan 
Strait?\" 
 
D) \"US Need Not Rein in Chen\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
editorialized (12/2): 
 
\"US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said 
recently he thinks President Chen Shui-bian should 
clarify whether his latest statements about a 
referendum and a new constitution violate his `four 
no\'s\' pledge. . 
 
\"As the US is unable to distinguish between the 
political parties here, it is only natural for them to 
try to put down the brakes on referendum talk, and try 
to cool things down in order to avoid further tension 
in cross-strait relations. 
 
\"So has Chen overstepped his boundaries? Judging from 
his inauguration speeches in 2000 and this year, as 
well as the \'10 points\' he made during a speech last 
month, he seems to be standing firmly on his promise 
not to declare independence, change the national flag 
or title, or hold a referendum on unification or 
independence.  But he has also promised the people of 
Taiwan a suitable new constitution during his term - 
and that it will be decided via a referendum.  At a 
quick glance, these two promises seem to be 
contradictory, but a more thorough look reveals his 
advocacy of amending the Constitution as being on the 
safe side of the US\' `bottom line.\' 
 
\"First, the Constitution in its current form was 
created in China, in 1947.  It is a Constitution aimed 
at ruling the vast territories and population of China, 
Tibet and Mongolia, and as such it is of course 
unsuitable to the territory and people currently under 
its jurisdiction. . 
 
\"Second, in his May 20 inauguration speech, Chen stated 
specifically that since there was no domestic consensus 
over what to do about the national flag, national title 
and the territories mapped out by the Constitution, 
these would not be subject to amendment.  As the 
symbols of the nation are not to be included in the 
discussions over constitutional amendments - and any 
amendment will be confined to restructuring the 
administrative and political system - then clearly Chen 
has not gone beyond the parameters set by the US. . 
 
\"The DPP advocates a constitutional amendment that will 
retain the country\'s national emblems, while the Taiwan 
Solidarity Union advocates the creation of a new 
constitution for the nation of Taiwan.  Because of this 
divergence over amendments and the creation of a new 
constitution, Chen and former president Lee Teng-hui 
have aired their differences publicly.  Washington 
should not confuse the proposals of the DPP and the 
TSU, even though they are both a part of the pan-green 
 
SIPDIS 
camp.\" 
 
\"Every country needs to make adjustments to its laws in 
response to a changing environment.  Although Taiwan\'s 
international situation is unusual and its often finds 
itself under international scrutiny, it retains the 
right to build a political system adapted to its needs, 
so long as this action does not negatively impact its 
security and that of the international community.\" 
 
E) \"Warning from the U.S.\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" editorialized (12/2): 
 
\". Although neither he [i.e. President Chen Shui-bian] 
nor the others in his administration explicitly 
mentioned it, the plan [to put a new constitution for 
Taiwan to a referendum in 2006] would amount to the 
declaration of Taiwan independence.  If implemented, it 
would be the realization of a long cherished goal of 
his. 
 
\"The goal has proved unrealistic after all.  He had no 
sooner announced his plan than the U.S. State 
Department issued a warning that made him back away. . 
 
\"Only the most nave will believe those denials.  The 
experts in the U.S. State Department certainly won\'t be 
fooled.  Washington have [sic] obviously seen through 
Chen.  In late October, Secretary of State Colin 
Powell, during a visit to Asia, said straightforwardly 
that `Taiwan is not independent. .\' 
 
\"The U.S. government\'s China policy used to be 
purposely fuzzy.  Powell\'s statement represented a 
clear departure from that long-time stand.  It is an 
indication that the U.S. government has grown tired of 
Chen\'s persistent pursuit of Taiwan independence, which 
has made the Taiwan Strait a trouble spot. 
 
\"The Chen administration will only suffer more 
humiliations if it continues to make aggressive efforts 
toward independence.\"

A) \"To Demonstrate Taiwan\'s Independent and Autonomous 
National Status Using Historical Facts and [Taiwan\'s ] 
Public Opinion\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" editorialized 
(12/3): 
 
\". [Secretary of State Colin] Powell said in late 
October that Taiwan is not a sovereign state.  The real 
meaning behind Powell\'s statement is that it has 
unveiled [the fact that] Taiwan\'s sovereignty issue was 
not thoroughly resolved after the end of the Second 
World War and that Taiwan is still wearing the coat of 
the Republic of China that is not recognized by the 
international community.  Today, Taiwan people have 
full control of their national sovereignty; they can 
elect their own state leader through the exercise of 
the people\'s free will; they possesses their own 
military, currency and judicial system.  All of these 
have all the more verified Taiwan\'s independent 
sovereign status.  We can say that the Taiwan people 
have used their actions to make up for the missing 
parts in history.  But the question for the future lies 
in: when will the United Nations and the international 
community really face the history and the hard facts 
and respect Taiwan people\'s basic rights under the UN 
Charter to establish their own country .?\" 
 
B) \"Restoring Credibility a Key Issue Facing President 
Chen\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" said in an editorial (12/3): 
 
\"The past week the people of Taiwan once again had a 
chance to see how unabashedly their leader President 
Chen Shui-bian uses a two-faced strategy to address his 
controversial policies, including his renewed tension 
with Washington.  But how successful such double- 
dealing is remains to be seen. . 
 
\"So Chen seemed to be playing a two-faced game.  On the 
one hand, he wanted to use the action of holding up the 
referendum bill to reassure Washington that he would 
not push for a popular vote to adopt a new Constitution 
during his term. 
 
\"But on the other hand, Chen himself would continue his 
referendum rhetoric ahead of the December 11 
legislative election to rally support for his party 
candidates.  And he believes that Washington will 
understand that his rhetoric was merely election 
language intended for the voters.  To ensure that will 
be the case, he even used the meeting with [Utah 
Governor Olene] Walker to call on Washington to trust 
him. . 
 
\"Therefore, the most urgent issue Chen might need to 
address is rebuilding his credibility severely 
undermined by his past fondness for saying different 
things to different people and his tendency to flip- 
flop on policy and position.  Unless this credibility 
gap can be overcome, it won\'t be easy for him to 
improve relations with either Washington or Beijing or 
the opposition even if he finally wins a legislative 
majority, which would greatly boost his authority and 
strengthen his hand in dealing with domestic and 
foreign issues.\"

SUBJECT: CROSS-STRAIT ENTRY PERMIT REFORMS STILL NOT ENOUGH 
 
REF: AIT TAIPEI 3605 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Taiwan\'s Executive Yuan (EY) recently announced a 
package of reforms that expands the range of firms that are 
permitted to apply for entry permits on behalf of their 
employees and loosens the restrictions on which employees 
qualify.  However, while the reforms extend the length of 
stay in Taiwan for some visitors, they reduce the maximum 
stay for others.  Moreover, the new system lowers the annual 
quotas further limiting the number of entry permits approved 
each year for some companies.  Most important, the new 
regulations do not address businesses\' concerns about heavy 
documentation requirements, the time required to process an 
application, and the lack of multiple-entry permits and work 
permits.  Taiwan needs further liberalization of entry 
requirements to facilitate cross-Strait trade and investment 
and take full advantage of the opportunities available to 
Taiwan businesses. These limited reforms will not suffice. 
(End summary.) 
 
2. (U) On November 17, Taiwan\'s Executive Yuan announced a 
new set of reforms for the system governing Taiwan entry 
permits for PRC employees of Taiwan and multinational firms 
for short-term travel.  Taiwan\'s purpose in reforming the 
system was to expand the range of firms and employees 
eligible for entry permits in order to enhance cross-Strait 
business in response to complaints by Taiwan and 
multinational firms with major operations in the Mainland. 
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) plans to implement the new 
rules in late December or early 2005. 
 
A Few Steps Forward 
------------------- 
 
3. (U) The new regulations slightly lower the financial 
requirements for Taiwan firms applying for entry permits on 
behalf of their employees.  Currently, only firms with more 
than NT$ 10 million in revenue and USD 300,000 worth of 
investment in the PRC may apply.  The revenue requirement 
will remain unchanged, but the new regulations do not require 
any particular level of investment in the PRC.  For branch 
offices of foreign firms in Taiwan, the current system 
permits only those firms that purchase USD 3 million worth of 
products in Taiwan to apply for entry permits.  The new 
regulations lower that requirement to USD one million and 
eliminate it for financial services firms. 
 
4. (U) The new system also allows firms to apply on behalf of 
a broader range of employees.  Under the current regulations, 
Taiwan will approve permits only for certain categories of 
employees who have been employed by the firm for at least 
three months.  The new system eliminates the minimum period 
of employment requirement.  It also makes some minor changes 
in the categories of employees who can qualify but still 
limits them to managers, technical personnel, and other 
specialists. 
 
And a Couple of Steps Back 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Although the Taiwan government has increased the 
length of time certain visitors are permitted to stay in 
Taiwan, for others the maximum stay has been reduced. 
Currently, visitors coming for training, to provide certain 
technical services, and to inspect purchased goods before 
shipment are limited to an initial stay of two months with 
the possibility of extension.  Those visitors will be 
approved for an initial stay of three months under the new 
regulations.  However, several other categories of visitors 
who are allowed a two-month visit under the current system 
will be limited to 14 days under the new one.  These include 
visitors coming for meetings, to give speeches, and to attend 
exhibitions. 
 
6. (U) Furthermore, the new regulations will reduce the 
annual quota of visitors for some firms.  Under the old 
system, Taiwan firms with NT$ 10 million to NT$ 30 million in 
annual sales were permitted to bring up to 30 visitors to 
Taiwan per year.  The new regulations will reduce the limit 
on approved visitors to 15 for those firms.  Firms with 
annual sales of more than NT$ 30 million will continue to be 
allowed up to 30 visitors per year. 
 
High, Perhaps Inflated Expectations 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) MAC predicts that the new reforms could increase the 
number of Mainland visitors coming to Taiwan for work-related 
travel to up to 140,000 per year.  This would mark an 
increase of nearly ten times current levels.  According to 
MAC, the predicted increase in numbers would primarily be due 
to the increase in the number of firms eligible to invite 
Mainland employees.  (Note: Reftel mistakenly reported that 
the total number of Mainland employees of Taiwan and 
multinational firms traveling to Taiwan for short-term 
business-related activities was about 1,800 in the first ten 
months of 2004.  The actual number is almost 16,000 according 
to MAC data.  Although significantly higher than previously 
reported, if correct, this number, is still only a very small 
fraction of the number of Taiwan businessmen traveling to the 
PRC every year.  By way of comparison, we estimate, based on 
Ministry of Transportation and Communications and airline 
data, that as many as 17,000 people fly between Taiwan and 
the PRC every day.  A substantial portion is made up of 
Taiwan businessmen.  End note.) 
 
Taiwan Losing Advantage 
----------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Roberto Guidetti, General Manager of Proctor and 
Gamble Taiwan, on November 30, called on the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) to liberalize the 
entry permit process further.  At a meeting between AmCham 
members and CEPD\'s chairman Hu Sheng-cheng where AIT/T was 
present, Guidetti said that Taiwan has a strong advantage in 
the greater China region as a location for personnel 
training.  He explained that because of high turnover of 
personnel on the Mainland due to firms offering ever-higher 
compensation packages, Taiwan has the most stable workforce 
in greater China.  This stability makes Taiwan the natural 
choice among Taiwan, Hong Kong and Shanghai for hosting 
Proctor and Gamble training sessions.  Without rapid further 
liberalization of entry requirements, however, Taiwan\'s 
advantage in this area will erode and more business 
opportunities will move to the Mainland. 
 
Comment ) Still Not Enough 
-------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Taiwan authorities have told AIT/T on several 
occasions that a significant reform of cross-Strait entry 
permits would become effective early next year.  This package 
is apparently what they had in mind, but it appears they have 
oversold the benefits and the potential impact of the new 
regulations.  They will do little to help multinational 
firms.  As reported reftel, various U.S. multinationals told 
AIT/T that the Taiwan government needs to reduce 
documentation requirements, shorten the time required to 
process an application, approve multiple-entry permits, and 
allow PRC employees on long-term assignment to obtain work 
permits.  The new regulations do not address any of these 
concerns.  The expansion of firms eligible to apply for entry 
permits, and employee eligibility represent minor fixes in a 
system with major problems.  Furthermore, the new regulations 
actually worsen some problems.  MAC\'s prediction of a 
possible tenfold increase in the number of visitors seems 
very unlikely.  MAC officials have told us that the Council 
of Labor Affairs continues to work on new regulations that 
will allow work permits for some of these long-term visitors. 
 Nevertheless, the Taiwan government needs to do much more to 
liberalize the system governing entry permits for Mainland 
visitors if it truly intends to facilitate cross-Strait trade 
and investment and take full advantage of the opportunities 
available to Taiwan businesses.  End comment.

Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal; Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Taiwan dreams of parlaying closer economic, 
political, and educational ties with India into an economic 
and even strategic counterweight to China\'s regional 
dominance.  India seeks Taiwan investment along with 
manufacturing and commercial expertise but rejects the idea 
of forming any sort of counterweight to China as &pure 
fantasy.8  Both sides\' expectations have proven overly 
optimistic as bilateral economic relations encounter 
frictions and restrictions.  Educational, scientific and 
technical exchanges remain fruitful.  End summary. 
 
A History of No Relations 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) India-Taipei Association (ITA) Director General Vijay 
Gokhale told AIT in a November 9 meeting that the relatively 
undeveloped state of relations between Taiwan and India was 
largely due to India\'s complicated and sensitive ties with 
the PRC.  India was among the first countries to formally 
recognize China in 1949.  Gokhale said that in spite of the 
1962 Sino-Indo War and China\'s \"covert and overt\" military 
assistance to Pakistan, India maintained a policy of 
non-recognition of the Republic of China (ROC) that resulted 
in almost total non-contact with Taiwan.  Throughout the Cold 
War years even low-level Taiwan officials were not issued 
visas to visit India. 
 
Economic Basis of India-Taiwan Relations 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) It was not until 1991 after the end of the Cold War 
and India\'s financial crisis that economic pragmatism began 
to play a more important role in India\'s foreign policy 
according to Gokhale.  He explained that economic factors 
such as the potential for trade and investment were the only 
reasons India finally ended its no-contact policy with 
Taiwan.  When India opened its unofficial representative 
office in Taiwan in 1995 total bilateral trade was only 
USD700 million.  By 2003 the bilateral trade volume had 
doubled to USD1.4 billion.  In spite of this growth, Taiwan\'s 
exports to India still only account for 0.6 percent of its 
total exports.  Likewise, Taiwan\'s imports from India are 
less than 0.6 percent of total imports.  Taiwan\'s total 
cumulative investment in India through 2002 was only about 
USD110 million (according to Indian sources) compared to 
USD1.1 billion Taiwan investment in the Philippines, USD4.3 
billion in Singapore, and USD100 billion in China (according 
to unofficial estimates).  In April 2002 a Taiwan airline 
began direct flights between Delhi and Taipei and in October 
2002 India and Taiwan signed an investment promotion and 
protection agreement. 
 
Economic Relations Have Limitations 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) India hopes Taiwan will invest in high-tech 
manufacturing operations in India instead of the current 
Taiwan practice of importing Indian engineers to work in 
Taiwan\'s science parks, universities, and research 
institutes.  Director General Gokhale said he believed the 
two economies are highly complementary but it would be more 
effective for Taiwan manufacturers to establish R&D centers 
in India rather than hiring Indians to work in Taiwan R&D 
centers.  Gokhale said that from his experiences in China he 
understood why Taiwan investors were reluctant to invest in 
India instead of China.  He thought India\'s economy was more 
restrictive than China\'s economy and had fewer incentives for 
foreign investors.  He also believed Taiwan investors had 
unrealistic expectations of preferential treatment from the 
Indian government, similar to the preferential treatment he 
thought they received in China.  Gokhale admitted that 
Taiwan\'s complaint to the WTO over India\'s excessive use of 
anti-dumping duties as a trade barrier was probably 
justified.  (Note: India has imposed anti-dumping duties on 
seven Taiwan products. Taiwan claims the duties are \"unjust\" 
and were imposed without any investigation.  Taiwan has 
requested formal consultations with India under WTO dispute 
resolution procedures.  End note.)  Gokhale noted that Taiwan 
restrictions on Indian fruit, chemicals, and bulk 
pharmaceuticals were also unfair trade barriers. 
 
Rising China No Threat? 
---------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Director General Gokhale said that while India did 
not view China\'s rise as a threat, its relations with China 
were still (since the 1962 war) a very sensitive issue in 
India\'s domestic politics.  Chinese companies were not 
permitted to work on construction of airports, ports, 
telecommunications, or road projects because of the strategic 
implications of having a rival power build India\'s 
infrastructure.  India hesitated to sign a tax agreement with 
Taiwan to eliminate double taxation on Taiwan investors 
because such an agreement would need parliamentary approval. 
The Indian government feared that opposition parties in 
parliament could use an agreement with Taiwan to claim the 
government was jeopardizing hard-won rapprochement with 
China.  Gokhale expected that within a few years greater 
China (i.e., Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mainland China) would 
overtake the U.S. in importance as a trade partner to India 
and become the dominate economy in east Asia. 
 
Strategic Relations Just a Fantasy 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) ITA Director General Gokhale told AIT that Taiwan 
officials were \"living in fantasy\" with their inflated 
expectations for India-Taiwan relations serving as a 
counterweight to the pull of China.  He said India had no 
interest in relations with Taiwan outside of the economic 
sphere.  India had repeatedly refused Taiwan\'s requests to 
permit its Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs to visit India. 
India had flatly rejected Taiwan\'s inquiries about a Free 
Trade Agreement saying it was \"simply not going to happen,\" 
and &far beyond the realm of the possible.8 
 
Taiwan Still Dreams of a Deeper Relationship 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Oblivious to India\'s open and adamant rejection of 
political ties, some Taiwan officials still believe they can 
use economic ties to develop a political or strategic 
relationship with New Delhi.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Section Chief in the Department of East Asian and Pacific 
Affairs Ben Chen told AIT that Taiwan\'s strategy is to push 
the economic relationship and then the political ties will 
come naturally.  Chen said Taipei is also focusing on 
cultural and educational exchanges to give Indians a better 
understanding of Taiwan.  Chen added that he believes New 
Delhi is reaching out to Taiwan to counterbalance the PRC. 
He asserted the PRC is promoting relations with India\'s 
neighbors so New Delhi is doing the same thing to Beijing. 
Taiwan\'s Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh in May 2004 
spoke of the need to reduce dependence on the PRC by 
increasing investment in Eastern Europe and India.  Taiwan\'s 
Board of Foreign Trade has repeatedly urged manufacturers to 
develop markets in India as part of its efforts to diversity 
Taiwan\'s export markets away from the PRC. 
 
Common Democratic Values or Common Fear of China? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
8.  (C) In mid-November 2004, Taiwan Thinktank (a think tank 
closely associated with former Taiwan President Lee 
Teng-Hui\'s pro-Taiwan independence policies) sponsored a 
seminar entitled &Taiwan-India-Japan Democratic Values, 
Cooperation, and Prospects.8  Taiwan President Chen 
Shui-bian received the Indian delegation.  In his remarks at 
the seminar, the Indian delegation head former Defense 
Minister George Fernandes (known, according to Gokhale, for 
his views that China poses a threat to India), called for 
closer economic and security cooperation between Japan, 
India, and Taiwan.  Taiwan Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged closer 
cooperation based on shared values in freedom, democracy, 
human rights protection, and economic prosperity.  Yu also 
mentioned that Taiwan fully supports Japan\'s and India\'s bid 
to become permanent members of the United Nations Security 
Council.  Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih said in his 
opening remarks that by forging partnerships with Japan and 
India Taiwan can break the Beijing-imposed diplomatic embargo 
and gradually form alliances with even more Asian 
democracies. 
 
High-Level Contacts, Unrealized Hopes 
------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) India now permits high-level Taiwan economic 
officials to travel to India and sends high-level economic 
and science officials to Taiwan.  Taiwan Vice Minister of 
Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming has visited India twice this 
year.  In mid-November Yiin led a trade and investment 
mission of 30 executives from Taiwan telecommunications, 
electronics and trading firms to Bombay and New Delhi. In 
March 2004 an Indian Vice Minister for Science and Technology 
visited Taiwan.  During the visit the two sides agreed to 
conduct at least two science and technology seminars each 
year.  Taiwan\'s National Science Council (NSC) plans to 
establish a separate India office to handle science and 
technology cooperation with India.  NSC Section Chief Fu 
Hsien-da told AIT that Taiwan has established numerous other 
channels for technology exchange with India including a 
Taiwan-India Forum, a Science and Technology Advisory Group, 
educational exchanges, and think tanks.  India had been 
assisting Taiwan to develop space technology but abruptly 
shut down the program according to the NSC.  NSC Section 
Chief Fu thought India pulled back in response to PRC 
complaints. 
 
Indian Engineers Contribute to Taiwan\'s Technology 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
10.  (C) Each year the NSC invites about 200 Indian 
post-doctoral researchers and guest scholars to Taiwan. 
There are currently some 500 Indian post-doctoral researchers 
at Taiwan universities.  Although Taiwan\'s Hsin Chu Science 
Park officially employs only 70 Indian engineers it holds an 
annual Indian culture festival for the many Indian 
expatriates employed in the park.  Taiwan\'s Institute for 
Information Industry (III) signed a strategic alliance 
memorandum in February 2004 with India\'s Software Industry 
Association to jointly develop software.  III Manager Tsai 
Mei-ching told AIT that Taiwan information industry 
executives regularly travel to India to discuss opportunities 
for technical cooperation and exchange.  Acer and BenQ are 
among Taiwan\'s leading companies that have established 
offices in India as windows for technical exchange.  Taiwan\'s 
largest distributor of IT products Synnex Technology 
International announced on November 18 that it will invest 
USD24 million for a 36 percent stake in Redington Group, the 
second largest distributor of IT products in India.  However, 
Synnex Vice President Lee Li-sheng told AIT his company has 
no plans to conduct manufacturing in India. 
 
11.  (C) Comment: Taiwan companies can offer India not only 
access to cutting edge manufacturing technology in key 
information industries but also precious investment capital. 
However India clearly has no intention of risking its 
delicate relations with China over political ties with 
Taiwan, and even the trade and investment relation between 
Taiwan and India has serious frictions.  Taiwan hears what it 
likes in statements of Indian nationalists like Fernandes who 
advocate a bilateral strategic alliance but this view is 
adamantly rejected by Indian officials. The future of 
Indian-Taiwan relations will likely be determined by two 
factors: will Taiwan and India\'s high-tech companies be able 
to find ways to cooperate based on their complementary 
strengths in hardware and software; will Taiwan be able to 
build on substantial linkages with India and restrain its 
desire for symbolic gestures that could cause India to pull 
back.

1. (C) Summary: With a total of six open seats, Hsinchu city 
(three seats) and Hsinchu county (three seats) are two 
northern districts where the battle between Pan-Green and 
Pan-Blue forces for control of the Legislative Yuan (LY) 
could be determined.  The Pan-Blue, which currently holds a 
two-to-one seat advantage in both districts, appears likely 
to maintain its margin in Hsinchu city but is in danger of 
losing one seat in Hsinchu county.  The Democratic 
Progressive Party\'s (DPP) strategic nomination of two 
candidates in the county, while a calculated gamble, could 
yield a handsome pay-off.  The Kuomintang (KMT), blackmailed 
by its own grass-roots members, was forced to put forward a 
second KMT candidate in the northern part of the county as a 
response to the DPP\'s aggressive strategy.  The KMT\'s second 
nomination, however, has diluted Pan-Blue support for the 
People First Party\'s (PFP) only candidate, a newcomer, and 
presented the DPP with the chance to capture two out of the 
three seats in a traditionally strong, but now divided, 
Pan-Blue district.  End Summary. 
 
Straightforward Race in Hsinchu City 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) A separate administrative and legislative election 
district from its sister county, Hsinchu city has a 
population of 402,000 that is a mixture of traditional, 
low-skilled workers and high-skilled techies.  In past 
elections the city has leaned Pan-Blue, giving the KMT and 
the PFP one seat each in the 2001 legislative election and 55 
percent of the vote to the Lien-Soong ticket in the 2004 
presidential race.  Various polls show continuing strong 
support for KMT and PFP candidates that, coupled with fierce 
infighting within the Pan-Green camp for the Green vote, 
suggests the Pan-Blue is likely to retain its two seats in 
the city. 
 
3. (C) The KMT and PFP took a conservative nomination 
strategy in Hsinchu city, putting forward one candidate each, 
and so far KMT \"maverick\" Cheng Cheng-ling has not been able 
to siphon off enough votes to matter.   DPP Hsinchu City 
Chairman Cheng Hong-hui said Ko Chun-hsiung, the KMT nominee, 
would be facing some pressure from the renegade Cheng, who 
has the backing of Chang Tsai-mei, the KMT\'s current 
legislator embittered with the party for not renominating 
her.  Despite help from Chang, Cheng Cheng-ling remains very 
low in the polls and appears unable to unseat Ko who, as a 
former \"patriotic\" (aiguo) movie star, has enough support 
from military families and ethnic Hakka to get a seat, 
conceded the DPP\'s city Chairman.  KMT Hsinchu City Chairman 
Chang I-hua also expressed high confidence that Ko 
Chun-hsiung will prevail.  PFP Vice Chairwoman Chung Shu-ying 
said her party believes its candidate, the incumbent Lu 
Hsueh-chang, will get enough of the large Hakka and high-tech 
vote in the city to secure a seat. 
 
4. (C) The DPP decided to play it safe in Hsinchu city to 
preserve the seat of its representative and head of the DPP 
caucus in the LY, Ker Chia-ming.  According to Cheng 
Hong-hui, the DPP is optimistic of a victory, but also feels 
a sense of \"minor crisis\" as the Taiwan Solidary Union\'s 
(TSU) candidate Holmes Liao (Cheng-hsiang) is fourth in the 
polls and drawing votes away from Ker.  Ker was the largest 
vote-getter in the city in 2001 and Cheng said some Greens 
may be self-initiating an uncoordinated \"vote distribution\" 
(peipiao) to the TSU candidate. The KMT\'s Chang I-hua said 
they are seeing Ker campaign especially hard this year, but 
also agreed he was likely to retain his seat. 
 
The Gloves are Off In Hsinchu County 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) With a population of 460,000 and with two out of three 
LY seats held by the Pan-Blue camp, Hsinchu County is 
normally considered safe Blue territory.  In the 2001 LY 
election the four major parties each nominated one candidate 
and the Pan-Blue won two seats while only the DPP candidate 
was elected from the Pan-Green.  In the 2004 presidential 
election, the Lien-Soong ticket received 64 percent of the 
county vote versus 36 for the Chen-Lu ticket.  However, this 
year the Pan-Blue may have over-extended by nominating three 
candidates, two of whom are newcomers, giving the DPP\'s two 
nominees a good chance of being elected.  The TSU has no 
candidates running in the county this year. 
 
6. (C) The DPP has decided to forsake the status quo in 
Hsinchu County and taken a very aggressive, even outright 
risky, nomination strategy to reverse the two-to-one Pan-Blue 
advantage.  According to DPP Hsinchu County Chairman Chen 
Wen-hung, the DPP nominated one more candidate in the county 
than it did in 2001 when the DPP learned that current PFP 
legislator and former county magistrate Chen Chin-hsing was 
not running for reelection.  The DPP is betting, said Chen, 
that with the PFP incumbent out of the race it could put 
forward a second candidate, Lin Wei-chou,  who has a 
powerbase north of the Tou-chien river without threatening 
the support for its current incumbent, Chang Hsueh-shun, who 
has strong support south of the river.  In the clan and 
regional interest-driven politics of Hsinchu county, the 
DPP\'s strategy has a good chance of working.  Chen said 
Chang, a Hakka, is vying for the Hakka vote (Hakkas comprise 
70 percent of the county\'s population) with the other 
Pan-Blue candidates, while Lin, as the only ethnic Taiwanese 
in the race, is capturing a large part of the ethnic 
Taiwanese vote.  Chen admitted, nevertheless, there is a 
small chance both DPP candidates could spread the Green vote 
too thinly and lose, but said his party was willing to \"take 
the risk.\" 
 
KMT: Forced to Respond 
---------------------- 
 
7. (C) The DPP\'s second nomination was \"masterful,\" according 
Jiang Li-chung, special assistant to the KMT Hsinchu County 
magistrate, and prompted much consternation within the KMT 
party establishment north of the Tou-chien river.  KMT caucus 
whip for Hsinchu county Yeh Tsang-tsung said that he and his 
party members in the north were willing to support the DPP\'s 
Lin Wei-chou, who is a fellow native of Chu-bei city, if the 
KMT did not put forward its own candidate in the north.  With 
both the incumbent KMT candidate Chiu Ching-chun and PFP 
newcomer Chen Chi-hui coming from south of the river, the 
northerners believed the KMT was doing nothing to represent 
their local interests, said Yeh.  As a result, a delegation 
of party members with interests north of the river went to 
KMT party headquarters and lobbied for one of their own, 
current Chu-bei city mayor Yeh Fang-hsiung, to be placed on 
the ballot.  Yeh Fang-hsiung\'s nomination in the north places 
him in direct competition with the DPP\'s Lin Wei-chou, but is 
also drawing away northern Pan-Blue votes that could have 
gone to Chen Chi-hui, said the DPP\'s Chen Wen-hong.  With KMT 
incumbent Chiu Ching-chun\'s strong lead in the polls, a 
well-coordinated vote distribution (peipiao) to suport Yeh 
could allow the Pan-Blue to hold its two-to-one seat 
advantage, but come at a the expense of the PFP. 
 
 
PFP: Left Holding the Bag 
------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The PFP appears to have precipitated the DPP\'s 
offensive and, in turn the Pan-Blue \"crisis,\" in Hsinchu 
county when it decided to put forward a newcomer and local 
school principal Chen Chi-hui instead of running its veteran, 
popular legislator Chen Chin-hsing again.  Chen Chin-hsing 
said he bowed out because of his advanced age (71 years old) 
and the need for the PFP to get some \"new blood\" in the LY. 
Chen Chi-hui\'s center of support resides in the south and 
competes with the KMT incumbent\'s power-base there, making it 
unlikely that the Pan-Blue will be able to overcome candidate 
resistance to vote distribution (peipiao) across party lines. 
  The DPP\'s Chen Wen-hong said that the PFP candidate may be 
making some gains and in DPP internal party polls has moved 
into fourth position, but even if the KMT is able to 
effectively distribute votes it is more likely than not going 
to help it\'s own.  As the election approaches, the PFP 
appears increasingly poised to lose yet another seat in a 
Blue stronghold. 
 
Comment: Can the Blues Hold Their Own? 
-------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The race in the two traditionally Blue strongholds of 
Hsinchu will be another key test of whether the Pan-Blue 
coalition can hold on to its advantage in the face of a very 
aggressive DPP nomination strategy.  Although conservative 
nominations by all parties in the city are likely to allow 
the Pan-Blue to lock in its two-to-one seat margin, dynamics 
in the county race has upped the ante for the Pan-Blues.  The 
DPP\'s two nominations have disrupted the \"status quo\" and in 
effect placed the county election outcome in the KMT\'s hands. 
 With the KMT\'s apparently poor ability to coordinate vote 
distribution (peipiao) between its candidates and across 
Pan-Blue party lines in other parts of the island, the KMT 
county establishment will need to prove itself the exception 
if it hopes to prevent a small DPP victory in a heavy 
Pan-Blue district.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Direct air transportation is the last area where the 
\"three-links\" have not been realized in either name or 
substance.  Direct air links would cut passenger travel time 
by up to an hour and a half; ticket prices by more than 25 
percent; and airfreight costs by 20 percent or more. 
Taiwan\'s high-tech industries would benefit from reduced air 
transportation costs that would likely increase cross-Strait 
trade.  Less expensive cross-Strait air transportation could 
also dampen the rate of increase in the flow of investment 
from Taiwan to the PRC.  Taiwan airlines have already 
developed connection arrangements akin to code-shares with 
PRC airlines in order to compete with Hong Kong and Macau 
carriers across the Strait.  However, Taiwan carriers are 
also ready to compete with PRC firms on direct cross-Strait 
routes.  U.S. passenger airlines are not interested in 
providing cross-Strait service, but some U.S. air cargo 
firms, are concerned that if direct air links were to be 
established, foreign firms would be excluded from the new 
routes.  Direct air links would contribute to growth on both 
sides of the Strait, but politics continue to get in the way. 
 End Summary. 
 
2. (U) When originally proposed in 1979, the \"three-links\" to 
be established between Taiwan and the PRC consisted of direct 
postal and telecommunications services, cross-Strait 
commerce, and direct transportation.  The first two links 
have been effectively realized.  Over one million pieces of 
mail and about 50 million phone calls cross the Taiwan Strait 
every month.  The PRC accounted for 70 percent of Taiwan\'s 
outward investment and 25 percent of its exports in the first 
half of this year and has been Taiwan\'s largest trade partner 
for two years.  In transportation, various methods of 
cross-Strait sea freight have emerged to keep costs low 
despite the absence of full direct shipping (reported ref B). 
 The last and missing link is air transportation. 
 
Passenger Aviation ) Inconvenient and Expensive 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (U) Most cross-Strait air travelers pass through Hong Kong 
and Macau, but airlines have also tapped other airports to 
handle cross-Strait air traffic.  Every week there are 444 
scheduled flights between Taiwan and Hong Kong (counting both 
outbound and inbound).  There are 336 scheduled flights 
between Taiwan and Macau.  Some cross-Strait traffic also 
passes through Okinawa, Japan, and Cheju, South Korea, with 
28 and 7 scheduled weekly flights.  According to Ministry of 
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) statistics, more 
than 617,000 passengers flew between Taiwan and Hong Kong in 
September 2004, 195,000 between Taiwan and Macau.  About 
15,000 passengers flew between Taiwan and Okinawa.  MOTC did 
not release data for Cheju.  Most passengers flying to Hong 
Kong and Macau proceed on to airports in the PRC.  Eva Air 
(EVA) currently estimates that 60 percent of Hong Kong 
passengers and 80 percent of Macau passengers continue onward 
to airports in the PRC.  The percentage of travelers to 
Okinawa and Cheju who are ultimately bound for PRC airports 
is probably even higher. 
 
4. (C) Air travel on the popular route between Taipei and 
Shanghai generally costs between NT$ 14,000 and NT$ 18,000 
(USD 435 to USD 560) for a round trip ticket.  Far Eastern 
and China Eastern Airlines offers a much cheaper fare through 
Cheju of about NT$ 10,000 (about USD 310), but that fare is 
the exception.  It is difficult to estimate precisely how 
much cheaper the fares would be on direct flights.  Joseph 
Lee, Manager of the International Affairs Department at Eva 
Air, told AIT/T that direct air links would probably cut NT$ 
5,000 to NT$ 7,000 (USD 155 to USD 215) from the total cost 
of a Taipei-Shanghai round trip ticket, or somewhere between 
25 and 50 percent of the total ticket price.  Total travel 
time is generally about five and a half hours.  Airlines 
agree that direct flights would cut about one and a half 
hours off the total travel time. 
Air Cargo ) Important Factor in Cross-Strait Trade 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
5. (C) A high volume of air cargo crosses the Taiwan Strait, 
playing an important role in cross-Strait economic trade.  In 
addition to cargo carried on passenger flights, Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, and Macau airlines conduct a total of 86 weekly all 
cargo flights between Taiwan and Hong Kong or Macau.  In 
2003, Taiwan exported 94,000 MT of goods to Mainland China by 
air via Hong Kong and Macau.  During the same period it 
imported 66,000 MT from the Mainland by air.  EVA estimates 
that 35 percent of air cargo shipped to Hong Kong and 30 
percent of cargo shipped to Macau is ultimately bound for the 
PRC. 
 
6. (C) The impact direct flights would have on the cost of 
cross-Strait air cargo varies by the type of service. 
Door-to-door express delivery services offered by firms like 
Federal Express, DHL and UPS differ in cost structure from 
services offered by freight forwarding firms or smaller 
courier services.  Nick Chen, Director of Operations for DHL 
Taiwan, estimated that direct flights would cut the cost of 
DHL\'s cross-Strait express delivery service by approximately 
20 percent.  The savings on air cargo arranged by freight 
forwarders that do not generally provide door-to-door service 
would be higher. 
 
Impact ) More Trade, Possibly Less Investment 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7. (U) Lower air transportation costs from direct aviation 
links would stimulate cross-Strait trade, particularly for 
Taiwan\'s high-tech industries.  MOTC statistics show that 
Taiwan\'s electronic goods manufacturers rely heavily on air 
transportation.  According to the most recent data, 
approximately 15 percent by weight of Taiwan\'s electronics 
exports to Mainland China are shipped by air.  Electronics 
goods accounted for almost 58 percent by weight of Taiwan 
exports shipped to Mainland China by air and about 44 percent 
of imports. 
 
8. (C) Less expensive, more efficient cross-Strait 
transportation might also mitigate the rate at which Taiwan 
investment in the PRC is increasing.  If it\'s cheaper and 
easier to move goods from Taiwan to China, there may be less 
economic pressure to move manufacturing operations to the 
Mainland.  Jason Chen, Deputy Spokesman for Taiwan laptop 
computer manufacturer Quanta, told AIT/T that Quanta could 
assemble its laptops in either Taiwan or the Mainland, but 
felt forced to move its manufacturing facilities to the PRC 
because most of its suppliers had already moved.  Inexpensive 
and reliable air cargo transportation would increase the 
incentive for Taiwan firms to maintain the manufacture of 
capital and technology-intensive components in Taiwan, 
regardless of the location of input manufacturers or final 
assembly facilities.  Overall, Taiwan firms will continue 
investing heavily in the Mainland regardless of the status of 
aviation links.  However, the flow may be slightly slower 
with direct air transportation. 
 
9. (U) Reduced air transportation costs would also benefit 
Taiwan firms that already have invested in the Mainland. 
Lower airfares would cut costs for managers that live in 
Taiwan and fly to the Mainland regularly to oversee 
investments.  Some managers, who currently reside in the 
Mainland due to the inconvenience and high cost of air 
transportation, might even decide to return to Taiwan as 
their base of operations.  Similarly, multinational firms 
considering abandoning Taiwan as their headquarters for 
greater China or East Asia would be more inclined to continue 
managing regional operations from Taiwan. 
 
Impact ) Airline Industry Competition and Exclusion 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
10. (U) Taiwan airlines have already taken measures to help 
them compete with Hong Kong and Macau airlines, which can 
offer service across the Strait and onward connections to PRC 
destinations.  China Airlines (CAL), EVA, Far Eastern Air 
Transport (FAT) and Trans Asia all have representative 
offices in Shanghai and Beijing.  EVA also has offices in 
Guangzhou and Xiamen.  Many carriers also have cooperative 
agreements with PRC airlines that function like code-shares 
in everything but name.  CAL flights into Okinawa connect to 
China Eastern Airlines flights to Shanghai.  FAT has a 
similar arrangement with China Eastern for its flights into 
Cheju.  EVA partners with Shanghai Airlines.  Taiwan airlines 
are able to sell tickets on the PRC legs of these connections 
to their customers in Taiwan and their PRC partners sell 
tickets on flights into Taiwan to Mainland customers. 
However, Taiwan law prohibits Taiwan airlines from entering 
into code-share agreements with PRC airlines, so these 
arrangements are not identified as code shares. 
 
11. (C) If direct air links are implemented, Taiwan carriers 
will have to compete with PRC airlines on the lucrative new 
cross-Strait routes.  Taiwan and PRC authorities will tightly 
control the routes.  EVA\'s Lee speculated that the Taiwan and 
PRC would initially open only four PRC airports for Taiwan 
flights -) Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Xiamen.  The 
number of airlines permitted to fly each route would also be 
strictly limited.  PRC airlines may benefit from lower labor 
costs for most operations, but as CAL\'s General Manager for 
Strategic Planning Frank Mao pointed out to AIT/T, many of 
the costs that airlines face )- fuel, equipment, and landing 
fees )- are the same for all airlines.  EVA\'s Lee told AIT 
that although cross-Strait routes might reduce the airline\'s 
profit margins, they would substantially increase the revenue 
base.  Both CAL and EVA are confident of their ability to 
compete with PRC airlines on cross-Strait routes.  They 
expect to benefit from Taiwan investors in the PRC who would 
prefer to fly Taiwan carriers for better service or due to 
brand loyalty. 
 
12. (U) The establishment of direct aviation links will 
require negotiation and compromise on the classification of 
cross-Strait routes that will impact non-PRC and non-Taiwan 
carriers.  The PRC government will insist that cross-Strait 
routes are domestic ones, while Taiwan will seek to have them 
classified as international routes.  The most likely outcome 
is a special \"cross-Strait\" classification or no 
classification at all.  The Hong Kong-Taiwan Aviation 
Agreement (as reported ref A) does not identify Hong 
Kong-Taiwan routes as either domestic, international, or 
otherwise.  However, only Taiwan and Hong Kong carriers are 
permitted to conduct flights.  A similar structure for 
Taiwan-PRC direct air links would exclude U.S. and other 
foreign carriers. 
 
13. (C) U.S. passenger airlines are not particularly 
interested in offering cross-Strait service.  U.S. airlines 
service to Taiwan has generally declined over the years. 
Delta stopped service to Taiwan nine years ago.  Northwest 
eliminated Taipei-Tokyo service on November 1 and now only 
offers Taipei-Osaka flights.  United Airlines Taiwan General 
Manager Andrea Wu told AIT/T that United would not be 
interested in conducting PRC-Taiwan flights, but would be 
interested in taking advantage of direct flights on other 
carriers to offer better service for United passengers on a 
\"triangular route.\"  She explained that a significant number 
of United U.S. passengers traveling to Taiwan want to stop in 
the PRC on the same trip.  The typical pattern is a San 
Francisco-Shanghai-Taipei-San Francisco trip for business 
travelers from Silicon Valley visiting greater China\'s 
technology centers. 
 
14. (C) U.S. cargo carriers would be more concerned about 
exclusion from cross-Strait routes.  A firm like DHL that 
primarily transports cargo on planes owned by other firms 
would not be disadvantaged by a cross-Strait direct air link 
agreement that excludes foreign carriers.  However, FedEx, 
which maintains its own fleet of aircraft, would be 
negatively affected.  Scott Williams, Taiwan Managing 
Director for FedEx Express, told AIT/T that the impact of 
such an agreement on FedEx\'s Taiwan operations would be 
\"huge.\"  FedEx would be forced to use other carriers for 
cross-Strait traffic in order to compete, a strategy FedEx 
generally only employs when its own capacity is inadequate to 
meet demand. 
 
Comment ) Politics in the Way of Growth 
--------------------------------------- 
 
15. (C) Taiwan and the PRC have gradually liberalized 
cross-Strait economic relations in recent years, increasing 
their economic integration.  Establishing direct air links is 
the single most important step that the two sides could take 
to facilitate further cross-Strait commerce.  More trade and 
more efficient investment due to direct air transportation 
would contribute to growth in both the Mainland and Taiwan. 
However, domestic politics in Taiwan and the PRC still stand 
in the way.  The political environment after Taiwan\'s 
December 11 Legislative Yuan elections on both sides of the 
Strait will determine the potential for progress toward 
direct air links.  End comment.

SUBJECT: CHEN PLANNING NEW STRATEGY FOR UN BID 
 
REF: TAIPEI 3604 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal; Reasons: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Foreign Minister Mark Chen told the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) that he was surprised by President 
Chen Shui-bian\'s recent announcement that Taipei plans to 
apply for UN membership under the name \"Taiwan\" instead of 
the \"Republic of China\" (ROC) in 2005.  Officials claim that 
the policy debate is being driven by frustration over the 
failure of the existing approach rather than a desire to 
provoke Beijing.  Taiwan officials say that the Foreign 
Ministry is opposed to the proposal, that there has been no 
interagency coordination on the issue, and that the 
Legislative Yuan (LY) passed a law in 1991 stipulating that 
Taipei apply under the \"ROC\" title.  While MOFA officials 
claim that they will consult with Washington before any 
decision is made over the nomenclature issue, that process 
will likely have little impact.  Strong public and private 
cautions by the U.S. may be the only way to deter President 
Chen from his initiative.  End summary. 
 
Announce First, Coordinate Later 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Taiwan MOFA officials tell AIT that President\'s Chen\'s 
November 14 assertion during a campaign rally in Tainan that 
Taipei will apply for UN membership under the title \"Taiwan\" 
(Reftel) does not yet represent a formal change in policy. 
Victor Chin, Director General of North American Affairs at 
MOFA told AIT Deputy Director December 2 that on Monday, 
November 29, Foreign Minster Mark Chen informed MOFA office 
directors and other senior staff at a regularly scheduled 
meeting that the President had not consulted with him before 
he made his November 25 announcement on the campaign trail 
that Taiwan should seek to apply to the United Nations under 
the name \"Taiwan.\" Minister Chen opened the floor for 
discussion, and all of the professional diplomatic staff 
strongly opposed the idea. 
 
Act of Frustration 
------------------ 
 
3. (C) When pressed on the motives for changing Taipei\'s UN 
strategy, officials universally cite frustration over the 
failure of previous attempts in the face of PRC pressure. 
MOFA\'s Deputy Director General for International 
Organizations Jieh Wen-chi maintained that there is growing 
sentiment in Taiwan that the 23 million people in Taiwan have 
been denied representation in the UN, a violation of the UN\'s 
principle of universality.  Jieh added that the annual UN bid 
forms a cornerstone of Taipei\'s foreign \"political\" strategy. 
 Jieh said that Taipei has tried to be reasonable in the 
past.  However, with no prospects for better treatment in the 
future, Jieh said Taiwan must raise the stakes, take some 
risks, and make a bid that is more distinguishable. 
According to Jieh, the new name could force both Taiwan\'s 
diplomatic partners and other nations to clarify their 
positions on Taiwan\'s status. 
 
If Not \"Two China\'s,\" then \"One China, One Taiwan\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (C) Former NSC Deputy Secretary General, Antonio Chiang, 
echoed Jieh\'s sentiment.  He told AIT that Taipei has been 
forced to choose \"Taiwan\" as its name because the PRC 
continues to reject the \"ROC\" in international fora.  Chiang 
asserted that Beijing\'s opposition to the \"ROC\" name in the 
UN and other venues is fueling the Taiwan identity movement 
and undermining the Chen administration\'s attempts to 
maintain the \"ROC\" status quo.  Chiang asserted that if 
Beijing really wanted to encourage Taiwanese to reject 
independence and keep open the possibility for eventual 
integration, it would agree to some form of divided 
sovereignty along the \"Two Germanies/Two Koreas\" model. 
 
Proposal will be Coordinated 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (C)  MOFA\'s Jieh told AIT that a proposal to change the 
nomenclature for Taipei\'s UN bid would need to go through an 
established interagency policy review process.  Jieh asserted 
that such a plan would also likely require approval by the 
LY, which in 1991 passed a resolution that authorized Taiwan 
to seek UN membership under the name of \"ROC.\" Jieh 
acknowledged, however, that the UN initiative is currently 
under active consideration inside the Foreign Ministry.  Jieh 
said that the ministry has planned a series of strategy 
meetings in early 2005 that will address the legal, 
diplomatic, cross-Strait, political, and other aspects of 
changing Taiwan\'s UN nomenclature.  Jieh assured AIT that the 
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will also have input in this 
process.  Jieh said that the MAC will be commissioned to do a 
study on the impact of using \"Taiwan\" instead of the \"ROC\" on 
cross-Strait stability.  Jieh also stated that the strategy 
group would consider the potential domestic political 
implications of dropping the \"ROC\" in favor of \"Taiwan\" for 
the UN bid. 
 
USG Views Key 
------------- 
 
6. (C) Jieh emphasized that Taipei plans also to seek USG 
input into the initiative before making any formal decisions. 
 (Note: President Chen did not repeat the UN formulation in 
his December 5 DPP press conference, Septel.  End note). 
Jieh assured AIT that this strategy was not meant to move 
towards independence.  If the plan were adopted, Jieh 
asserted that Taipei would make clear caveats on this point. 
(Note: When Chen first raised the topic at a September press 
teleconference with New York-based journalists, he asserted 
that Taiwan\'s bid would be within a \"divided sovereignty\" 
framework akin to that used for the two Koreas and Germanies. 
 End note).  Jieh said that USG views would be the most 
important consideration in upcoming discussions and invited 
AIT to offer likely USG reactions to the plan. 
 
Will Politics Override MOFA? 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) It is probable, however, that politics will accelerate 
consideration of Chen\'s UN initiative faster than MOFA might 
like.  When Minister Chen told senior MOFA officials of the 
President\'s uncoordinated initiative, only Yang Huang 
Mei-hsin, a political appointee from the President\'s 
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) defended the idea.  She 
argued that previous efforts to seek international support 
for Taiwan\'s right to be represented at the UN had failed, 
and its efforts to enter other international organizations 
had also failed.  She attributed this failure to the 
continued acceptance of the name \"ROC.\" She urged that Taiwan 
needed to take a bold step in a new direction.  Using a new 
name would give the campaign new energy and momentum. 
Director General Chin observed that there is sometimes a 
value to novel approaches, but not when they risk the 
destruction of the nation and when there is no possibility of 
a safe withdrawal. 
 
8. (C) Yang, like Minister Chen, comes from the more 
fundamentalist pro-independence wing of the DPP.  Over the 
past several months she has successfully urged the Minister 
to support the increased use of \"Taiwan\" rather than \"ROC\" in 
Taiwan\'s international activities despite the objections of 
MOFA professional diplomats.  Both Yang and Minister Chen 
have had close relations with Vice-President Annette Lu 
(Hsu-lien), who has also been among the most passionate DPP 
fundamentalists. 
 
9. (C) Other MOFA office directors countered that an approach 
such as the President proposed would be highly provocative. 
It would require Taiwan to present a formal diplomatic 
communication to the UN Secretary General announcing that 
Taiwan is country, with the formal tittle of \"Taiwan\" or 
\"Republic of Taiwan\" and was therefore qualified to be a 
member of the UN.  These directors argued, according to Chin, 
that many of Taiwan\'s formal diplomatic partners as well as 
the U.S. would all strongly oppose this step.  Rather than 
increase international support, such an initiative would 
further diminish Taiwan\'s already limited international 
backing.  In addition, this step would clearly constitute a 
declaration of independence and cross the most important PRC 
redline.  As such it would isolate Taiwan and expose it to 
PRC attack, probably without U.S. military assistance. 
10. (C) Chin said that the Minister was clearly taken aback 
by the strong response of his staff to the President\'s 
proposal.  He instructed the International Organizations 
Department to prepare a summary of the Ministry\'s position 
and promised that he would convey this position to the 
President. 
 
Comment: How to Stop a Tram Wreck 
--------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Given Mark Chen\'s long history as a supporter of 
Taiwan independence, given also his reliance in recent months 
on the counsel of DPP political appointee Yang Huang 
Mei-hsin, it is far from certain that he will in fact urge 
the President to accept the cautions of the MOFA professional 
diplomats.  Even if he does, President Chen has made it very 
clear that he does not place a high value on MOFA\'s advice, 
particularly when it would deter him from some new 
initiative.  Once again, it may require that the U.S. use 
coordinated private and public statements to make clear 
objections to what Beijing is likely to view as unilateral 
violations of the cross-Strait status quo by Taiwan.

1. (C) Summary: President Chen Shui-bian pledged to change 
the name of Taiwan\'s overseas offices and State Owned 
Enterprises from \"China\" to \"Taiwan\" by 2006 during a 
December 5 press conference at Democratic Progressive Party 
(DPP) headquarters.  In the same speech, Chen reiterated his 
intention to abide by his 2000 and 2004 inaugural commitments 
regarding constitutional reform.  He stated that Taiwan needs 
a constitutional reform plan that will improve governance and 
meet Taiwan\'s current needs rather than a \"debate over 
ideology or verbal slogans.\"  Chen\'s remarks came just hours 
before the start of a large \"name rectification\" (zhengming) 
rally organized by supporters of former President Lee 
Teng-hui.  Chen\'s aides say the president\'s December 5 
remarks were meant to defend the DPP\'s left flank from Lee\'s 
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) in a way that would not be 
perceived as provocative by Washington or Beijing. 
Nevertheless, local media widely portrayed Chen\'s 
announcement as endorsing Lee\'s call to \"Taiwanize\" official 
institutions.  End Summary. 
 
Changing the Name 
----------------- 
 
2. (C) President Chen Shui-bian announced on December 5 that 
Taiwan would change the name of its overseas offices, 
government agencies, and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) from 
\"China\" and \"Taipei\" to \"Taiwan\" by 2006.  Chen told 
reporters at a DPP press conference that the purpose of the 
change was to avoid \"confusion\" abroad between \"PRC\" and 
\"ROC\" institutions.  Chen emphasized, however, that he would 
not change the legal title of the country.  Chen stated that 
\"our national title, the Republic of China, not only reflects 
historical realities, it also represents the greatest 
consensus within Taiwan society over our national identity.\" 
Chen added that all of his previous pledges, including those 
made during his May 20 Inaugural Address and October 10 
National Day speech, would remain in force throughout his 
term of office.  Defending the limits he has placed on future 
constitutional revisions, Chen stated that Taiwan needs a 
constitutional reform plan that will improve governance and 
meet Taiwan\'s current needs rather than a \"debate over 
ideology or verbal slogans.\" 
 
3. (C) Following the president\'s speech, the Premier and 
spokesmen for the DPP and MOFA clarified that the initiative 
to change the name of Taiwan\'s overseas missions only 
referred to offices in countries that do not recognize the 
\"Republic of China.\"  The MOFA Spokesman noted that changing 
the title of offices would only be done if approval was 
secured from host governments.  DPP Deputy Secretary General 
Lee Ying-yuan told the Director that Chen himself echoed this 
clarification during a campaign rally later in the evening. 
Regarding SOEs, Executive Yuan (EY) 
Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung announced that the 
EY has already formulated a plan to change the English titles 
for a number of state entities, including the \"Central Bank 
of China,\" \"China Shipbuilding,\" and \"China Steel.\" 
 
Squeezed From Both Sides 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) The president\'s press conference came hours before the 
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) and Pan-Blue alliance held 
separate rallies in Taipei City (Note: The media and 
organizers for both camps claimed turnout in the hundreds of 
thousands, but AIT on-site observers estimated attendance at 
no more than 20,000 for the TSU and 10,000 for the Pan-Blue 
rally).  Presidential Office Deputy Secretary General James 
Huang told the Director that the press conference was 
organized after the DPP canceled its planned December 4 
\"Protect Taiwan\" rally due to a passing typhoon.  Huang said 
the DPP did not want to allow the other parties to monopolize 
the headlines in the final weekend of campaigning. 
 
5. (C) DPP Secretary General Chang Chun-hsiung told the 
Director that Chen\'s December 5 comments were carefully 
calibrated in advance.  Chang said that the DPP feared that 
if it remained silent, the December 5 name change rally would 
allow the TSU to dominate the Pan-Green agenda and thus steal 
votes from the DPP.  At the same time, Chang asserted that 
officials present at the meeting urged the president to 
consider possible USG reaction to any statement regarding a 
name change.  In the end, Chang stated that Chen decided on 
the approach of announcing the name change for overseas 
offices and SOEs to appeal to the Pan-Green base while 
reiterating his continued commitment to the \"five no\'s\" and 
other pledges to reassure the United States.  Chang added 
that the name change initiative for foreign missions is not a 
new policy, noting that Taipei requested such a change from 
Japan two years ago.  (Note: Taiwan has also sought to use 
\"Taiwan\" in the name for the community center in Gaithersburg 
built by TECRO Washington.  End Note.) 
 
6. (C) Chang said that the president recognized that this 
approach would cost the DPP seats to the TSU in the December 
11 legislative election, but decided to proceed anyway out of 
consideration for USG concerns.  Chang claimed that a DPP 
poll done Sunday night showed the DPP losing two seats to the 
TSU as a result of the TSU\'s December 5 rally, with no 
 
SIPDIS 
offsetting gain for the DPP among centrist voters.  Chang 
attributed the lack of movement among centrists to the 
general lack of interest among non-partisan voters in the 
December 11 election campaign.  Chang said he was surprised 
at the president\'s willingness to intentionally sacrifice 
party interests for the sake of foreign policy.  He also 
praised the president for consulting with his advisors in 
advance of his December 5 announcement.  \"During the last 
election campaign, he never told anyone about his plans to 
announce things like a referendum on a new constitution,\" 
Chang continued, \"he even refused to tell (National Security 
Council Secretary General) Chiou I-jen.\" 
 
Comment: Domestic Driven Focus 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) We do not doubt the DPP\'s claims that Chen\'s December 
5 announcement was driven by domestic political 
considerations.  This explanation, however, makes it no less 
troubling.  This latest episode is yet another reminder of 
the eroding political will in Taiwan to maintain the 
cross-Strait status quo.  There is one other disturbing 
aspect to the weekend\'s developments.  Previous rhetorical 
provocations have been explained away as President Chen 
extemporizing.  In this case it is clear that both the DPP 
and the EY have been planning this name change proposal for 
some time. 
 
8. (C) While the structure of Legislative Yuan (LY) elections 
generally encourages both camps to move to the extremes, the 
situation may not necessarily improve after December 11.  It 
is increasingly clear that the DPP sees Lee and his TSU as 
the real potent opposition force and is content to ignore the 
self-marginalized Pan-Blue alliance.  An election that 
results in the DPP reliant on the TSU for a majority, or 
competing with the TSU for the hearts and votes of Pan-Green 
supporters in future elections, may give Lee and his 
associates even greater influence over the direction and 
content of policy.  This would leave the USG, as it has been 
for more than a year, as the only effective force to balance 
further moves away from the status quo.

U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
 
1. Taiwan\'s Economic Prospect 
 
\"Do Not Use [Reasons Like Taiwan\'s] Industry Outflow 
and Pro-China Attitude to Harm Taiwan\'s Credit Rating 
Again\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" editorialized 
(12/7): 
 
\"It is regretful that while China\'s political and 
military threats have done serious damage to Taiwan 
already, Beijing is still using means like blocking 
Taiwan\'s participation in the World Health Organization 
or signing free trade agreements [with other countries] 
to isolate Taiwan.  Under such circumstances, some 
people in Taiwan not only forget that they should first 
reflect on themselves, but instead, some pro-China 
people or even some government officials try to promote 
policies that will strengthen exchanges with China, 
thus enabling China to have more channels to hurt 
Taiwan.  If Taiwan wants to improve its credit rating, 
it should first abandon these incorrect policies and 
ideas, so that the island can restore its confidence 
and strive to change Taiwan\'s credit rating back to 
`normal.\'\" 
 
2. U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations 
 
\"U.S. Connivance with Taiwan Independence Is Dangerous\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" commented in an editorial (12/7): 
 
\"The discrepancy [between how Washington views Taiwan 
and how Taiwan people look at the island] suggests 
American hypocrisy and disrespect for the 1918 
Wilsonian principle of self-determination. 
 
\"Denying the ROC as a sovereign state has helped 
legitimize Communist China\'s demand of Taiwan\'s return 
to its fold and encouraged separatists on the island to 
pursue non-Chinese statehood.  The two conflicting 
goals promise a military showdown to break the status 
quo sooner or later. 
 
\"Washington doesn\'t want to be dragged into a war with 
China over Taiwan, but it is moving toward that 
eventuality by conniving at President Chen\'s insistence 
on more trappings of statehood. 
 
\"While officially opposed to independence referendums, 
the U.S. virtually has given Chen a free hand to 
provoke China and whip up separatist sentiments.  In 
return, Washington only wants Taiwan to pay more and 
buy more advanced weaponry to beef up defense against 
mainland threats, starting an arms race between `a 
mosquito and an elephant.\' 
 
\"Apparently, Washington\'s China-Taiwan policy aims only 
at coping with the effect of the problem, not 
eradicating the cause.  As in soliciting Chinese 
collaboration in the anti-terrorist enterprise, the 
U.S. should have pressured Beijing to be more 
accommodating to Taiwan\'s wishes, and Taipei, less 
resistant to the `one China\' principle. . 
 
\"The rising tension in the strait has been prompted by 
the Chen administration\'s rejection of the `one China\' 
principle, which is also a direct challenge to 
Washington\'s long-standing `one China\' policy.  But the 
U.S. has also chosen to ignore it, as if defense 
cooperation between the protector and the protected 
could be built on policy contradictions. 
 
\"And all Washington has done to check Chen\'s separatist 
moves is holding him accountable by reciting in public 
his `five-no\' pledge of no independence plebiscite 
enshrined in his 2000 and 2004 inauguration addresses. 
But the Chen pledge only amounts to `no change in the 
status quo through referendums during his tenure.\'  He 
never promised to respect the U.S. `one China\' policy 
nor refrain from pushing separatist movements. 
 
\"No wonder Taiwan\'s independence fundamentalists view 
the U.S. `one China\' pronouncements as more lip service 
to placate Beijing.  And the U.S. language of `no 
support for\' Taiwan independence is misinterpreted as 
`not opposed to\' it.  Also no wonder Beijing has become 
increasingly suspicious about Washington\'s intentions, 
and is busy making preparations `to recover the island 
at all cost,\' including a confrontation with the U.S. 
 
\"With reckless leaders like [President] Chen [Shui- 
bian] and [former President] Lee [Teng-hui], a 
confusing mentor and protector like the U.S., and a 
paranoid enemy like Beijing, can Taiwan expect to be 
left alone in peace?\"

1. (C) Summary: Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu told the AIT 
Deputy Director December 1 that the Pan-Blue may well retain 
a working majority in the next LY session.  Regardless he 
would urge KMT Chairman Lien Chan and those around him to 
resign, though they may resist.  Whether or not the PFP 
performs well in the December 11 election, Hu also downplayed 
prospects for a KMT-PFP merger.  Hu said that the KMT can not 
compete with the DPP on election campaigning, especially when 
the DPP deploys the Taiwan identity card.  Nonetheless, 
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou will be a strong presidential 
candidate for 2008.  Hu added that he was considering running 
for Taipei Mayor in 2006.  End Summary. 
 
Pan-Blue\'s Working LY Majority 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu (Chih-ch\'iang) told the 
AIT Deputy Director December 1 that he expected the Pan-Blue 
to secure 105 to 110 seats in the upcoming Legislative Yuan 
(LY) race.  Using the higher estimate of 110, he predicted a 
80/30 KMT to People First Party (PFP) breakdown.  Hu also 
expected the independents to win 15 seats, which would give 
the Pan-Blue a 125-seat working majority.  Hu was confident 
that the independents would continue to vote with the Blues 
on legislation, and discounted the numbers that would be 
tempted to vote with the Greens given that the DPP were the 
ruling party. 
 
3. (C) Commenting on the voter allocation strategy (pei-piao) 
adopted by the DPP in this final week of campaigning, Hu said 
that pei-piao is more difficult for the KMT.  He explained 
that in the \"old days\" KMT could \"instruct\" its supporters to 
allocate their votes according to the organizations to which 
they belong.  However, he explained that the KMT can no 
longer give such instructions and must instead \"appeal\" to 
its supporters to vote systematically.  Moreover, after four 
years of DPP rule, government bureaucracies and civic 
organizations are no longer exclusively KMT, and the party 
cannot be sure how many party members are in a specific 
organization. 
 
Et Tu Brute: KMT Leadership Post LY election 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Hu said that, while it is difficult to discuss KMT 
leadership until after the LY election, he strongly advocates 
that, whatever the outcome, KMT Chairman Lien Chan, KMT 
Secretary General Lin Fong-cheng, and all the people around 
 
SIPDIS 
them must resign.  Hu said that if the Pan-Blue retained 
control of the LY, Wang Jin-pyng would remain as the speaker 
and Lien might stay on as chairman beyond the end of his term 
in July 2005.  However, if the Pan-Blue did not have the 
majority, Wang would lose his speaker\'s job and become just 
another legislator.  Hu said that Lien would not necessarily 
step down immediately in the event of a Pan-Blue electoral 
defeat, but he is likely to go when his term expires in July 
2005. 
 
5. (C) Hu told the Deputy Director that as early as spring 
2003 he was urging Lien to take on the role of \"kingmaker\" 
rather than the king.  Hu said that Lien replied to him in 
English, \"find me a king.\"  Hu said even though he is one of 
Lien\'s men, if Lien did not resign in July 2005, he would 
urge him to go.  Hu said that, although he would feel like 
Brutus betraying Caesar, he would do it for the sake of the 
KMT\'s future.  Hu said that he believes that Taipei Mayor Ma 
Ying-jeou is most qualified to succeed Lien as chairman, and 
to be KMT candidate for president in 2008.  Hu was confident 
that being a Mainlander would not diminish Ma\'s prospects in 
southern Taiwan. 
 
6. (C) Hu, however, hinted that tensions existed between Lien 
and Ma, and that Lien \"would not be so happy to see Ma 
succeed him as KMT chairman.\"  Given this situation, Hu said 
that a compromise might be worked out so that Wang Jin-pyng 
would serve as chairman for a year or two before handing over 
the reins to Ma.  Or, Hu said, another compromise scenario 
might be that Wang serve as chairman with the understanding 
that Ma would be the 2008 presidential nominee.  However, Hu 
also suggested Ma needed the chairman job to have a title and 
resources to compete for presidency.  Hu declined to guess 
who the vice presidential candidate might be in this case. 
 
End of Soong 
------------ 
 
7. (C) Whatever happens to the KMT after the December LY 
election, Hu said he cannot see a role in the KMT for PFP 
Chairman James Soong.  Hu said that the KMT-PFP merger will 
not materialize.  Hu reasoned that if the PFP does better 
than expected in the LY election, Soong will continue to be 
active politically and the PFP members will not want to merge 
with the KMT.  If the PFP performs poorly in the election, Hu 
continued, the PFP will have no bargaining chip and will not 
like the merger terms that the KMT is likely to dictate. 
 
Plead for A Responsible Opposition 
---------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) AIT Deputy Director urged Hu and the KMT to embrace 
the role of a responsible opposition party.  The Deputy 
Director urged the KMT not to disrupt the legislative process 
just for the sake of being disruptive and not to become 
passive and allow the DPP to push through legislation without 
responsible public debate.  Hu said that he had recently 
publicly admonished Lien for adopting an entirely reactive 
attitude toward DPP policy proposals.  Hu said that after he 
urged Lien not to follow \"the DPP\'s butt,\" Ma and Taoyuan 
County Magistrate Eric Chu (Li-lun) telephoned to say that Hu 
had vocalized what they feel in their hearts but dared not 
say. 
 
9. (C) Hu reassured the Deputy Director that the Pan-Blue 
will make it impossible for President Chen Shui-bian to pass 
any potentially destabilizing revisions to the constitution. 
Hu said that even if the Pan-Green has an LY majority, Chen 
will still find it difficult to overcome the three-fourths 
threshold necessary for constitutional change. 
 
KMT\'s Achilles Heel 
------------------- 
 
10. (C) Hu bemoaned the fact that the DPP are such \"good 
campaigners.\"  He said that the KMT never imagined that 
Taiwan identity and the \"love Taiwan\" (ai Taiwan) theme would 
be such a powerful mantra.  He said that it worked in the 
2000 presidential race, the 2001 LY election, the 2004 
presidential campaign, and now it is being trotted out again 
in this LY election.  Hu said that the KMT hoped that the 
Taiwan identity issue would run dry but instead its power has 
become an endless \"black hole,\" sucking in Pan-Blue strength. 
 
12. (C) Recounting the 2004 presidential election, Hu said 
that the \"two bullets\" changed the outcome of the campaign. 
Hu said that according to internal KMT polls, the Pan-Blue 
was leading by seven to eight percent.  Based on these 
numbers, Hu explained, the Pan-Blue calculated that even if 
some people were swayed by the incident to cast sympathy 
votes for Chen, the Pan-Blue would still win.  Hu said that 
the Pan-Blue thought that the DPP would use the shooting 
incident to cancel or postpone the election, and said the 
Pan-Blue leadership was stunned when the DPP announced it 
wanted the balloting to proceed as scheduled.  Hu revealed 
that only James Soong concluded that the election should be 
canceled.  Hu said that when the rest of the Pan-Blue leaders 
asked Soong why he thought it should be canceled, Soong, in 
typical fashion, replied that the Pan-Blue should oppose 
anything the DPP wants.  Hu said that Lien overruled Soong on 
this issue because Lien wanted the election to proceed as 
planned. 
 
Musical Mayors 
-------------- 
 
13. (C) Hu commented that although he has declared his 
intention to run for reelection next year he said it only to 
keep everyone from jockeying to replace him so they would 
focus on the LY election.  Hu told the Deputy Director that 
his advisors are urging him not to run again, and instead 
rest for a year before running for Taipei City Mayor in 2006. 
 Hu said that if he does decide to run in Taipei City, then 
Eric Chu might run for Taichung City Mayor. 
 
Comment: Future for Ma Li-chiang? 
--------------------------------- 
 
14. (C)  In the winter of 2002, Jason Hu coined the persona 
Ma Li-chiang (by taking the first character from Ma\'s name, 
the second character from Eric Chu\'s name, and the third 
character from his own name -- together the phrase means 
\"strong horsepower\").  The local media immediately dubbed Ma 
Li-chiang as the KMT heir presumptives and presidential 
hopefuls for 2004, 2012, and 2024.  However, in spring 2003 
Lien ignored Ma Li-chiang and instead paired with Soong for 
the 2004 presidential campaign.  To this day, the KMT 
leadership continues to ignore Ma Li-chiang and their call 
for internal party reform.  In addition to being ignored by 
their own party leaders, Ma Li-chiang must also overcome the 
challenge of ethnic politics.  While admitting that KMT 
election campaigns have so far stumbled whenever the DPP 
deploys the Taiwan identity card, Hu asserted that being a 
Mainlander has not prevented him from being elected Taichung 
City Mayor and that it will not prevent Ma from being 
successful in his presidential quest.  However, in order for 
Ma Li-chiang be in a position to test the proposition and 
challenge the DPP, they must first resolve the KMT\'s 
leadership question.

KEY BROKER IN POST-ELECTION LANDSCAPE? 
 
REF: TAIPEI 03796 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Taiwan\'s newest and fifth largest party, the 
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU), is facing an uphill 
battle to eke out enough seats this election to remain a 
viable political force in the post-December Legislative Yuan 
(LY).  The NPSU will have to exceed the expectation of most 
pundits and polls, which are projecting only five to seven 
seats, to obtain the eight seat minimum threshold for a party 
to form a caucus in the LY.  Nevertheless, even without 
enough seats for a caucus, the NPSU may emerge as a key 
power-broker in Taiwan\'s post-election landscape if either 
the Pan-Blue or the Pan-Green are a few seats short of a 
majority and the NPSU manages to hold its fragile cohesion in 
the face of intense lobbying targeted at individual members 
that is likely to come from both camps.  End Summary. 
 
A \"Non-Partisan\" Party or a Collection of Self-Interests? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (C) The NPSU is headed by Chang Po-ya, former Health and 
Interior Minister, and was formed in June of this year by a 
motley crew of eleven independent lawmakers who previously 
had formed a \"non-partisan\" caucus in the LY.  The NPSU 
legislative agenda focuses on livelihood issues, such as 
education, worker training, and economic development, and 
takes what NPSU Chairwoman Chang said is a \"neutral\" stance 
on national security issues, such as the arms procurement 
legislation.  (Note: In fact members of the NPSU generally 
support the purchase plan, but at reduced levels.) 
Chairwoman Chang told AIT on December 3 that the NPSU seeks 
to hold the middle ground in Taiwan politics, looking after 
the interests of Taiwan\'s people and working with both the 
Pan-Blue and Pan-Green camps. 
 
3. (C) Playing \"non-partisan\" politics, however, is probably 
more difficult for the NPSU than Chang portrays.  One major 
challenge is the fact that many NPSU legislators and 
candidates are ex-members of the mainstream parties and 
continue to have ties and share ideological positions with 
their former colleagues.  Former KMT (Lin Bing-kun, Lu 
Hsin-min, and Lin Ming-yi), People First Party (Chen 
Cheng-sheng and Chiu Chuang-liang), and Democratic 
Progressive Party (Cheng Yu-cheng and Chu Hsing-yu) 
politicians, a good number of whom were expelled from their 
parties for violating ethics regulations, comprise the 
backbone of the NPSU membership.  Cheng Yu-cheng, for 
example, told AIT on November 30 that on major issues of 
importance he votes with the Greens if the NPSU does not take 
a Pan-Green position.  Cheng added that the NPSU party 
headquarters strategy is often hijacked by the self-interest 
of the legislators themselves, who joined together into a 
caucus, and later a party, mainly to acquire the ability to 
sit on drafting committees in order to expand their 
bargaining power to further their individual agendas. 
 
Election Challenge: Staying Alive 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The NPSU is facing an uphill battle to win the eight 
seat minimum that LY regulations require for the formation of 
a party caucus, which would boost its ability to be a major 
player in the post-election legislature.  Twenty-six 
candidates, including nine incumbents, are running under the 
NPSU banner in districts throughout the island.  Chairwoman 
Chang and NPSU Secretary-General J.J. Chen projected an 
optimistic figure of ten seats, but conceded that currently 
only five to six candidates -- the former independents Yen 
Ching-piao, Chen Chin-ding, Cai Hao, May Chin, and Walisi 
Beilin, and former KMT legislator Lin Ping-kun (Penghu 
County) -- look strong.  Secretary-General Chen said former 
PFP legislator Chiu Chuang-liang (running in Taoyuan County), 
former PFP member Chen Cheng-sheng (Nantou County), and 
former KMT failed candidate Lin Ming-yi (Yunlin County) have 
a chance of surging ahead in the final week to grab a seat in 
their districts. 
 
5. (C) Despite optimism from the NPSU party leadership, NPSU 
party candidates on the borderline, especially those with 
former party affiliations, are unlikely to win through.  With 
a party establishment that appears weak on policy cohesion, 
financial support, and campaign coordination, NPSU candidates 
are left to rely on their own local bases of support and to 
campaign on their own issues, a point which both Chairwoman 
Chang and NPSU Secretary-General Chen conceded.  Cheng 
Yu-cheng in Taipei County, for example, is essentially 
running his campaign as a Pan-Green candidate and makes 
little, if any, reference to his NPSU party membership.  Both 
pollsters and pundits AIT has consulted project that at best 
the NPSU will win between five to seven seats.  DPP Survey 
Center Director Pan I-hsuan told AIT on December 2 that 
support for many NPSU candidates, especially the incumbents 
who were originally elected as KMT, PFP, or DPP party 
members, is shifting back to the major parties as election 
day nears and voters are calculating that they need to give a 
majority to either the Pan-Blue or Pan-Green.  Chang and 
Chen\'s statement that only former independents (vice 
partisans) appear secure of wining seats implicitly echoes 
Pan\'s assessment. 
Post-Election Power-Broker? 
--------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The NPSU, even if it does not win the minimum number 
of seats needed for a caucus, will nevertheless attempt to 
play off the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green camps in order to 
establish itself as a power broker in post-election politics. 
 If one side falls a few seats short of a majority, the NPSU 
leadership clearly expects to be wooed and said it would be 
in a position to recruit more independents into the party. 
Chairwoman Chang, while declining to acknowledge what, if any 
deal, is already being arranged, hinted that the NPSU would 
seek to make \"arrangements\" that served the best interests of 
the Taiwan people.  Secretary-General Chen was more 
forthcoming and admitted that his party would be looking for 
a cabinet-level position, such as Interior Minister, for its 
Chairwoman.  NPSU legislator Cheng Yu-Cheng told AIT that the 
NPSU was already talking with the Pan-Green to secure the 
Vice-Presidency of the Legislative Yuan in exchange for 
lending its support to the Pan-Green coalition, although he 
was unwilling to speculate on which legislator the NPSU would 
put forward for the Vice-Presidency.  National Security 
Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen separately suggested a 
similar arrangement (Reftel). 
 
7. (C) Any attempt by the NPSU to bargain for concessions 
from the Pan-Green or Pan-Blue camps, however, is likely to 
be compromised to some extent by the loose cohesion and 
discipline of its individual members.  Secretary-General Chen 
in his discussion with AIT emphasized that post-election 
negotiations needed to be conducted at the party-to-party 
level, rather than with the individual members, indicating 
that NPSU leadership is worried that its members can be 
bought-off one-by-one. 
 
Comment: Hanging Together, or Separately Hanging 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
8. (C) The NPSU and its precursor, the \"non-partisan\" caucus 
in the LY, have yet to play a major role in Taiwan politics. 
While its leadership proclaims to take the high ground and 
not play partisan politics, the party has so far provided 
little more than vague livelihood-related campaign issues and 
themes that their own candidates have largely failed to take 
to heart.  Yet, Chairwoman Chang and General-Secretary Chen 
clearly believe that if neither camp emerges with a 
legislative majority this week, the NPSU will find itself 
occupying prime political real-estate.  The key challenge for 
NPSU leadership will be to convince its legislators that 
maintaining party cohesion will more fully satiate their 
self-interests than individually selling out to the highest 
bidder.  If the leadership fails to do so, the NPSU is 
unlikely to become a power-broker in the new LY.

SUBJECT: LY ELECTION: DPP COULD GAIN BIG IN KAOHSIUNG COUNTY 
 
 
Classified By: ROBERT W. FORDEN, AIT KAOHSIUNG PRINCIPAL OFFICER. 
REASON:  1.5(d). 
 
Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (C) The Pan-Green could pick up two or even three 
Legislative Yuan (LY) seats in Kaohsiung County at the 
expense of the Kuomintang (KMT).  Kaohsiung County\'s nine LY 
seats currently are split 5-4 in favor of the Pan-Blue, but 
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is confident it can 
effectively allocate votes among its five candidates this 
time to get all elected.  The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) 
is also hopeful it can draw votes from former supporters of 
LY Speaker Wang Jyn-ping to get two TSU candidates elected. 
Two People First Party (PFP) candidates also appear strong 
due to strong \"mainlander\" and local faction support.  Added 
Pan-Green seats are likely to come at the expense of the KMT, 
which could lose some or all of its seats in Kaohsiung 
County, if LY Speaker Wang is unable to steer his traditional 
vote base to the other KMT candidates.  End summary. 
 
Kaohsiung County -- Opportunity for Green Gains 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2.  (C) In recent meetings with AIT/K, Kaohsiung County KMT 
and DPP Chairmen agreed that the KMT faced a serious 
challenge in trying to hold onto the three LY seats it 
currently has in Kaohsiung County.  Currently, the KMT and 
DPP each hold three seats, the PFP has two and the TSU, one. 
However, this distribution of seats did not directly reflect 
the 2001 vote, in which the Pan-Green actually drew far more 
votes than the Pan-Blue in Kaohsiung County.  The poor Green 
showing four years ago instead reflected its poor nomination 
and vote allocation strategy.  For example, in 2001, one of 
the DPP\'s candidates, Lin Tai-hua, the young, attractive 
daughter of an influential local political figure, managed to 
draw over 70,000 votes, even though it was her first time 
running.  Had Lin\'s votes been spread in part to other 
Pan-Green candidates, the DPP would have picked up 1-2 other 
seats at the expense of two KMT candidates that barely 
squeaked by. 
 
3.  (C) To avoid a repeat of 2001, the DPP is urging its 
supporters to spread their votes evenly across the DPP\'s five 
candidates, Kaohsiung County DPP Secretary General Tsai 
Yung-chang told AIT/K.  Tsai said the Kaohsiung County DPP 
office was conducting careful polling each week to determine 
the level of support for each of its five candidates.  If the 
polls show more than a 10 percent difference in support 
between the highest and lowest of the candidates, it will 
instruct supporters to shift votes to even up the candidates. 
 Tsai said, however, that the DPP would not coordinate vote 
allocation with the TSU because the DPP feared its votes 
would be spread too thinly and cost it a seat.  Based on the 
latest polling and assuming effective vote allocation, Tsai 
predicted all five DPP candidates would win. 
 
TSU Hopes to Pick Up a Second Seat from KMT Base 
 
SIPDIS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4.  (C) The TSU has also fielded strong candidates, DPP SG 
Tsai said.  TSU incumbent Lin Chi-lung came in third in 2001 
 
SIPDIS 
and remain very strong.  The other TSU candidate, Huang 
Wan-chuan, had come close to being elected in 2001.  Huang, 
an associate of the politically-powerful Yu family in 
Kaohsiung County (former Taiwan Interior Minister Yu 
Chen-hsien, incumbent LY Yu Cheng-tao, and others) has strong 
backing from important local factions.  With Lee Teng-hui\'s 
active intervention, the TSU has high hopes that Huang can 
draw votes away from LY Speaker Wang Jyn-ping\'s traditional 
base.  While DPP SG Tsai worried that there may not be enough 
Pan-Green votes in Kaohsiung County to support all seven 
Pan-Green candidates, he thought there was still a chance TSU 
candidate Huang could pull enough votes from the Pan-Blue 
side that all seven Green candidates would win. 
 
KMT Seeks to Limit Loss to One Seat 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) For most of the same reasons cited by the DPP, 
Kaohsiung County KMT Chairman Chuan Sung-won told AIT/K he 
also judged the KMT to have an uphill battle to hold onto its 
seats.  The KMT had played it conservatively this time, 
nominating only its two incumbents, Lin Yi-shih and Chen 
Li-huei, plus one former LY member, Wu Kuang-shun, to try to 
hold Wang\'s seat (LY Speaker Wang is running this time as a 
KMT at-large candidate).  Of the three KMT candidates, Chen 
Li-huei is weakest in the polls.  Chen barely won in 2001, 
benefiting from the split Pan-Green vote. 
 
6.  (C) KMT Chairman Chuan worried that several independents, 
while unlikely to win, could pull significant numbers of 
votes from all the Pan-Blue candidates.  The strongest of the 
independents is Huang Hsi-wen, a former County Council Member 
who had been expelled by the KMT after helping his father run 
for County Magistrate as an independent against the KMT 
choice.  Huang could draw away a significant number of votes, 
particularly ones that traditionally have gone to LY Speaker 
Wang Jyn-ping. 
 
PFP -- Good Chance to Hold Onto Its Two Seats 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) While the KMT situation is difficult, most in 
Kaohsiung County see the PFP candidates as strong.  Pan-Blue 
and Pan-Green officials all told AIT/K that PFP incumbent 
Chao Lian-yen would likely be re-elected with a significant 
percentage of the Kaohsiung County \"mainlander\" vote, 
estimated to be about 50,000.  The other PFP candidate, 
incumbent Chung Shao-ho, was Hakka from the Meinung District 
of Kaohsiung and would receive strong support there.  While 
the Hakka vote, around 30,000,  was not sufficient by itself 
to re-elect him, it got him close enough to make a win 
likely.  It took 33,000 votes to win a Kaohsiung County LY 
seat in the 2001 election and most expected a similar 
threshold this time. 
 
Comment -- Vote Allocation Strategy Key to Green Gains 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
8.  (C) Kaohsiung County promises to be one of the best 
opportunities for the Pan-Green to pick up seats in the 
upcoming LY election.  It is a good example of how nomination 
strategies and vote allocation can influence the outcome of 
Taiwan\'s multi-member district legislative elections.  In 
neighboring Kaohsiung City in 2001, the Pan-Green gained more 
seats than its vote totals would have otherwise supported, 
because the KMT split its votes among too many candidates. 
Kaohsiung County, on the other hand, generated a higher than 
expected number of seats for the KMT in 2001 because the 
Pan-Green did not correctly adjust its votes among its 
candidates.  Should the Pan-Green succeed this time in taking 
as many as 6-7 of Kaohsiung County\'s LY seats, it will be 
less an indication of Pan-Green gains in voter support than a 
reconfirmation of the effectiveness of strategic planning in 
candidate selection and vote allocation.

REF: TAIPEI 03466 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: With three days left before election day, the 
field of viable candidates for the eight Legislative Yuan 
(LY) seats in the battleground city of Taichung has narrowed 
to nine from eighteen (See Reftel).  Although the Pan-Blue 
camp appears poised to retain the four seats it won in the 
2001 election, the new seat added to Taichung City this year 
will probably go to the Pan-Green (if the Green-leaning 
independent is counted in the Green camp), changing the 
Pan-Blue four-to-three advantage into a four-four draw. 
However, one KMT incumbent is overwhelmingly popular and may 
draw too many votes away the weakest of her ticketmates.  The 
Blue to Green balance could tilt three to five, but such an 
outcome remains only a small possibility.  End Summary. 
 
Narrowing Field: 3 Candidates Fight for 2 Seats 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (C) Since AIT last visited Taichung City in early 
November, the field of viable candidates has narrowed to four 
Pan-Greens, an independent who is a former Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) Taichung mayor, and four Pan-Blues. 
Of these nine candidates, six are safely assured of seats, 
leaving the remaining three to fight for the last two seats. 
The two DPP incumbents, Shieh Ming-yuan and Lee Ming-hsien, 
are running strong campaigns and likely to win. All local 
observers told AIT that the independent, Chang Wen-ying, is 
highly popular and should also easily secure a seat.  Both 
media and KMT internal party polls provided to AIT place 
Chang among the top three slots.  KMT incumbent Lu Shiow-yen 
is consistently in the top position and both the People First 
Party (PFP) candidates in the upper-middle of the pack round 
out the six assured winners.  The race for the remaining two 
seats boils down to a contest between the DPP newcomer Wang 
Shih-shun, Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) incumbent Ho 
Min-hao, and KMT newcomer Tsai Jin-lung. 
 
An Independent Squeezes the Greens 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Chang Wen-ying\'s continued prominence and popularity 
has made it much more difficult for the Pan-Green to ensure 
victory for all four of its nominees (one TSU and three DPP). 
 The official Pan-Green candidates will most likely take 
three seats.  DPP Taichung City Chairman Chen Da-jun on 
December 1 estimated that Chang is getting half her support 
from Pan-Green voters, reducing the pool of votes available 
to the DPP and TSU.  Although Chen said 30 percent of DPP 
voters in Taichung are willing to participate in vote 
distribution, versus 10 percent for the KMT, Chen assessed 
that the DPP nominees lack a large enough vote pool to allow 
the weakest two to secure seats.  The DPP has included the 
TSU incumbent, Ho Min-hao, in its vote distribution plans 
 
SIPDIS 
and, according to Chen, Ho and DPP newcomer Wang Shih-shun 
will be fighting for the eighth seat, which Ho is likely to 
win.  DPP Survey Center Director Pan I-hsuan confirmed Chen\'s 
assessment on December 2. 
 
KMT\'s One Weak Link 
------------------- 
 
4. (C) Although the KMT has been conservative in its 
nominations in Taichung, newcomer Tsai Jin-lung is in danger 
of not winning a seat if votes are not distributed from the 
popular front-runner Lu Shiow-yen.  Taichung City Mayor Jason 
Hu told AIT that the KMT has done extensive polling in the 
city and found that 18 and 29 percent of Lu supporters are 
very willing or somewhat willing to distribute votes.  The 
party estimates that if both those groups distribute their 
votes, Tsai Jin-lung, who is on the borderline, will move up 
into the sixth position, pushing down the DPP\'s Shieh 
Ming-yuan to seven and forcing the DPP\'s Wang or the TSU\'s Ho 
into eight.  Even with a lower participation rate, Mayor Hu 
was still optimistic Tsai would come in seventh or eight, 
displacing one of the lower ranked Green candidates.  Hung 
Chao-nan, the incumbent KMT legislator who decided not to 
stand again this year, was considerably less optimistic. 
Hung told AIT that Lu Shiow-yen\'s Mainlander supporters would 
never vote for the Taiwanese Tsai.  Hung said his own local 
Taiwanese KMT supporters have not warmed up to Tsai. 
 
PFP Daniel Hwang: The Comeback Kid 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The PFP in Taichung city, unlike elsewhere, is in a 
relatively comfortable position.  Both of its candidates, 
Daniel Hwang (Yih-jiau) and Shen Chih-hwei, are running 
strongly in the polls and do not have overlapping bases of 
support, said PFP Taichung City Chairman Lin Ping-yuan. 
Hwang, a handsome and charismatic incumbent running for a 
third term, has city-wide support from many white-collar 
professionals and young female voters.  Shen is a veteran 
lawmaker who is running on her constituent service record and 
enjoys support from the city\'s large number of retired 
military families.  Lin said both are not in danger of losing 
their seats and the PFP has no plans to distribute votes 
between them or with the KMT. 
 
Comment: A Draw, of Sorts? 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (C) AIT\'s contacts in Taichung clearly see independent 
Chang Wei-ying as a Pan-Green, and Chang offered this past 
weekend to re-join the party after the election.  With Chang 
assured of a seat, the most likely outcome in Taichung is a 
four-four distribution of seats between the Pan-Blue and 
Pan-Green camps.  AIT\'s local Pan-Blue contacts have already 
begun to portray such an outcome as a \"success\" for the local 
party establishment and a sign they can hold their own 
against the Greens.  A four-four draw, however, actually 
means an extra seat for the Pan-Green side and another step 
closer to their goal of a legislative majority.

SUBJECT: PAN-GREEN JUST SHORT OF A MAJORITY IN LY ELECTION 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: With the battle for control of Taiwan\'s 
Legislative Yuan (LY) entering its final days, neither the 
Pan-Green nor Pan-Blue camp is likely to win an outright 
majority (113 or more out of 225 seats) on December 11. 
Although the race in several key districts is still too close 
to call, AIT\'s best estimate is that the Pan-Green will take 
110 LY seats, up 10 from their 2001 performance, versus 103 
for the Pan-Blue, down 12, with the remaining 12 seats going 
to independents.  The final numbers could vary plus 4 or 
minus 3 for either camp, the key variable being the 
effectiveness of efforts to allocate votes (pei-piao), which 
in the past the Pan-Green has been able to execute more 
effectively than the Pan-Blue.  End Summary. 
 
Our Estimates vs. The Polls 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Pan-Green has been running a well-orchestrated 
campaign and, despite overly aggressive nominations in the 
northern districts, is likely to gain 10 seats over its 2001 
performance for a total of 110.  Based on how the individual 
contests throughout the island are likely to play out, the 
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) could make the biggest 
gains and increase its number of directly elected legislators 
from 69 to 75, while the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) could 
go up from 8 to 10.  If, as most analysts expect, the DPP 
draws 38-40 percent of the popular vote and the TSU 8-9 
percent, then the DPP will secure 20-22 proportional seats 
and the TSU 3-5. Adding the proportional vote seats to the 
district seats, the DPP could take a total of 96 seats and 
the TSU 14.  Factoring in a plus 4, minus 3 variation to 
account for the unpredictability of the highly contested 
races, makes for a total range of 107 to 114 seats.  An 
outright Pan-Green LY majority is therefore possible, but 
unlikely as all of the highly contested races would have to 
break in the Pan-Green\'s favor.  (Septel will provide a 
region-by-region wrap-up.) 
 
3. (C) The Pan-Blue, in comparison, has been generally 
conservative in its nominations, but nevertheless is likely 
to lose 12 seats for a total of 103.  Plagued with a plethora 
of \"maverick\" Pan-Blue candidates running as independents, 
weakening grass-roots organizations, and continuing 
internecine fighting between Kuomintang (KMT) and People 
First Party (PFP) candidates over vote allocation, the 
Pan-Blue has been running an ineffective campaign.  Although 
the KMT could actually win 55 seats, an improvement of 2 over 
2001, the heaviest losses are likely to come from the PFP, 
which AIT estimates could grab only 24 directly elected 
seats, a drop of 11.  If, as most analysts expect, the KMT 
draws 30-32 percent of the popular vote and the PFP 13-15 
percent, then the KMT will secure 16-18 proportional seats 
and the PFP 6-8. Adding the proportional vote seats, the KMT 
could have an overall total of 72 seats and the PFP 31. 
Factoring in a plus 4, minus 3 possible variation, the total 
range of Pan-Blue seats is 100 to 107, suggesting that the 
Pan-Blue is all but assured of losing its majority. 
 
4. (C) This estimate falls within the range of commercial 
polls and various party projections. The 110 number for the 
Pan-Green is within the upper range (99-113) of most 
commercial polls and the lower range (110-116) of DPP 
internal projections.  In comparison, the Pan-Blue estimate 
of 103 falls within the middle range (97-107) of commercial 
polls, slightly above the DPP\'s range (95-101), and in the 
lower range (102-109) of KMT internal projections. 
Commercial polling on Taiwan, unlike AIT\'s estimate, makes 
strait projections based on survey responses and does not 
factor the effect of vote allocation, which all political 
observers agree favors the Pan-Green and will be the key 
determinant of the final outcome.  The DPP Survey Center, 
which does include vote allocation in its projections, 
estimates 113 for the Pan-Green (DPP 97, TSU 16) and 99 for 
the Pan-Blue (KMT 68, PFP 31).  After speaking with DPP 
Survey Center Director Pan I-hsuan on December 2, it appears 
to AIT that, as in the 2004 presidential race, the DPP\'s 
internal figures are overestimating the Pan-Green advantage 
by 1 to 2 percent. 
 
Comment: Where will the Independents Go? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Taiwan\'s multi-member district system makes elections 
notoriously hard to predict, and every election has been 
marked by surprises as voters and parties make last minute 
adjustments in an attempt to out-guess the odds.  One key 
variable will be the performance of independent candidates. 
While polls are trending away in the final days of the 
campaign away from independents and towards both partisan 
camps, in many districts independents will still play a 
spoiler role for the major candidates.  They could also form 
an important voting bloc after the election, if neither side 
secures a majority.  Of the 12 independents most likely to 
win, seven lean Blue while five lean Green.  The DPP, with 
its access to central government resources, has the better 
chance of swaying both types, but whether it will be able to 
secure a stable majority may not be clear until well after 
December 11.

mishandling of Vanuatu.  Commenting on Chen Shui-bian\'s 
recent rhetoric on using Taiwan instead of the \"ROC\" for the 
next United Nations General Assembly bid and representative 
offices worldwide, Tien said he can only assume Chen did so 
to counter the political inroads of former president Lee

Passport Scandal Blemishes UK Tour 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Tien Hung-mao, former Taiwan Representative to the UK 
and before that Foreign Minister, defended himself and his 
staff on the passport case that led to his resignation -- 
fugitive Andrew Wang\'s wife, Yeh Hsiu-chen.  Tien told AIT 
that he resigned in anger because he felt Taiwan Premier Yu 
Shyi-kun \"blew the case out of proportion\" and mistreated him 
and his staff.  Tien explained that the Representative Office 
in London has no authority to approve or deny passports, and 
that Yeh\'s passport application was actually approved by the 
foreign ministry in Taipei.  Tien also claimed that, by 
notarizing documents for Yeh, his office merely confirmed the 
identity of the person who presented the documents.  He said 
that his office had alerted Taipei to the existence of the 
documents as soon as the consular officer notarized the 
documents.  Tien pointed out that it was beyond his control 
that Yeh was able to use the notarized documents to conduct 
questionable real estate transactions in Taipei. 
 
3. (C) Tien told AIT that, other than the passport scandal, 
he is quite proud of his UK tour.  He said that perhaps 
because of his academic reputation he was warmly received by 
British officials.  Tien commented that he was meeting 
officials at the US-equivalent Assistant Secretary level, and 
that even in formal settings, members of Parliament referred 
to him as \"ambassador\" and \"your excellency.\" 
 
Bad Moon Rising in EU for Taiwan 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Despite the warmth and friendliness Tien said he found 
on a personal level, he said that his successor Edgar Lin 
(former Taiwan ambassador to Gambia) will face difficult 
challenges as the PRC continues to expand its trade relations 
with the UK and other European nations and seeks to lift the 
EU embargo on arms sales to China.  Tien said that he 
appreciated the effort the US exerted to maintain the ban, 
and said the US and UK position was crucial in the November 
17 European Parliament decision to uphold the embargo. 
However, Tien asserted that although the European Parliament 
is currently reviewing its arms sales code of conduct, he 
foresees the EU lifting the embargo in early 2005.  Tien said 
that the EU will use the review as an excuse to say that it 
closed all the loopholes for potential abuse. 
 
5. (C) Tien warned that the US might not receive as much 
support from the UK as it previously did on this and other 
issues.  Tien said that, because of his support for the US 
position on Iraq, Tony Blair had frequently stood alone, 
against political opponents, against public opinion, and even 
against his own party.  Tien said that in the new year 
Britain \"will be looking to repair its relations with the 
French and Germans,\" and might not so readily support US 
positions. 
 
Vanuatu: Here you come again 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Regarding the recent flap over Vanuatu, Tien told AIT 
that the entire affair has been mishandled by Deputy Minister 
Michael Kau.  He said that during his own tenure as foreign 
minister (2000-2002), he had also secured a signed promise 
from then-Foreign Minister Serge Vohor to switch diplomatic 
recognition from PRC to Taiwan.  Tien said that he had not 
been sure Vohor could deliver on his promise and insisted 
that Taiwan wait until the agreement was adopted and 
confirmed by the Vanuatu cabinet before announcing it 
publicly.  Tien recalled that at the time he was under 
enormous pressure by senior level foreign ministry officials 
in Taipei to go public on the agreement in order to \"force 
the reality\" on the Vanuatu cabinet.  Tien said that he had 
to exert all of his influence in order to overrule his 
foreign ministry advisers.  Tien said as soon as he heard 
news about Vanuatu and Vohor, he thought to himself, \"here we 
go again.\" 
 
Baffled by Lee Teng-hui 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) Commenting on Chen Shui-bian\'s recent rhetoric on 
using Taiwan instead of the \"ROC\" for the next United Nations 
General Assembly bid and representative offices worldwide, 
Tien said that he guessed Chen did so to counter the 
political inroads of Tien\'s mentor Lee Teng-hui and his 
pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).  Tien said 
that he has not seen Lee lately and he could not begin to 
guess what is on Lee\'s mind.  Tien said he could not 
determine whether or not Lee was satisfied with Chen 
Shui-bian\'s performance, whether Lee thought Chen was moving 
too slowly with \"normalizing\" Taiwan\'s international status, 
whether Lee thought Chen was moving Taiwan in the right 
direction or if Lee believed Chen has compromised too much. 
Tien also worried about what Lee might say or do if Lee were 
not satisfied with Chen\'s performance. 
 
8. (C) Tien said he wondered what might have happened to Lee 
after he left the presidency that caused him to change so 
radically.  Tien explained that Lee was fully aware of the 
constraints on Taiwan in the international arena and moved 
extremely cautiously when dealing with the PRC.  Tien said 
when Lee appointed him to the National Unification Council 
Lee told him that he opposed Taiwan independence.  In fact, 
Tien asserted, during his tenure as president, Lee stated 
over 200 times that he opposed Taiwan independence.  Tien 
asked rhetorically, whether it was possible for a person to 
have concealed his true beliefs so well. 
 
Comment: Frustrated Professionals 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Tien\'s views are not atypical of the group of Lee 
Teng-hui holdovers who have fallen out with the Chen 
administration over the past two years.  These figures have 
often expressed frustration to AIT over the direction Taiwan 
is heading.  Tien and his peers have said they are 
increasingly exasperated by the DPP\'s amateur, 
election-obsessed approach to policy making, puzzled over Lee 
Teng-hui\'s transformation into a pro-independence 
fundamentalist, and disenchanted by the Pan-Blue leadership\'s 
willful refusal to face up to Taiwan\'s current political 
realities.  While this group played a critical role in 
Taiwan\'s democratization in the 1990s and later during the 
transition to DPP rule, most are now detaching themselves 
from the political discourse. 
 
Biographical note 
----------------- 
 
10. (C) Tien Hung-mao returned to Taipei from London in late 
November 2004.  Now without a government position, he resumed 
his position as chairman of the Institute for National Policy 
Research.  During this November 30 meeting, Tien repeatedly 
said that he had been in Taipei for only a few days, had not 
really contacted anyone yet, and not thought about what he 
might do next.  Tien might be surveying his options in 
Taiwan, but with an eye to returning to the US as soon as a 
\"respectable\" period of time has passed.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/08/2014 
TAGS: PGOV, TW 
SUBJECT: KAOHSIUNG MAYOR ON LY ELECTION AND CABINET CHANGES 
 
 
Classified By: ROBERT W. FORDEN, AIT KAOHSIUNG PRINCIPAL OFFICER. 
REASON:  1.5(d). 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) In a December 1 meeting with visiting AIT Director 
Paal, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh downplayed the possibility 
he would move to Taipei early next year to serve as Premier, 
suggesting that Yu Shyi-kun would continue in the position 
after the expected February cabinet reshuffle.  Hsieh said 
DPP Secretary General Chang Chun-hsiung would become the next 
Legislative Yuan (LY) Speaker.  Hsieh predicted the ruling 
party would achieve a majority of votes in the next LY by 
picking up support from independents and KMT defectors, even 
if the Pan-Green did not achieve a majority on its own. 
Hsieh estimated the DPP would win between 95-101 seats, 
including six in Kaohsiung, and the TSU 13-17, with the bulk 
of the Pan-Green gains coming in central and northern Taiwan, 
rather than the South.  Hsieh repeated familiar assertions 
that President Chen\'s more extreme and provocative remarks in 
the LY campaign were simply election rhetoric and that next 
year would present more opportunity for progress on 
cross-Strait issues.  End Summary. 
 
Hsieh Predicts Strong Gains for DPP in LY 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh (Hsieh Chang-ting), who is 
also one of the DPP\'s four LY campaign managers and 
Vice-Chairman of the ruling party, expressed optimism to 
visiting AIT Director Paal December 1 about Pan-Green 
prospects in the upcoming LY election.  Noting that he was 
being run ragged circling the island to participate in 
non-stop election events, Hsieh said he expected the DPP to 
make major gains in the upcoming election, taking at least 95 
seats and possibly as many as the 101 that President Chen had 
recently set as a goal. 
 
3. (C) Hsieh noted that, except for Kaohsiung County, the DPP 
was unlikely to pick up any seats in the south; most of the 
gains would come in the central region and to a lesser 
extent, the north.  In Kaohsiung City, Hsieh predicted the 
Pan-Green would win 6-8 of the 11 seats (Note: the Pan-Green 
won eight seats in 2001.  End Note.), with a higher number 
coming at the cost of the People-first Party (PFP) rather 
than the Kuomintang (KMT).  Hsieh noted that the DPP was 
taking some real gambles in a few places, such as Hsinchu and 
Miaoli, where the DPP had nominated two candidates but that 
there was as much possibility both could lose as there was 
that both could win. 
 
But TSU Falling Short 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C) The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), Hsieh said, was not 
likely to do as well as some had originally expected.  While 
former President Lee Teng-hui had originally predicted the 
TSU could pick up between 27-36 seats, latest estimates were 
 
SIPDIS 
that the TSU would win nor more than 13-17.  (Note: Polls 
taken later in the week by the DPP may have altered Hsieh\'s 
lower TSU estimate.  End note.) 
 
Sovereignty Issue Key to Mobilizing Base 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Hsieh said that the election turnout was likely to be 
low for Taiwan, around 65 percent, that there were few \"swing 
voters\" and that getting a large turnout of the Pan-Green 
base would be key.  In this context, the Taiwan \"sovereignty\" 
issue, highlighted by President Chen, was useful.  Vote 
allocation (\"pei-piao\") would also be a critical factor.  The 
DPP had used the strategy effectively in four previous 
elections.  He added that the Pan-Blue has had much less 
success with the tactic in recent elections, with many of its 
most popular candidates losing in 2001 due to zealous, but 
poorly coordinated, attempts to pei-piao. 
 
With or Without Majority, Ruling Party will Control LY 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6.  (C) Whether or not the Pan-Green achieves an LY majority 
in the election, Hsieh was confident the ruling party would 
obtain a majority with the help of sympathetic independents 
and renegade KMT members.  Given that LY reform would cut LY 
seats in half before the next election, many Pan-Blue LY 
members would assess that they were unlikely to get nominated 
next time and this would encourage them to cooperate with the 
ruling party to benefit from ruling party resources.  Hsieh 
noted, however, that the ruling party would likely find it 
difficult to manage the LY, even if it obtained a simple 
majority. 
 
Yu Shyi-kun Likely to Stay on as Premier 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) In response to a question about possible cabinet 
changes, which traditionally come with the formation of a new 
LY, Hsieh downplayed rumors that he was in line to replace Yu 
Shyi-kun as premier.  Hsieh said Yu had served for many years 
as a subordinate to President Chen, while Hsieh had always 
been a colleague on equal footing, implying that he would 
find it hard to work directly under Chen\'s authority.  Hsieh 
did state unequivocally that DPP Secretary General Chang 
Chun-hsiung would become the next Speaker of the LY, 
emphasizing that Wang Jyn-ping had no chance to stay on in 
that position. 
 
Chen Rhetoric, Just Campaigning 
------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Hsieh repeated familiar assertions that the more 
extreme and controversial statements of President Chen on 
constitutional reform and \"sovereignty\" issues in recent 
weeks were simply campaign rhetoric and should not be given 
too much weight.  Chen had assessed that voter turnout of the 
Pan-Green base was essential to obtaining a Pan-Green 
majority and that appeals to the more extreme \"green\" voters 
would help ensure that turnout.  Hsieh expected that next 
year would provide more opportunity for Chen to find ways to 
make progress in easing cross-Strait tensions, as there would 
be no more \"national-level\" elections for a couple of years. 
 
Hsieh in Minority Opposing Constitutional Reform 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
9.  (C) Personally, Hsieh said, he believed the DPP should be 
more confident in its dealings with China and not worry about 
criticism from Pan-Green fundamentalists.  He believed China 
does not want and cannot risk war, since it has far too many 
problems already with which it must deal.  Taiwan needs to 
find ways to achieve what it wants, but leave China with 
\"face\", by avoiding the appearance that it is abandoning the 
\"one China\" myth.  In fact, Hsieh said that he did not 
support the idea of changing Taiwan\'s constitution and 
believed Taiwan should just work within the \"one China\" theme 
that currently existed in its constitution.  Hsieh readily 
admitted he was in the minority in the DPP on this point, 
however. 
 
Comment: A Moderate DPP Candidate for President? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
10.  (C) Hsieh, a former DPP Chairman and Vice Presidential 
candidate, remains one of the DPP\'s most influential leaders 
and is a leading candidate to follow Chen in a bid for 
President.  However, he is also more moderate than Chen and 
clearly differs from Chen on a number of core issues, 
including constitutional reform.  Hsieh has been widely 
rumored to be a possible replacement for Yu Shyi-kun as 
premier in February, and before now had done little to 
contradict those rumors.  Why he is now, for the first time, 
downplaying the possibility is unclear.  It may simply be 
that the time is nearing for Chen to make a choice and Hsieh 
does not want to appear overly ambitious.  Or, a decision may 
have already been made to keep Yu on. 
 
11.  (C) Hsieh\'s predictions on the LY election are 
consistent with what we have heard from other high-level DPP 
officials and appear to reflect accurately the DPP\'s polls. 
His confidence that, with or without a majority, the 
Pan-Green will dominate the LY is also likely well-placed, 
since the ruling party\'s resources assure that many 
independents and even Pan-Blue LY members will find it 
difficult not to cut deals on discrete issues with the 
government. 
 
12.  (C) Hsieh\'s advice not to take President Chen\'s campaign 
rhetoric too seriously is something we have heard over and 
over again from DPP officials before each of the last several 
elections.  Unfortunately, Taiwan always seems to be in 
election campaign mode and we doubt next year, with National 
Assembly elections and local Magistrate and council races, 
will be any different.  In addition, Chen\'s \"campaign 
rhetoric\" rarely remains just that -- last year\'s campaign 
rhetoric on constitutional reform and referenda quickly 
became ruling party policy and, soon thereafter, law.

SUBJECT: \"CHINA TIMES\" EDITORIAL ON U.S.-TAIWAN 
RELATIONS 
 
 
Summary: The Chinese-language \"China Times\" ran an 
editorial Wednesday (12/08/04) discussing the 
confidence crisis in interactions between Taiwan and 
the United States following President Chen\'s recent 
remarks on the timetable for Taiwan\'s new constitution 
and the Taiwan government\'s plan to replace `China\' 
with `Taiwan\' in the names of all its overseas 
representative offices and state-owned enterprises. 
Full text translation of the editorial follows. 
 
\"Confidence Crisis in Taiwan-U.S. Interactions\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
editorialized (12/8): 
 
\"For two consecutive Sundays during campaign rallies 
for the legislative elections, President Chen Shui-bian 
has been throwing out a timetable for [Taiwan\'s] new 
constitution and the government\'s plan to replace 
`China\' with `Taiwan\' in the names of all its overseas 
representative offices and state-owned enterprises. 
Immediately following Chen\'s remarks, the U.S. State 
Department promptly gave its response during its 
regular news briefing the next Monday (Washington 
time).  With regard to [Chen\'s plan] to hold `a 
referendum on [Taiwan\'s] new constitution,\' State 
Department Spokesman Richard Boucher said the Monday 
before the last that the United States takes President 
Chen\'s Four No\'s pledge seriously and Chen has to offer 
a clarification regarding whether his remarks have 
violated his pledge.  As for Chen\'s latest remarks on 
Taiwan\'s name-change plan, State Department Deputy 
Spokesman Adam Ereli responded last Monday, in a more 
direct and impolite manner, [by saying] that regarding 
the name change, `Our view is, frankly speaking, we do 
not support it.\' 
 
\"Within just one week, the State Department addressed 
Chen\'s so-called campaign rhetoric by first asking him 
to clarify [his remarks] and then by clearly indicating 
that Washington does not support Taiwan\'s plan to 
change names because it believes this will unilaterally 
change the status quo of Taiwan.  As far as we can 
recall, the U.S. government has never made one response 
after another in such a short period of time with 
regard to the words and behaviors of an R.O.C. 
president.  Judging from the context of its responses, 
Washington was already very impolite and had gone 
beyond the [bounds of] international courtesy or 
protocol by asking in public for Chen\'s clarification 
the Monday before last.  This week, Washington\'s clear 
indication of its attitude of not supporting [Taiwan\'s 
name change] was [a type of response] rarely ever seen 
in the engagements of the international community. 
[Washington\'s response last Monday] can be viewed as a 
rough intervention with regard to Taiwan\'s domestic 
affairs and a public insult for the Republic of China, 
including President Chen himself. 
 
\"Why did the United States want to adopt such an 
unusual measure?  Why was it so strict with Taiwan? 
These are topics that require serious attention and 
reflection from the Taiwan people as well as President 
Chen.  The United States\' response was actually 
understandable if [we] analyze it under the large 
framework of the international situation.  To put it 
simply, in the face of a China whose national strength 
is on the rise, it is in the United States\' strategic 
interest to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan 
Strait; but under circumstances where Beijing will not 
renounce the use of force against Taiwan, Washington 
naturally will have to do whatever it can to prevent 
either side of the Taiwan Strait from altering the 
status quo so that the [cross-Strait] situation will 
not get out of hand and, as a result, drag the United 
States into a war. 
 
\"It is exactly because of such a consideration of its 
strategic interests [that] the United States not only 
will do all it can to ensure that the status quo will 
not be changed, but has also announced in public that 
whether the status quo is changed will be defined by 
the United States.  The State Department\'s public 
articulation yesterday clearly stating that it will not 
support Taiwan\'s name change is, in fact, a result of 
the United States\' subjective definition [of what 
constitutes a change in the status quo].  Washington 
believes that not only Taiwan\'s plan to change the name 
of its overseas representative offices, but also the 
move to replace `China\' with `Taiwan\' in the names of 
its state-owned enterprises, are attempts to change the 
status quo. 
 
\"Even though the underlying reasons for Washington\'s 
immediate responses to Chen\'s words and behaviors 
which, according to the United States, might result in 
a change in the status quo are the U.S. national 
interests and the tacit agreement it reached with 
Beijing after negotiations, it is still regrettable and 
embarrassing for Taiwan to see such a strict response 
from the United States.  Former President Lee Teng-hui 
got so angry that he even shot back with [the words:] 
`the United States is not Taiwan\'s father.\'  While 
feeling angry and embarrassed, what deserves our 
consideration is that even if the United States wants 
to respond, why can it not adopt a more indirect or 
gentle way but had to do it in such a straightforward 
manner and with total disregard for Taiwan\'s feelings? 
 
\"To find out the reason, we believe that the ultimate 
source of Washington\'s tough and direct attitude is 
that over the past few years, our leaders have more 
than once exhausted the United States\' confidence in 
and goodwill toward Taiwan.  Let\'s first put aside what 
happened earlier when former President Lee paid a visit 
to Cornell University and [spoke of] his `special state- 
to-state relationship\' doctrine that he had given no 
warning about to Washington in advance.  During the 
four years of the Bush administration, Chen\'s doctrine 
of `one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait\' and 
his insistence on holding a referendum by using 
loopholes both triggered new tensions across the Taiwan 
Strait and thus put the United States under heavy 
pressure from Beijing.  The remarks, behaviors, and 
policies of [Taiwan\'s] former and incumbent leaders 
have woven into a picture of which the surface is 
Taiwan\'s consciousness of its sovereignty while 
internally it is actually moving towards Taiwan 
independence and building a new country.  Such a 
picture, as seen in the eyes of the United States, is 
exactly an attempt to change the status quo.  As a 
result, even though the United States has reiterated 
its basic stand that it does not support Taiwan 
independence and is opposed to any attempt by either 
side [of the Taiwan Strait] to change the status quo, 
it obviously felt that it has not done enough.  Finally 
it has to use a preventive diplomatic approach to adopt 
a more severe standard for judging if the status quo 
has been changed.  [What the United States] looks into 
is not only whether the move has really changed the 
status quo; instead, it will clearly and firmly stop 
any attempt to change the status quo by either side 
just to take precautions. 
 
\"After Chen announced a timetable for Taiwan\'s new 
constitution, Washington asked publicly for Chen\'s 
clarification.  Chen\'s only argument was that the new 
constitution might not possibly pass the threshold of 
the Legislative Yuan.  Washington said this week that 
it does not support Taiwan\'s name changes, believing 
that [the plan] is a move to change the status quo. 
This time it was Taiwan\'s premier and the Presidential 
Office that responded [to Washington], stressing that 
the plan is merely meant to highlight Taiwan\'s entity 
and it has nothing to do with changing the status quo. 
We are not sure whether such an explanation will 
satisfy the United States.  But it is certain that the 
United States\' confidence in Taiwan is quickly eroding 
and its goodwill is obviously gone.  Now the United 
States can only closely monitor the words and behaviors 
of Taiwan\'s leaders as if it is guarding against a 
thief; it has to make immediate and necessary responses 
and has no time to judge whether its manner is rough 
and strict or not. 
 
\"After we analyze the pattern of the latest interaction 
between the United States and Taiwan, which, in a way, 
demonstrates the difficult situation Taiwan is in, we 
cannot help but ponder why the Taiwan-U.S. interaction 
has changed this way.  Who has caused it and who has 
made it happen?  Doesn\'t Taiwan have a better way of 
expressing itself other than acting and pushing 
recklessly?  Can Chen take on all the consequences of 
his pushing the envelope?  Or will it be all the Taiwan 
people who have to shoulder the consequences?\"

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
A) \"An Expected Scheme: A Lie That Takes Several Years 
to Finish Saying It\" 
 
An editorial in the conservative, pro-unification 
\"United Daily News\" commented (12/8): 
 
\". [T]his constitutional storm will last through 
President Chen\'s whole second term.  The prices to be 
paid within and outside the country are unpredictable. 
The result is very likely that the Republic of China 
will split again but the national name still cannot be 
changed .. 
 
\"It is clear now that this constitutional reform plan 
will definitely become a swindle.  President Chen has 
said many lies in his four and a half year presidency. 
Many of his words have been proved to be lies. 
However, even though the idea of `name rectification 
and a new constitution\' or `constitutional reform\' has 
lingered for several years, now is not the end yet. 
The expected expiration time for this lie can be as 
late as 2008 at least.  Therefore, in spite of the fact 
that it will prove to be a scheme after all, President 
Chen cannot be prevented from continuing to tell this 
lie and finishing this well-known scheme in 2008.\" 
 
B) \"The United States Must Not Deprive Taiwan People\'s 
Rights to Conduct a Referendum on `Taiwan 
Independence\'\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
editorialized (12/4): 
 
\". The current situation goes like this: every time 
Washington reminds President Chen Shui-bian to stick to 
his `four No\'s\' pledge, Chen will reply that [his 
pledge] `remains unchanged and will not be changed 
during his term of office.\'  But after a while, Chen 
will turn his head and start to throw out various 
issues like `to change Taiwan\'s national emblem,\' `to 
break the bird-cage-like referendum law,\' `to institute 
Taiwan\'s first new constitution,\' and `don\'t think that 
I dare not hold a referendum on Taiwan independence.\' 
His moves, as a result, has forced the United States to 
remind him again of the `four No\'s\' pledge.  Such a 
cycle has repeated itself more than ten times over the 
past few years. 
 
\"Such a cycle shows that the United States\' attempt to 
curb Taiwan independence simply by restraining 
President Chen is doomed to fail.  For Chen, he can 
continue pledging the `four No\'s\' policy while at the 
same time manipulating the Taiwan independence issue. 
All he needs to do is just repeat his `four No\'s\' 
pledge to the United States again and again.  In the 
end, the only effect that will be achieved from 
Washington\'s disallowing Chen to hold a `referendum on 
Taiwan independence\' will be to save Chen the trouble 
of having to face the test of Taiwan\'s public opinion 
directly, while he can continue manipulating his route 
to step on the edge of Taiwan independence.  In other 
words, the United States\' move to deprive the Taiwan 
people\'s right to conduct a referendum on Taiwan 
independence will not only fail to restrain Chen from 
manipulating [the] Taiwan independence [issue], but the 
move itself will also become a political rampart to 
provide shelter for Chen to manipulate Taiwan 
independence. . 
 
\"Now Taiwan\'s democracy has developed to a stage that 
the most critical and the last issue about its 
democracy and constitutional rule is whether it wants 
to declare Taiwan independence and establish a new 
country.  Washington thought it could curb the Taiwan 
independence [movement] by restraining Chen, but in the 
end, it turns out that the democratic constitutional 
rule of the Republic of China has been kidnapped by the 
ever-changing [manipulation] of the Taiwan independence 
[issue].  Actually all the United States has to do is 
to decide what position it will take and what it will 
do once Taiwan declares independence, and it can leave 
everything to the Taiwan people to decide via a 
democratic and constitutional procedure.  Instead, the 
situation nowadays is that the United States has become 
a political rampart for those who manipulate the Taiwan 
independence [issue], and the Republic of China has 
lost its normal constitutional rule and real democracy! 
 
\"The United States has failed to stop President Chen 
from continuing to manipulate the Taiwan independence 
[issue], and it has deprived the Taiwan people\'s rights 
to say no to being manipulated by Chen and the Taiwan 
independence [issue].  Washington thought once it puts 
Chen under control, it could control Taiwan 
independence, too.  But such a misjudgment has taken 
away the rights of 23 million Taiwan people to 
seriously face the Taiwan independence issue and 
jointly make a democratic public decision on the issue. 
The current situation shows that not only has the 
United States failed to control Chen, but it has also 
become the protector of Chen and Taiwan independence. 
Not only so, [the United States] has also made all the 
Taiwan people, the constitution of the Republic of 
China, and Taiwan\'s democracy hostages kidnapped by 
Chen and Taiwan independence.  Is this the ending that 
the United States has hoped and arranged for Taiwan?\" 
 
C) \"Only by Insisting on Democracy and Self- 
Determination Can Taiwan\'s Sovereignty Be Secured\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" commented in an 
editorial (12/4): 
 
\". Honestly speaking, it is completely Taiwan\'s 
domestic affair for the Taiwan people to act in 
accordance with a democratic procedure to institute a 
new constitution, establish a country based on their 
ideals, and select a name for their country that they 
can identify with.  These moves are also in accordance 
with the principle of self-determination stipulated in 
the United Nations\' Charter.  Judging from the 
perspective of democracy, all democratic countries 
should be happy to see such developments.  Take the 
United States as an example: Washington\'s continuous 
arms sales to Taiwan and its assistance in deterring 
attacks from China against Taiwan are equivalent to 
recognizing Taiwan as a country independent of the 
People\'s Republic of China.  It is such a paradox, 
however, that the United States currently does not 
recognize the R.O.C. but only recognizes Taiwan 
according to the `Taiwan Relations Act.\'  Moreover, 
because of China, the United States persuades Taiwan 
not to change the name of its country or to call itself 
Taiwan.  China, on the other hand, threatens Taiwan not 
to change the name of its country and also forbids the 
use of the name R.O.C. in the international community. 
Viewed from this perspective, isn\'t the United States a 
hostage of China\'s hegemonic discourse? .\" 
 
D) \"Taiwan Must Not Fear China\'s Intimidation When It 
Carries out the Plan to Rectify Its Name and to 
Institute a Constitution\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" said in a separate 
editorial (12/6): 
 
\". Currently, the countries that are most sensitive to 
Taiwan\'s move to rectify its name are, without doubt, 
China, and the United States that is misguided by 
China.  China\'s over-bearing attitude towards Taiwan 
has nothing to do with the name Taiwan uses [to call 
itself] but has a lot to do with whether Taiwan 
recognizes itself as a part of China.  This is not an 
issue that can be discussed rationally.  As a 
democratic nation, however, the United States should 
not follow China\'s lead and oppress Taiwan in a way 
that violates international customs and the U.N. 
charter.  ... [A]ccording to the Taiwan Relations Act, 
Taiwan is viewed as a legal subject by the United 
States.  Under such circumstances, isn\'t the United 
States, which is kidnapped by China\'s politics and, 
thus, questions Taiwan\'s rectification of its name via 
a democratic procedure, stuck in a predicament? .\"

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
 
A) \"Repetitive Bumping on U.S.-Taiwan Relations Results 
in Tighter Inhibition; Washington Measures Promoting a 
Referendum and Changing Taiwan\'s Name with Different 
Standards; One Needs to Evaluate the Price of Reckless 
Moves\" 
 
Washington Correspondent Liu Ping of the pro-status quo 
\"China Times\" wrote (12/8): 
 
\". The referendum issue was an unpleasant experience 
for the two sides.  This time, although the United 
States has made it clear, there is but three days left 
before the balloting day.  Can Taiwan put the brakes on 
now?  After the State Department statement, President 
Chen said `the United States is conveying China\'s 
objection.\'  Despite this being a campaign statement, 
it can widen the gap between the two countries and even 
be seen as an insult to the United States.  On the 
other hand, while the U.S. officials in charge [of 
foreign affairs] are in a transitional period, it is a 
trial of how to continue to control by powerful 
measures a horse that is about to run wild. 
 
\". Recent developments have made the United States more 
and more frustrated.  Its trust in the Taipei 
authorities is getting less and less.  Therefore, the 
United States has used up all the terms it can use to 
the limits of diplomatic terminology. 
 
\". Commenting on the name changing issue, a senior 
diplomat once said, `our final goal is to resume 
diplomatic relations and re-open an embassy.\'  However, 
with the deterioration of cross-Strait relations, can 
it be easier to change Taiwan\'s name as setting up an 
embassy is impossible?\" 
 
B) \"Whether It Is a Campaign Statement or Not, 
Washington Takes All of Them Seriously; It Monitors 
Chen\'s Words and Deeds and Has Reacted Promptly and 
Precisely This Time; The Media Did Not Ask for the 
Answer; It Is a Prepared Warning\" 
 
Vincent Chang, Washington correspondent of the 
conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
commented (12/8): 
 
\". In a way, the channels for U.S.-Taiwan 
communications are still working well.  But 
Washington\'s attitude has totally changed.  It no 
longer believes that Chen Shui-bian is only saying 
things not to be taken seriously.  Recent State 
Department reactions can be said [to be] the result of 
close `monitoring\' by the United States of Taiwan\'s 
rhetoric and moves rather than `close communications\' 
between the United States and Taiwan. 
 
\". President Chen may be making `real or false\' 
comments.  But Washington\'s approach now is to treat 
him the way he treats others.  Whether President Chen 
means it or not, whether it is `campaign rhetoric\' or 
sausage-cutting `campaign promises,\' all are being 
taken seriously [by Washington]. 
 
\"The reason is that the Bush administration has learned 
over the past four years that only when Washington 
takes seriously what President Chen says, will Chen 
`take seriously\' Washington\'s reaction.  He cannot use 
election campaigning as an excuse to justify everything 
and ask the United States to be `understanding\' 
anymore.\" 
 
C) \"The United States\' Continued Constraint of Taiwan 
Democracy Is Sending the Wrong Messages to China\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Taiwan Daily\" editorialized 
(12/8): 
 
\". In the past, no one paid much attention to the names 
of organizations such as China Steel Corp., China 
Petroleum Corp., China Shipbuilding Corp., China 
Airlines, and the International Commercial Bank of 
China.  On one hand, it is because nobody dared to 
question the names under the past authoritative system. 
On the other hand, it is because Chinese enterprises 
were not in the international arena yet.  All these 
things have changed now.  There is no reason to cherish 
the outmoded .. The United States has taken as its duty 
the promotion of freedom, democracy, and human rights 
all over the world.  But it is really a huge irony that 
the United States is criticizing Taiwan\'s efforts 
toward these goals and making Taiwan\'s democratization 
more difficult.\" 
 
D) \"Promoting Name Changes Is a Move Reflecting 
Taiwan\'s Mainstream Public Opinion, Not a Change of the 
Status Quo\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" commented in an 
editorial (12/8): 
 
\". We have to lodge the strongest protest to the U.S. 
government for some inappropriate parts of the U.S. 
policy toward Taiwan and U.S. official remarks that 
overstep their capacity and interfere in Taiwan\'s 
domestic affairs. Taiwan is an independent sovereign 
state, and this is the status quo. Any changes in the 
nation\'s name, national flag, national anthem or 
campaign for name rectification should not be regarded 
as a change to the status quo. Instead, they are moves 
that [match] Taiwan\'s mainstream public opinion to 
`match reality\' and make Taiwan a normal country. 
 
\". It is unacceptable that the United States regards 
plans to change the names of Taiwan\'s state-owned 
companies as a change of Taiwan\'s status and will not 
support the plans. Frankly speaking, Taiwan is no 
colony of any country, and outsiders cannot interfere 
with our internal affairs. Opinions from friends can be 
used for reference, but [regarding doing] the right 
thing that is supported by the public, Taiwan should go 
ahead and do it. There\'s no need to care about the 
opposition and criticism from outside.\" 
 
E) \"Taiwan\' Means What It Says\" 
 
An editorial of pro-unification, English-language 
\"Taipei Times\" said (12/8): 
 
\". There is no need for the State Department to be so 
nervous. It seems that as soon as Taiwan mentions a new 
constitution or title of convenience, their officials 
fear a declaration of independence is imminent. 
Taiwanese democracy operates on the strength of the 
same mechanisms as many other democratic countries. All 
matters concerning national sovereignty must be 
approved by the legislature, so President Chen Shui- 
bian and the government are hardly likely to adopt the 
autocratic methods so loved by earlier Chinese 
Nationalist Party (KMT) administrations. 
 
\"Changing the names of state-run enterprises, on the 
other hand, is a purely domestic matter and the US has 
no basis on which it can interfere. As for the names of 
private enterprises, not even Taiwan\'s government can 
interfere with such commercial decisions. 
 
\"Attempts to change the name of Taiwan date back to 
1979 when the Taiwan Relations Act came into force. At 
that time the KMT even protested that the name Taiwan 
was being used to refer to the Republic of China (ROC). 
So, if `Taiwan\' is now used to stand in for `ROC\' in 
other contexts, the US really has no reason to object. 
If it does, it might be usefully asked to refer to its 
own law books. 
 
\"There is nothing unreasonable about a new constitution 
that redefines this nation\'s territories as those which 
it actually controls, namely Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and 
Matsu. Similarly, any reasonable person would welcome 
the name `Taiwan\' as a replacement for all of the 
peculiar titles under which this country has labored so 
that people can differentiate between Taiwan and China 
at a glance.\"

1. (C) Summary: Heading into the last few days of the 
Legislative Yuan (LY) campaign, little change is expected 
overall in Taiwan\'s southern districts, the Pan-Green\'s 
traditional stronghold.  Southern Democratic Progressive 
Party (DPP) officials say the party already reached the point 
of \"saturation\" in the 2001 election and assess that there is 
little territory to be gained.  Tactical maneuvers in areas 
such as nomination strategy and \"peipiao\" vote allocation 
schemes will likely result in gains and losses in individual 
districts, but overall these will probably even out, giving 
neither side a significant net gain in the south.  The real 
battlegrounds in this year\'s contest for control of the LY 
will be in northern and central Taiwan.  End Summary. 
 
KMT/DPP Balance Not Likely to Change in Chiayi 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (C) Chiayi City\'s two seats are currently divided between 
the DPP and the Kuomintang (KMT) and both incumbents are 
running for reelection.  The KMT\'s Huang Ming-hui seems 
assured of keeping his seat, because the People First Party 
(PFP)\'s decision not to field a candidate means he faces no 
serious competition for the Pan-Blue share of the vote.  In 
contrast the DPP\'s incumbent, former Formosa TV Chairman 
Trong Chai (Tsai Tong-rong), faces an unusual Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU) rival for the Pan-Green vote.  The 
TSU\'s Ling Tzu-chu is an attractive, well-spoken 
 
SIPDIS 
second-generation Mainlander and retired military officer who 
now owns an English cram school and runs a radio station. 
However Chai, also an outspoken advocate for Taiwan 
independence, seems likely to be able to fend off this threat 
and keep his seat. 
 
3. (C) Three of Chiayi County\'s four seats are currently held 
by the DPP, and the KMT\'s decision to run three newcomers 
means it will likely stay that way.  Of the three, Weng 
Chung-chun, who has the endorsement of the incumbent, is the 
only one expected to win.  Even the KMT County Chairman, Huan 
Chung-hsien, acknowledges that the other two nominees are 
long-shots, as the party has only \"enough votes for one and a 
half candidates.\"  DPP incumbent Chang Hua-guan and newcomer 
Lin Kuo-chin are widely expected to win, but the other DPP 
incumbent, Tsai Chi-fang, is in danger of losing to Ho 
Jing-sung, an incumbent DPP maverick running for the 
Non-partisan Solidarity Union (NSU), or to the TSU\'s nominee. 
 
Tainan City Incumbents All Safe 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Observers on both sides expect that all six of Tainan 
City\'s incumbents will win re-election, maintaining the 
current 4-2 Pan-Green advantage.  The three DPP candidates 
and one TSU candidate agreed early in the campaign to 
distribute votes in a \"peipiao\" vote allocation strategy, 
which they believe will assure them of victory (See Ref A for 
more on the importance of \"peipiao\").  The KMT\'s two nominees 
also seem on track for reelection.  The biggest variable, 
however, will be the performance of the PFP\'s nominee, Kao 
Szo-po.  Because the Pan-Blue have not settled on an 
inter-party peipiao scheme, it is unlikely Kao will be able 
to take one of the Pan-Green seats.  He is far more likely to 
displace one of the KMT nominees, but his chances of even 
that are slim because of the PFP\'s unpopularity in Tainan. 
 
DPP May Lose a Seat in Tainan County ... 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The DPP seems unlikely to repeat its surprise success 
in the last election in winning five of the eight Tainan 
County LY seats.  At that time, the KMT heavily 
overnominated, and four of its six candidates lost by just a 
few thousand votes each.  This time, the KMT hopes to take 
back some of that territory by nominating only four 
candidates.  Additionally, Lee Ho-Shun, an at-large KMT 
legislator who failed to get renominated, is running under 
the NSU banner.  The DPP nominated all four incumbents (the 
fifth seat was vacated by Mark Chen when he was appointed 
Foreign Minister) as well as one newcomer.  Most observers 
expect the county to split 4-4 this time because of the KMT\'s 
conservative nomination strategy.  However, the current 5-3 
Pan-Green advantage might be maintained if the PFP nominee 
diverts enough votes from KMT candidates to give a seat to 
the dark-horse TSU candidate, college professor Tseng 
Hsing-chao. 
 
... And One or Two More in Kaohsiung City 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The Pan-Green is even less likely to repeat its 
impressive 2001 victory in Kaohsiung City, where captured 
eight of eleven LY seats.  As in Tainan, the Pan-Green\'s 
success in Kaohsiung was largely a result of the Pan-Blue\'s 
mistakes, including reckless overnomination.  This time the 
KMT and PFP have nominated more conservatively and the 
Pan-Green will struggle just to hold onto seven seats.  It 
could drop to six or even five if its \"peipiao\" strategy is 
not implemented well.  Lately, some of the leading candidates 
in both the DPP and the TSU have begun complaining about 
their parties\' widely-publicized peipiao plans. 
Additionally, there are two Pan-Green leaning independents 
who are doing well in the polls and who might undermine 
support for the DPP and TSU.  However, the Pan-Blue is not 
widely expected to make large gains because it faces threats 
from ex-KMT mavericks and independents as well.  It seems 
therefore that the most probable outcome is for the DPP and 
TSU to lose a seat or two, but more likely to Pan-Green 
 
SIPDIS 
leaning independents rather than to the KMT or PFP.  These 
will, then, likely vote with the Pan-Green once the LY 
convenes. 
 
Big Gains for DPP in Kaohsiung County 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) The Pan-Green faces nearly the opposite situation in 
Kaohsiung County (Ref B), which is currently split 5-4 in 
favor of the Pan-Blue.  In 2001, poor nomination strategy and 
vote distribution lost the DPP two seats to the KMT that it 
might otherwise have won.  This year the DPP is expected to 
do a much better job allocating votes among its five 
candidates and will likely get all of them, plus one TSU 
candidate elected.  These gains will come largely at the 
expense of the KMT\'s three nominees, of whom only one is 
likely to be reelected.  The PFP\'s two candidates, with solid 
bases of support in the ethnic Mainlander and Hakka 
communities, are expected to keep their seats. 
 
Musical Chairs in Pingtung - DPP May Lose a Seat 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
8. (C) Rural Pingtung County\'s declining population resulted 
in a reduction from seven to six seats.  Observers on both 
sides think the loss will likely come at the expense of the 
DPP, which currently holds four seats, despite its best 
efforts at peipiao.  The KMT\'s two seats are considered 
safer, although party officials worry that their nominee Wu 
Chin-lin might be negatively affected by the scandal 
surrounding his brother, a former Magistrate hiding from a 
corruption conviction.  Independent incumbent Tsai Hao, a 
local cable television mogul widely rumored to have links to 
organized crime, is still expected to take the last seat 
despite a recent indictment for vote-buying in the 2001 LY 
election. 
 
Taitung and Penghu Will Remain Blue 
----------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Taitung County\'s one seat is occupied by KMT 
legislator Huang Chien-ting.  Few observers doubt that he 
will win reelection, despite the surprise decision of the 
Magistrate to defect from the PFP to the DPP and subsequently 
endorse the DPP LY candidate, Hsu Jui-kuei, who himself 
defected from the PFP earlier this year.  The situation in 
Penghu County is similar.  The incumbent there is Lin 
Pin-kun, a former KMT member running under the NSU banner 
with unofficial KMT support.  Lin was ejected from the KMT 
after being sentenced to 15 years for corruption in 1998, but 
because of appeals and other legal delays, he has yet to 
serve his sentence.  Despite this, few observers outside the 
DPP campaign office expect him to lose his seat to the DPP 
challenger. 
Comment: No Big Gains to be Made in South 
----------------------------------------- 
10. (C) Comment: DPP dominance in most of southern Taiwan was 
established years ago and is now at a point of \"saturation.\" 
Further gains for the Pan-Green in the south are likely to be 
difficult to achieve.  The remaining Pan-Blue vote resides in 
distinct demographic groups, such as Mainlanders, retired 
government and state-enterprise workers, etc. that will be 
difficult to move away from their close and long-standing 
ties to the KMT.  The DPP seems to have realized this and 
nominated relatively conservatively in most southern 
districts, seeking only to defend the territory it currently 
holds.  The major exception to this is Kaohsiung County, 
where the DPP is trying to capture two seats it lost in the 
last election due to bad vote allocation.  This likely gain 
will be offset by probable losses in other districts like 
Tainan County and Kaohsiung City, where the KMT is making up 
for past overnomination blunders.  With the exception of such 
tactical maneuvering, however, the major battles for control 
of the LY in this campaign will be fought in northern and 
central Taiwan, and not in the south.

1. (C) Summary: President Chen Shui-bian has reacted sharply 
to the State Department Deputy Spokesman\'s December 6 warning 
over Chen\'s plans to rename state-owned firms and overseas 
representative offices using \"Taiwan.\"  On the campaign 
trail, Chen has accused the USG of carrying water for Beijing 
and boasted that he will proceed with his name change plans 
regardless of U.S. or PRC objections.  Chen has also drawn 
parallels between his determination to stand up to pressure 
from Washington and Beijing over the name change issue and 
his defense of his constitution plan during and after the 
presidential election campaign.  Chen\'s aides claim that they 
were surprised over the strong USG reaction to Chen\'s name 
change proposal, and insist that Washington simply fails to 
grasp the domestic setting behind Chen\'s statement. 
Pro-independence supporters of the president have publicly 
accused the USG of a double standard and interfering in 
Taiwan\'s internal affairs.  Democratic Progressive Party 
(DPP) moderates say they understand the strong USG reaction, 
but assert that if Chen\'s hard-line rhetoric succeeds in 
limiting the post-election power base of the Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU), it will help stabilize cross-Strait 
relations in the medium term.  End Summary. 
 
Beijing\'s Mouthpiece? 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a series of campaign appearances on December 7-8, 
President Chen Shui-bian openly criticized the State 
Department Deputy Spokesman\'s December 6 warning over Chen\'s 
pledge to change the name of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) 
and Taiwan overseas offices (Ref A).  On December 7, Chen 
told a crowd in Tainan City that the State Department was 
speaking on Beijing\'s behalf, as it did regarding the 
constitution issue during the presidential election.  Chen 
asserted that people were frightened by U.S. warnings over 
unilateral changes to the status quo during the last election 
campaign.  However, Chen boasted that he stayed the course 
anyway, adding that \"just because Beijing opposes something 
doesn\'t mean we don\'t dare to do it.\" 
 
3. (C) In sharp contrast to the repeated public assurances 
that Taiwan would work to protect cross-Strait stability and 
the status quo that followed the State Department\'s November 
29 public warning over the constitution (Ref B), the December 
6 statement led Chen to raise the level of his anti-China 
rhetoric.  Chen told the Tainan audience that one of his 
post-election responsibilities would be to \"clarify for the 
international community the differences between China 
(Zhongguo) and Taiwan.\"  He also reiterated his intention to 
apply for UN membership under the title \"Taiwan\" (Ref C).  At 
a rally in Taipei City the following day, Chen said that \"as 
long as we recognize that Taiwan is our name, and we say this 
loud and clear, we don\'t need to worry, we don\'t need to fear 
-- China (Zhonggong) has tried to use scare tactics before.\" 
Chen continued, \"throughout Taiwan\'s democratization process, 
from the start of legislative elections, to the direct 
election of the president, to the change in party power, to 
the referendum, when has China ever expressed support?  When 
have they ever not threatened us?\" 
 
Official Spin(s) 
---------------- 
 
4. (C) Privately, Chen aides say they were surprised by the 
speed and toughness of the USG response.  During a December 8 
lunch with the AIT Director, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) 
Chairman Joseph Wu defended the president\'s initiatives as 
being purely domestic in nature.  Wu said that the names of 
SOEs like China Petroleum have long caused \"confusion\" among 
Taiwan\'s populace.  Wu asserted that changing the names of 
state-controlled institutions was fundamentally different 
from altering Taiwan\'s legal definitions.  When the Director 
noted that the USG took a very different view of the issue, 
Wu insisted that it was Taiwan\'s right to rename its 
government-controlled institutions anyway.  This sentiment 
was echoed in public comments by leaders of the DPP\'s 
pro-independence wing, including Presidential Advisor Koo 
Kuang-ming and Wu\'s uncle, Presidential Advisor Wu Li-pei. 
Koo denounced the U.S. for arrogantly interfering in Taiwan\'s 
internal affairs while Wu cited the name \"American Institute 
in Taiwan\" to chide the USG for double standards on the 
nomenclature issue. 
5. (C) A number of Chen aides have also suggested in both 
public and private that the USG must have been misinformed 
over the context of the president\'s December 5 remarks. 
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary General James Huang told 
AIT that he did not expect the USG to take Chen\'s name change 
initiative so seriously.  If he had, Huang continued, he 
would have contacted AIT to put the comments in context. 
Huang asserted that the name change portion of Chen\'s remarks 
was only one small part of what was otherwise an extremely 
moderate message.  The most important element of Chen\'s 
speech, Huang continued, was the president\'s characterization 
of his role as the \"balancer\" within Taiwan\'s political 
world.  Huang stated that when the president decided on the 
contents of his December 5 speech, his sole concern was to 
craft a message that would deprive Lee Teng-hui of the 
ability to seize the election agenda with his demands for a 
de jure change in the national title.  Huang said the name 
change for foreign missions theme was decided upon because it 
was part of an ongoing policy effort the DPP inherited from 
the KMT government.  Huang added that the Saturday strategy 
session considered, then rejected, the idea of repeating 
Chen\'s call to enter the UN under the \"Taiwan\" title as too 
sensitive.  Foreign Minister Mark Chen told the AIT Director 
that he and Vice President Annette Lu objected to the UN 
proposal. (Comment: Despite warnings from his advisors on 
December 4, Chen apparently decided that the issue was not 
sensitive enough to avoid repeating on December 7.  End 
Comment). 
 
Plea for Patience 
----------------- 
 
6. (C) Senior officials in the DPP\'s moderate New Tide 
Faction tell AIT they fully understand the USG\'s concerns 
over Chen\'s name change proposal, but urge Washington to have 
patience.  Executive Yuan (EY) Research, Development, and 
Evaluation (RDEC) Council Vice Minister Chen Chun-lin told 
AIT that Chen\'s lurch to the left in the final weeks of the 
campaign could serve the interests of medium term stability. 
\"If we can keep the TSU to less than 15 seats, they will be 
marginalized in the upcoming constitutional reform debate,\" 
Chen assessed.  However, he warned that if the TSU did much 
better than that, \"they could drive the agenda in dangerous 
ways.\"  New Tide elder and Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation 
(TSEC) Chairman Wu Nai-jen offered a similar assessment.  He 
asserted that if the DPP has the upper hand in the balance of 
LY seats, it could force the TSU into a formal coalition 
government that would require the TSU to defer to the DPP on 
issues like constitutional reform and cross-Strait relations. 
 
AIT Response: Not the Messenger but the Message 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (C) AIT has pushed back against accusations that the USG 
is over-exaggerating the significance of \"election talk\" and 
fails to grasp Taiwan\'s domestic political dynamics.   In 
meetings with senior Chen administration officials, AIT has 
noted that supposedly \"empty campaign rhetoric\" from the last 
election on referenda and constitutional reform has evolved 
into major policy initiatives.  AIT has also reminded Chen 
administration officials of the president\'s own promises 
early in the campaign to avoid provocative campaign language 
that could endanger post-election prospects for renewing 
cross-Strait dialogue.  Japanese Interchange Association 
(JIA) Deputy Director Hiroto Hirakoba told AIT that his 
office has delivered a similar message to Chen administration 
officials over the past several days.  Hirakoba expressed 
amazement at Chen\'s willingness to damage his relationship 
with the USG for the sake of a few votes on December 11. 
 
Comment: Willful Disregard 
-------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Chen has apparently decided that solidifying his dark 
Green base on December 11 and establishing name change as a 
core element in the DPP\'s post-election agenda is more 
important than rebuilding his relationship with Washington. 
Or, he may calculate he can weather the storm, arguing as Lee 
Teng-hui has done this week, that the U.S. has no choice but 
to support Chen and Taiwan.  Chen\'s prickly reaction to the 
Deputy Spokesman\'s December 6 statement largely mirrors his 
initial reaction to President Bush\'s December 9, 2003 warning 
over changing the status quo.  As he did with his 
constitution and referendum initiatives last year, Chen has 
used campaign remarks to introduce an issue that will outlast 
the current election campaign.  While more spin is likely to 
follow, the fundamental policy course has clearly been set. 
Moderates in the DPP may hope that a poor TSU showing on 
Saturday will quiet voices on the extreme left.  However, 
given Chen\'s self-proclaimed role as the \"balancer\" of 
Taiwan\'s political process, it is unlikely that he will want 
to see the demise of the party that best represents his own 
ideological roots.

1. (C) Summary: The projected shift in the balance of power 
between the Pan-Green and Pan-Blue camps in the Legislative 
Yuan (LY) reflects changing electoral dynamics within 
Taiwan\'s five main regions.  In the north the two sides will 
likely split the vote as they did in the last LY elections 
held in 2001.  The Hakka districts and central Taiwan, in 
comparison, are where the Pan-Green is poised to make the 
biggest gains and where the contest is being played out most 
fiercely.   The south continues to be dark Green and the 
Pan-Green will have difficulty further whittling down the 
already meager Pan-Blue presence.  The smaller east coast 
districts, outlying islands, and the aborigine vote continue 
under Pan-Blue domination, although the Pan-Green could make 
some minor inroads. End Summary. 
 
Pan-Green Seeking to Capitalize on Presidential Gains 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2. (C) Having made large gains in traditionally Pan-Blue 
strongholds during the presidential election earlier this 
year, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) hopes to parlay 
that support into a majority in the LY.  Although most 
analysts place the Pan-Green about three seats shy of a 
majority, the Green is likely to deprive the Pan-Blue of its 
current majority (See Reftel for an overview of the 
island-wide numbers).  The Pan-Green has run a well 
orchestrated campaign.  Although it could be hurt by 
overnominations in the north, it is likely to hold its 
commanding lead in the south and erode most of the Pan-Blue 
advantage in the Hakka districts and central Taiwan, where it 
picked up 40 and 50 percent, respectively, of the popular 
vote in the presidential election this year.  In comparison, 
the Pan-Blue has nominated conservatively, but is suffering 
from organizational challenges and renegade candidates that 
will siphon off traditionally Blue votes. 
 
Northern Taiwan: Splitting the Big Prize 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) With a total of 48 seats in Taipei County (28 seats, 
one more than the last election) and Taipei City (20 seats), 
northern Taiwan has been a site of fierce fighting.  The 
north, nevertheless, appears likely to repeat the 2001 split 
between the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green, going 24-23 in the Blue\'s 
favor with one independent.  In Taipei County (but not city) 
the Pan-Blue parties have shown remarkable restraint in 
coordinating their nominations, resulting in a strong slate 
of candidates.  The Pan-Green, by contrast, has nominated 
aggressively in all northern districts, hoping to get closer 
to their goal of a majority.  With successful vote 
distribution in Taipei County, the Pan-Green might be able to 
take an extra seat, but it seems more likely that the 
unusually disciplined Pan-Blue will win an additional seat or 
two, shifting the balance in the county from its current 
14-13 favoring the Pan-Green to a 14-14 split or even 13-15. 
Equally under pressure in Taipei City, the Pan-Green will be 
struggling to preserve its 9 seats while the Pan-Blue is 
likely to win 10 seats and may pick up one more at the DPP\'s 
expense, with the last seat going to a Blue-leaning 
independent. 
 
The Hakka Districts: DPP Eating Away at Blue Advantage 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4. (C) Heavily populated by the ethnic Hakka minority, the 
counties of Taoyuan (13 seats), Hsinchu (3 seats), and Miaoli 
(4 seats) and the city of Hsinchu (3 seats) hold a total of 
23 seats and have been the focus of the DPP administration\'s 
efforts to expand beyond its ethnic Taiwanese base.  The 
DPP\'s campaign to recruit more Hakka grass-roots support and 
promote Hakka cultural events yielded marked gains in the 
presidential election this year and will likely translate 
into more legislative seats on December 11.  In Taoyuan 
County the DPP is poised to gain one seat at the expense of 
the People First Party (PFP), which will lose one or two 
seats, reducing the current 8-5 Pan-Blue advantage to 7-6. 
In Hsinchu and Miaoli Counties the DPP has a good chance of 
improving upon its previous performance, reversing the 2-1 
Pan-Blue lead in Hsinchu to 1-2 and reducing the 3-1 Pan-Blue 
advantage to a 2-2 draw.  Hsinchu City remains the only area 
where the status quo, 2-1 in favor of the Blue, will remain 
intact. 
 
Central Taiwan: Battleground to Produce a Draw 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5. (C)  Central Taiwan, with a total of 39 seats (one more 
than the last election), is where the previous 20-15 Pan-Blue 
advantage, with 3 independents, is most likely to be reduced 
to a slim 18-17 Pan-Blue margin with 4 independents.  The DPP 
will be seeking to duplicate its success in the presidential 
election, when it boosted its support in these districts, and 
will depend on the effectiveness of its vote allocation 
system.  The Kuomintang (KMT) will need its grassroots 
organizations to remain a force in voter mobilization to 
fight off the challenge.  In Taichung City (8 seats, one more 
than the last election) the Pan-Green has 3 safe seats versus 
4 seats for the Pan-Blue, with the remaining seat likely to 
go to a Green-leaning independent, making for an effective 
4-4 split.  In Taichung County (11 seats) the DPP recently 
decided to \"forsake\" (chi-pao) one of its candidates and 
increased its changes of drawing a 5-5 split with the 
Pan-Blue, a reduction from the current 6-4 Pan-Blue 
advantage, with one independent getting the remaining seat. 
 
6. (C) In Changhua (10 seats) and Nantou (4 seats) Counties, 
the Pan-Green has nominated several incumbents and added 
strong moderates in the hopes of taking an extra seat.  The 
KMT, by comparison, has overnominated, and the presence of 
ex-KMT mavericks threatens to undermine its position. 
Nevertheless, the most likely outcome for both counties 
appears to be a repeat of the status quo from 2001: a 5-4 
Pan-Blue advantage in Changhua with 1 independent and a 2-2 
draw in Nantou.  Yunlin County (6 seats), where vote-buying 
and criminal gangs reign supreme, is the hardest county to 
predict, but will likely go 3-2 in the Pan-Green\'s favor with 
one independent, a reversal of the current 3-2 Pan-Blue 
advantage. 
 
Southern Taiwan: Pan-Green Reached Saturation Point? 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7. (C) Most analysts see little prospect for major changes in 
the south, where seven counties and cities combine for a 
total 46 seats (one less than the last election).  The DPP 
made significant gains in its traditional stronghold three 
years ago, and is basically looking to hold ground.  Analysts 
estimate the Pan-Green could drop one seat, but the Pan-Blue 
can lose two seats, with one seat moving out of the region 
and another two going to independents.  This would actually 
raise the Green margin of victory over the Blue from 11 seats 
(28-17 with two independents three years ago) to 12 seats 
(27-15 this year with four independent). The Pan-Green is 
likely to pick up seats in Kaohsiung County, where the 
unexpectedly high vote total of then-DPP newcomer Lin Tai-hua 
led to the defeat of two other DPP candidates.  This time, 
the DPP is working to spread the Green votes more evenly and 
is taking advantage of a KMT nomination blunder.  After LY 
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng decided to run on the proportional list 
for this election and the KMT did not nominate a candidate 
from Wang\'s local network, the Taiwan Solidary Union (TSU) 
has lured parts of Wang\'s grassroots supporters to its side. 
The DPP is faring less well in those areas where the Pan-Blue 
overnominated in the last election, especially Kaohsiung City 
and Tainan County.  It expects to lose 1-3 seats in these 
areas. 
 
East Coast and the Rest: Still Going Blue 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The east coast counties and cities (9 seats), three 
outlying island chains (3 seats), and the aborigine 
island-wide districts (8 seats) have long been, and continue 
to be, the preserve of the Pan-Blue.  Keelung City (3 seats), 
Haulien County (2 seats), and Taitung County (1 seat) are 
very predictable races with the Pan-Blue maintaining its 2-1, 
1-1, and 1-0 advantage.  Ilan County (3 seats, down 1 from 
the last election), is the only place where the DPP can 
increase its lead over the Pan-Blue by coming out with a 2-1 
advantage.  The single-seat island districts will go to the 
KMT (Kinmen district), PFP (Lienchiang), and former KMT 
independent (Penghu).  Despite its efforts to lobby aborigine 
groups, the DPP has made little headway in penetrating 
grassroots organizations and has only one secure aborigine 
seat out of the 8, an increase of one over its previous zero 
baseline. 
 
Comment: Will the Trend Continue? 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Occupying the executive seat of government since 2000, 
the DPP has poured resources into the northern, Hakka, and 
central districts in the hopes of expanding its own support 
and weaning local interests away from the remnants of the 
KMT\'s organizational base.  Those efforts began to bear fruit 
in the 2004 presidential election, will likely translate into 
marked gains in the LY, and could continue in next year\'s 
mayor and county magistrate elections.  AIT has already begun 
to see some Pan-Blue county magistrates in these districts 
taking a more circumspect role in the local LY races with an 
eye toward their own re-election campaign next year.  These 
critical local leaders want to retain, even increase, their 
county\'s access to central largesse and to avoid alienating 
centrist and light green voters they will need in 2005.  The 
recent defection of Taitung County magistrate from the PFP to 
the DPP and the rumors that the Hsinchu County magistrate 
will also shift loyalties after the LY election suggest 
Pan-Blue strongholds will be coming under increasing 
pressure.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) December 10, on the eve of Taiwan\'s legislative 
elections, marks the 25th anniversary of one of the most 
important political events in Taiwan\'s democratic history. 
On December 10, 1979, a group of demonstrators supporting the 
\"Dang Wai\" (non-KMT) magazine \"Meilidao\" (Formosa) marched to 
a downtown Kaohsiung park to commemorate International Human 
Rights Day.  The marchers encountered a phalanx of police and 
hundreds of local hoodlums recruited to act as agents 
provocateurs.  In the melee that ensued a number of 
demonstrators and police were injured.  The incident led to a 
crackdown in which many who would become leaders of the dang 
wai\'s successor, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), were 
arrested and incarcerated for lengthy periods.  Taiwan Vice 
President Lu and former DPP Chairmen Shih Ming-teh and Hsu 
Hsin-liang (both now independent LY candidates) were among 
those incarcerated.  President Chen and the two DPP leaders 
most rumored to be his likeliest successor, Presidential 
Office Secretary General Su Tseng-chang and Kaohsiung Mayor 
Frank Hsieh, all served as defense lawyers for the Meilidao 
defendants.  People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong 
headed the Government Information Office during the incident 
and was accused by critics of playing a key role in the 
suppression.  In the eyes of many, the Kaohsiung Incident was 
the turning point in Taiwan\'s eventual democratic 
transformation.  At a minimum, it was directly responsible 
for launching the political careers of some of Taiwan\'s most 
influential leaders. 
 
2.  (SBU) It remains unclear to what extent the 25th 
anniversary of the Kaohsiung Incident (alternatively known as 
the \"Formosa Incident\" or the \"Meilidao Incident\") will be 
publicly marked in Taiwan and how it will be exploited by the 
Pan-Green parties in their political campaigns.  Pan-Green 
political rallies are expected to be held on December 10 and 
will undoubtedly include mention of the anniversary. 
However, the Pan Green parties have to date remained silent 
on whether the anniversary will be a central theme in their 
election-eve rallies.  They may be waiting to assess election 
prospects and whether the raising of the profile of the 
anniversary would benefit or harm their candidates\' 
campaigns.  End Summary. 
 
The Kaohsiung Incident -- Historical Background 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
(The following background is repeated from reftel, issued by 
AIT/K on the 20th anniversary of the Kaohsiung Incident. 
Current positions indicated for participants are as of 2004.) 
 
3.  (SBU) Formosa Magazine\'s first issue appeared on August 
29, 1979, and sold more than 110,000 copies.  Circulation 
quickly increased and by the third issue had reached nearly 
four hundred thousand copies.  The magazine\'s Kaohsiung 
office opened on September 28.  The magazine\'s exploding 
circulation and its focus on democracy and Taiwanese identity 
unnerved a KMT leadership already shaken by the United 
States\' December 1978 decision to switch diplomatic relations 
from the ROC to the PRC.  Against this background, the 
decision by the magazine\'s staff to organize a march and 
rally to coincide with International Human Rights Day on 
December 10 led to the violent confrontation with police and 
troops from the Taiwan Garrison Command, and to the 
subsequent crackdown.  These events launched the careers of 
many of today\'s DPP leaders. 
 
December 9: The Kushan Incident 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The event which helped spark the violence of 
December 10 was the arrest and beating of several of the 
magazine\'s staff who were publicizing the next day\'s march 
and rally.  Shortly after dark on December 9, several 
volunteers on the staff, including current Vice Minister of 
Agriculture and former DPP legislator Tai Chen-yao, set off 
in speaker trucks for Kaohsiung\'s Kushan District.  As the 
drivers entered a narrow street, they encountered several 
local police officers who attempted to stop the trucks by 
lying down across the road.  After a brief stand-off the 
magazine staff bodily removed the police from the road and 
continued on their route.  A short distance on, the road was 
blocked fore and aft by police vehicles and police officers 
who broke one truck\'s windshield and beat the driver. 
 
5.  (SBU) In the fight that followed, two of the magazine 
staff were arrested and taken to Kushan police station.  When 
word of the arrests spread, a crowd of some sixty people 
including former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh (then the 
magazine\'s general manager), surrounded the station and 
demanded the release of the prisoners.  The mood of the crowd 
turned violent when it was learned that the prisoners had 
been dragged upstairs by the feet and that one had suffered a 
concussion.  According to Tai, police armed with rifles and 
bayonets surrounded the crowd, which had refused orders to 
move on.  The two were eventually released at about 2:00 am 
and the crowd dispersed.  Though there were no serious 
confrontations with police at the station, the incident 
increased tensions and set a confrontational tone for the 
following day. 
 
December 10: The Kaohsiung Riot 
------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) The December 10 march was to have begun and ended 
at Kaohsiung Rotary Park, taking a circular route past the 
Hsin Hseng Police Station.  Approximately six hundred 
marchers set off.  Only two hundred meters into the march, 
the demonstrators encountered a solid wall of riot police 
while the road on both sides was occupied by approximately 
200 \"liumang\" (hoodlums) allegedly recruited by then 
Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Yu-yun.  According to several AIT/K 
interlocutors, the two leaders of the gangster elements were 
Tsai Sung-hsiung (current Deputy Speaker of the Kaohsiung 
 
SIPDIS 
City Council) and Chang Hsing-wu, who is also a Kaohsiung 
City Councilman.  (Note:  Wu Yu-yun has consistently denied 
any involvement in recruiting gangsters to disrupt the march. 
 End note.) 
 
7.  (SBU) While the ensuing sequence of events is not 
entirely clear, witnesses and participants agreed that the 
gangsters acted as agents provocateurs, attacking both police 
and marchers with bamboo poles and iron rods.  In the melee 
that ensued, the police used tear-gas and riot sticks to 
break up the march.  Reports of injuries range from the 
hundreds to more than one thousand with one demonstrator 
later dying of his injuries.  Over the next month, more than 
one hundred and fifty participants and sympathizers were 
rounded up.  Shih Ming-teh and six others were tried in 
military courts and sentenced to prison terms of between 
twelve years and life.  Several interviewees told AIT/K that 
only pressure from US congressmen and international human 
rights groups prevented Shih Ming-teh from being sentenced to 
death.  Thirty-four others were tried in civilian courts and 
sentenced to terms of four to six years.  The arrests 
effectively silenced the opposition until its leaders were 
paroled in 1987. 
 
Kaohsiung Incident Launches DPP Careers 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) The political significance of the Kaohsiung 
Incident is that it was the crucible in which the careers of 
today\'s ruling party leaders were forged.  The list of those 
arrested and jailed is a who\'s who of Pan-Green politics. 
Among them are Vice President Annette Lu (Hsiu-lien); former 
DPP Chairman, party co-founder and current independent LY 
candidate Shih Ming-teh; former DPP Chairman Lin Yi-Hsiung; 
DPP founding father Huang Hsin-chieh; Vice Minister of 
Agriculture and former LY member Tai Chen-yao; Examination 
Yuan President Yao Cha-wen; National Security Council Senior 
Advisor for Cross-Strait Affairs Chen Chung-hsin; and 
National Policy Advisor Chou Ping-te.  Others, including 
President Chen Shui-bien, Presidential Office Secretary 
General Su Tseng-chang, DPP Secretary General Chang 
Chun-hsiung, and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh (Chang-Ting), 
got their political start as attorneys defending the arrested 
activists.  One commentator said that he believes that 
pressure from the United States on KMT-ruled Taiwan to 
democratize increased after 1979 and led directly to the end 
of martial law, the end of the ban on political party 
formation and the end of restrictions on the press. 
 
9.  (SBU) Most in the Pan Green see the Kaohsiung Incident as 
a turning point in Taiwan\'s democratization.  The 
ideologically fractured \"dang wai\" was transformed into a 
coherent political party capable of forming a viable 
opposition.  The incident and the open trial of the accused 
raised political consciousness in Taiwan and brought home the 
value of democracy.  This in turn led the electorate to 
support the activists, their families and their defense team 
at the ballot box, enabling many of them to become elected 
officials at all levels.  Taiwanese overseas organized 
independence movements while scores of Taiwan graduate 
students abandoned their studies in the US, Europe, and Japan 
to return home and join the political process.  Thus were set 
in motion the forces which have made Taiwan a vibrant, 
multiparty democracy, laying the groundwork for the DPP to 
challenge the KMT and become Taiwan\'s ruling party. 
 
(END of Background from Reftel.) 
 
James Soong\'s Role 
------------------ 
 
10.  (SBU) Members of the Pan-Green are not the only current 
political figures associated with the Kaohsiung Incident. 
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, then a member 
of the KMT, served as the Director-General of the Government 
Information Office (GIO) from 1979 until 1984.  His critics 
say that as GIO chief he favored heavy-handed censorship of 
opposition publications, aggressively using libel laws and 
prison sentences to silence critics.  Then and now, many 
suggest that he might have played a major role in the 
Kaohsiung Incident.  In its aftermath, he defended the 
suppression and condemned the protesters, calling Shih 
Ming-teh the \"King of Bandits.\" 
 
Comment -- Will the Pan-Green Use the Anniversary? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
11.  (C) Earlier this fall, when Taiwan\'s Central Election 
Commission (CEC) was deciding the date of the LY election, 
Pan-Blue party officials were vehemently opposed to having 
the LY election set for the day following the anniversary of 
the Kaohsiung Incident (in the past, LY elections have been 
held on the first Saturday of December).  There was 
tremendous concern that the Pan Green parties would exploit 
the anniversary to smear the Pan-Blue parties as \"oppressors 
of human rights.\"  The CEC, however, ignored their pleas, 
asserting that it was moving the election date to the second 
Saturday as part of its plans to shift the regular LY 
election closer to the actual formation of a new LY at the 
beginning of February. 
 
12.  (C) Since then, we have been waiting to see how the 
Pan-Green campaigns would use the Kaohsiung Incident 
anniversary, but the issue has been almost completely absent 
from the campaign trail.  In response to our queries as to 
whether there would be a political rally or Kaohsiung 
Incident anniversary event in Kaohsiung or elsewhere on 
December 10, all our interlocutors asserted that there was no 
plan \"yet\".  That remained the answer even just a few days 
before the December 10 anniversary. 
 
13.  (C) It may be that the Pan-Green camp is waiting to use 
the anniversary as an election-eve surprise to cap their 
campaigns, holding back in order to maximize the impact on 
the electorate the day before the election in a surprise 
rally.  Or, it may be that the Pan-Green parties have 
determined that the Kaohsiung Incident anniversary could play 
both ways.  After all, there are many now in the DPP and TSU 
whose political histories are not with the \"dang wai,\" but 
were with the then ruling KMT.  Former President Lee 
Teng-hui, the primary sponsor of the Pan-Green Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU), was a prominent KMT leader at the 
time of the Kaohsiung Incident.  Other local DPP and TSU 
figures, no doubt including some currently standing as DPP or 
TSU LY candidates, may also have been on the \"wrong\" side of 
 
SIPDIS 
the incident.  Nevertheless, we do expect the Pan-Green to 
use the 25th anniversary of the Kaohsiung Incident in its 
election-eve rallies as a final rallying cry to its core 
supporters to get out and vote on December 11.  On the eve of 
the anniversary the DPP released a book and VCD commemorating 
the incident at a commemoration event led by Vice President 
Lu, and we expect more to follow at rallies on the actual 
anniversary.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: TAIWAN\'S PLAN TO CHANGE NAMES 
 
A) \"Taiwan\'s Name Change Campaign and U.S. Responses\" 
 
Lin Cheng-yi, Research Fellow and Director of the 
Institute of International Relations, National Chengchi 
University, said in a commentary in the pro-status quo 
\"China Times\" (12/9): 
 
\"During the Cold War period, the United States and 
Taiwan shared the same military strategy of blocking 
Communist China.  Nevertheless, both President 
Eisenhower and President Kennedy were against Chiang 
Kai-shek\'s plan to retake the Chinese mainland.  In 
1962, representatives of Kennedy and Mao Zedong met in 
Warsaw and reached a consensus to jointly oppose 
Chiang\'s proposed attack on Mainland China.  Now, more 
than 10 years after the end of the Cold War, Taiwan\'s 
democratization has gradually moved from a bargaining 
chip to a potential problem.  After Taipei pitched the 
ideas of `Special State-to-state Relations,\' `One Side, 
One Country,\' and `defensive referendum,\' the United 
States has come to realize that in addition to China, 
Taiwan is poised to become a source of instability in 
U.S.-China-Taiwan relations.  Washington even feels the 
urge to pressure Taipei before pushing Beijing. 
 
\"The democratic developments in Taiwan after President 
Lee Teng-hui\'s rule put the United States in a dilemma, 
prompting Washington to narrow down the scope of the 
application of universal democratic values.  In 
response to Taiwan\'s referendum plans, the Bush 
administration appeared unprepared and sent 
inconsistent messages.  At one point, the United States 
said it didn\'t oppose the holding of referenda, later 
it said the United States didn\'t see any special need 
for referenda, and finally it stated its opposition to 
any unilateral change to the status quo.  In the wake 
of such a difficult situation, the Bush administration 
stated, immediately after Taiwan concluded its 
`defensive referendum\' and well before it initiates 
constitutional reforms, that U.S. support is limited 
and it wouldn\'t be vague about the issue and would only 
make straightforward comments, otherwise, no one would 
profit. 
 
\"While the Bush Administration opposes unilateral moves 
by either side of the Taiwan Strait to change the 
status quo, it is reluctant to explain explicitly what 
is the so-called `status quo\' of the Taiwan Strait and 
what is the `red line,\' despite the fact that it wants 
to maintain the right to define these terms.  The 
United States has increased its use of the terms status 
quo, red line, and red areas, but has never cited solid 
examples.  Recently, the U.S. Department of State 
surprised many by saying that changes to the 
terminology for Taiwan\'s state-owned companies or 
economic and cultural offices abroad would unilaterally 
change Taiwan\'s status quo and are steps the United 
States would not support. 
 
\"The Bush administration interfered in Taiwan\'s 
internal affairs with its rapid and clear statement of 
not supporting Taiwan\'s name rectification campaign 
before the island kicks off its constitutional reforms. 
Yet the move serves as an early warning from the United 
States.  The United States, involved in the global war 
on terror, reconstruction in Iraq, and nuclear 
developments in North Korea and Iraq, is unlikely to 
freeze democratic developments in Taiwan.  It can only 
urge Taipei to restrain itself and hopes for no 
[untoward] event in the Taiwan Strait.  The Bush 
administration is counting on official written promises 
by the Taipei leader as criteria for reviewing and 
judging [his actions]. 
 
\"Beijing\'s strong opposition to the terms of `Taiwan,\' 
`national,\' and `central\' has directly and indirectly 
led to Taiwan\'s appeal for name rectification. 
Taiwan\'s name rectification campaign points to the 
establishment of the Taiwan identity and consensus and 
implies an independent Taiwan sovereignty.  The 
campaign is expected to confront difficulties both 
internally and externally.  If a sports event is 
organized by the private sector, and the institution 
requiring a name change is a private company and the 
event is limited to Taiwan, then the impact will be 
limited.  When the government\'s overseas missions and 
official documents are involved, the issue will arouse 
greater pressure.  As a first step to name 
rectification, one would refer to the name Taiwan in 
documents, alongside the official name of the Republic 
of China, and use Taiwan in oral communication, instead 
of `Taipei, China\' or `Chinese Taipei\' as forced by 
Beijing. 
 
\"Taiwan has few diplomatic allies and the Taiwan 
government belongs to even fewer international 
organizations.  The names Taiwan representatives use 
for international negotiations can hardly provide 
satisfactory dignity and fair treatment.  The 
rectification campaign has justified reasons and some 
parts of it can be controlled by us.  However, the 
parts that involves outside parties is controlled by 
others.  The United States does not regard Taiwan\'s 
efforts to gain room for diplomatic maneuvers as a 
crucial issue, nor anything essential to Taiwan\'s 
survival.  It has shown some sympathy but provided no 
significant assistance, and it even expressed its 
stance of no support.  That is the real situation 
Taiwan\'s name rectification campaign is in. 
 
\"Taiwan\'s name rectification campaign and 
constitutional reforms have slow and quick paces as 
well as some real and unreal sides.  Nonetheless, 
appealing to justice is not as effective as resorting 
to comprehensive procedures.  In his second term, 
President Bush has moved to adjust personnel lineups in 
the Department of State and National Security Council. 
The Taiwan-U.S. relations will eventually return to the 
basics of stable development, mutual trust and mutual 
benefits.  The United States stands as a buffer for 
Taiwan with regard to China\'s pressure.  Taiwan now has 
to face pressure from Washington, a harsh and 
unpleasant factor that in turn allows the other side 
[China] who should be blamed [for causing these awkward 
situations] to get away.  The tough challenge for the 
Taiwan leader is to figure out how to convince the 
United States to accept Taiwan\'s change while keeping 
China from resorting to war.  It is not a mission 
impossible.\" 
 
B) \"It\'s Taiwan\'s Right to Chang\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
said in an editorial (12/9): 
 
\"These days, Taiwan seems unable to escape criticism. 
Whatever President Chen Shui-bian does, the United 
States accuses him of `attempting to unilaterally 
change the status quo.\'  The referendum on arms 
purchases held with the March 20 presidential election 
was considered a violation of the status quo, and the 
move to rename Taiwan\'s overseas government agencies is 
also being criticized as a violation of the status quo. 
One cannot help but wonder if the trade pact signed by 
China and ASEAN states is also a violation of the 
status quo, since Taiwan\'s economic advantages are 
being marginalized.  Both German Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have 
recently been working to lift the EU\'s arms embargo 
against China.  Isn\'t this also a violation of the 
status quo?  What is the US\' view of China\'s actions? 
 
\"The terminology of contemporary politics is being 
defined by China alone.  In applying these rules, China 
seems to have brought the rest of the world under its 
wing, with the United States following China\'s lead in 
the use of this terminology, seemingly unaware of 
danger.  China is trying to bury Taiwan alive with the 
term `status quo,\' and unfortunately, the United States 
might be serving as Beijing\'s unwitting accomplice. 
 
\". After the United States turned its back on Taiwan in 
1979, what point in time can be used to define the 
status quo?  If the status quo is understood by the 
United States as a situation in which China deploys an 
estimated 600 ballistic missiles against Taiwan and 
upholds its `one China\' principle while gradually 
trying to take over the island, then what is the point 
of such a status quo?  Why does Washington want to 
maintain Beijing\'s military threat and even rationalize 
it as the status quo? 
 
\"There is nothing wrong with correcting Taiwan\'s name, 
and it in no way threatens anyone or infringes upon 
others\' rights.  Many African countries cast off the 
yoke of colonial rule, rejected their colonial rulers\' 
names and took new names .. 
 
\"Taiwan has shifted from the minority rule of 
Mainlanders during the KMT era to rule by all of the 
people.  It\'s the public\'s right to change the 
country\'s name from one associated with a Chinese 
colonial regime. 
 
The Taiwan Relations Act specifies the terms of U.S. 
military assistance to Taiwan, but it does not prevent 
China from pursuing a policy of marginalizing Taiwan 
out of existence in the international community.  If 
they carry on in this fashion, even the struggle for 
continued existence itself is likely to be criticized 
by the United States as a unilateral change to the 
status quo.\" 
 
C) \"Chen Losing the Trust of a Long-time Ally\" 
 
An editorial of the conservative, pro-unification, 
English-language \"China Post\" said (12/9): 
 
\". The truth is that the United States has become 
impatient with Chen and his administration.  Chen and 
his men said replacing the word China with Taiwan could 
prevent confusion with mainland China\'s firms and 
organizations.  But it does not take much wisdom and 
know-how to be aware that this explanation is nothing 
but a ruse for advancing the independence movement. 
 
\"Chen has made the latest controversial declarations at 
campaign forums, and those remarks, such as his 
proposal for a new constitution, were mainly aimed at 
winning over independence-minded voters, who tend to be 
more supportive of the more radical Taiwan Solidarity 
Union. 
 
\"The president is playing with fire.  His reckless acts 
have harmed ROC-U.S. relations irrevocably.  It is well- 
nigh impossible for Taiwan to regain steadfast support 
from the United States.\"

SUBJECT: TAIWAN MEDIA COVERAGE OF PRESIDENT CHEN SHUI- 
BIAN\'S COMMENTS ON U.S. OPPOSITION TO TAIWAN\'S NAME 
CHANGE PLAN 
 
Summary:  State Department Deputy Spokesman Adam Ereli 
said Monday (12/6/04) the United States does not 
support Taiwan\'s plan to replace \"China\" with \"Taiwan\" 
in the names of all its overseas representative offices 
and state-owned enterprises because these name changes 
would appear to unilaterally change Taiwan\'s status. 
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday (12/7/04) during 
a campaign rally in Tainan the reason why the United 
States does not support Taiwan\'s name changes is 
because of pressure coming from China.  The United 
States is simply conveying the attitude of China, Chen 
said.  Almost all the Taipei dailies Wednesday 
(12/8/04) reported on their front pages the State 
Department comment and Chen\'s reaction.  Headlines and 
major block quotes of the Chinese-language news reports 
follow. 
 
A) \"Facing Heavy Pressure from the United States, 
President Chen Shui-bian Calls for [the Taiwan] People 
to Back Him\" 
(p.1, conservative/pro-unification United Daily News, 
12/8/04; by Ling Pei-chun, Lee Tzu-tong, and Hsin Chi- 
sung) 
 
\"After the United States explicitly expressed its 
opposition to Taiwan\'s name change plan, President Chen 
Shui-bian stressed Tuesday evening during a campaign 
rally in Tainan that the United States is merely 
expressing the opposition of China.  Chen said he is 
under great pressure, including that from the United 
States.  Chen also called on the local people to 
support him so that `A-Bian can speak out louder and 
louder.\' 
 
\"Following the State Department\'s open announcement of 
its opposition to Taiwan\'s name changes Monday, both 
the Presidential Office and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs clarified Tuesday that President Chen\'s plan to 
`rectify [Taiwan\'s] name is not an attempt to change 
the status quo unilaterally and does not violate his 
`five No\'s\' pledge.\'  President Chen, however, did not 
modify his previous statement and emphasized again 
Tuesday evening his determination to push for 
[Taiwan\'s] name changes. 
 
\"Chen stressed that the coming legislative election is 
not just about electing legislators; instead, it is 
about national status and national identity, and 
whether Taiwan will become a part of China.  He will 
fight China by passing over one threshold after another 
and hopes that the Taiwan people would support him and 
let him speak out loud to China, Chen said. 
 
\"According to Chen, the media reported that the United 
States opposes Taiwan\'s plan to change names.  When he 
pushed for a peaceful referendum on March 20, the 
United States also opposed it by saying that it was a 
move by Taiwan to unilaterally change the status quo. 
Many people were scared to death at that moment, 
thinking that it would be `disastrous\' [to go ahead] 
without U.S. support for the referendum. 
 
\"Chen said the United States\' announcement that it does 
not support [Taiwan\'s] name purely reflects the 
opposition of the Beijing authorities.  It is China 
that is placing pressure on the United States and 
asking Washington to convey its opposition to Taiwan\'s 
plan, just like what happened during the March 20 
referendum. 
 
\"Chen asked `Do we have to stop doing it just because 
China opposes it?\'  China has never approved of any of 
the moves done in the past concerning Taiwan\'s 
democratic reforms, including the lifting of martial 
law and the public vote to elect the president.  China 
has always threatened to wage war against Taiwan in all 
the situations above.  But Chen did not compromise nor 
concede.  `Everyone should make up his mind and have 
confidence\' [and] `a referendum is a universal value 
and a basic human right that no country or government 
can deprive or restrict people from having,\' Chen said. 
Although he is under heavy pressure, `including that 
from the United States and from within the island,\' 
Chen said, he still insists on holding the referendum. 
 
\"According to Chen, to change the name of \"ROC\" is not 
a simple matter.  All that remains of the Republic of 
China now is Taiwan, and `Taiwan is our name.\'  Chen 
added that during his term of office, he will 
`eradicate all KMT influence\' to terminate the long 
history of a government system in which the ruling 
party equaled the nation.  He will differentiate 
between Taiwan and China so that the world will not 
think Taiwan is a part of China, Chen said.\" 
 
B) \"Chen Passionately Talks Back to the United States; 
The Presidential Office: [We] Will Mend the Rifts [with 
Washington] after the Legislative Elections\" (P.3, 
centrist/pro-status quo China Times, 12/8/04; by Lin 
Shu-ling, Tsai Hui-chen, Chen Chung-jung, Chen Yu- 
hsien, Lisa Hsu, Yang Shu-fen, and Chen Chia-hung) 
 
\"Following the United States\' strongly worded 
statement, President Chen gave a passionate speech on 
his name change policy during a campaign rally in 
Tainan City Tuesday evening, which drew a lot of 
attention.  Sources said Chen\'s talk Tuesday evening 
was all his own doing. 
 
\"A high-ranking official of the Presidential Office 
said later Tuesday evening that the logic of 
campaigning is different from that of other issues.  If 
[Chen\'s remarks] did harm Taipei-Washington relations, 
Taiwan will try to mend them after the election results 
come out. 
 
\"Sources said when the [Taiwan] authorities learned 
about the State Department\'s public opposition to 
Taiwan\'s plan to replace `China\' with `Taiwan\' in the 
names of all its overseas representative offices and 
state-owned enterprises, they started to clarify the 
issue for the local public through the Presidential 
Office, the Executive Yuan and DPP headquarters.  They 
did not intend to heat up the issue or challenge the 
U.S. response.  Thus, Chen\'s passionate talk in Tainan 
City Tuesday evening astonished some senior officials. 
 
\"A high-ranking official believes that rifts between 
Taiwan and the United States are inevitable during the 
campaigning process.  [Chen\'s] administration has done 
its best to try to minimize these rifts.  Taiwan will 
seek to mend the rifts after the election results come 
out if the rifts have done any damage to Taipei- 
Washington ties.  Taiwan and the United States will 
have an open and honest dialogue in the wake of the 
legislative elections, the official added. 
 
\"In fact, the authorities held an emergency meeting 
early Tuesday morning to discuss how government 
agencies will give the same story in response [to the 
State Department\'s comment].  They decided to emphasize 
that the name change plan is [meant] to highlight 
Taiwan\'s sense of entity and has nothing to do with 
changing the nation\'s title.  Seeking to change the 
names of the government\'s overseas representative 
offices and changing the status quo are two separate 
issues, and the Taiwan government will act in 
accordance with its national interests, continuing 
negotiations with its allies to win their understanding 
and support, and to prevent other people from 
mistakenly assuming that Taiwan wants to alter the 
status quo, the official added. . 
 
\"Cabinet Spokesman Chen Chi-mai admitted that President 
Chen did not inform Washington in advance before he 
announced the plan to rectify the names of Taiwan\'s 
state-owned enterprises and overseas representative 
offices.  But Chen emphasized that relevant actions to 
rectify Taiwan\'s name were started while the KMT was 
the ruling party, and the plan to change the names of 
Taiwan\'s overseas representative offices was not 
initiated by the DPP government, either.  \"Since the 
United States has the `Taiwan Relations Act,\' what will 
it call us if it does not want to address us as 
`Taiwan?\' Chen asked.\" 
 
C) \"When the Election Goes Wild, There is No End to the 
Pain to U.S.-Taiwan Relations\" 
(P.3, centrist/pro-status quo China Times, 12/8/04; by 
Lisa Hsu) 
 
\"Whenever there is an election, there will be pain to 
U.S.-Taiwan relations.  Last winter it was because of 
the referendum, and this year it is about [Taiwan\'s] 
declaration that it will change the names of its 
overseas missions and state-owned enterprises.  What is 
different is that the United States has reacted faster 
and faster.  Whenever President Chen Shui-bian makes a 
move, the United States draws a red line accordingly. 
Moreover, the level of the U.S. official that makes 
responses is merely that of the spokesman or the deputy 
spokesman of the State Department, but the level of 
Taiwan official that responds covers all levels.  When 
the United States puts the squeeze on Taiwan, it surely 
bullies Taiwan a lot. 
 
\"The names and forms of Taiwan\'s overseas missions vary 
a lot.  In the past, Taiwan has discussed with the 
United States changes to the names of Taiwan\'s 
representative offices in the United States.  However, 
the United States believes that there is no hurry to do 
this and they will start with whatever they are able to 
do first.  For example, the United States has 
`rectified\' the name of the General Affairs Section to 
Political Section within AIT. . 
 
\"The tempo of Taiwan elections is very quick.  This is 
quite different from the logic of diplomatic affairs 
that [holds that] deep water runs slowly.  However, 
when it comes to elections, diplomacy will have to be 
second in priority.  When there is no sufficient prior 
communication concerning major foreign policies, they 
often end up in a messy situation..  Now it\'s election 
season again.  Judged from the reaction of the United 
States, [it is evident that] Washington is still 
nervous about Taiwan\'s campaign rhetoric.  Top-level 
officials in the Taiwan government always think they 
can clear things up after the elections.  However, in 
reality, one will find that the U.S. strategy to 
respond quickly reflects its serious doubts about 
whether Taiwan can stick to its pledges or whether 
President Chen can remain consistent [with his policy]. 
 
\"Judging from another perspective, during the process 
of rebuilding mutual trust between the United States 
and Taiwan, there is no rush to push the United States 
to reveal its stand.  The more one pushes the other to 
show its hand, the card that is shown will not be a 
good one, especially under the situation where the 
United States and other countries actually do not feel 
like being forced to do so and when there is not enough 
mutual trust between the two sides. 
 
\"The United States expressed its opposition to any 
unilateral change by either side of the Taiwan Strait 
and draws lines regarding the `status quo.  But on the 
other hand, it is also encouraging both sides of the 
Taiwan Strait to resume dialogue and begin talks. 
Judging from this point of view, although the United 
States pays attention to every move Taiwan makes during 
the elections, whether both sides of the Strait can 
develop a different political climate based on their 
goodwill in the wake of the legislative elections is 
the issue of major concern for the United States.\" 
 
D) \"Regarding the United States\' Opposition to Taiwan\'s 
Name Changes, President Chen: Not Negotiable\"  (P.2, 
mass circulation Apple Daily, 12/8/04) 
 
\"President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday night said in his 
hometown Tainan with regard to the reaction from the 
United States, `in the past when we fought for 
democratic reform, such as to lift martial law, the ban 
on political parties and newspapers, and direct 
election of the president by the people, China said all 
of them were Taiwan independence moves. China, thus, 
threatened war.  We have, however, accomplished all of 
them, including the peace referendum, without a war 
initiated by China.  The name change thing is the same, 
no one should be afraid.\' \'It is impossible that we 
don\'t do anything that China opposes. We should never 
compromise when we face oppression from China.\' 
 
\"President Chen pointed out that the news coverage of 
the United States not supporting Taiwan\'s plan for name 
changes is the same as with the referendum last year. 
The United States is expressing China\'s opinion. 
President Chen emphasized that we want to make known 
Taiwan\'s subjectivity, so we should use the name 
`Taiwan\' while participating in international society.\" 
 
E) \"Bian: Name Change, No compromise and No Concession\" 
(P.1, pro-independence Taiwan Daily, 12/8/04; by Lin 
Chao-yi) 
 
\"Regarding the United States decision not to support 
Taiwan regarding name changes, President Chen Tuesday 
said in Tainan the United States is expressing the 
attitude of China.  Chen cited the lift of the ban on 
political parties and newspapers, the direct election 
of the president, and the March 20 referendum as 
evidence that `every issue is opposed by China.\' 
However, `Do we give in?\' Chen said Taiwan will not 
compromise or concede on its plan to change names. Chen 
wants everyone to back him, \"speak out loud to China,\" 
and give him a stable majority in congress. . 
 
\"President Chen Tuesday night came to Tainan to support 
four Pan-Green candidates.  Chen offered the March 20 
referendum as an example and said at that time everyone 
had the chance to participate in the peace referendum. 
Chen hoped that everyone will have the chance to 
participate in a referendum on the constitution. Last 
year, however, when Chen pushed for the peace 
referendum, the United States also said it did not 
support [the referendum] and said it was a unilateral 
change of the status quo. Several people were `scared 
to death\' and said `Chen is damned. How can the peace 
referendum proceed without the support from the United 
States?\'  As to the United States\' opposition to name 
changes, Chen considered it to reflect a request from 
the Beijing administration to the United States, and 
that the United States is expressing China\'s 
opposition. The situation is just like the United 
States\' attitude before the peace referendum. `It is 
impossible that we don\'t dare to do things just because 
China opposes it or does not support it.\' Chen said 
`The Far East Trade Center\' in Australia, `The Sun Yat- 
sen Center\' in Singapore, `The East Asia Relations 
Association\' in Japan, and `The Coordination Council 
for North American Affairs\' in the United States have 
all been changed to `The Taipei Economic and Cultural 
Representative Office\'. Isn\'t the name change of the 
above agencies examples of what we fought for?  If we 
could fight for the Taipei Representative Office 
before, why can\'t we fight for the name to be changed 
to The Taiwan Representative Office?\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  Taiwan investment in the PRC approved by Taiwan\'s 
Ministry of Economic Affairs during the first six months of 
2004 was 68 percent higher than the same period last year. 
PRC data also shows a substantial increase in contracted 
investment but a modest drop in realized investment. 
High-tech firms lead the trend, but firms in heavy 
industries, including steel and cement, are also investing in 
the PRC.  Taiwan investment is concentrated in the Pearl and 
Yangtze River Deltas areas, with investment in the Yangtze 
Delta region growing faster.  Nevertheless, Taiwan\'s 
restrictions on certain categories of investment continue to 
hold back Taiwan firms in the high-tech industries where 
Taiwan\'s advantage is strongest.  End Summary. 
 
Taiwan\'s Mainland Investment Continues to Grow 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (U) Recent statistics released by Taiwan\'s Ministry of 
Economic Affairs (MOEA) show that Taiwan\'s investment in the 
PRC continued to grow during the first half of 2004 at a 
remarkable pace.  MOEA approved USD 3.39 billion worth of 
investment during the period.  This represents a 68 percent 
increase over the same period in 2003.  Investment in 
Mainland China accounted for at least 70 percent of Taiwan\'s 
total foreign investment during the first half of the year. 
Some officials estimate that up to 75 percent of Taiwan\'s 
investment goes to the Mainland if money funneled through 
offshore financial centers such as the Cayman Islands is 
included.  According to MOEA, Taiwan\'s cumulative investment 
in the PRC increased 9.9 percent during the period to USD 
37.7 billion.  Most observers believe that a large portion of 
Taiwan\'s investment in the Mainland evades MOEA approval. 
Unofficial estimates of Taiwan\'s cumulative investment in the 
PRC range as high as USD 190 billion. 
 
3. (C) The PRC Ministry of Commerce\'s data for the first half 
of the year as re-released by Taiwan\'s MOEA show a somewhat 
different story.  The PRC provides data on contracted and 
realized investment.  The total value of contracted 
investment for the first six months of 2004 increased 31.6 
percent to USD 4.66 billion.  However, the value of realized 
investment )- dollars actually spent -- declined 10 percent 
compared to the same period in 2003 to USD 1.89 billion. 
Taiwan MOEA\'s Investment Commission Executive Secretary Huang 
Chin-tan speculated to AIT/T that the decline in realized 
investment during the period was probably due to the PRC\'s 
political pressure on \"pro-green\" investors who support Chen 
Shui-bian\'s Democratic Progressive Party and the PRC\'s 
macroeconomic control measures aimed at slowing China\'s 
growth.  Huang expects realized investment figures to show 
growth again in 2005. 
 
High Tech Industries Lead the Trend 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) High tech firms continued to dominate Mainland 
investment during the first half of the year.  According to 
MOEA, electronics and electrical appliance manufacturing 
accounted for just over 50 percent of Taiwan\'s investment in 
the PRC.  Several large-scale high tech investments made up a 
particularly large portion of Mainland investment approved by 
MOEA during the period.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 
Company\'s (TSMC) plan to invest USD 371 million in an 
eight-inch semiconductor foundry near Shanghai was approved. 
In addition, MOEA authorized Hon Hai Precision, manufacturer 
of a range of IT equipment and components, and TFT-LCD 
producer AU Optronics to invest USD 57.4 million and USD 100 
million respectively. 
 
5. (C) Taiwan\'s heavy industry firms are also continuing to 
invest in the Mainland.  Together, investments in basic 
metals and metal products, non-metallic minerals (including 
cement), and chemicals accounted for 18 percent of approved 
investment during the first half of 2004.  Among the largest, 
MOEA approved Formosa Chemicals and Fibre Corp.\'s plan to 
invest USD 48.3 million in a petrochemicals plant and Yieh 
United Steel\'s plan to invest USD 51 million in a stainless 
steel project.  These results seem surprising given the PRC\'s 
efforts to slow down its economy, in part aimed at the 
construction industry.  Even industries that would be most 
susceptible to these economy-cooling measures have seen large 
new investments.  MOEA approved Taiwan Cement\'s plan to 
invest USD 50.8 million in the first half of the year. 
Furthermore, in the second half at least three additional 
large-scale investments in the cement industry have also been 
approved.  MOEA\'s Huang told AIT that his office contacted 
steel and cement industry investors and learned that the PRC 
approved their investments despite efforts to slow the 
economy because the projects would improve energy efficiency 
in the PRC. 
 
Taiwan\'s Investment in the PRC Moving North 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Taiwan\'s investment in the Mainland is mostly 
clustered in the Pearl and Yangtze River Delta areas. 
However, the latest data from MOEA suggest that investment in 
the Mainland is moving north.  Whereas Guangdong and Fujian 
provinces accounted for about 39 percent of investment 
approved up through 2003, they made up only 25 percent of 
investment approved during the first half of 2004.  Jiangsu 
and Zhejiang provinces together with the municipality of 
Shanghai, on the other hand, accounted for more than 68 
percent in the first six months of the year, compared to only 
47 percent of cumulative investment through 2003.  The 
conventional wisdom is that Taiwan\'s high tech firms tend to 
invest in the Yangtze River Delta area, while manufacturers 
of other consumer goods, such as textile, toy, and shoe 
manufacturers, tend to concentrate along the Pearl River in 
cities like Shenzhen and Dongguan, Guangdong province. 
MOEA\'s data bear this out.  Approximately 75 percent of 
Taiwan\'s approved investment in the electronics and 
electrical appliance category was destined for the Yangtze 
River Delta area during the first half of 2004. 
 
Investment Policy Still Impedes Some Investment 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (C) Even as investment in the Mainland rises rapidly, 
Taiwan\'s regulations continue to prevent some investment. 
Taiwan\'s government has been considering for sometime lifting 
investment bans for small TFT-LCD panel manufacturing, 
integrated circuit (IC) packaging and testing, and trash 
incineration.  Pre-election politics have delayed approval of 
these categories, but according to MAC officials, these 
categories will be approved for investment around the end of 
the year.  Several firms have expressed interest to MOEA and 
are ready to invest in these categories.  Other categories, 
notably large TFT-LCD panel and advanced semiconductor 
manufacturing, remain prohibited with no sign that the Taiwan 
government will lift restrictions in the near future. 
 
8. (C) Taiwan is moving slowly to liberalize semiconductor 
investment in the Mainland.  It has already decided to allow 
up to three firms to build eight-inch wafer semiconductor 
foundries in the PRC.  So far, only TSMC has been approved. 
In addition, United Microelectronics Corp., Powerchip 
Semiconductor Corp., ProMos Technologies Inc., and Nanya 
Technology Corp. have all expressed interest in building 
foundries in the Mainland.  The Taiwan government still 
prohibits investment in the Mainland in the more advanced 
twelve-inch wafer technology.  However, it has not succeeded 
in keeping this technology out-of-reach for PRC 
manufacturers.  In September, the PRC\'s Semiconductor 
Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) opened its 
first twelve-inch wafer manufacturing facility in Beijing. 
As reported in the media, Taiwan PC manufacturer Acer 
Chairman Stan Shih argues in his new book \"Millennium 
Transformation: Change Management for New Acer\" that it\'s too 
late for Taiwan firms to dominate the PRC chip market.  He 
believes that had firms like TSMC been able to invest in the 
Mainland sooner they would have been able to eliminate 
competition from PRC-based firms.  He believes that PRC firms 
have now attained a level of technology that will make them 
strong competitors.  TSMC blames, at least in part, 
industrial espionage for SMIC\'s success.  TSMC has filed suit 
against SMIC for patent and trade secret infringement with 
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of 
California and the U.S. International Trade Commission.  If 
Taiwan continues to hold back the industries where its 
competitive advantage is strongest -- like semiconductors -- 
it will face increasing competition from the PRC and other 
countries and risks its own future growth

\". Americans will not sit back quietly and allow 
Beijing to use force [against Taiwan.]  Yes, this is 
true, but this fact cannot be viewed as an amulet for 
Taiwan because how China and the United States will act 
is not under Taiwan\'s control.  What Taiwan can control 
is how the island will choose its future.  For a long 
time, Taiwan\'s tough survival has relied on the fact 
that Washington, Beijing and Taipei all recognize [the 
need to] `maintain the status quo.\'  Because of this, 
Taiwan got the United States\' guarantee to safeguard 
peace across the Taiwan Strait ..  This `U.S. lottery 
ticket\' that Taiwan uses as an amulet, however, cannot 
be cashed in at anytime without restrictions.  Instead, 
it depends on the means that Taiwan uses for making a 
living - namely, [its pledge of] `not to unilaterally 
change the status quo.\'  President Chen Shui-bian, 
however, seems to have a blind spot regarding the 
recognition of this situation, and his move to throw 
away the `shoulder pole\' . is so blatant, [it is 
almost] as if he were afraid that the world would not 
notice his intention.  Doesn\'t he know that the number 
on the `U.S. lottery ticket\' cannot be erased or 
changed, and the ticket has never been a blank check? 
.\" 
 
B) \"Chen Unfairly Accuses of U.S. Interfering in 
Internal Affairs\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" said in an editorial (12/10): 
 
\". Chen attacked the U.S. government\'s objections to 
his name-change call as an action of interfering with 
Taiwan\'s internal affairs.  This accusation is neither 
reasonable nor fair.  The U.S. has a responsibility to 
intervene when necessary, because it has a defense 
commitment to Taiwan.  This commitment must not be 
interpreted as merely a unilateral U.S. obligation. 
Taiwan, for its part, should behave itself by 
refraining from doing anything that would provoke a PRC 
invasion that in turn could involve Washington in an 
unnecessary war.  In other words, Taiwan must not take 
the advantage of America\'s defense protection to 
antagonize Beijing by pursuing independence. 
 
\"Chen of course can voice his resistance aloud to 
Washington\'s intervention if he believes that Taiwan is 
no longer in need of American defense assistance. 
Apparently, this is unlikely to be the case as long as 
the political standoff with Beijing persists. 
 
\"It was irresponsible that Chen urged the people to 
persevere with his name-change plan and told them that 
that was the only right way for them to take.  And only 
by doing so will Taiwan have future. 
 
\"Taiwan\'s political future cannot be unilaterally 
decided by its own politicians or by a referendum by 
its people.  It must take into account the position of 
Beijing which will always claims sovereignty over 
Taiwan.  Taipei could ignore Beijing\'s opposition only 
under the circumstance when it has the strength to 
independently deter a military retaliation. . 
 
\"A continuous rise in nationalism on both sides of the 
Taiwan Strait may finally prompt their political 
leaders to take adventurous moves, to the point that 
things may get out of control.  When tensions escalate 
to such a level, it would be too late for the U.S. to 
intervene and prevent what could be a devastating war. 
 
\"This means that Washington might have to take a more 
effective role in helping to contain Taiwan\'s surging 
independence movement now and in the years ahead.\"

Classified By: AIT Deputy Director David J. Keegan, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: As the campaign for control of the 
Legislative Yuan (LY) enters its final day, the outcome looks 
increasingly to be determined by a few key variables: signs 
that the KMT\'s \"peipiao\" vote allocation is breaking down, 
DPP fears of a TSU late surge, a spate of vote-buying 
arrests, and last minute appeals to middle voters, who may 
(or may not) provide key swing votes.  In the end, however, 
many of the closest races are still too close and complicated 
to predict and will ultimately be decided, party officials 
claim, \"by luck.\"  While some of these factors are common to 
elections everywhere in the world, many are unique to 
Taiwanese LY elections and their multi-member districts. 
This election is expected to be the last held under this 
system, so many of these issues will become a thing of the 
past after December 11.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) As time runs out in the LY campaign, both camps are 
making their final appeals to both core voters and centrists, 
but the real battle is playing out over vote allocation 
\"peipiao.\"  Presidential aide Liu Shih-chung told AIT on 
December 10 that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has 
revised down its internal assessment from 110 to 107 based on 
recent trends, but said this pessimism was based on the 
assumption that the Pan-Blue would formally abandon its 
poorly designed peipiao scheme in the final hours of the 
campaign.  \"If they don\'t, we will go back to our 110-111 
range estimate.\"  As if on cue, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman 
Lien Chan publicly rejected calls for dropping the KMT\'s 
peipiao plan, stating that \"as long as we do a good job of 
peipiao, all of our candidates will win.\" 
 
3. (C) Both sides seem to see the KMT\'s handling of peipiao 
as the key final variable in this election.  The DPP 
finalized its peipiao arrangements in most districts in the 
last two weeks of the campaign.  It disseminated its vote 
allocation instructions to voters by a variety of means, from 
traditional billboards, newspaper and bus-side advertising to 
commemorative stamps and even condoms.  Then the KMT came 
under pressure to respond.  In a press conference on December 
6, they announced that they would implement peipiao 
allocation in ten of the most hotly contested districts. 
Closer examination reveals, however, that some of the KMT\'s 
announced peipiao schemes are merely empty propaganda.  When 
AIT asked Miaoli County KMT Chairman Lee Chin-sung about the 
peipiao plan for his district, for example, he replied that 
the \"new\" peipiao plan was just a repackaging of the 
traditional (and generally ineffective) geographic 
distribution effort they had been using before the 
announcement. 
 
KMT Candidates Rebel ... 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) In other districts, however, the KMT\'s announcement 
has instilled panic in many of its candidates who had been 
doing well in the polls.  Some have openly rebelled against 
the party leadership, publicly urging their followers to 
disregard the party\'s peipiao instructions.  One Taipei City 
KMT candidate, Lai Shih-pao, a consistent front-runner in the 
polls, became desperate enough to spam random mobile phones 
(Poloff\'s included) with text messages begging voters to 
ignore the \"fake peipiao order from KMT central.\"  Part of 
this is certainly motivated by candidates\' desire to win by a 
large margin, thus bolstering their chances of being 
nominated in the next election (Ref A), but many 
front-runners are legitimately afraid.  Ham-handed KMT 
peipiao attempts in previous elections have more than once 
resulted in the most popular candidate in a district losing 
the election entirely. 
 
... While PFP Candidates Riot 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Some in the PFP, however, are literally rioting over 
the KMT\'s peipiao plans.  In Chiayi on December 7 PFP 
supporters burned the local KMT Chairman in effigy and tried 
to storm the KMT Headquarters there to demand that the KMT 
share votes with their candidate.  Complaints about being 
left out of the KMT\'s peipiao plans have been a constant PFP 
theme for the last few weeks of the campaign.  However, this 
is only one issue among many in the rapidly declining 
relationship between the KMT and the PFP since plans for an 
early merger between the two parties fell apart in October 
(Ref B).  Cooperation between the two parties is now 
non-existent even in the few places (such as Nantou County) 
where it seemed inter-party peipiao could be safely 
implemented.  This makes it more likely that Pan-Green 
candidates will pick up extra seats in those districts.  The 
acrimony between the two parties has reached the point where 
many doubt the post-election merger will take place at all. 
 
Possible TSU Surge Has the DPP Nervous 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Internecine fighting and nervousness over peipiao is 
not confined to the Pan-Blue camp, however.  Many lagging TSU 
candidates have expressed renewed confidence in their chances 
for victory in the wake of a surprisingly well-received rally 
speech by TSU leader Lee Teng-hui on December 5.  Lee 
characterized the TSU as Taiwan\'s only loyal opposition party 
and attacked the DPP as incapable of truly defending Taiwan\'s 
sovereignty.  These remarks have reenergized fundamentalist 
Green voters and drawn them away from the DPP and toward the 
TSU.  Commentators are predicting this last minute surge 
 
SIPDIS 
could propel the TSU to a better than expected performance on 
election day, possibly taking more than 20 seats.  Even DPP 
officials are now expressing concern that the TSU might 
unseat senior DPP incumbents in Keelung, Chiayi and Hsinchu 
City.  In many other districts where the DPP and TSU had 
negotiated joint peipiao plans, the DPP candidates are 
showing uncharacteristic reluctance to participate, although 
for now they appear to be at least nominally willing to 
cooperate.  However AIT\'s assessment is that talk of a last 
minute TSU surge may be exaggerated.  Even if the TSU is able 
to transform this momentum into success at the polls, it will 
likely only increase its total to 17-19 seats and most of the 
gains will be in places like Yunlin, Nantou and Taipei City 
where the seat might have otherwise gone to an independent or 
KMT candidate.  At most, two or three of the DPP\'s weaker 
newcomers might be displaced by the TSU\'s rally. 
 
Chen\'s \"Contract for Taiwan\" - At the 11th Hour 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (C) Another variable that both sides are concentrating on 
in the last hours of the campaign is the centrist voter.  The 
bitterly divisive campaign and extreme rhetoric of the past 
few weeks have largely alienated moderate voters, but with 
many races likely to be decided by less than 1000 votes, both 
camps are belatedly appealing to voters in the middle. 
President Chen\'s eleventh hour appeal takes the form of a 
\"Contract For Taiwan\" whose ten points include a variety of 
sensible tax and fiscal proposals as well as promises of 
judicial reform and passage of the special defense 
procurement package.  (Comment: None of these constructive 
topics have received much attention from Chen or other DPP 
candidates, despite several predictions to AIT by senior DPP 
officials that they would.  End Comment.) 
 
\"Contract ON Taiwan\" - The KMT Threatens Gridlock 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
8. (C) The KMT\'s last minute appeal is instead a variation on 
the divisive.  LY Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, in an interview with 
Hong-Kong media, threatened that if the Pan-Blue lost the 
majority and he were not reelected Speaker, then Pan-Blue 
legislators would \"paralyze\" the LY by derailing every bill 
proposed by the majority.  KMT Chairman Lien Chan offered a 
depressingly similar promise should the Pan-Blue win a 
majority.  On December 4, he told supporters that if the 
Pan-Blue retained its majority, it would form a new 
government.  DPP officials blasted Lien\'s proposal as 
\"unconstitutional\", pointing out that under Taiwan\'s 
constitution, it is the President, not the Legislature that 
appoints the cabinet and forms a government.  The KMT 
spokesman later clarified that Lien had really meant that 
Chen \"should respect the mandate shown in the election\" when 
nominating the cabinet.  Lien, however, has refused to back 
down and on December 9 named LY Vice President Chiang Pin-kun 
as the next Premier should the Pan-Blue win a majority.  He 
threatened a no-confidence vote against any other nominee 
from Chen.  (Note:  The Taiwanese Constitution technically 
allows for such a no-confidence vote by the LY under certain 
circumstances, but the President is then entitled to dissolve 
the LY and call a new election.  End Note.) 
 
Handbags for Votes 
------------------ 
 
9. (C) As expected, vote-buying has also become a prominent 
issue in the last week of the campaign.  Prosecutors have 
zealously adhered to pledges to crack down on vote-buying in 
this election, and there have been a flurry of indictments. 
Those accused of vote-buying have primarily been campaign 
assistants and district party chairmen, rather than the 
candidates themselves.  The majority of indictments have been 
on the Pan-Blue side, and KMT officials have predictably 
complained that these vote-buying charges are politically 
motivated and carried out by a judiciary \"controlled by the 
DPP.\"  However, DPP and TSU campaign offices have also been 
targeted.  Miaoli County DPP Chairman Hsu Chin-jung, noting 
the indictment of one of his campaign managers, complained 
that most of the indictments, on both sides, were for petty 
offenses such as hosting banquets for supporters or giving 
out handbags or baseball caps at rallies.  \"The real 
vote-buyers aren\'t getting caught,\" he said, because the 
evidence is so much harder to find.  He noted that many of 
the independent candidates have organized crime connections, 
presumably rely primarily on vote buying for their support, 
and are still running strong in this campaign. 
 
Non-Violent Campaign Marred by Bombing on Eve of Election 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
10. (C) So far there has been no significant violence in this 
LY election campaign (which is more than can be said of the 
LY itself), even in the south, where it has been a particular 
problem in the past (Septel).  Simultaneous large-scale 
rallies in Taipei on December 5 by the KMT and TSU were held 
within blocks of one another without erupting into violence. 
On December 9, however, the city of Taipei saw several 
threatening incidents, although it is not yet clear if and 
how they are related to the election.  A van loaded with 11 
bottles of gasoline and cooking gas burst into flames around 
noon near Taipei Railway Station.  Four hours later several 
suspicious packages were found in the station itself. 
Additionally, several TV news anchors received letters saying 
that in the presidential election there had been two bullets, 
but in this election there would be four.  The letters 
demanded that President Chen give up his pursuit of Taiwan 
independence and threatened that explosives would be placed 
in the Taipei Railway Station and in the Taipei 101 
skyscraper. 
 
Comment: Final Stretch for an Anachronism 
----------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Some of the variables that will determine the final 
outcome of this election, such as the role of centrist 
voters, smearing, and last-minute rhetoric, are common to 
elections in democracies all around the world.  However, many 
more are unique to Taiwan.  The overwhelming importance of 
peipiao, and the central role it plays in every phase of the 
campaign, are artifacts of the multi-member district 
electoral system.  The low margin of victory in almost all 
such districts also increases the effectiveness of and 
temptation for vote-buying.  It also drives candidates to 
appeal to small and often extremist elements of the 
electorate.  Even Taiwan\'s complex inter-party dynamics are 
partly the result of its hybrid electoral systems: the LY 
system encourages multiple parties and factionalism within 
each party, while the first-past-the-post system used in the 
Presidential race promotes two large \"camps\".  If the package 
of Legislative Constitutional reforms passed in August is 
ratified by the National Assembly early next year, as 
expected, this will be the last election of this kind in 
Taiwan.  All of these complex, non-policy tactical issues 
will then presumably disappear as well.  Perhaps we can look 
forward to a more moderate, issues-focused debate at that 
time.

SUBJECT: PAN-BLUE BEATS EXPECTATIONS AND RETAINS MAJORITY 
IN LY 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) The Pan-Blue alliance lost only one seat and retained 
a majority with 114 of 225 seats, a surprising performance in 
the December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) election.  Most 
commercial and internal party polls, as well as analytical 
assessments (including AIT\'s) had expected the Pan-Blue 
alliance to suffer more significant losses, possibly enough 
to give the rival Pan-Green the majority.  Instead, the 
Pan-Green alliance gained only one seat, bringing it to a 
total of 101 seats.  The Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) 
took six seats and the remaining four seats went to 
independents.  Voter turnout reached a record low at 59 
percent, seven points below the 2001 LY election and 21 
percent lower than the March 20 presidential election. 
Septel will assess the policy implications of the new LY 
makeup. 
 
2. (C) Although the overall balance in the LY barely changed 
in this election, there were significant shifts within both 
alliances, with the major parties consolidating power at the 
expense of their junior partners.  The Democratic Progressive 
Party (DPP) captured 89 seats, a gain of two, and the Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU) took 12, a loss of one.  The biggest 
winner, however, was the Kuomintang (KMT), which won 79 
seats, a gain of eleven, entirely at the expense of the 
People First Party (PFP), which took 34 seats, down twelve 
from its previous 46.  The New Party (NP) incumbent on Kinmen 
Island held onto the last Pan-Blue seat. 
 
3. (C) Comment: The KMT\'s success in this election is the 
result of KMT restraint and TSU recklessness.  The KMT 
decided to adopt a conservative nomination strategy.  It 
nominated a total of 74 candidates for the district elections 
this year, down from 101 in 2001.  The DPP, by contrast, 
increased its nominations from 83 in 2001 to 92 this year. 
It might have been successful in reaching its goals had the 
TSU not been so aggressive, nominating far more candidates 
 
SIPDIS 
than they could reasonably expect to win.  Throughout the 
campaign, DPP officials were confident in their chances 
because they assumed the TSU would not win a significant 
share of the vote. 
 
4.  However, the last week of the campaign saw a surge in 
support for the TSU, largely at the expense of the DPP.  Most 
of the TSU candidates who benefited, however were too 
numerous to get elected, but they often pulled several 
previously secure DPP candidates under the election threshold 
with them.  It is likely that the DPP might have won as many 
as six or seven additional seats without this TSU 
overnomination, pulling the Pan-Green even with the Pan-Blue. 
 The PFP\'s nomination strategy was actually the most 
conservative of all the parties, generally aiming only to 
hold onto its existing seats.  Nevertheless, it suffered 
throughout the election from flagging popularity and many of 
its supporters in the end returned to the KMT fold.

SUBJECT: NEW LY LINE-UP MAY MODERATE TAIWAN POLITICAL 
DISCOURSE 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The Pan-Blue\'s surprise victory in the 
December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) election should help reduce 
extremism in Taiwan\'s political discourse.  President Chen 
Shui-bian will be under pressure to moderate his offensive on 
sensitive issues like cross-Strait relations and 
constitutional reform.  KMT Chairman Lien Chan\'s offer to 
work with the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government 
to pursue the national interest appears to signal to the 
voters that he has heard their unhappiness with the gridlock 
of the last four years.  LY action on the USD 18 billion 
special defense procurement budget may be an early test of 
these election night gestures.  The poor showing by both the 
People First Party (PFP) and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) 
should marginalize voices on both ends of the political 
spectrum, theoretically allowing for a more reasoned policy 
debate on defense and other topics.  Of course, early signs 
of cooperation could prove short-lived, and there remains a 
real possibility that the two sides will return to gridlock. 
End Summary. 
 
Move to the Middle 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) The new LY line-up (Pan-Blue 114, Pan-Green 101) 
should help moderate the tone of Taiwan\'s future political 
discourse.  The Pan-Blue\'s LY majority greatly reduces 
chances for action in the coming four years on sensitive 
issues like radical constitutional reform.  The Pan-Blue 
majority is also likely to reassure Beijing, and could put 
pressure on President Chen to be seen as moderating his more 
extreme views on cross-Strait policy.  Electoral setbacks for 
Lee Teng-hui\'s TSU and James Soong\'s PFP should also 
marginalize voices on both extremes of the political spectrum. 
 
3. (C) A key factor in the future course of policy making 
will be the ability of the DPP to work with the new Pan-Blue 
LY majority.  KMT Chairman Lien Chan\'s election night offer 
to cooperate with the DPP government on national policy is an 
encouraging sign that the two political camps may seek to 
mend the divisions that have plagued Taiwan\'s political 
debate since March 20.  Another positive development was the 
fact that Lien did not make reference to his election eve 
demand that Chen give the Pan-Blue the right to appoint the 
next cabinet.  Lien advisor Ho Szu-yin told AIT that the 
cabinet proposal was simply \"election rhetoric\" and that the 
Pan-Blue would respect the president\'s constitutional right 
to select his cabinet.  President Chen Shui-bian responded to 
Lien\'s goodwill offer with a similarly conciliatory message 
in his post-election address at DPP headquarters.  Chen 
characterized the December 11 election  as the start of a new 
era of reconciliation and cooperation between the two 
political camps, but he also promised to try to keep his 
campaign promises. 
 
Special Budget: An Early Test 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) An early test case for the two sides\' ability to 
cooperate will present itself when the current LY reconvenes 
in a lame-duck session.  The LY is still required to take 
action on the government\'s regular budget and will also have 
an opportunity to address the USD 18 billion special defense 
procurement budget.  Before the election, senior KMT 
officials promised AIT that they would work with the 
government on the special procurement budget after the 
campaign.  KMT LY Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and other party 
officials cited pressure from Soong\'s PFP as the cause of the 
KMT\'s September decision to reverse its previous supportive 
stance on the budget. 
 
Political Realignment: New Variables? 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The KMT\'s gains relative to its PFP allies adds a new 
variable to the already strained relationship between the two 
Pan-Blue parties.  In his first public appearance after the 
election results were announced, PFP Chairman James Soong 
suggested that it was KMT\'s unwillingness to cooperate with 
the PFP that caused Soong\'s party to lose its 12 seats.  The 
PFP\'s setback is likely to significantly weaken its hand in 
possible future KMT-PFP merger talks.  For his part, KMT 
Chairman Lien Chan suggested that he may be willing to step 
down from power in the coming months.  Flanked by KMT Vice 
Chairmen Ma Ying-jeou and Wang Jin-pyng, KMT Chairman Lien 
Chan told a crowd at KMT party headquarters that he would 
fulfill his term as party chairman (Note: which runs until 
July, 2005), but said that a major goal of the opposition 
alliance will be generational change among its leadership. 
 
Comment: A Good Result 
---------------------- 
 
6. (C) The new LY line-up reduces some of the more immediate 
problems for U.S. interests.  The Pan-Blue victory makes it 
unlikely that controversial proposals such as radical 
constitutional reform will be implemented in the next three 
to four years.  The poor performance by Lee Teng-hui\'s TSU is 
also likely to quiet voices opposed to greater economic and 
political engagement with the Mainland.  The KMT\'s strong 
showing vis-a-vis its PFP coalition partner also offers some 
possibility of a more reasoned debate on defense procurement. 
 If President Chen and KMT Chairman Lien follow through on 
their election night offers of cooperation, Taiwan may also 
have an opportunity to break the gridlock of the past four 
years.  However, the past four years of gridlock between the 
DPP executive and the Pan-Blue legislature is a reminder to 
restrain optimism.  There is a backlog of issues -- ranging 
from rebuilding the military to financial and regulatory 
reform to economic opening to cross-Strait trade and 
investment.  While signs of a more reasoned political 
discourse may be short-lived, the political alignments 
resulting from this election should encourage both sides of 
the partisan divide to move in the right direction.

SUBJECT: South Taiwan Races Intense but Voters Subdued 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) On the eve of Taiwan\'s legislative elections, 
Southern Taiwan\'s races are intensely competitive, 
though most analysts predict little change in the 
overall Pan-Green/Pan-Blue ratio of seats here.  For 
all but the top one or two candidates in each district, 
the races in much of the South remain very close, with 
factors such as vote allocation, vote buying and the 
impact of independents, making the outcomes difficult 
to predict.  Overall voter interest is weak, however, 
with voter turnout expected to be low.  Violence, once 
a regular feature of Southern Taiwan elections, has 
been minimal.  Major rallies held in Kaohsiung City and 
County on December 9 featuring President Chen 
highlighted the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 
Kaohsiung Incident, but were remarkably subdued.  End 
Summary. 
 
Many Races Remain Too Close to Call 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) On the eve of Taiwan\'s legislative elections, 
many Southern Taiwan races remain too close to call, 
particularly in Kaohsiung City (11 seats) and County (9 
seats), and Tainan and Pingtung Counties (8 and 6 seats 
respectively).  In each of these areas, only a couple 
candidates appear strong enough to win with comfortable 
margins, with the bulk of the remaining candidates all 
within reach of the few thousand votes likely necessary 
to win a seat.  The impact of vote allocation 
arrangements, hidden vote buying, and independent 
candidates (who score high in name recognition, but may 
not necessarily do well at the polls), is 
unpredictable.  However, most local political analysts 
expect the overall current balance in Southern Taiwan 
between Pan-Green and Pan-Blue legislative seats to 
change very little.  Pan-Green parties currently hold 
28 of the 48 seats in Southern Taiwan, or just under 60 
percent. 
 
Rallies Marked Kaohsiung Incident Anniversary 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Major rallies were held by the ruling 
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Kaohsiung County 
and City on December 9.  The rallies featured President 
Chen and other key DPP figures, including Premier Yu 
Hsi-kun, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, DPP Secretary 
General Chang Chun-hsiung, and Presidential Office 
Secretary General Su Tseng-chang.  In Kaohsiung County, 
 
SIPDIS 
Chen appeared on-stage with all five of the DPP\'s 
candidates and emphasized the importance of voters 
allocating their votes according to their 
identification card numbers, to ensure all five DPP 
candidates would win.  The two Taiwan Solidarity Union 
(TSU) candidates were not included, as the Pan-Green 
parties are not cooperating on vote allocation in 
Kaohsiung County. 
 
5.  (SBU) In Kaohsiung City, a march and rally on 
December 9 highlighted the 25th anniversary of the 
Kaohsiung Incident.  Attendance at the march was 
extremely low and, as a result, it was shortened. 
Attendance at the evening rally was also much lower 
than expected.  AIT/K estimates around 20,000, mostly 
older Pan-Green supporters, were present.  The crowd 
responded positively to President Chen\'s remarks, which 
reiterated familiar Chen campaign themes including the 
call for replacing \"China\" with \"Taiwan\" in the names 
of state-owned enterprises and overseas representative 
offices, which he pledged to push provided the Pan- 
Green had a legislative majority. 
 
6.  (SBU) Noting that he had been proud to serve as 
defense counsel to the victims of the Kaohsiung 
Incident, Chen urged voters to give the Pan-Green a 
legislative majority so Taiwan could continue its march 
toward democracy.  With a legislative majority, Chen 
said, he would move to put into place a constitution by 
2008 suitable for Taiwan\'s situation.  Chen also 
pledged to establish a Taiwan National Human Rights 
Commission, a National Human Rights Hall and a Taiwan 
Truth Investigation Committee.  The latter, Chen 
implied, would investigate events during KMT rule in 
which dissidents were mistreated, including the 
Kaohsiung Incident. 
 
7.  (SBU) Overall, participants were not nearly as 
enthusiastic as in similar rallies held earlier this 
year for the Presidential election.  Surprisingly, a 
significant number of participants actually stood up 
and left in the middle of President Chen\'s remarks, due 
to the late hour. 
 
Campaigning Intense, But Violence Minimal 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Although the close races in many parts of the 
South have given a frenetic pace to some of the 
candidates\' campaigns, there have been almost no 
clashes between supporters of opposing sides.  One 
exception was in Pingtung County on December 9, when a 
People-first Party (PFP) candidate led supporters to 
the local DPP headquarters to protest remarks by a DPP 
candidate.  Some pushing and shoving between protestors 
and Pan-Green supporters occurred, but police equipped 
with riot gear kept the two sides apart mostly.  There 
were a few injuries, but the incident did not last 
long.  Despite this and a few other confrontations that 
involved yelling between supporters of opposing 
candidates, there is no indication that any major 
violence is likely to occur. 
 
Low Voter Turnout Expected 
-------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Overall, the races in Southern Taiwan, even 
though intensely competitive, do not appear to have 
fired up the voters.  A common theme AIT/K has heard in 
discussions with local political officials and voters 
throughout the South is that there is little public 
interest and enthusiasm in this election, outside of 
core campaign workers.  Weariness from the presidential 
campaign and its aftermath earlier this year is a major 
factor.  Also, the low public opinion of the 
legislature is also playing a role; a just-released 
Gallup/Transparency International poll showed 63 
percent of Taiwan voters consider the Taiwan 
legislature as the institution most influenced by 
corruption.  None of the local party officials or 
political analysts AIT met expected voter turnout in 
this election to exceed 65 percent, and in many areas 
expected it to be closer to 60 percent. 
 
Comment - Another Vigorous Taiwan Election 
------------------------------------------ 
 
10.  (SBU) The intensely-waged campaigns underway in 
Southern Taiwan for tomorrow\'s legislative election 
demonstrate again the vitality of Taiwan\'s democracy. 
The lack of violence, once common in hotly-contested 
Taiwan elections in the South, is notable.  It may 
reflect a maturing of the democratic process here, with 
election campaigns being seen more and more as a 
regular, routine part of political life.  On the other 
hand, it may also be a result of the general lower 
level of interest and enthusiasm local voters have 
demonstrated toward this year\'s legislative campaigns.

1.  (C) Summary: AIT/T supports downgrading Taiwan from the 
Priority Watch List to the Watch List in the current out of 
cycle review.  Doing so will reinforce Taiwan\'s reorientation 
towards protecting intellectual property and provide a timely 
public relations victory for advocates of strong IPR 
protection within the government.  Failure to move Taiwan 
from the PWL to the WL will devalue the 301 process in the 
eyes of Taiwan officials and will not lead to improved 
protection of intellectual property, including pharmaceutical 
data.  With legislative elections held December 11 and a new 
cabinet expected to be named early in 2005, those officials 
who have been most committed to IP protection risk losing 
credibility at a time when changes in personnel are being 
actively considered.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Taiwan\'s improved record of intellectual property 
(IP) protection over the past year plus is incontrovertible. 
From stepped up enforcement actions targeting optical media 
piracy and counterfeit pharmaceuticals, to changes in the law 
that provide greater protection for copyrighted works and 
stiffer penalties for those involved in the manufacture, 
transport and sale of bogus medicines, Taiwan authorities 
have consistently taken actions designed to improve the 
environment for IP in Taiwan.  Much work remains to be done: 
the judicial process continues to be slow and decisions 
uneven, illicit copying on campus continues, Taiwan is 
struggling to control internet piracy and a bill to protect 
pharmaceutical data has not yet been passed by the 
Legislative Yuan (LY).  However, Taiwan authorities are 
taking measures to address all of these concerns.  The 
government is conducting regular IP training for judges and 
prosecutors and establishing a specialized IP court. 
Further, they are working with industry to increase both IP 
education and enforcement on campuses, pressing cases against 
internet pirates Kuro and EZPeer in the courts, and vowing to 
push for speedy passage of Data Exclusivity (DE) legislation 
in the LY. 
 
3.  (C) More and more, government and industry leaders are 
telling AIT that strong IP protection is in the best 
interests of Taiwan\'s consumers and necessary for Taiwan\'s 
continued economic development.  Government officials and 
business leaders agree the future of Taiwan\'s economy will 
depend upon promoting innovative research and development, 
creating media content, and providing goods and services that 
rely on intellectual property.  These same leaders still care 
about Taiwan\'s Special 301 ranking and see in it 
international acknowledgment of their efforts.  Failure to 
recognize the obvious  improvement in Taiwan\'s intellectual 
property climate is not likely to turn Taiwan from its 
current pro-IP path in the long term, but will have the 
unintended effect of damaging the credibility of those who 
have argued that Taiwan needs to improve its IP protection 
regime to combat its international reputation as a haven for 
pirates.  In addition, the credibility of the Special 301 
process will be strengthened by a decision to downgrade 
Taiwan to the Watch List.  Taiwan authorities are more likely 
to continue to be motivated by the Special 301 annual review 
if they believe their positive actions will be recognized. 
 
4.  (C) Data Exclusivity is a key point of contention in the 
discussion of Taiwan\'s Special 301 status.  Industry argues 
that Taiwan\'s failure to pass a DE bill during the current LY 
session betrays a lack of commitment to data protection and 
Taiwan should remain on the PWL as an inducement to passing 
this important legislation.  DE is clearly a WTO TRIPS 
obligation, a position Taiwan\'s Ministry of Health has been 
slow to accept.  Taiwan\'s influential domestic pharmaceutical 
industry has strongly opposed DE protection since the issue 
was brought to the fore in late 2003.  In spite of 
bureaucratic intransigence and the opposition of local 
industry, the Taiwan government drafted and submitted to an 
LY preoccupied with a controversial military budget and 
upcoming elections a bill that addresses most of the concerns 
of the international research pharmaceutical industry. 
During Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks 
held in Washington November 29-30, Taiwan officials, 
including Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Chen, 
clarified questionable terms to the general approval of 
representatives from USPTO and committed the Taiwan 
government to push for passage of the bill after December 11 
elections and, if needed, re-submission of the bill to the 
next Legislative Yuan in February 2005. 
 
5.  (C) Taiwan\'s Special 301 status will not significantly 
influence the government in its decision whether to lobby 
strongly for early passage of the DE bill.  The bill 
originates from the Department of Health, which is primarily 
motivated by perceptions of public safety and consumer 
benefit.  They have moved this bill forward despite the 
opposition of local industry because the Taiwan leadership is 
seeking to improve the US/Taiwan trade relationship in 
pursuit of a Free Trade Agreement.  The leadership justifies 
their support of the bill to local industry by pointing to 
the potential benefits for the development of Taiwan\'s own 
research pharmaceutical industry.  The DOH is not motivated 
by international perceptions of Taiwan\'s intellectual 
property regime.  Conditioning Taiwan\'s 301 status on the 
passage of the DE bill by the date of the regular cycle 
review is unlikely to prove a successful strategy.  Not only 
is DOH relatively unconcerned about PWL/WL status, but the 
installation of the new LY in February means there is 
realistically very little time for consideration of the bill 
before an April deadline for the 301 decision. 
 
6.  (C) Our goal must be to promote continued improvements in 
Taiwan\'s IPR environment.  That objective is best 
accomplished by recognizing Taiwan\'s efforts since the last 
301 review to pass amendments to the copyright law that are 
acceptable to US stakeholders, institutionalize enforcement 
efforts, and continue to expand training and education for 
students, judges, and prosecutors.  Not to do so risks the 
standing of some of the strongest supporters of intellectual 
property protection in the government at a time when cabinet 
and senior level positions are likely to change, risks the 
credibility of the 301 process, and is not likely to enhance 
efforts to protect IPR.

1. (C) Summary: An overly aggressive nomination strategy 
combined with a lower than expected voter turnout to deal the 
Pan-Green camp a surprising defeat in the December 11 
Legislative Yuan (LY) election.  Although the Pan-Green 
alliance of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the 
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) made some small gains over its 
2001 LY performance, the Pan-Green fell 12 seats short of 
winning a controlling majority in the LY and performed well 
below its own expectations and most analysts\' estimates 
(Reftels).  Throughout the election, national-level issues, 
such as constitutional revision and name rectification, 
dominated the media but remained secondary to the 
electorate\'s focus on local-level personality and party 
machine-driven politics.  End Summary. 
 
The Pan-Green\'s Achilles Heel:  Aggressive Nominations 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2. (C) Riding high after its presidential election victory 
earlier this year, the Pan-Green camp implemented an 
aggressive nomination strategy in the hope of translating 
earlier support for President Chen Shui-bian into a majority 
of seats in the LY.  The DPP increased its nominations from 
83 in 2001 to 92 this year, many of the jumps coming in 
traditional Pan-Blue strongholds in northern and central 
Taiwan where the DPP thought it had cultivated enough votes 
to pick up more seats.  The DPP, moreover, appears to have 
continued to support all its candidates in the final two 
weeks without resorting to the tactic of \"dropping stragglers 
to protect the rest\" (ch\'i-pao) as it had done in previous 
elections.  The TSU\'s nomination of 30 candidates, although a 
drop from 40 in 2001, proved too optimistic and damaged the 
Pan-Green as a whole.  TSU candidates soaked up enough Green 
votes to deprive the DPP of an additional 6-7 seats.  The TSU 
candidates were largely unknowns, both locally and 
nationally. As a result, few were strong enough to win. They 
could only siphon off votes that might have won enough DPP 
seats for Chen to reach his announced goal. 
 
3. (C) The overly-aggressive nomination strategy and decision 
not to drop stragglers greatly complicated Pan-Green efforts 
to allocate votes (pei-piao) evenly among its candidates 
within a given district.  Taoyuan County, where the DPP had 
sufficient votes to gain six seats but won only four, is 
illustrative of Pan-Green\'s poor performance in areas of 
potential gain.  The DPP nominated seven candidates -- one 
more than in 2001 -- but because the vote allocation to the 
lower three candidates was spread so evenly (around 30,000 
votes) a rival TSU candidate and a Pan-Blue People First 
Party (PFP) member beat out all three by 1,400 and 3,400 
votes, respectively. 
 
4. (C) Other areas, such as Taipei County, experienced what 
some observers are calling the \"Shen Fa-hui\" phenomenon.  DPP 
members who had been watching Shen trail badly in public 
opinion polls took it upon themselves to \"allocate\" their 
votes to Shen, who ended up the highest DPP vote-getter in 
the district.  According to several post-election polls, 
although DPP supporters were more likely to allocate votes 
than Pan-Blue members, many DPP supporters ignored party 
guidelines on vote allocation and made their own decisions on 
how to cast their votes. 
 
Centrist Voters Stayed Home 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The low voter turnout, 59.16 percent compared to over 
80 percent in the presidential election, also worked against 
the Pan-Green, as many of the large block of centrist voters 
who made President Chen\'s victory in March opted to sit out 
this election.  The DPP had projecting in its internal 
polling a turnout of 62-64 percent.  The missing 3-5 percent, 
had they chosen to show, could have tilted the election in 
the Pan-Green\'s favor.  According to one poll, 25 percent of 
the people who chose not to vote were Pan-Green supporters 
versus 19 percent for Pan-Blue.  Regardless of party 
affiliation, however, the absence of centrist voters was felt 
hardest by \"moderates\" in both camps.  Hsu Chung-hsiung, a 
\"lite Blue\" legislator, pointed out that extreme 
pro-unification and pro-independence candidates came away 
with high vote tallies while moderates like himself and 
Bi-khim Hsiao had much lower vote totals than polls projected 
because centrist voters, their main base of support, did not 
vote in large numbers. 
 
KMT Grassroots Machinery:  Keeps on Tickin\' 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) In contrast to the Pan-Green, the Pan-Blue retention 
of its majority defied analysts\' predictions and suggests 
that the Kuomintang (KMT) extensive grassroots operations may 
not be as worn down as even KMT party insiders thought.  KMT 
Director for Overseas Affairs Ho Szu-yin told AIT the night 
of the election that his party had conducted a focused effort 
to identify and tap into a reserve of \"contingency voters\" 
that they directed in the last two days of the campaign to 
boost struggling candidates.  The Pan-Blue conservative 
approach in nominating its candidates, moreover, allowed the 
Pan-Blue to concentrate its resources and, in the end, 
support for most ex-KMT \"maverick\" candidates shifted back to 
the party candidates.  As a result, the KMT was able to pick 
up 11 seats and preserve the Pan-Blue majority despite the 
PFP\'s loss of 12 seats. 
 
Comment:  A Referendum on Taiwan Independence? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6. (C) In the post-election climate some Taiwan and foreign 
media, as well as local politicians, have touted the election 
results as a clear referendum against a radical Taiwan 
independence agenda.  However, it is difficult to tell 
whether election fatigue or a reaction to constitutional 
reform and \"love Taiwan\" rhetoric, which worked exceedingly 
well for President Chen earlier in the year, were responsible 
for the final outcome.  Pan-Blue leaders and moderates within 
the DPP are pointing to the \"radical\" pro-independence 
rhetoric in a bid to move Chen and the DPP back to a more 
centrist position (Septel).  Despite the rhetorical fury 
unleashed by President Chen and former President Lee Tung-hui 
in the final weeks of the election, most grassroots leaders 
that AIT consulted continue to say that national issues 
played only a small role in LY election politics.  Although 
the DPP defeat may weaken its ability to push the sometimes 
inflammatory and divisive agenda Chen proclaimed during the 
campaign, the reason for the defeat may lie more in the DPP\'s 
tactical and mechanical mistakes.

1. (C) Summary:  Both the ruling and opposition camps are 
taking stock of the surprising results of the December 11 
Legislative Yuan (LY) election.  President Chen Shui-bian is 
facing pressure to resign his position as Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman, and speculation is growing 
over a pending change in the cabinet line-up.  KMT officials 
say that no formal decision will be made until the December 
15 Central Standing Committee (CSC) meeting over party 
Chairman Lien Chan\'s campaign demand that the Pan-Blue 
coalition be empowered to name the next Premier.  While the 
proposal is almost certain to fail, a KMT attempt to pursue 
it could set the stage for continued partisan confrontation 
and renewed gridlock.  Sour post-election relations between 
the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) is also raising 
questions over how solid Pan-Blue\'s lock on the LY will be. 
PFP Chairman James Soong has expressed strong opposition to 
the proposed Pan-Blue merger, citing KMT \"dirty tricks\" 
during the campaign.  Major DPP and KMT meetings on December 
14-15 should offer a clearer sense of how both camps will 
adjust to the new political balance.  End Summary. 
 
Adjusting to a Surprising New Reality 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Both political camps are still taking stock of the 
surprisingly strong KMT showing in the December 11 
Legislative Yuan (LY) election (Ref A).  While the DPP 
marginally increased its number of seats in the election, 
party members are clearly interpreting the results as a major 
setback for the Pan-Green coalition.  President Chen 
Shui-bian has delayed a decision on apportioning blame for 
the election upset, but he has already said he takes full 
responsibility.  Chen is coming under increasing pressure 
from within the DPP to resign from his party Chairman 
position at the December 14 DPP CSC meeting.  Premier Yu 
Shyi-kun and DPP Secretary General Chang Chun-hsiung are also 
likely to be replaced as a result of the DPP\'s worse than 
expected election performance. 
 
3. (C) Although it is AIT\'s assessment that tactical errors 
played the key role in the DPP\'s electoral setback (Septel), 
moderates in the party are touting the results as a 
repudiation of Chen\'s recent rhetorical shift towards the 
pro-independence extreme.  Members of the DPP\'s moderate New 
Tide faction, who stand to gain from any post-election 
personnel house cleaning, have been particularly outspoken in 
their criticism of how Chen ran the election.  Veteran New 
Tide legislator Lin Cho-shui publicly blamed Chen\'s focus on 
\"dark Green\" voters for the low turnout among centrists. 
Fellow New Tide elder Hong Chi-chang said that Chen needed to 
adjust his cabinet as a result of the election by appointing 
more moderates who could work with the Pan-Blue majority. 
The media has already started handicapping future premier 
candidates, with Presidential Office Secretary General Su 
Tseng-chang, DPP Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, and former 
 
SIPDIS 
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chair Tsai Ing-wen topping the 
list. 
 
KMT\'s Choice: Cooperation or Confrontation 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) KMT officials and supporters are understandably elated 
over the party\'s surprisingly strong showing.  However, KMT 
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou warned party officials against 
irrational exuberance.  \"We can celebrate for one night,\" he 
commented after the election results were announced, \"but 
tomorrow we need to remember all the fundamental problems 
Pan-Blue still faces.\"  Ma has responded cautiously to 
pre-election demands by KMT Chairman Lien Chan that Pan-Blue 
take the lead in forming the next Cabinet (Ref B). 
Constitutionally, the President is given sole authority to 
appoint the Premier and his Cabinet, with no provision even 
for LY approval.  However, some in the Pan-Blue have argued 
that the opposition could technically use its legislative 
majority to force a vote of no-confidence in Chen\'s cabinet. 
Moderates like Ma and KMT LY President Wang Jin-pyng have 
warned that this approach would give the President the power 
to dissolve the LY and call for new elections.  KMT spokesmen 
say that no decision on this initiative will be made until 
the December 15 KMT CSC meeting. 
5. (C) Another factor deterring the KMT from seeking control 
of the Cabinet was the threat on December 12 by PFP Chairman 
James Soong that his party would not cooperate with the KMT 
on the issue.  Since the December 11 election, Soong has 
repeatedly lashed out at KMT \"dirty tricks\" that he blames 
for the PFP\'s 12-seat loss.  Soong told a news conference the 
day after the election that the KMT\'s lack of sincerity 
during the campaign made a post-election KMT-PFP merger 
impossible.  While KMT officials say privately they are 
downbeat on prospects for a formal merger given the 
ideological and personality divisions that exist between the 
two parties (Septel), KMT leaders have publicly called for 
the PFP to sit down for talks at an early date. 
Post-election suggestions by Lien Chan and close aides that 
the KMT Chairman would not seek re-election at the March 
party congress may add additional pressure for Soong to step 
aside to allow for a Pan-Blue merger. 
 
Comment: Preliminary Reactions 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The dust has yet to settle fully, but it is clear that 
President Chen has been dealt at least a temporary political 
setback.  DPP moderates can be expected to capitalize on the 
party\'s poor performance to demand a shift towards the 
political center in both policy and personnel.  For its part, 
the KMT is riding high, but ongoing internal divisions and 
friction with the PFP will weaken its ability to effectively 
use its renewed LY majority to confront Chen over issues like 
Cabinet line-ups.  Nevertheless, Chen will need to consider 
the demands for compromise when he selects his new Executive 
Yuan (EY) line-up.  Chen\'s intentions over the Cabinet, and 
perhaps his future policy priorities, may be clarified in his 
much-anticipated December 14 CSC speech.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: TAIWAN\'S LEGISLATIVE ELECTION 
 
 
A)  \"Politics [Should] Return to Basics\" 
 
Professor Chu Yun-han of National Taiwan University\'s 
Department of Political Science said in the centrist, 
pro-status quo \"China Times\" (12/13); 
 
\"The spokesperson of the U.S. State Department said 
`the United States salutes the people of Taiwan\' 
immediately after the outcome of [Saturday\'s] 
legislative elections was revealed, and one can easily 
see [Washington\'s] excitement behind that statement. 
The outcome of the elections, to a certain extent, has 
excluded the possibility of `overall rule\' by the DPP 
government headed by President Chen Shui-bian for the 
next three years.  It has also significantly cut back 
on the room the Pan-Green alliance has for political 
operations intended to promote `a referendum on the new 
constitution\' and `the name changes [plan] for Taiwan.\' 
As far as Washington is concerned, the outcome of the 
elections is equivalent to the de-fusing of a bomb by 
the majority of Taiwan voters -- [a bomb] which might 
finally have triggered a military showdown between the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.  Also, for the time 
being, it has saved the United States from having to 
take the trouble to impose serious measures that might 
jeopardize Taiwan in order to de-fuse the bomb by 
itself.  Moreover, the outcome of the elections has 
offered the United States a special warrant based on 
`respect for the majority opinion in Taiwan\' to monitor 
Chen\'s [words and behaviors] in the future. . 
 
\"Compared with the March presidential election, nearly 
3.5 million voters [chose to be] absent from Saturday\'s 
legislative elections because they are disinclined to 
[get involved in] politics and they are disappointed 
with Taiwan\'s future political direction.  . The 
majority of voters chose to let the Pan-Blue alliance 
retain the majority of [seats in] the Legislative Yuan 
[as a way] of buying themselves a package of 
comprehensive insurance.  They hoped to rule out the 
risk of intensified conflict across the Taiwan Strait 
that might be caused by the DPP [controlling both the 
Presidential Office and Legislative Yuan].  They also 
wanted to rule out the risk of accelerating corruption, 
abuses of power, and violation of laws - a natural 
consequence resulting from the defeat of the Pan-Blue 
alliance as the DPP would become dominant as the ruling 
party.  They hoped to keep the development of Taiwan\'s 
future political situation open so that the legislative 
elections in 2007 and the presidential election in 2008 
will remain an undetermined chess game for both the Pan- 
Blue and Pan-Green alliances. 
 
\"Those roughly 2.2 million voters who supported 
President Chen with regard to his re-election half a 
year ago did not come out to vote or even chose to vote 
for Pan-Blue alliance candidates or independent 
candidates this time.  This means that the issues that 
Chen focused on during the [presidential election] 
campaign failed to meet their expectations as priority 
policies that Chen should deal with in his second term 
of office. .  But Chen\'s administration still tried to 
use the illusionary `national identity\' issue . . 
[This strategy] simply failed to work this time. 
 
\"Public opinion revealed by the outcome of Saturday\'s 
legislative elections contains significant revelations 
for future leaders of both the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green 
alliances.  For the future leaders of the Pan-Green 
camp, Saturday\'s election results have proved that the 
political power of the Pan-Green camp has not grown as 
fast as expected. .  Whether the DPP should choose the 
middle-of-the road approach again will definitely 
become the focus of arguments within the party.  The 
most important revelation of Saturday\'s elections is 
that ... it takes real political achievements to expand 
the political power [of a political party] and [a 
political party] cannot rely on political schemes and 
flair. .\" 
 
B) \"Make a Choice between the Pan-Blue Alliance\'s 
Completing Legislation for a Referendum on Taiwan 
Independence and the DPP\'s Abolishing Its Party 
Platform on Taiwan Independence\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" 
editorialized (12/13): 
 
\"The Pan-Blue alliance has secured a majority of seats 
in the Legislative Yuan [following Saturday\'s 
legislative election].  The first task that the new 
legislature, which will start operating next spring, 
should do is to pass legislation and make `the 
referendum on Taiwan independence\' a legal mechanism. . 
 
\"Objectively speaking, the Pan-Blue alliance\'s reserved 
attitude toward the referendum on Taiwan independence 
and the United States\' attempts to restrain such a 
referendum are both a result of their good intentions, 
hoping that the DPP will not put itself in an 
unfavorable position.  President Chen, however, 
distorted and took advantage of these good intentions, 
which in the end have become an amulet for Chen to 
manipulate the Taiwan independence issue 
unscrupulously. . 
 
\". In other words, both the United States and the Pan- 
Blue alliance hope to hold back the holding of a 
referendum on Taiwan independence, but instead, they 
have been held hostages by the Taiwan independence 
issue. . 
 
\"To change this situation, the first thing [the new 
legislature] should do is to complete legislation for 
holding a referendum on Taiwan independence.  The only 
resolution [to such a dispute] is to return the right 
to decide whether Taiwan should declare independence 
back to the Taiwan people.  If the majority of Taiwan 
people decide that Taiwan should declare independence, 
then we should move ahead [toward such a goal] in full 
gear; if not, then the President should no longer 
trample upon the constitutional rule. . 
 
C) \"Taipei-Washington Ties in the Aftermath of the 
Legislative Election: the United States [Had Better] 
Talk Less\" 
 
Lin Cheng-yi, Research Fellow at the Institute of 
International Relations, National Chengchi University, 
said in an op-ed piece in the conservative, pro- 
unification \"United Daily News\" (12/12): 
 
\". Perhaps the Bush administration may think that since 
the Pan-Blue alliance won the majority of seats in the 
Legislative Yuan, the movements to push for Taiwan\'s 
constitutional reform and name changes will face more 
obstacles, thus reducing the opportunities for the Chen 
Shui-bian administration to provoke Beijing.  But 
Washington should also review its inconsistent position 
toward Taiwan\'s democratic development. 
 
\"[The United States] used to use its arms sales to 
Taiwan as a means to pressure the KMT to lift martial 
law, and now it is citing security as a reason to 
pressure the DPP to restrain its political reforms. 
Washington\'s way of handling the Taiwan referendum 
issue seems to fall into a predicament along the lines 
of  `[We] don\'t like it but [we] cannot stop it.\' . The 
Bush administration now tends to make a more public and 
more immediate response when reacting to unfavorable 
behavior from Taipei, leaving the latter no room for 
imagination.  Given the [fact that the] Pan-Blue 
alliance won the majority in the Legislative Yuan, the 
United States may have less chance to make such 
hegemonic responses.\" 
 
D) \"More Work Needs to Be Done\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
noted in an editorial (12/13): 
 
. \"The election is being interpreted everywhere as a 
rejection of Taiwan separatism.  Certainly there was a 
sense that themes from Chen\'s campaigning would, if 
realized, raise tensions with China.  But there was 
also a wide realization that many of these would be 
impossible to attain, given that the pan-greens would 
never win the super-majority needed to make 
constitutional changes on their own.  So there was a 
strange hollowness about the DPP\'s Chen-centered 
campaign, an emptiness that resulted in some 2.25 
million who voted green in March - a third of the total 
votes for Chen - not showing up at the polls Saturday. 
 
\"But while voters might have balked at the risky road 
the DPP seemed to be taking, Taiwan consciousness is 
not going to go away.  Remember it was the strongly pro- 
reunification People First Party that was the big loser 
in the election, seeing a quarter of its seats go to 
the more moderate Chinese Nationalist Party. .\"

Summary 
------- 
1.  (U) In order to share information and open channels for 
future cooperation on antitrust issues, AIT and the US 
Department of Justice met with officials from the Taiwan 
Fair Trade Commission (TFTC) in Taipei, November 15-16.  DOJ 
and TFTC officials compared antitrust developments in the US 
and Taiwan and committed to establish an intellectual 
property rights (IPR) and competition working group under 
the auspices of AIT and TECRO.  In a separate session, which 
included private US attorneys as well as other Taiwan 
agencies and academics, the two sides gave presentations on 
the importance of antitrust enforcement to economic 
development. DOJ also participated in a competition law 
seminar hosted by the US-Taiwan Business Council and the 
Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association (TSIA). End 
Summary. 
 
DOJ Focuses on Increasing Penalties While Providing Amnesty 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
2.  (U) On November 15, 2004 Deputy Assistant Attorney 
General Makan Delrahim, Special Counsel Stuart Chemtob, and 
DOJ Attorney Andrew Finch met with TFTC representatives for 
3 hours of consultations at TFTC headquarters.  The U.S. 
presentation focused on a dual approach of simultaneously 
increasing penalties for cartel behavior and the benefits of 
the amnesty program. DOJ reported that the US has increased 
the maximum penalty from 3 years in jail to 10 years in jail 
and the maximum criminal fine from US$10 million to US$100 
million. The amnesty program, which offers amnesty to the 
first company from a cartel that comes forward with 
information, now also provides for reduced civil penalties 
for amnesty recipients. The amnesty program is the single 
most effective tool for breaking up cartels.  Mr. Delrahim 
also stressed that an effective antitrust policy should not 
discriminate based upon nationality.  He cited several 
examples of US companies investigated by DOJ for 
anticompetitive practices against foreign firms. 
 
Taiwan Still Developing its Antitrust Enforcement Program 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
3.  (U) Taiwan is also exploring an amnesty program and 
expressed interest in the lessons learned from the DOJ, but 
TFTC Chairman Hwang Tzong-Leh noted that TFTC does not share 
the US DOJ\'s ability to prosecute antitrust violators.  This 
limits TFTC\'s ability to put pressure on and negotiate deals 
with violators.  Taiwan\'s amnesty law is still being 
discussed in the legislature. TFTC Vice Chairman Chen Chi- 
yuan stated that TFTC\'s focus over the next three years 
would be examination of enforcement procedures and 
legislation in order to create a consistent enforcement 
policy. He pointed out that this is necessary because Taiwan 
has a very short antitrust law history compared to the US. 
Chairman Chen also mentioned that Taiwan prefers to educate 
the business community rather than regulate them. He 
particularly stressed that dissemination of information in 
forums such as seminars are as important as enforcement 
actions. 
 
4.  (U) The two groups also discussed their different 
procedures for evaluating mergers.  In 2002 Taiwan amended 
the requirement that two firms intending to merge submit a 
pre-merger application. Now, they require a pre-merger 
notification, meaning that if TFTC does not request more 
information within 30 days, the merger would be 
automatically approved.  TFTC\'s policy also uses market 
share as a benchmark for determining which merger 
applications will require more requests for information. 
When Chemtob questioned this policy, TFTC responded that 
other measures such as assets and sales volume are absolute 
numbers and do not reflect the relative nature of 
monopolies.  TFTC prefers flexible standards that promote 
competition. Chemtob stated DOJ also prefers flexible 
standards that promote competition, but does not consider 
market share to be the primary determiner of anticompetitive 
practice. TFTC asked DOJ whether it placed a greater 
priority on a short time frame for evaluating merger 
applications in order to improve efficiency or on accuracy 
of the data in order to catch more offenders. They also 
asked whether DOJ used a large database of information to 
evaluate which cases constituted compliance problems.  DOJ 
responded that it evaluates mergers on a case-by-case basis. 
Out of 1454 merger notifications in FY 2004, it had to 
scrutinize only about 75 cases, and only in 15 cases (one 
percent) did they issue a second request for information. 
 
Agreement to Establish IPR and Competition Working Group 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
5.  (U) Mr. Delrahim proposed establishing an intellectual 
property and competition working group with the TFTC in 
order to help it distinguish IPR rights from anti- 
competitive practices, based on sound economic policy.  He 
said that DOJ has already established working groups with 
the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) and the Korea Fair 
Trade Commission (KFTC).  Delrahim proposed establishing a 
similar dialogue with Taiwan to include issues such as 
standard setting and unilateral refusals for licensing.  He 
suggested that the working group include both economists and 
attorneys.  Chemtob said the  US Federal Trade Commission 
would participate in the working group.  Vice Chairman Chen 
agreed  that a working group would be an important venue to 
exchange ideas in the IP and competition area and to receive 
advice from DOJ.  He stated that the International 
Competition Network (ICN) was also a good forum to discuss 
issues such as these, as the US and Taiwan are both members. 
 
Seminars Highlight Need for Antitrust Education in Taiwan 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
6.  (U) The afternoon session on November 15 was open to 
officials from several Taiwan ministries as well as 
professors and students from local Universities.  DAAG 
Delrahim spoke about the antitrust enforcement priorities in 
the United States, citing cartels as the highest priority, 
followed by mergers, and lastly, monopolistic behavior.  He 
stressed the importance of international cooperation in 
anti-cartel enforcement and praised the establishment of the 
ICN and intellectual property and competition working groups 
to promote convergence on policy and enforcement.  The 
audience asked why Taiwan, which had much smaller companies 
than the US, should be worried about antitrust issues.  Mr. 
Delrahim explained that antitrust investigation should be 
primarily concerned with preserving the competitive 
environment, not the size or even the market share of the 
firms involved. 
 
7.  (U) Commissioner Yu said that the Taiwan Fair Trade Law 
distinguishes anti-trust issues, such as mergers and 
monopolies, from unfair competition issues, such as false 
advertising, illegal multilevel sales, fraud, and 
counterfeiting.  In the last 12 years Taiwan has handed out 
over NT$1.3 billion in fines and has punished over 3,666 
companies.  He reiterated the TFTC view that punishment 
should not be the primary tool.  Taiwan instead favors 
education, through universities, mass media, and information 
dissemination to the companies so that they can effectively 
self-regulate. 
 
8.  (U) The US-Taiwan Business Council and TSIA organized 
presentations to industry representatives November 16 in 
Hsinchu. The key points discussed included cooperation 
between governments on investigations, which DOJ praised, 
and the inconsistency of penalties and time frame for 
investigations, which private firms complained about.  The 
private attorneys also raised questions about how patent 
pools (groups of companies combining large numbers of 
related patents for licensing arrangements) were hindering 
smaller firms from innovating and, conversely, how patent 
\"trolls\" (companies who buy up large numbers of patents 
without intending to market them and then sue when another 
company markets a product, allegedly based on such patents) 
were hindering innovation by larger firms.  In the last 
session, companies asked how they could protect themselves 
from antitrust suits. Finch stressed that an effective 
compliance program must communicate the severity of possible 
penalties for anti-competitive activity, before it starts to 
occur. 
 
Conclusion 
------- 
9. (U) This conference built on the relationship established 
by last year\'s meetings in Washington.  TFTC appreciated the 
opportunity to personally discuss the development of 
Taiwan\'s enforcement program with DOJ.  More importantly, 
they were able to establish a channel for regular 
communication between Taiwan and US officials. The public 
seminars directly addressed TFTC\'s focus of educating firms 
about antitrust laws rather than regulating them. 
Participants agreed that this kind of education program 
would help prevent compliance problems in the future and 
requested more education programs on this relatively new 
area of Taiwan law.

Bhatia traveled to Taiwan November 25 and 26 to speak at the 
Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) 48th Annual 
Assembly of Presidents Meeting.  A/S Bhatia also met with 
Taiwan civil aviation officials and expressed U.S. interest 
in adding seventh freedom rights for all-cargo flights to 
the U.S.-Taiwan open skies agreement.  Officials responded 
positively but indicated that they would have to consult 
further within the Taiwan government.  AIT/T will continue 
to explore the possibility of adding \"cargo sevenths\" to the 
open skies agreement.  However, prospects for adding it in 
the near future are mixed.  End summary. 
 
AAPA 48th Annual Assembly of Presidents 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) A/S Bhatia traveled to Taiwan November 25 and 26 to 
participate in the AAPA 48th Annual Assembly of Presidents 
Meeting.  A/S Bhatia delivered remarks to the assembly on 
the direction of U.S. aviation policy and changes in the 
U.S. airline industry.  Other speakers at the event included 
Peter Harbison, chief executive of the Centre for Asia 
Pacific Aviation, who spoke on low cost airlines and their 
impact on the Asia Pacific aviation market; Nigel Harvey, 
division director of Macquarie Bank, who addressed rising 
fuel prices; Mark Hue-Williams, regional director of Willis 
Aerospace, who spoke on the aviation insurance market; and 
Nick Brown, senior vice president of AIG Aviation, who gave 
remarks on war and terrorism insurance.  Note: Texts or 
summaries of all of the remarks are available at the AAPA 
website at www.aapairlines.org.  End note. 
 
Civil Aeronautics Administration DG Chang 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) While in Taiwan, A/S Bhatia paid a courtesy call on 
Taiwan Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director 
General Billy Chang.  A/S Bhatia was accompanied by FAA Asia 
Pacific Region Director Elizabeth Erickson and AIT/T 
econoff.  A/S Bhatia noted the strong relationship between 
Taiwan and the U.S. on aviation issues.  He pointed out the 
benefits to both sides offered by the bilateral \"open skies\" 
agreement.  He praised Taiwan\'s recent progress in improving 
air safety and expressed U.S. willingness to continue to 
work with Taiwan in this area.  A/S Bhatia also expressed 
U.S. appreciation for the strong relationship between Boeing 
and Taiwan carriers China Airlines and Eva Airways. 
 
4. (U) A/S Bhatia told Chang that the U.S. is interested in 
expanding the bilateral open-skies agreement to include 
seventh freedom rights for all-cargo flights.  \"Cargo 
sevenths\" would allow U.S. airlines to fly cargo routes 
between Taiwan and a third location without serving the 
United States.  So, for example, a U.S. carrier could 
conduct a cargo flight between Taipei and Singapore without 
having the flight serve any point in the United States.  A/S 
Bhatia pointed out that China Airlines and Eva Air are both 
very competitive in the international air cargo market and 
would stand to benefit if the U.S. granted Taiwan \"cargo 
sevenths.\"  Chang raised no objections to adding \"cargo 
sevenths\" to the bilateral agreement but said that the 
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) would 
make the final decision on such a proposal. 
 
5. (U) Chang explained Taiwan\'s interest in joining the 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as a full 
member or being allowed to participate in ICAO events as an 
observer.  He said that participation in ICAO would improve 
Taiwan\'s communication with other civil aviation authorities 
in the region and would allow Taiwan to take advantage of 
ICAO training programs.  A/S Bhatia noted the difficulties 
imposed by Taiwan\'s current status and offered to help 
facilitate Taiwan\'s access to ICAO information. 
 
Ministry of Transportation and Communications VM Tsai 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6. (U) In a brief meeting with MOTC Vice Minister Tsai Duei, 
A/S Bhatia again expressed U.S. interest in expanding the 
U.S.-Taiwan open skies to include \"cargo sevenths.\"  Tsai 
agreed that \"cargo sevenths\" could be beneficial but said 
that he would like to discuss this issue with CAA.  A/S 
Bhatia also raised U.S. concerns about auto traffic safety. 
He emphasized that reducing the number of deaths caused by 
auto accidents is one of Secretary Mineta\'s highest 
priorities.  He pointed out that the U.S. and Taiwan already 
had a positive dialogue on this issue and looked forward to 
continued cooperation. 
 
Comment - Prospects for Cargo Sevenths 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Chang and Tsai\'s receptive but non-committal 
reactions on the proposal to add \"cargo sevenths\" to the 
bilateral are consistent with Taiwan\'s response to AIT\'s 
efforts in 2003 to advance the same proposal.  Some agencies 
and individuals in the Taiwan government support further 
liberalization of the air cargo market with \"cargo 
sevenths.\"  However, interest in protecting domestic 
carriers strong advantage in the air cargo industry has thus 
far prevented the Taiwan government from reaching a 
consensus to agree to such a proposal.  Taiwan\'s carriers 
rely heavily on cargo shipments to make them profitable and 
support continued restrictions of international 
participation in Taiwan\'s cargo routes.  Taiwan\'s recently 
concluded bilateral air services agreement with South Korea 
excludes cargo fifth freedom rights (ref A).  Taiwan and 
South Korea signed the new agreement on September 1 after a 
dozen years without direct air links.  AIT/T will continue 
to urge Taiwan to add \"cargo sevenths\" to our bilateral 
aviation agreement.  However, at this time, the Taiwan 
government is not likely to grant \"cargo sevenths.\"  End 
comment. 
 
8. (U) A/S Bhatia has cleared on this cable.

The conservative, pro-unification English-language

\"The surprise outcome of Saturday\'s legislative 
elections, blocking the pro-independence President Chen 
Shui-bian\'s bid to control the legislature, is a relief 
for Beijing, Washington and Taiwan\'s neighbors. . 
 
\"It is easy to conclude that the results were `an upset 
win for the opposition,\' `a setback for Chen\' and `most 
people favor status quo.\'  And it is also convenient to 
say that under Chen\'s dictatorship, the green group\'s 
campaign obviously had overplayed its hand, ignoring 
the people\'s wishes for stability and harmony and 
pushing more boldly its anti-China platforms. 
 
\"But the electorate\'s support for the blue group could 
not have increased if Washington had not sent timely 
and blunt warnings against Chen\'s provocative rhetoric. 
. 
 
\"Obviously, voters chose to heed America\'s caution and 
not to rewrite history.  Polls show 2.2 million voters 
who had supported his re-election bid in March changed 
their minds or simply stayed away from the ballot box. 
But the opposition\'s majority of two is too slim to 
check the all-powerful presidential office, promising 
prolonged political instability. 
 
\"Cross-strait peace will depend on Washington 
restraining Taipei, Beijing being less assertive, and 
on the prudence of Taiwan\'s people who already have 
freedom and de facto independence and apparently aren\'t 
willing to gamble for de jure independence merely as a 
gesture of defiance.\" 
 
B) \"New Poll Deals Chen a Serious Blow\" 
 
Osman Tseng of the conservative, pro-unification, 
English-language \"China Post\" noted (12/13): 
 
\"The results of the just ended Saturday legislative 
election delivered many important messages.  Among them 
is a revelation that proves to us incorrect a current 
widely held perception:  The ideology of independence, 
or Taiwanese nationalism, has acquired such widespread 
popular support that it now has become the mainstream 
political faith in Taiwan. . 
 
\"That a greater portion of the voters chose to support 
the pro-status quo `pan-blue\' suggests that these 
people, instead of backing the independence cause, 
prefer to see Taiwan continuing to preserve its current 
political standing. . 
 
\"With a renewed mandate, the opposition alliance could 
provide stronger checks on the Chen administration, 
necessitated by the fact that the government team has 
become increasingly unresponsive. . 
 
\"The Saturday legislative poll in a sense was a no- 
confidence against Chen.  . The refusal of the voters 
to answer to Chen\'s calls and give him control of the 
lawmaking body was a serious blow to him.  Without the 
backing of the legislature, it would become even more 
difficult, if not impossible, for him to enact a new 
Constitution by a referendum.  His recently launched 
name-rectification plan and the broader de-sinicization 
campaign being carried out by his administration can be 
expected to face even stronger objections from the re- 
elected Legislature, to be installed in February. .\"

\"[Last Saturday\'s Legislative] Election Is Not the Only 
[Thing] President A-Bian Has Failed to Win\" 
 
Journalist Chang Hui-ying noted in the centrist, pro- 
status quo \"China Times\" (12/15): 
 
\"When it comes to the outcome of [last Saturday\'s] 
legislative elections, what the DPP failed to win was 
not votes or seats [in the Legislative Yuan] alone. 
Instead, President Chen Shu-bian has in fact lost two 
of the most valuable things - namely, the respect and 
trust of the people [of Taiwan], and this was a major 
factor leading to the DPP\'s electoral defeat. . 
 
\"When [a president] has lost his people\'s respect for 
him, it means he has also lost their trust.  Chen has 
always made beautiful promises whenever he is defeated. 
Now he is vowing to be the president of all the people 
of Taiwan.  But people can hardly forget the fact that 
he has openly used Taipei-Washington ties and cross- 
Strait relations as a weapon to attack [candidates of 
other political parties], and has put the safety of all 
the people of Taiwan at risk.  Given the fact that Chen 
has more than once used concrete words and actions to 
tell the Taiwan people that he looks upon himself and 
his position as the first thing that he should protect, 
followed by the interests of his party and then the 
interests of his country, how many people dared to [use 
their votes] to grant him unrestricted power again? 
 
\"As a state leader, Chen has not only lost the respect 
and trust of his people but has also lost the respect 
and trust of Taiwan\'s most important ally - the United 
States.  The mutual trust between Taipei and Washington 
has been badly damaged, and the United States has been 
troubled enough as a result of Chen\'s political 
manipulations.  As a result, Washington has decided to 
actively interfere with everything concerning Taiwan, 
even the change of names of its state-owned 
enterprises.  But the real reason behind all of this is 
because the United States has lost even the slightest 
bit of respect for Chen as the president of Taiwan, and 
it no longer trusts Chen\'s policies or pledges. 
 
\"Compared to the minor defeat in the legislative 
elections, [losing the respect and trust of the United 
States] is a major defeat for Chen.  The DPP failed in 
Saturday\'s elections, but Chen as the leader of Taiwan 
is the one that has suffered a really severe defeat.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) While Southern Taiwan voted more or less as expected 
in the December 11 legislative election, with virtually no 
change in the overall Pan-Green/Pan-Blue ratio of legislative 
seats, there were a few surprises in individual races.  Two 
independent candidates in Kaohsiung City who polled very high 
prior to the election both lost, showing how important party 
organizations were in mobilizing the vote in an election with 
very low turnout.  A surprisingly strong showing by People 
First Party (PFP) candidates in Kaohsiung and Tainan cities 
was less about the PFP than about the individuals running and 
the methods they employed to mobilize votes.  The 
surprisingly weak performance of the Taiwan Solidarity Union 
(TSU), which lost a seat overall in the South, was due 
primarily to over-nomination of Pan Green candidates and poor 
vote allocation coordination with the ruling party.  Contrary 
to the widespread view now circulating that the election 
result marked a Pan-Green setback, policy and party 
affiliations actually played little role in the outcomes of 
most of the local races in the South.  End Summary. 
 
Southern Races Overall As Expected 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) In contrast to the rest of Taiwan, the southern vote 
in the December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) election was very 
much as analysts had predicted (reftels).  There was 
virtually no change in the ratio of seats between the 
Pan-Green and Pan-Blue camps.  Out of the 48 seats in 
Southern Taiwan up for grabs, the DPP took 25, KMT 13, PFP 5 
and TSU 2.  While the DPP seat total remained unchanged, the 
KMT and TSU each lost one seat, and the PFP picked up one 
(two, if you count a PFP seat that had been vacant).  The 
result was consistent with most pre-election estimates which 
saw the South as an area in which the Pan-Green had done so 
well four years ago, that it was unlikely to be able to 
improve on its existing 60/40 dominance of the Southern 
Taiwan LY seats. 
 
Leading Independents in Surprise Losses 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) There were surprises, however, in individual races. 
Two independents in Kaohsiung City who had polled very high 
prior to the election both lost.  Independent incumbent LY 
member Su Ying-kuei, a former TSU legislator who was expelled 
from the TSU a year ago for accusing colleagues of 
corruption, had made a strong impression as a \"clean 
political reformer\" and made a strong showing in pre-election 
public opinion polls in Kaohsiung\'s northern district. 
However, on election day he came in eighth, with less than 
half the votes needed to win one of that district\'s six 
seats.  In Kaohsiung\'s southern district, popular television 
talkshow hostess, Cheng Li-wen, had likewise polled well 
among her district\'s 11 candidates, only to come in seventh 
on election day, far short of winning one of that district\'s 
five seats.  The failure of the two independents was widely 
seen as a confirmation of conventional wisdom that party 
backing is critical to mobilizing the vote, particularly in 
elections with low voter turnout.  In the cases of both Su 
and Cheng, large numbers of younger voters and moderate 
swing-voters, who were among their strongest supporters, 
apparently sat out the election. 
 
4.  (C) By contrast, leading Non-partisan Solidarity Union 
(NPSU) candidates in Penghu (incumbent Lin Bin-kun) and 
Pingtung (incumbent Tsai Hao) Counties both won easily. 
Unlike the independents in Kaohsiung City, Lin and Tsai are 
long-standing local political figures with deep pockets and 
well-developed political networks.  Both are widely believed 
to have links to organized crime organizations and have been 
linked to corruption scandals. 
 
PFP Candidates With Surprise Wins in the Deep Green South 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
5.  (C) The PFP did surprisingly well in Southern Taiwan, the 
traditional base of the Pan-Green.  PFP wins, however, appear 
more a reflection of individual candidate appeal and of 
better nomination strategy, than an indicator that the South 
is becoming less \"Green.\"  In Tainan City, PFP candidate Kao 
Si-po surprised most observers with a strong win in one of 
Taiwan\'s \"Greenest\" cities.  Kao, the 37-year-old son of KMT 
at-large legislator Kao Yu-jen, ran an unorthodox campaign 
that downplayed his PFP affiliation and targeted young people 
with activist campaign events replete with pop music. 
Despite the low voter turnout, especially among young people, 
Kao\'s approach paid off in his third-place finish.  More 
surprisingly, Kao managed to win without doing what the KMT 
most feared -- undermining the two KMT candidates in the 
race.  While the KMT candidates also won, Kao\'s strong finish 
pushed the sole TSU candidate to seventh among those vying 
for Tainan\'s six LY seats.  Kao benefitted from being the 
only PFP candidate; in 2001 the PFP had split its votes 
between two candidates, both of whom just missed winning. 
Kao also likely benefitted from his family connections -- 
besides being the son of an old guard KMT figure, Kao is also 
married to Jessica Chou, a key aide to Taipei Mayor Ma 
Ying-jeou, and his sister is married to  Taoyuan\'s KMT 
Magistrate, Chu Li-lun. 
 
6.  (C) The PFP also did well in Kaohsiung City, where its 
two candidates, both seen as competitive but falling behind 
in late public opinion polls, won convincingly.  In 
Kaohsiung\'s northern district, PFP Policy Director, Chang 
Hsien-yao, won easily despite widespread criticism that he 
was a \"carpetbagger\" who moved to Kaohsiung only to run in 
the LY race.  As in Tainan City, Chang benefited from an 
improved PFP strategy in Kaohsiung over that of 2001, when 
the PFP had spread its votes evenly in Kaohsiung\'s northern 
district, home to a large number of retired military, among 
three candidates.  In Kaohsiung\'s southern district, the sole 
PFP candidate, Chou-yi, also easily won re-election, despite 
a poor showing in pre-election polls and a poor image 
stemming from his involvement in violent protests following 
the March 2004 presidential election.  Both Pan-Blue and 
Pan-Green officials had told AIT/K before the election that 
Chou-yi had arranged massive vote buying through local 
gambling syndicates, but it remains unclear whether the 
allegations are true. 
 
Pan-Green Vote Allocation Uneven; TSU Takes the Hits 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7.  (C) Publicly announced Pan-Green efforts to allocate 
votes among candidates in Southern Taiwan proved highly 
uneven, with TSU candidates suffering in most cases.  In 
Kaohsiung\'s Northern District, vote allocation between three 
DPP and one TSU candidate apparently worked, with all four 
being elected, despite predictions that the TSU candidate 
would lose.  In Kaohsiung\'s southern district, however, it 
appears so many votes shifted to a DPP candidate, Huang 
Chao-hui, identified before the election as struggling, that 
he ended up garnering so many votes that another DPP 
incumbent, Tang Jin-chuan, unexpectedly lost.  In Kaohsiung 
County, DPP vote allocation helped ensure all five of its 
candidates won re-election.  However, the DPP had refused to 
share vote allocation with the TSU, arguing -- correctly as 
it turned out -- that the TSU should have nominated only one 
candidate instead of two.  As a result, both candidates lost 
in a surprise setback for the TSU. 
 
DPP Luck Holds Seats in Chen\'s Home County 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) On a straight vote in Tainan County, the DPP would 
have lost one seat had it not been for election rules 
requiring a female winner in districts of a certain size. 
While four of the DPP\'s five candidates in Tainan won easily, 
the fifth, Ye Yi-jin, lost by 800 votes to a KMT candidate, 
Guo Tian-cai.  However, since none of the other four DPP, two 
KMT and one independent winning candidates were women, Guo 
was skipped over and the final of Tainan County\'s eight LY 
seats was awarded to the DPP\'s Ye. 
 
Comment:  Outcome in the South Not a Referendum on Policy 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
9.  (C) Despite widespread media debate as to what the 
election outcome says about Taiwan voters\' views of the Chen 
Administration, few of our interlocutors saw the LY election 
in \"national\" terms.  Instead, local party officials 
emphasized to AIT/K that each district and each candidate 
presented a different set of dynamics, with party affiliation 
only significant in terms of access to resources and voter 
mobilization.  Voter allocation, which many had expected to 
be key to either side\'s victory, proved to be highly uneven 
and unpredictable.  Overall, the only factor that all of our 
interlocutors agreed was decisive was voter turnout.  The 
even-lower-than-expected 59 percent turnout seemed to leave 
all parties\' strategies in a mess, with none particularly 
satisfied that the election had played out the way it had 
expected.  Overall, the results in the South were consistent 
with expectations that neither side would pick up seats. 
However, within the individual districts, each party will be 
spending time trying to figure out what happened and why.

SUBJECT: CHEN TAKES THE FALL FOR DPP LY SETBACK 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Acting Director David J. Keegan, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: President Chen Shui-bian resigned his 
position as Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman 
December 14 to accept full responsibility for the worse than 
expected showing in the December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) 
election.  In a speech to the DPP\'s Central Standing 
Committee (CSC), Chen said he would withdraw from party 
operations in order to serve all Taiwan\'s people.  The same 
day, the DPP\'s party headquarters issued a report blaming the 
party\'s provocative campaign rhetoric and over-aggressive 
nominations for its poor election showing.  Although 
disappointed by the December 11 results, party moderates say 
the failure of Chen\'s campaign strategy and the electoral 
defeat for Lee Teng-hui\'s Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) 
together strengthen their hand within the DPP government. 
DPP officials say that the President appears to be looking 
for a more conciliatory approach to working with the 
opposition camp, but how far he is prepared to compromise on 
issues like personnel appointments and policy priorities may 
depend on whether the Pan-Blue coalition is able to maintain 
the increasingly shaky KMT-People First Party (PFP) alliance. 
 End Summary. 
 
Chen Takes Full Responsibility 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) President Chen Shui-bian announced his resignation as 
DPP Chairman December 14 to take responsibility for the 
party\'s worse than expected performance in the December 11 LY 
election.  Chen said that he was removing himself from his 
party role in order to be the president of \"all of Taiwan\'s 
23 million people.\"  The president promised to rule \"with 
humility\" over the coming four years, and urged the 
opposition to cooperate with the ruling coalition on issues 
of governance.  Chen told the party\'s CSC that the election 
results represented a setback for himself personally, but not 
a defeat for the DPP, which he noted was the only party in 
the December 11 election that increased its vote share over 
2001. 
 
3. (C) DPP officials publicly welcomed Chen\'s decision to 
accept full responsibility for the election disappointment. 
DPP Secretary General Chang Chun-hsiung, who was asked by 
Chen to remain in his post, submitted a report to the CSC on 
December 14 analyzing the DPP\'s performance.  The report 
assessed that the DPP failed to reach its pre-election 
targets due to a combination of overly aggressive nominations 
and use of provocative campaign themes that alienated 
centrist voters.  DPP Taipei County Magistrate Lin Hsi-yao, a 
ranking New Tide faction member, told AIT that both the 
nomination strategy and the choice of campaign slogans were 
formulated by the president personally.  \"We warned him 
repeatedly during the campaign about these things,\" Lin told 
AIT on December 14, \"but since he chose to ignore us, he will 
have to bear the responsibility.\" 
 
Moderates Re-energized 
---------------------- 
 
4. (C) Although disappointed by the party\'s poor showing, DPP 
moderates say they do see a silver lining.  The New Tide 
faction increased its representation from 17 to 22 seats in 
the LY, and expects to recruit more newly elected DPP 
legislators into the faction over the coming weeks.  Taipei 
County\'s Lin said the failure of Chen\'s hard-line campaign 
strategy and the poor showing by Lee Teng-hui\'s TSU has also 
bolstered DPP moderates.  \"We will be much more forceful in 
the future in standing up to Chen when we think he\'s wrong,\" 
Lin asserted.  Lin added that the TSU\'s poor performance will 
undermine Lee Teng-hui\'s influence, and likely marks the 
beginning of the end for his party.  \"At some point in the 
coming months, we will start talking about how to absorb the 
TSU into the DPP,\" Lin commented. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
Who Wants to Be DPP Chairman? 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Following Chen\'s resignation, the DPP\'s CSC appointed 
party LY Caucus Leader Ker Chien-ming as interim Chairman 
pending a party election for a permanent replacement. 
President Chen reportedly had urged Vice President Annette Lu 
to take the position, but she and the other three DPP 
presidential hopefuls (Presidential Office Secretary General 
Su Tseng-chang, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, and Premier Yu 
Shyi-kun) have all ruled out taking the job.  Many DPP 
officials tell AIT privately that the Chairman post is seen 
as a consolation prize for the first candidate eliminated 
from contention for the 2008 presidential race.  DPP 
Secretary General Chang Chun-hsiung and other senior party 
 
SIPDIS 
officials are expected to keep their current jobs until the 
new Chairman is announced, likely at a party conference on 
February 1, 2005. 
 
Cabinet Changes Ahead 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) While party personnel will remain in place for the 
time being, Chen administration officials tell AIT to expect 
major Cabinet changes in the coming weeks as President Chen 
considers ways to improve relations with the 
opposition-controlled LY.  Given Premier Yu\'s difficult 
relationship with the LY, especially since March 20, he is 
almost certain to be replaced before the new LY convenes in 
February.  Officials say that Chen has not yet decided 
whether to appoint a DPP heavyweight like Su or Hsieh, or 
choose a less partisan technocrat, such as former MAC Chair 
Tsai Ing-wen or former Vice Premier Lin Hsin-yi.  How Chen 
 
SIPDIS 
handles personnel assignments, both for the Cabinet and for 
the upcoming round of Control Yuan (CY) appointments, could 
offer an insight into his approach to policymaking in the 
coming years.  Taipei County Magistrate Lin commented that if 
Chen allows Pan-Blue leaders input into his upcoming 
personnel decisions, it will indicate that he is sincere 
about staying above the political fray.  National Security 
Council (NSC) Senior Advisor Chen Chung-hsin told AIT that 
the mood inside the Presidential Office has clearly shifted 
since December 11.  Chen said that NSC officials were 
instructed on December 13 to prepare for a more bipartisan 
approach to policymaking in the coming four years. 
 
Temporary Setback 
----------------- 
 
7. (C) Nevertheless, some in the DPP say that the president\'s 
conciliatory rhetoric is only a passing phenomenon.  DPP 
Deputy Secretary General Lee Ying-yuan told AIT that Chen\'s 
actions over the past several days have been largely symbolic 
and asserted that he will remain very much in control of the 
DPP and the political agenda.  Lee also disputed his own 
party\'s official assessment of its election performance. 
Lee, a polished spokesman for the fundamentalist wing of the 
party, argued that tactical errors and general voter fatigue 
rather than overly provocative rhetoric accounted for the 
DPP\'s December 11 setback. 
 
Comment: A New Era or More of the Same? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Chen\'s resignation from the DPP Chairmanship was 
expected regardless of the party\'s December 11 performance. 
Nonetheless, the fact that Chen was willing to accept full 
responsibility for the election setback should help reduce 
the backlash within the DPP against his heavy-handed role in 
the campaign.  Whether Chen will fulfill his promise to 
remain above the political fray is less clear.  Many will be 
inclined to say that Chen has gone through such cycles of 
reconciliation before and come out swinging.  The Pan-Blue 
majority is not as solid as it may appear from the outside, 
and leading KMT figures like Ma Ying-jeou have warned that 
the Pan-Blue\'s small victory could quickly turn into a large 
defeat if post-election internal squabbles lead to splits in 
the opposition ranks.  Given this prospect, Chen may look for 
opportunities to exploit internal divisions in the Pan-Blue. 
This may mean a return to the all too familiar mud-slinging 
of the past four years, or it may provide opportunities for 
the DPP to move forward on reform by building coalitions 
across the Blue-Green divide.

SUBJECT: Taiwan Economic Review for November 2004 
 
 
1.  This cable summarizes selected economic events in Taiwan 
in November 2004: 
 
- S&P Rating 
 
- China-ASEAN FTA 
 
- Economic Performance 
 
- WTO 
 
- Cross-Strait Economic Normalization 
 
- Environment 
 
S&P Downgrades Taiwan\'s Debt Outlook 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  At the end of November Standard & Poor\'s downgraded the 
its outlook for Taiwan\'s debt from \"stable\" to \"negative.\" 
The rating on the debt remains at AA-, but S&P changed its 
outlook based on a growing budget deficit and increased 
cross-Strait tension.  Taiwan officials reacted quickly to 
express continued confidence despite the downgrade. 
Taiwan\'s debt rating remains second only to Singapore in 
Asia, higher than South Korea and Hong Kong and four steps 
above China.  Earlier in November, Morgan Stanley increased 
its weighting for Taiwan as a destination for investment 
funds, and its well-connected office manager called the 
Standard & Poor announcement \"a non-event.\" 
 
Impact of China-ASEAN FTA on Taiwan 
----------------------------------- 
3.  The November 29, 2004 announcement that China and 10 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member 
countries signed a free trade agreement (FTA) fueled local 
concerns about Taiwan being marginalized politically as well 
as economically.  In response, both Minister of Economic 
Affairs Ho Mei-yueh and Council for Economic Planning and 
Developments Vice Chairman Yeh Ming-feng quickly issued 
statements downplaying the short-term importance of the 
agreement.  Ho noted that there were still many difficulties 
for China and ASEAN to overcome before they could achieve 
free trade.  Yeh noted Taiwan\'s sound economic fundamentals 
and strength in international trade and investment as 
reasons Taiwan would not be ignored.  Kung Ming-hsin, the 
Director of Mainland Affairs Division at Taiwan Institute of 
Economic Research, said that the type and scale of 
production in Taiwan is different from that of China and 
ASEAN, and the short-term economic impact on Taiwan would be 
slight. 
Economic Performance Thru October 2004 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  According to official forecasts released in November, 
Taiwan\'s economic growth is expected to slow from 7.3 
percent in the first half to 4.7 percent in the second half 
of 2004 and drop further to 4.5 percent in the second half 
of 2005.  The slowdown follows declines in the growth of 
exports, industrial production, and private investment. 
Factors behind the economic slowdown include lower U.S. 
demand for Taiwan\'s exports and higher oil prices.  Export 
orders continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate than 
earlier in the year, but Taiwan\'s overseas production bases 
in China now fill a large share of these orders. 
WTO 
--- 
 
5. At the APEC Ministerial Meeting in Santiago, Chile on 
November 19 Taiwan Economic Minister Ho Mei-yueh and her 
Russian counterpart completed bilateral negotiations on 
Russia\'s WTO accession.  In the first eight months of 2004, 
the two-way trade between Taiwan and Russia amounted to 1.93 
billion US dollars, exceeding the 2003 total for the entire 
year.  In 2003, the two-way trade totaled 1.61 billion US 
dollars, 35.7 percent growth over 2002 and 5.9 percent of 
Taiwan\'s total external trade. 
 
6. Taiwan\'s representative office in Geneva filed a motion 
with the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) on November 18 
against India\'s anti-dumping tariffs on seven Taiwan 
products.  Jeremy Shen, Director of the Multilateral Trade 
Affairs Division in the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), 
claimed that the Indian government did not conduct any 
investigation prior to levying the tariffs and that the 
tariffs were unfair and unjustified.  This is the first time 
Taiwan has used the WTO DSB mechanism. 
 
PRC Blocks Cross-Strait Investment 
---------------------------------- 
 
7.  In late November 2004, the Mainland Affairs Council 
(MAC) announced a plan to permit securities firms to set up 
subsidiaries in China. The plan set a minimum capital 
requirement of NT$7 billion, a minimum capital adequacy 
ratio of 200% and stipulated that the investment in China 
may not exceed 10% of the net worth of the securities firm. 
Sixteen securities firms met these requirements and were 
deemed qualified for investment in China.  China requires 
economies to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) before 
allowing that economy to invest in China\'s securities firms. 
Such an MOU between Taiwan and China is unlikely.  China is 
therefore unlikely to allow Taiwan securities firms to 
establish subsidiaries in China. 
 
Environmental 
------------- 
 
8.  At the annual International Commission on the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) meeting in New Orleans 
(Nov 14-21), ICCAT warned that Taiwan needed to improve its 
adherence to fishing allocations next year, or risk losing 
its \"cooperating non-contracting party\" status.  Taiwan\'s 
Deputy Administrator James Sha who attended the meeting 
agreed that his fleet had a problem and set out a multi-year 
payback scheme, whereby Chinese Taipei would harvest fewer 
bigeye tuna than its share, in order to pay back its 
overharvest. 
 
9.  AIT ESTOFF attended theThe American Institute in Taiwan 
and the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office held  AIT/TECRO 
technical environmental talks in San Francisco from November 
21-23.  The two sides reviewed Oongoing cooperative projects 
were reviewed and it was agreed to establish criteria for 
deciding on future cooperative projects.  Participants also 
agreed that two priority areas for future cooperation are 
assessing mercury levels in Taiwan\'s air, food and water and 
analyzing levels of air pollution from the Mmainland. in 
Taiwan were two priority areas for future cooperation.

TAGS: EINV, EFIN, ECON, TW 
SUBJECT: Taiwan Growth Slowing 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  Taiwan\'s economic growth is expected to drop from 7.3 
percent in the first half of 2004 to 4.7 percent in the 
second half following declines in export growth, industrial 
production, and private investment.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Economic Slowdown 
----------------- 
 
2.  In late November 2004, the Directorate General of 
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) adjusted Taiwan\'s 
estimated 2004 economic growth upward for the fifth time to 
nearly six percent.  At the same time, DGBAS predicted 
Taiwan\'s economic growth would slow from 7.3 percent in the 
first half of 2004 to 4.7 percent in the second half and 
further down to 4.5 percent in the second half of 2005. 
 
3.  Tsai Hung-kun, Deputy Director of the DGBAS\' Statistics 
Bureau, attributed Taiwan\'s economic slowdown mainly to 
three factors: rising interest rates and oil prices and the 
\"negative wealth effect\" of falling stock prices.  The U.S. 
Federal Reserve Board\'s raising interest by one percentage 
point during June - October dampened lowered demand for 
Taiwan\'s exports.  Higher oil prices pushed up prices and 
dampened Taiwan consumer spending in Taiwan.  A decline in 
Taiwan stock prices in the third quarter of 2004 reduced the 
wealth of local consumers,  and further weakeninged their 
confidence and demand. 
 
Export and Import Growth Down 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  According to DGBAS, export growth in 2004 declined from 
29 percent in the second quarter to 21 percent in the third 
quarter and will fall to an estimated 12 percent in the 
fourth quarter.  Deputy Director Tsai projected that export 
growth would drop to seven percent in 2005.  He predicted 
import growth would slow from 40 percent in the second 
quarter to 19 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 and down 
to six percent in 2005. 
 
Orders Filled by Offshore Production Bases 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  However, the growth of export orders has not declined 
along with the decline in growth of exports.  This reflects 
the fact that Taiwan offshore production factories fill an 
increasing percentage of export orders received by Taiwan 
companies.  According to a Ministry of Economic Affairs 
(MOEA) survey, export orders have grownth at a year-on-year 
rate of 26 percent for the first ten months of 2004.  A 
survey by the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed that 
Taiwan business firms filled nearly 40 percent of the export 
orders by shipments from overseas production factories and 
that 60-70 percent of those shipments came from China. 
 
Strong Competition from South Korea 
----------------------------------- 
6.  According to MOEA officials, strong competition from 
South Korea is eroding Taiwan business firms\' market in 
China, particularly in the high-tech area.  Demand from 
Taiwan-invested down-stream flat panel display firms in 
China contributed to triple-digit growth in Taiwan\'s exports 
of flat panels and related products to China in the first 
half of 2004.  However, according to MOEA, South Korean 
competitors have successfully snatched a large share of this 
market in China by undercutting Taiwan prices on these 
products.  As a result, Taiwan\'s exports of flat panel 
products posted a decline from 140 percent growth in the 
first seven months to 86 percent in August and 20 percent in 
September 2004.  South Korea replaced Taiwan as the second 
largest source of China\'s imports in September 2004. 
 
Investment and Money Supply Growth Decline 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7.  Slower export growth in the second quarter was reflected 
in rising inventories in the fourth quarter and a drop in 
private investment growth from 33 percent to 20 percent. 
DGBAS predicts private investment growth in 2005 would slip 
to nine percent.  Industrial growth dropped from 14 percent 
in the first quarter and 15 percent in the third quarter to 
three percent in October 2004.  Another indication of 
economic slowdown is declining money supply growth.  M1B 
growth in October 2004 at 14.7 percent was the lowest in 14 
months.  Growth in M2 plus bond funds also hit a 12-month 
low of 6.3 percent.  (M1B is a measure of money that refers 
primarily to money that can be used in transactions.  M2 is 
a broader measure of money that includes M1B plus deposited 
money that cannot be readily used in transactions.) 
 
Lowest Unemployment in Three Years 
---------------------------------- 
 
8.  Despite the economic slowdown, Taiwan\'s unemployment 
rate in October 2004 declined to 4.3 percent, the lowest 
rate in three years and down from 5.3 percent in August 2002 
and the lowest rate in three years. 
 
Manufacturing Firms: Pessimistic 
------------------------------- 
 
9.  An October 2004 survey showed that only 13 percent of 
Taiwan businesses expect business performance to improve 
over the coming three months, down from over 33 percent in 
January and February 2004.

SUBJECT: TAIWAN REACTIONS TO CHINA/ASEAN FTA 
 
 
1.  Summary: Reactions in Taiwan to the announcement of a 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between China and the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ranged from dire 
predictions of imminent isolation to suggestions that the 
immediate impact on Taiwan\'s economy will be minimal.  Most 
analysts, business associations, and officials view the 
China/ASEAN FTA primarily as a political move by China to 
increase its influence in Asia and isolate Taiwan.  Although 
the economic impact may be minimal in the near term, there is 
a shared concern that the agreement represents a trend 
towards regional integration that is excluding Taiwan and 
could eventually lead to the economic marginalization of the 
island.  End Summary. 
 
2.  Taiwan government officials had varying responses to the 
China/ASEAN FTA.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) 
spokesman Michel Lu accused China and ASEAN of seeking to 
exclude Taiwan from trade in east Asia and promised that MOFA 
would try to find a way to participate in the proposed East 
Asian Summit in 2005.  But Chieh Wen-chi, MOFA\'s Deputy 
Director of International Organizations cautioned that the 
agreement should be carefully studied to determine whether it 
would exclude Taiwan from the ASEAN market before drawing any 
conclusions.  Chieh noted that all FTAs must comply with WTO 
requirements and that Taiwan\'s chief exports already benefit 
from low tariffs globally. 
 
3.  Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh announced 
December 13 that MOEA was studying the impact on Taiwan of 
the China/ASEAN FTA and recommended Taiwan companies minimize 
the impact of the agreement by promoting industrial upgrading 
and globalization.  She suggested that absent FTAs with 
regional trading partners, Taiwan would need to focus its 
efforts on protecting its access to the ASEAN market through 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework.  Deputy 
Minister Steve Chen claimed the China/ASEAN FTA would have 
little effect on Taiwan\'s economy in the near term, but 
warned that Taiwan would face ever stiffer competition in 
ASEAN once the FTA is actually in place, a process that could 
take years.  Chen also noted that Taiwan investors already in 
China or ASEAN countries would benefit from improved access 
to the markets of the other FTA members. 
 
4.  Economic analysts minimized the immediate economic impact 
on Taiwan, noting that China\'s motivation for participation 
in the FTA appeared to be mostly political.  According to 
Taiwan Institute for Economic Research (TIER) Vice President 
David Hong, the China/ASEAN FTA will have a small negative 
impact on Taiwan\'s economy in the near term.  Hong predicted 
2005 GDP growth could be slowed by .05% as a result of the 
agreement.  Labor intensive production in Taiwan would 
suffer, while exports of capital intensive products and 
natural resources could see a small benefit.  Hong added that 
the FTA would increase the pressure for Taiwan to negotiate 
bilateral agreements and improve competitiveness to counter 
the perception that Taiwan was being isolated in Asia. 
 
5.  Academia Sinica Director of American and European Studies 
Lin Cheng-yi sees China focusing on closer relations with 
ASEAN to combat perceived US dominance of the region.  He 
noted that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao made ten concrete 
recommendations on steps to improve China/ASEAN ties at the 
recent APEC Summit, including making 2006 a year of 
China/ASEAN cooperation, promoting inter-ministerial 
dialogue, backing an East Asian Summit to be held in 
Malaysia, and creating an East Asian Trade Area with a 
prominent role for ASEAN.  Although Taiwan investment in 
ASEAN countries is greater than Chinese investment in the 
region, trade between China and ASEAN, almost US$100 billion 
per year and growing rapidly, is about three times 
Taiwan/ASEAN trade.  This rapid growth in trade flows has 
given China greater influence in the region when compared to 
Taiwan.  Lin also pointed out that Taiwan has not placed much 
emphasis on improving economic ties with Southeast Asia, 
instead focusing on improving relations with Japan and the 
US.  This emphasis will make it difficult for Taiwan to 
counter China\'s growing economic influence in Southeast Asia 
and make it more imperative for Taiwan to build stronger 
trade ties to Japan and the US. 
 
6.  Vice Chairman Tsai Hong-ming, of the Chinese National 
Federation of Industries (CNFI), one of Taiwan\'s leading 
industrial associations, believes most business people fear 
the economic marginalization of Taiwan industry.  But he also 
noted that Taiwan does not compete directly with Chinese or 
ASEAN products in most markets.  Most products traded between 
ASEAN and China will not directly affect Taiwan\'s 
competitiveness, according to Tsai.  Taiwan producers of more 
labor intensive goods may face stiffer competition, but many 
of these have already shifted production to China or ASEAN 
countries and will actually benefit from the FTA. 
 
7.  Tsai suggests that the real concern for Taiwan should be 
on the potential loss of competitiveness resulting from lack 
of regional integration and the growing cross-Strait 
imbalance of trade.  Taiwan\'s ability to attract investment 
may suffer from the perception that Taiwan is disadvantaged 
in regional trade.  However, he also noted that the ASEAN 
countries will have many reservations in the actual 
implementation of the FTA and that the actual effects on 
regional trade are likely to be delayed. 
 
8.  Comment: Most observers in Taiwan are concerned about the 
potential for marginalization of Taiwan\'s economy in the 
region.  The China/ASEAN FTA is a potent symbol of a trend 
towards regional economic integration that is excluding 
Taiwan.  But in the near term, the effect of this FTA on 
Taiwan\'s economy appears to be small.  Taiwan economic 
officials continue to believe Taiwan\'s economic development 
is best served by creating an environment friendly to 
investment and development of value-added production.  But 
they also are concerned that Taiwan\'s competitiveness will 
suffer if it continues to be excluded from regional economic 
arrangements.  End Summary.

\"China\'s Interpretation of [the Outcome] of Taiwan\'s 
Legislative Elections Is Completely Wrong\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" said in an 
editorial (12/16): 
 
\". In short, the outcome of last Saturday\'s legislative 
elections has, only for the time being, marked an end 
to the rapid expansion of Pan-Green power over the past 
few years. . The key point of last Saturday\'s 
legislative elections was a confrontation between the 
powers of different political parties rather than a 
race [related to] the ideals and directions of these 
parties.  It is, without doubt, not a public vote on 
Taiwan\'s national status or the argument concerning 
unification or independence.  China\'s misinterpretation 
of the outcome of the legislative elections, a natural 
result of its ideological prejudices, has fully 
demonstrated that Beijing has no idea of what democracy 
or Taiwan\'s mainstream public opinion is.  In forming 
its Taiwan policy based on such false knowledge, China 
will surely strengthen its confrontational attitude, 
suppression, containment and isolation [of Taiwan]. 
There is definitely no possibility for the two sides to 
engage in a dialogue or reconciliation.  As a result, 
the answer to the question regarding who is the biggest 
source of turmoil in the Asia-Pacific region 
jeopardizing its stability and prosperity is already 
self-evident.\"

COOPERATION, GOVERNMENT RESTRICTION 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Cross-Strait telecommunications thrive with over 50 
million direct dial calls placed across the Strait every 
month that account for 35 percent of Taiwan\'s outgoing 
international calls.  Many Taiwan telecom firms have 
partnered with PRC counterparts to provide special 
cross-Strait services aimed at Taiwan businesses with 
investment in the Mainland.  However, Taiwan prohibits 
investment in the PRC telecom sector.  Many firms have 
concerns about the investment environment in the Mainland, 
but some are looking into future investment opportunities. 
The Taiwan government should move out of the way and allow 
cross-Strait telecommunications commerce to grow.  End 
summary. 
 
Industry Thriving 
----------------- 
 
2. (U) Cross-Strait telecommunications is a thriving 
industry.  Over 50 million telephone calls totaling more than 
190 million minutes were placed across the Taiwan Strait in 
September.  Calls to Mainland China accounted for 35 percent 
of Taiwan\'s outgoing international direct dial calls in 
number of calls and 44 percent in total minutes.  China has 
been the number one destination for international calls from 
Taiwan since 1995.  Furthermore, these figures only take into 
account traditional fixed-line and mobile phone telephone 
calls.  Voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) calls, which 
offer cost and privacy advantages, are not counted.  China is 
also the largest source of roaming charge revenue for 
Taiwan\'s mobile phone service providers. 
 
3. (U) Phone calls across the Strait are easy to place and 
fairly inexpensive.  Charges for a direct dial call to the 
Mainland are as low as USD 0.10 per minute.  Fierce 
competition has pushed prices down substantially in recent 
years and continues to benefit consumers.  As with 
international direct dial calls and mobile phone calls in 
other parts of the world, connecting charges for calls placed 
across the Strait are processed through international 
clearinghouses.  Officially, Taiwan and the PRC have not yet 
implemented direct cross-Strait telecommunications.  All of 
this traffic takes place under the fiction that because the 
calls traverse submarine cables that are owned by 
international consortia or are transmitted by satellites, the 
connections are indirect. 
 
Commercial Partnerships Expanding 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) After international direct dial service to the PRC was 
established in 1989, the majority of cross-Strait calls was 
to family members.  In recent years, Taiwan\'s massive 
investment in the PRC and the sizable community of Taiwan 
businessmen who live in the Mainland to oversee these 
investments have driven most of the demand for cross-Strait 
telecommunications.  Targeting these business customers, 
several Taiwan telecom firms have entered agreements with PRC 
firms to provide various cross-Strait telecom services. 
Under these agreements, the PRC and Taiwan firm each provide 
half of the circuit for specialized telecom services such as 
international private leased circuit (IPLC), internet 
protocol virtual private network (IPVPN), and 
video-conferencing.  The firms offer one-stop shopping for 
billing and service.  So for example, a Taiwan firm with a 
factory in the PRC and headquarters in Taiwan might request 
service from a Taiwan telecom firm, have equipment installed 
and maintained in both Taiwan and the Mainland, and then 
receive a single bill from the Taiwan telecom provider. 
 
5. (U) Major Taiwan fixed-line service providers, such as 
state-owned Chunghwa Telecom (CHT) and private Taiwan Fixed 
Network (TFN), have partnered with multiple PRC firms to 
offer these services.  CHT\'s Mainland partners include China 
Telecom, China Netcom, China Unicom, and China Mobile.  In 
addition, some Taiwan telecom firms that lack their own 
circuit facilities but lease the circuits of other firms also 
offer similar services.  Chief Telecom, a firm that focuses 
on international data services, offers cross-Strait data 
transmission using the networks of firms like CHT and TFN. 
Data transmission applications include many of the same 
services offered by fixed-line service providers such as IPLC 
and video-conferencing. 
 
Investment Prohibited 
--------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) While China has become the primary destination for 
investment among Taiwan\'s manufacturing firms, Taiwan telecom 
industry investment in the PRC is virtually non-existent. 
The Taiwan government prohibits any investment that falls 
under the category of telecommunications but is in the 
process of reviewing the prohibition for possible 
liberalization.  Other factors also limit interest in 
Mainland investment among Taiwan telecommunications firms. 
Many firms are concerned about the investment environment in 
the Mainland.  Taiwan Telecommunication Industry Development 
Association Chief of Public Affairs Rachel Liu told AIT/T 
that excessive restrictions and lack of regulatory 
transparency discourage telecommunications investment in the 
PRC.   In addition, as CHT Vice President of the 
International Business Group T.F. Leng explained, CHT is 
prohibited as a state-owned enterprise from investing 
anywhere overseas.  On the other hand, Charles Hsiung, Senior 
Vice President at Chief Telecom told us that his firm is 
looking into investing in an international data center in the 
PRC after such investment is legalized in the PRC under WTO 
accession commitments in 2005.  TFN Executive Vice President 
Feng Chian also indicated that TFN is looking into PRC 
telecommunications licensing regulations to see how they can 
expand Mainland operations. 
 
Comment - Taiwan Government Standing in the Way 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (SBU) In some key industries such as semiconductors and 
flat-panel displays, Taiwan prohibitions are the only things 
holding back investment in the Mainland.  PRC regulations and 
its investment environment are also contributing factors in 
the telecommunications sector.  However, if liberalization in 
the Mainland continues to outpaces liberalization in Taiwan, 
the Taiwan government alone will shoulder the blame for 
limiting the opportunities available to Taiwan 
telecommunications businesses.  In some ways, this is already 
the case.  Philby Lee Chen Executive Vice President of Far 
EasTone, a Taiwan cellular phone company, complained to AIT/T 
about Taiwan government regulations that prohibit open 
solicitation on behalf of PRC firms.  Aiming at Taiwan 
travelers to the Mainland, Far EasTone would like to sell SIM 
cards and calling cards for PRC firm networks at its own 
stores in Taiwan.  Under current regulations, this is not 
allowed.  This is exactly the kind of counterproductive 
restriction that does not protect Taiwan\'s security, public 
health or businesses and needs to be eliminated to keep 
Taiwan competitive.  End comment.

Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The KMT\'s stronger than expected performance 
in the LY election will bring more uncertainty to the party\'s 
leadership question.  While KMT Secretary General Lin 
Fong-cheng told local media on December 12 that Lien Chan 
would step down as party Chairman at the end of his term next 
July, there are some still in the KMT that would rather keep 
Lien than make a choice between Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and 
LY President Wang Jin-pyng.  While both Ma and Wang have 
expressed interest in the job, neither has been willing to 
challenge Lien explicitly.  Both PFP Chairman James Soong\'s 
role in the Pan-Blue alliance, and plans to merge the KMT and 
PFP now appear even more tenuous.  KMT reformers fear that 
the KMT\'s LY electoral victory might prove counter-productive 
and actually undercut the prospects for longterm reform and 
leadership change.  End Summary. 
 
Will he go or will he stay? 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Following the Pan-Blue alliance winning a 114-seat 
majority in the December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) election 
and the KMT performing better than expected, the KMT must 
once again turn its attention to the twin challenges of 
leadership change and its relationship to the People First 
Party (PFP).  KMT Secretary General Lin Fong-cheng told local 
media on December 12 that Lien Chan will resign as the party 
Chairman at the end of his term in July 2005.  (Note:  A 
Chairman may serve for two terms.  Lien is currently serving 
out his first term and therefore is qualified to stand for 
reelection.  End note)  Lien himself has been more ambiguous 
about his plans.  In a press conference on election night, 
Lien merely repeated his earlier statement that the KMT would 
handle this question according to its Charter.  LY President 
Wang Jin-pyng told the AIT Acting Director on December 16 
that it was his judgement Lien will resign around August 
2005.  (Note:  According to the KMT Charter, the Party holds 
an election for Chairman every four years, three months (i.e. 
in April) prior to its (biannual) Party Congress meeting -- 
next in July 2005.    Wang told AIT that the Chairman 
election might be delayed until May or June.  End note) 
 
Deja Vu? 
-------- 
 
3. (C) After the March 2004 presidential election, many KMT 
officials told AIT that to avoid a divisive internal struggle 
between supporters for Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and LY 
President Wang Jin-pyng, Lien had to stay.  Some KMT 
legislators argued at that time that given the choice between 
splitting the party and keeping Lien, the latter was the 
lesser evil.  Others even said that Lien was the only person 
who could unify the KMT (Refs A, B, C).  Eight months later, 
however, on the eve of the LY election, most KMT officials, 
including some close to Lien, were telling AIT that Lien had 
to go.  Former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su 
Chi, for example, told the AIT Deputy Director on December 9 
that after losing the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections 
and running a poor LY election campaign, Lien should resign. 
Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu told the AIT Deputy Director 
that he would urge Lien to step down (Ref D).  Veteran KMT 
Legislator Shyu Jong-shyong went one step further, telling 
AIT that once the LY election was over, he will focus his 
energy on removing Lien.  The urgency behind the effort to 
dump Lien may have faded now that the KMT has survived the 
election with its LY majority intact. 
 
Ma and Wang on Deck? 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) As difficult as it is to determine if and when Lien 
will resign, it is just as difficult to assess who his 
successor would be.  All political observers agree that there 
are only two real choices -- Ma or Wang.  Over the last nine 
months, both men have indicated that they are candidates for 
the Chairmanship -- Wang in his usual oblique statements and 
Ma more deftly through his subordinates.  Both have gone out 
of their way not to appear to be directly challenging Lien. 
KMT officials repeatedly told AIT that KMT culture does not 
allow subordinates to challenge leaders and that this value 
is strongly imbued in both Ma and Wang.  Perhaps nothing 
epitomizes the situation more clearly than when Wang 
Jin-pyng, with a straight face, told the AIT Acting Director 
on December 16 that no one has yet expressed an interest in 
being Chairman. 
 
5. (C) Ma and Wang\'s respective popularities have ebbed and 
risen over time.  In the immediate aftermath of March 20, KMT 
insiders favored Ma.  Then as the party quarreled internally 
over the KMT role in the PFP-led street demonstrations 
protesting Chen\'s election, and Ma came under attack from 
James Soong and PFP for not being more supportive of the 
demonstrations, support shifted away from Ma to Wang. 
However, as the LY election campaigns got underway, Ma, with 
his telegenic popular appeal, began again to outshine Wang. 
KMT Legislator Hung Chao-nan from Taichung City told AIT that 
legislators across Taiwan invited Ma to stump for them.  Hung 
said that Wang had not been nearly as popular on the campaign 
trial.  Publicly however, few have been willing to commit to 
either man.  KMT Legislators Alex Tsai and Apollo Chen 
typified this wait-and-see attitude among KMT members when 
each recently told AIT, \"I am staying neutral.\" 
 
6. (C) Differences between Ma and Wang have been repeated ad 
nauseam -- Ma is a Northerner, a Mainlander, and a media star 
who cut his political teeth as an administrator/executive. 
Wang is a Southerner, ethnic Taiwanese, backroom 
wheeler-dealer, and a master of the legislative process. 
Their strengths and weaknesses are equally well known.  Party 
members criticize Ma for being indecisive and lacking the 
stomach for rough and dirty politics.  KMT elder Hsu Li-teh 
told AIT Deputy Director on December 7 that even Ma\'s own 
father acknowledged his son lacked leadership skills and was 
nothing more than a technocrat.  Ethnic Taiwanese KMT members 
(bentupai) have told AIT it is unlikely that a Mainlander 
could be elected President and that KMT bentupai would insist 
the next Chairman be Taiwanese. 
 
7. (C) Despite Ma\'s reported shortcomings, many KMT insiders 
feel Wang\'s feet of clay are even worse.  KMT Legislator Hung 
Chao-nan told AIT that Wang is the very symbol of \"black 
gold\" (money) politics and has little appeal among the 
electorate.  While acknowledging that so far no one has 
produced any evidence about Wang\'s rumored \"legal problems,\" 
Su Chi explained that many in the KMT fear that if they 
supported Wang for Chairman and later President, at the 
eleventh hour, the DPP might expose a scandal destroying Wang 
and the KMT along with him.  Ironically, this would replicate 
the KMT\'s eleventh hour tarring of James Soong in 2000 for 
being Lee Teng-hui\'s bagman.  Moreover, Su added, \"Wang is a 
poor public orator who puts people asleep as quickly as Lien 
Chan does.\" 
 
Procedural Gremlins 
------------------- 
 
8. (C) Another complicating factor is the mechanism by which 
the next Chairman will be selected.  In 2001 the KMT revised 
the Party Charter to allow for direct election of the 
Chairman.  Despite these \"democratic\" reforms, Su Chi told 
AIT that it is quite possible that Party elites might still 
be able to control the decision and impose their choice on 
the rest of the Party.  If this were the case, Su said, Wang 
would be at a great advantage because he excels in backroom 
deals.  However, if the decision were left to the Party 
Congress of some 800 members, Su expected Ma would be the 
choice.  And yet, Su mused, if the rules were interpreted to 
allow every \"card-holding\" KMT member to vote, Wang would 
know how to manipulate the balloting to his favor. 
 
You Can\'t Go Home Again 
----------------------- 
 
9. (C) Another unresolved question is whether there is a 
place in the KMT for James Soong, who has publicly made it 
clear he is unwilling to be relegated to \"Number Two.\" 
During LY campaign, Soong went into high gear and appeared to 
be plotting his return.  Longtime Soong confidant Daniel 
Hwang (Yih-jiau) told AIT on November 15 that Lien and Soong 
had worked out a secret agreement in which the two parties 
would merge in February 2005, Lien would remain chairman, and 
Soong would be appointed to a newly created position of 
Deputy Chairman.  As part of the pact, Ma would be the 2008 
presidential nominee with the understanding that Soong would 
be appointed Premier in a Ma Presidency.  Hwang said that 
Wang does not have a role in this new arrangement because 
Lien and Soong decided that Wang lacked charisma. 
 
10. (C) However, as relations between the PFP and KMT 
continued to sour during the course of the LY campaign, the 
alleged secret agreement apparently fell by the wayside.  The 
terms of the secret agreement clearly illustrate that the 
primary dilemma for Lien in his push for merger is finding an 
appropriate role for Soong in a reconstituted KMT-PFP.  PFP 
elder and former Taipei City Council Speaker Luo Bin told AIT 
on December 8 that the greatest stumbling block to a merger 
was James Soong himself.  A KMT official told AIT that there 
had been no progress in merger talks before the election 
because Soong was dissatisfied with becoming just one more 
KMT vice chairman.  The KMT official pointed out that if the 
KMT had offered Soong the Chairmanship, \"he would be back 
quicker than greased lightning.\" 
11. (C) The day after the PFP\'s poor showing in the December 
11 LY race, Soong ruled out the possibility of a merger.  On 
December 13, he publicly blamed the KMT for his party\'s poor 
election showing, bitterly lamenting that many outstanding 
PFP candidates did not win because the KMT had withdrawn its 
support for them.  Soong also criticized Wang Jin-pyng for 
not being more supportive of PFP causes in the LY and 
suggested that the PFP might not support Wang\'s bid for LY 
presidency in the next session.  PFP Legislator Sun Ta-chien 
told AIT on December 13 that \"too many conflicts happened in 
this campaign,\" and the KMT was \"not our friend and did 
everything it could to push us out.\"  Even if the KMT and PFP 
were to merge, he added, he would not cooperate with the KMT. 
 
 
Comment: A Bad Ending 
--------------------- 
 
12. (C) The surprise outcome of December 11 election has not 
eased the internal tension that existed within either in the 
KMT or the Pan-Blue prior to the election.  In many ways the 
KMT\'s stronger than expected showing has complicated matters. 
 Lien\'s advisors are urging him to stay on as Chairman.  The 
ongoing divide between Ma and Wang will enhance the 
likelihood that Lien can remain as Chairman if he so chooses. 
 As the KMT\'s James Chen pointed out, keeping Lien Chan as 
Chairman serves the important purpose of keeping the party 
together.  The choice between Ma Ying-jeou and Wang Jin-pyng 
is actually symbolic of deep splits within the KMT between 
the Mainlander and the Bentu wings.  While Ma clearly has 
greater popular appeal, the KMT\'s LY electoral success will 
give Wang a boost in the upcoming leadership battle.  The 
PFP\'s poor performance will put enormous pressures on James 
Soong.  Already a volatile personality in the best of times, 
Soong might well make statements in the days ahead that will 
aggravate the KMT\'s problems.  The issue of leadership 
transition is crucial for the KMT and its viability as a 
political force.  After 2004 presidential election, several 
KMT reformists told AIT that they secretly wished their Party 
could suffer more small defeats so that the Old Guard would 
leave the scene and allow them to commence the much needed 
internal reforms.  Paradoxically, from that viewpoint, the 
KMT\'s December 11 \"victory\" might have been the worst thing 
that could have happened.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: CHINA\'S \"ANTI-SECESSION\" LAW 
 
A) \"Beijing Elevates the Level [of Its Countering 
Taiwan Independence Moves] and Do It to Show to the 
United States\" 
 
Journalist Yu Hui-chen said in the centrist, pro-status 
quo \"China Times\" (12/18): 
 
\". Sources said actually China is not afraid of using 
force against `Taiwan independence,\' but China is 
afraid to fight with the United States.  Beijing\'s move 
to legislate the `anti-secession law\' is to elevate the 
level of its countering Taiwan independence moves and 
strategically speaking, to define China\'s `bottom line\' 
in the U.S.-China negotiations.  [Beijing\'s purpose is 
that] once a war breaks out across the Taiwan Strait 
due to Taiwan\'s provocative actions, the United States 
would have nothing to say [about the war.] 
 
\"It could be a decision out of more important concerns 
for China to choose to propose the `anti-secession law\' 
after Taiwan\'s legislative elections and to `show it to 
the United States.\'  Sources said many Chinese 
government agencies and personnel involved in Taiwan 
affairs consider that the biggest reason for the Pan- 
Blue alliance to win the legislative elections is 
because the United States had openly expressed its 
attitude not to support Taiwan independence, and, thus, 
influenced the voters in Taiwan. 
 
\"Beijing believes that in the current stage, the most 
effective way to oppress Taiwan independence is have 
the United States constrain Taiwan.  As a matter of 
fact, China is rather proactive on the strategy of 
`collaborative management\' of the situation in the 
Taiwan Strait with the United States. . 
 
\"Based on strategic considerations, Beijing is 
unwilling to see the `fantasy\' held by the outside 
world, thinking that the situation in the Taiwan Strait 
is mitigating after the Pan-Blue alliance won a victory 
in the legislative elections.  However, it will be 
difficult for China to articulate the bottom line of 
`One China\' when it wants to further negotiate with the 
united States in terms of the Taiwan issue since 
Beijing cannot even clearly define `rhetorical Taiwan 
independence,\' `de-jure Taiwan independence,\' and `de- 
facto Taiwan independence.\'  The timely proposal of the 
`anti-secession law\' not only represents that China\'s 
struggle with Taiwan independence, headed by Hu Jintao 
as the leader of the fourth generation, will enter a 
new level, but also signifies an important tool that 
will be used in the future U.S.-China negotiations on 
Taiwan issue.\" 
 
B) \"No More Room for Strategic Ambiguity across the 
Taiwan Strait\" 
 
Journalist Wang Ming-yi said in the centrist, pro- 
status quo \"China Times\" (12/18): 
 
\". At the present stage, the two great rivals that 
[Chinese President] Hu Jintao faces when dealing with 
the Taiwan issue are: the re-elected Bush 
administration and Taiwan\'s minority administration 
headed by President Chen Shui-bian.  As already hinted 
in the `May 17 statement\' issued by Beijing, in which 
China said it `does not fear or believe in ghosts and 
evil practices,\' the `U.S. ghost\' and the `evil 
practices of Taiwan independence\' are the two barriers 
confronting Beijing when it deals with the Taiwan 
issue.  Beijing\'s plan to `work with the United States 
in fighting against Taiwan independence\' - namely, it 
informed Washington in advance saying that its proposed 
anti-secession law is consistent with its one China 
principle - is a move to prevent Washington from 
turning into a factor that will interfere with China\'s 
anti-Taiwan independence policy.\" 
 
C) \"China\'s Proposed `Anti-Secession Law\' Is Not Only 
an Attempt to Intimidate Taiwan But Also a Public 
Challenge to the United States; Both [Taiwan\'s] Ruling 
and Opposition Parties Should Join Hands to Address the 
Move\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Taiwan Daily\" said in an 
editorial (12/20): 
 
\". No matter whether it is called the `National 
Reunification Law\' or the `Anti-Secession Law,\' the 
proposed bill has exposed the ridiculous mindset of the 
Chinese government in treating Taiwan as a `special 
administrative region under the PRC.\'  Beijing\'s 
attempt is both intimidation against and an insult to 
Taiwan\'s dignity and its sovereignty that is shared by 
all Taiwan people.  [Our] government should closely 
monitor any follow-up moves by Beijing and raise a 
solemn protest to the international community [about 
Beijing\'s attempt]. .\" 
 
D) \"Ultimatum - Or Just More Propaganda from Mainland?\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" editorialized (12/19): 
 
\". But there is surely another aspect to the proposed 
[anti-secession] law involving the United States, which 
Beijing views as the key stumbling block to gaining 
possession of Taiwan despite the overwhelming 
opposition to reunification under Beijing\'s terms among 
the people of Taiwan. 
 
\"Ever since the Taiwan Relations Act was passed by the 
U.S. Congress in 1979 to provide a basis for 
`unofficial\' substantive relations with Taipei, Beijing 
has complained about alleged U.S. `interference\' in the 
PRC\'s `internal affairs.\' 
 
\"Passage of a so-called `anti-secession\' law by 
Beijing\'s rubber-stamp parliament would give [Chinese 
President] Hu the rhetorical tool he needs to counter 
the Taiwan Relations Act, which American government 
officials unceasingly cite as the basis for their 
continued support of our government and people. 
 
\"As long as this proposed legislation remains just as a 
rhetorical tool or a `bone\' to throw to some hard- 
liners that remain a vocal minority within the ranks of 
the Chinese Communist Party, we will not need to worry 
too much about the law\'s potential impact on cross- 
strait relations. 
 
\"But we will need to pay close attention to the wording 
of the bill, and not just to gauge whether Hu is really 
in charge.  If the law is worded so strictly as to 
mandate military action at the slightest provocation, 
we should prepare our armed forces and public to deal 
with the possibility of military action against us. 
 
\"Even though we believe such action would be likely to 
end in defeat for the communist forces on the 
battlefield, an outbreak of military conflict in the 
Taiwan Strait would have horrific consequences for our 
security, as well as regional stability and the entire 
world\'s economy. .\" 
 
E) \"China\'s Dangerous Leap Backwards\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
commented in an editorial (12/20): 
 
\". The new [anti-secession] law might have the benefit 
of waking the US up to how it has let itself be 
hopelessly manipulated by Beijing for the last year or 
so into putting pressure on Taiwan and working against 
its better, strategic interests. 
 
\"But the important message that has to be understood in 
Washington and broadcast to Beijing is that the new law 
will be a disaster for any kind of cross-strait 
dialogue.  Taiwan has been willing to talk for a long 
time.  It simply wants to do so without preposterous 
preconditions which nobody could possibly find 
acceptable. 
 
\"This leaves the ball in Beijing\'s court to soften its 
stance and allow talks to take place.  Actually Beijing 
needs an internal debate about how best to woo Taiwan. 
But all the regime understands is pressure.  It thinks 
pressure works and it is about to go some way toward 
criminalizing the suggestion that pressure should be 
abandoned.  This is a great and dangerous leap 
backwards.\"

SUBJECT: TAIWAN\'S IMPENDING HEALTH CARE CRISES 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: The Taiwan Health care system is facing a 
number of crises.  The National Health Insurance system is 
teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.  The Department of 
Health faces low morale, an inflexible and conservative 
bureaucracy, a shortage of strong leadership, and an exodus 
of the few good leaders it does have, including the Minister 
of Health and the CEO of the Bureau of National Health 
Insurance (BNHI).  While the public is slowly becoming more 
aware of fiscal threats to the health care system, the 
political will necessary to push through reforms is 
non-existent.  The fiscal crisis at BNHI could be delayed by 
an infusion of government support, but the lack of political 
will to raise premiums and shortage of leadership at DOH 
portend a difficult period ahead.  End Summary. 
 
Health Finances Shaky 
===================== 
 
2.  (U) Taiwan\'s Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) 
faces a severe fiscal crisis in the coming weeks.  According 
to experts, at current premium levels it is estimated that 
BNHI will run an average deficit of almost NT$23 billion 
(US$675 million) every year for the next five years.  The 
BNHI reserve fund, designed to cover short term fiscal gaps, 
reportedly will be exhausted by the end of 2004.  The NHI 
premium income (not the premium rate) increases by only four 
percent per year, while expenses are increasing by six 
percent each year.  In the months before legislative 
elections, no party was willing to consider the need for NHI 
premium and co-pay increases.  The Legislative Yuan is 
scheduled to consider the BNHI budget December 23.  Premier 
Yu has publicly stated that there will be no increase in the 
NHI premium rate during his tenure.  However, there is 
speculation that he will be replaced when the new legislature 
is seated in February. 
 
3.  (SBU) Beginning in 2002, BNHI and the Department of 
Health tried to address the fiscal shortfall by instituting 
in phases a \"global budgeting\" system.  Under this system, 
hospitals are authorized a fixed amount of financial support 
by BNHI based on their quality of service and number of 
patients seen during a representative period (previous 1-3 
months).  This was supposed to increase hospital efficiency 
and help BNHI stay afloat.  But global budgeting has not been 
able to stem the flow of cash from BNHI and has led to 
protests from doctors at small and medium sized clinics that 
they are being squeezed out of existence.  Big hospitals also 
complain that they are losing money at an unsustainable rate. 
 
 
4.  (U) Recently published figures from central Taiwan 
hospitals show that total NHI claims by these hospitals from 
July to September 2004 exceeded the global budget allocation 
by almost 16 percent or NT$2.1 billion (US$64 million). 
Local press reports that losses in the first three quarters 
of 2004 at one large hospital were over NT$340 million (over 
US$10 million).  Another medical center in central Taiwan 
reported losing NT$100 million (over US$3 million) in the 
third quarter.  Hospital administrators report CT and MRI 
scans have decreased by 20 percent since 2003, presumably in 
an effort to cut costs.  Hospital purchase orders have been 
canceled and expansion plans put on hold.  The press reported 
in July that some hospitals were turning patients away for 
financial reasons.  DOH later confirmed these reports to AIT 
but insisted that the hospitals involved had been reprimanded 
and the situation would not be repeated.  Pharmaceutical 
companies report a drastic decline in sales volume since July 
as hospitals restrict access to more costly drugs or switch 
to cheaper generic products.  This has increased the already 
heavy pressure on research pharmaceutical companies to cut 
prices.  The hospitals then use the difference between the 
actual and BNHI reimbursement price (the \"black hole\") to 
fund other operations. 
 
Government Response Lacking Urgency 
=================================== 
 
5.  (U) The government, while acknowledging the problems, has 
not yet taken steps to address them.  Instead, it is 
encouraging patients to change their health care habits by 
utilizing community clinics and general practitioners for 
their primary care needs, freeing hospitals to concentrate on 
more serious needs.  However, BNHI is not reimbursing these 
clinics at a level commensurate with their costs.  According 
to the head of the Taiwan Community Hospitals Association, 
while small clinics account for 80 percent of all medical 
organizations in Taiwan, they receive only 20 percent of BNHI 
reimbursements.  Small hospitals and clinics are currently 
being reimbursed by BNHI at an average rate of less than 50 
percent, far below their larger counterparts.  One hospital 
administrator from Taidong reported to AIT that his hospital 
had been reimbursed at only 17 percent of claims from July to 
September 2004. 
 
Rolls-Royce Service at a Yugo Price 
=================================== 
 
6.  (U) The fiscal problems of the National Health Insurance 
are exacerbated by the inability of the Department of Health 
to push forward solutions that would be politically 
unpopular.  According to BNHI, Taiwan currently spends only 
six percent of GDP on health care, less than most OECD 
countries (according to OECD statistics, the US spends about 
12 percent of GDP on health care costs).  Yet the level of 
service covered by NHI is high, including not just doctor 
visits but also tests, surgery, and pharmaceuticals for the 
price of a small co-payment.  Anecdotal reports suggest that 
many Taiwan migrs maintain their Taiwan citizenship 
specifically so they can return to take advantage of the 
health care benefits in their old age.  The solution to the 
fiscal crisis must include some increase in premium and or 
co-payments and a revision of the global budget system to 
include some stop loss mechanism for health care providers. 
The problem is not that Taiwan is spending too much on health 
care, rather that patients are paying too little. 
 
Fleeing a Sinking Ship? 
======================= 
 
7.  (U) The Department of Health is facing a leadership 
vacuum.  Minister of Health Chen Chien-jen was appointed 
during the SARS crisis in 2003, and while a popular and 
capable administrator, has not pushed for urgently needed 
policy reforms in pricing, validation, and data protection 
for innovative pharmaceuticals.  Chen has announced he plans 
to return to Taiwan University after the upcoming Legislative 
Yuan elections.  Although he recently has been relatively 
outspoken about NHI\'s precarious fiscal position, his lame 
duck status makes it difficult for Chen to do more than use 
the bully pulpit of his office to warn of the impending 
crisis.  He has announced plans to convene public meetings to 
discuss the future of NHI.  Chen\'s replacement will be the 
fourth Minister of Health in four years. 
 
8.  (SBU) The recent resignation of Deputy Minister of Health 
and CEO of BNHI Chang Hong-jen is another blow to a ministry 
that can ill-afford to lose capable administrators.  Chang 
led BNHI for almost 4 years and gained a reputation as the 
\"Teflon administrator\" for cutting BNHI\'s administrative 
costs to just 2 percent of operating expenses and for forcing 
through price hikes in premiums and co-payments in 2002.  His 
resignation in October, in response to protests by more than 
1000 doctors and small hospital administrators over the 
implementation of global budgeting, surprised most observers. 
 Chang told AIT November 22 he had been seeking to step down 
for several months in order to allow a new CEO to take the 
reins at BNHI.  After repeated urging by the Minister of 
Health and President Chen he agreed to temporarily take on 
the additional role of deputy Minister of Health in June 
2004.  However, he was growing increasingly concerned that he 
would not be allowed to leave and took the protests as his 
opportunity to step down to pursue a fellowship at a U.S. 
university.  Chang\'s colleagues suggest he stepped down in 
order to better position himself for a more senior role later. 
 
9.  (SBU) The Director of the Bureau of Pharmaceutical 
Affairs (BOPA) Wang Hui-po also submitted her resignation in 
August, but she agreed to stay on until a replacement can be 
found.  Wang told AIT she \"could no longer in good conscience 
remain in (her) position when the leadership of DOH was more 
concerned with finances and protecting international 
companies than with the welfare of the Taiwan public.\"  She 
cited in particular the pressure from foreign pharmaceutical 
companies for changes in Taiwan\'s validation procedures and 
establishment of data exclusivity provisions.  However, DOH 
has been unable to find a successor and Wang is still in 
place.  Her future status is uncertain.  Wang has not been 
helpful to efforts to bring Taiwan into compliance with WTO 
commitments on pharmaceutical data protection and has been a 
major obstacle in efforts to simplify pharmaceutical 
manufacturing validation procedures.  However, the medical 
device industry credits her for quickly resolving their 
concerns about re-registration of imports.  The position of 
BOPA Deputy has been unfilled for several months. 
 
Comment: Doctor\'s Don\'t Make Great Managers 
=========================================== 
 
10.  (U) Many DOH bureaucrats are reportedly drawn from the 
ranks of medical doctors.  Their expertise is in medical 
practices and procedures, not management, and they are often 
unwilling to listen to differences of opinion or explain 
decisions.  The result is a particularly inflexible 
bureaucracy that issues edicts with little consultation or 
explanation and is then forced to reluctantly backtrack when 
crises spiral out of control.  The initial mishandling of the 
SARS crisis in 2003 led to some improvements in the 
Ministry\'s procedures and readiness to control pandemic 
disease, but the rapid spread of the disease at the beginning 
stages was a direct result of DOH\'s bureaucratic inability to 
coordinate a sound response.  Irrational medical device 
registration requirements, announced at the end of 2003 and 
then modified after pressure from industry and the US 
government, is another example of the DOH announcing a policy 
change without sufficient consultation or forethought.  The 
2002 announcement of serious changes in regulations for 
pharmaceutical registration, done without consultation with 
industry, and the subsequent difficulties in reaching an 
acceptable agreement on registration and inspection 
requirements is yet another example. 
 
11.  (U) The regular turnover of Ministers, the resignation 
of those officials who have demonstrated some leadership, and 
the inflexibility of the DOH bureaucracy have combined to 
make the DOH unwilling or unable to address many of the 
serious shortcomings of Taiwan\'s public health care system 
and make working with DOH a challenge.  Long hours, low 
wages, heavy workloads, recurring health crises, and 
political pressures affect the staff morale and make it 
difficult to recruit and retain capable professionals. 
 
12.  (SBU) Taiwan\'s impending health insurance crisis has 
been obvious to health care administrators for some time. 
DOH raised the issue in 2003 but met a brick wall in the LY. 
Given the increasingly sour post-election partisan 
environment, chances for the LY to agree on future needed 
premium hikes are low.  Efforts to implement global budgeting 
are acknowledged by former BNHI CEO Chang Hong-jen as a 
stop-gap cost-cutting measure that could only really be 
effective if Taiwan\'s health care costs had already 
stabilized.  Global budgeting may have bought BNHI a few 
months, but is not a solution.  A government bailout could 
prevent BNHI\'s fiscal collapse in the short term, but the 
structural shortcomings of the health care system will 
remain.  With the departure of Minister Chen and CEO/Deputy 
Minister Chang, the DOH and BNHI lack the leadership 
necessary to lead the push for solutions and the inflexible 
culture and low morale of the DOH will make reforms even more 
difficult.  Chang agreed that the bankruptcy and closure of 
several hospitals may be necessary before there is political 
will to address the root causes of this crisis.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: CHINA\'S \"ANTI-SECESSION\" LAW 
 
A) \"China Legislates the `Anti-Secession Law\' and [It] Has 
Nothing to Do With Taiwan\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" editorialized (12/21): 
 
\". Taiwan and China are respective countries on each side of 
the Taiwan Strait, and the interactions between Taiwan and 
China are being conducted in accordance with international 
law.  The so-called `anti-secession law\' has nothing to do 
with Taiwan.  From the point of `Republic of China,\' the one 
that actually conducted the secession was the `People\'s 
Republic of China\' established in 1949, but not the 
`Republic of China\' established in 1912.  However, `Taiwan\' 
has nothing to do with the `People\'s Republic of China\' 
established in 1949.  According to international law, as a 
matter of fact, Taiwan still belonged to Japanese territory 
before the 1952 San Francisco Peace Treaty became effective. 
The Republic of China was established in 1949 and Taiwan, 
thus, has never been a part of the `People\'s Republic of 
China.\' 
 
\"Hence, even if China legislates the `anti-secession law,\' 
it can only apply to the domain within the People\'s Republic 
of China and has nothing to do with Taiwan..\" 
 
B) \"Suspending the Issue of Unification: [Chinese president] 
Hu Expects the Powers in Taiwan to Maintain the Status Quo.\" 
 
Chen Yu-chun, a research fellow and Director of American 
Studies at Chinese Cultural University noted in the 
conservative, pro-unification \"United Daily News\" (12/21): 
 
\". The moves that Beijing declares to push for the anti- 
secession law and Beijing\'s declaration, after Taiwan\'s 
legislative elections, regarding `the key to develop the 
Cross-Strait relations depends on the position Taiwan adopts 
in the future\' are intertwined.  The purpose is that 
maintaining the status quo is the priority in cross-Strait 
relations in the foreseeable future.  Moreover, the anti- 
secession law does not involve the issue of national 
unification, therefore [Chinese President] Hu did not 
mention in his speech in Macao the issue of anti-secession 
law as was expected by the outside world..\" 
 
C) \"The Wording by the United States on the `anti-secession 
law\'\" 
 
Journalist Norman Fu noted in the centrist, pro-status quo 
\"China Times\" (12/21): 
 
\". The English translation for the law China is about to 
legislate is `anti-session law\'.  From the history [of the 
Civil War in the United States,] the purpose [of China] is 
to point directly at the United States.  To maintain the 
integrity of the territory and sovereignty, the United 
States did not hesitate to wage war that left more than 
600,000 deaths.  Therefore, isn\'t it another version of the 
Civil War if China does not hesitate to resort to arms to 
resist Taiwan independence?  The reason China used the word 
`secession\' is to remind the United States of the Civil War. 
The acts of secession and treason were not allowed by the 
United States, and how can China, whose people have a deep- 
rooted thinking of unification be different?.\"

SUBJECT: SPECIAL DEFENSE BUDGET PROSPECTS IN DOUBT 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Early passage of the USG 18 billion Special 
Budget for defense procurement appears increasingly unlikely 
as the Pan-Blue continues to block the bill from getting on 
the legislative agenda.  Taiwan MND officials are now turning 
to the USG for assistance in overcoming Pan-Blue resistance. 
LY President and KMT Vice Chairman Wang Jin-pyng told AIT 
that the KMT would work with the DPP on the Budget in 
exchange for Chen Shui-bian\'s cooperation on the March 19 
Truth Investigation Committee.  On the other hand, he said, 
it would be difficult for the PFP to reverse completely its 
LY election platform of opposing the Special Budget.  Despite 
Taiwan MND and NSC assurances that they would continue to 
lobby the Pan-Blue, prospects for early action on the Budget 
appear dim as the post LY election promises of bi-partisan 
cooperation fade into memory.  End Summary. 
 
MND Asking for USG Help 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) Action on the Special Budget for the USG 18 billion 
advanced weapons procurement package appears unlikely as the 
Pan-Blue continues to block the bill from getting on the 
legislative agenda of the current lame duck Legislative Yuan 
(LY) session.  Ministry of National Defense (MND) Strategic 
Planning Division (SPD) Director Admiral Kao Kuang-chi asked 
AIT/USG on December 17 to intervene with the Pan-Blue ahead 
of the December 21 LY Procedure Committee.  Kao said it would 
be helpful if AIT and the USG reached out to those close to 
KMT Chairman Lien Chan to emphasize to the Pan-Blue that 
Washington views the special budget as a barometer for 
Taiwan\'s commitment to defend itself. 
 
3. (C) The Pan-Blue controlled Procedure Committee had 
already failed once again on December 14 to act on the 
authorization portion of Special Budget bill and every other 
DPP Government-sponsored legislation.  The December 14 
meeting was the first time the LY Procedure Committee had met 
since the late November LY recess for members to campaign for 
the December 11 LY election.  Committee approval was not 
expected, however, given the lack of inter-party consultation 
prior to the meeting.  LY President Wang Jin-pyng announced 
publicly on December 13 that LY approval of the Special 
Budget was still a possibility but it would require an 
inter-party consensus.  If no consensus could be reached, he 
said, he would recommend the Executive Yuan resubmit the 
package in the Spring LY session that begins in February 2005. 
 
KMT Quid Pro Quo 
---------------- 
 
4. (C) LY President Wang Jin-pyng told the AIT Acting 
Director on December 16 that he had agreed to a request from 
MND Vice Minister Admiral Lei Kuang-shuh to convene 
cross-party consultations on December 20 aimed at forging a 
consensus on the authorization bill.  However, he 
acknowledged that the current LY dynamics made it difficult 
to envision action during the current lame duck session 
expected to end on January 17.  KMT Chairman Lien Chan, he 
explained, wanted to be helpful, but with the condition that 
the KMT would insist on trading its cooperation on the 
Special Budget to win DPP concessions.  For his part, Wang 
asked the USG to pressure Chen Shui-bian to cooperate with 
the March 19 Truth Investigation Committee (which had some of 
its powers stuck down by the Council of Grand Justices on 
December 15) and to agree to other March 20 election-related 
concessions (Septel).  In response, the AIT Acting Director 
explained to Wang that it is extremely unlikely that the USG 
would get involved in Taiwan\'s internal politics. 
 
PFP\'s Opposition Platform 
------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Wang offered even less reason for optimism that the 
People First Party (PFP) would support the Special Budget 
during the current session.  Wang told the AIT Acting 
Director that because the PFP had campaigned during the LY 
election on an anti-Special Budget platform, \"some time would 
have to pass before the PFP could reverse its opposition to 
the Special Budget.\"  PFP LY Caucasus Leader Liu Wen-hsiung\'s 
office told AIT that opposition to the Special Budget is led 
by PFP Chairman James Soong, as well as Legislators Lin 
Yu-fang and Nelson Ku (Chung-lien).  Kevin Lo, Liu\'s senior 
legislative aide, said that Lin continues to tell his PFP 
colleagues that the cost of the eight diesel submarines is 
\"above the international market rate.\"  Lo also said Ku 
opposes the entire weapons package on principle, claiming 
Taiwan does not need the weapons.  Lo added that at this 
point only AIT intervention with Soong could reverse the 
PFP\'s stance. 
 
6. (C) Taiwan National Security Council (NSC) officials told 
AIT that PFP Legislator Lin Yu-fang had informed the NSC that 
he personally was prepared to take action on the Budget 
during the current session but that Soong was intent on 
preventing any action until after February 2005.  The NSC 
officials told AIT that they believe Soong is trying to use 
the Special Budget as a bargaining chip with Wang Jin-pyng 
and the KMT to leverage his party\'s role in the majority 
opposition alliance.  However, Soong has departed Taiwan for 
a month-long vacation in the United States.  NSC officials 
told AIT they hope to take advantage of Soong\'s absence to 
persuade Wang to bring the PFP LY members around to the 
Government\'s position. 
 
Comment:  Casualty of Taiwan\'s Internal Politics 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7. (C) Taiwan NSC officials tell AIT that they are in active 
consultations with Wang Jin-pyng and Opposition members of 
the LY Defense Committee to press for action on the Special 
Budget in the lame duck session.  However, the Budget appears 
to be falling victim to the contentious relationship among 
all of Taiwan\'s political parties.  Until recently, the KMT 
merely wanted the MND to trim the price tag of the weapon 
systems, especially the eight submarines.  Now the KMT has 
raised the ante by linking the Special Budget to the March 19 
Truth Investigation Committee.  During the LY election, the 
PFP opposed the Special Budget for electoral advantage.  The 
PFP now finds itself unable to reverse its position, and 
continues to use its opposition as a bargaining chip with the 
KMT.  With the December 11 calls for bi-partisan cooperation 
already fading into distant memory, early passage of the 
Special Budget appears increasing unlikely.

majority in the Legislative Yuan (LY), will be allowed to 
continue working, the ruling strips it of most of its powers. 
 The Executive Yuan (EY) praised the ruling, saying it 
vindicated government agencies\' refusal to cooperate with the 
commission\'s investigation.  The KMT\'s initial reaction was 
hostile, but it quickly moderated its tone and began to 
discuss possible modifications in the statute creating the 
Commission.  The People First Party (PFP), however, derided 
the decision, claiming it was the result of Pan-Green 
manipulation of the judiciary, and threatened a \"radical 
approach\" to dealing with the situation.  It remains to be 
seen whether the ruling will encourage the two sides to work 
together to create a mutually acceptable investigative 
commission.  End Summary. 
 
The \"Truth Investigation Commission\": A Most Partisan Birth 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2. (C) The Pan Blue-dominated LY passed a statute on August 
24 establishing a special \"Truth Investigation Commission\" 
(TIC) to investigate the March 19 shooting of President Chen 
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.  Many in the 
Pan-Blue camp claim the shooting was staged to help Chen 
garner sympathy votes and thus unfairly win the election. 
The statute gave the commission nearly unlimited powers of 
investigation and stipulated that its members be appointed by 
the political parties in proportion to their share of LY 
seats.  The Pan-Green camp, calling the bill 
unconstitutional, fought it from the outset.  The 
DPP-dominated EY effectively vetoed the TIC bill in September 
by returning it to the LY for reconsideration.  After 
Pan-Green legislators failed to prevent the Pan-Blue LY 
majority from overturning this \"veto,\" they petitioned the 
Council of Grand Justices to strike down the law as 
unconstitutional.  Meanwhile, the Pan-Greens refused to 
nominate members to the Commission, and the EY directed 
government agencies not to turn over documents or otherwise 
cooperate with the TIC investigation. 
 
Commission\'s Omnipotence Ruled Unconstitutional 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (C) The Council of Grand Justices, Taiwan\'s highest 
judicial body, ruled on December 15 that some key portions of 
the TIC statute were unconstitutional, notably two articles 
giving the Commission unprecedented prosecutorial and 
investigative powers.  One article stipulated that no 
individual or government body could invoke any law exempting 
itself from being subpoenaed to give testimony, handing over 
documents, or otherwise assisting the Commission.  Travel 
bans and fines would be imposed on those who refused to 
cooperate.  The other article further authorized the 
Commission to try any alleged suspects before a high court 
and demand a retrial if the court\'s decision was found to 
contradict the Commission\'s findings.  The Justices ruled 
that the TIC can continue working, but only after the statute 
has been amended, eliminating most of its enforcement powers. 
 
 
Pan-Green Camp, EY Praise the Ruling 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Pan-Green officials praised the ruling, saying it 
vindicated government agencies\' refusal to cooperate with the 
commission\'s investigation.  EY spokesman Chen Chi-mai said 
he was \"grateful for the constitutional interpretation 
delivered by the Council of Grand Justices\" and demanded the 
Commission \"immediately cease all operations.\"  He added that 
\"both President Chen and the Executive Yuan are eager to find 
the truth of the March 19 case . . . . but the procedures 
must be constitutional and legal.\"  He suggested that 
lawmakers of all parties consider forming commissions under 
the scope of the LY\'s existing constitutional powers to 
investigate other \"cases of concern to the Taiwan people\" in 
addition to the March 19 shooting.  Chen specifically 
mentioned several notoriously unsolved murders of dissidents 
during the KMT-imposed period of martial law. 
 
KMT Reluctantly Willing to Abide by Ruling 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) The KMT\'s reaction to the ruling was initially 
combative.  Commission member Yeh Yao-peng stated that the 
commission was \"legally constituted\" and would continue 
operation.  KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung also expressed his 
immediate disappointment with the ruling, saying that the 
party \"cannot accept the (Grand Justices\') interpretation.\" 
By the next day, however, the KMT had begun to moderate its 
position.  On December 16, LY Speaker Wang Jin-pyng announced 
that the Party would respect the ruling and would work with 
all parties to amend the statute so that the Commission could 
continue its investigation.  Privately, however, the KMT has 
made it clear that it remains dissatisfied with the Council\'s 
decision.  In a meeting with AIT Acting Director the same day 
(septel), Wang complained that the ruling effectively 
eliminated the Commission.  Party Chairman Lien Chan, he 
said, had asked him to pass a message that the KMT would give 
up its objections to the USD 18 billion special defense 
procurement budget if AIT could convince the Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) to accept the existing TIC statute. 
 
A Defiant PFP Threatens \"Radical Approach\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The KMT\'s Pan-Blue partner PFP, however, was more 
defiant.  On December 15, after the ruling was announced, PFP 
caucus whip Liu Wen-hsiung questioned the impartiality of the 
Grand Council itself, saying \"We are not surprised about the 
outcome, since the Commission is investigating Mr. Chen 
Shui-bian and the Grand Justices are named by Chen.\"  He 
called on the Commission to continue its operations and urged 
\"the public to refuse cooperation with the Grand Justices\' 
interpretation.\"  In response to the KMT\'s more moderate 
stance the following day, Liu threatened that the PFP had not 
ruled out a more \"radical approach\" to dealing with the 
situation, but did not elaborate what that might entail. 
Members of the commission separately issued a statement 
saying that the ruling contradicted the five-branch 
government system of the ROC Constitution, and may have 
sparked a constitutional crisis.  PFP Legislator Chou Shi-wei 
suggested a constitutional amendment to eliminate the Control 
Yuan (CY), since its duties overlap with those of the 
Commission. 
 
Comment:  No Big Surprise 
------------------------- 
 
7. (C) The Council\'s ruling was not surprising, as parts of 
the original statute were widely viewed as contravening the 
Constitution.  The real question was whether the statute 
would be struck down before or after the December 11 LY 
elections.  The KMT\'s professed willingness to respect the 
ruling and consult with all parties suggests that, now that 
the elections are over, Commission legislation acceptable to 
all sides may now be possible.  However, the reactions by EY 
Spokesman Chen, Lien Chan, and the PFP provide clear 
reminders that the TIC is as much political football as 
investigative body.  All parties will continue to look for 
ways to exploit the March 19 shooting and the Commission to 
gain marginal advantage in Taiwan\'s highly acrimonious and 
evenly divided domestic political arena.

SUBJECT: 15 New Southern Taiwan Legislators - An 
Introduction 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Thirty-three incumbents and 15 new 
legislators were elected from Southern Taiwan 
districts in the December 11 Legislative Yuan (LY) 
election.  Twelve of the 15 new LY members have 
advanced degrees, including three PhD\'s and nine 
Master\'s degrees.  Overall, the new LY members from 
the South, spread across parties, are more educated 
and slightly younger (average age 47) than those they 
replaced.  Virtually all are either well-connected to 
\"national\"-level political figures or are long-time 
political operatives at the local level. 
 
2.  (SBU) Background on the new Southern Taiwan LY 
members: 
 
Kaohsiung City 
-------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) District One (Northern Kaohsiung) -- Two 
incumbents were re-elected:  Lin Jin-sing (DPP) and 
Luo Shih-hsiung (KMT).  And, four newcomers were 
elected: 
 
-- Lee Kun-tze (DPP) - Born in 1964, Lee has a 
Master\'s Degree in Political Science from National 
Cheng Chi University.  Prior to running for the LY, 
Lee served as a Kaohsiung City Councilman (he was one 
of only four DPP city councilors not involved in a 
major vote buying scandal in December 2002).  Lee is 
the nephew of Chen Chu, Chairwoman of Taiwan\'s Council 
of Labor.  According to a 2002 article in the 
Journalist Magazine, Chen Chu and Lee Kun-tze hail 
from Ilan originally and are seen as been members of 
the \"Ilan gang,\" a group of DPP officials that have 
ties to Premier Yu Shyi-kun and are associated with 
the New Tide faction in the DPP.  Lee also once served 
as an assistant to now-Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan, 
another member of the \"Ilan gang.\" 
 
-- Chang Hsien-yao  (PFP) - Born in 1963, Chang has a 
Ph.D. in Political Science from the Sorbonne.  A close 
advisor to PFP Chairman Soong Chu-yu, Chang is 
Director of the PFP\'s Policy Research Center.  Chang 
is also a Member of the Board of the Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF), and an Assistant Professor in the 
Graduate Department of Taipei\'s Chinese Culture 
University.  A resident of Taipei, Chang moved to 
Kaohsiung just prior to the LY election in order to 
run as the sole PFP candidate in Kaohsiung\'s Northern 
District, an area that is home to the Tsoying Naval 
Base, Taiwan\'s Marine Corps and a large population of 
retired military. 
 
-- Guan Bi-ling (DPP) -- Born in 1956, Guan has a 
Ph.D. in Political Science from National Taiwan 
University.  Guan was an AIT International Visitor 
program participant in 1996.  Prior to her run for the 
LY, she served as Director of the Kaohsiung City 
Cultural Bureau for two years and before that, as 
Spokesperson and Director of the Kaohsiung City 
Information Bureau.  Before moving to Kaohsiung in 
2000 to work for Mayor Frank Hsieh, Guan served as an 
Associate Professor of Public Administration at 
National Taipei University.  During Chen Shui-bien\'s 
1998 run for Taipei mayor, Guan served as an aide to 
his campaign.  Guan\'s husband is Hsu Yang-ming, who is 
the Vice Mayor of nearby Tainan City and previously 
served as Deputy Secretary General of the DPP when 
Frank Hsieh was Chairman.  Guan is considered a 
protg of Kaohsiung Mayor Hsieh and is affiliated 
with the Welfare Nation faction of the DPP, which 
Hsieh heads. 
 
-- Tseng Tsan-teng (TSU) - Born in 1953, Tseng has a 
Ph.D. in Education Administration from Northern 
Colorado State University.  Prior to running for the 
LY, Tseng served as Director of the Graduate School of 
Education Administration at National Tainan Teachers 
College.  In his first run for public office, Tseng 
received strong support from former President Lee 
e 
Teng-hui, with whom Tseng has long been associated. 
Tseng is even closer to Huang Kun-hui, who served as 
 
SIPDIS 
Secretary General of the Presidential Office under 
 
SIPDIS 
former President Lee Teng-hui.  Tseng served in the 
Taipei Education Bureau under Huang Kun-hui, who was 
Director of the Education Bureau in the late 
1970\'s/early 1980\'s when Lee Teng-hui was Taipei City 
Mayor.  During his LY campaign, Tseng led a small 
protest in front of AIT Kaohsiung\'s offices, 
protesting the failure of the U.S. to support changing 
the official name of Taiwan. 
 
4.  (SBU) District Two (Southern Kaohsiung) -- Three 
incumbents were reelected:  Kuo Wen-cheng (DPP), Chiu- 
yi (PFP) and Luo Chih-ming (TSU).  In addition, two 
newcomers were elected: 
 
-- Huang Chao-hui (DPP) - Born in 1946, Huang has a 
Master\'s degree from Tainan Theological College.  He 
has formerly served as the Chief Executive Officer of 
the Executive Yuan\'s Southern Taiwan Service Center 
(2002), Vice General Secretary of the DPP\'s Central 
Office from 1995-1997 and is a former Legislator 
(1992-1995).  Huang was an early \"tang-wai\" and DPP 
activist.  He served in the late 1980\'s as a member of 
Taiwan\'s National Assembly and during that period 
spent two year\'s in prison for participating in anti- 
KMT government political protests.  Huang\'s wife, Chen 
Ling-li, was just elected as a Kaohsiung City Council 
member in the supplemental election on July 17, but 
during Huang\'s LY campaign, he pledged that his wife 
would not run again for City Council, in order to 
respond to criticism that his family was trying to 
dominate local politics. 
 
-- Lee Fu-hsing (KMT) - Born in 1946, Lee has a 
Master\'s Degree in Education from Tokyo\'s Gakugei 
University.  A long-time Kaohsiung City Council 
member, first elected to the Council in 1990, Lee was 
one of only two KMT City Council members not 
implicated in the December 2002 vote buying scandal 
that led to the removal of many city councilors.  Lee 
ran for LY in 2001, but lost when the KMT split its 
vote in Kaohsiung\'s southern district among several 
candidates.  Lee was a participant in AIT\'s 
International Visitor program in 1995.  A devout 
Catholic, Lee was made a \"Knight of the Catholic 
Church\" by the Vatican in 1993. 
 
Kaohsiung County 
---------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Six incumbents were re-elected:  Lin Yi-shih 
(KMT), Lin Tai-hua (DPP), Chung Shao-ho (PFP), Hsu 
Chi-ming (DPP), Yu Cheng-dao (DPP), Chao Lian-yen 
(PFP).  In addition, three newcomers were elected: 
 
-- Chen Chi-yu (DPP) - Born in 1964, Chen has a 
Bachelor\'s Degree in Sociology from National Taiwan 
University.  He is a former Kaohsiung County Councilor 
(1994-2002).  Chen ran against current Kaohsiung 
County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing for the DPP\'s 
nomination in 2001, with the backing of then- 
Magistrate and former Interior Minister Yu Chen-hsien, 
but failed.  Chen maintains close ties to the \"Black 
faction\" in Kaohsiung County, a DPP faction that is 
dominated by the Yu family.  Chen was among the first 
student members of the DPP, joining in 1987 while 
attending National Taiwan University in Taipei.  Chen 
has been an active DPP campaigner, starting with work 
as an aide to current Tainan Magistrate Su in Su\'s 
1992 run for the LY. 
 
-- Yen Wen-chang (DPP) - Born in 1946, Yen is a high 
school graduate.  Yen is a long-time Kaohsiung County 
Councilor and seasoned local DPP campaigner.  He has 
also been a long-time proponent of the \"Taiwan 
identity\" movement, de-emphasizing Taiwan links to 
China in favor of promoting a separate Taiwan culture 
and language. 
 
-- Wu Kuang-shun (DPP) - Born in 1949, Wu has an MBA 
from private I-Shou University in Kaohsiung County. 
Wu previously served as a legislator from 1998-2001, 
but left the LY to run, unsuccessfully, as the KMT 
candidate for Kaohsiung County Magistrate in 2002. 
Wu\'s family has long been involved in local politics; 
his father served as Kaohsiung County Council Speaker 
for three consecutive terms, from 1982-1994.  Wu\'s 
family owns a securities firm in Kaohsiung County. 
 
Pingtung County 
--------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Three incumbents were re-elected:  Liao Wan- 
ju (KMT), Tsai Hao (IND), Cheng Chao-ming (DPP).  In 
addition, two newcomers were elected: 
 
-- Pan Meng-an (DPP) - Born in 1963, Peng has an MBA 
from Honolulu University (a long-distance degree 
program).   Prior to his run for LY, Pan served as 
Chairman of the DPP\'s Pingtung Office (2001-4) and 
concurrently as a member of Pingtung\'s County Council. 
 
-- Wu Chin-lin (KMT) - Born in 1947, Wu has a Master\'s 
Degree in Public Administration from National Chengchi 
University.  Wu currently serves as an Advisor to the 
Examination Yuan and is a former Secretary General of 
the Examination Yuan.  Wu is the younger brother of Wu 
Tze-yuan (KMT), a former Pingtung County Magistrate and 
LY member who was convicted of corruption and sentenced 
to a long prison term, but who fled and is currently 
one of Taiwan\'s most-wanted fugitives.  Wu\'s election 
with the highest number of votes in the County suggests 
his family retains significant political pull, despite 
his brother\'s difficulties. 
 
Tainan City 
----------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Five incumbents were re-elected:  Tang Pi-o 
(DPP), Wang Yi-ting (KMT), Lai Ching-te (DPP), Lin 
Nan-sheng (KMT), and Wang Hsing-nan (DPP).  In 
addition, one newcomer was elected: 
 
-- Kao Szu-po (PFP) - Born in 1968, Wang has an LL.M. 
from George Washington University Law School and is a 
member of the Taiwan Bar.  Prior to his run for office, 
he served as an Assistant Professor at the private Shih 
Hsin University in Tainan.  Despite running as a PFP 
candidate, Kao comes from a long-standing KMT family. 
His father is Kao Yu-jen (incumbent KMT at-large 
legislator and former Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial 
Assembly).  His wife, Jessica Chou, is a top aide to 
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, and his brother-in-law is 
Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lung (KMT). 
 
Tainan County 
------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Eight incumbents were re-elected:  Ho Shui- 
sheng (DPP), Cheng Kuo-chung (DPP), Lee Chuan-chiao 
(KMT), Li Chun-yi (DPP), Hung Yu-chin (KMT), Yeh I-chin 
(DPP), and Lee Ho-shun (an incumbent at-large KMT 
legislator who ran this time as an NPSU candidate).  In 
addition, one newcomer was elected: 
 
-- Huang Wei-che (DPP) - Born in 1963, Huang has a 
Master\'s Degree in Public Administration from Yale 
University.  Huang is a former National Assembly member 
(1996-2000), who chose to go to the U.S. for study 
after the NA was dissolved rather than run for an LY 
seat.  In 2002, Huang returned and ran successfully for 
the Tainan County Council, serving from 2002-04. 
 
Chiayi County 
------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Two incumbents were re-elected: Tsai Chi-fang 
(DPP), Chang Hua-kuan (DPP).  In addition, two 
newcomers were elected: 
 
-- Lin Kuo-chin (DPP) - Born in 1965, Lin is a high 
school graduate who has served on the Chiayi County 
Council since 1998.  While originally affiliated with 
Chiayi County\'s \"Lin faction,\" led by Chaiyi County\'s 
DPP Magistrate, Chen Ming-wen, Lin\'s affiliation with 
the faction is apparently not strong.  Lin was a one- 
time aide to Kaohsiung City LY member Kuo Wen-cheng 
when Kuo served as Kaohsiung City Councilman.  Local 
officials describe Lin, a former salesman, as an 
eloquent speaker. 
 
-- Weng Chung-chun (KMT) - Born in 1955, Weng has an 
MBA from National Taiwan University.  Until his run for 
LY, Weng served as KMT Chairman in Chiayi County (2001- 
2004).  Weng previously served as a legislator from 
1989-2001, but chose not to run for re-election and 
instead ran unsuccessfully for County Magistrate.  Weng 
was one of a number of officials indicted in the 
massive corruption scandal related to the Zanadau 
Commercial Development project in Kaohsiung County.  In 
February 2003, Weng was charged with corruption and 
faces a possible nine-year sentence for allegedly 
receiving NT$25 million in bribes from Su Hui-chen, the 
majority shareholder in the company, to help get the 
project license approved after the company had already 
been ruled ineligible.  The case, however, continues to 
wind its way very slowly through Taiwan\'s courts and 
appellate process. 
 
Chiayi City 
----------- 
 
10.  (SBU) Two incumbents re-elected: Huang Min-huei 
(KMT) and Tsai Tong-rong (DPP).  No newcomers. 
 
Taitung County 
-------------- 
 
11.  (SBU) One incumbent, Huang Chien-ting (KMT) was 
re-elected. 
 
Penghu County 
------------- 
 
12.  (SBU) One incumbent, Lin Pin-kun (IND), was re- 
elected.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: CHINA\'S \"ANTI-SECESSION\" LAW 
 
 
A) \"Both Sides Across the Taiwan Strait Should Not 
Miscalculate Each Other and [Two Sides Should ] 
Understand Correctly the Anti-Secession Law\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" said in an 
editorial (12/22): 
 
\".Law is a weapon, which is what China learned from 
interacting with the international community these 
years.  China proposes the `anti-secession law\' in 
order to not only balance the `Taiwan Relations Act\' on 
one hand, but deter the `public opinion of Taiwan 
independence\' on the other. 
 
\"From the call of enacting the `unification law\' to the 
evolution of the current `anti-secession law\', the path 
of the adjustment in China\'s policy toward Taiwan is 
clear.  The impact is that the allocation of resources 
afterwards will be changed accordingly.  From the angle 
of preparing to conduct a military struggle toward 
Taiwan, `unification\' and `sanctioning the 
independence\' are two types of war that differ greatly. 
The former inevitably needs to occupy Taiwan 
effectively, and the latter has a wider range of 
options and feasible approaches.  Moreover, the 
definition of secession and the use of force involved 
in the `anti-secession law\' will be used by the Chinese 
military as the political guidance to the build-up of 
forces and to prepare for war in the future. 
 
\"There have been disturbances in cross-Strait relations 
for the last five decades, however, the current 
political cleavage has never occurred before.  China 
will adopt the `anti-secession law\' against Taiwan due 
to the reason that Taiwan is moving toward 
independence.  However, the Pan-Blue alliance won the 
majority of seats in the legislative elections and does 
this explain that Taiwan\'s current situation is not 
entirely what China has imagined?  We expect China to 
be cautious on legislating the `anti-secession law,\' 
not to miscalculate or misjudge the direction of the 
public opinion in Taiwan.  After all, the biggest task 
for both sides across the Taiwan Strait is not to 
miscalculate each other.\" 
 
B) \"The United States Warns the Chen administration 
[about] what Cannot Be Touched\" 
 
Journalist Sun Yang-Ming said in the conservative, pro- 
unification \"United Daily News\" (12/22): 
 
\". There has been a change in the fundamental strategic 
thinking and the attitude in China\'s policy toward the 
Taiwan issue.  The change clearly tells the United 
States that China will use force against Taiwan when 
the development of the Taiwan issue reaches certain 
criteria, and China is thinking seriously about the war 
that may possibly break out. 
 
\"The change has transferred the argument over Taiwan\'s 
future and the problem of Taiwan independence to a 
burden on the United States.  Therefore, the United 
States has to suffer the possible consequences 
accompanied by the political changes in Taiwan.  The 
United States will inevitably warn the Chen 
administration about what cannot be touched, and the 
consequences it has to suffer once [what cannot be 
touched] are touched.\" 
 
C) \"Beijing\'s Anti-Secession Bill Will Further Alienate 
Taiwan\" 
 
The conservative, pro-Unification \"China Post\" said in 
an editorial (12/22): 
 
\". [But] the mainland leaders must understand that 
their plan to create a legal basis for taking harsh 
measures against Taiwan will have grave consequences. 
It will radicalize public opinion and prompt even 
greater popular support for the independence cause, 
making it more difficult for long-stalled bilateral 
relations to move forward. 
 
\"In the worst case scenario, an escalation of political 
and military tensions could lead the two sides to a 
mutually destructive conflict, an unfortunate outcome 
neither side would want to see. 
 
\"For the two sides to return to the negotiating table, 
the U.S. may have to play a more active role in 
bridging the gap between Taipei and Beijing exerting 
its diplomatic influence with the two parties. 
Washington has been reluctant to mediate in the 
longstanding cross-Strait dispute.  But Beijing\'s 
growing tendency to resort to military force should 
point to the need for the U.S. government to intervene 
more forcefully. .\"

Classified By: AIT DIRECTOR DOUGLAS PAAL, REASON: 1.4 (C) and (D) 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  Taiwan\'s Financial Supervisory Commission 
has been very active since it was established in July 2004 to 
encourage market liberalization and reform.  Although some 
foreign businesses have complained about difficulty in 
keeping up with the flurry of new regulations, the 
regulations are consistent with efforts to liberalize the 
financial sector.  The FSC emphasizes its status as an 
independent agency, but has close ties to the ruling party. 
End summary. 
 
FSC Objectives 
------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The stated FSC objectives are internationalization 
and deregulation of Taiwan financial sector, flexible 
regulations and strong enforcement, and maintaining Taiwan\'s 
financial stability.  Long range FSC goals include passage of 
new legislation including the Single Financial Services Act 
and the Securities and Exchange Act (both awaiting 
legislative action).  FSC Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng said the 
FSC fully supports President Chen\'s stated goal of reducing 
the number of financial holding companies in Taiwan from 14 
to seven within the coming two years.  FSC International 
Affairs Department Deputy Director General Andrea Lee told 
AIT that the FSC was disappointed that the recent auction of 
the Chung Hsing Bank had not attracted foreign bidders.  It 
remains a goal of the FSC to encourage foreign acquisition of 
Taiwan banks. 
 
Relations With Other Agencies 
------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) There was confusion in some press reports regarding 
the relationship of the FSC and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) 
as well as the FSC responsibility for financial policy 
making.  Some reports indicated that this responsibility 
shifted from the MOF to the FSC and back to the MOF.  The FSC 
was established in July 2004 as an independent regulatory 
agency outside of day-to-day direct executive branch control. 
 The FSC chairman and its nine commissioners are nominated by 
the Premier and appointed by the President for a fixed term 
of office.  While political affiliation is obviously a factor 
in their selection, they are prohibited from participating in 
political activities while in office.  The executive branch 
is still able to promote its financial policies through the 
MOF, which it controls directly.  AIT has explored this 
issued in some detail with both the Minister of Finance and 
the Chairman of the FSC and found them to be largely in 
agreement on this point. 
 
Political Connections 
------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) While FSC Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng likes to emphasize 
FSC independence, he had been personally closely associated 
with President Chen and the DPP government prior to his 
appointment as FSC Chairman.  He helped organize a Taiwan 
investment team to Europe in 2002 on behalf of the DPP 
government while he was Taiwan country head of the Credit 
Swiss First Boston (CSFB) and claims that subsequent pressure 
from China on CSFB led to his separation from the bank.  FSC 
Vice Chairman Lu Tung-ying and FSC Commissioner Lin Kun-pao 
both campaigned for President Chen prior to his March 2004 
re-election (also prior to the establishment of the FSC). 
However, Kong, Lu, and Lin are not DPP party members, but 
have solid financial backgrounds.  None of nine FSC 
commissioners is a member of any political party.  The FSC 
has not been a significant target of opposition party 
criticism.  The most politically sensitive issue it deals 
with is the Financial Reconstruction Fund (FRF) that 
facilitates the sale of troubled financial institutions.  The 
FSC has sought additional funding for the FRF, but it has 
been blocked by the opposition parties. 
 
FSC Chairs the Joint Standing Committee 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5.  (SBU) The FSC functions as a consolidated financial 
regulator over the banking, insurance, securities and futures 
industries.  Its nine commissioners represent the four 
bureaus (banking, insurance, securities and futures, and 
inspection) and five supporting departments (planning, 
international affairs, legal affairs, information management, 
and support) within the FSC.  Decisions are made by a 
majority vote of commissioners.  Taiwan officials believed a 
consolidated regulator was needed to respond to the challenge 
of regulating multi-faceted financial holding companies and 
the global trend of increasing cross-sector business among 
banking, insurance, and securities and futures.  The FSC 
enjoys quasi-judicial powers in that it can supervise, 
examine, conduct investigations, and impose fines or other 
penalties.  The FSC chairs the Joint Standing Committee 
(JSC), which also includes representatives of the MOF, 
Central Bank, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), Council for 
Economic Planning and Development, and other ministries on an 
ad hoc basis. 
 
6.  (C) In remarks to an Amcham meeting on December 15 
Chairman Kong noted that the JSC meets to discuss financial 
and monetary policies that may go beyond the responsibility 
of any single agency.  Kong mentioned privatization of 
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as an example.  Financial 
sector SOEs with government ownership above 50 percent come 
under the jurisdiction of the MOF.  However, the FSC can 
assist the privatization of those with less than 50 percent 
government ownership.  In both cases, the FSC is involved in 
arranging underwriting for the issuance of equity shares. 
Kong also mentioned that while the FSC has overall 
responsibility for securities trading, the Central Bank has 
authority over capital flows arising from trading in foreign 
securities and foreign portfolio investor trading in Taiwan. 
 
Cross-Strait FSC Issues 
---------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Currency exchange between China\'s Renminbi (RMB) and 
Taiwan\'s New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) is another issue requiring 
interagency coordination between the FSC, Central Bank, and 
MAC.  The FSC oversees banking operations, while the Central 
Bank is responsible for managing capital flows with foreign 
currencies, and MAC has authority over cross-Strait issues. 
A Central Bank official told AIT that in early August an 
interagency meeting attended by Taiwan National Security 
Council Secretary General Chiou I-jen, the Central Bank, FSC, 
and MAC discussed a pilot project for legal exchange between 
the NTD and RMB by banks on the Taiwan-controlled islands of 
Kinmen and Matsu.  However, according to our Central Bank 
contact, the proposal has been blocked by the MAC and is 
still sitting on the desk of the MAC Vice Chairman awaiting 
his approval.  During an early December trip to Kinmen, AIT 
found that banks there were still unable to change currency 
between RMB and NTD. 
 
Taiwan\'s Strengths 
----------------------- 
 
8.  (C) The FSC believes that Taiwan has potential as a 
regional fund raising and asset management center.  Chairman 
Kong noted that companies from Singapore and Hong Kong 
frequently come to Taiwan to raise capital.  He pointed out 
that Taiwan has a strong and globalized manufacturing base, 
huge capital surplus and low external debts, well-trained 
professionals, and a well-established financial system.  He 
also noted that the liquidity of Taiwan\'s stock market is 
third largest in the world, its market capitalization is 
first among emerging markets and third overall in Asia, and 
the volume of Taiwan\'s bond market is also third in Asia. 
 
New FSC Regulations 
--------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) Among new regulations, the FSC has abolished required 
earnings forecasts for listed companies.  The reason behind 
this move was to prevent abuse and stock price manipulation 
and to encourage portfolio investors to read and analyze 
company financial statements rather than depending only on 
earnings forecasts.  Just as Taiwan has too many banks, it 
also has too many insurance companies.  The FSC is 
encouraging them to merge into bigger, stronger insurance 
companies that can play a more significant role in the 
region.  The FSC is currently rating insurance companies on 
the quality of their management and financial standing and 
will publish the names of companies receiving penalties.  The 
FSC has restricted the use of credit cards for paying debt in 
order to get credit cards back on track as tools for 
consumption instead of debt repayment. 
 
Business Community Reaction 
------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) AIT has heard complaints from foreign financial 
firms about the difficulty of keeping up with the many new 
requirements imposed by the FSC.  Business people say they 
were confused about who spoke for the FSC in the context of 
contradictory statements from different FSC commissioners. 
To address these problems, the FSC appointed a spokesperson 
and made efforts to increase the transparency of its 
decision-making procedures.  Chairman Kong has delivered 
powerpoint presentations and answered questions at a number 
of gatherings of foreign businesspeople, including Amcham and 
the European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (ECCT).  During 
Chairman Kong\'s Amcham presentation, he answered wide-ranging 
questions for about 45 minutes.

SUBJECT: LENOVO/IBM DEAL MEANS BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR 
TAIWAN\'S IT INDUSTRY - FIERCE COMPETITION 
 
Classified By: Classified by AIT Director Douglas H. Paal, Reason 1.5 ( 
D) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) In the short term, Taiwan\'s information technology 
sector will not feel much impact from the Lenovo acquisition 
of IBM\'s PC division.  However, over time Lenovo\'s increased 
bargaining power will increase competition among Taiwan\'s 
contract PC manufacturers and component suppliers.  Some 
Taiwan suppliers may have difficulty working with Lenovo 
because of concerns about trade secrets and Lenovo\'s approach 
to business.  Taiwan\'s own PC brands are ready to compete for 
former IBM customers and are not ready to concede any ground 
in the PRC\'s domestic PC market.  End Summary. 
 
Short-Term Impact ) Business as Usual 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The main impact in Taiwan of Lenovo\'s acquisition of 
IBM\'s PC manufacturing division will be felt among the firms 
that manufacture PCs on contract and supply components to 
IBM, Lenovo and their competitors.  In the short term, most 
firms and analysts expect little change.  Lenovo has 
indicated that it will not change IBM or Lenovo suppliers in 
the near future.  This is consistent with industry experience 
after other mergers, such as the HP\'s takeover of Compaq. 
Lenovo\'s current contract PC manufacturers include Wistron 
Co., Quanta Computer Co., Compal Electronics and Mitac 
Technology Co.  Wistron and Quanta also supply IBM, as does 
Hon Hai Precision Inc.  Lenovo\'s major Taiwan component 
suppliers are Elitegroup Computer Systems Co., Micro-star 
International Co., and Giga-byte Technology Co.  In addition 
to Elitegroup and Giga-byte, IBM\'s major suppliers include 
Universal Scientific Industrial Co. 
 
Long-Term Impact ) Pressure on Suppliers 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) As Lenovo integrates the newly acquired IBM operations 
with its own, it is likely to reduce gradually the number of 
contract manufacturers and suppliers.  The effects of 
consolidation should start to appear in the second half of 
next year.  Component suppliers will face pressure to lower 
prices due to Lenovo\'s greater bargaining power.  Analysts 
expect Taiwan producers of motherboards to be particularly 
strongly affected.  According to media reports, some 
suppliers in Taiwan -- including Hon Hai Precision, Taiwan\'s 
biggest electronics company by sales, and Asustek Computer 
Inc., the world\'s biggest motherboard supplier -- are well 
positioned to increase orders.  Other firms such as Wistron, 
which have been key suppliers to IBM, are particularly 
vulnerable.  Wistron produces about half of IBM\'s laptops, 
and IBM sales account for 30 percent of Wistron\'s revenue. 
 
4. (C) However, Quanta\'s Deputy Group Spokesman, Jason Lin, 
told AIT/T that many Taiwan contract manufacturers and 
component suppliers are waiting to find out whether Lenovo\'s 
manufacturing strategy will focus on in-house manufacturing 
or outsourcing.  According to Lin, many Taiwan producers 
don\'t trust Lenovo.  He says that Lenovo has spread its 
contracts among many different firms and has made excessive 
demands to view manufacturing processes.  Some producers fear 
that Lenovo wants to steal trade secrets to improve its own 
manufacturing ability.  Jonathan Tsang, President of 
Asustek\'s Sales and Marketing Group, echoed Lin\'s concerns in 
a conversation with AIT/T econoff.  He emphasized that 
Asustek is very selective about the firms that it chooses to 
partner with, pointing out that it had turned down offers to 
supply components to Compaq and Nintendo.  He expressed 
respect for the way IBM does business and concern about 
Lenovo\'s approach, speculating that Asustek would have 
problems working with Lenovo. 
 
Long Term Impact ) Competition for Taiwan\'s Brands 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5. (SBU) Most analysts predict that while the Lenovo/IBM deal 
will strengthen Lenovo\'s position in China, it will lose some 
IBM customers throughout the world due to quality and service 
concerns.  As a result, Taiwan\'s own PC brands such as Acer, 
BenQ, and Asustek may lose market share in the domestic PRC 
market.  Nevertheless, Asustek\'s Tsang told AIT/T that his 
firm, which has the sixth highest market share in the PRC 
laptop computer market, still expects to double laptop sales 
in the Mainland in 2005 just as it doubled sales in 2004. 
 
6. (SBU) Taiwan firms are also ready to compete for IBM\'s 
former customers in other markets.  Acer in particular is 
well placed to increase sales in Europe and the United 
States.  In Taiwan\'s internal market, domestic brands stand 
to substantially expand market share.  HP Taiwan\'s Personal 
Systems Group General Manager Dennis Chen told AIT/T that in 
Taiwan\'s commercial PC market, Acer, which has the second 
highest market share, will move aggressively to pick up 
former customers of IBM, which has the third highest share. 
Asustek and Acer, numbers one and two in Taiwan laptop sales, 
stand to gain customers from number three IBM in that market. 
 But according to Chen, BenQ, a relative newcomer, is 
particularly well placed to make gains in the laptop market 
since a former IBM Taiwan General Manager joined the firm a 
few months ago. 
 
7. (U) Because IBM\'s main competitors internationally, 
especially HP and Dell, stand to gain market share, Taiwan 
suppliers to these firms stand to win as well.  Quanta, for 
example, could lose its sales to IBM, which account for about 
two to three percent of Quanta\'s laptop sales.  However, it 
may be a net winner if Dell and HP, which account for more 
than half of Quanta\'s sales, gain new customers. 
 
Opportunity for Taiwan? 
----------------------- 
 
8. (C) In the past few years, there has been much public 
discussion about the need for Taiwan\'s firms, which have 
clearly demonstrated their ability to compete internationally 
at manufacturing high-tech products, to increase earnings by 
developing their own brand names.  Asustek, BenQ and 
especially Acer have made progress in this area.  According 
to Quanta\'s Lin, IBM offered to sell its PC division to at 
least two Taiwan firms, but both turned IBM down.  Lin told 
AIT/T that even after cutting the price in half to about the 
same price Lenovo paid, the Taiwan firms were still not 
interested.  Analysis in Taiwan reflects skepticism in the 
U.S. that Lenovo will be able to overcome the challenges that 
stand in the way of a successful acquisition.  Taiwan firms 
passed on the chance to buy IBM\'s PC division and take 
advantage of the IBM brand, but the IBM/Lenovo deal may 
present an even better opportunity for Taiwan firms to 
enhance their own brand names.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
A) \"Armitage\'s `Landmine\' Remarks and U.S.-China-Taiwan 
Relations\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
editorialized (12/23): 
 
\". However, even though [Deputy Secretary of State 
Richard] Armitage\'s remarks seemed unfavorable to 
Taiwan, the U.S. policy [toward Taiwan] remains 
basically unchanged.  In the meantime, we also noticed 
that military, economic and trade cooperation between 
the United States and Taiwan are enhancing; Washington 
will assign a military officer to work at AIT; and many 
people are suggesting that both countries sign a free 
trade agreement. 
 
\"As a result, it is natural that Taiwan should not take 
Armitage\'s remarks too lightly, but neither should it 
be seized in fear all the time.  As a superpower in the 
world, the United States\' cross-Strait policy is stable 
and will not be changed all of a sudden. 
 
\"Given the prevailing neo-conservatism in the United 
States, all Taiwan has to do is to strengthen 
communication with the United States, constantly put 
itself in Washington\'s shoes, and not take any 
`unexpected\' action or be a `landmine.\'  In that case, 
chances will be slim for the United States to tilt 
toward Beijing.\" 
 
B) \"It Is Difficult to Understand Why the Pan-Blue Camp 
Is Making a Fuss about [Armitage\'s] `Landmine\' Remarks 
and thereby Belittling Taiwan\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Taiwan Daily\" commented in an 
editorial (12/23): 
 
\". But we must point out that the top priority for the 
re-elected Bush administration\'s global strategic 
layout is to build an anti-terrorism front.  Washington 
needs to seek Beijing\'s cooperation in its anti- 
terrorism campaign especially when it wants to contain 
the military expansion of North Korea.  As a result, it 
is a serious matter that deserves Taiwan\'s close 
attention as to whether such a development will lead to 
the United States making more concessions to China with 
regard to the Taiwan issue. 
 
\".We believe that the DPP government should make the 
best use of those relationships with our American 
friends in the private sector, which were built when 
former President Lee Teng-hui was in the office, 
especially the relations with those retired U.S. 
congressmen.  We should act proactively to seek their 
support and understanding for Taiwan.  More 
importantly, the Taiwan people should stand up and 
speak out their voices.  They should convey their 
collective will to the U.S. society through a 
comprehensive and in-depth publicity campaign. .\" 
 
C) \"No More Messing Around with [Taiwan\'s] Foreign 
Relations\" 
 
Journalist Lisa Hsu commented in the centrist, pro- 
status quo \"China Times\" (12/23): 
 
\". Taiwan and the United States do enjoy similar 
strategic alliance values, which will not be easily 
affected by changes in their bilateral relations.  But 
Washington, until now, still believes that President 
Chen has constantly abused the goodwill of the United 
States just in order to gain his personal political 
interests.  The United States does not want to be 
extorted by Taiwan without reason, and it is certainly 
not a good thing for Taiwan either from the diplomatic 
or national security perspectives.  Taiwan is making 
things difficult for its good friend, which without 
doubt, is putting itself into a more dangerous 
position. . 
 
\"Facing the increasingly severe and comprehensive 
diplomatic attacks launched by Beijing, does Taiwan 
have a great strategy plan to address the situation as 
a whole and make as many friends as possible [in the 
international community]?  In the face of the fact that 
Taiwan\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as its 
overseas missions have gradually lost its combat 
ability, our foreign policy makers should no longer 
mess around with Taiwan\'s foreign relations.  It is 
time for them to ponder on the next step that they 
should take when it comes to Taiwan\'s foreign relations 
- a major defensive front for the island.\" 
D) \"Consider KMT\'s `China Complex\'\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
said in an editorial (12/23): 
 
\"US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage said in 
an interview on Tuesday that a declaration of war in 
defense of Taiwan is a decision that can only be made 
by Congress.  All Armitage\'s remarks imply is that the 
US is a country in which the rule of law is practiced - 
really nothing new.  His remark about Taiwan being a 
landmine was more controversial.  What he likely meant 
is that the Taiwan issue is so thorny that it might 
lead to friction between the US and China, and could 
become explosive if not carefully handled.  This is 
hardly new either.  If this is not what he meant, 
hopefully he can clarify his meaning more fully to 
prevent a misunderstanding. 
 
\"The Chinese Nationalist Party\'s (KMT) immediate 
reaction to Armitage\'s remarks was to speak for the US 
by interpreting them as a warning that the US would be 
unlikely to commit forces in the event of war.  The 
KMT\'s behavior is incomprehensible; on the one hand, it 
says the US will not defend Taiwan, yet on the other, 
it blocked the military procurement budget that Taiwan 
needs to defend itself.  Such behavior indicates the 
KMT is deliberately retarding Taiwan\' military 
strength. . 
 
\"The worst-case scenario is that the KMT will succeed 
in unilaterally disarming Taiwan, so that when the 
massive Chinese military makes its move, the US will 
face a dilemma as to how to respond militarily.  If it 
mobilizes its forces, the cost is likely to be high; 
but if it doesn\'t, it will witness Taiwan being 
swallowed up by a totalitarian beast.  Is this what the 
US really wants? 
 
\"If it isn\'t, then the US, in formulating its policy to 
aid the defense of Taiwan, must also consider the KMT\'s 
`China complex,\' and avoid allowing it to be come a 
weak link in the defense of the Taiwan Strait. 
 
\"It is encouraging that military officers will now be 
posted at the American Institute in Taiwan, and that a 
security mechanism for the Taiwan Strait has been 
activated.  The US Congress should also amend the 
Taiwan Relations Act to make it more consistent with 
the spirit and condition of the times, and block any 
rash actions by China to annex Taiwan.\" 
 
E) \"U.S. Hesitates to Defend Taiwan\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" said in an editorial (12/23): 
 
\". Armitage\'s statement about Taiwan being a `land mine 
in Washington\'s relations with mainland China\' have 
dealt a further blow to the attempt to the `green camp\' 
to pursue Taiwanese independence. 
 
\"The U.S., apparently displeased by Chen\'s independence 
agenda, now considers his administration an obstacle to 
building stability in the East Asia area.  The U.S. may 
become so impatient with Taiwan as to withhold 
continued support, in which case the island\'s security 
will be at risk - a possibility that radical 
independence advocates have persistently chosen to 
ignore so far. 
 
\"But chances are that the ruling DPP, which has Taiwan 
independence enshrined in its party platform, will push 
on with its provocative agenda.  No wonder a lot of 
observers now believe that war in the Taiwan Strait is 
only a matter of time.\"

SUBJECT: TRAINING CUSTOMS TO TAKE OVER EXPORT MONITORING 
SYSTEM RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
 
1.  Summary: The Taiwan Intellectual Property Office (TIPO) 
announced in early 2004 their desire to abolish the Export 
Management System (EMS) and transfer those responsibilities 
to the Department of Customs in an effort to shift funds to 
more urgent intellectual property protection priorities. 
TIPO and Department of Customs held a training session for 
Taipei area Customs managers on December 15, 2004 in 
preparation for the assumption of EMS responsibilities by 
Taiwan Customs. Taiwan plans to shift EMS\'s USD 1 million 
annual budget to support expansion of the Integrated 
Enforcement Task Force (IETF) and a cybercrime unit. 
Industry\'s reaction to both the abolishment of the EMS and to 
the training was mixed, with Business Software Alliance (BSA) 
representatives generally pleased but Entertainment Software 
Association (ESA) representatives still concerned that Taiwan 
Customs lack the experience and determination to prevent 
export of counterfeit computer hardware.  End Summary. 
 
2.  Taiwan introduced the Export Monitoring System (EMS) in 
1992 under U.S. pressure in an effort to prevent export of 
counterfeit software and hardware.  The Institute for 
Information Industries (III) was tasked with establishing a 
Software Verification and Inspection Center (SVIC).  Firms 
register their products with SVIC, which then conducts 
inspections on exported goods in an attempt to identify 
counterfeit products.  Since 2001, SVIC has identified one 
case of a counterfeit product being exported.  Given the 
absence of cases over the past three years, TIPO believes 
that the EMS USD 1 million budget can be put to better use in 
the protection of intellectual property and has proposed 
terminating the EMS program. 
 
3.  According to the TIPO proposal, the EMS program 
responsibilities would be transferred to the Taiwan Customs 
office.  In order to prepare Customs to assume this 
additional responsibility, TIPO conducted training seminars 
for Customs managers in Kaohsiung, Taichung, and most 
recently at the Chiang Kai Shek Airport in Taoyuan in 
November and December.  The Taoyuan seminar was attended by 
approximately 20 senior level Customs managers, as well as 
representatives from industry associations and AIT.  TIPO 
Deputy Director General Jack Lu, SVIC\'s Pan Shih-ming, BSA\'s 
Gina Tsai, and Taiwan Customs Lin Ling-hui discussed the 
history of the EMS, methods of detecting counterfeit hardware 
and software, and procedures rightsholders can use to 
initiate inspections. 
 
4.  Following the presentations, participants went to the 
Taiwan Customs warehouse for a demonstration of Taiwan 
Customs new procedures for inspection of suspicious exports. 
Customs officials explained that exporting firms were 
classified into three categories.  Those companies with 
established track records of export activity are exempt from 
regular inspection of documents and commodities - this 
comprises eighty five percent of shippers.  Those with a less 
established track record are normally exempt from commodity 
inspection - these companies account for 10 percent of 
shippers.  Finally, those companies that are not established 
shippers or have a history of violations are required to 
undergo both document and commodity inspection - these 
companies comprise about 5 percent of shippers.  Taiwan 
Customs also employs a random check procedure that could 
target shipments from companies in any of these three 
categories. 
 
5.  Representatives from BSA and ESA had different opinions 
regarding the usefulness of the training.  BSA agrees that 
the EMS budget could be better spent to fund other 
intellectual property protection activities.  According to 
BSA, the changes in software manufacture and distribution 
since 1992 mean the EMS is no longer an effective mechanism 
for combating counterfeit software products.  Nevertheless, 
BSA remains concerned that Taiwan Customs does not have the 
experience nor the determination to provide an effective 
deterrent to export of counterfeit goods.  BSA is considering 
cooperating with the Motion Picture Association (MPA) to 
assign a representative from the industry associations to CKS 
Airport to encourage and assist Taiwan Customs to focus on 
counterfeit optical media exports.  ESA shares these 
concerns, and further does not believe Taiwan Customs 
officials have been trained well enough to assume EMS\'s 
duties, citing specifically the lack of operational level 
staff at the training session at CKS Airport.  ESA did not 
participate as a speaker in the training sessions in November 
and December.  ESA also believes transferring authority for 
inspection to Taiwan Customs may lead to less attention 
granted to entertainment software and hardware exports.  The 
Taiwan ESA representative told AIT that Taiwan Customs is 
reluctant to adopt technology currently used by SVIC to test 
the authenticity of counterfeit hardware. 
 
6.  Comment: Taiwan has been actively promoting the 
dissolution of the EMS, most recently at Trade and Investment 
Framework Agreement discussions with USTR in Washington 
November 29 and 30.  With only one case over the past three 
years, it appears the EMS, or at least its methodology, has 
outlived its usefulness.  Plans to use the EMS budget to 
support expansion of the IETF and cybercrime operations are 
encouraging.  But TIPO and Taiwan Customs need to do a better 
job of demonstrating to industry that continued concerns 
about counterfeit exports are not going to be ignored.  TIPO 
and Taiwan Customs have announced plans to hold larger 
training sessions for operational level Customs staff 
beginning in January.  Participation by ESA, BSA, MPA and 
other associations as trainers would be helpful in addressing 
some of the industry\'s legitimate concerns.  End comment.

1.  An article on the front page of the pro-

Headline:  \"U.S. Secret Envoy Met with President Chen

current U.S.-Taiwan relations have changed 
dramatically, a [Taiwan] high-ranking official revealed 
that the Bush Administration sent an `important envoy\' 
who has the authority to represent the U.S. government

that U.S.-Taiwan relations have not changed as rumors

was described as `very high-ranking,\' arrived in Taiwan 
a few days before the Christmas.  The schedule of the 
U.S. representative was completely confidential and he 
left Taiwan after carrying out his mission.  The 
government, as usual, does not make any explanation nor 
describe any detail regarding the envoy\'s personal 
background.  However, the official said `the more 
cautious and more confidential, the tighter and more 
stable the U.S.-Taiwan relations are,\' and the United 
States\' sending of the person with representative 
status simply explains everything. 
 
\"High-ranking communication channels between the United 
States and Taiwan so far have been good.  Even when 
United States officials openly commented on cross- 
Strait problems or on whether Taiwan is in fact 
sovereign and independent, the `second channel\' between 
the United States and Taiwan is still good.  U.S. 
special envoy James Moriarty,  National Security 
Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs, traveled 
back and forth between Washington and Taipei in order 
to avoid transmission by a third party which would 
cause distortion in the language. 
 
\"Sources said the United States felt that President 
Chen Shui-bian has done a good job since his May 20 re- 
election inauguration speech, the talk on the National 
Day, and the ten-point conclusions in the November 10 
National Security Council meeting. 
 
\"As some people in Taiwan worry about current U.S.- 
Taiwan relations, sources said the United States 
considered that `in the past\' there were 
misunderstandings on some issues, such as the 
referendum.  However, clarification is okay, and  there 
is no misunderstanding` for the time being\'.  The 
United States in the future will be more concerned 
about issues like Taiwan\'s `revising the constitution\' 
and will consistently pay attention to it in order to 
`feel safe\'.\"

SUBJECT: AIT URGES TAIWAN TO FOLLOW ICCAT AND OTHER FISHING 
RULES 
 
1. Summary.  On December 13 and 14, OES/OMC Deputy 
Director Stetson Tinkham urged Taiwan\'s Fisheries 
Agency and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to heed the 
International Commission for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) call for Taiwan to crack down 
on Taiwan fishing vessels found to be fishing in 
excess of their allotted bigeye tuna quotas in the 
Atlantic Ocean.  Tinkham noted that failure to do so 
could both erode gains Taiwan has made in 
participating in international fisheries 
organizations and U.S. support for such 
participation.  End Summary. 
 
Issues raised on sidelines of APEC Fisheries Talks 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. While the main purpose of Tinkham\'s trip was to 
discuss the handover of the APEC Fisheries Working 
Group Lead Shepherd responsibilities, Taiwan\'s side 
was so well prepared for the talks that time was left 
for other discussions.  Therefore, on behalf of AIT, 
Tinkham raised ICCAT issues both on the sidelines of 
his meetings with Fisheries Administrator Shieh Dah- 
wen on December 13 and with Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MOFA) Deputy Director General for the 
Department of North American Affairs Kelly Hsieh on 
December 14. 
 
Background 
----------- 
 
3.  At the November 2004 meeting of the International 
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), 
Chinese Taipei was \"identified\" as having diminished the 
effectiveness of ICCAT management measures.  In particular, 
Taiwan\'s fishing vessels were determined to have caught 
bigeye tunas in the Atlantic Ocean and then reported them as 
caught in the Pacific or Indian Oceans, a practice known as 
\"tuna laundering,\" or falsifying catch records.  If this 
situation is not corrected by next year\'s ICCAT meeting, 
Chinese Taipei risks loss of its cooperating party status in 
ICCAT and thus risks losing opportunities to fish for ICCAT- 
managed species. 
 
Talks with Fisheries Agency 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  Following very productive and efficient talks regarding 
the hand-off of APEC Fisheries Working Group Lead Shepherd 
responsibilities, Tinkham met with Fisheries Administrator 
Shieh Dah-wen.  Tinkham urged Shieh to do all that he can to 
meet Taiwan\'s obligations to reduce its catch of Atlantic 
bigeye tuna to make up for past overages in its ICCAT catch 
allocation in accordance with the agreement reached at the 
November ICCAT meeting in New Orleans.  Tinkham noted that a 
failure to do so could diminish Taiwan\'s ability to take 
full advantage of its role as APEC Fisheries Working Group 
Lead Shepherd.  He further noted the great progress both 
sides have accomplished in finding ways for Taiwan to fully 
participate in numerous regional fisheries organizations. 
He reiterated the statements made at the ICCAT meeting by 
OES Deputy Assistant Secretary David Balton that better 
compliance was critical in order to uphold the terms of the 
2002 AIT/TECRO Memorandum Of Understanding Concerning 
Cooperation in Fisheries and Aquaculture.  If Taiwan does 
not improve its adherence to international fisheries 
convention rules, AIT might withdraw from the MOU.  The MOU 
serves as the basis for continued U.S. efforts to assist 
Taiwan in participating in fisheries organizations. 
Administrator Shieh appeared to understand the message and 
its significance and committed to do all he can to maintain 
the very positive cooperative working relationship between 
himself and his agency on behalf of TECRO and OES and the 
National Marine Fisheries Service on behalf of AIT. 
 
Talks with MOFA 
--------------- 
 
5.  At the early end of the APEC Fisheries Working Group 
talks, on November 14, Tinkham and AIT ESTOFF visited Kelly 
W. Hsieh, MOFA Deputy Director General for the Department of 
North American Affairs.  Tinkham reviewed Taiwan\'s fishing 
problems and imparted AIT\'s hope that those problems would 
not undermine gains made by Taiwan in the international 
fisheries community over the past decade, which could hinder 
further opportunities for Taiwan to participate in other 
regional fisheries organizations.  Tinkham reviewed the 
problems identified at ICCAT and informed Hsieh about the 
2002 AIT/TECRO MOU, from which AIT may withdraw if Taiwan 
does not find a way to see that its fishermen adhere to 
international fishing convention rules.  Tinkham also 
thanked Hsieh for Chinese Taipei\'s willingness to take on 
the APEC Fisheries Working Group Lead Shepherd role and 
urged Taiwan not to let its fishing problems undermine 
opportunities such a leadership role could afford. 
6. Hsieh expressed his appreciation for AIT\'s concern and 
ongoing positive cooperation.  He asked that AIT provide him 
with written points on the matter.  He also requested more 
details about the exact purported discretions on Taiwan\'s 
part. 
 
7.  AIT thanked Hsieh for his time and promised to provide 
written points as soon as possible. 
 
8.  Comment.  Tinkham in all of his meetings made clear the 
importance of reining in rogue fishermen.  This challenge 
was only accentuated by a Taiwan-sponsored field trip to a 
fishing village on December 13, where the local guide 
informed Tinkham and AIT ESTOFF that the eyes drawn on 
either side of the bows of several fishing boats were 
intended to symbolize fishermen\'s efforts to see and move 
toward fish below water and see and move away from 
government officials above water.  End Comment. 
 
9. This report has been cleared by State/OES/OMC.

SUBJECT: CHINA\'S \"ANTI-SECESSION LAW,\" AND U.S.-TAIWAN 
RELATIONS 
 
 
A) \"The Premises Have Been Destroyed and How Can the 
Four Nos Remain Unchanged\" 
 
An article in the pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" said 
(12/27): 
 
\". China\'s `anti-secession law,\' if correctly expected 
by the government, provides the basis to use force 
against Taiwan, then the law explicitly challenges the 
premises President Chen Shui-bian set for the promises 
of `Four Nos and One Will Not.\' 
 
\"The Taiwan government is forced to face a critical 
problem, that is whether President Chen Shui-bian\'s 
promises on `Four Nos and One Will Not\' still be 
effective in the future? 
 
\"To answer the question is extremely difficult for 
Taiwan, especially when current U.S-China relations 
consistently improve `to the best status for the last 
30 years.\'  Since there are several unexpected 
situations in U.S-Taiwan relations, however, the 
question would more easily irritate the sensitive 
nerves of the United States. 
 
\"After all, this is not a question concerning the 
fundamental position of cross-Strait relations.  If the 
grand direction is not ascertained, any repairing or 
mending [the cross-Strait relations] will end up with 
no rewards.  If Taiwan ignores this question, the next 
challenge [from China] is the position of Taiwan\'s 
sovereignty. .\" 
 
B) \" `Anti-Taiwan Independence\' Does Not Equal `Anti- 
Taiwan\'- the Crisis and the Turning Point in the `Anti- 
Secession Law\'\" 
 
Political Critic Nan Fang-suo said in the centrist, pro- 
status quo \"China Times\" (12/27): 
 
\". The purpose [of China] is not to legislate the 
`Unification Law,\' but to legislate the negative, 
passive, and even the defensive `anti-secession law.\' 
On one hand, to legislate from a negative sense is 
technically easier; and on the other hand, the `anti- 
secession law\' may stimulate the independent faction in 
Taiwan, but expresses good will toward the non- 
independent faction in Taiwan and by so doing reduces 
the negative effect of the legislation to the minimum. 
Most important of all, to abandon the `unification law\' 
and to choose the `anti-secession law\' reflects that 
other than `anti-independence,\' Beijing currently is 
not urgent on `promoting unification\' since there is no 
time table and, thus, there is elasticity toward 
unification. 
 
\"As the degree of internationalization increases, 
Beijing knows more and more each day how to utilize the 
international environment.  In the `anti-secession 
law,\' Beijing\'s action has been defined as a kind of 
`defense,\' instead of `offense.\'  More critically, 
President Chen Shui-bian in the past year made several 
moves intended to make use of the disparity that the 
United States at the same time asserts `One China\' and 
upholds the `Taiwan Relations Act.\'  President Chen 
tried to manipulate the `Taiwan Relations Act\' in the 
hope that the United States will change its `One China\' 
policy.  However, President Chen\'s intention caused 
negative feelings in the United States, and forced 
Secretary of State Colin Powell to say `Taiwan is not 
 
SIPDIS 
an independent sovereign state,\' and Deputy Secretary 
of State Richard Armitage to say `there is no need to 
defend Taiwan,\' and `Taiwan is a part of China.\'  All 
of these indicate that China and the United States have 
become consistent on the position of `anti-Taiwan 
independence.\' It is a signal worth noting that China 
informed the United States before drafting the `anti- 
secession law,\' and to some extent China got the 
`understanding\' from the United States.  At the current 
stage, the United States\' `anti-independence\' not only 
focused on the perspective of `de-jure Taiwan 
independence,\' but started to pay attention to 
`contextual Taiwan independence\' as well.  When China 
and the United States moved toward the same position of 
`anti-Taiwan independence,\' the space in which to 
manipulate `Taiwan independence\' is incrementally 
decreased. 
 
\"President Chen Shui-bian has used up the credit that 
U.S. diplomacy afforded, and left the United States 
with no choice but to stand together with China 
regarding the issue of `anti-independence.\'  In the 
past few years the DPP government persistently, 
implicitly or explicitly, played the `Taiwan 
independence card\' and now it is `game over.\' 
 
\"As to Taiwan independence, however, the situation that 
the `Taiwan independence card\' leads to a dead end may 
be the biggest crisis.  Not only does Taiwan 
independence lose the legitimacy in the international 
community, it also becomes an illegal activity as well. 
But the situation is a major turning point for the non- 
independent fraction. 
 
\"Hence, the `anti-secession law\' and the statements by 
Secretary of State Colin Powell and Deputy Secretary of 
 
SIPDIS 
State Richard Armitage may cause the end of Taiwan 
independence, but certainly not the end of Taiwan. 
 
\"People in Taiwan are not allowed to hate the same 
enemy [i.e. China] with the DPP under DPP\'s dominance. 
People in Taiwan should realize with optimism that 
whenever Taiwan independence diminishes, that is the 
time for the hope of Taiwan to actually start. .\" 
 
C) \"This Legislation Hands the Hot Potato Back to the 
United States; China Will Have More Room for 
Manipulation and the Right to Define the `Cross-Strait 
Status Quo\' Will Be the Target for Bilateral Struggle 
in the Future\" 
 
Journalist Sun Yang-ming wrote in the conservative, pro- 
unification \"United Daily News\" (12/26): 
 
\". The real issue is that once this anti-secession bill 
becomes a law, there will be a struggle between 
Washington and Beijing over who has the dominant right 
to define the so-called `status-quo\' in the future. 
The basic strategic thinking and attitude of China 
toward how to deal with the Taiwan issue has changed. 
As a result, which direction Taiwan will be moving and 
the issue of independence will become a burden for the 
United States.  The concept of an anti-secession law 
coincides with this [new] attitude. 
 
\"The Neo-Conservatives of the Bush administration have 
been trying to use Taiwan as a means to delay China\'s 
rise [as a power] and let Taiwan become a burden for 
China.  However, China is passing back this hot potato 
and having the United States accountable for the 
consequences should Taiwan cross the red line.  This is 
why Beijing only wants an `anti-secession law\' rather 
than a `unification law.\'.\" 
 
D) \"Criticizing Chen Shui-bian? Taiwan is not the 
problem, but China is\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" said in its 
editorial (12/27): 
 
\"The United States is caught in between the democratic 
Taiwan and despotic China.  China always has used 
international negotiation and its domestic market to 
threaten the United States for concessions on the issue 
of cross-Strait relations. The United States 
consequently faces a dilemma in choosing between the 
two. 
 
\"Theoretically, the United States is a democratic 
country, it should enhance its interaction with the 
democratic Taiwan and should express the respectfulness 
of the basic human rights to the people of Taiwan. 
Unfortunately, as leaders 
in the United States and Taiwan lack direct 
communication, unnecessary misunderstandings have 
occurred.  Such misunderstanding would be reduced 
significantly if the ban on contacts of high-ranking 
leaders were lifted. But if [the United States] 
continuously lets the `One-China\'policy stymie 
arbitrarily, the situation could not be improved.  This 
is the structural problem between the United States and 
Taiwan. 
 
\"Anyway, Taiwan is not the problem, but the China is. 
In the past twenty years, the long-term goal of the 
international investments to China, including 
investment from Taiwan, seeks to promote political 
reforms through economic development, and to push China 
to fulfill its international obligations.  The foreign 
capital brings the economic growth [in China], but it 
becomes the resources for China to build its military. 
In the meantime, China increases its political control 
internally, and prepares to use force to solve 
international disputes.  Furthermore,  China is playing 
`big nation diplomacy.\'  By making use of the United 
States\' needs for cooperation on North Korea, Iraq and 
anti-terrorism issues, China manipulates the United 
States with `cooperation but faction\' strategy.  Taiwan 
is among the gains from this strategy.\" 
E) \"U.S. Support for Taiwan May Not Be a Sure Thing\" 
 
Chin Heng-wei commented in the pro-independence \"Taipei 
Times\"(12/26): 
\". The U.S. true focus is not the Taiwan question but 
the threat of China, and Taiwan is merely a landmine 
placed between the two giants. It is only when the 
situation is looked at in this light that one can 
understand the U.S. standpoint on the Taiwan question, 
the TRA and U.S.-China-Taiwan relations. 
 
\"Naturally, America has the choice of not defending 
Taiwan, should it relinquish its interests in the West 
Pacific Region. To put it more clearly, if the U.S. 
sells the `Taiwan landmine\' down the river, and scraps 
the TRA, they will be losing the Western Pacific Region 
as a sphere of influence. This will be tantamount to 
making the same errors they committed 50 years ago, and 
creating a monster that they cannot control. .\"

1.  (C) Summary.  Post-December 11 election jockeying within 
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and between 
Green and Blue alliances continues in ways that may affect 
cross-Strait and U.S. relations.  Members of the DPP\'s New 
Tide faction are publicly and messily blaming President Chen 
Shui-bian for failing to gain a better election result due to 
his efforts to stir voters\' pro-independence sentiment.  Chen 
is being accused of damaging U.S. relations in the process. 
He is staying above the internecine fray while using 
supporters to fight back.  A long weekend of highly public 
intra-DPP bickering was capped Monday morning, December 27, 
by a front page banner headline in the pro-independence 
\"Liberty Times\" proclaiming \"Secret U.S. Emissary Met 
President Chen, Said Taiwan-U.S. Relations Unchanged,\" and 
\"confirmed approval of President Chen\'s performance.\"  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (C) The DPP\'s perceived loss in the December 11 
legislative elections continues to reverberate through Taiwan 
(\"perceived loss\" because, despite gaining two seats, the DPP 
failed to meet President Chen\'s stated expectations for 
pan-Green majority).  The post-election political maneuvering 
involves not only inter-party politics, with the pan-Blue 
alliance pressing its thin majority for increased leverage, 
but also within the ruling DPP itself, with its increasingly 
outspoken factions jockeying with a wounded President for 
ministerial and party posts and increased influence in the 
new government. 
 
3.  (C) The pragmatic -- vice ideologically-driven -- New 
Tide faction has taken the offensive within the DPP, 
criticizing President Chen for his use of sensitive 
independence-related rhetoric during the campaign.  The New 
Tide believes this backfired and alienated centrist voters 
and damaged Taiwan,s relations with the U.S.  Maverick New 
Tider Lin Cho-shui fired the opening salvo on Friday evening, 
December 24, publicly criticizing Chen\'s foreign policy, 
charging that Chen\'s rhetoric had used up Taiwan\'s credit 
with the U.S., and urging Chen to improve relations with the 
U.S.  The New Tide attack hit home because, as the largest 
and electorally most successful DPP faction, it will be 
crucial for DPP prospects in local elections next December. 
 
 
4.  (C) Chen himself has appeared to stay above the political 
fray since December 11 and kept discreetly out of the debate 
over the weekend as the DPP quarrel escalated in the media. 
He was, however, represented by a phalanx of advisors who 
fought back, casting aspersions on the critics\' loyalty to 
the President and to Taiwan and rebutting their charges. 
Presidential Office Secretary General Chiou I-jen, himself a 
New Tide leader, was placed in the awkward position of 
defending his management of U.S. relations while protecting 
his faction.  He told the press on December 25 that Lin\'s 
charges were \"far from the truth\" and that actually 
Taiwan-U.S. relations had entered a new period of friction as 
the U.S. comes to understand that democracy on Taiwan will be 
accompanied by increasing Taiwan identity.  The quarrel 
become so public that DPP Central Discussion Committee Chair 
Kao Chi-peng called a press conference Sunday morning, 
December 26, to urge DPP factions not to air their criticisms 
in public, but rather to present and discuss them internally. 
 
 
5.  (U) The weekend of DPP internecine warfare and the 
defense of President Chen culminated in a front page banner 
headline in the pro-Green \"Liberty Times\" on December 27: 
\"Secret U.S. Envoy Met President Chen, Said Taiwan-U.S. 
Relations Unchanged.\"  According to the report, \"a high level 
Taiwan government official (shouzhang)\" -- terminology 
suggesting Office of the President involvement -- revealed 
that an \"extremely high level U.S. representative secretly 
visited Taipei before Christmas, confirmed U.S. support for 
President Chen,s performance, and stressed there is now no 
misunderstanding between Taiwan and the U.S.  Taiwan and the 
U.S., the report continued, wanted to maintain \"this second 
channel of communication used by Special Envoys like (former 
NSC Senior Asia Director James) Moriarty.\" 
6.  (C) Comment.  Under attack, President Chen pulled out all 
stops and, via his palace guard, fought back against his 
critics within the DPP.  The \"Special Envoy\" press report 
suggests that, despite the DPP election setback and Chen,s 
subsequent lower profile, he and DPP insiders continue 
capable of putting partisan political advantage above foreign 
policy considerations.  The intra-DPP imbroglio may have 
receded from the headlines; DPP Deputy Secretary General Lee 
Ying-yuan told AIT the weekend dust-up occurred in the power 
vacuum left by Chen Shui-bian\'s resignation as Party 
Chairman.  The Presidential Office use of a heavy-handed 
\"U.S. card\" will produce its own after-effects as speculation 
and responses to it play out in the media and in talk shows. 
Beijing may want to know if the U.S. secretly told Chen it 
approves his performance.  During the election campaign, 
Pan-Green leaders dismissed criticisms of playing politics 
with national security and damaging Taiwan-U.S. relations 
over the past two years, replying that relations would be 
\"mended\" after the election.  This latest development 
continues the pattern of the past two years.  End Comment.

A) \"Prevent Independence by All Means, No Hope For 
Negotiations [Between China and Taiwan]\" 
 
Journalist Wang Li-juan wrote in the conservative, pro- 
unification \"United Daily News\" (12/28): 
 
\"China Monday released its national defense white 
paper, in which the `negatively developing Taiwan 
independence power\' is listed as an important factor to 
influence [China\'s] national security.  China proposed 
three strongly-worded `resolute\' oppositions and one 
`never,\' which are more harsh and more baldly stated 
than the `three conditions to use force against Taiwan\' 
stated in its 2000 national defense white paper. 
 
\"`Permanent refusal to negotiate\' is not mentioned in 
the `conditions\' to use force against Taiwan in this 
year\'s white paper.  However, the white paper proposed 
that the two sides across the Strait could only resume 
talks after the Taiwan authority accepts the `One 
China\' principle and terminates separatist activities 
of Taiwan independence.  It is obvious that China by 
all means constrains Taiwan independence in its policy 
toward Taiwan, and China has no hope for future talks 
in the Taiwan Strait..\" 
 
B) \"The National Defense White Paper Is Another Card 
For China to Push For Anti-Secession\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
editorialized (12/28): 
 
\".China\'s 2004 national defense white paper indicated 
that the persistent U.S. arms sale to Taiwan is sending 
a wrong signal [from the United States] to Taiwan.  It 
[the white paper] clearly pointed at the special U.S. 
arms procurement by Taiwan at the cost of more than 600 
billion NTD.  However, China did not mention the United 
States when saying [China] resolutely opposes `any 
country\' forming any military alliance with Taiwan. 
The white paper also said China would keep a low 
profile and a cooperative attitude on its nuclear 
strategy.  These declarations are weaker than before 
and the meaning is that China seeks help from the 
United States, and China does not adopt a 
confrontational attitude with the United States. 
 
\"Looking back on history, it is less than four years 
since China 2000 released its national defense white 
paper commenting on the Taiwan issue, hence, there is 
quite a change in China\'s policy toward Taiwan.  The 
fundamental nature of China\'s military threats toward 
Taiwan has not changed, but the contents of the 
comments and the adjustment in focus are closely 
correlated with political changes within Taiwan.  To be 
frank, the current deadlock in cross-Strait relations 
is not caused by any single factor from either side of 
the Taiwan Strait.  Tests in the future might be more 
grim, and the authorities on both sides of the Strait 
should face them with wisdom.\"

1. (C) Summary:  The Presidential Office submitted on 
December 20 its list of 29 Control Yuan nominees for 
Legislative Yuan approval.  Pan-Blue legislators, as well as 
some ruling DPP legislators, immediately dismissed the 
nominees as unqualified and vowed to resist the Presidential 
Office\'s attempts to secure the nominees\' confirmation. 
Pan-Green officials insist the Pan-Blue\'s opposition to the 
nomination list is politically motivated.  The reflexive 
opposition of the Pan-Blue to the Control Yuan nominations 
and the unwillingness of President Chen to compromise are 
further evidence that the post-December 11 election promises 
of inter-party cooperation are becoming history and gridlock 
has returned to Taiwan\'s legislative process.  End Summary. 
 
A Beautiful List? 
----------------- 
 
2. (C) On December 20, the Presidential Office submitted to 
the Legislative Yuan (LY) for approval a list of 29 nominees 
for the Control Yuan, an oversight body that has the power to 
audit, censure, and impeach government officials at all 
levels.  Presidential Office Secretary General Su Tseng-chang 
insisted the list was \"a very beautiful list,\" explaining 
that President Chen had carefully selected the 29 nominees 
from a list of 53 candidates recommended by a task force 
chaired by Vice President Annette Lu.  Other members of the 
task force included Secretary General Su and Taiwan High 
Speed Rail Chair Nita Ing.  The current Control Yuan members 
will conclude their six-year tenure on January 31.  All 29 
nominees of the new body must be confirmed by the LY before 
they can assume office at the beginning of February 2005. 
(Note:  Although the ROC Constitution stipulates 29 Control 
Yuan members, there are currently only 24.  Originally 
appointed to the Control Yuan in 1999, Kang Ning-hsiang and 
Chang Fu-mei gave up their seats in 2001 in order to serve as 
NSC Secretary General and Overseas Chinese Affairs 
Commissioner, respectively.  In 1999 the National Assembly 
rejected one of former President Lee Teng-hui\'s nominees, 
Chang Jin-chen.  Two other Control Yuan members have since 
died.  The President has the power to appoint new nominees in 
the interim years to fill the vacancies, however the LY 
failed to confirm candidates nominated in June 2001 and May 
2002.  End Note) 
 
Some Think Not 
-------------- 
 
3. (C) Many legislators from all parties quickly lined up to 
criticize the list, however, questioning the qualifications 
of the nominees, accusing Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu of 
using the nomination process as political patronage, and, on 
the Pan-Blue side, complaining that they had not been 
consulted on the nominations.  Critics pointed out that three 
of the nominees -- Tsai Ming-hua, Hung Gui-sen, and Yu Mei-nu 
-- are legal advisers to Vice President Lu.  Some also 
charged that many of the nominees have close links to 
business groups undertaking public construction projects, and 
criticized President Chen for not renominating incumbent 
Control Yuan members who are currently investigating 
allegations relating to Chen\'s family, the Lafayette frigate 
scandal, and the Taiwan High Speed Rail project. 
 
4. (C) Perhaps the most controversial nominee is the nominee 
for Control Yuan President -- Clement Chang (Chien-pang), a 
KMT member who is currently a Senior Advisor in the Office of 
the President.  Chang was forced to resign as Transportation 
and Communications Minister in 1991 after coming under attack 
by then-Legislator Chen Shui-bian for his alleged involvement 
in the Hualong Group stock speculation scandal.  KMT LY 
Caucus Whip Huang Teh-fu attacked the nominations of Chang 
and Michael Hsiao, the nominee for Control Yuan Vice 
President, for generally supporting whatever party was in 
power.  Hsiao is currently a National Policy Advisor and an 
Academia Sinica Fellow. 
 
5. (C) Attempts by the ruling party to counter opposition to 
the list of nominees have proved futile.  Local media 
reported that a December 21 cross-party meeting of 
legislative leaders lasted less than five minutes after KMT 
Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan left the meeting in protest when 
DPP negotiators refused to discuss the March 19 Truth 
Investigation Commission Law.  A second negotiation meeting 
on December 24 also ended without resolution.  The DPP 
leadership also failed to quell opposition within its own 
ranks.  Three DPP legislators have publicly criticized the 
list of nominees as unqualified.  DPP Legislators Shen 
Fu-hsiung, Tuan Yi-kang, and Chou Ching-yu, all of whom 
failed to win reelection, said at the December 21 party 
caucus meeting that they would resign ahead of the 
confirmation vote if their party decided to take disciplinary 
action against those members who did not conform to the party 
line. 
 
Politics at Play 
---------------- 
 
6. (C) Objections to the Control Yuan nomination list appear 
to have a heavily political basis.  Pan-Blue legislators have 
not clearly explained why they believe the nominees are 
unqualified.  Six (seven, if Chang Fu-mei is counted) of the 
29 nominees are incumbent Control Yuan members.  A comparison 
of the qualifications of the incumbent members and current 
nominees shows that both groups contain roughly similar 
numbers of academics, civic group leaders, legal experts, and 
former government officials from the Executive, Judicial, and 
Legislative branch.  Nevertheless, PFP Legislator Lee 
Ching-hua told AIT that the list was \"unsatisfactory,\" and 
that there was no room for compromise because it was Chen 
Shui-bian\'s responsibility to nominate and the LY\'s 
responsibility to reject those candidates it found 
unqualified.  PFP Legislator and Spokesman Hwang Yih-jiau 
told AIT that President Chen has no sense of responsibility 
and had merely selected his own cronies.  Chen, he said, had 
nothing to lose by nominating his political allies, but by 
doing so Chen was inviting a fight with the Pan-Blue. 
 
7. (C) Hwang Yih-jiau\'s legislative aide later admitted to 
AIT that the Pan-Blue does not oppose everyone on the list, 
and that the Opposition is blocking the nominations largely 
because Chen Shui-bian did not consult the LY prior to 
releasing the list.  Lee Chuan-chao, a KMT Legislator and 
Central Standing Committee (CSC) member, told AIT that he 
personally would not have challenged the nominations and did 
not believe that the opposition parties had the right to 
demand that they be consulted in forming the list of 
nominees.  However, Lee explained, the KMT leadership had 
decided to either oppose the current list or demand that 
President Chen consult the Pan-Blue before submitting any 
other names. 
 
8. (C) Some objections to the nomination list are based on 
KMT suspicion of collusion between Chen Shui-bian and \"Lee 
Teng-hui sympathizers\" still in the KMT.  For example, newly 
elected LY member and son of KMT Vice Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung, 
John Wu (Chih-yang), told AIT that Chen had worked out a deal 
with independent Legislator Lu Shin-ming for Lu not to stand 
for reelection in exchange for a Control Yuan seat. (Note: 
Lu was a KMT member, but the party revoked his membership for 
not voting along party lines.  Endnote).  Other Pan-Blue 
officials suggested that Chen made a similar arrangement with 
eight-term KMT Legislator Hung Chao-nan.  Wang Jin-pyng, who 
recently has gone out of his way demonstrating loyalty to 
Party Chairman Lien Chan, told AIT \"any KMT member who 
cooperates with Chen Shui-bian is a traitor.\" 
 
Pan-Green Refutes Allegations 
----------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The Presidential Office has sought to counter 
opposition to the nominees.  On December 23 President Chen 
publicly defended his Control Yuan choices, argued that past 
attempts at cross-party negotiations on Control Yuan nominees 
have resulted in failure, and vowed not to revise his list of 
nominees.  On December 25, Presidential Secretary General Su 
Tseng-chang reaffirmed President Chen\'s commitment to the 
 
SIPDIS 
current list.  DPP Deputy Secretary General Lee Ying-yuan 
told AIT on December 28 that Pan-Blue opposition is entirely 
political.  He insisted that KMT is being disruptive in part 
because KMT Chairman Lien Chan personally dislikes Chang 
Chien-pang.  After a moment, Lee added, \"actually, it is 
because Lien dislikes Chen Shui-bian.\"  Lee stated that 
legislative approval of the nomination list and reviewing the 
qualifications of nominees are two entirely different 
matters.  The LY, he explained, has the responsibility to 
review the list, confirm those nominees it deems qualified, 
and reject those nominees it deems unqualified; however, he 
argued, the LY is acting unconstitutionally if it refuses to 
act on the list at all and forces the President to resubmit 
an entire list. 
 
10. (C) Senior Presidential Advisor Wu Li-pei told AIT on 
December 28 that many of the Pan-Blue\'s allegations are 
simply untrue.  He argued that High Speed Rail Chair Nita 
Ing, who has been accused of a conflict of interest, was only 
one of five members on the selection task force and did not 
have final say on nominees.  In any case, he continued, 
Control Yuan incumbents Huang Huang-hsiung and Lee Shen-yi, 
who are investigating the Taiwan High Speed Rail, were 
renominated.  Referring to allegations that incumbents 
investigating Chen\'s family had been excluded from 
renomination, Wu pointed out that the Control Yuan, in fact, 
is not empowered to investigate family members of public 
officials.  Wu told AIT that by nominating Chang Chien-pang 
for Control Yuan President, Chen Shui-bian had been trying to 
reach out to the KMT and had been shocked when the KMT 
disavowed Chang as a member.  TSU-affiliated Taiwan Advocates 
Policy Director Chow Mei-li told AIT that the Pan-Blue is 
flexing its muscles after winning a narrow majority in the 
December 11 LY election.  She said the political climate 
would continue to be contentious for a while. 
 
11. (C) Commenting on the DPP Legislators who criticized the 
Control Yuan nominations, Lee Ying-yuan told AIT that these 
particular LY members simply opposed \"out of habit.\"  Shen 
Fu-hsiung, he added, \"is very intelligent but he has zero 
E.Q.\" (emotional quotient, i.e. interpersonal skills). 
Taiwan Advocate Policy Director Chow Mei-li said that until 
the new cabinet is appointed and the new LY session begins, 
many DPP and TSU members will grandstand in order to leverage 
their position and maximize their influence. 
 
Comment:  Return to Gridlock 
---------------------------- 
 
12. (C) The negative response of the Pan-Blue to the 
Presidential Office\'s Control Yuan nominees and President 
Chen\'s subsequent digging in his heels indicate the LY 
election night promises of cross-party cooperation are fast 
evaporating.  Pan-Green officials may be not be far off the 
mark when they insist Pan-Blue opposition is politically 
motivated.  Since winning the LY majority, Pan-Blue has been 
demanding the right to be consulted for all presidential 
appointments, including that of Premier.  Much of the 
Pan-Blue impulse is driven by rage over successive failures 
to void the presidential election and a hope to find leverage 
to renew its investigation.  Moreover, political appointments 
will always be controversial, but President Chen might have 
served his own purposes better had he paid heed to the 
tradition of consulting the LY on Control Yuan appointments 
and to his own promise of more cross-party gestures.

A) \"Face Directly the War Threats Toward Taiwan Imposed

The pro-independence \"Liberty Times\" editorialized 
(12/29): 
 
\"The situation that the [national defense] white paper 
and the anti-secession law came out together fully 
demonstrates the concern of the Chinese authorities 
toward the direction of Taiwan.  Hence, even if China

intends to step up the threats and the bluffing to 
effortlessly confront popular opinion in Taiwan. 
 
\"In sum, one sentence for the 30-thousand-word white 
paper is that its purpose is pointed at Taiwan.  China 
has been trying to devour Taiwan more and more each 
day, and China does not hide its intention to use force 
against Taiwan.  Under such a serious threat, Taiwan 
should establish enough defense capabilities as its 
first priority.  Hence, objectively considering the 
situation in the evolving international environment, 
Taiwan should grasp the precious chance when the United

as submarines, anti-submarine planes, and the Patriot 
missiles to Taiwan. .\"

editorialized (12/29): 
 
\"It\'s about time that President Chen Shui-bian made a 
choice between continuously pursuing independence and

decided to choose the former, Taiwan will eventually 
have to fight a communist invasion on its own without 
aid from its U.S. ally. 
 
\"The challenge now facing Chen is that he must revise 
his independence route by moving toward the political 
center.  Failing to do so, he is certain to risk waging 
a devastating war with China without the United States

SUBJECT: SUPPORTING THE RICE BOMBER - A DEMONSTRATION 
AGAINST RICE IMPORTS AND THE WTO 
 
REF: NONE 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On December 26, about 500 farmers and 
activists demonstrated in central Taiwan to support Yang Ru- 
men, the \"Rice Bomber,\" who planted a series of bombs around 
Taipei over the past 14 months.  The farmers protested 
against rice imports and other post-WTO changes in Taiwan\'s 
trade policy and submitted a list of ten demands to Taiwan\'s 
Council of Agriculture (COA). Although COA already has in 
place several programs demanded by the demonstrators, it 
expects to face considerable pressure from local farmers as 
Taiwan participates in future WTO negotiations on 
agriculture, especially when the rice issue is raised.  In 
the end, although the protestors\' concerns resonate though 
much of Taiwan\'s society, their actions are unlikely to 
change Taiwan\'s trade policies.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) About 500 people demonstrated on December 26 in 
central Taiwan in support of Yang Ru-men, better known as 
the \"Rice Bomber.\"  After his arrest on November 25, Yang 
confessed to planting at least eight of sixteen bombs around 
Taipei to protest rice imports.  Starting on October 27, 
2003, the \"rice bombs\" were planted in parks, telephone 
booths, metro stations and near government offices.  Often 
filled with rice, only two of the devices exploded -- and 
none caused any significant injuries or damage. 
 
3. (U) The demonstration was held in Erh-Lin Township, 
Changhua County, Yang\'s birthplace and the home of his 
grandparents.  Reportedly, this was also the site of a 1929 
protest against the ruling Japanese government\'s 
exploitation of local sugar cane farmers.  Speakers at the 
demonstration often alluded to the \"Spirit of 1929.\" 
 
4. (U) The demonstrators consisted of activists from 
farmers\' associations, county councils, community colleges, 
legal groups, academia -- and even a gangster organization. 
Approximately twenty distinct activist groups and 
organizations participated in the protest. 
 
 
The Rice Bomber as Guy Fawkes 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The demonstrators insisted that the Rice Bomber is a 
hero and not a terrorist.  The speakers said that although 
Yang may have been wrong to plant bombs in public places, he 
clearly had no intention to harm anyone.  The bomber simply 
wanted to draw the government\'s attention to the plight of 
local farmers.  Yang\'s actions were further justified as the 
only way the poor can fight back in Taiwan\'s increasingly 
stratified society.  Since his cause was just, the 
protestors declared that Yang should be granted amnesty and 
be released immediately.  To show their support, Changhua 
Farmers have donated money for Yang\'s legal defense. 
 
 
Anger at Council of Agriculture 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Speakers at the rally blamed Taiwan\'s Council of 
Agriculture (COA) for doing too little for farmers since the 
island\'s 2002 WTO accession.  They criticized COA officials 
who \"sit in their air-conditioned offices\" and make 
agricultural polices \"without thinking of the farmer\'s real 
problems in the field.\" The demonstration\'s program included 
a song urging Taiwan people to eat local rice and fruit and 
a performance about how Taiwan\'s WTO accession has turned 
the farmers\' sky black. 
 
7. (U) The protesters urged Taiwan\'s authorities to reduce 
the high tax on rice wine and renegotiate the agricultural 
part of Taiwan\'s WTO accession agreement.  They blamed the 
government for opening the local market to agricultural 
imports, which purportedly had \"a huge impact\" on prices for 
local agricultural products in recent years.  They allege 
this has made it difficult for farmers to make a decent 
living. 
 
 
Class Conflict Surfaces 
----------------------- 
 
8. (U) More generally, the protestors also criticized the 
lack of fairness and justice in society.  In addition to 
being exploited by local \"capitalists,\" Taiwan\'s authorities 
have made local farmers and workers vulnerable to \"foreign 
capitalists.\"  The resulting income inequality has created a 
situation where the poor cannot support their families and 
children\'s education while the rich consume ever more 
luxuries. 
 
 
Petitioning the Council of Agriculture 
-------------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) Since the arrest of the rice bomber, reportedly more 
than 30,000 people have signed a petition with ten demands 
for COA. 
 
- Establish a Farmer\'s Minimum Wage.  The government should 
ensure that a farmer\'s income is no less than the minimum 
wage of a blue-collar labor. 
 
- Permit Rezoning of Agricultural Land.  Taiwan authorities 
should allow more land to be rezoned out of agriculture. 
Since joining the WTO, Taiwan no longer needs to keep so 
much land for farming. Although it seemingly embraces 
change, this proposal is attractive to many of Taiwan\'s 
farmers because it would allow them to sell their 
increasingly valuable land to developers. 
 
- Wider Use of Price Stabilization Funds.  To stabilize 
incomes, enhance agricultural development and boost the 
competitiveness of local agricultural products, COA should 
establish stabilization funds for all agricultural, fishery, 
and livestock products. 
 
- More Exports.  Increase exports of locally produced 
agricultural, fishery and livestock products to reduce 
supplies and maintain local prices. 
 
- More Market Information.  COA should provide more data on 
the situation and outlook on all agricultural, fishery and 
livestock production in order to control local supplies and 
prices. 
 
- More Funding to Educate Farmer\'s Children.  Farmers should 
receive assistance in educating their children, especially 
those at the lowest income levels. 
 
- More Protection for Producers Hurt by Imports.  All 
agricultural, fishery and livestock products should be 
eligible for Taiwan\'s import relief measure, which pays out 
to farmers hurt by increasing in imports. 
 
- Payments for Conservation.  COA should create a permanent 
fund to purchase land from farmers for conservation 
purposes. 
 
- Increased purchases of locally produced agricultural, 
fishery and livestock products for humanitarian food aid 
shipments. 
 
If Taiwan authorities do not respond to these farmers\' 
concerns, activists have threatened to continue and even 
escalate their protests. 
 
 
Press Reaction 
-------------- 
 
10. (U) The event was covered by AP yesterday and also 
received prominent coverage in the United Daily News and 
Apple Daily. In all, eight newspapers had coverage of the 
demonstration.  In terms of editorial reaction, a United 
Daily News editorial urged the government to look seriously 
into the problem of Taiwan\'s agricultural industry, while a 
Liberty Times editorial said the protest sent the wrong 
message by condoning the rice bomber\'s violence.  The split 
between supporting the rice bomber\'s goals and condemning 
his methods makes it uncertain whether he will gain a large 
like Jose Bove, the French agrarian anti-globalization 
protestor. 
 
 
Council of Agriculture Reaction 
------------------------------- 
 
11. (SBU) According to COA, Taiwan already has in place 
several of the ten programs demanded by farmers.  For 
example, COA already makes conservation payments and 
actively promotes Taiwan agricultural exports.  COA also 
assists farmers by subsidizing fertilizer in order to cut 
local agricultural production costs.  COA insists that it 
has always been a strong advocate for Taiwan\'s farmers and 
is willing to communicate with them about their further 
concerns. 
 
12. (SBU) Although COA tried to explain current agricultural 
polices to farmers in its response to the ten-point 
petition, it does not plan to change its policies.  This 
does not mean COA is unconcerned - it expects to face 
considerable pressure from local farmers as Taiwan 
participates in future WTO negotiations in agriculture, 
especially when the issue of rice is raised. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (SBU) Although concern for the farmer resonates with 
many Taiwan residents who are often just a generation or two 
away from the farm, public distaste for violence has likely 
undercut widespread support for the protest.  Farmers will 
likely to continue blaming WTO and COA for their low 
incomes, despite the fact that rural poverty is primarily a 
result of Taiwan\'s small scale and inefficient farming 
sector.  The fact that agricultural prices are largely 
unchanged since Taiwan\'s WTO accession has not been 
recognized widely.  Low farm incomes, combined with some 
minor pressure from imports, will likely fuel some continued 
protests against imported agricultural products. 
 
14. (SBU) It is also worth noting that some of the ten 
policies suggested in the petition are contradictory.  For 
example, the petition combines market-oriented elements such 
as the land-zoning proposal and better market intelligence 
with larger support payments.  The linking of higher 
agricultural support payments with increased competitiveness 
reveals a lack of sophisticated economic thinking amongst 
the petition\'s drafters. 
 
15. (SBU) AIT/AGR expects that COA will continue its 
combination of palliatives for producers and continued 
resistance to further agricultural trade liberalization. 
Most concretely, this is likely to take the form of 
continued active Taiwan participation in the anti- 
liberalization WTO Group of 10 and in strong opposition to 
any attempts to further open Taiwan\'s rice market.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
 
A) \"China Is Missing Another Opportunity for [Cross- 
Strait] Peace\" 
 
Lin Cheng-yi, research fellow at the National Chengchi 
University\'s Institute of International Relations, said 
in a commentary in the centrist, pro-status quo \"China 
Times\" (12/30): 
 
\". On one hand, Beijing said it will deal with Taiwan 
independence at all costs; it lashed out at the United 
States\' arms sales to Taiwan, saying the move did not 
contribute to cross-Strait stability; and it continues 
increasing ground-to-ground missile deployment against 
Taiwan.  On the other hand, however, Beijing said it 
wants to pursue `four environments,\' namely, a peaceful 
and stable international environment, a friendly 
neighboring environment, an environment for equal and 
reciprocal cooperation, and an environment for 
objective and friendly public opinion.  In fact, it is 
highly difficult for Beijing to seek to strike a 
balance between these two contradictory directions. 
But Taiwan is so occupied with internal struggle and 
dealing with three battlefields at the same time - the 
battlefield between the ruling and opposition parties 
in Taiwan, between two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and 
between the United States and Taiwan - that it has 
provided Beijing with a wonderful opportunity to 
isolate the island.  Other countries such as France, 
the United States, Singapore and Australia, have all 
made strongly-worded statements against Taiwan and 
commented on Taiwan\'s political development from 
Beijing\'s perspective. . 
 
\". While seeking to make its national defense 
transparent, Beijing is also releasing a signal that it 
will `fight against the United States and intimidate 
Taiwan.\'  But the more Beijing emphasizes the use of 
force and the more high-handed it gets, the more it 
proves that its Taiwan policy has failed to work and 
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait are moving apart 
from each other. 
 
\"To address China\'s `anti-secession law,\' Taiwan\'s top 
priority is not to split from the inside.  The DPP 
government must first try to coordinate between Taiwan 
and the United States and between the ruling and 
opposition parties inside Taiwan if it wants to reduce 
its three battlefields and three rivals to one 
battlefield (the cross-Strait one).\" 
 
B) \"Can Washington, Beijing and Taipei Get off the 
Train and Talk for a While?\" 
 
Wu Yu-shan, research fellow and director of the 
preparatory office for the Institute of Political 
Science, Academia Sinica, said in an op-ed piece of the 
centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" (12/30): 
 
\". When the train that Taiwan is riding [i.e. Taiwan\'s 
constitutional re-engineering] starts to crash into the 
train on which Beijing is riding [i.e. China\'s anti- 
secession law], Washington is actually sitting on 
Taiwan\'s train.  Given its powerful strength, the 
United States could add great weight to Taiwan\'s train. 
But Washington does not want to see the train crash, so 
it started to warn Taiwan\'s train driver using harsh 
words like `Taiwan\'s leader is trying to destroy the 
status quo,\' or `Taiwan is not a sovereign state.\'  The 
question is whether Washington values Taiwan\'s 
strategic position and if it sees Beijing as a long- 
term hypothetical enemy of the United States. 
Washington has natural feelings in favor of the 
democratic Taiwan, so it does not want to get off the 
train.  As a result, for the Taiwan train driver, no 
matter how harsh Washington scolds him, as long as it 
still stays on the train, the Taiwan train is much 
stronger than that of Beijing\'s and it does not fear 
crashing against Beijing\'s train.  If Beijing keeps its 
senses, it will not go into a showdown with the United 
States.  In other words, Beijing might be the one that 
steps on the brake eventually during this train crash 
incident. . 
 
\". Since both sides of the Taiwan Strait have walked 
away from the hypothetical framework of the `interim 
agreement,\' will Washington be able to re-gain control 
of the [cross-Strait] situation?  For Washington, the 
best way to remove the ultimate cause of trouble is to 
say clearly that it will not support Taiwan when the 
latter declares independence and thus triggers a war 
across the Taiwan Strait.  In other words, the United 
States is saying that it is ready to get off the train 
and does not want to play games together with Taiwan 
any more.  This is the real meaning behind [Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State Richard] Armitage\'s 
`landmine\' remarks and his statement that [Washington] 
`is not required to defend Taiwan.\'  Armitage\'s words 
have created a great impact in Taiwan because if 
Washington gets off the train, the whole situation will 
change.  But since the American officials like 
[Secretary of State Colin] Powell and Armitage who 
recently made statements criticizing Taiwan will get 
off the train of the Bush administration first, Taiwan 
is still watching and waiting [for further 
development].  Nonetheless, it will still be very 
dangerous no matter whether the situation turns out to 
be that the United States stays on Taiwan\'s train which 
crashes with the train of Beijing or the United States 
gets off the train and leaves Taiwan\'s train to crash 
with Beijing\'s. .\"

Board of Foreign Trade Director Peter Ho requested that 
Washington Agencies reconsider sanctions on Taiwan\'s Ecoma 
Enterprise Co. Ltd. Taiwan had checked with Washington 
Agencies regarding the case prior to issuing the export

sensitive technologies, AIT provided ref c points in response 
to Ho\'s earlier request for information on how AIT would 
handle a report from Taiwan that addressed how Taiwan is 
implementing the measures of UNSC 1540.  Ho also reported 
that Taiwan has decided to seek Taiwan firms that can safely 
destroy the phosphorus pentasulfide shipment detained in 
Kaohsiung.  Taiwan might well request US assistance to 
dispose of the shipment.  End Summary. 
 
Taiwan Asks for Reconsideration of Sanctions on Ecoma Co. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
3.  (S) AIT Econ Chief met with Peter Ho, Director of 
Import/Export Administration in Taiwan\'s Board of Foreign 
Trade on December 30 at Ho\'s request to discuss USG sanctions 
on Taiwan\'s Ecoma Enterprise Co. Ltd. (Refs A & B).  Ho 
discussed the case at some length. He said that in 2003 BOFT 
had issued an export permit to Ecoma company to sell the CNC 
tilting rotary table to Iran\'s Mizan Machine Manufacturing 
Company, but only after seeking comment from the USG about 
the proposed transaction.  According to Ho, in September 2003 
Ecoma sought an export permit from BOFT.  BOFT, in turn, 
notified TECRO/Washington of the proposed transaction and 
requested comment from Washington Agencies.  TECRO/Washington 
had reported back that, after consulting with Susan Daoussi 
of USDOC\'s Bureau of Industrial Security, Washington Agencies 
had quote no relevant information end quote on its computer 
system regarding the proposed transaction. Based on this 
response from Washington Agencies, Ho said BOFT issued the 
export permit. 
 
4.  (S) Ho noted that he and BOFT Director General Francisco 
Huang became concerned about this case when AIT notified BOFT 
in November 2004 about USG concerns over the Ecoma/Mizan sale 
(reftel D).  He said that BOFT requested that 
TECRO/Washington reconfirm Washington Agencies comment on the 
sale.  On December 15, 2004, Ho said that TECRO/Washington 
reported that it had checked with Brian Nilsson of BIS and 
received the same comment that Washington Agencies had quote 
no relevant information end quote on its computer system 
regarding the proposed transaction. 
 
5.  (S) Ho said that, in his view the Ecoma Company has 
complied with Taiwan\'s export control regulations and should 
not be subject to sanctions.  He asked that Washington 
Agencies reconsider the decision to sanction Ecoma based on 
the factors listed above.  He noted that Ecoma first sought 
an export permit and then waited for the appropriate process 
to be completed before shipping the equipment.  Further, he 
said Ecoma continues to act in good faith and as evidence of 
this told us that on December 21, 2004 Ecoma applied for an 
export permit to sell another machine of the same type to 
Mizan Machine Manufacturing.  In light of the recent 
information from AIT about Mizan Machine Manufacturing, Ho 
said that BOFT would of course deny this application.  AIT 
suggested to Ho that he should notify Washington Agencies of 
the second request for a CNC tilting rotary table from Mizan 
Machine Manufacturing. 
 
Taiwan Plans for UNSC 1540 Report 
--------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Earlier, Taiwan had responded positively to AIT\'s 
proposal that Taiwan issue a voluntary report on its efforts 
to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
similar to the one required under UNSC 1540.  AIT conveyed to 
Ho the points contained in ref c regarding AIT plans on how 
the US would handle Taiwan\'s report.  We noted such a report 
would provide Taiwan an opportunity for a peer review 
evaluation process of Taiwan\'s non-proliferation measures and 
assured Ho that AIT does not intend to release Taiwan\'s 
report.  Nevertheless, we encouraged Taiwan to release its 
own report.  Ho expressed appreciation for the response and 
told us that DG Huang will be hosting an interagency meeting 
on January 12 to discuss Taiwan\'s approach to preparing the 
report.  He said that a number of agencies will participate 
in the meeting, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
the Ministry of National Defense, the Atomic Energy Council, 
Taiwan\'s Environmental Protection Administration, the 
Ministry of Finance, Taiwan\'s Customs Administration and the 
Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau. 
 
 
Taiwan Has Decided to Destroy P2S5 
---------------------------------- 
7.  (S) Referring to a case dating back to August 2003 of 
Taiwan having detained a shipment of phosphorus pentasulfide 
(P2S5), Ho said that last week Minister of Economic Affairs 
Ho Mei-yueh had reached a preliminary decision that Taiwan 
should destroy the chemicals rather than continue to store 
them because of their hazardous nature.  He said that Taiwan 
will check to see if firms in Taiwan can safely destroy the 
detained shipment.  If firms in Taiwan are unable to do so, 
he said that Taiwan will then ask the US to adopt the same 
approach as was used in 1996 regarding Ammonium Perchlorate 
and remove the detained shipment from Taiwan.  Ho did not 
mention that when AIT Director hosted Premier Yu and Minister 
Ho Mei-yueh to lunch last Thursday, the Premier directed 
Minister Ho to find a way to destroy the detained chemicals 
and seek assistance from the US military if necessary. 
(Comment:  Taiwan had little success in its original efforts 
to locate a buyer or someone willing to destroy the shipment. 
 For many months Taiwan has been pressing the US to resolve 
the status of the detained P2S5 by asking Washington Agencies 
to locate a buyer.  Progress of a sort has been made in that 
Taiwan has now decided that it is best to destroy the 
shipment rather than continue storing it, but we see little 
reason to expect that it will report any greater success this 
time around.  It is likely that Taiwan will shortly be making 
a formal request for the US. to remove this shipment from 
Kaohsiung harbor.  End Comment.) 
 
8.  Action request:  AIT requests Washington Agencies 
guidance on how to respond to BOFT\'s request for 
reconsideration of the sanctions on Ecoma.

SUBJECT: \"UNITED DAILY NEWS\" COVERAGE OF PRESIDENT CHEN 
SHUI-BIAN\'S NEW YEAR\'S ADDRESS 
 
 
Summary: January 2, the Chinese-language \"United Daily 
News\" carried straight news coverage of President Chen 
Shui-bian\'s New Year\'s address, in which Chen called 
for the establishment of a Committee for Cross-Strait 
Peace and Development.  Full-text translation of the 
editorial follows. 
 
\"Chen Says in the New Year\'s Address: Form a Committee 
for Cross-Strait Peace and Development.  [Chen Vows to] 
Push for an Interactive Framework for Peace, Urging 
Beijing Not to Neglect Taiwan People\'s Determination to 
Defend the Republic of China\" 
 
Journalist Liu Pao-chieh said in the conservative, pro- 
unification \"United Daily News\" (1/2): 
 
\"President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday in his New 
Year\'s address that [Taiwan] will adopt an unhurried 
attitude of being `steady and progressing, stable but 
not hasty\' to steadily form a `Committee for Cross- 
Strait Peace and Development,\' to consolidate Taiwan\'s 
internal consensus, and to actively push for as well as 
establish an interactive framework for cross-Strait 
peace and stability. 
 
\"President Chen Saturday delivered his New Year\'s 
greetings entitled `Open a Stable New Era of 
Negotiations and Dialogue.\'  He urged Beijing not to 
neglect the firm resolution of the Taiwan people to 
defend the sovereignty, security, and dignity of the 
Republic of China.  The long-term development of peace 
across the Taiwan Strait should be a common hope shared 
by both sides of the Taiwan Strait and is in accordance 
with the expectations of the international community. 
 
\"President Chen said in the future, he will 
continuously stick to the policy route of `standing on 
a firm position and moving forward in a pragmatic 
manner\' to deal with cross-Strait relations.  He will 
insist on `keeping the ambition, and not messing up 
with the sequence\' even when facing China\'s unilateral 
and radical behaviors, Chen said. 
 
\"President Chen pointed out that in the past four 
years, he has extended olive branches to China numerous 
times and has actively sought [to form] a new basis for 
both sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume negotiations 
and dialogue.  Even in his inaugural speech delivered 
May 20, 2004, his National Day speech, and a meeting 
with the high-ranking national security officials 
November 10, 2004, Chen has repeatedly expressed 
sincerity and good will gestures to push for the 
normalization of cross-Strait relations.  However, Chen 
said, it is very regrettable that China still does not 
abandon military threats, and it even persistently 
oppresses Taiwan using all means it can and speaks 
viciously toward Taiwan. 
 
\"President Chen said China unilaterally attempted to 
play the role as an arbitrator and punisher regarding 
cross-Strait issues and to make up a so-called `legal 
basis\' for its use of force against Taiwan.  Such moves 
will not only unilaterally change the peaceful status 
quo in the Taiwan Strait but will also impose the 
biggest threat to regional stability and world peace. 
 
\"In his speech, President Chen showed his appreciation 
to several international allies, including the United 
States and Japan, for their long-standing support of 
Taiwan people and concern for peace in the Taiwan 
Strait.  Chen said the friendships that Taiwan has 
established in the international community are based on 
not only alliance of the values of freedom, democracy, 
and human rights, but also long-term cooperative 
relationships and mutual understanding. 
 
\"President Chen pointed out that under strong pressure 
from China, Taiwan\'s diplomatic efforts are facing 
extreme difficulties. Some tasks can be done but are 
better kept quiet, and Taiwan sometimes even has to 
endure humiliation and bear the heavy load.  Other 
people can surely make criticisms and comments [about 
Taiwan], but they should not distort or even denigrate 
Taiwan\'s relationships with other allies using 
groundless speculations.\"

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
 
A)  \"No Warning in Armitage Comments\" 
 
Washington-based journalist James Wang said in the pro- 
independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
(12/31/04): 
 
\". When the US cooked up its `one China\' policy, it 
imposed its opinion on the Taiwanese people.  Taiwan 
has become a more democratic country since the 
localized Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to 
power. Faced with the `one China\' principle, which is 
endangering the interests of the country, we can no 
longer tolerate it. . 
 
\"Political friction between Taiwan and the US may occur 
if the `one China\' principle is challenged.  To Taiwan, 
the dispute with the US will incur some `warnings,\' 
which are not fatal.  If we do not stand firm on 
challenging the `one China\' policy, Taiwan will become 
another Hong Kong.  The US should understand that while 
it may not have to recognize Taiwan as a country, it 
cannot force Taiwan to negate itself as a country. 
 
\"The KMT, gloating over the DPP\'s troubles, thinks Chen 
has overstepped the red line drawn by the US.  It is an 
overstatement to say [Deputy Secretary of State 
Richard] Armitage was warning Taiwan when he said the 
US is not required to defend Taiwan under the TRA. 
 
\"First, while Chen has pushed for constitutional reform 
and to uphold the sovereignty of Taiwan, he has not 
totally ignored the interests of the US and the 
security and stability of the region.  Otherwise he 
would not have put forward the `four noes\' pledge 
earlier this year.  Second, it is impossible for China 
to be unaware of the fact that the right to declare an 
act of war resides with the US Congress and that there 
is no requirement in the TRA that forces the US to 
defend Taiwan.  Third, no one can precisely say the US 
will come to Taiwan\'s defense if China attacks. 
However, the leadership of the Chinese government has 
to presume that the US will be present if China tries 
to take Taiwan by force. . 
 
\"Armitage\'s remarks were perfectly clear.  The US\' 
strategy is to `deter,\' using a demonstration of power 
to warn China not to utilize military force as the 
first step to `defend Taiwan.\'  To deter, however, does 
not amount to declaring war.  In 1996, China launched 
missiles toward Taiwan as part of military maneuvers 
and the US deployed two aircraft carriers to nearby 
seas. . 
 
\"To study the meaning of the TRA, China should include 
past examples of similar situations.  Armitage brought 
discussions up to the constitutional level when 
touching on the right to declare a war.  The fact is 
that he would not and could not answer such a question. 
He would rather choose an ordinary constitutional 
procedure to explain how a war would be declared. 
Considering a remark like this is to be a `warning\' to 
Taiwan is sheer overreaction.\" 
 
B) \"Chen\'s Pledges Must Go\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taipei Times\" 
editorialized (1/3/05): 
 
\". In this sense we cannot but be disappointed - once 
again- with President Chen Shui-bian\'s New Year\'s 
address.  All we had was a rather empty warning to 
China `not to underestimate the will of the Taiwanese 
people.\'  Since China believes that the Taiwanese 
people have no will and can be intimidated into voting 
for the pan-blues by Beijing\'s saber-rattling, Chen 
might as well not have bothered.  Once again Chen spoke 
about Taiwan\'s `olive branches.\'  What he might have 
pointed out is that these olive branches have simply 
been used as switches for giving Taiwan a good 
whipping. 
 
\"When are Chen and those around him ever going to 
realize that appeasement does not lead to security? 
When are they going to learn the lessons of Munich, 
which is that aggressive governments with plans for 
territorial expansion have to be challenged?  Enough of 
Taiwan playing Mr. Nice Guy.  It has got to the stage 
where the country is being endangered by the lack of a 
resolute strategy.  Of course, getting tough is going 
to annoy people in Beijing and Beijing\'s clients in the 
State Department in Washington, but that can\'t be 
helped.  China\'s latest move is too serious to be taken 
with the Panglossian stoicism that has characterized 
the last four years. . 
 
\"Taiwan has been intimidated by such nonsense for long 
enough.  For too long, it has tried to make room for 
the dubious concerns and often contemptible motives of 
others.  It must now look after its own interests.  The 
speech in which Chen made his pledges was called 
`Taiwan Stands up.\' Well it certainly didn\'t then.  It 
is about time it did.\"

SUBJECT: TAIWAN: 2005 NATIONAL TRADE ESTIMATE REPORT 
 
 
TRADE SUMMARY 
------------- 
 
1.  The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan was $14.2 billion in 
2003, up $385 million from 2002.  U.S. goods exports during 
the same period were $ 17.4 billion, down 5.1 percent from 
the previous year.  Corresponding U.S. imports from Taiwan 
were $31.6 billion, down 1.7 percent.  Taiwan is the 9th 
largest export market for U.S. goods and 6th largest market 
for agricultural products. 
 
2.  U.S. exports of private commercial services (i.e., 
excluding military and government) to Taiwan were $4.8 
billion in 2002 (latest data available), and U.S. imports 
were $5 billion.  The stock of U.S. foreign direct 
investment (FDI) in Taiwan in 2003 was $ 11 billion, up from 
$ 10.1 billion in 2002.  U.S. FDI in Taiwan is concentrated 
largely in the finance, manufacturing, and wholesale 
sectors. 
 
OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
3.  Taiwan experienced an economic boom in 2004, prompting 
its estimated real GDP growth to post a seven-year high of 
nearly six percent.  However, excess inventory, higher oil 
prices and a steady increase in interest rates dampened 
Taiwan\'s major export markets and contributed to a slowdown 
in Taiwan\'s economic expansion in the second half of 2004. 
Taiwan\'s real GDP growth is expected to decline from 7.3 
percent in the first half of 2004 to 4.7 percent in the 
second half and further down to 4.5 percent in 2005.  Export 
growth declined steadily from 29 percent in the second 
quarter to 21 percent in the third quarter and 17.5 percent 
in October 2004.  Meanwhile, industrial growth dropped from 
15 percent in the second quarter to 8.6 percent in the third 
quarter and merely three percent in October.  A chronic 
trade surplus has enabled Taiwan to hold the third largest 
foreign exchange reserves of US$235 billion and made Taiwan 
a net capital supplier to the world.  Taiwan is one of the 
major sources of foreign direct investment in China. 
Financial reforms adopted in late 2001 prompted local banks 
to write off NT$1.3 trillion of bad debt, cutting the 
average ratio of non-performing loans (overdue for over 
three months) from nearly 12 percent in early 2002 to 4.5 
percent in October 2004. 
 
IMPORT POLICIES 
--------------- 
 
TARIFFS 
------- 
 
4.  Taiwan promulgated a comprehensive tariff revision 
schedule on January 1, 2004 in compliance with Taiwan\'s Free 
Trade Agreement with Panama, and Taiwan\'s accession 
commitments to the WTO.  Tariffs on pharmaceuticals, 
pulp/paper, iron/steel, construction equipment, agricultural 
equipment, medical equipment, furniture and toys were 
eliminated starting on January 1, 2004.  As a result, the 
average nominal tariff rate on imported goods in 2004 was 
approximately 5.7 percent and is expected to fall to 5.5 
percent by 2007.  However, U.S. industry continues to 
request that Taiwan lower tariffs on imports of large 
motorcycles, wine, canned soup, biscuits, cookies, snack 
foods, mixed vegetable juices, potato and potato products, 
table grapes, apples, citrus products and polylactic acid, 
which is used to make recyclable plastics. 
 
5.  Upon Taiwan\'s accession to the WTO in January 2002, 
Taiwan implemented a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) system on small 
passenger cars, three categories of fish and fish products, 
and a number of agricultural products.  On January 1, 2004, 
in accordance with its WTO accession commitments, Taiwan 
made additional tariff cuts and increased TRQ amounts on 
these products. Some items of interest to U.S. exporters, 
including chicken meat, pork belly, and poultry and pork 
variety meats, will be fully liberalized in 2005.  In May 
2004, Taiwan increased TRQ on sugar from 205,000 tons to 
255,000 tons to meet Taiwan\'s domestic market shortage. 
 
6.  Taiwan has notified the WTO that it maintains Special 
Safeguards (SSGs) for a number of agricultural products 
covered by TRQs.  SSGs, permitted under Article 5 of the 
Agreement on Agriculture, allow Taiwan to impose additional 
duties when import quantities exceed SSG trigger volumes or 
import prices fall below SSG trigger prices.  As Taiwan has 
not imported many of these products previously, SSG trigger 
volumes are relatively low.  SSGs will also come into play 
once imports of certain commodities are fully liberalized in 
2005 and will likely have the greatest effect on U.S. 
poultry exports.  The United States has raised concerns over 
Taiwan\'s use of SSGs in both Taipei and Geneva. 
 
Licensing and Other Restrictions 
-------------------------------- 
 
7.  In order to comply with its WTO commitments, Taiwan 
eliminated import controls on over 99 percent of 10,912 
official import product categories.  Currently, 24 product 
categories require import permits from the Board of Foreign 
Trade.  Imports of 65 categories are \"restricted\", including 
ammunition and some agricultural products.  These items can 
only be imported under special circumstances, and their 
importation is effectively banned. 
 
8.  Agricultural and Fish Products: Prior to WTO accession, 
Taiwan banned or restricted imports of 42 agricultural and 
fish items. In January 2002, Taiwan liberalized imports of 
18 of these agricultural and fish categories and implemented 
TRQs on the remaining 24 items. TRQs on a number of products 
of interest to the United States (chicken meat, pork belly 
and offal, and poultry offal) will be eliminated on January 
1, 2005 when trade is fully liberalized. 
 
9.  Rice: Before Taiwan\'s WTO accession, imports of rice 
were banned. During 2002, rice imports were subject to a 
minimum market access quota that covered both public- and 
private sector imports. In 2003, Taiwan changed its rice 
import regime from a minimum market access quota to a tariff- 
rate quota without consultation with its trade partners.  As 
a result, in January 2003 the United States, as well as 
Australia and Thailand, formally objected to Taiwan\'s 
proposed rice import system at the WTO. Since then, the 
United States has also raised concerns regarding Taiwan 
implementation of its rice import system, including 
cancellation of mark-up price reductions for several private 
sector tenders, and the use of a \"ceiling price\" for public 
sector tenders. Despite these difficulties, U.S. suppliers 
were able to gain a majority of the rice import market in 
2002 and 2003. In 2004, Taiwan\'s implementation of its 
import commitments improved significantly, allowing the 
United States to secure the largest import market share.  At 
the same time, both sides made substantial progress in 
resolving outstanding bilateral differences in 2004, paving 
the way for final resolution of the issue. 
 
10.  Tobacco and Alcohol Products: As a condition of 
Taiwan\'s WTO accession, a new tobacco and alcohol management 
and tax system went into effect on January 1, 2002.  In 
place of the previous tax on imports administered by the 
former monopoly authority, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine 
Monopoly Bureau (TTWMB), Taiwan agreed to impose an excise 
tax and to eliminate tariffs on imports of most spirits.  In 
2003, some legislators proposed lower excise taxes on salt- 
added cooking wine, contrary to Taiwan\'s WTO commitments, 
but these legislators failed. 
 
11.  Taiwan also liberalized private alcohol production upon 
its accession to the WTO and private cigarette manufacturing 
in 2004.  TTWMB became a state-owned corporation, Taiwan 
Tobacco and Liquor Corporation (TTLC), in July 2002. 
However, primarily due to resistance by organized labor, the 
privatization of the TTLC has been postponed until 2005. 
 
12.  Wood Products: Taiwan has revised building codes in 
line with international practices. However, Taiwan has not 
yet completed a companion fire code. This delay means that 
while a wood frame structure may be built, approval by fire 
inspection authorities is contingent on review and comment 
by a special committee on details, such as design and usage. 
U.S. wood products companies have raised concerns that this 
practice is restrictive and does not encourage wood use in 
construction. The continued use of a special committee 
unnecessarily delays construction of wood structures and 
raises the cost of using wood materials significantly beyond 
that of other materials such as concrete and steel. 
 
13.  Automobiles and Motorcycles: Local content requirements 
in the automobile and motorcycle industries were lifted as 
part of Taiwan\'s WTO accession.  The importation of 
motorcycles with engines larger than 150 cc was liberalized 
in July 2002 as part of Taiwan\'s WTO commitments. In mid- 
2003 Taiwan agreed to set emissions standards for 
motorcycles over 700 cc in line with international 
standards, a step that the U.S. motorcycle industry 
supported.  The U.S. Government remains concerned with 
Taiwan\'s tariffs and other taxes on large motorcycles as 
well as Taiwan\'s restrictions on motorcycle access to 
highways. 
STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING AND CERTIFICATION 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
14.  Industrial and Home Appliance Products: Industrial and 
home appliance products (such as air-conditioning and 
refrigeration equipment) are subject to safety and 
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing requirements 
before clearing customs.  The manufacturers or importers can 
choose tests on each shipment \"batch-by-batch inspection\" 
(BBI) with Type Approval or apply \"registration of product 
certification (RPC)\".  All safety testing for end products 
must be done in Taiwan by-Taiwan accredited laboratories. 
Taiwan accepts EMC testing by NIST accredited laboratories 
if they are in the U.S. only for IT equipment based on the 
1999 EMC Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) signed between 
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taipei 
Economic and Cultural Representatives Office (TECRO) in the 
United States.  For those products that adhere to the ISO 
9000 quality management system, an alternative factory 
inspection module was introduced.  The manufacturers or 
importers may choose the module most appropriate to them 
when applying for registration under the RPC scheme. 
 
15.  Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures: As a member of the 
WTO, Taiwan must abide by the WTO Agreement on the 
Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 
(including notification of such measures). In 1998, Taiwan 
agreed to accept meat and poultry imports from plants 
approved by the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service. In 1999 
and 2000, Taiwan agreed to accept Codex Alimentarius or U.S. 
pesticide residue standards for some chemicals used on 
imported fruits and vegetables.  However, the United States 
continues to be concerned that some Taiwan plant and animal 
quarantine measures are not always based on sound science 
and are not the least trade-restrictive measures available. 
 
16.  Alcohol Beverage Products: On December 31, 2001, 
immediately before its WTO accession, Taiwan implemented new 
regulations requiring major ingredient labeling for alcohol 
beverages.  Although these regulations relate to 
international trade, the United States was not informed by 
Taiwan in advance of their implementation.  Bilateral 
meetings were conducted in 2002 to discuss this requirement 
and as a result, enforcement of the ingredient-labeling 
requirement was delayed until July 2003.  In December 2003, 
Taiwan\'s legislature passed the Tobacco and Alcohol 
Administrative Law (TAAL), which enabled the Ministry of 
Finance (MOF) to eliminate ingredient-labeling requirements 
for alcohol beverage products.  Beginning July 1, 2004, 
alcoholic beverage product labels do not need to include a 
list of ingredients. 
 
17.  Agricultural Biotechnology Products: Taiwan authorities 
generally have taken a cautious, but fairly rational 
approach to trade in agricultural biotechnology products. 
Risk assessment documentation on agricultural biotechnology 
corn and soybeans were required to be submitted to DOH 
before April 30, 2002, and mandatory labeling on certain 
corn and soybean products commenced in 2003. In October 
2003, DOH announced its intention to require registration of 
agricultural biotechnology products other than corn and 
soybeans in 2004, but offered an opportunity for life 
science companies to obtain interim approval for those 
products currently commercialized. No disruptions to trade 
have resulted from Taiwan\'s biotechnology regulations. 
However, with a number of products entering the regulatory 
approval pipeline and a lack of investment in a strong 
regulatory infrastructure, delays in approvals have become 
more frequent. 
 
18.  Labeling of Genetically Modified (GM) food:  Taiwan\'s 
bioengineered food safety approval and labeling regulation 
took effect on January 1, 2003.  Mandatory labeling of 
bioengineered food was phased in over a two-year period, 
beginning with certain soybean and corn products.  By 2005, 
the label will be required for all processed corn and 
soybean products.    Taiwan uses a 5 percent tolerance for 
bioengineered food labeling.  All food products containing 5 
percent or more bioengineered soybean or corn ingredients by 
weight must be labeled as \"Genetically Modified (GM)\" or 
\"Containing Genetically Modified\". 
 
19.  Medical Devices: Registration and approval procedures 
for medical device imports are complex and time-consuming, 
and have been the subject of long-standing complaints by 
U.S. firms.  The registration process requires redundant 
testing, and foreign manufacturers must re-register new 
products even though they are based on previously approved 
devices.  In addition, it is unclear when local clinical 
trials are required for the review process or whether 
industry is allowed to provide additional input in response 
to questions posed by DOH officials reviewing the clinical 
trial submissions.  The adoption of the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration\'s medical device classification system in 
June 2000 was welcomed by industry.  However, Taiwan\'s 
implementation of this system in 2004 was faulted by 
industry for requiring re-registration of previously 
approved products.  Taiwan has identified both the medical 
device and pharmaceutical sectors as priorities for local 
development, resulting in Taiwan\'s agencies often favoring 
the interests of local companies over foreign firms. 
 
20.  Pharmaceuticals: Taiwan\'s lengthy pharmaceutical 
registration process slows market entry for new drugs that 
have already been approved in other economies and also 
imposes unnecessary costs on drugs that have been approved 
in Taiwan.  In May 2001, the DOH announced a requirement for 
firms to submit voluminous amounts of proprietary 
manufacturing data as part of the registration and approval 
process for both new drugs and those already on the market. 
The amount of such \"validation\" data requested by Taiwan far 
exceeded international norms.  In response to concerns 
raised by the United States and its industry, the DOH had 
postponed implementation of this requirement.  In December 
2002, the United States and Taiwan exchanged letters in 
which Taiwan affirmed its commitment to adhere to 
international practices as applied in advanced economies, 
and agreed that firms can demonstrate validation status by 
providing documentary evidence, including abridged 
registration applications.  In August 2003, DOH and the U.S. 
industry reached agreement on validation data resolutions. 
However, DOH has announced plans to assign risk based 
\"priority numbers\" that will be used to determine which 
manufacturers are inspected by DOH.  US industry is 
concerned that these risk priority numbers are based on non- 
transparent criteria and inspections will unfairly target 
manufacturers that provide abridged data.  Discussions 
between the United States and Taiwan to resolve remaining 
issues are ongoing. 
 
21.  Taiwan uses various methods to lower assigned prices on 
innovative drugs, including \"reference pricing\" (assigning a 
lower price when a drug is approved for an additional use) 
and lowering assigned prices without a transparent process. 
In addition, Taiwan continues to restrict consumer choice 
and limit U.S. market access through disproportionate 
reimbursement of domestically manufactured generic drugs. 
To address these outstanding concerns of foreign 
pharmaceutical firms, Taiwan announced a reimbursement- 
pricing plan in March 2003.  In this plan, the DOH and the 
Bureau of National Health Insurance agreed to find ways to 
include a \"reward for innovation\" component in its pricing 
mechanism for new drugs.  However, industry representatives 
have criticized the new drug pricing mechanism as non- 
transparent and believe the reimbursement prices will not 
achieve the stated objective.  Discussions between the 
United States and Taiwan on this issue are ongoing. 
 
22.  In July 2002, Taiwan introduced a \"global budget\" 
system in which hospitals receive lump sums from the 
National Health Insurance system to cover the cost of 
providing all services.  The goal is to increase efficiency 
and encourage cost-cutting measures, but critics contend 
that the global budget system primarily encourages hospitals 
to seek discounts on pharmaceuticals in order to make up for 
losses in providing medical services.  In addition, critics 
say the system discourages use of innovative drugs. 
 
23.  Other issues: Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef in 
December 2003 with the detection of one positive case of 
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in the State of 
Washington.  As of the publication of this report, the U.S. 
government is taking aggressive action and is working 
intensively to re-open the market as quickly as possible. 
Non-ruminant products for feed use, such as tallow, lard, 
poultry and porcine meal are banned with few exceptions that 
are only approved after a very slow case-by-case review or 
plant clearance process.  A few products such as bovine 
serum and pet food are allowed entry. 
GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT 
---------------------- 
 
24.  Taiwan committed to accede to the WTO Agreement on 
Government Procurement (GPA) as part of its WTO accession. 
While Taiwan has applied for accession to the GPA, its 
accession has not yet been completed due to differences 
regarding nomenclature issues.  To prepare for accession, 
Taiwan implemented a new Government Procurement Law in mid- 
1999.  This was an important first step toward establishing 
a transparent and predictable environment for Taiwan\'s multi- 
billion dollar market for public procurement projects.  In 
August 2001, Taiwan and the United States signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding on Government Procurement.  The 
MOU calls for Taiwan to implement certain procedural 
commitments immediately, while others will be implemented 
upon accession to the GPA.  Taiwan agreed to establish new 
procedures providing for the independent review of 
complaints that arise during the tendering process, to 
encourage its procuring entities to make use of mediation 
procedures, and to cooperate fully when such procedures are 
invoked.  Despite these commitments, Taiwan officials have 
continued to incorporate provisions in its public 
procurement tenders that appear to be inconsistent with the 
GPA, although Taiwan is not yet a party to that agreement. 
Further, the lack of transparency in the government 
procurement process as well as the review process for 
complaints remains a serious issue.  U.S. participation in 
Taiwan\'s government procurement market continues to decline 
as a result of these practices.  The United States continues 
to remain concerned with the government procurement 
environment. 
 
EXPORT SUBSIDIES 
---------------- 
 
25.  The Taiwan Government provides incentives to industrial 
firms in export processing zones and to firms in designated 
\"emerging industries.\"  Some of these programs may have the 
effect of subsidizing exports.  Taiwan has notified the WTO 
of these programs and, as part of its WTO accession, 
committed to amend or abolish any subsidy programs 
inconsistent with WTO rules. Amendments of relevant laws, 
such as the Statute for Establishment and Management of 
Economic Processing Zones and the Statute for Establishment 
of Scientific Industrial Parks, to eliminate improper 
subsidies, went into effect upon Taiwan\'s WTO accession. 
The United States continues to monitor Taiwan\'s compliance 
with the commitments it undertook as part of its WTO 
accession, including those obligations associated with the 
Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures 
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
26.  IPR protection continues to be an important and serious 
issue in the US/Taiwan trade relationship.  In 2004, Taiwan 
continued to take measures to improve enforcement of IPR, 
including stepping up raids against manufacturing and retail 
outlets, legalizing previously ad hoc task forces, and 
passing important revisions to the copyright law that 
increase penalties for counterfeiters.  The U.S. 
International Intellectual Property Alliance estimates that 
Taiwan\'s IPR infringements caused trade losses to the United 
States of USD464 million in 2003.  Despite several large 
raids against manufacturers and passage of amendments 
strengthening the pharmaceutical law, the U.S. Government 
continues to be concerned with the prevalence of 
counterfeits in the Taiwan pharmaceutical market and the 
lack of adequate data protection for innovative 
pharmaceuticals.  U.S. industry has complained about delays 
in court cases and the difficulty Taiwan\'s judiciary has in 
handling technical cases.  In April 2004, Taiwan was placed 
on the U.S. Special 301 Priority Watch List for the fourth 
year in a row, but was -given an out of cycle review at the 
end of 2004. 
27.  To improve Taiwan\'s ability to protect IPR, the 
government formulated a three-year (2003-2005) IPR Action 
plan.  Measures included the establishment of the Integrated 
Enforcement Task Force (IETF) with a force of 220 police 
officers in January 2003; opening of three warehouses for 
counterfeiting seizures; the raising of the informant reward 
to up to NT$10 million per counterfeiting seizure; 
strengthening of border control inspection for CD exports; 
and increasing day/night inspection on disc plants, night 
markets, and retail shops selling optical media.  Taiwan\'s 
counterfeit goods seized by the U.S. Customs dropped from 
US$26.5 million in FY2002 to US$610,000 in FY2003, and to 
US$60,000 in the first half of FY 2004.  The Business 
Software Alliance (BSA) also announced that software piracy 
rate in Taiwan fell from 54 percent in 2002 to 43 percent in 
2003. 
 
28.  Amendments to the Copyright Law passed by the 
Legislative Yuan in June 2003 lifted the requirement that 
rights-holders file a complaint before police can conduct 
enforcement actions.  But provisions to allow ex officio 
seizure by Customs officials and prohibiting the 
circumvention of technical protection measures were 
eliminated and minimum sentences were repealed.  In 
addition, provisions to address Internet piracy were removed 
from the final bill.  After concerted lobbying by industry 
and the Taiwan Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan in 
August 2004 passed additional amendments to the Copyright 
Law including a) technological protection measures, b) 
heavier penalty for infringement, and c) giving Customs the 
authority to take ex officio action. 
 
29.  Internet piracy and illegal peer-to-peer downloading 
are becoming serious concerns for IP enforcement in Taiwan. 
Infringers are using the Internet to market illegal goods 
and illegally download music, movies, and software from 
indicted peer-to-peer Internet service providers (ISC). 
Efforts to use the legal system to shut down or restrict the 
activities of P2P platforms has met with limited success 
thus far. 
 
30.  In response to U.S. and industry requests to improve 
protection of optical media products and curtail the illegal 
manufacture of such goods, Taiwan passed an optical media 
law on October 31, 2001.  Manufacturers must apply for 
production licenses and report any changes to the 
authorities.  Violators face a maximum three-year jail 
sentence and a fine of approximately $86,000.  The law was 
fully implemented effective May 2002.  The Optical Media Law 
and IETF\'s night/day inspection has led to a dramatic 
decrease in large-scale factory production of counterfeit CD 
products produced by CD plants. 
 
31.  The U.S. Government also is concerned with the growing 
incidence of counterfeit pharmaceutical products in the 
Taiwan market and the lack of adequate data protection for 
these products.  The Taiwan government in March 2004 revised 
the pharmaceutical affairs law to increase penalties for 
pharmaceutical counterfeiting.  Nevertheless, counterfeit 
products continue to pose a threat to public health and 
Taiwan\'s Department of Health enforcement mechanism is not 
strong. Although a bill is pending in the Legislative Yuan, 
Taiwan has not yet fully provided data exclusivity for 
pharmaceutical products, a TRIPS commitment and a 
disincentive for pharmaceutical producers to introduce new 
products into the Taiwan market. 
 
32.  The lack of adequate protection for the packaging, 
configuration, and outward appearance of products, an area 
of IPR known as \"trade dress,\" is another area of concern. 
Despite provisions in Taiwan\'s Fair Trade law designed to 
protect unregistered marks and other packaging features, 
misleading copying of U.S. products by local manufacturers 
remains a problem. 
 
33.  Taiwan\'s judiciary continues to experience difficulties 
in handling technical cases, and U.S. industry has 
complained about long delays in court cases.  Often 
conflicting or unclear lines of bureaucratic authority 
stymie IPR enforcement efforts.  Generally, U.S. IPR holders 
find that judges and court procedures themselves constitute 
barriers and that penalties for intellectual property 
violations are inadequate to deter violators.  The United 
States continues to assist in remedying the weaknesses of 
the judicial system by holding seminars on criminal 
enforcement and encourages Taiwan to set up IP courts with 
experienced judges to handle the case. 
 
SERVICES BARRIERS 
----------------- 
 
Financial Services 
------------------ 
 
34.  Taiwan continues to liberalize its financial market 
beyond its WTO accession commitments.  In January 2001, the 
Securities and Futures Exchange Commission (SFEC) lifted the 
restriction on employment of foreigners by domestic Taiwan 
securities firms.  Also in January 2001, the SFEC removed 
the 50-percent foreign ownership limit on listed companies. 
In June 2003, the SFEC phased out a minimum two-year period 
for foreign holders of global depository receipts (GDRs) to 
exchange GDR for equity stocks after the GDR is issued.  In 
July 2003, the SFEC lifted the ceiling limit of US$3 billion 
on inward remittances by a qualified foreign institutional 
investor (QFII).  It also abolished the requirement for a 
QFII to inwardly remit its investment fund within two years 
after it receives approval.  In early October 2003, the 
Taiwan government voluntarily abolished the QFII system. 
Foreign portfolio investors are required to complete 
registration rather than seek advance approval, and as of 
December 2003, the registration could be done on the 
Internet.  In late 2003, Taiwan allowed foreign portfolio 
investors to trade in the futures and money markets as a 
part of financial management prior to actual portfolio 
investment.  However, futures, money market funds and bank 
deposits are subject to a limit of 30 percent of total 
inward remittances.  All offshore foreign portfolio 
investors may trade in Taiwan\'s stock market regardless of 
their size, except for investment by hedge funds and 
investors from the PRC.  However, foreign individual 
investors are still subject to an investment limit.  Onshore 
foreign individuals and institutional investors are also 
subject to annual inward/outward limits. 
 
35.  Taiwan continues to work towards fulfilling its May 
1997 commitment to liberalize insurance premium rates and 
policy clauses.  It voluntarily opened the reinsurance 
market.  In November 2001, Taiwan permitted life insurance 
companies to sell investment-linked products.  Taiwan began 
to allow life insurance companies to set their own premium 
rates in January 2002 if the companies had their own 
actuaries to determine such rates.  Taiwan adopted a three- 
stage premium rate liberalization program for non-life 
insurance.  Effective January 1, 2002, insurance firms were 
allowed to set premium rates for large face-value fire 
insurance policies and fire insurance policies sold to 
multinational corporations.  The target date for total 
liberalization is January 2008, but the liberalization date 
for an individual insurance firm can be advanced if it has a 
good credit reputation and its capital adequacy ratio 
reaches 300 percent. 
 
36.  Taiwan adopted a transparent approval procedure for 
insurance policies in January 2001.  Prior approval is not 
required for products whose policy clauses are identical or 
very similar to existing products of other companies.  New 
products are subject to prior approval.  Taiwan\'s Insurance 
Bureau will adopt a negative list system in January 2005. 
Under the new system, new products subject to prior approval 
will be deeply cut, down from 50 percent to 25-30 percent 
for life insurance and to 10-20 percent for non-life 
insurance.  The processing time will be cut from 90 days to 
75 days for life insurance and 60 days for non-life 
insurance.  The Department of Insurance has opened its 
reinsurance market, and the Central Reinsurance Corporation 
Statute was revoked in June 2004.  The Central Reinsurance 
Corporation, the only reinsurance firm in Taiwan, was 
privatized in July 2002.  In August 2002, the DOI lowered 
the capital requirement for entering the reinsurance market, 
strongly in favor of foreign reinsurance firms over domestic 
competitors.  In response to the liberalization, the Swiss 
Reinsurance Co. became the first foreign reinsurance firm to 
set up a branch in Taiwan in early 2004. 
 
LEGAL SERVICES 
-------------- 
 
37.  Following Taiwan\'s accession to the WTO, foreign 
lawyers are permitted to practice law in Taiwan either by 
setting up individual practices (single lawyer) or entering 
into partnerships with local counterparts.  In order to 
practice domestic law, foreign lawyers must pass the local 
bar examination and use the Chinese language when appearing 
before the court or submitting written briefs.  If the 
foreigner does not meet these qualifications, local lawyers 
working for, or in cooperation with, the foreign lawyer may 
represent the foreign lawyer\'s interests on domestic law 
issues.  When practicing international or foreign law, 
foreign lawyers do not need to pass the language or bar 
examinations and are not required to hire or partner with 
local lawyers. 
 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES 
--------------------------- 
 
38.  Following the issuance of licenses to three fixed-line 
telecommunications service providers in 2000, the 
Directorate General of Telecommunications\' (DGT) again 
opened applications for integrated network licenses in 
September 2004.  The capital requirement for integrated 
network service was reduced to NT$16 billion from NT$40 
billion and system capacity requirements were lowered from 
one million to 400,000 subscribers\' lines.  However, the 
September\'s open season failed to generate any bids.  DGT 
also announced in September 2004 that it would launch a 
biannual licensing schedule in March and September beginning 
this fall.  According to DGT\'s plan, local, long-distance 
and international call businesses will be added to the 
licensing schedule under less restrictive conditions in 
March 2005.  A new formula based on local population will be 
used to calculate the capital requirements for each of the 
new service license.  As low as NT$1.2 billion may be 
required for a local call license in Taipei City and NT$2 
billion for long-distance and international service 
licenses. 
 
39.  Existing fixed-line operators still face serious 
difficulties in negotiating reasonable interconnection 
arrangements at technically feasible points in the network 
of the dominant carrier, Chunghwa Telecom (CHT).  Despite 
its announcement in May 2004 to share the local loop with 
the three private providers, CHT set two limitations.  A 
change to allow non-CHT service providers access to CHT\'s 
local loop can only be initiated by end users.  Only voice 
service in three metropolitan areas is open to non-CHT 
operators.  The Premier announced in November 2003 that the 
government would invest a total of NT$35 billion in the next 
five years to help local governments resolve \"last mile\" 
problems for telecommunications end-users.  This \"Mobile 
Taiwan\" plan will also include the construction of a second 
broadband network around Taiwan to be jointly used by 
telecommunications service companies.  These new investment 
projects are expected to help break the monopoly of the 
telecommunications network by state-owned CHT.  Taiwan\'s 
telecommunications regulatory body, DGT and the state-owned 
former monopoly CHT are under the purview of the MOTC, 
creating a potential conflict of interest.  DGT lacks the 
full authority, independence, and resources to effectively 
resolve telecommunications-related disputes.  Two draft 
laws, \"Communications and Broadcasting Basic Law\" and the 
statute for the organization of the proposed Cabinet-level 
\"National Communications and Broadcasting Commission (NCC)\", 
have been introduced by the Cabinet.  The Basic Law was 
passed in December 2003 and the reorganizing statue is 
currently pending in the legislative process.  The NCC will 
be an independent regulatory body that will unify regulatory 
authority now split between DGT for wired or wireless 
communications and the Government Information Office for 
radio and television broadcasting. 
 
40.  Taiwan\'s telecommunications market is transforming.  In 
June 2003 the DGT announced regulations governing equal 
access service, allowing Type I subscribers to select the 
long distance and international network service of other 
providers.  In August 2003 the DGT amended regulations to 
open Taiwan\'s mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) market 
and began licensing in September 2003.  The MVNO opening 
offers an alternative third-generation (3G) wireless service 
to local consumers and allows service providers to operate 
without a 3G license by partnering with existing 3G 
operators.  In November 2003 the DGT announced the 
regulations governing number portability service, enabling 
subscribers to retain their existing telephone numbers when 
switching from their original Type I enterprise to another 
Type I enterprise engaging in the same business.  Actual 
implementation of the number portability service is likely 
to be postponed from January to December 2005 due to delay 
by an industrial alliance in completing a central database. 
In November 2004 DGT began to solicit comments for a 
proposal to facilitate development in the voice over 
Internet protocol (VoIP) services.  DGT plans to adopt the 
E. 164 numbering plan and help safeguard the 
interconnectivity between VoIP providers and fixed-line 
operators as given by the Telecom Act, but has not finalized 
the interconnectivity between VoIP providers.  Legislative 
amendment to the Telecom Act would be required for 
compulsory interconnectivity between VoIP providers. 
Supported by the central government\'s \"Mobile Taiwan\" plan 
toward a wireless island, the three metropolitan areas have 
seen progress in the wireless network infrastructure in 
2004.  Taichung City currently leads Taipei City and 
Kaohsiung City in reaching the goal of 80 percent coverage. 
International submarine cable firms remain limited to only 
one gateway for their links from the cable-landing site to 
network providers while they are permitted to build their 
own backhaul facilities. 
 
41.  Taiwan\'s telecommunications market saw a merger of KG 
Telecom and Far EasTone in October 2003.  The merger has 
created a mobile service market equally divided between Far 
EasTone, CHT and Taiwan Cellular.  The United States 
continues to monitor Taiwan\'s progress in the 
telecommunications sector. 
 
INVESTMENT BARRIERS 
------------------- 
 
42.  Taiwan continues to relax investment restrictions in a 
host of areas, but foreign investment remains prohibited in 
a handful of industries such as agriculture, wireless 
broadcasting, oil exploration of Taiwan\'s coastal area, 
public utilities, and postal services.  Foreign investors in 
the telecommunications sector are subject to a 60 percent 
ownership limit, with the limit on direct foreign investment 
raised from 20 percent to 49 percent in 2002.  In February 
2003, Taiwan lifted its ban on foreign investment in liquor 
production, though prior approval is required.  Similarly, 
in January 2004, foreign investment restrictions on 
cigarette production were removed, though prior approval is 
required.  Foreign ownership in airlines is limited to 33 
percent.  The 50 percent foreign ownership limit on air 
cargo forwarders and air cargo terminals was eliminated when 
Taiwan became a WTO member.  Foreign ownership on power 
plants has been removed, while foreign investment in 
electricity transmission and distribution remains subject to 
a 50 percent ownership limit and approval by the Executive 
Yuan.  Imports of gasoline and liquid natural gas were 
opened to the private sector in January 2002.  In October 
2003, Taiwan set a foreign ownership limit of 49 percent on 
high-speed railway transportation. 
 
ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES 
------------------------- 
 
43.  In the cable TV market, U.S. program providers contend 
that the island\'s two dominant multi-system operators (MSOs) 
frequently collude to inhibit fair competition.  Control by 
the two MSOs of upstream program distribution deterred U.S. 
program providers from negotiating reasonable program fees. 
In December 2003, Taiwan\'s legislature passed a new 
broadcasting law combining the Radio and Television 
Broadcasting Law, the Cable Television Broadcasting Law, and 
the Satellite Television Broadcasting Law.  Following the 
legislative passage of the law, Taiwan officials are working 
to eliminate political interference in the television 
broadcasting industry by monitoring public releases of state- 
owned and party-owned stocks. 
 
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 
------------------- 
 
44.  Taiwan\'s approach to e-commerce and related issues is 
still evolving.  A law protecting personal on-line data was 
approved in 2001.  The Electronic Signature Law, passed by 
the Legislative Yuan in late October 2001, adopts the 
principles of the United Nations Commission on International 
Trade Law\'s Model Law on Electronic Commerce and recognizes 
the legal validity of electronic contracts, records, and 
signatures.  Still under discussion is a proposal to assess 
duties for software sold and downloaded over the Internet. 
If implemented, such a policy would appear to run counter to 
the Doha Declaration that WTO Members would maintain their 
current practice of not imposing customs duties on 
electronic transmissions.  Taiwan has refused to join the US 
at APEC in advocating for a permanent moratorium on taxation 
of Internet transactions.

POST-ELECTION LANDSCAPE: DPP Down But Not Out 
 
1. (C) Summary:  In the December legislative elections in 
Taiwan, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) gained both 
seats and vote share and remains the largest party in the 
Legislative Yuan (LY).  Nonetheless, almost all media 
accounts described it as a \"defeat\" for the DPP, and almost 
all sides of the political spectrum here have done the same. 
If there was a DPP \"defeat,\" it can be ascribed to a 
combination of exaggerated expectations and poor tactics. 
Conversely, Kuomintang (KMT) success in maintaining a slender 
Pan-Blue majority was largely due to its tactical and 
organizational success.  Chen Shui-bian\'s attempt to energize 
voters with his controversial rhetoric failed to win votes, 
but it did make him the issue and consequently made what 
might have been a tactical setback into a national issue. If 
nothing else, this election surprised all observers because 
it broke a string of three successive DPP electoral 
successes, two presidential and one legislative. While the 
DPP may be perceived to have lost the election, it retains 
the initiative over its opponents. Chen continues to dominate 
both Taiwan,s domestic and cross-Strait Agenda, and that may 
mean continued domestic gridlock and cross-Strait tension. 
End Summary. 
 
 
Proclaiming Defeat 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) Both local and International press coverage of 
Taiwan\'s LY election immediately proclaimed that the election 
was a defeat for the DPP and a rejection of President Chen 
Shui-bian. Both the Green and the Blue camps publicly 
delivered the same message. On the evening of the election, 
President Chen somberly announced that he was resigning as 
DPP Chairman to show that he accepted responsibility for the 
DPP falling short of his forecasts. The party Secretary 
General Chang Jun-hsiung and Deputy Secretary General Lee 
Ying-yuan promptly submitted their resignations as well.  KMT 
Chairman Lien Chan reveled in his first election victory, and 
LY President Wang Jin-pyng immediately began talking about 
what the Pan-Blue agenda for the next three years would look 
like. At a post-election conference in Taipei, however, Dr. 
Shelley Rigger, a US scholar of Taiwanese politics, cautioned 
that depictions of the LY election outcome as \"a defeat for 
the DPP and a popular rejection of President Chen\'s moves 
toward independence\"  were \"too simple.\"  Dr. Lo Chih-cheng, 
Executive Director of the Institute for National Policy 
Research agreed with Dr. Rigger, saying, \"The results of the 
election should not be overstated.  This was not necessarily 
a \'defeat\' for the Pan-Green camp.\" 
 
DPP Made Gains, But \"Set the Bar Too High\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Numerically, at least, it is difficult to characterize 
the DPP as a loser in this election.  The DPP once again took 
more seats and a greater share of the vote than any other 
party, expanding its position in the LY by two seats.  Its 
share of the vote was the highest in any legislative 
election, continuing its steady growth trend over the last 
three elections, from 29.6 percent in 1998 to 33.4 percent in 
2001 to 35.7 percent in 2004.  The perception that the DPP 
\"lost\" the election was not a product of vote count, 
Academica Sinica election researcher Hsu Yung-ming told AIT, 
but rather a failure of expectations: \"They set the bar too 
high,\" he explained.  Likewise, the Pan-Blue\'s perceived 
success in this election, despite losing seats and vote share 
compared to 2001, was a matter of beating everybody\'s 
excessively pessimistic predictions. 
 
 
Strategy and Tactics Matter 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The DPP\'s high expectations affected more than just 
the way the outcome was perceived, it likely affected the 
outcome itself.  DPP over-optimism caused it to nominate too 
many candidates which distributed the DPP vote too thinly in 
some districts (see Ref A for a more detailed explanation of 
the importance of vote distribution in Taiwan\'s single 
non-transferable vote multi-member district electoral 
system).  In Taoyuan County, for example, the DPP took five 
of twelve seats in 2001, but won only four of (now) thirteen 
seats this year.  The reason was not a fall in support -- DPP 
vote share this year (34.2 percent) was virtually unchanged 
from 2001 (33.4 percent) -- but rather that the DPP nominated 
six in 2001 and seven this year, spreading its votes too 
thinly.  The three DPP candidates who lost received about 
30,000 votes each, just shy of the 32,000 vote threshold of 
victory.  Had the DPP stayed with six nominees, it would have 
almost certainly kept its five seats and very likely taken a 
sixth.  Similar over-nomination probably cost the DPP one 
seat each in Taichung and Changhua Counties and in Taipei 
City. 
 
5. (C) Conversely, the KMT\'s unexpected success on December 
11 can be partially attributed to its conservative nomination 
strategy stemming from its memory of its losses in 2001. 
Whereas in 2001 the KMT heavily overnominated, enabling only 
53 of its 97 district candidates to win, this year the KMT 
nominated only 74 candidates, of whom 61 won seats in the LY. 
 
LY Politics: Almost Everything is Local... 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The contrasting nomination strategies led to 
contrasting slates of candidates. Most KMT candidates were 
veteran politicians, often incumbents with large support 
networks of their own.  The DPP, in contrast, ran slates 
packed with newcomers, in an effort to cultivate new leaders 
and replace the many veteran legislators who now encumber 
senior government positions. Local DPP campaign headquarters 
that supported these newcomers, moreover, often consisted of 
little more than a handful of volunteers in small, 
rudimentary, rented offices.  In this election, Hsu argued, 
the KMT was able to utilize its local organizational 
advantage to mobilize supporters behind its candidates in a 
way the DPP was unable to match. The widely rumored impact of 
DPP targeted distribution of government largesse does not 
seem to have swung the balance as some had expected. 
 
... National Issues Misfire 
--------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Chen Shui-bian attempted to run a national campaign 
for a \"Pan-Green majority\" that he hoped would mobilize the 
50.11 percent of voters who had supported him in the March 
2004 Presidential election and discourage pro-independence 
DPP voters from defecting to the more fundamentalist Taiwan 
Solidarity Union (TSU).  At campaign rallies around the 
island, he emphasized the issues of \"Taiwan identity\" and 
\"national sovereignty\" that had galvanized his supporters in 
March.  This Chen-led campaign strategy may have contributed 
to the poor TSU showing, but it may also have scared off 
middle-of-the-road voters, whom some DPP strategists insist 
are crucial to the DPP,s long-term goal of becoming the 
majority party. Some in the Pan-Blue camp have seized on 
Chen,s failure in order to characterize the election as a 
popular rejection of Chen and his policies, and have called 
for a greater Pan-Blue role in forming the government (Ref 
B).  Moderates in the New Tide faction of the DPP have also 
criticized Chen\'s risky campaign rhetoric in an attempt to 
steer the party toward their positions and to increase the 
faction\'s leverage in formation of the new government (Ref 
C).  They argue Chen\'s move to dominate the electin resulted 
in a depressed turnout that hurt the DPP without hurting the 
TSU. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
Centrists Sat Out the Election, But Didn\'t Swing Blue 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
8. (C) Yu Ching-hsin, Deputy Director of National Chengchi 
University\'s Election Study Center, cautioned against drawing 
hasty conclusions, stressing that \"this election had nothing 
to do with these (national) issues.\"  Despite the prominence 
given to Chen\'s rhetoric by the media, he explained, few LY 
candidates even mentioned issues of sovereignty or 
independence in their own campaigns, and most voters based 
their decision on local, not national, factors.  He dismissed 
speculation by some commentators that Chen\'s rhetoric had 
driven large numbers of nervous centrists to vote for 
Pan-Blue candidates.  Pan-Blue vote share was actually at an 
all-time low in this election, he noted, and all of the KMT\'s 
gains were at the expense of the People First Party (PFP), 
its Pan-Blue ally, rather than the DPP.  Pointing to the 
record low turnout (59%, compared with 81% in the March 2004 
presidential election and 66% in the 2001 LY election), Yu 
suggested that alienated centrist voters instead decided to 
sit out this election altogether.  \"On both sides, the only 
voters who came out were core supporters,\" he said.  Hsu 
Yung-ming offered a similar assessment, explaining that the 
DPP\'s failure to achieve its oft-repeated goal of attaining a 
Pan-Green legislative majority was due, not to any change in 
voter sentiment, but rather to its inability to effectively 
mobilize its own supporters.  He suggested that part of the 
reason for DPP voter apathy was, ironically, Chen\'s 
domination of the campaign agenda and media spotlight.  \"(KMT 
Chairman) Lien Chan never appeared on TV,\" he explained, \"so 
there was nothing to get them (DPP voters) riled up.\" 
 
 
Reversing Expectations 
---------------------- 
 
9. (C) If the DPP numbers were up, why is everyone convinced 
that the DPP lost? President Chen may be largely to blame. 
Beginning immediately after March 20, he made this 
legislative election into the second half of the presidential 
election, calling on his supporters to give him a working 
majority in the LY so that he could push his program through 
the legislature. He reminded voters that the KMT had held 
both executive and legislative power for fifty years and 
called on them to give him three years of that power to show 
what the DPP could do. He then made himself the primary DPP 
campaigner, dominating the media with his calls for 
Taiwanization and his predictions that the Pan-Green would in 
fact secure effective control of the LY.  KMT supporters 
during the LY campaign had persuaded themselves that they 
were about to lose. A variety of KMT candidates told AIT that 
they were de-emphasizing their party ties in their campaigns 
and discouraging Lien Chan from visiting their districts. 
Senior KMT politicians, like Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and 
Taoyuan Magistrate Eric Chu were openly discussing the 
long-term benefit to the KMT of its expected defeat. As a 
result, many observers and politicians were surprised by the 
Pan-Blue,s success in holding its ground in the LY. After 
triumphing in two presidential elections and one LY election, 
the DPP and the Pan-Green had stumbled. 
 
Don,t Underestimate the Counter Puncher 
--------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) While the DPP seems momentarily in disarray, and the 
KMT is still celebrating its victory, President Chen remains 
in control of Taiwan,s domestic and cross-Strait agenda. 
While his resignation from the DPP Chairmanship and the 
anticipated resignation of Premier Yu Shyi-kun may both 
appear to acknowledge defeat, he appears to be turning these 
resignations into an opportunity to orchestrate competition 
for the DPP presidential nod in 2008, blessing the election 
of Presidential Office Secretary General Su Tseng-chang as 
new party chairman and perhaps Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh 
(Chang-ting) as the new premier.  When the PRC announced its 
plans to enact an anti-secession law, Chen quickly seized 
this as an opportunity to remind Taiwan that this was another 
example of mainland animosity toward Taiwan and its 
self-respect. Chen may have expressed humility and urged 
cross-party reconciliation and cooperation in his New Year\'s 
Day speech, but he also excoriated Mainland China for 
threatening Taiwan and regional stability. 
 
11. (C) In the waning days of the current LY session, the KMT 
had hoped to seize the initiative, but it finds itself once 
more fighting within the terms of the DPP agenda.  The ten 
major economic projects, the special budget for defense 
acquisitions, even proposals for Taiwan legislation on 
cross-Strait relations all play to DPP themes.  If these 
trends continue, President Chen and the DPP will emerge from 
the appearance of political defeat to continue to dominate 
Taiwan,s political landscape. If that proves true, President 
Chen may well decide to continue his accustomed 
confrontational and divisive approach, and the result may be 
continuing internal political deadlock and increased 
cross-Strait tension.

1. (C) Summary:  In his New Year\'s Speech, Chen Shui-bian 
called for reconciliation and cooperation between the ruling 
and opposition parties in order to stabilize domestic 
politics and promote cross-Strait peace.  Chen suggested that 
the Pan-Green and Pan-Blue start dialogue on the areas on 
which the two camps had already reached consensus, including 
a number of bills and resolutions proposed by the Greens and 
the Blues in the course of the December 11 Legislative Yuan 
(LY) election.  Chen also urged Taiwan to \"stand in 
solidarity\" in the face of China\'s \"escalating belligerent 
rhetoric and military intimidation.\"  He pledged that Taiwan 
will continue to stand firm and seek peace and stability, and 
said he would form a \"Committee for Cross-Strait Peace and 
Development\" in order to forge an internal consensus in 
Taiwan.  Despite his theme of reconciliation, Pan-Blue 
politicians continue to doubt Chen\'s sincerity.  Given this 
atmosphere of mistrust and contention, it is difficult to 
imagine anything constructive being achieved in the next 
three weeks before the end of this LY session.  End Summary. 
 
Give Politics a Break 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a New Year\'s Day address entitled, \"Creating a New 
and Stable Environment for Consultation and Dialogue,\" Chen 
Shui-bian stressed the need for reconciliation and 
cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties in 
order to stabilize politics, improve the people\'s livelihood, 
foster ethnic harmony, and promote cross-Strait peace.  On 
domestic politics, recalling the \"heated campaigns\" of 
presidential and legislative election over the past year, 
Chen urged Taiwan to accept the outcomes as part of the 
process of democracy.  He called for \"calm and rest\" for the 
people and \"solidarity and stability\" for the nation. 
Acknowledging that the Taiwan people had sent a clear message 
in the December 11 legislative election that \"the governing 
party must rule with humility while the opposition parties 
must be rational in providing oversight,\" Chen stated that 
Taiwan does not need bifurcation and ongoing confrontation 
between the Pan-Green and Pan-Blue. 
 
Starting with Domestic Legislation 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Stating that \"politics is an art of possibilities,\" 
Chen promised to listen attentively to the voices of the 
people and to the opinions of the ruling and opposition 
parties in his decisions on the new Cabinet.  He proposed 
that the two camps work toward reconciliation by starting 
dialogue on the areas on which the two sides had already 
reached consensus, including the Ten Priority Bills and Nine 
Major Law, proposals that had been rolled out by the 
Pan-Green and Pan-Blue coalitions, respectively, during the 
campaign for the December 11 LY election.  Chen invited 
leaders from each camp, as well as representatives from the 
executive and legislative branches, to meet as soon as 
possible to negotiate the legislation.  He followed up on 
January 3 by convening a meeting of DPP leaders to establish 
internal party consensus in support of his call for 
inter-party cooperation. 
 
Forging Consensus on Cross-Strait Peace 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In the portion of the speech that addressed 
cross-Strait relations, Chen said that now that the LY 
election was over, Taiwan should close the \"Pan-Green and 
Pan-Blue divide\" in order to \"stand in solidarity\" in the 
face of China\'s \"escalating belligerent rhetoric and military 
intimidation.\"  He noted that Taiwan had extended many olive 
branches over the previous four years and sought to establish 
a new basis for dialogue, but China had continued its 
military intimidation, most recently \"concocting a so-called 
\'legal basis\' for its military invasion of Taiwan\" through 
the proposed \"anti-secession law.\"  Chen urged that PRC 
authorities \"not under-estimate the will of the Taiwan people 
to defend the sovereignty, security and dignity of the 
Republic of China.\"  He then pledged that Taiwan would 
continue to stand firm and seek peace and stability, and 
announced that he would form a \"Committee for Cross-Strait 
Peace and Development\" in order to forge an internal 
consensus in Taiwan. 
5. (C) Chen then thanked Taiwan\'s \"international allies, 
including the United States and Japan,\" for their continued 
support, noting that sometimes \"progress can only be made 
tacitly, and not publicized.\"  Then he rejected \"unfair 
slanders\" of Taiwan\'s foreign policy and expressed confidence 
in Taiwan\'s friends and the continued prospects for expanding 
Taiwan\'s international space. 
 
Pan-Blue Doubts Chen\'s Sincerity 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Despite his theme of reconciliation, Pan-Blue 
politicians continue to doubt Chen\'s sincerity.  Dismissing 
Chen\'s goodwill statements as \"nothing new,\" People First 
Party (PFP) Legislator Sun Ta-chien told AIT on January 3 
that the Pan-Blue has come to distrust Chen\'s \"expressions of 
humility.\"  Sun asked rhetorically, \"will Chen give up 
supporting Taiwan independence and using the referendum to 
enact a new Constitution, will he empower the March 19 Truth 
Investigation Commission with real teeth, and will he 
resubmit the Control Yuan nomination list?\"  Sun said that he 
doubted Chen would yield on any of these issues.  KMT 
Legislator Lee Chuan-chiao agreed that Chen cannot be 
believed, but said he would take a wait and see attitude. 
Lee suggested that Chen could show his sincerity by 
appointing PFP Chairman James Soong as the Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) Chairman, the position now vacant with Koo 
Chen-fu\'s death on January 3.   Soochow University Professor 
Emile Sheng told AIT that the litmus test for the extent of 
Chen\'s willingness to cooperate would be his stance on the 
Control Yuan nominations and Special Defense Budget. 
 
Comment:  Chaos Still Reigns 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Despite Chen\'s conciliatory statements in his New 
Year\'s Address, Taiwan politics remain volatile and 
contentious.  The Taiwan High Court dealt KMT Chairman Lien 
Chan and his presidential running mate James Soong another 
defeat on December 30 when it rejected the KMT-PFP lawsuit to 
invalidate the March 20 presidential election.  Lien and 
Soong\'s frustration over being deprived of victory on March 
20 continues to drive the Pan-Blue coalition to oppose Chen 
on almost every issue.  Tensions exist within the Pan-Blue as 
well, with the PFP angry that the KMT failed to provide PFP 
with financial resources and electoral support in the LY 
election.  The same internal mistrust is mirrored within the 
Pan-Green alliance, between the TSU and DPP, and even within 
the DPP itself, between its dominant New Tide faction and the 
rest of the party. 
 
8. (C) There is pervasive discontent among the rank and file 
of all four parties, who feel their party leaders are 
primarily concerned with their own self-interest.  While most 
political observers predict impasse over the next three 
weeks, the more optimistic hope that the conclusion of the 
current and highly contentious LY session on January 21 will 
provide an opportunity for the two opposing political camps 
to compromise and begin long overdue cooperation.  With the 
same leadership in both camps that produced the current 
deadlock still in place, however, it will require a dramatic 
shift to generate any mood of reconciliation, cooperation, or 
commitment to the greater good.

\"Relief Efforts for South Asia\'s [Tsunami Disaster] 
Must Be Based on Human Rights and Also Serve Diplomatic 
Purposes in Order to Win the [International 
Community\'s] Respect\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Taiwan Daily\" said in an 
editorial (1/5): 
 
\". The United States\' relief efforts [for the tsunami 
disaster in South Asia] are also a demonstration of its 
political strength.  Washington has not only increased 
its relief fund from USD35 million to 350 million - an 
amount that exceeds that donated by China - but has 
also sent battleships to the devastated areas in 
Indonesia, using its navy helicopters to help deliver 
food and other major supplies to the tsunami victims. 
Another U.S. fleet carrying 1,500 Marine Corps soldiers 
has also arrived in Sri Lanka for relief operations. 
U.S. influence, which was believed to have disappeared 
rapidly some time earlier, is now back [to the region] 
because of this natural disaster.  In the meantime, the 
United States is acting proactively in an attempt to 
use this opportunity to mend its deteriorating 
relations with the Muslim countries. .\" 
 
2. U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations 
 
\"Stability Offers Hope for Better Cross-Strait Ties\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taiwan News\" 
editorialized (1/5): 
 
\". Although the U.S. has upheld what it calls `our one- 
China policy\' for over 30 years, Washington has never 
clearly defined what this `our one-China policy\' 
actually is and has stressed its hope that no side will 
take actions to arbitrarily change the so-called 
`status quo.\' 
 
\"In effect, the U.S. has adopted a `legally ambiguous 
but strategically in the U.S. sphere of influence\' 
stance regarding the position of Taiwan. 
 
\"In the future, relations between Washington and 
Beijing will probably continue to develop on the basis 
of this principle, which apparently cannot be altered 
arbitrarily by any one person or political party. . 
 
\"Owing to the improvement in U.S.-PRC ties, the 
situation in cross-strait relations should also tend to 
become more stable and predictable. 
 
\"Washington is very anxious to encourage both Beijing 
and Taipei to resume dialogue in order to ease cross- 
strait tensions and open the possibility for more 
positive mutual interaction. 
 
\"The statement made by President Chen Shui-bian in his 
October 10 National Day Address that such dialogue 
could resume on the foundations of the September 1992 
talks in Hong Kong between Taipei\'s semi-official 
Strait Exchange Foundation and Beijing\'s counterpart 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
offered a `new element\' to the picture that can act as 
a lever to prepare the way for new talks. 
 
\"Whether the two sides can succeed in arranging lunar 
new year holiday charter flights for Taiwan 
businesspersons in China may provide a crucial test to 
see whether cross-strait relations will worsen or 
improve in the new year.\"

A) \"In the Face of the United States\' Support, Taiwan 
Should Push Harder for the Passage of the [Special] 
Arms Procurement Deal\" 
 
The pro-independence \"Taiwan Daily\" editorialized 
(1/6): 
 
\". The United States has failed to treat the 
governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait 
impartially and justly.  For example, when Taiwan 
wanted to push for a name rectification plan and it 
wanted to change the names of its [state-owned] 
enterprises, the move was criticized as `a unilateral 
attempt to change the status quo of the Taiwan Strait.\' 
On the other hand, however, Washington acted as if 
nothing had happened when China said it wanted to 
institute an `anti-secession law.\'  The State 
Department officials\' improper behaviors will give 
China the wrong impression; Beijing would think that no 
matter what it does, the United States would stand by 
its side.  Once encouraged [by the United States], 
China will adopt more drastic actions . and might 
likely start to play with fire eventually.  When this 
happens, not only Taiwan but also the Asia-Pacific 
region and the United States will get hurt. . 
 
\"Taiwan\'s national defense power is a basis for 
protecting the island\'s social and economic 
developments; it is also a cornerstone to safeguard the 
island\'s existence.  When people and media of other 
countries are voicing support for Taiwan, we should 
have a better understanding of the current situation 
and push harder for the passage of the special arms 
procurement deal in an attempt to strengthen Taiwan\'s 
security protection power.\" 
 
B) \"Taiwan Does Not Need to Replace Koo\" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language \"Taiwan News\" 
said in an editorial (1/6): 
 
\". The fundamental deadlock between Taiwan and the PRC 
centers on the facts that Taiwan is already a democracy 
and an independent sate and that the PRC authorities 
remain unwilling or unable to acknowledge, much less 
adapt, to this reality.  After nearly a decade of 
deepening democratization symbolized by the majority 
mandate given to President Chen Shui-bian and Vice 
President Lu of the Democratic Progress Party last 
March 20, returning to the era of the National 
Unification Guidelines or to the heyday of the Koo-Wang 
process is not an option. 
 
\"Future dialogue between Taipei and Beijing, if and 
when it resumes, will not be based on `comfort\' 
feelings deriving from commonalities of the cultural 
sensibilities of aristocrats and authoritarians or the 
chimera of KMT-CCP cooperation on the temple of great 
Chinese chauvinism. 
 
\"From Taiwan\'s position, the process of dialogue to 
find a way for both sides to live together can only be 
based on a democratic process and citizen 
participation. 
 
\"Unless Beijing wants a conflict that its modernization 
drive can ill afford, the new PRC leaders have little 
choice but to tacitly begin on the basis of the reality 
of Taiwan\'s actual independence and democracy and 
forego attempts to solve the `Taiwan problem\' by 
appealing to particular Taiwan leaders or third powers, 
even the United States, and exclude the Taiwan people.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Taiwan\'s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) asked Taiwan 
airlines to conduct cross-Strait Lunar New Year charter 
flights and authorized the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) 
to negotiate arrangements for such flights with the PRC.  MAC 
is prepared to arrange a TAA-led delegation to travel to the 
PRC as soon as January 8 to begin negotiations.  The Taiwan 
government has not authorized KMT Legislator Chang Hsiao-yen 
to negotiate for Taiwan.  Participation of Chinese airlines, 
unofficial participation of government officials in 
negotiations, and flight paths could yet turn out to be 
obstacles that keep charter flights from taking off.  (End 
summary.) 
 
Leaving the Gate 
---------------- 
 
2. (U) On Monday, January 3, MAC officials held a meeting 
with Taiwan airlines to seek their participation in 
cross-Strait Lunar New Year holiday (February 6-13, 2005) 
charter flights and authorized the TAA to negotiate 
arrangements for such flights.  MAC Vice Chairman Chiu 
Tai-san told the press that Taiwan would seek direct, two-way 
passenger charter flights.  He asked domestic airlines to 
file applications with Chinese authorities \"in the proper 
manner at the right time.\" 
 
3. (C) MAC Vice Chairman David Huang told AIT/T poloff 
January 4 that MAC is prepared to arrange a delegation under 
the auspices of the Taipei Airline Association (TAA) to 
discuss the possibility of Lunar New Year cross-Strait 
charter flights.  The delegation would include Taiwan 
government officials acting in an unofficial capacity and 
could leave Taiwan as early as January 8.  Huang emphasized 
Taiwan\'s intention to implement charter flights under the 
\"Hong Kong model\" used to negotiate the 2002 Taiwan-Hong Kong 
Aviation Agreement (ref A).  He said that despite PRC 
insistence that there be no Taiwan-PRC 
government-to-government contact, the \"Hong Kong model\" would 
allow government officials from both sides to negotiate at 
the same table without official status. 
 
4. (C) Huang rejected the possibility of implementing charter 
flights under the model used to arrange such flights in 2003. 
 That year Taiwan airlines applied directly to PRC aviation 
authorities to conduct flights, with no direct negotiations 
ahead of time.  PRC airlines were not permitted to conduct 
charter flights.  Huang said that 2003 set a bad precedent 
because private airlines bypassed Taiwan government officials 
to deal directly with the PRC.  He also cited the financial 
concerns of carriers as justification for discarding the 2003 
model.  However, regardless what method is used to implement 
charter flights, Taiwan airlines are still likely to lose 
money providing the service since most travelers have already 
booked conventional flights for the period (ref B). 
 
Jumping Ahead 
------------- 
 
5. (C) Taiwan press reported that KMT Legislator Chang 
Hsiao-yen, who took credit for arranging the 2003 charter 
flights, would depart for Beijing on January 8 to discuss 
charter flights with PRC government officials.  According to 
the report, he met with Taiwan airlines on January 5 to 
invite their representatives to accompany him, but the 
airlines rejected his offer because he has no official 
authorization from the Taiwan government to negotiate with 
the PRC.  MAC\'s Huang confirmed that Chang has no authority 
to participate in such negotiations, and suggested that many 
would try to take credit for the charter flights.  Chang\'s 
office told AIT/T that he is planning to travel to Beijing on 
the 8th but had no details about his itinerary, what he would 
do, or who would accompany him. 
6. (SBU) Taiwan media also reported that Michael Lo, Chairman 
of the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) and President of 
Mandarin Airlines would travel to Beijing on January 6 to 
meet with PRC airlines to discuss charter flights.  According 
to the media, only TAA Secretary General Solo H.J. Su would 
accompany Lo because MAC officials wanted to keep the 
delegation small and the visit low-key.  However, when 
contacted by AIT/T, Lo\'s office denied that Lo and Su had any 
plans at this time to travel to the PRC.  His staff told 
AIT/T that Lo and Su were in a meeting in Taipei regarding 
charter flights that might yield instructions on how to 
proceed.  MAC Economic Fu Don-cheng told AIT/T that the story 
was absolutely false and that MAC was waiting for a response 
from the PRC before approving a delegation to travel. 
 
7. (SBU) A third report indicated that Xiamen Airlines had 
already been approved by Hong Kong authorities to conduct 
charter flights that would pass through Hong Kong airspace 
enroute to Taiwan.  According to the report, the airline only 
lacked Taiwan approval to implement flights.  MAC Senior 
Secretary Lee Li-Jane told us that regardless of what 
 
SIPDIS 
preparations had been made by any PRC airlines, absolutely no 
applications to conduct charter flights would be accepted 
until the Taiwan and the PRC had conducted some form of 
negotiations to determine how the flights would be 
implemented. 
 
Comment - Bumps Ahead 
--------------------- 
 
8. (C) Three key issues could become obstacles to successful 
implementation of charter flights.  First, authorizing PRC 
airlines to participate could prove difficult.  While a 
system for Taiwan airlines applying for charter flights was 
already worked out in 2003, there was no reciprocal 
arrangement for PRC airlines.  Taiwan\'s Civil Aeronautics 
Administration (CAA) Planning, Legal and International 
Affairs Branch Chief Chou Su-hwa told us that CAA might 
simply be able to apply its charter application procedures 
for \"other territories\" airlines to PRC airlines.  However, 
this has never been tried, and time is growing short.  Taiwan 
airlines have representative offices in several PRC locations 
that can coordinate charter flight preparations, but PRC 
airlines do not have similar representation in Taiwan. 
 
9. (C) Another more important issue will be the model used to 
negotiate details for the flights.  Taiwan\'s government sees 
direct negotiations between government officials, even under 
the auspices of a private organization, not only as a 
necessary step in implementing charter flights, but also as 
an important political victory for Taiwan.  Both sides have 
indicated that the \"Hong Kong model\" can be used to negotiate 
the charter flights, but could still differ on what they 
interpret the \"Hong Kong model\" to be.  If the PRC attempts 
to exclude government officials from negotiations or insists 
on the model used to implement the 2003 Lunar New Year 
charter flights, Taiwan may refuse to participate. 
 
10. (C) Finally, charter flight paths could also be a deal 
breaker.  Ref C reports that Beijing will likely insist that 
the charter flights fly directly between Taiwan and PRC 
airspace.  Taiwan may require the planes to pass through the 
airspace of a third territory, such as Hong Kong, Macau or 
Japan.  CAA\'s Chou told AIT/T that there is no technical 
justification for requiring flights to pass the airspace of a 
third territory.  Nevertheless, MAC\'s Huang told poloff that 
Taiwan would seek to impose such a requirement.  (End

E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/06/2015 
TAGS: PGOV, TW 
SUBJECT: TAIWAN LY SPEAKER ON CROSS-STRAIT PROPOSAL, 
PREMIER AND SPEAKER\'S ELECTION 
 
Classified By: ROBERT W. FORDEN, AIT KAOHSIUNG PRINCIPAL OFFICER. 
REASON:  1.4(B/D). 
 
1.  (C) January 2 Taiwan Legislative Yuan (LY) Speaker Wang 
Jin-pyng told AIT/K Branch Chief that he saw little hope for 
his proposal to lead a LY delegation to Beijing, as he 
expected it to be blocked by President Chen.  Wang had 
announced December 31 that, if he were re-elected Speaker, he 
would support creation of an LY cross-Strait issues task 
force and would lead a delegation of task force members to 
Beijing to discuss cross-Strait issues.  Despite what he 
expected would be strong opposition from the ruling party, 
Wang said he would push for legislation to create the task 
force and create a stronger role for the LY to push for 
progress on cross-Strait issues, given President Chen\'s 
failure to do so. 
 
2.  (C) Wang was optimistic about his chances of being 
re-elected LY Speaker.  He said the  ruling Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) had not yet made a decision on 
whether it would field its own candidate for the position. 
However, given the opposition Pan Blue\'s \"24 or 25 seat 
advantage\" in the LY, Wang said, he was confident of 
re-election (Note: it is unclear where Wang\'s seat total 
comes from -- the Pan Blue holds only 114 of the 225 LY seats 
and, even if all 10 independent LY members voted with the Pan 
Blue, it would represent a 23-seat advantage over the 101 Pan 
Green LY total.  End Note). 
 
3.  (C) Separately, Wang commented that it looked likely that 
President Chen would appoint Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh 
(Chang-ting) as Premier later this month, replacing incumbent 
Premier Yu Shyi-kun.  Wang, however, did not believe Hsieh 
would make a strong Premier, as Hsieh lacked experience at 
the central government level (Note:  Hsieh has served as 
Kaohsiung Mayor, LY member, Chairman of the DPP and was the 
DPP\'s vice presidential candidate in 1996, but has never held 
a central government position.  End Note).  Wang also did not 
expect Hsieh to work better with the opposition parties than 
Premier Yu.  While many claimed Hsieh\'s effective 
coordination with the opposition parties in the Kaohsiung 
City Council demonstrated that Hsieh could build inter-party 
coalitions, Wang argued the LY would be a much different game 
for Hsieh. 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
4.  (C)  Wang\'s candid assessment that DPP opposition would 
likely kill his proposal to lead an LY task force delegation 
to Beijing is likely correct.  It also suggests that the 
proposal primarily is a gambit in his quest to hold on to his 
job.  (The four conditions Wang prescribed for a mainland 
visit make it a highly unlikely prospect anyway.)  This high 
profile effort may also reflect his early push for a more 
ambitious goal -- the KMT presidential nomination in 2008, as 
scholar and KMT-intimate Emile Sheng told AIT January 3. 
Nevertheless, if Wang does follow through with promised 
legislation carving out a more active cross-Strait role for 
the LY, it could stimulate broader debate and maybe even new 
approaches to the cross-Strait stalemate.  Wang\'s optimism 
about re-election as Speaker suggests he is confident he has 
pinned down sufficient Pan Blue support, which indicates he 
has confirmed that the PFP will support him despite continued 
sniping.  Wang has been criticized by some within the Pan 
Blue, especially \"deep Blue\" members who oppose the \"ben tu 
pai\" (Taiwan faction) and who see Wang as a weak leader.  The 
lack of a strong alternative candidate is probably Wang\'s 
greatest strength in holding onto his position.  It remains 
unclear whether the ruling party will attempt to unseat Wang 
with a compromise candidate, perhaps by offering a counter 
deal to the PFP. 
 
5.  (C)  Speculation on the appointment of Mayor Hsieh to the 
Premiership has been strong in the media for some time. 
However, last week\'s announcement that another leading 
prospect to succeed President Chen in 2008, Presidential 
Office Secretary General Su Tseng-chang, would run for DPP 
Chairman with Chen\'s blessing, has left Hsieh as the leading 
and logical candidate -- i.e., would balance successor 
candidates and not force Chen to play his hand this early in 
his lame-duck term.  Wang\'s negative assessment of Hsieh is 
not suprising; in AIT\'s meetings with Wang over the years, 
Wang has been uniformally negative on all leading ruling 
party figures, not a few of whom return the favor.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EINV, EFIN, ECON, TW 
SUBJECT: TFX001: Taiwan Economic Brief December 2005 
 
 
1.  This cable summarizes selected Taiwan economic events in 
December 2004. 
 
-- Taiwan becomes OECD trade committee observer 
 
-- Taiwan leads world in chip packaging and testing 
 
-- Taiwan worries about over-reliance on China 
 
-- Taiwan\'s 2004 and 2005 economic performance 
 
-- Taiwan aids tsunami victims 
 
Taiwan Accepted as Project Observer in OECD Trade Committee 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2.  The Geneva-based Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD) announced in late December that it 
had accepted Taiwan along with Israel and Romania as project 
observers in its Trade Committee.  Taiwan will be allowed to 
attend specific meetings but will not have the privileges 
and obligations of member economies and will not be required 
to contribute an annual membership fee.  While still 
struggling to become a full-fledged observer rather than a 
project observer, Taiwan considers the project observer 
status a significant step forward in coordinating economic 
policies with OECD members.  Taiwan\'s Board of Foreign Trade 
Director General Huang Chih-peng noted that the OECD 
position on issues influences WTO decisions, and a presence 
in OECD Trade Committee deliberations allows Taiwan more 
opportunity to coordinate on economic issues that will later 
be negotiated in the WTO.  Taiwan became an observer at the 
OECD Competition Committee three years ago. 
 
Taiwan Tops World\'s Chip Packaging and Testing 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  Taiwan\'s semiconductor chip packaging and testing 
industry surpassed South Korea\'s in 2004 with growth of 36% 
to become the worlds largest at NT$159.6 billion (US$4.9 
billion at US$1:NT$32).  Taiwan\'s Industrial Economics and 
Knowledge Center (IEK) estimates the industry\'s revenue in 
2005 will grow 12% to NT$178.1 billion (US$5.5 billion). 
The slower growth is a reflection of excess global 
inventories of these products.  According to IEK, Taiwan\'s 
industry leads rivals in advanced ball grid array (BGA) 
technologies for chip packaging and testing services.  IEK 
anticipates the ongoing rapid growth of the industry would 
make Taiwan a promising market for equipment and material 
suppliers.  IEK projects Taiwan\'s consumption of packaging 
materials will top NT$100 billion (US$3.1 billion) in 2005. 
 
Businessmen Urged to Diversify Overseas Investment 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4.  Taiwan\'s Council for Economic Planning and Development 
(CEPD) in December again urged Taiwan businesspeople to 
diversify overseas investments away from China.  CEPD 
suggested Taiwan investors consider India, Bangladesh, Latin 
America, and new members of the European Union as places to 
invest.  According to a CEPD report, China attracted 65 
percent of Taiwan\'s total overseas investment in the first 
ten months of 2004 and 37 percent of Taiwan\'s exports went 
to China and Hong Kong.  To reduce over-reliance on China, 
Taiwan is seeking to sign free trade agreements with other 
trading partners and encourages businesses to sell in 
markets other than China by providing incentives such as 
export loans and export insurance. 
 
Economic Performance in 2004 and 2005 
------------------------------------- 
5.  Taiwan\'s real economic growth in 2004 is expected to 
reach nearly six percent, the highest level in the past 
seven years.   Excess inventories and higher oil prices, 
however, prompted a slowdown in the second half of the year. 
Export growth slowed from nearly 40 percent in May to 12 
percent in November.  Manufacturing growth slipped from 17 
percent in May and June to four percent in October and 
November.  The CEPD and local economic think tanks predict 
private investment will continue to grow in 2005 allowing 
economic growth of around 4.5 percent with relatively stable 
prices.  The consumer price index in 2005 is expected to 
rise 1.8-1.9 percent, up modestly from a rate of 1.5 percent 
in the first 11 months of 2004.  The CEPD is confident 
continued investment growth will reduce unemployment from 
4.14 percent in November 2004 to below four percent in 2005. 
 
Taiwan\'s Aid to Southeast Asian Nations 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6.  On January 2, 2005, Taiwan\'s Executive Yuan (EY) 
announced it will increase its official aid to nations 
suffering from recent earthquakes and tsunamis from US$5 
million to US$50 million.  Taiwan\'s donation will include 
US$20 million in food (2,000 metric tons of rice and 500,000 
boxes of cooked rice), US$15 million of medical supplies, 
and US$15 million for community and port reconstruction.  In 
addition to official aid, dozens of local NGOs have launched 
donation campaigns.  Taiwan\'s Red Cross collected some US$3 
million in first week after the disaster.  The Buddhist 
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation mobilized several 
thousands of volunteers to solicit contributions in major 
cities all over Taiwan.  Private citizens in Taiwan have 
donated about US$6 million to a special account created by 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Taiwan\'s Department of 
Health (DOH) has organized a medical team of 200 persons 
that will travel to the affected areas.  Taiwan media 
reports that despite being one of the largest donors to 
international relief efforts, Taiwan will not be invited to 
join a planned donors\' summit in Jakarta.

A) \"Noble Taiwan Will Not Become Apathetic Because of 
International Isolation\" 
 
The centrist, pro-status quo \"China Times\" 
editorialized (1/7): 
 
\"Inevitably, Taiwan people feel aggrieved after Taiwan 
donated money and sent people to relieve the tsunami 
disaster in South Asia but was excluded from 
participation in the tsunami relief world summit.  The 
reaction [of Taiwan people] is rational. Since the 
international reality is so severe, Taiwan should not 
give up so easily.  Taiwan should, instead, proactively 
devote the power of all [Taiwan] people continuously, 
and carry out the relief job solidly in order to speak 
loudly for Taiwan by making contributions that will 
truly benefit those who suffered [in the disaster].\" 
 
B) \"An `Anti-Annexation\' Law Won\'t Ease PRC Tension\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification English-language 
\"China Post\" said in an editorial (1/7): 
 
\"The move by the Cabinet Wednesday to drop an article 
from a draft of revisions to the Referendum Law that 
would have granted the people the right to initiate 
constitutional amendments marked a reversal of a major 
legislative plan in the face of pressure coming from 
the United States. 
 
\"But as it was trying to repair strained relations with 
Washington, the administration made a new legislative 
attempt that is bound to add to tension with Beijing. 
The Cabinet included in the bill, which is subject to 
approval by the Legislative Yuan, a new provision that 
would allow the people to hold a referendum on 
territorial changes. 
 
\"But the attempt to use an `anti-annexation\' law to 
counter an `anti-secession\' law does not seem to be 
helpful.  Beijing would not withdraw its plan to create 
the legislation just because of Taipei\'s decision to 
respond in kind.  Nor would Beijing be likely to change 
its longstanding policy of using force because of a 
concern that an invasion could anger the people of 
Taiwan and stir them to hold a popular vote to say no 
to its action..\" 
 
C) \"Chen\'s Proposal is Very Pragmatic\" 
 
The pro-independence English-language \"Taipei times\" 
said in an editorial (1/7): 
 
\"As for the new proposal to approve changes to national 
boundaries through referendums, many believe this is a 
move to counter China\'s anti-secession law. 
 
\"Presumably, in the event of Chinese military 
aggression justified by law Taiwan may be able to 
declare this a change of national boundaries or the 
exclusion of the Chinese Mainland from the definition 
of national boundaries.  This would not impact the 
status quo of the Republic of China\'s (ROC) 
sovereignty, and technically it would still conform 
with the US policy of `maintaining the status quo.\'  It 
also shouldn\'t violate any basic principles of the pan- 
blue camp.\"

1. Summary. Taiwan has thus far managed to avoid Avian 
Influenza since early 2004.  Following the outbreak of H5N2 
Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) in Taiwan in early 
2004 and the outbreaks of H5N1 High Pathogenic Avian 
Influenza (HPAI) in neighboring countries both last year and 
this year, however, Taiwan has been proactive in preparing 
for the worst.  Reftel D provides post\'s February 2004 
responses to Department questionnaire regarding Avian 
Influenza.  Based on further proactive steps undertaken by 
Taiwan authorities, this cable provides updated responses to 
the questionnaire.  The primary change since last February 
is that Taiwan has drafted a major influenza prevention and 
response plan.  Previously, Taiwan had relied upon its SARS 
preparation and response plan.  Now Taiwan has also prepared 
influenza-specific plans.  Those plans include the 
establishment of a new emergency response center at Taiwan\'s 
Center for Disease Control.  Further, Taiwan has committed 
to invest a total of NT$6 billion (USD 187 million) towards 
developing and manufacturing influenza vaccines.  In 
addition, Taiwan has also culled an additional 270,000 birds 
since February.  Given Taiwan\'s proximity to the many other 
countries in the region facing the threat of outbreaks of 
Avian Influenza, it may be only a matter of time before 
Taiwan\'s preparations are put to the test.  End Summary. 
 
Surveillance for Animal Influenza 
--------------------------------- 
Q. Is there active of passive animal surveillance for Animal 
Influenza in country? 
A.  Taiwan has an active surveillance program on commercial 
poultry, wild fowl, and migratory birds. 
 
Q.  Who is the Point of Contact in the Ministry of 
Agriculture? 
A. Dr. Ying Yeh, Deputy Director General, 
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health, Inspection and Quarantine 
(BAPHIQ), Council of Agriculture (COA). 
 
Q. Where are animal diagnostic laboratory samples tested for 
influenza? 
A. Initially samples are tested at the four Regional Poultry 
Health Centers and confirmed by the National Institute of 
Animal Health in Tamshui, Taipei County.  Taiwan uses PCR 
testing, DNA sequencing and pathogenicity index testing to 
establish the type and pathogenicity of the influenza. 
 
Q. Is laboratory capacity sufficient or would assistance be 
welcome? 
A. Capacity is sufficient. 
 
Q. Are results being communicated to national officials? 
A.  Yes. BAPHIQ reports to COA, which reports to the 
Executive Yuan (Cabinet). 
 
Culling Practices 
----------------- 
 
Q. How is culling defined and practiced? 
A.  When tests establish that Avian Influenza is present on 
a farm, whether it is Low Pathogenic (LPAI) or High 
Pathogenic (HPAI), the farm is depopulated.  To date, Taiwan 
has only detected LPAI and that was in early 2004 (except in 
spring 2004 when six ducks with H5N1 HPAI were detected in 
Kinmen island.  These ducks were later determined to be 
contraband smuggled from Mainland China). Birds are 
euthanized via their feed or water and then incinerated. 
Farms are disinfected.  Based on the 1997 Foot and Mouth 
Disease outbreak, Taiwan has a great deal of experience in 
dealing with serious animal disease outbreaks.  Taiwan also 
has a relatively modern veterinary and quarantine 
infrastructure. 
 
Q. Are culling protocols available to be sent to DC? 
A. The Animal Contagious Disease Prevention Statute is 
available in Chinese. 
 
Q.  Are cullers adequately protected? 
A.  Yes, cullers wear masks, boots, gloves, and protective 
clothing. 
 
Q. Are cullers being adequately trained to use PPE? 
A. Yes, the staff of the local Livestock Disease Control 
Center supervises the cull and trains the cullers. 
 
Q. Would they benefit from training assistance 
A.  Not needed. 
 
Q. Are culled carcasses adequately disposed of? 
A. Yes, carcasses are disposed of by incineration. 
 
Q. How many have already been culled? 
A. During 2004, 380,000 birds were culled. 
 
Movement of avian livestock 
--------------------------- 
 
Q. What measures are in effect to control movement of 
poultry (and birds) within the country. 
A.  Farms on which AI is suspected or detected are isolated 
and, if detection is confirmed, the farms are depopulated. 
Farms within a 3-kilometer radius of a farm on which AI is 
detected are subject to movement control and intensive 
surveillance for 6 months. 
 
Vaccination 
----------- 
 
Q.  Has vaccine for Avian influenza been applied to poultry 
in the country?  If so, what type and approximately what 
proportion are? 
A.  Vaccination for AI is not permitted, although BAPHIQ 
suspects that individual farmers have been illegally using 
vaccines based on the Mexican AI strain. 
 
Animal Demographics Overview 
---------------------------- 
 
Taiwan has a modern poultry and livestock industry.  Both 
poultry and swine are produced on medium-to-large scale 
farms with regular service by professional veterinarians. 
Farms are devoted to a single species and are widely 
separated.  The major poultry species are modern broilers 
and layers, traditional colored chickens, and ducks as well 
as a small population of geese and turkeys.  There are 
132,000 poultry farms with a total bird population of 415 
million.  There are 13,000 swine farms with a total pig 
population of about 7 million.  Statistics are not available 
on the proportion of the population engaged in poultry/swine 
production, but if we multiply 145,000, the total number of 
poultry and swine farms, by an estimated average work force 
of 5 persons, the total work force is 725,000 or about 3 
percent of the population.  There are 3 major poultry 
wholesale markets that BAPHIQ and DOH have placed under 
close surveillance.  In addition, live poultry is sold and 
slaughtered in the traditional markets scattered throughout 
Taiwan\'s cities and towns.  Vendors have been educated by 
local authorities to be aware of signs of AI and practice 
good sanitation in their slaughter.  However, the 
traditional markets would be a cause for concern if Taiwan 
were to have an outbreak of HPAI. 
 
Trainers 
-------- 
Q.  Are certified trainers available to teach workers about 
the use of PPE throughout the country?  How many?  Who would 
pay trainers to give the training sessions?  Are funds 
available?  What are the estimated costs? 
A.  Local Livestock Disease Prevention Center personnel have 
been trained to use PPE and then train the workers assigned 
to a cull. 
 
Q. Are trainers available to teach workers about safe 
culling methods throughout the country?  Who would pay 
trainers to give sessions?  What are the estimated costs? 
A.  Local Livestock Disease Prevention Center personnel have 
been trained to teach workers to do a safe cull. 
 
Surveillance for influenza-like illness in humans: 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Q.  Have health care providers been alerted to be aware of 
any extra-ordinary cases of influenza-like illness? 
 
A.  Yes. Taiwan\'s Center for Disease Control (TCDC) has 
classified Avian Influenza, or \"Novel flu\" - as a 
\"notifiable communicable disease.\" Notifiable communicable 
diseases must be reported to the TCDC and the central 
government is authorized to take extraordinary efforts to 
contain such diseases. 
 
Further, Taiwan has committed to invest a total of NT$6 
billion (USD 187 million) towards developing and 
manufacturing influenza vaccines.  The plan is to devote ten 
percent of the budget on vaccine research and development. 
With the highest levels of political support, Taiwan health 
officials are working hard to secure the monies to fulfill 
this commitment. 
 
In addition to Taiwan\'s plans to develop a vaccine and 
Taiwan\'s existing strategies to prevent, contain and respond 
to SARS (see reftel C), TCDC has drafted a five-year 
\"Influenza Preparation and Prevention Plan\" (Flu plan).  The 
Flu plan details extensive strategies for trying to 
distinguish among SARS, influenza A/B and Novel flu and 
provides guidelines to medical workers to minimize confusion 
between the various types of viruses during the influenza 
season.  The plan is currently awaiting Executive Yuan 
approval. 
 
The Flu plan includes a 5-level Influenza Response System. 
The \"Alert Level\" is activated when there is one or more H5 
or H7 strain of virus detected domestically or there are any 
confirmed cases of bird-to-human transmission on High 
Pathogenic Avian Influenza Strain abroad.  \"Level A1\" is 
activated when there is at least one confirmed case of human- 
to-human transmission outside of Taiwan.  \"Level A2\" is 
activated when there is no indication of local transmission, 
but there is at least one confirmed case of  bird-to-human 
transmission and/or a laboratory suspected case and/or a 
suspected imported case in Taiwan.  \"Level B\" is activated 
when there are one or more confirmed cases of primary human- 
to-human transmission in Taiwan.  \"Level C\" is activated 
when there are confirmed secondary human-to- human 
transmission cases within Taiwan.  TCDC has responsibility 
for responding at the Alert and A1 levels, DOH becomes 
responsible at the A2 and B levels, and the Executive Yuan 
takes over at level C. 
Based on the above response levels, Taiwan has a 
surveillance program for Avian Influenza and SARS at its 
borders.  Taiwan is currently operating at the Alert level. 
At this level, TCDC urges all travelers to countries with 
avian influenza outbreaks to avoid touching raw poultry in 
those places.  In addition, all inbound passengers are 
required to complete health survey forms and undergo 
temperature checks.  Passengers with fevers or forms 
indicating illness are further assessed prior to 
immigration.  At the Alert and A1 levels, Nasopharyngeal 
washing or Throat Swabs are taken from any inbound 
passengers with fevers in excess of 38 C and a history of 
unprotected contact or exposure to the virus.  Those 
passengers are also required to take a full course of the 
anti-viral oseltamivir.  At the A1 level and/or above, in 
addition to the above measures, passengers from the affected 
areas are required to self-monitor for fevers twice a day 
for 10 days.  At level B and/or above, medical doctors will 
be posted at the borders to assist in these processes.  Also 
at level B, any outbound passenger with a fever over 38 C, 
must obtain a doctor\'s note confirming the person has been 
Avian influenza-free for at least 24 hours, before they can 
depart.  Finally, at level B and above, any passengers 
suspected of having avian influenza will be sent by 
ambulance to the designed hospitals for further management, 
where a series of lab tests will be conducted. 
 
Hospital Infection Control Measures 
----------------------------------- 
Q.  Have hospital infection control practices been put in 
place?  What type of systems are in place for care and 
isolation and/or quarantine of patients with suspected cases 
of Avian Influenza? 
 
A.  TCDC\'s Flu plan\'s hospital infection control measures 
include: a program to detect and survey fever patients 
promptly; implementation of a standard operating procedure 
for infection control in all hospitals; recruitment of 
qualified epidemiologists to help prevent inter-hospital 
transmissions by modeling outbreaks, a plan to evaluate 
nursing procedures to facilitate reorganizations that might 
be necessary; institution of fever surveillance and alert 
programs; establishment of a mechanism to assess the 
efficacy and efficiency of hospital infection control 
programs; the provision of comprehensive and intensive 
infection control training for hospital staff, plans to 
prevent any unsafe or unnecessary transportation of patients 
with a communicable disease;  and protocols for waste 
handling and personal hygiene.  Taiwan has 740 negative 
pressure beds available for use. 
 
In addition to the measures above, TCDC requires all 
hospitals and clinics to ask flu patients if  they have had 
any contact with poultry or farm owners.  Any patients who 
have had such contact are given the antiviral medication of 
oseltamivir (trademarked as Tamiflu) for five days.  Subject 
patients are required to have follow-up checkups. 
 
Finally, Taiwan has ordered a total of 2.5 million doses of 
influenza vaccine for this flu season - 500,000 for children 
and 2 million for adults.  Already 410,000 children and 1.62 
million adults have been vaccinated.  Health workers, babies 
between six and 24 months, senior citizens over 65, people 
with serious diseases, and workers in the avian and 
husbandry industries are provided shots free of charge. 
TCDC has also stockpiled 1.3 million oseltamivir tablets 
(enough medication to treat 130,000 influenza cases).  Thus 
far, only 10 percent has been used.  TCDC is planning to 
increase its stock of oseltamivir to 23 million tablets (so 
that Taiwan will have enough doses to treat 10 percent of 
its population). 
 
Samples 
-------- 
Q. Are samples being obtained from potential human cases of 
Avian Influenza? 
A. Taiwan currently does not have any potential human cases 
of avian influenza. 
 
Number of Human Cases 
--------------------- 
Q. Can you estimate the approximate number of human cases? 
A.  Again, thus far Taiwan has no human cases.  Taiwan has 
not detected any cases of High Pathogenic Avian Flu H5N1. 
 
Laboratory Surveillance and Capacity 
------------------------------------ 
Q. Where is laboratory surveillance done? 
A.   CDC has contracted with several labs stationed in major 
medical centers all over the island including:  National 
Taiwan University Hospital, Veterans General Hospital and 
Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital.  Offshore islands in 
Kinmen and Matsu are to report to labs in the northern part 
of Taiwan and the island of Penghu will report to a lab in 
Kaohsiung.  The general lab surveillance is done by TCDC. 
In addition to the 12 contracted P3-level laboratories 
throughout the island, TCDC has a plan to set up more 
laboratories if needed, in order to conduct more tests in a 
shorter time. 
 
Q.  Is Laboratory Capacity sufficient? 
A.  Laboratory capacity is sufficient. 
 
Availability of Respirators 
--------------------------- 
Q.  What is the availability of N-95 respirators or 
equivalent?  Of goggles? And of surgical gloves? Can more be 
purchased?  Does the country have resources to purchase a 
sufficient number of respirators, goggles and surgical 
gloves to ensure that all workers receive as many 
respirators as needed? 
A. TCDC is responsible for N-95 respirators or equivalent, 
surgical gloves, goggles and garments for health care 
workers.  According to TCDC, currently the stock of 
respirators and gloves for healthcare workers is sufficient. 
COA is responsible for the purchase of protection supplies 
for poultry industry workers and has adequate supplies on 
hand.  TCDC is also committed to work with COA to ensure 
that it obtains whatever supplies are needed. 
 
Communications 
-------------- 
Q.  Are results being communicated to national officials and 
between Ministries? 
A. Laboratory surveillance results are being communicated to 
relevant agencies and ministries.  In addition, TCDC, the 
Department of Health, the Bureau of National Health 
Insurance, COA and other relevant government agencies have 
been working very closely together since the emergence of 
Avian Influenza earlier this year.  Intra and interagency 
collaboration and coordination is excellent. 
 
 
Q.  What sort of communications policies and practices are 
in place concerning Avian Influenza? 
A. TCDC has designed and will soon open a new emergency 
response center at its headquarters to implement its 
emergency response plans in the event of an influenza, SARS 
or other infectious disease outbreak. 
 
TCDC\'s draft Flu Plan also details who, when and how to 
report on a probable Novel flu patient.  It also specifies 
how and when each level of government should respond to a 
reported case.  Furthermore, it establishes a new alerting 
network, which will enable the TCDC to directly communicate 
instructions with local health officials using mobile phones 
as soon as a case is reported.  It also provides protocols 
for cooperation across ministries. 
 
Finally, the Government Information Office (GIO) is working 
closely with all relevant government agencies and is 
responsible for all official public announcements regarding 
the disease.  The main points of contact for AIT are the COA 
and TCDC. 
 
Need for U.S. Assistance 
------------------------ 
Q.  Can U.S. experts from HHS, USDA and other agencies be of 
help? 
A.  Since Taiwan is not yet confronting Highly Pathogenic 
Avian Influenza, no assistance is necessary at this time. 
In the past, Taiwan has been quick to request assistance 
when needed.  As the situation develops, we will keep on top 
of the matter. 
 
Weaknesses/strengths in system 
------------------------------ 
Q. What weaknesses (and strengths) has post observed in the 
host\'s attempt to contain avian flu? 
A. Thus far, Taiwan has been able to avoid an outbreak of 
Highly Pathogenic H5N1.  Taiwan appears to be very proactive 
in its efforts to prevent, detect and respond to an avian 
influenza outbreak.  Given Taiwan\'s proximity to the many 
other countries facing the disease, however, it may only be 
a matter of time before Taiwan\'s precautionary measures are 
put to the test.  Taiwan CDC\'s infection control, fever 
surveillance efforts are particularly strong due to its 
significant preparations for another potential SARS outbreak 
and the H5N2 Low Pathogenic outbreak in Taiwan in early 
2004. COA and the livestock industry also learned from their 
experience with the major 1997 Foot and Mouth Disease 
outbreak that also resulted in significant investment in 
disease prevention, surveillance and control infrastructure, 
including the establishment of BAPHIQ in August 1998. 
Taiwan also benefits from the fact that it is an island, 
which affords a certain degree of protection.  Taiwan 
recently raised the level of criminal punishment for 
smuggling livestock and poultry so that it is equivalent to 
the penalties for smuggling arms or people. 
 
One potential threat is that a large number of migratory 
birds, which are potential AI carriers, over-winter in 
Taiwan.  However, farmers have been instructed to use 
netting and fencing to keep migratory birds away from their 
flocks.  Another potential threat is the integrity of 
Taiwan\'s national health-care infrastructure.  As reported 
in reftel E, unless Taiwan finds the political will to raise 
premiums and co-pays and/or institutes major reforms, the 
entire health-care infrastructure is at risk of financial 
ruin.  No matter how good Taiwan\'s flu plan may be, it will 
require a solvent health-care delivery system to make it 
work.

SUBJECT: TAIWAN\'S PLANNED GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION 
 
REF: A. 2004 TAIPEI 02879 
     B. 2002 TAIPEI 03912 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  Taiwan is undertaking a massive 
reorganization of its government.  The plan is to reduce 
Taiwan,s current 36 ministries down to 13 with 4 councils 
and 5 independent commissions over the next year.  Major 
changes include consolidating the administration of 
state-owned enterprises from multiple agencies to one (the 
Ministry of Finance) and eliminating the Examination Yuan. 
Top officials are confident that the plan can be implemented 
quickly and smoothly.  That confidence may be overly 
optimistic.  End Summary. 
 
Meeting/Background 
------------------ 
 
2. (U) On December 23, AIT Deputy Econ Chief met with 
Chairman of the Research, Development and Evaluation 
Commission (RDEC), Yeh Jiunn-rong, to follow up on press 
reports suggesting that new legislation to implement a major 
restructuring might occur within the current Legislative Yuan 
(LY) session, scheduled to recess on January 21.  Until 
recently, it was unclear what the new government structure 
would look like.  Interlocutors either did not have or were 
not willing to share draft plans with AIT.  Yeh provided a 
general outline of the proposed reorganization.  Also present 
at the meeting were RDEC Director Sung Yu-hsieh, AIT EconOFF 
and Econ Specialist. 
 
History of Decision 
------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Yeh said that 8 former Premiers had tried to push 
through similar reforms, but encountered major resistance due 
to special interests who were loathe to give up preferential 
treatment that had essentially become guaranteed under the 
single party KMT rule.  Yeh informed AIT that the idea to try 
again was based on a consensus decision to reorganize the 
government made at an August 2001 cross-sectoral/all-party 
meeting called \"Jing Fa Da Hui\" (Economic Development 
Advisory Conference).  Yeh insisted that the goal is to 
improve Taiwan\'s performance and was not one born out of 
partisan politics.  (Comment.  While the idea for the 
reorganization is not new, the current plan is.  Premier Yu 
Shyi-kun initiated the idea and Minister Yeh has been in 
charge of its development and implementation.  End Comment). 
 
Justification for Reorganization 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Yeh explained the goal of the reorganization is to 
simplify Taiwan,s bureaucracy to make it more 
\"user-friendly\" and enhance the efficiency of Taiwan\'s 
government institutions.  He said the hope is to empower the 
people through devolution and deregulation.  A handout 
provided stated the reasons for the reorganizations were to: 
1) offer quick and efficient services to the public through 
streamlining; 
2) generate capacity-building to cope with new issues in a 
global era 
3) reduce overlapping of administrative resources and to 
effectively control the scale of public spending; 
4) clarify the roles and responsibilities of government 
organs to improve their functions and efficiency. 
 
Basic Structure 
--------------- 
 
5. (U) Under the plan, the Executive Yuan (EY) would 
supervise all Ministries, make final decisions, remain headed 
by a premier and   coordinate cross-ministerial affairs and 
policies.  The plan also reduces the number of 
ministries/departments under the EY from 36 to 13.  There 
would also be 4 councils and 5 independent regulatory 
commissions.   The councils would have cross-ministry policy 
planning and coordination roles. 
 
6. (U) The thirteen ministries would be as follows: 
1) the Ministry of Interior and Homeland Security 
2) Ministry of Foreign and Expatriate Affairs 
3) Ministry of National Defense and Veteran Affairs 
4) Ministry of Finance 
5) Ministry of Education and Sports 
6) Ministry of Justice 
7) Ministry of Economic and Trade Affairs 
8) Ministry of Transportation and Public Construction 
9) Ministry of Health and Social Security 
10) Ministry of Agriculture 
11) Ministry of Culture and Tourism 
12) Ministry of Labor and Human Resources 
13) Ministry of Environment and Resources 
 
7. (U) The four councils would be as follows: 
1) Council of National Development and Technology 
2) Council of Mainland Affairs 
3) Council of Indigenous People\'s Affairs 
4) Council of Hakka Affairs 
 
8. (SBU) While Yeh did not indicate what the five commissions 
would be, he did indicate that the commissions would be 
independent from both the ministries and councils in order to 
regulate them without bias.  One current example of a 
Commission is the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) 
established on July 1 this year.  It is the independent 
regulator of financial institutions.  There is also an 
independent commission in the works in the form of the 
National Communications Commission (NCC), which the LY is 
currently considering to be the independent regulator of 
telecommunications firms.  Under the current plan, the heads 
of the commissions would be picked for life rather than 
serving at the will of the President in hopes of keeping the 
commissions apolitical.  Yeh noted that there is great 
reluctance to let the President appoint heads to the 
commissions, but insisted that he was working hard to resolve 
this. 
 
9. (SBU) The plan also proposes to dismantle the Examination 
Yuan.  Taiwan still operates under an exam-based civil 
service.  In order to work for the federal government, 
individuals must pass rigorous exams.  According to Yeh, this 
system has proved cumbersome and ineffective, often 
preventing the most qualified candidates from attaining jobs 
in the civil service.  The plan specifically proposes to 
discuss the elimination of the Examination Yuan at a 
conference scheduled to discuss amending Taiwan\'s 
constitution in the summer of 2005. As the Examination Yuan 
is established under the constitution, its abolishment would 
require a constitutional amendment.  The EY hopes the summer 
conference on the constitution will lead to such an 
amendment. 
 
Mainland Affairs Council 
------------------------ 
 
10. (C) Part of the reorganization plan originally included 
merging the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) into the Premier\'s 
office.  Reftel A reports on how Premier Yu won President 
Chen Shui-bain\'s approval for such a merger by circumventing 
NSC objections to the proposal.  Reftel also reports on the 
backlash the EY proposal evoked from the National Security 
Council (NSC) and MAC.  As it turns out, MAC and the NSC have 
won their battle on this front.  On Tuesday, January 4, the 
LY agreed that the MAC would not be merged with the EY and it 
would maintain its current independent cabinet status. 
 
11. (SBU) To implement this decision, the LY has consequently 
decided not to establish a new Council for Maritime Affairs 
as called for in the original EY proposal.  The original 
proposal limits the number of councils to four.  In order for 
MAC to maintain its status, one of the other newly proposed 
councils needed to be eliminated.  Apparently, the Maritime 
Affairs Council drew the short straw.  In its stead, the EY 
plans to establish a ministerial-level task force on maritime 
affairs to handle important cross-ministerial maritime policy 
issues.  That task force will likely be headed by a Minister 
Without Portfolio. 
 
Ministry of Finance to Consolidate Financial Holdings 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
12. (SBU) News reports indicate that the Ministry of Finance 
(MOF) submitted a state-owned enterprise (SOE) management 
consolidation proposal to the Executive Yuan for approval on 
December 28.  Apparently, MOF has proposed to first take over 
administration of SOEs, which have less than 50 percent 
government ownership and then to later also take over SOEs 
with public ownership greater than 50 percent.  If approved, 
MOF would end up taking over 40 SOEs currently being 
administered under six other ministerial agencies. 
 
13. (U) The only two SOEs that have not been specifically 
identified to move to MOF within a specific time-frame are 
Chunghwa Telecom and the public water Utility.  The Ministry 
of Transportation has successfully made the case for 
maintaining supervisory control of Chunghwa Telecom for as 
long as it takes it to privatize due to the complexity of the 
privatization process.  Once it is privatized, however, it 
too is slated to move to MOF control.  The other exception is 
Taiwan\'s public water utility.  Under the reorganization 
proposal, it will move from the Ministry of Economic Affairs 
to the new Ministry of Natural Resources where it will stay 
as long as it remains public.  Taiwan is undecided as to 
whether it will privatize its public water utility at any 
time. 
 
14. (SBU) MOF is also proposing that it be given the 
authority to sell SOE equity shares and to appoint new board 
directors and major executives of SOEs.  Premier Yu Shyi-kun 
has instructed the MOF to study the feasibility of setting up 
state-owned financial holding companies to centralize the 
ownership of all state-owned enterprises.  AIT asked Yeh if 
the planned consolidation of all SOEs under MOF is a 
precursor to privatizing them all.  Yeh said that, at this 
time, it was simply a plan to put one government agency in 
charge of all government property. 
 
15. (SBU) Comment. Many ministries are strongly opposed to 
giving up their authority over SOEs currently under their 
supervision, particularly those SOEs that are profitable such 
as Taipower and the Chinese Petroleum Corporation (both 
currently under the Ministry of Economic Affairs). 
Consolidation of the SOEs under MOF would have little impact 
on their day-to-day operations and most SOEs face eventual 
privatization even under the current arrangement.  It appears 
therefore that the issue is more turf, personnel, and perks 
than economics.  Due to the resistance, the consolidation is 
highly controversial and is facing significant opposition in 
the LY.  It could undermine successful LY passage of the 
entire reorganization package.  End Comment. 
 
Ministry of Economic and Trade Affairs 
-------------------------------------- 
 
16. (SBU) Yeh gave a brief explanation about the 
reorganization of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) 
into the Ministry of Economic and Trade Affairs (MOETA).  He 
explained that the new ministry would put economic affairs 
under a single authority and that the MOETA would ensure that 
economic and trade affairs were implemented in accordance 
with WTO regulations.  The MOETA would be responsible for: 
industries, commerce, trade investment, intellectual 
property, standards and inspection, energy, medium and small 
businesses, science-based industrial parks, and business 
start up counseling.  Under the plan, in addition to MOEA 
losing control of the State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) 
including Taiwan Power, Taiwan Sugar and China Petroleum, the 
Board of Foreign Trade also would be downgraded from a Bureau 
to a Department and the Administration of the science parks 
would move from the National Science Council to the new 
MOETA. 
 
Policy Planning Function 
------------------------ 
 
17. (SBU) Under the reorganization the government\'s three 
primary research, development and strategic planning 
councils, the Council on Economic Planning and Development 
(CEPD), the National Science Council (NSC) and the Research, 
Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) Council would 
all be incorporated into the Council for National Development 
and Technology.  Currently, the three Councils are 
independent. CEPD provides policy guidance on Economic 
issues; NSC provides policy guidance on science issues and 
RDEC provides policy guidance on social issues.  As the 
distinctions between these fields are often indistinct, the 
goal is to combine all three into one council to improve 
cross-sectoral policy planning. 
 
Nuclear Commission 
------------------ 
 
18. (SBU) While many of the current regulatory bodies would 
remain independent, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) would 
not.  Under the new plan it would be placed under the 
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources.  Yeh claimed 
that putting nuclear regulatory agencies under Environment 
Protection Agencies was the wave of the future and that 
Taiwan\'s decision was based on the German model. (Comment. 
Taiwan, like Germany, has committed to a nuclear-free energy 
policy.  Minister Yeh is in charge of both Taiwan\'s 
governmental reorganization and making Taiwan nuclear free. 
The decision to place AEC under the Environmental Ministry 
may be part of the overall plan to rid Taiwan of nuclear 
energy (see Reftel B).  End Comment). 
 
Status of Project 
----------------- 
 
19. (SBU) The LY passed a \"Central Government Agency 
Organizational Basis Law\" committing to government 
reorganization in general terms on June 11, 2004.  The 
president then promulgated that law on June 23, 2004. 
Currently, the following three bills to implement the law are 
pending in the LY: 
1) a bill to amend the Executive Yuan (EY) organization law 
to reorganize the EY as outlined in paras 5-9; 
2) a bill to amend the Central Government overall staffing 
law, which proposes to reduce the overall number of 
government employees from 198,000 to 185,000 over six years 
(RDEC claims this would be done through attrition and hiring 
freezes-- not by a reduction in force, but press reports 
indicate otherwise as they disclose federal employee protests 
against proposed staffing cuts); and 
3) a bill to provide provisional authorization for movement 
of budgets, assets and staff during the transitional period 
of implementation of the reorganization (before all of the 
rules to implement the more detailed restructuring of each 
individual ministry\'s are finalized and approved). 
 
 
20. All of the EY ministries have already drawn up plans for 
implementing the proposed reorganization.  If the LY approves 
the three reorganization bills, they would be implemented on 
January 1, 2006. 
 
Optimistic About Prospects 
-------------------------- 
 
21. (SBU) Yeh was quite optimistic about the chances of these 
three bills passing this session.  He indicated that there is 
strong bipartisan support for the bills.  Yeh believes that 
all parties are committed to making the reorganization a 
reality.  He said part of his optimism was based on the fact 
that the KMT Vice President of the LY, P.K. Chiang, has 
pledged his support for the reorganization.  Press reports 
also indicate that top business leaders are supporting prompt 
approval of the bill. 
 
Comment: Hurdles Remain 
----------------------- 
 
22. (SBU) Yeh\'s confidence in the smooth passage of the 
reorganization bills is likely overly optimistic.  This 
reorganization is massive, many details are unclear and 
serious challenges remain.  If the past is any indication, 
change will not come easily.  The last eight Premiers have 
each tried to phase out Taiwan\'s Youth Affairs Council, which 
most Taiwan citizens are not aware exists and most who are 
familiar with agree serves little useful purpose. 
Nonetheless, largely due to the Youth Affairs Council 
employee opposition, no Premier, including Premier Yu, has 
had success in phasing out this small and rather 
inconsequential commission. 
 
23. (SBU) Other hurdles also remain.  First, with only a few 
weeks remaining in this LY session, the ruling and opposition 
parties have yet to work out their differences on their top 
priority, the 2005 central budget.  Furthermore, seemingly 
less controversial bills such as the bill to increase funding 
for the financial reconstruction fund have run into a 
political deadlock.  In addition, Premier Yu is also hoping 
for LY passage of several economic bills and Free Trade Zone 
legislation.  Premier Yu still might decide to hold off on 
pushing the reorganization bills in favor of some of his 
other priority bills.  Any bills that have not passed a first 
reading during this LY session will need to be resubmitted 
from scratch in the next session.  Premier Yu is expected to 
step down before the next LY session.  It is not clear the 
next Premier will take the initiative to resubmit bills not 
passed this session.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
 
A) \"Charter Flights for the Chinese New Year - Both 
Sides of the Taiwan Strait Interact to Get What They 
Want\" 
 
Journalist Chu Chien-ling said in the centrist, pro- 
status quo \"China Times: (1/10): 
 
\". To view the matter from a deeper perspective, even 
though those who are in charge on both sides of the 
Taiwan Strait did not talk about it directly, the 
subtle position held by the United States in cross- 
Strait interactions must have been one of the major 
factors behind the fact that the authorities on both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait are willing to put aside 
their political concerns and have chosen to push for 
the charter flights for the Chinese New Year.  Over the 
past year, Washington\'s cross-Strait policy has been 
evidently tilting toward China.  For Beijing, political 
dialogue across the Taiwan Strait is not viable for the 
time being as a result of the DPP\'s advocacy for Taiwan 
independence.  But to actively promote charter flights 
for the Chinese New Year - an attempt that may lead to 
realization of the three-links across the Taiwan Strait 
- can at least demonstrate the non-political, mild and 
rational aspects of Beijing\'s Taiwan policy and thereby 
win the United States\' recognition.  For the DPP, 
President Chen Shui-bian\'s remarks on [Taiwan\'s] new 
constitution and name change plan during the 2004 
parliamentary campaign have seriously upset the U.S. 
authorities, who regarded such remarks as an attempt to 
destroy the status quo of the Taiwan Strait.  The DPP 
will lose U.S. support if it fails to alleviate cross- 
Strait tension in a short period of time.  This is 
something that the DPP government is aware of and 
contemplating. .\" 
 
B) \"Relationship Between Taipei, Washington Needs 
Nurturing\" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
\"China Post\" editorialized (1/10): 
 
\". Official Taipei tends to believe its relations with 
Washington won\'t turn sour no matter what it does, 
except declaring independence.  That\'s why [Taipei\'s 
representative in Washington David] Lee meant to say 
those `slips of the tongue\' [i.e. recent remarks by 
Secretary of State Colin Powell and Deputy Secretary of 
 
SIPDIS 
State Richard Armitage on Taiwan] were no warnings of a 
change in relations between Taiwan and the United 
States. 
 
\"Perhaps they are not warnings.  The fact, however, 
remains that Washington was irritated by what President 
Chen Shui-bian had said and done during the long 2004 
parliamentary campaign.  This loose cannon must have 
frustrated the United States.  His promise to give 
Taiwan a new Constitution, for instance, was an attempt 
to change unilaterally the status quo as Washington 
defines it.  He wanted to call all missions abroad, 
including that of Lee\'s in Washington, Taiwan offices. 
Wasn\'t it only natural for some American officials to 
vent their pent-up frustration when they had a chance? 
 
\"President Chen has been baiting China successfully, 
but he cannot afford to bait the United States.\"

TAGS: MARR, PREL, PGOV, TW 
SUBJECT: LEGISLATIVE YUAN REJECTS DEFENSE SPECIAL BUDGET 
BILL; EXTENDED DELAY LIKELY 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas H. Paal.  Reason: 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  On January 4, the Legislative Yuan (LY) 
once again refused to put the 610.8 billion NT (USD 18 
billion) Defense Special Budget on the LY agenda.  With only 
two weeks remaining, prospects for passage in the current 
session are virtually zero.  The ruling Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) places all blame for the Special 
Budget failure on the post-election political machinations of 
the KMT-led Pan-Blue coalition.  KMT leaders insist they are 
not the obstacle but offer a litany of all questions and 
often misinformation surrounding the Special Budget and 
appear intent on keeping it as a political football.  The DPP 
sees the Special Budget as a perfect opportunity to blacken 
Pan-Blue\'s image as an irresponsible party that ignores 
Taiwan\'s security and defense.  The Special Budget likely 
faces months of political gamesmanship -- although DPP 
legislative leaders promise they will try again tomorrow, 
January 11, and are trying to work out a way for quick 
passage early next session.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) In its regular Tuesday meeting on January 4, the 
Legislative Yuan (LY) Procedural Committee once again -- 
reportedly the fourteenth time -- voted along strictly 
Blue-Green coalition lines against placing the 610.8 billion 
NT (USD 18 billion) Defense Special Budget on the LY agenda. 
Technically, there are two Tuesdays remaining before the end 
of the current LY session on January 21.  However it would be 
extremely difficult for the LY to go through the necessary 
steps required to carry over a draft bill to the next 
legislative session beginning February 1.  A draft bill must 
be approved by a majority of the Procedural Committee, go 
through a first reading on the LY floor, and finally be 
unanimously approved by the relevant LY Committee, in this 
case the Defense Committee, before it can carry over to the 
next session.  Failing this, a draft bill &automatically 
returns to zero8 (zidong guiling), meaning it must be 
reintroduced from scratch by the Executive Yuan in the next 
session that begins February 1. 
 
3.  (C) One other LY procedural requirement not only 
complicates approval in these last two weeks of the current 
session but could cause a long delay upon reintroduction in 
the next session.  According to LY regulations, approval of a 
bill by the relevant committee must be unanimous, otherwise 
the draft bill automatically goes into a four-month 
negotiation period, aptly termed &frozen period.8 
 
DPP Attempts Compromise 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (C) With the odds for Procedural Committee approval 
stacked against the Special Budget at this late date in the 
LY session, Lee Wen-chung, DPP ranking member on the Defense 
Committee and a member of the Procedural Committee, worked 
out a two-part compromise &to show good will8 and elicit 
the votes of Pan-Blue legislators for the Special Budget. 
First, the DPP would agree to split the two parts of the 
special defense package (the &Major Defense Procurement 
Authorization Bill8 and the &Special Budget8), in 
accordance with a long-term demand of Pan-Blue legislators. 
The authorization bill would then be approved and put on the 
present LY session agenda and the government (Executive Yuan) 
would reintroduce the &Special Budget8 in the next session. 
 Second, the government would pledge to cut NT 100 billion 
from the NT 610.8 billion special budget proposal, with the 
&leftover8 100 billion going for social welfare programs. 
Lee told AIT that the 100 billion cut would come from 
eliminating the requirement that the 12 Special Budget 
submarines be manufactured in Taiwan. 
 
5.  (C) The KMT legislators on the Procedural Committee, 
however, voted down the two bills as a package.  At the same 
time the Procedural Committee also rejected the two other 
government proposed bills -- the President,s Control Yuan 
nomination list and the Pan-Green &Defense of the Republic 
of China Bill,8 intended as a response to the PRC,s 
recently announced &Anti-Secession (Draft) Law.8 
 
6.  (C) Vice Minister of National Defense (MND) Michael Tsai 
told AIT on January 6 that both MND and the National Security 
Council (NSC) had endorsed Lee,s compromise.  Lee, however, 
told AIT that the Presidential Office did not follow through 
with sufficient support to persuade Blue legislators to sign 
on to his compromise. 
 
KMT Leaders Dig in Their Heels 
------------------------------ 
 
7.  (C) KMT Legislative Yuan Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang and 
four other KMT leaders discussed the Special Budget stalemate 
with the Deputy Director on January 6.  When the Deputy 
Director noted that negotiations toward the Special Budget 
had begun in the 1990,s under the KMT government, the KMT 
leaders responded that Pan-Blue was not the obstacle.  They 
then proceeded to throw out a grab-bag of most of the 
criticisms of the Special Budget that have been raised (and 
rebutted) in the public arena.  Retired military officer and 
KMT defense specialist Shuai Hua-min, a regular feature on TV 
talk shows, raised only objections to the Special Budget. 
Taiwan, he said, does not know the exact nature of the 
systems in the submarine package and fears the weapons 
systems being sold to Taiwan would be special, dumbed-down 
versions that would become obsolete in a decade of so.  So 
why, he mused, should Taiwan purchase these weapons?  Shuai, 
who has participated in U.S.-Taiwan defense discussions in 
Monterey and discussed the Special Budget with AIT LAS and 
OSD officials, then criticized the DPP government for not 
providing the military with sufficient training.  Until that 
was resolved, he suggested, new systems would be meaningless. 
 
 
8.  (C) Newly-elected KMT legislator Su Chi rehashed the 
argument of one Taiwan aerospace expert who claimed Patriot 
missiles would be virtually useless, because Taiwan would not 
have time to receive warnings from PACOM in order to respond 
to a PRC missile attack (AIT pointed out that the Patriots 
have self-contained radar systems and would also draw on 
warning from Taiwan\'s long-range radar).  The Special Budget 
package, Su continued, was entirely too expensive for Taiwan. 
 He then shifted gears and stated that &many people8 
objected to the Special Budget because they fear the weapon 
systems might be used to further Chen Shui-bian,s 
pro-independence agenda.  Amb. Loh I-cheng (Lu Yi-cheng) 
explained that the KMT must take into consideration the views 
of the &Democratic Alliance,8 which strongly opposes the 
Special Budget and organized the September 26, 2004 
anti-Special Budget demonstration in Taipei. 
 
9.  (C) When the Deputy Director emphasized the high stakes 
of the Defense Special Budget in terms of both cross-Strait 
security and US-Taiwan relations, the KMT leaders, response 
was essentially that until the DPP government resolved the 
domestic political situation, the constitutional issue, and 
Taiwan identity to Pan Blue\'s satisfaction they would not 
move on the Special Budget appropriation. 
 
I Have a Plan, Says Lee Wen-chung 
--------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Lee Wen-chung told AIT that he was not surprised by 
Pan-Blue,s continued boycott of the Special Budget, since 
the coalition had made the Defense Special Budget such a big 
campaign issue.  During the campaign, Blue candidates had 
charged the Special Budget was a waste of money and claimed 
the U.S. was charging Taiwan two to three times higher than 
normal for the weapons systems.  Now, after the election, 
they had to keep their promise and maintain their boycott. 
Lee, however, was miffed that he had not received full or 
sufficient support for his compromise package from the 
Presidential Office. 
 
11.  (C) Lee is working on a second compromise with the 
knowledge -- and, implicitly, support -- of MND, Vice 
Minister Tsai,s Special Assistant York Chen told AIT January 
6.  Lee told AIT that he believes this compromise would get 
the Defense Special Budget approved &within one month8 in 
the next LY session, which begins on February 1.  Lee is 
proposing that the revised Defense Special Budget, to be 
introduced in the LY at the beginning of the next session, be 
slashed by NT 200-250 billion by removing the submarine 
made-in-Taiwan provision (a saving of NT 100 billion) and 
separating out the PAC)3 missiles (another NT 100-150 
billion), shifting them to the regular MND budget.  When AIT 
pointed out that breaking up the carefully calibrated weapons 
package would be problematic for the U.S., Lee responded that 
he hoped for a three percent-plus increase in the annual 
defense budget, which would cover the cost of the missiles 
over three years. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
12.  (C) Introduced in the very early days of the LY 
campaign, the Special Budget stalemate has been almost 
exclusively an outgrowth of the bitter partisan rivalry 
between Blue and Green.  For the opposition Pan Blue, 
security and defense are taking a backseat to politics, as 
the coalition seeks to leverage its unexpected election 
victory into greater influence on both policy and new 
government formation.  The fact that the Pan Blue-controlled 
LY Procedural Committee rejected all three bills proposed by 
the DPP government, while passing three tax relief bills, 
further demonstrates the political nature of the legislative 
stalemate.  But the DPP government shares a large measure of 
responsibility via its less than stellar performance 
explaining the bill to the LY and to the public. 
 
13.  (C) The January 4 vote could effectively delay the 
Special Budget package for a considerable time.  NSC 
Secretary General Chiou I-jen told AIT that any changes to 
 
SIPDIS 
the special appropriation bills, almost inevitable before the 
Executive Yuan would resubmit them to the next LY session, 
would delay re-introduction to the LY by six months or more. 
Unless there is a dramatic change in the political climate 
here, which we do not expect, the Special Budget would then 
return to the LY foodfight on the eve of the LY\'s summer 
recess - a recipe for continued failure.

The pro-independence \"Taiwan Daily\" editorialized 
(1/11): 
 
\". Washington has repeatedly expressed its opposition 
since China said it would enact an `anti-secession 
law,\' because the enactment itself is a concrete action

Washington and the international community the fact 
that China\'s `anti-secession law\' will destroy the

\"Wu has already called upon the world, especially the 
U.S., to strongly oppose Beijing\'s legislative plan 
because it will provide a legal basis for Beijing to 
attack Taiwan and unilaterally change the status quo. 
 
\"But such argument, which is no different from the

In response to reftel, AIT\'s EST section has researched 
Taiwan\'s legal framework for access to genetic resources and 
benefit sharing (abs).  Taiwan is neither a member of the 
United Nations nor a party to the Convention on Biological 
Diversity.  To date, Taiwan also has no laws specifically 
addressing abs issues.  That being said, Taiwan is currently 
looking into establishing abs rules.  Taiwan\'s National 
Science Council (NSC) has engaged several professors and 
experts to research and report on the ethical, legal, and 
social implications of abs. NSC is also planning to work with 
several research institutions to hold a number of workshops 
and symposia over the next few years to consider establishing 
a comprehensive abs legal framework.  In the meantime, 
according to a professor working at Academia Sinica, Taiwan\'s 
premier scientific organization, Taiwan\'s research 
institutions are relying on Taiwan\'s strict endangered 
species laws to protect access to those species.  Academia 
Sinica also encourages foreign researchers to collaborate 
with local scientists when doing research in Taiwan and urges 
those collaborators to return specimens to Taiwan after their 
research is published.

SUBJECT: MA DERIVES POLITICAL BOOST FROM HK VISA FLAP 
 
REF: HONG KONG 00046 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has criticized 
the Hong Kong government for refusing his visa application to 
deliver two speeches and attend a seminar on culture and city 
management at two Hong Kong universities.  A Ma confidant 
told AIT that a close friend of Hong Kong Chief Executive 
Tung Chee-hwa, while visiting Taipei in mid-December, told Ma 
in a private meeting that he had heard there might be some 
problems with securing approval for Ma\'s visa because of Ma\'s 
remarks on the Anti-Secession Law, and suggested that Ma 
should find an excuse to postpone the visit.  Ma refused the 
advice, however, the ensuing drama may actually have boosted 
his popularity among the Taiwan electorate.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on January 4 publicly 
called Hong Kong\'s rejection of his visa application a set 
back for Taiwan-Hong Kong relations.  Ma was scheduled to 
visit Hong Kong January 10-12 to deliver two lectures at the 
University of Hong Kong and attend a seminar on culture and 
city management at the Hong Kong University of Science and 
Technology.  In response to media speculation on January 5 
that Hong Kong had refused his application because of his 
criticisms of the PRC\'s proposed anti-secession law, Ma said 
that Hong Kong had acted unwisely and questioned the 
sincerity of \"One country, two systems.\"  The implication 
that Beijing was behind Hong Kong\'s decision to refuse Ma\'s 
visa was reinforced when the local media reported on January 
7 that Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa had sent 
envoys to Taiwan at the end of 2004 to discourage Ma from 
traveling to Hong Kong because of his statements against the 
anti-secession law. 
 
3. (C) Taipei City Information Department Commissioner Jack 
Yu (Tzu-hsiang) told AIT that just after the Legislation Yuan 
election (LY), Yeh Kuo-hwa, who led a Hong Kong delegation to 
Taiwan to observe the LY election, told Ma in a private 
meeting that he had heard there might be some problems with 
securing approval for Ma\'s visa because of Ma\'s remarks on 
the anti-secession law.  Yeh suggested to Ma that he should 
find an excuse to postpone the visit.  Yu said that Ma was 
not certain whether or not Yeh was authorized by the Hong 
Kong government to convey this message, but because Yeh is 
close to Tung Chee-hwa, Ma could not rule out the 
possibility.  In any case, Yeh said, Ma refused to cancel the 
trip. 
 
4. (C) Yu said the Hong Kong authorities have not formally 
refused Ma\'s visa, rather they simply did not respond.  Yu 
said that he did not know the mechanics of the Hong Kong 
application process, but that he did know the travel agents 
who handled the application had returned Ma\'s application 
without a visa.  Yu noted that while Ma and his Office 
Director Zheng An-guo did not receive their visas, the other 
Taipei City officials scheduled to travel with Ma received 
their Hong Kong visas on January 4.  Yu said that after the 
University of Hong Kong President and the Hong Kong 
coordinator of the trip separately telephoned Ma on January 5 
to apologize, explaining that there might be some problems 
with his visa, Ma decided to go public about the refusal and 
his disappointment with \"One country, two systems.\"  Yu said 
that Ma canceled his January 10 trip and does not intend to 
say anything stronger, but he is still monitoring the 
situation. 
 
5. (C) Speculating on why Ma\'s visa was refused, Yu said the 
PRC authorities fear that Ma might stir up Hong Kong public 
opinion concerning the proposed anti-secession law.  He said 
that if Ma were asked about the law during the course of his 
Hong Kong visit, he would surely have criticized it, which, 
Beijing officials probably feared, might inflame public 
opinion against the proposed law or incite those who would 
object to Ma\'s criticisms of China.  Either way, according to 
Yu, Beijing must have decided that it was not a good timing 
for Ma to visit Hong Kong. 
 
6. (C) Comment: In the complex politics of Taiwan, Ma has 
emerged unscathed and probably helped politically by this 
incident.  Executive Yuan Spokesman Chen Chi-mai on January 5 
publicly defended Ma, saying Taipei would lodge a strong 
protest to Hong Kong if the Special Administrative Region 
authority did not provide a proper explanation on its 
decision to deny Ma\'s visa.  The incident has given China\'s 
critics in Taiwan ammunition against the \"One country, two 
systems,\" a formula most people on Taiwan firmly reject for 
Taiwan.  Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san 
said on January 5 that this sort of treatment is a blow to 
the development of bilateral ties between the two sides of 
the Taiwan Strait.  Hong Kong\'s refusal of his visa 
application might have even give Ma a boost in his effort to 
portray himself as a Taiwan politician.  During the 2002 
Mayoral race, Chen Shui-bian campaigning for Ma\'s DPP 
opponent said that Hong Kong-born Ma had \"Hong Kong feet\" (a 
word play on the Taiwanese term meaning athlete\'s foot), 
implying that Ma would take Taiwan down the path of Hong Kong 
and impose \"One country, two systems\" on Taiwan.  The Taiwan 
electorate loves an underdog, and last week, as he was 
rebuffed by the PRC, Ma seemed an awful lot like one of their 
own.  End Comment.

CHARTER FLIGHTS 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas H. Paal.  Reason: 1.4 (B,D) 
 
Taipei 00043 
 
1.  (C) In response to the high-profile visit by opposition 
Kuomintang (KMT) leaders to Beijing over the last few days to 
discuss cross-strait relations with the Chinese Taiwan 
Affairs Office (TAO), and the announcement of an 
understanding on direct Taiwan-China flights during the 
Chinese New Year, the Taiwan Government is running hard to 
catch up and regain the lead on cross-Strait negotiations. 
Taiwan government officials dismiss the KMT visit as useless 
and call for a \"second round\" of China-Taiwan charter flight 
negotiations based on a \"first round\" reportedly held last 
Friday in Macao.  Taiwan, however, insists that future 
negotiations must include Taiwan government officials, 
otherwise Taiwan will fall back to \"Plan B\" -- resurrecting 
the Spring 2003 modus operandi by which Taiwan airlines 
applied for, and received, permission to fly charter flights 
to Mainland Chinese cities. 
 
2.  (C) Taiwan,s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice 
Chairman Chiu Tai-san announced at a press conference on 
January 10 that Taiwan and Mainland China representatives had 
met last Friday, January 7, in Macao to negotiate on 
cross-strait charter flights around the Chinese New Year, 
February 9.  The negotiations, he said, were based on the 
three principals of two-way, reciprocal, and direct 
(non-stopover) flights.  He expressed the hope that a \"second 
round\" of bilateral discussions would be held \"as soon as 
possible,\" which should be based on the \"2002 Hong Kong 
model\" by which Hong Kong and Taiwan had worked out a flight 
agreement.  The rest of the day, MAC officials remained 
incommunicado and unresponsive to AIT queries because, as one 
MAC staffer candidly told us, they were \"sitting in front of 
the television\" watching reports from Beijing of the KMT 
delegation visit. 
 
3. (C)  MAC Chairman Joseph Wu told AIT on January 11 that 
the Taiwan government had authorized Taipei Airlines 
Association (TAA) Chairman Michael Lo to present its charter 
flight proposal on air routes, number of flights, airline 
companies, airports, and security issues to Chinese 
representatives in Macao.  The Chinese side responded, he 
said, that they would study the Taiwan proposals.  Wu hailed 
the Macao talks as \"a significant step forward\" because 
Chinese officials had met directly with Taiwan government 
officials in the TAA delegation, indicating that China will 
now meet with Taiwan government officials.  Future 
negotiations, which he termed the \"second round,\" must 
proceed on the basis of the 2002 \"Hong Kong model\" (the 
negotiations between Hong Kong and Taiwan on reciprocal air 
services.  TAA can lead the delegation \"as a front for 
government officials\" in the delegation. 
 
4.  (C) Wu insisted that the KMT negotiations in Beijing 
meant \"nothing at all.\"  Taiwan is working to ensure that the 
Chinese side will talk directly with Taiwan officials, but 
the KMT undermined that effort, he lamented bitterly, by 
publicly stating there was no need for government officials 
to be involved and even that there was, in fact, no need for 
negotiations.  The Chinese offer to expand the number of 
airports for direct charter flights to include Taichung, 
moerover, was \"fake,\" he argued, because China knew full well 
this was a non-starter for security reasons (Note: presumably 
the large Taiwan Air Force base in Taichung. End Note). 
Rather, China must negotiate directly with Taiwan based on 
the Hong Kong model, otherwise Taiwan will fall back on \"Plan 
B,\" using the Chinese New Year 2003 model in which only 
Taiwan air carriers flew to the mainland. 
 
5.  (C) Comment.  With the Monday meeting between the KMT 
delegation led by LY members Tseng Yung-chuan and Chang 
Hsiao-yen and PRC officials, the next move is clearly 
Taiwan,s, specifically Taiwan,s DPP government.  Some 
technical considerations remain to be worked out, including 
whether or not the flights will have to pass through a third 
territory,s airspace, the participation of Chinese airlines, 
and whether passengers will be restricted to Taiwan 
businesspeople in the PRC.  But the key issue comes down to a 
single question -- how badly does the DPP want to negotiate 
these details in formal meetings that include government 
officials? 
 
6.  (C) Beijing and the KMT delegation have forced the DPP 
government,s hand by offering charter flights that meet most 
of both sides, demands.  However, the PRC is prepared to 
move forward based only on consultations between Taiwan and 
PRC airline associations that would exclude officials.  The 
Taiwan government had tried to keep the upper hand by 
maneuvering the PRC into a position where it would have to 
turn down Taiwan,s offer for charter flights after bilateral 
consultations or accept Taiwan\'s \"officiality,\" but appears 
to have been outmaneuvered itself. 
 
7.  (C) The cross-Strait charter flights have become totally 
enmeshed in Taiwan,s post-election domestic politics between 
the DPP and its main opposition party, the KMT.   The DPP 
government is between a rock and a hard place.  If it accepts 
the PRC-KMT offer, it will forego what now appears to be one 
of the primary political goals of the charter flight exercise 
-- bilateral meetings between PRC and Taiwan officials 
(without official status, but with official sanction).  It 
will also hand a major political victory to the KMT, which 
will be able to claim credit for the flights and cast the DPP 
as a party unable to improve cross-Strait relations.  If the 
government turns down the offer, it will help the KMT portray 
the DPP as the cause of increasing cross-Strait tension.  The 
pro-independence TSU has been highly critical of the KMT move 
bypassing the government, but with the prospects of 
successful charter flights this criticism may not resonate 
with Taiwan,s political center.

LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL CRIMES 
 
REF: 2004 STATE 254401 
 
1.  AIT 2004-2005 PART II INCSR Responses follow: 
 
2. Taiwan is not considered an important regional or 
offshore financial center.  Money laundering in Taiwan is 
not generally related to narcotics trafficking.   Most 
illegal or unregulated financial activities are done to 
avoid taxes or conceal financial flows to and from third 
countries.  There is no indication that local drug 
trafficking organizations or terrorist groups control money- 
laundering proceeds. 
 
3. In 2004 Taiwan experienced an increase in financial 
crimes involving graft by some company executives in high- 
tech industries.  There is no indication that contraband 
smuggling generates funds laundered through the banking 
system.  There has been no indication of Taiwan policy, 
official encouragement, or facilitation of laundering 
proceeds from illegal drug transactions or terrorist 
financing.  It is unlikely that Taiwan\'s legal financial 
institutions would engage in currency transactions involving 
international narcotics trafficking proceeds. 
 
Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing Laws and Regulations 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
4. Money laundering is a criminal offense under Taiwan\'s 
Money Laundering Prevention Law (MLPL).  MLPL covers 
counterfeit securities, counterfeit credit cards, fraud and 
usury, underground banking, bankruptcy fraud, embezzlement 
from banking institutions, corrupt government contracting 
and procurement, insider trading, and manipulation of 
securities trading, trafficking of children, abduction, 
weapons manufacture and sale, smuggling, and drug 
trafficking.  Banks and other financial institutions are 
required to record and report the identity of customers 
engaging in transactions of NT$ 1 million (about US$30 
thousand) or more.  Financial agencies are required to keep 
records of all significant transactions for five years. 
 
5. According to Taiwan\'s Financial Supervisory Commission 
(FSC), financial institutions are required to report all 
cash transactions of at least NT$ 1 million and any cases 
where there are indications of money laundering to the Money 
Laundering Prevention Center (MLPC).  Such reports are 
confidential and protected by specific provisions in the 
 
SIPDIS 
MLPL.  MLPC officials are authorized to require domestic and 
offshore financial entities to disclose client and ownership 
information.  Individual bankers can be fined NT$ 200,000- 
NT$ 1 million (about US$ 6,000-30,000) for not following the 
MLPL. 
 
6. The money laundering controls also apply to trust and 
investment companies, credit cooperative associations, 
credit departments of farmers\' and fishermen\'s associations, 
postal savings systems, insurance companies, securities 
firms, and consulting companies, futures brokers, jewelry 
stores, casinos, automobile dealers, aircraft dealers, 
merchant ship dealers and real estate brokers. 
 
Crime Statistics 
---------------- 
 
7. From January-September 2004 (the most recent figures 
available), Taiwan investigated 505 cases of possible money 
laundering.   Among these cases, 442 were economic crimes, 
seven involved government corruption, and seven were 
narcotics-related crimes.  Total money laundering January- 
September amounted to NT$ 1,244 million (about US$ 38 
million).  Of the 505 cases investigated, 287 cases involved 
money laundering via bank transactions, 213 cases via postal 
remittances and savings banks, and one case via a credit 
union.  Taiwan\'s financial institutes and banker 
associations, political parties, and other affected 
organization have not expressed any objection to the money 
laundering prevention laws. 
 
8. Taiwan\'s draft \"Counter-Terrorism Action Law\" (CTAL), 
which designates terrorism financing as a major crime is 
still pending legislative approval.  Under CTAL provisions, 
the National Police Administration, the Ministry of Justice 
Investigation Bureau (MJIB), and the Coast Guard are able to 
seize the suspected terrorist assets even before criminal 
charges are made.  In emergency situations, law enforcement 
agencies would be able to freeze assets for three days 
without a court order.  Assets and income obtained from 
committing terrorist crimes could be confiscated permanently 
unless such assets and income can be identified as belonging 
to the victims of the crimes.  Taiwan officials have the 
authority to freeze and/or seize terrorist-related financial 
assets. 
 
9. The Bureau of Monetary Affairs (BOMA) of the FSC has 
circulated lists of individuals and entities identified by 
the UN 1267 Sanction Committee and provided by the U.S. to 
domestic and foreign financial institutions in Taiwan. 
Taiwan and the U.S. have established procedures to exchange 
records concerning suspicious terrorist financial 
activities.   After receiving financial terrorist lists from 
AIT, BOMA conveys the list to relevant financial 
institutions. 
 
10. Domestic and international financial information 
including terrorist and money laundering lists are available 
on the MLPL internet website.  Banks are required to file a 
report on cash remittances of at least NT$ 1 million or if 
the remittor/remittee is on a terrorist list.  Foreign labor 
brokers are authorized to remit income earned by foreign 
workers via banks to their home countries.  These 
remittances are not regulated or reported, and money- 
laundering regulations are not imposed on these foreign 
labor brokers.  At present, there are no plans to probe 
charitable or non-profit entities to see if they serve as 
conduits for financing of terrorism.  These entities must 
register with official agencies. 
 
11. Taiwan is not a party to the 1999 International 
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of 
Terrorism, but complies with its provisions. 
 
Offshore Financial Centers 
-------------------------- 
 
12. All foreign financial institutions and offshore banking 
units follow the same regulations as domestic financial 
entities.  All offshore banks, international business 
companies, and shell companies need to comply with the 
disclosure regulations from Taiwan\'s Central Bank of China 
(CBC), BOMA, and MLPC.  These supervisory agencies will 
conduct background checks on applicants for banking and 
business licenses.  Offshore casinos or internet gambling 
sites are illegal. 
 
Free-Trade-Zones 
---------------- 
 
13. Taiwan\'s only free trade zone began operation in Keelung 
on October 1, 2004.  Entities wanting to operate in the free 
trade zones must submit applications to the port 
authorities.  Entities can conduct simple processing of 
commodities in the zone and re-export them without 
inspection by customs.  There is no indication that the zone 
is used in money-laundering schemes or by financers of 
terrorism.  Keelung port authority has a panel composed of 
members from various enforcement agencies to conduct checks 
of commodities, transportation, and accounting.  According 
to Taiwan\'s Banking Law and Securities Trading Law, in order 
for financial institutions to conduct foreign currency 
operations Taiwan\'s Central Bank must first approve the 
institution to conduct foreign-currency operations.  The 
financial institutions must then submit an application to 
port authorities to establish an offshore banking unit in 
the free trade zone. 
 
International Cooperation 
------------------------- 
 
14. Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations and 
therefore cannot be a party to the UN International 
Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances or other UN agreements and 
conventions.  However, Taiwan abides by the provisions of 
those conventions.  Taiwan is a member of the Egmont Group 
and the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) adheres 
to regulations/recommendations from other international 
groups including the Financial Action Task Force on Money 
Laundering (FATF).  Where necessary, Taiwan has amended its 
regulations to meet international standards. 
15. The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office 
(TECRO) and the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) signed a 
Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAA) in March 2002. 
This agreement remains the primary avenue of law enforcement 
cooperation in regards to investigations of narcotics 
trafficking, counter-terrorism issue, including terrorist 
financing, and other transnational crimes. 
 
Asset Forfeiture and Seizure Legislation 
---------------------------------------- 
16. Taiwan has established drug-related asset seizure and 
forfeiture regulations, which state that according to 
treaties or agreements Taiwan\'s Ministry of Justice shall 
share seized assets with foreign official agencies, private 
institutions or international parties who provide Taiwan 
with assistance in investigations/enforcements.  Assets of 
drug traffickers, including instruments of crime and 
intangible property, can be seized along with legitimate 
businesses used to launder money.  The injured parties can 
be compensated with seized assets.  The Ministry of Justice 
distributes other seized assets to the prosecutor\'s office, 
police, or other anti-money laundering agencies.  The law 
does not allow for civil forfeiture. 
 
17. In January-September 2004, total seized assets reached 
NT$ 20 million (about US$ 660,000).  To prevent money 
laundering and other serious crimes, Taiwan works with the 
financial intelligence units of other countries on asset 
tracing, freezing, and seizure.  Taiwan\'s banking community 
and public have been supportive of Taiwan authorities\' 
enforcement efforts.

SUBJECT: LIEN CHAN ON SPECIAL BUDGET, CROSS-STRAIT, AND PFP 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Douglas Paal, Reason: 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  KMT Chairman Lien Chan told AIT Director on 
December 12 that the KMT Legislative Yuan (LY) caucus intends 
to pass half (approximately USD nine billion) of the USD 18 
billion as soon as the legislation is resubmitted in the next 
LY session, beginning February 1.  On the cross-Strait Lunar 
New Year charter flights, Lien gave credit to the KMT 
delegation that traveled to Beijing to meet with the Taiwan 
Affairs Office for \"paving the way\" for further discussions 
between Taiwan and PRC representatives, and said he is ninety 
percent certain direct flights will be implemented.  On the 
media speculation of DPP cooperation with the People First 
Party (PFP), Lien said that the DPP has a strategic interest 
in promoting the rumors, but that he is certain the Pan-Blue 
alliance will remain intact.  End Summary. 
 
Special Defense Budget 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) KMT Chairman Lien told AIT Director in a December 12 
meeting that the KMT is committed to maintaining a viable 
military capability for Taiwan and that reports that the KMT 
opposes to arms procurement are misleading.  Lien did say, 
however, that the KMT objects to the DPP\'s submission of the 
Special Budget and the Special Budget Authorization Bill as a 
package.  Lien pointed out that the requirement for separate 
legislation authorizing a Special Budget was a feature that 
the DPP pressed to be enacted in 1996. 
 
3. (C) Asserting that there is not enough time for action in 
this LY session, Lien then conveyed the intention of the KMT 
LY caucus to pass half (approximately USD nine billion) of 
the USD 18 billion as soon as the legislation is resubmitted 
in the next LY session, beginning February 1.  After a quick 
telephone call to KMT LY caucus leader Tseng Yung-chuan, Lien 
told the Director that there is no need for a six-month delay 
in resubmission by the Executive Yuan (EY), as National 
Security Council Secretary General Chiou I-jen contended in 
previous conversations with AIT.  Rather, Lien said that if 
the EY accepts the Ministry of National Defense\'s 
recommendation to separate the authorization and spending 
bills, the KMT will cooperate to pass the bill in the first 
week of February.  He noted that the KMT would support PAC-3, 
P-3, and other acquisitions, leaving an additional 
approximately USD one billion for purchases of needed 
ammunitions such as Standard missiles for Kidd destroyers and 
AMRAAMs for the Taiwan Air Force.  While the submarines are 
desirable, Lien explained, eight at one time is too many for 
Taiwan to handle.  Since it was the KMT that had originally 
proposed purchasing the submarines, he continued, the party 
did not want to be seen as opposing it, so would instead 
advocate buying piecemeal. 
 
Cross-Strait Chartered Flights 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) On the cross-Strait Lunar New Year charter flights, 
Lien credited the KMT delegation that traveled to Beijing to 
meet with the PRC\'s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) with \"paving 
the way\" for further discussions between Taiwan and PRC 
representatives.  Lien told the AIT Director that the KMT 
decided to get involved in the issue because many Taishang 
(Taiwan businessmen working in the PRC) complained to the KMT 
that the DPP government had made no progress.  He said that 
after receiving a positive response from the TAO welcoming 
the KMT\'s involvement, KMT Legislator John Chang (Hsiao-yen) 
led a delegation to meet with TAO Director Chen Yunlin on 
January 10.  Lien said that he was 90 percent certain that 
the proposals negotiated between Chen and the KMT delegation, 
including direct reciprocal flights between the Mainland and 
Taiwan servicing multiple routes, would be implemented in 
time for the Lunar New Year.  Lien said he hoped the DPP 
would not obstruct the KMT\'s accomplishment by politicizing 
the charter flight issue. 
 
5. (C) Lien told the Director that when the KMT briefed the 
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on the talks between the KMT 
delegation and the TAO, MAC officials insisted they would 
follow the \"Hong Kong Model\" for negotiations (i.e., in which 
MAC officials had been members of the Taiwan negotiating team 
nominally headed by an airline industry official).  Lien said 
the Hong Kong formula is not necessarily the ideal model, for 
if Taiwan is independent and sovereign, then why should it be 
downgraded to Hong Kong\'s status.  In passing, he criticized 
the 2002 \"Hong Kong model,\" arguing that it was not 
appropriate for Taiwan national officials to have been 
negotiating with mere Hong Kong municipal authorities.  Lien 
concluded by stating that since the LY election the KMT has 
concluded that it should play a more active role in 
cross-Strait affairs, even  taking the lead in areas where 
the government cannot. 
 
Rumors of DPP-PFP Cooperation 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Commenting on the media speculation of DPP cooperation 
with the People First Party (PFP), Lien told the AIT Director 
that the DPP has nothing to lose in promoting the rumors.  If 
the DPP were to succeed in courting the PFP, the DPP would 
gain a working LY majority and effectively divide the 
Pan-Blue, Lien explained, however, he is certain the Pan-Blue 
will stand fast.  Lien said that before PFP Chairman James 
Soong departed Taiwan he assured him that although KMT-PFP 
merger is not possible in the immediate future, the PFP will 
continue to cooperate with the KMT.  Soong had told Lien that 
on the premise that the DPP government is responsible for 
safeguarding the ROC, he would consider cooperating with the 
DPP on specific issues involving the people\'s livelihood. 
Lien also stated that Soong told him the PFP would support 
Wang Jin-pyng for LY Speaker in exchange for the KMT 
supporting a PFP member for Vice Speaker.  Lien noted that 
although Chen Shui-bian has suffered a setback in the LY 
election, Chen\'s policy direction will not change. 
Therefore, Lien argued, it is in the interest of Taiwan, and 
the U.S., to have a viable opposition alliance. 
 
Comment: Emerging from Post Election Haze? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Since the March 2004 presidential election, Lien 
focused almost exclusively on the Pan-Blue\'s challenge of the 
presidential election result, first in the streets, then in 
the courts, to the detriment of other party affairs.  Lien 
was not fully involved in the KMT LY campaign effort.  KMT 
Vice Chairman Vincent Siew told AIT that many LY members in 
Central and Southern Taiwan did not want Lien to stump for 
them.  The KMT\'s unexpected success in the LY election 
appears to have reinvigorated Lien, who did not hesitate to 
step back into the limelight.  So far, however, Lien has only 
used the KMT\'s victory to oppose the DPP, showing few signs 
that he has even begun to address the many internal problems 
in the Pan-Blue alliance.

SUBJECT:  CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS:  ONE STEP FORWARD

1.  (C) Summary.  According to Taiwan\'s Mainland Affairs 
Council (MAC), Beijing this afternoon, January 13,  accepted 
Taiwan\'s proposed delegation to participate in negotiations 
on direct cross-Strait charter flights around the Chinese New 
Year.  At this still early point in the negotiation process, 
both sides have actually made small concessions -- Beijing by 
apparently accepting the presence of Taiwan government 
aviation officials in the Taiwan delegation, and Taiwan by 
pulling back from its adamant insistence that Taiwanese 
officials responsible for cross-Strait relations be included 
in the Taiwan delegation.  In the face of growing Taiwan 
public hopes for a charter flight deal in time for the 
Chinese New Year, and of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) 
demonstration that its delegation to Beijing successfully 
worked out arrangements for charter flights, the DPP 
government had been forced to accept Beijing and the KMT\'s 
agenda, and received a small concession from the PRC in 
return.  End Summary. 
 
Taiwan Twice Responds 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Taiwan twice responded to the PRC Taiwan Affairs 
Office (TAO) call for what Taiwan calls the \"second round\" of 
negotiations, the \"first round\" being a meeting in Macao last 
Friday, January 7, that MAC Chairman Joseph Wu insisted to 
AIT had been \"very successful\" in setting the framework for 
further negotiations.  Chen Chung-hsin, Counselor responsible 
for cross-strait relations at the National Security Council 
(NSC), told AIT on January 11, that the government had 
authorized Taipei Airline Association (TAA) Director Michael 
Lo (Lo Ta-hsin) to transmit a proposed Taiwan five-person 
delegation list to Beijing consisting of:  TAA Director 
Michael Lo, another airline industry representative, the 
Chief of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA, under the 
Communication and Transportation Ministry), and one official 
each from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF).  Explaining that he is a 
\"pragmatist\" who just wants to get charter flights moving, 
Chen said he had cautioned his \"colleagues\" that the MAC and 
SEF officials would be automatically rejected by TAO.  That, 
he noted, is exactly what happened, as the TAO spokesman 
announced in a press conference in Beijing yesterday, January 
12. 
 
3.  (C) That same afternoon, Chen said, the Taiwan government 
worked out a new delegation list consisting of Michael Lo, 
CAA Director Chang Kuo-cheng, one CAA staffer, and Mr. Lo\'s 
Chief Secretary, which NSC Secretary-General Chiou I-jen 
approved and which Michael Lo transmitted to his PRC CAA 
counterpart in Beijing.  Chen felt reasonably confident that 
this second list would be acceptable to Beijing, because, he 
said, the TAO spokesman in Beijing had replied to a 
reporter,s query on whether all Taiwan government officials 
would be unacceptable to Beijing by clarifying that he had 
only mentioned MAC and SEF. 
 
4.  (C) This afternoon, January 13, Joseph Wu called AIT to 
say that Taiwan had just received a positive response from 
Beijing, accepting Taiwan\'s revised delegation proposal. 
Shortly afterward, NSC Counselor Chen called to convey the 
same messagae, clearly delighted by the outcome and proud of 
his part in it.  The Taiwan side, Wu told AIT, had made one 
last ditch effort to get a MAC economist included in the 
delegation, but Beijing had refused.  Wu stated the two sides 
are working out the details of meeting time and place, which 
he hopes will take place this weekend.  Final details will be 
announced at a government-wide -- MAC, NSC, MND, and Ministry 
of Transport and Communications -- press conference tomorrow 
afternoon, January 14, at 5:00 p.m. 
 
Way Forward 
----------- 
 
5.  (C) In his meeting with AIT, Chen appeared more flexible 
on the issue of Taiwan government participation in charter 
flight negotiations than MAC Chair Joseph Wu.  In public and 
to AIT in private, Wu has continued to insist that Taiwan 
will only negotiate with China on charter flights according 
to the \"Hong Kong model\" (the 2002 air service agreement 
between Hong Kong and Taiwan by delegations nominally headed 
by airline industry officials, but with all substantive 
negotiations done by government officials from both sides). 
Chen, however, supported revision of the proposed Taiwan 
delegation list, explaining to AIT that the \"Hong Kong model\" 
could be used for subsequent expanded cross-strait air 
service negotiations.  President Chen, he told AIT, had 
approved of this graduated negotiation process, the third 
stage of which would be negotiation on the \"three links\" 
(commodity, transport, and post).   At the present stage, he 
explained, charter flights are the \"critical key\" on which 
future progress depends.  First, he said, we must reduce 
cross-Strait tensions. 
 
6.  (C) Chen told AIT that the DPP government was having to 
tread very carefully on the cross-Strait issue, as many of 
its supporters were hostile to any concessions on 
negotiations with China.  \"Liberty Times,\" he noted, 
represented that contingent and functioned as a major 
restraint on the Government,s freedom of action.  Chen, 
however, was just as dismissive of the KMT delegation to 
Beijing as Joseph Wu and other DPP leaders.  The KMT trip, 
Chen charged bitterly, constituted Chinese government 
intervention to help the KMT, which allowed itself to be used 
by China.  He was particularly incensed at the claims by the 
KMT that the charter flight issue had been resolved by the 
KMT delegation to Beijing (see septel report on KMT Chairman 
Lien Chan,s meeting with the Director). 
 
 
Comment 
------ 
 
7.  (C) The charter flight issue is playing out against the 
backdrop of  Taiwan,s bitter post-elections politics in the 
run up to the formation of the new government (i.e., 
Executive Yuan).  The KMT delegation visit to Beijing and 
subsequent KMT claims that it successfully negotiated a 
charter flight deal forced the Taipei government to move and 
necessitated the Taiwan government\'s small but significant 
back step on delegation composition.  Beijing saved Taipei 
some face by agreeing to two non-mainland related officials 
in the Taiwan delegation.  This is better news than AIT is 
used to.
