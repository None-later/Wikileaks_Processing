SUBJECT:  DISSIDENT FARC GROUP ATTACKS COLOMBIAN 
          NAVY BOAT 
 
1.  ON JANUARY 14 A DISSIDENT COLUMN OF FARC GUERRILLAS 
ATTACKED A COLOMBIAN NAVY BOAT ON PATROL IN THE 
MAGDALENA RIVER, SOUTH OF BARRANCABERMEJA IN 
SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, 
THREE MARINES WERE KILLED AND THREE OTHERS WOUNDED. 
THE NAVY BOAT WAS FIRED UPON BY APPROXIMATELY 20 
MEN ARMED WITH MORTARS AND SUB-MACHINE GUNS. 
- 
2.  MILITARY SOURCES INDICATED TO REPORTERS THAT 
FOUR NAVY BOATS WERE EN ROUTE TO ECOPETROL 
INSTALLATIONS IN THE TOWN OF CASABLE TO REFUEL AND 
THEN WERE TO CONTINUE PATROLLING THE MAGDALENA RIVER 
WHEN THE SURPRISE STRIKE OCCURRED.  THE MASKED 
GUERRILLAS ATTACKED FROM SPEEDBOATS AND THEN 
FLED DOWN RIVER, AFTER SEIZING ARMS FROM SOME OF 
THE NAVY BOATS. 
- 
3.  THE SAILORS IDENTIFIED THE GUERRILLAS AS 
MEMBERS OF THE FARC.  THE BOGOTA PAPER \"EL TIEMPO\" 
REPORTED HAVING RECEIVED A COMMUNIQUE FROM THE 
DISSIDENT RICARDO FRANCO FRONT WHICH PROCLAIMED 
THE FRONT\'S INTENTION TO CONTINUE ARMED COMBAT. 
- 
4.  COMMENT:  THIS IS THE LATEST AND MOST VIOLENT 
OF SEVERAL RECENT INCIDENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN 
VARIOUSLY ATTRIBUTED TO ELN AND FARC GUERRILLAS. 
END COMMENT. 
- 
5.  DAO COMMENT:  THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR INCIDENT IN 
THE RELATIVELY QUIET MAGDALENA MEDIO REGION IN SEVERAL 
MONTHS.  IT IS ALSO THE FIRST TIME THAT THE INSURGENTS 
HAVE ATTACKED THE MARINE CORPS/NAVY PATROL BOATS 
WITH SUCH BRUTALITY AND IMPUNITY.  AFTER CORINTO 
THE GENERAL TREND IN THE MOST RECENT GUERRILLA/TERRORIST 
ACTS IS TO PLACE THE BLAME ON FARC DISSIDENT GROUPS 
OR THE PROSCRIBED ELN--WHILE THE PEACE PROCESS MOVES 
ON OVER VERY SHAKY GROUNDS.  END DAO COMMENT.

SUBJECT: CONTINUED FARC EXTORTION 
 
REF: BOGOTA 5157 
 
1. (U) THE COLOMBIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES (FARC) 
CONTINUE TO EMPLOY EXTORTION AS A SOURCE OF INCOME. 
ACCORDING TO AN APRIL 11 STORY IN BOGOTA DAILY \"EL 
SIGLO,\" GUILLERMO OCAMPO OSPINA, FORMER CONSERVATIVE 
GOVERNOR OF CALDAS DEPARTMENT, DECLARED THAT HE WAS A 
RENEWED VICTIM OF THE FARC BEFORE THE MARCH 9 
CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION.  HIS FIRST ENCOUNTER OCCURRED A 
YEAR AGO WHEN HE HAD TO RANSOM HIS KIDNAPPED BROTHER 
FROM THE FARC. 
 
2. (U) THE FARC, WHO ACCOSTED OCAMPO IN EASTERN CALDAS, 
REPORTEDLY DEMANDED FROM HIM MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF 500,000 
PESOS (2,732 DOLLARS).  OCAMPO QUESTIONED WHY THE 
GUERRILLAS WERE EMPLOYING EXTORTION WHEN THEY WERE 
PARTIES TO THE PEACE PROCESS THROUGH THE UNION 
PATRIOTICA (UP).  THE FARC MEMBERS RESPONDED THE UP WAS 
A POLITICAL FRONT THAT HAD NO INFLUENCE ON GUERRILLA 
CONDUCT.  OCAMPO SUBSEQUENTLY SPOKE WITH ALBERTO ROJAS 
PUYO, COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBER OF THE PEACE COMMISSION, 
WITH NO APPARENT RESULT, AND ATTEMPTED WITHOUT SUCCESS 
TO CONTACT BRAULIO HERRERA, THE FARC MEMBER OF THE PEACE 
COMMISSION. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT: THIS INCIDENT ILLUSTRATES THE 
AMBIGUITIES OF THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS WHICH FAVOR 
SUCH ACTIONS BY THE FARC.  THE FARC CAN EITHER ATTRIBUTE 
THE EXTORTION TO ANOTHER GUERRILLA GROUP OR ALLEGEDLY 
DISCIPLINE ITS DISOBEDIENT UNIT.  IN EITHER 
CIRCUMSTANCE, THE FARC CAN BOLSTER ITS IMAGE, AND THAT 
OF THE UP, AS FAITHFUL ADHERENTS TO THE PEACE PROCESS. 
AS IN ITS UPCOMING DEALINGS WITH THE PEACE COMMISSION 
(SEE REFTEL), THE FARC CAN CULTIVATE SUCH A POSITIVE 
IMAGE WHILE PROCEEDING WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL.

E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR 
TAGS: KPRP, PINS, MILI, PTER, CO 
SUBJECT: PROSPECTS FOR COLOMBIA\'S GUERRILLA WAR 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: THE GUERRILLA WAR IN COLOMBIA IS 
STALEMATED: THE GUERRILLAS ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL AREAS 
OF SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OR ENGAGE IN SET-PIECE 
BATTLES, BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS UNLIKELY TO DESTROY 
THEM.  FIGHTING MAY INCREASE FOLLOWING THE INAUGURATION 
OF THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION.  THE GROUPS OUTSIDE THE 
PEACE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT, BUT THE MAIN 
LONG-TERM GUERRILLA THREAT IS THE FARC: WELL-ARMED, 
WELL-FINANCED, POLITICALLY DURABLE, AND (FOR NOW) IN THE 
PEACE PROCESS.  THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES ARE HAMPERED 
BY PROBLEMS OF PERSONNEL, INTELLIGENCE AND EQUIPMENT, 
AND WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO ENGAGE ALL COLOMBIA\'S 
GUERRILLA GROUPS AT ONE TIME.  THE ARMED FORCES AND 
PRESIDENT-ELECT BARCO ARE AWARE OF THESE DEFICIENCIES 
AND WILL SEEK TO RECTIFY THEM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
A NEW BALL GAME? 
---------------- 
 
2. (C) FROM NEW PRESIDENT A NEW APPROACH: COLOMBIA IS 
ABOUT TO ENTER A NEW STAGE IN ITS THIRTY-YEAR BATTLE 
WITH GUERRILLA INSURGENCY.  VIRGILIO BARCO AS THE NEW 
PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE GUERRILLA FORCES RANGED AGAINST 
IT.  BARCO HAS TOLD US OF HIS INTENTION TO MAKE THE 
PEACE PROCESS CONFORM TO THE INTERESTS OF THE COLOMBIAN 
GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE, AND REDUCE GUERRILLA MANIPULATION 
OF THE PROCESS.  HE WILL OFFER SOME ECONOMIC AND 
POLITICAL REFORMS, CONCENTRATED IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THE 
INSURGENCIES ARE STRONG.  HE HAS ALSO SAID THAT HE WILL 
STRENGTHEN THE ARMED FORCES.  HOW THE GUERRILLA FORCES 
WILL REACT TO BARCO\'S TWO-HANDED POLICY IS THE KEY 
QUESTION. 
 
3. (C/NF) THE INSURGENT LINE-UP: THE COLOMBIAN 
INSURGENCY IS A COMPLEX AND CONTRADICTORY PHENOMENON. 
THE LARGEST OF COLOMBIA\'S GUERRILLA GROUPS, THE 
REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC), IS AT 
PRESENT THE LEAST ACTIVE MILITARILY DUE TO ITS 
PARTICIPATION IN THE PEACE PROCESS.  THE FARC MAINTAINS 
AROUND 4,000 PERSONNEL.  COLOMBIAN ARMY SOURCES INDICATE 
THAT THIS NUMBER INCLUDES ONLY HEAVILY ARMED FIGHTERS, 
WITH SOME \"FRONTS\" (LOCAL FARC UNITS, DIVIDED ON A 
GEOGRAPHIC BASIS) ABLE TO QUINTUPLE THEIR STRENGTH 
THROUGH USE OF LIGHTLY ARMED AUXILIARIES.  A SEPARATE 
AND RECENT ESTIMATE DIVIDED FARC GUERRILLAS BETWEEN FULL 
AND PART-TIMERS, AND CAME UP WITH 3,500 UNDER EACH 
HEADING.  THE FATE OF THE PEACE PROCESS WILL DETERMINE 
WHETHER THIS CONSIDERABLE FORCE IS BROUGHT INTO THE 
SCALES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  THE REMAINING INSURGENT 
GROUPS IN THE REVOLUTIONARY SPECTRUM -- THE M-19, 
NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN), POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY 
(EPL), AND THE MINOR GUERRILLA GROUPS HAVE LARGELY 
ABANDONED THE PEACE PROCESS, ALTHOUGH TWO FRONTS OF THE 
ELN REMAIN INSIDE.  OFFICIAL COLOMBIAN ESTIMATES OF THE 
STRENGTH OF THE REMAINING MAJOR INSURGENT GROUPS 
(INCLUDING BOTH FULL AND PART-TIME GUERRILLAS) ARE AS 
FOLLOWS:  AROUND 650 EPL, ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF ELN, 
AND OVER 1,400 M-19.  WE DO NOT HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN 
ANY OF THESE ESTIMATES.  WHEN COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES 
WISH TO LOOK SUCCESSFUL, THE NUMBERS GO DOWN; WHEN THEY 
TALK ABOUT NEEDING MORE RESOURCES, THE NUMBERS GO UP. 
IF FORCED TO CHOOSE, WE WOULD GUESS THAT ACTUAL STRENGTH 
IS HIGHER THAN OFFICIALLY ESTIMATED, RATHER THAN LOWER. 
 
4. (LOU) INSURGENT GAME PLANS: THE TACTICS OF THESE 
GROUPS HAVE TRADITIONALLY CONSISTED OF EXTORTION, 
KIDNAPPING, AND AMBUSHES OF COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES. 
THE AVAILABLITY OF NARCO MONEY IN RECENT YEARS MAY HAVE 
REDUCED THE PROPORTIONATE ROLE OF EXTORTION IN TOTAL 
GUERRILLA FINANCING.  URBAN TERRORISM REMAINS A PROBLEM, 
BUT POLICE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL IN 
HUNTING DOWN TERRORIST SAFE HOUSES.  POSSIBLY AS A 
RESULT, M-19 AND ITS ALLIES HAVE CONCENTRATED IN RECENT 
MONTHS MAINLY ON RURAL OPERATIONS IN THE VALLE DEL CAUCA 
(CALI) AREA.  AN IMPORTANT FACTOR SINCE LATE 1985 HAS 
BEEN THE FORMATION OF AN ALLIANCE OF ALL THE GUERRILLA 
GROUPS WHO ARE OUTSIDE THE PEACE PROCESS, INTO THE 
NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINADORA (CNG).  THIS 
ORGANIZATION, WHICH HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY M-19 TO THE 
POINT THAT SOME GUERRILLAS HAVE THEMSELVES COMPLAINED, 
HAS PROBABLY ENABLED THE GUERRILLAS TO MASS LARGER 
NUMBERS FOR PARTICULAR ATTACKS THAN WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE 
BEEN POSSIBLE.  SHOULD THE FARC ONE DAY LEAVE THE PEACE 
PROCESS AND JOIN THE CNG, POSSIBILITIES WOULD OPEN FOR 
EVEN LARGER-SCALE OPERATIONS. 
 
 
FARC: ENEMY NUMBER ONE 
---------------------- 
 
5. (C/NF) FARC -- PATIENT AND DISCIPLINED: WHETHER AS 
PART OF THE CNG OR OTHERWISE, THE FARC REPRESENT 
POTENTIALLY THE GREATEST DANGER TO THE COLOMBIAN 
GOVERNMENT.  UNLIKE THE OTHER GUERRILLA GROUPS, THE 
FARC\'S DEDICATION TO A REVOLUTIONARY TRIUMPH IS TEMPERED 
BY PATIENCE AND DISCIPLINE.  THE FARC LEADERSHIP IS TOO 
SOPHISTICATED TO EXPECT POWER BASED ON A SHORT-TERM 
MILITARY VICTORY.  THIS ATTITUDE CONTRASTS WITH THAT OF 
THE M-19, WHICH CONCENTRATES ON SPECTACULAR, BUT 
ULTIMATELY COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE, ACTIONS SUCH AS THE 
PALACE OF JUSTICE SEIZURE, THE ATTACK AGAINST THE CIUDAD 
JARDIN SUBURB OF CALI, OR THE ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE THE 
MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT.  THE KEY TO THE FARC\'S STRATEGY 
APPEARS TO BE ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE PEACE PROCESS. 
THE FARC HAS USED THE AMBIGUITIES OF THE PEACE TREATY TO 
GAIN MORE RECRUITS, AS WELL AS INCREASED NUMBERS AND 
TYPES OF WEAPONS, WHILE ALSO ACQUIRING SOME POLITICAL 
RESPECTABILITY.  FARC LEADERS HAVE DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE 
EFFORT TO CONSOLIDATING THEIR CONTROL IN AREAS UNDER 
THEIR INFLUENCE.  THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF FARC 
ATTEMPTS TO REACH AGREEMENTS WITH THE ELN AND THE EPL IN 
AREAS WHERE THEY COMPETE TO ENABLE JOINT OPERATIONS SUCH 
THAT THE FARC\'S PARTICIPATION WOULD BE COVERT.  SUCH AN 
ARRANGEMENT WOULD GIVE FARC LEADERS PLAUSIBLE DENIAL FOR 
TERRORIST ACTS WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO MAINTAIN CONTROL 
OF THEIR AREAS OF INFLUENCE.  MEANWHILE, COLOMBIAN 
MILITARY SOURCES CLAIM THAT, OUT OF ANXIETY TO AVOID 
BREAKING THE TRUCE, PRESIDENT BETANCUR ORDERED THE ARMED 
FORCES NOT TO ENTER AREAS OF FARC ENCAMPMENTS.  THE FARC 
HAS BEEN THE LEADER AMONG THE GUERRILLAS IN FORGING 
HIGHLY PROFITABLE LINKS WITH THE NARCO-TRAFFICKERS, 
WHOSE AREAS OF ACTIVITY ARE FREQUENTLY IN TRADITIONAL 
FARC OPERATING AREAS.  IN VIEW OF THESE TANGIBLE 
BENEFITS, THE FARC PROBABLY DESIRES TO MAINTAIN THE 
PEACE PROCESS IN ITS PRESENT FORM. 
 
6. (C/NF) FARC-UP IN CONGRESS: PERHAPS THE GREATEST 
BENEFIT ACHIEVED BY THE FARC IS THE MODICUM OF 
RESPECTABILITY DERIVING FROM ITS ENTRY INTO COLOMBIAN 
ELECTORAL POLITICS VIA ITS FRONT PARTY, THE PATRIOTIC 
UNION (UP).  THOUGH THE UP\'S VOTE TOTAL WAS NOT 
SPECTACULAR, THE PARTY HAS INJECTED THE FARC INTO 
MAINSTREAM POLITICS.  REPORTING INDICATES THAT THE FARC 
INTENDS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS SEVERAL SEATS IN 
CONGRESS TO PRESS FOR A UNITED OPPOSITION FRONT TO THE 
NEW BARCO GOVERNMENT.  SUCH A FRONT WOULD FEATURE 
ALLIANCES WITH CONGRESSMEN FROM ANY PARTY OR BACKGROUND 
DISAFFECTED WITH THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT.  THE UNITED 
FRONT IDEA IS OVER-AMBITIOUS BUT NOT TOO FAR-FETCHED. 
ASSORTED LIBERALS AND NEW LIBERALS ALLIED READILY WITH 
THE UP IN THE MARCH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS.  A \"NEW 
LIBERAL\" LEADER SAID BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
THAT HIS PARTY WOULD SEEK TO RECOUP ITS STANDING BY 
ALIGNING ITSELF WITH ANY PARTY IN THE CONGRESS, 
INCLUDING THE UP.  THE UP/FARC LEADERS HOPE THIS 
STRATEGY WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE THEIR GROUP THE LEADING 
OPPOSITION FORCE IN COLOMBIA.  THEY WILL PUSH THE PUBLIC 
ARGUMENT THAT THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES ARE MUTUALLY 
COMPROMISED LOOK-ALIKES. 
 
7. (C/NF) FARC FALLBACK TO ARMS: EVEN WHILE IT PLAYS ITS 
LEGAL POLITICAL \"CARD,\" THE FARC HAS NOT LOST SIGHT OF 
ITS AMBITION TO ACHIEVE PRIMACY AMONG COLOMBIA\'S 
GUERRILLA FACTIONS.  THE FARC LEADERSHIP MAY BE 
CONSIDERING JOINING THE CNG.  THE GOAL OF SUCH A MOVE 
WOULD MOST LIKELY BE TO DOMINATE ALL COLOMBIA\'S 
GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS, SUBJECT THEM TO FARC/COMMUNIST 
PARTY DISCIPLINE, AND LEAD THEM BACK INTO THE PEACE 
PROCESS.  FARC LEADERS PRIVATELY ARGUE THAT ALL GROUPS 
COULD CONTINUE MILITARY OPERATIONS WHILE INSIDE THE 
PEACE PROCESS, DENY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM, AND THEREBY 
ATTAIN A MEASURE OF PROTECTION AGAINST COLOMBIAN 
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS -- AS THE FARC HAS DONE. 
 
 
M-19: VIOLENCE IN A VACUUM 
-------------------------- 
 
8. (C/NF) SEEKING ATTENTION, FACING ATTRITION: WHILE THE 
FARC POSES THE GREATEST LONG-TERM THREAT TO COLOMBIA, 
THE 19TH OF APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19) CONTINUES TO DOMINATE 
THE HEADLINES BOTH IN COLOMBIA AND ELSEWHERE.  THE 
M-19\'S RECENT HISTORY IS REPLETE WITH GROSS 
MISCALCULATIONS.  THE CONTINUING ATTRITION OF THE M-19\'S 
LEADERSHIP, REPRESENTED BY THE DEATHS OF MEN SUCH AS 
JAIME BATEMAN THREE YEARS AGO, IVAN MARINO OSPINA IN 
CALI IN AUGUST 1985, ANDRES ALMARALES IN THE PALACE OF 
JUSTICE SIEGE LAST NOVEMBER, AND ALVARO FAYAD IN A MARCH 
1986 BOGOTA FIGHT, HAS LEFT THE MOVEMENT WITH MANY 
PISTOLEROS BUT FEW POLITICALLY ASTUTE CHIEFS.  M-19\'S 
CONTINUED ATTEMPTS TO GO FOR THE ELUSIVE KNOCKOUT, WITH 
ACTIONS LIKE THE SEIZURE OF THE PALACE OF JUSTICE AND 
THE CIUDAD JARDIN ATTACK, SHOW THE UNREALITY OF ITS 
POLITICAL CALCULATIONS.  AS A RESULT, ITS POPULAR 
SUPPORT -- WHICH WAS ONCE QUITE LARGE (IN A 1981 OPINION 
POLL, 40 PERCENT NATIONALLY EXPRESSED \"SOME SYMPATHY\" 
FOR M-19) -- IS DECLINING. 
 
9. (C/NF) LEADING FROM WEAKNESS?: SEVERAL ACTIONS ATTEST 
TO THE M-19\'S INFLATED SENSE OF ITS CAPABILITIES.  THE 
FORMATION OF THE INTERNATIONALIST \"AMERICAS BATTALION\" 
IN DECEMBER 1985 WAS AN OSTENSIBLE ATTEMPT TO FORM A NEW 
\"BOLIVARIAN ARMY\" TO LIBERATE ANEW THE ANDEAN 
COUNTRIES.  BUT THE AMERICAS BATTALION HAS NOT ENJOYED 
MUCH SUCCESS IN ITS CHOSEN THEATER, THE CAUCA VALLEY. 
DESPITE THEIR WEAKNESS IN NUMBERS, THE M-19 LEADERSHIP 
CONTINUES TO PLAN TO ESTABLISH AN ALTERNATE GOVERNMENT 
IN VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT AND CONVENE A NATIONAL 
\"CONGRESS\" THERE IN AUGUST 1986.  THE M-19 HAS SAID IT 
WILL NOT RPT NOT SEEK AN ACCOMMODATION WITH THE BARCO 
REGIME, BUT WILL CONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS AS USUAL. 
(ATTEMPTS TO SEEK PAPAL MEDIATION, IN THE NEWS LATELY, 
WERE ALMOST CERTAINLY MADE WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT 
THEY WOULD FAIL IMMEDIATELY.  THEY WERE PUBLICITY 
GESTURES ONLY.) 
 
 
PROBLEMS OF THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C/NF) RESOURCES THINLY STRETCHED: AS IT PREPARES 
FOR A SITUATION WHICH MAY CHANGE CONSIDERABLY OVER THE 
NEXT YEAR, THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES CONFRONT SEVERAL 
MAJOR PROBLEMS.  ONE IS A SHORTAGE OF PERSONNEL: THE 
COLOMBIAN ARMY TOTALS ABOUT 70,000 MEN.  GIVEN THE 
GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD OF THE GUERRILLA FORCES, THE 
INHOSPITABLE TERRAIN, THE NEED TO DEFEND MANY FIXED 
HIGH-VALUE TARGETS, AND THE SHORTAGE OF DEPLOYABLE 
FORCES, THE ARMY IS ALREADY STRETCHED THIN.  SHOULD THE 
PEACE PROCESS UNRAVEL AND THE FARC RESUME THE ATTACK, 
THE ARMY WOULD BE HARD PRESSED.  ONE GENERAL OFFICER 
SPECULATED THAT 15,000 ADDITIONAL TROOPS WOULD BE 
REQUIRED, SHOULD THE FARC SHIFT TO A WAR FOOTING. 
 
11. (C/NF) SEEING THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY: LACK OF 
INTELLIGENCE IS ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIAN 
MILITARY PERFORMANCE.  ALTHOUGH THE ARMY HAS CONDUCTED 
OPERATIONS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AGAINST THE AMERICAS 
BATTALION IN VALLE DEL CAUCA AND CAUCA DEPARTMENTS, THE 
LACK OF GOOD AND READILY AVAILABLE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 
PREVENTS A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE SITUATION.  AT LEAST IN 
THIS THEATER, THE ARMY APPEARS BOGGED DOWN AND UNABLE TO 
BRING ITS CONCENTRATED STRENGTH TO BEAR.  THE POLICE 
(MORE THAN 60,000 STRONG, AND PARA-MILITARY) ALSO PLAY A 
LARGE ROLE IN COUNTER-INSURGENCY IN ALL AREAS, BUT 
PARTICULARLY IN THE CITIES.  INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION 
APPEARS MORE AVAILABLE IN THE CITIES, AND GUERRILLA 
OPERATIONS THERE HAVE BEEN HURT RECENTLY. 
 
12. (C/NF) ARMS SHORTFALLS:  QUALITY OF EQUIPMENT IS YET 
ANOTHER ISSUE.  GOC OFFICERS ARE CONVINCED THAT THE 
QUALITY OF ARMS IN THE HANDS OF THE GUERRILLAS, 
PARTICULARLY THE FARC, ACTUALLY EXCEEDS THAT OF THE 
ARMY\'S WEAPONS.  GIVEN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE 
TO THE GUERRILLAS THROUGH EXTORTION AND NARCOTICS, THEIR 
ABILITY TO PURCHASE SUCH ARMS IS UNQUESTIONED.  SOME 
COLOMBIAN OFFICERS FEEL THAT THE GAP CAN BE BEST 
ADDRESSED THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY, 
STRESSING IN PARTICULAR THE USE OF MORE HELICOPTERS TO 
PROVIDE LIFT AND MOBILITY. 
 
 
THE YEAR AHEAD: DRAWING THE BATTLE LINES 
---------------------------------------- 
 
13. (C) SLIPPING STALEMATE?: THE PRESENT MILITARY 
SITUATION IS IN MANY RESPECTS A STALEMATE.  THE 
COLOMBIAN ARMY IS UNABLE TO DEFEAT THE GUERRILLAS 
CURRENTLY RANGED AGAINST IT.  FOR THEIR PART, THE 
GUERRILLAS ARE UNABLE TO MAKE INROADS AGAINST THE 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN AREAS OF DENSE SETTLEMENT, BUT ARE 
EXPANDING IN SOME ISOLATED RURAL REGIONS -- PARTICULARLY 
WHERE THEY ALREADY HAVE TRADITIONAL SUPPORT.  THE 
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT A GOVERNMENT IS LOSING 
WHEN MERELY KEEPING AN INSURGENCY AT BAY.  THE SHIFT IN 
STRENGTH MAY BE GLACIAL, BUT OVER TIME THE DECAY OF THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION IS REAL.  THERE ARE MORE 
GUERRILLAS ACTIVE NOW IN COLOMBIA, AND THE LEVEL OF 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE IS HIGHER, THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE 
CIVIL WAR OF THE 1950\'S -- BUT DURING THAT WAR, MOST 
GUERRILLAS WERE LIBERALS, NOT COMMUNISTS.  THE SITUATION 
IS NO CAUSE FOR PANIC.  THE NUMBER OF GUERRILLAS IS 
SMALL IN PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF THE COUNTRY, AND 
COLOMBIANS CAN TOLERATE A LOT OF VIOLENCE.  BUT IT CAN 
SCARCELY PROMOTE EASY SLUMBER FOR COLOMBIAN LEADERS. 
 
14. (C/NF) THE COMING YEAR:  AS THE PRESIDENTIAL 
INAUGURATION APPROACHES, ALL PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT 
ANTICIPATE CHANGES IN THE PRESENT REALITY.  IN PRIVATE 
TALKS AND IN HIS SIX-POINT PEACE PROGRAM, 
PRESIDENT-ELECT BARCO HAS SERVED NOTICE THAT THE PEACE 
PROCESS MUST AND WILL CHANGE.  THE ARMED FORCES CHIEF OF 
STAFF EXPECTS AN INEVITABLE (BUT PROBABLY GRADUAL) 
INCREASE IN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY AFTER THE INAUGURATION, 
AS THE GUERRILLAS REACT TO BARCO\'S HARDER LINE.  THE 
PAYOFF WOULD, HOPEFULLY, COME IN A YEAR OR TWO WHEN THE 
GUERRILLAS HAVE EITHER LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS OR BEEN 
DEALT WITH FORCEFULLY.  BOTH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN 
LEADERS HAVE EXPRESSED TO US THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL 
RESOURCES TO MEET THIS EXPECTED UPTURN IN GUERRILLA 
ATTACKS.  WHILE CONTINUED AND EVEN EXPANDED ACTIVITIES 
BY GROUPS SUCH AS THE M-19, ELN, AND EPL, SEEM 
INEVITABLE, THE WILD CARD REMAINS THE FARC.  MANUEL 
MARULANDA VELEZ (AKA TIROFIJO), TOP LEADER OF THE FARC, 
HAS HINTED THAT THE GROUP WILL NOT ACCEPT AN ATTEMPT BY 
BARCO TO CHANGE THE RULES OF THE GAME.  IN AN INTERVIEW 
PUBLISHED IN THE COLOMBIAN WEEKLY \"SEMANA,\" TIROFIJO 
DECLARED THAT THE FARC WILL NOT ACCEPT ULTIMATUMS FROM 
THE BARCO GOVERNMENT, VIEWING SUCH DEMANDS AS AN ATTEMPT 
TO RUPTURE THE PEACE PROCESS.  HE ALSO DECLARED THAT HIS 
GUERRILLAS WOULD NOT DEMOBILIZE UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT 
IMPLEMENTED THE FULL RANGE OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL 
REFORMS DEMANDED BY THE FARC.  HIS STATEMENT AGREES WITH 
REALITY, AS WE SEE IT FOR THE FARC: WITHOUT GUNS, THE 
FARC WOULD BE A NEGLIGIBLE MINI-PARTY.  WITHOUT GUNS, 
THEY WOULD HAVE NO ATTRACTION FOR NARCO MONEY.  WITHOUT 
GUNS, THEY WOULD SWIFTLY FADE FROM PUBLIC ATTENTION.  WE 
CONCLUDE THAT, THEREFORE, THEY WILL FIND A PRETEXT TO 
KEEP THE GUNS.  THE SPARRING HAS BEGUN.  OVER THE COURSE 
OF THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE AUGUST 7 INAUGURATION, WE 
THINK THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE GOC AND ITS GUERRILLA 
ENEMIES WILL GET HOTTER BEFORE IT GETS COLDER.

SUBJECT: THE GUERRILLA SITUATION: PREPARING FOR WAR? 
 
REF: BOGOTA 3997 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  COLOMBIA\'S GUERRILLA WAR HAS BEEN 
QUIESCENT THE LAST FEW WEEKS.  THOUGH ARMED CONTACTS 
BETWEEN THE VARIOUS GUERRILLA GROUPS AND THE MILITARY 
CONTINUE, THE PACE OF MAJOR CONFRONTATIONS HAS 
SLACKENED.  THE MAIN ARENA OF CONFRONTATION HAS BEEN THE 
MEDIA, WHERE THE UNION PATRIOTICA (UP), POLITICAL FRONT 
OF THE COLOMBIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES (FARC), 
LEVELED CHARGES OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AGAINST THE 
MILITARY.  COLOMBIA\'S GUERRILLA GROUPS ARE IN A 
RETRENCHMENT PHASE: REGROUPING, FORGING ALLIANCES, AND 
RETHINKING STRATEGIES.  THE GOC CONTINUES TO 
RESTRUCTURE ITS SECURITY APPARATUS AND TO AUGMENT THE 
ARMY\'S STRENGTH THROUGH RECRUITMENT OF VOLUNTEER UNITS. 
THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT BOTH SIDES ARE PREPARING FOR 
AN EVENTUAL BREAKDOWN OF THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE 
RESUMPTION OF FULL-SCALE CONFLICT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
GUERRILLAS - THE PUBLIC PROFILE 
------------------------------- 
2. (S/NF) WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS BANNER:  THE FARC AND 
THE UNION PATRIOTICA ARE THE ONE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA 
GROUPING POSSESSED OF A MEDIA SENSE.  IN RECENT WEEKS, 
THEY HAVE USED THE MEDIA TO MAKE THEIR CASE TO THE 
COLOMBIAN AND FOREIGN PUBLIC.  THE MAJOR THRUST BY THE 
UP WAS A MAY 8 PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH EX-PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE JAIME PARDO LEAL CHARGED OVER 100 MILITARY 
OFFICERS WITH HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AGAINST UP MEMBERS AND 
ACTIVISTS (SEE BOGOTA 6456).  THE UP\'S CHARGES RESULTED 
IN A SWIFT DENIAL AND A NAME-BY-NAME REBUTTAL BY DEFENSE 
MINISTER SAMUDIO.  PARDO\'S THRUST WAS COMPLEMENTED BY 
REPORTS OF A PARIS PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH UP 
CONGRESSMAN AND EX-FARC COMANDANTE BRAULIO HERRERA 
DECLARED THE UP AND THE PEACE PROCESS TO BE IN DANGER OF 
EXTINCTION FROM ASSAULTS BY THE MILITARY AND 
MILITARY-SUPPORTED PARA-MILITARY GROUPS (SEE BOGOTA 
7001).  HERRERA\'S PARIS SOJOURN IS PROBABLY THE OPENING 
PHASE OF A LARGE SCALE PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE 
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND SECURITY FORCES.  SPECIAL 
REPORTING INDICATES THAT THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY 
(PCC) IS COORDINATING SUCH A CAMPAIGN WITH LEFTIST 
GROUPS IN LATIN AMERICA AND EUROPE.  THE CAMPAIGN IS TO 
BE MODELED ON THOSE CONDUCTED AGAINST THE GOVERNMENTS OF 
EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, AND ARGENTINA.  ANALOGY BETWEEN 
ARGENTINA\'S \"DIRTY WAR\" AND CONTEMPORARY COLOMBIA WILL 
BE THE KEY THEME.  THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE IS TO 
CONSTRAIN GOC ACTIONS AGAINST ANY GUERRILLA GROUP AND TO 
FRUSTRATE ATTEMPTS TO SECURE COUNTER-INSURGENCY SUPPORT 
FROM ABROAD. 
 
3. (U) PARDO ON THE PEACE PROCESS: FOLLOWING ON THE 
CHARGES OF MILITARY HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, THE 
CONSERVATIVE WEEKLY \"GUION\" PUBLISHED AN INTERVIEW WITH 
PARDO IN ITS MAY 27 EDITION.  AFTER THE NOW-RITUAL 
DECLARATION OF THE UP\'S INDEPENDENCE FROM THE FARC, 
PARDO WENT ON TO DENOUNCE THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION\'S 
CONDUCT OF THE PEACE PROCESS.  HE DECLARED THE PROCESS 
TO BE IN CRISIS BECAUSE THE GOC LACKS THE WILL TO BUILD 
ON THE BASE CREATED BY THE BETANCUR ADMINISTRATION.  IN 
PARTICULAR, HE CITED THE GOC\'S REFUSAL TO NAME AN 
INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION COMMISSION AS PROOF OF A LACK 
OF INTEREST IN PEACE.  \"THE GOVERNMENT,\" PARDO 
CONTINUED, \"HAS NOT MOVED A SINGLE FINGER TO PUT AN END 
TO...ARMED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE 
GUERRILLA MOVEMENT OBSERVING THE TRUCE.\"  HE ALSO 
CRITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT CONTENTION THAT THE ARMED 
FORCES MUST HAVE FREE ACCESS TO ANY PART OF THE 
COUNTRY.  CHALLENGED THAT THE TREATY DID NOT CONCEDE 
\"INDEPENDENT REPUBLICS\" TO THE FARC, PARDO COUNTERED 
THAT \"THE FARC NEEDS A GEOGRAPHICAL SITE, A PIECE OF 
EARTH.\" 
 
4. (U)  A LETTER TO BARCO:  THE UP\'S EFFORTS WERE 
COMPLEMENTED BY DESPATCH MAY 10 OF A LETTER FROM THE 
FARC COMANDANTES TO PRESIDENT BARCO.  REVEALING A NEW 
AGGRESSIVENESS TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT, THE FARC WARNED 
THAT THE FATE OF THE PEACE PROCESS IS IN BARCO\'S HANDS. 
SIGNIFICANTLY, THE FARC DECLARED THAT THEY DID NOT SIGN 
A TRUCE WITH \"MILITARISM\" AND ARE READY TO JOIN \"OUR 
PEOPLE WHEN IT DECIDES TO RISE UP AGAINST MILITARISM.\" 
THE FARC\'S LETTER CONTAINS AN IMPLICIT THREAT: SHOULD 
BARCO BECOME \"MILITARISTIC\" IN THE FARC\'S EYES, THE 
GUERRILLAS WILL HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO ABANDON THE 
PEACE PROCESS AND RESUME OPERATIONS. 
 
 
GUERRILLAS - BEHIND THE SCENES MANEUVERING 
------------------------------------------ 
5. (C/NF) FARC - STIRRING FROM THE NEST:  WHILE THE 
FARC\'S PUBLIC ORGANS ARE ENGAGED IN TARRING THEIR 
GOC/MILITARY OPPONENTS, THE FARC AND COLOMBIA\'S OTHER 
GUERRILLA ARMIES, SINGLY OR IN CONCERT, HAVE BUSIED 
THEMSELVES WITH REORGANIZATION, ALLIANCES, AND STRATEGIC 
RETHINKING.  AS THE LARGEST GUERRILLA ARMY, AND THE SOLE 
GROUP REMAINING WITHIN THE PEACE PROCESS, THE FARC\'S 
ACTIVITIES COMMAND THE LION\'S SHARE OF INTEREST.  RECENT 
REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT THE FARC IS REDISTRIBUTING 
FORCES, POSSIBLY WITH AN EYE TO READINESS IN EVENT OF AN 
OPEN BREAK WITH THE GOC.  ONE MILITARY SOURCE REPORTS 
THAT FIVE ADDITIONAL FARC FRONTS ARE BEING FORMED.  IT 
IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS PROJECTED EXPANSION REFLECTS 
ADDITIONAL ARMED STRENGTH, A REDISTRIBUTION OF AVAILABLE 
STRENGTH TO COUNTER GOC INITIATIVES, OR A RESPONSE TO 
RIVAL GUERRILLA GROUPS.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE GROWTH IN 
FARC STRENGTH SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PEACE PROCESS, 
IT FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THE NEW FRONTS REFLECT 
AUGMENTATION OF THE FARC\'S ARMED STRENGTH.  BY CONTRAST, 
OTHER SPECIAL REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT THE FARC IS 
CONSOLIDATING FRONTS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE MARCH 1988 
ELECTIONS.  ANOTHER FACET OF THE SITUATION IS A JUNE 2 
REPORT IN \"EL ESPECTADOR\", BOGOTA\'S LEADING DAILY, THAT 
THE FARC IS ABANDONING ITS MOUNTAIN HEADQUARTERS AT LA 
URIBE AND SHIFTING FORCES TO META AND GUAVIARE 
DEPARTMENTS.  THIS REPORT REMAINS UNCONFIRMED; GOC 
OFFICIALS PLED IGNORANCE WHEN PRESSED BY THE MEDIA FOR 
CONFIRMATION.  IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THE FARC WOULD 
LEAVE INACCESSIBLE LA URIBE FOR NEW AND UNHARDENED 
QUARTERS.  ANY SHIFT OF PERSONNEL FROM LA URIBE MAY IN 
FACT BE TIED TO THE ACTIVATION OF NEW FRONTS. 
 
6. (S/NF) EXTENDING A HAND TO THE EPL: WHILE CONTINUING 
TO SPAR WITH THE GOC ON THE PEACE PROCESS, THE FARC HAS 
NOT ABANDONED ITS HOPES OF DOMINATING COLOMBIA\'S 
GUERRILLA MOVEMENT.  A MAJOR STEP IN THIS DIRECTION WAS 
THE APRIL 4 AGREEMENT WITH THE PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY 
(EPL) WHICH CALLED FOR GUERRILLA UNITY, \"DEMOCRATIC 
CONVERGENCE\" AND POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TO COLOMBIA\'S 
PROBLEMS.  CONFIDENTIAL REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT EACH 
SIDE SEES ADVANTAGES FLOWING FROM THE PACT.  THE FARC 
FORESEES A NOMINAL TRUCE BETWEEN THE GOC AND THE EPL 
WHICH WOULD ALLOW INCREASED EPL TO INCREASE POLITICAL 
ACTIVITY IN ITS CORDOBA DEPARTMENT STRONGHOLD -- AN 
ADVANTAGE FOR THE RADICAL LEFT.  THEY ALSO VIEW THE PACT 
AS AN INCENTIVE FOR OTHER GUERRILLA GROUPS TO NEGOTIATE 
WITH THE FARC.  FOR ITS PART, THE EPL SEES THE AGREEMENT 
AS A MEANS OF LURING THE FARC OUT OF THE PEACE PROCESS. 
THUS, THE AGREEMENT COULD SUCCUMB TO THE DISTRUST AND 
IDEOLOGICAL SQUABBLING THAT HAVE KEPT COLOMBIA\'S 
GUERRILLAS DIVIDED. 
 
7. (S/NF) EXTENDING A FIST TO THE ELN: DESPITE SUCCESS 
IN FORGING LINKS TO THE EPL, TENSIONS BETWEEN THE FARC 
AND THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN) HAVE ESCALATED. 
IN PARTICULAR, THE FARC HAS ACCUSED THE ELN OF MURDERING 
MEMBERS OF THE FARC\'S UNION PATRIOTICA (UP) POLITICAL 
FRONT IN ARAUCA INTENDENCY.  THE SITUATION MIRRORS THE 
CONFLICTING AMBITIONS OF THE TWO GROUPS IN THAT AREA. 
WHILE THE FARC REMAINS INTENT ON MONOPOLIZING POLITICAL 
POWER IN ARAUCA, AND USING THE AREA AS A RECRUITING 
POOL, THE ELN SEEKS TO DOMINATE THE AREA THROUGH ATTACKS 
ON THE OIL PIPELINE.  CONFIDENTIAL REPORTING INDICATES 
THAT THE ELN DESIRES A MEETING TO RESOLVE THESE 
PROBLEMS.  IT IS UNKNOWN IF SUCH A MEETING OCCURRED, BUT 
NEW DEVELOPMENTS SUGGEST THAT THE FARC AND THE ELN HAVE 
TEMPORARILY SHELVED THEIR DIFFERENCES. 
 
8. (C) ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE:  THE NEW DEVELOPMENT 
SUGGESTING A SUBSUMPTION OF FARC-ELN DIFFERENCES IS THE 
GENERAL STRIKE CALLED FOR JUNE 7-9.  THIS STRIKE, 
DESIGNED TO PARALYZE SEVEN DEPARTMENTS OF NORTHEASTERN 
COLOMBIA, WAS JOINTLY SPONSORED BY THE FARC, THE 
PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY (EPL), THE M-19, THE NATIONAL 
LIBERATION ARMY (ELN), AND THE NEWLY-REACTIVATED RICARDO 
FRANCO FRONT (A DISSIDENT WING OF THE FARC). 
VICE-MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT FERNANDO BOTERO TOLD MISSION 
JUNE 9 THAT THE STRIKE HAS NOT ASSUMED THE DIMENSIONS 
ORIGINALLY FEARED.  URBAN WORKERS HAVE LARGELY IGNORED 
CALLS TO TAKE TO THE STREETS.  BOTERO ADDED THAT ABOUT 
18,000 CAMPESINOS HAVE BEEN MOBILIZED UNDER DURESS BY 
THE GUERRILLAS, THREATENED WITH A 20,000 PESO FINE OR 
DEATH FOR NON-COMPLIANCE.  WHILE SATISFIED THAT THE 
STRIKE\'S IMMEDIATE IMPACT IS MINIMAL, BOTERO COMMENTED 
THAT THE EVIDENT GUERRILLA COOPERATION IN FOMENTING THE 
CAMPESINO MARCHES IS DISTURBING (COMMENT: WE SHARE 
BOTERO\'S CONCERN; WHATEVER THE SUCCESS OF THE CIVIC 
STRIKE, ITS PLANNING POINTS TOWARD POSSIBLE GREATER 
COOPERATION AMONG THE GUERRILLAS.) 
 
9. (S/NF) M-19 -- THROWING THEIR HAT IN THE RING: THE 
FARC IS NOT ALONE IN RETHINKING ITS POSITION AND IN 
RESTRUCTURING ITS FORCES.  CONFIDENTIAL REPORTING 
INDICATES THAT THE LONG-UNHEARD-FROM M-19 HAS DECIDED TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE 1988 MAYORAL ELECTIONS.  THE GROUP 
INTENDS TO ACT THROUGH FRONT GROUPS AND TO SEEK 
ALLIANCES WITH MAINSTREAM POLITICIANS AND GROUPS SUCH AS 
THE FARC\'S UNION PATRIOTICA.  THE FARC/EPL AGREEMENT 
CITED IN PARAGRAPH (6) IS A PRIME MOTIVATION FOR THE 
M-19\'S ACTION.  IN ADDITION, THE M-19 INTENDS TO FORGE 
CLOSER LINKS WITH THE FARC.  AS WITH OTHER 
INTER-GUERRILLA AGREEMEMTS, SELF-INTEREST ASSUMES A 
COMMANDING POSITION; THE M-19 HOPES THAT CLOSER 
RELATIONS WITH THE FARC WILL FOSTER JOINT OPERATIONS 
SHOULD THE FARC-GOC TRUCE COLLAPSE.  IN OTHER 
DEVELOPMENTS, THE M-19 IS CREATING NEW URBAN TERRORIST 
UNITS IN COLOMBIA\'S MAJOR CITIES, AND HAS BEGUN JOINT 
TRAINING WITH THE EPL TO REBUILD ITS DEPLETED STRENGTH 
ALONG THE CARIBBEAN COAST. 
 
10. (S/NF) ELN - PULSO FIRME Y MANO TENDIDA:  IN 
ADDITION, THE ELN IS NEARING COMPLETION OF A MAJOR 
REORGANIZATION OF ITS BOGOTA UNITS.  FORMERLY LARGELY 
AUTONOMOUS, THESE UNITS WILL NOW BE SUBJECT TO THE ELN\'S 
NATIONAL DIRECTORATE.  GIVEN THE ELN\'S REPUTATION FOR 
DISCIPLINE, FUTURE ELN ACTIONS IN BOGOTA MAY SEEK TO 
HAVE AN IMPACT SIMILAR TO THEIR PIPELINE ATTACKS IN 
ARAUCA.  REGARDING THE PIPELINE, ON JUNE 1, THE ELN 
PROPOSED TO THE GOC A CESSATION OF PIPELINE ATTACKS, 
PROVIDED THE GOC MET SEVERAL ELN DEMANDS REGARDING 
PETROLEUM EXTRACTION AND EXPORT (SEE BOGOTA 7451). 
THESE DEMANDS WERE ROUNDLY REJECTED BY RECONCILIATION 
ADVISOR CARLOS OSSA ESCOBAR, WHO DECLARED THAT THE GOC 
WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE ITS ENERGY POLICY \"WITH AN ARMED 
MINORITY INTENT ON ATTACKING THE NATIONAL PATRIMONY.\" 
 
 
THE GOVERNMENT - RESTRUCTURING FOR CONFLICT 
------------------------------------------- 
11. (C/NF) MILITARY GROWTH:  GUERRILLA EFFORTS AT 
RESTRUCTURING HAVE THEIR PARALLEL ON THE GOVERNMENT 
SIDE.  THOUGH PRESIDENT BARCO REITERATED TO VISITING 
GENERAL GALVIN (SEE BOGOTA 7463) HIS BELIEF THAT HIS 
REHABILITATION PLAN WILL SAP MUCH OF THE FARC\'S 
STRENGTH, HE REMAINS INTENT ON EXPANDING THE SIZE, 
MOBILITY, AND PROFESSIONALISM OF THE ARMED FORCES. 
BARCO BELIEVES (COMMENT: WE AGREE) THAT THE ARMED FORCES 
ARE NOT NOW IN A POSITION TO TAKE ON A FULLY-ACTIVE 
FARC.  HOWEVER, HIS RECENT COMMENTS SUGGEST THAT 
ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS ARE BRAKING THE PACE OF ARMY 
EXPANSION.  IN A JUNE 2 SPEECH AT THE MILITARY ACADEMY, 
BARCO STATED THAT HIS GOVERMMENT WOULD PROVIDE THE 
\"BASIC ELEMENTS\" NEEDED BY THE ARMY, BUT ONLY \"TO THE 
MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE.\"  WHATEVER THE REALITY OF 
BUDGET LIMITATIONS, THE COLOMBIANS HAVE DECIDED TO 
PURCHASE U.S.-MADE TRANSPORT HELICOPTERS AT A COST OF 
$36 MILLION, THOUGH DELIVERY OF THE FIRST UNIT WILL NOT 
TAKE PLACE UNTIL LATE 1987.  IN ADDITION, THE ARMY HAS 
BEEN RECRUITING SOME 2,000 DISCHARGED SOLDIERS FOR 
SERVICE IN SPECIAL VOLUNTEER COMPANIES.  THESE UNITS ARE 
HIGHLY RATED DUE TO THE MEN\'S PRIOR EXPERIENCE, AND HAVE 
BEEN DEPLOYED IN CONTESTED AREAS SUCH AS CAQUETA 
DEPARTMENT.  RECRUITMENT OF ADDITIONAL VOLUNTEER UNITS 
IS EXPECTED. 
 
12. (U) SECURITY RESTRUCTURING:  AS A FURTHER STEP IN 
COMBATTING THE THREAT POSED BY THE GUERRILLAS AND THE 
EROSION OF PUBLIC ORDER, THE COUNTRY\'S PRINCIPAL 
INTERNAL SECURITY ORGANS HAVE BEGUN MAJOR 
REORGANIZATIONS.  THE NATIONAL POLICE ANNOUNCED JUNE 2 
THE ACTIVATION OF 30 INTELLIGENCE \"BRIGADES\" DESIGNED TO 
DETECT URBAN ACTIVITIES BY GUERRILLA GROUPS, BE THEY 
MILITARY OR POLITICAL IN NATURE.  FOR ITS PART, THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS - COLOMBIAN 
FBI) HAS CREATED THREE NEW COMMANDS DEDICATED TO 
SECURITY, EXPLOSIVES AND COUNTER-TERRORISM, AS WELL AS 
INTELLIGENCE CENTERS IN BOGOTA, CALI, MEDELLIN, AND 
CUCUTA.  ACCORDING TO DAS COMMANDER GENERAL MAZA, ALL 
UNITS ARE DESIGNED TO COUNTER THE WAVE OF CRIMINALITY, 
TERRORISM, AND ARMED SUBVERSION CONFRONTING COLOMBIA. 
 
 
PROGNOSIS 
--------- 
13. (C) AS INDICATED IN MISSION\'S LAST ASSESSMENT OF 
COLOMBIA\'S GUERRILLA SITUATION (REFTEL), THE LEVEL OF 
CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA IS EXPECTED TO GROW DURING 1987. 
THE STEPS BEING TAKEN BY BOTH THE GOC AND THE VARIOUS 
GUERRILLA GROUPS REFLECT THAT EXPECTATION.  THE ACTIVE 
GUERRILLA GROUPS APPEAR INTENT ON STRIKING THE GOC ANEW 
ONCE REDEPLOYMENT AND RETRAINING ARE ACCOMPLISHED. 
HOWEVER, THE MAJOR DANGER TO COLOMBIAN INSTITUTIONS AND 
U.S. INTERESTS HERE LIES IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE FARC. 
EVOLUTION OF EVENTS, OF COURSE, WILL DEPEND ON HOW THE 
FARC FORESEES PROSPECTS OF ITS UNION PATRIOTICA 
POLITICAL FRONT IN THE MARCH 1988 POPULAR ELECTIONS FOR 
MAYORS.  CURRENT PROJECTIONS SUGGEST THE UP WILL DO 
FAIRLY WELL IN SOME ISOLATED RURAL AREAS, AND MAY ELECT 
UP TO EIGHTY MAYORS (OUT OF OVER 1,000), ALL IN 
RELATIVELY SMALL TOWNS.  BASED ON THIS EXPECTATION, MOST 
OBSERVERS HERE THINK THE FARC WILL BE VERY RELUCTANT TO 
FORMALLY BREAK THE TRUCE BEFORE NEXT MARCH -- ALTHOUGH 
THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE MAY RISE WITHOUT ANY DECLARATION. 
BEFORE OR AFTER MARCH, THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE EVENTS IS 
WIDE: THE FARC IN OPEN WARFARE, OR STILL-NOMINAL 
ADHERENCE TO THE PEACE ACCORDS;  THE UP LEAVING THE 
CONGRESS, OR STAYING TO USE IT AS A PLATFORM TO DENOUNCE 
THE GOVERNMENT.  BUT IN OUR JUDGEMENT ALL THESE 
SCENARIOS WILL HAVE ONE COMMON FACTOR:  HEIGHTENED 
VIOLENCE AND INCREASED THREAT TO COLOMBIA\'S INSTITUTIONS 
AND U.S. INTERESTS.

E.O. 12356: N/A 
TAGS: PINS, CO 
SUBJECT: FARC PUBLICLY REJECTS DISARMAMENT 
 
1. U) SUMMARY:  THE FARC GUERRILLA HIGH COMMAND ON JULY 
7 PUBLICLY REJECTED \"DEMOBILIZATION OR DISARMAMENT\" FOR 
ITS FORCES, CLAIMING FURTHER THAT IT HAD NEVER PROMISED 
SUCH ACTION.  END SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) FARC-UP IN ARMS:  IN A RADIO PRESS CONFERENCE 
JULY 7, TOP LEADERS OF THE COLOMBIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMED 
FORCES (FARC), COLOMBIA\'S LARGEST GUERRILLA GROUP, 
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NOT DEMOBILIZE OR DISARM THEIR 
FORCES.  FOLLOWING THE JUNE 16 CAQUETA AMBUSH, THE GOC 
STATED THAT ANY FURTHER SESSIONS OF THE PEACE PROCESS 
WOULD BE LIMITED TO DISCUSSIONS OF THESE TOPICS.  FARC 
COMMANDERS ADDED THAT THEY HAD NEVER PROMISED 
DISARMAMENT: \"NEITHER AS A POLICY NOR IN RESPONSE TO THE 
AGREEMENTS OF LA URIBE, WAS THAT SPOKEN OF.\"  FARC 
COMMANDER MANUEL MARULANDA, \"TIROFIJO\" (SURE-SHOT), 
SPOKE, AS DID HIS DEPUTY AND CHIEF IDEOLOGUE JACOBO 
ARENAS, AND ALFONSO CANO.  THE BROADCAST REPORTEDLY 
ORIGINATED FROM A SOUTH BOGOTA SITE AND WAS TRANSMITTED 
ON VARYING FREQUENCIES. 
 
3. (U) UNREPENTANT:  THE FARC LEADERS INSISTED THEY 
WOULD REMAIN INSIDE THE TRUCE WITH THE GOC, BUT ADDED 
THAT MORE INCIDENTS LIKE THE RECENT CAQUETA AMBUSH COULD 
WELL OCCUR, BECAUSE OF \"MILITARY PERSECUTION.\"  THEY 
REVEALED THAT THEY HAD SPOKEN THE SAME DAY TO THE GOC 
USING THE \"HOT LINE\" TELEPHONE FROM THEIR HEADQUARTERS 
AT LA URIBE AND HAD MADE 19 COMPLAINTS, MAINLY RELATED 
TO ALLEGED GOC MILITARY OPERATIONS NOW UNDERWAY AGAINST 
\"VARIOUS FRONTS\" OF THE FARC.  THEY CLAIMED THAT THE 
CAQUETA INCIDENT WAS THE RESULT OF MILITARY OPERATIONS, 
EVEN THOUGH \"FOR THE SAKE OF DISCUSSION\" THEY WERE 
WILLING TO USE THE WORD AMBUSH.  THEY POINTED OUT THAT 
SIMILAR GOC-GUERRILLA INCIDENTS HAD OCCURRED UNDER THE 
PREVIOUS (BETANCUR) GOVERNMENT, BUT HAD BEEN OVERCOME 
BECAUSE THE DESIRE TO DO SO EXISTED -- INSTANCING THE 
AMBUSH AND DEATH OF 22 FARC GUERRILLAS IN ANTIOQUIA AT 
THE HANDS OF GOC MILITARY. 
 
4. (U) STRIKE NOW; TALK LATER:  FARC LEADERS ANNOUNCED 
THAT THEY WOULD ATTEMPT TO ORGANIZE (PRESUMABLY USING 
THE PATRIOTIC UNION, THE COMMUNIST-FRONT POLITICAL 
PARTY) A NATIONAL PROTEST STRIKE TO \"REESTABLISH THE LA 
URIBE ACCORDS.\"  THEY COMPLAINED THAT THOSE ACCORDS HAD 
NEVER BEEN PROPERLY CARRIED OUT, SINCE THE \"POLITICAL, 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS CONTEMPLATED THEREIN\" HAD 
NEVER BEEN CARRIED OUT.  THEY INDICATED CONTINUED 
INTEREST IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOC, BUT SAID THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEND A HIGH-LEVEL COMMISSION TO THEIR 
HEADQUARTERS; THAT THE (BETANCUR-ERA) COMMISSIONS OF 
DIALOGUE AND VERIFICATION SHOULD BE REESTABLISHED; THAT 
DIALOGUE SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON PRIOR CONDITIONS 
(LIKE THE GOC\'S INSISTENCE ON TALKING ABOUT 
DISARMAMENT); AND THAT THE \"ATMOSPHERE\" DID NOT 
CURRENTLY EXIST FOR TALKING ABOUT DISARMAMENT AND 
DEMOBILIZATION. 
 
5. (LOU)  WHAT DID THE FARC PROMISE?  RAFAEL PARDO, 
SECRETARY OF POPULAR INTEGRATION AND ASSISTANT TO 
PRESIDENTIAL PEACE ADVISOR CARLOS OSSA ESCOBAR, TOLD US 
THAT THE 1984 LA URIBE ACCORDS, AND THE 1986 RENEWAL, 
IMPLY DISARMAMENT, AND DIRECTED US TO THE RELEVANT 
ARTICLES.  IN FACT, THE LANGUAGE OF THE SECTIONS HE 
SUGGESTED IS VAGUE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT VARIOUS 
INTERPRETATIONS.  ARTICLE 6 OF THE 1984 ACCORD SPEAKS OF 
A ONE-YEAR PERIOD FOR THE FARC TO \"ORGANIZE ITSELF 
POLITICALLY, ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY.\"  \"DURING THIS 
PERIOD THE GOVERNMENT WILL UNDERTAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS 
TO REESTABLISH CIVIC ORDER IN THE ZONES OF VIOLENCE.\" 
ARTICLE 3 OF THE 1986 RENEWAL SAYS THAT THE FARC WILL 
PARTICIPATE IN PEACEFUL ELECTIONS \"WITHOUT PHYSICAL, 
MORAL OR ECONOMIC COERCION.\"  ARTICLE 6 OF THE SAME TEXT 
CALLS ON THE FARC TO INTENSIFY ITS INCORPORATION INTO 
\"POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE AND PRODUCTIVE CIVIC ACTION, 
SO THAT WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME ITS ADHERENTS WILL 
PARTICIPATE IN FULL INSTITUTIONAL NORMALITY.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6.  (LOU) THE GOC FEELS THAT PARTICIPATION IN PEACEFUL 
ELECTIONS WITHOUT RESORTING TO ARMED INTIMIDATION -- AND 
\"INCORPORATION INTO FULL INSTITUTIONAL NORMALITY\" -- ARE 
MEANINGLESS WITHOUT DISARMAMENT AND DEMOBILIZATION.  THE 
FARC CLAIMS TO SEE NO CONTRADICTION, AND IS LIKELY TO 
INSIST ON A LITERAL READING OF THE ACCORDS, WHICH DO NOT 
USE THE WORDS DISARMAMENT OR DEMOBILIZATION. 
 
7.  (LOU)  ANOTHER STEP IN THE DECLINE OF THE TRUCE AND 
PEACE PROCESS.  THE FARC\'S MAIN CONCERN, AS WE SEE IT, 
WAS PROBABLY TO SCORE POINTS IN THE ON-GOING BATTLE TO 
FIX BLAME FOR THAT DECLINE.

STATE FOR S/CT WHARTON 
 
E.O. 12356: N/A 
TAGS: KPRP, PTER, CO 
SUBJECT: COLOMBIA: 1988 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  A) STATE 357278,  B) BOGOTA 5976 
 
1.  COLOMBIA HAS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT WHOSE 
INSTITUTIONS ARE UNDER ATTACK BY FOUR MAJOR SUBNATIONAL 
GUERRILLA GROUPS AND BY NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  FAR FROM 
BEING A SUPPORTER OF TERRORISM, COLOMBIA IS THE VICTIM 
OF SUSTAINED TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE COUNTRY\'S 
INSTITUTIONS ARE THREATENED THROUGH FREQUENT ATTACKS BY 
INSURGENTS ON RELATIVELY SMALL RURAL TOWNS AND POLICE 
STATIONS.  IN 1988 THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED TREND TOWARDS 
LARGER-SCALE ATTACKS BY COMBINED GUERRILLA GROUPS 
AGAINST HARDER MILITARY TARGETS.  ATTACKS AGAINST 
ECONOMIC TARGETS, PARTICULARLY THE COUNTRY\'S NATIONAL 
OIL PIPELINE, HAVE INCREASED OVER THE LAST YEAR. 
 
2.  INSURGENT VIOLENCE CAN BE CONSIDERED INTERNATIONAL 
ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ONE GROUP\'S ACTIVITIES HAVE AT 
TIMES CROSSED COLOMBIA\'S BORDER INTO VENEZUELA, WHERE 
KIDNAPPING AND EXTORTION SCHEMES WERE CARRIED OUT, AND 
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GROUPS\' RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL 
SUPPORT. 
 
3.  ANOTHER SOURCE OF TERRORIST VIOLENCE EMANATES FROM 
THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKER ORGANIZATIONS.  WHILE NOT 
ESSENTIALLY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, NARCOTICS TRAFFICKER 
INSTIGATED VIOLENCE HAS A POLITICAL EFFECT IN THAT MANY 
SUCH ACTIONS ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND INSTITUTIONS IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
ASSURE THEIR OWN FREEDOM TO PURSUE THE NARCOTICS TRADE 
AND ENJOY THE BENEFITS THEREOF.  NARCOTICS-RELATED 
TERRORISM DOES HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER SINCE THE 
TRAFFICKERS USE VIOLENCE TO EXTEND THEIR NARCOTICS 
NETWORKS BEYOND COLOMBIA, INCLUDING INTO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
 
4.  NARCOTICS TERRORISM DIRECTED AT THE COLOMBIAN 
JUDICIARY IN 1988 ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL OF MAKING THE 
PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF MAJOR NARCOTICS 
TRAFFICKERS TOO DANGEROUS FOR MOST OFFICIALS.  PRESIDENT 
BARCO RELEASED A STATEMENT IN SEPTEMBER STATING THAT THE 
BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY WAS A PRINCIPAL VICTIM OF 
NARCO TERRORISM DIRECTED AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT AND 
THE COUNCIL OF STATE.  A MAJOR TRAFFICKER, JORGE LUIS 
OCHOA, WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON ON THE LAST DAY OF 1987 
WHILE THE GOVERNMENT WAS ATTEMPTING TO FIND A WAY TO 
EXTRADITE HIM.  MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVE THREATS AND 
BRIBES WERE RESPONSIBLE. 
 
5.  THOSE ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE MINISTER OF 
JUSTICE IN 1984 ARE CONNECTED TO MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEF 
PABLO ESCOBAR.  THEY WERE TRIED IN 1988 AND A JURY FOUND 
THEM INNOCENT.  THE JUDGE THREW OUT THE VERDICT, 
DECLARING IT NULL AND VOID BECAUSE IT CONTRADICTED THE 
EVIDENCE.  A NEW JURY WAS SO SEVERELY THREATENED THAT 
THE JUDGE DECLARED A MISTRIAL SHORTLY BEFORE A VERDICT 
WAS TO HAVE BEEN RENDERED.  SEVERAL JUDGES AND OFFICIALS 
WHO TOOK FORCEFUL ACTIONS AGAINST THE NARCOTICS 
TRAFFICKERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. 
 
MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS 
------------------------------- 
6.  THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED STATE-OF-SIEGE DECREES AND 
ENACTED SWEEPING ANTI-TERRORIST DECREES IN JANUARY 1988 
IN RESPONSE TO THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS\' KIDNAPPING AND 
KILLING OF ATTORNEY GENERAL CARLOS MAURO HOYOS.  THE 
DECREES DID NOT ADDRESS EXTRADITION.  THEY DID, HOWEVER, 
EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF TERRORISM, ENHANCE THE POWERS 
OF THE POLICE WITH REGARD TO ARRESTS, SEARCHES AND 
CONFISCATIONS, CREATE SPECIAL JUDGES AND POLICE TO DEAL 
WITH TERRORISM, AND PROVIDE STRICT RULES FOR THE USE OF 
HABEAS CORPUS.  TWO PROVISIONS OF THE DECREES WERE 
SUBSEQUENTLY OVERTURNED BY THE SUPREME COURT, 
SPECIFICALLY THOSE ITEMS ALLOWING POLICE AND MILITARY 
FORCES TO MAKES SEARCHES AND ARRESTS ON THE BASIS OF 
SUSPICION AND WITHOUT WARRANTS, AND REQUIRING 
REGISTRATION OF PROPERTY AND INHABITANTS IN AREAS DEEMED 
TO BE USED BY TERRORISTS. 
 
7.  IN ADDITION, COLOMBIA HAS WORKED FOR ADOPTION IN THE 
UNITED NATIONS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES 
OF RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING THE ILLICIT CONVENTIONAL ARMS 
TRADE.  THESE EFFORTS ARE DESIGNED TO LIMIT THE 
AVAILABILITY OF SOPHISTICATED CONVENTIONAL ARMS TO 
WEALTHY TRAFFICKERS AND GUERRILLAS. 
 
8.  THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA HAS MADE NO PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.

SUBJECT: DESTRUCTION OF FARC\'S 45TH FRONT AND OTHER 
         RECENT FARC LOSSES 
 
REF: A. BOGOTA 18283; B. BOGOTA 17707 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  A RARE SUCCESS BY THE ARMY AGAINST 
THE FARC GUERRILLAS IN META LAST MONTH (REF B), AND 
FARC LOSSES DURING THEIR SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER 
OFFENSIVES APPEAR TO HAVE RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF 
THEIR PREVIOUS HIGH RATE OF ATTACKS.  THESE LOSSES MAY 
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR SUDDEN RENEWAL OF 
INTEREST IN POLITICAL INITIATIVES, SUCH AS THE PEACE 
PLAN PROPOSED BY CONSERVATIVE SENATOR LEYVA DURAN 
(REF A).  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  IN ITS DECEMBER 9 ISSUE, \"EL TIEMPO\" 
PUBLISHED A DETAILED REPORT THAT THE ARMY\'S VII 
BRIGADE TROOPS SUCCEEDED NOVEMBER 26 IN DISMANTLING 
AND RENDERING COMBAT INEFFECTIVE THE ENCAMPMENT OF THE 
FARC\'S 45TH FRONT IN ARIARI, META DEPARTMENT (SEE 
REFTEL).  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE, THE ATTACK WAS 
SUPPORTED BY THREE BLACK HAWK HELICOPTERS AND CAUGHT 
THE GUERRILLAS BY SURPRISE.  THE ACCOUNT SAYS THAT THE 
GUERRILLAS LOST 21 KILLED IN THAT ACTION, MOST FROM 
BLASTS BY RIFLE-LAUNCHED GRENADES AS THE GUERRILLAS 
TRIED TO FLEE.  GUERRILLA CASUALTIES INCLUDED THE 
LEADER OF THE FARC\'S 45TH FRONT, BUT SOME 30 SURVIVING 
GUERRILLAS MANAGED TO FLEE THE AREA IN A ROUT. 
 
3.  (U)  BRIGADIER GENERAL HAROLD BEDOYA PIZARRO, 
COMMANDER OF THE ARMY\'S VII BRIGADE WAS QUOTED AS 
SAYING THAT THE ARMY WILL REMAIN IN THE ARARI ZONE TO 
\"CONTINUE HELPING ITS INHABITANTS FIGHT OFF THE FARC 
CRIMINALS, WHO FOR YEARS HAVE WROUGHT ONLY POVERTY, 
DESOLATION AND VIOLENCE TO PEACEFUL SETTLERS IN THAT 
REGION.\" 
 
4.  (U)  WEEKLY \"SEMANA\" NEWS MAGAZINE PUBLISHED A 
BLURB ON THE WEEK OF DECEMBER 9 REPORTING FARC LOSSES 
INCURRED IN THE SERIES OF OFFENSIVES LAUNCHED BY THAT 
GROUP AFTER SEPTEMBER 1.  QUOTING \"NATIONAL AND 
REGIONAL AUTHORITIES,\" SEMANA REPORTED THAT DURING 
THIS THREE MONTH PERIOD THE FARC LOST 42 MEN KILLED, 
87 WOUNDED, AND 242 WEAPONS OF DIFFERENT TYPES 
CAPTURED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  THE ARTICLE ALSO 
REPORTED THAT FARC COLUMNS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ABANDON 
15 ENCAMPMENTS AND HAVE REVEALED THE LOCATION OF 12 OF 
THEIR 45 FRONTS. 
 
5.  (C)  COMMENT:  EVEN MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR POSSIBLY 
EXAGGERATED MILITARY REPORTING THAT LED TO THE 
NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS, IT APPEARS THAT THE MILITARY HAS 
CHALKED UP A RARE SUCCESS BASED ON A WELL EXECUTED 
OPERATION IN META.  FARC LOSSES DURING THEIR SEPTEMBER 
AND OCTOBER OFFENSIVES MAY EXPLAIN GOC THINKING, AS 
REVEALED RECENTLY BY PRESIDENTIAL COUNSELORS RAFAEL 
AND RODRIGO PARDO ON SEPARATE OCCASIONS TO EMBOFFS, 
THAT THE GUERRILLAS COULD NOT KEEP UP THEIR HIGH RATE 
OF ACTIONS, AND WOULD LIKELY TURN TO POLITICAL 
INITIATIVES.  WE CAN SEE THE LATTER ALREADY UNDERWAY 
WITH THE FARC/M-19 TRYING TO USE THE LEYVA DURAN PEACE 
PLAN TO PRESSURE THE GOC INTO A CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT 
(SEE BOGOTA 18283).

IDENTIFYING HIMSELF.  HE DOES NOT ENJOY ANY DIPLOMATIC 
OR QUASI OFFICIAL STATUS, HOWEVER. 
 
2.  IN ADDITION, SUBSEQUENT TO THE EMBASSY\'S ORIGINAL 
SUBMISSION, THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA DECREED 
ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY MEASURES IN LATE NOVEMBER TO DEAL 
WITH MOUNTING TERRORIST VIOLENCE.  THE MEASURES INCLUDE 
THE IMPOSITION OF MANDATORY LIFE SENTENCES ON 
PERPETRATORS OF MASSACRES OR HOMICIDES COMMITTED IN THE 
COURSE OF TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS; IMMEDIATE DETENTION OF PERSONS SUSPECTED OF 
CONSPIRING AGAINST PUBLIC ORDER; AN INCREASE IN MILITARY 
AND POLICE RECRUITMENT AND THE CREATION OF SPECIAL 
GROUPS TO COMBAT TERRORISM; ADDITIONAL MATERIALS 
RESOURCES FOR THE ARMED FORCES TO IMPROVE MOBILITY; THE 
SPECIAL PROTECTION OF JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES 
INVESTIGATING MASSACRES OR ATTACKS AND THE ELIMINATION 
OF TRIAL BY JURY IN CASES OF \"MONSTROUS CRIMES\".  THESE 
DECREES ARE, HOWEVER, SUBJECT TO AUTOMATIC SUPREME COURT 
REVIEW, AND SEVERAL, PARTICULARLY THE MANDATORY LIFE 
SENTENCE, ARREST ON SUSPICION OF CONSPIRACY AND THE 
ELIMINATION OF JURY TRIAL FOR SOME MURDER TRIALS, ARE 
APT TO BE OVERTURNED.

         COMMISSION IS FORMED 
 
REF: BOGOTA 3017 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE FARC LEADERSHIP ON FEBRUARY 28 
ORDERED A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE AMONG ALL ITS FRONTS IN 
RESPONSE TO THE FORMATION OF A PEACE COMMISSION IT HAD 
RECOMMENDED.  THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY, THE FARC 
EXPRESSED HOPES THAT COMMISSION MEMBERS WOULD NOW 
MEDIATE WITH THE GOC TO HALT THE GOC\'S MILITARY ACTIONS 
AGAINST THE FARC.  PRESIDENT BARCO RESPONDED BY SAYING 
THAT HE HOPES THE CEASEFIRE ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT SIMPLY A 
PLOY BY THE FARC TO GET THE ARMED FORCES OFF ITS BACK. 
A WELL-CONNECTED ARMY OFFICER TOLD US THAT HE DOES 
NOT/NOT BELIEVE THE GOC WILL NOW IMPOSE A CEASEFIRE ON 
THE ARMED FORCES.  WE ARE INCLINED TO AGREE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
FARC ANNOUNCES CEASEFIRE; PEACE COMMISSION FORMED 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
2.  (U)  FARC SECOND IN COMMAND JACOBO ARENAS ANNOUNCED 
TO THE PRESS ON FEBRUARY 28 THAT THE TOP LEADERSHIP OF 
THE FARC HAS ORDERED A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE AMONG ALL 
ITS FRONTS.  THE CEASEFIRE ORDER HAS ONLY ONE CAVEAT -- 
THAT FARC GROUPS WILL ACT IN \"SELF DEFENSE\" IF 
THREATENED BY ARMY OPERATIONS IN THEIR AREA.  THE FARC\'S 
CEASEFIRE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THROUGH SOCIAL 
CONSERVATIVE SENATOR ALVARO LEYVA DURAN, ITS FAVORITE 
POLITICAL INTERLOCUTOR.  LEYVA CONVEYED TO THE PRESS THE 
CONTENTS OF HIS TAPED TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH JACOBO 
ARENAS. 
 
3.  (U)  IN A FEBRUARY 23 COMMUNIQUE (SEE REFTEL), THE 
FARC HAD PROPOSED THE NAMES OF FIVE PROMINENT COLOMBIANS 
FOR THE CREATION OF A NON-GOC PEACE COMMISSION TO 
INITIATE PEACE TALKS WITH THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA 
COORDINATOR (SBGC).  THE FARC PROMISED THAT IT WOULD 
ORDER A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE TO \"HELP PREPARE A 
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR NEGOTIATIONS\" IF THE 
COMMISSION WAS FORMED,  THE FIVE NOTABLES, LED BY FORMER 
PRESIDENTS MISAEL PASTRANA AND ALFONSO LOPEZ MICHELSEN, 
STUDIED THE FARC OFFER ON FEBRUARY 27.  FOUR OF THE FARC 
NOMINEES AGREED TO PARTICIPATE (\"EL TIEMPO\" DIRECTOR 
HERNANDO SANTOS BOWED OUT CLAIMING CONFLICT OF 
INTEREST).  IN HIS TELEPHONE MESSAGE TO LEYVA DURAN ON 
THE 28TH, ARENAS CONFIRMED THAT THE FARC\'S CEASEFIRE 
ORDER WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE FORMATION OF THE PEACE 
COMMISSION (REFTEL). 
 
FARC: COMMISSION SHOULD GET GOC TO HALT MILITARY ACTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
4.  (U) LEYVA TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE FARC HAS CHOSEN TO 
\"RISK THE IMPLICATIONS OF A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE\" EVEN 
THOUGH THE GOC COULD REFUSE TO RECIPROCATE BY ORDERING A 
CEASEFIRE OF ITS OWN.  LEYVA SAID THAT THE FARC 
THEREFORE HOPES THAT COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL \"INTERPOSE 
THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE GOC,\" AND MEDIATE A HALT TO 
THE GOC\'S MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST THE FARC.  PRESIDENT 
BARCO TOLD THE PRESS ON FEBRUARY 28 THAT HE HOPES THE 
FARC\'S CEASEFIRE ANNOUNCEMENT IS SINCERE, AND NOT SIMPLY 
A PLOY TO ESCAPE THE MOUNTING PRESSURE BEING EXERTED BY 
THE ARMED FORCES IN THE FIELD.  BARCO REMINDED THE PRESS 
THAT THE FARC MADE A PREVIOUS UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE 
ANNOUNCEMENT LAST DECEMBER BUT NEVER OBSERVED IT. 
 
ARMY SOURCES BELIEVE BARCO WON\'T ORDER CEASEFIRE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
5.  (C)  A WELL-CONNECTED, HIGH-RANKING SOURCE IN THE 
ARMY TOLD DAO OFFICER THAT HE DOES NOT/NOT BELIEVE 
PRESIDENT BARCO WILL RESPOND TO THE FARC\'S CEASEFIRE BY 
IMPOSING A SIMILAR TRUCE ON THE ARMED FORCES.  \"THANK 
GOD,\" THE SOURCE EXCLAIMED, \"THAT AT LEAST THIS TIME, 
UNLIKE THE BETANCUR ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL NOT BE 
FORCED INTO A UNILATERAL TRUCE BY THE PRESIDENT.\"  THE 
SOURCE EXPECTS THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL CONTINUE 
CONDUCTING COUNTER INSURGENCY OPERATIONS AGAINST ALL 
GUERRILLA GROUPS, WHEREVER THEY ARE FOUND. 
 
------- 
6.  (C)  BASED ON PREVIOUS PRIVATE STATEMENTS TO US FROM 
PEACE COUNSELOR RAFAEL PARDO AND OTHERS WE AGREE THAT 
THE GOC IS UNLIKELY TO CALL OFF THE RECENTLY MORE 
AGGRESSIVE MILITARY.  IN ADDITION, BARCO HAS MADE IT 
CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR HIS PEACE 
PLAN.  THE GOC HAS PROMISED NOTHING TO THE GUERRILLAS 
AND IS NOW IN A POSITION TO SIT BACK AND SEE IF THE FARC 
IS AS GOOD AS ITS WORD.  NEVERTHELESS, SHOULD THE FARC 
REALLY ABIDE BY ITS TRUCE, POLITICAL PRESSURE COULD 
MOUNT FOR A GOVERNMENT RESPONSE IN KIND.  IN ADDITION, 
THE GOC WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT IF ANY CHANGES IN 
MILITARY FIELD TACTICS MIGHT BE REQUIRED BY THE FARC\'S 
UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE.

SUBJECT: WHY HAS THE FARC DECLARED A UNILATERAL TRUCE? 
 
REF: BOGOTA 3191 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: THE FARC\'S CEASEFIRE ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
FEBRUARY 28 (REFTEL) HIGHLIGHTED THAT GROUP\'S ONGOING 
ATTEMPTS TO PRESSURE THE GOC INTO DECLARING ITS OWN 
CEASEFIRE AND FORCE IT INTO ENGAGING IN PEACE TALKS WITH 
ALL FOUR GUERRILLA GROUPS IN THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA 
COORDINATOR (SBGC).  THE FARC STRATEGY STEMS FROM 
POLITICAL AS WELL AS MILITARY IMPERATIVES.  THE GOC IS 
NOT BUYING IT.  END SUMMARY 
 
THE FARC PLOY; THE GOC RESPONSE 
------------------------------- 
2.  THE FARC WANTS THE GOC TO CALL OFF THE TROOPS AND 
ENGAGE IN PEACE TALKS WITH THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA 
COORDINATOR (SBGC).  ITS DECISION TO DECLARE A 
UNILATERAL TRUCE FOLLOWING THE APPOINTMENT OF THE 
COMMISSION OF NOTABLES IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE 
THAT GOAL, AS IS ITS LATEST TACTIC OF SENDING A LETTER 
TO THE PRESIDENTS OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT IN HOPES OF 
ENLISTING THEIR SUPPORT TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON BARCO TO 
OPEN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SBGC.  THE GOC HAS REFUSED TO 
BE PRESSURED. 
 
3.  THE GUERRILLA STRATEGY TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT INTO 
DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS HAS BEEN EVIDENT SINCE AT LEAST MID 
1988, WHEN THE M-19 FORCED THE CREATION OF THE COMMITTEE 
FOR DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE AS THE PRICE FOR THE RELEASE 
OF ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO.  THE GOC SUCCESSFULLY WITHSTOOD 
THE M-19 PLOY AND THEN BEGAN A MORE PLANNED APPROACH OF 
ITS OWN TO REGAIN POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE PEACE ISSUE. 
ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1988, THE GOC CODIFIED AND PUBLICLY 
ANNOUNCED THE POLICY IT HAD IN ESSENCE BEEN FOLLOWING 
SINCE BARCO CAME INTO OFFICE IN AUGUST 1986; TO WIT: WE 
WILL NOT TALK FOR THE SAKE OF TALK (IMPLICATION -- AS 
BETANCUR DID), BUT MUST DEMAND PROOF BY WORD AND DEED 
THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING PEACE. 
ONCE THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WE WILL TALK. 
 
4.  THE GOC IS TALKING WITH THE M-19 BECAUSE THAT GROUP 
DECLARED ITS TRUCE OVER SIX MONTHS AGO.  THIS, COMBINED 
WITH THE GOC\'S DESIRE TO SHOW THAT ITS PEACE PLAN WILL 
WORK, MOTIVATED THE GOVERNMENT TO UNDERTAKE NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH THE M-19.  THE GOC FEELS UNDER NO PRESSURE TO RUSH 
INTO TALKS WITH THE FARC AND CAN POINT TO ITS TRACK 
RECORD VIS A VIS THE M19 TO DEFEND ITS POSITION. 
RAFAEL PARDO TOLD THE PRESS IN MEXICO MARCH 4 THAT \"THE 
GOVERNMENT AGREES WITH DIRECT PEACE TALKS WITH THE 
GUERRILLA.  IT INITIATED THEM IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR 
WITH THE M-19 BECAUSE THAT GROUP HAD DEMONSTRATED OVER 
THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS A SINCERE DESIRE FOR PEACE.  THE 
FARC DECLARED ITS TRUCE ONE WEEK AGO.  WE HAVE NOTHING 
AGAINST SUCH A DECLARATION, BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT 
GOING TO INITIATE ANY DIALOGUE WITH ANY GUERRILLA 
ORGANIZATION IF IT CONTINUES ITS TERRORISM, KIDNAPPINGS, 
AMBUSHES AND EXTORTION.\"  IN ESSENCE, THE GOVERNMENT CAN 
SIT BACK AND WAIT TO SEE IF THE FARC COMPLIES WITH ITS 
PROMISE TO END HOSTILITIES, INCLUDING EXTORTION. 
 
THE MILITARY MOTIVATION 
----------------------- 
5.  IT APPEARS THAT THE FARC DECLARATION OF A UNILATERAL 
CEASEFIRE HAD ROOTS IN MILITARY EVENTS AS WELL. 
MILITARY SOURCES SPECULATE THAT THE FARC WAS HURT WHEN 
IT LOST AN IMPORTANT ARMS SHIPMENT IN JANUARY (SEE 
BOGOTA 315) AND, IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS, HAS INCURRED 
MORE CASUALTIES THAN EXPECTED.  IN ADDITION, CAMPESINOS 
IN KEY AREAS HAVE BEGUN SUPPORTING THE ARMY AND ITS 
ANTI-SUBVERSIVE OPERATIONS MORE THAN IN THE PAST -- AN 
ADDITIONAL SETBACK TO THE FARC. 
 
6.  DEFENSE ATTACHE CONTACTS IN THE ARMED FORCES BELIEVE 
THAT THE FARC\'S CEASEFIRE AND ITS INSISTENCE ON DIALOGUE 
WITHOUT DISARMAMENT IS A POLITICAL PLOY TO GAIN \"TIME 
AND SPACE\" TO BUILD UP THEIR FORCES.  ACCORDING TO THEM, 
1989 IS A CRITICAL YEAR FOR THE FARC, ONE IN WHICH IT 
HOPES TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS THAT WOULD LEAD TO 
\"GENERAL INSURRECTION\" IN 1990.  THESE SOURCES SHARE 
PRESIDENT BARCO\'S SUSPICIONS (REFTEL, PARA. 4) THAT THE 
FARC IS USING THE TRUCE AND PEACE DIALOGUE AS PRETEXTS 
TO GAIN A BREATHING SPELL AND COME BACK STRONGER IN LATE 
1989. 
 
7.  IN CONCLUSION, THE ONUS IS ON THE FARC TO PROVE IT 
IS SERIOUS ABOUT PEACE.  FARC LEADERS WILL LIKELY FIND 
IT DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THEIR SPREAD OUT AND 
DECENTRALIZED FRONTS, ESPECIALLY PREVENTING THEM FROM 
CARRYING OUT THEIR NORMAL \"TAX\" COLLECTIONS.  IF THE 
FARC CAN MAINTAIN THE CEASEFIRE, PRESSURE WILL MOUNT ON 
THE GOVERNMENT TO OPEN TALKS.  IF IT CANNOT, THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL BE FREE TO PURSUE ITS CURRENT PEACE PLAN 
WHILE KEEPING THE MILITARY PRESSURE ON THE FARC.

SUBJECT: DESERTERS REVEAL DETAILS OF THE FARC\'S BLOOD 
         PURGE OF SUSPECTED INFILTRATORS 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  SIX GUERRILLA DESERTERS UNFOLDED TO 
JOURNALISTS AN EYE-OPENING ACCOUNT OF ATROCITIES 
COMMITTED BY THE FARC LEADERSHIP AGAINST ITS TROOPS IN 
THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA RIVER VALLEY.  CARLOS ENRIQUE 
CARDONA (AKA BRAULIO HERRERA), A FARC LEADER IN THE 
MAGDALENA, STAGED A SERIES OF MASSACRES OF MANY OF HIS 
OWN MEN WHOM HE SUSPECTED OF BEING GOVERNMENT 
INFILTRATORS.  THE REAL MOTIVATION, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO 
HAVE BEEN THE CHAGRIN EXPERIENCED BY CARDONA AND OTHER 
REGIONAL FARC LEADERS AT INCREASING DISAFFECTION AND 
DESERTION WITHIN GUERRILLA RANKS.  THE INCIDENT 
UNDERSCORES THE FARC\'S READINESS TO COMMIT ATROCITIES. 
IT ALSO SHOWS UP AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL AS ONE-SIDEDLY 
EMPHASIZING THE GOC\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD, WHILE 
DOWNPLAYING GUERRILLA ATROCITIES.  END SUMMARY 
 
UP FOUNDER ORDERS PUNITIVE KILLINGS OF FARC TROOPS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
2.  (U)  THE SIX DESERTERS SPOKE TO JOURNALISTS FROM 
THEIR RURAL HIDING PLACE IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA IN EARLY 
NOVEMBER.  THE BLOOD PURGE REPORTEDLY DECIMATED SEVERAL 
FARC FRONTS IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA RIVER VALLEY REGION: 
AT LEAST 200 AND AS MANY AS 500 FARC GUERRILLAS MAY HAVE 
BEEN EXECUTED IN LATE 1988 AND EARLY 1989, ACCORDING TO 
THE SIX DESERTERS.  CARLOS ENRIQUE CARDONA (AKA BRAULIO 
HERRERA), THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE KILLINGS, 
IS A PROMINENT FARC LEADER AND A FOUNDER OF THE 
PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) PARTY (IN 1985).  HE ORDERED THE 
PUNITIVE KILLINGS AFTER HE FAILED IN LATE 1988 TO 
RECOVER THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA RIVER VALLEY, A FARC 
STRONGHOLD UNTIL THE LOCAL \"SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS\" DROVE 
THE GUERRILLAS OUT IN 1981-82.  THE EXECUTIONS WERE 
PRECEDED BY MOCK COURT MARTIALS TO GIVE A FORMAL 
APPEARANCE THAT JUSTICE HAD BEEN SERVED. 
 
FARC SENTENCES PURGER TO DEATH, BUT THE PC SAVES HIM 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
3.  (U)  THE DESERTERS SAID THAT IN MARCH 1989 THE FARC 
HIGH COMMAND SENT AN INVESTIGATOR (\"AYUDANTIA\") TO THE 
CARDONA\'S ELEVENTH FRONT IN THE MAGDALENA.  THE ENVOY 
FROM THE HIGH COMMAND ENDED THE INDISCRIMINATE 
EXECUTIONS.  HE THEN ORDERED CARDONA TO RELINQUISH HIS 
COMMAND AND APPEAR BEFORE THE FARC\'S TOP LEADERSHIP IN 
THE HILLS OF META DEPARTMENT.  IN APRIL, THE FARC\'S 
SECRETARIAT TRIED AND SENTENCED CARDONA/HERRERA TO DEATH 
(IN ABSENTIA) FOR HAVING FAILED TO RETAKE THE MAGDALENA 
REGION.  ONE OF THE SIX DESERTERS, A FORMER ASSISTANT TO 
FARC LEADERS MANUEL MARULANDA AND JACOBO ARENAS, ACCUSED 
THE FARC\'S LEADERSHIP OF TRYING TO HUSH UP CARDONA\'S 
ATROCITIES TO PREVENT FURTHER DEMORALIZATION AMONG FARC 
TROOPS.  THE DESERTERS RELATED THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF 
THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCC) WAS ABLE TO 
INTERCEDE IN CARDONA\'S BEHALF AND MITIGATE HIS SENTENCE 
TO ONE OF EXPULSION FROM THE FARC.  LATER THIS YEAR, THE 
PCC SENT CARDONA TO MOSCOW, WHERE HE NOW RESIDES ON A 
\"STUDENT SCHOLARSHIP.\" 
 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
4.  (C)  THE REVELATIONS BY THE FARC DESERTERS ARE YET 
ANOTHER INDICATION OF THE READINESS OF THE GUERRILLAS TO 
COMMIT ATROCITIES.  THEY ALSO SUGGEST THAT SOME FARC 
LEADERS ARE INSECURE AND WILLING TO RESORT TO DESPERATE 
MEASURES TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THEIR TROOPS. 
IRONICALLY, THE INDIVIDUAL ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THIS 
ATROCITY WAS A LEADING FOUNDER OF THE UP, ONE OF THE 
MORE VOCAL CRITICS OF THE GOC HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.  EVEN 
MORE IRONICALLY IT WAS THE PCC, THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF 
THE UP, WHICH INTERCEDED ON CARDONA\'S BEHALF AND 
ASSISTED HIM TO OBTAIN SHELTER IN THE SOVIET UNION. 
THIS INCIDENT ALSO UNDERSCORES THE WRONGHEADEDNESS OF 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, WHOSE ONE-SIDED REPORT ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS IN COLOMBIA EMPHASIZES THE GOVERNMENT\'S RECORD 
AND DOWNPLAYS GUERRILLA ATROCITIES SUCH AS THIS ONE.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIA: 1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: A. STATE 363024; B. 88 BOGOTA 19003 
     C. BOGOTA 18301 
 
 
1.  COLOMBIA HAS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT WHICH IS UNDER 
ATTACK BY THREE SUBNATIONAL GUERRILLA GROUPS AND BY 
NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  THE COUNTRY IS THE VICTIM OF 
SUSTAINED TERRORIST ATTACKS AND THE FOE OF BOTH 
GUERRILLA AND NARCOTICS-RELATED TERRORISM.  THE 
GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO BARCO EMERGED IN 1989 AS THE 
STANDARDBEARER IN THE INTERNATIONAL FIGHT AGAINST THE 
CRIMINAL POWER OF NARCOTERRORISTS. 
 
2.  THE COUNTRY\'S INSTITUTIONS ARE THREATENED THROUGH 
FREQUENT ATTACKS BY INSURGENTS ON RELATIVELY SMALL RURAL 
TOWNS AND POLICE STATIONS.  IN 1989 THE MILITARY\'S 
INCREASED AGGRESSIVENESS SCORED MORE FREQUENT SUCCESSES 
AGAINST SUBVERSIVES.  AS A RESULT, THE RELATIVE BALANCE 
OF FORCES BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE MILITARY HAS 
MOVED IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAVOR, CULMINATING IN A 
NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE THAT RESULTED IN THE HIGHEST NUMBER 
OF GUERRILLA FATALITIES ON RECORD FOR SIMILAR ACTIONS. 
THIS IS MOSTLY DUE TO PRESIDENT BARCO, WHO HAS 
IMPLEMENTED CHANGES THAT HAVE ENHANCED SUBSTANTIALLY THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ARMED FORCES.  WE EXPECT THESE 
IMPROVEMENTS TO CONTINUE.  IN 1989, THE BARCO 
ADMINISTRATION ENGAGED A FOURTH SUBNATIONAL GUERRILLA 
GROUP IN PEACE TALKS, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PEACE 
INITIATIVE PROMULGATED BY THE GOC IN SEPTEMBER 1988. 
THESE PEACE TALKS APPEARED CLOSE TO FRUITION IN NOVEMBER 
1989, AS THIS GUERRILLA GROUP AGREED TO DEMOBILIZE, 
DISARM AND BECOME A LEGAL POLITICAL PARTY. 
 
3.  INSURGENT VIOLENCE CAN BE CONSIDERED INTERNATIONAL 
ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ONE GROUP\'S ACTIVITIES HAVE AT 
TIMES CROSSED COLOMBIA\'S BORDER INTO VENEZUELA, TO CARRY 
OUT KIDNAPPING AND EXTORTION SCHEMES, AND TO THE EXTENT 
THAT THE GROUPS RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, INCLUDING 
TRAINING.  CUBA PROVIDES TRAINING TO ALL MAJOR COLOMBIAN 
GUERRILLA GROUP AND AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF COLOMBIANS 
TRAVEL THERE EACH YEAR, WHERE THEY TRAIN WITH 
SUBVERSIVES FROM OTHER NATIONS. 
 
4.  ANOTHER SOURCE OF TERRORIST VIOLENCE EMANATES FROM 
THE NARCOTRAFFICKERS.  WHILE POLITICS IN NOT THE MAIN 
MOTIVE, VIOLENCE INSTIGATED BY NARCOS DELIVERS A 
POLITICAL IMPACT, CHARACTERIZED BY INTIMIDATION OF 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS (ESPECIALLY THE JUDICIARY), 
INSTITUTIONS AND SUCH OPINION MAKERS AS THE MEDIA. 
NARCOTERRORISM DOES HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER 
SINCE THE TRAFFICKERS USE VIOLENCE TO EXTEND THEIR 
NETWORK AND INFLUENCE BEYOND COLOMBIA, INCLUDING THE 
UNITED STATES. 
 
5.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S 1989 CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
NARCOTERRORISM CHANGED DRAMATICALLY THE SITUATION IN 
1988 WHEN THE GOC FAILED TO FIND A WAY TO REIMPOSE 
EXTRADITION.  MOST OFFICIALS CONSIDERED IT TOO DANGEROUS 
(SEE REFTEL C).  CONTINUED NARCO TERRORISM IN 1989, 
GALVANIZED GOVERNMENT RESOLVE AND PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST 
THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  AFTER INCREASED VIOLENCE 
AGAINST JUDGES AND THE KILLING OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
AND GOVERNOR OF THE REGION AROUND MEDELLIN, THE BARCO 
ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTED UNPRECEDENTED MEASURES 
AGAINST NARCOS, UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF PRESIDENTIAL 
DECREE POWERS INVOKING COLOMBIA\'S STATE OF SIEGE LAWS. 
ON AUGUST 18 JUST AS THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ADOPTING A 
NEW AND TOUGHER STANCE, THE NARCOS ESCALATED THE 
VIOLENCE FURTHER BY ASSASSINATING THE LEADING CANDIDATE 
FOR PRESIDENT.  THE PRESIDENT\'S MEASURES ENHANCED AND 
STRENGTHENED THOSE ADOPTED BY THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION 
IN NOVEMBER 1988 (REFTEL B), WHICH INCLUDED THE 
IMPOSITION OF MANDATORY LIFE SENTENCES ON THOSE GUILTY 
OF KILLINGS IN THE COURSE OF TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE 
TOUGH ANTI-NARCO DECREES PROMULGATED BY THE GOVERNMENT 
ON AUGUST 19, 1989 PROVIDED AMONG OTHER THINGS FOR 
EXTRADITION AND ASSETS FORFEITURE OF NARCOTRAFFICKERS. 
THERE FOLLOWED A SERIES OF MASSIVE RAIDS AGAINST LARGE 
NARCO PROPERTIES AND OF EXTRADITION OF A NUMBER OF 
INDIVIDUALS WANTED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 
NARCOTRAFFICKING AND/OR MONEY LAUNDERING. 
 
6.  NARCOTERRORISTS RETALIATED WITH BOMBINGS IN 
COLOMBIA\'S MAJOR CITIES AND WITH THE SELECTIVE 
ASSASSINATION OF OPINION MAKERS (A CONGRESSMAN, THREE 
MAGISTRATES AND SEVERAL JOURNALISTS) WHO WERE IN FAVOR 
OF EXTRADITION AND OPPOSED TO THE \"DIALOGUE\" PROPOSED BY 
NARCOS.  IN SEPTEMBER-NOVEMBER, THE SECURITY FORCES HAD 
INCREASING SUCCESS IN DEACTIVATING EXPLOSIVES, CAPTURING 
BOMBERS AND SEIZING A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES. 
 
7.  BUT THE TERRORIST CAMPAIGN BEGAN TO DISPLAY SIGNS 
THAT THE NARCOS WERE RECEIVING EXPLOSIVE TECHNOLOGY AND 
TRAINING EITHER FROM THE GUERRILLA GROUPS OR FOREIGN 
ADVISORS.  IN MAY, A LARGE CHARGE WAS SET ALONG THE 
ROUTE TO WORK OF THE CHIEF OF THE COUNTRY\'S 
INVESTIGATIVE POLICE (THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE 
SECURITY - DAS), GEN. MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ.  IT WAS 
COMMAND DETONATED AS HE DROVE BY BUT HE SURVIVED BECAUSE 
ANOTHER VEHICLE INTERVENED BETWEEN HIS ARMOURED CAR AND 
THE CAR BOMB.  ON DECEMBER 6, 1989, NARCOTERRORISTS 
DETONATED AN ELEVEN HUNDRED POUND EXPLOSION IN FRONT OF 
THE BOGOTA DAS HEADQUARTERS.  THE BOMB KILLED 62, 
INJURED HUNDREDS AND DEMOLISHED THE DAS HEADQUARTERS AND 
OTHER BUILDINGS.  IT WAS THE MOST DEVASTATING EXPLOSION 
IN COLOMBIA\'S HISTORY.  PRECEDING THIS INCIDENT WAS THE 
MID-AIR EXPLOSION OF AN AVIANCA AIRLINER NEAR BOGOTA, 
WHICH IS BELIEVED BY EXPERTS TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN 
ON-BOARD EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.  WHILE THE AUTHORS OF THAT 
HORRIFIC ACT HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED, MANY ASSUME 
THAT THE TRAFFICKERS WERE RESPONSIBLE. 
 
7.  COLOMBIA HAS WORKED FOR ADOPTION IN THE UN AND THE 
OAS OF RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING THE ILLICIT CONVENTIONAL 
ARMS TRADE, A PROPOSAL REVIVED BY PRESIDENT BARCO IN HIS 
1989 SPEECH BEFORE THE UN.  THESE EFFORTS ARE DESIGNED 
TO LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF SOPHISTICATED CONVENTIONAL 
ARMS TO WEALTHY TRAFFICKERS AND GUERRILLAS. 
 
8.  THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA HAS MADE NO PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
9.  THE PLO DOES NOT/NOT HAVE, NOR HAS IT HAD IN THE 
PAST, ANY OFFICIAL STATUS OR RECOGNITION IN COLOMBIA.  A 
PLO REPRESENTATIVE (MANDOUH GABER) WHO HAS REPORTEDLY 
VISITED COLOMBIA IN 1988-89, DOES NOT/NOT ENJOY ANY 
DIPLOMATIC OR QUASI OFFICIAL STATUS. 
 
10.  THERE WERE NO COURT PROSECUTIONS IN COLOMBIA IN 
1989 INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.

1.  (U)  AN AMBUSH BY A GUERRILLA COLUMN ON AN ARMY 
CONVOY KILLED TEN MILITARY IN LA PICOTA HILL, META 
DEPARTMENT IN THE EASTERN PLAINS, DECEMBER 23.  THE 
INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE A SEVENTH BRIGADE PATROL 
SEARCHED FOR THE 250-MAN GUERRILLA UNIT, BELIEVED TO 
BELONG TO THE FARC GUERRILLAS.  THE ARMY UNIT, BASED IN 
THE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITAL OF VILLAVICENCIO, HAD DETECTED 
THE PRESENCE OF THE GUERRILLA GROUP IN NORTHEASTERN 
META.  AS THE THREE VEHICLES TRANSPORTING THE MILITARY 
REACHED LA PICOTA HILL, DYNAMITE CHARGES PRE-POSITIONED 
ON THE ROUTE DETONATED UNDER THE TWO LEADING VEHICLES. 
THE GUERRILLAS CONCEALED IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE 
BOMBING SITE THEN LOOSED A FUSILLADE OF AUTOMATIC FIRE 
ON THEIR VICTIMS, SOME OF WHOM MANAGED TO FIRE BACK. 
THE NUMBER OF ARMY WOUNDED REMAINS UNDISCLOSED BUT IS

2.  (U)  THIS IS THE SIXTH (AND WORST) AMBUSH IN 1989 BY 
THE FARC ON POLICE OR MILITARY UNITS IN META DEPARTMENT, 
A REGION WITH A HEAVY FARC PRESENCE.  TOTAL DEAD ON THE 
SIDE OF THE SECURITY FORCES FROM GUERRILLA AMBUSHES IN 
META IS FIFTEEN MILITARY AND TWO POLICE.  IN THE LAST 
FIFTEEN MONTHS (SINCE OCTOBER 1988), GUERRILLA GROUPS 
HAVE KILLED A TOTAL OF FORTY NINE MILITARY AND POLICE IN 
SIMILAR AMBUSHES NATIONWIDE. 
 
3.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE CONTINUING EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE 
DYNAMITE ATTACKS POINTS UP THE ABIDING INABILITY OF THE 
ARMED FORCES TO EMPLOY BASIC TACTICS THAT WILL PROTECT 
THEM FROM AMBUSHES, ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA.

REF: (A) STATE 355397; (B) BOGOTA 5568; (C) BOGOTA 14054; 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
1.  COLOMBIA\'S DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IS CONFRONTED BY 
THREE LEFTIST GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS 
VIOLENT, WELL-FINANCED NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING 
ORGANIZATIONS.  BOTH THE INSURGENTS AND THE TRAFFICKERS 
USE TERRORISM, ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY AGAINST DOMESTIC 
TARGETS.  GUERRILLA VIOLENCE CAN ONLY BE CONSIDERED 
INTERNATIONAL TO THE EXTENT THAT ONE GROUP\'S ACTIVITIES 
HAVE AT TIMES CROSSED COLOMBIA\'S BORDER INTO VENEZUELA 
AND ECUADOR. 
 
------------ 
PROSECUTIONS 
------------ 
 
2.  THERE WERE NO PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM IN COLOMBIA IN 1990. 
 
-------------------------- 
SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST ACTS 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  NUMEROUS ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM OCCURED IN 1990, 
SOME THE RESULT OF GUERRILLA INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGNS 
AGAINST RURAL POPULATIONS.  GUERRILLAS REGULARLY TORTURE 
AND MURDER PEASANTS AND OTHERS SUSPECTED OF ASSISTING 
GOVERNMENT SECURITY FORCES.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 
TERRORIST ATTACKS, HOWEVER, WERE COMMITTED BY THE LOOSE 
CONGLOMERATE OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS KNOWN AS THE 
MEDELLIN CARTEL.  IN AUGUST 1989 THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED 
A CRACKDOWN AGAINST THE MEDELLIN CARTEL FOLLOWING A 
STRING OF POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS ATTRIBUTED TO THE 
CARTEL.  THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS RESPONDED WITH A 
VIOLENT CAMPAIGN OF BOMBINGS AND ASSASSINATIONS OF 
POLITICAL FIGURES AND POLICEMEN THAT CONTINUED INTO 
1990.  THE BOMBINGS WERE INTENDED TO INDUCE THE PUBLIC 
INTO PRESSURING THE GOVERNMENT INTO MAKING CONCESSIONS 
TO THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  THE ASSASSINATIONS WERE 
MEANT TO INTIMIDATE POLITICAL FIGURES OPPOSED TO THE 
TRAFFICKER\'S INTERESTS AND DISRUPT COLOMBIA\'S DEMOCRATIC 
ELECTIONS. 
 
4.  IN MARCH AND APRIL SUSPECTED NARCO-TERRORISTS 
ASSASSINATED THE TWO LEADING LEFTIST PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATES.  IN MAY NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS BEGAN A 
COP-KILLING CAMPAIGN IN MEDELLIN, CONTRIBUTING TO A 
RECORD HIGH 521 POLICEMEN KILLED IN ALL OF COLOMBIA AS 
OF OCTOBER 16.  RANDOM STREETCORNER MASSACRES IN 
MEDELLIN SOON FOLLOWED THE ATTACKS ON POLICEMEN, 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH-LEVEL OF TERRORISM IN 
MEDELLIN.  SPECIFIC TERRORIST ACTS MAY HAVE BEEN 
COMMITTED BY THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS IN RETALIATION 
FOR GOVERNMENT ACTIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE POLICE KILLING 
OF ONE OF ESCOBAR\'S TOP AIDES IN JUNE WAS FOLLOWED HOURS 
LATER BY THE EXPLOSION OF A CAR BOMB WHICH KILLED THREE 
PEOPLE. 
 
5.  FOLLOWING THE INAUGURATION OF THE NEW PRESIDENT 
AUGUST 7, THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS CHANGED THEIR 
TACTICS.  DURING SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, THE GROUP OF 
TRAFFICKERS KNOWN AS \"THE EXTRADITABLES\" KIDNAPPED NINE 
PROMINENT COLOMBIANS, MOSTLY JOURNALISTS.  IT IS WIDELY 
BELIEVED THAT THE KIDNAPPERS\' AIM IS TO INFLUENCE THE 
CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, SCHEDULED TO MEET IN FEBRUARY TO 
REFORM THE CONSTITUTION.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE 
TRAFFICKERS WANT THE ASSEMBLY TO PROHIBIT 
CONSTITUTIONALLY THE EXTRADITION OF COLOMBIAN CITIZENS. 
 
-------------------- 
EXTRADITION REQUESTS 
-------------------- 
 
6.  THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA MADE NO REQUESTS FOR 
EXTRADITION OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS IN 1990. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION AND EXTRADITION 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7.  REF B, PLUS PREVIOUS EMBASSY REPORTING, DESCRIBES 
THE PROFOUND PROBLEMS OF THE COLOMBIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM, 
WHICH IS OUTDATED, INEFFECTIVE, AND VULNERABLE TO 
CORRUPTION AND INTIMIDATION.  GOVERNMENT POLICY IS TO 
ARREST AND PROSECUTE THOSE WHO COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS, 
BUT IN REALITY THOSE WHO COMMIT THESE CRIMES ARE RARELY 
CAUGHT.  THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS IMPLEMENTING A 
JUDICIAL REFORM PROGRAM IT HOPES WILL STRENGTHEN THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S ABILITY TO ARREST AND PROSECUTE TERRORISTS. 
 
8.  THE GOC CURRENTLY HAS NO LEGAL MECHANISM FOR 
EXTRADITING A COLOMBIAN TO THE U.S. FOR CRIMES OTHER 
THAN NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING.  IN AUGUST 1989 COLOMBIA 
RESUMED EXTRADITIONS BY EXECUTIVE DECREE, FOLLOWING 
SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH EXTRADITIONS WERE PROHIBITED 
BY A 1987 SUPREME COURT RULING.  THE 1989 DECREE ONLY 
PROVIDES FOR THE EXTRADITION OF THOSE ACCUSED OF 
NARCOTICS-RELATED CRIMES.  INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
CRIMES ARE NOT INCLUDED.  IN SEPTEMBER THE GOVERNMENT 
PROMULGATED A DECREE (REF C) GRANTING IMMUNITY FROM 
EXTRADITION TO THOSE WHO CONFESS NARCOTICS OR 
TERRORIST-RELATED CRIMES.  ONLY ONE TRAFFICKER HAS TAKEN 
ADVANTAGE OF THIS DECREE, HOWEVER, AND COLOMBIA 
CONTINUES TO EXTRADITE DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO THE U.S. 
 
9.  IN JUNE 1990 THE GOC ISSUED ARREST WARRANTS FOR FIVE 
BRITISH MERCENARIES ACCUSED OF TRAINING PARA-MILITARY 
GROUPS FOR COLOMBIA\'S NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  COLOMBIA 
HAS A VALID EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM, 
BUT APPARENTLY HAS MADE NO REQUEST FOR THEIR EXTRADITION. 
 
-------------------------------- 
RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION 
-------------------------------- 
 
10.  COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS REGULARLY CONDEMN 
TERRORIST ACTS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL.  THE 
GOC WAS THE PRIMARY INSTIGATOR OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO 
AN ANTIGUA-BROKERED ISRAELI ARMS SALE TO COLOMBIAN 
NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  IN JULY THE JUSTICE MINISTRY 
CONDUCTED A MAJOR SHAKEUP OF COLOMBIA\'S PUBLIC ORDER 
COURTS, RESPONSIBLE FOR HANDLING TERRORISM CASES, IN AN 
EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE COURTS\' PERFORMANCE. 
 
------------------------------ 
MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS 
------------------------------ 
 
11.  IN NOVEMBER THE GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED A MAJOR ATTACK 
ON THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT BASE OF COLOMBIA\'S LARGEST 
GUERRILLA GROUP, DEALING A BLOW TO THAT GROUP\'S ABILITY 
TO CONDUCT TERRORIST ACTS.  COLOMBIA AGGRESSIVELY 
CAMPAIGNS IN THE UN AND THE OAS FOR ADOPTION OF 
RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING THE ILLICIT CONVENTIONAL ARMS 
TRADE.  COLOMBIA HAS ALSO CALLED FOR TIGHTER 
RESTRICTIONS IN LEGITIMATE ARMS TRANSFERS. 
 
----------------------------------- 
SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
----------------------------------- 
 
12.  COLOMBIA PROVIDES NO SUPPORT TO INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM OR TERRORIST GROUPS, NOR HAS THE GOVERNMENT 
MADE ANY STATEMENTS IN FAVOR OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.  IN 1980 COLOMBIA BROKE 
RELATIONS WITH CUBA BECAUSE OF THE LATTER\'S SUPPORT FOR 
COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS. 
 
------------------------------ 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1989 
------------------------------ 
 
13.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN COLOMBIA\'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS TERRORISM.  THE GOC CONTINUES TO 
CONDEMN TERRORISM AND PROSECUTE TERRORISTS TO THE BEST 
OF ITS VERY LIMITED ABILITY.

SUBJECT:  COLOMBIA\'S FARC, ELN GUERRILLAS FLEX 
-         THEIR MUSCLES TO START THE NEW YEAR 
 
REF:  A) BOGOTA 50,  B) 90 BOGOTA 20269, 
-     C) 90 BOGOTA 19695 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE NEW YEAR HAS SEEN A TREMENDOUS 
ESCALATION IN GUERRILLA VIOLENCE BY COLOMBIA\'S TWO MAIN 
FORCES, THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA 
(FARC) AND THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN). 
PREFERRED TARGETS HAVE BEEN THE SECURITY FORCES AND THE 
COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE ATTACKS HAVE 
OCCURRED IN MOST OF COLOMBIA\'S 23 ADMINISTRATIVE 
DEPARTMENTS, AS WELL AS IN THE CAPITAL.  THE OFFENSIVE 
SHOWS THAT THE MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE FARC AND ELN 
REMAINS UNCHECKED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
INSURGENTS TURN THEIR TERROR UP SEVERAL NOTCHES 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
2. (U) BEGINNING NEW YEAR\'S EVE, COLOMBIA\'S LEFTIST 
INSURGENCY GROUPS, THE FARC AND THE ELN SIGNIFICANTLY 
ESCALATED THEIR STRIKES.  THESE ACTIONS APPARENTLY ARE A 
RESPONSE TO THE MILITARY\'S DECEMBER 9 ASSAULT ON THE 
FARC\'S RURAL HEADQUARTERS, THE CASA VERDE (REFTELS). 
 
GUERRILLA FRONTS ON THE OFFENSIVE IN MOST OF COUNTRY 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
3. (U) THE VIOLENCE HAS BEEN ON A NATIONAL SCALE. 
FOLLOWING THE CASA VERDE ATTACK, THE FARC AND ELN 
ACTIVATED PRACTICALLY ALL OF THEIR FRONTS FOR 
SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS OVER A WIDE GEOGRAPHIC AREA.  THERE 
HAS BEEN NO SINGLE FOCAL POINT OR AREA FOR THE VIOLENCE; 
FEW OF THE COUNTRY\'S 23 DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN SPARED. 
 
THE CITIES AREN\'T SPARED, NOT EVEN THE CAPITAL 
--------------------------------------------- - 
4. (C) GUERRILLAS HAVE INDICATED LIMITED URBAN GUERRILLA 
CAPABILITY.  ATTACKS HAVE OCCURRED IN OR NEAR BOGOTA, 
MEDELLIN, CARTAGENA, SANTA MARTA AND OTHER CITIES. 
WITHIN A THE SPACE OF ONE-HALF HOUR LATE JANUARY 3, 
TERRORISTS STRUCK THREE NEIGHORHOOD POLICE POSTS IN THE 
SOUTHERN PART OF BOGOTA, KILLING ONE OFFICER AND 
WOUNDING ANOTHER.  POLICE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACKS TO THE 
FARC. 
 
THE NATIONAL POLICE ARE HIT HARD... 
----------------------------------- 
5. (C) A FAVORITE GUERRILLA TARGET HAS BEEN THE NATIONAL 
POLICE.  IN THE WORST SUCH ATTACK, ABOUT 50 GUERRILLAS 
AMBUSHED A POLICE TRUCK JANUARY 3 ON A HIGHWAY NEAR THE 
TOWN OF CIENAGA IN NORMALLY PEACEFUL MAGDALENA 
DEPARTMENT ON THE ATLANTIC COAST, KILLING A DOZEN POLICE 
AND WOUNDING FOUR.  THE GUERRILLAS HAVE TARGETED THE 
POLICE, ACCORDING TO MID-LEVEL ARMY OFFICIALS, BECAUSE 
THEY ARE SOFT TARGETS BECAUSE OF THEIR SMALL UNIT SIZES, 
LACK OF HEAVY ARMAMENTS, INSUFFICIENT ANTI-TERRORIST 
TRAINING, ISOLATED TOWN GARRISONS AND POOR COMMUNICATIONS. 
 
...BUT SO IS THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY 
---------------------------------- 
6. (C) THE GUERRILLAS ALSO APPEAR INTENT ON DAMAGING THE 
COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY.  GUERRILLAS HAVE DYNAMITED ROAD AND 
RAILROAD BRIDGES, BURNED TRUCKS, BUSES AND AIRPLANES, 
DESTROYED RIVER CRAFT, AND BLOWN UP ELECTRICITY, 
TELEPHONE, RADIO AND TELEVISION SUBSTATIONS, TOWERS AND 
LINES. 
 
ECOPETROL OIL PIPELINES SABOTAGED... 
------------------------------------ 
7. (U) THE PETROLEUM SECTOR, HOWEVER, HAS SUFFERED THE 
GREATEST DAMAGE.  GUERRILLAS, PRINCIPALLY THE ELN, 
SEVERAL TIMES IN JANUARY HIT AN OLD ENEMY, PIPELINES OF 
THE STATE-OWNED COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM COMPANY 
(ECOPETROL).  ECOPETROL RELEASED A REPORT IN EARLY 
JANUARY SHOWING THAT THE ELN SABOTAGED THEIR 
800-KILOMETER CANO LIMON-COVENAS PIPELINE 134 TIMES 
SINCE THE ATTACKS BEGAN IN 1986 THROUGH 1990.  IN THE 
FIRST MONTH OF 1991, HOWEVER, ECOPETROL AVERAGED A 
GUERRILLA SABOTAGE-ATTACK PER DAY.  THE COMPANY 
ANNOUNCED JANUARY 28 (BOGOTA 1500) THAT ITS OIL 
PIPELINES AND OTHER FACILITIES HAD SUFFERED 28 GUERRILLA 
ATTACKS SINCE JANUARY 1.  TOTAL MONETARY LOSSES WERE 
ESTIMATED AT WELL OVER USDOL 100 MILLION, INCLUDING 
DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT, SPILLED CRUDE AND PRODUCTION DELAYS. 
 
...AT A COST TO THE ENVIRONMENT 
------------------------------- 
8. (U) ASIDE FROM THE ECONOMIC LOSSES, THE PIPELINE 
ATTACKS HAVE DAMAGED THE ENVIRONMENT.  ACCORDING TO 
ECOPETROL, THE SPILLAGE OF CRUDE DUE TO GUERRILLA 
SABOTAGE ADVERSELY HAS AFFECTED THE COUNTRY\'S FLORA AND 
FAUNA.  ACCORDING TO ECOPETROL STATISTICS, OVER THE 
YEARS TERRORISM HAS BATHED THE COUNTRY\'S ECOLOGICAL 
RESERVES IN 650,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE.  TWO GUERRILLA 
ATTACKS JANUARY 23 AGAINST THE CANO-LIMON PIPELINE IN 
NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT SPILLED 15,000 BARRELS OF 
CRUDE, POLLUTING TWO RIVERS THAT PROVIDE WATER FOR 
IRRIGATION IN THE REGION (BOGOTA 1229).  THE ELN, WHO 
HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN THE GROUP TARGETING PIPELINES, HAS 
A RECORD OF ECOLOGICAL TERRORISM, HAVING RESORTED TO 
POISONING CREEKS TO KILL FISH AND TORCHING FORESTS. 
 
FARC AND ELN -- PARTNERS IN CRIME 
--------------------------------- 
9. (C) THERE IS CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE OF INCREASED 
FARC/ELN COOPERATION.  THOUGH THE TWO HAVE LONG BEEN 
SUPPOSEDLY UNITED UNDER THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA 
COORDINATOR UMBRELLA, THERE WAS LITTLE REAL COORDINATED 
FIELD ACTIVITY.  THAT IS NOW CHANGING, THOUGH THE ELN 
MAY HAVE CREDITED THE FARC WITH SOME OF ITS OWN 
ASSAULTS, IN AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE THE APPEARANCE OF A 
POTENT FARC PRESENCE IN AREAS WHERE THE FARC HAD BEEN 
UNABLE TO MOUNT ATTACKS.  SOME ELN ASSAULTS ON THE 
CANO-LIMON PIPELINE WERE CLAIMED ON BEHALF OF THE FARC. 
 
ATTACKS FOLLOW A PATTERN 
------------------------ 
10. (C) THERE HAS BEEN A PATTERN TO THE TACTICS USED BY 
THE GUERRILLAS.  GENERALLY, ATTACKS HAVE BEEN 
PERPETRATED BY SMALL GROUPS -- SOMETIMES AS SMALL AS 
FOUR GUERRILLAS.  THE GUERRILLAS HAVE STAGED LOW-RISK, 
HIT-AND-RUN ATTACKS, MAKING MAXIMUM USE OF SURPRISE, 
AMBUSHING POLICE OR ARMY PATROLS OR SABOTAGING THE 
ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, 
ALTHOUGH AT TIMES AIMED AT PRE-DETERMINED OBJECTIVES, 
BECAME INCREASINGLY INDISCRIMINATE. 
 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
11. (C) THE GUERRILLAS\' STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO DEMONSTRATE 
THAT THEY ARE NOT DEFEATED MILITARILY.  THERE IS 
CONSIDERABLE SPECULATION THAT THE FARC WANTS TO LAY DOWN 
ITS ARMS AND IS TRYING TO BETTER ITS NEGOTIATING 
POSITION BY HITTING THE GOVERNMENT WHERE IT HURTS--IN 
THE POCKETBOOKS OF THOSE WHO EARN FOREIGN EXCHANGE.  THE 
OFFENSIVE INDICATES THAT THE FARC AND ELN, UNLIKE THE 
M-19 WHEN IT LAID DOWN ARMS, ARE NOT YET BEATEN.  THE 
FARC MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HIT THE HARD MILITARY TARGETS IT 
HIT A FEW YEARS AGO OR IT MAY BE THAT IT DOES NOT WANT 
TO.  IT DOES, HOWEVER, PACK A MILITARY PUNCH THAT THE 
COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES ARE INCAPABLE OF CHECKING.  IF 
THE INSURGENTS CAN SUSTAIN THEIR JANUARY LEVEL OF 
VIOLENCE OVER THE COMING MONTHS, THE COUNTRY MAY FIND 
ITSELF IN SERIOUS ECONOMIC STRAITS.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  UPDATE ON FARC \"EXECUTION\" GRAVEYARD 
 
REF:  BOGOTA 5253 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  DURING A MAY 20 CONVERSATION WITH CHARGE AND POLOFF, 
PRESIDENTIAL HUMAN RIGHTS ADVISOR JORGE ORLANDO MELO 
DISCUSSED THE FARC GRAVEYARD UNCOVERED BY THE ARMY IN LA 
URIBE, META DEPARTMENT EARLIER THIS YEAR (REFTEL).  MELO 
SAID HIS INFORMATION WAS NOT FIRST-HAND AND THAT HE DOES 
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INVESTIGATIVE FILES ON THE CASE 
WHICH, UNDER COLOMBIAN LAW, ARE SECRET.  HE HAS, 
HOWEVER, HEARD THAT A TOTAL OF ABOUT SIXTY BODIES WERE 
FOUND IN THE AREA, WHICH IS IN THE VICINITY OF THE 
FARC\'S FORMER \"CASA VERDE\" HEADQUARTERS.  SOME OF THOSE 
BURIED MAY HAVE DIED NATURAL DEATHS OR FROM COMBAT 
WOUNDS, WHILE SOME 25 WERE SAID TO HAVE DIED OF AN 
EXECUTION STYLE BULLET TO THE HEAD. 
 
3.  INITIAL PRESS REPORTS HAD SUGGESTED THERE MIGHT BE 
UP TO THREE HUNDRED BODIES AND IMPLIED THE MAJORITY HAD 
BEEN EXECUTED.  MELO SAID DEFENSE MINSTER BOTERO HAD 
PRIVATELY TOLD HIM THAT THE PRESS EXAGGERATED THE 
STORY.  MELO, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO THINK THE MILITARY WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INITIAL INFLATED ACCOUNTS. 
 
4.  COMMENT:  SINCE THE INITIAL SPURT OF PUBLICITY THE 
FARC GRAVEYARD STORY HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE PRESS. 
PROCURADURIA AND PRIVATE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP SOURCES HAVE 
BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH ANY INFORMATION ON THE 
CASE.  THE REPORT OF SOME 25 EXECUTIONS, IF ACCURATE, 
WOULD BE DAMNING EVIDENCE OF THE FARC\'S ATROCIOUS HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD.  THE PROPAGANDA VALUE OF THIS FIND, 
HOWEVER, HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED BY THE ARMY\'S 
APPARENTLY EXAGGERATED INITIAL CLAIMS.

SUBJECT:  COLOMBIAN COMMUNISTS WANT TO TAKE OVER FARC 
 
REF:  BOGOTA 1956 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  ROBERTO SAENZ VARGAS, YOUNGER BROTHER OF 
FARC LEADER ALFONSO CANO (NOM DE GUERRE OF GUILLERMO 
LEON SAENZ VARGAS), AND FARC GO-BETWEEN MORRIS 
ACKERMAN SEPARATELY HAVE TOLD POLOFF THAT HARDLINERS 
WHO NOW CONTROL THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCC), 
HAVE DETERMINED TO WORK TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE 
COLOMBIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES (FARC) INSURGENT 
GROUP AS WELL AS GUERRILLA PEACE TALKS WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT.  THE PCC\'S FIVE-MEMBER SECRETARIAT WOULD 
REPLACE THE FARC\'S, AND AS DID SALVADORAN PARTY CHIEF 
SCHAFIK HANDAL, PCC GENERAL SECRETARY ALVARO VASQUEZ 
DEL REAL WOULD HEAD THE GUERRILLA NEGOTIATING TEAM. 
IN OUR VIEW, FARC HEAD MANUEL MARULANDA VELEZ WOULD 
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN \"ONLY OVER HIS DEAD BODY.\"  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
COMMUNISM\'S COLLAPSE HAS ONLY SERVED TO HARDEN PCC 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
3.  RECENT CHANGES IN COLOMBIA AND THE REST OF THE 
WORLD, INCLUDING THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM 
INTERNATIONALLY, ACCORDING TO ACKERMAN, HAVE ONLY 
HARDENED THE ORTHODOX COLOMBIAN PARTY\'S RESOLVE IN 
FAVOR OF PROLONGED CAMPESINO-BASED ARMED STRUGGLE 
(THROUGH THE FARC).  SAENZ, WHO QUIT THE PARTY IN 
NOVEMBER, CALLED THE PCC \"THE ONLY COMMUNIST PARTY IN 
THE WORLD THAT HASN\'T CHANGED.\"  ACCORDING TO SAENZ 
AND ACKERMAN, THE PCC\'S DECISION TO TAKE OVER THE FARC 
STEMS PARTIALLY FROM ITS DISSATISFACTION WITH THE 
GUERRILLAS\' CONDUCT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS (NOW RECESSED) 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  THE PCC IS NOT HAPPY THAT UNDER 
CANO, THE CHIEF GUERRILLA NEGOTIATOR, THE TALKS WERE 
ALLOWED TO DRIFT INTO NOTHING MORE THAN NEGOTIATIONS 
FOR A CEASE FIRE (IN WHICH THE PCC HAS NO INTEREST), 
AND ACCOMPLISHED FEW OF THE GUERRILLAS\' AND THE PCC\'S 
POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. 
 
 
REYES AND CHACON:  MR. INSIDE AND MR. OUTSIDE 
--------------------------------------------- 
4.  TWO PERSONS EXPECTED TO PLAY KEY ROLES IN THE 
PARTY\'S EFFORTS TO TAKE OVER THE INSURGENCY ARE FARC 
SECRETARIAT MEMBER RAUL REYES, LONG \"THE PARTY\'S MAN\" 
IN THE FARC\'S FIVE-MEMBER DIRECTORATE, AND PCC 
ORGANIZATION SECRETARY AND SECRETARIAT MEMBER MILLER 
CHACON (NOM DE GUERRE: \"MISAEL\").  ACKERMAN SAID THAT 
EACH DAY SOMEONE FROM THE PCC\'S SECRETARIAT TRAVELS TO 
VISIT THE FARC\'S.  THE PCC IS AFRAID TO LEAVE THE 
FARC\'S HIERARCHY ALONE FOR EVEN A MINUTE, ACKERMAN SAID. 
 
 
WILL ANYONE IN FARC TOP BRASS STOP THE PARTY? 
--------------------------------------------- 
5.  OF THE FARC\'S FIVE SECRETARIAT MEMBERS, ACKERMAN 
SAID THE PCC HOPES TO WIN OVER FARC HEAD MANUEL 
MARULANDA VELEZ (AKA \"TIROFIJO\"); THAT WOULD INSURE 
THE ACQUIESCENCE OF TIMOLEON JIMENEZ, TIROFIJO\'S 
PROTEGE.  THE PPC ALSO HOPES TO SET CANO AND IVAN 
MARQUEZ AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, NEUTRALIZING BOTH.  RAUL 
REYES ALREADY IS FIRMLY IN THE PARTY\'S CAMP.  WHILE 
ACKERMAN SAW TIROFIJO (\"MORE A GUERRILLA THAN A 
COMMUNIST\") AS THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO THE REALIZATION OF 
THE PARTY\'S GOAL, SAENZ DIDN\'T THINK ANYONE INSIDE THE 
FARC SECRETARIAT, ALL PARTY MEMBERS, POSED A PROBLEM. 
SAENZ SAID THAT MORE OF A HINDRANCE WAS THE PCC\'S OWN 
SECRETARIAT, NOT ALL OF WHOM AGREE ON TAKING DIRECT 
CONTROL OF THE INSURGENCY. 
 
 
THE FARC IS ALL THE PARTY HAS LEFT 
---------------------------------- 
6.  SAENZ AND ACKERMAN AGREED THAT ANOTHER PCC 
MOTIVATION WAS THE DETERIORATION OF ITS INFLUENCE OVER 
OTHER, MOSTLY URBAN SECTORS OF COLOMBIAN SOCIETY, 
INCLUDING TRADE UNION (E.G., CUT, AND THE PETROLEUM 
WORKERS\' USO) AND ARTISTIC MOVEMENTS (E.G., THEATER 
AND WRITERS GROUPS).  FOR THE PCC, SAENZ SAID, \"ONLY 
THE FARC REMAINS.\"  SAENZ SAID THE FARC CONTINUES TO 
HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RURAL SUPPORT, SOME THROUGH 
INTIMIDATION. 
 
 
CANO AND OTHER \'80S HOPEFULS:  PARTY\'S LOST GENERATION 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
7.  THE PARTY IN THE 1980S SENT SEVERAL BRIGHT, YOUNG 
ACTIVISTS TO THE FARC OSTENSIBLY TO PROVIDE THE 
CAMPESINO MOVEMENT WITH POLITICAL ADVICE.  THEIR 
ACTUAL OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXTEND THE PARTY\'S INFLUENCE 
OVER THE INSURGENCY, AS THE PARTY EARLIER HAD DONE 
WITH JACOBO ARENAS, WHO HEADED THE FARC UNTIL HIS 
AUGUST 1990 DEATH FROM A HEART ATTACK. 
 
8.  THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST OF THE 1980S CROP WAS 
ALFONSO CANO, OVER WHOM THE PCC REALIZES IT HAS LOST 
CONTROL.  HE\'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.  SAENZ SAID THE 
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF BEING A GUERRILLA CHANGED THE 
YOUNG TURKS.  MANY, ACCORDING TO ACKERMAN, UPON 
STRAPPING A GUN ON THEIR HIP AND GAINING SOME 
INDIVIDUAL POWER, NOT TO MENTION THE MONEY FROM THE 
GUERRILLAS\' LUCRATIVE ACTIVITIES, BEGAN TO FEEL THEY 
DIDN\'T HAVE TO TAKE ORDERS ANYMORE FROM PARTY LEADERS 
IN BOGOTA.  IT IS PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF FAILURE OF THE 
PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE THE FARC THAT THE PARTY 
NOW WANTS TO TAKE FULL CONTROL OF THE GUERRILLA GROUP. 
 
9.  ACCORDING TO SAENZ, THE PROBLEM FOR THE PARTY IS 
DEEPER.  ACCUSING PARTY LEADERS WHO HAVE NEVER RUN FOR 
PUBLIC OFFICE OF BEING DETACHED FROM \"THE REAL WORLD,\" 
SAENZ, A FORMER CITY COUNCIL ALTERNATE AND 
UNSUCCESSFUL HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CANDIDATE, SAID 
BEING A GUERRILLA LEADER OR AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IS FAR 
DIFFERENT FROM BEING A PCC LEADER.  \"YOU BECOME AWARE 
OF REAL PEOPLES\' CONCERNS, AND IT CHANGES YOU.\"  IT 
CHANGED SCHAFIK HANDAL AND THE SALVADORAN PARTY, SAENZ 
SAID, AND IT WOULD CHANGE THE PCC. 
 
 
PARTY TAKEOVER WOULD EXPOSE THE FARC FOR WHAT IT IS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
10.  FOR THAT REASON, SAENZ, DISAGREEING WITH 
ACKERMAN, THOUGHT IT WOULD BENEFIT THE PEACE PROCESS 
FOR THE PARTY TO TAKE OVER THE FARC AND THE TALKS. 
BESIDES, SAENZ SAID, SUCH A TAKEOVER WOULD REVEAL TO 
THE PUBLIC THE DECADES-LONG LINK BETWEEN THE PCC AND 
FARC, EXPOSING TO THE FARC\'S RURAL SUPPORTERS THAT ITS 
AGENDA IS THE SAME COMMUNIST ONE DISCREDITED 
WORLDWIDE.  SAENZ WOULD THEREFORE LIKE THE PCC TO 
COMPETE OPENLY IN ELECTIONS INSTEAD OF THROUGH ITS 
ELECTORAL FRONT, THE PATRIOTIC UNION (UP). 
 
11.  COMMENT:  BASED ON WHAT MOST SOURCES HAVE SAID 
ABOUT TIROFIJO, ALTHOUGH A LOYAL PARTY MEMBER, WE 
BELIEVE \"ONLY OVER HIS DEAD BODY\" WOULD HE LET ANYONE, 
EVEN THE PCC, TAKE OVER \"HIS\" MOVEMENT.  FOR THAT 
REASON, THE PARTY\'S GOAL OF TAKING OVER THE FARC HAS 
TO BE VIEWED AS A LONG-TERM PROJECT, WITH THE 
 
POSSIBILITY OF BEING REALIZED ONLY AFTER TIROFIJO (IN 
HIS 60S) PASSES FROM THE SCENE.  END COMMENT.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE HIGHEST DECISION-MAKING BODY OF THE 
REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC), COLOMBIA\'S 
OLDEST AND LARGEST GUERRILLA GROUP, IS ITS FIVE-MEMBER 
GENERAL SECRETARIAT, COMPOSED SINCE AUGUST 1990 OF 
LEGENDARY FARC HEAD MANUEL MARULANDA VELEZ (\"TIROFIJO\"), 
POLITICAL CHIEF ALFONSO CANO, RAUL REYES, TIMOLEON JIMENEZ 
AND IVAN MARQUEZ.  THE FIVE COME FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, 
AND THE FARC\'S HISTORICAL DISTINCTIONS -- CAMPESINOS VS. 
INTELLECTUALS, OLDTIMERS VS. NEWCOMERS -- ARE EVIDENT 
AMONG THEM.  THE SECRETARIAT, WHICH HAS BEEN REFERRED TO 
AS \"SNOW WHITE AND THE FOUR DWARFS\" TO ILLUSTRATE THE 
DIFFERENCE IN STATURE BETWEEN MARULANDA AND THE REST, CAN 
ALSO BE CHARACTERIZED AS FOUR HARDLINERS VS. ONE MODERATE, 
CANO.  A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE FARC IS THAT THERE 
APPEARS TO BE NO ONE CAPABLE OF REPLACING MARULANDA, THE 
GLUE THAT HOLDS THE FARC TOGETHER.  THIS CABLE PROVIDES 
BIOGRAPHIES OF THE FIVE FARC SECRETARIAT MEMBERS, AND 
FULFILLS THE POST REPORTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS FOR BIOS ON 
THE SECRETARIAT (JUNE) AND MARULANDA (AUGUST).  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
------------ 
 
3.  POLOFF GLEANED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FROM MANY 
CONVERSATIONS OVER THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR WITH SEVERAL 
CONTACTS, INCLUDING, FIRST AND FOREMOST, COLOMBIAN 
BUSINESSMAN MORITZ AKERMAN.  AKERMAN IS AN EX-COMMUNIST 
PARTY ACTIVIST WHO IS CLOSE TO ALFONSO CANO AND KNOWS IVAN 
MARQUEZ.  INFORMATION WAS ALSO DERIVED FROM CANO\'S 
BROTHER, ROBERTO SAENZ (HIMSELF A COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVIST 
UNTIL NOVEMBER 1991); CARLOS EDUARDO JARAMILLO, A GOC 
PEACE NEGOTIATOR FOR FIVE YEARS WHO KNOWS CANO AND MARQUEZ 
WELL AND HAS MET MARULANDA AND THE REST AT THE FARC\'S 
FORMER CASA VERDE SANCTUARY; ACADEMIC GUERRILLA EXPERT 
EDUARDO PIZARRO, EX-COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVIST AND BROTHER 
OF ASSASSINATED M-19 HEAD CARLOS PIZARRO, AND OTHERS. 
 
4.  BECAUSE OF THEIR WORK AS GUERRILLA PEACE NEGOTIATORS 
FRON, JUNE 1991-JUNE 1992, CANO AND MARQUEZ ARE WELL-KNOWN 
OUTSIDE OF THE FARC.  CANO IS BY FAR THE BEST-KNOWN 
SECRETARIAT MEMBER IN BOGOTA, DESPITE HIS DOZEN YEARS IN 
CLANDESTINITY.  AKERMAN, PIZARRO AND JARAMILLO WERE 
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY CLASSMATES OF CANO\'S.  MARULANDA, A 
LIVING LEGEND, OBVIOUSLY IS WELL-KNOWN.  RAUL REYES IS 
KNOWN IN BOGOTA BECAUSE OF HIS LINKS TO THE PARTY\'S 
HIERARCHY.  THE LEAST KNOWN BY FAR (AT LEAST IN THE 
CAPITAL) IS TIMOLEON JIMENEZ, A CAMPESINO WHO GREW UP IN 
THE INSURGENCY. 
 
 
MANUEL MARULANDA:  MORE CAMPESINO THAN COMMUNIST 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
5.  THE FARC HAS BEEN CALLED AN ARMY OF SEVERAL COLONELS 
BUT ONLY ONE GENERAL;  MANUEL MARULANDA VELEZ IS THAT 
GENERAL.  AT 64, MARULANDA IS LATIN AMERICA\'S OLDEST AND 
MOST EXPERIENCED GUERRILLA LEADER.  HE\'S BEEN AN INSURGENT 
FOR 43 YEARS, SINCE BEFORE CASTRO\'S REVOLUTION. 
 
6.  IN 1949, DURING COLOMBIA\'S LIBERAL/CONSERVATIVE CIVIL 
WAR, KNOWN AS \"LA VIOLENCIA,\" MARULANDA (REAL NAME PEDRO 
ANTONIO MARIN), JOINED THE LIBERAL GUERRILLA OPPOSITION TO 
THE CONSERVATIVE DICTATORSHIP.  WHILE MARULANDA BEGAN AS A 
LIBERAL GUERRILLA, BY THE TIME LA VIOLENCIA HAD ENDED HE 
HAD BECOME A COMMUNIST REBEL LEADER.  LIKE MANY OF THE 
COMMUNIST INSURGENCY\'S EARLY LEADERS, MARULANDA HAILS FROM 
AND BEGAN HIS GUERRILLA CAREER IN TOLIMA. 
 
7.  THE NOM DE GUERRE MANUEL MARULANDA VELEZ WAS ADOPTED 
FROM THE COMMUNIST LABOR LEADER OF THE SAME NAME, A 
PARTICIPANT IN THE VIOLENT 1925 LABOR STRIFE AND LATER A 
FOUNDER OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCC).  THE 
COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES GAVE MARULANDA (MARIN) THE 
NICKNAME \"TIROFIJO\" (SURE SHOT), WHICH HAS STUCK.  INSIDE 
THE INSURGENCY, HOWEVER, WHERE IT\'S CONSIDERED SOMEWHAT 
PEJORATIVE, NO ONE CALLS HIM THAT; HE\'S \"COMANDANTE 
MARULANDA\" TO HIS FARC UNDERLINGS. 
 
8.  THERE ARE MANY SIDES TO MARULANDA.  HE\'S A CAMPESINO, 
GUERRILLA, COMMUNIST, SOLDIER, POLITICIAN, ALL ROLED INTO 
ONE.  HE IS, HOWEVER, A CAMPESINO LEADER FIRST, A 
COMMUNIST SECOND; MORE ZAPATA OR PANCHO VILLA THAN LENIN 
OR STALIN. 
 
9.  VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT SINCE LEADING HIS 
OWN \"GREAT MARCH\" OF HUNDREDS OF FOLLOWERS AFTER THE ARMED 
FORCES\' EXPLUSION OF THE FARC FROM ITS CASA VERDE 
SANCTUARY IN DECEMBER 1990 (FOUR MONTHS AFTER BECOMING FARC 
HEAD) MARULANDA HAS BEEN FEELING MESSIANIC AND SOMEWHAT 
LIKE MAO, WHOSE 1949 REVOLUTION STRONGLY INFLUENCED THE 
PCC AND FARC. 
 
10.  AN UNEDUCATED CAMPESINO, MARULANDA IS RESPECTED BOTH 
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE INSURGENCY FOR HIS MILITARY SKILLS, 
BUT HAS NEVER PROFESSED TO HAVE POLITICAL SAVVY.  NOR DOES 
HE HAVE POLITICAL AMBITIONS; HE HAS NO INTEREST IN A 
POST-INSURGENCY POLITICAL CAREER. 
 
11.  MARULANDA HAS NEITHER A GRAND VISION FOR COLOMBIA, 
NOR A SPECIFIC POLITICAL AGENDA.  HE DOESN\'T KNOW 
PRECISELY WHAT HE\'S FIGHTING FOR.  HIS MOTIVATION IS THE 
WELFARE OF \"HIS PEOPLE,\" I.E., CAMPESINOS.  WHILE THE 
GOVERNMENT TALKS ABOUT ENDING THE INSURGENCY, MARULANDA\'S 
CONCERN IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO CAMPESINOS IF THEIR 
SELF-DEFENSE ARMY (THE FARC) DISAPPEARS. 
 
12.  OTHER THAN HIS ADOPTED COMMUNISM, MARULANDA HAS NO 
FIRM POLITICAL BELIEFS.  HE USUALLY SIDES WITH FARC/PCC 
HARDLINERS, BUT A MORE PROMINENT FEATURE OF HIS 
PERSONALITY APPEARS TO BE HIS MALLEABILITY; MARULANDA IS 
OPEN TO PERSUASION.  HE VARYINGLY HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE 
A HARDLINER AND TO HAVE BEEN WON OVER TO HIS POLITICAL 
CHIEF ALFONSO CANO\'S PRO-NEGOTIATED-PEACE POSITION.  AT 
THE SAME TIME, HE HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE MORE UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF BOTH THE PCC AUD THE ELN THAN HIS 
PREDECESSOR, JACOBO ARENAS. 
 
13.  INDEED, ONE CRITICISM OF MARULANDA IS THAT HE HAS 
PRESIDED OVER THE \"ELENIZATION\" OF THE FARC, I.E., THAT 
UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP (BEGINNING WITH THE DEATH OF JACOBO 
ARENAS IN AUGUST 1990) THE FARC HAS ADOPTED MANY OF THE 
ELN\'S MILITARY TACTICS (E.G., ECONOMIC TERRORISM) WHILE 
MARULANDA HIMSELF HAS FALLEN INCREASING UNDER ELN HEAD 
MANUEL PEREZ\' IDEOLOGICAL/POLITICAL INFLUENCE. 
 
14.  ONE PERSON\'S ADVICE MARULANDA NEVER HAS SOUGHT IS 
FIDEL CASTRO\'S.  MARULANDA NEVER HAS HAD VERY CLOSE 
RELATIONS WITH THE CUBAN LEADER, WHOM MARULANDA PREDATES 
AS A GUERRILLA AND NEVER HAS FIGURED HE HAD MUCH TO LEARN 
FROM.  MARULANDA HAS TURNED DOWN SEVERAL INVITATIONS TO 
VISIT CUBA.  ONE RESULT IS THAT, TYPICAL OF FARC MILITARY 
LEADERS, MARULANDA HAS NO FORMAL MILITARY TRAINING. 
 
15.  VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE TALKED ABOUT MARULANDA\'S 
ISOLATION IN THE JUNGLE; HE IS SAID TO BE OUT OF TOUCH 
WITH REALITY.  MARULANDA RECEIVES VERY LITTLE INFORMATION 
FROM THE WORLD OUTSIDE HIS JUNGLE RETREATS OTHER THAN THAT 
EDITED BY HIS PCC VISITORS.  CANO IS SAID TO BE UNABLE TO 
COMMUNICATE TO HIM WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE 
HIS JUNGLE HAUNTS. 
 
16.  MARULANDA LAST VISITED A CITY, NEIVA IN HUILA 
DEPARTMENT (1985 POP. 178,000; HARDLY A METROPOLIS), IN 
1963.  HE REPORTEDLY NEVER HAS FLOWN ON AN AIRPLANE, NEVER 
LEFT COLOMBIA.  ONE REASON HE REFUSES TO COME DOWN FROM 
THE MOUNTAINS IS HIS PARANOID FEAR FOR HIS LIFE.  HE IS 
SAID TO FULLY TRUST NO ONE.  THE PERSONS HE TRUSTS MOST 
ARE THOSE FEW FELLOW FARC GUERRILLAS WITH HIM SINCE THE 
EARLY YEARS. 
 
17.  FARC CONFIDANT MORITZ AKERMAN RELATED THE STORY OF 
HOW MARULANDA ONCE RECEIVED A GIFT BOTTLE OF WHISKEY (HIS 
FAVORITE DRINK) FROM CASTRO.  FEARING BEING POISONED, 
TIROFIJO REFUSED TO DRINK IT, INSISTING ON THE BOTTLE 
BEING BROKEN IN FRONT OF HIM.  TIROFIJO ALSO, ACCORDING TO 
AKERMAN, REFUSED TO TAKE PILLS CANO BROUGHT BACK FOR HIM 
FROM HIS NOVEMBER 1991 VISIT TO CUBA. 
 
 
ALFONSO CANO:  CITY-SMART BOY STUCK IN A CAMPESINO ARMY 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
18.  THE FARC\'S SECRETARIAT CAN BE VIEWED IN GENERAL AS 
FOUR PRO-ARMED STRUGGLE HARDLINERS AGAINST ONE 
PRO-NEGOTIATED PEACE MODERATE, ALFONSO CANO.  GUILLERMO 
LEON SAENZ VARGAS (ALIAS ALFONSO CANO) IS THE SECOND IN 
COMMAND AND THE FARC\'S IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL LEADER. 
CANO, MID-40S, IS FROM BOGOTA, WHERE HE STUDIED 
ANTHROPOLOGY AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, WHERE THE BEST 
BRAINS IN A GENERATION OF COLOMBIAN LEFTISTS WERE 
GATHERED.  AT THE TIME, SAENZ (THE NON DE GUERRE WAS 
ADOPTED WHEN HE JOINED THE INSURGENCY) WAS ACTIVE IN THE 
COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY\'S YOUTH MOVEMENT, JUCO.  IN THE 
EARLY 1980S, JUST BEFORE COMPLETING HIS STUDIES, CANO LEFT 
TO JOIN THE FARC\'S RURAL INSURGENCY. 
 
19.  CANO HAS NEVER COMMANDED A FRONT; INDEED, HE HAS NO 
MILITARY EXPERIENCE.  FROM DAY ONE, HIS JOB HAS BEEN TO 
PROVIDE THE CAMPESINO ARMY WITH POLITICAL LEADERSHIP.  HE 
REPORTEDLY WAS CLOSE TO FARC HEAD JACOBO ARENAS UNTIL HIS 
AUGUST 1990 HEART-ATTACK DEATH, AT WHICH TIME CANO 
REPLACED ARENAS AS THE FARC\'S POLITICAL/IDEOLOGICAL CHIEF. 
 
20.  CANO WAS THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST OF A CROP OF JUCO 
ACTIVISTS THE PARTY SENT TO THE FARC IN THE EARLY 1980S 
OSTENSIBLY TO PROVIDE THE GUERRILLA GROUP WITH POLITICAL 
ADVICE, BUT ACTUALLY TO MAINTAIN THE PARTY\'S INFLUENCE 
OVER THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING INSURGENCY. 
 
21.  ARENAS\' DEATH LEFT CANO FAR AND AWAY THE MOST 
INTELLECTUALLY CAPABLE GUERRILLA LEADER, FARC OR ELN. 
THAT SUPERIOR INTELLECT, HOWEVER, COMBINED WITH HIS LACK 
OF MILITARY SKILLS AND THE FACT THAT HE IS AN EDUCATED 
\"CITY BOY\" IN A CAMPESINO ARMY, HAS STEERED HIM TOWARD 
BECOMING A SPOKESMAN/NEGOTIATOR/DIPLOMAT FOR THE 
INSURGENCY, RATHER THAN A LEADER OF IT.  (FOR EXAMPLE, A 
PROBLEM FOR THE PEACE TALKS IS THAT CANO HAS LACKED 
DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY.) 
 
22.  SEVERAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED CANO TO BE THE 
CONSUMATE DIPLOMAT, NEVER LOSING CONTROL OF HIMSELF OR 
HIS TEMPER, ALWAYS CHOOSING HIS WORDS CAREFULLY.  THAT\'S 
EVIDENT IN BROADCAST INTERVIEWS.  CARLOS EDUARDO 
JARAMILLO, WHO AS A GOC NEGOTIATOR SAT ACROSS THE TABLE 
FROM CANO FROM JUNE-NOVEMBER 1991 IN CARACAS, CREDITED 
CANO WITH KEEPING THE NEGOTIATING SESSIONS MOVING 
FORWARD.  BY CONTRAST, JARAMILLO CHARACTERIZED THE OTHER 
CGSB NEGOTIATORS, INCLUDING IVAN MARQUEZ, AS \"MILITARY 
TYPES\" WHO WOULD STATE THEIR POSITION, THEN REFUSE TO 
BUDGE.  HE CREDITED CANO WITH ALWAYS MANEUVERING TO AVOID 
OR RESOLVE QUARRELS. 

23.  EVERYONE AGREES CANO IS THE CGSB\'S MOST ACTIVE 
CATALYST FOR A NEGOTIATED END TO THE INSURGENCY.  CANO 
UNDERSTANDS THAT THE INSURGENCY IS DEFEATED POLITICALLY, 
IF NOT YET MILITARILY.  HE KNOWS THE ARMED STRUGGLE HAS NO 
FUTURE, NOR HE IN IT.  CANO ALSO MAY BE EXPERIENCING A 
\"MID-LIFE CRISIS,\" DREADING SPENDING THE REST OF HIS LIFE 
AS A GUERRILLA, AS DID ARENAS.  HE WOULD LIKE TO DO 
SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE IT\'S TOO LATE.  AS AKERMAN ONCE TOLD 
POLOFF, \"CANO WOULD RATHER BE NO. 50 IN SOMETHING THAT HAS 
A FUTURE THAN NO. 2 IN A DEAD-END VENTURE.\"  CANO WOULD 
LIKE TO TRY HIS HAND AT POLITICS, BUT IS TRAPPED IN THE 
INSURGENCY.  HE REALIZES THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT 
ALIVE IS TO BRING THE REST OF THE FARC WITH HIM, I.E., TO 
NEGOTIATE AN END TO THEIR ARMED STRUGGLE.  BECAUSE HE IS 
THE INSURGENCY\'S MOST PRO-PEACE LEADER, THE GOC WOULD 
PREFER TO DEAL WITH CANO THAN ANY OTHER GUERRILLA. 
 
24.  CANO HAS HIS FOLLOWERS IN THE FARC, AND IF HE LEFT 
THE INSURGENCY, POSSIBLY COULD TAKE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION 
(ESTIMATES VARY FROM 30-70 PERCENT) OF THE GUERRILLA GROUP 
WITH HIM.  CANO, HOWEVER, PREFERS TO STRUGGLE FROM WITHIN 
TO DRAG TIROFIJO AND THE ENTIRE FARC INTO A PEACE 
AGREEMENT.  THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE.  IN TAKING THE SLOW, 
INTEGRAL APPROACH, CANO RISKS LOSING THE GOVERNMENT ALONG 
THE WAY (AS THE RECENT GOC TURN TOWARD A MORE MILITARISTIC 
APPROACH HAS SHOWN).  AKERMAN HAS COUNSELED CANO THAT \"HE 
HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN 30,000 INSURGENTS/SYMPATHIZERS AND 
30 MILLION COLOMBIANS.\" 
 
25.  CANO\'S PERSISTENCE IN PUSHING A NEGOTIATED END TO THE 
INSURGENCY HAS EARNED HIM THE WRATH OF HIS HARDLINE 
COMRADES IN BOTH THE FARC AND THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST 
PARTY (PCC).  THE PARTY IS NO MORE MONOLITHIC THAN THE 
FARC, HOWEVER, AND DEPENDING ON THE ISSUE, CANO 
OCCASIONALLY ENJOYS THE PARTY\'S SUPPORT.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
BOTH CANO AND THE PARTY (HISTORICALLY, THE \"BRAINS\" OF THE 
CAMPESINO ARMY) FEAR THEIR LOSS OF INFLUENCE AS MARULANDA 
HAS TURNED TOWARD GREATER IDEOLOGICAL AND TACTICAL ACCORD 
WITH THE ELN. 
 
26.  FEBRUARY\'S DISAPPEARANCE OF CANO\'S ASSISTANT IN 
PUSHING PEACE, FARC MEMBER DANIEL GARCIA, IS EVIDENCE THAT 
FARC/PCC HARDLINERS ARE WILLING TO GET TOUGH.  SHORTLY 
BEFORE HE VANISHED, GARCIA (WHOM THE FARC \"TRIED\" TWICE 
FOR THE BOTCHED 1989 \"COPACABANA\" ARMS DEAL) REPORTEDLY 
SAID HIS ORDEAL WAS \"THE FIRST CHAPTER IN A BOOK ABOUT 
CANO.\"  AT THE JULY 4 RECEPTION, GEN. MANUEL BONNET, THE 
PREVIOUS HEAD OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, TOLD POLOFF HE 
COULDN\'T BELIEVE CANO RECENTLY HAD OPTED TO RETURN TO HIS 
GUERRILLA COMRADES IN THE COLOMBIAN JUNGLE.  CANO, WHO WAS 
VILIFIED (ALONG WITH GARCIA) AND TEMPORARILY DUMPED AS 
FARC NEGOTIATOR AT A JOINT FARC/PCC MEETING THE LAST TIME 
HE RETURNED HOME, IS KNOWN TO FEAR THAT EACH RETURN TO THE 
BUSH COULD REPRESENT THE BOOK\'S FINAL CHAPTER. 
 
 
RAUL REYES:  THE PARTY\'S MAN 
---------------------------- 
27.  RAUL REYES, THE FARC\'S THIRD-RANKING LEADER, IS IN 
CHARGE OF LOGISTICS AND FINANCES.  IT\'S REYES WHO 
DISPENSES FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE PCC AND THE FARC\'S URBAN 
FRONTS.  LIKE CANO, REYES IS A POLITICAL LEADER WITH NO 
MILITARY EXPERIENCE. 
 
28.  REYES IS THE KEY MAN INSIDE THE FARC IN THE GUERRILLA 
GROUP\'S SIBLING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST 
PARTY.  WHILE ALL FIVE FARC SECRETARIAT MEMBERS ARE PCC 
MEMBERS, REYES SERVES AS \"THE PARTY\'S MAN\" INSIDE THE 
FARC.  WHILE HIS FELLOW SECRETARIAT MEMBERS, WHETHER 
MILITARY OR POLITICAL TYPES, WHETHER CAMPESINOS OR 
INTELLECTUALS, HAVE CLOSER TIES TO THE INSURGENCY THAN TO 
THE PARTY, REYES IS MORE COMMUNIST THAN GUERRILLA.  IN 
THAT RESPECT, REYES IS UNIQUE IN THE FARC HIERARCHY.  FROM 
JACOBO ARENAS TO ALFONSO CANO, THE PARTY, AS A RULE, HAS 
LOST CONTROL OVER THE YOUNG ACTIVISTS IT HAS SENT TO THE 
FARC TO MAINTAIN ITS CONTROL OVER THE INSURGENCY. 
 
29.  REYES IS LINKED TO THE PARTY\'S MOST INFLUENTIAL AND 
RADICAL FACTION, LED BY PARTY SECRETARIAT MEMBER MANUAL 
CEPEDA.  REYES\' MAIN POINT OF CONTACT IN THE PCC IS PARTY 
ORGANIZATION SECRETARY (AND CEPEDA-FACTION NUMBER) MILLER 
CHACON (\"MISAEL\"), WHO REGULARLY TRAVELS FROM BOGOTA TO 
THE FARC\'S SECRETARIAT. 
 
 
TIMOLEON JIMENEZ:  A BROWN-NOSE TO HIS MENTOR, TIROFIJO 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
30.  TIMOLEON JIMENEZ (\"TIMOCHENCO\") IS FOURTH IN COMMAND 
AND IN CHARGE OF MILITARY OPERATIONS. 
 
31.  A CAMPESINO, JIMENEZ JOINED THE FARC AT 13, AND EARLY 
WAS \"ADOPTED\" BY MARULANDA, WITH WHOM HE HAS BEEN EVER 
SINCE.  THE ADOLESCENT JIMENEZ FIRST WAS USED AS A GOPHER 
FOR THE SECRETARIAT, THEN LATER AS A COURIER.  AS A 
TEEN-AGER, JIMENEZ SERVED AS A \"STAFF ASSISTANT\" TO THE 
SECRETARIAT.  HE GREW UP WITH THE SECRETARIAT, AT 
TIROFIJO\'S SIDE. 
 
32.  WHILE MARULANDA HAS MANY SONS IN THE FARC, NONE HAVE 
SPENT AS MUCH TIME WITH HIM OR ARE AS CLOSE TO HIM AS 
JIMENEZ, HIS CHOSEN PROTEGE.  THERE IS LIKELY NO ONE THE 
PARANOID TIROFIJO TRUSTS MORE.  JIMENEZ IS THE ONE MEMBER 
OF THE SECRETARIAT WHO IS NEVER SEPARATED FROM TIROFI)O. 
33.  JIMENEZ IS A REPLICA OF MARULANDA.  LIKE HIS MENTOR, 
JIMENEZ IS AN UNEDUCATED CAMPESINO; A MILITARY LEADER (AND 
A NOTED ONE) NOT A POLITICAL ONE.  LIKE TIROFIJO, JIMENEZ 
HAS NO FORMAL MILITARY TRAINING, AND HAS NEVER TRAVELED TO 
CUBA OR THE EAST BLOC. 
 
34.  WHILE FAR FROM BRILLIANT, JIMENEZ IS SMART ENOUGH TO 
KNOW WHAT SIDE HIS BREAD IS BUTTERED ON.  HE ALWAYS AGREES 
WITH TIROFIJO.  MARULANDA BELIEVES IN CONTINUING THE ARMED 
STRUGGLE, THEREFORE SO DOES JIMENEZ. 
 
35.  WHILE JIMENEZ IS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS FELLOW 
SECRETARIAT MEMBERS CANO, REYES AND MARQUEZ, HE REPRESENTS 
A DIFFERENT CURRENT OF GUERRILLA LEADER.  WHILE THEY 
JOINED THE FARC AFTER UNIVERSITY STUDIES AND CIVIL 
POLITICAL ACTIVISM, JIMENEZ AND OTHERS OF HIS ILK ARE 
CAMPESINOS WHO GREW UP IN THE INSURGENCY. 
 

IVAN MARQUEZ:  \"MORE AMBITION THAN BRAINS\" 
----------------------------------------- 
36.  WHEN FARC HEAD JACOBO ARENAS DIED IN AUGUST 1990, AND THE 
REMAINING FOUR FARC GENERAL SECRETARIAT MEMBERS ALL MOVED 
UP A NOTCH (WITH SECOND-IN-COMMANDER MARULANDA REPLACING 
ARENAS), IVAN MARQUEZ WAS ELEVATED TO THE GENERAL 
SECRETARIAT\'S FIFTH AND LOWEST POSITION. 
 
37.  THE SECRETARIAT\'S NEWEST MEMBER IS UNIQUE IN HAVING 
BOTH MILITARY AND POLITICAL CAPABILITY.  MARQUEZ IS A 
PROVEN MILITARY LEADER WITH POLITICAL EXPERIENCE, HAVING 
SERVED BOTH AS A PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) CONGRESSMAN AND A 
CGSB/FARC NEGOTIATOR IN BOTH THE CARACAS AND TLAXCALA 
ROUNDS OF THE PEACE TALKS.  AS HEAD OF THE FARC\'S SOUTHERN 
BLOC IN HIS NATIVE CAQUETA DEPARTMENT BEFORE JOINING THE 
SECRETARIAT, MARQUEZ EARNED RESPECT FOR HIS MILITARY 
LEADERSHIP CAPABILITIES, HAVING ONCE WIPED OUT A 
PARAMILITARY GROUP IN PUTUMAYO DEPARTMENT LINKED TO 
MEDELLIN CARTEL CAPO GONZALO RODRIQUEZ GACHA. 
 
38.  MARQUEZ ALSO IS THE SECRETARIAT\'S MOST ENIGMATIC 
MEMBER.  SOURCES HAVE DIFFERED OVER WHETHER HE IS A 
HARDLINER.  AMONG THOSE DENYING MARQUEZ IS A WARMONGER IS 
FORMER COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVIST ROBERTO SAENZ, BROTHER OF 
MARQUEZ\' NEGOTIATING PARTNER, ALFONSO CANO.  PRESIDENTIAL 
PEACE ADVISER GONZALO DE FRANCISCO HAS DESCRIBED MARQUEZ 
AS \"A HARDLINER THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO BUSINESS WITH.\" 
 
39.  THE TRUTH MAY BE, AS ACADEMIC GUERRILLA EXPERT AND 
EX-COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVIST EDUARDO PIZARRO HAS 
REPORTED, THAT MARQUEZ \"IS NOT A MAN TO LET HIS HEART GET 
IN THE WAY OF HIS AMBITION.\"  PEACE PROCESS PUSHER MORITZ 
AKERMAN, WHO KNOWS MARQUEZ, HAS CHARACTERIZED HIM AS FIRST 
AND FOREMOST AN AMBITIOUS OPPORTUNIST WHO \"BLOWS WITH THE 
PREVAILING WIND.\"  PIZARRO THINKS THAT MARQUEZ SHARES 
CANO\'S BELIEF THAT THE INSURGENCY IS A DEAD-END, BUT THE 
PREVAILING WIND HAPPENS TO COME FROM THE DIRECTION OF 
DOMINANT FARC/PCC HARDLINERS, AND THUS SO BLOWS MARQUEZ. 
 
40.  MARQUEZ HAS VARIOUSLY BEEN REPORTED TO BE IN ACCORD 
WITH CANO, HIS FELLOW FARC NEGOTIATOR, AND AT ODDS WITH 
HIM, WHETHER OUT OF CONVICTION OR BECAUSE OF COMPETING 
AMBITIONS.  MARQUEZ REPORTEDLY SHARES CANO\'S DREAM OF A 
POST-INSURGENCY, POLITICAL CAREER; HOWEVER, WHILE CANO IS 
INTELLECTUALLY BRILLIANT, MARQUEZ IS MEDIOCRE.  ALTHOUGH 
NOT AN UNEDUCATED CAMPESINO LIKE MARULANDA, MARQUEZ LACKS 
CANO\'S INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT.  AKERMAN HAS DESCRIBED 
MARQUEZ AS HAVING \"MORE AMBITION THAN BRAINS.\'\' 
 
41.  MARQUEZ REPORTEDLY WAS NAMED TO THE FARC NEGOTIATING 
TEAM (A) BECAUSE OF HIS POLITICAL EXPERIENCE, (B) BECAUSE 
HE WANTED THE CHANCE IN THE LIMELIGHT, AND (C) TO KEEP AN 
EYE ON CHIEF FARC NEGOTIATOR CANO, WHO\'S TOO MODERATE TO 
HAVE THE FULL CONFIDENCE OF HIS FELLOW SECRETARIAT MEMBERS 
AND THE PCC.  WHEN AFTER THE CARACAS TALKS CANO WAS 
VILIFIED AND TEMPORARILY YANKED AS THE FARC NEGOTIATOR FOR 
BEING TOO SOFT, MARQUEZ WAS NAMED TO HEAD THE NEW HARDLINE 
FARC DELEGATION. 
 
42.  MARQUEZ\' AMBITIONS ARE POLITICAL, NOT MILITARY; HE 
WANTS TO BE THE NEXT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, NOT REPLACE 
TIROFIJO.  IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT HE VIEWS CANO 
(RATHER THAN, FOR EXAMPLE, TIMOLEON JIMENEZ) AS HIS RIVAL, 
EVEN IF THEY MAY BE IN IDEOLOGICAL ACCORD. 
 
43.  MARQUEZ, WHO RECENTLY TOLD AKERMAN HE RECEIVED 
TRAINING IN THE SOVIET UNION,  REPORTEDLY HARBORS DEEP 
HATRED FOR COLOMBIA\'S SECURITY FORCES, WHO TORTURED AND 
KILLED A NON-GUERRILLA BROTHER OF HIS IN CAQUETA. 
 
 
CONCLUSION:  NONE OF THE DWARFS CAN REPLACE SNOW WHITE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
44.  DURING HIS LATE JUNE TRIP TO TLAXCALA, MEXICO, 
AKERMAN FOR THE FIRST TIME HEARD FARC GUERRILLAS TALKING 
ABOUT SUCCESSION TO MARULANDA.  OVER A MEAL, FARC 
NEGOTIATORS PABLO CATATUMBO AND TOMAS LINCE -- BOTH CANO 
SUPPORTERS -- SAID THE PERSON MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED 
MARULANDA WAS TIMOLEON JIMENEZ.  JIMENEZ WAS SAID TO ENJOY 
THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING MARULANDA\'S MOST TRUSTED 
CONFIDANT, AND OF HAVING THE SUPPORT OF JORGE BRICENO 
SUAREZ (\"MONO JOJOY\"), HEAD OF THE ESTADO MAYOR DEL BLOQUE 
ORIENTAL (EMBO), THE FIVE FARC FRONTS WHOSE PRINCIPAL 
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT THE FARC GENERAL SECRETARIAT. 
 
45.  CATATUMBO AND LINCE NAMED MONO JOJOY AS THE SECOND 
MOST LIKELY TO REPLACE MARULANDA (AFTER JIMENEZ).  MONO 
JOJOY REPORTEDLY IS THE SECRETARIAT\'S FIRST ALTERNATE, 
MEANING HE\'S NEXT IN LINE TO ASCEND TO THE FIVE-MEMBER 
BODY.  JIMENEZ AND MONO JOJOY ARE THE FARC\'S SECOND AND 
THIRD RANKING MILITARY LEADERS BEHIND MARULANDA.  THE 
FARC\'S ESTADO MAYOR (SECOND-TIER LEADERSHIP BODY) AND 
CAMPESINO RANK AND FILE APPEAR TO HAVE A BIAS IN FAVOR OF 
CAMPESINO/MILITARY LEADERS OVER INTELLECTUAL/POLITICAL 
ONES (LIKE CANO AND REYES). 
 
46.  THERE IS A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN STATUTE INSIDE THE 
FARC, HOWEVER, BETWEEN MARULANDA AND THE OTHER FOUR 
SECRETARIAT MEMBERS.  AKERMAN HAS REFERRED TO THE 
SECRETARIAT AS \"SNOW WHITE AND THE FOUR DWARFS\" TO 
ILLUSTRATE THAT DIFFERENCE. 
 
47.  THE FARC FACES A LONG-TERM PROBLEM OF SUCCESSION FOR 
WHICH THERE APPEARS TO BE NO SOLUTION.  MARULANDA, AS 
RESPECTED AS HE IS INSIDE THE FARC, IS INCAPABLE OF FULLY 
REPLACING ARENAS, WHO WAS A MILITARY, POLITICAL AND 
IDEOLOGICAL GIANT.  THERE IS NO ONE, HOWEVER, TO REPLACE 
MARULANDA.  CANO OR REYES, AS INTELLECTUALS IN A CAMPESINO 
ARMY, NEVER WOULD BE ACCEPTED BY THE RANK AND FILE. 
JIMENEZ, WHILE CUT FROM THE SAME MOLD AS MARULANDA, LACKS 
TIROFIJO\'S SYMBOLIC SIGNIFICANCE.  IT IS THE HISTORICAL 
FIGURE OF MARULANDA THAT HAS HELD THE FARC TOGETHER SINCE 
ARENAS\' DEATH.  IN AN ARMY WITH ONE GENERAL AND SEVERAL 
COLONELS, THE COLONELS WILL PROBABLY GO THEIR SEPARATE 
WAYS ONCE THE GENERAL HAS DEPARTED THE SCENE.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (U)  A FARC ATTACK IN GUAVIARE DEPARTMENT SEPTEMBER 6 LEFT A 
REPORTED 22 COLOMBIAN ARMY (COLAR) SOLDIERS DEAD.  THE ATTACK 
INDICATES A DETERMINATION BY THE FARC TO KEEP UP THE OFFENSIVE 
LAUNCHED AUGUST 30 (REF A).  OTHER ATTACKS BY THE FARC AND ELN 
CONTINUE TO UNSETTLE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT COLOMBIA.  MEANWHILE, 
THE FARC CONTINUE TO HOLD CAPTIVE SOME 60 SOLDIERS TAKEN IN THE 
AUGUST 30 ATTACK ON LAS DELICIAS, PUTUMAYO DEPARTMENT, DESPITE 
FARC ASSURANCES THAT IT WOULD RELEASE THEM TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (ICRC -- REF A).  PRESIDENT SAMPER 
ANNOUNCED A THREE-POINT PLAN TO INCREASE GOVERNMENT FORCES\' 
READINESS IN THE FACE OF THE INCREASED GUERRILLA ATTACKS LIKELY 
TO COME.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
FARC KILLS OVER 20 SOLDIERS IN GUAVIARE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  THE FARC FIRST FRONT KILLED 22 SOLDIERS SEPTEMBER 6 IN 
LA CARPA, A PEASANT HAMLET TWO HOURS DISTANT BY RIVER LAUNCH FROM 
SAN JOSE, CAPITAL OF GUAVIARE DEPARTMENT.  ACCORDING TO SEPTEMBER 
8 NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS, 300 TO 400 MEMBERS OF THE THE FARC FIRST 
FRONT UNDER THE COMMAND OF \"MONO JOJOY\" (KNOWN AS THE JUAN JOSE 
RONDON MOBILE COLUMN) ENTERED LA CARPA SEPTEMBER 5 AND, WIELDING 
MACHETES AND KNIVES, INTIMIDATED THE 50 RESIDENTS.  AN 
UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF PEASANTS RECEIVED MINOR WOUNDS.  FIVE 
KILOMETERS FROM LA CARPA, A COLAR SECOND MOBILE BRIGADE PATROL 
UNIT CONSISTING OF 40 SOLDIERS HEARD OF THE HARRASSMENT AND 
INFORMED BRIGADE COMMANDER GENERAL OSPINA, WHO ORDERED THE UNIT 
TO LA CARPA.  IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 
THE UNIT ARRIVED AT LA CARPA, WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY GUERRILLAS 
LYING IN WAIT.  DESPITE THE WARNINGS OF LA CARPA RESIDENTS, THE 
SOLDIERS REMAINED.  AT 6:00 AM GUERRILLAS OPENED MACHINEGUN FIRE 
ON THE TOWN, WOUNDING SEVERAL SOLDIERS.  THE SOLDIERS ATTEMPTED 
TO REPEL THE ATTACK WITH RIFLES BUT WERE CLEARLY SURROUNDED. 
AFTER TWO HOURS OF FIGHTING, GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED FRAGMENTATION 
GRENADES TO FORCE THE SOLDIERS TO GIVE UP.  THE COLAR UNIT 
COMMANDER REQUESTED AIR AND LAND SUPPORT, BUT NONE ARRIVED. 
AFTER THE GRENADE ATTACK, THE SURVIVING SOLDIERS SOUGHT REFUGE IN 
THE JUNGLE, AND THE GUERRILLAS SENT A REPORTED 20 DOBERMAN 
PINSCHERS INTO THE JUNGLE TO LOCATE THE WOUNDED SOLDIERS.  TWO 
HOURS LATER, ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, TRANSPORT HELICOPTERS, 
CARRYING COLAR REINFORCEMENTS, ARRIVED AT THE SCENE.  THEY FOUND 
19 SOLDIERS DEAD, 1O WOUNDED, 11 SURVIVERS, AND TWO MISSING IN 
ACTION.  BY AUGUST 9 THE NUMBER OF DEAD HAD RISEN TO 22 SOLDIERS. 
THE DEAD AND WOUNDED WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE AIRPORT IN SAN JOSE, 
GUAVIARE DEPARTMENT, JUST AS STAFFDEL MACKEY ARRIVED FROM BOGOTA 
THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 7 (REF C). 
 
 
OTHER ATTACKS THROUGHOUT COLOMBIA 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  PRESS ACCOUNTS SEPTEMBER 9 SUMMARIZED OTHER INCIDENTS 
SEEN AS PART OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE AS IT CONTINUED OVER THE 
WEEKEND OF SEPTEMBER 7-8: 
 
--   IN LOS REMEDIOS, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, A CLASH BETWEEN 
     ELN AND GOVERNMENT FORCES SEPTEMBER 8 LEFT TWO SOLDIERS 
     AND ONE GUERRILLA DEAD.  TWO CHILDREN WERE WOUNDED. 
 
--   IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT, THE ARMY KILLED TWO ELN 
     GUERRILLAS ATTEMPTING TO PLACE A BOMB ON A BRIDGE OVER 
     THE CARANAL RIVER. 
 
--   IN ZULIA, NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT, DIALOGUE 
     BETWEEN THE GOC AND CAMPESINOS WAS SUSPENDED.  THE ARMY 
     ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO PREVENT 200 PROTESTING 
     CAMPESINOS FROM ENTERING CUCUTA. 
 
--   IN NARINO DEPARTMENT, GUERRILLAS EXPLODED A SECTION OF 
     THE TRANSANDEAN OIL PIPELINE NEAR THE MUNICIPALITY OF 
     MALLAMA. 
 
--   AUTHORITIES IN NARINO DEPARTMENT SUSPENDED CARGO AND 
     PASSENGER TRAFFIC ON THE ROADS BECAUSE OF GUERRILLA 
     THREATS. 
 
--   MEMBERS OF THE ELN\'S LUIS CARLOS CARDENAS FRONT 
     ASSAULTED THE POLICE STATION IN THE HAMLET OF MAGDALENA 
     IN VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT. 
 
--   IN BARRANCABERMEJA, SANTANDER DEPARTMENT, GUERRILLAS 
     DISTRIBUTED FLYERS ANNOUNCING THEIR INTENTION TO 
     PARALYZE ACTIVITY IN THE AREA FOR FIVE DAYS.  HOWEVER, 
     ACTIVITY REMAINED NORMAL IN BARRANCABERMEJA AS OF 
     SEPTEMBER 8. 
 
--   GUERRILLAS BURNED VEHICLES ON ROADS LEADING TO CUCUTA, 
     NORTE DE SANTANDER, SEVERELY RESTRICTING TRAFFIC. 
 
--   IN THE ATLANTIC COASTAL REGION, GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES 
     RESTRICTED TRAFFIC ON NUMEROUS ROADS. 
 
--   IN SUCRE DEPARTMENT, THREE CAMPESINOS WERE REPORTEDLY 
     KILLED BY A GROUP OF 30 ARMED PARAMILITARIES. 
 
--   IN URABA, THE FIFTH FARC FRONT REPORTEDLY EXECUTED FOUR 
     CAMPESINO LEADERS, CHARGED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION 
     TO THE ARMY, IN A TOWN NEAR APARTADO. 
 
 
THE FARC STILL HOLDS 60 SOLDIERS CAPTIVE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  MEANWHILE, THE FARC CONTINUES TO HOLD THE ESTIMATED 60 
SOLDIERS CAPTURED IN THE ATTACK ON LAS DELICIAS, PUTUMAYO 
DEPARTMENT, DESPITE THE FARC\'S DECLARATION IT WAS PREPARED TO 
RELEASE THE SOLDIERS TO THE ICRC (REF A).  AN APPEAL BY HUMAN 
RIGHTS WATCH FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLDIERS HAS FAILED TO MOVE 
THE FARC LEADERSHIP TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ITS STATED COMMITMENT 
TO THE ICRC.  CRITICS CHARGE THAT THE FARC LEADERSHIP IS USING 
THE HOSTAGE SOLDIERS TO PROTECT ITSELF AND TO GAIN INTERNATIONAL 
ATTENTION.  INTERIOR MINISTER HORACIO SERPA TOLD THE PRESS 
SEPTEMBER 8 THAT THE FARC ARE TRYING TO USE THE RELEASE OF THE 
SOLDIERS AS A NEGOTIATING ARGUMENT IN AN INTERNATIONAL DEBATE ON 
A POSSIBLE DIALOGUE ON PEACE.  SERPA INSISTED THAT IF THE 
GUERRILLA LEADERS ARE COMPLYING WITH NORMS OF INTERNATIONAL 
HUMANITARIAN LAW AS THEY CLAIM TO BE, THERE IS NOTHING TO 
NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOC.  PIERRE GASSMAN, ICRC DIRECTOR IN BOGOTA, 
TOLD THE PRESS HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE GUERRILLAS HOPED TO 
ACHIEVE BY HOLDING THE SOLDIERS, BUT SAID THEY CANNOT, UNDER 
INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, DEMAND ANYTHING IN EXCHANGE FOR 
THE SOLDIERS.  TO DO SO, SAID GASSMAN, WOULD BE TO COMMIT THE 
PUNISHABLE CRIME OF EXTORTION BY KIDNAPPING. 
 
 
SAMPER ANNOUNCES COUNTER-GUERRILLA STRATEGY 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U)  ON SEPTEMBER 8, BOGOTA DAILY \"EL TIEMPO\" REPORTED 
PRESIDENT SAMPER HAD ANNOUNCED HIS ADMINISTRATION\'S INTENTION TO 
EMPLOY THREE KEY STRATEGIES TO COUNTER THE RECENTLY ESCALATED 
GUERRILLA ATTACKS MORE EFFECTIVELY.  ACCORDING TO \"EL TIEMPO,\" 
THE STRATEGIES FOCUS ON INCREASED HUMAN AND ELECTRONIC 
INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING, INCREASED AIR, LAND AND WATER MOBILITY, 
AND UPGRADED COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES.  SAMPER ALSO CALLED ON 
THE COLOMBIAN PUBLIC TO SUPPORT CURRENT PROPOSALS IN CONGRESS TO 
INCREASE THE MILITARY BUDGET AND BROADEN MILITARY JURISDICTIONAL 
PRIVILEGE -- THE \"FUERO MILITAR\" (REF B). 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVE, AND THE FARC LEADERSHIP HAS 
PUBLICLY INDICATED, THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT WILL KEEP UP THE 
PRESSURE ON THE GOC AND THE COLOMBIAN PUBLIC WITH CONTINUED 
ATTACKS IN THE WEEKS TO COME.  CHARACTERIZING THE ATTACKS AS 
RETALIATION AGAINST THE GOC FOR ITS COUNTER-NARCOTICS OPERATIONS, 
ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN, COCA-GROWING REGIONS OF COLOMBIA, DEFENSE 
MINISTER ESGUERRA TOLD THE PRESS THE GUERRILLAS HAVE THE CAPACITY 
TO CONDUCT CONTINUED \"SPECTACULAR\" ATTACKS BUT LACK THE POTENTIAL 
TO OCCUPY MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS OR EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT 
TERRITORIAL CONTROL.  YET THE ESTIMATED 10,000-MEMBER GUERRILLA 
FORCE BELIEVED TO EXIST AND TO BE GROWING IN COLOMBIA TODAY 
(COMBINED FARC AND ELN) CLEARLY IS IN A STRONG POSITION TO 
DISRUPT AND DESTABILIZE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, EVEN 
IF IT IS NOT IN A POSITION TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.  THE 
GUERRILLAS\' INCREASED NUMBERS HAVE ENABLED THEM TO FORM FIGHTING 
UNITS OF 200 TO 400 MEN -- LARGE ENOUGH TO OUTNUMBER AND 
OVERWHELM MANY OF THE COLOMBIAN ARMY UNITS STATIONED IN 
CONFLICTIVE AREAS.  AS ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL BEDOYA POINTED OUT 
TO ACTING POL/ECON COUNSELOR SEPTEMBER 7, THE GUERRILLAS ENJOY 
CERTAIN ADVANTAGES IN THE COLOMBIAN COUNTRYSIDE WHICH ENABLE THEM 
TO EVADE THE COLOMBIAN ARMY, AS THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP 60 HOSTAGE 
SOLDIERS IN AN UNKNOWN LOCATION  AND PREVENTED FROM RESCUE BY 
GOVERNMENT FORCES ILLUSTRATES.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (C)  A FARC DESERTER HAS REPORTED THAT 30 OF THE 60 COLOMBIAN 
SOLDIERS CAPTURED BY THE FARC ARE DEAD.  ALTHOUGH THE REPORT 
COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED, THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE INDICATED THE GOC 
WILL USE THIS INFORMATION IN AN EFFORT TO CAPITALIZE ON ADVERSE 
PUBLICITY ON THE FARC.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
FARC DESERTER REPORTS 30 CAPTURED SOLIDERS DEAD 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3.  (C)  DURING A BRIEF MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR NOVEMBER 7, 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE ESGUERRA PRESENTED A COPY OF A FAX SENT TO 
THE DIRECTOR OF CM&, A COLOMBIAN TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAM, BY AN 
INDIVIDUAL CLAIMING TO HAVE RECENTLY DESERTED FROM THE FARC. 
ACCORDING TO THIS INDIVIDUAL, SOME 30 OF THE 60 COLOMBIAN ARMY 
SOLDIERS CAPTURED AT LAS DELICIAS AUGUST 30 ARE DEAD -- SOME DIED 
OF WOUNDS, OTHERS WERE EXECUTED WHEN THEY TRIED TO ESCAPE, AND 
STILL OTHERS DIED OF MALARIA.  THE FARC DESERTER CONTINUES TO SAY 
THE FARC LEADERSHIP IS AT A LOSS TO JUSTIFY THE DEATHS OF THOSE 
SOLDIERS AND THEREFORE IS DELAYING THE RELEASE OF THE OTHERS 
CAPTURED IN EXPECTATION OF AN EVENTUAL ARMED CONFRONTATION WITH 
THE COLOMBIAN ARMY.  THE FARC WOULD THEN CLAIM THE 30 DEAD 
SOLDIERS WERE CASUALTIES OF THAT CONFRONTATION AND BLAME THE 
GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR DEATHS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4.  (C)  ESGUERRA WAS CLEARLY EAGER TO PASS ON THIS INFORMATION, 
ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT YET CONFIRMED THE LETTER\'S AUTHENTICITY.  NOR 
HAD HE ASKED HIMSELF SOME OBVIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS CONTENT -- 
FOR EXAMPLE, HOW THE FARC EXPECTED TO PASS OFF AS RECENT COMBAT 
CASUALTIES THE CADAVERS OF SOLDIERS LONG DEAD.  IF TRUE, HOWEVER, 
THE CAPTIVE SOLDIERS\' DEATHS WILL HAVE SEVERE REPERCUSSIONS. THE 
MOD UNDERSTANDABLY WANTS TO CAPITALIZE ON ADVERSE PUBLICITY ABOUT 
THE FARC AND ITS CYNICAL TACTICS TO DELAY HANDING OVER THE 
SOLDIERS IT MADE A GREAT SHOW OF PROMISING TO RELEASE WITHIN A 
WEEK OF THE LAS DELICIAS ATTACK.

REFS: A) BOGOTA 3560  B) BOGOTA 3610 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR CURTIS W. KAMMAN, REASON 1.5(B). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) AMIDST GREAT FANFARE AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
ONLOOKERS, THE FARC ANNOUNCED APRIL 29 ITS \"CLANDESTINE 
POLITICAL PARTY,\" THE \"BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT.\"  FARC CHIEF 
MARULANDA SAID THE CLANDESTINE CHARACTER OF THE PARTY WAS 
INTENDED TO PROTECT ITS MEMBERS FROM A SYSTEMATIC MURDER 
CAMPAIGN SUCH AS THAT WHICH BEFELL THE U.P. IN THE 
1980\'S.  ALL WHO SHARE THE FARC\'S THINKING, WHETHER OR 
NOT THEY APPROVE OF ITS ARMED STRUGGLE, ARE WELCOME TO 
JOIN, SAID PARTY DIRECTOR AND FARC SECRETARIAT MEMBER 
ALFONSO CANO.  THE PARTY\'S PLATFORM IS RURAL 
POPULIST/COMMUNIST.  THE INAUGURATION OF THE PARTY MAY BE 
INTENDED TO GATHER POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE UNPOPULAR 
GUERRILLA MOVEMENT; COULD BE PART OF AN EFFORT TO 
INSTITUTIONALIZE FARC CONTROL OF AREAS UNDER ITS 
INFLUENCE; OR MAY BE A DIVERSION TO UNDERMINE SUPPORT FOR 
THE MILITARY COMPONENT OF PLAN COLOMBIA.  AT ABOUT THE 
SAME TIME CANO INAUGURATED THE PARTY, FARC MILITARY 
COMMANDER BRICENO REPORTEDLY ORDERED HIS TROOPS TO STEP 
UP WAR ACTIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
MARULANDA ANNOUNCES COMMUNIST, CLANDESTINE PARTY 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
2.  (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, THE FARC TRUCKED IN 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM AROUND PUTUMAYO, 
CAQUETA, AND HUILA DEPARTMENTS TO WITNESS THE APRIL 29 
INAUGURATION OF ITS POLITICAL PARTY, THE BOLIVARIAN 
MOVEMENT (\"MOVIMIENTO BOLIVARIANO\"), AT SAN VICENTE DEL 
CAGUAN, IN ITS DESPEJE (DEMILITARIZED ZONE).  A PARADE OF 
FARC COMBATANTS, THE LAUNCHING OF 50,000 BALLOONS, A 
BARBECUE OF 400 HEAD OF CATTLE, AND A \"VALLENATO\" MUSIC 
CONCERT ROUNDED OUT THE DAY\'S ACTIVITIES.  BEFORE AN 
ENTHUSIASTIC, ASSAULT RIFLE-TOTING CROWD OF THOUSANDS, 
FARC LEADER MANUEL MARULANDA (\"TIROFIJO\") ANNOUNCED THAT 
THE PARTY WOULD, FOR THE TIME BEING, REMAIN CLANDESTINE. 
SPEAKING BEFORE A LARGE, PUBLIC CROWD, MARULANDA SAID THE 
ANONYMITY OF THE MOVEMENT\'S MEMBERS WAS NECESSARY TO 
AVOID THE FATE OF THE \"UNION PATRIOTICA.\"  (NOTE: 2,000 - 
3,000 MEMBERS OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION, A LEGAL, LEFTIST 
POLITICAL PARTY PRINCIPALLY CONSTITUTED BY THE FARC AND 
THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY, WERE MURDERED IN THE MID- 
AND LATE-1980\'S.  AS A SURVIVAL TACTIC, THE UP FORMALLY 
SEVERED ITS LINKS TO THE FARC IN THE LATE 1980\'S.  MUCH 
DEBILITATED, IT STILL EXISTS TODAY.  END NOTE.) 
 
 
CANO PRESENTS PARTY PLATFORM 
---------------------------- 
3.  (C) MARULANDA INTRODUCED FARC SECRETARIAT MEMBER 
ALFONSO CANO AS THE PARTY\'S DIRECTOR.  (NOTE: CANO IS THE 
FARC\'S PREMIER POLITICO, AND RECENTLY HAS HAD LITTLE 
INVOLVEMENT IN EITHER THE PEACE PROCESS OR THE FARC\'S 
MILITARY OFFENSIVES.  HE WAS THE FARC\'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR 
FOR THE UNSUCCESSFUL PEACE TALKS WITH THE GAVIRIA 
GOVERNMENT, 1990-1993.  END NOTE.)  CANO SAID THE PARTY 
ASPIRED TO NATIONAL POLITICAL POWER, AND THAT SOME OF ITS 
MEMBERS WOULD COMPETE CLANDESTINELY IN THE OCTOBER 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.  THE PARTY WOULD PROVIDE \"AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO COLOMBIA\'S CORRUPT, TRADITIONAL POLITICAL 
ELITES, AND WOULD BE OPEN TO ALL PERSONS WHO IDENTIFY 
WITH THE FARC\'S THINKING, IF NOT WITH ITS ARMED STRUGGLE 
. . .  AND WHO ARE NOT ENEMIES OF THE STATE (I.E., 
PARAMILITARIES, CORRUPT POLITICIANS).\" 
 
4.  (U) CANO OUTLINED A RURAL POPULIST/COMMUNIST 
PLATFORM, WHICH FOCUSSED ON EXTENDING BASIC SERVICES TO 
RURAL AREAS.  HE PROPOSED STRONG STATE INTERVENTION IN 
THE ECONOMY, AGRARIAN REFORM, AND AN AUTARKIC ECONOMY 
WHICH WOULD REMAIN CLOSED TO \"THE EMPIRE\" (I.E., THE 
UNITED STATES).  CANO CALLED FOR SPECIAL RECOGNITION AND 
TREATMENT OF BLACK AND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES.  HE 
CHARACTERIZED THE PARTY AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE 
FARC\'S PREFERENCE FOR POLITICAL, RATHER THAN ARMED, 
STRUGGLE.  HOWEVER, SHOULD THE USG AND THE GOC CONTINUE 
CURRENT POLICIES, CANO SAID THE FARC WOULD BE LEFT NO 
CHOICE BUT TO GIVE PRIORITY TO ARMED STRUGGLE. 
 
 
NOT A NEW INITIATIVE 
-------------------- 
5.  (U) CANO SAID THE FARC FOUNDED THE BOLIVARIAN 
MOVEMENT IN 1996, WHEN IT BEGAN FORMING CELLS IN HIGH 
SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES, FACTORIES AND ELSEWHERE.  THE 
ELECTION OF THE PARTY\'S GOVERNING BOARD, THE \"BOLIVARIAN 
PATRIOTIC COUNCIL, COMPOSED OF 100 WELL-KNOWN 
COLOMBIANS,\" WOULD SOON FOLLOW.  (NOTE: THE FARC HAS 
PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THE EXISTENCE OF THE BOLIVARIAN 
MOVEMENT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, BUT NEVER WITH SO MUCH 
FANFARE.  THE MOVEMENT HAS ALTERNATIVELY BEEN DESCRIBED 
AS AN \"INTELLECTUAL CADRE\" FOR THE FARC.  ITS FORMATION 
WAS FIRST CALLED FOR AT THE FARC\'S EIGHTH PLENARY 
CONGRESS IN 1993.  COLOMBIAN LAW PROSCRIBES MEMBERSHIP IN 
THE FARC AND SEVERAL OTHER ORGANIZATIONS; THE LEGALITY OF 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT IS SO FAR UNCLEAR. 
END NOTE.) 
 
 
(C) DID THE NINTH PLENARY OCCUR? 
-------------------------------- 
6.  (C) THE LAUNCHING OF THE BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT MAY NOT 
HAVE BEEN THE ONLY BIG FARC GATHERING IN THE DESPEJE IN 
RECENT WEEKS: THE FARC\'S NINTH PLENARY MEETING WAS 
SCHEDULED FOR MARCH OR APRIL 2000.  AT THESE RARE, MAJOR 
GATHERINGS OF FARC FRONT COMMANDERS, PLANS AND POLICIES 
FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS ARE SET.  HOWEVER, EMBASSY HAS 
BEEN UNABLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER THE NINTH PLENARY 
MEETING IN FACT OCCURRED. 
 
 
WHILE CANO TALKS POLITICS, JOJOY TALKS WAR 
------------------------------------------ 
7.  (U) BOGOTA PRESS PUBLISHED APRIL 29 A RADIO ADDRESS 
BY FARC MILITARY LEADER JORGE BRICENO (AKA, \"MONO JOJOY\") 
TO HIS TROOPS.  THE ADDRESS WAS REPORTEDLY INTERCEPTED BY 
ARMY INTELLIGENCE.  BRICENO SAID, \"THIS IS OUR BASIC 
TENET: WE MUST ATTACK, KIDNAP, FLAY; THAT IS, STRIP THE 
ENEMIES OF THE REVOLUTION OF THEIR MONEY.\"  HE CALLED FOR 
USING THE RESPITE PROVIDED BY THE PEACE TALKS TO DOUBLE 
THE NUMBER OF FARC COMBATANTS, \"FROM 16,000 TO 32,000.\" 
HE CALLED ON FARC MEMBERS TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT: \"SOME OF 
OUR PEOPLE WILL DO SO IN KEEPING WITH THE CONSTITUTION BY 
ACTING IN AN OPEN FASHION AND OTHERS WILL WORK ON THE 
FRINGES OF THE LAW BY USING WEAPONS.\"  REGARDING THE 
BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT, BRICENO REPORTEDLY SAID IT WOULD BE 
WELCOMED \"SO LONG AS THEY CONSTRUCT A PARTY FOR WAR.\" 
REGARDING THE OCTOBER ELECTIONS, BRICENO SAID, \"BALLOT 
BOXES MUST BE BURNED AND EVERYTHING DESTROYED . . .  AND 
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT POLITICIANS COME, WHETHER LIBERAL OR 
CONSERVATIVE, WE WILL TAKE THEM PRISONER.\"  WHEN 
CONFRONTED BY A JOURNALIST WITH BRICENO\'S UNTIMELY 
REMARKS, CANO SAID HE WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THEM, AND 
ATTRIBUTED THEM TO ARMY DISINFORMATION. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8.  (C) BY FORMALLY LAUNCHING THE BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT, 
THE FARC IS MAKING ITS FIRST FORAY INTO PARTY POLITICS IN 
15 YEARS.  THE CLANDESTINE CHARACTER OF THE PARTY IS, AS 
MARULANDA SAID, A REACTION TO THE 1980\'S MURDERS OF UP 
MEMBERS.  SO WHY THIS, AND WHY NOW?  DOUBTLESS, THE FARC 
IS TRYING TO STEAL BACK THE SPOTLIGHT FROM THE ELN, WHICH 
HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF MUCH ATTENTION LATELY (REF A). 
GIVEN THE CONGRESSIONAL CRISIS AND WIDESPREAD 
DISENCHANTMENT WITH TRADITIONAL PARTIES, THE TIME SEEMS 
RIPE TO LAUNCH (OR RE-LAUNCH) A POLITICAL PARTY -- FORMER 
BOGOTA MAYOR ANTANAS MOCKUS JUST DID IT, AND SO DID THE 
LABOR UNIONS.  THE FARC KNOWS LACK OF REAL POLITICAL 
SUPPORT IS ITS ACHILLES\' HEEL, AND IS TRYING TO RECRUIT 
SOME.  ALSO, SEVERAL DEVELOPMENTS -- THE FARC\'S RECENT 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW \"TAXES\" NATIONWIDE AND A SEPARATE, 
REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR THE DESPEJE, AS WELL AS 
THE INAUGURATION OF THE BOLIVARIAN MOVEMENT -- LEAD US TO 
BELIEVE THE FARC IS TRYING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE CONTROL 
OVER THE MUNICIPALITIES UNDER ITS SWAY.  FINALLY, THE 
FARC FEARS USG MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE GOC.  BY 
ENGAGING IN CEASE-FIRE TALKS (BEGUN APRIL 27, REF B) AND 
SUPPOSEDLY PURSUING POWER VIA ITS NEW POLITICAL PARTY, 
THE FARC MAY BE TRYING TO UNDERMINE POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR 
THE MILITARY COMPONENT OF PLAN COLOMBIA.

BLEAK PICTURE 
 
1.  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR CURTIS W. KAMMAN.  REASON 
1.5(B). 
 
2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  COORDINATOR FOR COUNTERTERRORISM MIKE 
SHEEHAN AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (SOLIC) BRIAN 
SHERIDAN MET WITH COLOMBIAN MINISTER OF DEFENSE LUIS 
RAMIREZ, THE COMMANDER OF MILITARY FORCES FERNANDO TAPIAS, 
AND THE CHIEFS OF THE VARIOUS ARMED SERVICE BRANCHES. 
SHEEHAN AND SHERIDAN ASKED THE MILITARY LEADERS HOW THE USG 
COULD BEST SEND THE MESSAGE THAT THE USG WILL NOT TOLERATE 
FARC AND OTHER VIOLENCE WITHOUT SHOWING THAT THE USG IS 
FEARFUL OF FARC RETALIATION.  THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY 
LEADERS USED THE FORUM TO DESCRIBE THE MULTITUDE OF 
PROBLEMS THEY FACE IN TRYING TO ELIMINATE COLOMBIAN 
TERRORIST GROUPS, OFTEN VENTING THEIR FRUSTRATION.  THOSE 
AT THE TABLE CITED DISTURBING NEW TRENDS IN THE KIDNAPPING 
INDUSTRY AS THE FINANCIAL ENGINE OF THE TERRORIST GROUPS 
AND TROUBLING EVIDENCE THAT EVEN THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS 
WHOSE STATED MISSION IS TO FIGHT LEFTIST TERRORISTS ARE 
RESORTING TO THE SAME TERROR TACTICS USED BY THEIR ENEMIES. 
TAPIAS NOTED THAT THE PARAMILITARIES\' STRENGTH EXCEEDED 
THAT OF THE ELN, AND WOULD EVENTUALLY ECLIPSE THE FARC AS 
WELL.  SHEEHAN NOTED THAT THE USG WAS INVESTIGATING WHETHER 
PARAMILITARIES COULD BE DESIGNATED AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
LEGISLATION NOT STRONG ENOUGH; \"JAILS ARE A JOKE\" 
 
3.  (C)  SHEEHAN AND SHERIDAN LISTENED TO A LITANY OF 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE COLOMBIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING 
MINISTER RAMIREZ\'S ARGUMENT FOR TOUGHER LEGISLATION AND 
PENAL CODES THAT WOULD ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE A 
STRONGER STAND AGAINST TERRORISTS AND GUERRILLAS. 
SENTENCES ARE LIGHT AND TOO OFTEN COMMUTED.  TAPIAS 
CONFIRMED THIS POINT, STRESSING THAT THE JAIL SYSTEM WAS \"A 
JOKE\" WHICH DID NOT DETER CRIMINALS.  HE NOTED THAT THE 
INDIVIDUAL DETAINED AS A SUSPECT ON THE CALI CHURCH 
KIDNAPPING HAS ALREADY FLED PRISON. 
 
 
CRIME-TERRORISM LINK 
 
4.  (C)  RAMIREZ AND TAPIAS ALSO NOTED THE INCREASINGLY 
POWERFUL ARMS AVAILABLE TO THE TERRORISTS ON THE BLACK 
MARKET, WHILE OTHERS NOTED THE OUTSOURCING OF CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITY BY THE FARC AND THE ELN.  THEY ALSO NOTED THAT THE 
FARC IS BEGINNING TO ENCROACH ON URBAN AREAS.  SHEEHAN 
STRESSED THAT THE COLOMBIANS HAD TO TAKE A VERY STRONG 
STAND AND MAKE CLEAR THAT THEY WILL DEAL WITH TERRORISM AND 
VIOLENCE AS A CRIME, NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE.  ALL INVOLVED 
WITH TERRORISM - REGARDLESS OF WHETHER INVOLVED IN 
FUNDRAISING, HARBORING TERRORISTS, OR CARRYING OUT 
TERRORIST ACTS - HAD TO BE PUNISHED. GEN JORGE MORA, 
COMMANDER OF THE COLOMBIAN ARMY, NOTED THAT THEY FELT 
CAUGHT BETWEEN THEIR DESIRE TO WORK FOR TOUGHER LAWS AND 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EUROPEAN AND OTHER PRESSURE NOT TO DO 
ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE THE GOC APPEAR TO BE VIOLATING 
INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED HUMAN RIGHTS.  HE ALSO STRESSED 
THAT THE TERRORIST AND REBEL GROUPS MUST RECEIVE THE 
MESSAGE FROM THE UNITED STATES THAT THEIR ACTIONS WILL BE 
SEEN AS TERRORISM. 
 
5.  (C)  SHEEHAN CONFIRMED THE UNITED STATES\' CONCERN ABOUT 
TERRORISM IN COLOMBIA, NOTING THAT HE WOULD URGE OTHER 
PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS THEIR 
OPPOSITION TO TERRORIST GROUPS.  ALTHOUGH \"PLAN COLOMBIA\" 
WAS NOT THE MAIN TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, IT AND THE USG\'S 
PENDING FINANCIAL RESPONSE WAS IMPLICIT IN THE EXCHANGE. 
THE COLOMBIANS OPENLY STATED THE NEED FOR INCREASED 
RESOURCES AND TRAINING. 
 
6.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE GOC OFFICIALS AT THE MEETING SEEMED 
TO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY NOT TO BLAME PRESIDENT PASTRANA OR 
EVEN TO MENTION HIS NAME. THIS OMISSION IS AT ODDS WITH 
LOCAL MEDIA AND EVEN STREET GRAFFITI IN WHICH PASTRANA\'S 
\"PEACE AT ANY COST\" STANCE IS EQUATED WITH WEAKNESS AND AN 
UNWILLINGNESS TO CONFRONT THE THREAT REPRESENTED BY THE 
FARC, THE ELN, THE PARAMILITARIES, AND OTHER TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS.  DESPITE STATING THEIR LACK OF RESOURCES, 
THE MILITARY LEADERS GAVE NO INDICATION THAT THEY WERE 
LOBBYING FOR AN INCREASE IN MILITARY SPENDING, CURRENTLY 
ABOUT THREE AND A HALF PERCENT OF GDP.  END COMMENT.

S/CT FOR REAP 
 
E.O. 12958: DECL:N/A 
TAGS: PTER, CO 
SUBJECT: 2000 TERRORISM REPORT (COLOMBIA) 
 
REF: STATE 21748 
 
1.  THE FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY BOGOTA\'S SUBMISSION FOR THE 
2000 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT, KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS 
POSED IN REFTEL: 
 
A.  RESPONSE OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO TERRORISM: COLOMBIA\'S 
PROSECUTOR GENERAL (A BRANCH OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT 
INDEPENDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE) CONTINUES TO GIVE HIGH 
PRIORITY TO THE PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS.  IN 2000, THE 
PROSECUTOR GENERAL SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTED A LARGE 
NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS -- BOTH 
NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN) AND REVOLUTIONARY ARMED 
FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC), AND MEMBERS OF PARAMILITARY 
ORGANIZATIONS -- ON DOMESTIC TERRORISM CHARGES.  THE 
PROSECUTOR GENERAL\'S OFFICE HAS COOPERATED CLOSELY WITH 
U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE PROSECUTION OF 
MEMBERS OF ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS ACCUSED OF KIDNAPPING 
AMCITS. 
 
B.  TERRORIST EXTRADITIONS BY HOST GOVERNMENT: THE 
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENT REQUESTS, INCLUDING USG REQUESTS, TO 
EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN 2000. 
 
C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION: 
COLOMBIA\'S INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT, THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS 
OF ITS NARCOTICS TRADE, AND THE PERVASIVE EFFECT OF 
CORRUPTION ON ITS POLITICAL AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS 
CONTINUE TO WORK AGAINST THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE 
PROSECUTION AND CONVICTION OF DOMESTIC CRIMINALS, 
INCLUDING TERRORISTS.  THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTION OF 
1991 AUTHORIZES THE EXTRADITION OF COLOMBIAN NATIONALS 
SOUGHT FOR CRIMES COMMITTED AFTER DECEMBER 1997, IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE.  THE 
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT APPLIED THIS LAW FORCEFULLY IN 2000 
TO COMPLY WITH SEVERAL U.S. EXTRADITION REQUESTS OF 
COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS, INCLUDING NARCO-TRAFFICKERS. 
 
D.  RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: THE COLOMBIAN 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. AND 
INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM.  THE 
PRESIDENCY AND THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAVE CONSISTENTLY 
RELEASED PUBLIC STATEMENTS CONDEMNING ACTS OF 
INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  THE EXECUTIVE AND 
JUDICIAL BRANCHES HAVE MADE SERIOUS EFFORTS TO 
INVESTIGATE DOMESTIC TERRORIST INCIDENTS AND TO 
COOPERATE WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. 
COLOMBIA BELONGS TO INTERPOL AND SHARES CRIMINAL 
INFORMATION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.  THE U.S. MAINTAINS AN 
ACTIVE LEGAL ATTACHE OFFICE IN BOGOTA, WORKING CLOSELY 
WITH COLOMBIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ARREST AND PROSECUTE 
COLOMBIAN TERRORISTS RESPONSIBLE FOR KIDNAPPING OF 
AMERICAN CITIZENS, AND OTHER CRIMES.  THE U.S. BUREAU OF 
ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND FIREARMS (ATF) ALSO MAINTAINS AN 
OFFICE IN BOGOTA.  ATF IS THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR ALL 
GOC ENTITIES CHARGED WITH INVESTIGATING TERRORIST 
BOMBINGS.  THE ATF HAS A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH 
ITS COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT COUNTERPART AGENCIES. 
 
E.  MAJOR 2000 COUNTER-TERRORISM STEPS: THE COLOMBIAN 
ARMY AND POLICE TOOK SIGNIFICANT STEPS IN 2000 TO COMBAT 
KIDNAPPINGS AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTS BY THE NATION\'S 
MAIN INSURGENT/TERRORIST GROUPS, THE ELN AND FARC, AND 
PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATIONS.  THE ARMY TRAINED, EQUIPPED 
AND FIELDED ITS SECOND COUNTER-NARCOTICS BATTALION, 
DESIGNED TO SUPPORT NATIONAL POLICE EFFORTS TO THWART 
FARC AND ELN LINKS TO NARCOTICS PRODUCTION AND 
TRAFFICKING.  THE ARMY AND POLICE ANTI-KIDNAPPING UNITS 
UNDERTOOK SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS TO BREAK-UP FARC 
AND ELN KIDNAPPING RINGS AND GAIN THE RELEASE OF SEVERAL 
KIDNAPPING VICTIMS.  A SUCCESSFUL ARMY MILITARY 
OPERATION AGAINST THE ELN LED TO THE RELEASE OF SOME 31 
COLOMBIAN NATIONALS KIDNAPPED ON SEPTEMBER 18 IN THE 
CITY OF CALI.  TWO AMERICANS KIDNAPPED IN THAT INCIDENT 
WERE RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 21.  A SUCCESSFUL ARMY 
MILITARY OPERATION IN THE SUMAPAZ REGION SOUTH OF BOGOTA 
LED TO THE RELEASE OF SEVERAL LONG-HELD KIDNAP VICTIMS 
AND THE BREAK-UP OF A FARC KIDNAPPING RING OPERATING IN 
BOGOTA.  IN OCTOBER, THE POLICE ARRESTED THE HEAD OF AN 
ELN KIDNAPPING/EXTORTION RING OPERATING IN THE CITY OF 
CALI.  COLOMBIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTINUED TO COOPERATE 
WITH U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT IN GAINING THE RELEASE OF 
SEVERAL KIDNAPPED AMCITS.  IN OCTOBER, THE COLOMBIAN 
POLICE RESCUED A MINOR AMCIT HELD FOR SIX MONTHS BY 
INDIVIDUALS CONNECTED WITH THE FARC. 
 
F.  SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: THE 
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO OPPOSE INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. 
 
G.  STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRIES ON TERRORISM ISSUES: NONE. 
 
H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGE ON ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: THE 
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS TERRORISM 
REMAINS CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY NEGATIVE. 
 
I.  U.S. EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH HOST GOVERNMENT: 
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO COOPERATE FULLY 
WITH USG INVESTIGATIONS INTO ANTI-U.S. ACTS OF 
TERRORISM.  ALL 16 AMCITS KIDNAPPED IN COLOMBIA IN 1999 
HAVE BEEN RELEASED.  ONE AMCIT WAS KIDNAPPED IN SANTA 
MARTA IN OCTOBER, BUT IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS 
KIDNAPPED BY COMMON CRIMINALS AND NOT A TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION.  USG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CONTINUE TO 
PROVIDE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING ANTI-TERRORISM 
TRAINING, TO COLOMBIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
 
J.  COOPERATION IN LAST FIVE YEARS: 
 
(1) BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AGENCIES OF THE 
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE IN 
SEEKING TO APPREHEND, CONVICT AND PUNISH 
INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS AND INTERESTS. 
 
(2) BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AGENCIES OF THE 
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ARE COOPERATING IN SEEKING TO 
PREVENT FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST AMCITS IN 
COLOMBIAN TERRITORY. 
 
K.  COOPERATION TO PREVENT ANTI-U.S. ACTS OF TERRORISM: 
BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AGENCIES OF THE COLOMBIAN 
GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY COOPERATIVE IN THE LAST 
FIVE YEARS IN SEEKING TO PREVENT FURTHER ACTS OF 
TERRORISM AGAINST AMCITS IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY.

TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, CO 
SUBJECT: LATEST MASSACRE PART OF ON-GOING PARA OFFENSIVE 
AGAINST FARC ON CARIBBEAN COAST 
 
1. CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON. REASONS: 
1.5(C,D). 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY: ON JANUARY 17, SOME 26 RESIDENTS OF A 
COMMUNITY NEAR THE TOWN OF OVEJAS IN NORTHERN SUCRE 
DEPARTMENT WERE MASSACRED, APPARENTLY BY PARAMILITARIES 
BELONGING TO THE NORTHERN BLOCK OF SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS 
OPERATING ON THE ATLANTIC COAST OF COLOMBIA.  A THIRD OF 
THE COMMUNITY HOUSES WERE BURNED DOWN AND MOST OF ITS 
RESIDENTS FLED TO OVEJAS.  ONE EMBASSY INTERLOCUTOR SAID 
\"THE COMMUNITY IS NOW VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT.\"  ACCORDING 
TO A COLOMBIAN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE CONTACT, THE PARA ATTACK 
IS PART OF AN ON-GOING CAMPAIGN TO DISLODGE THE FARC 37TH 
FRONT FROM THE STRATEGIC MONTES DE MARIA MOUNTAIN RANGE 
AND TO PUSH THE FARC OUT OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC COAST.  THE 
PARA ATTACKS/MASSACRES AGAINST CIVILIAN POPULATIONS ARE 
LIKELY TO CONTINUE, ESPECIALLY IN SUCRE.  THE COLOMBIAN 
NAVY\'S MARINE CORPS HAS LAUNCHED A MAJOR OPERATION TO 
SURROUND THE AREA OF THE MASSACRE AND TRY TO CAPTURE THE 
CULPRITS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (U) ON JANUARY 17, SOME 26 RESIDENTS OF A SMALL 
COMMUNITY KNOWN AS CHENGUE NEAR THE TOWN OF OVEJAS IN 
NORTHERN SUCRE DEPARTMENT WERE MASSACRED, APPARENTLY BY 
THE CENTAURO (NORTHERN) BLOCK OF SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS 
OPERATING IN AND AROUND THE ATLANTIC COAST OF COLOMBIA. 
THE CENTAURO BLOCK IS REPORTEDLY LED BY RODRIGO ANTONIO 
MERCADO, ALIAS \"CADENA,\" A CLOSE AFFILIATE OF UNITED SELF- 
DEFENSE FORCES OF COLOMBIA (AUC) LEADER CARLOS CASTANO. 
ON JANUARY 19, CASTANO CONDEMNED THE MASSACRE AND DENIED 
HIS INVOLVEMENT, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HIS NORTHERN FRONT 
HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE AND THAT THEY HAD \"GONE OVERBOARD.\" 
THE MASSACRE FOLLOWS A STRING OF PARAMILITARY MASSACRES 
ON/ALONG ATLANTIC COASTAL AREAS DATING BACK TO THE 
FEBRUARY 16, 1999 MASSACRE OF 28 RESIDENTS OF EL SALADO IN 
NORTHERN BOLIVAR DEPARTMENT. 
 
4. (C) POLICE AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCE PUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED 
THE EVER-INCREASING NUMBER OF MASSACRES ALONG THE ATLANTIC 
COAST TO AN ATTEMPT BY THE SELF-DEFENSE FORCES TO: (A) 
\"CLEANSE\" THE NORTHERN AREAS OF SUCRE, BOLIVAR, ATLANTICO, 
MAGDALENA, AND CESAR DEPARTMENTS OF THE FARC, MUCH AS THEY 
HAVE ALREADY DONE IN CORDOBA DEPARTMENT, (B) CONTROL THE 
NORTH COAST, INCLUDING THE MORROSQUILLO GULF IN SUCRE AND 
OTHER KEY SMALL PORTS, TO EXERCISE A MONOPOLY OVER ENTRY 
OF ARMS AND PRECURSORS AND EXIT OF COCAINE, AND, (C) 
SPECIFICALLY IN AND AROUND SUCRE AND BOLIVAR DEPARTMENTS, 
DISLODGE THE FARC\'S 35TH AND 37TH FRONTS FROM THE RICH 
CATTLE AND AGRICULTURAL REGION SURROUNDING THE MONTES DE 
MARIA. 
 
5. (C) DURING A JANUARY 18 BRIEFING, A HIGH RANKING 
COLOMBIAN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE CONTACT TOLD POLOFF THAT 
CHENGUE WAS A MILITARY TARGET FOR THE PARAS BECAUSE IT 
SERVED AS AN ENTRY POINT INTO THE MONTES DE MARIA, WHERE 
THE FARC 37TH FRONT OPERATES, AND THAT THE CHENGUE 
COMMUNITY SERVED AS A RESUPPLY AND R AND R POINT FOR THE 
GUERRILLAS.  THE CHENGUE MASSACRE FITS A PATTERN OF PARA 
ATTACKS ON SMALL COMMUNITIES ON THE NORTH COAST WHICH, IN 
THE PARAS\' VIEW, SERVE AS CIVILIAN BASES OF SUPPORT FOR 
THE FARC 35 AND 37 FRONTS.  THE CONTACT DREW PARALLELS 
BETWEEN CHENGUE AND EL SALADO, AFFIRMING THAT EL SALADO 
WAS ALSO A FARC STRONGHOLD, AND THAT IT WAS LOCATED ON THE 
FOOTHILLS OF THE MONTES DE MARIA.  HE CONFIDED THAT NAVAL 
INTELLIGENCE HAD INDICATIONS THAT THE PARAS WOULD ATTACK 
ANOTHER NEARBY COMMUNITY, AND WERE CAUGHT OFF-GUARD WHEN 
THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT CHENGUE.  HE WAS VERY SURPRISED 
THAT THE PARAS WERE ABLE TO ENTER CHENGUE UNDETECTED 
SINCE, IN HIS VIEW, THE FARC 37TH FRONT COMPLETELY 
CONTROLS THE AREA AROUND CHENGUE. 
 
6.  (C) THE CONTACT FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THESE TYPES OF 
INCIDENTS WILL CONTINUE AS THE PARAS AND FARC FIGHT OVER 
CONTROL OF THE ATLANTIC COAST, AND ESPECIALLY FOR CONTROL 
OF THE MONTES DE MARIA.  HE ADDED THAT THE PARA NORTH 
BLOCK IS BEING HEAVILY FINANCED BY CATTLE RANCHERS FROM 
SUCRE, CORDOBA, AND OTHER ATLANTIC DEPARTMENTS, WHO HAVE 
BEEN HURT BY FARC KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTIONS, AND CATTLE 
RUSTLING.  THESE RANCHERS ARE HOPING THE PARAS WILL DRIVE 
THE FARC OUT OF THEIR AREAS SO THAT THEY TOO CAN HAVE THE 
\"RELATIVE PEACE\" THEIR FELLOW RANCHERS ENJOY IN LARGE 
PARTS OF CORDOBA. 
 
7. (U) COLOMBIAN NATIONAL JUDICIAL POLICE (DIJIN) FIGURES 
ON MASSACRES DURING 2000, RELEASED ON JANUARY 18, 
CORROBORATE THE FACT THAT THE ATLANTIC COAST IS SEEING THE 
LARGEST INCREASE IN PARA KILLINGS IN THE COUNTRY. 
ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES, AT LEAST HALF OF ALL THE 
EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS IN 2000 TOOK PLACE IN ATLANTIC 
COAST DEPARTMENTS.  OF ALL COLOMBIAN DEPARTMENTS, BOLIVAR 
HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PARA MURDERS, WITH 76.  SUCRE 
DEPARTMENT REGISTERED 46 PARA-ATTRIBUTED KILLINGS. 
ACCORDING TO FIGURES CITED IN A RECENT COLOMBIAN MILITARY 
BRIEFING TO VISITING DOD OFFICIALS, THERE HAVE BEEN 
SEVENTEEN MASSACRES THIS YEAR, NOT INCLUDING CHENGUE.  OF 
THESE, TWO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY THE FARC, ONE BY THE 
ELN, TEN BY PARA GROUPS, AND THE REST HAVE NOT YET BEEN 
ATTRIBUTED. 
 
8. (C) COMMENT: IF STATISTICAL TRENDS AND COLOMBIAN NAVAL 
INTELLIGENCE ARE CORRECT, PARA MASSACRES OF CIVILIAN 
POPULATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR IN THE ATLANTIC COAST, 
AND MAY EVEN INTENSIFY AS THE PARA NORTH BLOCK AND THE 
FARC\'S 35 AND 37 BLOCK FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF THE MONTES DE 
MARIA AND ACCESS TO ATLANTIC PORTS.  THE COLOMBIAN NAVY, 
WHICH HAS SECURITY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE AREAS, SEEMS 
TO HAVE REACTED FAIRLY QUICKLY TO THE MASSACRE, AND HAS 
DEPLOYED MORE THAN 1,000 MARINES AND SPECIAL FORCES IN 
PURSUIT OF THE CULPRITS.  HOWEVER, AS THE NAVY CONTACT 
ACKNOWLEDGED, THE PARAS ALSO HAVE A VERY STRONG BASE OF 
SUPPORT IN THE AREA AND CAN EASILY DISAPPEAR AMONG THE 
CIVILIAN POPULATION.

TAGS: PHUM, PTER, PGOV, PREL, PINS, MARR, CO 
SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT/FARC BEGIN HUMANITARIAN 
EXCHANGE/FARC MANIPULATES EVENT 
 
1. CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON. REASONS: 
1.5(C,D). 
 
2. (U) ON JUNE 16, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FARC 
BEGAN THE PLANNED EXCHANGE OF CAPTURED SOLDIERS AND 
POLICEMEN FOR IMPRISONED FARC GUERRILLAS WITH THE FARC 
RELEASE OF 29 POLICEMEN AND SOLDIERS AND THE GOC RELEASE 
OF 11 FARC GUERRILLAS.  ON JUNE 17, THE FARC RELEASED AN 
ADDITIONAL FOUR POLICEMEN IN A SEPARATE CEREMONY.  BY JUNE 
18, A TOTAL OF 47 SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN HAD BEEN 
RELEASED.  THE NEXT STEP IS FOR THE FARC TO UNILATERALLY 
RELEASE SOME 100 ADDITIONAL POLICEMEN/SOLDIERS IN THE VERY 
NEAR FUTURE.  MANY OF THE RELEASED POLICEMEN AND SOLDIERS 
HAD BEEN HELD BY THE FARC SINCE THEIR CAPTURE DURING THE 
DISASTROUS ARMY AND POLICE DEFEATS AT MIRAFLORES AND MITU 
(1998) AND PUERTO RICO (1999). 
 
3. (C) THE FARC RENEGED ON ITS WORD TO THE GOC THAT IT 
WOULD KEEP THE EVENT AT A LOW PROFILE BY BRINGING 
INTERNATIONAL PRESS TO THE RELEASE OF THE 
SOLDIERS/POLICEMEN AND CREATING A LARGE INTERNATIONAL 
MEDIA EVENT.  ARMED FORCES COMMANDER GEN. FERNANDO TAPIAS 
CALLED THE FARC MEDIA DISPLAY A \"SPECTACLE,\" AND ADDED 
THAT THE FARC RELEASE IN NO WAY MADE UP FOR THE INHUMANE, 
CONCENTRATION-CAMP TYPE CONDITIONS THE SOLDIERS/POLICEMEN 
WERE HELD IN FOR YEARS.  ALTHOUGH MOST RELEASED 
SOLDIERS/POLICEMEN RESERVED COMMENTS, ONE SOLDIER\'S 
COMMENT THAT THE FARC \"TREATED THEM LIKE ANIMALS\" WAS 
WIDELY DISSEMINATED BY THE LOCAL PRESS.  (NOTE: EMBASSY 
SOURCES SAY THAT THE MILITARY HIERARCHY HAD INSISTED TO 
THE GOC THAT THE EXCHANGES BE DONE VERY LOW KEY TO KEEP 
THE FARC FROM GAINING POLITICAL MILEAGE FROM THE EVENT. 
ALTHOUGH THE GOC HAD APPARENTLY REACHED AGREEMENT WITH THE 
FARC ON THIS ISSUE, THE FARC DID AN END-RUN ON THE GOC BY 
BRINGING THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS TO COVER THE EVENT.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
4. (C) SEPARATELY, OF THE 12 FARC GUERRILLAS WHO WERE DUE 
FOR RELEASE ALSO ON JUNE 16, ONLY 11 WERE RELEASED WHEN 
ONE OPTED TO COMPLETE HIS SENTENCE AND LEAVE THE FARC. 
DESPITE WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT THIS GROUP WOULD 
INCLUDE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT UPPER AND MID-LEVEL 
FARC COMMANDERS IN COLOMBIA\'S JAILS, NONE OF THE RELEASED 
BELONGED TO THE FARC POLITICAL OR MILITARY HIERARCHY, AND, 
IN FACT, MOST WERE NO MORE THAN FOOT SOLDIERS OR LOW-LEVEL 
URBAN MILITIAS.  HOWEVER, MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SOURCES 
TOLD POLOFF ON JUNE 18 THAT THREE OR FOUR ADDITIONAL FARC 
PRISONERS ARE DUE TO BE RELEASED SOON, AND THAT THIS GROUP 
MAY CONTAIN SOME HIGHER RANKING FARC MEMBERS. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: PREDICTABLY, THE FARC USED THE 
HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE TO STAGE A MEDIA SHOW, PROBABLY TO 
TRY TO REPAIR ITS BADLY-TARNISHED INTERNATIONAL IMAGE. 
FOR ITS PART, THE GOC DESERVES CREDIT FOR HAVING FOUGHT 
OFF FARC PRESSURE TO INCLUDE SOME OF THE FARC\'S IMPORTANT 
CADRES AND MORE NOTORIOUS PERPETRATORS OF ACTS OF EXTREME 
VIOLENCE AMONG THE RELEASED.  HOPEFULLY, GOC PEACE 
COMMISSIONER CAMILO GOMEZ WILL REJECT ANY ATTEMPT BY THE 
FARC TO INCLUDE SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAST 
GROUP TO BE RELEASED.  ALTHOUGH MOST COLOMBIANS REJOICED 
OVER THE RELEASE OF THE POLICEMEN/SOLDIERS, AND HOPED FOR 
MORE RELEASES, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THIS ACT, IN AND OF 
ITSELF, WILL RENEW GENERAL CONFIDENCE IN THE PEACE 
PROCESS.  THAT MAY ONLY COME IF THE FARC BEGINS SERIOUS 
NEGOTIATIONS ON DOWNGRADING THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE AND 
COMMITS TO ABIDING BY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW.

SUBJECT: FARC ANNOUNCE INTENTION TO RELEASE ADDITIONAL 250 
SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN/CONTINUE TO KIDNAP AND EXTORT 
 
REF: BOGOTA 5460 
 
1.(U) CLASSIFIED BY CDA BARBARA C. MOORE, REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
2. (C) ON JUNE 18, THE FARC RELEASED AN ADDITIONAL GROUP 
OF COLOMBIAN SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN, BRINGING THE TOTAL OF 
RELEASED IN THE FIRST HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE TO 55.  GOC 
PEACE COMMISSIONER CAMILO GOMEZ ADMITTED TO THE PRESS THAT 
THE FARC HAD NOT ALLOWED THE ICRC TO GIVE MEDICAL EXAMS TO 
THE CAPTURED SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN, THUS VIOLATING A KEY 
ASPECT OF THE HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE AGREEMENT.  INSTEAD, 
THE FARC REPORTEDLY CONDUCTED THE MEDICAL EXAMS 
THEMSELVES.  THE PRESS REPORTS THAT THREE OF THE MOST 
SERIOUSLY ILL POLICEMEN/SOLDIERS WERE NOT RELEASED (TWO 
REPORTEDLY SUFFER FROM SERIOUS FORMS OF CANCER), WHILE 
MANY OF THE RELEASED WERE IN GOOD HEALTH.  GOC PEACE 
NEGOTIATOR LUIS GUILLERMO GIRALDO (PROTECT) TOLD POLOFF ON 
JUNE 19 THAT HE AND OTHERS IN THE GOC SUSPECT THAT THE 
FARC IS KEEPING THE THREE SERIOUSLY ILL SOLDIERS/POLICEMEN 
TO INCREASE PUBLIC PRESSURE ON THE GOC TO NEGOTIATE A 
POLICEMEN/SOLDIERS FOR GUERRILLA SWAP, MUCH LIKE THEY HAD 
TRIED TO DO WITH THE CASE OF GRAVELY ILL POLICE COL. 
ACOSTA.  GIRALDO AFFIRMED THAT THE FARC STRATEGY IS TO 
CONVINCE THE GOC TO HAVE SIMULTANEOUS, PERMANENT SWAPS SO 
AS TO (IN THEIR VIEW) RAISE THEIR INTERNATIONAL COMBATANT 
STATUS. 
 
3. (C) ON JUNE 19 THE FARC CENTRAL COMMAND ANNOUNCED THAT 
THEY WILL UNILATERALLY LIBERATE AN ADDITIONAL 250 SOLDIERS 
AND POLICEMEN ON JUNE 28, AND INVITED THE COLOMBIAN POLICE 
AND ARMED FORCES TO BE PRESENT WHEN THE RELEASE TAKES 
PLACE \"AS A GESTURE OF SOLIDARITY.\"  GIRALDO TOLD POLOFF 
THAT THE FARC FEEL A SIMULTANEOUS, PERMANENT EXCHANGE 
AGREEMENT WITH THE GOC WOULD BENEFIT THEM AND UNDERMINE 
THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES IN THREE WAYS: ONE, SINCE 
THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES HIERARCHY HAS EXPRESSED 
OPPOSITION TO AN EXCHANGE AGREEMENT PUBLICLY, A GOC 
DECISION TO ACQUIESCE TO THE FARC ON THIS ISSUE WOULD 
CREATE FURTHER CIVIL-MILITARY TENSIONS; SECONDLY, SOLDIERS 
AND POLICEMEN WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO SURRENDER IN THE 
BATTLEFIELD RATHER THAN FIGHT IF THEY KNOW THEY WILL BE 
SWAPPED QUICKLY, AND, THIRD, THE FARC WOULD BE ABLE TO 
QUICKLY REPLENISH THEIR DEPLETED MID-LEVEL BATTLEFIELD 
CADRES.  GIRALDO ADDED THAT THE FARC HAS SHOWN NO INTEREST 
IN MOVING FROM THE HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE AGREEMENT TO A 
DISCUSSION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW OR 
NEGOTIATIONS TO DECREASE THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE, MUCH LESS 
A CEASE FIRE. 
 
4. (C) SEPARATELY, ON JUNE 12 LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE HORACIO SERPA AND LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENT LUIS 
GUILLERMO VELEZ TOLD POLOFFS THAT LIBERAL SENATOR LUIS 
ELADIO PEREZ BONILLA HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED THREE DAYS EARLIER 
IN NARINO DEPARTMENT, REPORTEDLY BY THE FARC.  SINCE THAT 
TIME, PEREZ\'S KIDNAPPING HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, WITH ALL 
INDICATIONS LEADING TO THE FARC.  IN ADDITION, VELEZ 
STATED ON JUNE 17 THAT HE HAS BEEN WARNED BY THE FARC THAT 
HE MUST EITHER PAY A \"WAR TAX\" (\"VACUNA\") OR BE A 
KIDNAPPING TARGET. 
 
5.(C)  COMMENT:  DESPITE THE HOPES RAISED BY THE HUMANITARIAN 
EXCHANGE AND POSSIBLE FOLLOW-UP UNILATERAL RELEASE OF 
SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN, THE FARC CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT 
THEY ARE NOT YET INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING WITH THE GOC THE 
KINDS OF ISSUES THAT WOULD GENUINELY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF 
VIOLENCE OR MOVE TOWARDS EVENTUAL RESOLUTION OF THE 
CONFLICT.  INSTEAD, THEIR RECENT ACTIONS -- DISREGARD FOR 
HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE GROUND RULES, KIDNAPPING OF SEN. 
PEREZ, AND THE AUDACIOUS THREAT AGAINST THE LIBERAL PARTY 
PRESIDENT -- DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF ARROGANCE MOST 
COLOMBIANS ARE ALL TOO USED TO.

SUBJECT: UPDATE ON OPERATION SEVENTH OF AUGUST 
 
REF: BOGOTA 7555 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON; REASONS 1.5 
(B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) AS REPORTED REFTEL, ON AUGUST 17 THE COLOMBIAN 
MILITARY LAUNCHED A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL JOINT ARMY/AIR 
FORCE OPERATION TO DESTROY MOBILE FARC UNITS SEEKING TO 
ATTACK MILITARY TARGETS IN META AND GUAVIARE DEPARTMENTS. 
ON AUGUST 27, FARC SUPREME MILITARY COMMANDER \"MONO 
JOJOY\" PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ALIAS \"URIAS CUELLAR,\" 
HIS RIGHT-HAND MILITARY STRATEGIST HAD BEEN KILLED BY THE 
ARMY.  ALTHOUGH \"JOJOY\" DOWNPLAYED THE NUMBER OF FARC 
CASUALTIES, THE ARMY HAS RECOVERED THE BODIES OF AT LEAST 
20 FARC COMBATANTS.  THERE ARE CREDIBLE REPORTS THAT THE 
BODIES OF AT LEAST ANOTHER 80 FARC COMBATANTS WERE BURIED 
OR HIDDEN BY FARC UNITS AS THEY FLED FROM ARMY PURSUIT. 
 
2. (C) ARMED FORCES COMMANDER GEN. TAPIAS HAS ANNOUNCED 
THAT OPERATION \"SEVENTH OF AUGUST\" WILL CONTINUE AS THE 
ARMY PURSUES AND ENCIRCLES REMNANTS OF THE FARC COLUMNS, 
NUMBERING SOME 1,300 FARC REGULARS.  ARMY COMMANDER 
GENERAL MORA ORDERED AN ADDITIONAL 500 TROOPS COMMITTED 
TO THE OPERATION; THESE TROOPS ARE NOW POSTED AT 
STRATEGIC LOCATIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT ELEMENTS OF THE 
FARC FORCE FROM ESCAPING BACK TO THE FARC DEMILITARIZED 
ZONE (\"ZONA DE DESPEJE\").  SOME FARC REGULARS ARE 
SPLITTING INTO SMALL GROUPS IN AN EFFORT TO EVADE 
DETECTION. 
 
3. (C) MILITARY SOURCES ADD THAT CURRENT EFFORTS ARE 
FOCUSING ON PSYOPS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THE FARC 
COMBATANTS TO SURRENDER.  THESE OPERATIONS CONSIST MAINLY 
OF DROPPING LEAFLETS ARGUING THAT IT IS BETTER TO 
SURRENDER TO THE MILITARY, WHO TAKES GOOD CARE OF ITS 
PRISONERS, THAN BE KILLED IN ACTION.  FARC MORALE IN THE 
AREA IS REPORTEDLY LOW, AND THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY IS 
ATTEMPTING TO PRESS ITS ADVANTAGE.  FARC COMBATANTS ARE 
SAID TO BE STARVING AS A RESULT OF THE MILITARY\'S SEIZURE 
EARLY IN THE OPERATION OF AT LEAST EIGHT TONS OF RATIONS 
DESTINED FOR THEM; AS MANY AS 30 GUERRILLAS HAVE ALREADY 
DESERTED, ACCORDING TO INTELLIGENCE SOURCES. 
 
-------- 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
 
4. (C) BY ALL ACCOUNTS, OPERATION \"SEVENTH OF AUGUST\" 
WILL LIKELY TURN OUT TO BE THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES 
MOST SUCCESSFUL OPERATION AGAINST THE FARC IN RECENT 
YEARS.  AS THE ARMY CONTINUES TO ENCIRCLE THE FLEEING 
FARC REGULARS AND THEIR FOOD SUPPLIES CONTINUE TO 
DWINDLE, THE ARMY\'S PSYOPS SHOULD PAY DIVIDENDS AS FARC 
SOLDIERS COME OUT OF THE BUSH TO SURRENDER. 
 
5. (C) THERE ARE REPORTS FROM SEVERAL FARC SOLDIERS WHO 
SURRENDERED EARLIER THAT THERE ARE MANY FARC WOMEN AND 
MINORS AMONG THOSE WISHING TO SURRENDER.  IF, IN FACT, A 
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF MINORS SURRENDER, THIS OPERATION 
COULD DEAL ANOTHER MAJOR BLOW TO THE FARC\'S INTERNATIONAL 
IMAGE.  AT THE SAME TIME, THIS OPERATION IS BEING 
CONDUCTED IN TERRAIN THAT MIGHT PERMIT THE GUERRILLAS TO 
SLIP THROUGH THE ARMY\'S BLOCKING POSITIONS AND THUS ALLOW 
THE FARC COMBATANTS TO RETURN TO THEIR SANCTUARY IN THE 
DESPEJE.

CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON; REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
-------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (C) THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY\'S (COLMIL) \"SEVENTH OF 
AUGUST\" OPERATION, LAUNCHED ON AUGUST 17 AGAINST A 
1,300 STRONG FARC FORCE IN THE EASTERN COLOMBIAN 
DEPARTMENTS OF GUAVIARE AND META IS WINDING DOWN.  THE 
JOINT ARMY/AIR FORCE OPERATION WAS EXTREMELY 
SUCCESSFUL, ESPECIALLY IN ITS EARLY STAGES, AS IT 
INFLICTED SUBSTANTIAL CASUALTIES ON SOME OF THE FARC\'S 
ELITE MOBILE COLUMNS, AND LED TO THE DEATH OF \"URIAS 
CUELLAR,\" THE FARC\'S SECOND MOST IMPORTANT FIELD 
COMMANDER AND HEIR APPARENT TO \"MONO JOJOY.\" 
 
2. (C) SINCE THE END OF AUGUST, THE COLMIL HAS BEEN 
ATTEMPTING TO ENCIRCLE THE FARC COMBATANTS AS THEY 
RETREAT BACK TO THE FARC \"DEMILITARIZED ZONE\" 
(\"DESPEJE\").  THIS EFFORT HAS HAD LIMITED RESULTS FOR 
THE COLMIL, WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF FARC COMBATANTS 
SURRENDERING.  HOWEVER, MOST OF THE RETREATING FARC 
COMBATANTS HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN ABLE TO ELUDE THE 
COLMIL\'S ENCIRCLEMENT BY BREAKING UP INTO SMALL GROUPS 
AND USING THE AREA\'S DENSE VEGETATION TO THEIR 
ADVANTAGE.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE LIMITED SUCCESS OF THE 
MOP-UP OPERATION, OPERATION \"SEVENTH OF AUGUST\" IS THE 
COLOMBIAN MILITARY\'S BIGGEST SUCCESS AGAINST THE FARC 
IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
------------------- 
OPERATIONAL RESULTS 
------------------- 
 
3. (C) AS REPORTED REFTELS, ON AUGUST 17, THE COLMIL 
LAUNCHED A MAJOR JOINT ARMY/AIR FORCE OPERATION AIMED 
AT DESTROYING MOBILE FARC UNITS WHICH HAD EARLIER LEFT 
THE FARC \"DEMILITARIZED ZONE\" TO ATTACK MILITARY 
TARGETS IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF META AND GUAVIARE.  THE 
FARC UNITS WERE UNDER DIRECT ORDERS TO RETAKE THE TOWN 
OF BARRANCOMINAS (GUAINIA DEPARTMENT), LOST TO THE 
COLMIL DURING OPERATION \"GATO NEGRO.\"  ESTIMATES ARE 
THAT THE FARC SUFFERED 150 KILLED IN COMBAT, THE 
LARGEST NUMBER OF FARC KILLED IN AN OPERATION IN RECENT 
HISTORY.  FURTHERMORE, INTELLIGENCE SOURCES INDICATE 
THAT APPROXIMATELY 30 FARC COMBATANTS SURRENDERED 
FOLLOWING THE COLMIL\'S INITIAL BATTLEFIELD SUCCESSES. 
 
4. (C) ACCORDING TO MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, 
FOLLOWING ITS EARLY BATTLEFIELD SETBACKS, THE FARC 
FORCE WAS ABLE TO SPLIT INTO GROUPS OF 50-300, WHICH 
HAVE LARGELY SUCCEEDED IN RETREATING INTO THE 
SURROUNDING JUNGLE AND WORKING THEIR WAY BACK TO THE 
\"DESPEJE.\"  THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE CONTINUE CONDUCTING 
RECONNAISSANCE AND PURSUIT OPERATIONS IN AN EFFORT TO 
LOCATE AND DESTROY SOME OF THESE SMALLER GROUPS. 
ACCORDING TO ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL JORGE MORA, HE HAS 
APPROXIMATELY 750 TROOPS IN BLOCKING POSITIONS TO 
INTERCEPT THE FARC COLUMNS SEEKING TO RETURN TO THE 
\"DESPEJE.\"  ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL ENGAGEMENTS LED TO 
HEAVY FARC LOSSES, THE MOP-UP OPERATION HAS SO FAR HAD 
ONLY LIMITED SUCCESS AND WILL NOT LIKELY YIELD THE 
LARGE NUMBER OF FARC DESERTIONS THAT THE MILITARY WAS 
ORIGINALLY PREDICTING. 
 
 
--------------------- 
FARC FIELD MORALE LOW 
--------------------- 
 
5. (C) THE COLMIL\'S SEIZURE OF AT LEAST EIGHT TONS OF 
RATIONS DESTINED FOR THE FARC COMBATANTS, THE FARC\'S 
INABILITY TO ACHIEVE ITS GOAL TO RETAKE BARRANCOMINAS 
AND REESTABLISH A MAJOR DRUGS/WEAPONS CENTER ON THE 
BRAZILIAN BORDER, AND THE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AIR TO 
GROUND ATTACKS CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE 
HAVE, ACCORDING TO CAPTURED FARC GUERRILLAS, KEPT FARC 
FIELD MORALE VERY LOW.  THE ARMY HAS REPOSITIONED ITS 
TROOPS INTO BLOCKING POSITIONS TO CUT OFF THE FARC\'S 
ROUTES OF RETREAT TO THE \"DESPEJE,\" AND CONTINUES TO 
HOPE TO CAPTURE OR KILL GUERRILLAS AS THEY FLEE THE 
COMBAT ZONE.  THIS MOP-UP PHASE IS EXPECTED TO END IN 
THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) THIS OFFENSIVE REFLECTS THE TACTICAL 
IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE COLMIL HAS MADE OVER THE PAST TWO 
YEARS. INTELLIGENCE WAS VITAL TO LOCATING THE FARC 
COLUMN, AND THE COLMIL WAS ABLE TO EXPLOIT THAT 
INTELLIGENCE BY MAKING USE OF ITS VASTLY IMPROVED 
TRANSPORT CAPABILITIES, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE C-130 
MAINTENANCE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED BY A 
SHORTAGE OF PARTS AND SKILLED MECHANICS.  TWO YEARS 
AGO, EVEN IF INTELLIGENCE HAD PROVIDED THE NECESSARY 
INFORMATION, THE COLMIL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
MOVE OVER 3,000 TROOPS IN 48 HOURS TO THE COMBAT ZONE, 
AND THE FARC WOULD HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY ESCAPED. 
 
7. (C) AT ONE TIME, THE COLMIL WAS HOPEFUL THAT A LARGE 
NUMBER OF TRAPPED FARC GUERRILLAS WOULD TURN THEMSELVES 
IN, AS HAD OCCURRED LATE LAST YEAR DURING OPERATION 
BERLIN.  IN THIS CASE, THE DIFFICULT TERRAIN ALLOWED 
MOST OF THE GUERRILLA UNITS TO EVADE CONTACT WITH THE 
MILITARY AND THUS RETURN SAFELY TO THE \"DESPEJE.\" 
ALTHOUGH LARGE SCALE DESERTIONS ARE UNLIKELY, OPERATION 
\"SEVENTH OF AUGUST\" IS, BY ANY MEASURE, ONE OF THE 
COLMIL\'S BIGGEST MILITARY SUCCESSES IN THE LAST FEW 
YEARS.  THIS OPERATION WILL LIKELY REINFORCE THE TREND 
OF THE FARC REVERTING TO HIT-AND-RUN TACTICS AND 
AVOIDING FRONTAL ENGAGEMENTS WITH NUMERICALLY SUPERIOR 
GROUND TROOPS BACKED BY SUPERIOR FIREPOWER.

SUBJECT: FARC KIDNAPS FORMER MINISTER OF CULTURE AND 10 OTHERS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON.  REASONS 1.5(B) 
AND (D). 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY: FORMER MINISTER OF CULTURE CONSUELO ARAUJO 
NOGUERA AND SOME 10 TO 25 OTHER HOSTAGES WERE KIDNAPPED BY 
THE FARC NEAR VALLEDUPAR, CESAR DEPARTMENT, ON THE 
AFTERNOON OF SEPTEMBER 24.  ARMY SOURCES CLAIM THE 
HOSTAGES\' CARS HAVE BEEN SPOTTED FROM THE AIR IN A 
MOUNTAINOUS REGION NORTH OF VALLEDUPAR, AND THAT ARMY 
TROOPS ARE ENGAGED IN AN AGGRESSIVE RESCUE OPERATION.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) FORMER MINISTER OF CULTURE CONSUELO ARAUJO NOGUERA 
WAS KIDNAPPED, ALONG WITH BETWEEN 10 AND 25 OTHER PEOPLE, 
ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER 24 IN YE DE LA VEGA, LOCATED 15 
MINUTES\' DRIVE NORTH OF VALLEDUPAR, THE CAPITAL OF CESAR 
DEPARTMENT. AS OF MID-MORNING SEPTEMBER 25, THE ARMY 
REPORTED THAT TWO BATTALIONS HAVE MOBILIZED IN AN 
AGGRESSIVE RESCUE OPERATION, AND AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS HAVE 
SPOTTED THE HOSTAGES\' CARS FROM THE AIR IN A MOUNTAINOUS 
AREA NEAR PATILLAL, A SMALL CITY LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30 
KILOMETERS NORTH OF VALLEDUPAR.  THE ARMY HAS ENGAGED THE 
FARC IN THIS AREA, AND ONE SOLDIER HAS BEEN KILLED, BUT 
ARMY SOURCES ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THEY CAN FREE THE HOSTAGES 
QUICKLY. 
 
3.  (U) ARAUJO IS THE WIFE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL (PROCURADOR 
GENERAL) EDGAR MAYA VILLAZON, AND SOURCES SPECULATE THAT 
ARAUJO HERSELF, A MEMBER OF AN IMPORTANT CESAR POLITICAL 
FAMILY, MAY HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY TARGET OF THIS 
KIDNAPPING.  MAYA, WHO IS NOT COMMENTING TO THE PRESS AT 
THIS TIME, REPORTEDLY HAS TRAVELED TO VALLEDUPAR AND IS 
PARTICIPATING IN A SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING TODAY WITH 
CESAR DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS. ARAUJO IS A MAJOR AND WELL- 
LIKED PUBLIC FIGURE. SHE IS THE FOUNDER OF A FESTIVAL WHICH 
PROMOTES COLOMBIAN MUSIC AND WHICH HAS BECOME A MAJOR 
ENTERTAINMENT EVENT AND SOURCE OF TOURIST REVENUE FOR HER 
NATIVE TOWN OF VALLEDUPAR. 
 
4.  (U) IT HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE 
BEING HELD.  ACCORDING TO THE OFFICE OF THE MAYOR OF 
VALLEDUPAR, 10 PEOPLE (INCLUDING 3 STAFF FROM THE MAYOR\'S 
OFFICE) ARE CONFIRMED KIDNAPPED, BUT THAT NUMBER COULD BE 
AS HIGH AS 25.  SEVEN OF THE NAMES, INCLUDING THOSE OF 
ARAUJO\'S TWO BODYGUARDS, HAVE APPEARED IN THE PRESS, BUT 
POLICE ARE KEEPING THE OTHER NAMES CONFIDENTIAL.  ACCORDING 
TO WITNESS ACCOUNTS REPORTED SO FAR, A LARGE GROUP OF ARMED 
MEN WEARING CAMOUFLAGE, WHO IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS BEING 
FROM THE FARC\'S 59TH FRONT, BEGAN STOPPING CARS ALONG THE 
ROAD TO VALLEDUPAR AT ABOUT 12:45 P.M., DETAINING A LARGE 
NUMBER OF CARS AND THEIR OCCUPANTS FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  THE 
GUERRILLAS RELEASED ABOUT 50 HOSTAGES BEGINNING AROUND 7:00 
P.M., SOME OF WHOM ARE STILL BEING INTERVIEWED BY THE 
VALLEDUPAR POLICE.  IT HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE PRESS, BUT 
NOT CONFIRMED, THAT ONE PERSON MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED.  ONE 
OF THE RELEASED HOSTAGES REPORTEDLY TOLD THE VALLEDUPAR 
POLICE THAT ARAUJO AND CECILIA MONSALVO RIVERA (THE 
PRESIDENT OF A CULTURAL FOUNDATION) WERE SEEN BEING TAKEN 
IN THEIR CAR ALONG THE ROAD TO ATANQUEZ, LOCATED IN THE 
MOUNTAINOUS SIERRA NEVADA REGION.

1.  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON; REASONS 
1.5 B,D. 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY: DESPITE A SERIES OF ATTEMPTS SINCE MID- 
NOVEMBER BY UNSYG OUTGOING REPRESENTATIVE JAN EGELAND, 
GOC PEACE COMMISSIONER CAMILO GOMEZ, AND AMBASSADORS FROM 
THE \"GROUP OF FACILITATORS\" COUNTRIES TO RE-START PEACE 
TALKS WITH THE FARC, THE LATTER REMAIN INTRANSIGENT IN 
THEIR DEMANDS.  THE FARC LEADERSHIP HAS STATED REPEATEDLY 
THAT THEY WILL NOT NEGOTIATE UNTIL THE GOC RELAXES ITS 
CONTROLS OVER THE \"DESPEJE,\" ESPECIALLY THE ENTRY OF 
THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS SYMPATHETIC TO THE FARC AND 
COLOMBIAN MILITARY OVERFLIGHTS.  FARC SUPREME COMMANDER 
MARULANDA HAS INVITED COLOMBIAN POLITICAL, JUDICIAL AND 
BUSINESS LEADERS TO A JANUARY 15, 2001 MEETING IN THE 
\"DESPEJE\" TO CLARIFY WHAT THE COLOMBIAN ESTABLISHMENT IS 
WILLING TO NEGOTIATE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (U) ON NOVEMBER 26, FARC SUPREME COMMANDER MANUEL 
MARULANDA SENT A LETTER THROUGH GOC PEACE COMMISSIONER 
CAMILO GOMEZ TO PRESIDENT PASTRANA, IN WHICH HE ARGUES 
THAT THE GOC HAS TAKEN ALL CONCRETE \"NEGOTIABLES\" OFF THE 
TABLE, INCLUDING PLAN COLOMBIA, AERIAL ERADICATION OF 
ILLICIT CROPS, THE ELECTORAL CALENDAR, PRISONER 
EXCHANGES, AND INTERNATIONAL TREATIES SUBSCRIBED BY 
COLOMBIA ON ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, JUDICIAL ISSUES, AND 
EXTRADITION. 
 
4. (U) MARULANDA CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO 
NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOC, AND CALLS FOR A MEETING ON 
JANUARY 15, 2002 IN THE FARC \"DEMILITARIZED ZONE\" 
(\"DESPEJE\") WITH THE SENATE AND HOUSE SPEAKERS, THE 
SUPREME AND CONSTITUTIONAL COURT PRESIDENTS, THE CHAMBERS 
OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY PRESIDENTS, AND THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH HIERARCHY.  HE STATED HE EXPECTS THIS GROUP TO 
EXPLAIN TO HIM \"EXACTLY WHAT IS NEGOTIABLE.\" 
 
5.  (U) MARULANDA\'S LETTER FOLLOWS A SERIES OF LARGELY 
UNSUCCESSFUL MEETINGS IN THE \"DESPEJE\" WITH UNSYG 
COLOMBIA REPRESENTATIVE JAN EGELAND, GOC PEACE 
COMMISSIONER CAMILO GOMEZ, AND EU AND INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY AMBASSADORS, RESPECTIVELY.  ON NOVEMBER 16, THE 
FARC REFUSED JAN EGELAND\'S REQUEST TO MEET IN THE 
DESPEJE.  INSTEAD, FARC SPOKESMAN RAUL REYES SENT EGELAND 
A LETTER STATING THAT EGELAND WOULD NOT BE GIVEN AN 
AUDIENCE UNTIL THE GOC LIFTED AN ORDER PROHIBITING FREE 
ENTRY OF THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS INTO THE DESPEJE AS WELL 
AS OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THE ZONE. 
 
6.  (C) SEVERAL DAYS LATER, THE FARC CHANGED ITS MIND AND 
MET ON NOVEMBER 22 WITH EGELAND AND NEWLY-DESIGNATED 
UNSYG COLOMBIA REPRESENTATIVE JAMES LEMOYNE IN THE 
\"DESPEJE.\"  ALTHOUGH EGELAND TOLD LOCAL PRESS THAT BOTH 
SIDES STILL HAVE THE WILL TO MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD, 
EMBASSY CONTACTS SAID THAT THE MEETING WAS DIFFICULT AT 
BEST, AND THAT FARC INTERLOCUTORS RAUL REYES AND JOAQUIN 
GOMEZ TOLD EGELAND AND LEMOYNE IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT 
TALKS COULD NOT PROCEED SO LONG AS THE GOC MAINTAINS ITS 
NEW, TIGHTER CONTROLS OVER THE \"DESPEJE.\"  ON NOVEMBER 
23, CAMILO GOMEZ MET WITH REYES AND GOMEZ, AND WAS 
REPORTEDLY GIVEN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME MESSAGE -- RELAX 
CONTROL OVER THE ZONE AND THEN WE\'LL SEE. 
 
7. (C) ON NOVEMBER 25, A DELEGATION OF \"GROUP OF 
FACILITATORS\" AMBASSADORS MET WITH REYES AND GOMEZ IN THE 
\"DESPEJE.\"  ON NOVEMBER 26, A FOREIGN DIPLOMAT WHO WAS 
PRESENT AT THE MEETING TOLD POL/ECONCOUNS THAT THE 
ATMOSPHERICS WERE \"VERY FORMAL,\" THAT REYES AND GOMEZ 
HAMMERED AT THE GOC SECURITY CONTROLS OVER THE DESPEJE, 
ESPECIALLY THE OVERFLIGHTS, AND THAT THEY WERE FIRM ON 
THEIR POSITION THAT CONTROLS HAVE TO BE RELAXED. 
 
8. (C) THE DIPLOMAT SAID THE AMBASSADORS, LED BY FRENCH 
AMBASSADOR PARFAIT (FRANCE IS NOW CHAIR OF THE \"GROUP OF 
FACILITATORS,\" UNDER A ROTATING CHAIR SYSTEM), TOLD THE 
FARC THAT THE EU WILL MEET IN DECEMBER TO DISCUSS THE 
ISSUE OF FARC VISAS AND EXPLAINED THAT SOME MEMBERS WERE 
ADVOCATING A HARD LINE BASED ON THE FARC KIDNAPPINGS OF 
FOREIGNERS.  ASKED WHETHER THE GROUP HAD GIVEN THE FARC 
AN \"ULTIMATUM\" CALLING FOR THE FARC TO CHANGE ITS TACTICS 
OR LOSE THE VISAS, THE DIPLOMATS ANSWERED THAT NEITHER AN 
\"ULTIMATUM,\" NOR A HARD MESSAGE HAD BEEN DELIVERED BY THE 
EU. 
 
9.  (C) THE DIPLOMAT SAID THAT THE GROUP ASKED THE FARC 
TO MAKE SOME TYPE OF \"GESTURE\" THAT WOULD HELP ADVANCE 
THE PEACE PROCESS.  IN THE END, THE FARC MADE NO PROMISES 
TO EITHER MAKE A \"GESTURE\" OR TO AGREE TO A BROADER 
MEETING WITH THE GOC NEGOTIATING TEAM AND FACILITATORS. 
INSTEAD, THE FARC COMPLAINED THAT SUCH A MEETING WAS 
UNLIKELY UNTIL/UNLESS THE GOC LIFTS SOME OF ITS SECURITY 
CONTROLS.  THE DIPLOMAT SAID THAT, INSTEAD, REYES AND 
GOMEZ USED THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAIL AGAINST THE UNITED 
NATIONS, WHICH THEY CHARACTERIZED AS AN UNREPRESENTATIVE 
BODY BECAUSE \"SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ARE NOT FAIRLY 
REPRESENTED IN IT.\" 
 
10.  (C) COMMENT: THE FARC LEADERSHIP CONTINUES TO PLAY 
BRINKMANSHIP WITH THE PEACE PROCESS.  THEY HAVE NOT 
BUDGED AT ALL IN THEIR DEMAND THAT THE GOC RELAX ITS 
CONTROLS OVER THE \"DESPEJE,\" BEFORE TALKS CAN RESUME. 
THE FARC LIKELY FEELS VULNERABLE TO THE COLOMBIAN 
SECURITY FORCES\' ADDED SURVEILLANCE OF THE ZONE, WHICH 
THEY BELIEVE ADVERSELY IMPACTS THEIR ABILITY TO USE THE 
ZONE AS A REPOSITORY FOR KIDNAP VICTIMS AND STOLEN CATTLE 
AND VEHICLES; A REST AND RECUPERATION AND TRAINING AREA 
FOR COMBATANTS, AND A COCA GROWING ZONE.  MARULANDA\'S 
LATEST OFFER TO DELAY TALKS UNTIL NEXT JANUARY 15 IS 
PROBABLY INTENDED TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE GOC AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY (ESPECIALLY THE EUROPEANS) TO 
EASE UP ON CONTROLS OVER THE \"DESPEJE\" AND ON THE EU\'S 
POSSIBLE REVOCATION OF VISAS TO LEVERAGE THE FARC.

CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON FOR REASONS: 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY: AS THE FARC\'S WAVE OF VIOLENCE AND 
DESTRUCTION CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, PRESIDENT 
PASTRANA MET WITH HIS TOP MILITARY AND CIVILIAN ADVISORS 
TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO COMBAT THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS. 
MEANWHILE, POPULAR ATTITUDES ARE HARDENING AGAINST THE 
FARC, AS PEOPLE TAKE TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST THE 
INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------- 
ATTACKS CONTINUE 
---------------- 
 
2.  (U) THE FARC\'S WAVE OF VIOLENCE CONTINUES, DESPITE 
THE GROWING POPULAR CONDEMNATION OF THE GUERRILLA 
ATTACKS.  ON JANUARY 30, THE FARC DETONATED A CAR BOMB 
BEHIND THE CARACOL TV AND RADIO BUILDING IN CENTRAL 
BOGOTA.  NO ONE WAS HURT IN THE ATTACK, BUT SIX PEOPLE 
WERE KILLED AND 25 WERE INJURED IN FLORENCIA (CAQUETA 
DEPARTMENT) WHEN THE FARC ACTIVATED A BOMB WHILE A 
MILITARY CONVOY WAS PASSING BY.  THEY ALSO EXPLODED TWO 
PACKAGE BOMBS IN FRONT OF THE ARMY\'S 5TH MECHANIZED 
DIVISION BARRACKS IN MEDELLIN. 
 
--------------------- 
NEW SECURITY MEASURES 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (U) ON JANUARY 31, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT ANDRES 
PASTRANA HELD A SECURITY SUMMIT WITH HIGH-LEVEL 
POLITICAL AND MILITARY OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS MEASURES TO 
COMBAT THE FARC OFFENSIVE.  THE SUMMIT WAS ATTENDED BY 
INTERIOR MINISTER ARMANDO ESTRADA, JUSTICE MINISTER 
ROMULO GONZALEZ, VICE PRESIDENT AND DEFENSE MINISTER 
GUSTAVO BELL, ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL JORGE ENRIQUE MORA, 
NAVY COMMANDER ADMIRAL SOTO, POLICE DIRECTOR LUIS 
ERNESTO GILIBERT AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF 
SECURITY (DAS - FBI EQUIVALENT) DIRECTOR COLONEL GERMAN 
GUSTAVO JARAMILLO.  SUBSEQUENTLY, PRESIDENT PASTRANA 
ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS IMPLEMENTING THE 
FOLLOWING SECURITY MEASURES: 
 
-- INSPECTION CHECKPOINTS AT THE ENTRANCES AND EXITS OF 
ALL CITIES; 
 
-- MOBILE CHECKPOINTS INSIDE THE CITIES; 
 
-- RAIDS OF SITES WHERE ATTACKS ARE BEING PLANNED; AND 
 
-- AN INCREASE OF FUNDS TO PAY INFORMANTS. 
 
---------------- 
GROWING PROTESTS 
---------------- 
 
4.  (U) THE NEW MEASURES WERE ANNOUNCED AS PUBLIC 
OPINION CONCERNING THE FARC\'S TACTICS HAS TURNED 
STRONGLY AGAINST THE GUERRILLAS.  ON WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 
30, THE RESIDENTS OF META PROVINCE HELD A 15-MINUTE 
\"POT-BANGING PROTEST\" TO VOICE THEIR OBJECTION TO THE 
FARC\'S RECENT ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, WHILE BOGOTA MAYOR 
ANTANAS MOCKUS LED A SIMILAR PROTEST IN NORTHERN BOGOTA. 
THIS PROTEST FOLLOWED A THREE-MINUTE \"LIGHTS-OUT\" IN 
BOGOTA TO PROTEST THE FARC\'S ATTACKS ON THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH HAVE DESTROYED SCORES OF 
ELECTRICAL PYLONS AND HAVE DAMAGED A MAJOR WATER SUPPLY 
FOR THE CAPITAL. 
 
5.  (U) EVEN THOSE WHO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PEACE 
PROCESS HAVE CONDEMNED THE FARC ATTACKS.  INGRID 
BETANCOURT, AN INDEPENDENT \"GREEN\" PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE, SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE FARC AND CALLED ON THE 
GUERRILLAS TO CEASE THESE ATTACKS.  ANDERS KOMPASS, 
DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH 
COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN COLOMBIA, DESCRIBED THE 
ATTACKS AS \"DEPLORABLE\" AND \"COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.\" 
 
-------------------- 
MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (C) WHILE IT IS NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER THE COLMIL HAS 
RE-DEPLOYED FROM ITS STAGING POINT OUTSIDE OF THE FARC\'S 
SAFE HAVEN (\"DESPEJE\"), DAO REPORTS THAT THE COLAR\'S 
21ST BATTALION BASED IN GRANADA HAS BEEN DEFENDING KEY 
POPULATION CENTERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE REGION 
AROUND THE DESPEJE (REF B).  THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCE 
(FUDRA) ALSO HAS BEEN CONDUCTING OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS 
AGAINST THE FARC\'S 26TH FRONT AND IS STILL FORWARD 
DEPLOYED IN META DEPARTMENT. 
 
-------- 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
 
7. (C) ANALYSTS HAVE POSITED A NUMBER OF THEORIES ABOUT 
THE FARC\'S ONGOING OFFENSIVE.  SOME SENIOR MILITARY AND 
POLICE OFFICIALS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE FARC HAS 
MARKEDLY STEPPED UP ITS ATTACKS AROUND BOGOTA, 
SUGGESTING THAT THE GUERRILLAS MIGHT BE TRYING TO 
ISOLATE THE CAPITAL.  MANY OBSERVERS ALSO BELIEVE THE 
FARC\'S ACTIONS ARE MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO DEMONSTRATE 
THEIR MILITARY CAPABILITIES, APPARENTLY IN THE HOPES OF 
BOLSTERING THEIR LEVERAGE AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. 
ANOTHER THEORY IS THAT THE FARC IS STEPPING UP ITS 
ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO DRAW COLMIL 
FORCES AWAY FROM THE DESPEJE -- IN EFFECT, FORCING THE 
MILITARY TO LOOSEN THE SECURITY CONTROLS ON THE FARC 
SAFE HAVEN, SOMETHING THAT THE GOC HAD REFUSED TO DO IN 
THE NEGOTIATIONS.  WHATEVER THEIR MOTIVES, THE FARC\'S 
LATEST OFFENSIVE MIGHT BE A PYHRRIC VICTORY.  WHILE 
THEIR ATTACKS HAVE HAD A PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT ON THE 
POPULACE (ESPECIALLY IN THE CITIES), THESE ACTIONS HAVE 
PRODUCED A POLITICAL REACTION THAT ULTIMATELY UNDERMINES 
THE FARC\'S INTERESTS.

CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON, REASONS: 
1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: FARC ACTIONS AGAINST THE MILITARY, THE 
CIVILIAN POPULATION, AND COLOMBIA\'S INFRASTRUCTURE FLARED 
DURING A THREE-WEEK PERIOD FOLLOWING THE END OF THE 
DESPEJE.  SINCE THEN, FARC ACTIVITY AGAINST THE 
POPULATION HAD BEEN MINIMAL, UNTIL THIS PAST WEEK: FROM 
MARCH 24 TO 27, FARC REBELS ATTACKED THE TOWN OF SARAVENA 
(ARAUCA DEPARTMENT) TWICE, DESTROYING SEVERAL GOC 
OFFICES.  ON APRIL 5, INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS MEMBERS 
RECOVERED THE BODIES OF TWO POLICEMEN MURDERED BY THE 
FARC.  ONE WAS THE FATHER OF ANDRES FELIPE PEREZ, THE 13- 
YEAR OLD CANCER PATIENT WHO DIED LAST DECEMBER, AFTER 
REPEATED PLEAS TO THE FARC TO RELEASE HIS FATHER.  ON 
APRIL 6, FARC OPERATIVES EXPLODED TWO BOMBS IN A POPULAR 
NIGHT SPOT IN VILLAVICENCIO, KILLING 12 AND INJURING 100 
OTHERS.    EMBASSY CONTACTS ALSO REPORTED TWO BOMB 
EXPLOSIONS IN BOGOTA OVER THE WEEKEND, THE FIRST NEAR 
BOGOTA\'S HEAVILY-USED TRANSMILENIO PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM, 
AND THE SECOND AGAINST AN AUTO-REPAIR SHOP USED BY HIGH- 
LEVEL POLICE OFFICERS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) ON MARCH 24, AN EXPLOSION IN SARAVENA (ARAUCA 
DEPARTMENT) CAUSED HEAVY DAMAGE TO THE OFFICES OF THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL.  ALTHOUGH NO 
ONE WAS INJURED, NEARLY A BLOCK OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS 
IN DOWNTOWN SARAVENA WAS LEFT IN RUINS.  LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED THAT THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE WAS 
PLANTED BY FARC REBELS.  LESS THAN 48 HOURS LATER, ON 
MARCH 27, ANOTHER DEVICE WENT OFF, DESTROYING THE MAYOR\'S 
OFFICE AND THE LOCAL POLICE STATION.  TWO PEOPLE WERE 
INJURED IN THIS SECOND ATTACK.  COLOMBIAN ARMY BOMB 
SQUADS WERE ABLE TO DEFUSE TWO MORE BOMBS THAT SET TO 
EXPLODE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. 
 
3. (U) MEANWHILE, IN ANOTHER SAD CHAPTER TO THE SAGA OF 
ANDRES FELIPE PEREZ, ON APRIL 5, THE INTERNATIONAL RED 
CROSS RECOVERED THE BODIES OF TWO POLICE OFFICERS, BOTH 
MURDERED BY THE FARC.  ONE OF THE BODIES WAS THAT OF 
CORPORAL JOSE NORBERTO PEREZ, KIDNAPPED BY THE FARC 27 
MONTHS AGO, FROM RISARALDA DEPARTMENT.  PEREZ WAS THE 
FATHER OF ANDRES FELIPE, A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO DIED OF 
CANCER LAST DECEMBER, AFTER HAVING PLEADED WITH THE FARC 
TO RELEASE HIS FATHER SO THAT THE FAMILY COULD BE 
REUNITED BEFORE THE BOY\'S DEATH.  THE FARC REFUSED TO 
RELEASE PEREZ, CAUSING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
OUTRAGE.  THE SECOND BODY WAS IDENTIFIED AS POLICEMAN 
VICTOR MANUEL RUEDA, KIDNAPPED BY THE FARC FROM ANTIOQUIA 
DEPARTMENT IN AUGUST 1999.  IN A STATEMENT TO THE PRESS, 
THE VICTIMS\' FAMILIES SAID THAT THE TWO MEN HAD BEEN 
BROUGHT FROM THE JUNGLES OF SOUTHERN COLOMBIA TO 
ANTIOQUIA, WHERE THEY WERE SHOT IN THE BACK WHILE 
ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE. 
 
4. (U) ON APRIL 7, 12 PEOPLE, INCLUDING SIX MINORS, WERE 
KILLED AND AS MANY AS 100 OTHERS INJURED BY A FARC 
\"BOOBY-TRAP\" BOMB DETONATED IN VILLAVICENCIO (META 
DEPARTMENT), SOME 50 MILES FROM BOGOTA.  THE TWO-STAGE 
ATTACK TOOK PLACE IN THE \"ZONA ROSA\" DISTRICT OF THE 
CITY, KNOWN FOR ITS POPULAR BARS AND NIGHTCLUBS.  AT 
APPROXIMATELY 1:00 A.M., A 20-KILOGRAM DEVICE EXPLODED, 
SHAKING THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT CAUSING LITTLE INJURY OR 
DAMAGE.  MANY IN THE AREA CAME OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT HAD 
HAPPENED.  ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER, AFTER A CROWD HAD 
FORMED, AND AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE AUTHORITIES, FARC 
TERRORISTS DETONATED A SECOND DEVICE -- A CAR BOMB LOADED 
WITH 100 KILOGRAMS OF HIGH-POWER EXPLOSIVE.  IN ADDITION 
TO THE DEATHS AND INJURIES, THE BLAST DESTROYED 15 
VEHICLES, 30 HOUSES, AND THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE \"SUPER 
RADIO\" BROADCASTING COMPANY.  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
ALVARO URIBE VELEZ HAS CLAIMED THAT \"SUPER RADIO\" WAS THE 
TARGET OF THE ATTACK, FOR HAVING IGNORED FARC DEMANDS TO 
STOP BROADCASTING HIS CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCEMENTS.  PRESIDENT 
PASTRANA CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS, SAYING THAT THERE WAS NO 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TERRORIST BOMBINGS IN ISRAEL AND 
THOSE THAT TAKE PLACE IN COLOMBIA.  PASTRANA REITERATED 
HIS REQUEST TO THE WORLD COMMUNITY TO HELP COLOMBIA 
COMBAT THE TERRORISTS. 
 
5. (U) THE APRIL 7 CAR-BOMB IN VILLAVICENCIO WAS THE 
SECOND BOMBING INCIDENT IN THE DEPARTMENT IN TWO DAYS. 
ON APRIL 5, FARC GUERRILLAS DETONATED A BOMB ALONG THE 
VILLAVICENCIO-BOGOTA HIGHWAY, HALTING TRAFFIC FOR TEN 
HOURS.  THE SAME DAY, FARC FORCES DETONATED A CAR BOMB IN 
THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT OF THE SMALL TOWN OF FUENTE DE 
ORO, DAMAGING FOUR HOMES AND SEVERAL SMALL BUSINESSES. 
POLICE PREVENTED A LARGER TRAGEDY BY ORDERING THE 
EVACUATION OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THE AREA, AFTER DETECTING 
A SECOND CAR HEAVILY LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES. 
 
6. (U) THE FARC MAY ALSO BE INVOLVED IN THE RECENT MURDER 
OF A PRIEST IN NEIVA (HUILA DEPARTMENT).  ON APRIL 7, TWO 
GUNMEN ENTERED A CHURCH IN NEIVA, AND SHOT AND KILLED 
PRIEST JUAN RAMON NUNEZ, WHILE HE WAS CONDUCTING MASS. 
NUNEZ DIED AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL.  PRESS REPORTS SPECULATED 
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TARGETED BECAUSE OF HIS PUBLIC 
DEMAND FOR THE FARC TO RELEASE A LOCAL KIDNAP VICTIM. 
ONE PARISHIONER WAS ALSO WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK.  NUNEZ\'S 
MURDER BRINGS TO 40 THE NUMBER OF PRIESTS MURDERED BY THE 
FARC AND ELN IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 
 
7. (U) EMBASSY ATF REPORTED TWO BOMB EXPLOSIONS IN 
DOWNTOWN BOGOTA ON APRIL 6.  AT 8:20 P.M., A GRENADE 
EXPLODED AT A STATION OF BOGOTA\'S POPULAR TRANSMILENIO 
PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM.  THE STATION AND THREE BUSES WERE 
DAMAGED.  DIJIN (JUDICIAL AND INVESTIGATIVE POLICE 
DIRECTORATE) CONTACTS ADVISED THAT ALTHOUGH THE ATTACKER 
HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED, FARC OPERATIVES ARE SUSPECTED, 
BASED ON AN ATTACK ON THE SAME STATION BY FARC FORCES 
ROUGHLY SIX WEEKS AGO.  THE SECOND BLAST TOOK PLACE AT 
AROUND 8:30 P.M., AT AN AUTO-REPAIR SHOP USED BY THE 
COLOMBIAN NATIONAL POLICE.  DIJIN SOURCES REPORTED THAT 
THE BOMB MAY HAVE BEEN PLACED BY FARC AGENTS, WHO HAD 
REPORTEDLY BEEN EXTORTING THE SHOP OWNER. 
 
8. (C) COMMENT: IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE CAR BOMBING IN 
VILLAVICENCIO REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING OF THE FARC\'S 
ANTICIPATED ACTIONS IN ADVANCE OF THE MAY 26 PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION.  DURING THE PAST SIX WEEKS, THE COLMIL HAS 
MAINTAINED FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE OPERATIONS AGAINST FARC 
UNITS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  ALSO, THE AIR FORCE 
CARRIED OUT PREEMPTIVE STRIKES AGAINST FARC MOBILE 
COLUMNS, WHICH PROBABLY HAS COMPLICATED GUERRILLA EFFORTS 
TO LAUNCH THEIR CAMPAIGN.  AT THE SAME TIME, SENIOR 
COLMIL OFFICERS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY ARE 
INCREASINGLY HARD PRESSED TO COVER KEY INFRASTRUCTURE 
TARGETS WHILE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS 
AGAINST THE GUERRILLAS.  WITH THE ELECTIONS ON THE 
HORIZON, THE COLMIL WILL LIKELY BEGIN TO FOCUS THEIR 
EFFORTS ON A STRATEGY TO PROTECT POLLING PLACES AND 
VOTERS, A TASK THAT THEY FULFILLED WITH REMARKABLE 
SUCCESS FOR THE MARCH 10 CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS.  DAO 
CONTACTS HAVE ADVISED THAT POLLING SECURITY EFFORTS WILL 
NOT DETRACT FROM \"OPERATION TANATOS,\" THE COLMIL\'S 
ONGOING EFFORT TO RE-ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT CONTROL IN 19 
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS.

REF: BOGOTA 3101 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON.  REASON: 1.5 
(B) AND (D) 
 
1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT, MILITARY AND 
CIVILIAN INTERLOCUTORS UNEQUIVOCALLY CONFIRM THE 
EXISTENCE OF FARC CAMPS IN VENEZUELA (REFTEL). EMBASSY 
INTERLOCUTORS IN THE GOC FEEL THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY HAS 
BEEN ACTIVELY ORDERED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS TO TURN A 
BLIND EYE TO FARC AND ELN CAMPS.  A RELIABLE SOURCE GAVE 
POLOFF DESCRIPTIONS AND COORDINATES FOR CAMPS IN 
VENEZUELA. THE GOC, FOR THE TIME BEING, IS PROBABLY 
CONTENT TO LET THE ISSUE PLAY OUT IN THE PRESS AND WAIT 
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO CHAVEZ.  THE COLMIL, HOWEVER, WILL 
MOST LIKELY CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C) SEVERAL SOURCES, INCLUDING A COLMIL HELICOPTER 
PILOT (REFTEL), THE ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER, AND A 
REPORTER FOR EL TIEMPO, COLOMBIA\'S LEADING DAILY, HAVE 
GIVEN REPORTS ON HOW TO ARRIVE AT FARC CAMPS IN 
VENEZUELA.  THE ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER GAVE POLCOUNS A 
MAP WITH THE SITE OF ONE FARC CAMP APPROXIMATELY 1.2 
MILES INTO VENEZUELAN TERRITORY HIGHLIGHTED (8-45-10N,72- 
40-15W). NOTE: POST WILL PROVIDE A COPY TO WHA/AND. END 
NOTE. 
 
3. (C) DIRECTIONS WERE GIVEN TO EMBOFF BY A REPORTER FROM 
EL TIEMPO INDICATING THAT SHE DROVE FOR 35 MINUTES AFTER 
ENTERING VENEZUELA TO GET TO ONE OF THE CAMPS AND FOR 20 
MINUTES TO GET TO THE OTHER.  THE CAMPS SHE VISITED WERE 
ACROSS THE BORDER FROM TIBU, NORTE DE SANTANDER. 
 
4. (S/NF) SEPARATELY, A VERY RELIABLE COLOMBIAN SOURCE 
GAVE EMBOFF THE COORDINATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF SEVERAL 
FARC CAMPS IN VENEZUELA.  THE SOURCE SAID THESE CAMPS 
REPRESENTED \"THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG,\" BUT WERE INDICATIVE 
OF THE LEVEL TO WHICH THE FARC HAS SET UP OPERATIONS IN 
VENEZUELA.  HE ELABORATED THAT IT IS AN OPEN SECRET FOR 
THE VENEZUELANS THAT THESE CAMPS EXIST.  A CAMP IN THE 
AREA FROM WHICH THE ATTACK ON CARRENO\'S TROOPS PROBABLY 
CAME IS LOCATED IN VENEZUELA DIRECTLY OPPOSITE FROM A 
COLOMBIAN AIRSTRIP.  THE LOCATION OF THE CAMP IS 09-08- 
18N, 072-50-54W.  THE CAMP IS REPORTEDLY CAPABLE OF 
HOUSING BETWEEN 100-120 FARC GUERRILLAS.  ANOTHER CAMP 
ABOUT ONE KILOMETER INTO VENEZUELAN TERRITORY IS LOCATED 
ON THE SOCUAVO DEL SUR RIVER (0859N, 07233W). 
 
5. (S/NF) THE SOURCE ALSO GAVE INFORMATION ABOUT A CAMP 
LOCATED ON THE CATATUMBO RIVER ACROSS FROM NORTE DE 
SANTANDER DEPARTMENT NORTH OF THE CITY OF CUCUTA (9-21N, 
072-44W) IN WHICH ABOUT 120 FARC GUERRILLAS WERE COUNTED 
IN LATE FEBRUARY.  ANOTHER CAMP HAS ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED 
ACROSS THE BORDER FROM RIO DE ORO (08-37N, 072-39W). 
ANOTHER CAMP LOCATED NEAR SAN SIMON DE CUCUY (01168N, 
066509W) HAS A GRASS AIRSTRIP.  YET ANOTHER CAMP WHICH 
APPEARS TO BE A TRAINING FACILITY IS LOCATED IN THE AREA 
OF GUASDUALITO, APURE DEPARTMENT, VENEZUELA (07-15N, 70- 
44W).  UNIDENTIFIED FOREIGN ADVISORS HAVE REPORTEDLY BEEN 
SEEN IN THIS CAMP. 
 
6. (C) SINCE CHAVEZ CAME TO POWER, THE GOV HAS BROKEN OFF 
SEVERAL LONGSTANDING GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CONTACTS, 
INCLUDING MILITARY TO MILITARY CONTACTS IN SEPTEMBER, 
2000. THE GOC HAS REITERATED ITS DESIRE TO REINSTATE THE 
COLOMBIA-VENEZUELA BORDER COMMISSION AS IT TRIES TO 
MANAGE THE LATEST BORDER CRISIS IN A DIPLOMATIC WAY THAT 
WILL NOT PLACE FURTHER STRAIN ON THE ALREADY DELICATE 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIP.  AFTER HAVING A UNIT AMBUSHED 
AND LOSING TROOPS TO FARC UNITS OPERATING OUT OF 
VENEZUELA ON MARCH 19, COLOMBIAN ARMY SECOND DIVISION 
COMMANDER GENERAL MARTIN CARRENO FELT THE NEED TO 
PUBLICLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS HIS TROOPS WERE FACING 
(REFTEL). 
 
7. (C) COMMENT:  THERE IS A MOUNTING BODY OF HARD 
EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE FARC GUERRILLA CAMPS IN 
VENEZUELA. THE GOC, FOR THE TIME BEING, IS PROBABLY 
CONTENT TO LET THE ISSUE PLAY OUT IN THE PRESS AND WAIT 
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO CHAVEZ.  THE COLMIL, HOWEVER, WILL 
MOST LIKELY CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT, ESPECIALLY, IF THE 
ATTACKS FROM VENEZUELA LEAD TO MORE DEATHS AMONG 
COLOMBIAN UNITS, THE SPARK THAT LED GENERAL CARRENO TO GO 
PUBLIC IN THE MOST RECENT EVENT. POLOFFS WILL VISIT 
BUCARAMANGA, THE SITE OF SECOND DIVISION HEADQUARTERS, 
THE WEEK OF APRIL 15 TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE WITH GENERAL 
CARRENO AND HIS STAFF.

SUBJECT: FARC THREATS CAUSE ENTIRE TOWN TO FLEE 
 
1.  VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INHABITANTS OF PUERTO ALVIRA, META 
DEPARTMENT, HAVE FLED BECAUSE OF THREATENED GUERRILLA 
ACTIONS.  PUERTO ALVIRA IS ON THE BORDER BETWEEN META AND 
GUAVIARE DEPARTMENTS, IN SOUTHEASTERN COLOMBIA, NEAR THE 
EASTERN BORDER OF THE FORMER DEMILITARIZED ZONE.  IN 
MID-JULY, AND AGAIN AT THE END OF LAST WEEK, THE 44TH FRONT 
OF THE FARC TOLD PUERTO ALVIRA RESIDENTS THAT PARAMILITARIES 
WERE MOVING INTO THE AREA, AND THAT FIGHTING IN PUERTO ALVIRA 
BETWEEN THE FARC AND PARAMILITARIES WAS IMMINENT.  THE FARC 
THEN ORDERED THE INHABITANTS TO LEAVE OR BE KILLED, ACCORDING 
TO A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED 
CROSS (ICRC), WHICH IS SENDING PERSONNEL TO THE AREA TO 
INVESTIGATE.  WHEN COLOMBIAN ARMY TROOPS ARRIVED ON MONDAY, 
THEY DISCOVERED THAT ALL BUT FIVE FAMILIES HAD ABANDONED 
PUERTO ALVIRA.  BOTH THE 39TH AND 44TH FRONTS OF THE FARC 
OPERATE IN THE AREA. 
 
2.  MEDIA REPORTS VARY WIDELY AS TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
AFFECTED, FROM A LOW OF 500 TO A HIGH OF 5,000.  THE ICRC 
REPRESENTATIVE TOLD POLOFF THAT 5,000 IS DEFINITELY AN 
EXAGGERATION.  BASED ON INFORMATION FROM CHURCH AND LOCAL 
OFFICIALS, THE REPRESENTIVE ESTIMATES THAT ROUGHLY 2,000 
PEOPLE FLED.  THE LOCAL OFFICE OF COLOMBIA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
OMBUDSMAN AGREED, TELLING POLOFF THE NUMBER CANNOT BE HIGHER 
THAN 2,500 AT MOST.  APPROXIMATELY HALF WENT TO 
VILLAVICENCIO, CAPITAL OF META DEPARTMENT, WHILE ANOTHER 500 
OR SO FLED EAST TO MOCUARE, A NEIGHBORING TOWN THAT -- LIKE 
PUERTO ALVIRA -- HAS NO POLICE PRESENCE.  THE WHEREABOUTS OF 
THE OTHER 500 OR SO PEOPLE IS A MYSTERY.  NEWSPAPER EL TIEMPO 
REPORTS THAT THE FARC KIDNAPPED AT LEAST 35 YOUTH, STATING 
THE YOUTH ARE NOW GUERRILLAS.  AN INFORMED GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIAL TOLD POLOFF THAT HE BELIEVES THE FARC ARE HOLDING 
CAPTIVE MANY MORE PEOPLE.  AID AGENCIES ARE RUSHING TO 
PROVIDE FOOD AND WARM CLOTHING TO THE DISPLACED. 
 
3.  PUERTO ALVIRA LIES ALONG A KEY DRUG TRANSIT ROUTE, IN A 
REGION WITH A LONG HISTORY OF FARC-PARAMILITARY CONFLICT.  ON 
MAY 4, 1998, PARAMILITARIES MASSACRED 19 PEOPLE IN PUERTO 
ALVIRA.  SIMILARLY, NEARBY MAPIRIPAN WAS THE SITE OF AN AUC 
MASSACRE IN 1997.  ALSO, IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR, THE FARC 
DEMANDED THAT THE PEOPLE OF MAPIRIPAN ABANDON THE TOWN.  WITH 
THE HELP OF GOVERNMENT AND CHURCH OFFICIALS, THE CITIZENS OF 
MAPIRIPAN TOOK SHELTER FOR FOUR DAYS ON NEARBY RANCHES, UNTIL 
ARMY TROOPS ARRIVED IN MAPIRIPAN.

SUBJECT: FARC INAUGURATION DAY VIOLENCE 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON.  FOR REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  ON AUGUST 7, PRESUMED MEMBERS OF THE FARC\'S 
URBAN MILITIAS CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN TWO DIFFERENT 
AREAS OF BOGOTA.  THE FIRST ATTACK, WHICH TARGETED A GOC 
MILITARY INSTALLATION, WAS PROBABLY MEANT TO CONFUSE AND 
DISTRACT THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY SERVICES. SEVERAL HOURS 
LATER, THE FARC LAUNCHED A SECOND ATTACK ON THE INAUGURATION 
SITE OF INCOMING PRESIDENT ALVARO URIBE VELEZ AS THE CEREMONY 
BEGAN.  IN ALL, THERE WERE 27 EXPLOSIONS IN BOGOTA RESULTING 
IN THE DEATHS OF 19 INNOCENT BY-STANDERS; OVER 70 OTHERS WERE 
WOUNDED.  THE ATTACKS WERE WELL PLANNED BUT POORLY EXECUTED, 
THUS SPARING BOGOTA FROM WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A CATASTROPHIC 
EVENT.  MEANWHILE, FARC BLOCS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY LAUNCHED 
SMALL-SCALE ATTACKS THAT CAUSED NO SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE OR HARM 
TO CIVILIANS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
DIVERSIONARY ATTACK IN NORTHWEST BOGOTA 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) AT APPROXIMATELY 1135 HOURS ON AUGUST 7 -- THE 
MORNING OF PRESIDENT ALVARO URIBE\'S MUCH-ANTICIPATED 
INAUGURATION -- SEVERAL EXPLOSIONS WERE REPORTED NEAR THE 
JOSE MARIA CORDOBA MILITARY ACADEMY IN THE NORTHWEST AREA OF 
BOGOTA.  IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY EIGHT 
IMPROVISED MORTAR ROUNDS WERE LAUNCHED FROM A RESIDENCE 
LOCATED AT CALLE 99A, 57A-15.  THE IMPROVISED MORTAR ROUNDS 
DETONATED IN AREAS ADJACENT TO THE MILITARY ACADEMY AND 
INJURED SEVERAL CITIZENS. 
 
3.  (C) COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES WERE INITIALLY CONFUSED BY 
REPORTS OF A GOLD BMW, WHICH WITNESSES CLAIMED DROVE AROUND 
THROWING EXPLOSIVES.  COLOMBIAN NATIONAL POLICE LATER 
SEARCHED THE ABOVE RESIDENCE AND DISCOVERED 100 METAL 
LAUNCHING TUBES.  OF THE 100, ONLY 8 HAD FIRED. 
 
-------------------------- 
ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON PALACE 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) AT APPROXIMATELY 1510 HOURS, SEVERAL MORE EXPLOSIONS 
WERE REPORTED IN THE AREA OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AT THE 
START OF THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL CEREMONY.  IT WAS LATER 
DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY SIX IMPROVISED MORTAR ROUNDS 
WERE LAUNCHED FROM A RESIDENCE LOCATED AT CARRERA 26B, 4-44. 
THE IMPROVISED MORTAR ROUNDS DETONATED IN THE AREAS ADJACENT 
TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.  ONE LANDED IN THE PARKING LOT, 
WOUNDING SEVERAL SECURITY OFFICIALS, AND ANOTHER ROUND STRUCK 
THE FACADE OF THE BUILDING, CAUSING MINOR DAMAGE.  THE OTHER 
MORTAR ROUNDS LANDED IN A POOR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD AND 
KILLED 19 PEOPLE. 
 
5.  (C) COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES SEARCHED THE ABOVE RESIDENCE 
AND DISCOVERED 80 LAUNCHING TUBES.  OF THE 80, ONLY 6 HAD 
FIRED.  ACCORDING TO ATF PERSONNEL WHO WENT TO THE SITE, THE 
LAUNCHING TUBES WERE LAID IN CEMENT ON A BACK PATIO.  THE 
PATIO WAS COVERED BY A CORRUGATED PLASTIC ROOF, WHICH 
PREVENTED OVERHEAD SURVEILLANCE FROM DETECTING THEIR 
PRESENCE. 
 
6.  (C) MILITARY AND POLICE SOURCES BLAME THE FARC URBAN 
MILITIAS.  NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE.  ACCORDING TO THE ATF, 
THE DEVICES AT BOTH LOCATIONS WERE IDENTICAL, IMPROVISED 
MORTAR ROUNDS CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY ONE KILOGRAM OF 
ANFO EXPLOSIVES ENCASED IN AN IRON SHELL WITH DIRECTIONAL 
FINS WELDED ON.  THE ROUNDS WERE LAUNCHED FROM STEEL TUBES 
APPROXIMATELY 2.5 METERS TALL AND 120 MM IN DIAMETER.  THE 
WELL-MADE LAUNCHING MECHANISM FAILED ONLY BECAUSE THE FARC 
USED A 12 VOLT BATTERY TO IGNITE THE CHARGE.  ACCORDING TO 
THE ATF, IF THE BATTERY HAD NOT FAILED, ALL OF THE MORTARS 
WOULD HAVE FIRED.  MEANWHILE, IN BOGOTA AND THE SURROUNDING 
AREA, COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES DEACTIVATED FIVE BOMBS, AND 
NINE OTHER EXPLOSIVE DEVICES OR GRENADES EXPLODED WITHOUT 
INCIDENT. 
 
----------------------------- 
ATTACKS ELSEWHERE IN COLOMBIA 
----------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  ACCORDING TO THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY, IN OTHER PARTS 
OF COLOMBIA ON AUGUST 7, THE FARC DETONATED SEVERAL EXPLOSIVE 
DEVICES, DESTROYED POWER TOWERS, BLEW UP PORTIONS OF THE GAS 
PIPELINE, AND INITIATED COMBAT IN SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS WITH 
THE COLOMBIAN ARMY.  THREE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES DETONATED IN 
CALI, CAPITAL OF VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT.  IN ARMENIA, 
CAPITAL OF QUINDO DEPARTMENT, FARC MILITIAS DETONATED AN 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AND THREW A GRENADE THAT CAUSED SOME DAMAGE. 
IN ADDITION, THE FARC DOWNED EIGHT ELECTRIC TOWERS IN 
RISARALDA, ARAUCA, AND BOYACA DEPARTMENTS, AND BLEW UP A 
SECTION OF THE GAS PIPELINE NEAR VILLANUEVA, GUAJIRA 
DEPARTMENT.  THE SAME DAY, THE FARC INITIATED COMBAT WITH THE 
COLOMBIAN ARMY IN ARAUCA, TOLIMA, AND CUNDINAMARCA 
DEPARTMENTS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (C) THE FARC, INTENT ON PULLING OFF A HIGH-PROFILE 
ATTACK, UNSUCCESSFULLY SOUGHT TO STEAL THE SHOW FROM URIBE ON 
INAUGURATION DAY.  WHILE THE MILITARY AND POLICE HAD 
IMPRESSIVE SECURITY IN PLACE, THE FARC STILL MANAGED -- 
PROBABLY OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME -- TO SNEAK AN IMPRESSIVE 
AMOUNT OF MORTARS WITHIN ABOUT A KILOMETER AND A HALF OF THE 
INAUGURAL SITE.  IN THIS CASE, LUCK WAS ON THE COLOMBIAN 
SECURITY FORCE\'S SIDE.  THE RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN 
CATASTROPHIC HAD ALL THE LAUNCHING TUBES FIRED.  THE MAYOR OF 
BOGOTA AND MANY OTHER OFFICIALS HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE PUBLIC 
DID NOT \"NOTICE\" ANY ACTIVITY, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY SURPRISING 
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE MILITARY SCHOOL -- MIDDLE-CLASS 
AND FAR MORE SETTLED THAN THE TRANSIENT NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE 
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.

SUBJECT: FARC KILLS PRIEST, ATTEMPTS TO KIDNAP BISHOP 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON, REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
1. (U) ON OCTOBER 17, TWO ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN SUCRE AND 
CALDAS DEPARTMENTS WERE ASSASSINATED AND THE FARC IS BELIEVED 
TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST ONE OF THE KILLINGS.  THE 
FIRST MURDER TOOK PLACE IN CHALAN, SUCRE.  (NOTE: SUCRE IS IN 
ONE OF THE URIBE ADMINISTRATION\'S \"REHABILITATION ZONES.\" 
END NOTE.)  PARISH PRIEST JOSE LUIS CARDENAS HERNANDEZ WAS 
GUNNED DOWN AS HE WAS LEAVING HIS RESIDENCE.  SUCRE POLICE 
COMMANDER COLONEL NORMAN LEON ARANGO ATTRIBUTED THE CRIME TO 
THE FARC\'S 35TH FRONT, BUT A SPOKESMAN FOR THE GROUP DENIED 
ANY INVOLVEMENT.  THE SECOND KILLING TOOK PLACE IN ANSERMA, 
CALDAS.  FATHER GABRIEL ARIAS POSADA, A 66 YEAR-OLD PRIEST, 
WAS FOUND SHOT TO DEATH ALONG WITH THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE 
THAT WAS TAKING HIM ON A HUMANITARIAN MISSION.  ARIAS HAD 
REPORTEDLY BEEN TRYING TO SECURE THE LIBERATION OF FORMER 
SENATOR ANCIZAR LOPEZ, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED BY THE FARC SIX 
MONTHS AGO.  POPE JOHN PAUL II CHARACTERIZED THE MURDER OF 
THE TWO PRIESTS AS NEW ACTS OF THE UNJUSTIFIED AND WIDESPREAD 
VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA. 
 
2. (U) ON OCTOBER 20, THE COLOMBIAN ARMY FOILED A PLOT BY THE 
FARC TO KIDNAP FRANCISCO JAVIER MUNERA CORREA, THE ROMAN 
CATHOLIC BISHOP OF FLORENCIA, THE CAPITAL OF CAQUETA 
DEPARTMENT.  AFTER THE ARMY LEARNED OF THE PLOT, BISHOP 
MUNERA WAS MOVED TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION FOR SECURITY 
REASONS. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT: THE FARC HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE 
VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST RELIGIOUS FIGURES IN COLOMBIA, 
ESPECIALLY ANYONE WHO HAS SPOKEN OUT AGAINST THE FARC\'S 
NUMEROUS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.  THE ASSASSINATION IN ONE OF 
THE GOVERNMENT\'S \"REHABILITATION ZONES\" MAY HAVE BEEN 
DESIGNED TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT THE FARC IS STILL IN 
CHARGE.  END COMMENT.

1. (U) ON NOVEMBER 11, THE PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN AMERICAN 
BISHOPS CONFERENCE (CELAM) AND BISHOP OF ZIPAQUIRA, JORGE 
ENRIQUE JIMENEZ, WAS KIDNAPPED IN A RURAL AREA NEAR PACHO, 
CUNDINAMARCA.  TWO ARMED MEN KIDNAPPED THE BISHOP ALONG WITH 
A PARISH PRIEST.  THE 60 YEAR-OLD JIMENEZ WAS TRAVELING TO 
SAN ANTONIO DE AGUILERA TO PRESIDE OVER A CONFIRMATION 
CEREMONY.  ARMY 13TH BRIGADE COMMANDER GENERAL CARLOS ALBERTO 
OSPINA ATTRIBUTED THE KIDNAPPING TO THE FARC.  THE FARC\'S 
22ND FRONT OPERATES IN THE AREA WHERE THE BISHOP WAS ABDUCTED. 
 
2. (U) THIS IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF TERRORIST ATTACKS BY 
THE FARC (AS WELL AS THE ELN) AGAINST ROMAN CATHOLIC BISHOPS 
AND PRIESTS.  IN MARCH, THE ARCHBISHOP OF CALI, ISAIAS DUARTE 
CANCINO, WAS ASSASSINATED.  MORE RECENTLY, IN OCTOBER, THE 
FARC GUNNED DOWN A PARISH PRIEST AS HE WAS LEAVING HIS 
RESIDENCE IN CHALAN, SUCRE (REF B). 
 
3. (U) THE FARC HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT A KIDNAPPING CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST RELIGIOUS AND GOVERNMENT FIGURES IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
PRESSURE THE URIBE ADMINISTRATION TO EXCHANGE THEM FOR 
CONVICTED FARC PRISONERS.  NGO\'S AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF KIDNAP 
VICTIMS HAVE FLOATED SEVERAL EXCHANGE PROPOSALS.  WILLIAM 
VELEZ, PRESIDENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ALSO HAS A 
PROPOSAL FOR A ONE-TIME EXCHANGE.  THE FARC PRISONERS WOULD 
BE SENT TO A THIRD COUNTRY AND NOT BE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO 
COLOMBIA. 
 
4. (U) COMMENT: BY FOCUSING ON ELITE RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL 
LEADERS, THE FARC IS TRYING TO INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON THE 
GOVERNMENT.  THERE HAVE BEEN INDICATIONS IN THE PRESS THAT 
THE URIBE ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING THE VELEZ PROPOSAL 
(REF A).  END COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, CO 
SUBJECT: COLOMBIA: 2001 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 201772 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. THIS IS POST\'S RESPONSE TO REFTEL REQUEST FOR INPUT ON THE 
2001 TERRORISM REPORT FOR COLOMBIA.  AFTER MORE THAN 50 YEARS 
OF FIGHTING AMONG GOVERNMENT TROOPS, GUERRILLAS AND 
PARAMILITARIES, COLOMBIANS ARE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THE 
SCOURGE OF TERRORISM.  TWO COLOMBIAN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS 
(THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA OR FARC, AND THE 
NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY OR ELN) HAVE BEEN ON THE FOREIGN 
TERRORIST LIST SINCE 1997.  IN 2001, THE USG ADDED A THIRD, 
THE UNITED SELF-DEFENSE FORCES OF COLOMBIA OR AUC.  THE GOC 
IS A WILLING AND COOPERATIVE PARTNER IN THE GLOBAL FIGHT 
AGAINST TERRORISM.  IN ADDITION, THE GOC IS RESPONSIVE TO 
INDIVIDUAL USG REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION AND STATEMENTS OF 
SUPPORT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. THE FOLLOWING ADDRESSES REFTEL\'S SPECIFIC QUESTIONS: 
 
A. THE GOC HAS BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE IN BLOCKING TERRORIST 
ASSETS.  IN 2001, THE GOC CREATED THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
AND ANALYSIS UNIT (UIAF), SIMILAR IN FUNCTION TO THE U.S. 
FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT UNIT (FINCEN).  UIAF HEAD 
RODOLFO URIBE COLLABORATES CLOSELY WITH EMBASSY\'S OFAC OFFICE. 
 
B. NO INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTS TOOK PLACE ON COLOMBIAN 
SOIL DURING 2002.  COLOMBIA\'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM RESPONDED 
ADEQUATELY TO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM, 
CONSIDERING LACK OF FUNDING AND PERSONNEL, AND GIVEN SPECIFIC 
FARC THREATS AGAINST PROSECUTORS. 
 
C. THE GOC IS VERY RESPONSIVE TO U.S. REQUESTS FOR 
EXTRADITION.  AS OF DECEMBER 6, THE GOC HAS EXTRADITED 29 
COLOMBIAN CITIZENS TO THE U.S. DURING 2002, WITH 26 
ADDITIONAL CASES PENDING. 
 
D. THE GOC IS HAMPERED IN ITS EFFORTS TO PROSECUTE AND/OR 
EXTRADITE TERRORISTS (MAINLY NARCOTRAFFICKERS) BY BUDGETARY 
CONSTRAINTS AND SPECIFIC FARC THREATS AGAINST PROSECUTORS. 
GOC EFFORTS IN THE FACE OF THESE OBSTACLES ARE IMPRESSIVE. 
 
E. COLOMBIAN ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES 
CONTINUOUSLY AND PUBLICLY MAKE STATEMENTS DEPLORING TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS WITHIN COLOMBIA. 
 
F. THE GOC FOCUSES ITS COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS INTERNALLY. 
 
G. THE GOC DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORISTS POLITICALLY OR 
FINANCIALLY. 
 
H. THE GOC HAS NOT MADE ANY STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY. 
 
I. THE INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT ALVARO URIBE ON AUGUST 7, 
2002 SET THE TONE FOR AN INCREASED GOC WAR ON DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM.  URIBE HAS PROPOSED PENSION AND LABOR REFORMS AND 
HAS IMPOSED A GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAM AS WELL AS A 
ONE-TIME \"WEALTH TAX\" TO BETTER FUND THE WAR.  THE GOC\'S GOAL 
IS TO INCREASE GOVERNMENT DEFENSE SPENDING FROM 3.2 PERCENT 
OF GDP TO MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT. 
 
J. THE USG AND GOC ARE WORKING COOPERATIVELY TO ATTACK 
FUNDING FOR NARCOTRAFFICKING AND ASSOCIATED TERRORISM THROUGH 
PLAN COLOMBIA.  SPECIFICALLY, EMBASSY\'S OFAC OFFICE 
COORDINATES WITH THE GOC FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS 
UNIT (UIAF) TO TARGET TERRORIST FINANCING. 
 
K. IN 1999, FARC INSURGENTS CAPTURED AND THEN KILLED THREE 
U.S. CITIZEN PEACE ACTIVISTS.  OF THE SIX FARC ACTORS 
INDICTED, ONE HAS BEEN CAPTURED.  THREE OTHER FARC MEMBERS 
NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL INDICTMENT WERE ARRESTED IN 
NOVEMBER 2002 IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDERS.  THE USG 
CONTINUES TO PUSH FOR RESOLUTION OF THESE CRIMES; HOWEVER, 
THE GOC HAS GENERALLY BEEN COOPERATIVE. 
 
L. THE GOC HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN RESPONSIVE TO USG REQUESTS 
TO RAMP UP SECURITY AT THE EMBASSY COMPOUND AND OTHER USG 
INTERESTS FOLLOWING FARC THREATS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. IN GENERAL, THE GOC IS SUPPORTIVE OF USG EFFORTS TO COMBAT 
TERRORIST ACTS AND TARGET TERRORIST FINANCES.  THE URIBE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS GIVEN EVERY SIGN THAT OUR COOPERATION WILL 
ONLY INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.

SUBJECT: MASS GRAVE SITE DISCOVERED IN CAQUETA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON.  REASON 1.5 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: THE HUMAN RIGHTS UNIT OF THE PROSECUTOR 
GENERAL\'S OFFICE IS INVESTIGATING THE DISCOVERY OF WHAT ARE 
BELIEVED TO BE THE GRAVES OF OVER 100 VICTIMS OF PARAMILITARY 
ATROCITIES IN CAQUETA DEPARTMENT.  THE VICTIMS ARE BELIEVED 
TO BE ALLEGED FARC SYMPATHIZERS WHO WERE TORTURED AND 
EXECUTED BETWEEN ONE AND TWO YEARS AGO.  TWO PARAMILITARIES 
SUSPECTED OF RESPONSIBILITY IN THE CRIMES ARE IN CUSTODY, AND 
AN ARREST WARRANT IS OUTSTANDING FOR A THIRD.  POLOFF AND DOJ 
REPRESENTATIVES WILL MEET WITH THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR IN THE 
CASEIN NEIVA ON JANUARY 16.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) ON JANUARY 7, OFFICIALS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS UNIT OF 
THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL\'S OFFICE (FISCALIA) TOLD EMBOFFS THAT 
INTELLIGENCE GATHERED BY ITS CORPS OF TECHNICAL INVESTIGATORS 
(CTI) HAD LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF AT LEAST 36 SHALLOW GRAVES 
NEAR THE VILLAGE OF PUERTO TORRES, IN SOUTHWESTERN CAQUETA 
DEPARTMENT.  A TEAM OF FORENSIC INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS 
SPENT TWO WEEKS EXHUMING BODIES AND STUDYING THE SITE, 
LOCATED IN ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OF CAQUETA CONTROLLED BY 
PARAMILITARIES.  COLOMBIAN MEDIA HAVE SINCE REPORTED THE 
EXISTENCE OF THE GRAVE SITE AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF 
PARAMILITARY INVOLVEMENT, BUT THEY SEEMINGLY HAVE NO DETAILS. 
 
3. (C) THE INVESTIGATION IS BEING DIRECTED BY THE NEIVA 
BRANCH OF THE FISCALIA\'S NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS UNITS, A 
SATELLITE OFFICE ESTABLISHED WITH USG FUNDS.  USG MONEY ALSO 
PURCHASED MUCH OF THE EQUIPMENT USED IN THE EXHUMATIONS AND 
FORENSIC ANALYSES CONDUCTED SO FAR.  (COMMENT: THIS IS YET 
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE HIGH-PROFILE INVESTIGATIONS UNDERTAKEN 
BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS UNIT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF DIRECTOR 
ELBA BEATRIZ SILVA.  END COMMENT.) 
 
4. (C) THE EMBASSY\'S LONG-STANDING, COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS UNIT ALLOWED POST TO RECEIVE A 
PRELIMINARY WRITTEN REPORT ON THE CASE, ACCOMPANIED BY 
PHOTOGRAPHS DOCUMENTING THE ON-SITE EXHUMATIONS.  THE DETAILS 
OF THE INVESTIGATION REMAIN HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL AND HAVE NOT 
BEEN RELEASED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR FEAR OF COMPROMISING 
INVESTIGATIVE LEADS. 
 
5. (S) ACCORDING TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS UNIT\'S REPORT, IN 
OCTOBER CONFESSED PARAMILITARY EFREN MARTINEZ INFORMED AGENTS 
OF THE FISCALIA\'S CORPS OF TECHNICAL INVESTIGATORS (CTI) OF 
THE EXISTENCE OF AN IMPROVISED GRAVEYARD IN SOUTHWESTERN 
CAQUETA WHERE THE BODIES OF MORE THAN 100 PARAMILITARY 
VICTIMS WERE BURIED.  BASED ON MARTINEZ\'S CONFESSION, ON 
OCTOBER 16 A GROUP OF 25 CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE SPECIALISTS 
AND PROSECUTORS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY CONVERGED ON THE 
SMALL VILLAGE OF PUERTO TORRES, MUNICIPALITY OF BELEN DE LOS 
ANDAQUIES.  ONE HUNDRED RANDOM TEST PITS EXCAVATED AT THE 
SITE REVEALED 36 BODIES, 33 MEN AND THREE WOMEN, IN VARIED 
STAGES OF ADVANCED DECOMPOSITION.  AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT 
THE VICTIMS WERE KILLED BETWEEN ONE AND TWO YEARS AGO.  THE 
LIMBS OF MOST WERE BOUND WITH BALING WIRE, MOST HAD BEEN 
DECAPITATED AND DISMEMBERED, AND MANY SHOWED SIGNS OF 
PROLONGED TORTURE.  LOGS AND TREES, SCARRED WITH BULLET HOLES 
AND DEEP MACHETE MARKS, WERE CLEARLY SITES OF MULTIPLE 
EXECUTIONS.  INVESTIGATORS REMAINED AT THE SITE UNTIL OCTOBER 
30, WHEN A PRECARIOUS SECURITY SITUATION FORCED THEIR 
PREMATURE DEPARTURE. 
 
6. (S) CONFESSED PARAMILITARY MARTINEZ AND FORMER ARMY 
CAPTAIN EVERARDO BOLANOS, ALLEGEDLY SECOND-IN-COMMAND OF THE 
REGIONAL PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION, ARE IN CUSTODY UNDER 
PRE-TRIAL DETENTION ORDERS LINKING THEM TO THE CRIMES.  AN 
ARREST WARRANT ISSUED ON NOVEMBER 19 IS OUTSTANDING FOR 
FORMER ARMY SERGEANT NEVARDO ANTONIO MILLAN, THE ALLEGED 
COMMANDER OF THE CAQUETA PARAMILITARIES APPARENTLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ATROCITIES. 
 
7.  (C) RATHER THAN VICTIMS OF A SINGLE MASSACRE, THE DEAD 
ARE PRESUMED TO BE ALLEGED FARC SUPPORTERS WHO DISAPPEARED 
INDIVIDUALLY OR IN SMALL GROUPS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. 
FORENSIC EXPERTS ARE ATTEMPTING TO IDENTIFY THE VICTIMS\' 
IDENTITIES THROUGH DNA ANALYSIS.  POLOFF AND DOJ 
REPRESENTATIVES WILL TRAVEL TO NEIVA ON JANUARY 16 TO MEET 
WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS UNIT\'S LEAD INVESTIGATOR IN THE CASE. 
PROSECUTORS EXPECT TO CONTINUE THEIR ON-SITE INVESTIGATION 
WHEN THE AREA IS FULLY SECURED.  POST WILL ATTEMPT TO VISIT 
THE SITE AS SOON AS SECURITY CONDITIONS PERMIT.

TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PTER, CO 
SUBJECT: FARC KIDNAPS CIVILIANS FOR CAR BOMB ATTACKS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON, REASONS 1.5(B)(D) 
 
1. (U) IN ITS LATEST WAVE OF CAR BOMB ATTACKS IN ARAUCA, THE 
FARC REPORTEDLY HAS BEEN KIDNAPPING CIVILIANS AND USING THEM 
AS UNWITTING SUICIDE DRIVERS OF CARS LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES. 
ONCE THE CARS REACH THEIR TARGET, THE EXPLOSIVES ARE 
DETONATED VIA REMOTE CONTROL.  SINCE JANUARY 8, THERE HAVE 
BEEN THREE SUCH ATTACKS BY THE FARC IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT.  IN 
TWO OF THESE ATTACKS, THE FARC KIDNAPPED THREE BROTHERS AND 
FORCED TWO OF THEM TO DRIVE THE CARS.  THE BROTHERS WERE TOLD 
THEY WOULD BE SET FREE IF THEY WOULD DRIVE A CAR ON AN ERRAND 
FOR THE FARC.  IN ONE OF THE INCIDENTS, ONE OF THE BROTHERS 
SURVIVED THE EXPLOSION TO TELL THE AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE 
FARC\'S NEW TACTIC.  PARTS OF ARAUCA CONSTITUTE ONE OF THE 
GOC\'S TWO REHABILITATION ZONES AND THE DEPARTMENT IS THE 
CENTER OF COLOMBIA\'S OIL PRODUCTION.  THE BOMBINGS HAVE TAKEN 
PLACE IN THE VILLAGES OF ARAUQUITA, TAME, AND NEAR FORTUL. 
 
2. (U) MINISTER OF DEFENSE MARTHA LUCIA RAMIREZ ANNOUNCED ON 
JANUARY 14 THAT THE GOC WOULD DENOUNCE THE FARC\'S USE OF 
HOSTAGES IN THE CAR BOMB ATTACKS BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS IN 
GENEVA.  THE DECISION TO BRING THESE CASES TO THE UN WAS 
TAKEN AFTER A SPECIAL SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING ON JANUARY 13 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT URIBE AND MILITARY OFFICIALS. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT: DETONATING CAR BOMBS AND KIDNAPPING CIVILIANS 
ARE NOTHING NEW FOR THE FARC.  IT HAS USED CAR BOMBS FOR 
ATTACKS IN ARAUCA, BOGOTA AND ELSEWHERE IN COLOMBIA AND HAS 
KIDNAPPED HUNDREDS OF CIVILIANS FOR RANSOM AND TO PRESSURE 
THE GOC TO RELEASE FARC MEMBERS IN JAIL.  THE THREE MOST 
RECENT ARAUCA CAR BOMBINGS REPRESENT THE FIRST TIME THAT THE 
FARC HAS USED, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, UNSUSPECTING KIDNAP VICTIMS 
TO BE AGENTS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS.  LAST YEAR, THE FARC 
MURDERED A CIVILIAN AND LEFT HIM IN HIS BOOBY-TRAPPED CAR 
WHICH DETONATED WHEN THE AUTHORITIES ARRIVED.  WITH THE WIDE 
MEDIA COVERAGE OF THESE ATTACKS, THIS NEW TACTIC WILL HAVE 
LIMITED UTILITY, SINCE KIDNAP VICTIMS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE AS 
COOPERATIVE AS DRIVERS IF THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE FACING 
NEAR-CERTAIN DEATH.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: FARC KILLS TWO HIGH PROFILE HOSTAGES 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMB. ANNE W. PATTERSON FOR REASONS 1.5(B,D) 
 
1. (S) ON MAY 5, THE FARC EXECUTED TWO HIGH PROFILE HOSTAGES- 
ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR GUILLERMO GAVIRIA AND FORMER DEFENSE 
MINISTER AND PEACE ADVISER GILBERTO ECHEVERRI- IN AN AREA 
NEAR URRAO, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT.  EIGHT SOLDIERS WHO THE 
FARC ALSO HAD KIDNAPPED WERE KILLED AS WELL.  SOURCES 
INDICATE THAT THE MURDERS TOOK PLACE DURING AN ILL-FATED 
RESCUE ATTEMPT BY A COLOMBIAN SPECIAL FORCES UNIT. THE FARC 
DISCOVERED THE ATTEMPTED RESCUE AND A FIREFIGHT ENSUED. 
DURING THIS ENCOUNTER, THE FARC ALLEGEDLY EXECUTED THE 
PRISONERS WITH SHOTS TO THE HEAD. 
 
2. (S) THE FARC RELEASED A STATEMENT THAT CONFIRMED THE 
DEATHS OF GAVIRIA AND ECHEVERRI, ALONG WITH THE MILITARY 
HOSTAGES, AND ATTRIBUTED THE FATALITIES TO A FAILED RESCUE 
ATTEMPT ORCHESTRATED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT.  GAVIRIA 
AND ECHEVERRI HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY THE FARC ON APRIL 21, 
2002 WHILE PARTICIPATING IN A PEACE MARCH IN CAICEDO, 
ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT. 
 
3.(U) THE 41-YEAR-OLD GAVIRIA, SON OF A PROMINENT MEDELLIN 
FAMILY THAT OWNED THE INFLUENTIAL EL MUNDO NEWSPAPER, ENTERED 
OFFICE AS GOVERNOR OF ANTIOQUIA IN JANUARY, 2001. HE WAS THE 
SOLE CANDIDATE OF THE LIBERAL PARTY DURING THAT CAMPAIGN. 
PREVIOUSLY, HE HAD WORKED AS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL 
INSTITUTE OF ROADS OF COLOMBIA FROM 1994 UNTIL 1999.  HE 
ATTENDED THE COLORADO SCHOOL OF MINES WHERE HE GRADUATED WITH 
A DEGREE IN ENGINEERING AND MINING ADMINISTRATION. 
 
4. (U) THE 69-YEAR-OLD ECHEVERRI, FORMER MINISTER OF DEFENSE 
DURING THE SAMPER ADMINISTRATION, WORKED AS THE PEACE 
COMMISSIONER FOR ANTIOQUIA.  THE MEDELLIN NATIVE HAD HELD THE 
GOVERNORSHIP OF ANTIOQUIA FROM 1990-91.  FOLLOWING THIS, HE 
REENTERED THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS PRESIDENT OF THE CELLULAR 
TELEPHONE COMPANY, OCCEL. 
 
5. (C)  COMMENT:  THE ASSASSINATION OF GAVIRIA AND ECHEVERRI, 
BOTH POPULAR POLITICIANS, BY THE FARC WILL STUN COLOMBIANS. 
GAVIRIA AND ECHEVERRI WERE THE FARC\'S TWO MOST IMPORTANT 
BARGAINING CHIPS WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN SECURING AN EXCHANGE 
OF HOSTAGES FOR FARC PRISONERS.  WE EXPECT THAT URIBE WILL 
ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOTCHED RESCUE ATTEMPT.  URIBE 
WILL NOW FIND HIMSELF UNDER EVEN MORE INTENSE PRESSURE TO 
NEGOTIATE A HOSTAGE EXCHANGE WITH THE FARC AND FOREGO FUTURE 
RESCUE ATTEMPTS.  URIBE WILL RESIST THIS PRESSURE TO 
NEGOTIATE A HOSTAGE EXCHANGE; HOWEVER, HE MAY SHY AWAY FROM 
APPROVING ANY RESCUE EFFORTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  AS FOR THE 
FARC, ITS TERRORIST INSTINCTS HAVE ONCE AGAIN FORFEITED ANY 
SUCCESS AT GAINING SOME POSITIVE POLITICAL TRACTION ON THE 
HOSTAGE ISSUE.  EMBASSY IS CERTAIN THAT WE CAN DETERMINE THE 
EXACT FACTS OF THE RESCUE IN A FEW DAYS, AND WE WILL ADVISE 
THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: TOP FARC COMMANDER KILLED BY COLOMBIAN ARMY 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR WILLIAM B. WOOD FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
 
1.  (S) SUMMARY: ON OCTOBER 19, THE COLOMBIAN ARMY KILLED 
EDGAR NAVARRO, ALIAS \"MOCHO,\" DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE FARC\'S 
TEOFILO FORERO MOBILE COLUMN (TFMC), ONE OF THE FARC\'S MOST 
ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE UNITS.  THE OPERATION TO CAPTURE 
NAVARRO, WHICH ENDED WITH HIS DEATH, WAS BASED ON EFFECTIVE 
USE OF TECHNICAL AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.  NAVARRO\'S DEATH IS 
A MAJOR SYMBOLIC AND TACTICAL VICTORY FOR THE GOC.  NAVARRO 
PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE FEBRUARY KIDNAPPING OF THREE U.S. 
CITIZEN CONTRACTORS AND MURDER OF A FOURTH, AND WAS WANTED BY 
GOC JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES ON NUMEROUS CHARGES OF KIDNAPPING, 
MURDER, AND TERRORISM.  HIS LOSS IS A MAJOR BLOW TO THE TFMC. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (S) FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS, THE COLOMBIAN ARMY\'S 
ANTI-KIDNAPPING UNIT (GAULA) AND THE NATIONAL POLICE IN HUILA 
DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN COLLECTING TECHNICAL AND HUMAN 
INTELLIGENCE AGAINST THE FARC\'S TFMC\'S DEPUTY COMMANDER EDGAR 
NAVARRO, ALIAS \"MOCHO.\"  ON OCTOBER 19, THE GAULA USED THIS 
ACCUMULATED INTELLIGENCE TO LAUNCH AN OPERATION TO CAPTURE 
AND ARREST HIM.  DURING THE OPERATION, NAVARRO\'S SECURITY 
DETAIL OPENED FIRE, SPARKING A FIREFIGHT THAT KILLED NAVARRO 
AND TEN OF HIS MEN.  TWO CIVILIANS WERE INJURED IN THE 
CROSSFIRE. 
 
3. (S) NAVARRO\'S DEATH IS A MAJOR SYMBOLIC AND TACTICAL 
VICTORY FOR THE GOC.  THE TFMC IS AMONG THE FARC\'S MOST 
ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE ELEMENTS, OPERATING AS THE ROUGH 
EQUIVALENT OF A SPECIAL FORCES UNIT.  NAVARRO HAS PLAYED A 
KEY ROLE IN NUMEROUS KIDNAPPINGS, MURDERS, AND TERRORIST 
ATTACKS, INCLUDING A MASS KIDNAPPING AT A LUXURY APARTMENT 
COMPLEX IN 2001, A COMMERCIAL AIRLINER HIJACKING, AND THE 
DETONATION OF A \"HOUSE BOMB\" IN FEBRUARY 2003 IN NEIVA, 
CAPITAL OF HUILA DEPARTMENT.  NAVARRO MAY HAVE PARTICIPATED 
IN THE FEBRUARY 2003 KIDNAPPING OF THREE U.S. CITIZEN 
CONTRACTORS AND THE MURDER OF A FOURTH, AND IS KNOWN TO HAVE 
BEEN IN CONTROL OF THE HOSTAGES FOR OVER A MONTH BETWEEN 
FEBRUARY AND MARCH.  AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH, NAVARRO WAS IN 
POSSESSION OF ONE OF THE HOSTAGE\'S FIREARMS.  HIS DEATH IS A 
SERIOUS SETBACK FOR THE TFMC.  IT WILL HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME 
REPLACING NAVARRO, ESPECIALLY AS THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE 
ARRESTED SEVERAL OF HIS KEY ASSOCIATES. 
 
4. (S) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH NAVARRO WAS NOT A SENIOR FARC 
COMMANDER BY RANK, HIS INFLUENCE AND PROMINENT ROLE IN MAJOR 
TERRORIST OPERATIONS MADE HIM ONE OF THE HIGHEST VALUE 
TARGETS OF THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES.  THE OPERATION 
DEMONSTRATED EFFECTIVE USE OF ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE AND 
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND POLICE.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. Colombia continues its struggle against the country\'s 
three main terrorist organizations ) the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN) 
and the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) -- all 
of which have been designated by the U.S. as Foreign 
Terrorist Organizations.  Although there were no reports of 
international terrorist acts in Colombia during 2003, there 
were and continue to be persistent actions by guerrilla 
groups endangering U.S. and Colombian government personnel 
and assets, and targeting congested public areas such as 
shopping malls, parks, and popular restaurants. 
 
The Government of Colombia does not support terrorists 
politically or financially; to the contrary, the Uribe 
administration continues to take a tough stance against 
terrorism. In 2003, President Uribe has increased military 
pressure on illegal armed groups and pushed forward an 
ambitious security agenda, which: 1) secured congressional 
passage of anti-terrorism legislation; 2) strengthened 
programs promoting the desertion and reintegration of illegal 
armed group members; and 3) engaged the GOC in demobilization 
negotiations with the AUC. The latter process has led to a 
recent mass demobilization of 855 paramilitaries in Medellin 
and another 155 in Cauca; another is planned for early 2004. 
End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Terrorist Organizations Continue to Attack 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. In February, the country\'s largest terrorist organization 
(the approximately 16,000-member FARC) set off a major 
car bomb attack on Bogota\'s Club El Nogal. The bombing killed 
34 and wounded over 160. One week later near Florencia, 
Caqueta Department, the FARC captured three U.S. contractors 
and killed another American and a Colombian - all crew 
members of a crashed U.S. aircraft; the three Americans 
continue to be held hostage. The FARC struck again on 
February 15 when a house bomb detonated in Neiva, Huila 
Department, killing sixteen and wounding over forty.  In 
September, the ELN kidnapped eight foreign tourists visiting 
archeological ruins in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. One 
escaped, two were released in November 2003, but five remain 
captive at year\'s end. 
 
In October, November, and December 2003, the FARC set off a 
car bomb in San Andresito, an area of Bogota where contraband 
electronics are commonly sold and where the FARC and the AUC 
are known to extort shop owners and compete for turf, 
launched a rocket at a prominent Colombian business leader, 
fired another rocket at the military side of Bogota\'s 
international commercial airport, and tossed grenades at two 
restaurants frequented by Americans and other foreigners. 
Numerous other attacks have been thwarted in Bogota, due in 
large part to intelligence work performed by Colombian public 
security forces. 
 
Reflecting increased high level attention and funding, the 
GOC\'s ambitious security agenda has produced substantial 
achievements. In 2003, murders have decreased by sixteen 
percent, assassinations of trade unionists are down 
sixty-eight percent and kidnappings have been reduced by 
thirty percent from 2002. The Colombian military has 
completed phase 2A of its \"Plan Patriota\" national defense 
plan in the Cundinamarca area surrounding Bogota, which 
reaped significant successes, including the killing of at 
least five mid-level FARC commanders who operated in the area. 
 
3. The following addresses ref A\'s specific questions: 
 
a. The GOC has taken the following actions in 2003 to support 
the global coalition against terrorism: 
 
-- The GOC continues to cooperate in blocking terrorist 
assets.  The Financial Information and Analysis Unit (UIAF), 
 
similar in function to the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Unit (FINCEN), was created in 2001. UIAF collaborates closely 
with the Embassy\'s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); 
 
-- President Uribe will have met his goal of installing a 
state security presence in every one of the country\'s 1098 
municipalities by the end of 2003. This has been a major 
accomplishment toward reclaiming territory from terrorist 
organizations; 
 
-- President Uribe has submitted to Congress two important 
draft laws with significant public security implications: 1) 
the anti-terrorism bill; and 2) the conditional parole bill 
(ref B). The anti-terrorism bill, which was approved by 
Congress December 10, will increase the government\'s 
authority to conduct wiretaps, residential searches, and 
detentions.  The conditional parole legislation is connected 
to the broader peace process, and provides the GOC with 
flexibility to waive prison sentences for combatants who 
agree to demobilize and support the GOC\'s anti-terrorism 
efforts; 
 
-- With USG assistance, the GOC expects to encourage this 
year upwards of 4000 illegal combatants to desert ) an 
increase of 84 percent from 2002.  The program has yielded 
significant intelligence, which will help in capturing and 
prosecuting other illegal armed group commanders (ref C); 
 
-- On November 25, the GOC demobilized 855 paramilitaries 
from the AUC\'s Cacique Nutibara Bloc. In December, 155 
paramilitaries in Cauca Department were demobilized.  The 
next AUC demobilization is scheduled for early 2004 in 
northern Colombia; 
 
-- The USG\'s Anti-Terrorist Assistance (ATA) programs are 
training Colombian police and military anti-kidnapping units 
(GAULA). Kidnappings are an important means of revenue for 
the illegal armed groups, particularly for the FARC and ELN. 
DSS/ATA is implementing one of the largest USG 
anti-kidnapping assistance programs ($25-million) to help the 
GOC train and equip GAULA units; 
 
-- The GOC is also taking its own steps to strengthen its 
anti-terrorism capabilities.  A newly-improved and expanded 
anti-terrorism unit has been set up in the Prosecutor 
General\'s Office (Fiscalia).  This unit was formally part of 
the narcotics section, but was separated out in 2003.  The 
GOC has assigned additional prosecutors to the anti-terrorism 
unit to focus on prosecuting infrastructure attacks, 
particularly in oil producing areas such as Arauca and 
Casanare; and 
 
-- Plan Colombia has made significant strides in combating 
narco-trafficking, a key source of income for terrorist 
organizations. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimates 
that coca cultivation could be reduced by aerial eradication 
by as much as 50 percent this year (almost 130,000 hectares 
eradicated). The GOC sprayed approximately 2700 hectares of 
opium poppy this year.  In August 2003, the U.S. resumed the 
Airbridge Denial Program, which assists the GOC in 
intercepting aircraft trafficking narcotics and arms. 
 
B. The GOC has been particularly cooperative in cases and 
investigations involving Americans, such as the kidnapping of 
the contractors and the recent grenade attack in Bogota. 
 
C. The US-Colombia extradition relationship continues to be 
one of the most successful in the world.  The GOC has 
extradited 136 Colombian citizens to the U.S. since July 
2000, mostly related to narcotics cases. Continued 
cooperation from the GOC\'s Foreign and Justice Ministries has 
led to the extradition of 88 persons during President Uribe\'s 
tenure (through November 14), 64 in the year 2003.  In May 
2003, the GOC approved the extradition of Nelson Vargas 
Rueda, the first FARC member to be sent to the U.S. (Note: 
Vargas Rueda is accused of the 1999 kidnapping and murder of 
three American NGO activists working on behalf of Colombian 
indigenous groups. End Note.) Also extradited in May was 
Gerardo Herrera Iles, accused of taking foreign oil workers 
hostage, including U.S. citizens. 
 
D. There is no impediment to extradition for terrorist acts 
occurring outside of Colombia.  However, for terrorist acts 
that occur in Colombia involving American victims, there 
could be an impediment if the GOC initiates its own 
prosecution before the U.S. submits a request for 
extradition.  The Colombian Code of Criminal Procedure and 
jurisprudence from the Colombian Constitutional Court 
prevents extradition of individuals who have been, or are 
being, prosecuted in Colombia for the same act or acts.  Once 
a case has been opened in Colombia, even if it were later 
dismissed, double jeopardy could prevent the defendant from 
being extradited on those charges.  Accordingly, the U.S. 
recently had to withdraw an extradition request for an 
Ejercito Liberacion Popular (ELP) defendant who was already 
being prosecuted in Colombia for the same act. 
 
E. In addition to prosecution, the GOC has taken several 
other measures to combat terrorism: 
 
-- As in 2002, the GOC continues to speak out forcefully and 
often against terrorist organizations; 
 
-- The GOC continues to improve and expand its Informer 
Network, which trains civilians to assist police in crime 
prevention and alerting law enforcement to illegal armed 
group activity; 
 
-- A U.S. financed Rewards for Justice (RFJ) campaign has 
been initiated for information that leads to the capture, 
arrest, and prosecution of those persons involved in the 
hostage-taking of the three American contractors; and 
 
-- Despite severe national budget constraints, President 
Uribe continues to increase the amount Colombia spends on 
security.  In 2003, the GOC allocated 4.0 percent of GDP to 
security ) up from 3.5 percent in 2002. It hopes to increase 
spending to 4.5 percent by 2006. 
 
F. The GOC has sought to build international condemnation of 
Colombian terrorists.  At the GOC\'s request, the Organization 
of American States (OAS) passed Resolution 837 condemning the 
bombing of El Nogal, specifically naming the FARC as the 
perpetrators.  The GOC also requested and received UNSC 
condemnation of the attack. In mid-2003, the United Kingdom 
hosted a conference in London in which 24 countries voiced 
their commitment to support Colombian democracy and 
disapproval of the illegal armed groups. 
 
G. The GOC has not provided any support for international 
terrorism, terrorists, or terrorist groups. 
 
H. The GOC has not made any statements in support of 
terrorist organizations or terrorist-sponsoring states. 
 
I. Comment: Colombia understands only too well the 
devastation caused by terrorism.  From the day it assumed 
office on August 8, 2002, the Uribe Administration has 
demonstrated a firm resolve in fighting terrorism. The GOC is 
supportive of USG efforts to combat terrorist acts, target 
terrorist finances, and cooperate with extradition requests. 
We expect this highly productive USG-GOC cooperation to 
continue.

SUBJECT: 2003 REVIEW OF THE COLOMBIAN ECONOMY 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: The Colombian economy performed well during 
President Alvaro Uribe\'s first year in office and will end 
2003 on a positive note.  A significant increase in exports 
to the United States helped stabilize an economy constrained 
by the internal armed conflict and challenged by a 
significant decrease in trade with Venezuela, the country\'s 
second largest trading partner.  GOC improvements in security 
and restructuring of inefficient parastatals also helped keep 
the economy on track, despite the failure of President 
Uribe\'s reform referendum.  Various indicators point to a 
healthy economy in 2004, provided there is sustained private 
investment and household consumption.  However, alarming 
social indicators, lingering fiscal problems, and a lack of 
needed reforms may jeopardize future economic growth and 
stability.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
The Colombian Economic Recovery 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The Uribe administration is committed to attracting 
foreign investment by improving the security environment and 
opening Colombia\'s economy through liberal trade regimes and 
free trade agreements.  Uribe\'s first-year performance, 
coupled with the prospects of negotiating for freer trade 
with the United States, has improved business and consumer 
confidence.  The general reaction has been so favorable that 
the first three quarters of 2003, which exhibited broad-based 
growth, were some of the most stable in Colombia\'s history. 
For example, according to the National Administrative 
Department of Statistics (DANE), mining and fuels rose 12.4 
percent year-on-year (led by Colombia\'s two largest exports, 
oil and coal), and construction grew 9.8 percent.  Other 
sectors such as manufacturing, trade and tourism, transport, 
communication, and agriculture grew approximately 4.5 percent 
year-on-year.  During the first half of 2003, the economy 
grew 2.9 percent compared with 1.1 percent growth for the 
same period last year.  The third trimester ended on a high 
note, registering approximately 4.17 percent growth.  The GOC 
expects 3.4 percent growth overall for 2003, and projects 
that increases of 8.5 percent in private investments and 3.2 
percent in household consumption will yield 3.3 percent 
growth for 2004. 
 
3. (U) Consumer spending, imports of capital goods, and home 
purchases continue to fuel the economy.  Several other 
economic indicators point to improvement: 
 
-- According to the National Federation of Businessmen 
(FENALCO), 43 percent of retailers reported an increase in 
sales.  The Banking Association (ASOBANCARIA)  reported that 
credit card sales and advances have risen at a rate of more 
than 20 percent, as have consumer loans in general.  The 
National Association of Industrialists\' (ANDI) most recent 
business poll indicated that the industrial sector recorded 
growth of 2.7 percent in output and sales from January to 
November compared to the same period last year. 
 
-- Domestic spending, which affects both demand for credit 
and the repayment capacity of non-tradable sectors, has 
posted significant increases dating back to the second 
quarter of last year. 
 
-- The GOC raised the minimum wage 7.8 percent to USD 127 per 
month -- the largest real increase in purchasing power of the 
last 12 years.  Approximately four million Colombians, or ten 
percent of the population, earn minimum wage. 
 
-- According to the Colombian Savings and Housing Institute 
(ICAV), foreclosures are down and bank inventories are 
getting smaller. 
 
-- The Agriculture Ministry and the Association of Colombian 
Farmers (SAC) predict that this year agricultural production 
will grow 5 percent, an estimate based on 147,000 new 
hectares that were planted this year, with palm oil, corn, 
cacao, rubber, and rice leading the way.  The most recent 
National Agricultural Poll revealed that agriculture is now 
the third most important sector of the economy, representing 
14.2 percent of the GDP.  (Note: SAC reports that although 
the agricultural sector has been growing during this year, it 
is not profitable.  Despite higher prices and increased crop 
cultivation for the first semester of the year, production 
costs have increased significantly as a result of the 
increased prices of fuel and fertilizers.  End note.) 
 
-- Employment is up.  The DANE reported that the overall 
unemployment rate stands at 14.3 percent. Through the third 
quarter of this year approximately 900,000 new jobs were 
created, representing an increase of 5.7 percent compared to 
the same period in 2002. 
-- For the period between January and September 2003, foreign 
direct investment (FDI) from all countries totaled USD 1.5 
billion.  The stock of U.S. FDI in Colombia through September 
2003 amounted to USD 8 billion. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Exports, Boosted by ATPDEA, Have Led the Way 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Total Colombian exports were eight percent higher than 
last year, despite the halt in exports to Venezuela, 
Colombia\'s second-largest export market.  Exports to the 
United States have more than made up the difference.  The 
U.S. market receives 44 percent of all Colombian exports, 
more than two-thirds of which enter tariff-free.  During 
2003, total Colombian exports to the United States were USD 
5.4 billion.  Colombia exported USD 2.4 billion under the 
Andean Trade Preferences and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA). 
Considering just textiles, more than USD 158 million in 
exports benefited under ATPDEA in 2003, an improvement of 48 
percent over the previous year. 
 
--------------------------- 
Increased Security Pays Off 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Uribe\'s proactive security strategy has delivered 
important results: illegal armed groups have been weakened, 
and terrorist attacks and overall violence have declined. 
These improvements have facilitated increased production. 
Businesses reported in a survey conducted by the Colombian 
Association of Small Industries (ACOPI) that \"lack of 
security\" decreased from representing 13 percent of their 
concerns in 2002 to 5.4 percent in 2003.  This improvement 
has helped businesses to increase use of installed capacity 
to 74.6 percent. 
 
6. (U) Drummond Coal Company is an example of a firm that has 
benefited from improved security: in its 12 years in 
Colombia, the company has been successful in reducing attacks 
on its infrastructure and in broadening local support for its 
extractive operations.  According to Drummond\'s local 
President, Augusto Jimenez, future plans include investing 
approximately USD 1.5 billion over the next five years to 
develop new coal projects, creating almost 7,000 new jobs, 
and exporting more than 30 million tons of coal. 
 
7. (U) Road traffic has also risen as a result of improved 
security.  Alicia Naranjo, Director of the National Roads 
Institute (INVIAS), reported that overall vehicular traffic 
increased 7.3 percent.  The increase in Colombians flocking 
to rural areas during holidays and vacations has stimulated 
new sectors of commerce in regions previously neglected. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Restructuring Inefficient Parastatals Helps Too 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
8. (U) President Uribe also undertook a major effort to cut 
overall government expenditures and restructure inefficient 
parastatal entities, which were operating at unsustainable 
levels and putting significant strain on the economy.  The 
State Petroleum Company (Ecopetrol), Telecom, and the Social 
Security Institute (ISS) were the largest entities affected. 
In an effort to salvage the entities, thousands of unneeded 
employees collecting inflated salaries and benefits were laid 
off.  The enterprises are now compelled to be more efficient 
or destined to disappear in competition with the private 
sector.  Colombian unions responded with strikes, but 
received scant public support.  The GOC estimated it will 
save over USD 9.2 billion, and believes that the changes have 
brought about viability and governability. 
 
-- Ecopetrol: Through decree 1760, the GOC converted 
Ecopetrol, which remains a government-owned enterprise, into 
a corporation that will handle field operations, and created 
the National Hydrocarbons Agency, which will set petroleum 
policy and handle royalties from new contracts.  The 
restructuring did not result in any significant layoffs, 
changes in work contracts or the collective bargaining 
process.  The \"new\" Ecopetrol allows employees to become 
shareholders, who can then appoint a board of directors 
tasked with increasing accountability and fighting 
corruption. 
 
-- Telecom: Telecom was liquidated after operating at 
unsustainable losses for several years.  This decision 
resulted in the firing of 5,260 Telecom employees and 1,651 
employees from associated telecommunications enterprises. 
The GOC created a new State-owned institution, Colombia 
Telecomunicaciones, which permits the State to continue 
providing service throughout the country, particularly in 750 
areas where Telecom will be the sole provider. 
 
-- Social Security: Presidential decree 1750 will split the 
ISS, the largest government enterprise, into one insurer and 
seven State Social Enterprises (ESE).  The new ESEs, which 
will be administratively autonomous with their own budgets, 
will provide health services while the ISS will manage 
pensions, worker\'s compensation, and social security. 
Uribe\'s reform is long overdue, given that ISS is fast 
exhausting its reserves, forcing the government to come up 
with USD 596 million (1.7 trillion Colombian pesos) to pay 
for benefits. 
 
----------------------------- 
As Does Sound Monetary Policy 
----------------------------- 
 
9. (U) The GOC strategy of keeping interest rates low and 
maintaining a competitive exchange rate has spurred economic 
recovery.  In the first semester of 2003, interest rates 
remained low, allowing for recovery of credit.  Furthermore, 
in response to inflationary pressures, the Central Bank 
increased intervention rates twice, and held two actions of 
international reserves for USD 200 million each.  As a 
result, interest rates have risen slightly, and foreign 
exchange rates have stabilized.  The 2003 target rate for 
inflation is 6 percent, although inflation stood at 6.5 
percent as of December 2003.  The 2004 target rate is 5.5 
percent. 
 
10. (U) Near-term fiscal finances are under control.  The 
consolidated public sector deficits in 2003 and 2004 should 
be just slightly above the 2.8 and 2.5 percent of GDP deficit 
targets.  The GOC has offset the shortfall resulting from the 
referendum\'s defeat by raising taxes, reallocating transfers 
to regional governments, and by cutting investment spending. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Moving on After the Referendum Defeat 
------------------------------------- 
 
11. (SBU) The GOC promoted a referendum to reform 
constitutional norms that have impeded important spending 
cuts.  Although voter turnout was just short of the 25 
percent threshold required for approval, voters 
overwhelmingly supported the reform agenda.  The referendum\'s 
failure does not appear to have hurt private confidence, 
which remains strong due to important gains on the security 
front.  The popularity of President Uribe remains in the high 
70s. 
 
12. (U) In order to make up for the loss of several 
cost-cutting measures in the referendum, the Uribe 
administration introduced new economic austerity legislation 
that faced opposition in Congress.  Changes to the VAT and 
income tax regimes, which were at the heart of Uribe\'s tax 
reform proposal, were severely watered-down.  The tax bill, 
which passed in an extraordinary congressional session, 
provides USD 817 million, but leaves a USD 286 million gap to 
be bridged by spending cuts.  Measures include taxes on 
wealth, personal income, financial transactions, anti-evasion 
policies, and an expansion of the tax base. 
 
13. (U) The GOC has loan commitments from international 
financial institutions (IFIs) of USD 7.2 billion for the 
2004-2005 period, including USD 2 billion in contingent 
credit from the IMF.  Many of these loans require continued 
structural reforms, further strengthening the link between 
the Uribe administration\'s ability to carry out reform and a 
healthy economy.  Pending reforms include a reform to the 
budget code, a third-generation reform to social security, 
and second-generation reform to inter-governmental 
(territorial) transfer arrangements. 
 
----------------------------------- 
There is Still Room for Improvement 
----------------------------------- 
 
14. (SBU) The National Council for Economic and Social Policy 
(CONPES) reported that economic growth for 2004 would rest on 
sectors such as construction, industry, transportation, and 
finance.  Although the economic environment is generally 
positive, Uribe still faces considerable challenges. 
 
15. (SBU) The gaping budget shortfall is the most pressing. 
Many Colombians have spoken out against the reform efforts. 
On the one hand, critics feel that legislation passed so far 
is only a temporary bandage masking the need for substantial 
reform.  On the other hand, some in the business community 
expressed fear that a cascade of new taxes and other fiscal 
belt-tightening could adversely affect consumption and 
investment and undermine the nascent economic recovery.  The 
GOC has proposed a USD 28 billion budget for 2004.  Due to 
the fiscal crisis, public spending will have little influence 
on jump starting the economy.  The GOC may use a modest 
amount of reserves for liability management operations in 
2004, which, at the margin, could support bond prices. 
 
16. (SBU) Debt continues to be a problem.  Comptroller 
General Antonio Hernandez stated in a report to congress that 
the GOC\'s debt level compromises the economy\'s external 
sustainability.  Worse yet, projections to 2006 show a more 
marked vulnerability.  Hernandez predicted a balance of 
payments crisis in the future unless the government takes 
corrective action.  He reported the non-financial public 
sector\'s net debt last year stood at 51.5 percent of GDP (USD 
39 billion), or 7.5 percent higher than 2002.  Foreign debt 
accounts for 48.2 percent of this total.  (Note: Analysts who 
evaluate the actual cost of foreign debt suggest that the 
government should resort to borrowing from multinational 
banks to a greater extent and start minimizing costly 
financing avenues such as issuance of foreign bonds. 
Increasing reliance on the latter has led to the adoption of 
new ways to finance infrastructure projects -- concessions, 
joint venture contracts, and power purchasing agreements -- 
that have become financially onerous for the nation.  End 
note.) 
 
17. (SBU) Social indicators continue to alarm.  Faster 
population growth and a devalued peso contributed to a fall 
in the dollar value of per capita GDP from USD 2,110 in 2001 
to USD 1,852 in 2003.  The percentage of the population 
living in poverty remains at 60 percent, extreme poverty 
exceeds 35 percent, and the underemployed represent 34 
percent of the labor force.  Though unemployment has declined 
in the past two years, it remains relatively high and is one 
of the factors weighing on domestic sentiment.  The plight of 
1.5 million jobless Colombians in the country\'s 13 largest 
metropolitan areas is dramatic.  This worries Uribe as well 
as private sector leaders, who insist on the urgent need to 
adopt \"shock\" measures to deal with unemployment. 
 
------------------- 
Outlook for 2004... 
------------------- 
18. (SBU) Comment: The outlook for the near future is 
promising, but some key questions must be answered if 
economic growth at relatively high levels is to be sustained: 
-- Can the GOC stem the growth of the international debt? 
The corollary question of whether the GOC can tame its fiscal 
deficit must also be answered affirmatively. 
 
-- Can the fiscal deficit be brought under control in what is 
effectively a wartime budget without reducing security or 
social expenditures below politically acceptable minimums? 
 
-- Will Colombia\'s export prices hold and will the U.S. 
economy continue to be a strong market for Colombian exports? 
 
-- Will the opposition to Uribe continue to support sound 
economic policy for the latter part of his term? 
 
If the answers to the above questions are affirmative, 
Colombia\'s near and medium-term prospects are bright.  End 
comment.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On January 2, Ecuadorian authorities arrested Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) commander Ricardo Ovidio Palmera Pineda 
alias \"Simon Trinidad.\"  He is now in Colombia, where he faces over 50 
counts of terrorism and other serious crimes.  Palmera, who played a ke 
role in managing FARC finances and is implicated in several high-profil 
terrorist incidents, is the highest-ranking FARC commander ever to be 
captured. His capture is a major political victory for President Uribe 
and demonstrates the importance of effective security cooperation 
between Colombia and its neighbors.  The GOC would like to extradite 
Palmera to the U.S.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Ecuador-Colombian Cooperation 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) On January 2, Ecuadorian authorities arrested Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) commander Ricardo Ovidio Palmera Pineda 
alias \"Simon Trinidad,\" in a popular tourist district of Quito.  Palmer 
was allegedly in Quito to receive treatment for prostate cancer.  The 
Ecuadorian National Police (ENP) had been tracking his movements for 
several weeks.  After appearing before an Ecuadorian judge, Palmera was 
turned over to Colombian authorities and transported to Bogota, where 
he faces a total of 59 charges of terrorism, kidnapping, and drug 
trafficking.  The GOC was fully aware of the Ecuadorian operation and, 
prior to the arrest, provided Ecuadorian officials with a positive 
identification of Palmera.  Contrary to press reports, an informant did 
not provide Colombian military authorities with information on 
Palmera\'s whereabouts; the ENP planned most of the operation 
independently of Colombian authorities. 
 
------------------------ 
Who is \"Simon Trinidad\"? 
------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Palmera, more commonly known as \"Simon Trinidad,\" is the most 
senior FARC commander ever captured.  Although not a member of the 
seven-member FARC Secretariat, Palmera was an influential member of the 
FARC\'s General Staff (\"Estado Mayor\"), a decision-making body ranking 
directly below the Secretariat that administers most of the FARC\'s 
political, strategic, and operational activities.  Palmera -- who holds 
a university degree in economics and hails from a wealthy 
cattle-ranching family in the department of Cesar -- helped manage FARC 
finances and drug trafficking operations. 
 
4. (C) Palmera is believed to have been directly involved in several 
high profile terrorist incidents, including the kidnapping and murder o 
former Minister of Culture Consuelo Araujo in September 2001 and the 
deaths in May 2002 of over 100 civilians who took refuge in a church 
during a clash between the FARC and paramilitary forces in the town of 
Boyaja, Choco department.  The 53-year-old Palmera has been an active 
member of the FARC for nearly 20 years and gained public prominence fro 
his role as a hard-nosed FARC negotiator during peace negotiations with 
the government of President Andres Pastrana from 1998-2002.  Palmera di 
not play a major role in planning FARC combat operations; his absence i 
unlikely to hurt the group\'s military capacity. 
 
--------------------- 
Public Relations Coup 
--------------------- 
 
5. (C) Palmera\'s capture is a political victory for Uribe, who has 
publicly pledged to kill or capture leaders of Colombia\'s illegal armed 
groups before the end of his term.  Colombian media have touted the 
arrest as the most important blow to the FARC in recent memory, and it 
should temporarily satisfy the public\'s growing impatience to see the 
GOC achieve a major victory against the insurgent group.  Palmera\'s 
arrest also demonstrates the importance of close security cooperation 
between the GOC and officials in neighboring countries, where FARC 
leaders often go for relaxation. 
 
----------- 
Extradition 
----------- 
6. (C) Senior GOC officials, including President Uribe, have asked that 
the U.S. consider requesting the extradition of Palmera.  They 
obviously would prefer to see him secure in a U.S. jail than processed 
in the sometimes unreliable Colombian judicial system.  Their requests 
have had a note of urgency to them.  At this time, however, Palmera doe 
not face criminal charges in the U.S.  The Embassy is unaware of any 
pending investigations against this well-known narco-terrorist by U.S. 
law enforcement agencies.

Reftel A:  Bogota 11175 
Reftel B:  Bogota 011582 
 
1.  This is a summary of NAS Bogota activities for November 2003. 
 
Eradication and Interdiction 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  Eradication:  In November, the Colombian National Police (CNP) 
sprayed 6,268 hectares of coca.  Spray aircraft and support 
helicopters took a total of six hits from ground fire. 
 
3.  On November 20, NAS supported a Counter-narcotics Brigade 
mission in Meta Department in a successful combined-arms operation 
involving ground troops, intelligence, transport, and strike 
aircraft operating in concert.  Four UH-60 Plan Colombia 
helicopters, escorted by four UH-1N Plan Colombia aircraft, 
transported the assault force to the target area.  The UH-1N 
escorts destroyed two trucks transporting enemy reinforcements, 
resulting in an unknown number of enemy casualties.  The Colombian 
Air Force supported the mission with preplanned fire from fixed- 
wing and helicopter gun ships.  Ground forces seized or destroyed 
the following assets: estimated 16,000 gallons of liquid chemical 
precursors; 2.2 MT of solid precursors; three MT of ANFO 
explosives; 79 explosive cylinders of varying sizes (20, 40, and 
100 pounds); 21 mortars; four trucks; three motorcycles; 40 mines; 
500 meters of detonation cord; and 50 car alarms used in remote 
detonators.  Four personnel were also captured.  This successful 
action will serve as a model for future operations.  (See Reftel 
A). 
 
4.  Narcotics Police (DIRAN):  In November, DIRAN units captured 
and destroyed five cocaine HCL labs, 17 coca base labs, and two 
potassium permanganate labs.  DIRAN also seized fourteen MT of 
cocaine/coca base and ten MT of marijuana. 
 
TRAINING 
-------- 
 
5.  The Inter-American Air Forces Academy in San Antonio, Texas, 
invited the first CNP officer (a DIRAN Lieutenant) to be a guest 
instructor at the school for the next two years. 
 
6.  The Deputy Director of Colombian National Police Training and 
the Director of the Prosecutor General\'s Investigation School 
attended the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) 
Conference in Quito to discuss requirements for the proposed ILEA 
South to be established in Costa Rica. 
 
7.  The US Army Special Forces team began a six-week Close 
Quarters Combat training course in Espinal for 68 members of the 
DIRAN\'s three Airmobile Companies (Junglas).  The course includes 
60mm mortar and MK19 Automatic Grenade Launcher training. 
 
JOINT COMMUNICATIONS 
-------------------- 
 
8.  The DIRAN and the Colombian Military (COLMIL) completed 
integration of a DIRAN UHF radio repeater with the COLMIL 
Microwave network (RIC) at the repeater site in Caqueta 
Department.  Supported by NAS, they now have a total of seven 
sites throughout Colombia that integrate DIRAN UHF repeaters with 
the RIC.  The new repeater proved successful after linking the 
Florencia DIRAN Company with a Colombian Army (COLAR) Battalion 
located in southern Colombia.  This integration represents a major 
step towards achieving joint communications in Colombia.  The 
final repeater installation in Valle Department will complete this 
phase of the project. 
 
AIR BRIDGE DENIAL (ABD) 
----------------------- 
 
9.  In November, ABD tracked 2,530 aircraft, 47 of which were 
unidentified assumed suspect aircraft.  One single engine plane 
and one helicopter were destroyed on the ground.  (See Reftel B). 
 
 
CNP Aviation (ARAVI) 
-------------------- 
 
10.  In November, the three largest components of ARAVI\'s fleet 
clocked 1,191 mission hours:  the UH-1H II helicopters flew 840 
mission hours with an operational readiness rate of 79 percent, 
the Bell 212 helicopters flew 211 mission hours with an 
operational readiness rate of 76 percent, and the UH-60L 
helicopters flew 140 mission hours with an operational readiness 
rate of 66 percent.  ARAVI continued to support other crucial 
mission-supported operations, including assisting the FBI with a 
controlled delivery in Cucuta on November 10 that resulted in the 
seizure of over 13 kilos of quality heroin and subsequent arrests 
in the United States and Colombia. 
 
Law Enforcement/Public Security 
------------------------------- 
 
11.  Carabineros:  Squadrons seized five Kgs of coca base and one 
Kg of marijuana; arrested 163 suspects; and seized 81 firearms. 
Training for three more Squadrons (numbers 21-23) continues in 
Espinal, with graduation scheduled for 13 Dec 03.  Seventy new 
Field Medics graduated on November 21 and were deployed to their 
departments.  The Carabineros conducted a large operation in Huila 
Department, capturing 35 suspected FARC militia. 
 
12.  Port Security Program:  NAS Bogota co-sponsored a Port 
Security Seminar in Guayaquill, Ecuador, attended by 240 foreign 
and U.S. officials from the region.  Post also provided canine 
training at a similar seminar in the Dominican Republic. 
 
Rule of Law 
----------- 
 
13.  Bureau of Prisons (BOP):  BOP officials traveled to Combita 
Penitentiary to conduct audits of security and administration, to 
review canine usage, and to donate an electrical stabilizer for 
ITEMIZER equipment.  BOP also provided a BEAMHIT firing simulator 
to the Penitentiary training facility. 
 
Administration 
-------------- 
 
14.  NAS Contracting Officer issued separate solicitations for the 
aviation fuel requirements of the CNP and COLAR; awarded 
construction contracts to refurbish a NAS warehouse; and issued 
seven Notices-to-Proceed on projects ranging in value from USD 
25,000 to 250,000.  NAS received proposals for the construction of 
one new barracks, the remodeling of one barracks, and the 
construction of a new heliport in San Jose del Guaviare. 
 
Environment 
----------- 
 
15.  From November 11-26, officials from NAS, the Ministry of the 
Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture, the DIRAN, and the 
National Directorate for Dangerous Drugs used helicopter over- 
flights to assess the efficacy of aerial eradication.  The group 
visited Nario, Putumayo, Caqueta, Guaviare, Meta, Arauca, Norte 
de Santander, and Antioquia Departments.  A final report is being 
drafted, but preliminary findings indicate that replant rates 
remain high and damage to surrounding crops and vegetation is 
minimal.

SUBJECT: RELEASED ELN HOSTAGE DISCUSSES KIDNAPPING 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
 
1. (C) On December 24, poloff met with Israeli citizen Ido Guy, who had 
been released by the National Liberation Army (ELN) two days earlier af 
over three months in captivity.  Guy was accompanied by Israeli securit 
liaison Guy Ner, who had been posted at the headquarters of the Colombi 
military\'s First Division in Santa Marta during much of the hostages\' 
captivity.  Guy and Ner made several notable observations about the ELN 
structure and kidnapping methods: 
 
------------------ 
Sequence of Events 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) While camping near the city of Santa Marta, in the \"Ciudad 
Perdida\", one of Colombia\'s most significant archeological sites, Guy a 
seven other tourists were approached by a dozen armed individuals who, 
without identifying themselves, claimed the area was dangerous and said 
they would guide the tourists to safety.  After walking and camping for 
two days, a guerrilla commander arrived to tell the tourists that the E 
was retaining them as political hostages.  Prior to this, the guerrilla 
had refused to identify themselves.  The hostages were moved frequently 
usually spending no more than a few days at any one location.  However, 
they remained at one camp for nearly a month.  Two days before the 
hostages\' release, several allegedly high-ranking ELN commanders, who 
concealed their faces, arrived to ask the hostages how they planned to 
publicly characterize their time in ELN captivity.  Although the 
commanders did not directly pressure the hostages to describe their 
experience with a pro-ELN slant, they were clearly concerned about how 
hostages\' stories would affect the ELN\'s international image.  On Decem 
22, their captors released them to a delegation from the Roman Catholic 
Church  National Conciliation Commission (CCN) and the National Human 
Rights Ombudsman\'s Office (Defensorma). 
 
------------------- 
A Spartan Lifestyle 
------------------- 
 
3. (C) Guy, a former member of the Israeli army, estimated most of his 
captors to be in their late teens or early twenties.  Commanders appear 
slightly older, possibly in their thirties.  Morale among the combatant 
seemed good.  Their educational levels and familiarity with politics an 
current events varied considerably.  Most appeared committed to the ELN 
political ideology and claimed to be combating social inequality.  Near 
all expressed disdain for the United States and President Uribe.  In 
comparing themselves to the FARC, the combatants said the ELN was a mor 
politically focused organization.  Although they were well armed with 
Galil rifles, AK47s, and M-16s, they often played with their weapons an 
did not follow safety precautions.  Only the commanders and a few 
combatants had camouflage uniforms; the others wore civilian clothes. 
Food was scarce.  The combatants found fruits and vegetables growing in 
the area or commandeered livestock and other food from the local 
population. 
 
------------------ 
Area of Operations 
------------------ 
 
4. (C) Guy and Ner believe the kidnapping was approved at the highest 
levels of the ELN.  Orders for the combatants came via radio or letters 
delivered by local residents, who were often indigenous persons.  The E 
appeared firmly in control of territory near \"Ciudad Perdida\" and showe 
little concern about the possible presence of other illegal armed group 
or the Colombian military.  As they moved in what Guy believed was an 
easterly direction, however, the combatants appeared much less familiar 
with the territory and became more concerned about security.  Residents 
many villages through which the group passed appeared complicit with th 
ELN, although in other communities combatants tried to conceal the 
hostages and threatened villagers with retaliation if they did not assi 
them. 
 
----------------- 
Hostage Treatment 
----------------- 
 
5. (C) Guy said he and his fellow hostages were treated moderately well 
probably on the direct orders of senior ELN leaders.  For example, the 
hostages ate before their captors did and were provided medical care -- 
albeit rudimentary -- by female combatants with limited medical supplie 
Guy was given a pair of rubber boots to replace the inadequate shoes he 
was wearing when he was kidnapped.  They were allowed to keep their 
watches and other valuables and could listen to the news on the radio. 
Guy claimed he was never seriously afraid he would be executed, but 
worried about health problems and the possibility of a firearms acciden 
The hostages were not allowed to contact their families and were not to 
ahead of time when they would be released.  About a dozen armed combata 
usually guarded them, although an additional contingent joined them for 
several days shortly after the kidnapping.  Early in their ordeal the 
hostages unsuccessfully attempted to escape, after which their captors 
threatened to treat them more harshly but never followed up on their 
threats.  All told, Guy estimated the hostages walked approximately 300 
miles during their captivity. 
----------------------------------- 
Disappointing COLMIL Rescue Efforts 
----------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Ner was frustrated by the First Division\'s efforts to locate the 
hostages.  In his view, the division used the kidnapping as a 
justification for launching operations in the region that were only 
tangentially related to the hostages.  He also believes that now-retire 
General Leonel Gomez, then-Commander of the First Division, was less th 
honest in describing his efforts to find the hostages.  For example, Ne 
recounted that Gomez had claimed the hostages were taken southwest, and 
that First Division troops had found some of the hostages belongings 
along that route.  However, Ner believes the hostages were taken east a 
that Gomez falsely claimed to have found some of the hostages\' belongin 
in order to appease Ner and other interested parties.  According to Guy 
only once during their entire captivity, when they heard a helicopter i 
the distance, did the hostages see evidence of Colombian military 
operations.  The Colombian military did not debrief the hostages for 
intelligence purposes after their release.  Representatives of the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\") were the only government agent 
to speak with the hostages and, in Ner\'s opinion, the interviews they 
conducted were cursory.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Politics and economics in the northern department of 
Cesar are heavily influenced by the interests of a small 
number of prominent families and the depredations of illegal 
armed groups.  Despite the distractions posed by feuds within 
the local aristocracy and the active presence of the FARC, 
ELN, and AUC, the GOC has improved the security situation in 
the department significantly since President Alvaro Uribe 
took office in August 2002.  All of the department\'s 
municipalities now have a permanent police presence, and 
kidnappings on departmental highways -- which severely 
discouraged travel and commerce -- have been dramatically 
reduced.  The porous border with Venezuela, however, 
continues to be a security problem, and the local economy has 
yet to recover from the downturn of the late 1990s.  End 
Summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2. (U) On December 11-13, Embassy officials visited 
Valledupar, capital of the northern department of Cesar. 
Situated near the southern foothills of the Sierra Nevada de 
Santa Marta mountains and 35 miles west of the rugged 
Venezuelan border, Valledupar is the department\'s largest 
city, with approximately 400,000 inhabitants.  The 
department\'s principal industries are coal mining, cotton 
farming, and cattle ranching, although the internal armed 
conflict has adversely affected all these industries. 
According to the Social Solidarity Network (RSS), the GOC\'s 
displaced persons service agency, during 2000-2002, more 
persons were forcibly displaced in Cesar than in any other 
department.  In 2003, 11 percent of all kidnappings in 
Colombia took place in Cesar.  Approximately 6,000 military 
and 2,000 police are stationed in the department. 
 
----------- 
Family Ties 
----------- 
 
3. (C) Cesar is dominated by a handful of powerful families, 
among them the Araujos, Gneccos, Castros, and Pupos.  Not 
only are they major power brokers in Cesar, but they also 
wield significant influence in Bogota.  According to 
Lieutenant Colonel Hernan Mejia (protect), commander of the 
Colombian Army\'s Second Artillery Battalion, the Araujos and 
Gneccos have each reached accommodations with different 
illegal armed groups ) the Araujos with the United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), and the Gneccos with 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). 
 
4. (C) The Araujo family has produced ten departmental 
governors, including current Governor Hernando Molina Araujo. 
 Molina\'s mother, the late Consuelo Araujo Noguera, 
affectionately known throughout Colombia as \"La Cacica,\" was 
GOC Minister of Culture when she was kidnapped and murdered 
by the FARC in September 2001.  His cousin Maria Consuelo 
Araujo is the current Minister of Culture. 
 
5. (C) The Gnecco family has a member serving on the Supreme 
Court.  One family member was removed from the governorship 
for corruption.  Additional family members have held mayoral 
and other local government posts in surrounding departments. 
Family icon Hugo Gnecco was accused of fiscal improprieties 
as mayor of Santa Marta, Magdalena department, and was 
suspended in February 2003.  The public accusations were made 
by Inspector General Maya, of the Araujo family, which raised 
suspicions that the charges were politically motivated. 
 
------------------------------------- 
The Influence of Illegal Armed Groups 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The tenor of local and departmental politics is 
strongly influenced by illegal armed groups. 
-- The FARC kidnapped Elias Guillermo Ochoa in 1998, in 
between his two stints as mayor. Ochoa\'s second term 
concluded in December 2003.  Of seven brothers in his 
immediate family, four have been kidnapped by an illegal 
armed group.  One brother was kidnapped twice. 
 
-- Recently inaugurated Governor Hernando Molina ran 
uncontested in the October departmental election.  Other 
viable candidates dropped out of the race, reportedly under 
pressure by the AUC.  Nearly half of the votes were blank 
ballots, in protest. 
 
-- New Valledupar mayor, Ciro Arturo Pupo, is a cousin of 
prominent AUC paramilitary leader Rodrigo Tovar Pupo.  Tovar 
operates near the town of Becerril, 50 miles south of 
Valledupar.  He reports directly to AUC military commander 
Salvatore Mancuso.  Mayor Pupo (strictly protect) told 
poloffs that although he and his cousin are not on good 
terms, their family ties guarantee him \"unsolicited\" 
protection.  Other sources confirmed strained relations 
between Ciro Pupo and Rodrigo Tovar. 
 
7. (C) Colombia\'s three principal illegal armed groups -- the 
FARC, the AUC, and the National Liberation Army (ELN) -- have 
a strong presence in Cesar department.  FARC fronts operate 
along the Venezuelan border and in parts of the Sierra Nevada 
de Santa Marta mountains.  The ELN is also present in the 
Sierra Nevadas, as evidenced by its kidnapping of eight 
foreign tourists on the range\'s north slope in September 
(reftel).  The AUC is the primary terrorist organization 
operating on the department\'s central and southern plains, 
where cattle ranching and coal mining are the principal 
economic engines.  Most government officials poloffs spoke 
with said the paramilitaries now pose the greatest threat to 
the department. 
 
8. (C) According to local officials, Cesar does not have a 
significant drug trafficking economy.  Consequently, locally 
based illegal armed groups are relatively poor and rely 
heavily on kidnapping and extortion for resources.  Because 
there are few coca and poppy fields to protect, illegal armed 
groups lay fewer improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Cesar 
than they do in other departments. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
The Porous Venezuelan Border: A Security Threat 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
9. (C) Military and police officials expressed concern about 
the FARC\'s exploitation of the mountainous Venezuelan border 
and its alleged use of permanent encampments in Venezuela. 
Former governor Guillermo Castro, who left office in December 
2003, asserted that Venezuelan officials visit these FARC 
camps on a regular basis.  Local representatives of the 
Administrative Department of Security (DAS), Colombia\'s 
FBI/INS-equivalent, described their cooperation with their 
Venezuelan counterparts as limited, but generally positive. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Security Improving, but the Economy Lags Behind 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
10. (C) Before the election of President Alvaro Uribe, high 
numbers of kidnappings, murders, and extortion attempts 
discouraged residents from using the department\'s highways 
and led many to abandon their farms and country homes for the 
relative safety of the cities.  According to local 
politicians and law enforcement officials, however, security 
in the department has improved dramatically over the past 
year, encouraging intercity travel and the return of property 
owners to rural areas. 
 
11. (C) All municipalities in Cesar now have a police force, 
and three 150-man \"Carabinero\", or rural mounted police, 
squadrons operate in the department.  Additional police have 
been assigned exclusively to patrolling the principal highway 
linking Valledupar with Santa Marta, on the Caribbean coast. 
Kidnappings along the highway have decreased significantly 
over the past year, a result of a larger police presence and 
better coordination between the police and the military. 
 
12. (SBU) Cesar\'s economy has suffered from the department\'s 
previously tenuous security situation.  Valledupar\'s mayor 
estimated unemployment in the city to be about forty percent, 
which is inflated by large numbers of displaced persons. 
With security improving, local officials expressed optimism 
about the economy, beginning with a revitalization of the 
cotton industry.

1. (SBU) Summary: On January 5, Senate Majority Leader Bill 
Frist met separately with Minister of Defense Jorge Alberto 
Uribe Echavarria, Minister of Foreign Relations Carolina 
Barco, and Vice Minister of Trade Claudia Maria Uribe. 
Senator Frist also had the opportunity to discuss the 
upcoming free trade agreement (FTA) with local business 
leaders.  A readout of the Senator\'s January 4 meetings in

------------------------------------ 
Meeting with Defense Minister Uribe 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) In their meeting with Senator Frist, Minister of 
Defense Uribe and his colleagues reviewed the year-end 
results of the internal conflict, highlighting the reductions 
in violence and kidnapping and the increases in combatants 
captured and illicit crops eradicated.  For example, during 
the first 17 months of the Uribe administration, compared to 
the last 17 months of the administration of President Andres 
Pastrana, coca eradication has increased 60 percent, 
terrorist acts have decreased 28 percent, captures of both 
guerrillas and paramilitaries have increased well over 100 
percent, and kidnappings have decreased 26 percent.  Murders 
and massacres (four or more civilians killed at one time) 
have decreased 20 and 39 percent, respectively.  This is the 
first time the murder rate has decreased since 1983 with the 
exception of a negligible decrease between 1994 and 1996. 
MOD Uribe noted that public confidence in the security forces 
has grown dramatically, citing a recent poll that indicates 
that both the military and police have approval ratings of 
over 70 percent.  Finally, MOD Uribe emphasized that respect 
for human rights is a constant priority for the security 
forces. 
 
3. (C) MOD Uribe credited U.S. assistance ) in the form of 
training, operational guidance, and material support ) as a 
key factor in the recent security successes.  He noted that 
drug trafficking has been the main cause of Colombia,s 
continued internal conflict and said that the GOC is 
committed to eliminating drugs in Colombia.  MOD Uribe 
cautioned that, despite many reasons for optimism, the GOC 
still faces an uphill battle in establishing a state presence 
throughout the national territory.  He said that the security 
forces would focus on increasing their capacity to conduct 
joint operations in small, commando-style units and that U.S. 
training has been, and will continue to be, crucial to the 
military,s ability to carry out this type of operation. 
 
4. (C) In 2004, the GOC will target the FARC in their 
stronghold in heavily forested southeastern Colombia, which 
will require both large-scale counterguerrilla operations and 
smaller, targeted special operations.  Armed Forces Commander 
General Carlos Ospina echoed MOD Uribe,s sentiments about 
the importance of joint operations and U.S. assistance, 
especially as the security forces attempt to confront the 
FARC in one of their strongholds.  Both Senator Frist and MOD 
Uribe agreed that they look forward to continued close 
cooperation between the Colombian security forces and the 
U.S.

5. (C) Senator Frist met with Minister of Foreign Relations 
Carolina Barco, who was accompanied by Vice-Minister Camilo 
Reyes.  Barco noted the GOC supports the USG\'s goals for the 
upcoming Summit of the Americas meeting in Mexico. 
Vice-Minister Reyes said that he has been working closely 
with the USG delegation on the text of the final declaration, 
approximately half of which remains to be negotiated.  He 
said the GOC, like the USG, is working to make the 
declaration\'s language precise and include specific deadlines 
for reaching designated benchmarks. 
 
6. (C) Senator Frist praised the USG-GOC Article 98 
agreement, which Barco characterized as the fruit of a 
constructive and respectful bilateral relationship.  Barco 
described the agreement as resting on three premises: (1) 
that although Colombia is a party to the ICC, the United 
States is not; (2) that the operation of the Colombian and 
U.S. judicial systems should be respected; and (3) that 
crimes against humanity should be punished.  Barco said the 
final agreement successfully satisfied the principles on 
which all three premises are based.  The Ambassador noted 
that the USG is using its Article 98 agreement with Colombia 
as a model for negotiations with other nations. 
7. (C) In response to an inquiry from the Senator, Barco said 
she believes Venezuela\'s short-term stability depends on 
President Chavez\'s response to the referendum on his 
presidency.  She said that oversight of the referendum 
process provided by representatives of the OAS and the Carter 
Center is key to assuring that the GOV adheres to democratic 
principles.  Barco was frank in characterizing bilateral 
relations with Venezuela as \"difficult\" and emphasized the 
problems caused by the unstable security situation along the 
Venezuelan border.  She also acknowledged recent incidents in 
which Venezuelan troops have crossed into Colombian territory 
and noted that drugs and members of illegal armed groups 
cross the thinly populated border with ease.  Barco said that 
President Uribe has asked President Chavez for increased 
information-sharing along the border and has consistently 
told him Colombia\'s security problems could quickly reproduce 
themselves in Venezuela if the GOV does not expeditiously 
address the issue.  Barco opined that bilateral relations are 
not a political priority for Chavez, and said her goals are 
to increase working level cooperation on border issues and to 
prevent bilateral relations from becoming a political issue 
in Venezuela.  Barco added that GOC border cooperation with 
the governments of Peru, Ecuador, and, more recently, Panama 
is excellent, and that cooperation with Brazil is improving. 
Barco added that the GOC\'s strongest allies in Europe are the 
United Kingdom and Spain. 
 
8. (C) As noted in reftel, Senator Frist and Ambassador Wood 
emphasized the high importance of Summit of the Americas 
issues to the USG and outlined them for the FM.  Senator 
Frist very effectively explained why these issues were 
important. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Meeting with Vice Trade Minister Uribe 
--------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU)  In his meeting with Vice Trade Minister Claudia 
Maria Uribe and Vice Minister of Finance Ricardo Ortega, the 
Senator was assured that the GOC will be prepared to begin 
negotiations of a FTA in April.  They have assembled a 
government-wide committee at the vice ministerial level to 
study the issues and to coordinate with the negotiating team, 
which will be led by Hernando Jose Gomez, a former ambassador 
to the WTO.  The GOC has also established a secure website to 
facilitate coordination and communication among ministries, 
while an active program of outreach to the private sector 
seeks to educate and include all economic actors.  Ortega 
stressed that Colombia had made a strategic decision to move 
away from the model of a closed regional economy with 
Ecuador, Peru and Brazil, toward a free-market model based on 
an open relationship with the U.S.  The Senator requested, 
and the Ambassador seconded, reconsideration of Colombia\'s 
restrictions on the import of refurbished industrial engines 
(Cummins engines), an issue VM Uribe said they take 
seriously, but for which she made no commitment. 
 
------------------------ 
Colombians Discuss Trade 
------------------------ 
 
10.(SBU)  In his meeting with business leaders, the Senator 
heard primarily positive reactions to the planned FTA. 
Energy sector executives expressed confidence in Colombia\'s 
long-term potential, particularly in natural gas and coal, 
although they related a need for more transparency and legal 
protections for foreign investors.  Similarly, the head of 
the flower exporters association outlined their market 
successes.  He emphasized the importance of trade 
preferences, stability in the exchange rate, and improvements 
in air transportation rates to his industry.  He caught 
Senator Frist\'s attention by noting that flower growers 
employ 15 people per hectare vice two or three per hectare in 
other agricultural commodities.  The banking association 
representative explained how GOC reforms have saved the 
financial sector from crisis, and expressed interest in a FTA 
that would permit branches of Colombian banks to be located 
in U.S. communities with large Colombian populations. 
However, he also explained that requirements sought by U.S. 
banks to use the global capital of a bank in calculating 
lending limits in Colombia would be extremely onerous.  A 
representative of the rice growers association sounded a note 
of caution and placed trade negotiations in the context of 
Colombia\'s rural poverty.  He said that opening up the market 
in the early 1990\'s led to a 30 percent drop in agricultural 
output and an equal increase in food imports, which triggered 
unemployment and illegal activity in rural areas.  In 
response, the Senator and several participants agreed that 
FTA would create \"some winners and some losers,\" but that 
discouraging illegal activities should be a goal of the 
agreement.  The Senator pointed out that Tennessee textile 
producers had suffered a similar transition, so he understood 
the problem, but that change was necessary. 
 
11. (U) Senator Frist did not have an opportunity to clear 
this message.

3.  (C) Uribe lamented the USG\'s travel advisory against 
cruise ship calls to Cartagena.  Ambassador Wood noted that 
the USG and GOC have discussed the issue on numerous 
occasions and the USG would continue to consider Colombian 
concerns.  Senator Frist promised to keep the issue on the 
front burner but noted that the Department of State had the 
lead on the issue.  In response to a question from Senator 
Frist, Uribe lauded the capture of FARC leader Simon Trinidad 
in Quito (reftel) and described relations with Ecuador as 
good, particularly at the presidential level, and improving. 
Continuing with security issues, Uribe called attention to 
the peaceful and transparent nature of elections and 
referendum voting last October.  He stressed his and the 
GOC\'s commitment to safeguarding human rights.  Ambassador 
Wood praised Uribe for a 50 percent reduction in the number 
of displaced persons during 2003. 
 
4.  (C) Turning to socioeconomic issues, Uribe noted that tax 
collection as a percentage of GDP had risen from 16 to 19 
percent during 2003.  He felt additional legislation was 
needed to address the budget burden caused by pensions and 
health care.  Senator Frist inquired about the public health 
care system in Colombia and access to care, particularly in 
rural areas.  Uribe indicated progress had been made in 
ensuring coverage countrywide via the public hospital system.

negotiations.  Senator Frist stated he shared Uribe\'s desire 
for a mutually beneficial FTA. 
 
5.  (C) Uribe asked for additional helicopter resources and 
improved spare parts delivery to assist with the 
counternarcotics fight.  He also called attention to problems 
with existing OV-10 aircraft.  In response to Uribe\'s request 
for A-10 Warthogs, Ambassador Wood noted the suspension of 
production and that the U.S. needed those being called back 
into service for use in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Ambassador 
Wood expressed concern about the lack of resources for 
evacuating Colombian military and police personnel injured in 
clashes with drug traffickers and/or guerrillas.  Senator 
Frist stated he would be a strong advocate of enhanced 
counternarcotics and military assistance to the GOC. 
 
6.  (C) Ambassador Wood stressed the importance of the 
Special Summit of the Americas in Mexico (January 12-13) and 
requested that Colombia work with us to ensure that the final 
document is practical and focused.  He also took the

AND END OF YEAR RESULTS (CORRECTED COPY - SUPERSEDES REFTEL 
BOGOTA 00686) 
 
REF:  A. SEC2003 STATE 265910 
 
1. (U) Summary:  Following is the December Air Bridge Denial 
(ABD) activity report required by ref A. There were over 
2400 tracks sorted, of which 26 were declared Unidentified, 
Assumed Suspect (UAS) Tracks, with one pPhase I and two 
Phase II events during the month of December.  ABD program 
issues of concern include the availability of interceptors 
and focused operations.  End Summary. 
 
ABD Tracks 
---------- 
 
2. (U) In December 2003, over 2400 tracks were sorted, of 
which 26 were declared UAS aircraft.  The GOC did not react 
to 15 UAS, five due to non-availability of assets or 
proximity to borders/international waters, six due to the 
track information being dated or insufficient, and the 
remaining four were eventually identified as friendly. 
 
Phase II Events 
---------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  On 11 December 11, 2003, the Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE) Airborne Early Warning ( AEW) P-3 
aircraft discovered a track in nearthe the Colombia-Braziln 
border in the Dog\'s Head area.  The Citation was airborne, 
and responded, and .  JIATF-S declared it a UAS.  The 
Citation made radar then visual contact with the UAS.  The 
UAS,, a white single-engine aircraft,  thatthen landed in 
San Pedro, an illegal airfield near Caruru in Vaupes 
Department.  7 to 10 individuals offloaded tThe aircraft was 
then off-loaded,then moved off the runway, and concealed.it 
into trees at the eastern end of the runway and covered it 
with a tarp.  The Citation completed pPhase I, and .  Phase 
II was requested and approved but the Air and Ground Safety 
Monitors did not relay this to JIATF-S.  When the phase II 
was accomplished, JIATF-S objected and during the ensuing 
discussions, the interceptor aircraft on station ran low on 
fuel and had to return to base.where although the FAC 
Commander gave approval for phase II, this step was never 
transmitted as completed over the radio, so JIATF objected 
when Phase II was completed without the approval having been 
relayed.  The A-37 only had about 5 minutes station time 
available, so while the objection was discussed they had to 
leave. The Citation had been airborne for one and a half 
hours before phase I started, so they would not be able to 
stay for a long time.  The Citation also ran low on fuel and 
returned to base, so the event was terminated.  and the 
Citation returned to base.  There was talk about sending 
another A-37 and another Citation and starting as a new 
event but eventually there was no further action. The review 
of this event underscored the is event emphasized theneed 
for safety monitors to adhere to the checklist and ensure 
that continuous, effective communication is maintained 
throughout the event.emphasize checklist step completion and 
getting acknowledgement for these. 
 
4. (SBU) On 16 December 16, 2003, the ICE P-3 reported a 
track about to enter Colombia from Brazil in the Dog\'s Head 
area from Brazil.  The Citation tracker was airborne and 
entered an orbit.  A Tucano interceptor based inwas airborne 
from  San Jose de Guaviare was also airborne.  The target 
made repeated a couple of feints towards Colombian Airspace, 
but e.  Each time , they returned to Brazilian airspace to 
avoid interception. after the Citation maneuvered to 
intercept. The target orbited for 1 hour and 15 minutes 
before it made it\'s final move. 
 
Once the target crossing into Colombian airspace.  ed the 
border, The Citation and the Tucano moved in for the 
interception.  .  Phase I was completed .  The target headed 
towards Caruru with the Tucano in trail.and Phase II was 
approved, but at this time by then it was too dark for the 
Tucano to maintainkeep visual contact and safely fire 
warning shots.  The runway at Caruru was illuminated, 
however, enabling the target aircraft lit up in time for the 
target to land.  The target aircraft was then moved to the 
vicinity of structures, at which point GOC authorities 
elected not to proceed with the event.  N and it was 
immediately pushed into a hangar surrounded by structures, 
making it impossible to proceed any further.  An AC-47 had 
been scrambled towards the area but Host Nation decided to 
end the event at that point. 
 
NOTE:  The GOCHost Nation has stationedmoved some Tucano 
aircraft to San Jose de Guaviare, which 
effectivelypractically doubles the interceptor availability 
in the Dog\'s Head area.  Two Tucanos were available for this 
event.  San Jose is almost halfway between Apiay and Caruru, 
but the runway is not usable by the A-37.  Though the 
Tucanos are considerably slower than the A-37s and have 
shorter range, but having themtheir availability at this 
location gives enhances the possibility of completing 
interceptions/events in this critical area of Colombia.  End 
noteus greater possibility of completing an intercept. 
 
Ongoing Activities 
------------------ 
 
3. An ABD IPR was held 9-10 December.  As a result, it was 
agreed to focus ABD assets with the ICE P-3 when one is in 
Colombia to maximize use of that asset.  This was done 
starting mid December and will be resumed once a P-3 returns 
to Colombia, which is expected to happen mid Jan 04.  Next 
IPR will be 29 Jan 04 ay Key West. The February 24-25, 2004 
IPR will also serve as a semi-annual Program Management 
Review and will be held at Key West. 
 
Ongoing Issues 
-------------- 
----- 
 
45. (SBU)  Interceptor availability continues to be a 
concern.  Most activity has centered in the Dog 
Head\'s/Caruru area, but the distance from interceptor bases 
and lack of GOC ground-based forces in this area has limited 
our ability to bring events to a conclusion.  All four 
aircraft destroyed thus far have been in the northern half 
of Colombia, where fighters are located more closely to 
targets.  With no fixed date for the arrival of the OV-10s 
undergoing maintenance in the United States, and nearly half 
the A-37 fleet down for long-term maintenance/non- 
availability of parts, MOD officials have again raised the 
possibility of acquiring additional interceptor and tracker 
aircraft.  During the December 9-10, 2003, ABD Interim 
Program Review (IPR), the GOC agreed to focus its limited 
ABD assets (trackers and interceptors) in those areas where 
the ICE P-3 wwis programmed to operate.  The USG agreed to 
explore means of upgrading facilities to permit the basing 
of interceptors closer to the Colombia-Brazil border.  The 
GOC also has plans to station ground-forces in this area 
during first quarter of 2004.  The next IPR is scheduled for 
January 29, 2004, in Key West.  The February 24-25, 2004, 
IPR will also serve as a semi-annual Program Management 
Review. 
 
CY 2003 Nnumbers 
--------------- 
 
65. (SBU)  The ABD program was activein action for the 
finallast four months of 2003.  There were twelve12 ABD 
events in Colombian airspace, in which seven aircraft were 
forced to land.  There were four Phase I, two Phase II, and 
6six Phase III events resulting in with 4five destroyed 
aircraft destroyed and one receiving anundetermined amount 
of damage.  There were 6Six aircraft and one Go-Fast boat 
were captured andwith a total of 6.9 MT of cocaine were 
seizedimpounded. 
The eleven destroyed/impounded aircraft (5/6) for one 
trimester compares favorably to full-year numbers achieved 
under the previous ABD program in the 1998 (16/12) and 1999 
(15/16) timeframes. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: The ABD program, re-started in August 2003 
following a two-year hiatus, is effectively a new program 
with new personnel and procedures.  We are in constant 
contact with the GOC and the Joint Interagency Task Force 
South (JIATF-S) to identify and exploit possible program 
improvements.  The partial-year results achieved in 2003 
are, in our view, all the more impressive when viewed in the 
context of a work in progress.  End comment.     Most of the 
activity has centered in the Dog Head\'s/Caruru area. 
However, the distance from interceptor bases and lack of 
government presence in the area have made most of the 
activities there close calls (Four Phase I and two Phase II, 
with two Phase III where the damage to the aircraft was 
undetermined).  All four destroyed aircraft were destroyed 
in the northern half of Colombia, where fighters are more 
closely located to targets.  The ten destroyed/impounded 
aircraft (4/6) for one quarter project to yearly numbers 
similar to those obtained under ABD in 1998 (16/12) and 1999 
(15/16).  This in spite of new procedures, new crews, 
limited fighter availability and very limited P-3 presence 
during this period.

REFTEL:  1) BOGOTA 03026, 2) BOGOTA 05259, 3) BOGOTA 08486 
 
1. This report on Colombian media covers the period 
September - November 2003. In this time frame, major 
Colombian print media (dailies El Tiempo, El Nuevo Siglo, La 
Republica, and Portafolio, and weeklies El Espectador, 
Semana, and Cambio) published 88 editorials, op-eds, and 
other signed commentaries concerning USG policy or leading 
bilateral issues.  Of these, 54 were positive or supportive 
of USG policies, and 34 were negative. 
 
U.S. Military Assistance to Colombia 
 
2. No articles dealt specifically with the topic of U.S. 
Military assistance to Colombia. 
 
Eradication/illicit crop spraying 
 
3. In this time frame, 5 articles dealt with the topic of 
eradication, aerial eradication, or glyphosate use. Two were 
positive and three were negative. 
 
The favorably disposed articles asserted that: 
 
-The agrochemicals used in coca growing cause more harm than 
glyphosate. 
 
-It is important to continue aerial eradication efforts at 
the border with Venezuela, especially in the area of La 
Gabarra. 
 
Negatively disposed articles asserted that: 
 
-The NGOs will continue to criticize President Uribe for not 
protecting the environment as long as he insists on using 
glyphosate. 
 
-By naming the previous Plan Colombia Coordinator Sandra 
Suarez as Minister of Environment, President Uribe sent the 
wrong message to environmentalists, who oppose to glyphosate 
use. 
 
-Glyphosate harms the jungle even more than other areas. 
More education on protecting nature is needed, rather than 
continued use of glyphosate. 
 
Plan Colombia 
 
4. In this time frame, no articles dealt with the topic of 
Plan Colombia and its results in either way. 
 
Trade issues 
 
5. There were 28 articles on trade issues, including 
regional issues, FTAA, and FTA. Twenty were positive and 
eight were negative. 
 
Positively disposed articles asserted that: 
 
-Colombia proposes negotiating an FTA without unfounded 
pretensions or expectations. 
 
-It is important to Colombia to maintain its share in global 
markets.  Opening up access to the U.S. market will help 
Colombia improve its competitiveness to do so. 
 
-Colombian businessmen, industrialists, and traders must 
change.  They must undertake the challenge of entering the 
U.S. market and view the U.S. as their ally. 
 
-The talks on services under the FTA, which some in Colombia 
perceive as something imposed by the U.S., will actually 
benefit Colombia. 
 
-With the WTO in hibernation, FTAA in intensive care, 
MERCOSUR in trouble, and an Andean Community Group without 
Venezuelan participation, bilateral trade relations with the 
U.S. are back, hopefully for the better. 
 
-Dealing with both FTAA and FTA at the same time requires 
Colombia to have a well-structured strategy that includes a 
good knowledge of our strengths and weaknesses, as well as 
our priorities. 
 
-Reaching an agreement between the Colombian Government, 
Congress, and the business community is crucial for defining 
Colombia\'s position at the trade talks on an FTA with the 
U.S. 
 
-Transcendental, historic, unprecedented, good news... is 
the announcement by the U.S. Government of its intention to 
initiate trade talks for a Free Trade Agreement with Andean 
nations.  This is the biggest trade success of the current 
Colombian Government.  It is important to have the full 
participation of the Colombian private sector in the talks. 
 
-By including agricultural issues in FTA negotiations, both 
nations have a lot to gain. Negotiations ought to allow a 
transition period for sensitive products.  Subsidies ought 
to be lifted gradually. 
-Reaching a free trade agreement with the U.S. is a priority 
for Colombia\'s trade policy, as is working to improve 
respect for contracts and intellectual property rights, and 
speeding up the paperwork and reducing expenses for 
investors. 
 
-It is important that Colombia stay calm and continue 
working with developed nations to reach a favorable 
agreement regarding agricultural protectionism. 
 
-Colombia and Peru are at the top of the list of nations 
with which the U.S. will initiate trade talks on a free 
trade agreement. 
 
-A free trade agreement with South American nations is not 
as good as access to U.S. and Canadian markets. 
 
-Having a good negotiating team is important. 
 
 
Negatively disposed articles asserted that: 
 
-A free trade agreement with the U.S. is a dilemma for 
Colombia.  If we don\'t sign one, we will lose participation 
in the U.S. market available to other countries; if we do 
sign one, the benefits will not be as good as those with 
Europe, including free migration and agricultural subsidies. 
 
-Colombia loses sovereignty under a free trade agreement 
with the U.S.  Compromises will have to be made on a variety 
of issues, including trade conflict resolution. 
 
-A free trade agreement with the U.S. will have a negative 
impact on Colombia\'s incipient industry.  There will be an 
avalanche of U.S. goods.  Turning our back on South American 
nations may lead the Colombian economy to disaster. 
 
-The U.S. and Europe let down the poor nations at the Cancun 
Conference. 
 
 
FARC violence, AUC talks, Demobilization of paramilitaries 
 
6. In this time frame, 19 articles dealt with the 
demobilization of paramilitaries, FARC violence, and human 
rights issues as discrete topics.  Seventeen were positive, 
although some with reservations, and two were negative. 
 
Positively disposed articles asserted that: 
 
-To condemn the demobilization of paramilitaries before it 
is completed is unjust and wrong. 
 
-A culture inside the Colombian Armed Forces has come 
together to observe human rights and international 
humanitarian law. 
 
-The Colombian authorities have no doubts the FARC is 
responsible for the bombing in the Zona Rosa of Bogota. 
 
-The Colombian Armed Forces have succeeded in the fight 
against terrorism and kidnapping, as a result of a 
combination of changes in strategy and improved 
intelligence.  A stronger armed forces is the result of 
modernization and an increased military budget. 
 
-The Mexico OAS Conference on Security Declaration is 
particularly important to Colombia.  The governments of 34 
American States call upon the FARC, the ELN, and self- 
defense groups to stop violence and enter peace talks. 
 
-The decision to fight terrorism in the jungle is positive. 
 
-The important questions on conditional liberty legislation 
asked by the U.S. send a clear message: more debate on the 
topic is required in order to prevent the failure of the 
incipient peace talks with self-defense groups. 
 
-The image presented to the world by President Uribe in the 
UNGA and Washington on human rights was a successful effort. 
-We are not against peace talks with the paramilitaries.  A 
balance must be struck between what the Colombian Government 
is offering and what they are willing to give up. 
 
-We are concerned that peace talks with the paramilitaries 
will allow drug traffickers to be part of the list of those 
demobilized. 
 
-The conditional liberty legislation is faulty. It lacks 
consensus. Amnesty and pardons should be granted at the end 
rather than the beginning of the talks. 
 
-The peace talks with the paramilitaries face difficulties 
and an atmosphere of uncertainty.  The international public 
disagrees with the proposed conditional liberty legislation. 
Negatively disposed articles asserted that: 
 
-The designated zone for peace talks with the paramilitaries 
in Medellin will become a problem. 
 
-In contradiction of (the position of) the Government of the 
U.S., Congressman Cass Ballenger supports conditional 
liberty legislation. 
 
 
Counter-narcotics/counter-insurgency 
 
7. A total of 6 articles dealt with counter-narcotics and 
counter-insurgency policy.  Five were positive and one was 
negative. 
 
Positively disposed articles asserted that: 
 
-With the appointment of a business leader as the new 
Minister of Interior and Justice, the Colombian President 
clearly is giving notice that money laundering and 
extradition remain law enforcement policy priorities. 
 
-A Counterterrorism Act is very important to Colombia. 
 
-In his remarks at the Civil-Military Relations Conference, 
U.S. Ambassador to Colombia William Wood was straightforward 
and concrete on the U.S. position against terrorist groups. 
 
-International solidarity with Colombia against terrorism 
must reflect appropriate assistance.  U.S. assistance 
already is there, and increasing, now through a free trade 
agreement.  The Europeans mustn\'t be so naive with a few 
NGOs.  The Europeans must cut the sources of financing of 
terrorist organizations. 
 
-A drastic reduction in drug trafficking will weaken the 
guerillas by attacking their major source of income. 
 
Negatively disposed article asserted that: 
 
-An international agreement on drug legalization would 
lessen the damage caused by narcotics. 
 
Miscellaneous articles 
 
8. Thirty-two miscellaneous articles addressed topics such 
as U.S. reconstruction policy in Iraq, the U.S. role in the 
Mideast, the global campaign against terrorism, the

RECORD IN COLOMBIA 2003-2004 
 
REF: 03 STATE 333935 
 
1. This is in response to reftel request. 
 
---------------------------- 
Human Rights Strategy Report 
---------------------------- 
 
2. Although Colombia is a democracy, a major internal armed 
conflict financed by drug trafficking and other criminal 
activities has created an environment in which serious 
violations of human rights, almost all of which are committed 
by guerrillas or illegal paramilitaries, are commonplace. 
The civilian judiciary is independent of the executive and 
legislative branches but confronts profound challenges from 
corruption and intimidation by guerrillas, paramilitaries, 
and other wealthy criminal organizations.  More 
significantly, the cumbersome inquisitorial judicial system 
is overworked and faces serious resource constraints. 
Impunity from prosecution, therefore, is a threat to the 
creation of a culture of respect for human rights. 
 
3. The 2003-2004 U.S. human rights and democracy strategy for 
Colombia is both proactive and responsive, tackling the root 
causes of human rights violations and social unrest while 
continuing to invest in short-term emergency humanitarian 
assistance.  Key strategic objectives include protection of 
vulnerable populations, increased access to the justice 
system, support for judicial reforms and the rule of law, 
promotion of local governance and peace initiatives, and 
provision of humanitarian assistance. 
 
4. Working with the Colombian Ministry of Interior and 
Justice, USAID has provided security protection assistance to 
3,145 people and 71 offices under threat.  The protection 
program includes threatened human rights workers, union 
leaders, journalists, members of the left wing Patriotic 
Union Party, mayors, city council members and municipal human 
rights workers.  The USAID-funded Early Warning System 
expanded to 20 regions, allowing it to respond effectively to 
170 of 220 alerts and potentially preventing massacres, 
forced displacements and other egregious human rights 
violations. 
 
5. In FY 2003, eleven additional USAID-funded Justice and 
Peace Houses -- one-stop legal assistance shops -- were 
established for a cumulative total of 33, thereby increasing 
access to the justice system for a total of 1.8 million poor 
and marginalized Colombians.  DOJ has developed and 
implemented a multi-faceted strategy to strengthen the GOC,s 
capability to investigate and prosecute human rights cases, 
providing Colombian judicial police investigators, forensic 
examiners, and prosecutors with the necessary training, 
technical assistance, and equipment to enhance and upgrade 
their individual skill levels.  The strategy employs a task 
force concept, whereby personnel from 11 satellite Human 
Rights Units in the Prosecutor General\'s Office train and 
work together, resulting in a more effective case flow from 
the initial criminal investigative stage through final case 
resolution.  In 2003, the Office of the Prosecutor General 
conducted major operations against guerrilla and paramilitary 
criminal organizations, bringing charges for murder, assault, 
extortion, and drug trafficking.  In 2003, DOJ trained 840 
police assigned to rural outposts with little or no previous 
police presence; trained 400 police in accusatory system/oral 
trial techniques; and trained 172 prosecutors, judicial 
police, and judges in trial advocacy.  Also in 2003, 
specialized training and state of the art equipment donations 
enabled Colombian forensic labs to investigate human rights 
violations more effectively.  This included the enhancement 
of DNA analyzers and the CODIS database; upgrading of the 
Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS); updating 
of forensic imaging and document analysis systems; upgrading 
of the automated fingerprint identification system; and the 
design and installation of a wireless network providing 
inter-agency connectivity and information sharing.  Enhanced 
IBIS testing was used in an investigation in the department 
of Casanare to link nine separate homicides to the same 
weapon, resulting in the arrest of one suspect for four of 
the homicides. 
 
6. USAID\'s Peace Program underwent significant change and 
growth in 2003.  While it continued to support civil society 
initiatives to promote peace and conflict resolution, the 
program also developed a working relationship with Colombia\'s 
new High Commissioner for Peace to design and implement 
initiatives to support peace negotiations with illegal armed 
groups.  As negotiations began between the Colombian 
government and paramilitary groups, USAID provided advice 
regarding policy and programmatic parameters for a possible 
demobilization initiative.  Also in conjunction with the High 
Commissioner and Ministry of Interior and Justice, USAID 
established Peaceful Co-Existence Centers in three of the 
most conflict-ridden municipalities in Colombia.  These 
centers provided communities with a neutral space for 
dialogue, conflict resolution and social services. 
 
7. USAID\'s Local Governance Program, which works to improve 
the capacity of municipal governments to involve citizens in 
local decision-making, provide services, and manage resources 
effectively and transparently, supported the establishment of 
117 social infrastructure projects in 64 municipalities. 
These projects were administered through local citizen 
oversight committees that established project priorities and 
oversaw their management and financing.  In addition, USAID 
successfully completed a nationwide public awareness 
anti-corruption campaign that reached six million citizens 
through radio, newspaper, and television messages, and 
standardized internal control units in nineteen government 
agencies. 
 
8. DOJ and USAID worked to help reform Colombia\'s criminal 
justice system in an effort to accelerate the legal process. 
DOJ assisted the GOC in drafting a new criminal procedure 
code to move the system towards an accusatorial system.  The 
draft code is currently under consideration in the Colombian 
Congress.  DOJ and USAID organized joint accusatory trial 
technique courses for judges, prosecutors, police, defense 
attorneys and investigators.  DOJ funded visits for judges 
and legislators to observe the accusatory system in practice 
in Puerto Rico.  DOJ also implemented an instructors\' course 
at the Prosecutor General\'s training facility, which trained 
instructors to conduct their own courses in forensic 
specialties, basic investigative skills, trial techniques, 
interview techniques, and crime scene management.  Over the 
next three years, DOJ and USAID will assist the GOC in 
providing training to approximately 3,000 prosecutors, 1,000 
judges, 10,000 police investigators, and 1,500 defense 
attorneys.  In cooperation with the Colombian Justice Sector 
High Level Commission, USAID has built 27 trial courtrooms to 
complement the shift towards an accusatorial system. 
 
9. Although NGO statistics indicate kidnappings have dropped 
approximately 30 percent in 2003, kidnapping remains a 
significant problem in Colombia.  DOJ assisted the Government 
of Colombia in developing and implementing a comprehensive 
program to investigate and prosecute kidnapping and extortion 
offenses.  Six courses in the areas of Human Resources 
Intelligence Management, Racketeering Enterprise 
Investigations, Kidnapping Investigations and Ransom 
Investigations and Interviewing and Interrogation were held 
for 180 law enforcement, prosecutorial, and military 
personnel.  The intimidation of witnesses and judicial sector 
personnel is also a serious problem.  DOJ provided training 
and equipment for GOC protective force personnel in both the 
witness and dignitary protection areas, including personnel 
from the Bogota mayoral and other GOC ministerial security 
details. 
 
10. The ongoing armed conflict in Colombia has displaced 
approximately 2.2 million people since 1995.  The State 
Department,s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration is 
funding seven international organizations (IOs) and NGOs in 
Colombia that provide emergency humanitarian assistance such 
as food, temporary shelter, hygiene & household kits, 
psycho-social attention and health care to newly displaced 
persons.   USAID is also providing mid- to long-term 
assistance to displaced persons through seven IOs and NGOs, 
focused on economic reintegration of displaced persons where 
they reside, and a smaller but significant returnee 
component.  Program activities include productive projects, 
micro-credit programs, vocational training and job placement, 
health care, shelter, income generation, improved education 
and basic community infrastructure. 
 
11. Although labor union-related homicides and kidnappings 
dropped significantly in 2003, violence against labor union 
leaders and activists continues to be a serious problem. 
Through a grant from DOL, the AFL-CIO\'s Solidarity Center 
provided U.S.-based training and technical education to 
nearly 40 Colombian trade union leaders who were under 
threat.  DOL also funded an International Labor Organization 
(ILO) project designed to improve labor relations and 
generate quality employment for women.  A second DOL grant 
provided funding to the ILO\'s International Program for the 
Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC).  In 2003, almost 3,000 
children left their work in low-tech open-pit mines under an 
IPEC-funded pilot project.

SUBJECT: URIBE ON PARAMILITARY DEMOBILIZATION 
 
REF: BOGOTA 993 
 
Classified By: DCM Milton Drucker, Reasons: 1.5 B & D. 
 
1.  (C) In a February 4 meeting with Ambassador Wood and 
visiting U.S. inter-agency delegation, President Uribe stated 
that he was instructing his Administration to offer 
paramilitary leaders two options:  relocation to so-called 
\"concentration zones\" for those who agree to demobilize or 
prosecution (e.g., jail or death on the battlefield). 
Ambassador and DAS Peter DeShazo urged Uribe to neither lift 
the arrest orders on top paramilitary leaders, including 
Carlos Castano and Salvatore Mancuso of the AUC, nor attempt 
to change extradition laws (see para 3 reftel).  Uribe 
stressed he would not modify extradition.  Uribe added that 
if demobilized paramilitaries were to be given a temporary 
safe conduct in concentration zones they would need to be 
engaged in social service type activities.  Uribe noted that 
since he took office (August 2002), 3908 paramilitaries had 
been captured and an additional 435 had been killed. 
 
2.  (C) In a January 27 meeting with Ambassador and members 
of the Core Group (reftel), Peace Commissioner Restrepo had 
indicated that the GOC would not formally lift arrest 
warrants for paramilitary leaders, but intended to allow them 
freedom of movement in designated zones in order to 
facilitate demobilization (and OAS observation efforts). 
 
3.  (C) Comment:  Uribe is firm on his commitment not to 
touch extradition in the event of a collective paramilitary 
demobilization.  We will continue to work with the Uribe 
Administration to find a satisfactory way to deal with the 
issue of AUC members who already have arrest warrants. 
Additional items discussed in the February 4 meeting with 
Uribe will be reported septel.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, EAGR, CO, FTA 
SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR PREPARATIONS 
FOR FTA NEGOTIATIONS: ON THE RIGHT TRACK, BUT STILL A WAYS 
TO GO 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  During A/S Wayne\'s January 28-29 trip to 
Bogota, Colombian government and business leaders expressed 
strong support for an FTA.  They recognized, however, that 
they have a great deal of homework to do before they are 
ready to negotiate.  Moreover, they expressed concern that 
nascent outreach campaigns aimed at educating the public and 
Congress on the benefits of an FTA and building grassroots 
support are weak and need to be reinforced.  There are also 
many, mostly in the business sector, who believe that 
Colombia merits special concessions.  The more sophisticated 
attempted to link these calls with the need to develop strong 
legal alternatives for illicit narcotics production, but even 
this appears anchored in the concerns of agricultural groups 
worried about U.S. imports.  A/S Wayne made clear at every 
meeting that this would be a serious negotiation; that the 
more the negotiators understand their own country, the 
better; and that building a pro-FTA coalition at home is 
important.  He also stressed that an FTA is not a panacea, 
but an opportunity to help deepen reforms and increase growth 
as part of a sound economic development strategy.  Colombian 
leaders understood his message, which was also carried in a 
full-page interview in Colombia\'s leading economic daily. 
End Summary. 
 
The Perspective of U.S. Companies 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) U.S. company representatives were bullish on doing 
business in Colombia and offered suggestions on how to 
improve local preparations for FTA negotiations.  Energy 
sector executives praised improvements in security, noting 
that these improvements had made larger investments possible. 
 They agreed that an FTA would improve the business climate 
and benefit the extractive industry, but expressed a need for 
a more thorough public education campaign to dispel negative 
stereotypes surrounding free trade.  Representatives of the 
pharmaceutical and banking sectors stated that the GOC has 
not touted the successes of programs such as ATPA and ATPDEA 
enough, noting that the only people speaking up are critics 
-- namely, Agriculture Minister Cano (reflecting fear of 
large grain, rice, and sugar producers) and several members 
of Congress.  They added that the GOC also needed to be more 
aggressive in selling an FTA, noting that President Uribe has 
been silent on the issue over the past several months after 
mentioning it often, and underscored the need for the 
President to take up the FTA banner once more.  All agreed 
that the private sector could play a role in lobbying the 
legislative bodies of both countries and explaining the 
benefits of free trade. 
 
3.  (SBU) Ambassador Wood highlighted the benefits of an FTA 
and urged the businessmen to look beyond job creation and 
increasing the value of established exports and to focus on 
creating new industries.  He also stressed the importance of 
understanding the linkages and constituencies in both 
economies, calling on the companies to become actively 
involved in supporting an FTA.  The businessmen agreed, 
noting Colombia\'s excellent entrepreneurial potential, 
earnestness in resolving investment disputes, and readiness 
to proceed in an FTA, with or without Peru.  A/S Wayne 
stressed that Colombians must recognize the gains and new 
opportunities from freer trade and emphasized the need to 
continue judicial and financial structural reforms, even 
after an FTA. 
 
Trading FTA Points with Trade Minister Botero 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) A/S Wayne highlighted to Minister Botero and FTA 
Negotiator Ambassador Hernando Jose Gomez that a Colombia FTA 
is a priority and that negotiations would start in the second 
quarter.  He added that unlike ATPDEA, the free trade 
agreement would require commitments from both sides.  A/S 
Wayne urged Minister Botero to make this clear to the public, 
adding that the \"toughest negotiation will likely be the 
internal one.\"  Trade benefits would be limited without 
continuing structural reforms, the A/S said; framing an FTA 
as one part of an overall economic plan, he added,  places it 
in the context of other social and economic improvements, 
blunting criticism.  The A/S stated that the United States 
plans to begin negotiations with Colombia and Peru, and will 
then broaden them to include Ecuador and Bolivia.  Botero 
expressed concern the negotiations might be delayed if Peru 
was not ready to begin.  He added that the GOC had convened 
the negotiators from the other countries to begin 
consolidating their positions, and that Colombia would 
continue to take the lead. 
 
5.  (SBU) Botero said FTA opponents exist in congress, the 
private sector, and the media.  He is especially concerned 
about the opinion of the Catholic Church, as the power of the 
pulpit is still very strong in Colombia.  The government 
needs a concerted outreach effort, Botero said.  He added 
that Colombia is not competitive with U.S. grains and 
cereals, but would be very competitive in fruit and 
vegetables.  Adjustments in phytosanitary rules would also 
make them very competitive in poultry, dairy, and beef.  A/S 
Wayne pointed out that although the science of the rules 
cannot be negotiated, the goals are to streamline processes 
and foster greater transparency on both sides.  Botero 
underscored the social and political sensitivity of Colombian 
agriculture, saying farm workers who lose their jobs growing 
corn and rice are most likely to turn to illicit crops.  He 
stated that his government works well with USTR and looks 
forward to the negotiations, but hopes that other USG 
agencies might help USTR to develop positions that would take 
into account the political realities of Colombia.  A/S Wayne 
added that it is important to be very clear about such issues 
up front and to present a thorough analysis of these problems 
early in the process in order to assure the negotiators that 
they are legitimate and deserve attention.  Minister Botero 
ended by reiterating that Colombia is ready to proceed on an 
FTA, with or without the other countries. 
 
We will stay the course -- Finance Minister Carrasquilla 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
6.  (SBU) A/S Wayne met with Finance Minister Alberto 
Carrasquilla, Vice-Minister Juan Ricardo Ortega (soon to be 
Vice-Minister of Trade), and Director of Macroeconomic Policy 
Andres Arias (subsequently named Vice Minister of 
Agriculture).  A/S Wayne congratulated the financial team on 
Colombia,s economic growth and progress in resolving 
commercial disputes, and noted that free trade should be a 
win-win situation.  However, he stressed that an FTA must be 
part of a broader economic plan and will not bear fruit 
without serious structural reforms.  A/S Wayne also stressed 
the need to settle investment disputes and urged the Minister 
to promptly pay Nortel once that dispute has been settled. 
Carrasquilla responded that he understood and that the 
necessary funds would be available. 
 
7.  (SBU) Carrasquilla provided a comprehensive overview of 
the fiscal situation and acknowledged that liabilities 
outweigh assets on Colombia,s balance sheet.  Last year 
pensions and servicing interest on the debt alone cost 
Colombia roughly USD 9 billion of the USD 14 billion 
collected in taxes.  He explained that the Uribe 
administration remains committed to improving efficiency this 
year by increasing the tax base, eliminating special pension 
regimes and loopholes in the tax code, and decreasing the 
size of government.  Ortega added that with the loss of the 
referendum, the Uribe administration faces a tough battle to 
push cost-cutting and reform measures through a reluctant 
Congress.  He added that Colombia needs to repair local 
finances, but acknowledged that cutting transfers to regions 
would be politically difficult.  Carrasquilla expressed hope 
in the paramilitary demobilization and re-integration, noting 
that the GOC has budgeted sufficient funds to cover the 
process.  He added that demobilization may increase revenues 
as people move away from petroleum and gasoline smuggling -- 
a problem costing Colombia USD 300 million a year. 
 
Lunch with GOC Economic Officials 
--------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) The Ambassador hosted a lunch on trade issues with 
the Minister the Environment, Sandra Suarez, Presidential 
Economic Advisor Dr. Rudolf Hommes, Finance Vice Minister 
Juan Ricardo Ortega, and trade negotiator Hernando Jose 
Gomez. 
 
9.  (SBU) A/S Wayne and the Ambassador noted the importance 
of including environmental and labor considerations in an 
FTA.  Minister Suarez acknowledged this and spoke of the 
importance of sustainable development and of working with 
business.  Minister Suarez and Hommes also expressed doubts 
about the GOC\'s ability to change existing environmental 
legislation to meet the levels required in an FTA.  A/S Wayne 
and Mr. Manogue explained that the Chile and CAFTA FTA\'s 
primarily focused on enforcing existing laws.  Presidential 
Advisor Hommes then noted that there must be greater public 
education and discourse about the benefits of free trade to 
all sectors of society.  He added that there is great fear of 
an FTA in the agricultural sector in Colombia and agreed that 
the GOC must begin to talk to Congress and the media.  Ortega 
added that in order to gain widespread support, the GOC also 
needs to focus its educational efforts on the sub-federal 
level.  He added that support from local officials will be 
critical in winning Congressional backing.  In an op-ed 
published Feb. 2, Hommes focused on these issues. 
 
10.  (SBU) A/S Wayne stressed to the GOC that an FTA has to 
be part of a national strategy if it is to succeed, noting, 
for example, that it must be easier to start a business and 
be an entrepreneur in Colombia.  The GOC representatives 
strongly agreed, but expressed concern about getting the 
public to buy into changes.  Ortega stressed that an FTA 
could be a catalyst for change, but agreed with the A/S 
Wayne\'s assertion that an FTA is not an economic cure-all. 
Gomez and Hommes agreed the GOC needs to work with the 
private sector to prepare for the negotiations and will need 
even more support from businessmen to get an agreement 
approved by Congress. 
 
Colombian Business Leaders Say They\'re Getting Set for FTA 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
11.  (SBU) A/S Wayne met with the Presidents of Colombia\'s 
banking, agricultural producers, and exporters associations. 
According to Rafael Mejia, president of the national 
agricultural producers\' association, the sector supports an 
FTA, but he warned that illegal crops and armed groups make 
Colombia,s situation distinct from that of Chile and Mexico. 
 The cultivation of corn, rice, and cotton provides many 
rural jobs; as a result, the social and political impacts of 
an FTA are as important as the economic aspects.  The sector 
wants U.S. transition and reconversion funds as well as 
outreach to help Colombian farmers.  Patricia Cardenas, 
president of the national banking association, stated that 
her sector sees the FTA as a good opportunity for growth, 
employment generation, and the development of integrated 
capital markets.  Bankers are concerned, however, that U.S. 
banks locating branches in Colombia under an FTA would use 
their off-shore capital, giving them an unfair advantage over 
local banks with less capital.  Finally, national exporters 
association president Javier Diaz said an FTA provides a 
unique opportunity to boost Colombia,s legal economy and to 
deal a blow to the problems presented by narcotics and 
insurgents.  APTDEA has permitted the country to increase 
sales in new dynamic industries like textiles and shoes, 
lowering unemployment.  An FTA not only offers trade in goods 
but also more potential investment, which would help further 
reduce unemployment. 
 
12.  (SBU) The Colombian business associations said they are 
working to develop a single voice in the negotiations, and 
are planning to meet with their U.S. counterparts.  Entire 
sectors are not threatened per se, they stressed.  Rather, 
the threat is to individuals and firms that refuse to adapt. 
Part of the problem, the A/S agreed, is that people measure 
wins and losses against the economy as it currently exists, 
while in reality trade permits new economic actors to enter 
on the scene to create many more winners.  The business 
leaders also said the FTA promises to bring more 
sophisticated business practices as well as reforms in tax 
structures and investment.  A/S Wayne stressed that unlike 
ATPDEA, the FTA requires give and take, and should be just 
one part of a broad economic approach that includes 
structural reforms.  A/S Wayne also stressed that the private 
sector has a role in explaining the benefits to the public. 
 
Press Interview 
--------------- 
 
13.  (U) A/S Wayne\'s interview appeared in the February 2 
edition of Portafolio, the leading economic daily.  In the 
interview, A/S Wayne highlighted the same points that he has 
raised in his visits. He praised GOC efforts to date to 
restructure the economy and pave the way for an FTA.  The 
interview highlighted the need for the Colombian negotiating 
team to work closely with the private sector to identify 
important negotiating areas.  He also made it clear that the 
FTA was a negotiation, not a concession. 
 
Leading Economic Think Tank Positive on Colombia\'s Prospects 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
14. (U) A/S Wayne met with former Mining Minister and Central 
Bank board member Carlos Caballero, now of the leading 
economic think-tank, Fedesarollo.  After outlining the woes 
of the economy after 1998, Caballero painted a very bright 
picture of Colombia,s current recovery, with 3.4 percent GDP 
growth in 2003 and a projected 3.8 to 4 percent this year. 
Caballero noted that while productivity and efficiency have 
been increasing, job creation is slow and the average 
Colombian does not yet feel the recovery.   The government\'s 
top three priorities, he believes, should be to consolidate 
security gains, pass an effective structural fiscal reform, 
and to sign an FTA. 
 
15.  (U) Caballero said private investment grew 20 percent in 
2003 fueled by a construction boom, but added that further 
growth and new jobs will depend on signing an FTA. 
Colombia,s once significant trade with Venezuela dropped by 
half last year, only to be replaced by U.S. trade thanks to 
the time-limited ATPDEA preferences.  He added that it is 
critical that Colombia focus outwards, but explained that a 
national consensus does not yet exist because the priority 
has been on internal reforms.  Fedesarollo is now focusing on 
reforms in regional revenue sharing and the need to increase 
land taxes.  They believe military spending should be made 
more rational, and that reprogramming funds from other 
government agencies, especially the inefficient health and 
education budgets, will be necessary to maintain the higher 
military commitments under Uribe. 
 
16. (SBU) Comment:  The GOC is off to a good start on FTA 
preparations inside the government, but still has to do the 
hard work of building and cementing a pro-FTA consensus at 
home.  Uribe\'s popularity and high public confidence due to 
recent security and economic successes will help, but the GOC 
will need a careful analysis of sector by sector benefits and 
opportunities as well as ways to address potential \"losers\'\" 
concerns.  End Comment. 
 
17.  (U)  This cable has been cleared by A/W Wayne.

1.  (C) Summary:  In a meeting on February 6, WHA DAS Peter 
DeShazo and FM Carolina Barco discussed paramilitary 
demobilization and the OAS resolution on its verification 
mission, Colombia-Venezuela relations, and President Uribe\'s 
February 8-14 visit to Europe.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) At the February 6 meeting in Bogota, WHA DAS Peter 
DeShazo was accompanied by DCM Milton Drucker, AID Director 
Michael Deal, and poloff Brian Walch.  FM Carolina Barco was 
joined by Vice Minister Camilo Reyes (her deputy) and North 
America Director Francisco Gonzalez. 
 
3.  (C) On the subject of paramilitary demobilization, 
DeShazo stressed the need for accountability and truth, as 
well as justice for victims.  Barco reiterated the GOC\'s 
commitment to keep extradition on the table, and worried 
about striking the correct balance between peace and justice. 
 Barco expressed concern over Venezuela\'s intransigence on 
the OAS vote in support of a verification mission for 
paramilitary demobilization.  (Note:  Later the same day, the 
OAS voted to support the verification mission.  End Note.) 
 
4.  (C) On relations with Venezuela, Barco noted that they 
have been rocky.  She stressed President Uribe\'s and her 
desire to limit \"microphone diplomacy.\"  Despite friction, 
there have been two Uribe-Chavez summits during the Uribe 
Administration and continuing military dialogue at the field 
commander level.  Barco mentioned plans to have vice FM level 
meetings to manage border incursion incidents.  However, she 
lamented that defense minister meetings had not taken place. 
Turning to internal Venezuelan issues, DeShazo outlined U.S. 
policy and stressed the importance of the OAS and Carter 
Center in ensuring transparency in the all important 
signature verification process currently being conducted by 
the National Electoral Council.  Barco expressed complete 
agreement. 
 
5.  (C) Regarding President Uribe\'s February 8-14 visit to 
Europe, Barco stated that Uribe would carry the message that 
public security and human rights have both improved markedly 
during his administration.  Barco indicated Uribe would meet 
with ten prominent European human rights NGOs to explain his 
record.  Barco worried, however, that Uribe might receive a 
lukewarm reception at the European Parliament.

3.  (C) DeShazo welcomed Colombian military/police re-taking 
of Miraflores from FARC guerrillas earlier in the week.  In 
the context of paramilitary demobilization (see reftel), 
Ambassador and DeShazo stressed the importance of extradition 
and the need for justice for victims and accountability for 
gross human rights violations and narcotrafficking on the 
part of former combatants.  Regarding the planned OAS 
observation effort for paramilitary demobilization, FM Barco 
indicated she was lobbying counterparts to attain approval of 
the OAS SecGen\'s initiative. 
 
4.  (C) Uribe reiterated his pledge to wipe out coca 
production during his term (2002-2006).  He requested 
additional eradication flights and inquired about the status 
of pending aircraft.  McCarthy noted the full-steam pace of 
eradication efforts and was positive that four additional 
aircraft would arrive in approximately 90 days.  In addition, 
the U.S. goal was two AT-802 aircraft by June.  Uribe 
suggested additional efforts to dismantle the Norte del Valle 
cartel and called attention to two major groups of arrests in 
the last ten days.  Ambassador Wood told Uribe we are in the 
final stages of the draft Plan Colombia Phase II text. 
 
5.  (C) Turning to his visit to Brussels, Berlin, Rome, and 
Strasbourg (February 8-14), Uribe indicated he would carry a 
strong message to Europe.  He promised to stress his 
achievements on both the public security and human rights 
fronts.  Uribe was adamant that he would resist European 
calls for an unconditional humanitarian exchange of prisoners 
with the FARC.  FM Barco, in turn, expressed determination to 
defend the congressionally-approved anti-terrorism statute.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On February 4, an interagency delegation led by Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs Peter 
DeShazo met with a variety of GOC and U.S. interlocutors to 
discuss the status of the GOC\'s planning for disarming and 
demobilizing the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) 
and other paramilitary groups.  The delegation underscored 
that the U.S. had not made a decision on whether to provide 
financial support for the process, that any such decision 
would be made only after the GOC had finalized its 
demobilization and reintegration plans, and that any eventual 
U.S. support could only be provided consistent with 
applicable U.S. law.  The delegation examined GOC plans for 
organizing, monitoring, financing, and providing security for 
such a process.  Since mid-January, the GOC agencies involved 
-- particularly, the Peace Commissioner\'s Office and 
Ministries of Defense and Interior and Justice -- have been 
working to develop and implement a coordinated approach. 
Although it has made notable progress, including creating a 
ministerial-level committee to oversee the process and 
signing an agreement for OAS support and verification, the 
GOC still needs to overcome shortfalls in its long-term 
planning.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
The Inter-Agency Delegation 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) On February 4, an inter-agency delegation composed of 
WHA DAS Peter DeShazo, DRL PDAS Michael Kozak, INL DAS 
Deborah McCarthy, USAID Deputy Assistant Administrator Karen 
Harbert, and representatives from S/CT, SOUTHCOM, and OSD 
visited with GOC officials to discuss the GOC\'s plans for 
paramilitary demobilization.  Ambassador accompanied the 
delegation to meetings with: a Creative Associates 
International (CAI) team contracted by USAID to conduct an 
analysis of paramilitary demobilization/reintegration; High 
Commissioner for Peace Luis Carlos Restrepo; Minister of 
Defense Jorge Alberto Uribe; Minister of Interior and Justice 
Sabas Pretelt; OAS representative Sergio Caramagna, who will 
lead an OAS mission to verify and monitor the paramilitary 
demobilization/reintegration process; and a GOC inter-agency 
team composed of Vice Minister of Defense Penate and 
working-level officials involved in implementation.  The 
delegation also met with the International Organization for 
Migration (IOM), a USAID grantee that has been working with 
the GOC on the topic. 
 
3. (C) DAS DeShazo emphasized with interlocutors that the 
purpose of the visit by the interagency delegation was 
informational -- to learn from the GOC about its interagency 
planning for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration 
of paramilitary forces.  He stressed that the U.S. delegation 
was not in Colombia to offer assistance, negotiate anything, 
or make decisions, but only to evaluate the state of GOC 
planning.  He underscored the U.S. view that any 
demobilization and reinsertion process must include justice 
for the victims and accountability for the perpetrators of 
gross human rights violations and narcotrafficking, and 
stated that any U.S. support for a formal peace process with 
a group designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) 
by the United States -- in the case of Colombia, the AUC, 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and National 
Liberation Army (ELN) -- would have to be consistent with 
applicable U.S. law.  He also stressed that the U.S. will not 
drop its requests for the extradition of AUC leaders or other 
members of FTOs indicted now, or in the future, in the U.S. 
 
------------------------------- 
Organization: On the Right Path 
------------------------------- 
4. (C) Echoing comments previously made to the Ambassador, 
GOC interlocutors admitted they are only beginning to develop 
a coherent interagency structure to implement the large 
paramilitary demobilizations the Government hopes to achieve 
over the coming three years.  Minister of Interior and 
Justice (MOI/J) Sabas Pretelt, Minister of Defense (MOD) 
Jorge Uribe, and High Commissioner for Peace Luis Carlos 
Restrepo have formed a committee, overseen by President 
Uribe, to manage the multi-phased demobilization and 
reintegration process.  The Peace Commissioner\'s Office will 
be responsible for negotiations; the Ministry of Defense will 
provide security for paramilitary troop concentrations, 
oversee disarmament, and debrief former fighters; and the 
Ministry of Interior and Justice will manage reintegration. 
During the concentration phase, the Prosecutor General\'s 
Office (Fiscalia) will investigate former fighters to 
determine if they face criminal charges.  The Colombian 
Family Welfare Institute (ICBF) will be responsible for all 
child ex-fighters.  The National Registrar\'s Office and 
Department of Administrative Security (DAS, roughly an FBI 
equivalent) will provide legal documentation for former 
fighters.  A wide range of other GOC agencies, such as the 
Ministry of Social Protection, as well as local government 
institutions, will contribute services during the 
reintegration phase. 
 
5. (C) Peace Commissioner Restrepo noted that his office, 
which used to be responsible for the entire demobilization 
and reintegration process, including last year\'s 
demobilizations in Medellin and rural Cauca department, has 
begun to transfer responsibilities to the Ministries of 
Defense and Interior and Justice.  Although the new 
organizational structures are still developing, the CAI team 
noted that Colombia\'s relatively well-developed 
infrastructure and large supply of human capital give it a 
significant advantage over other countries, such as Sierra 
Leone or Guatemala, that conducted demobilizations with an 
essentially non-existent state infrastructure. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Confirmation, Verification, and Monitoring 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The GOC is exploring how to strengthen verification, 
including extending the so-called \"CODA\" process -- currently 
used in the GOC\'s individual desertion/reinsertion program -- 
to large scale demobilizations.  During CODA, a team of 
officials from the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior 
and Justice, ICBF, Fiscalia, and the Human Rights Ombudsman 
Office review all deserters to verify they were members of an 
illegal armed group and do not face major criminal charges. 
Individuals facing charges are turned over to the justice 
system.  Individuals who lie about membership in an illegal 
armed group, who are often displaced persons, are then turned 
over to the care of the Social Solidarity Network (RSS), the 
Government\'s displaced persons service agency.  Individuals 
whose status as former fighters is confirmed join the 
reinsertion process.  The CAI team recommends that CODA be 
adopted for large scale demobilizations, but recognizes that 
the program would have to be significantly expanded to 
accommodate the thousands of former fighters currently 
contemplated. 
 
7. (C) Ensuring that former fighters fulfill the terms of any 
demobilization agreement and do not return to serious 
criminal activities is one of the paramilitary peace 
process\'s greatest challenges.  Juan David Angel, a 
businessman recently tapped to revamp and manage the Ministry 
of Interior and Justice\'s reintegration program, noted that 
the best guarantee that former fighters not backslide is to 
offer them viable job and education options in civilian life. 
 Virtually everyone agreed that OAS verification and 
oversight of the demobilization process could significantly 
assist the Government to fulfill its commitments and add 
legitimacy and accountability to the process. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Finances: Shortfalls On the Horizon 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The GOC is not financially able to fund by itself a 
collective paramilitary demobilization, and is eager to 
receive assistance from the international community.  The 
Peace Commissioner\'s Office estimates that the cost of 
demobilizing and reintegrating approximately 20,000 
paramilitaries -- a number provided to the Office by the 
paramilitaries themselves -- between now and 2006 would be 
approximately USD 171 million.  (Note: Restrepo\'s estimate 
includes what the AUC describes as its support network.  The 
Embassy believes a more realistic estimate of AUC fighters is 
13,000.  End Note.)  The national budget will cover 
approximately USD 47 million, leaving a shortfall of USD 124 
million for which the GOC is seeking international assistance 
(ref A).  The Ministry of Interior and Justice\'s reinsertion 
program has a USD 7 million budget, enough to cover only the 
individual reinsertion program and only until April. 
According to Vice-Minister of Defense Penate, the Ministry of 
Defense\'s USD 7 million budget for its demobilization role is 
insufficient to handle a large scale paramilitary 
demobilization. (Note: Penate serves as the Executive 
Secretary of the ministerial committee overseeing the peace 
 
SIPDIS 
process.  End Note.) 
 
---------------------- 
Participative Security 
---------------------- 
 
9. (C) MOD Uribe assured the delegation he is committed to 
providing adequate security for any demobilization.  VMOD 
Penate was confident that the present level of security force 
presence, buttressed by hometown soldiers, rural police 
(carabineros), and radio-operated neighborhood watch systems, 
could provide adequate security in communities directly 
affected by demobilization.  He asserted that it is a 
misconception that paramilitaries provide security in areas 
they control, characterizing them as criminals who want to 
establish a monopoly on criminal activities. 
 
----------------------------- 
A Hypothetical Demobilization 
----------------------------- 
 
10. (C) DeShazo asked the group of working-level GOC 
officials to describe what would happen in the event that 500 
hypothetical paramilitaries announced their demobilization 
tomorrow.  Roughly, the process would be: 
 
-- The Peace Commissioner\'s Office would negotiate the terms 
of the demobilization and determine the location of the 
concentration zone.  An organization, such as the National 
Statistics Institute (DANE), would be contracted by the Peace 
Commissioner\'s Offce to conduct a survey of the former 
fighers to identify them and determine their background (age, 
education, etc).  To ensure that \"they are who they say they 
are\" they would have to produce their national identity card 
(\"cedula\").  They would be fingerprinted, as are all current 
defectors. 
 
-- Under the auspices of the Ministry of Defense, the former 
fighters would enter a concentration zone, turn in their arms 
to the military, and publicly sign documents renouncing their 
paramilitary membership.  The Fiscalia would begin 
investigating each former fighter.  All minors would 
immediately be turned over to the ICBF.  During this time, 
the Ministry of Defense would debrief the former fighters for 
intelligence purposes. 
 
-- All paramilitaries facing criminal charges would be turned 
over to the justice system and eventually dealt with in 
accordance with Colombian law, including the finalized 
\"conditional parole\" law.  The rest of the former fighters 
would enter the Ministry of Interior and Justice\'s 18 to 
24-month reintegration program. 
 
------------------ 
Conditional Parole 
------------------ 
 
11. (C) Peace Commissioner Restrepo asserted that the 
\"conditional parole\" (\"ley de alternatividad penal\") 
legislation will not prevent paramilitaries from being 
subject to extradition or Colombia\'s asset forfeiture law. 
Illicitly acquired paramilitary assets will be seized.  In 
addition, the legislation requires beneficiaries to donate 
licit assets to a victims\' reparation fund in an amount 
determined by a judge.  Restrepo noted that paramilitary 
commanders are not pleased with the draft legislation but 
that he has not negotiated its terms with them.  In his view, 
AUC leader Carlos Castano is the only commander currently 
willing to spend a limited time in prison.  (Note: The vast 
majority of rank and file combatants are not expected to face 
criminal charges.  End note.)  When asked why the AUC leaders 
would be willing to turn in themselves and their troops under 
these circumstances, Restrepo said that the only option was 
to increase military pressure on them. 
 
------------- 
OAS Committed 
------------- 
 
12. (C) OAS representative Sergio Caramagna explained why the 
OAS chose to support and verify the GOC\'s peace process with 
the paramilitaries (ref B): 1) Colombia has the largest 
conflict in the hemisphere, and part of the OAS\'s mission is 
to support peace and stability in the region; 2) the OAS 
views Restrepo as transparent, skilled, and committed to 
President Uribe\'s peace policies; 3) with two large-scale 
demobilizations planned for 2004, the GOC needs outside 
support immediately.  Caramagna noted that the OAS has 
extensive experience in supporting demobilizations elsewhere 
in the hemisphere (he worked for 14 years in Nicaragua), and 
that the OAS\'s interest in supporting Colombia has several 
precedents and has been well-publicized since November 2003. 
The delegation emphasized that the U.S. is fully supportive 
of the OAS initiative.  Caramagna welcomed the support and 
said he was working to persuade skeptical countries to back 
the agreement. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Working to Develop a Strategic Plan 
----------------------------------- 
 
13. (C) The GOC recognizes the need to develop a 
well-organized structure and long-term strategic plan for the 
demobilization and reintegration of the paramilitaries.  VMOD 
Penate asserted they could develop a written plan within 
several weeks.  The potential benefits of a successful 
process are clear: removing several thousand terrorists from 
the armed conflict, reducing the internal conflict from a 
three- to a two-front war, and offering an incentive to the 
ELN or FARC to enter into good-faith negotiations.  The plan 
developed for the AUC would, according to the GOC, be equally 
applied to the FARC and ELN.

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons: 1.5 B & D. 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Leftist Bogota mayor Luis Eduardo \"Lucho\" 
Garzon\'s first month in office was largely uneventful. 
Garzon has not attempted to steal President Uribe\'s 
limelight, and has been virtually silent on security issues. 
Instead, Garzon has talked up social issues.  Thus far, 
however, he has not implemented any new programs.  Garzon is 
acting in a far more responsible and measured fashion than 
many pundits would have predicted.  His pre-inauguration 
visit to Cuba, however, did make headlines.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) Garzon\'s January 1 acceptance speech was conciliatory 
and measured.  While recognizing his roots in the political 
left, Garzon described himself as all-inclusive and stressed 
\"I do not polarize.\"  Garzon offered to work with President 
Uribe on public security and promotion of rule of law.  He 
explicitly stated that Bogota was not an independent 
\"republic\" and that Uribe was the nation\'s president.  He 
promised new avenues for citizen participation and enhanced 
efforts to combat corruption.  Garzon also welcomed foreign 
investment.  Garzon criticized, however, Colombia\'s 
antiquated system of fiscal federalism, and promised to do 
more on the social side, in spite of tight finances.  He 
reiterated his campaign pledge to de-emphasize the \"day 
without a vehicle\" policy (established by law in an effort to 
reduce pollution) in favor of a \"day without hunger\" policy. 
 
3.  (C) In a February 4 meeting with poloffs, Garzon\'s 
private secretary (chief of staff equivalent), Edgar Ruiz, 
welcomed the recent formation of a pro-Garzon majority 
coalition in the city council and said it demonstrated the 
breadth of support for Garzon\'s socioeconomic agenda.  Ruiz 
noted that Bogota\'s finances are sound (with a very small 
deficit), a fact that would permit Garzon to offer additional 
spending on education and programs for the needy such as 
promised soup kitchens.  Ruiz added that Garzon\'s plan is to 
levy additional consumption taxes on the upper strata 
(telephone and electricity usage, for example) to provide 
extra resources.  Ruiz stressed that Garzon ceded public 
security issues to President Uribe and planned to focus on 
improving social conditions in Bogota. 
 
4.  (C) Garzon\'s pre-inauguration (late December) trip to 
Havana did garner headlines locally and internationally. 
Garzon advisor Daniel Garcia-Pena told PolCouns last month 
that Garzon\'s encounter with Fidel Castro was hastily 
arranged by the latter once Garzon was already on the island. 
 However, we have also heard the opposite.  Since taking 
office, Garzon has traveled only to Brazil to attend a 
municipal forum.  While there he also met with President De 
Silva.  According to Ruiz, Garzon hopes to visit the U.S. 
(most likely Miami) and Europe in either March or April. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  Garzon\'s first month was a smooth ride. 
Garzon is a savvy politician, and is cognizant of President 
Uribe\'s 80 percent approval rating and excellent marks on 
public security.  He is unlikely to make waves on that front. 
 While he is prohibited from running for president in 2006, 
Garzon certainly is interested in Colombia\'s highest office, 
and needs to have a strong record of accomplishment in 
Bogota, a generally conservative city.  He is fortunate to 
have inherited a city that benefited from a decade (two terms 
of Antanas Mockus and one of Enrique Penalosa) of efficient 
management.  He has also inherited some ongoing public 
infrastructure projects which he will be able to inaugurate 
while in office.  We expect him to put his nose to the 
grindstone, attempting to improve infrastructure as well as 
socioeconomic conditions for the impoverished masses on 
Bogota\'s periphery.  He will have his work cut out for him, 
considering Bogota\'s high unemployment rate and public 
education deficit (an estimated 100,000 local children are 
not in school).

SUBJECT:  AIR BRIDGE DENIAL: JANUARY 2004 PROGRAM UPDATE 
 
REF:  A. 2003 STATE 265910 
 
1. (U) Summary:  Following is the January Air Bridge Denial 
(ABD) activity report required by ref A.  There were over 
4800 tracks sorted, of which 42 were declared Unidentified, 
Assumed Suspect (UAS) Tracks, with one Phase I and one Phase 
III event during the month.  ABD program issues of concern 
include the availability and basing of interceptors.  End 
Summary. 
 
ABD Tracks 
---------- 
 
2. (U) In January 2004, over 4800 tracks were sorted, of 
which 42 were declared UAS aircraft.  The GOC did not react 
to 28 UAS, 17 due to non-availability of assets or proximity 
to borders, seven due to proximity to international waters, 
two due to the track information being dated or 
insufficient, and the remaining two were eventually 
identified as friendly.  There was an interception on 
January 5 that did not proceed beyond phase I due to 
collateral damage concerns. 
 
Phase II Event 
---------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) On January 24, a track was picked up by ROTHR near 
the Brazilian border in the Dog\'s Head area.  A Citation was 
airborne nearby and was sent to intercept; a Colombian Air 
Force (FAC) \"Arpia\" (UH-60 with Miniguns) stationed at Mitu 
was also scrambled for this event.  The Citation intercepted 
the aircraft and accomplished visual ID of a two-engine, low 
wing aircraft bearing what appeared to be Brazilian 
identification.  The target aircraft subsequently landed at 
Caruru where it was pushed to the treeline and concealed 
with a fake building, plastic tarps, and vegetation.  The 
Citation accomplished several Phase I calls with no 
response, then completed phase II calls before proceeding 
with warning shots by the \"Arpia\".  GOC officials assessed 
that there was minimal likelihood of collateral damage and 
proceeded with phase III, resulting in destruction of the 
aircraft. (Note: In the course of subsequent Colombian 
National Police reinsertion operations, NAS Officer was able 
to confirm destruction of target aircraft and absence of 
collateral damage.) 
 
Ongoing Issues 
-------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The FAC had deployed the \"Arpia\" helicopter to 
Mitu as part of the security package in support of President 
Uribe\'s visit the weekend of January 17.  This proved to be 
the decisive end-game asset that was not present during 
previous ABD events in the Dog\'s Head/Caruru area (there 
have been nine ABD events and numerous other tracks in this 
area since the ABD program was restarted in August 2003.) 
We expect the arrival of refurbished OV-10s to coincide with 
completion of repairs to the runway at Mitu.   Meanwhile, 
the GOC will retain \"Arpia\" helicopters at Mitu until OV-10s 
are deployed. 
 
5. (SBU) The GOC has repeatedly noted that the time required 
to perform Phase steps precluded bringing events to a 
conclusion.  For the January 24 Phase III, however, only 15 
minutes elapsed from request of ground Phase I to the target 
being destroyed.  This was accomplished despite repeated 
communications and an assessment of the possibility of 
collateral damage.  This event demonstrates that with assets 
properly located, the ABD required checklist steps can be 
performed in a reasonable time. 
 
6. (SBU) The Air Bridge Denial Semi-Annual Program 
Management Review (PMR) will be held February 24-25 at JIATF- 
S, Key West, FL.  Tentative program follows: 
 
-USG meeting

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ELAB, CO, PGOV 
SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN UNEMPLOYMENT AT SEVEN-YEAR LOW 
 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:  Reflecting the economy\'s 3.5 percent 
increase in 2003, Colombia\'s unemployment rate has fallen to 
12.3 percent, a seven year low.  Underemployment has 
increased slightly to 31.9 percent.  Unemployment continues 
to be a top issue among the public.  Some analysts, while 
praising the turn of events, see the new job creation as 
insufficient.  Others also question the quality of the new 
jobs.  The GOC understands these criticisms and is focusing 
efforts on export sectors that can generate more, and 
better-paying, jobs. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) According to the National Statistics Department 
(DANE), 1.2 million new jobs were created in Colombia in 
2003, bringing unemployment to a seven-year low of 12.3 
percent. The number of under-employed, however, rose 1.7 
percent to 6.6 million, or one third of the labor force. 
Unemployment in urban areas, where three quarters of the 
population lives, registered 14.3 percent in December 2003 
for the 13 largest cities, with a higher rate of 16.7 percent 
in Bogota. Urban underemployment dropped by 1 percent to 31.1 
percent, and DANE set rural unemployment at 9 percent. 
 
More Jobs, but More Underemployment 
 
3. (U) The majority of the increases came in the construction 
and service sectors. According to a leading labor think tank, 
Externado University\'s Labor Market Observatory, higher 
paying manufacturing jobs decreased 2 percent in 2003, 
leading to a 4 percent drop in wages overall.  The 
Observatory notes that the mining sector and utilities showed 
important productivity gains, but little new employment.  The 
Labor Market Observatory\'s director, Dr. Stefano Farne, 
acknowledged that there were new jobs, but challenged the 
number of new jobs the government reported.  Farne also saw 
the increase in underemployment as worrisome.  He pointed to 
a recent study by the Observatory that 67 percent of jobs are 
\"informal\" in Colombia\'s thirteen largest cities, meaning, 
among other things, they are not registered with the social 
security system. (Note: This can be explained by the fact 
that 65 percent of new jobs were created by small and medium 
size enterprises, defined to have less than 25 employees. 
Officially, any company under ten employees is considered 
informal. Therefore \"informal\" sector jobs may not 
necessarily mean illegal or sub-standard employment. End 
Note.) 
 
Unemployment Rates High Among Public Concerns 
 
4.  (U) In a poll of residents of the four largest cities 
published January 5 by leading weekly Semana, 40 percent of 
respondents rated unemployment as the most serious issue 
facing Colombia, trailed by corruption (29 percent), the 
security situation (24 percent) and narcotrafficking (5 
percent).  Sixty-one percent of the respondents said they 
were not working.  Other polls indicate President Uribe 
continues to enjoy high overall job ratings of close to 80 
percent.  His approval rating specifically for dealing with 
unemployment, however, runs at just 35 to 40 percent. 
 
Government Reforms Having a Positive Fffect 
 
5.  (U) One of the causes for the employment upturn in 2003 
was 2002\'s labor reform that reduced the cost of layoffs, 
inserted flexibility into the scheduling of the workweek, 
lengthened the number of hours covered under daytime wage 
regimes and reduced Sunday labor rates.  DANE estimates that 
labor costs overall dropped 5.7 percent as a result of the 
reform, while labor costs in the textile and chemical sectors 
were reduced by 15 percent and leather industry labor costs 
dropped by nearly a third. Both these sectors grew in 2003 as 
a result of ATPADEA.  This reform was originally expected to 
generate 300,000 new jobs, but the data now suggests upwards 
of 600,000 new jobs resulted. 
 
6.  (U) The minimum wage process has also had an effect on 
employment levels.  As of December 2003, the minimum wage is 
USD 126 per month, and it has not changed in real terms since 
1990.  While businessmen argue that the wage is high by 
regional standards, wages in export industries, such as 
textiles, mining and light manufactures are significantly 
higher.  The real impact of the minimum wage is in the 
services sector, where more workers are pushed into 
informality as the minimum wage increases.  The minimum wage 
is insufficient to meet the basic needs of urban workers, 
however, as reflected by a January 5 Semana poll indicating 
that only 16 percent of workers felt they could run their 
household on 1.5 times the minimum wage (US$184). 
 
7.  (U) The employment and job creation numbers are positive 
and reflect the success of labor reforms as well as 
ATPADEA-led export growth.  The GOC recognizes, however, that 
much more needs to be done and is focusing resources on 
export sectors since these sectors generally offer 
higher-paying jobs. The GOC is also looking to tighten its 
controls of the informal sector.

SUBJECT: GOC TAKING ACTION AGAINST PARAMILITARY CEASE-FIRE 
VIOLATIONS 
 
REF: BOGOTA 1198 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.5 (b) 
and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Since agreeing to a unilateral cease-fire in late 
November 2002, Colombia\'s major paramilitary groups -- the 
United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), Central Bolivar 
Bloc (BCB) and Eastern Alliance have committed at least 370 
murders, kidnappings, and other human rights violations 
nationwide.  They are also suspected of up to 1,500 other 
violations.  The AUC has committed approximately 120 
confirmed cease-fire violations, including nine massacres, 
and the BCB approximately 60, including nine additional 
massacres.  AUC political chief Carlos Castano publicly 
admitted that the AUC has violated the cease-fire, and said 
the only way to fully observe it in the context of ongoing 
conflict would be to concentrate all AUC forces in specific 
zones protected by the security forces. 
 
2. (C) The GOC recognizes that the cease-fire has been 
violated with frequency, and has therefore continued 
offensive operations against paramilitary groups.  Nearly 
4,000 paramilitaries have been captured and 450 killed since 
President Uribe took office in August 2002.  The OAS, which 
has agreed to verify and monitor paramilitary demobilization 
and reintegration, has said it will verify the cease-fire, 
but only after paramilitary combatants enter specific 
concentration zones.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
Imperfectly Observed Cease-Fire 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) As President Uribe acknowledged in his February 4 
meeting with DAS Peter DeShazo (reftel), the United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) and other paramilitary 
groups have not adhered perfectly to the cease-fire they 
declared in late 2002 as a precondition for demobilization 
negotiations with the GOC.  Vice-President Francisco Santos 
publicly criticized these cease-fire violations on February 
12 and emphasized that the GOC will not tolerate paramilitary 
violence.  According to the Presidential Program for Human 
Rights, the GOC has confirmed approximately 370 paramilitary 
cease-fire violations -- primarily murders and kidnappings -- 
that occurred between November 29, 2002 and February 9, 2004. 
 The AUC was responsible for approximately 120 violations, 
including nine massacres (defined by the GOC as four or more 
persons killed at one time).  The BCB, which also agreed to a 
cease-fire and eventual demobilization, was responsible for 
approximately 60 violations, including nine other massacres. 
The Eastern Alliance, an amalgam of various paramilitary 
groups operating on Colombia\'s eastern plains, was 
responsible for approximately 25 confirmed cease-fire 
violations.  Smaller paramilitary groups that did not sign on 
to a cease-fire were responsible for at least 12 confirmed 
human rights crimes during this period, including five 
massacres.  However, the GOC suspects that paramilitaries may 
also be to blame for as many as 1,500 other human rights 
crimes since November 2002.  Of these, the AUC itself is 
suspected of 650 crimes.  Although some of these violations 
involved clashes between rival paramilitary groups, most were 
directed at the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC), National Liberation Army (ELN), or non-combatants. 
 
4. (U) On February 16, AUC political chief Carlos Castano 
publicly admitted that the AUC has repeatedly violated the 
terms of the cease-fire.  He said a full cease-fire is 
impossible as long as the FARC continues offensive military 
actions, but emphasized that the AUC remains committed to 
demobilization.  Castano said the AUC will be in a position 
to abide fully by the cease-fire once its troops gather in 
concentration zones secured by the armed forces. 
 
5. (C) Despite paramilitary cease-fire violations, the 
overall level of paramilitary violence has fallen 
significantly since the cease-fires were implemented. 
According to the GOC, only 13 persons died in paramilitary 
massacres during 2003, compared with 54 in 2002 and 281 in 
2001.  In 2003, nationwide murders fell by 20 percent, 
massacres by 40 percent, kidnappings by 30 percent, and 
forced displacements by nearly 50 percent.  Although the 
security forces\' expanding presence throughout national 
territory has been the major factor in reductions in 
violence, we also attribute the drop in paramilitary 
violations to the cease-fire agreement and the general halt 
of paramilitary efforts to establish new areas of control. 
 
--------------------------- 
GOC Tough on Paramilitaries 
--------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Aware that the cease-fire has been repeatedly 
violated, the GOC has continued military and law enforcement 
operations against paramilitaries, including groups involved 
in negotiations.  Since Uribe took office in August 2002, the 
security forces have captured nearly 4,000 paramilitaries and 
killed almost 450 in combat.  These are increases of 164 and 
131 percent, respectively, compared to the last 18 months of 
the Pastrana administration.  By comparison, captures  and 
deaths in combat of guerrillas have increased 167 and 43 
percent, respectively. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Although the GOC continues to take aggressive actions 
against paramilitaries, it needs a concentration of 
paramilitaries in specific, controllable zones, to enforce 
the unilateral cease-fire.  The OAS has agreed to verify the 
cease-fire once combatants are concentrated.  The GOC is in 
the process of preparing, institutionally and financially, to 
implement such a large-scale concentration.  The Ambassador 
has denounced in the press paramilitary failures to adhere to 
their cease-fire commitment.  We will continue to encourage 
the GOC to maintain military actions against all illegal 
armed groups.

5.  (SBU) EMBASSY FEEDBACK AND INPUT ON EARLIER DRAFTS OF

IT IS CLEARLY A GOC DRAFT.  ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE 
DOCUMENT HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO WHA/AND. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
PLAN COLOMBIA: THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) THE GOC STRATEGY BEHIND PLAN COLOMBIA IS VERY 
SIMPLE: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SECURITY, AND PEACE ARE 
DIRECTLY LINKED.  THE PLAN ARGUES THAT STRENGTHENING THE 
CAPACITY OF THE STATE, ESPECIALLY THE MILITARY CAPABILITY, 
IS KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY NATIONAL PLAN.  THE WEAKNESS OF 
THE STATE IS AT THE HEART OF COLOMBIA\'S ILLS.  THE MAIN 
REASON FOR POLITICAL KILLINGS (SOME 3,500 PER YEAR FOR THE 
LAST 10 YEARS), KIDNAPPINGS, DISPLACEMENT OF OVER 3 MILLION 
PEOPLE SINCE 1985, AND ECONOMIC DESTRUCTION IS THE 
INTERRELATED NATURE OF THE COMBINED THREATS OF NARCOTICS AND 
TERRORISM AND THE INABILITY OF THE STATE TO ACT, BECAUSE OF 
A COMBINATION OF LACK OF RESOURCES, LACK OF POLITICAL FORCE 
AND THE DEBILITATING IMPACT OF A WEAK JUSTICE SYSTEM. 
 
7.  (SBU) PLAN COLOMBIA IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT 
ELIMINATING THE MONEY GENERATED BY DRUGS REDUCES THE WAR- 
MAKING CAPACITY OF ALL THREE ILLEGAL ARMED TERRORIST GROUPS, 
THEREBY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE AND ENHANCING THE 
PROSPECTS FOR PEACE.  ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT 
AS THESE ARMED THREATS TO THE STATE AND SOCIETY WERE 
ELIMINATED, THE FORCES OF PUBLIC ORDER (POLICE AND MILITARY) 
WOULD BE ABLE TO REGAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE ENTIRE 
NATIONAL TERRITORY, MAKING IT EASIER TO ERADICATE ILLEGAL 
NARCOTICS.  RESTORING SECURITY THROUGHOUT COLOMBIA WOULD 
ALLOW THE RULE OF LAW TO BE STRENGTHENED NATIONALLY AND LAY 
THE BASIS FOR INVESTMENT TO INCREASE INCOMES. 
 
8.  (SBU) PLAN COLOMBIA WAS AND IS AS MUCH AN ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIAL STRATEGY TO ENHANCE THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ALONG WITH A MORE FUNCTIONAL DEMOCRACY.  THE 
MILITARY COMPONENT WAS ONLY ONE OF THE PLAN\'S 10 ELEMENTS 
DESIGNED TO REINFORCE DEMOCRACY, FREE FROM VIOLENCE AND 
CORRUPTION.  PLAN COLOMBIA WAS ALSO INTENDED TO PROMOTE A 
MORE EQUITABLE GEOGRAPHICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF 
THE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE COLOMBIAN 
PEOPLE. 
 
9.  (SBU) THE IMPETUS FOR PLAN COLOMBIA EVENTUALLY LED TO 
THE URIBE ADMINISTRATION\'S ARTICULATION OF A COLOMBIAN 
NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY, QUOTE DEMOCRATIC SECURITY AND 
DEFENSE POLICY UNQUOTE, PUBLISHED IN THE FALL OF 2002.  THIS 
STRATEGY PROVIDES THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATION FOR LINKING 
THE NATIONAL MILITARY STRATEGY AND THE SUPPORTING SOCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC PROGRAMS NECESSARY TO BRING GOVERNANCE AND SECURITY 
TO THE PEOPLE.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS DEMOCRATIC SECURITY 
AND DEFENSE POLICY ARE TO: GUARANTEE THE SECURITY, FREEDOM, 
AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE POPULATION; CONSOLIDATE STATE 
CONTROL OVER NATIONAL TERRITORY; ELIMINATE DRUG TRAFFICKING; 
DEFEND DEMOCRATIC ORDER AND THE RULE OF LAW; PROMOTE 
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND SOCIAL EQUITY; AND RECONSTRUCT THE 
SOCIAL FABRIC.  THE URIBE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE PROGRESS 
ON EACH OF THESE OBJECTIVES.

PHASE II EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
-------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) AFTER THREE YEARS, PLAN COLOMBIA IS HELPING THE 
COUNTRY REVERSE 30 YEARS OF LARGE-SCALE DRUG PRODUCTION AND 
INTERNAL STRIFE.  THE GOC IS INCREASINGLY COMMITTED TO PLAN 
COLOMBIA, RAISING SECURITY SPENDING TO 3.8 PER CENT OF GDP 
IN 2003, WITH PLANS TO SPEND 5.8 PER CENT OF A HIGHER GDP BY 
2006.  THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY HAS HAD GROWING OPERATIONAL 
SUCCESS AGAINST NARCO-TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY, SECURING LARGE EXPANSES OF NATIONAL TERRITORY ONCE 
UNDER CONTROL OF NARCO-TERRORIST GROUPS.  A STRENGTHENED 
STATE IS ALLOWING PRESIDENT URIBE TO IMPLEMENT A QUOTE ZERO 
TOLERANCE UNQUOTE POLICY TOWARD COCA CULTIVATION THAT HAS 
REDUCED THE FLOW OF FUNDS TO ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS AND SHOWN 
THAT PLAN COLOMBIA\'S ERADICATION, INTERDICTION, AND 
ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS CAN MEET OR SURPASS THE 
ORIGINAL PLAN COLOMBIA\'S GOAL TO REDUCE COCA CULTIVATION BY 
50 PER CENT BY 2005. 
 
11.  (SBU) PLAN COLOMBIA\'S LONG-TERM INSTITUTION BUILDING 
ACTIVITIES HAVE HELPED COLOMBIA ESTABLISH SPECIAL HUMAN 
RIGHTS UNITS, REFORM THE CRIMINAL CODE, IMPROVE MONEY 
LAUNDERING AND ASSET FORFEITURE REGIMES AND PROTECT 
WITNESSES IN KEY CASES.  ACCESS TO JUSTICE HAS IMPROVED 
DRAMATICALLY, MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS HAVE 
BENEFITED COMMUNITIES, AND COLOMBIA\'S INTERNALLY DISPLACED 
POPULATION HAS RECEIVED ASSISTANCE AND ACTUALLY DECLINED BY 
46 PER CENT IN 2003.  ECONOMIC POLICIES STABLIZED THE 
ECONOMY, WHICH GREW BY 3.5 PER CENT IN 2003 AND INFLATION 
WAS REDUCED TO 6.5 PER CENT, LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR 
INCREASED GROWTH IN 2004 AND DOMESTIC INVESTMENT.  THE 
IMPROVED SECURITY SITUATION IS LEADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO 
TAKE A NEW LOOK AT COLOMBIA. 
 
12.  (SBU) PLAN COLOMBIA\'S ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE ARE 
IMPRESSIVE, BUT MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE.  COLOMBIA HAS 
NEARLY 35,000 MEMBERS OF ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS, WITH BETWEEN 
6,000 - 11,000 CHILD SOLDIERS.  COLOMBIA LEADS THE WORLD IN 
KIDNAPPINGS, WITH A POVERTY RATE OF OVER 60 PER CENT, AND A 
NOTORIOUSLY WEAK JUSTICE SYSTEM.  TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE MUST 
HELP COLOMBIA ELIMINATE LARGE SCALE COCA PRODUCTION AND 
COCAINE TRAFFICKING.  THE INFLUENCE OF ARMED GROUPS IN RURAL 
AREAS MUST BE ENDED DECISIVELY.  THEREFORE, SUPPORT FOR PLAN 
COLOMBIA MUST CONTINUE. 
 
13.  (SBU) THE GOC PROGRAM FOR PHASE II CONSISTS OF FOUR 
PILLARS: 1. FIGHTING TERRORISM, NARCO-TRAFFICKING, AND 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME; 2. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
REACTIVATION; 3. INSTITUTIONAL AND JUSTICE SYSTEM 
STRENGTHENING; AND 4. PEACE NEGOTIATIONS, DEMOBILIZATION, 
AND REINCORPORATION. 
 
14.  (SBU) THE GOC ESTIMATES THAT PHASE II COSTS WILL TOTAL 
DOLS. 7.2 BILLION, OF WHICH DOLS. 4.15 BILLION, 58 PER CENT, 
CORRESPONDS TO GOC RESOURCES AND DOLS. 3.04 BILLION, 42 PER 
CENT, IS THE REQUEST LEVEL FOR USG SUPPORT.  THE GOC PORTION 
ONLY INCLUDES OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT COUNTERPART RESOUCES, BUT 
DOES NOT INCLUDE LOCAL AND DEPARTMENTAL FUNDS NOR SUPPORT TO 
BE PROVIDED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND CIVIL SOCIETY.  THIS 
PHASE II PLAN IS DIRECTED TO THE USG, HOWEVER, THE GOC IS 
ACTIVELY COORDINATING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN 
SIX DONOR COMMITTEES AS PART OF ITS LONDON DECLARATION 
FOLLOW-UP. 
 
15.  (SBU) PILLAR ONE FOCUSES ON DEFEAT OF ILLEGAL NARCO- 
TERRORIST GROUPS BY COLOMBIAN POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES TO 
IMPROVE SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  DURING PHASE II, 
PLAN COLOMBIA WILL CONTINUE LOGISTICS SUPPORT, IMPROVED 
INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS, AND TRAINING FOR POLICE AND MILITARY 
OPERATIONS AND WILL ALSO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR 
PROFESSIONALIZATION OF CIVILIAN AND MILITARY PERSONNEL IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CONVENTIONS AND 
RULE OF LAW.  PHASE TWO WILL ALSO CONTINUE SUPPORT FOR 
ERADICATION PROGRAMS CARRIED OUT BY THE NARCOTICS POLICE AND 
INCLUDE TRAINING/SUPPORT FOR THE JUDICIAL POLICE. 
 
16.  (SBU) PILLAR TWO, SOCIAL/ECONOMIC REACTIVATION, WILL 
EMPHASIZE JOB CREATION BY BUILDING TRADE CAPACITY AND 
REFORMING POLICIES AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT.  LOCAL 
GOVERNANCE NETWORKS WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED TO STRENGTHEN 
COMMUNITY COHESION AND STATE PRESENCE. 
 
17.  (SBU) PILLAR THREE WILL STRENGTHEN DEMOCRATIC 
GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW - THE LINCHIPIN OF SUCCESS IN 
ELIMINATING THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF COLOMBIA\'S ILLICIT CROP 
PRODUCTION AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  PHASE II WILL EXTEND THE 
RULE OF LAW, INCREASE SOCIETY\'S CONFIDENCE IN JUDICIAL 
SYSTEMS AND CREATE A STABLE ATMOSPHERE FOR TRADE AND 
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. 
 
18.  (SBU) THE FOURTH PILLAR WILL SUPPORT A PEACE PROCESS TO 
ENCOMPASS ALL ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS AND LEAD TO THE 
SUCCESSFUL DEMOBILIZATION OF EX-COMBATANTS AND THEIR 
REINCORPORATION INTO COLOMBIAN POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND 
CULTURAL LIFE. 
 
19.  (SBU) MAJOR CHANGES IN PHASE II WILL BE: A. INCREASED 
EMPHASIS ON CREATION OF NEW EMPLOYMENT AND REACTIVATION OF 
THE ECONOMY THROUGH TRADE CAPACITY BUILDING TO EXPAND 
EXPORTS UNDER THE ANDEAN TRADE PROMOTION AND DRUG 
ERADICATION ACT, A NEW BILATERAL FREE TRADE AGREEMENT, 
NEGOTIATIONS FOR WHICH TO BEGIN THIS SPRING, AND THE FTAA; 
B. INCREASED EMPHASIS ON PEACE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL 
ENCOMPASS ALL OF THE ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS AND LEAD TO THE 
DEMOBILIZATION AND REINCORPORATION OF THE EX-COMBATANTS; AND 
C. A SHIFT TOWARD GREATER COLOMBIANIZATION OF THE DRUG 
ERADICATION EFFORT AND ADJUSTMENTS IN THE ERADICATION 
STRATEGY TO REFLECT THE SUCCESS OF AERIAL FUMIGATION AND 
CHANGING TACTICS OF NARCO-TRAFFICKERS TO CULTIVATE IN 
NATIONAL PARKS AND INTERSPERSE WITH OTHER CROPS. 
 
20.  (SBU) IN THE EMBASSY\'S VIEW, THE MONEY SPENT IN SUPPORT 
OF PLAN COLOMBIA HAS BEEN WELL SPENT.  THE GOC UNDER BOTH 
PRESIDENT PASTRANA AND URIBE HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE AND 
ACCOUNTABLE.  AS SENATE MAJORITY LEADER FRIST SAID TO A 
GROUP OF COLOMBIAN PRIVATE SECTOR LEADERS, \"THE U.S. 
GOVERNMENT HAS GOTTEN ONE HUNDRED CENTS FOR ITS DOLLAR.\"

SUBJECT: APPREHENSION IN URABA FOR AUC DEMOBILIZATION 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: On January 29, a USAID contracting team 
tasked to analyze the GOC\'s demobilization plans for the 
United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), USAID 
personnel, and poloff visited Apartado, in the Uraba region 
of Antioquia Department.  The GOC expects to implement an AUC 
demobilization in 2004 in Uraba, which has a heavy AUC 
presence.  Dario Mejia from the High Commissioner for Peace 
Office arranged meetings with the local military commander, 
Chamber of Commerce, a Church representative, a plantain 
farming cooperative, and a private security firm to hear 
their views on a potential AUC demobilization.  Many of the 
interlocutors expressed apprehension about the GOC\'s ability 
to provide security if the paramilitaries units in the region 
were to demobilize.  Much of the Uraba region has been 
controlled by the AUC since about 2001.  The area has been 
historically plagued by violence and instability until 
recently when murder, kidnapping, and other crimes decreased. 
 End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Uraba, which covers northern Antioquia Department and 
western Cordoba Department, is likely to be one of the first 
AUC demobilization areas in 2004.  The GOC\'s ability to 
provide legitimate state security and social services there 
could prove crucial to the peace process\'s continued 
progress. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Potential Security For an AUC Demobilization 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) General Paulino La Torre, head of the Army\'s 17th 
Brigade, which is responsible for Uraba and parts of Choco 
Department, acknowledged that there is public concern that 
the military and police will not be able to provide adequate 
security in the event of an AUC demobilization and that the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) will seek to 
re-take the region.  However, he is confident that his 
brigade is up to the task for the following reasons: 
 
-- A greater public security presence since President Uribe 
took office: there are now police units of approximately 40 
men each and hometown soldiers in all 13 municipalities, in 
addition to the permanent presence of three Army companies. 
La Torre noted that there are over 3,000 soldiers and police 
operating in Uraba.  When asked why this many soldiers have 
had problems subduing only several hundred illegally armed 
combatants, La Torre replied that: (1) the brutal 
intimidation methods used by both groups enables them to 
control large parts of the region with a relatively small 
fighting force; and (2) the region traditionally has had a 
small state presence, especially in the heavily forested, 
mountainous uplands. 
 
-- Violence in the region -- while still a major problem -- 
has decreased dramatically in the past year.  La Torre claims 
this is in part because the paramilitaries who operate in the 
area have largely obeyed the cease-fire agreed upon in late 
2002.  Data from the Vice Presidency\'s Office corraborates 
this assertion: of the approximately 370 confirmed 
paramilitary human rights violations nationwide since 
November 2002, only three or four have been in the Uraba 
region. 
 
4. (C) La Torre estimated that there are about 300 
paramilitaries in Uraba in three groups: Carlos Castano\'s 
AUC, drug trafficker Diego Murillo\'s (alias \"Don Berna\") 
forces, and the Central Bolivar Bloc.  These groups have 
dominated most of the region since about 2001 after several 
years of violent clashes with the FARC.  There are an 
estimated 150 FARC guerrillas, who have been pushed by the 
AUC into pockets of territory in the region\'s upland areas. 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
Community Representatives Skeptical 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Several members of the Chamber of Commerce said they 
were concerned about the consequences of a paramilitary 
demobilization.  Many acknowledged that they had personally 
been extorted, threatened, or had family members killed or 
kidnapped in years past by the FARC.  They said that the AUC 
presence had stabilized the region during the past four or 
five years, resulting in increased investment, especially in 
the banana growing areas.  They feared retaliation by the 
FARC if the paramilitaries were to demobilize.  They 
emphasized, however, that they are in favor of a paramilitary 
demobilization, but only if the GOC can guarantee a secure 
and viable state presence. 
 
6. (C) Father Leonides Moreno from the Roman Catholic church 
of Apartado supports all peace efforts, including the AUC 
peace process.  He acknowledged that an AUC demobilization 
would be complicated, especially in light of the region\'s 
widespread drug trafficking activity. 
 
7. (C) Dario Mejia from the Peace Commissioner\'s Office 
conducted a confidential question and answer session with 
about 20 plantain farmers to determine their views of 
security in the region.  Very few said that they had been 
directly hurt by the armed conflict.  However, about one 
third claimed that they did not think the GOC was capable of 
providing adequate security at the present time, suggesting 
that they feel that some other group -- most likely the AUC 
-- is protecting them. 
 
------------------------- 
Former CONVIVIR Confident 
------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Two managers of a private security firm that was 
founded ten years ago as part of the then-legal, 
state-sponsored self defense groups (convivir) expressed 
their opposition to all illegal armed groups, including the 
AUC.  The firm, which has about 100 employees, is willing to 
offer jobs to ex-paramilitaries, in an un-armed capacity.  It 
currently employees several former guerrillas.  The managers 
expressed confidence that the GOC would not leave the area 
vulnerable to attack from the FARC.  They also suggested that 
private firms, such as their own, could play an important 
role in providing security after an AUC demobilization. 
(Comment: In many respects the private security firms would 
be performing much of the functions now performed by the AUC, 
but presumably within a framework of law and without drug 
trafficking.  End Comment.) 
 
9. (C) Comment: Uraba illustrates a complicated conjunction 
of issues: (1) Citizen fear of violence, especially by the 
FARC; desire to return to normalcy; and lack of confidence in 
the ability, not the goodwill, of government forces; (2) the 
benefits, already in place of President Uribe\'s policy to 
strengthen the public security presence throughout the 
country; and (3) the complexity of the paramilitary problems, 
especially regarding the peace process.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/19/2014 
TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, CO, UNGA 
SUBJECT: UNHCHR REPORT ON COLOMBIA 
 
Classified By: Charge Milton Drucker for reasons 1.5 (b&d) 
 
 1.  (C) Summary:  The Office of the UN High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (UNHCHR) in Colombia is finalizing its report 
for Geneva on the GOC\'s compliance with its 27 human rights 
recommendations.   The report is likely to criticize the GOC 
for slow and uneven implementation of the recommendations and 
its refusal to implement two, or possibly three, 
recommendations.  Nevertheless, it will recognize that the 
GOC fulfilled one recommendation, accomplished substantial 
progress in another, and achieved varying progress in half a 
dozen others.  A group of foreign missions seeking to help 
the GOC fulfill the recommendations believes that UNHCHR\'s 
compliance assessment may give the GOC insufficient credit on 
several recommendations, and has encouraged the GOC to draft 
its own assessment for distribution in Geneva.  End Summary. 
 
 
2.  (C) The Colombia office of the UN High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (UNHCHR), under director Michael Fruhling, is 
putting the finishing touches on its evaluation of the GOC\'s 
compliance with 27 human rights recommendations made in the 
office\'s 2002 human rights report and issued in March 2003. 
The office will make public in early March its official 
report on the recommendations, prior to the UN Human Rights 
Commission\'s annual meeting in Geneva.  In meetings with 
foreign embassies, Fruhling has criticized the GOC for 
waiting too long to engage seriously on implementing the 
recommendations and for its uneven commitment to them.  The 
Ministry of Defense and Office of the Prosecutor General 
(&Fiscalia8) have been particular laggards, he maintains. 
Of the 27 recommendations, 20 are directed at the executive 
branch, four at the independent Fiscalia, and three at 
illegal armed groups.  According to Fruhling, the executive 
branch has fulfilled one recommendation, accomplished 
substantial progress in a second, achieved varying progress 
in half a dozen others, and rejected two or three. 
 
3. (C) Fruhling intends to propose in Geneva that the UNHCHR 
be given a mandate to develop a second set of 
recommendations, drawn from the current 27, that would guide 
his office\'s work for the next 12 months.  Colombian Vice 
president Francisco Santos, who has the lead on human rights 
within the GOC, would prefer to discard the current set of 
recommendations and replace them with more general goals that 
would allow greater operational flexibility.  According to 
Santos, the current recommendations place too much emphasis 
on taking bureaucratic steps and not enough on addressing 
fundamental human rights problems. 
 
4. (C) The European Union and some individual European 
countries have emphasized the need for the GOC to comply 
fully with the 27 recommendations, in some cases putting such 
a premium on compliance with the recommendations that they 
overlook real improvements achieved by the Uribe 
administration in reducing violence and human rights crimes 
in Colombia.  Many Colombian human rights NGOs critical of 
Uribe and his Government have vociferously advanced the view 
that the GOC\'s uneven compliance with the recommendations 
demonstrates a lack of commitment to human rights. 
 
5. (C) To assist the GOC with the implementation of the 
recommendations, seven embassies accredited to Colombia -- 
Brazil, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK 
and the U.S. -- have formed an informal working group known 
locally as the G-7.  Over the last two months, G-7 
representatives have met with Fruhling and Santos, both 
separately and together.  Predictably, these meetings have 
highlighted differences between the GOC\'s and UNHCHR\'s 
assessments of the Government\'s compliance with several of 
the recommendations. 
 
6. (C) Although Fruhling has declined to share an advanced 
draft of his report to Geneva with G-7 ambassadors, he 
provided the following oral snapshot to them on February 13: 
 
--The GOC has fulfilled the recommendation on anti-personnel 
mines (13). 
 
--The GOC has achieved significant progress in improving the 
effectiveness of the Early Warning System (1). 
 
--The GOC has made some, but still insufficient, progress in: 
protecting human rights defenders (2); increasing protection 
for communities at risk (4); implementing human rights 
training at the Ministry of Defense (8); and improving the 
public security forces\' adherence to international 
humanitarian law (12).   (Note: The Embassy believes the 
UNHCHR report will give insufficient weight to the 
Government\'s extension of state presence throughout the 
country and success at reducing key indicators of violence, 
including against human rights defenders and communities at 
risk.  Virtually all the G-7 ambassadors criticized Fruhling 
for not giving the GOC more credit for the Ministry of 
Defense\'s human rights training.  Public security personnel 
continue to commit only a small fraction of human rights 
violations.  End note.) 
 
--The GOC has not assigned personnel from the Inspector 
General\'s (\"Procuraduria\") and Ombudsman\'s (\"Defensoria\") 
offices to all conflictive areas (5), although international 
funding had helped the GOC assign such personnel to many 
remote and problematic regions.  (Note: Fruhling gives the 
GOC insufficient credit for having representatives of the 
Ombudsman\'s office in all 33 of Colombia\'s departments.  End 
note.) 
 
--The Vice President has established a Special Committee (20) 
to advance investigations and prosecutions in select human 
rights cases, but progress in closing cases has been too 
slow.  (Note: The GOC had significantly advanced six of the 
one-hundred cases by the end of 2003, and hopes to have 
advanced another 15 cases by the end of February.  End note.) 
 
--Although the GOC is negotiating with several paramilitary 
organizations, neither the FARC nor the ELN are prepared to 
enter into dialogue with the Government.  It is essential 
that the GOC\'s negotiations with illegal armed groups be 
guided by principles of truth, justice, and reparations (14). 
 
--The Inspector General (\"Procuraduria\") has not taken 
disciplinary actions against all state employees who in any 
way jeopardized the work of human rights defenders (6).  In 
this regard, some public pronouncements from senior GOC 
officials have been unhelpful. 
 
--Although President Uribe has been clear on the need to 
sever the public security forces\' links with paramilitaries 
(21), more actions need to be taken 
 
--The GOC has begun preparing a national plan of action on 
human rights (23), but has not given local governments and 
key sectors of society (read human rights NGOs) necessary 
input. 
 
--There have been positive discussions with the Ministry of 
Education on incorporating human rights education in the 
national curriculum (24) and providing human rights training 
to judicial entities (25), but little concrete progress has 
been achieved. 
 
--Although the Vice President\'s Office has worked 
productively with UNHCHR, the GOC as a whole has not taken 
sufficient advantage of the office\'s human rights expertise 
(26 and 27). 
 
--The GOC faces a major challenge in developing policies to 
narrow the economic inequality gap in Colombia (22). 
 
--The Ministry of Defense is resisting the requirement to 
suspend from duty public security force personnel implicated 
in serious human rights violations (19) by relying on what 
Fruhling believes is an erroneous reading of relevant legal 
codes. 
 
--The GOC made it clear, at the July 2003 London Conference 
and subsequently, its disagreement with recommendations 
calling for it not to adopt anti-terrorism legislation giving 
the military arrest powers (15) and for the independent 
Inspector General\'s Office (\"Procuraduria\") to inspect 
military intelligence files on human rights defenders and 
publish the results (7).  Fruhling maintains that the GOC 
agreed to these recommendations in March 2003 at Geneva, and 
is therefore bound.   (Note:  The Colombian Congress approved 
an anti-terrorism statute in December and will consider 
implementing legislation next session.   The UNHCHR is 
exploring with the Defense Ministry a possible compromise on 
the review of military intelligence files.  End note.) 
 
--The Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\") only signed in 
November an agreement to work with UNHCHR, so no concrete 
results have been achieved on recommendations 3, 16, 17, and 
18. 
 
7. (C) During the past week, however, a majority of G-7 
representatives concluded at meeting with Fruhling that 
UNHCHR gives the GOC insufficient credit for compliance with 
some of the recommendations and that in others it demands 
that the GOC go beyond the language of the recommendations. 
In particular, the Dutch and Swedish Ambassadors, who are 
among the most conspicuous champions of human rights within 
the local diplomatic community, openly questioned whether 
Fruhling has been excessively demanding in his assessments of 
GOC compliance. 
 
8. (C) On February 18, Vice President Santos met with G-7 
ambassadors and excoriated the draft report Fruhling had 
shown him.  He said that the report was highly inaccurate in 
key sections; the GOC could accept damning assessments, but 
they should at least be accurate.  Santos claimed that he 
\"did not know how to show the draft report to President 
Uribe.\"  He asked for advice. 
 
9.  (C) The Brazilian ambassador urged Santos to produce a 
GOC drafted human rights report, noting progress where 
warranted but admitting shortfalls, for the UN Human Rights 
Committee meeting in Geneva.  She was supported by the other 
G-7 ambassadors present.  The G-7 group then met at the Swiss 
embassy without Santos and came to the same conclusion.  No 
one had much confidence, including the Swedish ambassador, 
that Fruhling would modify his report before sending it as a 
draft to Geneva. Subsequently, the Swedish ambassador 
privately indicated to us that he is considering recommending 
that the GOS question the draft report\'s assessments in 
Geneva -- which would be a surprising development, given that 
Fruhling is a former Swedish diplomat. 
 
10. (C) Comment: The more critical stance of the G-7 
ambassadors regarding certain aspects of the UNHCHR Colombia 
office\'s report may not translate into a willingness to 
criticize it in Geneva.  It has, however, put Fruhling on 
notice that he runs such a risk.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: THE LAST COLOMBIAN MUNICIPALITY WITHOUT A PUBLIC 
SECURITY PRESENCE RECEIVES A POLICE DETACHMENT 
 
REF: BOGOTA 1187 
 
1. (SBU) On February 12, the GOC reinstalled police forces in 
Murindo, Antioquia department, a region in Uraba that has 
long lacked a public security presence.  Murindo was the last 
of Colombia\'s 1,098 municipalities (equivalent to a U.S. 
county) to receive a public security force -- completing a 
major goal of the Uribe Administration.  When Uribe assumed 
office, 158 municipalities had no public security presence. 
Colombian Armed Forces Commander General Carlos Ospina, who 
was the commander in the region when Murindo fell to the FARC 
and was wounded when his helicopter was shot down in a failed 
operation to retake it, flew into the area for the 
reoccupation in the lead helicopter. 
 
2. (SBU) Murindo is located near the Antioquia/Choco 
departmental border in northwestern Colombia, astride a 
mobility corridor from the lowlands to the mountains, and is 
also close to the Atrato River, which has been a lucrative 
drug and arms trafficking route for the FARC and 
paramilitaries.  The region has been a staging area for many 
terrorist operations in recent years.  One of the most tragic 
attacks came in 2002 when 119 people who had taken refuge in 
a church in Bellavista, in nearby Bojaya municipality, were 
killed by a FARC-launched gas cylinder bomb that struck the 
building.  The operation in Murindo is part of an ongoing GOC 
effort to reassert its control over the length of the Atrato 
River.  In May 2003, the Colombian Navy deployed a heavily 
armed 120-foot barge along the waterway. 
 
3. (SBU) The Murindo reinsertion comes on the heels of the 
February 7 Colombian Armed Forces and Police\'s successful 
completion of joint operations in the southeastern 
municipalities of Miraflores, Caruru, and Taraira, which 
secured the GOC airfields and key forward bases of operation. 
 These reinsertions included U.S.-trained and funded Police 
Junglas and Carabinero Squadrons, the latter of which will 
remain to reinforce standard police units.  President Uribe 
and the Minister of Defense have insistently prodded the 
public security forces to conduct joint operations; the 
recent municipal reinsertions are excellent examples.

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons: 1.5 B & D. 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Poloff visited Colombia\'s vibrant second 
city, Medellin, February 11-12.  National Police commander 
Ruben Carrillo noted a continued downward trend in violent 
crime and a lack of recidivism on the part of reinserted 
former paramilitary fighters.  Mayor Sergio Fajardo 
complained that the GOC lacked a coordinated plan to 
effectively implement reinsertions and did not provide 
Medellin with adequate resources for the task.  Archbishop 
Alberto Giraldo was cautiously optimistic about an accord 
with the ELN guerrilla group but was pessimistic about 
negotiating with the FARC.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) National Police (CNP) Brigadier General Ruben 
Carrillo, who assumed the post of Medellin division commander 
in November 2003, highlighted that February 10 had been the 
first day under his watch that no homicide had occurred in 
the metropolitan area.  He said that virtually all forms of 
violent crime--with the exception of armed robberies of small 
businesses--continued to decline on a monthly basis. 
Carrillo cited excellent police-military cooperation and 
ongoing joint sweeps (large scale arrests) as keys in the 
dismantling of local guerrilla and paramilitary networks. 
Regarding the nearly 900 locally \"reinserted\" former fighters 
of the AUC paramilitary group\'s Cacique Nutibara Bloc, 
Carrillo stated that to date only four had been arrested on 
charges of carrying an illegal weapon. 
 
3.  (C) Archbishop Alberto Giraldo, a member of the Church\'s 
National Conciliation Commission (CCN), expressed cautious 
optimism about the potential for a peace accord with the ELN 
guerrilla group.  He was skeptical, however, with regard to 
dialogue with the FARC.  Giraldo noted that UN Special Envoy 
James LeMoyne had been unable to start discussions with the 
FARC, claiming that LeMoyne felt \"used\" by the guerrilla 
group.  Giraldo called attention to the final statement of 
the early February annual meeting of the Colombian Episcopal 
Conference.  The bishops announced that all individual Church 
contacts with illegal groups were undertaken in the name of 
the Church as a whole.  Giraldo expressed satisfaction that 
violence against church officials and lay workers was down 
substantially in the past year, with the notable exception of 
the dioceses of Arauca (Arauca) and Tibu (Norte de Santander). 
 
4.  (C) Medellin Mayor Sergio Fajardo, a University of 
Wisconsin mathematics Ph.D. and a relative political novice, 
said the first reinsertion of former paramilitary fighters 
had been a success, but worried that the national government 
did not have a coordinated plan to organize and finance 
additional demobilizations.  Regarding national peace process 
issues, Fajardo felt that the conditional parole bill 
currently in the Congress was likely to pass.  When asked how 
local residents viewed negotiations with former fighters, 
Fajardo opined that the vast majority of Medellin residents 
would accept less on the punishment scale were it to 
guarantee an end to the conflict.  He stressed, however, that 
he did not plan to speak out nationally on peace process 
issues.  (Comment:  Nevertheless, on February 15, Fajardo\'s 
government secretary, Alonso Salazar, publicly called for 
truth commissions and reparations by former fighters involved 
in the Medellin process.  GOC Peace Commissioner Restrepo 
dismissed the call for truth commissions as \"populist\" and 
urged the Medellin government to work more closely with the 
GOC to implement a community-based reparation program.  End 
Comment.) 
 
5.  (C) Fajardo planned to focus on job creation and 
improving education and infrastructure.  He worried, however, 
that Medellin\'s traditional political elite would attempt to 
stymie his social agenda.  Fajardo hails from a well-known 
local family, and was education secretary during part of 
then-Antioquia governor Alvaro Uribe\'s administration.  He 
ran his mayoral campaign, however, as a political outsider by 
using the leftist \"Indigenous Social Alliance\" banner. 
Fajardo expressed respect for and friendship with Bogota 
Mayor Luis Eduardo Garzon, but stressed that he was not a 
member of Garzon\'s Polo Democratico Independiente 
(Independent Democratic Party).  He was appreciative of 
ongoing USAID-financed democracy, transparency, and human 
rights programs in Medellin. 
 
6.  (C) Antioquia Governor Anibal Gaviria, who has no formal 
involvement in peace process issues, talked up potential 
foreign investment.  He was particularly interested in 
promoting the timber industry.  On the social side, he hoped 
to redouble the department\'s youth nutrition program, which 
he described as a model for Latin America.  He lamented  that 
in spite of the prosperous picture painted by Medellin, some 
three million of Antioquia\'s five million residents lived in 
poverty, with one million in extreme poverty.  (Comment: 
Gaviria\'s brother, Guillermo, the previous governor, was 
kidnapped by the FARC in 2002 and assassinated during a 
botched GOC rescue attempt in May 2003.  Gaviria\'s rivals 
have launched a legal challenge to his election, arguing that 
Colombian law prevents a blood relative from subsequently 
holding the same office, unless the incumbent steps down one 
year prior to the election.  Our interlocutors are mixed in 
their predictions as to how the courts might rule.  End 
Comment.)

AGRICULTURAL IMPORT SYSTEM  WILL BE INCLUDED IN FTA 
NEGOTIATIONS 
 
Sensitive but unclassified -- please protect accordingly. 
 
1.   (SBU)  Summary. On February 16, 2004, the Colombian 
government implemented a new import system that provides 
tariff reductions for importers that purchase domestic 
production of corn (both white and yellow), grain sorghum, 
rice, soybeans and cotton.  The new system replaces the 
restrictive import licensing and domestic purchase 
requirements that were maintained for a wide range of 
agricultural products (including poultry, wheat, corn, 
barley, rice and oilseeds) under a WTO waiver that expired at 
the end of 2003.  Trade Minister Botero acknowledged at a 
February 23 meeting that the new system was not fully trade 
liberalizing, but emphasized that this was as far as the GOC 
could go at this time.  He added that the new system would be 
subject to discussion during the FTA negotiations. 
End Summary. 
 
2.    (SBU)  Trade Minister Botero met with Ambassador Wood 
on February 23 to discuss Colombia\'s new import system for 
six agricultural products (white and yellow corn, grain 
sorghum, rice, soybeans and cotton) formerly protected by 
restrictive import licensing requirements.  The voluntary 
system, implemented February 16, 2004, provides tariff 
reductions for importers that purchase local production and 
replaces a more restrictive system that required importers to 
demonstrate purchases of local production for a wide range of 
products (including poultry, wheat, corn, barley, rice and 
oilseeds) before they were authorized imports.  Colombia was 
obligated to dismantle the previous system when the waiver it 
had in the WTO expired on December 31, 2003.  Out-going Trade 
Vice Minister Claudia Uribe (soon to be Colombia\'s Ambassador 
to the WTO), Agriculture Vice Minister Andres Arias, Lead FTA 
Negotiator Amb. Hernando Jose Gomez and Ag negotiator Ricardo 
Torres also participated in the meeting.  AGATT and Econcouns 
accompanied the Ambassador. 
 
The New System 
-------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  On February 16, the Ministry of Commerce Industry 
and Tourism published decree 430 establishing the Public 
Mechanism for Administration of Agricultural Quotas. As 
explained by Vice Ministers Uribe and Arias, the new, 
voluntary system will establish tariff-rate quotas (TRQ\'s) 
based on historical import levels for white and yellow corn, 
grain sorghum, soybeans, rice and cotton.  The TRQ levels 
will then be auctioned off at the existing Agricultural 
Commodities Board.  The bids must state the ratio of imports 
to domestic purchases that will be made by each importer. 
Those offering to purchase the most domestic production will 
win the right to purchase the imports bid at a reduced tariff 
rate, determined by a mathematical algorithm based on the 
ratio of domestic purchases to imports offered.  Imports 
beyond the TRQ are allowed, but face the general tariff rate 
(the Andean price band duty for corn, sorghum, and soybeans), 
and the MFN tariff rate for cotton (10 percent) and rice (80 
percent - the tariff was raised from 20 percent in December 
2003).  The Vice Ministers also presented copies of the new 
decree as well as a GOC analysis of the new program (faxed to 
the desk). 
 
GOC Rationale for New System 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Minister Botero defended the new system as 
WTO-consistent because it eliminated previous absorption 
requirements and lowered the number of products benefited 
from 75 to 6.  He added that the new system was a transition 
to a more market-oriented approach, while acknowledging that 
the new system stopped short of free trade.  He then stated 
flatly that it was the best the GOC could do at this juncture 
given the political realities it faced.  Botero and Vice 
Minister Uribe both pointed out that the new system decreased 
the protection for some sectors, such as rice, where the 
previous combination of a small quota and restrictive import 
licensing requirements closed the sector to imports.  They 
also added that the products protected were the most 
politically sensitive in agriculture.  The new mechanism was 
a way to bring these protected sectors partially into the 
free market and thus prepare them for eventual free trade 
under an FTA. 
 
The system is open for negotiation under the FTA 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5.  (SBU)  The Ambassador stated that we would review the new 
GOC policy, but noted that upon initial inspection it seemed 
that the GOC had created a new protective mechanism to 
replace a more restrictive one that had expired.  While 
noting that reducing the universe of items covered by the new 
system from 75 to 6 was indeed a positive step, the six 
remained protected and we had some questions about the WTO 
consistency of the new program.  The Ambassador added that 
taking such a measure, as well as increasing certain 
agricultural tariffs in late 2003, did not send a positive 
message about Colombia\'s willingness to open its markets on 
the eve of our FTA negotiations. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Minister Botero explained that he had requested 
this meeting to establish Colombia\'s good faith as a 
negotiating partner.  His intent was to explain the new 
system and highlight that it was a transitional measure aimed 
at introducing the market into previously protected areas. 
Botero repeated on several occasions that the new system was 
open to negotiation during FTA talks.  He added that the FTA 
talks would provide him the political cover to dismantle the 
protection that these sectors currently enjoyed.  In a 
negotiation, he would be able to open up these sectors by 
balancing those concessions with benefits gained.  Botero 
reiterated his personal commitment to liberalizing trade and 
underscored that the negotiating table would give him the 
political legitimacy to open up the Colombian economy. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Comment.  The political pressures Botero mentioned 
are real.  Both he and Vice Minister Uribe emphasized 
repeatedly that this was not a carefully planned move to 
raise protection on the eve of negotiations, but an effort to 
open up the heavily protected agricultural sector as much as 
the political atmosphere would bear.  The new system is, in 
fact, an improvement over the previous restrictive mechanism 
that expired.  Botero,s commitment to discuss this issue at 
the negotiating table is real, as is the assertion that 
negotiations provide him political cover to do so.  End 
Comment.

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood.  Reasons: 1.5 B & D. 
 
---------- 
Solidarity 
---------- 
 
1.  (U) Spanish President Jose Maria Aznar came to Colombia 
to express his solidarity with President Alvaro Uribe\'s fight 
against terrorism and to underscore Spanish assistance to 
Colombia.  He also addressed a forum on Democracy and 
Development in Latin America, organized by the International 
Foundation for Freedom and chaired by Peruvian writer Mario 
Vargas Llosa.  During the two-day visit to Cartagena, Aznar 
expressed support for President Uribe\'s Democratic Security 
Strategy and noted that both countries were effectively 
fighting terrorism.  Aznar said he would urge the European 
Union to place Colombia\'s National Liberation Army (ELN) 
guerrillas on the EU\'s terrorist list. 
 
---------------------- 
Development Assistance 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Speaking from a 17th Century convent restored with 
Spanish assistance, Aznar noted that Spain is Europe\'s top 
donor to Colombia.  At a joint press conference, Uribe 
announced that Spain\'s Development Assistance Fund would 
finance a USD 62 million electrification project along 
Colombia\'s impoverished Pacific coast, along with other 
development assistance.  Aznar added that Colombia receives 
more in micro-credit programs than any other country in Latin 
America.  Responding to a question about Spanish tourism in 
Colombia, he reiterated the security theme, stating that 
tourism would increase as terrorism is reduced. 
 
----------------------------- 
Military Assistance and Sales 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) Aznar and Uribe announced the donation of two Caza 
aircraft to be used for military transport.  The two turned 
aside questions about the GOC Air Force\'s refusal to accept 
an earlier offer of Mirage jets and the possible donation of 
tanks.  Subsequently, GOC MINDEF Jorge Uribe announced the 
imminent purchase of approximately 40 used AMX-30 tanks from 
Spain.  The MINDEF said that the army would deploy the tanks 
exclusively to fight internal narco-terrorism in the 
non-border states of Bolivar, Cordoba, Sucre, Atlantico, and 
Magdalena.  Senator Rafael Pardo, a former MINDEF, was quick 
to criticize the decision, arguing that the tanks were 
inappropriate for fighting any internal or external enemy 
other than Venezuela.  He concluded that the purchase would 
create new economic, political, and military problems without 
solving existing ones. 
 
--------------------- 
Other Tough Questions 
--------------------- 
 
4. (U) Aznar responded vaguely to questions about 
regularizing the status of undocumented Colombians in Spain. 
When asked if a Spanish extradition order for Colombian 
paramilitary commander Carlos Castano would derail the peace 
process, Aznar noted that Spain had an independent judiciary. 
 He declined to discuss his post-presidency plans.  Stating 
that the reelection of Argentina\'s Menem, Peru\'s Fujimori, 
Brazil\'s Cardozo, and potentially Venezuela\'s Hugo Chavez had 
not turned out well, a reporter asked Uribe if a 
constitutional change that would permit his reelection was 
ethical.  Uribe responded that reelection was a matter for 
the congress and that constitutional matters were also a 
matter of public opinion (Note: At 80 per cent, Uribe\'s 
public approval is the highest in Latin America. End note). 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) The tank purchase is \"soft\" in that the numbers still 
range between 32 and 46 units.  A Colombian military team is 
currently inspecting the available used tanks in Spain.  The 
six million USD cost is merely the maximum funding available 
and must also cover the training package and maintenance, and 
possibly transport.  Essentially, the cost per vehicle will 
be so low as to be a virtual gift from Spain.  The effective 
use of a 36 ton tank, costly to maintain and unable to cross 
many of Colombia\'s rural bridges, is not in road security, 
but in engaging other tanks.  Armored wheeled vehicles would 
be a better option.  The advantage of this deal may be more 
to demonstrate military assistance from a European country 
than for military advantage.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On February 23, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia\'s (FARC) Teofilo Forero Mobile Column (TFMC) 
launched simultaneous attacks on a luxury residential complex 
in Neiva, Huila department, the city\'s power grid, and an 
isolated military outpost west of the city.  A quick police 
response prevented a mass kidnapping in Neiva, although 
guerrillas escaped with two wealthy hostages.  The Army, 
which lost at least 12 soldiers during the FARC\'s assault on 
the military base, failed to respond to either the kidnapping 
or the attack on the base, which lasted five hours. 
President Uribe responded to the setback by requesting the 
resignation of military and civilian intelligence officials, 
including the commander of the Ninth Brigade and the local 
director of the Department of Administrative Security (DAS). 
Local press coverage is calling this the most ambitious FARC 
operation in months, and a setback for the government.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
A Well-Planned Attack 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) In one of its most well-coordinated, dramatic 
operations since its bombing of Bogota\'s El Nogal social club 
in February 2003, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC) coordinated nearly simultaneous attacks on a luxury 
condominium complex in Neiva, capital of Huila department, 
the city\'s power grid, and an isolated military outpost west 
of the city.  At around 11:00 p.m. on February 23, 
approximately 20 guerrillas from the FARC\'s Teofilo Forero 
Mobile Column (TFMC) arrived at a luxury condominium complex 
on the outskirts of Neiva.  Dressed as Army GAULA 
(anti-kidnapping) officials and using vehicles similar to 
those used by the Army, they presented false documentation to 
the complex\'s private security guards that allowed them to 
obtain access to the high-security residential community. 
Once inside, they immobilized the guards and kidnapped 
residents of pre-selected apartments, blowing down front 
doors with explosives when necessary.  All told, the FARC 
attempted to kidnap approximately 30 persons, including 
prominent local businessman Luis Ernesto Bernal and cattle 
rancher Luis Fernando Borrero, reportedly a personal friend 
of President Uribe. 
 
3. (C) The Colombian National Police (CNP), who were on high 
alert because of intelligence pointing to an imminent attack, 
responded immediately, forcing the guerrillas to release all 
but two of their hostages before they left the complex. 
Three CNP officers and one civilian were injured in the gun 
battle.  The guerrillas, following a well-planned escape 
route lined with obstacles and booby-traps that slowed police 
pursuit, managed to escape with Bernal and Borrero.  Their 
escape took place in total darkness, thanks to a successful 
FARC attack on the city\'s power grid. 
 
4. (C) Simultaneous to the Neiva kidnapping operation, in an 
apparent diversionary attack, the TFMC assaulted an isolated 
Army outpost west of Neiva.  The five-hour attack included 
the use of gas cylinder bombs and left at least 12 of the 
post\'s 35 soldiers dead.  The Army\'s 9th Brigade, based in 
Neiva, which did not respond to the mass kidnapping attempt, 
also failed to send reinforcements to the isolated base under 
assault. 
 
--------------- 
A Proven Tactic 
--------------- 
 
5. (C) Disguising themselves as Colombian government 
authorities to gain access to homes and government facilities 
is a time-proven FARC tactic.  The TFMC conducted similar 
kidnappings at another luxury apartment complex in Neiva in 
July 2001 and Cali\'s provincial assembly headquarters in 
April 2002.  Over 20 hostages from those mass kidnappings are 
still in FARC hands. 
------------------------- 
Zero Tolerance From Uribe 
------------------------- 
6. (C) President Uribe held regional and national leaders of 
the security forces responsible for failing to anticipate and 
prevent the attacks, immediately requesting the resignations 
of the Army\'s Ninth Brigade commander, the military\'s 
National GAULA director and local Huila director, and the 
director, deputy director, and intelligence chief of the 
Department of Administrative Security\'s (DAS) Huila office. 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Local press coverage is declaring this 
near-destruction of a military outpost and major attack 
against civilians in a high-security residential complex the 
largest FARC attack in months and a clear setback.  In 
contrast to the Cali and 2001 Neiva kidnappings, however, the 
CNP\'s preparation and response prevented a much larger 
kidnapping.

2. (SBU) Three researchers in the Department of Economics at 
the University of London, working in conjunction with an 
Economics Professor at Augusta State University in Georgia 
with whom post had already been in contact, recently provided 
us with a summary report of research conducted on violence 
statistics related to the Colombian conflict during the 
period 1988 to 2002.  The research supports the conclusions 
presented in reftel on the shortcomings of statistics 
produced by some Colombian human rights NGOs.  The report 
posits the year 2000 as a turning point for the GOC in terms 
of operational successes and improvements in the government\'s 
human rights record and attributes this turnaround primarily 
to Plan Colombia. 
 
3. (SBU) The researchers used data from the Jesuit-founded 
Center for Popular Research and Education (CINEP).  Their 
research corrects for skewed data that results from CINEP\'s 
reliance on strict legal definitions of \"human rights 
violations\" and \"violations of international humanitarian 
law.\"  Instead, the researchers focused on presenting an 
analysis of \"bellicose actions\" undertaken by all armed 
actors in Colombia\'s internal conflict.  Their research also 
addressed the problem of overcounting by using what the 
researchers describe as a \"more objective\" methodology than 
that used by most Colombian human rights NGOs.  With these 
corrections in place, the data indicated that the FARC, ELN 
and AUC disproportionately target civilians, and that the 
number of civilian casualties attributed to GOC security 
forces dropped dramatically beginning in 2000, primarily 
because of a renewed GOC focus on human rights training and 
improved human rights performance.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIA MEETS IMF FISCAL DEFICIT TARGETS 
 
1.  (U) The GOC announced February 25 that it met the IMF 
target of 2.8 percent of GDP for its 2003 fiscal deficit. 
The GOC cut current expenditures and froze some investment 
projects, especially in the energy sector, in order to 
achieve this result.  The announcement was greeted positively 
by market analysts, but they tempered their enthusiasm, 
noting that the GOC may have difficulty meeting the 2004 
deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP as a result of current 
structural problems, such as growing public debt (52.7 
percent of GDP) and the current pension crisis.  While 
international investors welcomed the announcement, they are 
also worried about these factors. 
 
2.  (SBU) According to Fitch Ratings staff, the news that the 
overall public sector balance was consistent with the revised 
2.8 percent of GDP target was positive. However, higher than 
expected economic growth of 3.8 percent (Twice the original 2 
percent growth target) had led to expectations that the GOC 
would surpass the target.  Furthermore, the rigidity of 
expenditures and the automatic increase in transfers make the 
2004 deficit target a difficult one. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Comment.  The Colombian government\'s ability to 
meet the 2004 deficit target will depend on continued growth 
of 3.5 to 4 percent and the resulting increase in revenues. 
Further tax reforms seem unlikely (although the GOC has 
publicly committed to pursuing them in 2004) and efforts to 
reform the pension system or limit transfer growth will 
likely not enter into effect this year.  The GOC\'s strategy 
to meet the 2004 deficit depends on three items: 1) further 
investment and discretionary spending cuts; 2) increased tax 
collection (both through increased efficiency and economic 
growth); and 3) the sale of public assets.  The first attempt 
to sell off assets, the sale of the National Coffee Bank, 
failed to bring in any bidders, however.  The government can 
control its discretionary spending and investment, but 
potential savings from these items will not be enough to 
guarantee the fiscal deficit levels.  End Comment.

without firm GOC security guarantees for its area of 
operations and alternatives to jail time for its leaders. 
Representatives of the Peace Commissioner\'s Office will meet 
with the Bloc in early March to issue an ultimatum: join the 
demobilization process in good faith or drop out completely 
and face the full force of the security forces.  The 
Centauros Bloc\'s announcement underscores the AUC\'s tenuous 
unity and the paramilitaries\' concern with the GOC\'s stance 
that they must obey the terms of demobilization, including 
troop concentration and legal accountability.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Public Dissension From the Centauros Bloc 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) On February 27, a senior commander of the paramilitary 
Centauros Bloc, an affiliate of the United Self-Defense 
Forces of Colombia (AUC), publicly announced the bloc\'s 
unwillingness to demobilize until the GOC provides security 
guarantees in their area of operations and alternatives to 
jail time for the bloc\'s leaders.  Until its recent 
announcement, the Centauros Bloc, although guilty of scores 
of blatant cease-fire violations, towed the AUC line and 
publicly supported the demobilization process initiated by 
the Santa Fe de Ralito accord, which it signed.  The Bloc\'s 
decision to publicly condition any demobilization, apparently 
without authorization from its nominal AUC superiors, 
underscores the AUC\'s tenuous unity. 
 
3. (C) Over the past few months, the Centauros Bloc has 
clashed repeatedly with the independent Self-Defense Forces 
of Casanare (ACC), which is not participating in 
demobilization negotiations.  Both groups operate on 
Colombia\'s northeastern plains, where they struggle over key 
drug cultivation and trafficking routes.  Centauros Bloc 
commander Miguel Arroyave\'s reticence to accept 
demobilization wholeheartedly reflects both his aversion to 
ceding narcotrafficking influence to his ACC rivals and his 
concerns about potential criminal cases against him, both in 
Colombia and the United States.  (Note: We have not asked for 
Arroyave\'s extradition.  End note.) 
 
4. (C) Carlos Franco, director of the GOC\'s human rights 
office and a member of its exploratory commission on 
demobilization, told the Embassy that the GOC is frustrated 
by dissension both within the AUC and between it and other 
paramilitary organizations.  On March 4 or 5, the exploratory 
commission plans to meet with the Centauros Bloc\'s leaders to 
issue an ultimatum: join the demobilization process in good 
faith or drop out completely and face the full force of the 
security forces.  The GOC can hold up as an example the fate 
of the late Metro Bloc, which publicly declared its 
opposition to the peace process and was eventually destroyed 
by separate offensives from rival paramilitary groups and, to 
a lesser extent, the security forces.  The GOC recently 
issued a similar ultimatum to the ACC, and has also pressured 
the Middle Magdalena and Elmer Cardenas Blocs.

Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) The Centauros Bloc\'s recent announcements, as well as 
the GOC\'s firm response -- backed up with the threat of 
increased military pressure -- demonstrates that the peace 
process has not been a sweetheart deal.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIA - ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (TIP) REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 7869 
 
1. Embassy point of contact on trafficking in persons is 
human rights officer Kiersten Stiansen, phone number (571) 
383-2122, fax number (571) 315-2163.  Approximate amount of 
time spent to prepare this report:  30 hours. 
 
-------- 
Overview 
-------- 
 
2. Colombia is a significant source of trafficking victims, 
especially women and children destined for sexual 
exploitation.  According to the Administrative Department of 
Security (DAS), which has responsibilities similar to the FBI 
and INS, Colombia is the second most common country of origin 
of trafficking victims in the Western Hemisphere, and there 
are approximately 45,000-50,000 Colombian women working as 
prostitutes overseas.  According to the DAS, between 2 and 10 
Colombian women leave the country every day as unwitting 
victims of trafficking.  Some Colombian men are trafficked, 
usually for forced labor, and there is significant internal 
trafficking of women for sexual exploitation, especially by 
the FARC terrorist organization, as well as forced 
conscription into terrorist armies.  Female trafficking 
victims are at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, 
unwanted pregnancies, and forced abortions.  Most trafficking 
victims come from major cities such as Bogota, Medellin, and 
Barranquilla, the Caribbean coastal region, the departments 
of Valle del Cauca and Norte de Santander, and cities in the 
so-called \"Coffee Zone,\" which includes the departments of 
Risaralda, Caldas, and Quindio.  Victims of internal 
trafficking are brought from small towns and rural areas to 
large urban centers with active sex industries, including 
Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and Cartagena. 
 
3. According to the DAS, most trafficking victims go to 
Europe, especially Spain (30 percent) and the Netherlands (20 
percent), as well as Germany, Italy, France and Sweden.  Many 
other trafficking victims end up in Japan (40 percent).  The 
primary trafficking routes to Europe remain through Paris and 
Madrid.  The main routes to Japan are via Paris, Madrid, or 
Miami.  Colombia is also used as a transit point for 
trafficking victims from other countries, usually from South 
America. 
 
4. Most traffickers in Colombia are linked to narcotics 
trafficking or other criminal organizations.  Most 
trafficking organizations include both Colombians and 
criminals from destination countries.  Colombia\'s continuing 
economic difficulties, high unemployment, social exclusion, 
crime, and terrorism contribute to the availability of 
victims.  Traffickers especially target females between the 
ages of 14 and 30, especially those with limited education 
and poor job prospects.  They also target young single 
mothers.  They use a variety of techniques to recruit women. 
According to the DAS, criminal gangs frequently allow 
trafficking victims to return to Colombia if they agree to 
recruit additional victims.  These organizations place job 
advertisements in major regional newspapers offering jobs in 
Europe or Asia as nannies, maids, waitresses, sales clerks, 
and models.  They also advertise through internet chat-rooms 
and marriage agencies.  Once contact is established, criminal 
gangs move quickly to send victims overseas before they can 
reconsider or contact family.  In addition, women are brought 
to the airport at the last possible moment to minimize 
potential government surveillance prior to their departure. 
Victims are trained to memorize a fictitious cover story 
designed to be convincing to immigration authorities in the 
destination country.  According to the DAS, 90 percent of 
trafficking victims leave Colombia legally.  In cases in 
which women leave behind children in Colombia, criminal gangs 
often threaten to harm them if the woman does not continue 
working overseas. 
5. There is political will at the highest levels of the GOC 
to combat trafficking in persons.  The Government has an 
Inter-Agency Committee to Combat Trafficking in Women and 
Children which includes representatives of the Ministry of 
Justice and Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the DAS, 
Interpol, the Colombian National Police (CNP), the Colombian 
Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF), the Presidential Program 
for the Human Rights, and the Offices of the Prosecutor 
General, Inspector General, National Human Rights Ombudsman, 
and Civil Registrar.  The committee meets every two months 
and has prepared information campaigns, promoted information 
exchange between government entities, created trafficking hot 
lines for victims, and encouraged closer cooperation between 
the Government and Interpol.  Some of the committee\'s 
accomplishments over the last year included: training 
prosecutors throughout the country on the application of 
anti-trafficking Law 747 of 2002; updating the judicial 
assistance manual to include trafficking crimes; inaugurating 
a database to track criminal cases against trafficking 
nationwide; and strengthening cooperation between the 
government institutions that combat or discourage 
trafficking.  However, the effectiveness of anti-trafficking 
efforts is limited by the scarce resources available to 
relevant government agencies, which must devote most of their 
resources to combating narcoterrorism.  No Colombian 
government official has been indicted for trafficking, and 
there is no evidence of official complicity in any 
trafficking activities. 
 
---------- 
Prevention 
---------- 
 
6. Although the GOC acknowledges that trafficking in persons 
is a significant problem in Colombia, there is no single GOC 
entity responsible for anti-trafficking efforts and no 
specific national anti-trafficking plan.  However, as noted 
above, the GOC has an effective inter-agency committee that 
works to coordinate and amplify GOC anti-trafficking 
activities.  Government programs designed to empower women, 
such as a quota law that requires that local and regional 
authorities place women in 30 percent of all appointed 
positions, may have a positive long-term effect on Colombia\'s 
trafficking problem.  The GOC has excellent relations with 
national and international NGOs and international 
governmental organizations regarding trafficking.  Colombia 
has good control over its international airports, and uses a 
sophisticated system for tracking passenger arrivals and 
departures.  However, its maritime and land borders are 
extremely porous and vulnerable to exploitation by criminals 
who traffic in persons.  Nevertheless, the vast majority of 
trafficking victims leave the country legally.  The DAS, as 
the country\'s immigration control agency, has successfully 
identified potential trafficking victims preparing to board 
international flights from Bogota.  In 2003, they persuaded 
nine women not to go overseas after convincing them their job 
offers were fraudulent.  The DAS has also had success in 
capturing traffickers, or \"coyotes.\"  In February, DAS 
officials in Antioquia department captured four traffickers 
in the cities of Rionegro, near Medellin, and Turbo, on the 
Caribbean coast.  Those caught in Rionegro were attempting to 
send Ecuadorian children to the U.S. using false documents. 
 
7. The Hope Foundation (\"Fundacion Esperanza\"), an 
anti-trafficking NGO, in coordination with the DAS, sends 
representatives to Bogota\'s international airport to watch 
for potential trafficking victims.  In February 2004, with 
the support of the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM), the Foundation launched an information campaign to 
assist travelers in Bogota,s international airport. 
Travelers will be able to register with the Foundation, view 
information on trafficking, and access the addresses and 
phone numbers of Colombian consulates worldwide through a 
kiosk in the international terminal.  This information is 
also available on a new internet site. 
 
8. In July 2003, the IOM implemented a major anti-trafficking 
public relations campaign to raise awareness in Colombia. 
The campaign included placing large posters in airports, 
foreign consulates, and travel agencies and running 
professionally produced public service announcements on radio 
and television.  The IOM, with USG assistance, also created a 
Call Center that allows persons to phone in anonymously to 
ask about the legitimacy of work offers and provide 
information on potential trafficking cases.  Between July 31 
and September 30, 2003, the center received 2,338 calls. 
 
9. The IOM has also signed two agreements this year with GOC 
agencies to increase cooperation in trafficking prevention. 
On November 6, the IOM and the Inspector General,s Office 
(Procuraduria) signed a Technical Cooperation Agreement to 
strengthen the prevention of trafficking and the punishment 
of traffickers.  The IOM has also begun training local 
representatives of the Inspector Generals\' Office nationwide 
and is developing an information-sharing database.  On 
December 10, the IOM signed an agreement with the DAS on 
increased cooperation and development of a shared information 
database. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10. Law 599 of 2000 made the penalties for trafficking for 
purposes of prostitution equivalent to those for rape and 
sexual assault, carrying penalties of six to eight years in 
prison and fines of up to 100 times the monthly minimum wage. 
 Law 747 of July 2002 broadened the definition of trafficking 
in persons and provided for prison sentences between 10 and 
15 years and fines up to 1,000 times the monthly minimum 
wage.  These penalties can be increased by up to one-third if 
there are aggravating circumstances.  Charges of illegal 
detention, violation of the right to work in dignified 
conditions, and violation of personal freedom may also be 
brought against traffickers.  Police actively investigate 
trafficking offenses. 
 
11. In accordance with Law 360 of 1997, the Prosecutor 
General,s Office (Fiscalia) created a special unit to 
investigate and prosecute sexual crimes, including 
trafficking in persons.  In 2003, the Prosecutor General,s 
Office negotiated 13 plea bargains and convicted 3 persons 
for trafficking offenses.  There were another 306 cases in 
various stages of processing and/or investigation.  There was 
a 38 percent increase in the number of trafficking cases 
investigated by the Prosecutor General\'s Office over the past 
year. 
12. In the last year, the DAS conducted 6 major international 
anti-trafficking operations that freed 14 women and led to 
the arrest of 8 traffickers.  For example, Colombia\'s 
diplomatic mission in Japan, working with INTERPOL in both 
Colombia and Japan, provided key information that led to the 
capture of Japanese trafficker &Sony8 and two other 
Japanese citizens, as well as the arrest of a Colombian woman 
who worked as a recruiter for the Japanese mafia, the 
\"Yakuza.\"  This woman would meet Colombian victims in Narita 
airport in Japan where she would take their documents and 
then sell the women to Japanese criminals.  Based on the 
information provided by an escaped victim, this woman was 
deported back to Colombia in June 2003 where she was detained 
by members of INTERPOL Colombia in Bogota,s airport, and met 
by authorities with warrants for her arrest for the crimes of 
trafficking in persons and conspiracy.  According to the 
police and DAS, most traffickers are linked to narcotics or 
other criminal organizations.  In some cases, Colombian 
traffickers sell victims to foreign crime organizations; this 
is especially the case with Japanese crime syndicates, as 
noted above. 
 
13. The IOM has provided training for government officials to 
help trafficking victims.  In particular, it has been working 
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to train its career 
diplomats on how to spot and deal with trafficking victims, 
as well as providing information on the scope of the problem 
in Colombia and internationally.  Since December 2002, the 
IOM has conducted numerous workshops and trained more than 
1,610 public officials from various government agencies in 
different regional departments on the applicable regulations 
for this crime. 
 
14. GOC can extradite persons charged with trafficking in 
other countries.  However, there were no such extraditions 
(nor requests for extradition) in the last year, according to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
15. Colombia\'s legislature approved ILO Convention 182 on the 
worst forms of child labor.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Social Protection are taking the necessary steps to 
finalize ratification.  The GOC has already taken steps to 
bring national law into conformity with the Convention.  On 
November 11, Colombia ratified the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution, and child pornography.  The 
Protocol entered into force on December 11.  It has also 
signed, but not yet ratified, the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women 
and Children, supplementing the UN Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime.  The Colombian Congress has 
approved the Protocol, but it is still pending approval by 
the president and review by the Constitutional Court. 
Colombia ratified ILO Convention 29 in 1969 and ILO 
Convention 105 in 1963. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Protection and Assistance to Victims 
------------------------------------ 
16. Colombian consulates worldwide are responsible for 
providing legal and social assistance to Colombian citizens 
in need, including victims of trafficking.  The GOC has 
contracted legal advisors and social workers to help support 
Colombians abroad.  However, this type of assistance is only 
provided in consular districts with at least 10,000 resident 
Colombians.  The GOC has no program for assisting trafficking 
victims once they return to Colombia, but trafficked minors 
can receive some assistance.  For example, of the 25,000 
children sexually exploited in Colombia, the Colombian Family 
Welfare Institute (ICBF) has provided assistance, both 
directly and through other specialized agencies, to over 
14,400 over the last year.  The IOM and the Hope Foundation 
have provided short-term assistance to trafficking victims, 
including educational information, social support, and 
counseling.  For example, with USG funding, the IOM is 
assisting 50 children of female trafficking victims in 
Bogota; 50 adult female trafficking victims in Medellin, 
Antioquia department; 39 adult female trafficking victims in 
Pereira, Risaralda department; 30 children of female 
trafficking victims in Armenia, Quindio department; and 
trafficking victims between the ages of 14 and 25 in 
Cartagena, Bolivar department, and Barranquilla, Atlantico 
department.  The Foundation against Trafficking in Persons, 
founded by the Ministry of Justice\'s former anti-trafficking 
advisor, began a project to assist trafficking victims and 
others hurt by the sex trade in Bogota.  The Rebirth 
Foundation (\"Fundacion Renacer\") provided assistance to 
trafficking victims, especially children.  In 2002, the 
Rebirth Foundation helped 1,323 victims of trafficking, 
including 392 girls and 270 boys. 
 
17. The rights of trafficking victims are respected and the 
government encourages victims to assist in the investigation 
and prosecution of trafficking crimes.  However, widespread 
witness intimidation and limitations of the witness 
protection program deter many victims from coming forward or 
actively cooperating in investigations.

SUBJECT: PROSECUTOR GENERAL OSORIO AND AMBASSADOR REVIEW 
PROBLEMS IN THE FISCALIA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.5 (b), (c), (d) 
 
 1. (S) Summary:  In a meeting with the Ambassador on March 
5, Prosecutor General (Fiscal General) Osorio said that he 
had accepted the resignations of two senior Fiscalia 
officials and dismissed several others in an effort to clean 
house.  He will also allow the Fiscalia,s prosecutors to 
elect a new national director.  The Ambassador said that 
Osorio, as immediate priorities, should: (1) polygraph all 
senior Fiscalia officials; and (2) establish a secure, 
independent anti-corruption unit with the necessary 
authorities and responsibilities, reporting directly to him. 
The unit,s first duty should be to investigate seven 
Fiscalia officials whom we believe to be involved in serious 
corruption.  Osorio agreed to the polygraphing, resisted 
creation of the anti-corruption unit, and questioned 
allegations against several of the seven.  Osorio asked for 
the embassy to provide information.  The Ambassador responded 
that the Fiscalia already had sufficient information to begin 
investigating and that it was up to the Fiscalia to do its 
own investigations.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Prosecutor General Luis Camilo Osorio called on the 
Ambassador March 5 to discuss allegations that the Office of 
the Prosecutor General (Fiscalia), the GOC\'s lead 
prosecutorial entity, was penetrated by paramilitaries and 
narcotics interests.  Osorio noted that he had just returned 
from Washington, where Department of Justice\'s Criminal 
Division Deputy Assistant Attorney General (DAAG) Mary Lee 
Warren had provided him with recommendations to root out 
paramilitary and narcotics-related collusion.  Osorio 
commented that upon returning to Colombia he had found 
himself \"in the eye of a hurricane\" given the intense media 
commentary about corruption within the Fiscalia.  The 
Ambassador noted that the Fiscalia\'s credibility was under 
question, and this could not only undermine Colombians\' faith 
in their justice system, but could have serious consequences 
for USG assistance to the Fiscalia. 
 
---------------------------- 
Osorio: \"I\'m Taking Actions\" 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (S) Osorio outlined recent dismissals and resignations of 
senior-level Fiscalia officials.  He had fired the former 
Director of the Witness Protection Program, Lucio Pabon, for 
incompetence.  He had also dismissed prosecutors in Cali for 
documented and suspected ties to narcotics traffickers.  He 
had accepted the resignation of the National Director of the 
Fiscales (i.e., prosecutors), Justo Pastor Rodriquez, noting 
that he could not defend Pastor\'s questionable actions.  He 
had reluctantly accepted the resignation of Pastor\'s 
next-in-line, Carlos Hernando Arias.  Although he questioned 
the charges against Arias, the Fiscalia was investigating 
allegations against both Pastor and Arias.  Osorio was going 
to have the Fiscalia\'s prosecutors elect the next National 
Director of Fiscales. 
 
------------- 
Rotten Apples 
------------- 
 
4.  (S) The Ambassador observed that the Embassy had been 
conducting its own study of the penetration of the Fiscalia 
by paramilitary and narcotics interests.  The U.S. was 
convinced that key Fiscalia officials had manipulated 
investigations and prosecutions in paramilitary and 
narcotrafficking cases.  In addition, prosecutors who 
zealously pursued these cases had been summarily reassigned 
or even dismissed.  The Embassy had had serious concerns 
about Justo Pastor and Lucio Pabon, and welcomed their 
removal.  In addition, the Embassy has equally strong 
reservations regarding senior officials still within the 
Fiscalia. 
 
---------------------------- 
Ambassador\'s Recommendations 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (S) The Ambassador called for polygraphing of high-level 
Fiscalia officials, noting that the Prosecutor General had 
previously agreed to polygraph all members of the National 
Anti-Narcotics Unit (UNAIM).  He recommended polygraphing all 
Office Directors within the Fiscalia, including Specialized 
Unit Directors and Delegates before the Supreme Courts, and 
all the Fiscalia and CTI Sectional Directors (i.e., the 
senior Fiscalia and CTI officials in each of the 32 
departments).  The total of senior officials polygraphed 
would be more than 90.  Both the Prosecutor General and the 
Embassy should get the results of the polygraphs.  The 
Ambassador suggested that it would be beneficial for the 
Prosecutor General to work with the President\'s 
Anti-Corruption Czar, Maria Margarita Zuleta, in implementing 
anti-corruption reforms within the Fiscalia. 
 
 
6. (S) The Ambassador stressed that it was the Fiscalia\'s 
responsibility to investigate wrongdoing committed by its own 
personnel.  The Ambassador called on the Prosecutor General 
to establish an anti-corruption unit with the authority to 
investigate and prosecute corrupt Fiscalia officials.  The 
new unit should be staffed with trusted personnel who have 
undergone background checks and polygraphs.  Since we did not 
question Osorio\'s commitment, the unit should report its 
findings directly to the Prosecutor General.  This new unit 
should begin by investigating the allegations against 
individuals of particular concern. 
 
--------------- 
Osorio Responds 
--------------- 
 
7.  (S) Osorio denied that he had any contacts with the 
paramilitaries, or any of the other illegal armed groups.  He 
agreed to polygraph senior Fiscalia officials.  He resisted 
the establishment of a new anti-corruption unit, arguing that 
he could not independently assign this jurisdiction to a new 
unit.  Instead, he could create an ad-hoc unit and staff it 
with senior, respected prosecutors.  A more promising 
institutional alternative, he added, was expanding the scope 
of authority of the about to be created \"Anti-Mafia Unit\" so 
that it could pursue corruption within the Fiscalia. 
 
8. (S) Osorio said that he intended to fire the Fiscalia\'s 
Sectional Director in the department of Cesar, Alix Cecilia 
Dasa.  Osorio questioned, however, the veracity of the 
allegations against three, perhaps four, of the other 
officials about which the Embassy expressed serious 
reservations.  Osorio asked for the Embassy to share its 
information with the Fiscalia, sanitized to protect the 
sources, to help it conduct its investigations.  The 
Ambassador observed that in the Embassy\'s view the Fiscalia 
had not pursued all of the information already available to 
it in these cases and that it was up to the Fiscalia to 
conduct investigations, not the Embassy. 
 
9. (S) Comment and Action Request:  We are concerned by 
Osorio,s reluctance to empower a vetted anti-corruption 
unit.  We believe that the Fiscalia can robustly fight 
corruption within its ranks only by empowering a \"walled-off\" 
vetted anti-corruption unit.  We urge that this be a priority 
topic during the visit of DAAG Warren this week. End Comment.

SUBJECT: GOC CONTINUING TO CONFRONT PARAMILITARIES 
 
REF: BOGOTA 1680 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons: 1.5 B & D. 
 
1.  (C) Summary: In the face of AUC and other paramilitary 
groups\' failure to fulfill the unilateral cease-fire pledge 
(reftel), the security forces continue to confront 
paramilitaries throughout the country.  Since the beginning 
of 2003, almost 3,000 paramilitaries have been captured, 
killed, or have deserted.  Law enforcement agencies have 
targeted paramilitary drug trafficking rings and at least 
four mid-level commanders have been arrested in the past two 
months.  Orders to confront the paramilitaries come from the 
highest levels of the Uribe administration, including the 
President himself.  End Summary. 
 
------------------- 
Military Operations 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) The military has aggressively confronted paramilitary 
groups nationwide despite the ongoing peace process with the 
three largest paramilitary groups.  The Security and 
Democracy Foundation, a respected, independent think-tank, 
reports that the number of offensive operations against the 
paramilitaries has more than doubled from 2002 to 2003 and 
the death rate during these confrontations has increased from 
1.2 to 1.5 paramilitary combatants per operation.  Although 
the military conducts more offensive operations against the 
FARC, operations against the paramilitaries have increased at 
a faster rate, 2002-2003. 
 
3. (C) The Colombian military reports that so far in 2004, 
526 arms (long and short), 344 pieces of equipment, and 175 
explosive devices have been seized in operations against 
paramilitaries.  These operations freed eight civilian 
prisoners and prevented one civilian assassination.  108 
paramilitaries have been killed, 426 captured or arrested, 
and 59 have deserted.  Results from 2003 are similar: 1,482 
arms, 1,446 pieces of equipment, and 261 explosive devices 
were seized.  The latter operations resulted in 61 civilian 
prisoners being freed.  328 paramilitaries were killed, 1,717 
captured or arrested, and 242 deserted.  A total of 2,880 
paramilitaries have been removed from the battlefield since 
2003.  (Note: the number of captured paramilitaries is lower 
than the 4,000 or so that the Ministry of Defense reports. 
This discrepancy could be caused by the Ministry\'s failure to 
subtract detainees released immediately following an 
operation because of a lack of evidence.  End Note). 
 
----------------------- 
Law Enforcement Attacks 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) The GOC also has employed a variety of law enforcement 
tools against paramilitaries.  For example: 
 
-- In late January 2004, Colombian authorities participated 
in an international operation to dismantle a 
paramilitary-Italian mafia money laundering and drug 
trafficking ring.  Over 110 criminals were arrested in six 
countries, including at least 15 Colombians.  Forty 
additional arrest warrants have been issued in Colombia. 
 
-- On February 2, 23 paramilitaries were arrested in Cali as 
the result of a six-month investigation led by the Department 
of Administrative Security (DAS, roughly FBI equivalent). 
 
-- In September 2003, Colombian authorities began seizing 
over U.S. $3 million worth of assets belonging to AUC 
commander Hernan Giraldo Serna, who is responsible for a 
large percentage of the drug trafficking in the Sierra Nevada 
de Santa Marta region. 
 
-- In January 2003, a judge in Becerril, Cesar Department was 
murdered by paramilitaries.  The Prosecutor General\'s Office 
(Fiscalia), with U.S. financial and logistical support, 
launched a three-month investigation, which resulted in 37 
arrests related to paramilitary corruption led by AUC 
commander Rodrigo Tovar.  The U.S. has helped fund at least 
25 such investigations against Colombia\'s illegal armed 
groups since 2002. 
 
5. (C) In the past two months, at least four mid-level 
paramilitary commanders have been captured, including the 
alleged second-in-command of the AUC\'s Calima Bloc, a Middle 
Magdalena Group commander involved in gasoline theft, and the 
second-in-command of the AUC\'s Heroes of Gauliva Bloc that 
operates near Bogota. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Commitment From the Highest Levels 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The Uribe administration is committed to confronting 
the paramilitaries.  In addition to the police operations 
listed above,  President Uribe has ordered GOC military 
efforts against the paramilitaries.  Uribe\'s current Armed 
Forces Commander and former Army Commander, General Ospina, 
has aggressively carried out the administration\'s military 
objectives, and the Procuraduria has noted the military\'s 
high level of cooperation under Ospina.  Army Commander 
General Carreno directed successful operations against 
paramilitary-dominated areas when he was Second Division 
Commander in 2002 and has continued to do so in his current 
position.  Vice President Francisco Santos has publicly 
criticized the paramilitaries for failing to observe the 
cease-fire and underscored that the GOC will not tolerate 
violations.  Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo has 
encouraged the military to combat the paramilitaries despite 
the complications these operations have caused for peace 
negotiations.

SUBJECT: PARAMILITARY PEACE DIFFICULTIES 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
1. (S) At the instruction of President Uribe, Peace 
Negotiator Restrepo met with the Ambassador to discuss 
difficulties in the GOC\'s negotiations with the AUC 
paramilitaries.  Restrepo said the AUC had called for written 
guarantees from the GOC that, during the concentration phase, 
AUC members facing arrest warrants would neither be jailed 
nor extradited to the United States.  The AUC also wanted a 
two-step system that gave demobilizing forces several months 
within concentration areas before judicial reviews began on 
individual criminal behavior.  The Ambassador opposed lifting 
arrest warrants on paramilitaries during the initial 
demobilization phase as this would reduce compliance 
incentives.  He also cautioned against delaying the judicial 
screening of concentrated paramilitary personnel.  He 
observed that the lack of transparency in the Medellin 
demobilization undermined support for the larger paramilitary 
peace process, and recommended that the GOC publicly 
highlight what had been achieved.  Restrepo noted that, as a 
result of GOC military pressure, the Central Bolivar Bloc had 
taken the potentially significant decision to pull out of key 
areas, including Barrancabermeja.  Carlos Castano still 
flirted with the idea of turning himself in to the United 
States.  The Ambassador urged Restrepo to develop a more 
integrated interagency approach to support the AUC process. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Ambassador Meets with High Commissioner for Peace 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2.  (C) High Commissioner for Peace Luis Carlos Restrepo 
called upon the Ambassador March 9 at President Uribe\'s 
instruction to provide an update on the paramilitary peace 
process.  Restrepo was concerned that discussions with 
paramilitaries were at a critical juncture. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Concentration Areas and Arrest Warrants 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (S) Restrepo said his main objective during his March 5 
negotiations with the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia 
(AUC) was to secure their commitment to concentrate their 
forces in specific geographic zones.  Concentrations were 
indispensable for the GOC to verify the paramilitaries\' 
compliance with the cease-fire. 
 
4.  (S) Restrepo said AUC leaders vehemently opposed 
concentrating their combatants without a GOC written 
commitment that paramilitary members would neither be 
arrested nor extradited to the U.S. while involved in the 
troop concentration phase.  The AUC wanted U.S. endorsement 
of this agreement.  This stance appeared to be the result of 
mid-level paramilitary leaders seeking complete protection 
from jail or extradition.  AUC leaders also argued that the 
\"security\" they provided was necessary and would not be 
available if they concentrated in zones. 
 
---------------------- 
Overcoming the Impasse 
---------------------- 
 
5.  (S) Restrepo noted that the March 5 discussions would 
have broken off had it not been for an emotional plea by AUC 
leader Carlos Castano to agree in principle to geographic 
concentration, pending further consideration of shielding 
paramilitary members from jail during the concentration 
phase.  Restrepo had considered two solutions to the issue. 
One, lifting individual arrest orders for a limited time, had 
already been discarded.  Another approach was lifting arrest 
orders for individuals in specific geographic areas.  He also 
mused whether the GOC could broach the issue of extradition 
with the paramilitaries. 
 
6.  (S) Restrepo observed that it was difficult to see how 
paramilitary leaders could carry out their demobilization 
tasks if they could not be temporarily shielded from arrest. 
Nevertheless, President Uribe was concerned that the time was 
not yet ripe for the GOC to lift arrest orders on 
paramilitaries and had consistently opposed negotiating the 
extradition issue with the paramilitaries.  The USG also had 
been clear that it opposed lifting the arrest orders for 
specific individuals involved in peace talks and 
concentration/demobilization.  Restrepo requested USG views. 
 
--------------------- 
Ambassador\'s Response 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (S) The Ambassador observed that the paramilitary 
ceasefire, although imperfectly observed, already had saved 
many lives.  He endorsed the GOC\'s insistence that the 
paramilitaries concentrate their forces; a concentration 
would enable the GOC to verify paramilitary compliance with 
the ceasefire and agreement terms.  It would also separate 
paramilitaries that genuinely want to demobilize from those 
who do not.  Some paramilitary elements would remain heavily 
involved in narcotics trafficking.  The United States 
rejected the AUC\'s argument that they provided security in 
certain regions; they were terrorists.  Security was the job 
of the GOC. 
 
8.  (S) The Ambassador urged against formally lifting arrest 
warrants against paramilitaries, especially prior to their 
having complied with all the terms of any agreement.  Such a 
concession would reduce the GOC\'s leverage.  Regarding 
extradition, the Ambassador recalled that Uribe assured the 
United States that neither the \"conditional parole\" bill nor 
any agreement reached with the AUC would impair the 
extradition process.  The United States still relied on this 
position. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Restrepo Pushed for Temporary Mechanism 
--------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (S) Restrepo said he accepted the Ambassador\'s rationale 
for not formally lifting arrest warrants on the 
paramilitaries to maintain GOC leverage during the 
demobilization/reintegration process.  However, he insisted 
that some kind of temporary, carefully-defined mechanism was 
needed to shield paramilitary leaders from arrest while they 
carried out accord commitments.  The paramilitaries would not 
enter into a concentration phase without some guarantee.  The 
Ambassador advised Restrepo to seek a practical solution, 
leaving arrest warrants in place.  AUC leaders could acquire 
the freedom to move within and between zones of 
concentration, solely in order to ensure that concentration 
was a success. 
 
------------------ 
Judicial Screening 
------------------ 
 
10.  (S) Restrepo said that the paramilitaries\' wariness 
about being arrested after concentrating led them to refuse 
to have their personnel reviewed by the Prosecutor General\'s 
Office (Fiscalia) during the concentration phase.  The 
judicial screening approach used in the Medellin 
demobilization had led to the prosecution of a substantial 
number of Cacique Nutibara Bloc members.  Because a 
\"conditional parole\" law was not in effect, the Fiscalia was 
obligated to prosecute those wanted for serious crimes.  As a 
result, the paramilitaries wanted to wait three months after 
concentration, ostensibly to build confidence, before being 
interrogated by the Fiscalia. 
 
11.  (S) The Ambassador said that concentrating paramilitary 
forces would be a positive development.  Nevertheless, 
delaying judicial screening would create a break point in 
negotiations that the paramilitaries could exploit.  Restrepo 
conceded the Ambassador\'s point, but reiterated his doubt 
that he could persuade the paramilitaries to accept judicial 
screening soon after concentration. 
 
---------------- 
Medellin Process 
---------------- 
12. (S) The Ambassador observed that the public\'s limited 
understanding of the Medellin demobilization negatively 
affected the overall perception of the AUC peace process. 
The GOC should publicize details of the Medellin process to 
overcome the perception that it was synonymous with impunity. 
 Restrepo responded that the division of institutional 
responsibilities complicated projecting a unified message on 
the Medellin process.  (Note: The High Commissioner for Peace 
had a coordinating role, the mayor\'s office provided jobs and 
training, the Peace Commission of Antioquia and the Church 
helped verify compliance, and the Fiscalia conducted judicial 
screening.)  Restrepo acknowledged that releasing information 
on Medellin demobilization\'s judicial screening would correct 
the perception of immunity.  He noted that, of approximately 
870 demobilized in Medellin, 75 faced legal charges and 18 
were in prison awaiting prosecution.  To overcome AUC 
concerns, Restrepo wanted to downplay the judicial screening 
process until after the \"conditional parole\" bill was 
approved. 
 
-------------------- 
Central Bolivar Bloc 
-------------------- 
 
13.  (S) Restrepo said that the Central Bolivar Bloc (BCB), 
which had skittishly participated in demobilization 
discussions, had announced -- and appeared committed to 
carrying out -- a withdrawal from key points in the Middle 
Magdalena region, including the city of Barrancabermeja. 
Restrepo judged that a key factor behind the BCB\'s withdrawal 
had been increased GOC military pressure.  Another possible 
factor was that the BCB wanted to create a security vacuum. 
 
------- 
Castano 
------- 
 
14.  (S) Restrepo noted that Castano had played a decisive 
role in moving the AUC demobilization discussions forward. 
Of all the paramilitary leaders, he was the most committed to 
reaching an agreement.  As a result, many of the other 
paramilitary leaders viewed Castano as a potential traitor, 
and he was clearly apprehensive about his own security. 
Within the AUC, military power had decisively shifted to 
Salvatore Mancuso.  Restrepo characterized Castano as 
schizophrenic on the possibility of turning himself in to 
U.S. authorities.  At times Castano defiantly scorned the 
danger he faced, while at others he voiced the possibility of 
turning himself over to the U.S.  The GOC, said Restrepo, 
would welcome such a voluntary handover. 
 
------------------------ 
Greater GOC Coordination 
------------------------ 
 
15.  (SBU) The Ambassador urged Restrepo to work closely with 
Minister of Defense Uribe and Minister of Interior/Justice 
Pretelt to develop a coordinated interagency structure, with 
clearly defined responsibilities to support the AUC 
demobilization process.  U.S. assistance to the process could 
not be considered until the process was fully defined. 
Restrepo concurred, noting that the Ministries of Defense and 
Interior/Justice were finalizing their proposed division of 
labor.

SUBJECT: WILL CONGRESS COME THROUGH FOR URIBE? 
 
REF: BOGOTA 469 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons: 1.5 B & D. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  In January, President Uribe, in an effort 
to nudge a recalcitrant Congress toward passage of new 
reforms, announced plans to form three high-level special 
commissions to formulate proposals in the areas of economics, 
justice, and administration of the state.  On February 17, 
the Administration and six of the largest formal political 
parties signed a pact to work on the three fronts.  With 
Congress to reconvene on March 16, only the special justice 
commission has met, and its initial recommendations have 
already caused controversy.  Our congressional interlocutors 
stress that while the special commissions are 
headline-grabbers made up of high-profile national figures, 
the Congress will have the final say on any reforms.  We 
expect piecemeal progress on legislation at best.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (U) In the aftermath of difficult congressional relations 
in December, President Uribe in early January called for 
three national commissions of prominent legislators, current 
and former members of government, business leaders, and 
opinion makers, as recommended by the parties.  The 
commissions would study economic and fiscal reforms, justice 
sector reforms, and reforms to improve the efficiency of the 
state and reduce corruption.  The latter would address 
elimination of some state institutions and privileged pension 
schemes as well as potential territorial reforms to reduce 
duplication of administration functions and costs. 
 
3.  (U) On February 17, with much fanfare, President Uribe 
and Interior and Justice Minister Sabas Pretelt signed a 
national political pact with six leading political parties 
and a handful of additional smaller political organizations, 
all Uribista.  The pact committed the signatories to 
good-faith efforts to pass important economic, justice, and 
state reforms, including: 
 
--Pension reform; 
--Tax regime simplification; 
--Implementation of oral arguments in judicial proceedings; 
--Improvements in penal system; 
--Streamlining of the judicial branch bureaucracy; 
--Improvements to the civil service structure; 
--Improved public contracting and reduction of transaction 
costs; and 
--Elimination of unnecessary state structures and entities. 
 
Liberal Party President Camilo Sanchez and Team Colombia 
(Equipo Colombia) President Luis Alfredo Ramos qualified 
their signatures by stressing they had not given Uribe a 
\"blank check\" and that new taxes, for example, were out of 
the question.  Absent from the signing ceremony was the 
center-left Independent Democratic Party (PDI) of Bogota 
Mayor Luis Eduardo \"Lucho\" Garzon and Senator Antonio Navarro 
Wolff. 
 
4.  (U) The March 16-June 20 congressional session promises 
to have a loaded schedule.  In addition to likely 
deliberation on any formal recommendations the three special 
commissions might make, the Congress must pass implementing 
legislation to carry out anti-terrorism reforms passed in 
December.  The civil registry aspect of the anti-terrorism 
reform is already causing heated debate (septel). 
Furthermore, the conditional parole bill (alternatividad 
penal) for former fighters is a GOC priority for the session. 
 Legislation to permit presidential reelection (septel) is 
also likely to make the agenda. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  The special commissions have their work cut 
out for them, as the subject matter they are charged with 
addressing is both complicated and controversial.  An initial 
offering of proposals by the special justice commission 
(streamlining the top levels of the national judiciary and 
establishing of new emergency speed-up procedures) launched a 
public feud between the heads of the Supreme and 
Constitutional Courts.  On the economic side, pension reform 
is considered urgent, but a key pension measure failed in 
last October\'s Referendum and the Congress balked at making 
any modifications in the context of last December\'s fiscal 
reform package.  Senior GOC economic officials tell us they 
are pessimistic about passage of sweeping pension reform. 
 
6.  (C) Comment (continued):  Despite Uribe\'s overtures to 
the traditional parties and Congress--consulting the parties 
in naming special commission members and replacing the 
contentious Fernando Londono with the conciliatory Sabas 
Pretelt as Interior Minister--a strong current of resistance 
and resentment continues to run through Congress.  Members 
continue to tell us that they resent Uribe\'s continued 
disparagement and/or neglect of the institution.  This 
includes both Senate President German Vargas and House 
Speaker Alonso Acosta, who have publicly (and the latter 
privately with us) distanced themselves from Uribe.  Rank and 
file members, meanwhile, have complained about not getting 
seats on the special commissions.  The concurrent initiative 
to permit presidential reelection will further strain 
executive-legislative relations, as several of the 
presidential aspirants are members of Congress.  While Uribe 
generally counts on majorities in both houses, those 
majorities have failed him (i.e., not showing up, breaking 
the quorum) on more than one key vote.  While it is likely 
that several reforms will pass the Congress by June, it 
remains to be seen exactly which ones--and how many--will 
become law.

SUBJECT: DRAFT AGREEMENTS ON INTEGRATED INTELLIGENCE AND 
COMMUNICATIONS, AND LOGISTICS 
 
 
1.  At the request of the Vice Minister of National Defense 
(MOD) for Policy, MOD staff and Post (NAS and MilGp) have 
prepared two draft agreements (Appendices) that seek to 
integrate the MOD and the Colombian Military and National 
Police in the critical areas of intelligence and 
communications, and logistics. 
 
2.  Each Appendix is essentially a \"framework\" agreement 
that a) establishes the MOD policy to integrate efforts in 
these two areas, and b) permits USG to support current and 
future integration projects, which are attached as Sub- 
Appendices.  For example, the first two projects of the 
intelligence and communications agreement are a) the 
integration of counternarcotics voice communications systems 
of the police and the military (almost completed and highly 
successful), and b) the Colombian Imagery Library/Theater 
Intelligence Architecture sponsored by the National 
Geospatial Intelligence Agency and USSOUTHCOM.  The first 
logistics project provides aviation logistics management 
software (SAP) for the Colombian military.  Additional 
projects could be added to either agreement. 
 
3.  No additional funding is required to implement these 
agreements.  Funding for the initial integration projects is 
provided in other INL/NAS or DOD support programs, for 
example the NAS Antinarcotics Police budget (obligated under 
Appendix 1) funded the voice integration project.  NAS 
funding (approximately $4.5M) for the CNP phase of the 
aviation logistics software would also be obligated under 
Appendix 1.  The agreements are broad enough, however, to 
allow establishing new budget lines for future integration 
projects. 
 
4.  The draft agreements have been sent by email to INL/LP 
(Christie), USSOUTHCOM (SJS LTC Rose), and NGA (Gotay) for 
coordination of review and comment.  Unless otherwise 
advised by 29 March, we will process these agreements for 
signature in early April.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) To address the international community\'s concerns 
about human rights violations against trade union members, 
Vice-President Santos briefed ambassadors of member states of 
the ILO\'s Governing Body on GOC advances in promoting 
workers\' human rights and tripartite dialogue.  In addition 
to citing numerous dialogue and training initiatives, Santos 
highlighted progress in judicial proceedings related to human 
rights violations against trade unionists and cited 
government statistics indicating a decline in levels of 
violence against them.  Diplomats present asked the GOC to do 
more to publicize its efforts in this field.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
VP Briefs Ambassadors on Labor Rights 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In advance of this month\'s scheduled review of the 
International Labor Organization\'s (ILO) Special Technical 
Cooperation Program with Colombia, Vice President Francisco 
Santos briefed representatives of ILO Governing Body (GB) 
members on March 8.  Also in attendance were Foreign Minister 
Carolina Barco; Minister of Social Protection Diego Palacio; 
Ministry of Social Protection (MSP) Vice Minister for Labor 
Relations Luz Stella Arango; Gabriel Mesa, Director of the 
MSP\'s Office of International Cooperation; and Ana Maria 
Sanchez, Director of the MSP\'s Office of Human Rights. 
 
------- 
Context 
------- 
 
3. (U) In June 2003 the GB rejected a proposal by the ILO\'s 
Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) to appoint a Fact 
Finding and Conciliation Commission for Colombia to address 
the many murders and other human rights violations against 
trade union leaders and members that remain unresolved (ref 
C).  The GB did, however, urge the GOC to more effectively 
address cases of violence against union members and take 
appropriate steps to foster an environment in which unions 
can operate without fear of intimidation or reprisal.  In an 
effort to demonstrate its political will to address these 
issues and to highlight advances made under the Special 
Technical Cooperation Program, GOC officials announced the 
launch of an informal campaign to raise awareness of GOC 
advances in promoting and protecting the human rights of 
Colombian union leaders, members, and workers in general. 
 
----------------------------- 
GOC Addressing ILO\'s Concerns 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The GOC presented a report charting progress to date 
on the 357 sub-cases contained within CFA Case Number 1787. 
Each of these sub-cases represents a case in which the GOC 
has allegedly failed to take sufficient action to investigate 
and/or prosecute a murder, kidnapping, or series of threats 
against a trade union member.  According to the MSP, the GOC 
has formally responded with a status report in 345 of the 357 
sub-cases, even though only 196 of the sub-cases actually 
involved union members or leaders.  According to the MSP, the 
majority of sub-cases are still in the investigative stage 
and have not been brought to trial, largely because of 
complex legal procedures, an overburdened judicial system, 
and the fact that witnesses and others with information are 
reluctant to work with prosecutors out of fear for their own 
safety.  The report notes, however, that few cases have been 
formally dismissed. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Advances Under Technical Cooperation Program 
-------------------------------------------- 
5. (U) In conjunction with the Technical Cooperation Program, 
the GOC has worked to strengthen tripartite dialogue through 
a series of seminars, training programs, and social dialogue 
boards involving GOC authorities, labor organizations, and 
employers.  Since its reinstatement in January 2003, the 
Inter-Institutional Commission for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights has conducted over 40 tripartite 
activities designed to strengthen communication and 
cooperation, including a series of dialogues chaired by 
Santos and other high-ranking GOC officials.  The Commission 
has also worked closely with the Ministry of Interior and 
Justice (MOI/J) to increase resources and decentralize the 
GOC\'s protection program, which provided protection to 5,221 
at-risk union members, politicians, journalists, political 
figures, and human rights workers in 2003.  The Commission 
has also provided training to protection program 
administrators, local police, and judicial authorities in 
order to shift the focus of the program from merely reacting 
to human rights violations toward taking concrete steps to 
prevent them. 
 
6. (U) The MSP, in cooperation with the Office of the 
Prosecutor General (Fiscalia), has conducted seminars on 
international labor law for prosecutors and judges, 
instructing them on the fundamentals of international labor 
law and the scope of activities protected under international 
humanitarian law.  These programs have also urged prosecutors 
to speed up investigations of human rights violations of 
trade unionists.  The MSP has also conducted training 
programs for labor inspectors and regional employees of the 
Ministry. 
 
------------------------------ 
Statistics Confirm Improvement 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (U) Santos cited MSP statistics asserting that murders of 
trade unionists dropped from 120 in 2002 to 51 in 2003, a 
decline of 58 percent.  Santos credited the decline to 
improvements in the GOC\'s protection program and a change in 
paramilitary strategy related to ongoing demobilization 
negotiations with the Government.  (Note: The percentage 
decline in murders of trade unionists cited by the MSP is 
slightly higher than the 51 percent decline reported by the 
National Labor College (\"Escuela Nacional Sindical,\" or ENS), 
a respected labor rights NGO that reported that 90 trade 
unionists were murdered in 2003, compared with 184 in 2002. 
Although MSP\'s statisticians agree that more trade unionists 
were murdered than the numbers they cite, they explain that 
they only cite cases in which union leaders or members are 
killed because of their trade union activities.  MSP did not 
include, for example, cases in which unions members died as a 
result of land disputes, crimes of passion, automobile 
accidents, and the transport of explosive materials.  End 
note.)

Santos: Information Campaign Long Overdue 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) In response to questioning, Santos confirmed that 
the GOC has not done a good job of \"selling its successes.\" 
He asserted that European NGOs and parliamentarians only hear 
one side of the story from a small number of left-leaning 
NGOs and unions whose \"destructive syndicalism\" (as opposed 
to \"constructive syndicalism,\" in which unions, employers, 
and the government work together) is bent on damaging the 
credibility of the GOC.  Santos asked those present to 
support GOC efforts to portray the \"full picture.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
GOC Looking Forward, Focusing on Europe and Geneva 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
9. (U) FM Barco announced her plans to travel to Europe in 
the near future to meet with a key group of Colombian 
ambassadors to develop a strategy to communicate the GOC\'s 
advances in protecting and promoting workers\' human rights. 
This strategy will focus on changing perceptions of 
Colombia\'s labor environment among key NGOs, 
parliamentarians, opinion leaders, and foreign unions.  In 
order to highlight a \"new sense of cooperation\" between labor 
unions and the GOC, MSP is working with Colombia\'s three 
major labor federations -- the United Workers Central (CUT), 
the General Federation of Democratic Workers (CGTD) and the 
Confederation of Colombian Workers (CTC) -- on a proposal to 
deliver a joint report to the ILO\'s Freedom of Association 
Committee in June.  The report would attempt to present a 
consensus perspective on the labor environment, but would 
acknowledge points of disagreement as well. 
 
------------------------- 
Reaction: GOC Can Do More 
------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) Although generally supportive of the GOC\'s plan, 
many attendees noted that improved statistics and a status 
report alone would not be enough to satisfy the concerns of 
the international community.  Noting that the majority of 
union members are detained for reasons other than trade union 
activities, the UK Ambassador asked the GOC to provide 
regular, public updates on high-profile detentions to explain 
what motivated them.  Santos stated that the majority of 
detainees are charged with rebellion and that arrest warrants 
have been issued prior to all detentions.  The attendees 
agreed that similar updates on GOC responses to alleged human 
rights violations committed against trade unionists and other 
at-risk groups would be useful.  The German CDA observed that 
the fact that only four percent of the Colombian labor force 
is unionized will limit the scope of what the GOC can 
accomplish through traditional tripartite mechanisms. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (U) The GOC\'s democratic security policy and 
GOC/paramilitary demobilization negotiations have led to a 
significant reduction in violence, including against trade 
union members.  Vice-President Santos and the MSP\'s 
commitment to improving the GOC\'s relationship with 
Colombia\'s trade unions is evident in their efforts to 
advance legal cases related to violence against trade union 
leaders, improve tripartite dialogue, and protect and promote 
trade union members\' human rights.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) On March 10, the Colombia office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) released its 2003 
report on the human rights situation in Colombia.  The report 
states that although the GOC has made some progress, the 
human rights situation remains critical.  It also claims that 
the GOC has failed to fully comply with a majority of the 27 
human rights recommendations published in last year\'s report, 
and includes 27 recommendations for 2004, 23 of which are 
carried over from 2003.  The GOC said the report did not give 
its democratic security policy enough credit for improving 
the human rights situation and did not adequately emphasize 
the gravity of the threat posed by the illegal armed groups. 
We will continue to work with the GOC, UNHCHR, and the G-24 
to help with compliance in 2004.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
UNHCHR Releases its 2003 Human Rights Report on Colombia 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2. (U) On March 10, the Colombia office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR), under director 
Michael Fruhling, released its human rights report for 2003, 
which states that although advances have been made, the human 
rights situation in Colombia remains critical.  It notes that 
the country\'s three principal illegal armed groups (the FARC, 
ELN, and AUC) continued terrorizing the civilian population 
through bombings, kidnappings, the recruitment of minors, and 
the use of anti-personnel mines.  Terrorist organizations 
also disregarded international humanitarian law and ignored 
the UN\'s human rights recommendations. 
 
3. (U) The report acknowledged that the Government made some 
advances.  Declines in homicides, massacres, attacks on 
civilians, indiscriminate attacks, hostage taking, acts of 
terrorism, and forced displacements were noted positively and 
attributed in part to the presence of state security forces 
in all municipalities.  Still, the UN called for other state 
institutions, such as the Inspector General\'s Office 
(Procuraduria) and the Human Rights Ombudsman\'s Office 
(Defensoria), to have a similar presence throughout the 
country.  The report also acknowledged the Government\'s 
willingness to negotiate with illegal armed groups. 
 
4. (C) UNHCHR remains concerned about an increase in 
complaints of arbitrary or illegal detentions, forced 
disappearances, extrajudicial executions, and violations of 
the rights to due process and privacy.  The report reiterated 
concerns about:  links between paramilitaries and government 
officials, particularly by members of the military and the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office (Fiscalia); significant 
paramilitary influence in certain regions of the country; and 
paramilitary ceasefire violations.  It also expressed its 
concern that the proposed \"conditional parole\" bill would 
allow paramilitary members to escape criminal sentences.  The 
report noted an increase in complaints of torture and 
mistreatment by government authorities.  (Note: According to 
Max Furrer (strictly protect), Protection Coordinator for the 
Colombia office of the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC), the ICRC has not seen an increase in official 
mistreatment -- including torture -- of detainees in 2003. 
End note.)  The report also highlighted the critical 
circumstances of \"vulnerable\" populations, such as women, 
children, indigenous persons, and Afro-Colombians. 
 
------------------------------ 
The 27 Recommendations of 2003 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (U) The report acknowledged Government progress on several 
of the office\'s 27 human rights recommendations for 2003, but 
noted that the GOC began to implement the recommendations )- 
inconsistently -- only in the final months of 2003.  UNHCHR 
said it has had fluid dialogue with diverse GOC entities, 
&but the commitment to put these recommendations into effect 
was rejected by some of the highest officials, which limited 
satisfactory implementation of the majority of them.8  As 
noted in more detail in reftel, the GOC has fulfilled the 
recommendation on anti-personnel mines (13), achieved 
significant progress in improving the effectiveness of the 
Early Warning System (1), and made some, but not enough, 
progress in protecting human rights defenders (2), increasing 
protection for communities at risk (4), and improving the 
public security forces\' compliance with international 
humanitarian law (12). 
 
------------------------------- 
More Recommendations for 2004 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The High Commissioner proposed another set of 
recommendations for 2004, again grouped under six headings: 
prevention and protection; the internal armed conflict; the 
rule of law and impunity; economic and social policies; the 
promotion of a culture of respect for human rights; and 
technical cooperation and advice from his office.  Nineteen 
recommendations are directed exclusively at the Colombian 
state (including Congress and the independent Prosecutor 
General\'s Office), four to illegal armed groups, and four to 
the GOC, civil society, and illegal armed groups jointly. 
Twenty-three recommendations are carryovers -- some slightly 
revised -- from the 2003 list.  The four new recommendations 
are: 1) the High Commissioner urges all those directly 
involved in the internal armed conflict to observe the 
humanitarian principles of limitation, distinction, and 
proportionality; 2) the High Commissioner exhorts the 
Prosecutor General to safeguard and respect the independence 
of prosecutors in the performance of all their duties and 
guarantee that detentions and searches are supported by 
sufficient evidence; c) the High Commissioner calls on the 
Office of the Inspector General and the Office of the Human 
Rights Ombudsman to promote and instill respect for 
procedural guarantees for those deprived of liberty whose 
legal situation has not been defined; and d) the High 
Commissioner recommends that the Government and organizations 
of human rights defenders develop and institutionalize stable 
communication channels, at both national and regional levels. 
 
 
------------ 
GOC Response 
------------ 
 
7. (U) Carlos Franco, director of the Presidential Program 
for Human Rights, responded to the UN\'s report for the GOC. 
He said the report failed to give the GOC enough credit for 
human rights progress achieved as a result of President 
Uribe\'s democratic security policy.  Franco added that the 
report did not sufficiently emphasize the threat posed by 
illegal armed groups, which at present makes it practically 
impossible for the state to fully \"guarantee\" civilians\' 
human rights.  Franco reacted favorably to the report\'s plea 
for regular interaction between the GOC and UNHCHR, and was 
pleased with the report\'s acknowledgment of declines in 
various categories of human rights violations and the GOC\'s 
willingness to dialogue with illegal armed groups.  He 
concluded by stating that the GOC believes that strengthening 
democratic security throughout the country is the best 
guarantee of human rights and that the GOC will continue to 
work on implementing UNHCHR\'s 27 human rights recommendations. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Comment:  The UN\'s report was as expected.  Although 
Fruhling noted some progress by the GOC, he continued to 
insist on a strict interpretation of what the GOC must do to 
comply with various recommendations.  For example, despite 
the fact that many representatives of the international 
community disagreed, Fruhling maintained that the GOC did not 
satisfy a recommendation regarding human rights training 
because the training was not conducted specifically by the 
Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman. (Note: For 2004, the 
reference to the Ombudsman\'s Office as the only entity 
capable of carrying out the training has been removed.  End 
note.)  Among the 23 recommendations carried over to 2004 are 
three with which the GOC has repeatedly stated it disagrees, 
namely, an independent review of military intelligence files 
(although the requirement of a published report has been 
removed), a request not to implement the anti-terrorist 
statute, and the immediate suspension, in advance of 
investigations, of military personnel accused of human rights 
violations.  End comment.

1.  (C) Summary:  In a meeting with President Uribe on March 
15, INL A/S Charles and Ambassador Wood welcomed Uribe\'s 
March 22-25 visit to Washington, lauded the decrease in 
violence under Uribe, stressed the need for eradication in 
national parks, and reiterated the importance we place on 
extradition in the context of negotiations with the 
paramilitaries.  President Uribe reiterated his commitment to 
extradition and the need for continuation of Plan Colombia 
beyond 2005.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) INL A/S Bobby Charles and Ambassador Wood met with 
President Uribe on March 15 in Bogota.  The U.S. side 
included INL/LP Director Tom Martin, NAS Director Phyllis 
Powers, NAS Deputy Roger Carignan, and Poloff Brian Walch 
(notetaker).  Uribe was accompanied by Foreign Minister 
Carolina Barco, Defense Minister Jorge Alberto Uribe, and 
Plan Colombia Coordinator Luis Alfonso Hoyos. 
 
3.  (C) Uribe reaffirmed his tough line on negotiations with 
the paramilitaries, but expressed concern that they were 
asking for relief from the possibility of extradition as a 
condition for concentrating their forces.  Uribe noted that 
concentration of paramilitaries was the only way to ensure 
that they stopped their violent actions and complied fully 
with their promised cessation of hostilities.  Ambassador 
Wood stressed the importance that the U.S. places on 
insulating the question of extradition in the negotiation 
process (and in deliberations on the conditional parole 
bill).  Ambassador Wood also noted that the Uribe 
Administration\'s discussions with the paramilitaries had 
already greatly reduced violence against civilians.  A/S 
Charles and the Ambassador advised Uribe to refrain from any 
decision on the peace process until he had completed his 
upcoming visit to Washington. 
 
4.  (C) Uribe called for continuation of Plan Colombia beyond 
2005.  He stated that had it not been for the program, 
criminal and terrorist elements would have won out in 
Colombia.  A/S Charles agreed, stressing that it is important 
to finish building the \"entire house.\"  Ambassador Wood noted 
that the original goal of Plan Colombia was 50 percent 
eradication by 2005.  While that goal has been surpassed, 
much work needs to be done to reach 100 percent.  Ambassador 
Wood lamented that the GOC\'s seized assets program was facing 
difficulties owing to fear on the part of potential 
legitimate buyers. 
 
5.  (C) A/S Charles stressed the importance of beginning 
eradication programs in Colombia\'s national parks. 
Ambassador Wood reminded Uribe that coca cultivation was far 
more detrimental to the environment than chemicals used in 
eradication.  Uribe agreed on the need to address the parks 
problem.

1.  (SBU) Summary:  In a two-day visit to Colombia, Ecuador\'s 
President Lucio Gutierrez met with President Alvaro Uribe, FM 
Carolina Barco, Bogota Mayor Lucho Garzon, and business 
leaders; spoke to a joint session of Congress; and was 
honored with Colombia\'s highest medal.  Border control, 
immigration, and trade were the public themes of the visit. 
While many issues between the two nations are thorny, the two 
heads of state enjoy an amicable relationship.  Gutierrez 
made a surprise endorsement of reelection for Uribe.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) President Lucio Gutierrez made his first official 
visit to Colombia March 16-17.  Uribe and Gutierrez signed a 
44 point joint declaration (emailed to WHA/AND) which, inter 
alia, called for additional efforts to combat terrorism, 
information sharing along the border, and a new association 
agreement between the Andean Pact and Mercosur.  Uribe and 
Gutierrez also announced installation of a Colombian Marine 
Corps base at the confluence of the San Miguel and Putumayo 
Rivers and the continuation of stationing GOC citizen 
soldiers (soldados campesinos) along the border.  Gutierrez 
was circumspect regarding the capture of FARC leader \"Simon 
Trinidad\" in Quito in late December.  Gutierrez recognized 
the problem of flow of arms from Ecuador to Colombia, but 
stressed that the weapons were of foreign origin.  (Note: 
Gutierrez\'s comment spoke to GOC public speculation last year 
that a rocket used in a FARC assassination attempt in Bogota 
came from an Ecuadorian Army arsenal.  End Note.) 
 
3.  (SBU) Uribe formally thanked Gutierrez for humanitarian 
protection for Colombians seeking refuge in Ecuador. 
(Comment: During a PRM visit in early March to Ecuador, a GOE 
Foreign Ministry official lamented that the GOC had never 
publicly thanked Ecuador for the assistance they have 
provided to Colombian citizens seeking refuge.  End Comment.) 
 Gutierrez lamented that undocumented Colombians working in 
Ecuador were exposed to exploitation.  (Comment: The flow of 
asylum seekers from Colombia to Ecuador this year is 900 per 
month, down from 1200 per month last year but still up from 
2002.  End Comment.)  The Presidents agreed to take the 
following steps to address migration and refugee issues: 
 
--Beginning April 1, Colombians entering Ecuador will be 
required to present a document verifying their good standing 
with the GOC, after a security background check is conducted. 
--Beginning December 31, 2005, Colombians will be required to 
present an Andean passport, or, failing that, a Colombian 
passport. 
--After analyzing the large displacement of Colombians to 
Ecuador, both Presidents will request that international 
organizations provide assistance to this population, 
including arranging voluntary return to Colombia.  The GOC\'s 
Social Solidarity Network, which coordinates assistance to 
the displaced, will assist them in Colombia. 
 
4.  (SBU) Colombia is Ecuador\'s second largest trading 
partner, and Gutierrez expressed hope that Ecuador\'s 
bilateral trade deficit might be reduced.  In a speech to 
local businessmen, Gutierrez asked them to buy Ecuadorian 
products.  He said that he hoped to see Colombian investment 
in oil production, hydroelectric development, agriculture, 
highways, and tourism.  GOC MFA Director of Multilateral 
Economic, Social, and Environmental Affairs, Ambassador Fabio 
Ocasiones, characterized the Presidents\' agreement to work 
toward lowering the cost of electricity as one of the visit\'s 
most important outcomes.  Ocasiones explained that in the 
two-way market for electricity, Ecuador is the primary 
consumer and that Colombia charges more per unit sold. 
According to Ocasiones, Ecuador will be the primary 
beneficiary of the agreement.  At the same meeting with 
businessmen, Gutierrez unexpectedly endorsed reelection for 
Uribe. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  The December Simon Trinidad arrest was a 
major boost for Ecuador in the minds of both the GOC and the 
Colombian public.  In more than one meeting with us during 
the last two months, President Uribe praised Gutierrez for 
the arrest and stressed that while working-level strains 
continued, he and Gutierrez maintained a strong and cordial 
relationship.  Regarding illegal flow of arms, in a private 
discussion with poloff, Ocasiones (protect) expressed concern 
that some of the 8,000 Ecuadorian troops stationed near the 
border are currently involved in the trafficking of arms and 
chemical precursors.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ELAB, PGOV, CO 
SUBJECT: COLOMBIA GOES BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD ON PENSION 
REFORM 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified -- please protect accordingly 
 
SUMMARY 
1.    (SBU) Faced with the impending default of the Public 
Pension Fund (managed by the Institute for Social Security), 
the GOC is once again attempting to overhaul its public 
pension system. This marks the Uribe administration\'s third 
attempt to fix the problem, after the 2002 pension reform was 
gutted in the Congress and the referendum\'s attempt to push 
through reforms failed in October 2003.  The GOC cannot 
afford its current public system, which covers only 20 
percent of all workers and is an odd mix of special regimes 
educators, petroleum and military) that give the top five 
percent benefits 180 times greater than the basic levels. 
Central government pension spending has quadrupled over the 
past decade and now accounts for about 3.4 percent of GDP. 
Moreover, pension debt is the second largest contributing 
factor to the GOC\'s chronic financial deficits (just behind 
fiscal transfers to regional and local governments).  As a 
result of the funding imbalance of the public pension system, 
the GOC\'s total indebtedness is expected to rise from 
slightly over 50 percent to almost 60 percent of GDP by 2010 
unless serious reforms are enacted.  President Uribe has 
formed a multi-sectoral group that includes businessmen, 
labor leaders, members of Congress and civil society leaders 
to develop a comprehensive reform package that he hopes to 
have approved by the Congress this year.  While many 
recognize the dire pension situation, the necessary reforms 
are unlikely to be politically viable.  End Summary 
 
THE CURRENT SITUATION 
 
2.    (SBU) Over the past decade, pension spending has 
drained the budget.  The Ministry of Finance and Public 
Credit reports that 16 percent of the total central 
government budget and 22 percent of the operational budget is 
destined to pay pensions.  Despite such heavy spending, the 
public social security system will run out of reserves in 
2004. The National Financial Association (ANIF) projects that 
as a result public debt as a percentage of GDP will grow from 
52.7 percent last year to 59.6 percent by 2010. 
 
3.    (SBU) The current system evolved from 1993 reforms 
modeled after the pension system in Chile.  It is a 
two-pillar system where employees can choose to join a 
private, defined contribution plan, or join the state social 
security plan.  Private pension plans are well-funded, with 
over USD 8 billion currently invested in the system.  The 
public system, however, has run out of funding.  Unlike other 
countries that adopted such systems, Colombia\'s system had 
neither a clear transition mechanism that would induce 
workers to transfer to a private system nor a final-end date 
for participation in the public system.  Worse yet, lucrative 
special pension regimes were maintained, making it more 
beneficial for individuals to remain in these public regimes 
rather than opting for private systems. As a result, a decade 
after the initial 1993 reform, the public system still covers 
50 percent of the insured. 
 
4.  (SBU) In late 2002, the Colombian Congress approved a 
pension reform plan that will increase the contribution rate 
to 15.5% in 2006 and will also gradually increase the minimum 
required for coverage from 500 to 1300 weeks. A critical 
reform, the elimination of the special pension regimes, was 
taken out of the 2002 reforms by the Congress and also failed 
to pass in the October 2003 referendum.  These regimes 
account for approximately 50 percent of the benefits in the 
public pension system and allow some workers to contribute 
for less than a year to receive a pension at 55 (50 for 
women) that is 90 percent of their highest salary. Other 
reforms required would eliminate the Mesada 14 (an additional 
allotment given to pensioners as a way to secure their 
savings against inflation, which prior to the late nineties 
averaged 20 percent per year) and standardize the minimum 
benefit at a level below the minimum monthly wage of 
approximately USD 1500 a year (which represents the current 
floor for pension benefits). In addition a major element of 
the proposed reforms would have been to remove the tax exempt 
status of pension beneficiaries. Had the full reforms sought 
in the 2002 draft law or in the 2004 referendum vote been 
approved, the pension system would have significantly moved 
toward long-term balance. In addition, such reforms would 
have made the private pension plans, which are adequately 
funded, more attractive, thereby reducing the number of 
individuals in the public system. Instead, the GOC will give 
the Social Security Institute 713 Billion pesos to cover the 
second half of 2004. 
 
CURRENT REFORM PLANS 
 
5.    (SBU) Vice Minister of Social Protection, Jairo Nunez, 
told econoff that the Presidentially-mandated commission to 
reform the pension system has agreed on four main areas for 
action.  First, the public and private sector agree that 
Mesada 14 is an exceptional drain. President Uribe disagrees 
because he understands it is an important political issue and 
has stated that it can not be completely cut. Second, there 
is universal agreement that special regimes, especially for 
some government workers and oil workers, must be cut. The 
government has said that special regimes for the military 
will continue, though there are some that believe that these 
benefits should be reduced.  Third, discussions concerning a 
reduction in the minimum pension will be politically 
difficult, yet the savings to the system are critical. 
Finally, there are many workers under special contracts that 
receive benefits not contained in the basic system, which the 
commission believes should be cut. 
 
6.    (SBU) These excessive benefits are bankrupting the 
system.  For example, 16 percent of pension costs go just to 
pay Mesada 14, and 60 percent of public-sector pensioners 
receive the minimum pension which is the same as their last 
monthly, working wage.  Minister of Social Protection Diego 
Palacio believes that fully reforming the system could reduce 
the fiscal deficit by about USD 700 million in the short run 
while also stabilizing the system for 20 to 25 years. 
According to Minister Palacio, eliminating the Mesada would 
save the GOC USD 19 million in the first year while minimum 
salary reforms could save USD 46 million. 
 
7.    (SBU) Minister of Finance Carrasquilla, while 
announcing the goals of the multi-sectoral commission, urged 
the public to understand the fiscal importance of these 
reforms. Minister Palacio echoed this and cast the issue as a 
rational decision for the Congress -- either reform the 
system or let the government go bankrupt. The administration 
hopes such arguments, and close cooperation with Congressmen 
on the multi-sectoral commission, will allow the reforms to 
go through Congress quickly.  Some reforms, such as lowering 
the minimum level of pensions and taxing pensions, require 
constitutional amendment which require eight separate votes 
over two different Congresses. If successful in the 
March-June congressional session (majority vote by quorum of 
legislators), the bill would also have to pass by a qualified 
majority (majority of total members) in the July-December 
session. According to many observers, the most costly (both 
politically and fiscally) of the reforms, the elimination of 
Mesada 14 and, most especially the establishment of a minimum 
pension, will not pass.  Vice Minister Nunez suggested that 
the next step would be to tax Mesada 14 at such a high rate 
that it is virtually eliminated (but President Uribe opposes 
this).  In addition, the commission is  considering a scaled 
system where lower pensions would receive a full month\'s 
wages and those with higher pensions would receive a lower 
percentage of their final salary. 
 
COMMENT 
 
8.    (SBU) Only 20 percent of the population is covered 
under the current pension system, yet public pensions cost 
about 3.4 percent of GDP.  This number will grow to 6 percent 
in 2010, in effect consuming all new revenues projected from 
the 2002/2003 tax reforms. Opinions within government as to 
the possibility of pension reform are split. An official at 
the central bank noted that he is not optimistic about 
passage of any pension reforms while a senior official at the 
Ministry of Finance noted that pension reforms will face a 
hard fight, but that they will pass.  On March 15, 
legislators within the multi-sectoral commission formed by 
President Uribe announced its intention to support 
legislative reforms which would eliminate special pension 
regimes and Mesada 14 benefits for new retirees while 
maintaining them for existing pensioners.  Other issues, such 
as reducing the minimum pension level and taxing pensions, 
were put on the back burner.  Despite government assurances 
to the contrary, political difficulties will prevent a 
definitive solution to the problem.  At best the politically 
acceptable reforms are likely to delay the pension system 
reckoning day. END COMMENT.

REF: BOGOTA 2806 
 
1.  (U) Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 
 
2.  (U) Summary:  The March 12-15 visit to Colombia by INL A/S 
Robert Charles combined field visits to NAS-supported counter- 
narcotics and law enforcement programs and briefings and meetings 
hosted by key GOC leaders.  In his conversations with GOC 
leadership, A/S Charles noted the GOC\'s recent accomplishments in 
pursuit of important counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, rule of 
law, and human rights objectives.  A/S Charles took advantage of a 
one-hour meeting with President Uribe to raise the issue of aerial 
eradication in Colombia\'s national parks and protected areas and 
President Uribe flagged several topics he hoped to explore with 
high-level officials during his planned March 22-24 visit to 
Washington (see septel).  End summary. 
 
Colombian National Police Training 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) On March 13, Ambassador accompanied INL A/S Robert Charles 
on an inspection of Colombian National Police (CNP) training 
facilities in Espinal, Tolima Department.  Escorted by CNP 
commander Major General Jorge Daniel Castro and CNP Antinarcotics 
Directorate director Brigadier General Luis Alberto Gomez, A/S 
Charles observed field demonstrations by Jungla (CNP Special 
Forces) units and Carabineros (Mobile Rural Police).  A/S Charles 
was guest of honor at ceremonies marking the graduation of three 
Carabinero companies that had completed an intensive seven-week 
training program.  In a prepared address, A/S Charles noted the 
significant role played by CNP units in completing the process of 
reinserting public security forces in all of Colombia\'s 1098 
municipalities (reftel).  A/S Charles also cited the training 
provided to Jungla and Carabinero units by US Special Forces as an 
indication of the USG\'s commitment to supporting and sustaining an 
effective bilateral partnership in pursuit of common goals: the 
defeat of international terrorism and narcotics trafficking and 
the establishment of stability and rule of law throughout 
Colombia. 
 
4.  (U) A/S Charles and Ambassador had further opportunity to 
engage PNC leaders on counter-narcotics and interdiction 
strategies and operations conducted by CNP elements.  In an 
interview with leading TV network, Caracol, arranged by PAS, A/S 
Charles commented on the objectives and successes of the Air 
Bridge Denial program and the importance of addressing the issue 
of coca cultivation in national parks and protected areas in the 
context of the growing severity of the problem and the constraints 
applicable to eradication in these areas.  He highlighted the 
successes in the drug war under the Uribe administration and 
emphasized the damage being done to Colombia\'s environment by the 
cultivation and production of narcotics.  The interview ran on the 
evening news nationwide.  Other Colombian media also covered the 
visit and several articles ran in the press the following day, 
characterizing the purpose of visit as a review of US assistance 
to Colombia.  In addition to the Ambassador, A/S Charles was 
accompanied by INL/LP Tom Martin, NAS Director, MilGroup 
Commander, and NAS Program Officers. 
 
Ministry of Defense Briefings 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) On Sunday, March 14, A/S Charles, DCM, NAS Director, 
MilGroup Commander, and NAS Program Officers were briefed by 
Colombian Military (COLMIL) leaders on key missions and 
organizational objectives.  Colombian Army (COLAR) MG Reinaldo 
Castellanos, COLMIL Joint Task Force Commander for Plan Patriota 
Phase 2, provided an overview of GOC strategy for pacification of 
southern regions of Colombia.  COLAR Carlos BG Carlos Suarez 
briefed A/S Charles on the mission, deployment, and successes of 
the COLAR Counter-narcotics (CD) Brigade, which performs 
interdiction operations and provides critical support and 
defensive operations in conjunction with aerial eradication 
operations.  COLAR Colonel Rey and NAS Program Officer then 
briefed on the organization and mission of the COLAR Aviation 
program, which includes training and support for COLAR aviation 
assets that provide mobility and logistical support for 
eradication, interdiction and counter-terrorism operations.  The 
morning concluded with a briefing by NAS Program Officer and 
Colombian Air Force Colonel on the Air Bridge Denial program and a 
tour of the Colombian Air Force\'s Command and Control Center 
(CCOFA). 
 
Eradication/Colombian National Police Aviation 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6.  (U) Afternoon activities featured a tour of the NAS-funded 
maintenance facilities at the CNP Aviation (ARAVI) base in 
Guaymaral, near Bogota.  A/S Charles examined a number of static 
displays and toured ongoing maintenance and repair activities 
being conducted at the facility.  DIRAN Director BG Gomez and 
ARAVI personnel then briefed A/S Charles on the CNP\'s aerial and 
ground eradication strategies, operations, and program results. 
This visit provide A/S Charles with an opportunity to discuss CNP 
needs and capabilities with CNP Aviation personnel and to 
reinforce their understanding of US objectives.  A/S Charles was 
accompanied by DCM, NAS Director, and NAS program officers. 
 
Ministry of Interior and Justice 
-------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) On March 15, A/S Charles met with Minister of Interior 
and Justice Sabas Pretelt.  Pretelt stated that the GOC was moving 
aggressively on its asset forfeiture program, noting that 
approximately 200 assets, including farms and houses valued at 
approximately USD 10 million, had been seized the previous week 
from one narcotics trafficker alone (Luis Hernando Gomez).  The 
government intends to intensify its efforts in this area, 
conducting a thorough property registration and seizing land used 
to cultivate illicit crops, as well as other assets derived from 
narcotics trafficking.  Funds generated by this process will 
finance the prosecution of narcotics traffickers and the 
construction of new prisons.  Pretelt said that 64,000 inmates 
were now confined in prisons designed for 48,000 and that vigorous 
police and prosecutorial work was putting an additional 1,000 
criminals behind bars every month.  A/S Charles noted that the GOC 
had developed significant momentum in its campaign against 
narcotics traffickers and other criminal elements, and that asset 
forfeiture weakens these organizations even further. 
 
8.  (SBU) Pretelt said that the GOC\'s policy on extradition caused 
problems within Colombia, especially in the context of evolving 
policies regarding demobilization of paramilitary groups, but that 
the GOC had no intention of changing its extradition policy or 
practices at this time.  A/S Charles expressed the USG\'s 
appreciation for Colombia\'s cooperation and resolve on extradition 
of individuals indicted by US courts. 
 
9.  (SBU) Pretelt and A/S Charles agreed on the importance of 
aerial eradication as a means of cutting off funds to narco- 
terrorists and Pretelt pointed to the spraying of mixed 
coffee/coca plantations as an example of the GOC\'s resolve to 
press ahead aggressively on eradication.  He noted, however, that 
there would be significant political fallout attendant to spraying 
in national parks, protected areas, and indigenous zones.  A/S 
Charles underscored the importance of communicating and 
publicizing the environmental harm that drug cultivation and 
processing causes and that aerial eradication, properly conducted, 
is a safe, efficient, and effective means of protecting parks. 
Over all, A/S Charles noted, Colombia was to be commended for its 
progress on eradication of illicit cultivation.  A/S Charles was 
accompanied by DCM, INL/LP Tom Martin, and NAS Director. 
 
Colombian Legislators 
--------------------- 
 
10.  (U) A/S Charles and Ambassador met with Senators Alvaro 
Araujo (Senate Vice President), Jairo Clopatofsky (Chair, Defense 
and Foreign Relations), Carlos Garcia (former President), Habib 
Merheg (member, Defense and Foreign Relations), and Representative 
Telesforo Pedraza (member, Constitutional Affairs).  The 
discussion centered on the USG\'s counter-narcotics strategy, 
eradication efforts in national parks, money laundering and asset 
seizure, and the conditional parole bill for former paramilitary 
fighters. 
 
11.  (SBU) A/S Charles and Ambassador Wood praised bilateral 
counter-narcotics cooperation.  In response to a question 
regarding drug consumption in the United States, A/S Charles 
reviewed the five pillars of USG strategy--prevention, enforcement 
of laws, treatment, interdiction, and money laundering--and noted 
that roughly 50 percent of the counter-narcotics budget was 
devoted to prevention and treatment.  The Ambassador described the 
USG\'s push/pull strategy of exerting force against drug 
trafficking leaders while enticing the lower ranks into legitimate 
economic activity. 
 
12.  (SBU) Rep. Pedraza asked A/S Charles and the Ambassador about 
aerial eradication in Colombia\'s national parks.  The A/S and the 
Ambassador explained that coca cultivation itself was far more 
damaging to the environment than any possible USG-GOC eradication 
efforts inasmuch as coca processing entailed the indiscriminate 
use and disposal of much greater quantities of chemicals that are 
more harmful than those employed in eradication operations.  They 
urged those truly interested in protecting national parks to focus 
on the immediate threat: that the coca cultivation and processing 
industry is rapidly increasing its foothold in the only areas of 
Colombia where they are immune to aerial eradication, i.e., 
national parks and other protected areas. 
 
13.  (SBU) A/S Charles noted significant USG progress on fighting 
money laundering, including closure of a substantial number of 
bank accounts worldwide, and the Ambassador praised the recent 
multimillion-dollar asset seizure.  Senator Merheg expressed 
concern that military and police battlefield successes against the 
guerrillas and paramilitaries might motivate the two groups to 
join forces with traditional drug traffickers. 
 
Ministry of Defense 
------------------- 
 
14.  (U) Minister of Defense Jorge Alberto Uribe noted that 
Colombia was engaged in a war against \"multinational criminal 
organizations,\" not \"guerrillas\" or \"insurgents.\"   With USG 
assistance, he said, Colombia has now \"turned the corner of a very 
long block.\"  A/S INL Charles noted the coincidence of US and GOC 
national interests, including the campaigns against narcotics 
trafficking and international terrorism.  He praised GOC\'s 
remarkable results on these fronts and cited President Uribe\'s 
inspiring leadership as a critical factor.  He said that he was on 
solid ground when testifying before the US Congress in support of 
Colombian programs, adding that \"we must continue, not stop after 
we have turned the corner.\"   Minister Uribe said the recent 
improvement in security and increased stability were having a 
positive effect on trade and investment.  He cited the increase in 
cultivation of African oil palm, a crop that requires five years 
to show a return on investment, as an indication of growing 
confidence by investors in Colombia\'s future. 
 
15.  (SBU) The MOD said he had met in February with his 
counterparts from Peru and Brazil to discuss closer cooperation on 
intelligence sharing, and aerial, coastal, and riverine 
interdiction operations.  Minister Uribe characterized the talks 
as productive and said that follow-on discussions with Peru are 
scheduled to take place this June in Bogota.  These discussions 
will include officials from the Peruvian Ministry of Interior, 
under which the Peruvian Police are organized, and will involve 
counter-terrorism information sharing. 
 
16.  (SBU) Minister Uribe stressed the importance of regional 
planning and cooperation on interdiction, noting that a cocaine 
HCl shipment from Peru was recently seized on a Mexican fishing 
vessel.  Colombian Navy (COLNAV) Admiral Soto added that the USG- 
GOC Maritime Agreement was working well, with the COLNAV seizing 
more than 20 metric tons of cocaine in the first ten weeks of CY 
2004 (Note: All Colombian Public Forces seized a combined total of 
120 MT in the 12 months ending February 29, 2004.)  Ambassador 
Wood stressed that the significance of Colombia\'s Pacific coast as 
the source of narcotics shipments--and the success of maritime, 
coastal, and riverine operations-argued for more balance in the 
deployment of interdiction resources between Pacific and Caribbean 
operations. 
 
17.  (U) Minister Uribe called attention to the progress Colombia 
has made in combating money laundering, adding that Colombia would 
be willing to share its experiences with other countries.  A/S 
Charles concluded the conversation by praising the GOC for its 
eradication and interdiction program results and noting the 
coincidence of US and GOC interests.  A/S Charles was accompanied 
by the Ambassador, INL/LP Tom Martin, NAS Director, and MilGroup 
Commander. 
 
President Uribe 
--------------- 
 
18.  (SBU) A/S Charles opened a one-hour conversation with 
President Alvaro Uribe by praising Uribe\'s leadership, his 
commitment to our bilateral agenda, and the GOC\'s impressive 
results in combating narcotics trafficking and international 
terrorism.  President Uribe responded by thanking A/S Charles for 
USG assistance, but noted that the task remains incomplete and 
continued effort is required.  President Uribe, Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Carolina Barco, MOD Uribe, and Plan Colombia 
Coordinator Luis Alfonso Hoyos then engaged A/S Charles and 
Ambassador Wood in a discussion of a wide range of issues, 
including possible topics for meetings with USG officials during 
President Uribe\'s planned March 22-24 meetings in Washington (See 
Septel.) 
19.  (U) A/S Charles did not have an opportunity to clear this 
message.

SUBJECT: GOC CONCERNED ABOUT UN DRAFT RESOLUTION ON 
CHILDREN AND ARMED CONFLICT 
 
 
Classified By: CDA Milton K. Drucker, Reasons: 1.4 B & D. 
 
1.  (C) Charge was called to the Foreign Ministry on March 26 
by Acting Minister Jaime Giron to discuss the GOC\'s 
reservations about two aspects of the UNSC Draft Resolution 
on Children and Armed Conflict.  Referring to the 
resolution\'s operative paragraph 7bis, Giron expressed 
concern about the use of the term \"parties\" in reference to 
the FARC and ELN guerrilla groups and the AUC paramilitary 
group, stating that the term implied that Colombian 
narco-terrorist groups were \"parties to a conflict\" rather 
than merely being illegal armed groups without political 
support.  Secondly, referring to operative paragraph 3, Giron 
worried that Colombia could become a \"UN Security Council 
agenda item.\"  Giron pointed out that the citation on 
Colombia was different than most of the other countries in 
Annex II of the Secretary General\'s Report on Children and 
Armed Conflict.  We understand Colombian Ambassador Moreno 
also phoned A/S Holmes with the same concerns. 
 
2.  (C) Action request:  Post would like to assist the GOC 
particularly on the wording issue.  The USG has named the 
FARC, ELN, and AUC terrorist organizations and we are 
sympathetic to Colombian concerns on the language of the 
draft resolution.

WRAP-UP 
 
REF: MSG/AMEMBASSY BOGOTA/08 JULY 03 SUBJ IMPACT FROM 
 
     LACK OF FUNDS ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE 
     SECURITY STRATEGY (ISS) PROGRAM 
 
1.    SUMMARY: THE EMBASSY COUNTRY TEAM RECENTLY COMPLETED 
ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF OF WORK IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT. IN 
THAT TIME THE US HAS TRAINED ALMOST A BATTALION AND A HALF OF 
COUNTERGUERRILA SOLDIERS, CONDUCTED NUMEROUS MEDICAL 
ASSISTANCE VISITS, AND ESTABLISHED A COMBINED INTELLIGENCE 
CENTER. HOWEVER, TRAINING FOR GROUND FORCES WILL END IN 
DECEMBER 2004, AS THE FUNDS WILL BE COMPLETELY EXPENDED. THE 
HELICOPTER PACKAGE DESIGNED TO COMPLEMENT THE GROUND 
COMPONENT TO ESTABLISH AN AIR-GROUND QUICK REACTION FORCE 
WILL NOT FULLY ARRIVE UNTIL MARCH 2005. THIS WILL LEAVE THE 
PROGRAM HALF WAY TOWARDS ITS INTENDED GOAL. THE COUNTRY TEAM 
RECOMMENDS THAT THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXTENDED FOR A YEAR AT 
A MINIMUM TO ALLOW EFFECTIVE AIR GROUND INTEGRATION TRAINING 
AND AT A MAXIMUM FOR THREE YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH THE LONGER 
TERM GOAL OF SECURING THE ENTIRE PIPELINE AND SURROUNDING 
INFRASTRUCTURE. //END SUMMARY. 
 
2.    DISCUSSION: IN RESPONSE TO 170 ATTACKS ON THE CANO 
LIMON OIL PIPELINE THAT SHUT DOWN THE PIPELINE FOR 247 DAYS 
IN 2001, THE US AND COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENTS HELD SEVERAL 
BILATERAL CONFERENCES TO ASSESS THE SITUATION AND DEVELOP A 
LONG TERM RESPONSE TO THESE TERRORIST CHALLENGES (THIS 
PIPELINE CURRENTLY PRODUCES APPROXIMATELY 97,000 BARRELS A 
DAY, EARNING AN ESTIMATED ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF WHICH 
THE COLOMBIAN ECONOMY RECEIVES ROUGHLY 85 PERCENT). AS A 
RESULT OF THESE MEETINGS, THE US CONGRESS ALLOCATED USD 99 
MILLION FOR THE PROTECTION OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN 
ARAUCA DEPARTMENT. THE COUNTRY TEAM, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT, USED THE APPORTIONED FUNDS TO PURCHASE 
A HELICOPTER PACKAGE AND INITIATE A PLANNING ASSISTANCE AND 
TRAINING PROGRAM IN NOVEMBER 2002.  THE INTENT OF US SUPPORT 
IS TO ENABLE COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES TO TAKE A MORE 
PROACTIVE APPROACH TO SECURING THE PIPELINE AND OTHER VITAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE.  THIS CONCEPT PLACES HEAVY EMPHASIS ON 
INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION, OPERATIONALIZING THAT INTELLIGENCE 
INTO ACTIONABLE PLANS, AND RESPONDING WITH QUICK REACTION 
FORCES. 
 
3.    TO DATE THE ISS PROGRAM HAS SUCCEEDED IN TRAINING OVER 
SIX COMPANIES CAPABLE OF RAPIDLY RESPONDING TO INTELLIGENCE, 
EXECUTING EFFECTIVE PATROLLING TECHNIQUES, AND CONDUCTING 
URBAN OPERATIONS. THESE CAPABILITIES HAVE ALLOWED THE BRIGADE 
TO GREATLY REDUCE ATTACKS AGAINST THE PIPELINE (DOWN TO 18 
AND 32 IN 2002 AND 2003 RESPECTIVELY) WHILE ALSO HELPING 
RESTORE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY IN THE DEPARTMENT. THE PLANNING 
AND ASSISTANCE ROLE OF THE US SPECIAL FORCES (USSF) PERMITTED 
THESE HIGHLY SKILLED SOLDIERS TO PROVIDE ADVICE ON HOW TO 
IMPROVE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THIS 
IS MORE THAN A USMILGP PROGRAM, IT IS A MULTI-AGENCY EFFORT 
WITH OFFICES FROM NAS, ORA, AND USAID PROVIDING CRUCIAL 
SUPPORT.  THE COLOMBIANS, WITH THE SUPPORT OF US SERVICE 
MEMBERS, WERE ABLE TO OPERATIONALIZE THE INTELLIGENCE GAINED 
FROM THE 
ORA-FUNDED COMBINED INTELLIGENCE CENTER. NAS HAS BEEN HEAVILY 
ENGAGED WITH THE COLOMBIANS REGARDING INCOMING AIRCRAFT, 
WHILE USAID ASSISTED WITH THE DELIVERY OF SCHOOL SUPPLIES 
THAT WERE DONATED TO LOCAL SCHOOLS. 
THE INFORMATION OPERATIONS (IO) CAMPAIGN IS ANOTHER SUCCESS 
STORY AND A STRONG REINFORCING EFFORT TO THE OPERATIONS AND 
INTELLIGENCE INITIATIVES. ALREADY THERE HAVE BEEN TWO MEDICAL 
ASSISTANCE VISITS (OVER 4700 MEDICAL AND DENTAL PATIENTS 
TREATED), A VETERINARY ASSISTANCE VISIT, REPAIR PROJECTS FOR 
A MEDICAL CLINIC AND SCHOOLS THAT HAS ENCOURAGED THE LOCAL 
POPULACE TO LOOK TOWARDS THE GOVERNMENT FOR HELP IN PROVIDING 
BASIC NECESSITIES. A ROBUST PYSOP PROGRAM THAT RELIES ON 
RADIO, LEAFLETS, AND POSTERS HAS ENCOURAGED THE TOWNSPEOPLE 
AND CAMPESINOS TO RESIST TERRORIST ACTIONS WITHIN THEIR AREA 
AND ALSO TAUGHT THEM HOW TO REACT TO A TERRORIST ATTACK. THE 
IO PROGRAM HAS DECREASED CIVILIAN INTERFERENCE WITH SECURITY 
OPERATIONS AND IMPROVED HUMINT SOURCES AS THE MESSAGE OF WHO 
REALLY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE 
CIVILIANS, STANDARD OF LIVING AND SENSE OF SECURITY HAS BEEN 
EFFECTIVELY TRANSMITTED. THE ISS PROGRAM HAS ALSO HELPED 
WEAKEN THE NARCOTERRORISTS, STRANGLEHOLD ON LOCAL 
GOVERNMENTS. 
 
4.    THE PROBLEM: THE GROUND ELEMENT OF THE ISS PROGRAM WILL 
TERMINATE IN DECEMBER 2004 WITH THE EXHAUSTION OF THE 
ALLOCATED FUNDS, AND THE OVERALL PROGRAM WILL CEASE SHORTLY 
AFTERWARDS WITH THE MISSION ACCOMPLISHING BUT A SMALL PART OF 
THE OVERALL VISION. 
 
5.    DEFINING THE PROBLEM:  THE ISS PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO 
FUNCTION AS AN INTEGRATED GROUND AIR OPERATION SUPPORTED BY A 
PLANNING AND ASSISTANCE TEAM FROM A USSF COMPANY. 
UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO CONTRACTUAL DELAYS THE AIR COMPONENT (8 
HUEYS AND 2 BLACKHAWKS) WILL NOT FULLY ARRIVE IN COUNTRY 
UNTIL MARCH 2005 AT THE EARLIEST AND WILL NOT BE READY FOR 
AIR-GROUND TRAINING UNTIL JUNE 2005. WITH USSF TROOPS 
SCHEDULED TO DEPART IN DECEMBER 2004 (WITH THE END OF FUNDS 
FOR GROUND TRAINING), THIS WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE 
AIR ASSAULT TRAINING BETWEEN AIR AND GROUND UNITS AS THE 
LEADERS AND MEN OF BOTH COMPONENTS WILL NOT HAVE HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE APPROPRIATE TRAINING FROM USSF FORCES. 
WHILE USMILGP-BOGOTA HAS WORKED TO AMELIORATE THIS PROBLEM BY 
HAVING UNITS IN ARAUCA TRAVEL TO TOLEMAIDA FOR ABBREVIATED 
AIR ASSAULT TRAINING (WHERE OTHER COLOMBIAN PILOTS ARE 
UNDERGOING BASIC ROTARY WING TRAINING FOR THE PLAN COLOMBIA 
HELICOPTERS), THE FACT IS THAT THIS TRAINING DOES NOT 
ENCOMPASS THE ENTIRE BRIGADE, COVERS ONLY THE BASICS, AND IS 
NOT CONDUCTED WITH THE PILOTS WITH WHOM THEY WILL CONDUCT 
OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE ABSENCE OF USSF TRAINERS WILL 
ALSO MEAN THE 18TH BRIGADE STAFF (HIGHER HEADQUARTERS IN 
ARAUCA DEPARTMENT) WILL NOT RECEIVE PLANNING ASSISTANCE FROM 
US EXPERTS ON HOW TO BEST INTEGRATE THIS NEW MOBILITY 
CAPABILITY INTO COMBAT OPERATIONS. FINALLY, MOST OF THE 
EQUIPMENT FOR THE GROUND UNITS WILL NOT ARRIVE UNTIL THE FALL 
OF 2004. 
 
6.    THE US PRESENCE HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE 
SECURITY SITUATION AND THE COLOMBIANS HAVE ADJUSTED TO 
COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF HELICOPTERS, HOWEVER, THE 
NARCOTERRORISTS HAVE COUNTERED THESE EFFORTS BY GOING AFTER 
ELECTRICAL TOWERS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS NEW 
DIRECTION OF ATTACK HAS EXCEEDED THE COLOMBIANS CAPABILITY TO 
RESPOND TO ATTACKS ON NUMEROUS TOWERS IN THE REGION WITHOUT 
THE USE OF ROTARY WING ASSETS. NEVERTHELESS, THIS IS ANOTHER 
EXAMPLE WHERE THE USSF STRUCTURE IS CURRENTLY ASSISTING THE 
COMMANDER AND HIS STAFF WITH DEVELOPING NEW WAYS TO LESSEN 
THE IMPACT OF THESE ADDITIONAL ATTACKS--A CAPABILITY NOT 
AVAILABLE AFTER 31 DECEMBER 2004. 
 
7.    AS TO THE LONGER TERM PROBLEM, BOTH THE US AND 
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENTS SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT THAT 
SPECIFIED THE OBLIGATIONS OF EACH GOVERNMENT. THE US 
GOVERNMENT HAS DILIGENTLY AND RESPONSIBLY WORKED TOWARDS 
FULFILLING THESE OBLIGATIONS. TRAINING FOR THE GROUND UNITS 
IS ON TARGET TO HAVE TRAINED AT LEAST THREE (OUT OF SIX) 
COUNTERGUERRILLA BATTALIONS OF THE 18TH BRIGADE AND PROVIDED 
CONTINUAL PLANNING AND ASSISTANCE TO THE 18TH BRIGADE STAFF. 
THE HELICOPTER PROGRAM IS ON TRACK TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED 
INFRASTRUCTURE, HELICOPTERS, PILOT AND CREW TRAINING. 
HOWEVER THE VISION AS STIPULATED IN THE MOA, SHOULD 
ADDITIONAL FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE, IS THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD 
ENHANCE THE PROTECTION OF THE ENTIRE PIPELINE. THE ISS 
PROGRAM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL, AND THE US GOVERNMENT SHOULD 
REINFORCE THIS SUCCESS BY ENSURING THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY 
DEVELOPS A MATURE AND WELL ROUNDED CAPABILITY TO REACT TO 
ATTACKS EXECUTED BY NARCOTERRORISTS. 
 
8.    RECOMMENDATIONS: 
 
A. NEAR TERM (PHASE 1): THE ISS PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXTENDED AT 
LEAST AN ADDITIONAL YEAR, UNTIL THE END OF THE 1ST QUARTER 
FY06, IN ORDER TO ENABLE GROUND FORCES TO TRAIN WITH THE AIR 
ASSETS PROVIDED TO THE 18TH BRIGADE BY THE US GOVERNMENT. 
THIS WILL ENSURE THE COLOMBIANS BECOME PROFICIENT IN THE 
PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF AIR ASSAULT OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT 
THE PIPELINE PROTECTION INITIATIVE. 
 
(1) THE US GOVERNMENT WOULD EXECUTE THESE SPECIFIC TASKS: 
(A) INTEGRATION OF GROUND AND AIR COMPONENTS 
(B) EXTEND SUPPORT TO NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT 
(C) CONTINUE SUPPORT FROM KM 0 TO KM 178, AS THIS IS THE MOST 
VULNERABLE AREA TO ATTACK BASED ON HISTORICAL AND CURRENT 
RECORDS. 
 
(2) WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE COST TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM FOR AN 
ADDITIONAL YEAR (JAN-DEC 05) AND TO TRAIN AND PARTIALLY EQUIP 
ADDITIONAL UNITS WILL BE: 
 
(A) $5.50M FOR TRAINING AND TRAINING AMMUNITION 
(B) $1.00M FOR LOGISTICAL SUPPORT 
(C) $0.50M FOR FP INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
B. LONG TERM (PHASE 2): IN THE SPIRIT OF THE MOA BETWEEN OUR 
GOVERNMENTS, WHICH IS BASED ON A LONG TERM APPROACH, TO 
SECURE THIS IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION INITIATIVE IT 
IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS PROGRAM BE FUNDED UNTIL 2007. 
CONTINUATION OF THIS MISSION WOULD ALSO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT 
TIME FOR THE EXTENSION OF INTELLIGENCE AND OPERATIONAL 
PLANNING TO THE NORTH ALONG THE PATH OF THE PIPELINE. 
 
(1) THE US GOVERNMENT WOULD EXECUTE THESE SPECIFIC TASKS: 
(A) EXTEND SUPPORT AND INTEGRATION OF PIPELINE AND OTHER 
SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCURE TO THE COAST. 
(B) TRAIN AND ASSIST UNITS ALONG THE PIPELINE BASED ON A 
THOROUGH STUDY OF THE SITUATIONAL AND INTELLIGENCE PICTURE OF 
THE AREA TO INCLUDE THE STANDING MISSIONS OF THE UNITS, 
TERRAIN, AND ENEMY TACTICS. 
(C) CONTINUE SUPPORT FROM KM 0 TO KM 178 OF THE PIPELINE FOR 
THE REASONS STATED IN PHASE I. 
 
(2) THE ANTICIPATED COST OF THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS: 
 
(A) JAN-DEC 06: 
            $5.50M FOR TRAINING AND TRAINING AMMUNITION 
              $3.00M FOR EQUIPMENT 
              $2.00M FOR INFRASTRUCTURE 
              $1.50M FOR LOGISTICS SUPPORT 
 
(B) JAN-DEC 07: 
  $5.50M FOR TRAINING AND TRAINING AMMUNITION 
              $3.00M FOR EQUIPMENT 
              $0.50M FOR FP INFRASTRUCTURE 
              $1.50M FOR LOGISTICS SUPPORT 
 
(C) THE DIFFERENCE IN COSTS BETWEEN 2005 AND YEARS 
2006-2007 REFLECTS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRAINING 
ADDITIONAL UNITS AND AT NEW BASES AS THE PROGRAM EXTENDS TO 
THE NORTH WHEREAS THE 2005 FUNDS ARE FOR A CONTINUATION OF 
THE ONGOING TRAINING (AND INTEGRATION OF THE AIR COMPONENT 
INTO MILITARY OPERATIONS). THE FORCE PROTECTION MONEY FOR 
2005 IS TO INSURE THE BASES IN NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT 
HAVE MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR US FORCES 
PROVIDING PLANNING AND ASSISTANCE FOR ONGOING OPERATIONS, BUT 
IS NOT INTENDED FOR A CONTINUAL US PRESENCE. THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS IN 2006 ARE FOR A CONTINUAL US PRESENCE 
(AS IN SARAVENA) AND IS FRONTLOADED SO ALL INFRASTRUCTURE 
IMPROVEMENTS ARE COMPLETE PRIOR TO 2007.

the extractive industry.  ACP and BP requested USG and UK 
assistance encouraging relevant GOC agencies to participate 
in the implementation of the plan.  Specifically, they are 
interested in securing GOC cooperation to vet 
privately-contracted security teams and public security 
forces contracted via Ecopetrol by the extractive companies. 
ACP\'s work plan anticipates an industry-wide workshop in 
April aimed at developing a baseline consensus among 
producers as well as a series of regional workshops with 
local law enforcement and military to bring the GOC onboard. 
Emboffs expressed concern that the work plan seemed to come 
up short on civil society involvement and encouraged ACP to 
consider efforts to solicit input from labor organizations 
and NGOs before final agreement on an industry-wide baseline 
position.  End Summary. 
 
------- 
Context 
------- 
 
2. (U) Since the initial VP meeting hosted by the U.S. 
Embassy in September 2003 (reftel), ACP held a series of 
one-day workshops in November 2003 with its members to 
develop a draft work plan on VPs.  The draft work plan 
integrates topics such as corporate responsibility, 
transparency of revenue distribution, risk assessment, best 
practices, ethical principles, human rights and social 
management in hopes of developing a consensus on minimum 
baseline standards that would govern the business practices 
of ACP members.  The workshops consisted of presentations 
from companies that currently support VP, including BP, 
Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and ChevronTexaco; discussion of 
the U.N. Global Compact; and consideration of an OXY case 
study on pending lawsuits alleging OXY\'s involvement in the 
1998 Santo Domingo massacre (septel). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Draft Work Plan: Civil Society Participation Later 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3. (SBU) Based on the September meeting and the November 
workshops, ACP and BP have designed a draft work plan that 
focuses on using best practices and development of an 
intra-industry information sharing network that would 
facilitate risk assessment procedures.  ACP plans to host a 
two-day workshop in April to present the draft work plan and 
to formulate a set of baseline standards for implementation 
of VPs.  Begining in April, ACP also intends to host a series 
of eleven regional workshops with local law enforcement and 
public security forces to develop an infrastructure for 
cooperation.  In response to emboffs\' concerns that the draft 
work plan did not seem to integrate input from civil society 
-- primarily labor organizations and human rights NGOs -- ACP 
and BP noted that the high degree of mistrust between the 
private sector and civil society precluded the inclusion of 
civil society representatives in initial discussions.  Noting 
our concern that NGOs and organized labor might be 
disinclined to participate as a result of being excluded from 
the formulation process, ACP and BP insisted they will reach 
out to NGOs and organized labor only after ACP\'s membership 
has agreed on a set of baseline standards.  BP noted that 
they would enlist the support of U.K.- and U.S.-based human 
rights organizations in reaching out to Colombian organized 
labor and NGOs. 
 
--------------------- 
GOC Assistance Needed 
--------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) ACP and BP stated that industries can accomplish 80 
percent of work plan implementation alone.  The remaining 20 
percent will require GOC assistance in order to obtain 
necessary information to conduct environmental, security and 
other risk assessment studies and to vet privately-contracted 
security companies and public security forces contracted by 
Ecopetrol, which traditionally receives logistical or 
financial support from extractive producers.  ACP and BP 
noted that they plan to request U.K. and U.S. Embassy 
assistance in communicating the importance of these 
activities and the need for GOC cooperation. 
 
------------- 
Looking Ahead 
------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Despite the exclusion of civil society participants, 
formulation of the draft work plan represents an important 
step forward.  Post will continue to monitor the VP 
implementation process at each stage and will continue to 
stress the importance of involving civil society actors early 
in the process.  The Uribe administration has expressed 
strong support for implementation of VPs.  As a result, 
obtaining GOC cooperation in risk assessment and review 
procedures is not a matter of GOC resistance or lack of 
political will.  It is, rather, a question of overcoming 
legal and technical restrictions on information sharing that 
might be as simple as the development of a 
red-light/green-light system designed to safeguard protected 
or sensitive information.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The deaths on March 19 of eleven people -- seven anti- 
kidnapping police and four civilians -- at the hands of the 
Colombian Army (COLAR) in Narino department has sparked 
controversy.  The Colombian National Police (CNP) and Army have 
presented contradictory accounts of the 
incident, and President Uribe has asked the Ministry of Defense 
(MOD) to present him with a consensus account by April 2.  Over 
the past week, the press has focused on inconsistencies in the 
COLAR and CNP accounts of the incident, as well as on 
disagreements between the two security services.  To provide 
closure, at the very least the MOD\'s report would have to 
clarify whether: 1) the CNP were clearly identifiable as police; 
2) they were authorized to operate in the area; 3) the COLAR was 
operating on credible intelligence and acted responsibly; and 4) 
the COLAR appropriately handled the investigation immediately 
following the incident and did not attempt a cover-up.  Such a 
short-fuse report may not adequately address these and other 
questions, but the answers must eventually be found if the COLAR 
and CNP are to work together effectively.  End Summary. 
 
-------------- 
The \"Incident\" 
-------------- 
 
2.  (U) On the night of March 19, in what is being variously 
described as an ambush, an execution, or a friendly fire 
accident, the Colombian Army (COLAR) killed eleven people in a 
police convoy in the municipality of Guaitarilla, Narino 
department.  The victims, who included four civilians and seven 
members of a Colombian National Police\'s (CNP) Anti-Kidnapping 
Group (GAULAs), were traveling along a rural highway in an area 
with a heavy presence of illegal armed groups when they were 
fired on by about forty COLAR forces from the Third Division\'s 
Boyaca 
Battalion.  All eleven passengers were killed; COLAR forces 
suffered no casualties. 
 
3.  (C/NF) The incident has sparked controversy and confusion 
both publicly and within the Ministry of Defense (MOD). 
Initially, the COLAR and the CNP publicly offered markedly 
different accounts of the incident, and the President (who was 
in Washington, DC at the time) prohibited both institutions from 
commenting further in public.  Compounding difficulties the GOC 
faces in investigating an incident that occurred in largely 
hostile territory, no local eyewitnesses to the event have been 
identified.  Although the Prosecutor General\'s Office 
(\"Fiscalia\") is conducting an investigation, President Uribe has 
demanded that the MOD submit its own internal report on the 
incident by April 2, in which the COLAR and CNP reach consensus 
on what occurred.  Uribe clearly hopes the report will put an 
end to public speculation. 
 
-------------------- 
Conflicting Accounts 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C/NF) The COLAR claims its actions were based on 
intelligence about ongoing narcotics trafficking activities in 
the area.  According to the COLAR, its forces attacked vehicles 
carrying individuals in camouflage uniforms armed with 
revolvers.  Armed Forces Commander General Carlos 
Alberto Ospina and Army Commander General Martin Orlando Carreno 
have commented that the GAULA members\' presence late at night on 
a rural road is suspicious, and Carreno has taken no 
administrative action against the COLAR members involved in the 
incident, pending an investigation. 
 
5.  (S/NF) The CNP, on the other hand, claims its troops were 
involved in an approved anti-extortion operation, and were 
accompanied by at least one civilian informant and two or more 
civilian detainees.  According to the CNP, its troops were on 
their way to Pasto, capital of Narino department, to process the 
detainees when they were attacked.  Money the COLAR found in the 
vehicles was being used by the informants as part of a sting 
operation.  Contrary to COLAR reporting, the CNP says its 
members were wearing standard issue police uniforms and carrying 
rifles.  The CNP also alleges that the COLAR cordoned off the 
area after the incident and, rather than immediately informing 
the CNP about the tragedy, publicly announced a successful 
operation against paramilitaries and only told the CNP about its 
officers\' deaths the following day.  Upon learning of the 
incident, the CNP Deputy Director asked that the COLAR wait for 
the Prosecutor General\'s Office to 
arrive before tampering with the scene. According to CNP 
sources, the COLAR ignored this request and instead flew the 
bodies back to Pasto in helicopters, where they were delivered 
to the victims\' families.  The source goes on to say that all of 
the victims\' clothing and jewelry were missing, except for one 
GAULA hat left in a vehicle. 
 
--------------- 
Inconsistencies 
--------------- 
 
6.  (C/NF) In trying to piece together the incident, GOC 
investigators and the press have uncovered many inconsistent, 
suspicious, and/or confusing details. 
 
--  (U) The Prosecutor General\'s Office (Fiscalia) says the 
bodies appear to have been tampered with.  In addition, ten 
bodies were found on the ground outside their vehicles and shot 
at point-blank range, suggesting they were not killed in an 
ambush, as the COLAR claims. 
 
--  (U) The CNP claims the GAULAs had authorization from CNP 
leadership in Bogota to travel through the area.  However, the 
military was apparently not notified.  Some observers find it 
suspicious that such a small number of police would be traveling 
on official business on a rural road in the middle of the night 
in an area with a large presence of illegal armed groups.  At 
the very least, it is clear that the CNP and COLAR did not 
adequately coordinate operations. 
 
--  (U) The GAULAs were not accompanied by a prosecutor and were 
operating outside a metropolitan area, both of which violate 
regulations for local GAULA units.  The CNP has explained away 
this concern by asserting that four of the officers were 
assigned to the national unit. 
 
--  (C/NF) Two alleged police survivors of the incident have 
come forward, contradicting the first military justice official 
to arrive on the scene, who claimed there were no survivors. 
According to the first of these, the GAULAs were in the area 
conducting an anti-drug trafficking operation.  If this were the 
case, it would explain COLAR 
reports that drugs were found in the vehicles, but 
simultaneously raises questions about why the GAULAs -- an anti- 
kidnapping and anti-extortion unit -- were conducting an anti- 
narcotics operation.  However, serious questions have been 
raised about this individual\'s credibility, and 
some reports now claim he is actually a police informant who 
came forward two days after the incident with a bullet wound 
that doctors determined was received just hours earlier. 
 
--  (U) According to press reports, a second alleged survivor, 
who is reportedly entering the Prosecutor General\'s witness 
protection program, claims the 11 persons were murdered after 
exiting their vehicles and conversing with COLAR forces.  This 
witness claims he exited one of the vehicles and hid in the 
underbrush when he noticed a suspicious roadblock ahead.  From 
there, he made two cell phone calls to his brother, one of the 
civilian informants in the groups, who said the GAULAs were 
arguing with the soldiers about turning over their weapons. 
Shortly thereafter, he heard shots and could no longer 
communicate 
with his brother.  The credibility of this witness has yet to be 
determined. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C) It is important that the GOC resolve this incident as 
soon as possible in order to minimize the damage already caused 
to traditionally strained relations between the CNP and the 
COLAR.  The MOD\'s report to the President may adequately explain 
what happened on the night of March 19.  However, given the 
short timeframe for delivery of the report and the complicated 
nature of the incident, this is unlikely.

SUBJECT:  DC-3 Accident March 28, No Injuries 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  A Colombian National Police (PNC) DC-3 
aircraft (tail number PNC 0214) crashed upon landing in Caruru, 
Vaupes Department, on March 28.  No injuries or fatalities 
resulted, but an initial inspection has concluded that it is not 
economically feasible to repair the aircraft. PNC and NAS safety 
experts are conducting a bilateral accident investigation. Initial 
indications suggest that the accident may have been the result of 
pilot error.  NAS will conduct a thorough review of DC-3 pilot 
training with the PNC.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) On March 28, 2004, at 1:15 p.m. a DC-3 (PNC tail number 
0214), during an approach at Caruru (one of the towns in Vaupes 
Department where a police presence was re-established only two 
months ago) lost control and subsequently crashed.  The crew of 
four sustained no injuries as a result of the accident.  A 
preliminary aircraft damage report by NAS sub-contractor 
maintenance personnel has concluded that the aircraft is beyond 
economical repair.  An on-site investigation was conducted by PNC 
safety personnel and the NAS Senior Aviation and Aviation Safety 
Advisers.  A subsequent bilateral accident investigation will be 
conducted by PNC and NAS safety personnel. 
 
3.  (SBU) On March 28, 2004, a PNC aircrew of four, including the 
pilot, Captain Monsalve (with 546 flight hours as a DC-3 command 
pilot and 1235 hours as a DC-3 co-pilot), departed El Dorado 
Police Base in Bogota at 5:30 a.m. on a general support mission 
with multiple stopovers.  The route of flight was Bogota - San 
Jose de Guaviare - Mitu - San Jose - Caruru.  The crew departed 
San Jose with 4500 lbs of fuel and 3000 lbs of cargo to Caruru. 
The aircraft landed with 3500 lbs of fuel.  Caruru is located 124 
nautical miles on a 145 degree heading from San Jose.  The runway 
at Caruru is an unimproved dirt strip approximately 4000 feet in 
length.  The runway conditions, at the time of the accident were 
reported to be wet from recent rains however suitable for landing 
and takeoffs (another DC-3 landed and took-off from Caruru\'s 
runway less than an hour before PNC-0214 landed).  The reported 
weather conditions were 6000 feet visibility, with a 1300 feet 
overcast ceiling.  A flight plan and risk assessment were 
completed prior to the mission by the PNC which resulted in a risk 
level of medium. 
 
4.  (SBU) The pilot (Monsalve) reported to NAS safety adviser that 
during landing everything appeared normal on touchdown of the main 
wheels and that the runway was wet, but he had no problem 
initially controlling the aircraft.  Monsalve stated that after 
the tail wheel touched down the aircraft began to veer to the left 
and that he could no longer control the aircraft.  He added that 
he was concerned that he would crash into the small houses next to 
the runway so he decided to apply power and bring the tailwheel up 
and thus try to control the direction of the airplane.  He 
successfully brought the nose of the aircraft back towards the 
runway and then decided to apply full power to do a go-around. 
Monsalve noted that he could only get 40 percent power and that he 
could not get the plane to fly.  The aircraft subsubsequently 
veered to the left off the runway, hit a small palm tree with the 
left wing, hopped over a small road, and finally came to rest near 
the bank of a river,but 175 feet from the water. 
 
5.  (SBU) The aircrew was transported to Bogota March 29 for 
toxiocology tests and interviews.  All aircraft maintenance 
records, flight training records, risk assessments, flight plan, 
and information concerning the mission have been secured for the 
accident investigation. 
 
6.  (SBU) Insofar as this is the second accident of a DC-3 in less 
than one year, resulting in the loss of two DC-3s, NAS will 
conduct a thorough review of DC-3 pilot and crew training with the 
PNC with an eye toward ensuring full adherence to all safety and 
training requirements, as well as spot inspections of pilots and 
co-pilots during flights.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH ICRC HEAD OF DELEGATION 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.4 (b)and 
(d).1. (C) 
 
SUMMARY: ICRC Head of Delegation Juan Pedro Schaerer 
visited Ambassador on April 1 to discuss ICRC concerns that 
paramilitary concentration related to demobilization would 
create security vacuums and increase the risk of FARC and ELN 
attacks against civilians.  Schaerer also confided that ICRC 
has observed increased nervousness among the FARC, ELN and 
AUC in the wake of GOC security forces\' successes and 
observed that a larger number of detainees has not caused 
significant problems in Colombian prisons.  While Schaerer 
lamented that the GOC has been unable to focus its efforts on 
displacement issues, he agreed that the Colombian situation 
does not constitute an emergency.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) On April 1, Ambassador met with ICRC Head of 
Delegation Juan Pedro Schaerer to discuss his apprehensions 
about GOC/paramilitary demobilization negotiations.  Schaerer 
agreed that concentrating demobilized forces is the only way 
to accurately identify former combatants but expressed 
concern about a possible increase in forced displacements and 
violence against civilians by both the FARC and ELN if 
Colombian security forces prove unable to fill security 
vacuums left by concentrating forces.  Ambassador responded 
by noting that concentration is the only way to remove 
ambiguity during negotiations and observed that the 
capabilities of GOC security forces have improved 
dramatically over the past year. 
 
3. (C) Schaerer said ICRC has observed nervousness among 
paramilitaries with whom they had met.  Although some have 
indicated a willingness to disarm and face punishment, the 
majority worry about the possibility that the peace process 
might fail, primarily because most paramilitaries do not want 
to fight Colombian security forces and fear even more the 
possibility of fighting a two-front war against the GOC and 
the FARC and ELN.  Per Schaerer, the ELN has been weakened by 
the security forces\' presence in all municipalities, which 
undermines ELN\'s urban base.  Schaerer also noted that 
high-level FARC commanders, in the wake of the arrests of 
\"Simon Trinidad\" and alias \"Sonia,\" are more concerned with 
their own personal security.  Perhaps because senior leaders 
are reluctant to take security risks, ICRC officials have 
been meeting with lower ranking FARC commanders. 
 
4. (C) On prisons, ICRC has noted an increase in the number 
of detainees has not resulted in a corresponding increase in 
problems related to prisoner treatment.  Schaerer confided 
that a higher number of complaints have been reported against 
select GAULA units, but cautioned that the problems were not 
systemic.  Per Schaerer, although there has been an increase 
in the number of paramilitaries detained, the majority have 
been charged with crimes like extortion or illegal possession 
of a firearm.  Unlike members of the FARC and ELN, Schaerer 
explained, paramilitaries cannot be charged with rebellion 
because the GOC has not labeled them \"subversive 
organizations.\".  Schaerer promised to share with us any 
information ICRC develops on problem units within the 
security forces. 
 
5. (C) In response to a question, Schaerer said that although 
Colombia is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis, he does 
not believe the overall situation constitutes an emergency. 
Although the level of violence is high, Colombia\'s problems 
cannot be equated with those of countries like Sudan and 
Liberia.  Schaerer lamented that the GOC has not formulated a 
strategy on displaced persons that integrates the efforts of 
different government ministries.  He also noted that 
paramilitaries constitute the greatest threat to displaced 
populations, because paramilitaries have greater resources 
and a stronger presence in urban areas.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY PROGRAM MISSION STATUS REPORT 
 
1) Presidential Protection Detail (PPD) - President Uribe 
slowed down his travel schedule during March 2004.  He did 
take a trip to the United States from March 22-25, where he 
met with President Bush as well as Secretary of Defense 
Rumsfeld and Senator Leahy.  President Uribe was accompanied 
by Minister of Defense Uribe and Minister of Commerce Botero. 
 
2) On March 30, 2004, U.S. Security Advisors had a brief 
meeting with President Uribe.  He conveyed that he is 
\"infinitely grateful\" for all the support the U.S. 
Government, the U.S. Embassy and the Security Advisors are 
affording his administration. 
 
3) On March 12, 2004, U.S. Security Advisors met with Colonel 
Mauricio Santoyo, Chief of  PPD.  Col. Santoyo began the 
meeting requesting that we proceed with the construction of 
bunkers at Presidential residences in Medellin and Monterria. 
 U.S. Advisor Dorsch subsequently spoke with Embassy 
architect Ochoa and she is proceeding accordingly.  It is to 
be determined whether the bunkers will be subterranean or 
aboveground. 
 
The placement of the two radio repeater towers donated by the 
U.S. Embassy was discussed.  It was originally proposed to 
install them in Cartagena and Medellin.  Col. Santoyo 
requests they be placed in Monterria and Medellin.  U.S. 
advisors concur based on the already-established 
radio/repeater network in Cartagena. 
 
Col. Santoyo conveyed that he would send up to 100 detail 
agents through a basic VIP Protection Training Course if it 
were offered by the U.S. Embassy/U.S. Security Advisors here 
in Bogota.  He conveyed that there have been some transfers 
as well as new additions to the details of the President, the 
First Lady and the children.  He also requested an advanced 
course for his five teams of Advance Agents. 
 
Finally, Col. Santoyo, when asked what equipment the 
Presidential Protection Detail was still lacking, stated that 
the acquisition of six mine detectors, to be used by Advance 
Agents, would be a great asset to the protection of President 
Uribe.  U.S. Advisor Dorsch put in the request that day. 
 
4) Vice Presidential Protection Detail - The windows of the 
Vice Presidential farm in Tenjo were covered with Mylar 
anti-blast film.  In addition, U.S. Advisor Delp conducted a 
routine security survey of the area and assessed that all was 
OK. 
 
5) Mayor of Bogot Protection Detail - On March 5, 2004, the 
second group of protection agents completed the basic VIP 
Protection Course. The students were enthusiastic, extremely 
appreciative and, for the most part, worked well together and 
truly strengthened their sense of teamwork. 
 
6) On March 12, 2004, U.S. Security Advisors met with General 
Garcia and Colonel Coba, Chief of Diplomatic Police and the 
individual to whom the Agent in Charge of the Mayor\'s 
security detail reports.  Mayor Garzon\'s Agent in Charge, 
Captain Baron, was the main topic of conversation. There is a 
lot of dissension and morale issues amongst the security 
agents and it appears to stem from the management style of 
Captain Baron.  His lack of leadership skills was discussed 
and U.S. Advisor Delp conveyed his commitment to work closely 
with Captain Baron to attempt to improve the issues at hand. 
 
Two representatives from the Diogenes Corporation were also 
present at this meeting. The Diogenes Corporation is the 
company contracted to administer the Voice Stress Analysis 
(VSA) exams to the Mayor\'s protection detail.  The results of 
the VSA were discussed and specifics were given for the high 
rate of failure of the test of the Mayor\'s security agents. 
 
7) On March 18, 2004, an armored level V 2004 Ford Explorer 
was donated to Mayor Garzon.  U.S. Security Advisor Delp was 
present, along with Mayor Garzon and the protection detail. 
 
8) Minister of Defense Protection Detail - Minister of 
Defense Uribe had a very active travel schedule during the 
month of March 2004. Besides his trips to Cartagena, Tolima, 
Medellin and other areas of Colombia, he also traveled to 
Washington, DC twice as well as to Lima, Peru.  On all trips 
outside of Colombia, he was unaccompanied by any member of 
his security detail. 
 
9) On March 26, 2004, U.S. Security Advisor Wilkas met with 
MOD Uribe regarding the status of his security/security 
detail.  Minister Uribe stated that he is \"supremely 
grateful\" for all of the support the U.S. Embassy and the 
Security Advisors have given to his protection detail. 
 
Minister Uribe spoke about the success of his trips to 
Washington, D.C., particularly the second trip when he 
accompanied President Uribe on March 22, 2004. 
 
Minister Uribe conveyed his appreciation for putting eight 
members of the security detail through VIP Protection 
training, particularly the Agent in Charge (AIC), Major 
Romero. He also conveyed his enthusiasm to have the rest of 
the security detail members trained in the same program. 
 
Finally, Minister Uribe invited U.S. Advisors to come to his 
residence in Medellin to look at the property and do a 
security assessment. He conveyed that he feels safe in 
Medellin but that he would like our opinion. 
 
10) During the VIP Protection Training Course, which took 
place from February 23, 2004 - March 5, 2004, there were four 
graduates from the Ministry of Defense.  They were excellent 
students and conveyed that they took with them many new 
tools.  Seeing them at the Ministry of Defense the following 
week, they approached U.S. Security Advisors with smiles on 
their face, proud to convey that they were putting into 
practice many of the concepts from the two-week training 
session. 
 
11) On February 27, 2004, O\'Gara-Hess conducted a 15-hour 
surveillance detection course for the newly formed 
Surveillance Detection team, comprised of four individuals 
from Minister Uribe\'s protection detail.  This course was 
specifically designed around the Minister of Defense - his 
residence, his office and places he most frequents.  The 
report back from the course instructors and students conveyed 
that the students performed very well and that it was an 
excellent course. Again, prior to this date, the MOD 
Surveillance Detection team consisted of only one individual. 
 
12) The AIC for the MOD\'s Protection Detail will be out of 
the country from April 5, 2004 until April 30, 2004.  He is 
leaving his responsibilities in the hands of Major Alfonso 
Vega.  On March 26, 2004, this U.S. Protection Advisor met 
with Major Vega for a \"meet and greet\" and express support 
and assistance during his four-week .

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On April 2, Ambassador met with High Commissioner for 
Peace Luis Carlos Restrepo to discuss the paramilitary peace 
process and, especially, to confirm that the GOC would give 
paramilitary leaders no assurances regarding their possible 
extradition to the U.S.  Restrepo explained recent changes to 
the GOC\'s \"Alternative Sentencing\" bill and assured 
Ambassador that, based on President Uribe\'s explicit 
instructions, no extradition assurances will be given. 
Restrepo said the country\'s two largest paramilitary groups, 
the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) and the 
Central Bolivar Bloc (BCB), have agreed to participate in 
joint negotiations with the Government.  Restrepo will 
propose that AUC and BCB leaders concentrate in a 200 sq km 
rural area of Cordoba department (map faxed to WHA/AND), 
where the GOC can monitor them.  In exchange for 
concentrating their troops and enforcing the cease-fire, 
paramilitary leaders will not be arrested while in the 
concentration zone.  The Ambassador stressed the need to 
ensure that the GOC continues to hold concentrating leaders 
responsible for the actions of any of their unconcentrated 
troops.  Restrepo expressed the belief that para leaders are 
accepting GOC conditions because of their reverses on the 
battlefield and promised that commanders who do comply will 
face the full force of the Colombian security forces. 
Restrepo also characterized the predicament of para leader 
Carlos Castano, noting that in the most recent AUC communique 
(ref b) he was a signatory, but not named as either a 
\"comandante\" or a negotiator.   End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
Negotiations Moving Forward 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Restrepo said that President Uribe, his cabinet, and 
congressional sponsors of the \"Alternative Sentencing\" bill 
had achieved consensus on the draft legislation by removing 
any reference to extradition, creating a \"Truth and Justice 
Commission\" to recommend in individual cases who gets what 
benefits, and mandating five to ten-year prison terms for 
serious violations of human rights (ref a).  The country\'s 
two largest paramilitary organizations, the United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) and the Central Bolivar 
Bloc (BCB), had formed a unified negotiating table.  AUC and 
BCB leaders continue to push for GOC commitments not to jail 
or extradite them. 
 
3. (C) Restrepo intends to propose that the 33 AUC and BCB 
commanders concentrate in the para-dominated region of rural 
Cordoba department where peace negotiations have been held. 
GOC security forces, establishing a presence there for the 
first time in years, would surround the 200 square kilometer 
(roughly 11 miles by 7 miles) zone with multiple rings of 
security.  The GOC would not arrest paramilitary leaders in 
this concentration zone. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador suggested that even after paramilitary 
leaders concentrate in the designated zone, thus submitting 
themselves to significant GOC control, they must still be 
held accountable for the actions of their troops and 
compliance with their cease-fire obligations.  It was crucial 
that the paramilitary leaders not be able to insulate 
themselves from responsibility for the actions of their 
troops.  For this to be possible, the GOC would have to 
accept the (unavoidable anyway) continuation of communciation 
between the leaders and their troops.  Restrepo agreed and 
proposed that commanders, on a pre-approved, monitored, and 
case-by-case basis, be allowed to temporarily leave the 
concentration zone in order to ensure compliance by their 
troops.  The Ambassador agreed. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Extradition and Legal Benefits not Negotiable 
--------------------------------------------- 
5. (C) Restrepo emphasized that he will not negotiate 
extradition or any other legal benefits with the 
paramilitaries, despite their constant pressure.  President 
Uribe has instructed him to insist that the paramilitaries 
obey the cease-fire, concentrate their troops, submit to 
verification of the process, and peacefully reinsert 
themselves into civilian society.  Only after they have 
fulfilled these conditions can their legal situation be 
reconsidered under any \"Alternative Sentencing\" legislation 
that might be approved in the future.  Ambassador underscored 
that the U.S. could not support a peace process that 
undermines extradition.  Restrepo said President Uribe is in 
complete agreement and had rebuffed pleas from several 
influential senators that the GOC negotiate the terms of the 
\"Alternative Sentencing\" law directly with paramilitary 
leaders.  According to Restrepo, paramilitary commanders have 
strongly criticized the draft law, accusing him personally of 
wanting to see them imprisoned and penniless. 
 
-------------------- 
Pressuring the Paras 
-------------------- 
 
6. (C) Asked if he believes paramilitary commanders are 
willing to concentrate their troops and negotiate in good 
faith, Restrepo admitted that some commanders, most notably 
notorious drug lord Diego Murillo, alias \"Adolfo Paz\" or \"Don 
Berna,\" are trying to use the peace process to shield 
themselves from the law and expand their illicit activities. 
At the moment, Don Berna holds much sway because of his 
proven military capabilities.  BCB Chief of Operations Julian 
Bolivar and AUC regional commander Jorge Quarenta are growing 
in influence.  Ernesto Baez already has taken over for 
Castano as the chief ideologue of the paras and could replace 
Salvatore Mancuso as the primus inter pares.  Restrepo said 
that commanders with more political aspirations than military 
resources, such as Mancuso, appear to recognize they have 
little choice but to negotiate or live in constant fear of 
being captured by the authorities.  Carlos Castano, long the 
international face of Colombian paramilitarism, has lost most 
of his political and military influence, making a successful 
negotiation his best chance for survival.  In the most recent 
paramilitary communique, Castano is a signatory, but is not 
listed as either a \"comandante\" or a negotiator at the 
\"unified table.\" 
 
7. (C) Restrepo said his objective is to bring all the 
country\'s paramilitary groups under increasingly tighter GOC 
control through continued military pressure.  Looking ahead, 
Restrepo and Ambassador agreed that paramilitary commanders 
who fail to negotiate in good faith must face a full military 
response.

SUBJECT: DECIPHERING THE SIZE OF ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) According to the Colombian Ministry of Defense (MOD), 
at least 20,000 Colombian terrorists, both paramilitaries and 
guerrillas, have deserted or been captured or killed in 
combat with government forces since President Alvaro Uribe 
took office in August 2002.  Still, the estimated numerical 
strengths of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), and paramilitary 
groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia 
(AUC) have not seen corresponding declines.  This apparent 
contradiction can largely be explained by: (1) continued 
terrorist recruiting, (2) truncated criminal cases against 
terrorist suspects, (3) GOC actions that target urban 
militias and civilian terrorist support networks not included 
in MOD estimates of terrorist strength, and (4) estimates 
influenced by the institutional responsibilities of 
particular government entities.  Although the exact size of 
Colombian terrorist groups will never be known with 
certainty, it is clear that the GOC is hitting terrorist 
groups -- both paramilitaries and guerrillas -- and their 
civilian supporters harder than ever before.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
The Numbers in a Nutshell 
------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Colombian Ministry of Defense (MOD) reports that 
between January 2003 and March 2004, nearly 800 
paramilitaries and 2,000 members of the National Liberation 
Army (ELN) and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 
deserted.  Since President Uribe\'s inauguration in August 
2002, the MOD reports that nearly 500 paramilitaries and 
2,800 members of the FARC and ELN were killed in combat and 
over 4,200 paramilitaries and 9,350 members of the FARC and 
ELN were captured by GOC security forces.  In addition, over 
1,000 paramilitaries voluntarily demobilized near the end of 
2003.  Thus, according to official figures, approximately 
6,500 paramilitaries and 14,200 guerrillas have been taken 
off the battlefield in the last 19 months.  However, 
estimates of the numerical strengths of the FARC, ELN, and 
paramilitary groups have not fallen consistent with these 
figures. 
 
3. (C) According to the Department\'s 2002 and 2003 human 
rights reports on Colombia, which used figures similar to 
official GOC estimates, the FARC lost only 3,000 combatants 
in 2003 and the ELN only 1,000, while paramilitary strength 
remained unchanged (the 2003 report estimates there are 
13,500 FARC members, 3,500 ELN, and 12,000 paramilitaries). 
These relatively small declines in official estimates of 
terrorist strength raise questions about the accuracy of GOC 
figures on desertions and casualties suffered by terrorist 
organizations.  However, most of the apparent discrepancies 
can be accounted for by continued terrorist recruitment, 
truncated criminal cases against terrorist suspects, GOC 
actions that target urban militias and civilian terrorist 
support networks not included in MOD estimates of terrorist 
strength, and estimates influenced by the institutional 
responsibilities of particular government entities. 
 
--------------------- 
Recruitment Continues 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C) Aggressive recruiting efforts by illegal armed groups 
compensate for many desertions and casualties.  The GOC does 
not keep statistics on terrorist recruiting, primarily 
because most takes place in areas beyond GOC control. 
However, it is clear that illegal armed groups continue to 
add thousands of new members to their ranks, sometimes by 
force.  In some regions, new recruits fully offset losses 
from desertions, detentions, and deaths.  Recruiting occurs 
primarily in poor rural areas where illegal armed groups 
exercise de facto control.  The FARC, for instance, obtains 
most of its recruits from the eastern departments of Meta and 
Caqueta.  In many of these economically backward regions, 
joining an illegal armed group is a seemingly attractive 
option.  For similar reasons, illegal armed groups have found 
rich recruiting grounds in urban slums, especially on the 
outskirts of Medellin and in southern Bogota. 
5. (C) FARC deserters often report joining guerrilla ranks 
because of FARC promises to care for their impoverished 
families.  A significant percentage of other FARC deserters 
claim they were forcibly recruited, although the 
self-selecting nature of this group makes it difficult to 
extrapolate a reliable percentage of FARC recruiting that is 
forcible.  The ELN, weakened by conflict with paramilitaries 
and increased GOC military pressure, has difficulty 
recruiting new members outside of regions where it still 
enjoys well-established grassroots support, such as the 
departments of Arauca and Norte de Santander.  Paramilitary 
recruits most often join for the promise of a regular, 
relatively generous salary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Many Detainees are Released without Trial 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Another factor offsetting GOC military and law 
enforcement actions against illegal armed groups is the fact 
many detainees are released soon after they are captured. 
The military often detains large groups of persons suspected 
of affiliation with terrorist groups.  Representatives of the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\"), who generally 
accompany military operations, take charge of these 
individuals and check their identities against the names of 
known fugitives.  If there are no outstanding arrest warrants 
against an individual and no additional incriminating 
evidence is immediately available, the suspect must be 
released.  Because Colombian terrorist groups do not have 
internationally recognized \"belligerent\" status, the GOC must 
treat each individual case as a law enforcement matter, 
significantly limiting its ability to incapacitate suspected 
terrorists. 
 
 
7. (C) Even when fresh evidence or outstanding arrest 
warrants legally justify a more lengthy detention, Colombian 
law generally requires that detainees be released if the 
Government fails to file charges against them within 180 days 
of their arrest.  For example, in November 2002, 85 persons 
were detained in Arauca department on suspicion of ties to 
the ELN.  However, only 43 were held beyond the initial 
screening stage, and 37 were released months later because 
the 180 day period -- legally extended in this case under a 
terrorism exception -- expired before criminal charges were 
filed.  Hence, although MOD statistics reflect that 85 
terrorist supporters were arrested, only six actually remain 
in custody.  The GOC does not keep records on how many 
detainees are released.  The National Penitentiary Institute 
(INPEC) reports that approximately 19,000 persons were 
imprisoned for all types of crimes in the past 19 months.  If 
over 13,500 members of illegal armed groups were captured 
during this same time frame, it is probable that large 
numbers of suspected terrorists were released without trial 
or ruled \"not guilty.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Urban Militias and Support Networks Confuse the Numbers 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
8. (C) Urban militias and civilian logistical and 
intelligence support networks contribute significantly to the 
operations of illegal armed groups.  However, their numbers 
are notoriously difficult to estimate, and are not included 
in overall estimates of terrorist strength.  Most law 
enforcement operations against terrorist groups, especially 
in urban areas, target support networks rather than 
combatants.  For example, on March 28, Colombian authorities 
arrested 65 supporters of the FARC\'s Teofilo Forero Mobile 
Column (TFMC); it is unlikely that more than a handful of 
these individuals were included in official GOC estimates of 
FARC numbers.  However, these arrests -- and arrests and 
deaths of other members of urban militias and terrorist 
support networks -- are included in GOC statistics on actions 
against illegal armed groups. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Institutional Environments Influence Opinions 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Particular institutional environments also affect how 
organizations in Colombia, whether government or private, 
formulate statistics on illegal armed groups.  For example, 
MOD estimates of the number of paramilitary fighters have 
remained at or near 12,000 for several years.  However, the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Peace, which is hoping to 
receive international support for its efforts to negotiate 
the demobilization of the AUC, has claimed that as many as 
22,000 paramilitaries could demobilize as a result of its 
efforts.  We suspect that the responsibilities of the High 
Commissioner\'s Office color its interpretation of available 
data and its public estimates of paramilitary strength. 
Undoubtedly, the opinions of other entities are also 
affected, albeit perhaps subconsciously, by their own 
institutional interests. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) Even within the MOD, there are discrepancies and 
disagreements about terrorist strength.  What is clear, 
however, is that the GOC is hitting terrorist groups -- both 
paramilitaries and guerrillas -- and their civilian support 
networks harder than it ever has before.

Summary

1. (SBU) On April 4, Bogota\'s El Espectador newspaper 
published an article about complaints by members of the 
Fiscalia\'s Anti-Narcotics and Maritime Interdiction Unit 
(UNAIM) about polygraph exams recently administered by the 
FBI.  The exams were mandated by Prosecutor General (\"Fiscal 
General\") Luis Camilo Osorio following allegations of 
corruption and collusion with criminal organizations in the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\").  The UNAIM members 
objected to personal questions and complained that examiners 
intimidated and pressured them.  However, the professional 
FBI polygraphers used standard techniques ) the same as are 
used on FBI employees.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
The Offended Fiscalia Employees\' Grievances 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) On April 4, Bogota\'s El Espectador newspaper 
published an article written by members of the Office of the 
Prosecutor General\'s (\"Fiscalia\") Anti-Narcotics and Maritime 
Interdiction Unit (UNAIM).  The article, entitled \"Secrets of 
the FBI Polygraph,\" painted a negative picture of recent 
FBI-administered polygraph exams administered to over 120 
senior officials and members of USG-assisted units in the 
Fiscalia.  In a letter to Prosecutor General Luis Camilo 
Osorio published alongside the article, the UNAIM members 
raised the following objections: (1) the polygraph exams were 
administered by a foreign government; (2) they were an 
invasion of privacy; (3) they violated individual rights, 
including the presumption of innocence; (4) they served to 
intimidate and threaten public servants; and (5) they lack 
scientific reliability.  The employees expressed particular 
objections to alleged questions about drug and alcohol abuse 
and sexual conduct.  According to FBI representatives at 
post, the Fiscalia employees\' assertions are false on several 
counts, some of which are probably attributable to a lack of 
familiarity with polygraph exams. 
 
----------------------- 
A Misunderstood Process 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Among the complaints raised by the Fiscalia 
employees were that polygraphers pried into their personal 
lives, were intimidating, and pressured them to provide 
answers to uncomfortable questions.  In fact, the examiners 
used standard polygraph techniques, including asking a set of 
control questions, providing the questions to each individual 
prior to the exam to give them a chance to ask for 
clarifications, and interviewing individuals for 30 minutes 
before beginning the formal exam.  Aside from questions about 
drug use while a government official, the examiners asked no 
embarrassing personal questions.  The FBI rejects allegations 
that the polygraphers used intimidation tactics, threatened 
examinees, or harangued individuals until a specific response 
was elicited.  As is standard practice, polygraphers may have 
been insistent on particular questions or sets of questions 
in order to: (1) evoke emotions that ensure proper readings 
by the polygraph machine, or (2) overcome inconclusive 
readings.  If an individual test was inconclusive, the 
polygrapher asked more questions until getting a definitive 
reading.  Some test-takers may have misunderstood this 
standard practice.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (S) Embassy has raised U.S. concerns about corruption in 
the Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\") with the 
Prosecutor General (\"Fiscal General\") many times in recent 
weeks, including several at the ambassadorial level.  As a 
result, Prosecutor General Luis Camilo Osorio directed a 
number of senior officials and members of key specialized 
units to be polygraphed.  Although the pass rate was nearly 
80 percent, some key officials failed and many others did not 
show up to take the exam.  Osorio is facing significant 
push-back within the Fiscalia, including a public letter of 
protest from some officials, an attempt to form a labor union 
to address the issue, and public criticism of perceived U.S. 
\"intrusiveness.\"  In order to advance the process, Osorio 
voluntarily took a polygraph test himself, and passed. 
Osorio has agreed to remove officials refusing to take a 
polygraph test or failing one from units and programs working 
with USG agencies.  We have strongly recommended that he fire 
and initiate investigations into officials who failed 
polygraph questions, or did not take the exam, to determine 
if they are guilty of serious criminal activities.  Although 
he says that the bulk of those failing or refusing to take a 
polygraph will be fired, he insists that he does not have 
legal authority to dismiss officials solely on the basis of a 
polygraph.  Osorio has agreed, however, to transfer anyone 
failing or refusing to take the exam to non-sensitive 
positions in the 18,000-person Fiscalia.  He also has agreed 
to make clear to applicants for sensitive positions, 
including the new internal investigation/prosecution unit, 
that taking and passing a polygraph will be necessary to get 
the job.  Osorio said he will try to provide a list of such 
sensitive positions to DAAG Mary Lee Warren when he sees her 
on April 12.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2. (S) In meetings in March and April, DAAG Mary Lee Warren, 
Emboffs, and the Ambassador met several times with Prosecutor 
General (\"Fiscal General\") Luis Camilo Osorio to discuss 
concerns about paramilitary and narcotrafficking-related 
corruption in the Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\"). 
As reported in ref A, we called for all senior officials in 
the Fiscalia to be polygraphed, and for Osorio to establish 
an internal investigation/prosecution unit.  Osorio said he 
would implement the recommendations. 
 
------------------------ 
Polygraphs and Push-back 
------------------------ 
 
3. (C) During the week of March 22-27, FBI polygraphers 
conducted examinations on members of eight units in the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office.  Four of these units receive 
significant USG technical assistance: the Anti-Narcotics and 
Maritime Interdiction Unit (UNAIM), the Witness Protection 
Program, the Anti-Kidnapping Unit, and the Financial Analysis 
Unit (UIAF).  Additionally, officials from the Copyright 
Protection Unit, senior appellate-level prosecutors from 
Bogota and the surrounding department of Cundinamarca, and 
other senior prosecutors in charge of various departments 
throughout the country were tested.  The polygraph 
examinations included questions about ties to criminal 
organizations (paramilitaries, guerrillas, and 
narcotrafficking groups), drug use, improper handling of 
cases and evidence, corruption, and bribery.  In total, 125 
officials, including Osorio, were tested. 
 
4. (C) Twenty-one percent of the officials tested failed. 
The UNAIM director tested \"inconclusive\" and refused to 
retake the exam.  There were also a large number of no-shows, 
primarily appellate level prosecutors.  Of the senior 
district court prosecutors, seventy percent were no-shows. 
Approximately, thirty percent of district prosecutors who 
took the exam failed it. 
5. (C) In reaction to press stories and the sudden 
requirement for polygraphing, many Fiscalia officials have 
begun to push back.  Some members of UNAIM sent Osorio -- and 
then the press -- a letter opposing polygraph exams as an 
intrusion into their personal lives (Osorio has since ruled 
out questions on sexual practices, etc.), as a violation of 
the presumption of innocence, as inconsistent with the 
national constitution and several treaties signed by 
Colombia, and as introducing \"foreign police agents\" into the 
internal affairs of the Fiscalia (ref B).  The letter also 
protested investigatory or disciplinary actions against 
Fiscalia officials, of whom several were on our \"must look 
into\" list.  Osorio says there also has been an attempt to 
form a labor union inside the Fiscalia to oppose his 
measures, but he doubts it will come to anything.  Osorio 
himself bridles at insinuations that he is in any way 
corrupt, blaming rumors to that effect on backlash from 
previous decisions, partisan politics (he is the first 
Conservative Party Prosecutor General in a decade), and 
confusion about who is the genuine author of controversial 
actions.  Osorio volunteered to take a polygraph, both to 
confirm his virtue and provide a leadership example to the 
rest of the Fiscalia.  He passed. 
 
---------- 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
6. (C) Embassy has urged Osorio to: (1) dismiss officials who 
failed the exam or refused to take it from units or programs 
working directly with the USG; (2) investigate officials who 
failed the exam to determine if serious criminal offenses are 
involved; and (3) continue investigations into the former 
administrative director of the Fiscalia (\"Director Nacional 
de Fiscalias\"), Justo Pastor, and Lucio Pabon, former head of 
the Witness Protection Program, both of whom recently 
resigned under allegations of serious misconduct.  Other 
suspected officials have been dismissed, including the 
Fiscalia\'s regional directors in the departments of Cesar and 
Norte de Santander; decisions on whether to conduct 
investigations into their activities are pending.  Osorio 
asserts he does not have legal authority to dismiss officials 
solely on the grounds that they refused to take or did not 
pass a polygraph exam.  He has promised, however, that 
officials refusing to take, or failing, a polygraph would be 
removed from sensitive positions, defined as those working 
with the U.S., those with high levels of responsibility, or 
those in which corrupt outside influences could play a role. 
He has promised to develop a list of such positions, ideally 
for his Washington meetings the week of April 12.  We have 
urged that the list include all office directors, district 
prosecutors, and senior appellate prosecutors (\"Fiscales 
Delegados ante la Corte\"). 
 
7. (C) Osorio has formally established the proposed internal 
investigation/prosecution unit.  He has identified three 
prosecutors for the unit and says he will name investigators 
soon.  We have emphasized to Osorio that before the USG can 
provide evidence and technical cooperation on corruption 
cases: (1) all members of the unit must be polygraphed; and 
(2) the unit must be \"walled-off\" so it has the necessary 
independence and freedom of action.  He has promised that all 
jobs in the unit will be considered \"sensitive\" and therefore 
require polygraphing. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Osorio continues to resist the toughest U.S. urging: 
immediate dismissal of anyone refusing to take, or failing to 
pass, a polygraph exam.  The police, military, and 
intelligence services do not polygraph all their members, but 
only those in sensitive positions or who work with us. 
Within the 18,000-person Fiscalia, there is room to transfer 
suspect officials to less sensitive positions.

SUBJECT: 90-DAY GOALS UPDATE 
 
REF: BOGOTA 00552 
 
1.  (U) In January, U.S. Embassy Bogota identified three 
discrete goals which, with diligence, we sought to complete 
within the subsequent 90 days.  The following is an update as 
of March 31. 
 
NAS 
--- 
 
2. (SBU) NAS goal (abbreviated): We will develop an effective 
manual eradication option against coca and poppy cultivation, 
capitalizing on our extensive support to the Mobile Rural 
police (Caribineros). 
 
 
3. (SBU) Update: This 90-day goal was met.  NAS provided 
eight motorized brush cutters to Groupo Cabal Mechanizado 
(Mechanized Cavalry Group) in Ipiales (Narino Department) for 
use in opium poppy eradication operations.  Jurisdiction of 
this group includes areas of significant opium poppy 
cultivation in the southeast sector of the department.  In 
the first 90 days of CY 2004 the unit eradicated 182 hectares 
of opium poppy, compared to 152 hectares in CY 2003. 
 
USAID 
----- 
 
4. (SBU) USAID goal (abbreviated): USAID will provide expert 
assistance to help the GOC design a comprehensive 
Demobilization and Reintegration (DR) program for illegal 
armed groups that enter into a peace agreement with the 
government. 
 
5. (SBU) Update: This 90-day goal was met.  Assistance 
provided through USAID permitted the GOC to design a 
comprehensive DR program for illegal armed groups and, in 
particular, members of paramilitary organizations such as the 
AUC (United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia).  The final GOC 
DR roadmap will be forwarded to Washington for interagency 
use.  Development of this program also helped the GOC improve 
its own interagency coordination, prepare for the initiation 
of the Organization of American States verification mission, 
and position itself to gain wider international support for 
the DR process.

1.  (U)SUMMARY: The MFA has notified the Embassy of its 
concern over a pending lawsuit in Federal District Court in 
California concerning the controversial bombing of the 
Colombian village of Santo Domingo in 1998 (see reftels), 
which it fears may have negative repercussions on bilateral 
relations.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) A Colombian filed the lawsuit on April 24, 2003 under 
the Alien Tort Claims Act.  It argues that two U.S. 
companies, Occidental Petroleum and Airscan Inc., share 
responsibility for the Colombian Air Force\'s bombing of the 
village of Santo Domingo, Arauca department, in December 
1998, in which 17 people were killed.  An Airscan crew in a 
small surveillance aircraft, operating on a contract with the 
Colombian Air Force funded with Occidental contributions, 
made targeting suggestions to Colombian Air Force helicopter 
crews during a military confrontation with the FARC near 
Santo Domingo.  At the time, the Airscan aircraft was 
conducting anti-guerrilla surveillance of the pipeline that 
carries oil from Occidental\'s wells in Arauca. 
 
3.  (SBU) MFA contacts told EconOff that such a legal process 
would likely require a weighing of fault.  The MFA 
specifically cited the specter of Colombian air force 
officers testifying under a U.S. subpoena as a concern.  A 
finding by a U.S. court that the GOC or military acted in bad 
faith in Colombian territory was also a concern. The Ministry 
learned that the presiding judge in the case had contacted 
the Department to inquire about the case\'s potential impact 
on bilateral relations, and the MFA transmitted its concerns 
to post via verbal and diplomatic note. 
 
4. (U) Post received verbal note VER-CEC No. 1278 of March 
12, 2004, which referred to the case and stated that \"the 
responsibility of Colombian government for the events... 
remains under investigation by the Colombian judicial system 
under the principle of territoriality.\"  Post received 
Diplomatic Note VRE-CEC No. 12785 of March 12, 2004, in 
reference to the suit. Informal Embassy translation follows: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Relations sends its sincere greetings 
to the Embassy of the United States of America and makes 
reference to verbal note VER-CEC No. 3866 of February 25, 
2004, which mentions a lawsuit filed before the District 
Court of California on April 24, 2003, against Occidental 
Petroleum Corporation and Airscan, Inc. for events which took 
place in the municipality of Santo Domingo, Arauca, Colombia, 
in December of 1998 (Case No. 03-CV-2860-WJR (JWJX)). 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Relations wishes to add that the 
Government of Colombia believes an eventual decision in the 
aforementioned case could have repercussions on its 
relationship with the United States. The Ministry of Foreign 
Relations takes this opportunity to assure the Honorable 
Embassy of the United States of America of its highest 
consideration. 
 
5. (C) Comment: The Santo Domingo case was not expeditiously 
investigated by military authorities and has been a thorn in 
bilateral relations for the past five years.  In October 
2002, Colombia\'s Office of the Inspector General 
(\"Procuraduria\") ruled that two members of an Air Force 
helicopter crew acted negligently in dropping a cluster bomb 
on the town, and suspended them without pay for 90 days.  The 
entire three-member crew was recently indicted by the Office 
of the Prosecutor General (\"Fiscalia\") on charges of 
manslaughter. 
 
6. (C) There is little question that a finding for or against 
the GOC in this case would be seen by many in Colombia as 
interference in Colombia\'s internal affairs and would 
negatively impact our bilateral relations. As noted in 
paragraph 4, the GOC is prosecuting this case, albeit 
tardily.  The ruling of a U.S. court on guilt or innocence 
could become an issue in the Colombian legal proceeding 
and/or the public\'s view of the case. 
 
7.  (C)  The Embassy relies on the Department for the 
ultimate determination of the foreign policy implications of 
the case.  We can see adverse effects relating to legal 
issues, reciprocity, extraterritoriality, as well as 
bilateral relations.  Regarding the bilateral aspects, the 
Embassy works closely with Oxy and the GOC to preserve the 
pipeline, the safety of which is an explicit Administration 
and Congressional goal.  Contractors play a large role in 
Embassy programs, Oxy\'s protection, other U.S. companies\' 
protection, and in some GOC security programs.  A ruling 
against Oxy and/or Airscan could complicate contracting, 
recruitment, and/or mission objectives.  We already have had 
several contractors killed in the context of our drug 
eradication programs, and three U.S. contractors remain 
hostages of the FARC terrorist group.  The eradication 
program never involves  contractors or U.S. personnel in a 
combat role.  But contractors are frequently part of mission 
planning, which involves coordination of Colombian military 
forces deployed to clear and temporarily hold regions 
targeted for anti-drug spraying.  An adverse ruling could 
complicate that relationship. End Comment.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN AVIATION:  THE ONLY WAY IS UP 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified-- Please Protect Accordingly 
 
1.  (U)  Summary:  2003 was a tough year for Colombian 
airlines due to a drop in passenger traffic and high 
operational and fuel costs. Avianca, the nation\'s largest 
carrier, entered Chapter 11 reorganization in New York, and 
is up for sale.  A Brazilian consortium has offered to take 
over Avianca, but Continental Airlines, working in 
partnership with Panama\'s COPA airlines, also expressed 
interest at the last minute.  Local competitor Aerorepublica 
seeks to challenge the majority position of Avianca and has 
requested new routes.  A new airline, Fenix, owned by 500 
Colombian commercial pilots, hopes to begin operation in the 
second quarter of 2004, further complicating the picture. The 
only bright spot is in air cargo, fueled by an increase of 
exports.  Meanwhile, GOC officials are slowly examining the 
possibility of an Open Skies agreement with the U.S. under a 
12-month extension of the previous aviation agreement. End 
Summary. 
 
Performance of the Passenger Aviation Sector in 2003 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2.  (U) Colombian airlines continued to battle high fuel 
prices and bankruptcy during 2003. Two of three companies in 
the Avianca-led Alianza Summa alliance foundered in 2003. 
The board of directors of ACES, a troubled junior partner 
which served Miami, Santo Domingo, Lima and Quito, liquidated 
the airline on August 20, 2003.  ACES was unable to continue 
operations due to financial difficulty.  ACES routes were 
redistributed among other companies such as Avianca, SAM, 
Aerorepublica, Aires and Intercontinental. 
 
3.  (U) Avianca filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S., narrowly 
avoiding harsher Colombian bankruptcy rules which might have 
led to its closing.  SAM, an Avianca subsidiary that saw a 
boost in passengers and gross receipts in 2003, nonetheless 
posted a US$16 million loss due to one-time pension costs. 
Aerorepublica, Colombia\'s second largest airline, is hoping 
to gain market share in passenger service.  It has acquired 
two new aircraft and is improving its customer service in 
order to challenge Avianca\'s dominance of the market. 
 
4.  (U)  Relative shares in the international passenger 
market (all destinations) remained steady in 2003, with 
Avianca decreasing slightly to 39 percent, American Airlines 
up two percent to 11 percent, Panama\'s COPA at nine percent, 
Delta at 7 percent and Continental at five percent of the 
market. International travel decreased slightly during 2003 
by two percent from 2002 levels, but year-end travel 
increased 4.5 percent December 2003 over the previous year. 
 
5.  (U)  Avianca dominated the 2003 domestic market with a 36 
percent market share, followed by Aerorepublica with 21 
percent. Domestic travel decreased from January to December 
2003 by four percent from 2002 levels.  In December 2003 
alone, domestic passenger traffic decreased by seven percent 
over December 2002.  One of the key factors in the decrease 
was the success of the Uribe Administration\'s effort to 
secure key highways from the threat of armed groups, whose 
roadblocks and kidnapping activities diminished road travel 
considerably in previous years.  The Viva Colombia Travel 
program, administered jointly by transportation and military 
authorities, organizes private vehicles into caravans and 
provides military escorts in key travel periods.  For the 
first time in many years, travelers felt intercity road 
travel was safe from illegal armed groups in 2003.  The 
success of the plan will likely continue to depress demand 
for airline seats. 
 
6.  (U)  Some 500 Colombian pilots formed Fenix Airlines and 
applied to the civil aeronautics authority for 287 weekly 
flights, 175 domestic and 122 international.  Media reports 
say the GOC intends to approve operations the in April for 
domestic flights and international frequencies to the Andean 
countries and Santo Domingo.  Civiar authorities have denied 
this, however.  After approval, Fenix will have 180 days to 
begin operating. Fenix pilots proposed an initial investment 
of US$9 million, of which US$5.5 million would come from 
shareholders and US$3.5 million would be borrowed. 
 
Cargo Companies Benefit from Export Increase 
-------------------------------------------- 
7.  (U)  International cargo rose in 2003 by 16 percent over 
2002.  Outgoing cargo increased 16 percent, while incoming 
cargo increased 14 percent for the same period.  The 
increases reflect the country\'s nine percent jump in exports 
during the year as well as the 18 percent increase in exports 
to the U.S.  Domestic cargo also rose nearly eight percent in 
2003.  Key providers include Aerosucre with 26.5 percent of 
the market and LAS with 26 percent, down by five percent 
during the year. Avianca is also an important player in cargo 
services. Civil Aviation authorities assigned 20 new routes 
to seven air cargo companies on March 24, 2004, including six 
routes to one U.S. based carrier, Florida West International 
Airways Inc. 
 
Avianca\'s Bankruptcy 
-------------------- 
 
8.  (U)  After years of troubled finances, Avianca\'s U.S. 
subsidiary filed for Chapter 11 in New York in March of 2003. 
 The company filed in the U.S. to avoid stricter Colombian 
laws which do not allow for reorganization.  To date, Avianca 
has restructured US$263 million in debt, and renegotiated 
leasing agreements, insurance rates and cut marginal routes, 
reducing operating costs by two percent and increasing 
operating revenue by 11 percent to US$585.7 million. 
Nevertheless, it reported a net loss of US$116.2 million for 
2003.  The U.S. bankruptcy court also granted Avianca a 
series of extensions to identify a buyer that could supply 
additional capital.  The new owner will also take on 
responsibility for Avianca\'s remaining US$300 million debt 
(US$43 million in domestic debt, US$143 million in foreign 
debt, and US$114 million in pension-related debt). 
 
A Buyer for Avianca? 
-------------------- 
 
9.  (U) Following months of speculation and talks with a 
series of unwilling suitors, Grupo Sinergy, a Brazilian oil 
conglomerate that operates Brazil\'s largest regional airline, 
reportedly agreed to  purchase Avianca on March 18.  Sinergy 
offered to inject US$64 million in capital in addition to an 
undisclosed sum in exchange for the 50 percent stake owned by 
Colombian conglomerate Valores Bavaria.  It would also 
purchase half of the remaining stake owned by the Colombian 
National Federation of Coffee Growers, which will retain a 25 
percent share in the airline.  Under the terms of the 
reported agreement the Coffee Federation can exercise the 
option to sell their stake to Grupo Sinergy after three 
years. The Avianca subsidiary, SAM, would be included in the 
sale. Reports of the deal failed to mention how much Sinergy 
would pay for the airline, nor how it would handle Avianca\'s 
existing financial obligations. 
 
10.  (U) Sinergy is owned by German Efromovich, a self-made 
Brazilian oil magnate who reportedly is known for negotiating 
last-minute, rock-bottom purchases of troubled companies and 
then rebuilding them.  Sinergy\'s worldwide holdings include 
Maritima Petroleo, which generates some US$300 million a year 
in oil revenues, including 6,000 barrels a day in Colombia. 
It also owns a passenger airline in Brazil, OceanAir, which 
is reportedly the fastest growing airline in Brazil.  Sinergy 
also owns interests in telecoms, power production and marine 
construction. 
 
11.  (SBU) Continental Airways/COPA remains a potential 
suitor, however. According to press reports in Colombia and 
the U.S., a possible Continental/COPA deal was mentioned at 
the March 2004 Chapter 11 hearing.  In response, a press 
release from the Brazilian group argued that it had a signed 
contract with Avianca.  Others knowledgeable about the 
Sinergy deal, however, say that Sinergy signed a non-binding 
letter of intent and that the deal was far from final.  Under 
Chapter 11, any deal, whether offered by Sinergy or 
Continental/COPA, needs to be approved by the airline\'s 
creditors and the presiding bankruptcy judge.  The judge 
extended to April 30 the current deadline for Avianca to 
reorganize and present a new partner.  The parties will meet 
again April 20 to determine if the deadline needs to be 
extended. 
 
12.  (SBU) Civil aviation authorities privately told EconOff 
they strongly prefer that Continental and COPA purchase 
Avianca. They believe Continental, the seventh largest 
carrier in the world, offers strong experience in aviation 
management as well as far greater access to international 
connections and capital. The civil aviation officials also 
said they hoped the number of hours flown by Avianca pilots 
would increase under Continental, whose pilots log 20 percent 
more flight hours per month than Avianca pilots.  Avianca\'s 
President, Juan Emilio Posada, credited Avianca\'s improved 
performance for Continental/COPA\'s renewed interest. 
 
Labor issues 
------------ 
 
13.  (U) Aviation labor disputes have continued to mark the 
Colombian industry.  In 2002, 84 Avianca pilots accepted a 
company offer to take early retirement, increasing Avianca\'s 
immediate pension obligations by 29 percent.  The Colombian 
Association of Civil Pilots (ADCAC) maintains, however, that 
Avianca has not complied with the agreement and failed to 
fund the pension obligations.  A planned Easter week work 
slowdown by pilots to protest the issue was canceled by the 
union March 31 to await the outcome of the bankruptcy 
hearings. 
 
Open Skies Up In the Air 
------------------------ 
 
14.  (U) Post broached the offer of an Open Skies agreement 
with GOC Civil Aviation authorities in late 2003 as the 
existing bilateral air agreement was due to expire December 
31.  At that time, the authorities told EconOff that the 
fragile financial state of Colombian aviation would not 
permit national firms such as Avianca to face more 
competition.  The GOC then agreed to a year\'s extension of 
the existing agreement.  Civil Aviation contacts now indicate 
they plan to initiate internal discussions on Open Skies 
during 2004, but do not believe that they would be ready to 
conclude an agreement this year.

SUBJECT: COOPERATION WITH CANADIAN EMBASSY IN BOGOTA ON VISA 
PROCESSING 
 
REF: 03 SECSTATE 344544 
 
1.  (U)  Summary:  Reftel recommended that posts share 
information with Canadian colleagues regarding visa 
processing, and offered a \"template\" for cooperation.  The 
Consular Section in Bogota has long enjoyed a close 
relationship with the Canadian Embassy in Colombia.  Using 
the ideas provided in reftel, post will work to deepen ties 
further.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  Reftel recommended that post schedule regular 
meetings with the Canadians and counterparts from other 
appropriate countries to discuss and analyze developments 
and trends, including fraud trends.  In 2003, post organized 
a formal \"Anti-Fraud Working Group,\" composed of 
representatives of 22 foreign embassies in Bogota.  The 
Group meets monthly to share information regarding fraud 
trends, such as categories of applicants where fraud seems 
to be on the rise.  It is a valuable forum for \"talking 
shop,\" such as learning the factors European countries give 
the most weight to in interviews, or how Central American 
consular officials view applicants who have either received 
or been denied for a U.S. visa.  When George Suhr, acting 
officer in charge of the DHS office in Panama, visited 
Bogota, post arranged for him to address the Group. 
 
3.  (U)  Post supplements the formal activities of the Group 
with an informal monthly consular luncheon among a subset of 
the Group\'s members.  These usually include representatives 
of Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, Austria, 
Italy, Spain, Mexico and Japan.  The luncheons provide a 
less structured opportunity to swap visa information. 
 
4.  (SBU)  These multilateral efforts complement nearly 
daily contact between the Canadian Embassy and post\'s Fraud 
Prevention Unit (\"FPU\").  Post provides the Canadians with 
the names of persons removed from the United States or 
\"turned around\" at the border.  We also occasionally perform 
namechecks on applicants to the Canadian refugee program. 
The Canadians send to the Deputy Fraud Chief the names of 
applicants for refuge whose applications are likely to be 
denied.  These include a number of persons who identify 
themselves as members of terrorist organizations (i.e., the 
FARC, the ELN, or paramilitaries).  Post then reviews those 
persons in its VISAS VIPER committee.  Less dramatically, 
about 90 percent of the refugee applicants rejected by the 
Canadians have valid U.S. visas.  Seeking refugee status 
brings into question the person\'s continuing ability to 
overcome INA Section 214(b).  Consequently, post examines 
whether those person\'s visas should be revoked.  In 
addition, U.S. and Canadian officials regularly consult one 
another by telephone to verify visas or stamps in the 
passports of applicants. 
 
5.  (U)  Reftel suggested that posts \"conduct reciprocal 
tours of visa operations for all newly assigned officers.\" 
Canadian consular officials (together with officials from 
the British Embassy) toured post\'s Consular Section on 
February 20, 2004.  Officials from the Mexican Embassy 
toured the Section on February 27.  Consular colleagues from 
other missions also visited the Section in 2003. 
 
6.  (U)  Reftel also suggested that posts conduct 
appropriate joint training exercises and joint interdiction 
operations.  Post will seek opportunities to implement these 
suggestions.

DEATHS 
 
 
Classified By: Amb. William B. Wood Reasons 1.4 (b&d) 
 
 1. (U) On the night of April 10 in the municipality of 
Cajamarca, Tolima department, soldiers from the Pijoas 
Battalion of the Colombian Army\'s Sixth Brigade killed five 
civilians -- including a 6-month-old infant -- who soldiers 
mistook in the dark for FARC guerrillas.  Cajamarca is an 
area with high levels of guerrilla activity, and at the time 
of the shooting the Army was engaged in an operation against 
the FARC\'s 21st and 50th Fronts, which operate in the region. 
 According to the military, the civilians, who were spotted 
on a rural highway, refused soldiers\' orders to halt and were 
shot after they began to run. 
2. (U) On April 11, Army Commander General Martin Orlando 
Carreno and Fifth Division Commander Brigadier General Hernan 
Alonso Ortiz arrived at the scene, as did prosecutors and 
criminal investigators from the Prosecutor General\'s Office 
(\"Fiscalia\") and local representatives of the Office of the 
Human Rights Ombudsman (\"Defensoria\").  The military justice 
system also has begun an investigation of the incident.  That 
same day, Armed Forces Commander General Carlos Alberto 
Ospina publicly acknowledged military responsibility for the 
deaths and offered condolences to the victims\' family. 
 
3. (C) Comment: The Army\'s quick acknowledgement of 
responsibility for this tragedy stands in sharp contrast to 
the Air Force\'s obfuscation and procrastination in the 
aftermath of the 1998 bombing of the village of Santo 
Domingo, Arauca department, an incident that remains a 
painful human rights thorn in the GOC\'s side.  So far, the 
military\'s reaction to this case is reminiscent of its 
response to the August 2000 Pueblo Rico massacre, in which 
soldiers accidentally shot six children during combat with 
National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas in Antioquia 
department.  The Army\'s transparency in that case is the 
primary reason the tragedy is now almost forgotten, and the 
military appears -- wisely -- to be using its successful 
management of that case as a useful precedent.  Embassy will 
continue to follow developments in the military and civilian 
investigations of this latest incident.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NEW \"LAW OF JUSTICE AND COMPENSATION\" SUBMITTED TO 
CONGRESS 
 
REF: BOGOTA 3346 
 
 1. (U) At an April 12 meeting with the local diplomatic 
corps, High Commissioner for Peace Luis Carlos Restrepo 
provided the following detailed sequence for the operation of 
the draft &Law of Justice and Compensation,8 a new version 
of the previous &alternative sentencing\" or \"conditional 
parole\" law, which establishes the legal framework for peace 
talks with all illegal armed groups, most immediately with 
illegal self-defense forces, otherwise known as 
paramilitaries (reftel).  The law (sent to WHA/AND) should be 
debated in Congress within the next two weeks.  The 
government believes it has the votes to pass the law.  During 
the briefing to more than 80 ambassadors, Restrepo reiterated 
that extradition was not on the table in negotiations with 
the paramilitaries. 
 
2. (U) The proposed legal approach would function as follows: 
 
-------------------------- 
Preconditions for Benefits 
-------------------------- 
 
a. An illegal armed group (IAG) declares and fulfills a 
cease-fire and signs a peace agreement with the government. 
 
b. The IAG provides a list of members who are potential 
beneficiaries of the Law of Justice and Compensation 
(exclusively for crimes related to the IAG\'s activities). 
 
c. The government reviews the list and submits it to the 
Fiscalia (Prosecutor General\'s Office) for investigation and 
prosecution and to the newly constituted \"Tribunal for Truth, 
Justice, and Compensation\" for eventual judgment and 
sentencing.  The Tribunal will require each potential 
beneficiary to provide restitution to victims, pay 
compensation, and cooperate in peace-making. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
First Stage with the Fiscalia: Investigation 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
d. A special unit of prosecutors from the Fiscalia reviews 
all open investigations against each potential beneficiary. 
 
e. The unit combines all these legal proceedings into one 
case and completes the investigation. 
 
f. The investigation results in either an indictment (in 
cases that, under normal circumstance, would go to trial) or 
a plea bargain. 
 
g. The unit submits its findings to the Tribunal. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
First Stage with the Tribunal: Judgment and Sentencing 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
h. The Tribunal canvasses judges throughout the country for 
pending charges and prior convictions against the potential 
beneficiary. 
 
i. The Tribunal combines all pending charges into one case 
and determines a single finding of responsibility for each 
potential beneficiary. 
 
j. It combines this judgment with any prior convictions and 
issues one consolidated sentence for each individual. 
 
k. The Tribunal submits an opinion to the President for each 
potential beneficiary, with a recommendation on whether or 
not an individual should benefit from an alternative sentence. 
 
------------------------- 
First Presidential Review 
------------------------- 
 
l. The President reviews the Tribunal\'s opinion. 
 
m. The President cannot overrule a recommendation against 
granting an alternative sentence. 
 
n. The President decides who will benefit among those 
recommended for an alternative sentence. 
 
o. The President returns the approved list to the Tribunal. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Second Stage with the Tribunal: Alternative Sentencing 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
p. The Tribunal issues an alternative sentence to each 
beneficiary (between five and ten years in confinement). 
 
q. The Tribunal suspends the remainder of the original 
sentence. 
 
r. The Tribunal determines what reparations the beneficiary 
must make to victims. 
 
s. The Tribunal determines what peace-making activities the 
beneficiary must undertake. 
 
t. The Tribunal imposes auxiliary punishments, such as a 
suspension of the right to carry a firearm or hold elected

this would give the IAGs more than two years to continue to 
commit atrocities.  Restrepo said the GOC had considered that 
possibility and the alternatives, and in the end had decided 
that providing an ultimatum with a reasonable, but limited, 
time for the law\'s implementation was the best approach.  He 
also said that the GOC wanted to time the law so that the 
next government, which will take office in August 2006, could 
evaluate its results and seek any changes it wanted.

 ------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.(C) With USG assistance, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe 
has made great strides in fighting drug trafficking and 
terrorism.  Uribe\'s hard-nosed security polices have 
eliminated the National Liberation Army (ELN) as a military 
threat, put the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 
on the defensive, and continued to pressure the United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) and other paramilitary 
groups in the midst of an on-going peace process.  The 
security forces have captured or killed key FARC leaders, 
initiated a multi-phased, nationwide campaign to attack the 
FARC in its rural strongholds, and reestablished a presence 
in all the country\'s 1,098 municipalities.  Inter-service and 
civil-military cooperation, although imperfect, are growing. 
Colombia\'s human rights situation is still poor, but has been 
improving for the past several years.  Three U.S. citizens 
have been held hostage by the FARC for over a year now. 
Their safe recovery continues to be one of our top 
priorities.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
U.S. ASSISTANCE TO COLOMBIA 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Colombian Minister of Defense (MOD) Jorge Alberto 
Uribe has characterized U.S. assistance as key to the GOC\'s 
\"Democratic Security Policy\" and acknowledges the U.S. as 
Colombia\'s most important ally.  Assistance to Colombia is 
premised on combating the interrelated issues of drug 
trafficking and terrorism and includes training, material 
aid, and guidance to the security forces and other 
institutions.  For example, we provided guidance when the 
Uribe administration developed Colombia\'s first-ever national 
security strategy.  We enjoy a close working relationship 
with the Colombian security forces, especially with the MOD, 
Armed Forces Commander General Carlos Alberto Ospina, Navy 
Commander Admiral Mauricio Soto, Air Force Commander General 
Edgardo Lesmez, and National Police Commander General Jorge 
Daniel Castro. 
 
------------------------ 
Uribe is Showing Results 
------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) Nearly 21 months into his four-year term, Colombian 
President Alvaro Uribe has made the country safer and more 
stable economically.  Uribe\'s hard-nosed security policies 
have put the FARC on the defensive, reduced the ELN to a 
terrorist -- rather than a military -- threat, and continued 
to militarily confront illegal paramilitaries in the midst of 
an on-going peace process.  Colombian military pressure has 
cut terrorist attacks on vital infrastructure by nearly 25 
percent, is depriving illegal armed groups of important drug 
trafficking revenue (coca cultivation was down 21 percent in 
2003), and is leading to a growing number of desertions from 
all three terrorist groups.  The military has enjoyed over 75 
percent approval ratings since 2001 and Uribe himself enjoys 
nearly 80 percent approval, which is higher than any other 
Latin American leader. 
 
4. (C) In late 2003, Uribe named a new military high command 
and Defense Minister with an eye toward improving 
civil-military and inter-service cooperation and rewarding 
officers with a solid record of operational accomplishments. 
Recently, the security forces have achieved some notable 
successes: 
 
-- Plan Patriota Moving Forward: The military\'s multi-phased 
campaign to re-establish control over national territory and 
cripple the FARC has entered its second major stage (2B), an 
approximately 18 to 24 month-long phase to target 
FARC-dominated regions in southeastern Colombia.  General 
Ospina is personally involved in Phase 2B operations. 
Preparation, reconnaissance, and other important operations 
have already begun.  Nine mobile brigades, two infantry 
divisions, two riverine task forces, two Air Combat Commands 
(CACOM), and at least two brigade-equivalent special forces 
units are devoted to this offensive phase.  Progress is slow, 
however, given the vastness of guerrilla-controlled 
territory, the difficulty of the terrain, and the shortage of 
air and water transport, plus the conservative fighting 
tradition of the Colombian Armed Forces.  Much of this area 
has had little or no state presence for decades.  During the 
campaign\'s first phase (2A) in 2003, the military dealt the 
FARC heavy blows in Cundinamarca department, which surrounds 
Bogota, killing many important mid-level commanders and 
destroying the FARC\'s 22nd Front and several special mobile 
columns. 
 
-- Key FARC Leaders Captured: On February 10, the Army 
captured Nayibe Rojas (alias \"Sonia\"), chief of finances and 
logistics for the FARC\'s Southern Bloc, who was wanted in 
Colombia on drug trafficking charges and is under active 
investigation by U.S. authorities.  In early January, 
Ecuadorian law enforcement authorities, in collaboration with 
Colombian counterparts, arrested senior FARC commander 
Ricardo Palmera (alias \"Simon Trinidad\") in Quito.  Palmera 
and Rojas are the two most senior FARC leaders ever to be 
captured.  Other important operations have been launched 
against top FARC commanders, including Jorge Briceno (alias 
\"Mono Jojoy\") and Tomas Medina (alias \"Negro Acacio\") -- in 
the largest airborne operations ever conducted by the 
Colombian military.  Although these operations missed their 
targets, they served as confidence builders for units using 
intelligence-based plans to conduct operations deep in 
FARC-controlled territory. 
 
-- State Presence Established Nationwide: Upon taking office, 
Uribe pledged to establish a permanent security force 
presence in the 158 municipalities (equivalent to U.S. 
counties) that lacked a military or police garrison.  As of 
January 4, all 1,098 municipalities had a police presence. 
The USG facilitated this effort by training numerous police 
units and building hardened police stations.  The Uribe 
administration will need to follow up this achievement with 
social services in isolated communities. 
 
-- In late 2002, the GOC initiated negotiations to demobilize 
Colombia\'s largest illegal paramilitary organizations, 
including the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) 
and Central Bolivar Bloc (BCB).  In late 2003, over 1,000 
paramilitaries demobilized and began reinserting into 
civilian life in two mass demobilizations.  Several larger 
demobilizations are expected this year.  We have urged the 
GOC to establish clear roles for all agencies involved in the 
demobilization process, including the Ministry of Defense, 
which will be responsible for security in demobilization 
zones and areas formerly controlled by paramilitaries, as 
well as other aspects of the reinsertion process. 
Paramilitary groups have not perfectly obeyed the requisite 
cease-fire.  For this reason, the security forces have 
continued to confront paramilitaries militarily.  At least 11 
paramilitary field commanders have been captured since July. 
 
5. (C) President Uribe, the MOD, and the High Command have 
emphasized that inter-service and civil-military cooperation 
and intelligence-based operations are key to success. 
General Ospina has taken significant decisions to move the 
Colombian military towards more joint operations, and Plan 
Patriota\'s task force composition is a clear example of 
jointness.  Nevertheless, long-standing institutional 
rivalries are an on-going challenge.  Recently, two events 
further dampened Police-Military relations and highlighted 
communication problems: in March, an Army unit in Narino 
Department killed several police officers.  It remains 
unclear what actually happened, and accusations have surfaced 
that the police, military, or both may have been involved in 
illegal activities and/or tried to manipulate evidence during 
the ongoing investigation.  In February, the FARC attempted 
to commit a complex mass kidnapping in Neiva, Huila 
department, that included a diversionary attack on an 
isolated military outpost that left at least 12 soldiers 
dead.  A quick police response prevented most of the 
kidnappings, but the Army failed to respond to either the 
kidnappings or the five-hour siege of the military outpost. 
 
------------------------------------- 
GOC Generally Attuned to Human Rights 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The GOC maintains an active human rights dialogue with 
international and national NGOs, as well as the United 
Nations and foreign governments.  Human rights training is 
mandatory for all members of the military and police, and the 
Embassy vets units that receive USG assistance.  The State 
Department 2003 Human Rights Report on Colombia (published in 
March 2004) gave Colombia an overall rating of \"poor,\" but 
noted that GOC efforts to improve security had led to major 
improvements in key human rights and violence indicators. 
For example, homicides fell by 20 percent, kidnappings by 30 
percent, and forced displacements by 49 percent in 2003. 
Less than 2 percent of human rights violations are 
attributable to government security forces.  However, most 
Colombian NGOs -- which generally lean to the left -- remain 
severely critical of the GOC.  Recent missteps by the armed 
forces, such as the aforementioned police-military clash in 
Narino and an accidental killing of a family of five by the 
Army on April 10th, show there is still a need for further 
improvement in respect for human rights by the security 
forces. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
FARC Continues to Hold U.S. Citizens Hostage 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) In February 2002, a DOD plane carrying four USG 
contractors and a Colombian military representative crashed 
in FARC-controlled territory in southern Colombia.  The FARC 
killed one of the U.S. contractors and the Colombian and took 
the other three U.S. citizens hostage.  We believe they are 
being held in a remote, heavily forested region the FARC has 
long controlled and to which the Colombian military has 
little or no access.  Since the contractors were kidnapped, 
we have worked closely with the GOC to track all leads that 
could reveal their location.  President Uribe has personally 
pledged complete GOC cooperation and support in any effort to 
rescue the hostages.  As part of our efforts to secure their 
recovery, we recently initiated the Rewards for Justice 
Program, which offers up to USD five million in exchange for 
information leading to the capture of FARC commanders or 
other individuals involved in the kidnapping.

SUBJECT: UPDATE ON COLOMBIAN DRAFT LEGISLATION TOUCHING ON 
EXTRADITION 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons: 1.4 B & D. 
 
1.  (S) Summary:  The Colombian House of Representatives is 
close to a final vote on criminal procedure code reforms. 
The GOC, supported strongly by the Embassy, is pushing for 
status quo on the article that addresses extradition.  A 
sizable number of congressmen, however, continues to advocate 
new language that would add an oral evidentiary hearing to 
the extradition process.  Senior House players have assured 
us that the GOC will prevail in the House.  In addition, 
ranking senators have assured us the GOC would ultimately 
prevail in the Senate, which would be the final step in 
passage of legislation.  Nevertheless, we continue to monitor 
the situation as drug traffickers and paramilitaries are 
trying to influence both houses.  In a related development, 
38 members of Congress co-signed a legislative proposal to 
modify the Constitution to prohibit extradition of any 
individual who participates in an eventual peace process with 
the government.  As a Constitutional reform, this measure 
would face a higher vote hurdle for passage.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) The week of April 12 saw two sessions of debate in 
the House regarding reforms to the Criminal Procedure Code 
(Codigo de Procedimiento Penal).  Debate is set to resume on 
April 20.  A crucial item in the legislation is Article 518, 
which established procedures for the Supreme Court\'s role in 
the extradition process (Spanish texts faxed to WHA/AND). 
The House Constitutional Affairs Committee passed a reform 
proposal that would modify Article 518 to mandate an oral 
evidentiary hearing between the Court and the defense 
attorney of the potential extraditee.  The GOC, supported 
strongly by the Embassy, has pushed for maintaining Article 
518 intact.  Article 518 at present calls for Supreme Court 
written administrative review of the extradition request. 
The oral hearing element, according to Embassy and Colombian 
legal experts, would potentially subject the extradition 
process to questions, delays, and legal challenges.  Sabas 
Pretelt and Mario Iguaran, GOC Interior and Justice Minister 
and Vice Minister, respectively, maintained a near constant 
presence in the House during debate the week of April 13, in 
an effort to keep out damaging extradition language.  The 
Embassy also expressed U.S. opposition to legislators. 
 
3.  (C)  In a related development, on April 14, 
Representative Maria del Rocio Arias Hoyos, along with 38 
House and Senate co-sponsors (Senate membership is 102, House 
166), introduced into the House a proposal to prohibit 
extradition of any individual who \"reincorporates into 
society by way of a peace process with the government.\" (Text 
faxed to WHA/AND).  The proposal is not currently on the 
formal congressional calendar.  As a Constitutional reform, 
the Arias proposal would require four rounds of approval, two 
in each house, and in back-to-back congressional periods 
(periods are March-June and July-December).  The second round 
in both houses would require qualified majority, i.e., 
majority vote of total members (vice quorum).  President 
Uribe appears to have enough members in both houses to 
prevent its passage. 
 
4.  (C) Comment:  The criminal procedure code legislation, 
once passed by the House, would need to be passed by the 
Senate prior to becoming law.  Speaker Alonso Acosta and Vice 
President Edgar Torres have assured us privately that the GOC 
will carry the day in the House.  Senate Constitutional 
Affairs Committee Chair Luis Gomez Gallo and member Andres 
Gonzalez (former GOC Justice Minister) tell us that any 
attempt to modify extradition will not make it out of their 
committee.  Nevertheless, the congressional scene is a 
complicated one, and ongoing tensions between the Executive 
and Legislative branches may complicate the GOC\'s ability to 
hold the line on extradition.  Fortunately, the Arias 
proposal (para 3), as a Constitutional reform, faces a higher 
vote threshold in the second round. 
 
5.  (S) Comment (continued):  Embassy has information 
indicating that both drug traffickers and paramilitaries may 
be attempting to influence senators and congressman.  Embassy 
will continue to monitor the situation and lobby against any 
and all modifications to extradition rules and procedures.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) During a meeting with four participants in a 
USDOL-funded exchange program for at-risk trade unionists, we 
learned that paramilitaries had targeted at least three of 
them because of their leftist political activism, rather than 
their trade union membership.  Carlos Rodriguez, the moderate 
president of the United Workers Central (CUT), Colombia\'s 
largest and traditionally most left-of-center labor 
federation, recently confided to the Embassy that the radical 
attitudes and activities of some CUT members had stained the 
CUT as a whole and converted all of its members into 
potential targets of paramilitary violence.  Further study of 
this issue is needed to discern whether or not these case 
studies correlate to a larger trend.  However, these case 
studies do highlight the importance of considering cases of 
labor violence in context, rather than assuming that 
paramilitaries target trade unionists solely because of their 
labor activism.  End Summary. 
 
------- 
Context 
------- 
 
2. (SBU/NF) On April 2, four participants in the AFL-CIO 
Solidary Center\'s USDOL-funded exchange program for at-risk 
trade unionists visited the Embassy before their departure to 
share their first-hand experiences with violence against 
trade unions.  In 2003, the exchange program provided 
U.S.-based training and technical education to nearly 40 
Colombian trade union leaders under threat.  The four trade 
unionists we met, who are all currently enrolled in the GOC 
Ministry of Interior and Justice\'s (MOI/J) protection program 
(ref B), were:  Miguel Fernandez, United Workers Central 
(CUT) regional president for Cauca department; Luis Molina, 
CUT regional president for Boyaca department; Maria Eugenia 
Paez, secretary general of the executive board of SINTRENAL, 
a CUT-affiliated teachers union; and Nelson Quijano, regional 
human rights director for the \"Union Sindical Obrera\" (USO), 
a national oil workers union affiliated with the CUT. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Some Targeted Because of Political Positions 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Moderates within the CUT, led by CUT National 
President Carlos Rodriguez, generally eschew strictly 
political debates and instead emphasize bread-and-butter 
issues such as collective bargaining, the right to strike, 
and the importance of strengthening labor inspection 
mechanisms.  CUT leftists, however, support a 
confrontational, ideological approach to their activism that 
includes opposition to even centrist government policies only 
tangentially related to labor rights (ref A).  Fernandez, CUT 
regional president in highly conflictive Cauca department, 
told us local paramilitaries threatened him because he 
organized opposition to the October 2003 political and 
economic reform referendum, publicly criticized GOC social 
policy, advocated greater GOC social investment, and 
marshalled support for left-wing political candidates. 
Fernandez, who recognized he was threatened because of his 
political activities, stated that such activity is 
part-and-parcel of labor activism. 
 
4. (C) Paez, a high school teacher in Cucuta, Norte de 
Santander department, said paramilitaries targeted her for 
advocating leftist politics in the classroom.  Paez told us 
that although she never discussed politics with students, her 
leftist leanings are well-known and consistent with labor 
activism.  Paez\'s statements indicate she was targeted 
because of her politics, rather than for membership in a 
trade union or for labor rights advocacy.  GOC Ministry of 
Defense (MOD) statistics indicate that murders of teachers 
dropped 48 percent in 2003.  Unionized and non-unionized 
educators are still, however, threatened, attacked, and/or 
forcibly displaced by both paramilitaries and leftist 
guerrillas for allegedly disseminating propaganda in the 
classroom (ref C). 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Others Targeted for Opposing Paramilitaries 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Molina, CUT regional president for Boyaca department, 
told us his name appeared on a list of paramilitary \"military 
objectives\" because he organized resistance among small 
merchants to paramilitary extortion attempts.  Molina 
insisted that paramilitaries targeted him because of his 
union leadership, but also speculated that paramilitaries\' 
animosity toward him was probably motivated by his leftist 
ideology, his efforts to organize resistance to their 
depredations, and his opposition to their alleged use of 
emerald mines as drug labs. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Perceived Guerrilla Ties Lead to Violence 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Of the four, only USO activist Quijano appears to have 
been targeted strictly for his trade union affiliation. 
However, he also told us that USO recently organized 
activities in support of a group of peasants from Bolivar 
department who have been charged with rebellion by the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\"). 
 
7. (C/NF) CUT National President Carlos Rodriguez has 
confided to Embassy officers that some of his greatest 
challenges have been to help CUT members differentiate 
bread-and-butter labor activism from tangential political 
issues and to convince hard-core CUT leftists to abandon 
tacit -- and even active -- support for guerrilla 
organizations.  Rodriguez explained in frustration that the 
actions of some misguided CUT members had stained them all as 
radical leftists and given paramilitaries an excuse to target 
the CUT as a whole. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C/NF) While these case studies do not constitute a 
representative sample, they do highlight the importance of 
considering contextual information in any analysis of 
violence against trade unionists in Colombia.  The fact that 
97 percent of threatened Colombian trade unionists belong to 
the CUT (ref A) indicates that violence against trade 
unionists may be selective and that members of other 
Colombian trade unions are largely not targeted by 
paramilitaries.  The propensity of some within the CUT to 
correlate labor activism with political radicalism may help 
to explain why the CUT is disproportionately targeted by 
paramilitaries and why the CUT is widely distrusted by 
private sector employers.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) PRM Bureau\'s Assistant Secretary Gene Dewey visited 
Colombia March 7-10.  Most interlocutors agreed that there 
has been a significant reduction in the number of internally 
displaced persons since the Uribe Administration took office 
18 months ago.  Many cautioned, however, that this positive 
trend could be reversed if paramilitary demobilization 
negotiations break down or guerrillas launch major 
offensives.  A/S Dewey encouraged the GOC and other donors to 
consider holding a consultative donors meeting with the World 
Bank or Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to attract 
more multi-lateral assistance for social investment.  He said 
PRM would try to maintain its current level of assistance to 
Colombia and work with the GOC to develop more emergency 
employment programs.  A/S Dewey\'s meeting with PRM partner 
organizations is discussed septel.  End Summary.

Project Site Visits 
------------------- 
 
2. (U) A/S Dewey, accompanied by representatives from 
Community-Habitat-Finance (CHF), \"Minutos de Dios\" (CHF\'s 
implementing partner), the World Food Program (WFP), and the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), visited several 
sites outside the city of Cartagena, Bolivar department.  In 
La Rosera, A/S Dewey visited a school-feeding program 
organized by the WFP in a temporary, CHF-constructed school 
building.  Last year, local parents constructed two 
schoolrooms with CHF resources. 
 
3. (U) A/S Dewey visited \"Minutos de Dios,\" an NGO affiliated 
with the Roman Catholic Church, where he met with recently 
displaced persons.  None expressed any desire to return to 
their homes.  In Maria La Baja, where the CHF is funding a 
self-help construction program for 79 displaced families on 
land donated by the local Catholic priest, A/S Dewey met with 
community leaders and a representative of the mayor\'s office. 
 The internally displaced persons (IDPs) are building their 
own houses, planting gardens and trees, planning bridge 
construction, and making sanitary improvements.  The CHF 
discourages rural IDPs from fleeing to urban centers, and 
instead to tries to channel them to safe rural communities 
where they can better use their skills.  The Governor\'s 
office has already offered CHF a number of additional plots 
outside Cartagena to replicate this model IDP community. 
 
4. (U) In Turbaco, A/S Dewey visited a cooperative childcare 
facility funded by UNHCR and supported by the League of 
Displaced Women.  IDP women manage the center, where they 
care for children of IDPs who are working or receiving 
training.  After eight years of operation, the center is 
finally able to pay its caregivers and recently received a 
deed to its property.  A/S Dewey also visited Lomo de Peye, 
in the La Maria hills above Cartagena, where he saw a school 
constructed by CHF and a feeding program supported by WFP.

Dewey meets UNHCR Reps from Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5. (SBU) A/S Dewey met with UNHCR/Colombia representative 
Francisco Galindo, UNHCR/ROVEN (Regional Office/Venezuela) 
representative Virginia Trimarco, and UNHCR/Panama 
representative Gonzalo Vargas Llosa.  All three 
representatives noted the importance of USG financial and 
political support for UNHCR programs in Colombia and 
neighboring countries, but stressed the need for diplomatic 
support from the international community.  They added that 
PRM RefCoord\'s presence in the region has been key in helping 
their work. 
 
6. (SBU) Galindo noted that UNHCR began its Colombia 
operations in July 1998 with the opening of its Bogota office 
at the GOC\'s invitation.  He said its relationship with the 
GOC\'s Social Solidarity Network (\"Red de Solidaridad Social,\" 
or RSS) is very good, both in Bogota and outlying regions. 
Galindo agreed that the director of the RSS has good 
intentions, is open to ideas, and is close to President 
Uribe, but added that he lacks the necessary resources and 
cooperation from other GOC agencies to effectively address 
the needs of IDPs.  The GOC needs to find a comprehensive 
approach that balances security and humanitarian concerns. 
He highlighted that increased security has not created 
additional problems, as in other countries.  The Colombian 
military does not threaten refugees; the problem remains the 
terrorists.  Galindo also noted that although forced 
displacements have fallen, there is no guarantee that this 
trend will continue.  UNHCR made a plea that USG funds for 
UNHCR be earmarked for Colombia to make sure they reach the 
Bogota office.  For 2004, Geneva has allocated USD 5.6 
million for Colombia operations.  (UNHCR Colombia requested 
USD 7.2 million).  In 2003, the Colombia program received USD 
6.0 million. 
 
7. (SBU) Trimarco noted that Colombia\'s problems spill over 
its borders.  Displaced Colombians often cross into 
neighboring countries, settling in poor border communities or 
nearby urban centers, where they face discrimination and 
suffer from limited access to basic services.  UNHCR 
Venezuela has seen its workload increase 600 percent since 
2001.  UNHCR\'s assistance has included legal aid 
(registration and documentation), humanitarian assistance, 
information campaigns, and protection networks. 
 
8. (SBU) Vargas said there are less than 800 recognized 
refugees and 600 Colombians under temporary protection in 
Panama.  UNHCR helps this community with legal advice for 
asylum seekers, aid for refugees, temporary protection in the 
border region, and quick impact infrastructure projects. 
Panama broke off from the UNHCR/ROVEN office in April 2003 
and opened a separate office in October for six months (an 
extension agreement may be signed early next month).  Over 
the last five months, there has been a small improvement in 
the GOP\'s attitude towards UNHCR and a greater willingness to 
abide by international standards regarding Colombian 
refugees.  The GOP\'s decision to strengthen its National 
Refugee Office (ONPAR) has also been positive.  However, the 
overall situation regarding asylum in Panama remains poor, 
and Panama continues to be preoccupied by security concerns 
about Colombians crossing the border.  The GOP\'s national 
refugee legislation is also below international standards. 
Moreover, its Refugee Eligibility Commission met recently for 
the first time since 2002 and rejected seven of nine asylum 
applications.  Other challenges include improving the legal 
refugee framework and shifting emphasis from return to 
reception and stabilization at the border. 
 
----------------- 
Meeting with ICRC 
----------------- 
 
9. (SBU) A/S Dewey lunched with the ICRC\'s Chief Delegate in 
Colombia, Juan Pedro Schaerer, and his chief of protection, 
Max Frurrer.  ICRC has a significant presence in Colombia, 
with approximately 60 expatriate employees, and constitutes 
the ICRC\'s largest program of direct assistance to IDPs. 
Schaerer briefed Dewey on coordination within the Red Cross 
movement (ICRC, the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent 
Societies) and the five foreign national societies operating 
in Colombia, including the American Red Cross.  ICRC\'s 
cooperation with the UN, other humanitarian actors, and the 
GOC is excellent. 
 
10. (SBU) The ICRC provided an excellent analysis of 
Colombia\'s internal conflict.  It confirmed that mass 
displacements caused by illegal armed groups fell in 2003. 
In 2002, ICRC assisted approximately 179,000 IDPs while in 
2003 the number dropped below 120,000.  Schaerer attributes 
this drop to demobilization negotiations between the GOC and 
paramilitary groups.  He said levels of individual 
displacement appear unchanged.  Individual displacement, 
which is hard to track, is normally the result of direct 
threats to individual families, who are more reluctant to 
return home. 
 
---------------- 
Meeting with IOM 
---------------- 
 
11. (SBU) A/S Dewey met with staff from the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM), which provides logistical 
support for the P-1 Refugee Referral program as well as 
implements IDP assistance programs with USAID funding.  In 
FY03 197 individuals were accepted into the US Resettlement 
Program (USRP).  In the first six months of FY04, over 200 
individuals have been accepted.  FY04\'s goal is 500 
individuals.  A/S Dewey noted that PRM is under significant 
pressure from Congress to increase the number of refugee 
applicants, and he would like to see more coming out of the 
Americas.  The potential for expanding the USRP into 
Venezuela was discussed.  The GOV established a Refugee 
Eligibility Commission late last summer and the Commission 
recently approved its first 47 cases.  It was agreed that 
before expanding the USRP into Venezuela, the GOV\'s 
Commission must adjudicate more cases on a regular basis.  If 
this happens, the USRP program could expand into Venezuela as 
early as mid-year, pending US Embassy Caracas concurrence. 
 
12. (SBU) IOM is USAID\'s largest IDP partner implementing mid 
and long-term assistance programs.  One area in which IOM has 
had particular success is helping IDPs to their original 
communities in coordination with the GOC\'s RSS.  IOM is 
extremely cautious in determining which communities are 
viable for returnees.  All of IOM\'s five pilot projects, 
which returned hundreds of families to their communities, 
have been successful.  IOM and CHF have worked together to 
assist over 120 individuals who were repatriated from Panama 
to northwestern Colombia in the past four months, providing 
housing, sanitation, and productive projects for families 
that returned to the town of Jurado, Choco department. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Meeting with European & Japanese Ambassadors 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
13. (U) A/S Dewey met with European and Japanese ambassadors 
and charges d\'affaires at the Ambassador\'s residence.  Dutch 
Ambassador Teunis Kamper noted that the Uribe government has 
been the first to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in 
Colombia.  He raised the issue of the GOC\'s wariness of a UN 
Consolidated Appeal.  The GOC was concerned that this would 
place Colombia in the same category as the Sudan and Angola. 
Kamper said the number of IDPs run from 2-3 million, but 
reliable statistics are hard to come by.  There are, however, 
no organized refugee camps.  He agreed that mass 
displacements are diminishing, but claimed that many 
communities are prevented from fleeing by illegal armed 
groups.  The paramilitaries are responsible for the largest 
number of human rights and international humanitarian law 
violations.  Kamper stressed that President Uribe deserved 
international support, and that the London declaration was an 
excellent vehicle to increase international cooperation. 
 
14. (U) The European Community (EC) Ambassador noted European 
support in the social sector as well as in justice and 
institutional strengthening.  They work very well with USAID 
and probably are doing as much as they can for Colombia. 
Swiss Ambassador said Switzerland has made important 
humanitarian aid contributions, including a tripling of its 
support for the WFP during 2002-2004.  Clashes among illegal 
armed groups and government security forces cause most 
displacements.  The Japanese ambassador said Japan sees more 
positive trends, thanks to Uribe.  Japan is extending 
assistance through both bilateral and multilateral channels, 
including funds for libraries and USD 8 million to 
multilateral organizations.  Sweden believes humanitarian 
problems are often best dealt with by a regional approach, 
and have recently funded a study of border problems through 
UNHCR.  Unfortunately, UNHCR/Geneva is not supportive of the 
report\'s results and is withholding its publication. 
 
15. (U) A/S Dewey noted the importance of a comprehensive 
approach and the need to deal with security dimensions and 
humanitarian issues together.  He was aware of the GOC\'s 
resistance to a Consolidated Appeal, and suggested that the 
World Bank or Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) could be 
alternate mechanisms. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Meeting with the GOC\'s Social Solidarity Network, RSS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
16. (U) Luis Alfonso Hoyos, Executive Director of the RSS, 
said the Uribe Administration has three priorities: (1) 
reestablishing a state presence throughout Colombia; (2) 
reforming the government; and (3) reactivating the economy. 
The GOC has accomplished much in its first 18 months, but 
still has much unfinished business.  He cited specific 
accomplishments.  For example, two years ago there were two 
million Colombian children who could not attend school 
because there was no space for them; the GOC has created 1.5 
million new places for school children.  In 1990, only 25 
percent of the population had access to the public health 
system.  Today, there has been a 60 percent increase in 
access, although 20 million people remain outside the state\'s 
health system.  The GOC plans to add an addition 8 million 
individuals to the health system\'s roles over the next 30 
months. 
 
17. (U) After a steady increase of displaced persons 
averaging over 300,00 per year, the trend dropped by 53 
percent in 2003.  Hoyos attributed the decline to increased 
public security, both military and police.  At the beginning 
of the Uribe Administration, 158 municipalities (equivalent 
to U.S. counties) lacked a police presence.  Today, every 
municipality in the country has a police force.  The recent 
demobilization negotiations with the paramilitaries have 
reduced the number of confrontations between paramilitary and 
guerrilla forces, which was a primary cause of displacement. 
 
18. (U) Hoyos would like to see more land recovered for 
housing, improve schools and health centers, maintain a 
viable emergency response to displacement, and concentrate on 
the prevention.  The GOC is also focusing on increasing 
government presence in communities previously controlled by 
paramilitaries and guerrillas.  Education, health services, 
and employment will continue to grow as long as the economy 
remains strong.  Hoyos welcomed A/S Dewey\'s suggestion to 
establish short-term emergency employment for IDPs. 
 
19. (U) A/S Dewey congratulated Hoyos and the GOC on their 
accomplishments over the past 18 months.  He cautioned that 
one of the worse errors that donors commit when they see 
improvements in countries in crisis is that they begin to 
reduce their levels of assistance.  He hoped that PRM will 
maintain current levels of assistance to Colombia, and he 
said he will encourage other donors to do the same. 
 
20. (U) A/S Dewey\'s joint meeting with PRM partner 
organizations is discussed septel.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) As part of his March 7-10 visit to Colombia, PRM 
Bureau\'s Assistant Secretary Gene Dewey met with PRM partner 
organizations that provide short- and medium-term assistance 
to displaced persons.  Most interlocutors agreed that there 
has been a significant reduction in the number of internally 
displaced persons since the Uribe Administration took office 
18 months ago, but cautioned that this positive trend could 
be reversed if paramilitary demobilization negotiations break 
down or guerrillas launch major offensives.  PRM partners 
noted that a decrease in mass displacements has been largely 
offset by an increase in individual displacements and 
lamented a GOC reluctance to focus on long-term assistance. 
PRM partners told A/S Dewey that they were generally 
satisfied with GOC-provided security.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
PRM Partners Note Decline in Displacements 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) A/S Dewey stressed to PRM partner organizations - 
the Colombia representative of the International Committee of 
the Red Cross (ICRC), the Colombia representative of the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
Community-Habitat-Finance (CHF), UNICEF, the Pan American 
Health Organization, and the World Food Program (WFP) - the 
need to resist complacency in the face of a nearly 50 percent 
reduction in new displacements in 2003, and instead continue 
securing international support until Colombia\'s security 
situation permits the GOC to devote adequate resources to the 
IDP problem.  All concurred.  According to UNHCR, the 
reduction in displacements is the result of the paramilitary 
peace process and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia\'s (FARC) shift to a defensive posture.  UNHCR 
cautioned that the IDP situation could change rapidly should 
the peace process fail.  The ICRC also feared that 
paramilitary demobilization, unless accompanied by an 
effective state presence, could lead the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC) and National Liberation Army (ELN) 
to provoke more mass displacements.  CHF noted that conflict 
between illegal armed groups in urban areas has produced an 
increase in intra-urban displacement and a reluctance among 
IDPs to settle in urban areas traditionally occupied by 
displaced populations. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Individual Displacements Overtake Mass Displacements 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3. (SBU) According to the WFP, the decrease in mass 
displacements has been largely offset by an increase in less 
visible individual displacements.  Significant numbers of 
displaced individuals do not register with authorities upon 
their arrival in large cities (as a result, they do not 
qualify for government assistance) for fear they will be 
pressured to return to their places of origin.  The CHF 
agreed.  The ICRC noted that individually displaced persons, 
as opposed to victims of mass displacements, tend to not 
return to their point of origin out of security concerns. 
The ICRC added that GOC emphasis on returning individually 
displaced persons to their homes is counterproductive.  CHF 
added that those who return to their homes regions are not 
guaranteed access to land they previously occupied. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Need to Focus on Long-Term Assistance 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) UNHCR and others agreed that assistance should not 
be viewed as merely providing for material needs, but also as 
ensuring that IDPs enjoy the rights and government 
protections enjoyed by other Colombians.  UNHCR stated that 
the current system of assistance, with its focus on providing 
emergency aid for the first three to six months of 
displacement, leaves many IDPs at risk.  UNHCR said GOC 
agencies are not spending all the funds budgeted for 
populations in the post-emergency phases of displacement. 
The ICRC stated that GOC reluctance to focus on long-term 
assistance precluded the ICRC from doing the same.  ICRC 
speculated that greater pressure from the international 
community was needed to convince the GOC to focus on 
long-term issues. 
 
5. (SBU) UNICEF noted that the GOC\'s failure to gather 
sufficient information on displaced populations had led it to 
downplay the scope of the IDP problem and hobbled its ability 
to provide government services and protections.  The WFP 
predicted that increased individual displacement would cause 
greater financial costs in the long run, because it is harder 
to attend to the needs of dispersed individuals than a 
geographically concentrated group.  Cautioning against 
reliance on dogmatic distinctions between emergency and 
recovery assistance and noting that responses and assistance 
need to be tailored to specific situations, the WFP observed 
that PRM funding mechanisms allow for greater flexibility 
than those of other international donors. 
 
------------------------------- 
PRM Partners\' Security Concerns 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Those present said they were generally satisfied 
with GOC-provided security and noted that they generally had 
not been disturbed by illegal armed groups, although there 
had been isolated problems in conflict zones.  UNHCR and the 
ICRC noted they have been fortunate, but worry that the 
security situation might change as the FARC becomes more 
desperate.  UNICEF noted that the UN is not a military 
objective of the FARC or ELN.  UNICEF expressed concern that 
the paramilitary peace process could result in a fragmented 
command structure in which individual commanders may no 
longer feel constrained to tolerate the presence of 
international organizations in areas they control. 
 
------------------------ 
National Planning Needed 
------------------------ 
 
7. (SBU) Participants agreed that addressing the IDP problem 
must become a national priority.  UNHCR noted that the 
national response must involve local governments in 
developing local solutions.  A/S Dewey agreed with the 
group\'s assessment and pledged that the USG would remain 
fully engaged.

SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE ISSUES IN COLOMBIA 
 
REF: 04 STATE 12958 
 
1.   (C) The complex relationship between drug traffickers, 
money launderers and terrorists led the Government of 
Colombia (GOC) to take a broad, multifaceted and 
multi-institutional approach to combating illicit finance. 
Colombia has worked extensively with the USG to find, 
investigate and freeze assets of terrorists; however, post 
has identified specific areas for improvement. 
 
THE CURRENT SITUATION - GOC 
 
2.   (C) Colombia has several organizations designated as 
\"Foreign Terrorist Organizations\" under US law. However, due 
to Colombian laws, banks in Colombia cannot freeze accounts 
on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list of 
specially designated nationals and blocked persons.  Banks 
only have the authority to close accounts and return funds or 
to refuse business altogether. The Prosecutor General\'s 
Office (Fiscala) is the only entity with the authority to 
freeze accounts through judicial process.  The Fiscala has 
been helpful in working with the USG to investigate 
suspicious accounts; however, the results have been limited. 
Since 1995, only 177 people have been convicted of crimes 
involving illicit finances. In contrast to arrests, The GOC 
seized at least USD 140 million worth of narco traffickers 
and terrorist assets (money and goods) last year. 
 
THE CURRENT SITUATION ) COLOMBIAN BANKS 
 
3.   (C) Colombian banks, particularly those in Bogota, are 
helpful in closing accounts because they enjoy having a legal 
seal of approval.  Compliance is more difficult in smaller, 
rural areas or in regional banks, which may have paramilitary 
and guerrilla sympathizers within them. In those 
institutions, sympathizers or personnel under pressure from 
terrorist organizations quietly transfer funds to inactive 
accounts.  Bank personnel in these areas also encounter more 
direct threats from terrorist organizations.  This makes 
simply turning over required information to authorities a 
risk to their lives.   Efforts to retrieve information and 
close suspected accounts will be more successful as greater 
government rule is established in all areas of the country. 
 
AREAS OF CONCERN 
 
4.   (SBU) Colombia\'s steps to fight terrorist financing have 
been commendable, but more can be done.  USG representatives 
in Colombia have identified specific areas of concern: 
 
A.   (C) INTERAGENCY COMMUNICATION -- Post has a bi-weekly 
terrorism finance meeting that brings together the different 
agencies dealing with illicit financing. We are establishing 
a mechanism that will allow for information sharing and the 
storage of information in a further central embassy location. 
 To create institutional memory and a broad base of Colombian 
contacts, the Defense Attache\'s Office (DAO) has created a 
permanent, Intelligence Officer position to act as a point of 
contact between USG and Colombian agencies.  This officer 
will act not only as a facilitator between the Embassy and 
the GOC, but also between the Embassy and other governments 
working on illicit finances. 
 
B.    (C) INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMUNICATION -- The GOC has been 
helpful in working with USG agencies.  We are working to make 
a more efficient framework for intergovernmental 
investigations and analysis.  Differences between entities 
within the GOC that focus on intelligence (the military) and 
those that depend upon confiscated evidence for prosecution 
(law enforcement) limit communication. Greater communication 
between the USG and the GOC would push GOC entities to 
communicate more. In addition to greater communication, a 
greater physical presence might also be possible. The 
director of UIAF (the GOC financial crimes unit) said to 
emboffs that he would be willing to have a USG official 
detailed to his office to help with investigations.  The GOC 
is willing to provide more information if USG officials are 
willing to take a larger role.  A step in this direction 
could also lead to greater cooperation with GOC\'s 
Inter-institutional Committee to Combat Terrorist Finances, a 
group bringing together the national prosecutor\'s office, 
military intelligence and the judicial police.  Closer work 
with both UIAF and the Inter-institutional Committee would 
benefit Colombian and USG work to combat illicit finance.  A 
consistent, daily dialogue with the GOC would improve 
information sharing. 
 
C.  (C) BROADENING THE SCOPE  -- Terrorist financing is part 
of the bigger illicit financing issue in Colombia. Fighting 
terrorism in Colombia goes hand in hand with fighting drugs, 
corruption, extortion, fraud and money laundering.  Every 
aspect of the Colombian economy and society is affected by 
illicit financing.  Investigating and seizing assets of 
narco-traffickers is a crucial tool for fighting narco- 
terrorism.  No definitive line can be drawn to separate 
terrorist issues from drug issues, including in the financing 
realm. The Embassy is continuing to work on developing more 
operational intelligence.  Our regular Embassy Anti-Terrorism 
Finance Committee Meetings have improved coordination among 
agencies at post and greater information sharing. 
 
5.  (SBU) The amount of data that the GOC must analyze to 
make a case against suspected terrorists and the difficulty 
it has in collecting data in rural areas makes it 
exceptionally difficult to find, investigate, and prosecute 
terrorists.  Terrorist organizations in Colombia use 
sophisticated techniques to hide money and to intimidate 
those who refuse to cooperate with them, further complicating 
the work of finding illicit funds.  Compared to its 
neighbors, Colombia\'s system to investigate financial crimes 
is advanced.  But still is inadequate to the task it faces. 
USG involvement to date has helped the GOC achieve results, 
but more substantial involvement will show even greater gains.

SUBJECT: PERU\'S PRESIDENT TOLEDO VISITS COLOMBIA 
 
 
1.  Summary: Border security and economic cooperation topped 
the agenda when Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo made a 
two-day visit to Colombia April 15-17.  Toledo signed a 
35-point Joint Declaration with President Alvaro Uribe.  The 
Declaration called for: cooperation and coordination between 
GOC and GOP teams in FTA negotiations with the U.S.; 
increased bilateral trade; and enhanced exchange of 
information and military cooperation along the border to 
combat narco-terrorism and arms trafficking.  The Declaration 
expressed Peru\'s support for Uribe\'s Democratic Security 
Policy, and reiterated Colombia\'s support for Peru\'s 
candidacy for the UN Security Council.  End summary. 
 
2.  President Alejandro Toledo made the first Peruvian state 
visit to Colombia in a decade.  The outcome was a 35 point 
Joint Declaration (emailed to WHA/AND) that reaffirmed Peru\'s 
support of President Uribe\'s Democratic Security Policy; 
reiterated Colombia\'s support for Peru\'s candidacy as a 
non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2006-2007; 
and emphasized commerce, security, and development of the 
border area. 
 
International Financial Institutions Relations 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  The Presidents agreed to call on the IMF to give more 
attention to regional concerns regarding public investment. 
They stressed the distinction between public investment and 
current expenditures, and requested that these should be 
treated differently, in accordance with the statement adopted 
by the March meeting of the Governors of the Inter-American 
Bank, in support of economic growth and social development. 
 
Teams Will Cooperate in Negotiating FTA with U.S. 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4.  The Joint Declaration calls for cooperation between the 
two countries in negotiating FTAs with the U.S.  The GOC 
MFA\'s Coordinator for Latin America and the Caribbean 
subsequently explained this to mean information sharing. 
 
Border Security, Combating the Traffic in Drugs and Arms 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
5.  The countries will continue to share information 
regarding the traffic of arms and drugs across their border. 
The Presidents underscored the importance of the tripartite 
defense agreement between Brazil, Peru, and Colombia to 
combat crime along their riverine borders.  A joint 
Peru-Colombia commission on drugs will meet May 12-13 in 
Bogota to evaluate and develop joint methods to combat the 
traffic in drugs and chemical precursors.  The two countries 
will share information on alternative development and the 
GOC\'s program of civilian rangers to protect forests from 
illicit cultivation. 
 
An Amicable Visit 
----------------- 
 
6.  The GOC\'s coordinator for the visit noted that Toledo\'s 
formal statement of support for Uribe\'s Democratic Security 
Policy set the tone for an amicable visit.  The Joint 
Declaration made no mention of recent media reports that the 
FARC is buying armaments from Peruvian Army arsenals. 
Extradition between the two countries was not included in the 
Declaration, but an informal agreement was reached to update 
and implement existing extradition agreements.

1. (C) Summary: In a meeting with Colombian President Alvaro 
Uribe and other senior officials, Admiral Thomas Collins, 
Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, praised the Colombian 
Navy.  He noted he hopes to improve already close relations 
between the two coast guard services, including the possible

shipments originating on Colombia\'s Pacific coast, which has 
long been controlled by illegal armed groups and lacks a 
significant state presence.  President Uribe emphasized that 
both his government and the USG are under pressure to show

A Good News Story 
----------------- 
 
2. (C) On April 20, Admiral Thomas Collins, Commandant of the 
U.S. Coast Guard, met with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, 
Minister of Defense (MOD) Jorge Alberto Uribe, and Navy 
Commander Admiral Mauricio Soto.  Admiral Collins praised the 
Colombian Navy, noting that the Navy is responsible for 60 
percent of all Colombian drug seizures.  He credited Admiral 
Soto with these successes and other improvements in the Navy, 
and said he hopes to improve already excellent relations 
between our Coast Guards.  Collins noted that the Colombian 
Navy is missing air power, and said the U.S. Coast Guard is 
considering basing USCG helicopter assets close in-shore, 
including use of sniper platforms that can take out the 
engines of illegal go-fast boats.  Presently, the Colombian 
Navy has only one helicopter active on the Pacific Coast and 
is only able to use Air Force resources on a limited basis. 
Other important cooperation projects include intelligence 
sharing, especially out of the 11-country Joint Task Force in 
Key West, Florida, professional exchanges, and training 
opportunities in the U.S.  The soon-to-be-implemented 
international maritime regulation code (ISPS), signed by 108 
countries, including Colombia, will significantly increase 
port controls and be a powerful tool against shipments of 
drugs, arms, and other illegal goods. 
 
3. (C) In the vulnerable Pacific \"littoral zone,\" which has 
little or no state presence, traffickers send the largest 
drug shipments.  Soto said that the Navy already has begun to 
expand its presence in the area with three new projects: a 
Navy base in the port city of Tumaco, Narino department, 
which will open next month and be assisted by the Army\'s 
Counterdrug Brigade; a joint fusion intelligence center in 
Cali, Valle del Cauca department; and a Coast Guard station 
in the port city of Bahia Solano, Choco department, where 
there is already a Marine detachment.  Collins referred to 
this coast as the \"ATM\" of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC) and paramilitary groups because of the easy 
cash these large, hard-to-detect drug shipments bring. 
Collins assured the MOD that he would keep Eastern Pacific 
counter-drug operations a high priority. 
 
------------------------ 
Uribe Focused on Results 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) President Uribe expressed concern that unless the 
amount of drugs reaching the United States goes down and the 
price goes up, neither his government nor the U.S. will be 
able to maintain public support.  He commented that his 
administration was running out of time to show results. 
Collins and Ambassador assured Uribe that recent progress has 
clearly hurt drug traffickers and impressed the public.  Soto 
added that the Navy has already seized 12 go-fast boats and 
23 tons of cocaine this year.  Uribe agreed that close 
cooperation was key to increasing pressure on traffickers. 
Turning to the recent discovery of drugs aboard Colombia\'s 
sail training \"tall ship,\" \"La Gloria,\" in Cartagena, both 
the President and MOD noted that they are taking immediate 
action to find and prosecute those responsible.  Collins 
agreed that the event was unfortunate but congratulated 
Colombia on its decisive response and committment to full 
investigation.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Carlos Castano\'s fate remains unclear after an April 
16 armed confrontation between Castano\'s personnel and 
unidentified individuals in Antioquia Department.  The most 
often heard scenario is that Castano\'s brother and fellow 
paramilitary commander Vicente Castano was behind the attack 
in an attempt to remove Castano from negotiations with the 
government and prevent him from turning himself into 
authorities.  Most accounts suggest that Castano survived the 
attack but was taken by Vicente\'s men.  It is also possible, 
however, that he is dead or escaped.  The GOC views Castano\'s 
removal from the negotiations as a major setback because it 
has enabled hardline paramilitaries to take over talks.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------ 
Divergent Accounts 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) On April 16, an armed confrontation occurred between 
United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) commander Carlos 
Castano, his bodyguards, and unidentified armed individuals 
at a ranch regularly used by Castano in northern Antioquia 
Department.  At least two men were wounded, including 
Castano\'s bodyguard Jairo Vladimir Rojas, aka \"La Vaca,\" who 
is receiving medical treatment in Bogota.  Castano\'s 
whereabouts are unknown.  Castano\'s wife Kenia Gomez and baby 
survived the attack and are presently under GOC protection. 
She claims to have no knowledge of Castano\'s status. 
 
3. (C) Vice President Francisco Santos, Peace Commissioner 
Luis Carlos Restrepo, and other reports indicate that 
Castano\'s brother, AUC commander Vicente Castano was the 
intellectual author of the attack, possibly with the 
assistance of AUC military chief Salvatore Mancuso and 
\"narco-para\" Diego Murillo, aka \"Don Berna.\"  They were 
attempting to keep Castano from influencing negotiations and 
from providing evidence about their drug trafficking 
activities to authorities.  Castano, who indicated he would 
be willing to spend time in prison, turn himself in to the 
U.S., and demobilize his troops, had been increasingly 
marginalized within the AUC.  He did not attend the April 15 
talks between Restrepo and the Central Bolivar Bloc (BCB) and 
AUC.  According to Restrepo, Castano had lost his military 
power over the AUC but remained a symbolically important 
figure and a relatively cooperative negotiator. 
 
4. (C) On April 21, Mancuso and Vicente Castano denied 
responsibility for the attack to Restrepo.  They claimed 
their men were in the area in Antioquia where Castano 
regularly visited when they heard gunshots.  According to 
Mancuso and Vicente Castano, their men radioed Carlos 
Castano\'s personnel, who told them there was no problem.  The 
Mancuso/Vicente men then left the area.  Upon learning from 
the media that Castano had been attacked, Mancuso and Vicente 
sent their men back to the site where they found evidence of 
a firefight and noticed Castano\'s vehicle was gone.  Mancuso 
also has publicly denied involvement and suggested that 
Castano may have faked the attack. 
 
-------------------- 
Is He Dead or Alive? 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) VP Santos, who appears to have access to reliable 
sources, and several press accounts indicate that Castano 
survived the attack and was taken by Vicente Castano\'s 
personnel.  One of the wounded bodyguards publicly claimed he 
overheard the attackers saying that they had Castano. 
Nevertheless, it is also possible that Castano escaped and is 
under protection from sympathetic paramilitaries.  Castano 
used to exert a great deal of influence over the AUC and had 
many loyal proteges.  The other distinct possibility is, of 
course, that Castano is dead. 
 
----------------------- 
Uribe Moving Cautiously 
----------------------- 
 
6. (C) The GOC has demanded that the paramilitaries reveal 
what happened to Castano.  President Uribe and Restrepo have 
decided to base their next steps on the results of a 
soon-to-begin investigation by the Prosecutor General\'s 
Office (Fiscalia).  Mancuso and Vicente have agreed that the 
Fiscalia should conduct an investigation at the confrontation 
site and interview key witnesses.  Restrepo noted to us that 
Mancuso and Vicente claim there are witnesses available, but 
Castano\'s personnel claim all the witnesses have disappeared. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Restrepo views Castano\'s removal from negotiations as 
a major setback.  In his absence, the paramilitaries have 
hardened their negotiating position and rejected the 
possibility of spending any time in prison.  Hardliner and 
BCB policital chief Ivan Duque, aka \"Ernesto Baez\" and 
militarily strong narcotraffickers such as Murillo, BCB 
military chief Javier Montanez, aka \"Macaco\" and AUC 
Centauros Bloc Miguel Arroyave, dominate talks.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIA\'S DEBATE OVER MASS DETENTIONS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.4 (b) 
and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Some human rights NGOs oppose the GOC\'s policy of 
large-scale detentions.  The GOC, however, insists that such 
detentions are consistent with legal norms and points out 
that between 60 and 70 percent of persons arrested in such 
operations remain in custody based on judicially-sanctioned 
orders for investigative detention.  The government\'s Office 
of the Inspector General (\"Procuraduria\") has identified 
irregularities in some mass detentions, but claims it has 
successfully intervened to solve these problems without 
opposition from other GOC entities.  Partly because the GOC 
has shown that the state can effectively police itself in 
these cases, a senior ICRC official in Colombia (strictly 
protect) told the Embassy he believes the GOC\'s use of 
large-scale detentions are not arbitrary.  Several case 
studies reveal that despite the legal complexities of 
detentions, their imperfect results, and the adverse 
publicity they often generate, they are one of the most 
effective tools the GOC has to isolate and incapacitate 
paramilitary and guerrilla terrorists.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
The Debate over Mass Detentions 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The GOC\'s \"Democratic Security Policy\" and its use of 
large-scale detentions to ferret out terrorists operating 
clandestinely among the civilian population have come under 
heavy criticism from political opponents and human rights 
groups.  President Alvaro Uribe has stood by the practice, 
stating during his recent trip to Europe that large-scale 
detentions are a key component of the GOC\'s \"strategy for 
isolating terrorists, with the aim of condemning them to live 
in woodland hideouts, feeding on roots.\" 
 
3. (U) Some Colombian NGOs have linked the practice to other 
GOC security initiatives such as the hometown soldier program 
(\"soldados campesinos\") and the informants network that they 
allege improperly involve civilians in the internal armed 
conflict.  They also accuse the Government of using mass 
detentions to punish the political opposition, and claim that 
detainees subsequently face higher risks of violence for 
allegedly being terrorist -- or government -- collaborators. 
On February 18, a group of Colombian NGOs issued a report 
that claimed that 90 percent of mass detentions were 
arbitrary.  According to the Committee in Solidarity with 
Political Prisoners (CSPP), which focuses on the rights and 
treatment of persons detained for politically motivated 
crimes, particularly rebellion and subversion, 4,846 people 
accused of collaborating with guerrillas were detained in 
large-scale detentions in 2003.  The CSPP characterized 3,939 
of these detentions as \"arbitrary\" and claimed that 3,750 of 
these detainees were released for lack of evidence.  The NGO 
report also criticized the use of information received from 
confidential informants to justify the detentions. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
4. (U) GOC numbers for large-scale detentions are 
significantly lower than CSPP estimates, largely because of 
the time differences (hours vs. days for example) in how a 
\"detention\" is defined.  However, GOC numbers\' themselves 
confirm NGO claims that many persons arrested in mass 
detentions were soon released.  According to the Prosecutor 
General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\"), of 1,264 persons arrested in 
31 mass detentions, 414 have been released.  NGOs cite this 
fact as additional evidence that the detentions were 
arbitrary.  However, according to the Fiscalia, the arrests 
were the result of careful planning that targeted specific 
individuals.  The Fiscalia continues to gather evidence 
against the 850 persons arrested in these detentions who 
remain in custody, but only 53 of whom have been formally 
indicted. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Mass Detentions and the Colombian Judicial System 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5. (U) According to a 1994 Constitutional Court ruling, 
non-judicial authorities are permitted to \"materially 
apprehend a person under certain circumstances and with 
certain formalities, without first obtaining a judicial 
order.\"  The ruling states that such detentions must be based 
on reasonable evidence, warranted by exigent circumstances, 
limited in time and scope, consistent with principles of 
fairness and equality, and subject to habeas corpus.  The 
recently approved anti-terrorism statute, which has yet to 
face Constitutional Court scrutiny, permits members of the 
security forces to make provisional arrests, with or without 
prior judicial approval, in cases related to terrorism. 
 
6. (U) In Colombia, anyone detained by government authorities 
must be brought before a senior prosecutor within 36 hours of 
his or her detention.  The hearing must take place in the 
presence of the detainee\'s attorney or a court-appointed 
public defender.  The senior prosecutor is required to rule 
on the legality of the detention within an additional 36 
hours and decide whether the case merits formal 
investigation.  If an investigation is warranted, the case is 
assigned to a different prosecutor and a formal investigation 
begins.  Otherwise, the detainee is released. 
 
7. (U) Colombia\'s legal system divides judicial proceedings 
into various stages, each of which should be completed within 
a limited period of time, which varies according to the 
alleged crime and the number of persons under investigation. 
If a formal investigation is not completed within the 
prescribed time limit, a suspect must be released.  Upon 
completion of the investigative stage, in which prosecutors, 
police, the Inspector General\'s Office (\"Procuraduria\"), and 
the defense all have a say, the prosecutor assigned to the 
case decides whether it should go to trial.  Trial consists 
of two phases: 1) presentation of evidence by all parties; 
and 2) verdict and sentencing.  Both of these phases must 
also be completed within prescribed time limits. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
ICRC: GOC Complying with Human Rights Norms 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) According to Max Furrer (strictly protect), Protection 
Coordinator for the Colombia office of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), although arrests have 
occurred on a large scale, the ICRC does not consider them 
arbitrary.  According the ICRC\'s understanding of 
international humanitarian law (IHL), an arbitrary detention 
occurs when there is no arrest warrant or right to habeas 
corpus.  However, Furrer said, most persons arrested during 
these detentions had outstanding arrest warrants, while 
others were held based on evidence gathered at the scene or 
shortly thereafter.  Persons against whom credible evidence 
could not be found were released within a reasonable time. 
Furrer recognized that targeted groups operate clandestinely 
within the civilian population in areas where the government 
is trying to re-assert state control. 
 
9. (C) Furrer said government authorities in any country have 
a right to ask for a person\'s identification and even detain 
persons temporarily if they suspect they are involved in 
criminal activities.  If innocent detainees are released 
within a reasonable period of time, due process has been 
respected and detentions should not be considered arbitrary. 
 
10. (C) From Furrer\'s perspective, mistreatment of detainees 
has not increased as a result of mass detentions.  Furrer 
said that mistreatment of prisoners and detainees in Colombia 
was not systemic or gross, but rather the result of 
occasional heavy-handedness by police, soldiers, and prison 
guards.  Furrer also said the GOC does not carry out 
large-scale detentions to target organizations or individuals 
for political reasons. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Inspector General Remedying Irregularities 
------------------------------------------ 
 
11. (U) Colombian Inspector General (\"Procurador General\") 
Edgardo Maya acknowledged in a public report that the 
security forces have made mistakes during large-scale 
detentions, primarily related to an absence of arrest 
warrants and other violations of judicial guarantees.  For 
example, following Operation \"Cafe,\" conducted in October 
2003 in the towns of Anserma and Riosucio, Caldas department, 
the Inspector General\'s Office requested and obtained the 
release of 51 of 95 detainees because no arrest warrants had 
been prepared against them.  According to the Inspector 
General\'s Office, 754 of 1,957 persons detained for the 
crimes of rebellion, conspiracy, and/or narcotics trafficking 
between January 2003 and February 2004, or 38 percent of all 
detainees, were released because of procedural 
irregularities.  The Inspector General said, however, that 
his office has successfully intervened to protect citizens\' 
rights in all cases in which such irregularities have arisen, 
without opposition from other government entities. 
 
------------ 
Case Studies 
------------ 
 
12. (U) Several examples can help clarify the nature of mass 
detentions and the circumstances under which they occur. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Cartagena del Chaira, Caqueta Department 
------------------------------------------ 
 
13. (U) On September 6, 2003, soldiers and police surrounded 
the town of Cartagena del Chaira, Caqueta department, and 
\"rounded up\" nearly 600 people.  Residents complained that 
the operation was indiscriminate and that police arrived with 
incomplete search and arrest warrants that they filled in 
during the day based on evidence from unidentified 
confidential informants.  However, according to the Fiscalia, 
 
SIPDIS 
prosecutors had 95 completed arrest warrants, 74 of which 
were successfully executed against alleged members of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  Edelberto 
Diaz, former director of the Department of Administrative 
Security (DAS) in Caqueta department and current assistant 
director of investigations in Bogota defended the detentions, 
emphasizing that all detainees were formally processed at the 
prosecutors\' office and all those ultimately arrested had 
outstanding warrants.  He said the town\'s residents were 
temporarily detained both for security reasons and to verify 
their identities. 
 
14. (U)  On September 29, the Fiscalia issued investigative 
detention orders (\"medidas de aseguramiento\") against 67 
detainees for the crime of rebellion and released seven 
others.  On December 23, the Fiscalia issued investigative 
detention orders against 12 other town residents with 
outstanding arrest warrants who were not detained during the 
September 6 operation.  Outstanding arrest warrants against 
another nine suspects not found that day were rescinded.  On 
January 11, twelve detainees were released based on 
exculpatory evidence.  As of March 15, the rest of the 
original detainees remained in the custody of the Fiscalia. 
 
--------------------------- 
Saravena, Arauca Department 
--------------------------- 
 
15. (U) On November 12, 2002, GOC authorities, including 
representatives of the local human rights unit of the 
Fiscalia and members of the Colombian National Police (CNP), 
Colombian Army Special Forces, and the Colombian Army\'s Third 
Mobile Brigade, detained 85 persons in a series of 
coordinated raids in the town of Saravena, Arauca department. 
 Detainees were temporarily held in a soccer stadium while 
authorities confirmed their identities.  The Fiscalia says 
detainees were held in the stadium because officials could 
not process them safely on city streets.  Saravena, one of 
Colombia\'s most violent cities, is home to many FARC and 
National Liberation Army (ELN) sympathizers and clandestine 
operatives.  Civilian prosecutors throughout Arauca, 
including Saravena, live and work on military bases for their 
own protection and do not leave them without protective 
details.  Ten detainees were confirmed to have outstanding 
arrest warrants for alleged membership in the FARC\'s 10th 
Front and 33 others were linked to ELN urban units.  The 
following week, 43 detainees were transferred to Bogota for 
investigation by the Fiscalia\'s Anti-Terrorism Unit.  All 
other detainees were released. 
 
16. (U) Prosecutors indicted 37 detainees, but because all 
were charged with rebellion -- a crime normally heard in a 
lower court (cases such as terrorism and narcotics 
trafficking are heard in higher courts located in department 
capitals and Bogota) -- the cases were assigned to a local 
judge in Saravena.  In November 2003, the Fiscalia convinced 
the Colombian Supreme Court to return the case to Bogota 
because the presiding judge in Saravena could face undue 
pressure from local guerrillas.  However, delays caused by 
Arauca judicial authorities forced the newly-assigned 
presiding judge in Bogota to order the release of all 37 
prisoners in early February because the prescribed time limit 
for that stage of the judicial process had elapsed.  Although 
the case continues, all the accused have disappeared and it 
is unlikely authorities will re-arrest many of these 
fugitives in the foreseeable future.  The Inspector General\'s 
Office is investigating events that led to the prisoners\' 
release. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Cucuta, Norte de Santander Department 
------------------------------------- 
 
17. (U)  From December 9-13, 2003, prosecutors from the 
Fiscalia\'s national Human Rights Unit in Bogota, supported by 
elements of the CNP and the Fiscalia\'s Corps of Technical 
Investigators (CTI), executed 30 arrest warrants against 
paramilitaries in Cucuta, Norte de Santander department, 
suspected of scores of murders and other human rights 
violations, including the May 2003 disappearance of a CTI 
investigator and the October 2003 murder of the husband of 
the Fiscalia\'s departmental director.  The Fiscalia ordered 
the investigative detention of 25 of the detainees after 
releasing five others for lack of evidence.  Seven other 
presumed paramilitaries were subsequently arrested based on 
testimony from cooperative detainees.  All 32 suspects remain 
in custody pending completion of investigations against them. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Comment: Detentions Large-Scale, but not Arbitrary 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
18. (C) The GOC\'s policy of so-called \"mass detentions,\" 
although controversial and imperfect, has captured hundreds 
of FARC, ELN and paramilitary terrorists and support 
personnel.  Although irregularities have occurred during 
large-scale judicial operations, the government, through the 
Office of the Inspector General, has worked to police itself. 
 But far too many prisoners remain in custody without 
adequate, timely resolution of their cases.  We will continue 
to urge the GOC to better target arrests on the one hand, and 
to move them more rapidly through the judicial process on the 
other.

1. (U) Begin Summary.  Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart 
visited Colombia April 12-14.  He received two awards from 
the Colombian Congress; both were presented for the 
Congressman,s efforts on behalf of Colombians in the U.S. 
Diaz-Balart met with President Uribe and senior GOC 
officials.  End Summary. 
 
--------------- 
President Uribe 
--------------- 
2. (U) Diaz-Balart noted that his constituents and those of 
President Uribe in Florida were the same.  Uribe said he 
would be hold a &town hall8 meeting (similar to weekly 
meetings held around Colombia) in Florida in the second half 
of the year.  Diaz-Balart recommended Uribe push for 
inclusion of immigration legislation in FTA negotiations.  He 
also recommended the GOC implement a consular document 
(matricula consular) similar to  Mexico.  Uribe thanked 
Diaz-Balart and the USG for Plan Colombia support. 
 
3.(C) Uribe expressed concern regarding Venezuela.  Senate 
President German Vargas lamented that the Venezuelan 
opposition is weak and divided.  Ambassador Wood stressed the 
importance of multilateral efforts to press for the 
referendum to take place.  Uribe welcomed the visit of 
President Toledo to Colombia (septel) and praised Toledo for 
facilitating excellent bilateral cooperation.   He expressed 
surprise with Toledo,s poor domestic approval, noting that 
Peru,s economic indicators were strong. 
 
-------------------- 
Meeting with the MOD 
-------------------- 
 
4.(C) Minister of Defense (MOD) Jorge Alberto Uribe told 
Diaz-Balart that over the last forty years, Colombians had 
become accustomed to violence.  Towns without police and the 
inability to safely travel highways was common.  However, 
over the last year and a half, Colombia has turned a corner, 
and USG assistance has been a vital part of this change; 
police have been installed in every municipality and mayors 
increasingly govern from their towns, rather than from a 
distance.  The previous Easter week, the highways were 
packed.  Min. Uribe thanked the USG for continued commitment 
to Colombia, and expressed hope that USG assistance would 
continue at the same level.  Min. Uribe pointed out that 
contrary to prevailing international perception, Colombia 
funds approximately 87 percent of its military programs, and 
desires to be self-sufficient. 
 
5.(C) MOD Uribe said that a priority is to build the military 
capabilities required to operate effectively in remote jungle 
and border areas.  Currently, Colombia is approximately 
twenty years behind in these capabilities.  He used the Air 
Bridge Denial (ABD) program as an example of successful 
capacity-building.  Since August, when ABD was reinstituted, 
the GOC has interdicted at least thirty planes. 
 
6.(C) To illustrate the challenge Colombia faces combating 
illegal armed groups, Min. Uribe pointed out that 
southeastern Colombia is about one and one-half times the 
size of Iraq.  Although jungle terrain limits mobility, 
public security forces continue to push into these regions, 
reclaiming historically hostile territory.  To really hold 
the terrain security forces are being stationed in the field, 
rather than in towns.  Alluding to the recent spate of 
friendly fire incidents by public security forces, Uribe 
indicated that, given the high number of operations, it is 
impossible to avoid tragic mistakes, despite best efforts. 
Uribe asserted that he is addressing this problem. 
 
7.(C) Min. Uribe said that Colombia,s biggest problem is 
narcotrafficking, which is exceptionally difficult to control 
along the Brazilian and Venezuelan borders.  Uribe said that 
the GOC,s eradication program is safeguarded with strict 
controls.  No spray operation takes place without explicit 
authorization. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Activities At the Colombian Congress 
------------------------------------ 
 
8.(U) Diaz Balart addressed both chambers of Congress on 
April 13.  He spoke of helping immigrants in the U.S., and 
assisting allied nations like Colombia preserve democracy and 
strengthen their national security.  He lauded Colombian 
legislators for upholding democracy, welcomed their role in 
the peace process, and support for Plan Colombia. 
Diaz-Balart also had an informal lunch with twelve senators 
in which Venezuela, US-Colombia FTA, and general public 
security issues were disused.  He reaffirmed that Colombia 
has made great strides in the areas of security, 
anti-terrorism, and counter-narcotics.

SUBJECT: URIBE GIVES PUBLIC ULTIMATUM TO PARAMILITARIES 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.4 (b) 
and (d). 
 
1. (C) On April 27, President Uribe issued an ultimatum to 
the country\'s illegal paramilitaries, warning that if they do 
not accept the GOC\'s conditions for peace talks -- including 
a verifiable cease-fire and a concentration of troops -- 
Government security forces will combat them until they are 
destroyed.  He made it crystal clear he will not negotiate 
his commitment to extradite criminals to the U.S.  He also 
rejected a so-called \"humanitarian accord\" with the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  The 
President\'s ultimatum, contained in an official communique 
issued by his office, reflected remarks he made at a regional 
security meeting in Casanare department.  Uribe\'s communique 
also accused some paramilitaries and narcotics traffickers of 
threatening his life.  Presidential security staff 
subsequently told us they have recently gathered intelligence 
pointing to possible paramilitary plots against his life.  We 
will seek more detailed information on new security threats 
against President Uribe. 
 
3. (C) Uribe\'s comments echo earlier ultimatums he sent the 
paramilitaries through Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos 
Restrepo.  Until now, paramilitary leaders appeared to 
believe that Restrepo\'s ultimatums were his own and that he 
was not a trustworthy intermediary with the President. 
 
4. (U) Text of official April 27 communique from the 
Presidency: 
 
-- To the well-knonw and repeated threats against the 
President from the ELN and FARC must now be added threats 
over the past few weeks from elements of the illegal 
self-defense groups and narcotraffickers. 
 
-- The Government offered a peace process to all illegal 
armed groups on condition of a cessation of hostilities. 
 
-- The peace process with the illegal self-defense groups 
cannot advance in a climate of cease-fire violations, 
vendettas, narcotrafficking, and violent confrontations among 
criminal organizations. 
 
-- If the self-defense forces want to advance in a serious 
peace process, they must demonstrate their will to peace by 
accepting a concentration zone, with clear rules and under 
the verification of the OAS.  They must move toward 
demobilization.  If this does not happen, the Government will 
continue combating them until they are eliminated. 
 
-- The Government has submitted to Congress a bill for 
\"Justice and Reparations\" which is generous in its benefits 
and rigorous in regard to the Constitution and international 
law, preventing amnesty or pardon for those responsible for 
atrocious crimes. 
 
-- Extradition should not be understood as an internal legal 
norm that generates nationalist opposition.  It is an 
international legal norm that allows another country to 
punish those who commit crimes against its nationals.  If 
extradition is prohibited, Colombia will be discredited 
internationally. 
 
-- Extradition is not negotiable.  Those who wish to avoid it 
must demonstrate to the international community their good 
faith and intent to reform. 
 
-- The Government understands the pain of those kidnapped by 
the FARC, as well as the pain of their families.  The 
Government will press on with its democratic security policy, 
one of the principal results of which was a 25 percent 
reduction in kidnappings last year and a 65 percent reduction 
so far in 2004. 
 
-- The Government will not allow the FARC, through threats, 
to impose a Humanitarian Accord with conditions that weaken 
the democratic security policy.

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) On April 27, Ambassador spoke to Minister of Defense 
Uribe and Peace Commissioner Restrepo about that day\'s 
presidential declaration on the peace process (reftel). 
 
2. (C) Minister Uribe said that the declaration had been 
composed the day before and had been reviewed before issuance 
by himself, Minister of Interior and Justice Pretelt, 
Restrepo, and the military High Command.  Although the 
President wrote most of the declaration himself, the message 
was a product of many hands.  Ambassador told Restrepo that 
the Embassy strongly supported the declaration. 
 
3. (C) Regarding the opening line on paramilitary threats 
against the President, Minister Uribe said they had good 
information that drug trafficker/paramilitary \"Don Berna\" and 
others were trying to organize an attempt on the President\'s 
life.  Paramilitary attacks on the President are a new 
phenomenon and run counter to their rhetoric of \"patriotism.\" 
 
 
4. (C) Regarding the line that \"those who wished to avoid 
extradition must demonstrate to the international community 
good faith and a purpose of amending their ways,\" Minister 
Uribe said it was not meant to open the door to evasion of 
extradition.  Rather, the declaration was clear that 
extradition was not on the negotiating table and equally 
clear that it was the \"international community\" who must be 
convinced in any case where extradition was not granted. 
Extradition would remain an open possibility in all cases 
and, at least for the time being, the subject was closed. 
 
5. (C) Minster Uribe commented that the declaration should 
serve to separate any paramilitaries interested in a genuine 
peace process from those, increasingly dominant, who are 
merely narco-terrorists trying to masquerade as political 
actors to get in on the benefits.  He shared the view that 
Carlos Castano was dead and that the paramilitary movement 
was falling increasingly into purely narco-terrorist hands. 
 
6. (C) Restrepo said that the declaration was not an 
ultimatum, in spite of the language saying \"(if the 
paramilitaries) do not comply, the government will continue 
fighting them until they are done with.\"  Restrepo said it 
was a \"clarification,\" which would help him at the 
negotiating table, remove any doubts that his tough line was 
not also that of the President, and present the 
paramilitaries with a clear choice.  He stressed the criteria 
of a real cease-fire, concentration of forces, and movement 
toward demobilization were key to progress. 
 
7. (C) The declaration coincided, by chance, with a rally in 
Cali in favor of a \"humanitarian exchange\" of prisoners of 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) for kidnap 
victims.  The evening news in Colombia focused on the 
declaration\'s statement that the FARC would not be permitted 
to impose a humanitarian exchange by threat that would weaken 
the Government\'s policy of democratic security.  A parade of 
family members of kidnap victims criticized the declaration.

2. (SBU) Colombia,s Minister of Commerce and the GOC,s lead 
FTA negotiator have approached post to request that the USG 
send as complete a delegation as possible to the upcoming FTA 
talks in Bogota, May 18-19.  Both officials stressed the 
political significance that a full U.S. delegation to the 
talks would represent for Colombian stakeholders, especially 
those skeptical of U.S. intentions to negotiate in good 
faith. 
 
3. (SBU) While post recognizes that this round is envisioned 
as having a high organizational content, a sizeable USG 
delegation, with strong representation of the agencies 
directly involved, would have important positive political 
repercussions in Colombia.  According to lead Colombian 
negotiator Amb. Hernando Jose Gomez, one of the most popular 
arguments against an FTA is that its terms are imposed by the 
US.  A US del that was missing key players would strengthen 
that view, undermining the support the agreement currently 
enjoys (polls show that 60 percent of Colombians approve of 
the agreement).  Gomez\'s arguments have been echoed in 
Embassy contact with leading private sector and Congressional 
groups in Colombia.  Both Trade Minister Botero and Vice 
Minister Ortega have also asked that the USG have a 
delegation with representatives of the relevant agencies and 
bureaus for the same reasons. 
 
4. (SBU) With the talks in Bogota, security concerns can be 
minimized.  The talks will be at a large convention center 
and hotel with excellent facilities and robust security. 
Post is able to provide transport for as large a delegation 
as the USG can field.  Post recognizes the fiscal constraints 
faced by some agencies, but we note the tone of the 
negotiations will inevitably be affected by the discussion at 
this round.  As negotiations move forward, and the shape of 
the agreement becomes clearer, those who will face troubles 
will mount a strong offensive against the agreement.  Their 
efforts will undoubtedly be helped by any negative 
impressions of the first round. 
 
5. (SBU) Post urges that all USG agencies (and Department of 
State offices/bureaus) with an interest in the FTA, including 
trade capacity building issues, make an effort to field a 
substantial presence for the May round.

1. (U) Three Irish citizens -- Niall Connolly, Martin 
McCauley, and James Monaghan -- were acquitted on charges of 
training Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 
guerrillas in the use of explosives and urban terrorist 
tactics.  The three men were, however, found guilty of 
entering the country using false documents and were sentenced 
to prison terms ranging from 26 to 44 months.  Because the 
three men have been in prison since they were originally 
detained in Bogota\'s El Dorado airport in August 2001, the 
presiding judge has reduced the sentence for each to time 
served, a fine of 17,900,000 Colombian pesos (approximately 
USD 6,900 each) and expulsion from Colombia upon payment of 
the fine.  Under Colombian law, the Office of the Prosecutor 
General (\"Fiscalia\") has the right to appeal the judge\'s 
decision.  Prosecutors have announced their intention to do 
so.  All three have been granted conditional parole pending 
the outcome of the appeal.  They are expected to be released 
from prison today.  Should the prosecutors\' attempt to appeal 
the decision fail, the three will be immediately deported 
upon payment of the assessed fine. 
 
2. (C) Prosecutors had alleged that the three were members of 
the IRA and had trained FARC guerrillas in the FARC\'s former 
\"despeje\" in 2000 and 2001.  The three denied the charges, 
stating that they had come to Colombia to observe peace talks 
then underway between the GOC and FARC.  The prosecutors\' 
case was severely weakened when two key witnesses refused to 
testify (ref B) and by the defense\'s introduction of 
videotapes and testimony from witnesses contradicting 
accounts that the three had been observed training FARC 
operatives in the \"despeje.\"  During the trial, prosecutors 
also presented evidence linking all three to the IRA.

SUBJECT: ANDEAN FTA ANALYSIS: AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN COLOMBIA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Agriculture will probably be one of 
Colombia\'s most sensitive sectors in the FTA negotiations, 
due to its historical role and the sector\'s high level of 
government intervention.  The U.S. has comparative advantage 
in the products most protected by Colombia, particularly 
wheat, corn and oilseeds.  The GOC\'s negotiating strategy for 
an FTA will most likely be to try to retain all ATPDEA 
benefits while claiming that key crops should be protected to 
underpin the fight against drugs and civil disorder.  The GOC 
will also most likely seek to offset U.S. domestic supports 
for key products through safeguard mechanisms or long 
transition times (up to 20 years). This is the first of a 
series of sector briefs developed in preparation for the 
Andean FTA.  The summaries are based on in-depth studies 
which are available from USAID Bogota.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Background 
 
2. (SBU) While ATPA and ATPDEA have brought benefits to some 
Colombian producers, an earlier market opening still haunts 
farmers.  When commercial reforms opened the market in 1990, 
Colombian agricultural exports increased from US $2.7 billion 
in 1991 to US$ 4.7 billion in 1997.  But producers blame the 
reform for the sector\'s anemic 1 percent GDP growth in recent 
years, and claim that the resulting 9 percent rural job loss 
fueled illicit drug production and violence. 
 
3. (U) Current GOC agricultural policies tend to support 
products with a strong political base.  A recent USAID and 
WB-sponsored study found that protected agricultural 
commodities, especially basic grains, would be uncompetitive 
even if world prices rose as much as 30 percent.  The study 
concluded Colombia is highly competitive in many 
nontraditional agricultural products (flowers, fresh fruits 
and vegetables, palm oil, cacao, and forestry products). 
These have stronger direct and indirect employment-generation 
effects than  basic grain products favored by current 
protections.  The current system distorts agricultural 
finance, with subsidies making protected products more 
attractive than under a market-based system. 
 
4. (U) The recent recovery of agriculture (4.5 percent growth 
in 2003) was fueled largely by non-traditional exports.  But 
protectionists dismiss this as a \"fragile\" recovery that 
could fail if traditional agricultural interests are not 
protected from domestically-supported U.S. products.  Though 
the GOC worries about rural unemployment, cheap U.S. grain 
exports would benefit Colombia\'s rural and urban consumers as 
well as dairy, poultry and swine production. 
 
A Variety of Trade Barriers 
 
5. (U) The Andean Common External Tariff applies to most 
products. It varies from 5 percent and 10 percent for inputs 
and 15 percent and 20 percent for final products.  Some 
excepted products are tariff-free to encourage growth of 
their productive chains.  Finally, a group of sensitive 
products are included in the price-band system. 
 
6. (SBU) The Price-Band System includes the 14 most protected 
Colombian products (including basic grains, soybeans and 
chicken) and 150 substitutes and derivatives.  It was 
designed to stabilize prices of agricultural imports with 
high price volatility in international markets, and to 
counter export and production subsidies. When international 
prices surpass the band ceiling, tariffs are reduced; when 
prices drop below the band floor, tariffs are raised. 
Tariffs are calculated using reference prices and not real 
transaction values, a practice similar to setting a \"minimum 
price,\" violating WTO rules.  Although the price-band has 
succeeded in stabilizing prices, it also raises the cost of 
key inputs for other products, lowering their competitiveness 
and dampening consumption through higher local prices. 
According to a USAID/WB study, it often raises the effective 
protection on some products to over 200 percent.  This system 
is not compatible with the WTO and will need to be phased out. 
 
7. (C) Voluntary Tariff-Rate Quotas (TRQs) protect six of the 
most politically-sensitive agricultural products-- white and 
yellow corn, grain sorghum, rice, soybeans and cotton.  The 
TRQs are set by historic import levels and then auctioned off 
by the Agricultural Commodities Board.  Importers offering to 
purchase the most domestic production win the right to 
purchase the imports bid at a reduced tariff rate.  Imports 
beyond the TRQ are allowed, but face the general tariff rate. 
 GOC sees TRQs as a way to decrease protection for sensitive 
agriculture sectors while preparing them for free trade.  FTA 
talks will then provide the political cover and concessions 
necessary to dismantle them. 
 
8. (SBU) Stabilization Funds provide income support for 
producers of sugar, palm oil, cocoa, beef and dairy products 
by maintaining domestic prices above world prices.  The cacao 
and cotton funds are currently not operating due to funding 
shortfalls.  The Funds are financed by a levy on domestic 
sales, with the resulting income used to subsidize exports of 
surplus production.  While the GOC and producers deny that 
these are export subsidies, these are producer-financed 
exports subsidies covered by WTO limits.  Subsidized beef 
exports are relatively small, but export subsidies for sugar, 
palm oil and dairy products are in excess of WTO limits. 
These programs should be removed. 
 
9. (SBU) Special Safeguard Measures are applied to 56 
products listed with the WTO.  Here an additional tariff is 
applied when the volume of imports increases or when the 
price of imports decreases against a set reference price. 
Special safeguard measures also apply to 85 products listed 
under the Andean Community.  Many of these safeguards are not 
being applied because of other protectionist measures in 
place such as price bands and tariff rate quotas.  The GOC 
says the measures are permitted by the WTO, but they may not 
comply with the most-favored nation principle. 
 
10. (U) Promotion Fund Quotas (PFQs) are tariffs collected on 
certain imported goods to help fund scientific research, 
development, and technological transfer projects to promote 
domestic exports.  Such levies are applied on products such 
as malt, cacao, almonds, cotton, cottonseeds, and tobacco 
among others, raising the cost of imports. 
 
11. (SBU) Discretionary Import Licensing requirements were 
removed for corn, rice and poultry with the expiration of a 
WTO waiver January 1, 2004.  However, requirements remain for 
dry beans, beef and milk powder, the latter two instituted in 
2003 in violation of WTO rules.  The FTA will need to 
eliminate these requirements and the legislative authority of 
the Ministry of Agriculture to implement such restrictions in 
the future. 
 
12. (SBU) Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) have not 
been a major problem.  U.S. beef and poultry are currently 
banned due to BSE and Avian Influenza concerns, but 
restrictions may be lifted prior to FTA negotiations. 
Salmonella requirements on poultry were previously a problem 
and could be used again to block imports.  SPS restrictions 
could increase as the FTA removes the GOC\'s discretionary 
authority to protect sensitive products through import 
licensing and high tariffs. 
 
13. (U) Technical Barriers to Trade have generally been in 
the form of restrictive registration requirements.  While 
these requirements have not been used to keep products out, 
the long and complicated process significantly delays the 
entry of new products.  Biotechnology restrictions have not 
been a problem, but stricter enforcement of biotech 
regulations related to international agreements could be a 
problem in the future. 
 
14. (C) Getting to the Table:  What the GOC Needs to Do 
 
A. Develop an export promotion strategy that eliminates 
protectionist barriers. 
 
B. Implement key policy and institutional reforms to improve 
land market access and allocation and public infrastructure 
planning to reinforce comparative advantages in highly 
labor-intensive export sectors. 
 
C. Review protection for less-competitive products that serve 
as inputs for other agricultural goods, negatively affecting 
their competitiveness. 
 
D. Develop more market-based approaches for integrating the 
agricultural and agro-business sectors into the formal 
financial system. 
 
E. Resolve the ongoing battle between the ministries of Trade 
and Agriculture fro control of agricultural trade policy. 
 
15. (C) Overall GOC Demands in Agriculture 
 
A. U.S. domestic subsidies should betaken into account in FTA 
negotiations.  GOC will leverage this issue to push the U.S. 
to examine alternative financial mechanisms (such as 
compensation or reconversion funds) and extended phase-out 
periods for protectionist mechanisms (eg. price-bands) to 
\"counter\" U.S. subsidies. 
 
B. U.S. phytosanitary standards should be negotiated or 
modified to give Colombia rapid market access to dairy, beef, 
poultry, fruit and horticultural exports.  GOC should agree 
to establish a harmonization or equivalence strategy for 
improved registration, control, inspection and certification 
procedures and intensive technical and institution-building 
assistance to achieve international standards. 
 
C. Retain current ATPDEA benefits on all agriculture 
products. 
 
16. (C) GOC Positions on Key Agricultural Products 
 
A. Basic crops (rice, sorghum, corn and cotton) should enjoy 
special consideration in the FTA.  The GOC argues these crops 
play a critical role in providing rural jobs that enhance 
social stability and keep farmers from illicit drugs and 
conflict.  While seemingly valid, this argument is false. 
Basic grains offer a minor source of employment and 
subsistence farmers most likely to switch to illegal crops 
are not grain producers. The GOC and alternative development 
donors are shifting their focus from grains to more 
financially viable crops as better substitutes for drug 
crops. The GOC will seek long-phase-in periods, technical 
assistance and crop substitution financing for dismantling of 
protection for basic grains. 
 
B. Keep out U.S. corn and soybean oil to protect Colombian 
corn and palm oil.  The GOC wants import substitution 
opportunities for Colombian corn & soybeans and will try to 
ensure a lengthy transition period for tariff reductions in 
these areas.  The GOC may be willing to eliminate export 
subsidies for palm oil more rapidly. 
 
C. Keep out high fructose corn syrup to protect high domestic 
sugar prices and provide a large sugar quota for Colombia 
(over 100,000 MT). 
 
D. Keep U.S. poultry leg quarters out of Colombia for as long 
as possible. Colombians prefer leg quarters while U.S. 
consumers prefer breast meat. 
 
E. Emphasize market access for exotic fruits and vegetables. 
 
 
F. Gain greater access for Colombian beef (including removal 
of foot-and-mouth related restrictions) and dairy products 
into the U.S. market. 
 
17. (C) Overall GOC Negotiating Strategy for Agriculture 
 
A. Plan A will be to argue that Colombian agriculture must be 
protected in order to underpin the fight against 
narcoterrorism.  Plan B will be to demand long phase-in 
periods for sensitive crops. The GOC is likely to assume a 
hard line for an extended period of time, until they sense 
that the success of the FTA is imperiled. 
 
B. Agriculture Minister Cano, a hard-line protectionist, is 
seen as reflecting President Uribe\'s policy instincts on 
agriculture, and is pitted against Trade Minister Botero on 
the FTA.  Final decisions on tough issues will be taken by 
President Uribe.

SUBJECT: ANDEAN FTA ANALYSIS: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 
IN COLOMBIA 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Milton Drucker for reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Intellectual property rights (IPR) in 
Colombia are largely governed by Andean Community decisions, 
which are interpreted by GOC law.  The latter complies with 
the WTO, though in key areas Colombian protection is weaker 
than TRIPS  protections.  Enforcement of IPR law is the 
principle problem.  Though enforcement actions have redoubled 
in the past year, prosecution is weak and judicial action, 
often by judges unfamiliar with IPR, can take years.  This 
hampers the use of civil actions by right holders.  For the 
FTA talks, GOC will be concerned with protection of genetic 
material and traditional knowledge.  They can be expected to 
ask for more time for compliance and U.S. technical 
assistance to meet IPR protection standards. This is the 
second in a series of sector briefs developed in preparation 
for the Andean FTA.  The summaries are based on in-depth 
studies which are available from USAID Bogota. END SUMMARY. 
 
Background 
 
2. (U) Protection of intellectual property continues to 
improve in Colombia. Colombia is the only Andean nation to 
have established strong data secrecy protections for both 
pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (although agrochemical 
protections were later weakened).  Colombian legislation also 
provides penalties for IP infringement.  But while the laws 
are on the books, and enforcement actions are increasing, 
prosecution remains a problem. The Uribe Administration and 
industry groups have demonstrated commitment to increase the 
level of protection, but are hampered by fiscal constraints 
and the poor performance of the judicial system.  Post has 
recommended that Colombia appear again on the Special 301 
Watch List this year. 
 
3. (U) Colombia lacks a unified IPR registration system.  The 
Superintendent of Industry and Commerce (SIC) acts as the 
Colombian patent and trademark office.  The agency suffers 
from a backlog of trademark and patent applications, but 
plans to provide electronic registration services for 
patents, industrial designs, and trademarks are expected to 
boost registrations.  The Colombian Agricultural Institute 
(ICA) is in charge of the issuance of plant variety 
protection-related and agro-chemical patents.  The Ministry 
of Social Protection is in charge of issuance of 
pharmaceutical patents, while the Ministry of Justice issues 
literary copyrights.  Each organization suffers from 
significant financial and technical resource constraints. 
The GOC recognizes that information technology (IT) capital 
investment and technology transfer stimulate economic growth, 
and is beginning to see IPR protection as a vital concern. 
 
GOC Problems in Enforcement of Existing Agreements 
 
4. (U) Despite having signed some seven international 
agreements, Colombia has yet to successfully grapple with 
rampant piracy and copyright infringement, especially in 
recorded media.  Copyright infringement cost U.S. industries 
some $123 million in 2002, according to the International 
Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA).  Music piracy is at 70 
percent and films at 75 percent. Although GOC doubled police 
raids to 2,467 in 2003, few of those caught were prosecuted, 
and the only two convictions are on appeal.  Jail time can be 
avoided under the current penal law.  Successes have been 
scored in business software piracy, now down from 78 to 51 
percent thanks to software industry efforts and the GOC\'s 
decision to use legal software despite fiscal constraints. 
Problems in the cable industry have abated with the licensing 
of illegal operators following aggressive legal action by 
industry groups and regulatory inspections. 
 
Intellectual Property Issues for Negotiation in an FTA 
 
5. (U) The Andean Common External Tariff applies rates of 15 
percent to 20 percent to imported hardware and software bound 
for domestic consumption.  These are reduced to an average of 
5 percent when treated under \"Plan Vallejo,\" which provides 
tax exemptions on imported capital goods used to produce 
export products. 
 
6. (U) Protection of Business Software and Computer Designs. 
Semiconductor layout designs are not protected under GOC law. 
 While business software is protected for 50 years, it is not 
explicitly classified as a literary work. 
 
7. (U) Data Secrecy Protection for Pharmaceuticals and 
Agrochemicals for up to five years was provided for 
pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals in March, 2003 (though 
agrochemicals have 10 years under the Chile FTA and CAFTA). 
However, the subsequent passage of laws in 2003 significantly 
weakened agrochemical protections by restricting them to 
those not previously registered in Colombia.  Moreover, while 
the GOC agrees that TRIPS requires an exclusivity period, 
politically influential companies argue TRIPs only protects 
against pharmaceuticals using data that is not publicly 
available.  A recent decision by the Andean Community 
Secretary General upheld Decree 2085 that granted the 5 year 
 
SIPDIS 
protection period for data secrets for pharmaceuticals. 
 
8.(U) Patent Protection for \"Second Use Innovations\" has been 
denied by the Andean Court of Justice (ACJ) and the SIC.  The 
pharmaceutical industry dedicates much research to 
identifying second uses of known chemical substances to meet 
medical needs.  The SIC argues that Andean decisions mention 
protection of products and procedures but not use, adding 
that \"use\" is also not covered in TRIPs.  This is contrary to 
the position on secondary use protections. The WTO has 
reached no clear consensus on second uses. 
 
9. (SBU) Biotechnology Innovations and Plant Varieties.   GOC 
argues that microorganisms as found in nature are discoveries 
rather than innovations, and thus excluded from patent 
protection, except those that are genetically modified. 
Colombia allows patents for plant varieties, but not for 
plants and animals found in nature.  U.S. firms argue that 
this severely discourages biotech research and innovation. 
 
10. (C) Access to Genetic Resources is an issue GOC the would 
like specifically addressed in an FTA.  They argue that to 
provide patent protection for innovations developed from 
genetic resources, it must be demonstrated that the resources 
were obtained legally.  TRIPs does not specifically address 
this area, and the WTO has yet to develop clear guidelines 
regarding rules of origin for genetic resources. 
 
11. (C) Patent Protection for Traditional Knowledge and 
clarification of who should be entitled to it (indigenous or 
other communities) needs greater definition.  Colombia may 
seek a \"sui-generis\" protection regime in this area. 
However, developing a transparent and objective set of rules 
on incorporating community participation in patenting 
traditional knowledge would be extremely challenging in 
practice. 
 
12. (C) Getting to the Table:  What GOC Needs to Do 
 
A. GOC needs to improve IPR enforcement and to remedy 
weaknesses in the prosecution of cases, a critical area for 
trade capacity building. Civil and penal judges rule in IPR 
violation cases, but they lack training and specialization in 
IPR issues.  Although the Prosecutor General\'s Office has 
created a Specialized Unit for IPR that has had significant 
recent successes, more training of judges and investigators 
is needed.  The GOC should consider shifting from judicial to 
administrative IPR enforcement to speed adjudication of the 
current case backlog. 
 
B. GOC is considering a penal bill to increase penalties for 
violations of copyright and pirated use of plant varieties. 
Such a law would advance the FTA. 
 
C. The National Planning Department (DNP) has suggested 
merging all GOC institutions that manage IPR issues (patents, 
industrial designs, trademarks, copyrights, etc.) into a 
single institution with full power.  Such a Colombian \"Patent 
Office\" has been promoted by industry groups and would 
represent a significant step forward as well as an important 
area for trade capacity building. 
 
D. Access to technology and information for enforcement 
purposes needs to be upgraded, and outreach on the IPR rights 
of the business community is needed. 
 
E. The DNP has suggested establishment of a Superior Council 
on Intellectual Property Rights (to include the President and 
relevant Ministries) and an IPR section in the Ministry of 
Trade that would help set policy on IP issues.  Such steps 
could facilitate preparation for effective implementation of 
an FTA. 
 
13. (C) GOC Positions on Intellectual Property Protection 
 
A. GOC wishes to liberalize trade in intellectual property as 
the best means to transfer technology. 
 
B. GOC would like to specifically address protection of 
genetic material and traditional knowledge in an FTA.  Access 
to genetic material was not addressed in the Chile FTA. 
 
C. GOC would like more technical assistance to help in 
enforcement and judicial prosecution of IPR cases. 
 
14. (C) GOC Negotiating Strategy for Intellectual Property 
Protection 
 
A. GOC will point to recent enforcement results to 
demonstrate improvement in the IPR environment.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (S) Although he cannot evade responsibility for presiding 
for thirty-three months over an institution polluted by 
corruption, Prosecutor General (\"Fiscal\") Luis Camilo Osorio 
has followed through on his promise to remove officials who 
fail polygraph exams or are otherwise suspected of 
corruption.  He has also responded quickly to specific 
Embassy information on corrupt officials.  Several former 
officials have fought back in the press.  Based on evidence 
of corruption, much of which was discovered and provided to 
Osorio by the Embassy, we lend little credence to these 
officials\' attempts to defend themselves.  Osorio must 
continue to apply strict standards of institutional rectitude 
and empower his new internal anti-corruption unit with the 
authority, resources, and independence needed to do its job. 
From the USG\'s perspective, ensuring the unit\'s integrity is 
imperative.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Osorio Removes Suspected Prosecutors 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (S) On April 12, Prosecutor General (\"Fiscal\") Luis Camilo 
Osorio announced the dismissal of Luis Fernando Torres, 
former director of the Anti-Narcotics and Maritime 
Interdiction Unit (UNAIM) at the Office of the Prosecutor 
General (\"Fiscalia\").  Torres tested \"inconclusive\" on a 
recent polygraph exam administered by FBI specialists, and 
then refused to take another.  Osorio also dismissed Alvaro 
Bayona, an UNAIM prosecutor suspected of tampering with 
evidence against reputed narcotrafficker Leonidas Vargas, 
alias \"El Viejo.\"  Bayona, who reported to Torres, is accused 
of \"losing\" five sensitive files containing key evidence 
against Vargas and his criminal organization.  Bayona claims 
he was fired because he was about to call for an 
investigation against Colonel Oscar Naranjo, director of the 
Colombian National Police\'s (CNP) Office of Judicial Police 
(DIJIN).  Bayona has not presented any evidence, and the 
Embassy has no information that would support his claim that 
Naranjo is corrupt.  Both Torres and Bayona have also 
publicly accused Osorio of removing them to stop their 
investigations of narcotraffickers.  We lend little credence 
to these allegations; Osorio\'s decision to dismiss both men 
occurred after we urged that they be removed. 
 
3. (S) On April 15, Osorio fired two more UNAIM prosecutors 
Omaira Gomez and Efren Anibal Garcia.  Gomez, who authored 
a letter published in the press criticizing the polygraph 
process (ref A), is accused of inexplicably dismissing eleven 
cases against criminal organizations.  Gomez was not included 
in the recent polygraphs because she recently passed one. 
Garcia, who failed the polygraph, is suspected of conspiring 
with Torres to help two individuals evade extradition, which 
one successfully achieved.  On April 16, the Fiscalia 
announced the dismissal of Hayde Lopez, an investigator in 
the Fiscalia\'s National Anti-Corruption Unit (not to be 
confused with the newly proposed internal anti-corruption 
unit).  These dismissals bring to at least seven the number 
of senior Fiscalia officials recently removed for corruption. 
 In addition, Osorio has removed many mid-level officials, 
such as sixteen prosecutors and investigators in Cali, Valle 
del Cauca department, who were suspected of colluding with 
paramilitaries and narcotraffickers. 
 
4. (S) On April 26, Emboffs spoke with Osorio to recommend 
that another five UNAIM prosecutors -- Jesus Albeiro Yepes, 
Carlos Ivan Mejia, Gladys Sofia Bautista, Dario Serrano, and 
Luz Marina Gutierrez -- and one assistant -- Luz Estela 
Encizo -- be dismissed.  The Embassy had credible derogatory 
information on all six.  Emboffs also asked that two 
prosecutors fired earlier by Torres -- Maria Cristina Munoz 
and Mery Estela Gorzon (strictly protect both) -- be 
reinstated.  Osorio dismissed the six suspect UNAIM officials 
and rehired Munoz and Gorzon that same evening. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Progress on the Anti-Corruption Unit 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (S) Osorio is continuing polygraphs and pushing for 
investigations of suspect officials.  Contrary to some public 
criticisms, Osorio has not relied solely on polygraph results 
in making decisions to remove prosecutors.  For example, he 
has dismissed some officials who passed the exam -- such as 
Gomez -- based on other compelling evidence of misconduct. 
In addition, Osorio has ordered the creation of an 
investigative/prosecutorial commission to look into 
allegations of corruption. 
 
6. (S) In an April 5 meeting with Osorio, the Ambassador 
emphasized that, in order for the USG to continue its 
assistance to the Fiscalia, it was imperative that members of 
the new internal anti-corruption unit be polygraphed, and 
that all officials from throughout the Fiscalia who do not 
pass the polygraph be removed from USG-assisted units and 
programs (ref B).  Osorio agreed to both these conditions. 
(The Embassy has been polygraphing Fiscalia officials in 
these programs since 2000, and Osorio has been supportive of 
the process.  However, he has not always been diligent in 
follow-up investigations.)  On April 23 Osorio spoke again 
with the Ambassador to review the actions he has already 
instituted, and those he is considering taking. 
 
------------- 
Further Steps 
------------- 
 
7. (S) The atmosphere in the press and the Fiscalia itself is 
tense.  The dismissals and new lie detector requirements are 
producing a flood of protests, accusations, and self-serving 
statements, most aimed at Osorio.  The Embassy will continue 
-- in private -- to insist that Osorio remove and prosecute 
corrupt officials, in addition to establishing an internal 
anti-corruption unit that is itself polygraphed.  Osorio 
recognizes that more needs to be done.  He approached the 
Ambassador about further polygraphs (the Embassy will 
assist).  He seems ready to continue to relieve corrupt 
officials.  End Comment.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On April 29, U/S Grossman and SOUTHCOM Commander met 
President Uribe, Minister of Defense Uribe, and the acting 
Foreign Minister.  Ambassador also attended.  U/S Grossman 
underscored continuing U.S. support for consolidation of Plan 
Colombia and for Plan Patriota.  He expressed support for 
Uribe\'s April 27 declaration on peace talks with the 
paramilitaries.  He said that the GOC human rights record 
would remain under scrutiny and needs to improve.  Grossman 
emphasized the importance of cooperation between the army and 
police and a zero tolerance policy for collusion between 
paramilitary groups and the armed forces.  Uribe asserted 
that U.S. support was crucial for his democratic security 
policy.  He noted that his April 27 communique expressed his 
position on peace talks (reftel) and pledged that any members 
of the security forces guilty of collusion with 
paramilitaries would immediately be dismissed.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) U/S Grossman made three main points: 
 
-- The USG is committed to supporting Uribe\'s security 
policies, particularly Plan Patriota, and consolidating Plan 
Colombia.  Grossman said we were consulting with the U.S. 
Congress on raising the cap on U.S. Plan Colombia personnel. 
He said that inter-service cooperation, especially between 
the police and military, is key to Plan Patriota\'s success. 
 
-- Grossman praised the President\'s April 27 statement 
denouncing paramilitary threats against him, stating that 
extradition is non-negotiable, and warning that any illegal 
armed group interested in negotiating must obey the GOC\'s 
conditions, including a cease-fire, or else be pursued 
militarily (reftel).  He inquired how Uribe viewed the impact 
of paramilitary commander Carlos Castano\'s disappearance. 
 
-- Grossman noted that the GOC\'s human rights record was 
improving and that kidnapping, violence, and internal 
displacements were decreasing.  But much more needed to be 
done.  He cautioned Uribe that the GOC and the USG would have 
to respond to reports of collusion between the armed forces 
and paramilitary groups (which must be ended forever) and of 
corruption within the Prosecutor General\'s Office (Fiscalia). 
 The GOC must be committed to discovering, investigating, 
prosecuting, and punishing the guilty parties. 
 
3. (C) Uribe responded: 
 
-- Plan Patriota\'s objectives are to capture top commanders 
of the illegal armed groups, cut off supply and trafficking 
routes, and regain territory.  Ultimately, the GOC is seeking 
to end all drug trafficking and terrorism.  Uribe noted that 
U.S. support was crucial. 
 
-- Regarding the peace process, Uribe said that he had 
clearly stated his position on negotiations with illegal 
armed groups.  He said that while negotiations were 
important, he was not willing to give up his country\'s 
dignity to pursue them.  Uribe thanked Grossman for his 
support for the statement. 
 
-- Uribe and MOD Uribe agreed that they will \"fire\" any 
members of the security forces guilty of colluding with the 
paramilitaries.  They noted, however, that some false 
accusations of collusion were politically motivated.  The 
security forces continually confront the paramilitaries. 
According to the GOC, since President Uribe took office, 
5,047 paramilitaries have been captured and 613 killed. 
Between 2002 and 2003, there has been a 33 percent increase 
in paramilitary captu

SUBJECT: INSURANCE ISSUES IN FTA NEGOTIATIONS WITH COLOMBIA 
 
REF: STATE 82588 
 
1.  Following is post\'s response to REFTEL request for 
information on Colombia\'s insurance sector in preparation for 
FTA negotiations which begin on May 17. 
 
2.  Begin Questions and Answers: 
 
Q: Has the country engaged in any treaties in which they 
grant insurance-sector preferences to another country?  If 
so, please provide details. 
 
A: Colombia is not party to any treaties granting insurance 
preferences to other countries. 
 
Q: Are there equity limits for foreign insurance companies? 
If so, are there foreign insurance companies in the market 
place with equity higher than the current restriction? 
 
A: There are no equity limits for foreign insurance companies 
in Colombia. Over 60% of insurers are foreign. 
 
Q: Are there legal limitations on the structure of foreign 
insurance companies operating in the host country (e.g. 
branch, subsidiary, joint-venture, representative office)? 
 
A: Yes, Decree 663 of 1993 prohibits transactions with 
foreign insurance firms or their representatives if they do 
not have a commercial presence in the country.  This 
limitation applies not only to life insurance, pensions, and 
health insurance, but also to insurance for transportation of 
people and merchandise.  Foreign insurance companies must 
establish commercial presence in the country through 
subsidiaries. 
 
Q: Can insurance companies engage in non-life, life and 
reinsurance activities from the same legal entity? 
 
A: No.  Insurance companies cannot engage in different 
insurance activities from the same legal entity (except for 
some complementary activities as provided by law.)  Life 
insurance companies cannot engage in any other insurance 
activity.  Likewise, reinsurance companies are only 
authorized to engage in reinsurance activities. 
 
Q: Does the host country allow universal banking via foreign 
firms? 
 
A: Foreign providers are not barred from any activity as long 
as they are established as a subsidiary with commercial 
presence.  This means they must comply with minimum capital 
requirements as local companies.  Foreign insurance companies 
are not allowed to operate as branch offices (except for 
advertising purposes).  Banks cannot engage in different 
financial activities; management for each activity must be 
separate. 
 
Q: What types of insurance services are compulsory?  Are 
foreign insurers allowed to provide compulsory insurance? 
 
A: All automobile owners must purchase third-party auto 
insurance.  Also, work-related accident insurance is 
mandatory in workmen\'s compensation plans.  Foreign insurers 
are allowed to provide compulsory insurance. 
 
Q: Is there an obligatory pension scheme?  Is there a 
voluntary pension system?  Do private firms manage voluntary 
pensions?  Is the market open to foreign participants?  If 
private firms can manage the voluntary portion of an 
employee\'s pension, is this open to foreign competition? 
 
A: A mandatory pension contribution of 13.5 percent of salary 
must be deposited either in the state pension fund (ISS) or 
in a private fund.  According to the pension reform of 2003, 
this contribution will increase one percentage point in 2004 
and two percentage points in 2005.  Moreover, the minimum 
retirement age will increase from the current 60 for men and 
55 for women (valid until 2008) to 62 for men and 58 for 
women (from 2009-2018) to finally 65 for men and 62 for women 
after 2018.  A system for voluntary pensions also exists. 
Private and public pension funds are able to manage 
contributions to voluntary pension systems.  Pension funds 
can only invest up to 10 percent of their portfolios abroad. 
The pension market (mandatory and voluntary regimes) is open 
to foreign competition. 
 
Q: Are capital controls applied to firms in the insurance 
sector? 
 
A: There are no capital controls in the insurance sector. 
 
Q: What are the established capitalization levels?  Are there 
capitalization differences for domestic and foreign firms? 
A: According to Colombian law, all insurance companies in 
Colombia (except reinsurance companies) must maintain minimum 
capitalization levels of 7.5 billion Colombian pesos (or 
approximately US$ 2.5 million.)  Reinsurance companies must 
maintain minimum capitalization levels of 23.4 billion 
Colombian pesos (or approximately US$ 8.5 million.)  There 
are no capitalization differences for domestic and foreign 
firms. 
 
Q: Are there limitations on how the minimum technical capital 
can be invested?  Can it be invested abroad? 
 
A: 100 percent of the required technical capital must be 
invested in government bonds or bonds issued by the Central 
Bank, or FOGAFIN, or any other stock or securities issued by 
private or public firms as approved by Decree 094 of 2000 and 
Decree 2779 of 2001.  It should be noted that minimum 
technical capital is defined as the difference between the 
present value of future risk (that would be paid by the 
insurance provider) and the present value of net payments (by 
the insured legal entity).  Additional statutory capital that 
is not part of the minimum technical capital has no 
limitations and can be freely invested.  A maximum of 10 
percent of a company\'s investment portfolio can be invested 
in securities issued by the same legal entity. 
 
Q: Does the state insurance control body provide public 
notice and an opportunity for public comment in the 
development of new insurance regulations? 
 
A: The Banking Superintendent acts as the state insurance 
control body.  All new insurance regulations are published on 
their website www.superbancaria.gov.co. There are no 
established procedures for prior comment on new insurance 
regulations. 
 
Q: Are there any state-controlled insurance or reinsurance 
companies in the market place and, if so, are there any 
requirements for mandatory reinsurance cessions to these 
companies? 
 
A: There are no state-controlled insurance or reinsurance 
companies, nor mandatory reinsurance cessions.  All 
reinsurance companies operating in Colombia are foreign 
reinsurance companies.  Reinsurance activity is liberal in 
Colombia.  All foreign reinsurance companies are required to 
register with the Banking Superintendent. 
 
Q: Are there any limits on the consumption abroad of 
insurance services? 
A: Consumption of insurance services abroad is strongly 
restricted in Colombia, including insurance for 
transportation services needed abroad.  The purchase of 
insurance abroad is allowed only when no similar insurance 
service is available domestically.  To purchase insurance 
services abroad, the purchaser must be authorized by the 
Banking Superintendent. 
 
Q: What types of insurance may be provided cross-border? 
 
A: Colombian legislation restricts all cross-border insurance 
activity, including insurance for transportation services as 
explained above.  Locally established insurance companies 
must provide insurance for vessels, airplanes, and 
automobiles operating domestically, even those under a 
foreign flag.  The Financial Statute prohibits transactions 
with insurance companies that are not legally registered and 
established in Colombia.  Such limitations include life and 
non-life insurance.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIA HOPES TO INCREASE EXPORTS VIA 
CAN-MERCOSUR DEAL 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:  A liberalization trade agreement between 
trading blocks Mercosur and the Community of Andean Nations 
(CAN) will go into effect July 1.  The deal gives Colombia 
increased market access to 216 million consumers in Mercosur 
countries. Key agricultural goods will receive 15 years of 
protection, while intellectual property, government 
procurement and investment were not addressed. The GOC 
succeeded in protecting sensitive sectors in the agreement, 
capitalizing on the strong desire of Brazil for a South 
American trading block. Though smaller in impact and less 
ambitious than a U.S. FTA, the negotiations have helped gird 
GOC negotiators for trade talks with the U.S. END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (U) Trading blocks Mercosur (which operates as a customs 
union) and the Community of Andean Nations (CAN) agreed to 
open trade July 1 in a deal that will increase Colombia\'s 
access to 216 million consumers in Mercosur countries. The 
agreement with Mercosur was approved April 3 following 
negotiations that began in 1996.  Tariffs on some goods will 
be dropped immediately, while key agricultural products, 
automobiles and other sensitive goods will continue under 
tariff protection for periods of between 6 and 15 years.  The 
agreement does not address intellectual property, government 
procurement or investment. 
 
3. (U) According to GOC Trade Minister Jorge Humberto Botero, 
the deal is \"highly asymmetric in favor of the Andean 
countries, especially Colombia.\"  Colombia will have 
tariff-free entry to Brazil and Argentina in 8 to 10 years, 
but Mercosur will have to wait 12 to 15 years for similar 
access to Colombia.  Colombian goods must include 50 percent 
regional content in the first seven years and 55 percent 
thereafter, while Mercosur goods require 60 percent regional 
content. 
 
4. (U) Colombian agricultural goods won continued protection 
for the next 15 years, with immediate non-tariff access 
granted for tuna, bananas, flowers and shrimp.  The 
negotiators set aside benefits for sugar and derivative 
products like chocolates, powdered drinks and alcohol until 
the signatories determined that market conditions for 
liberalization improved (i.e. not for the foreseeable future.) 
 
5.  (U) Automotive products, footwear, furniture and electric 
appliances are also granted protection over 15 years. All 
parties agreed to apply phytosanitary standards which meet 
WTO transparency and equivalence principles, and to give 
national treatment to each other\'s laboratories. The GOC sees 
the pact as an opportunity for growth in value-added export 
products like textiles, finished goods, leather products, 
soft drinks, tobacco and printed publications. 
 
6. (U) Some 1,150 categories of goods will be duty free, with 
each country making separate offers in the negotiation. 
Brazil, which has been eager to form a stronger Latin 
American trading block with which to face U.S. trade 
negotiators, offered the most generous terms. Brazil agreed 
to drop tariffs on a quarter of Colombian exports 
immediately, including pharmaceuticals, cut flowers, coal and 
tires.  Brazil offered to take up to double Colombia\'s 
current world exports of surgical equipment.  Nearly 100 
percent of Colombian exports will be tariff free by 2012, 
while Brazilians will enjoy similar access four years later. 
 
7. (U) Argentina will drop tariffs immediately on Colombian 
flowers, printing products, shrimp, asparagus and cocoa 
products, totaling nearly 12 percent of imports. 
Approximately 77 percent of Colombian exports to Argentina 
will be tariff free in 12 years. Argentina also agreed to 
open import licenses to Colombian pharmaceutical producers. 
 
8. (U) Currently, Mercosur economies enjoy a significant 
trade surplus with Colombia.  Colombian exports to Mercosur 
in 2003 amounted to US$116 million while Colombia\'s imports 
totaled US$1.1 billion. Trade ministry officials have said 
they hope exports will increase as much as tenfold over the 
long term. 
 
9. (U) Colombian business leaders spoke in favor of the pact, 
but pressed for the establishment of a national industrial 
policy to advance the development of transportation 
infrastructure and the promotion of direct foreign 
investment.  The agricultural sector was very happy with the 
very limited access Colombia gave for sensitive products. 
 
10. (U) The GOC sees the pact as a precursor to FTA 
negotiations with the U.S., which are scheduled to begin May 
18.  Botero said the successful Mercosur negotiations have 
given his negotiating team a lift of confidence as FTA 
negotiations approach.  At the same time, the omission of key 
sector agreements and the extreme length characterizing the 
liberalization periods for most sectors limit the relevance 
of the agreement for the upcoming FTA talks.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ELAB, PGOV, CO 
SUBJECT: COLOMBIA TAX REFORMS OF LIMITED BENEFIT 
 
 
 (SBU) Summary: With a total public sector revenue reaching 
30% GDP, Colombia,s ability is limited to using additional 
taxes to further reduce its external debt.  Nevertheless the 
GOC is pushing for tax reforms to streamline IMF-mandated tax 
adjustments enacted in December 2003 and to increase revenue. 
 These are in line with tax reforms proposed in President 
Uribe,s failed public referendums.  Political focus on 
re-election and reform of Colombia,s pension system and the 
federal budget will likely delay tax reform proposals.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.    (SBU) President Uribe called for an across-the board 2 
percent increase in Colombia,s Value Added Tax (VAT) on all 
consumer basket items to increase government revenue.  In a 
presentation to the National Association of Financial 
Information (ANIF), Minister of Finance Carrasquilla proposed 
a progressive tax on pensions and a revision of the current 
tax system to close loopholes and put an end to 
\"distortional8 taxes on financial transactions, inheritance, 
and certain procedural duties (\"timbre\") (A previous attempt 
to increase the value added tax in the 2002 reform was ruled 
unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court). 
 
4.    (SBU)  Although the GOC passed IMF-mandated tax reforms 
in December of 2003, Uribe says his proposals represent a 
clearer, less-distortionary way to generate additional 
revenue.  The reforms passed in December are expected to 
raise USD 710 million this year, 350 million USD less than 
the reforms in Uribe,s failed public referendum. It remains 
unclear whether the GOC will have sufficient political 
support to propose tax restructuring during 2004.  IMF 
officials have expressed confidence that the GOC will make 
the necessary near-term expenditure adjustments to make up 
the shortfall associated with the December 2003 tax package 
and meet their 2004 deficit target (2.5% of GDP).  Moreover, 
local Fund economists and Fund officials say that pension and 
federal budget reforms are far more important to Colombia,s 
long-term fiscal health than Uribe,s tax proposals. 
 
5.    (SBU)  Comment: Colombia,s recent tax reforms are a 
major step forward toward meeting IMF fixed targets, but fall 
short of long-term GOC expectations for a streamlined, 
progressive tax structure.  With the GOC focused on pension 
and budget reform, further changes to the tax system are 
likely to be postponed. End Comment.

Grossman said that the USG supports Plan Patriota, and 
praised the GOC\'s accomplishments in combating narcotics and 
terrorism.  The U/S stressed that the USG will insist on 
maintaining extradition as an effective law enforcement tool, 
and cautioned that much still needs to be done to improve the 
human rights situation.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Pressing Forward with Security Strategy 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) U/S Grossman lauded GOC success combating 
narcoterrorism, and expressed USG support for Plan Patriota 
and the consolidation of Plan Colombia.  The U/S thanked the 
GOC for assistance in the search for the American hostages, 
and said Plan Patriota could bring us even closer to locating 
them.  GOC public security forces must focus on: (1) 
improving cooperation between the military and the police; 
and (2) severing forever ties between the public security 
forces and the paramilitaries by imposing strict discipline. 
The Ambassador highlighted Vice Admiral Soto\'s response to 
the \"Gloria\" narcotics incident as an example of quick, 
forceful action. 
 
3.  (C) Santos said the GOC agreed with both recommendations. 
 Although military-police cooperation in the field has been 
good, cooperation at the national level needs improvement. 
Santos added that the paramilitaries pose a particular 
challenge, given their strong support in certain communities. 
 However, he is seeing a decline in support by sectors that 
have traditionally supported paramilitary groups; more 
importantly, military and police leaders have also noted this. 
 
4.  (C) Grossman asked about the impact of increased public 
security presence, and noted the high level of desertions by 
illegal armed groups.  Santos agreed the desertion results 
were impressive.  He does not expect the same results this 
year, however, since those remaining in the terrorist 
organizations are more likely to be hardcore members.  Santos 
expressed surprise that the FARC had not put up more of a 
fight defending territory.  Perhaps the GOC had overestimated 
the FARC\'s strength.  Alternatively, perhaps the FARC 
mistakenly expect the GOC to withdraw from FARC areas and, 
more fundamentally, are waiting out Uribe\'s term.  Santos 
said the FARC must be concerned about Uribe\'s possible 
re-election, since they lack the resources to last eight 
years of Uribe.  Capture of another key FARC leader could 
start splintering the group. 
 
5.  (C) Santos asked for an update on FARC leader \"Sonia\'s\" 
extradition.  He also requested additional U.S. support for 
the Colombian Navy (COLNAV), as river operations will be 
crucial in Plan Patriota.  The Ambassador said \"Sonia\'s\" 
extradition is proceeding.  He also noted that her capture 
would not have been possible when he arrived last August; the 
improvements in the military\'s ability to conduct small, 
specialized operations has improved dramatically.  The 
Ambassador added that U.S. assistance to COLNAV increased 
this year, and the Embassy has asked for additional funds for 
it the next two fiscal years. 
 
6.  (C) Grossman asked about the possibility of peace 
negotiations with the ELN.  Santos responded that there has 
been no progress either in the GOC or the Catholic Church 
tracks.  The ELN is weak and lacks leadership.  Moreover, its 
cumbersome decision-making process inhibits consensus.  The 
Ambassador added that some believe the ELN\'s window of 
opportunity ) when they were weak enough to want peace, but 
strong enough to be able to negotiate ) has closed. 
 
7.  (C) Santos was puzzled why the price of cocaine has not 
increased, despite the record-levels of aerial and manual 
eradication.  Grossman observed that overall coca production 
went down in the Andean region by 15 percent.  The Ambassador 
added that eradication is working: during 2002-3, 270 tons of 
cocaine was destroyed; however, we lack the knowledge of 
inventory and markets that would allow us to accurately gauge 
the impact. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
The Future of the Paramilitary Peace Process 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Grossman expressed his appreciation for President 
Uribe\'s April 27 statement on the paramilitary peace process 
(ref B).  He stressed that extradition cannot be a bargaining 
chip in negotiations and asked whether the paramilitaries 
would now be confronted on the battlefield. 
 
9.  (C) In response, Santos said: 
 
-- As Uribe has said, this is the paramilitaries\' last chance 
to escape military confrontation.  AUC leader Carlos Castano 
had a moderating influence, and his removal means hardliners 
are solely in control of the negotiating process (ref A).  If 
the paramilitaries do not want to negotiate, the military 
will need to challenge them on the battlefield.  The GOC is 
concerned that its public security forces are not capable of 
combating the guerrillas and the paramilitaries 
simultaneously.  Santos added that the paramilitaries are 
more politically savvy than the FARC and enjoy greater 
popular support than the guerrillas. 
 
-- Although extradition is off the negotiating table, there 
might be a need in the future for the GOC to offer a way out 
to those who have demonstrated their commitment to peace and 
renunciation of crime.  Grossman said that there should not 
be any hint that this might be a bargaining chip; Santos 
agreed. 
 
10.  (C) The Ambassador asked about paramilitary threats 
against the President.  Santos said there have been instances 
of joint FARC-paramilitary terrorism, and this could grow 
over the next year.  Santos thanked the USG for assistance 
with Uribe\'s protective security. 
 
------------------------------ 
Increase Focus on Human Rights 
------------------------------ 
 
11.  (C) Grossman said that the State Department\'s human 
rights certification process was much more controversial this 
year.  Critics question accountability in the Prosecutor 
General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\"), ties between paramilitaries 
and public security forces, and large-scale detentions.  The 
Ambassador noted the General Del Rio case.  The GOC must deal 
with these issues.  Grossman said that the MOD\'s recent 
statement about registering NGOs in Choco (septel) had raised 
concerns among human rights groups.  Santos assured Grossman 
that the GOC will continue working hard to improve Colombia\'s 
human rights situation. 
 
12.  (C) The Ambassador expressed concern with the level of 
corruption and paramilitary collusion within the Prosecutor 
General\'s Office, and called for the establishment of an 
effective anti-corruption unit.  Santos responded that he 
supports Prosecutor General (\"Fiscal\") Osorio\'s recent 
dismissals of corrupt officials.  He expressed confidence 
that Osorio will continue cleaning up the Prosecutor 
General\'s Office, especially with the support of his 
exceptional deputy.  He also lauded the Prosecutor General 
Office\'s Human Rights Unit, and noted concern for the safety 
of the unit\'s prosecutors due to their aggressive 
investigations.

Summary 
------- 
 
3.   (C) Summary: On April 29, Under Secretary Grossman met 
representatives of five human rights organizations to discuss 
the human rights and humanitarian situation in Colombia.  U/S 
Grossman emphasized the importance of advancing democracy and 
human rights and the USG\'s commitment to helping the GOC in 
these areas.  All five organizations agreed that democracy 
and human rights go hand in hand and expressed their concerns 
regarding military collusion with paramilitaries, impunity, 
and continued violations, by all actors, of international 
humanitarian law.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Strong Democracy Key to Success in Colombia 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) During his April 29 visit to Bogota, U/S Grossman 
told human rights representatives that the USG considers the 
advancement of human rights and democracy to be a fundamental 
aspect of its policy in Colombia.  Carlos Rodriguez of the 
CCJ said democracy can only exist in unison with the rule of 
law and a complete separation of powers in government.  He 
expressed concern about granting \"judicial\" powers to the 
Armed Forces because it could aggravate the problem of 
impunity.  U/S Grossman agreed that impunity for human rights 
violations is a problem and added that a strong judicial 
system is needed to ensure a strong democracy.  U/S Grossman 
also explained that he and General Hill were in the meeting 
together to show that improving the security situation and 
strengthening the Colombian military go hand-in-hand with 
fostering democracy and respect for human rights. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Concerns Over GOC-NGO Polarization 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) All NGO representatives agreed that relations between 
the GOC and domestic human rights groups are not ideal. 
Romero said he is concerned about the lack of diversity in 
the political arena.  Rodriguez echoed this concern, 
asserting that President Uribe had increased polarization in 
the country with speeches in September 2003 and February 2004 
in which he criticized some human rights activists as 
terrorist sympathizers.  Romero and Monsignor Henao expressed 
concerns that the Government\'s policy of large-scale 
detentions was only applied against alleged guerrilla -- 
rather than paramilitary -- sympathizers. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Violence Down, but Concerns Remain Over Paramilitaries 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6.  (C) The Restrepo Barco Foundation\'s Gomez noted 
improvements in the overall human rights and security 
situation and said that many criticisms of Government 
security policy are inconsistent and depend on ideological 
predispositions.  Monsignor Henao said it is important to 
acknowledge improvements but also look closely at remaining 
problems to determine if they affect certain groups 
disproportionately.  U/S Grossman agreed.  The organizations 
also pointed out that there continue to be ties between 
illegal paramilitaries and some elements of the security 
forces.  U/S Grossman said the GOC must break \"forever\" any 
relationship between the Armed Forces and the paramilitaries. 
 Regarding the paramilitary peace process, Diaz of the CCJ 
said negotiations must be conducted in a way that guarantees 
victims\' rights and provides adequate reparations.  She added 
that bringing real democracy to regions historically 
controlled by paramilitaries should be a priority. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
U.S. Committed to Helping Improve Human Rights Situation 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
7.  (C) U/S Grossman emphasized the USG\'s respect for 
Colombian human rights organizations and said the USG will 
continue to work with the GOC on improving the human rights 
situation.  He added that he had raised the importance of 
human rights in his earlier meetings with the President and 
Vice-President.  Success in Colombia will ultimately be 
measured not just by victories against narco-terrorism, but 
also by an increased Government commitment to human rights 
and the rule of law.  Diaz complemented the Department for 
its 2003 Human Rights Report on Colombia and for its 
decisions in support of human rights, including the 
suspension of assistance to military units with questionable 
human rights records.  U/S Grossman said he is proud of 
actions the Embassy has taken in support of human rights in 
Colombia.

SUBJECT: IMF VISIT TO COLOMBIA 
 
 
1.   (SBU) SUMMARY: Commending the Government of Colombia 
(GOC) on its impressive growth over the last year, the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that the short term 
outlook for Colombia is positive and expects the Colombian 
economy to meet revised macroeconomic targets.  The positive 
macroeconomic growth seen over the last year reflects the 
strong policies of the Uribe administration, but the work 
toward a stable, sustainable economic situation in Colombia 
is not yet finished.  Structural reforms decided upon in the 
IMF-Colombia Stand-by Agreement two years ago must pass if 
economic growth is to continue in the long run.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.   (SBU)  The IMF delegation\'s third review of the Stand-by 
Agreement, which Colombia signed two years ago, commended 
Colombia on its positive economic growth and applied pressure 
for reforms.  The IMF was impressed by the GOC,s GDP growth 
(3.5 percent), fiscal deficit reduction (2.8 percent of GDP) 
and inflation stabilization (6.49 percent) over the past 
year. In addition, the IMF commended the Central bank for its 
handling of monetary policy.  In light of the positive news, 
the IMF announced that it had adjusted its growth 
expectations for Colombia in 2004 up to 4 percent GDP from 
3.3 percent.  In addition, the IMF expects that the GOC will 
meet its public fiscal deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP 
(down from 2.8 for 2003) and that inflation will remain under 
control. 
 
3.    (SBU)  Although the economic data paints a bright 
picture, the IMF acknowledged that these successes could be 
fleeting if the GOC did not continue structural reform by 
passing budget code and pension reforms.  The IMF team, 
recognizing the tough legislative fight ahead, expressed some 
concern that other issues (such as re-election) might 
distract the GOC.  They urged the GOC to focus on passing 
these reforms.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2014 
TAGS: ECON, ETRD, CO, FTA 
SUBJECT: ANDEAN FTA ANALYSIS: CUSTOMS ISSUES IN COLOMBIA 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Milton Drucker for reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Despite previous reforms to Colombia\'s 
customs administration, more modernization is needed to fully 
support trade under an FTA. The customs bureaucracy itself 
hampers trade, lacking specialized staff and equipment, and 
suffering from high management turnover. Pilferage in customs 
warehouses and truck robberies are frequent, and shipments 
may be detained indefinitely or refused entry for minor 
infractions. In FTA talks, Colombia may request assistance to 
modernize laboratories, train experts, and develop online 
systems. This would promote transparency and efficiency, and 
improve oversight, control and customer service. This is the 
third of a series of sector briefs developed in preparation 
for the Andean FTA.  The summaries are based on in-depth 
studies which are available from USAID Bogota.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Background 
 
2. (C) Despite two 1990\'s reforms to Colombia\'s customs 
administration that reduced costs, improved consistency and 
addressed contraband and money laundering, more modernization 
is needed to fully support trade under an FTA. Customs policy 
and operations are managed by DIAN, the country\'s tax 
collection agency.  DIAN lacks specialized technical 
divisions to conduct origin, valuation and classification of 
merchandise, and require better-trained staff and specialized 
equipment.  High turnover of management -nearly 100 percent 
annually for non-political posts- adds to DIAN\'s 
institutional instability. 
 
3. (C) The DIAN bureaucracy itself forms a barrier to trade 
for both local and foreign companies.  Pilferage in customs 
warehouses and truck robberies are frequent.  Shipments may 
be detained indefinitely or refused entry for improper tariff 
classification, incorrect address, or typing errors.  Minor 
infractions are subject to stiff penalties. 
 
Issue:  Rules of Origin 
 
4. (C) Certificates of origin demonstrate that products 
qualify for preferential treatment under the FTA. Though the 
Trade Ministry determines the origin of goods, issues 
certificates and rules on the validity of foreign 
certificates, it lacks the specialized personnel and funds to 
provide adequate and effective control.  Certificate formats 
and origin verification procedures are not standardized. 
Ideally, origin verification should be a post-import 
procedure, with inspections used only when fraud is 
suspected. Certificates should be issued at the customers\' 
request, and shipments should be released without necessarily 
requiring certificate presentation.  Private exporters should 
provide importers with standardized information on rules of 
origin; under the current system the GOC certifies origin of 
goods on behalf of Colombian exporters. 
 
Issue: Valuation and Reference Prices 
 
5. (C) DIAN\'s valuation of goods is partially compliant with 
the WTO customs code.  Currently DIAN requires an Andean 
Valuation Statement for each import.  For greater efficiency, 
this should be required only in specific instances like for 
post-import controls and visits. 
 
6. (SBU) Colombia used minimum prices of reference to 
determine the customs value of merchandise until disallowed 
by the WTO in April 2003.  However the GOC replaced them with 
\"estimated prices,\" which are ranges of maximum and minimum 
prices used to control prices of imported goods. Currently 
these apply to tires, certain textiles and apparel products, 
shoes, and some electric products.  The GOC also applies a 
price-band for agricultural products, as well as reference 
prices for other sensitive products including paper, liquor, 
iron and steel products. DIAN may confiscate and charge a 
surtax on goods whose declared price is below the reference 
price, a practice inconsistent with the WTO. 
 
Issue:  Classification 
 
7. (SBU) The Brussels Convention on Classification of Customs 
Goods and Tariffs established three criteria for 
classification of merchandise that were also adopted by the 
WTO and the GOC based upon the definition of the product, its 
cost and its place of origin. Unfortunately, the DIAN lacks 
the specialized personnel and up-to-date laboratories needed 
to adequately classify merchandise. 
 
Issue:   Inspections, Sanctions and Control 
 
8. (U) Customs officials inspect merchandise to verify the 
importer\'s declaration.  Trained inspectors perform random 
post-clearance investigations to detect fraud, foreign 
exchange irregularities, and tax evasion.  Major brokers have 
a customs office in their own bonded warehouses where 
merchandise is cleared before delivery to the customer. 
 
9. (SBU) Some 231 actions or omissions may result in fines 
and suspension or cancellation of shipments.  Just 25 percent 
of sanctions are made on substantive grounds, while most are 
due to faulty import declarations or delays in payment of 
accrued tariffs.  Evidence provided directly to DIAN from 
foreign authorities is invalid in Colombian courts if not 
collected via the MFA, thus slowing the legal settlement of 
cases. 
 
Issue:  Foreign Trade Procedures and Management 
 
10. (U) DIAN requires nearly all importations to be 
undertaken through customs brokers, with exceptions for 
large-scale importers, tourists and a few others. This 
requirement was imposed to improve control mechanisms, and 
despite the higher initial transaction costs to users, the 
system has helped to professionalize foreign trade management 
processes. 
 
11. (SBU) Colombian customs offices lack a central electronic 
system to manage all import, export and transit regimes. 
Offices in Cartagena, Buenaventura, Medellin and Bogota use 
obsolete systems that are not compatible and cannot track 
temporary imports.  Smaller border offices like Leticia 
perform procedures manually, causing delays and inefficiency. 
 
 
Issue:  Legal Compliance with International Regimes 
 
12. (SBU) Colombian Law 6 of 1971 and Law 7 of 1991 regulate 
customs procedures and foreign trade. These laws need to be 
updated to reflect WTO customs valuation procedures and the 
simplification of customs regimes established by the Kyoto 
agreement.  Colombia belongs to the WTO agreement on customs 
valuation, to the Brussels World Customs Organization, and to 
the Kyoto agreement. 
 
Issue:  Special Regimes 
 
13. (C) The oversight procedures and systems in place to 
operate Colombia\'s special regimes are woefully deficient. 
The Vallejo Plan is a tariff and VAT-free special regime that 
encourages import of raw materials, intermediate and capital 
goods and spare parts to produce goods and services for 
export.  Free Zones are tariff and VAT-free areas that 
encourage economic development.  In practice, however, it is 
extremely difficult to track and verify the final destination 
of goods covered by the regimes to guarantee that benefits 
are warranted.  Thus producers may avoid tariffs and the VAT 
undeservedly, regardless of the final destination of the 
goods in question.  The Trade Ministry and DIAN should 
improve their coordination, as well as training in legal and 
procedural norms.  Training is needed to better control the 
entry and exit of goods in special regime zones and to verify 
the eligibility of production and assembly operations located 
in the zones. 
 
14. (C) Getting to the Table:  What GOC Needs to Do 
 
A. Colombia needs to implement an intensive training program 
to improve compliance with WTO valuation guidelines. Training 
should include instruction on approved valuation 
methodologies and practical exposure to WTO compliance 
systems used in the region. 
 
B. The valuation rules defined by DIAN should be publicized 
to educate and update users. 
 
C. Colombia needs to demonstrate that its rules of origin are 
transparent, do not distort international trade, and are 
managed impartially and consistently. 
 
D. DIAN needs to improve its institutional stability, 
possibly restructuring the DIAN over the long-term.  Turnover 
of management must be addressed. 
 
E. DIAN technical divisions should be beefed up with adequate 
equipment, modern laboratories and specialized personnel to 
investigate and sanction violations to the rules of origin, 
valuation, and classification of merchandise. 
 
F. Although customs intermediary companies must comply with 
DIAN\'s regulations, they should be monitored more closely to 
insure quality of procedures and to clamp down on 
unauthorized brokers. Integrated customs and sanctioning 
regimes would improve efficiency. 
15. (C) Overall GOC Position on Customs 
 
A. Colombia may request assistance to modernize customs 
laboratories, training in rules of origin as well as in 
valuation, classification, and development of integrated 
online information and customs transactions systems.  These 
would promote transparency and efficiency in valuation, 
classification, rules of origin, as well as oversight, 
control and customer service. 
 
B. In NAFTA and other international trade agreements, rules 
of origin are based on \"substantial transformation\" and 
require aggregate value tests.  These require a country to 
track a broad range of products, which is costly and requires 
specialized skills.  In an FTA, Colombia may press instead 
for rules of origin similar to those applied under the Andean 
Community Agreement.  These are based on more generic 
criteria related to the value of inputs from non-member 
countries as a percentage of the value of the final product, 
as well as changes in product classification in relation to 
imported inputs.  Colombia may argue that the cost of 
aggregate value tests could be higher than the gains from 
tariff reductions for specific products. 
 
C. Colombia may press for auto-certification by producers 
instead of Trade Ministry certification, as in the Chile FTA. 
The Ministry would instead police certificate validity. 
16. (C) GOC Negotiating Strategy for Customs 
 
A. The GOC understands that customs modernization is key to a 
successful FTA.  They will point to modernization efforts and 
may request U.S. technical assistance.

TAGS: PGOV, PINR, CO 
SUBJECT: PRESIDENTIAL REELECTION PASSES FIRST TEST 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons: 1.4 B & D. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  Prospects for passage of legislation to 
permit immediate presidential reelection are mixed.  As 
Constitutional reform, the proposal faces a challenging vote 
hurdle.  Approval requires eight votes: committee and 
plenary, both chambers, this session and next.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) Legislation to reform the Constitution to allow 
immediate presidential reelection passed Senate committee (12 
votes of 19 total) the week of April 26.  The bill is now 
before the full Senate.  As Constitutional reform, the 
measure requires approval by regular majorities (majority of 
quorum) in both houses prior to the close of the current 
congressional session on June 20.  Subsequently, it would 
need approval by \"qualified\" majorities (majority of total 
members) in both houses during the July-December session. 
 
3.  (U) The Conservative Party, with 25 of 102 senators and 
43 of 166 representatives, is the key swing vote on the 
issue.  If Uribista Liberals (roughly 35 in the Senate and 60 
in the House) and Conservatives vote in unison in favor, the 
reform will pass.  Former President Andres Pastrana, leader 
for a sizable percentage of the Conservative Party, publicly 
opposes reelection on the grounds that it should not apply to 
Uribe but only to future presidents.  However, Pastrana, in a 
leaked letter to party head Carlos Holguin, recommended that 
party members vote their consciences on the issue.  Uribe and 
Interior Minister Sabas Pretelt have consulted regularly with 
the Conservatives on the issue. 
 
4.  (U) Detractors include the Officialist Liberal Party, led 
by former presidents Ernesto Samper, Julio Turbay, and 
Alfonso Lopez, and the Independent Democratic Party (PDI) of 
Senator Antonio Navarro and Bogota Mayor Lucho Garzon.  The 
former stresses the view that reelection, if passed, should 
not benefit Uribe.  The latter largely resists reelection on 
ideological grounds.  The Liberals and PDI both hope to run 
their own candidate in 2006.  Many worry about the 
possibility of a level playing field for challengers to a 
sitting incumbent. 
 
5.  (C) The qualified majority requirement in the second 
round is a serious hurdle.  Public opinion is strongly on 
Uribe\'s side, with 70-80 percent in favor of reelecting him, 
according to various recent polls.  Uribe has the numbers in 
Congress provided that the Uribista Liberals and 
Conservatives vote in unison on the issue.  Our senior level 
Conservative contacts concur that the party will vote almost 
entirely in favor (with perhaps a handful of exceptions, 
particularly in the lower house).  However, Uribista Liberal 
contacts in both houses have told us privately that some of 
their ranks have become concerned with Uribe\'s over-attention 
to the Conservatives. 
 
6.  (C) Comment:  Defeat in this session of Congress--in 
either house--would likely spell  death for the issue, as the 
clock would have to start over with the July-December session 
and continue into the March-June session of 2005.  Our 
interlocutors say that would be too close to the presidential 
election in summer 2006 to be viable.

A Bad Period for Security Forces: 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) March and April have been difficult months for the 
security forces: 
 
-- On March 19, the Army killed seven anti-kidnapping (GAULA) 
police and four civilians in the municipality of Guaitarilla, 
Narino department.  There are numerous inconsistencies 
surrounding the event and suspicions of illicit activity and 
manipulation of evidence on the parts of both the police and 
military (ref A). 
 
-- On April 10, a battalion from the Army\'s 6th Brigade 
killed five civilians -- including a 6-month-old infant -- 
who they mistook for FARC guerrillas in the municipality of 
Cajamarca, Tolima department (ref B). 
 
-- On April 13, two Army units conducting counterparamilitary 
operations engaged in friendly fire in the municipality of 
Puerto Gaitan, Meta department.  Three soldiers were killed 
and one gravely wounded (ref C). 
 
-- On April 15, the CNP arrested Jaime Londono, the head of a 
gang that carries out assassinations and other criminal 
activity for drug trafficker \"Don Diego,\" in a military 
officer\'s club in Bogota.  Londono was with a retired Navy 
officer and a civilian, who also were arrested. 
 
-- Over the weekend of April 16, the Navy found 16.5 kilos of 
heroin and 10 kilos of cocaine concealed in candy boxes 
aboard \"La Gloria,\" the Navy\'s sail training \"tall ship\" 
stationed in Cartagena, Bolivar department.  The ship was 
bound for the U.S. 
 
----------------------------- 
Public Admission of Errors... 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) In mid-April, both Minister of Defense (MOD) Uribe and 
Armed Forces Commander General Ospina gave interviews to the 
country\'s two leading newspapers in which they admitted their 
forces made serious mistakes and promised thorough 
investigations.  The MOD acknowledged that many new soldiers 
need better training but emphasized that the Armed Forces are 
capable of effectively confronting illegal armed groups. 
Similarly, Navy Commander Admiral Soto immediately announced 
the drug seizure on \"La Gloria.\"  Army Commander Carreno 
visited Cajamarca and, on April 14, held an all day meeting 
in Cordoba Department with numerous brigade commanders to 
address how to prevent friendly fire and other errors. 
Although admissions were sometimes grudging, Colombian 
handling of these issues represents a step forward in 
transparency and public accountability. 
 
---------------------------- 
... Followed by Legal Action 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The GOC is taking steps to hold accountable those 
responsible: 
-- Although the case still is under investigation, both the 
CNP and Army punished officers for their failings in the 
Guaitarilla case.  The CNP dismissed the GAULA chief in 
Narino, Captain Jaime Yepes, for authorizing a poorly planned 
operation, and the Army relieved \"Battle of Boyaca\" Battalion 
Operations Officer Major Ernesto Coral of duty for 
\"mishandling information\" about the incident.  Immediately 
after the incident, President Uribe ordered an internal 
report, which was subsequently deemed to be unclear with each 
service accusing the other of wrongdoing.  Next, the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office (Fiscalia) initiated a criminal 
investigation and announced on April 27 that the case would 
be tried in military courts because the parties involved were 
on active duty.  So far, both the police and army stories 
seem to raise more questions. 
-- In response to the \"La Gloria\" drug seizure, President 
Uribe suspended the entire 75-member crew.  They will not be 
reinstated until they are cleared of any involvement.  The 
military justice system is investigating, and MOD Uribe and 
Admiral Soto have told U.S. officials they believe they have 
identified at least three guilty individuals.  President 
Uribe assured U.S. Coast Guard Commandant, whose visit to 
Cartagena coincided with the seizure, that he would punish 
those responsible. 
 
-- The Army may be able to clear itself of at least some 
responsibility for the civilian deaths in Cajamarca.  The 
area has long been controlled by the FARC, which had 
prohibited all road travel in the area where the civilians 
were killed.  The Ministry of Defense has provided the 
Fiscalia with evidence that the FARC forced the five 
civilians to leave their home in order to distract and 
confuse the Army unit operating nearby. 
 
-- The Puerto Gaitan case is a clear-cut friendly fire 
incident.  The military is conducting an internal 
investigation.  The military relieved the Battalion 
commander, Company commander, and Squadron leader of duty. 
 
-- The military has begun an internal investigation as to how 
Londono -- a wanted criminal -- was given access to an 
officer\'s club.  Initial findings suggest he used fake 
documents and was assisted by the retired Navy officer who 
accompanied him.  He was found in possesion of numerous cell 
phones, two handguns, and a large amount of cash, suggesting 
he was involved in conducting narcotics-related violence in 
Bogota.  Normally, his gang\'s center of operations is in 
Cali.  The Fiscalia has charged Londono with conspiracy to 
commit a crime, use of false documentation, and narcotics 
trafficking.  The event has received limited media attention, 
but a thorough investigation will be key to determining the 
extent of Londono,s connection to the military. 
 
------------------------------- 
Souring Inter-Service Relations 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The Guaitarilla incident has further strained already 
tense Police-Army relations and highlighted coordination 
problems.  Army Commander General Carreno and CNP Commander 
General Castro, who have clashed on other occasions, have 
been personally involved in the internal investigations that 
seek to blame the other service.  Impartiality will be 
particularly important and equally difficult in this 
investigation.  The CNP\'s arrest of Londono in a military 
officer\'s club also has the potential to irritate 
police-military rivarly, although less so thanks to Soto\'s 
and Ospina\'s support for the arrest of the retired Navy 
officer who was caught with Londono. 
 
----------------------- 
Grist for Uribe Critics 
----------------------- 
 
6. (C) Uribe\'s critics in Congress used the events to 
question recently approved anti-terrorism legislation, 
asserting that the security forces are incapable of 
responsibly exercising expanded judicial powers granted them 
in the statute.  Human rights organizations have expressed 
concerns about poor training in the security forces and 
possible links to corruption by officials implicated in the 
incidents.

REF: SECSTATE 64720 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood; reason 1.4 (d) 
 
1. (U) This is an Action Request (please see paragraphs 2 and 
12) in reply to reftel request for information about 
Colombian Law 793 of 2002, \"La Ley de la Extincion de 
Dominio.\" 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Colombia has two laws that address asset forfeiture 
and seizure, one criminal (Law 600) and one civil (Law 793). 
In addition, the draft \"Law of Justice and Reparations\" 
currently before Congress contemplates \"donations\" of legal 
assets to fund victims\' compensation.  Criminal seizures 
under Law 600 are cumbersome and time-consuming, but civil 
forfeiture under Law 793 is relatively efficient.  Once goods 
are under the GOC\'s control, however, there is no ready means 
to liquidate them.  Current laws limit how the GOC can use 
seized assets, so the GOC currently has no plans to use them 
to fund demobilization of illegal armed groups.  The Embassy 
is encouraging the GOC to identify assets -- forfeited or 
otherwise government-owned -- that it could quickly 
liquidate, and examining how the GOC could modify current 
laws or draft new ones to facilitate liquidation of assets in 
the future.  In addition, the \"Law of Justice and 
Reparations\" would, if approved in its current form, allow 
the GOC to \"encourage\" wealthy leaders of illegal armed 
groups entering into demobilization agreements to donate 
substantial assets to the government which would redistribute 
them as a form of reparations to victims.  ACTION REQUEST: 
Embassy requests Washington\'s assistance to help the GOC 
develop an effective legal mechanism to liquidate seized 
assets, both legally and illegally acquired by 
narco-terrorists, and redistribute them to victims of 
violence.  End Action Request and Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Colombian Asset Forfeiture and Seizure Laws 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Colombia has two laws that address asset forfeiture 
and seizure: Law 793, which governs civil forfeitures, and 
Law 600, which regulates criminal seizures.  Assets forfeited 
under Law 600 in narcotics cases as well as assets seized 
pursuant to Law 793 are turned over to the National Narcotics 
Affairs Office (\"Direccion Nacional de Estupefacients,\" or 
DNE), which uses the assets to subsidize anti-narcotics law 
enforcement efforts.  The Office of the Prosecutor General 
(\"Fiscalia\") manages assets seized or forfeited for 
non-narcotics reasons.  The Fiscalia has limited power to 
dispose of these assets, although it can donate them to 
specific charitable organizations. 
 
4. (U) The GOC has no comprehensive estimate of its inventory 
of assets seized in criminal proceedings and forfeitures, 
although it has records of seized assets currently managed by 
the DNE and a general, if imprecise, inventory of seized 
assets held by the Fiscalia.  Interagency seizure estimates 
included in paragraph 5 include only property forfeited 
civilly. 
 
5. (U) According to the GOC, it has seized assets from civil 
cases valued at nearly USD 215 million since Law 793 went 
into effect in December 2002.  In 2002, the GOC focused its 
efforts on five departments and seized assets from the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), National 
Liberation Army (ELN), Popular Liberation Army (EPL), United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), and independent 
narcotrafficking organizations totaling over 235 billion 
Colombian pesos (nearly USD 83 million).  Seizures in 2003 
totaled more than 365 billion pesos (over USD 131 million), 
as the GOC expanded operations into more departments and 
targeted more narcotraffickers.  However, the overwhelming 
majority of these seizures were of real estate; less than 5 
percent of seized assets were liquid. 
 
6. (SBU) The Embassy has not been able to identify a legal 
basis for GOC disposal/sale of forfeited assets.  This poses 
a severe constraint and helps explain why the assets remain 
\"locked up\" in the GOC.  The Embassy is doing its own legal 
analysis to determine if there is an easy way to remedy this 
problem.  Those from whom assets have been seized would 
probably fight an amendment to existing legislation. 
Moreover, narcotraffickers have threatened anyone attempting 
to put seized assets to productive use.  Any sale or disposal 
of assets would have to be accompanied by appropriate 
security measures to ensure that the new owner survives the 
transfer of ownership. 
 
----------------------- 
Ad Hoc Seizure Strategy 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) Under the current forfeiture/seizure system, law 
enforcement and military forces identify financial targets on 
an ad hoc basis.  No strategy exists to establish financial 
target priorities or systematically develop joint, 
interagency tactics for attacking them.  For most criminal 
and all civil cases, data goes to Fiscalia prosecutors; 
however, the Fiscalia\'s processing is notoriously slow. 
There is no distinction between terrorists and other 
criminals under Colombian seizure laws. 
------------------- 
Interagency Process 
------------------- 
 
8. (U) Law 793 shifted the burden of proof in civil 
forfeiture cases from the state to the individual, making all 
goods illegal unless proven otherwise.  The streamlined civil 
forfeiture proceedings can be completed in 90 days. 
Unfortunately, procedures for criminal seizures are still 
cumbersome and excessively bureaucratic; there is no set 
deadline or hierarchy for criminal cases and decisions take 
place at the same speed as the corresponding trials.  Various 
law enforcement agencies, as well as the Fiscalia, have 
authority to initiate seizure proceedings.  Depending on the 
crime, the Ministry of Interior and Justice, the Ministry of 
Defense, the Inspector General\'s Office (\"Procuraduria\"), 
National Narcotics Affairs Office, and/or the National 
Comptroller General\'s Office can be involved in the process. 
 
---------------------- 
Demobilization Process 
---------------------- 
 
9. (U) Decree 128 of January 2003 outlines the process for 
providing economic benefits to individuals who demobilize and 
reincorporate into civilian life, but does not specify the 
origin of such funds.  Current law does not provide for the 
use of seized assets to fund demobilization, and the GOC has 
no plans to do so. 
 
10. (U) The proposed \"Law of Justice and Reparations\" now 
before the Colombian Congress would require individuals to 
\"donate\" assets for victims\' compensation as a sign of good 
faith.  GOC officials have told us they assume these 
donations would come from legal funds, since illicitly 
obtained assets should be forfeited.  Moreover, illicit 
assets placed in a victims\' compensation fund would still be 
susceptible, in theory, to forfeiture, since the donor would 
have had no legal right to transfer them. 
 
11. (SBU) Even when assets are immediately and freely 
transferable, potential recipients often fear retribution 
from narco-terrorists and are unwilling to receive them. 
Given such anxieties, and considering the complicated 
interagency requirements in place for seizures and the 
minimal liquid assets available from them, the current asset 
forfeiture system would have to undergo significant changes 
in order to finance demobilization.  The Embassy is 
encouraging the GOC to identify assets -- forfeited or 
otherwise government-owned -- that it could quickly 
liquidate.  At the same time, we are looking at how the GOC 
could modify current laws or draft new ones to enable quick 
liquidation of assets in the future. 
 
12. (U) ACTION REQUEST:  Embassy requests Washington\'s 
assistance to help the GOC develop an effective legal 
mechanism to liquidate seized assets, both legally and 
illegally acquired by narco-terrorists, and redistribute them 
to victims of violence.  The recommendations should take into 
account that the proposed legal mechanism would operate in 
the context of an offer to illegal armed groups to enter into 
a peace process and demobilize.  End Action Request.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/28/2014 
TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EFIN, CO, FTA 
SUBJECT: ANDEAN FTA ANALYSIS: FINANCIAL SERVICES ISSUES IN 
COLOMBIA 
 
 
Classified By: William B. Wood for reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Colombia\'s financial services sector is 
distinguished by a regulatory framework that restricts 
multi-banking and seeks to control money laundering and 
capital flight.  International financial services firms are 
restricted to those with a subsidiary in the country, and use 
of foreign executives is limited by regulation.  To fully 
benefit from an FTA, the GOC should permit multi-banking and 
allow foreign firms to establish branch offices.  Adoption of 
international accounting practices, shareholder rights and 
information disclosure would improve investor confidence, 
while liberalization would reduce the cost of financial 
services by an estimated 25 percent.  Colombian financial 
institutions are resistant to change and fear entry of U.S. 
firms with deep access to capital.  However, they also wish 
to capture remittance flows and other business of Colombian 
immigrant communities in the U.S. This is the fourth in a 
series of sector briefs developed in preparation for the 
Andean FTA.  The summaries are based on in-depth studies 
which are available from USAID Bogota. END SUMMARY. 
 
Background 
 
2. (U) Colombia began liberalizing financial services in 
1991, eliminating entrance restrictions and limits to foreign 
investment, while allowing for greater mobility of 
international capital.  In 1994, the GOC moved to a financial 
system in which distinct financial services (insurance, 
banking etc.) could be owned by the same holding company as 
long as management of each type of service was separate. 
This model was adopted instead of a multi-banking model that 
permits the same firm to provide multiple types of services 
under the same management.  The GOC has studied lifting 
restrictions on multi-banking, but retains restrictions on 
international financial flows to control both money 
laundering and capital flight. 
 
3. (U) International financial transactions are heavily 
regulated and the GOC requires foreign firms to establish 
subsidiaries in the country to fully operate, preventing them 
from entering the market through branch offices.  These 
controls on foreign exchange transactions are maintained in 
part because they help the GOC combat money laundering. The 
use of foreign personnel in foreign financial institutions, 
especially managers and legal representatives, is limited by 
regulation. 
 
4. (U) Financial services grew from 4.3 percent of GDP in 
1991 to 6.4 percent of GDP in 1998, mainly due to 
liberalization policies.  Liberalization also extended to 
insurance, trusts, brokerage, investment banking, and the 
management of foreign investment funds and pension funds. 
However, all of these services remain restricted for 
international firms, including limits to the purchase of such 
services abroad.  In 1999-2000 the financial services sector 
contracted significantly due to the country\'s economic 
crisis.  Although it has rebounded over the past two years 
due to stable macro-economic policies and a tightened 
regulatory framework, the sector today represents about 5.3 
percent of GDP. 
 
Financial Services Issues for Discussion in an FTA 
 
5. (U) Fiduciary, investment banking, commercial loans, 
leasing, and insurance services are separated from banking 
services under Colombian law, limiting the operation of banks 
and other financial institutions.  Current legislation 
permits banking institutions to house such activities in the 
same office, but management of the services must be separate. 
 
6. (SBU) International banking institutions must establish 
subsidiaries and must comply with the same capital and other 
requirements as local financial institutions.  Branch offices 
of foreign firms are allowed to advertise and provide 
information, but transactions must occur through third 
parties. Banking industry representatives are concerned large 
U.S. banks opening branch offices without having to comply 
with capital investment requirements could readily draw on 
deep pockets overseas and undercut local banks. 
 
7. (U) International securities traders must have subsidiary 
offices. The same applies for stock exchanges and exchanges 
of agricultural products.  International stock brokerage 
subsidiaries must obtain operating license from the 
Superintendent of Securities. 
 
8. (U) International insurance providers must have subsidiary 
offices for transactions to be legal.  This limitation 
applies not only to life insurance, pensions, and health 
insurance, but also to insurance for transportation of people 
and merchandise. 
 
9. (SBU) Colombian banks wish to capture remittance flows, 
which topped US$ 3 billion in 2003.  Remittances constitute a 
principle financial flow into Colombia that largely do not 
pass through the formal financial system despite extremely 
high costs of wire transfers.  The  financial sector 
continues to seek opportunities to direct the flows through 
formal channels, a goal shared by the GOC to better control 
money laundering.  Establishment of branches in Colombian 
immigrant communities in the U.S. is a key goal.  USAID and 
IDB are initiating a program designed to integrate 
remittances within the formal banking system. 
 
10. (SBU) The current regulatory framework for the Colombian 
securities market does not mandate the adoption of 
international accounting and audit standards for issuers and 
intermediaries, nor does it provide for stringent 
self-regulation.  Minority shareholder rights, information 
disclosure and conflict of interest provisions for 
corporations need strengthening.  Finally, there is no 
integrated prudential oversight regime for financial 
institutions in the banking and securities market.  New 
legislative and regulatory reforms that would address these 
issues are under development but not yet adopted. 
 
11. (C) Almost $8.5 billion in private pension fund assets 
(10 percent of GDP) is available to stimulate corporate bond 
and equity markets, but almost all of this is currently held 
in government debt.  An improved regulatory framework 
(including liberalization of pension funds) could jump-start 
innovative financing for channeling savings to the private 
sector. 
 
12. (C) Getting to the Table:  What GOC Needs to Do 
 
A. Permit multi-banking.  The integration of financial 
services would provide advantages in terms of lower cost and 
better risk management.  If a multi-banking scheme is 
adopted, regulatory oversight should also be integrated, 
combining functions of the Superintendents of Banking, 
Securities, and Credit Unions. 
 
B. Permit foreign firms to establish branch offices. 
Allowing foreign firms to open branch offices would improve 
financial sector stability.  As foreign banks specialize in 
large customers and commercial banking, profit margins are 
reduced for local banks, which compete for medium and small 
customers and those not covered by the financial system. 
 
C. Achieve long-term fiscal balance.  Fiscal instability 
hampers the liberalization and diversification of financial 
services, and heightens interest in the provision of capital 
controls. 
 
D. Strengthen the capital market regulatory framework. 
Improved accounting, audit, shareholder rights and 
information disclosure would improve investor confidence and 
diversify and expand funding for private companies looking to 
benefit from the FTA. 
 
E. Liberalize regulation of financial services.  A recent 
USAID study estimates GOC regulations add some 25 percent to 
the cost of banking services.  Further liberalization would 
likely generate important productivity gains and improve the 
competitiveness and diversification of financial services 
provided to the Colombian private sector. 
 
Overall GOC Demands on Financial Services 
 
GOC is likely to argue that U.S. banking branches in Colombia 
must bring substantial capital to invest locally rather than 
draw on deeper sources abroad. 
 
13. (C) GOC Positions on Key Financial Services Products 
 
A. Colombian Banks wish to locate branches in U.S.-Colombian 
immigrant communities.  This would permit capture of a larger 
share of the remittance market and financial transactions 
between traders in both countries.  Likewise, Colombian 
insurance companies wish to sell insurance to Colombian 
communities in the U.S. 
 
14. (C) GOC Negotiating Strategy for Financial Services 
 
A. GOC may argue it needs tight controls on international 
financial transactions to control money laundering and 
capital flight.  GOC may accept additional U.S. technical 
assistance in fighting money laundering as an alternative.

SUBJECT: ANDEAN FTA ANALYSIS: TELECOMS AND NON-FINANCIAL 
SERVICES IN COLOMBIA 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Milton Drucker for reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  Telecoms and other non-financial services 
account for 59 percent of Colombia\'s GDP.  Despite two waves 
of liberalization, regulatory barriers still protect 
state-owned service providers from private and foreign firms. 
 Barriers to foreign providers of professional services are 
fairly restrictive, with licensing, residency and nationality 
requirements, as well as ill-defined economic need tests. 
Colombia is likely to continue liberalization and seek 
improvements in services regulation to compensate for market 
failures, externalities and asymmetries.  In the long run, 
services liberalization could increase GDP and national 
welfare by an estimated 10 and 15 percent respectively.  This 
is the fifth in a series of sector briefs developed in 
preparation for the Andean FTA.  The summaries are based on 
in-depth studies which are available from USAID Bogota.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Background 
 
4. (U) Services as a percentage of GDP increased from 49 
percent in 1990 to 59 percent in 2001.  Liberalization of 
trade in services, however, has been slower than in goods. 
USAID estimates further liberalization of the sector could 
increase GDP and national welfare by 10 and 15 percent 
respectively.  An initial stage opened the economy to foreign 
investment, allowed private companies to provide public 
infrastructure services like telecommunications (3 percent of 
GDP), energy, gas and water (3 percent of GDP), and 
privatized public companies.  In the latter 1990\'s, a second 
stage gradually increased competition in these sectors as 
well as in social and government services (21 percent of 
GDP), transportation, and gas.  Foreign investment in 
services was nearly 62 percent of total foreign investment 
over the last decade. 
 
5. (SBU) Barriers to trade in services include quantitative 
restrictions, price controls, discriminatory standards, 
licenses, and discriminatory access to distribution networks. 
  The GOC designs and implements policy and regulates, 
supervises and controls the market. The Colombian 
Constitution does not require regulators to be independent 
from the executive branch in carrying out these functions. 
 
6. (U) Since 1994, Colombia has posted a US$ 1.5 billion 
annual trade deficit in services.  Exports of travel services 
amounted to US$ 962 million in 2002, and include tourism, 
health and education (foreign patients and students treated 
and studying in Colombia).  Exports of transportation and 
communication services together amounted to US$ 800 million 
in 2002.   In 2002, 24,669 temporary workers were allowed 
from Colombia into the United States, mainly specialists, 
corporate transfers, and recognized athletes and artists. 
Likewise, 67,544 business people entered the United States in 
2002. 
 
Barriers to Professional Services 
 
7. (U) Professional services are the most restricted. 
Residency requirements restrict foreign trade of such 
services, while accreditation and license requirements 
restrict temporary professional services.  Economic needs 
tests are required when foreign professionals operate 
temporarily.  These restrictions apply to accounting, 
bookkeeping, auditing, architecture, engineering, urban 
planning, medical and dental services, among others. 
Accreditation and degree homologation mechanisms, as well as 
regulations that restrict prices, income, and advertising 
also inhibit trade. Colombia argues that regulation is 
necessary to counter asymmetric market information and 
externalities. 
 
8. (U) Health service providers must register with regulatory 
authorities, which impose strict parameters on costs and 
service quality.  Foreign educational institutions must have 
resident status before operating.  Legal services are limited 
to firms licensed under Colombian law.  Foreign law firms can 
operate only under joint venture and under the licenses of 
Colombian lawyers.  A commercial presence is required for 
information-processing services.  Tourism services must be 
registered and licensed by authorities. 
Barriers to Telecommunications Services 
 
9. (SBU) Colombian telecom reforms have sought to promote 
competition in an existing environment of natural monopoly, 
and with some success.  Reforms have eased access to 
essential networks for market providers.  However the tariff 
regime continues to cross-subsidize local telephony with 
higher long-distance fees, and higher income households 
subsidize telephone services for lower income households. 
Cross-subsidies control prices and limit competition, 
creating an important market entry cost.  Local prices are 25 
percent under the international average and long-distance 35 
percent above average, creating distortions that inhibit the 
entrance of new competitors.  Altogether, Colombia\'s 
regulatory structure produces an estimated 34 percent 
over-cost in telecommunications. 
10. (U) Other barriers to telecommunications services include 
commercial presence and licensing requirements for both 
foreign and local operators.  The Telecommunications 
Regulatory Commission (CRT) may establish economic need tests 
for the approval of licenses for the provision of voice, 
facsimile, e-mail, and other value-aggregate services. 
However, parameters that determine \"economic need tests\" are 
not clearly established. 
 
11. (U) Most restrictions on foreign telecom services have 
been lifted, though concessions are only granted to firms 
legally set-up in Colombia.  Foreign investment is allowed in 
telecommunications firms, but under WTO rules Colombia limits 
foreign investment in these firms based on an economic needs 
test.  Colombia permits 100 percent foreign ownership of 
telecoms, but high license fees form a significant barrier to 
entry. A prohibition on long-distance \"call-back\" services is 
the only specific discrimination against foreign providers. 
 
Barriers to Energy Services 
 
12. (C) Energy generation was liberalized through 
privatization in the 1990\'s.  However, energy distribution 
and transmission are less open due to crossed subsidies, the 
deterioration of state-owned distributors, and decreasing 
demand. Under the current price structure, higher-income 
households and industrial and commercial consumers provide a 
20 percent subsidy for poor households, limiting competition 
and creating distortions. As a consequence, household energy 
consumption is 10 percent larger than industrial energy 
consumption. Although the cost of energy generation is lower 
in Colombia than in most Latin American countries, prices for 
industrial energy consumption are on average 30 percent 
higher than in those countries. Additionally, the strong 
dependency of regulatory entities (CREG) on the government 
results in a lack of incentives to open to competition that 
would affect the already deteriorated public distribution 
companies. 
 
Barriers to Audiovisual, Television and Radio Services 
 
13. (C) The independent National TV Commission (CNTV) 
formulates TV policy, regulates market structure, and 
oversees content. CNTV has created a model of open TV where 
private programmers use state-owned channels under exclusive 
agreement.  CNTV gives concessions for cable and subscription 
TV under regional licensing agreements, but new licenses are 
subject to economic need tests, which are not clearly defined 
and lack transparency.  CNTV requires 50 percent national 
content for programming and 70 percent for prime time, while 
foreign artists in national productions are limited to 10 
percent of staring roles. CNTV is widely considered one of 
the GOC\'s more bureaucratic institutions. 
 
14. (U) Radio broadcasting is licensed through auctions to 
private operators. The Communications Ministry licenses, 
regulates, and oversees radio stations, and operates the 
national radio broadcast station.  Colombia restricts foreign 
participation in state TV (40 percent) and in radio stations 
(25 percent).  All films are taxed to finance the national 
Cinema Development Fund, which promotes national film 
productions. 
 
Barriers to Transportation Services 
 
15. (U) In spite of liberalizing reforms, maritime and air 
cabotage services (transport between two points in a country) 
remain strongly restricted, as are transborder transportation 
services. Land cargo transport companies must have a 
commercial presence in the country and be licensed. 
Likewise, only Colombian residents can provide domestic or 
international air transport.  Colombia\'s law permits 
international cabotage companies to provide services \"only 
when there is no national capacity to provide the service.\" 
Maritime companies may not lease foreign flagged vessels, 
unless they show there are no Colombian vessels that meet 
their needs. Colombian nationals must own at least 60 percent 
of maritime agencies.  The captain, officers, and 80 percent 
of the crew of Colombian vessels must be Colombians.  This 
also applies to foreign vessels that stay in Colombian waters 
longer than six months. All airlines are obliged to hire 90 
percent Colombian personnel, and Colombian pilots must 
command commercial flights. 
 
16. (C) Getting to the Table:  What GOC Needs to Do 
 
A. Provide Colombian supervisory authorities with greater 
independence from policy-making institutions to avoid the use 
of regulatory barriers to protect state-owned companies. 
Without greater independence, supervisory authorities will 
continue to lack legal, budgetary and technical autonomy, and 
the GOC and Congress will continue to interfere in their 
regulatory decisions. 
 
B. Unify regulatory oversight to avoid inefficiency.  The 
Superintendent of Industry and Commerce oversees all sectors 
but energy utilities, which are inefficiently overseen by the 
Public Services Superintendent. 
 
C. Determine clear regulatory parameters of economic need 
tests, which are an instrument that limit competition in 
various sectors. 
 
17. (C) Overall GOC Demands on Services 
 
A. Colombia will press the U.S. to ease visa restrictions for 
workers and students seeking U.S. educational services. Visa 
policy is non-negotiable, but the increase in trade will 
prompt increased legitimate travel plans and therefore more 
visas. GOC would gain political cover with estimates of 
increased travel for legitimate business. 
 
B. Similarly, because small and medium enterprises cannot 
afford a permanent presence abroad, the GOC may press for 
improved access of temporary workers to the U.S. 
 
18 (C) GOC Positions on Services Products 
 
A. The GOC hopes to improve accreditation under reciprocal 
agreements.  However in Colombia professional accreditation 
is granted by the government, but in the U.S. it is the role 
of professional associations.  The GOC might agree to define 
economic need tests for the temporary movement of 
professionals. 
 
B. Colombia may lift restrictions on transportation and 
cabotage services under a condition of reciprocity, though 
9/11 related policies may hamper liberalization. 
 
C. Colombia might replace price-controlling and 
competition-limiting cross-subsidies in favor of direct 
subsidies to guarantee universal coverage for certain 
services. However, fiscal difficulties limit the GOC\'s 
negotiating capacity. 
 
D. GOC may liberalize the energy market, but this would 
require privatizing state-owned energy distributors that have 
largely failed, but have been protected by the CREG through 
biased regulation.

Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
1. (U) Summary. Sub-Director from Colombia\'s Civil Aviation 
Authority (CAA) plans to visit FAA in Miami and Washington to 
discuss recent FAA inspection. The GOC was not pleased with 
the results of the inspection, and is taking steps to comply 
with FAA recommendations.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) In late April, FAA inspectors traveled to Bogota to 
perform follow-up inspections of Avianca and Vertical 
Aviation repair shops.  FAA inspectors were satisfied with 
Avianca\'s repair shop but prohibited Vertical Aviation\'s shop 
to work on U.S. registered products because it failed 
inspection, (Vertical Aviation works on Bell helicopters). 
FAA will re-inspect Vertical Aviation in late June.  The FAA 
officials also briefed the CAA on deficiencies found in the 
CAA\'s inspection program.  FAA inspectors believe that 
training and resources are insufficient for CAA inspectors. 
The FAA also noticed that inspectors were not enforcing 
regulations due to fear of lawsuits by airline operators. 
FAA notes that CAA authorities are neither supporting CAA 
inspectors with legal support nor are they following all of 
FAA inspectors\' recommendations. 
 
3. (SBU) Econoff met with CAA Subdirector Colonel Carlos 
Ramirez regarding the FAA inspection.  Col Ramirez privately 
told econoff he was upset with the findings because he 
believed that disgruntled CAA inspectors negatively 
influenced the FAA inspection due to salary disputes. 
Regarding training, Col Ramirez told econoff the CAA recently 
hired 49 new contractors and have future training planned. 
He stated resources, such as computers and internet access, 
must be shared by contractors, especially due to the 
increased workforce.  Col Ramirez denied a lack of support to 
CAA inspectors and said if the CAA inspectors feared reprisal 
from the airlines, they should ask CAA directors to sign off 
on their inspection results. 
 
4. (SBU) Comment:  CAA authorities were caught off guard and 
not prepared for the FAA\'s review of the CAA inspection 
program.  To address the FAA\'s concerns, Col Ramirez plans to 
hire inspectors on short-term-but-renewable performance-based 
contracts due to problems associated with current disgruntled 
inspectors, whom the CAA cannot fire.

1.  (C) Summary:  The GOC has sought to calm passions 
following Venezuela\'s arrest of some 90 purported Colombian 
paramilitaries (Ref A).  President Uribe called for a 
thorough investigation and welcomed the actions of 
neighboring countries to prevent illegal activities of 
Colombians abroad.  A civil registry check of the detainees 
reveal many, maybe all, are in fact Colombians.  Reports 
vary, however, regarding how many have criminal records.  FM 
Barco met with President Chavez in Caracas on May 14 and 
announced that Chavez and President Uribe would meet in the 
near future.  Pundits and prominent members of Congress 
insist the arrests are a fabrication on the part of the 
Chavez Administration.  COLMIL contacts either don\'t know or 
aren\'t telling.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) President Uribe and senior GOC officials have 
responded calmly to Venezuela\'s arrest of purported Colombian 
paramilitaries in the last week, as they did after Venezuelan 
Army incursions into Colombia in January (Ref B).  Uribe has 
called for a complete investigation and has reiterated the 
GOC\'s desire that neighboring countries arrest Colombians 
involved in illegal activities, in particular terrorism.  FM 
Barco met with President Chavez and FM Perez in Caracas on 
May 14.  In her press remarks, Barco stated that her 
impression was that President Chavez was now certain that the 
GOC was not involved in the incident.  Colombian Army 
Commander General Martin Carreno, singled out by senior GOV 
officials for having had contacts with the alleged 
paramilitaries in Cucuta, Colombia (his hometown), in March, 
has denied the GOV\'s charges by noting that he was there to 
visit relatives.  Prominent members of the Colombian Congress 
and leading pundits, however, have come out strongly against 
Venezuela on the detentions, arguing it is a political 
spectacle orchestrated by Chavez. 
 
3.  (C) In conversations with MFA interlocutors on May 12, 
poloffs were advised that civil registry checks of the 
arrestees reveal they are in fact Colombians.  FM Barco 
publicly stated that thus far only one detainee has a 
criminal record in Colombia.  However, press reports, citing 
Department of Administrative Security (DAS, FBI equivalent) 
sources, state that 12 have criminal records.  On May 13, the 
GOC requested fingerprints of those arrested and ordered the 
DAS to run checks.  DAO officers, in conversations with 
senior COLMIL officials on May 14, were told that the GOC 
cannot confirm reports that one detainee is a military 
reservist.  COLMIL tells us the detainees are from Cucuta.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Twenty-two days into the Syndicated Workers Union\'s 
(\"Union Sindical Obrero,\" or USO) strike against Ecopetrol -- 
Colombia\'s state-owned oil company -- the lone issue 
remaining on the negotiation table is whether Ecopetrol will 
re-hire nearly 180 workers dismissed for their participation 
in a strike previously declared illegal by the Ministry of 
Social Protection (MSP).  The MSP decision was based on a 
1995 Constitutional Court ruling that all hydrocarbon sector 
employees perform \"essential public services\" and are 
prohibited from striking.  USO declared its \"political 
strike\" to protest the GOC\'s restructuring of Ecopetrol, 
claiming that the plan would result in the company\'s 
liquidation and hand control of Colombian oil fields to 
foreign firms.  Both USO and Ecopetrol agree that most of 
their strictly labor-related disputes were resolved well 
before USO declared the strike.  USO\'s failure to articulate 
or to achieve its objectives has severely weakened the 
union\'s public standing and its ability to keep workers from 
crossing the picket line.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2. (U) The Syndicated Workers Union\'s (\"Union Sindical 
Obrero,\" or USO) declared a \"political strike\" on April 22 to 
protest the GOC\'s restructuring of Ecopetrol, Colombia\'s 
state-owned oil company.  USO representatives told us that 
the restructuring will result in the privatization of 
Ecopetrol and a loss of Colombian control over Colombian 
natural resources.  On the same day, the Ministry of Social 
Protection (MSP) declared the strike illegal on the basis of 
a 1995 Constitutional Court ruling prohibiting hydrocarbon 
sector workers from striking on the grounds that they perform 
\"essential public services.\"  USO workers represent 
approximately one-half of Ecopetrol\'s 6,600 member work 
force.  We recently met separately with USO\'s national human 
rights director Daniel Rico Serpa, former USO human rights 
director Jose Fernando Ramirez Lozano, Ecopetrol President 
Isaac Yanovich and Minister of Mines and Energy Luis Ernesto 
Mejia to discuss ongoing negotiations and to assess the 
possibility of reaching a settlement. 
 
3. (SBU) Ecopetrol and USO entered into negotiations on a new 
labor contract under their collective bargaining agreement in 
November 2002.  Under Colombian labor law, parties have 20 
days to reach an agreement before submitting to mediation 
and, after an additional 20 days, binding arbitration. 
Colombian law requires each party to name an arbitrator.  If 
the two named arbitrators are unable mutually to agree on a 
third arbitrator, the third arbitrator is selected by the 
MSP.  In March 2003, the GOC imposed binding arbitration on 
both parties.  In September 2003, after waiting six months 
for USO to name an arbitrator (USO refused to do so), the MSP 
named an arbitrator on USO\'s behalf.  Mejia told us the 
arbitrator named was a lawyer sympathetic to the union\'s 
position with a long history of defending unions in labor 
disputes. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Labor Issues Resolved, \"Political Strike\" Declared 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (SBU) USO representatives and Yanovich both told us that 
the parties were able to resolve key labor-related points of 
disagreement in the context of binding arbitration between 
September and December 2003.  In January 2004, USO walked 
away from the negotiating table to protest the GOC\'s division 
of Ecopetrol into two entities, the original company and the 
National Hydrocarbons Agency (NHA), a regulatory agency for 
the hydrocarbon sector.  USO leaders maintained that the 
restructuring would result in Ecopetrol\'s privatization and 
eventual liquidation and would effectively hand control of 
Colombia\'s oil fields to foreign firms. 
5. (SBU) According to Mejia, the restructing permits 
Ecopetrol to compete more transparently with foreign oil 
firms by ceding Ecopetrol\'s traditional authority to 
negotiate contracts with foreign oil firms on newly 
discovered oil fields to the NHA.  Ecopetrol retains its 
financial autonomy, a government-appointed board of 
directors, and authority over all oil fields under Ecopetrol 
control as of December 31, 2003.  The plan also permits 
Ecopetrol to sell stock without ceding GOC control of the 
company.  In reaction to the GOC decree, which went into 
effect on January 1, 2004, USO publicly raised the 
possibility of a strike.  According to USO\'s Daniel Rico 
Serpa, the \"political strike\" was an attempt to raise 
consciousness among Colombians and to protect Colombian 
natural resources from being exploited by foreign oil firms. 
When asked what concessions they hoped to achieve by 
striking, neither USO representative could provide an answer. 
 
--------------------------- 
GOC Declares Strike Illegal 
--------------------------- 
 
6. (U) According to Mejia and Yanovich, the MSP repeatedly 
informed USO that the strike would be declared illegal on the 
basis of the 1995 Constitutional Court ruling.  The 
arbitrators referred the matter to the Supreme Court, which 
ruled that the union was not permitted to strike and should 
return to the negotiating table.  On April 22, USO announced 
their intent to strike.  On the same day, Minister of Social 
Protection Diego Palacios declared the strike illegal.  USO 
maintains the GOC does not have the authority to declare the 
strike illegal, citing a 1999 Supreme Court ruling that the 
GOC may not intervene in labor disputes involving state-owned 
enterprises.  Ecopetrol and the GOC hold that the ruling 
explicitly exempts enterprises whose workers provide 
essential public services.  USO and other Colombian trade 
unions also cite earlier ILO rulings declaring that petroleum 
sector workers do not provide essential public services and 
therefore may strike. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Both Ecopetrol and USO Confident, Wary 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Ecopetrol and USO perceptions of union support and 
the prospects for USO\'s success differ tremendously.  USO 
workers represent one-half of Ecopetrol\'s 6,600 member work 
force.  USO maintains that 80 percent of union members are 
participating in the strike and that Ecopetrol\'s production 
has diminished precipitously as white-collar workers and 
untrained contractors have been tapped to fill in for 
striking workers.  Yanovich told us that only 25 percent of 
Ecopetrol\'s work force is participating in the strike and 
that the company has been able to maintain its production 
levels using contractors hired from other firms under the 
company\'s contingency plan.  Yanovich also maintains that 
Ecopetrol is slowly reincorporating workers who have crossed 
the picket line. 
 
8. (SBU) USO contends that Ecopetrol is pressuring striking 
workers with the threat of being fired; that Ecopetrol 
installations in Barrancabermeja have been militarized; and 
that uniformed soldiers frequently deliver dismissal letters 
to workers\' families.  Ecopetrol states that a military 
presence is necessary to prevent vandalism and property 
damage and justifies the dismissal of nearly 180 workers, 
including USO President Gabriel Alvis and Vice President 
Hernando Hernandez, on the grounds that they had been 
informed that the strike was illegal.  On earlier occasions, 
the ILO has criticized Colombian labor laws, which give the 
GOC permission to dismiss workers for participation in an 
illegal strike.  USO leaders claim that striking workers have 
been threatened by paramilitaries and other armed actors, but 
have stopped short of alleging that paramilitaries are 
collaborating with Ecopetrol or the GOC. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Only One Issue to Resolve: Reinstatement 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Yanovich believes the company has convinced USO that 
the restructuring of Ecopetrol will not result in a loss of 
financial autonomy or production rights.  After five 
negotiation sessions over the past six days, both sides agree 
that the only issue to be resolved is whether Ecopetrol will 
re-hire dismissed USO workers.  Ecopetrol maintains that the 
workers were aware of the consequences of their actions when 
they decided to strike and refuses to offer them employment 
as direct hires.  However, Ecopetrol has indicated a 
willingness to help dismissed workers find new employment, 
possibly with some of Ecopetrol\'s external contractors. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) For the first time in USO\'s history, a strike against 
Ecopetrol has not resulted in significant declines in 
production or concessions in favor of organized labor.  The 
reasons behind USO\'s political strike were never clearly 
articulated to the public and even most USO leaders are 
unclear about the union\'s demands or objectives.  USO\'s 
obstructionist approach to all phases of negotiations with 
Ecopetrol has damaged the union\'s public credibility and 
considerably weakened the union, traditionally a giant of 
Colombian labor.

TAGS: PTER, PHUM, PGOV, PINR, PINS, SNAR, KJUS, CO, OAS, ELN Peace Process 
SUBJECT: NEXT STEPS IN PARAMILITARY PEACE PROCESS 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: On May 14, Ambassador and Peace Commissioner 
Restrepo discussed the paramilitary peace agreement.  The 
paramilitary leaders have a month to concentrate.  Restrepo 
speculated they agreed after almost destroying the talks 
because:  (1) the government had followed a consistent line 
and put forward a written, almost take-it-or-leave-it 
proposal, (2) they had been \"startled\" by recent tough public 
comments by the ambassador, (3) the elimination of Castano 
had increased their confidence they could hold together, and 
(4) they may be feeling the effects of government military 
and police efforts.  Restrepo is pleased that paramilitary 
silence after the signing has allowed the government to spin 
the agreement, but worried that the signers may be having 
second thoughts.   Paramilitary leaders remain resistant to 
concentrating their troops without a guarantee against jail 
time and extradition.  Restrepo does not expect the draft 
\"Law for Justice and Reparation,\" which provides for 
mandatory jail time, to be softened when it is considered 
during the congressional session that begins on July 20. 
Restrepo reiterated that extradition was not on the table and 
that the April 27 presidential declaration embodies GOC 
policy.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Paramilitary Change of Heart? 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Carlos Castano\'s ouster from the peace process 
reflected a hardening of the paramilitary position and a 
strengthening of the narcotics trafficking influence.  Why 
then did the ten commanders of the Central Bolivar Bloc (BCB) 
and United Self Defense Forces (AUC) agree on May 12 and 13 
to concentrate in a 400 square km zone in Cordoba (map 
emailed to WHA/AND)?  Restrepo speculated that several 
factors caused the change: 
 
-- Castano was not only a source of tension among leaders; 
they also didn\'t trust him.  With his elimination, they 
became more confident of their ability to stick together. 
From that stronger position, they could agree to Restrepo\'s 
concentration proposal. 
 
-- The Ambassador\'s public comments in Semana magazine that 
(that the ouster of Castano revealed the paras to be nothing 
more than narco-terrorists, thieves and murderers with no 
claim to being treated as political actors) startled them. 
 
-- The GOC has followed a tough, consistent line, solicited 
the May 12 meeting with the AUC/BCB and presented the written 
the concentration proposal on an almost take-it-or-leave-it 
basis.  Restrepo commented that, although they have positions 
on issues, the para leaders had no coherent negotiating game 
plan. 
 
-- Almost in passing, Restrepo also speculated that the paras 
might be feeling the effects of government military and 
police pressure.  (Interestingly, during the conversation, 
Restrepo received a call from the Minister of Defense who 
wanted to make sure that a planned operation against an 
upper-mid level para/drug dealer would not overthrow the 
peace deal at this sensitive stage; Restrepo told him to 
launch the operation.) 
 
3. (C) Restrepo said that Don Berna had eliminated four 
persons of importance to Castano that that Castano had, in 
return, killed someone close to Don Berna (presumably 
\"Danilo\").  This had precipitated the attack on Castano. 
Restrepo expressed the belief, but said he didn\'t have 
conclusive proof, that Castano was dead.  He noted that 
Castano\'s disappearance relieved the BCB, which had feared 
Castano would give information to authorities about their 
drug trafficking activities. 
 
---------- 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
4. (C) Concentration of leaders:  The first step is 
concentration of leaders and bodyguards (estimated to be 
about 25 leaders and 400 persons in all).  Restrepo said that 
there had been informal agreement that the commanders would 
concentrate within one month.  In the meantime, Restrepo will 
work with the security forces and the OAS to prepare the 
area.  The GOC must demonstrate within the first few days of 
concentration that the paramilitaries will be completely 
prohibited from any illicit activities and held accountable 
for cease-fire violations.  If not, the concentration zone 
risks becoming another FARC-like farce.  He stressed that OAS 
verification will be crucial. 
 
5. (C) Concentration/demobilization of cadre:  Restrepo would 
like to concentrate/demobilize around 5,000 paramilitaries 
before the end of the year.  Restrepo said that the 
paramilitary leaders continue to resist concentration of 
cadre until they receive written guarantees against jail time 
and extradition.  Restrepo said that he would continue to 
refuse to negotiate, in spite of repeated efforts by the 
paramilitary leaders, the draft \"Law for Justice and 
Reparation,\" which calls for mandatory jail time for anyone 
guilty of a serious, violent crime.  Congress will review the 
bill during the session that begins on July 20.  Although 
paramilitary supporters (lawyers, lobbyists, etc.) are 
seeking to soften the bill, Restrepo does not expect them to 
be successful.  Castano stressed that concentrated leaders 
would still be fully under the legal jurisdiction of Colombia 
and, if the law were passed while they were concentrated, 
they would become immediately subject to it. 
 
 
6. (C) Restrepo said that the para leaders continued to claim 
that the FARC will re-enter the areas they currently control 
if they demobilize and that they must have the freedom to 
defend those areas.  In response to the ambassador\'s 
rejection of the idea that the paras play any positive role 
and assertion that that the danger of vacuums was 
overestimated, Restrepo agreed that \"the paras are not 
necessary.\"  Restrepo has asked the para leaders for a map of 
areas they think the FARC might try to move into, both as a 
negotiating tactic and to provide information to the ministry 
of defense.  In any event, Restrepo agreed with the 
ambassador that concentration zones for cadre must be small 
enough to remove any practical operational capability from 
the paras, whether against the FARC or anyone else. 
 
------------------------ 
No Change on Extradition 
------------------------ 
 
7. (C) In response to the ambassador\'s question, Restrepo 
reaffirmed the April 27 presidential declaration that 
extradition is not on the table and assured that no 
concessions of any kind had been made in this regard.

Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Restrepo clearly is unable to completely explain the 
sudden change in direction of the para leaders; up to very 
recently he had thought that the talks were on the rocks.  If 
we had to add an element to what he told us, it would be the 
presidential declaration of April 27, which amounted to an 
ultimatum to the paras and clearly ruled our extradition and 
jail time as subjects for negotiation.  In our view, that may 
have been the key variable. 
 
9. (C) But it is also clear that the para leaders are still 
in full negotiation mode.  Getting them to actually 
concentrate will be a challenge, and getting their cadre to 
concentrate will be a bigger one.  Then getting 
demobilization will be still harder. 
 
10. (C) Embassy recommends that the Department, in its public 
statements and third-country diplomacy, emphasize the need 
for the paras to completely fulfill their promises: 
cessation of violence, concentration of leaders within a 
month, and concentration of cadre sometime after that. 
 
11. (C) Embassy also notes Restrepo\'s emphasis on the OAS 
role.  We agree.  Embassy recommends that Department work to 
ensure adequate funding and staffing for the Caramagna effort 
here.  Embassy is prepared to work closely with Washington 
agencies on the issue.

SUBJECT: Bogota Mini Dublin Group Meeting 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  The Bogota Mini Dublin Group held a biannual 
meeting on May 11 to discuss the ten recommendations for Colombia 
agreed upon in November, 2003. This session acknowledged the USG\'s 
leadership in counter-narcotics cooperation with the GOC. Several 
examples of bilateral programs were reviewed by other group 
members, including a presentation of United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC) programs that highlighted several 
important points of divergence between that group\'s objectives and 
those of the USG.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U) The Bogota Mini Dublin Group convened May 11 with the 
participation of Embassy\'s Political and Narcotics Affairs 
Sections, the UNODC, and representatives of the embassies of Spain 
(current Mini Dublin chair), UK, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, 
and Canada.   On the agenda was discussion of the ten 
recommendations from the previous Central Dublin Group meeting at 
the end of 2003. 
 
3.  (SBU) The ten recommendations discussed were: 
 
-- to continue to maintain incentives for alternative products and 
market access through generalized trade preferences and similar 
systems; 
-- to encourage the GOC to continue voluntary crop eradication 
programs by increasing the presence of the state via social 
programs to facilitate development; 
-- to increase control of terrestrial and fluvial trafficking 
routes to neighboring countries, particularly towards the 
Venezuelan border; 
-- to increase passenger and baggage control in airports; 
-- to study the creation of an airport control system for cargo 
freight similar to the port security program already in place; 
-- to facilitate the development of monitored/controlled delivery 
and undercover agents; 
-- to increase coordination between the GOC interagency community 
involved in anti-narcotics programs; 
-- to increase the presence of GOC counter-narcotics attaches in 
drug consuming countries; 
-- to encourage Colombian cooperation with neighboring countries, 
especially Venezuela, Brazil, and Ecuador; 
-- to reduce demand and consumption in Colombia as well as the 
production and trafficking of illegal narcotics; 
 
4. (SBU) Despite agreement on the importance of the above action 
recommendations, participating members had few contributions to 
offer in terms of practical programs either underway or planned. 
Discussion of ongoing programs and activities was led by Embassy 
officers. 
 
5.  (SBU) By way of underscoring policy disagreement with the 
USG\'s priorities, UNODC explained that it does not agree with the 
GOC (and the US Country Team) that manual, voluntary eradication 
should be a prerequisite to attaining alternative development 
assistance.  The UNODC also explained its philosophy that 
alternative development, rather than law enforcement, should be 
the first response in many areas where illicit crops are grown. 
 
6.  (SBU) The UNODC also noted that it was actively inviting GOC 
agencies to participate in its Integrated System for the 
Monitoring of Illicit Crops (SIMCI), ostensibly to promote 
interagency input and analysis. However, GOC participation appears 
to be composed entirely of GOC entities that are outspoken 
opponents of aerial eradication (Ministry of Environment, National 
Parks, etc.).  The influence of these groups may help explain 
SIMCI\'s insistence that illicit crop cultivation in national parks 
and indigenous reserves declined substantially in 2003, despite 
the absence of spraying, significant law enforcement dete

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) Three months ago the GOC, with SOUTHCOM assistance, 
established the Coordination Center for Integrated Action 
(CCAI).  The Center is directed by presidential adviser and 
International Assistance Coordinator Luis Alfonso Hoyos and 
is staffed by more than ten ministries and agencies.  It will 
design and direct interagency social and economic assistance 
programs in areas where the armed forces are re-establishing 
security.  Although still in its early stages, the CCAI has 
identified five target areas -- the former FARC safehaven 
(despeje) in southern Colombia, the Sierra Nevada, Catatumbo, 
Arauca Department, and Tumaco -- and begun important social 
assistance projects in some of the highly conflictive areas. 
End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Objective: Coordinated, Sustained State Presence 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (U) Recognizing that stability and state presence will not 
be established with military and police operations alone, the 
GOC created the Coordination Center for Integrated Action 
(CCAI) with SOUTHCOM assistance in early 2004.  It is staffed 
with representatives from the Office of the President, the 
Ministry of Defense, National Police, Military, Ministry of 
Interior and Justice (MOI/J), Social Solidarity Network 
(RSS), Ministry of Education, Ministry of Social Protection, 
Family Welfare Institute (ICBF), and Registrar\'s Office.  The 
Prosecutor General\'s Office (Fiscalia), Inspector General 
(Procuraduria), Human Rights Ombudsman, and other agencies 
will play an auxiliary role.  Presidential adviser and 
International Assistance Coordinator Luis Alfonso Hoyos is 
the director.  Vice Minister of Defense Andres Penate, Chief 
of the Joint Staff General Freddy Padilla, and Plan Colombia 
Director Diego Molano are on the board of directors. 
President Uribe and his cabinet are strong proponents of the 
program and have been actively involved in its creation. 
 
3. (U) The CCAI will design and implement interagency social 
and economic projects in areas that the security forces have 
secured under Uribe\'s Democratic Security Strategy.  SOUTHCOM 
provided funding for training and office space.  The CCAI has 
designated five priority areas where they have begun 
assessing the humanitarian needs and designing appropriate 
projects.  The criteria for these areas were on-going 
security operations, a traditionally limited state presence, 
strategic importance, and a heavy presence of illegal armed 
groups: 
 
-- The former despeje (Cartagena del Chaira and San Vicente 
del Caguan in Caqueta Deparment and Miraflores, Calamar, and 
La Macarena in Guaviare Department) is the focus of Plan 
Patriota Phase 2B and is FARC-dominated.  The National Police 
recently established a presence in Miraflores and Calamar. 
One assessment visit was made to Caqueta but the Guaviare 
assessment trip was cancelled for security reasons. 
 
-- Catatumbo region of Norte de Santander Department is 
traditionally dominated by the ELN but also has a FARC and 
paramilitary presence.  One assessment trip has been taken. 
 
-- Sierra Nevada region in Magdalena, Cesar, and La Guajira 
Departments has a heavy paramilitary and ELN presence and 
some FARC units.  It received widespread public attention in 
late 2003 when the ELN demanded a GOC-sponsored investigation 
into the \"humanitarian crisis\" there in exchange for 
releasing several foreign hostages.  Four assessment trips 
have been taken. 
 
-- Arauca Department was a former \"rehabilitation and 
reconciliation zone,\" where President Uribe declared a state 
of emergency and granted the police and military some 
extended powers early in his term.  The Constitutional Court 
shot down this policy several months later.  Arauca is 
contested by the FARC, paramilitaries, and, less so, the ELN. 
 The Cano Limon oil pipeline has long been an ELN and FARC 
target and the department is plagued by 
narcoterrorist-related corruption and violence.  U.S. Special 
Forces help train the 18th Brigade, which is headquarted 
there. 
 
-- Tumaco, Narino Department is on the Pacific Coast and a 
FARC-dominated haven for drug trafficking. 
 
-------------- 
Early Progress 
-------------- 
 
4. (U) Working in coordination, the CCAI has begun key 
projects: 
 
-- Resource allocation: The RSS has budgeted approximately 
USD 24,000 to the Sierra Nevada, USD 54,000 to Catatumbo, USD 
131,000 to San Vicente del Caguan, and USD 296,000 to 
Cartagena del Chaira for reconstruction programs.  The Social 
Protection Ministry has allocated USD 123,000 for the Sierra 
Nevada and USD 106,000 for Caqueta Department. 
 
-- Return of Displaced families: 49 families have been 
returned to Catatumbo, 350 to La Guajira, and 36 to Cesar. 
 
-- Infrastructure: Renovation of six roads, two bridges, and 
several schools and hospitals has begun in the Sierra Nevada. 
 Four roads, a water treatment plant, and health clinic are 
being built in Catatumbo.  Four community housing centers are 
planned for Catatumbo. 
 
-- Health: 750 people have been vaccinated in the Sierra 
Nevada. 
 
-- Documentation: 149 people in Magdalena Department have 
received identification cards. 
 
-- Education: 190 new school spaces will be created in 
Catatumbo. 
 
5. (C) Establishing a state presence in newly secured areas 
is central to making the security forces\' successes 
permanent.  The CCAI will play an important role in ensuring 
that state services are provided in a well-coordinated 
manner.  Although it was only created three months ago, the 
CCAI already has begun showing results.

SUBJECT: LEGAL AUTHORITY FOR USG SUPPORT TO DEMOBILIZATION 
PROCESS 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons 1.5 (b) 
and (d). 
 
1.  (C) This is an Action Request:  Embassy Bogota requests 
that the Department urgently work with both DOJ and USAID to 
resolve legal ambiguities that inhibit our ability to support 
aspects of desertion and demobilization programs in Colombia. 
 In particular, we need a ruling on whether, and when, 
program assistance can be provided to a former member of a 
designated FTO who has voluntarily left the organization, is 
cooperating against it, and is participating in a program of 
peaceful re-insertion.  We also need clarification of our 
ability to provide assistance to peace verification programs 
(although these do not provide assistance to ex-combatants). 
 
2.  (C) This issue has been pending for some time.  President 
Uribe raised it with Secretary Powell in March, although the 
question pre-dates last February\'s inter-agency 
demobilization team visit by more than six months.  Recently, 
the issue took a step backward when the office of the AID 
General Counsel informed the embassy that it could \"express 
no opinion on the legality... of assisting child 
ex-combatants\" because \"the legality of the USG assisting 
former members of the AUC, a designated foreign terrorist 
organization, under the AUC reintegration program is being 
considered by the Department of Justice and to date no 
opinion has been forthcoming.\"  In short, not only do we have 
no permission to provide assistance to motivate and support 
deserters or other voluntary demobilizations, but we no 
longer even have a clear picture on our long-standing 
assistance to ex-child soldiers. 
 
3.  (C) The issue became more urgent with the signing two 
weeks ago of a concentration agreement between the 
paramilitary leaders and the government.  Although we don\'t 
know where this will end up, the government hopes to 
concentrate and begin demobilizing an additional 5,000 
paramilitaries before the end of the year, in addition to the 
4,000 or so deserters who presently are languishing at great 
expense in government-provided housing. 
 
4.  (C) Government preparations for concentration and 
demobilization have improved, but are still not where they 
should be.  During the February inter-agency visit, the 
government provided its demobilization and reincorporation 
plan, which has since been refined.  We would like to do 
more, not only in the planning, but also in the 
implementation phase. 
 
5.  (C) We understand that this is a tough question.  But, as 
we understand it, because there has been no formal FTO 
designation in the case of the Baath party or the Republican 
National Guard, the Taliban, the RUF, and certain Mideast 
organizations, Colombia must be the test case.  We completely 
support the FTO designations of the FARC, ELN, and AUC in 
Colombia.  The current legal uncertainty acts, however, not 
as a constraint on terrorists, but on the ability of the U.S. 
to pursue anti-terror polices in Colombia:  to motivate 
desertions and demobilizations (with concurrent provision of 
first-rate intelligence on terror groups), to meet genuine 
humanitarian needs of child soldiers and the families of 
deserters and the demobilized, and to build a structure that 
can lead to reinsertion and a return to legitimate life for 
those involved in the conflict who want to find an 
alternative.  By impeding demobilization, we are also 
impeding application of the draft law on justice and 
compensation, which the U.S. largely supports, and which 
provides for incarceration of and restitution by those guilty 
of serious violent crimes. 
 
6.  (C) A related question is our ability to assist in the 
monitoring of compliance with concentration and 
demobilization.  On this, the USAID General Counsel said 
that: &monitoring of these types of programs to ensure that 
ex-combatants do not return to terrorist activity raises 
serious questions as well.\"  The OAS verification mission 
needs, and deserves our support.

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.4 (b)

1. (S/NF) In January 2004, Colombian military officials 
provided Army Commander Major General Carreno with evidence 
that five officers from Army Regional Intelligence Center 5 
(RIME-5), including its commander, were collaborating with 
paramilitary groups.  The officers were suspected of sharing 
intelligence, coordinating operations, and providing supplies 
to paramilitary elements in the Army 5th Division\'s area of 
operations, which includes Bogota and the surrounding 
department of Cundinamarca.  According to DAO reporting, 
Carreno considered the evidence, which came from a former 
Army officer working with the paramilitaries, credible enough 
to order the five officers\' immediate transfer to other units 
in March 2004. 
 
2.  (S/NF) Embassy approached the Minister of Defense on this 
issue asking that a more careful investigation be carried out 
and more definitive action than mere transferal be taken.  On 
May 20, Minister of Defense Uribe told Ambassador that, after 
further investigation, he had used his discretionary 
authority -- which does not require formal explanation or 
justification -- to order the dismissal of all five officers. 
 Vice-Minister of Defense Andres Penate told PolCouns on May 
21 that the administrative outprocessing of the officers will 
take approximately three weeks.  Embassy will continue to 
monitor the case and follow-up as appropriate.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) In its negotiations with the paramilitaries the Uribe 
administration has avoided several mistakes the Pastrana 
administration committed during its fruitless peace process 
with the FARC.  In contrast to talks with the FARC, the Uribe 
government has used public commentary sparingly and 
effectively, will maintain state control over concentration 
zones and limit their size, and will set concentration and 
demobilization deadlines.  As paramilitary commanders and 
their bodyguards concentrate, the Peace Commissioner\'s 
Office, OAS Verification Commission, and security forces say 
they will focus on holding paramilitaries to the terms of 
their agreements, ensuring permanent state control over 
concentration zones, and moving forward with demobilization. 
Focusing on these priorities should prevent the paramilitary 
peace process from degenerating into a fiasco reminiscent of 
the Pastrana administration\'s \"Caguan\" process with the FARC. 
 End Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
Discretional Public Statements 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) The GOC prohibits public comments about internal 
negotiations.  The May 13 agreement specifically states that 
neither the paramilitaries, GOC, or OAS verification mission 
will publicly disclose anything discussed during 
negotiations.  This policy of confidentiality has prevented 
the paramilitary peace process from degenerating into the 
media circus that characterized the Pastrana administration\'s 
\"Caguan\" talks with the FARC. 
 
-------------------------- 
State Control and Security 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (C) According to the May 13 agreement, the zone in Cordoba 
Department where the ten key paramilitary commanders and 
their bodyguards will concentrate is less than 150 square 
miles.  It will have a permanent presence of representatives 
from the OAS and Peace Commissioner\'s Office and should be 
small enough to permit effective state control.  Restrepo has 
recently floated the idea of a slight reduction in the zone\'s 
size.  It will be surrounded by a cordon of security forces 
who will control access to the area.  Paramilitary commanders 
concentrated there will be held accountable for their troops\' 
actions outside the zone.  Restrepo has told the Ambassador 
that any future concentration/demobilization zones for 
paramilitary troops must be small enough to ensure full state 
control.  According to OAS representative Sergio Caramagna, 
the GOC hopes to create five to seven concentration zones 
totaling no more than 460 square miles.  In contrast, the 
FARC\'s safehaven (\"despeje\") in Caqueta and Meta departments 
was 16,200 square miles (roughly the size of Switzerland) and 
had no state presence. 
 
--------- 
An Agenda 
--------- 
 
4. (C) The GOC is pushing paramilitary commanders to 
concentrate in one month, and expects the concentration 
period to last six months.  These deadlines, although 
flexible, should help to prevent talks from continuing 
indefinitely without concrete progress.  The GOC will need to 
work quickly to define and agree on a demobilization 
schedule, which the paramilitaries have been avoiding. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Expected Next Steps and Clarifications 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) In the next month: 
-- Logistics: The Peace Commissioner\'s Office will prepare 
the zone for a permanent GOC presence.  Paramilitary leaders 
will be responsible for their own food and shelter. 
 
-- Verification: The OAS is developing a detailed budget 
plan.  Caramagna tentatively expects to spend approximately 
USD 500,000 for offices in Bogota, Medellin, and Monteria, 
capital of Cordoba.  He hopes to expand his two-person team 
to seven international employees and several local hires (see 
septel for the possibility of U.S. support for the OAS 
mission). 
 
-- Security: The Peace Commissioner\'s Office will coordinate 
with the Colombian Armed Forces to create a security cordon 
around the zone. 
 
During the six month concentration period: 
 
-- Regulation: Delegates from the Peace Commissioner\'s 
Office, paramilitaries, and OAS will form a Security and 
Co-existence Committee, which will regulate the zone and 
manage communications and visits.  Local government officials 
and Catholic Church representatives will have an open 
invitation to serve as guest members of the Committee.  The 
Peace Commissioner\'s Office must authorize any paramilitary 
leader\'s departure from the zone.  The agreement has left 
ambiguous how often and for how long commanders will be 
permitted to leave the zone to \"conduct activities related to 
the peace process\" and how many commanders may be outside the 
zone at any given time.  This needs to be clarified. 
 
-- Verification: Assuming funding is available, the OAS 
mission will verify that all parties are fulfilling the 
agreement and maintain an inventory of all weapons possessed 
by the concentrated paramilitaries.  Paramilitary leaders and 
their security details will be allowed to carry arms but 
cannot transport any weapons in or out of the zone. 
Delegates from the Peace Commissioner\'s Office, 
paramilitaries, and OAS will form a Verification Committee 
that will receive complaints about violations of the 
cease-fire nationwide and help the OAS verify the agreement. 
Restrepo has repeatedly asserted that individuals who violate 
the agreement and/or the cease-fire must be punished. 
 
-- Security: The concentration zone is in 
paramilitary-dominated territory.  The security forces will 
be responsible for preventing any other illegal armed group 
from making incursions into the area.  More importantly, the 
security forces will seal off unauthorized access routes to 
the zone and conduct robust intelligence operations to record 
violations. 
 
Post Concentration: 
 
-- Demobilization: Restrepo hopes to concentrate/demobilize 
5,000 paramilitaries this year.  So far, paramilitary 
commanders have refused to do so until they receive 
guarantees against prison and extradition.  Restrepo intends 
to press the paramilitaries to commit to and follow a 
detailed demobilization schedule. 
 
-- Verification: As more concentration/demobilization zones 
are created, the OAS will have to rapidly expand its 
operation in order to monitor these areas. 
 
-- Security: The paramilitaries have warned that the FARC 
will move into areas where paramilitaries currently have a 
presence if the paramilitaries demobilize.  Restrepo states, 
however, that the paramilitaries are not necessary or wanted 
by the local population (reftel). 
 
-- Legal processes: The \"Law of Justice and Reparation\" will 
not be considered until the next session of Congress, which 
begins on July 20.  The GOC has repeatedly assured us that 
the peace process will not raise legal impediments to 
extradition.

1. (C) Summary:  Officials and residents of Cesar Department 
praise President Uribe\'s security improvements.  The cities 
and highways of Cesar\'s central valley are far safer than 
they were a year ago, and the economy has grown slightly. 
However, guerrillas and paramilitaries find refuge in the 
highlands, and contraband and outlaws still cross an open 
border with Venezuela.  The indigenous occasionally 
accommodate the FARC in the highlands.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2. (U) Cesar and its capital, Valledupar, occupy a valley in 
the North of Colombia.  Cattle and coal mining dominate the 
economy.  Paramilitaries move contraband fuel from Venezuela 
through the Department. 
 
3. (C) Cesar has suffered in recent decades from depredations 
of guerrillas, paramilitaries, and common criminals driving 
people into Valledupar and other cities.  Internally 
displaced persons comprise roughly ten percent of 
Valledupar\'s population of 400,000. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
The Valley is Secure, but not the Highlands 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) President Uribe\'s Democratic Security Policy has 
brought the lowlands of Cesar under governmental control and 
opened the corridor to neighboring departments.  Highways are 
now relatively free from illegal roadblocks and kidnappings. 
The FARC\'s 19th Front operates from base camps in the Sierra 
Nevada range.  The 41st Front can regroup and resupply in 
Venezuela, according to military and intelligence officials. 
The Army aims to cut the FARC\'s and paramilitaries\' access to 
the valley by attacking them in the foothills.  Guerrillas 
and paramilitaries are feeling the pinch of these military 
operations, but are still active though at reduced levels. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Crime Down; Legitimate Activity Up 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Crime in Cesar decreased significantly in the first 
four months of 2004 in comparison with the same period in 
2003.  Kidnappings and murders dropped by 73 and 17 percent, 
respectively.  Marijuana and cocaine seizures more than 
doubled during the same period.  The arrest rate for all 
crimes rose by 19 percent.  The number of guerrillas captured 
rose by 1000 percent, and paramilitaries by 1400 percent. 
National Police (CNP) Commander Orlando Pineda pointed to the 
significant rise in paramilitary arrests as evidence that the 
police do not favor them. 
 
6. (C) Under \"Plan Coverage,\" which assigns police to 
formerly unprotected zones, the CNP has deployed small 
detachments of officers to 25 small towns.  Police encourage 
crime reporting through community organizations.  The CNP\'s 
Pineda noted that rapid response to crime reports was key to 
winning citizen cooperation.  He said that most of the police 
were from Cesar.  Department of Administrative Security (DAS; 
FBI equivalent) officers agreed that the police program was 
working well in the small towns. 
 
7. (C) Cattlemen are less subject to kidnapping and 
extortion, and landowners can once again visit their 
properties.  With GOC support, some 110,000 new acres of 
cotton will be planted (Cesar was once a major cotton 
producer).  Coal extraction at U.S.-owned Drummond Industries 
is at record levels.  The Army established a training center 
near Drummond, and units protect the company\'s rail line from 
attacks by the FARC and ELN.  Drummond VP Alfredo Araujo said 
there had been no attacks for a year. 
 
--------------------- 
Uribe Gets the Credit 
--------------------- 
 
8. (C) Given improvements to security and the economy, 
support for Uribe\'s Democratic Security Policy is near 
unanimous in Cesar.  Local opinion makers said that these 
improvements have consolidated support for Uribe.  That said, 
Congressmen Alfredo Cuello and Jorge Ramirez both opined that 
the bill to permit reelection would have a tough time in the 
House of Representatives. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Indigenous Colombians Remain Vulnerable 
--------------------------------------- 
9. (C) Valledupar Mayor Ciro Pupo described the region\'s 
indigenous population as abandoned.  Col. Juan Carlos 
Figueroa, Commander of the Valledupar Army battalion, said 
that the lack of state presence in the highlands of Santa 
Marta had led the indigenous groups to develop long-standing 
accommodations with the FARC.  Col. Figueroa said that 
paramilitaries murdered 14 indigenous last year, but the GOC 
Vice President\'s Office put the figure at 43 for the first 
nine months of 2003.  The VP\'s report also noted recruitment 
of young people as guides for armed groups fighting in the 
highlands. 
 
----------------- 
Governor\'s Vision 
----------------- 
 
10. (C) Governor Hernando Molina Araujo is seeking to 
encourage the GOC\'s Solidarity Network to provide assistance 
to small businesses and farms, including for coffee and 
cocoa, to promote resettling the highlands as they become 
more secure.  The goal is to integrate poor and marginal 
populations into the local economy and civil society.  He 
said that resentment toward the failings of the state was a 
major factor in leading disaffected youth to join the illegal 
armed groups.  Col. Figueroa cited the large landholdings in 
the region as a factor in negative attitudes toward the 
state.  A handful of politically powerful families -- notably 
the Araujo clan, from which the governor hails -- control 
these landholdings (reftel).

SUBJECT: BOGOTA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY FUND PROPOSAL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 65803 
 
1. Background: Colombia remains embroiled in a prolonged 
internal armed conflict now involving three major 
narcotics-funded terrorist organizations.  The conflict has 
fueled thousands of violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law by the illegal armed groups 
and has led to a serious deterioration in the rule of law, 
particularly in the countryside.  A key USG goal in Colombia 
is to strengthen Colombian democracy\'s capacity to 
successfully confront human rights violations.  For example, 
human rights training for Colombian security forces has 
resulted in dramatic improvements.  Another important need is 
to strengthen the ability of the justice system and civil 
society to understand and apply basic principles of 
international humanitarian law (IHL). 
 
2. Purpose: Colombia has adopted many laws intended to 
protect IHL norms and prosecute their violations.  The Penal 
Code (Law 599) of 2000 specifies 30 crimes as IHL violations, 
the Military Penal Code of 1997 excludes from military penal 
jurisdiction several IHL violations, and the Uniform 
Disciplinary Code (Law 734) of 2002 makes reference to many 
IHL norms.  The effectiveness of these laws, however, depends 
on government authorities\' understanding of what constitute 
IHL violations, according to both statutes and relevant 
judicial decisions.  Unfortunately, such key information is 
not readily accessible in Colombia.  For example, much 
important material on IHL norms and case studies is available 
only in English and French, there are obstacles to accessing 
relevant information from specialized internet sites, and 
other information is unavailable because of its length or 
cost. 
 
3.  Method: This project proposes the construction of a 
publicly accessible electronic database of international IHL 
jurisprudence that would include, for example, Spanish 
translations of verdicts of international tribunals and 
courts in cases involving IHL violations that mirror crimes 
occurring in Colombia.  The database would include analyses 
of such cases demonstrating how national and international 
law was applied in each case, how judicial authorities worked 
through the relevant facts and law, and how academics and 
other experts judged the process and ruling. 
 
4.  The project\'s first six months would be spent 
establishing the database with the technical support of 
LEGIS, a Latin American equivalent of Westlaw that operates 
in six countries and has been compiling legal databases since 
1952.  The process would include selection and 
standardization of consultation sources, establishment of 
criteria for searches and translation of relevant materials, 
and analysis of pertinent jurisprudence.  The database would 
include information and cases from tribunals such as those 
addressing IHL violations in Yugoslavia, Rwanda, East Timor, 
and Sierra Leone.  At the close of the first phase, project 
implementers would produce a pilot publication aimed at 
judicial officials that would provide an index of the 
database and explain its contents.  The project\'s second 
phase would consist of a quantitative and qualitative 
amplification of the database with a system for regular 
updates. 
 
5. Results: Access to this information will benefit 
Colombians working on IHL cases, including judges in 
specialized, circuit, and superior courts; judges and staff 
of the military justice system; national and regional human 
rights prosecutors; criminal and disciplinary investigators, 
judicial police; and human rights attorneys, law students, 
human rights and humanitarian workers. 
 
6. Implementing Organization:  The project will be run by the 
Institute for Human Rights and International Relations at 
Javeriana University in Bogota. 
 
7. Budget:  The project budget is estimated at USD 15,000, 
which will cover the initial 6-month phase.  The funds will 
finance the salaries of the director and his assistant (both 
bilingual lawyers) and an expert in legal English, as well as 
the initial pilot publication.

SUBJECT: Update on Eradication in Colombian National Parks 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: In an effort to dispel misinformation 
about the aerial eradication program and illicit coca 
cultivation in national parks, the Colombian National Police 
(CNP) recently hosted two over-flights of affected parks. 
Participants, including key legislators, opinion leaders, 
and the media, gained a clearer appreciation for both the 
extent of illicit coca cultivation in protected areas and 
the potential for aerial eradication to reverse the 
resultant damage.  End Summary. 
 
Background 
------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) On March 30, 2004, Colombian Senator Jorge Robledo 
publicly attacked the joint USG-GOC narcotics eradication 
program, singling out plans to spray within national parks 
as an unacceptable assault on Colombia\'s patrimony. 
Robledo\'s charges, which were rife with misinformation, were 
not immediately refuted by GOC leaders.  NGOs opposed to 
spraying in national parks lobbied the Minister of 
Environment, Housing, and Territorial Development who 
subsequently announced that there would be no spraying in 
national parks until manual eradication had been tested as 
an alternative to aerial eradication.  Some Government 
officials also played-down the extent and impact of illicit 
cultivation within the Natural Parks, further undermining 
public support for spraying in parks. 
 
Getting the Facts Out 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Working with Embassy PAS, NAS organized and 
supported park inspections for key members of the Colombian 
Congress and other opinion leaders.   The over-flights of 
Tayrona National Park (Magdelena Department) on April 17 and 
Serrana de la Macarena National Park (Meta Department) on 
May 15 were hosted by the CNP. 
 
4. (SBU) When weather prevented flying over an area in a 
national park known to be under coca cultivation, the flight 
went to another part of the park and came across a 
previously unknown 700 hectare coca farm.  Press coverage of 
the events was extensive and universally favorable.  The 
consensus among members of the Colombian congress and 
others, including most of those not previously supportive of 
aerial eradication, was that the incursion of coca 
cultivation into national parks was so extensive that it 
could only be reversed through aerial eradication.  One key 
legislator, Senator Juan Gmez Martnez, announced plans to 
convene a public hearing on June 1 to denounce the GOC\'s de 
facto abandonment of the parks and to demand that the 
government take the necessary steps to halt further 
encroachment in these and other protected areas.

SUBJECT: GOC ORDERED TO COMPENSATE FAMILIES OF VICTIMS OF 
SANTO DOMINGO BOMBING 
 
1. On May 25, the Administrative Tribunal of Arauca 
department ordered the Government of Colombia to pay 2 
billion pesos (approximately USD 770,000) to the families of 
17 persons killed in an Air Force bombing of the village of 
Santo Domingo, Arauca department, in December 1998.  The 
Tribunal ruled against compensating the family of an 18th 
alleged victim because of insufficient proof that the 
individual died in the bombing.  Fifty-five relatives of the 
17 confirmed victims will be compensated monetarily, the 
amount depending on how each relative was affected by the 
bombing.  Wilson Arcila, president of the tribunal, said the 
decision was based on evidence (including an FBI report) that 
the pilot of the helicopter allegedly responsible for the 
bombing authorized the attack despite knowing civilians were 
present in the village. 
 
2. The decision in the civil case comes five months after the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\") charged the 
helicopter pilot, co-pilot, and navigator with involuntary 
manslaughter.  The three now face trial in civilian court. 
Embassy will continue to monitor progress in the criminal 
case and inquire about the impact of the administrative 
tribunal\'s ruling.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Foreign Minister Carolina Barco and Minister of 
Defense Jorge Uribe briefed foreign diplomats on individual 
demobilization, hometown soldiers, and the informants 
network.  The event was a review of accomplishments that 
highlighted the GOC\'s successes and downplayed its 
challenges.  Minister Uribe brought three former members of 
the FARC to discuss their experiences in the demobilization 
and reinsertion process.  Although the presentation offered 
little new information, several audience members seemed to be 
hearing the information for the first time.  All speakers 
thanked the international community for ongoing support.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Individual Demobilization on the Rise 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On August 25, Foreign Minister Carolina Barco and 
Minister of Defense (MOD) Jorge Alberto Uribe addressed 
roughly sixty members of the diplomatic corps to outline 
progress on the government\'s individual demobilization 
program, informants network, and hometown soldiers (\"soldados 
de mi pueblo\") initiative.  President Uribe had asked the MOD 
to brief diplomatic officials to increase their understanding 
of the programs and foster further international cooperation. 
 The presentation lasted roughly two and a half hours. 
 
3. (U) Vice Minister of Defense Andres Penate discussed 
statistics on individual demobilization.  In the first two 
years of the Uribe Administration, 5,114 individuals had 
voluntarily demobilized and entered the reinsertion program. 
Penate said although individual demobilization began under 
the Pastrana Administration, participation had been much 
lower before 2003.  Under Uribe, the program has averaged 
over 300 demobilizations per month, due in large part to the 
GOC\'s public announcements, commercials, and other appeals to 
illegal armed groups\' rank and file members. 
 
4. (SBU) Of the 5,114 persons who have applied for 
demobilization assistance, the GOC has denied benefits to 350 
because it found that either (1) they were not real members 
of an illegal armed group or (2) they were real members who 
had committed human rights violations.   Such information is 
usually uncovered during the interrogation phase of 
demobilization.  Penate stressed that information gathered 
during initial interrogations has proven useful for 
understanding groups\' psychology and leaders\' whereabouts. 
He said there had only been six cases of alleged abuse during 
processing.  Eighty percent of demobilizing fighters 
surrender to the Colombian Army in the area of operations and 
twenty percent are minors (under eighteen). 
 
----------------------------------- 
Reincorporation Has First Graduates 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Juan David Angel, Director of the GOC\'s 
Reincorporation Program, highlighted the program\'s successes 
and noted that its first \"graduates\" were just beginning to 
leave the two-year program.  He added the GOC was grappling 
with interagency coordination issues, public resistance to 
the newly reincorporated citizens, and a lack of private 
sector engagement in the program.  His office brought three 
demobilized FARC fighters to address the audience at the 
meeting\'s conclusion. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Hometown Soldiers and Informants Programs Expand 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6. (U) Brigadier General Lesmez praised the \"hometown\" 
soldiers program and showed a brief promotional video.  He 
noted that hometown soldiers are regular soldiers who receive 
the same training, equipment, and salaries as other soldiers, 
but serve in their own hometowns.  The GOC hopes to have 
almost 23,000 hometown soldiers deployed by the end of 2004 
and almost 30,000 by the end of 2005.  Lesmez said the 
program helps bring law and order back to the rural areas. 
 
7. (SBU) Police General Alberto Ruiz Garcia spoke about the 
national informants network and the program\'s successes over 
the last year.  He distinguished between community watch 
volunteers and informants by noting that informants are paid 
for their information.  Both groups receive training and 
radios to report any suspicious activity or crimes.  The GOC 
claims almost four million volunteers and paid informants who 
report to the police, army and navy.  Almost two thirds are 
unpaid volunteers.  There are roughly three million in the 
cities, 53,000 in rural areas, and 7,000 protecting major 
roadways.  Minister Uribe said the GOC hopes to have five 
million participants by 2006. 
 
8. (SBU) MOD Uribe closed by thanking the international 
community for its cooperation.  He encouraged audience 
members to question the former FARC members about their 
experience in the program and reasons for leaving the FARC. 
Juan David Angel told Emboffs that the British Ambassador 
wholeheartedly supported the presence of the three and 
suggested that the GOC hold future events with ex-fighters. 
He also promised to hold another meeting to discuss mass 
demobilization issues and other related programs.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.    (C) On August 30, the Inspector General\'s Office 
(Procuraduria) announced that it had closed the disciplinary 
investigation into the March 19 Army-Police clash in 
Guaitarilla, Narino Department.  According to the televised 
announcement, the Procuraduria will press charges for alleged 
negligence and official misconduct against the Director of 
Operations in the Police \"GAULA\" Unit (a special 
anti-kidnapping and anti-extortion unit) and four other 
officials.  In an unrelated incident on August 31, Police and 
Army units shot at each other again, this time in the 
outskirts of Bucaramanga, Santander Department, killing two 
police officers.  It is not yet clear what caused the latest 
incident.  End Summary. 
 
Guaitarilla Background 
---------------------- 
 
2.    (C) During an official disciplinary investigation of 
the March 19 Army-Police clash near Guaitarilla, Narino 
Department, the Procuraduria uncovered evidence and received 
testimonies showing that the seven police and four civilians 
killed were involved in a cocaine deal gone awry.  They have 
not yet made a decision about Army participation.  Initially, 
Police Commander Libio German Castillo, who was in charge of 
the unit, said the police and civilian victims had been 
involved in an operation against a gang of criminals when 
they were killed.  One source speculated that the Army was 
called in to attack Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC) elements in the area and ended up in a friendly-fire 
incident with the police instead. 
 
 
IG Files Charges Against Police Officials 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU)    The Procuraduria is filing misconduct charges 
against police officials involved in the incident and is 
still investigating the army\'s involvement.  Their charges 
against the police are for dereliction of duty and abuse of 
authority.  The following officials have been formally 
charged: Ltc. Humberto Guaitbonza Carreno, Deputy Director of 
the National GUALA Unit, Ltc. Jorge Enrique Baron Blanco, 
Operating Commander of the Narino Police, Captain John Jamie 
Yepes Mejia, Commander of the Narino GAULA, Captain Libio 
German Castillo Villarreal, Commander of the Narino SIJIN 
(local police investigative unit), Superintendent Javier 
Alberto Alfaro Otero, Carlos Americo Chavez Loaiza, and 
Eduardo Rodrigo Huertas, Julio Cesar Hernandez Moreno, Arley 
Antonio Garcia Sicaronni, and Wilson Salet Bernal Villada of 
the National Police\'s Pasto detachment.  The Prosecutor 
General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\") will continue its separate 
criminal investigation. 
 
4. (C) On August 25, Deputy Inspector General Carlos Arturo 
Gomez met with Emboffs to discuss Guaitarilla, Cajamarca, and 
other high-profile disciplinary investigations.  Gomez noted 
that the Guaitarilla case probably involved mass corruption 
and individuals hiding or tampering with evidence.  He added 
that autopsies of those involved that night indicated they 
had been abused, contradicting official accounts.  He 
stressed that, despite overwhelming evidence of drug 
involvement and official misconduct, those involved would 
receive little more than a slap on the wrist.  For example, 
the Procuraduria could only issue disciplinary suspensions, 
and the Fiscalia had mentioned to Gomez that criminal 
convictions could be difficult given the problems with the 
evidence.  Gomez told Emboffs that although a Fiscalia 
official had been present during all evidence collection, 
most evidence was still tainted before analysis, suggesting 
that Fiscalia employees were complicit in the cover-up. 
 
Second Police-Army Gunfight 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (S)  On August 31, a second Police-Army incident occurred 
when an Army GAULA unit opened fire on SIJIN officers in the 
rural outskirts of Bucaramanga, Santander Department, killing 
two police officers.  While the SIJIN agents were allegedly 
wearing vests with bright yellow \"SIJIN\" letters on the front 
and back, the initial GAULA report to Army headquarters 
claimed the SIJIN agents fired first. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) Those involved in the Guaitarilla incident, whether 
Army or Police, have refused to take polygraphs or discuss 
the incident publicly despite the MOD\'s public announcement 
that he wanted them to submit to polygraph exams.  Ongoing 
revelations about the case have the potential to undermine 
the Minster of Defense\'s credibility and damage the 
military\'s public image.  The latest incident near 
Bucaramanga will only aggravate already tense relations 
between the Army and Police.  End comment.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (S//NF) August 13, 2004 marked the 18-month anniversary of 
the FARC\'s kidnapping of three American crewmembers after a 
SOUTHCOM single-engine Cessna crashed.  The most significant 
change since the one-year update in reftel (NOTAL) has been 
the initiation and impressive progress of the COLMIL\'s Plan 
Patriota Phase IIB, which targets FARC strongholds in 
southeastern Colombia.  Given the operations, progress, it 
is possible that the FARC moved the hostages into a less 
volatile area, such as the Correguaje region, where the FARC 
has well-developed hostage camp infrastructure.  Although 
Embassy has not received any proof-of-life since July 2003, 
we assess that the hostages are still alive given their high 
value.  Sources indicate, however, that the FARC would kill 
the hostages rather than allow a rescue.  Embassy continues 
to hold biweekly interagency meetings to discuss the status, 
strategize and consider new leads.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2. (S//NF) August 13, 2004, marked 18 months of captivity for 
Thomas R. Howes, Marc D. Gonsalves, and Keith D. Stansell, 
whose SOUTHCOM Reconnaissance System single engine Cessna 208 
Caravan aircraft crashed in northern Caqueta Department.  Two 
other members of the crew -- U.S. citizen Tom Jannis and 
Colombian Army Sergeant Luis Cruz -- were executed shortly 
after the crash when they apparently refused to follow FARC 
orders to move quickly out of the area.  Their bodies were 
found about a mile from the crash site.  The FARC took 24 
days to bring the three surviving American citizens to the 
first holding encampment. 
 
------------------------- 
STATUS AT EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
------------------------- 
 
3. (S//NF) Since our one-year assessment, the COLMIL has 
begun a major military offensive in the Yari region known as 
Plan Patriota Phase IIB (PPIIB).  The offensive has made 
serious inroads into FARC strongholds, which may have 
prompted the FARC to move the hostages to a more secure area. 
 A recent source claims the hostages are now located in the 
remote, mountainous Correguaje region of northern Caqueta and 
western Meta Departments.  This region is near well-developed 
FARC hostage camp infrastructure and lies outside the PPIIB 
area of operations.  Post is following up on all leads, but 
we do not have credible, precise information on the hostages\' 
location. 
 
4. (S//NF) While the hostages are susceptible to a variety of 
jungle maladies, on balance we believe that they receive 
medical treatment and adequate food given their value to the 
FARC.  At the same time, FARC leadership has made it clear 
that, as they have in other situations, they it would kill 
the hostages rather than permit a successful rescue.  We 
believe the FARC would first attempt to move them and only 
execute them as a last resort.  Due to ongoing PPIIB 
operations, it is possible the FARC could use the hostages as 
\"human shields\" against COLMIL incursions into FARC 
strongholds. 
 
5. (S//NF) The Embassy continues to collect all available 
intelligence related to hostage locations and has implemented 
a \"Rewards for Justice\" program for information leading to 
their safe return.  This program has recently generated 
additional leads due to new ads placed in newspapers and on 
the radio outside Bogota.  In addition, the MilGroup\'s 
Regional Information Support Team (RIST) provided 75,000 
leaflets for dissemination around the areas of Larandia, San 
Vicente del Caguan, and Florencia on July 9.  These programs 
have been successful in spurring walk-ins but so far have not 
yielded verifiable information on the hostages\' whereabouts. 
We hold hostage status meetings biweekly with representatives 
from the Embassy Intelligence Fusion Center, U.S. MilGroup, 
the Office of Regional Affairs, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, the Narcotics Affairs Section and the 
Executive Office.  Nevertheless, since leads go stale in a 
matter of hours, any rescue mission would have to be launched 
with U.S. forces based in Colombia and briefed to respond. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
FARC STRATEGY MURKY; COLMIL INCAPABLE OF HOSTAGE RESCUE 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
6. (S//NF) The FARC may consider the hostages to be a 
bargaining chip with President Uribe in negotiating a trade 
of political hostages for imprisoned FARC commanders and 
troops.  One intelligence report mentioned that some FARC 
elements are lobbying to release the U.S. hostages to 
embarrass the GOC and diminish U.S. support for Colombian 
anti-terrorism efforts.  Unfortunately, an unconditional 
hostage release by the FARC is highly unlikely; in the past 
they have always sought a quid pro quo. 
 
7. (S//NF) Based on our analysis of the Colombian Military\'s 
training, equipment and tactics, the Colombian military is 
not capable of conducting a hostage rescue operation without 
endangering the lives of the hostages.  President Uribe has 
told us he would allow a unilateral U.S. effort to release 
the hostages, and we believe the security forces -- with some 
ruffled feathers -- would accept his decision to do so.  It 
is clear, however, given the likely remote location of the 
hostages when, and if a rescue is attempted by U.S. forces 
that some involvement of Colombian military is inevitable. 
The degree to which we can count on COLMIL participation will 
depend on the nature of our cooperation and our relationship 
with the COLMIL rescue units. 
 
-------------------------- 
COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST 
-------------------------- 
 
8. (S//NF) The hostages, fate remains uncertain despite the 
recent GOC proposal to release 50 imprisoned FARC members in 
exchange for political and military hostages, including the 
three Americans.  President Uribe has made it clear that any 
humanitarian exchange must include the three American 
hostages.  The FARC rejected the GOC proposal in an August 22 
communique.  The FARC continues to press for an unconditional 
exchange of jailed terrorists for kidnap victims that the GOC 
cannot accept.  The FARC does not/not explicitly include the 
Americans in their proposals. 
 
9. (S//NF) The limited intelligence we get on the hostages 
seems to have a short life.  We believe they are moved 
frequently, so intelligence on their whereabouts would be of 
limited value unless we could react instantly.  Consequently, 
Post recommends that preparations begin for a U.S.-led 
operation that could act on intelligence quickly.  Post also 
recommends identifying U.S. units that would take the lead in 
any rescue operation so we can begin familiarizing them with

Sensitive but unclassified -- please protect accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary.  At the midyear point, the three U.S. flag 
airlines, American, Continental, and Delta, all report higher 
earnings in 2004 than in 2003.  All three managers voiced 
concerns over the civil aviation authority, Aeronautica Civil 
(CAA), the association of Colombian travel agencies (ANATO), 
and the Avianca-Synergy deal.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Sales Increase But Problems Remain 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) 2004 is shaping up to be a good year for U.S. flag 
carriers, with sales revenues up from five to ten percent 
over 2003 levels.  Local station managers attributed this 
increase to sustained economic growth, an increase in foreign 
investment, a rise in corporate, leisure and student travel, 
and the free trade negotiations.   The ramp up to the free 
trade negotiations, as well as the negotiations themselves, 
have significantly increased business travel not only from 
Colombia to the U.S., but also from the U.S. to Colombia. 
American Airlines\' Manager informed Econoff that the increase 
in business travel has allowed American to fly five times per 
week to Medellin and directly compete against Avianca. 
However, the airlines still face restrictions and expensive 
tax legislation, high travel agency commissions, a new 
administrative fee - (Ref B), and high fuel prices. 
 
-------------------- 
CAA and the Airlines 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) All three U.S. carriers expressed discontent with 
CAA\'s regulatory behavior.  American Airlines is the most 
vocal, stating Colombia is the most regulated airline market 
in Latin America.  CAA\'s regulatory behavior affects airline 
fares for internet programs, gate access, routes, and 
negotiations between private entities, such as travel 
agencies and airlines (Ref B).  Continental privately voiced 
concerns with CAA\'s response time to Continental\'s official 
complaints, pointing to one example where CAA responded to a 
complaint only after the event was a non-issue.  Continental 
and Delta publicly state, however, they have good relations 
with CAA.  The airlines did note that CAA was helpful with 
security and airport operations. 
 
----------------- 
ANATO\'s Influence 
----------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) ANATO, the Colombian travel agency association, has 
far greater influence with CAA than Colombia\'s airlines 
associations, ALAICO and ATAC, because of strong relations 
(and some business ties) with the Colombian Congress and the 
travel agency industry\'s support for political campaigns. 
ANATO\'s influence in CAA policy is readily seen in the rules 
regulating internet tickets for airlines (long delays in 
processing the requests) and in the newly created four 
percent administrative fee for travel agents (Ref B). 
ANATO\'s fight to survive in an era of internet tickets and 
reduced commissions for travel agencies is clearly 
demonstrated in an email, recently made public by American 
Airlines.  American\'s Station Manager in Colombia said the 
email, authored by the VP of ANATO, stated ANATO members 
should divert their sales principally towards Avianca and 
Delta because of Avianca\'s support for ANATO and American\'s 
lobbying efforts to lower travel agent commissions.  American 
Airlines has filed a lawsuit against ANATO as a result of the 
communication. 
 
--------------------------- 
Concern Over Avianca\'s Sale 
--------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Avianca has been in Chapter 11 proceedings since 
March 21, 2003 (Ref A).  Avianca chose to pursue bankruptcy 
protection in the U.S. because U.S. laws are more lenient and 
less political than existing Colombian laws.  Avianca\'s goal 
was to search for a buyer that would absorb its debt, 
currently over USD 300 million, inject capital to the 
cash-strapped company, and install a better management team. 
By April 2004, Avianca had two bidders, the Brazilian company 
Synergy and Continental-Copa.  According to American 
Airlines\' Station Manager in Colombia, Avianca chose Synergy 
mainly because Avianca felt that Continental-Copa would 
eventually absorb all of Avianca\'s operations and eliminate 
Avianca altogether.  Continental\'s Station Manager in 
Colombia stated that the Avianca-Synergy deal is worrisome to 
the Colombian aviation industry because Synergy has no real 
experience in operating a major international airline and 
fears that future Avianca-Synergy troubles may cause a 
price-war, where all airlines will lose out (however, CAA 
sets minimum and maximum price limits for the airline 
industry).  On 24 August, a New York Bankruptcy Court Judge 
said Avianca\'s restructuring plan, featuring a purchase by 
Synergy (which runs a successful regional airline in Brazil), 
complied with the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  This crucial passage 
allows Avianca to release the plan to its creditors on 3 
September.  The confirmation hearing will occur on 14 October 
and Synergy hopes Avianca will exit Chapter 11 by the end of 
the year.  The judge granted 60 days for Avianca to obtain 
the necessary votes from the creditors to approve the 
restructuring plan. 
 
6.  (SBU) Comment.  The CAA\'s efforts to protect Avianca and 
ANATO are due to the political influence of both entities. 
The CAA has repeatedly refused Open Skies negotiations for 
fear that entering U.S. carriers would undermine Avianca\'s 
chances of survival.  In addition, it has not challenged even 
the most self-serving requests from ANATO.  Rumors in the 
aviation community suggest that CAA\'s director Velez has 
political aspirations (hoping possibly to follow in the 
footsteps of another former CAA director, President Uribe) 
and therefore does not want to burn any bridges with Congress 
nor ANATO.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: OPEN SKIES AND THE BILATERAL AGREEMENT 
 
Classified By: CDA Milton K. Drucker for reasons 1.4 (c) and 
(d). 
 
1.  (U) Summary.  On 25 August 2004 DCM Milton Drucker and 
Econoff met with Aeronautica Civil (CAA) Director Juan Carlos 
Velez to discuss Open Skies.  Velez requested another one 
year extension of the 2000 agreement because he said Colombia 
was not ready for Open Skies, specifically Open Skies for 
passenger travel.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) The 2000 bilateral civ air agreement, which was set 
to expire on 31 December 2003, was extended an additional 
year based on CAA\'s willingness to conduct feasibility 
studies on Open Skies in 2004.  However, at the meeting Velez 
admitted that no feasibility studies were completed nor were 
any planned in the near future.  The primary reason is 
Avianca\'s current status under Chapter 11.  If Avianca were 
to exit Chapter 11 by the end of the year, CAA is confident 
it would not be able to compete with U.S. carriers under an 
Open Skies Agreement.  Velez mentioned that Avianca\'s 
restructuring plan, if accepted, would take months to enact. 
Velez requested the 2000 agreement, specifically paragraphs 
one and three, be extended until 31 December 2005.  Velez 
said Colombia is interested in liberalizing the air cargo 
market and, if possible, in negotiating an Open Skies 
Agreement for air cargo only.  He said Tampa Airlines is 
doing well and would like fifth freedom rights from the U.S. 
to Asia, (TAMPA is currently under investigation for 
corruption and narcotics trafficking).  On the margins, Velez 
informed DCM that Venezuelan carriers are selling airplane 
tickets to the U.S. for USD 150, while providing fuel 
subsidies to Venezuelan carriers and charging U.S. carriers 
international fuel prices, which is taking some market share 
away from Colombia. 
 
3.  (U) DCM told Velez Open Skies should not be viewed in a 
negative light.  DCM noted the success Chilean carriers have 
encountered with Open Skies and that Open Skies will promote 
more business in Colombia and offer the possibility that 
Colombia could become a major business hub between the U.S. 
and South America.  Finally, DCM noted that regardless of 
what happens to Avianca, a foreign company will own it. 
Colombia\'s interest is in promoting the lowest cost of air 
transport for its businesses and citizens.

AUGUST, 2004 
 
 
1. The following is an update of some Plan Colombia-related 
activities reported during the Embassy Plan Colombia 
Implementation Meetings of August, 2004. 
 
--- 
RSO 
--- 
 
2. Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) Program Managers Ed Lee 
and Jim Schnaible visited post from August 16-21.  The 
purpose of their visit was to renew the tactical training 
program and the AKI database.  They met with the Ambassador, 
Vice President Francisco Santos and Minister of Defense Jorge 
Uribe and briefed them on plans to recommence training for 
FY2005 and problems/issues surrounding the database program. 
The ATA team also met with the in-country contractors for 
both programs to establish training schedules and address 
coordination and administration issues on both the U.S. and 
GOC sides.  ATA will advise Post, the VP, and MoD (through 
RSO) regarding issues requiring action and outline its plan 
for CRT training to include the number of GAULA units to be 
trained during FY2005.  A separate report on the database 
design and needs will also be provided.  The report will 
outline the contents of the database, the designated GOC 
users, and the projected timeline for delivery of the 
database in phases. 
 
--- 
DOJ 
--- 
 
3. From August 1-13, DOJ conducted two Expert Witness 
Training Courses for 20 forensic examiners per course in 
Bogota and Pereira.  The course is designed to train crime 
lab forensic examiners in the skills required to testify and 
present evidence in an accusatory (oral trial) system.  Each 
student gets realistic experience by testifying as a witness 
in a simulated \"mock trial.\" 
 
4. From August 9-13, DOJ conducted a Money Laundering Course 
for Judicial Police training in Bogota.  Twenty-five officers 
from the National Police (CNP), Fiscalia, the Technical 
Investigative Corps of the Office of the Prosecutor General 
(CTI), and Department of Administrative Security (DAS) 
attended the course.  They received specialized instruction 
in current money laundering trends, financial analysis, 
banking compliance operations, money exchange house 
regulations, and general legal aspects of money laundering. 
 
5. From August 23-25, DOJ conducted the first of eight Police 
Ethics/Anti-Corruption Seminars in Bogota.  Forty CNP 
Commanders and supervisors attended.  The seminar focused on 
leadership, discipline, and transparency within the police 
ranks.  Through December 2004, this seminar will be conducted 
on seven more occasions at police training sites throughout 
Colombia.

USAID 
----- 
 
6. USAID\'s efficiency and accountability program presented 
its recommendations on accounting and internal control 
practices to the Colombian National Council for Internal 
Control (NCIC).  The recommendations were based on a 
USAID-designed internal control model that was tested in 26 
national entities. On the basis of this presentation, the 
NCIC established a committee that will draft a framework to 
standardize and implement new internal control principles in 
other public entities.  It is highly likely that the NCIC 
committee will follow USAID\'s proposed parameters and 
eventually make the standards mandatory for all public 
entities, both national and sub-national.  The implementation 
of these standards will be key to improving efficiency and 
transparency in Colombia\'s public management system. 
 
7. Ambassador Wood and Colombia\'s first lady Lina Moreno de 
Uribe dedicated the first Handicraft Fair in support of 
alternative development programs.  The event, organized under 
USAID\'s Colombian Artisan Enterprise Initiative, generated 
nearly US $15,000 in sales.  The Colombian Artisan Enterprise 
Initiative is a five-year, US $4.26 million project that 
promotes licit employment and income opportunities for 
artisans by strengthening their capacity to produce and 
market crafts.  Activities are primarily focused in 
departments (similar to a U.S. state) with strong potential 
for artesanal development.  Since September 2002, the project 
has benefited over 350 artisan households and generated 
roughly US $190,000 in sales.  It is estimated that the 
project will produce roughly US $1.75 million in sales over 
its five-year time frame. 
 
8. Ambassador Wood and President Uribe launched the joint 
USAID/Plan Colombia \"Convocatoria Conjunta\" rubber projects 
in Cimitarra, Santander.  The \"Convocatoria Conjunta\" is an 
agro-industrial development program implemented in 
partnership with the private sector.  Under the project, 
USAID funding of roughly US $16 million is leveraging over US 
$78 million in private sector resources.  The projects -- 
which will benefit 4,520 families -- will support the 
cultivation of crops such as coffee, rubber, cocoa and palm 
oil.  Activities will be implemented in the Departments of 
Antioquia, Bolivar, Caldas, Cauca, Cordoba, Cundinamarca, 
Huila, Narino, Norte de Santander, Santander, and Tolima. The 
projects will expand alternative and sustainable economic 
options for small producers and will increase private sector 
investment in targeted growth corridors vulnerable to illicit 
crop production. 
 
9. USAID financed a regional workshop to support the 
establishment and management of plant quarantine and 
inspection activities in accordance with international 
standards.  The workshop provided key plant health and 
inspection officials from the Andean countries with technical 
information and training sampling methodologies for 
phytosanitary inspections and quarantine treatments.  It also 
addressed new international phytosanitary norms regarding 
wood packaging in international trade, emergency programs for 
quarantine pest outbreaks, and technical aspects of 
developing manuals for plant quarantine and treatment 
activities.

10. On August 13, NAS Director accompanied Victoria Restrepo, 
the GOC\'s Plan Colombia Alternative Development Coordinator, 
on an inspection of manual coca eradication operations in 
Pauna, Boyaca Department.  NAS has provided technical support 
and equipment to various Colombian National Police units who 
are undertaking manual eradication operations, while the 
Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) has provided training 
in equipment operation and the manual application of 
herbicides.

Monthly Report, August 2004: 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Eradication aircraft sprayed a total of 
12,959 hectares of coca and 658 hectares of poppy in August. 
Anti-Narcotics Police units captured and/or destroyed over 
67 metric tons of cocaine, 1.2 metric tons of cocaine base, 
10 tons of pressed marijuana, and 24 kilograms of heroin 
this month. 
 
Eradication and Interdiction 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Eradication:  During the month of August, aircraft 
operating from San Jose del Guaviare sprayed approximately 
6,389 hectares and operations in Santander and Norte de 
Santander Departments sprayed approximately 6,568 hectares 
of coca.  Spray operations in Cauca and Huila Departments 
eradicated 658 hectares of poppy.  This combined effort 
resulted in the eradication of a total of approximately 
12,959 hectares of coca and 658 hectares of poppy. 
 
3. (SBU) Eradication and COLAR aircraft were involved in 14 
hostile fire incidents, resulting in 19 impacts.  Both the 
number of incidents and impacts remain well below comparable 
levels from last year. 
 
4. (SBU) Anti-Narcotics Police (DIRAN):  In August, DIRAN 
broke interdiction records.  Three Airmobile Interdiction 
(Jungla) Companies of DIRAN destroyed more than 58 metric 
tons of HCl and coca base, while the DIRAN Interdiction 
Group captured 9.3 metric tons of cocaine, 1.2 metric tons 
of cocaine base, 10 tons of pressed marijuana, and 24 
kilograms of heroin this month.  The DIRAN Interdiction 
Group also destroyed one potassium permanganate lab and the 
first two heroin labs of the year. 
 
5. (SBU) DIRAN Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance 
(ISR) Project:  The C-26B ISR aircraft continues to provide 
excellent intelligence collection, with the DIRAN Air 
Intelligence and Analysis Center producing quality reports. 
Since the project started in late 2000, the ISRs have flown 
nearly 800 missions in support of eradication and 
interdiction operations, as well as joint DIRAN and military 
operations. 
 
6. (SBU) DEA coordinated a joint operation conducted by the 
DIRAN Interdiction Group, the Colombian Navy, Marines, Coast 
Guard, and Air Force.  The operation, conducted on 
Colombia\'s Pacific Coast, resulted in the destruction of one 
cocaine HCL lab. 
 
Air Bridge Denial (ABD) 
----------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) In August, 2004, 3,583 tracks were identified over 
Colombia, of which 32 were declared Unidentified, Assumed 
Suspect (UAS) aircraft. Phase I was conducted on two tracks. 
One track was identified as friendly and one resulted in the 
CNP arresting the pilot and impounding the aircraft. Two 
Phase III events were conducted, on August 8 and 24.  Both 
aircraft were destroyed on the ground. 
 
CNP Aviation (ARAVI) 
-------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) In August, the three largest components of ARAVI\'s 
fleet clocked 1,365 mission hours.  The UH-1 helicopters 
flew 895 mission hours with an operational readiness rate of 
75 percent, Bell 212 helicopters flew 302 mission hours with 
an operational readiness rate of 78 percent, and UH-60 
helicopters flew 168 mission hours with an operational rate 
of 61 percent.  ARAVI also participated in highly successful 
interdiction missions with several other CNP units and 
national security forces in southwestern Colombia.  ARAVI 
helped brief Staffdel Mackey in Bogot and at the ARAVI 
training academy in Mariquita on August 27. 
 
Colombian Army (COLAR) Aviation 
------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) During the month of August, the third battalion of 
the Counternarcotics (CD) Brigade was dedicated to 
operations conducted under Plan Patriota while COLAR Plan 
Colombia helicopters continued to support CD Brigade troops, 
Plan Patriota, and eradication operations, as well as 
conducting training operations in Tolemaida.  Plan Colombia 
helicopters flew over 2,113 hours, accounting for more than 
1,062 sorties.   They transported 3,487 passengers and 
258,720 pounds of cargo.  Over 17 flight hours were 
dedicated to medical evacuation missions, resulting in the 
evacuation of eight patients. 
 
10. (SBU) Plan Colombia helicopter assets conducted an air 
assault and inserted 125 CD Brigade troops near 
Barrancabermeja, Santander Department.  During ground 
combat, Pastor Alapi, a senior FARC figure, was seen in the 
area by both ground forces and non-combatants.  During this 
incident, 275 Colombian Army personnel engaged an estimated 
125 FARC, which resulted in 15 guerillas killed and one 
Colombian Army soldier wounded. 
11. (SBU) During a night fire training exercise a GAU-17 
mini-gun suffered a malfunction caused by cartridge case 
head separation. The gunnery instructor and student received 
minor injuries. 
 
Law Enforcement/Public Security 
------------------------------- 
 
12. (SBU) A total of 450 police officers, composing three 
Carabineros Mobil Squadrons (EMCAR), graduated from a 
specialized training course in Espinal.  One of these 
Squadrons will relieve the DIRAN Junglas that now occupy the 
town of Penas Coloradas, which was taken as part of Plan 
Patriota. 
 
13. (SBU) EMCAR Carabineros captured four extraditable 
narcoterrorists, 38 other narcotraffickers, and 243 
guerrillas.  They seized 140 weapons.  Over four tons of 
coca base were destroyed and nine hectares of poppy and 159 
hectares of coca were manually eradicated. Additionally, CD 
Brigade forces captured 76 kilograms of cocaine base. 
 
Demobilization program: 
----------------------- 
 
14. (SBU) During the first two years of the Uribe 
administration a total of 5,163 members of terrorist groups 
(FARC, ELN, AUC) have renounced terrorism and joined the 
GOC\'s Demobilization/Reinsertion program.  The MOD has 
organized intelligence collection and analysis elements into 
a centralized database.  The database will permit sharing 
information among various Colombian security agencies.  The 
intelligence derived from the program has contributed to 
over 50 percent of the successful operations by the 
military, police, and prosecutor\'s office.  Vice-Minister of 
Defense Peate briefed the operational success of the 
program to about 50 Ambassadors and stressed his need for 
assistance in the employment of this information. 
 
Environmental 
------------- 
 
15. (U) The NAS continued to engage NGO\'s opposed to the 
spray program and sent volunteer doctors into areas 
previously controlled by insurgent forces to provide free 
medical assistance.  This provides a check of public health 
conditions in areas previously sprayed by the aerial 
aspersion program.  In August, DIRAN notified the NAS of its 
intention to create an experimental coca field on a police 
base in Guaviare Department to conduct chemical and manual 
eradication studies.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The GOC recently completed an unprecedented 
interagency analysis of FARC finances.  The study concluded 
that FARC profits in 2003 were between 1.35 and 3.25 trillion 
pesos (approximately USD 520 million to 1.25 billion) in 
2003.  According to the study, the FARC spent about 40 
percent of its earnings on precursor chemicals and 35 percent 
on terrorist attacks.  Almost half of the FARC\'s income was 
from drug trafficking and approximately 40 percent from 
extortion.  However, the GOC study\'s methodology was flawed 
and its conclusions were based on incomplete, sometimes 
questionable data.  Now that the Government has formed an 
interagency team to study terrorist finances, future studies 
will be more reliable as analysts build expertise and acquire 
better information.  The GOC has asked the Embassy for input 
on the study\'s reliability and how to improve its 
methodology.

A First-Time, Comprehensive Look at FARC Finances 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (C) On May 13, 2004, the GOC completed an unprecedented 
interagency analysis of the finances of the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2003 (sent to WHA/AND and 
SOUTHCOM).  Under the auspices of the Colombian military\'s 
(COLMIL) Joint Intelligence Unit (JIC), the GOC\'s Financial 
Intelligence Unit (UIAF) formed an interagency team of 
analysts who used input from Police, Army, Air Force, and 
Naval Intelligence, the Department of Administrative Security 
(DAS, a rough equivalent to the FBI), the Technical 
Investigative Unit (CTI) of the Prosecutor General\'s Office 
(\"Fiscalia\"), and the Interagency Committee Against 
Subversive Finances.  On August 31, the JIC presented its 
findings to Emboffs. 
 
3. (C) Based on 25,000 data entries from a variety of 
sources, the study concluded that in 2003 the FARC: 
 
Earned: between 2.1 and 3.8 trillion pesos (approximately USD 
810 million to 1.45 billion) 
Spent: between 550 and 790 billion pesos (approximately USD 
210 million to 300 million) 
Profited: between 1.35 and 3.25 trillion pesos 
(approximately USD 520 million to 1.25 billion, as calculated 
from earnings and expenses) 
 
Breakdown of Expenses: 
 
Precursor Chemicals: 304 billion pesos (38.6%) 
Terrorist Actions: 280 billion pesos (35.5%) 
Armaments: 41.3 billion pesos (5.23%) 
Bribes and Infiltration: 34.1 billion pesos (4.32%) 
Food: 32.2 billion pesos (4.07%) 
Losses from Seized Weapons: 20.1 billion pesos (2.54%) 
Administrative Costs: 14.4 billion pesos (1.82%) 
Gasoline for Drug Labs: 12.5 billion pesos (1.59%) 
Losses from Deserters: 10.9 billion pesos (1.38%)

4. (C) To put such profits in context, the study notes that 
\"Almacenes Exito,\" a Colombian chain of discount superstores, 
had sales of 3.15 trillion pesos (approximately 1.2 billion 
USD) in 2003, which falls near the high end of the FARC\'s 
estimated 2003 earnings.  Exito\'s 19,303 employees are 
organized in a national structure that can be compared in 
size and complexity to the FARC\'s drug trafficking/extortion 
industry. 
 
--------------- 
Key Assumptions 
--------------- 
 
5. (C) The GOC analysts assumed that in 2003 the FARC had 
between 14,576 and 16,672 members and 136 units (blocs, 
fronts, mobile columns, and urban militia networks).  They 
also assumed there were 68,365 hectares of coca and 1,342 
hectares of poppy in the country. (The GOC uses UN numbers, 
which are consistently lower than USG estimates of illicit 
cultivation.) 
 
------------------------------- 
Methodology: A Work in Progress 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The study was a useful first-time effort and 
demonstrated the GOC\'s ability to conduct a comprehensive 
interagency study.  However, the study has several weaknesses 
that call into question the reliability of its conclusions: 
 
-- Limited Information: The analysts acknowledged that their 
conclusions were based on rough estimates and incomplete 
data.  For example, when estimating earnings from drug 
trafficking, they averaged disparate data on drug prices, 
suspected FARC drug production, and production costs from 
several different agencies and tried to determine the most 
likely range.  The 25,000 data entries are a relatively small 
number given the FARC\'s size and complexity. 
 
-- Lack of Information Sharing: The analysts lamented that 
many intelligence agencies were reluctant to share 
information or skewed information for political reasons. 
 
-- Technological Limitations: The analysts\' computer software 
limited the sophistication and depth of the analysis. 
 
7. (C) By forming an interagency team of analysts devoted to 
terrorist finances, the GOC has developed an important tool 
to identify key vulnerabilities of illegal armed groups.  As 
the analysts develop expertise and acquire more detailed and 
reliable information, subsequent studies should be more 
useful.  They are planning a follow-on analysis of 2004 FARC 
finances and studies on paramilitary and National Liberation 
Army (ELN) finances.  The GOC has asked for Embassy feedback 
on the study\'s conclusions and how to improve future 
analyses.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The GOC\'s \"Hometown Soldiers\" Program has become a 
hallmark of President Uribe\'s Democratic Security Policy. 
The program is designed to supplement regular military units 
with platoons of local soldiers that perform basic security 
functions.  A valuable outcome of the program has been 
greater cooperation from local residents and their more 
active engagement in the GOC\'s informants network.  Hometown 
soldiers currently number over 21,000, and the GOC has plans 
to expand the program further.  NGO criticisms of the program 
have not struck a chord with the public at large.  End 
Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
How The Hometown Soldier Program Works 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Colombian Military\'s (COLMIL) \"Hometown Soldiers\" 
Program (\"Soldados Campesinos\") allows youth to fulfill their 
obligatory conscription service in their own home towns or 
regions.  According to Government sources, hometown soldiers 
receive ten to twelve weeks of training.  Because hometown 
soldiers receive only minimal instruction in offensive 
operations, their training lasts about two weeks less than 
that of regular soldiers.  They are uniformed members of the 
military who wear military rank, are subject to the military 
code of justice, and earn the same salary as regular 
(nonprofessional) soldiers. 
 
3. (C) Hometown soldiers live in rudimentary facilities or 
field tents donated or built by the towns in which they work. 
 They provide protection to local government officials -- 
many of whom used to govern from distant, safer urban centers 
-- in addition to labor for various government initiated 
civic projects. 
 
4. (C) Local commanders are responsible for recruiting and 
training hometown soldiers.  They conduct background checks 
on all recruits, including hometown and regular soldiers, to 
screen out individuals with criminal records and potential 
terrorist infiltrators.  At the end of their service, many 
hometown soldiers reenlist in the professional soldier 
program under four to six year contracts.  Professional 
soldiers earn 350,000 Colombian pesos a month (about 140 
USD), while hometown soldiers earn a monthly salary of only 
50,000 pesos (about 20 USD). 
 
----------------------------- 
GOC Touts Program\'s Successes 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (C) GOC officials tout the Hometown Soldiers Program as an 
irrefutable success.  The soldiers\' familiarity with the 
hinterland has proven to be an effective tool in finding and 
neutralizing members of illegal armed groups. 
 
6. (C) Totaling over 21,000 in 500 municipalities, hometown 
soldiers guard critical infrastructure and participate in 
civil affairs projects.  Hometown soldiers have become 
instrumental in executing the military\'s \"clear and hold\" 
strategy, serving as local stay-behind forces in conflictive 
areas.  There are, for example, over 2,000 hometown soldiers 
in Cudinamarca Department who are helping secure the region 
in the aftermath of the COLMIL\'s Plan Patriota Phase IIA, 
which uprooted a previously strong FARC presence.  In 
addition, hometown soldiers\' confidence with local residents 
has increased citizen participation in the Government\'s 
informants network. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Skepticism of Civilian Involvement in Conflict 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7. (C) On August 31, Emboffs met with Ana Maria Diaz and 
Andrea Milena Bolanos of the Colombian Commission of Jurists 
(CCJ), a prominent, left-leaning human rights NGO.  Diaz and 
Bolanos criticized the Hometown Soldiers Program for 
allegedly increasing civilians\' vulnerability to the internal 
armed conflict.  They claimed, for example, that guerrillas 
retaliate against the friends and families of hometown 
soldiers, leading to an increase in forced displacements. 
They also argued that because hometown soldiers receive 
little or no instruction regarding anti-personnel mines, 
intelligence operations, and anti-kidnapping efforts, they do 
not have the expertise to carry out operations they are 
regularly asked to perform.  Diaz and Bolanos had clearly 
done only limited research on the program\'s effects, however. 
 They based their arguments on examples they had not 
personally researched, and in the majority of cases could not 
verify that the soldiers in question were hometown soldiers. 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) To date there have been no credible human rights 
violations ascribed to hometown soldiers, and only a few 
hometown soldiers have been killed or wounded.  Despite the 
fears of both NGOs and the GOC, the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC) have not launched a major offensive 
against hometown soldiers.  So far, NGO complaints about the 
program, based more on conjecture than evidence, have had 
little resonance with the public at large.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN BANKING REGULATIONS STABILIZE SECTOR 
 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY. Colombia\'s banking regulators aided 
struggling banks through the banking crisis of the late 
nineties and have continued this work by strengthening banks 
against risk.  Colombia has implemented internal regulation 
to ensure against another banking crisis while also 
implementing Basel I standards (and beginning to implement 
Basel II) and by moving toward a standardized system to 
predict possible losses (SARC).  These regulations have 
advanced and strengthened the Colombian banking sector enough 
that Colombian industry experts are confident that past 
crises will not be repeated. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   (U) Colombia\'s financial sector is at last emerging from 
the 1998 crisis.  Colombian bank regulators attributed the 
bank failures of the late 1990s to improperly controlled 
credit risk. The Senior Economist from Superbancaria, 
Carolina Baron, expounded upon this by saying that the 
banking crisis was triggered by skyrocketing interest rates 
(due to the Asian and Russian crises) for emerging markets. 
Individuals and companies simply could not pay the interest 
on their loans, which led to high rates of default.  This was 
clearly evident in the mortgage sector as individuals 
struggled to pay interest on mortgages.  Baron said this 
created a crisis of confidence in the banking sector. 
Industry experts reported that in Q2 1999, a deep fiscal gap 
(the fiscal deficit was 5.2 percent of GDP in 1999 compared 
with 2.8 percent for 2003) sparked a currency crisis (the 
peso devauled 20 percent).  This further weakened investor 
confidence.  Non-performing loans rose from 8 percent of 
total loans in 1998 to 14 percent in 1999.  The GOC took 
action to protect depositors and through direct intervention 
rescued many of these banks, but the bailout cost a total of 
4.3 percent of Colombia\'s GDP over a period of three years, 
from 1998 to 2000. 
 
HISTORY - FOGAFIN 
 
3.   (U) Founded in 1985 after a banking crisis, the Fondo de 
Garantas de Instituciones Financieras\'s (FOGAFIN) goal is to 
increase confidence in the Colombian financial system by 
insuring individual deposits and by working with banks 
through failures and restructuring, along the lines of the 
U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Company.  FOGAFIN insured 
deposits beginning in the mid eighties and continued its work 
by restructuring banks throughout the financial crisis of the 
late nineties; however, it has not effectively achieved its 
goal of increasing investor confidence.  Part of the blame 
lies in the fact that FOGAFIN does not have the name 
recognition among the Colombian population to effectively 
build confidence in banking deposits.  Additionally, FOGAFIN 
insures less than USD 8,000 per individual account and takes 
3 to 4 months to pay in the event of a failure. 
 
4.    (U) FOGAFIN\'s work to restructure banks has been more 
successful.  By purchasing a private sector asset management 
company specializing in mortgage loan collection, Central de 
Inversiones (CISA), FOGAFIN worked to stabilize the Colombian 
banking system against future crises.  CISA recapitalized 
private and state owned financial institutions and dismantled 
bankrupt institutions.  FOGAFIN and CISA have taken on 
non-performing assets from multiple banks in order to help 
stabilize the industry.  Industry experts told Econoff that 
CISA did not use public funds to save private investors. 
Instead, FOGAFIN issued bonds to capitalize CISA, and then 
used those funds to purchase non-performing loans and 
real-estate properties.  CISA worked to collect or write-off 
non-performing loans.  In addition, once regulators increased 
the capital requirements for these banks, FOGAFIN offered 
loans to banks.  This joint effort by FOGAFIN and CISA 
stabilized banks and saved Colombia from even greater crisis. 
 
 
 
SUPERBANCARIA 
 
5.    (U) The banking superintendency, Superbancaria, is the 
regulatory arm of the banking industry.  It works closely 
with FOGAFIN to offer greater access to credit for struggling 
banks, but its main mission since 1923 has been to guarantee 
the solvency and stability of the financial system in 
Colombia.  The superintendency is currently working with 
banks to implement risk classification on a test basis and to 
assist with loan provisioning).  Superbancaria plays an 
important role in monitoring weak mortgage institutions and 
recently began monitoring market and institutional risk.  In 
December 2003, the Colombian Congress received a draft budget 
from the Uribe administration requesting full budgetary 
autonomy for Superbancaria, which should allow for more 
effective monitoring across the financial sector.  Law 795 of 
January 2003 increased independence of the financial 
institution\'s decision making; strengthened the code of 
conduct for administrators at institutions; and gave the 
banking superintendency greater regulatory and supervisory 
powers. 
 
 
POST CRISIS REGULATION 
 
6.    (U) Regulators believe the implementation of Basel I 
regulations, the implementation of a System of Credit Risk 
Administration (SARC) and the beginning steps to put the 
banking sector in line with the Basel II accord and 
international accounting standards will reduce credit and 
market risk and increase confidence. 
 
7.    (U) GOC regulators see all regulations as moving toward 
SARC and cited two specific examples that they felt would 
help implement SARC and would greatly strengthen the 
Colombian banking sector.  The SARC is a statistical model to 
determine future losses from credit portfolios which can help 
to evaluate risk.  Currently, banks hold a lot of government 
securities, increasing market risk.  With a capital cushion 
that is continually evaluated by bank regulators, banks and 
the government are able to reduce this exposure to market 
risk. The first step to move toward SARC was in 2000 when the 
GOC instituted regulations establishing early warning signals 
to indicate when a bank is nearing financial trouble, when 
liquidity is compromised and when capital goes below a 
certain level.  Regulators see these warnings signs as an 
important step to reduce market risk and give the government 
time to react early when stability is compromised. 
 
8.  (U) 2002 regulations created a system in which banks must 
evaluate the market value of their assets and electronically 
send that information to Superbancaria. This system is 
similar to the CAMEL ratings system, which was developed by 
the US Federal Reserve (FED) to monitor and evaluate risk. 
Much like with CAMEL ratings, Colombian banking regulators 
classify risk as credit, market, liquidity, operational and 
money laundering risk. While the FED evaluates banks by 
on-site examinations, Superbancaria receives this information 
electronically.  While the lack of off-site evaluations 
increases the risk that banks might send false information, 
industry experts note that banks would face sanctions and a 
possible revocation of their charter for false information. 
In 2003 as part of SARC, banks were required to complete the 
third phase of internal loan loss classification and reserve 
methodologies based on expected loss. 
 
9.  (U)  Regulators emphasized that these steps toward a more 
closely monitored banking system will aid against market and 
credit risk; however, there were laws passed after the 
banking crisis that regulators saw as harmful or incomplete. 
First, a 2001 ruling by the constitutional court requires 
mortgage loans to be no more than fifty percent of the price 
of the house. This law has negatively impacted poorer 
families because it is now more difficult to get a housing 
loan; individuals must pay up front fifty percent of the cost 
of their mortgage. Second, the GOC passed regulation in 2000 
for derivatives, which outlined how to calculate market 
value.  Regulators mentioned that they believe the GOC should 
push for greater reforms in the area. 
 
10.   (U) COMMENT. Colombians are gaining confidence in their 
banking system since the crisis of the late nineties. Experts 
are generally confident in their banking system and those in 
the banking sector believe the new regulations have raised 
the system to international standards.  While regulations 
have improved and the banking sector has grown, many analysts 
are still concerned about the market risk inherent in holding 
a large amount of government denominated debt. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE COLOMBIAN BANKING SECTOR 
 
 
1.   (U) SUMMARY. The Colombian banking sector appears to 
have finally recovered after struggling through a crisis from 
1999 through 2003.  Banks recorded record profits in the 
first semester of 2004 and the GOC continues to take steps to 
further strengthen the sector, such as fulfilling IMF 
commitments to privatize state-owned banks and strengthening 
regulations to meet international standards (septel).  The 
sector seems to be evolving into a multi-banking system and 
competition between national private banks (with over 50% of 
the market) and foreign banks (with 20% of the market) is 
intensifying.  However, only 35% of Colombians participate in 
the banking sector, the rate of non-performing loans is high, 
and the industry is heavily reliant on volatile securities. 
End Summary. 
 
THE SECTOR EVOLVES 
 
2.  (U)  Some Colombian economists note that the Colombian 
banking sector has moved from specialization to integration 
of banking activities since the 1990,s banking crisis 
(septel), which has helped Colombia strengthen its banking 
sector against future crisis. The Vice President of the 
Association of Colombian Banks, ASOBANCARIA, recently 
described the Colombian system as a multibanking system (a 
system in which banks have the capacity to participate in a 
variety of banking activities, thus diversifying against 
risk); however, in a separate meeting the senior economist of 
ASOBANCARIA, Caroline Baron, said the Colombian banking 
system is not technically a multibanking system because 
individual banks cannot fully perform a variety of services. 
One of Colombia\'s central bankers who criticized the 
Colombian banking system for being a patchwork of distinct 
financial entities in 2000 and blamed much of the crisis on 
this patchwork of services now says it is a multibanking 
system de facto and that, except for insurance and long-term 
investment operations, the Colombian Banking system can 
perform any kind of financial service. In his view, this 
movement toward multibanking has helped stabilize the 
Colombian banking sector. While there seems to be some 
disagreement about whether the Colombian banking sector has 
already become a multibanking system, all experts agreed that 
the steps to diversify banking activities has strengthened 
the industry post crisis. 
 
3.   (U)  The banking sector, as a whole, has shown record 
profits for the first quarter of this year, and profitability 
more than doubled (102 percent) in 2003. Recent reports show 
that banks (excluding those specializing in mortgages) earned 
629 billion pesos (USD 241 million) between January and July 
2004. Banks specializing in mortgages increase profits, as 
well.  Mortgage banks earned 217 billion pesos (USD 83 
million) between January and July 2004. In addition to 
increased profits, management and transparency are improving; 
39.7 percent of banks (up from 17.6 percent in 2001) achieved 
high management rankings when measured against 
Superbancaria\'s risk ratings (evaluating capital, assets, 
management, profit and liquidity). Financial institution 
portfolios grew 7.4 percent in 2003, with the largest growth 
in mortgage loans (28.1 percent).  February 2004 saw a 
non-performing loan to gross loan ratio of 9.4 percent. This 
is down from 11.2 percent a year earlier, but the numbers are 
still a concern to many bankers. 
 
STRUCTURE OF THE COMMERCIAL BANKING SECTOR 
 
4.   (U) Banks in Colombia, as described in the Organic 
Statute of the Financial System, are financial institutions, 
which receive deposits from the public through checking 
accounts, as well as time deposits, with the purpose of 
lending such deposits to the public.  Bankers in Colombia 
further classify commercial banks as mortgage, foreign-owned, 
and national.  Banks are the largest financial entities in 
Colombia, holding 84 percent of the value of total assets of 
credit establishments. 
 
5.    (U) From 1997 to 2000, 42 financial institutions merged 
in Colombia due to internal financial difficulties. Weak 
mortgage and commercial banks merged, with the resulting 
banks called commercial banks but continuing to operate as 
mortgage banks.  Mortgage defaults contributed significantly 
to Colombia\'s financial crisis of the 90,s because they were 
not well diversified; accordingly, the GOC passed a law in 
2001 designating all mortgage banks as commercial banks, 
allowing them to diversify their portfolios as an important 
hedge against risk.  Regulators said that these previously 
named mortgage banks have recovered; however, the mortgage 
banking business, itself, has not recovered. 
 
PRIVATE SECTOR COLOMBIAN BANKS 
 
6.    (U) Privately owned Colombian banks did not face the 
dire straits that mortgage banks faced during the late 
nineties, thus this industry continues to see strong profits 
this year.  Prior to the banking crisis, privately owned 
domestic banks held 20 percent of the system\'s financial 
assets.  In 2003, privately owned domestic banks held over 60 
percent of the total assets in the system.  While state-owned 
banks and mortgage institutions assets declined in the second 
half of the 1990s, the assets of private sector institutions 
actually increased.  The strong performance of these banks 
and the IMF\'s push to privatize the financial sector have 
been a contributing factors in the GOC\'s decision to sell off 
the remaining state banks.

STATE-OWNED BANKS 
 
7.    (U) Colombia\'s process of nationalization and 
privatization began after a banking crisis in 1982.  The GOC 
began nationalizing many failing banks after the 1982 banking 
crisis; however, the GOC then began to privatize these same 
banks in the early nineties.  This process was interrupted by 
the financial crisis of the late 90,s and now another wave 
of privatization is under way.  The GOC has announced it will 
sell or dismantle all state-owned banks except the 
traditional Banco Agrario.  The push for privatization comes 
from Asobancaria and private investors who see privatization 
as a way to foster a more competitive environment. 
 
8.    (U) In a potential setback for the government\'s 
privatization plan, the GOC failed to sell Bancafe, the 
nation\'s 3rd largest bank, in an auction in February 2004 
that generated no bidders.  While the failed auction could 
indicate limited international confidence in Colombian banks, 
some sector experts suggest that the GOC set too high of a 
price for the healthy but undercapitalized Bancafe.   An 
official at Asobancaria speculated that Bancafe did not sell 
because of perceived associations with a dependence on the 
agricultural sector and the fact that buyers did not want to 
be associated with a bank that had recently received a large 
government bailout.  Interestingly enough, just after the 
failed sale, the GOC announced in February 2004 that the 4

that profits were realized industry-wide due to the increase 
in low interest checking and savings accounts.  Checking 
accounts are &cheap8 ways to obtain funds, so banks have

FOREIGN BANKS 
 
9.   (U) Foreign banks in Colombia hold a smaller share of 
the market than domestic private banks, and their performance 
has not been as impressive.  Foreign banks in Colombia 
operate under the same regulations as private domestic banks 
and state owned banks.  These banks are not subject to 
foreign regulation, and must simply comply with internal, 
Colombian regulations.  However, foreign banks complain that 
they have experienced higher costs than smaller, domestic 
banks because, unlike smaller banks, they are obligated to 
comply with Colombian legislation that other banks simply 
disregard (such as a tax on certain deposited funds). 
Foreign owned banks faired well during the banking crisis, 
but currently the low volume of their business is increasing 
their unit costs due to the small scale.  These banks report 
the weakest efficiency ratios due to the contraction in their 
business volumes following the crisis; however, in 2003 they 
were the most effective in reducing their operational 
expenses when compared to other types of banks.  The ratio of 
non-performing assets to total assets is 58.3 percent below 
the ratio for the entire sector.

NEXT STEPS 
 
10.    (SBU) The Colombian banking sector has seen rising 
profits recently, but continued improvement is necessary.  In 
a speech at a major banking conference, the Dean of the 
Department of Economics at The University of the Andes, Juan 
Carlos Echeverry, mentioned that only 35 percent of 
Colombians utilize the banking sector (compared to 87 percent 
in the US).  In the beginning of the banking crisis in 1998, 
there was a steep drop in the numbers of savings and checking 
accounts.  These numbers began to recover in 1999 with 
savings accounts now having surpassed pre-crisis levels 
(currently 22.9 million); however, checking accounts are 
still lower than pre-crisis levels (from 2.1 million in 1998 
to 1.9 million in 2003).  Echeverry cited two reasons for the 
limited rate of service penetration. First, many see the poor 
(59 percent of the population is beneath the poverty level) 
as a credit risk.  Also, Colombia,s internal conflict has 
made it dangerous and costly for banks to open branches in 
rural areas.  Echeverry pushed for government and industry to 
work together to offer better opportunities for citizens to 
access the nation\'s banking system and noted that protected 
interest-bearing deposits and access to credit/capital are 
key benefits that should be extended widely to all 
Colombians. 
 
11.    (U) Fitch Ratings and bank regulators expressed 
concern over the banking sector\'s reliance on volatile 
securities related revenue.  Fitch also highlighted banks, 
need to focus on efficiency.  As the next steps of regulatory 
reform, GOC insiders are pushing for legislation that will 
reduce mandatory investments, eliminate distortionary taxes, 
improve creditors\' rights, and increase legal stability. 
 
12.   (U) COMMENT. Regulators said they are pleased with the 
current outlook for the banking sector.  Non-performing loans 
are down (even though many have noted that they are still 
higher than they would like), capital levels look good, and 
there are no liquidity concerns.  The only concern they 
mentioned was that banks, portfolios are highly invested in 
government debt.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The relationship between labor violence and political 
activity is widely accepted by labor leaders and academics in 
Colombia.  For many trade unionists, unions act as surrogate 
political parties and avenues for political activity. 
Because illegal armed groups perceive trade unionists, 
particularly teachers, as political actors, some labor 
leaders have actively discouraged trade union involvement in 
political activity.  Using actual case studies, a report 
prepared by the DOL-funded ILO technical cooperation program 
in Colombia concludes that removing politics from labor 
relations can play an important role in improving tripartite 
dialogue and reducing levels of violence against trade 
unionists and management.  In three of the report\'s seven 
case studies, the exclusion of politics from labor relations 
and the elimination of pressure from illegal armed groups 
facilitated greater cooperation between unions and 
identification of common ground between labor and management. 
 The report also presents potential strategies, which might 
be employed to reduce violence against trade unionists.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Linkage of Politics and Labor Relations Hurts Unions 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. (C) The political orientation of some Colombian labor 
unions has been the subject of several academic studies that 
attribute the overt linkage of politics and labor relations 
in Colombia to a historical absence of strong political 
parties.  According to Fabio Zapata (protect), Human Rights 
Director for the Colombian Federation of Educators (FECODE), 
Colombia\'s left-wing labor unions, particularly those 
affiliated with the United Workers Central (CUT), do not make 
a distinction between political activity and labor activism; 
the former is part and parcel of the latter.  Carlos 
Rodriguez (strictly protect), President of the CUT, has 
repeatedly told us that left-wing activists within the CUT 
see Colombia\'s political parties as corrupt or, at best, 
unrepresentative of Colombian workers.  Rodriguez has worked 
diligently throughout his tenure as CUT President -- largely 
without success -- to press union members to make a 
distinction between politics and labor activism (ref A).  He 
maintains that the linkage harms union leaders by increasing 
the risk of violence against them, alienating potential union 
members whose political views differ from union leadership, 
and diverting attention from traditional labor priorities. 
 
3. (C) According to Norberto Rios (protect), director of the 
National Labor College (\"Escuela Nacional Sindical,\" or ENS), 
a well respected Colombian labor rights NGO, paramilitaries 
target labor leaders for violence primarily because they 
perceive them to be, at best, members of the radical 
political opposition, or, at worst, covert guerrilla 
collaborators.  Moreover, ENS statistics show that 
paramilitaries disproportionately target members of the CUT, 
Colombia\'s most left-leaning and politically activist labor 
federation (ref B).  Carlos Jose Guarnizo (protect), a 
project coordinator in the ILO\'s technical cooperation 
program in Bogota, told the Embassy that the intrusion of 
partisan politics into labor relations contributes to 
violence against representatives of both labor and 
management.  Although not generally noted by Colombian human 
rights activists, business leaders and managers are often the 
victims of kidnappings, threats of violence, and extortion 
attempts by paramilitary and guerrilla groups, for both 
political and economic reasons. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Politically Active Teachers Targeted 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Forty-one of the 90 trade unionists murdered in 2003 
were teachers.  Many more teachers were threatened by illegal 
armed groups or voluntarily displaced to other locations in 
order to escape violence.  Of the estimated 312,000 teachers 
in Colombia, approximately 270,000 are members of FECODE, a 
CUT affiliate.  Most of the others belong to independent 
teachers\' unions not affiliated with FECODE.  According to 
FECODE\'s Zapata, illegal armed groups target teachers 
primarily because they believe teachers disseminate 
propaganda in the classroom.  FECODE\'s 2003 human rights 
report states that educators are targeted because of their 
vocal opposition to forced recruitment of children by illegal 
armed groups, their pedagogical, labor, and community 
leadership, and paramilitary and guerrilla perceptions that 
teachers are \"enemy collaborators.\"  In a recent meeting with 
the Embassy, Zapata, who drafted the report, told us illegal 
armed groups consider unionized teachers to be political, 
rather than economic, actors, regardless of whether they 
actually engage in political activities.  Zapata attributes 
this perception to the prevalence of left-wing political 
activism within FECODE.  The Presidential Program for Human 
Rights is working with FECODE and local teachers unions to 
design a nationwide program to assist and protect at-risk 
teachers (septel). 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Absence of Politics Opens Space for Dialogue 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) A report recently published by the DOL-funded ILO 
technical cooperation program in Colombia -- buttressed by 
three of the report\'s seven case studies -- provides evidence 
that the exclusion of political themes from union demands can 
improve the quality of dialogue and reduce violence 
perpetrated against trade unionists.  In some cases, partisan 
and non-partisan unions previously divided by political 
differences were able to cooperate in negotiations with 
employers after the politicized unions abandoned ideological 
approaches.  In other cases, the removal of vague political 
ideals helped union leaders articulate concrete, tangible 
demands they could explain to rank-and-file workers and 
negotiate more effectively with management.  Ultimately, the 
abandonment of left-wing politics convinced both labor and 
management that they were not negotiating with \"the enemy,\" 
but with a common partner.  This development helped both 
sides identify common interests and understand the other\'s 
position. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Case Study #1: Banana Strike in Uraba 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The Uraba region of northwestern Antioquia department 
has long been characterized by a heavy presence of guerrilla 
and paramilitary groups, many of which engage in narcotics 
and weapons trafficking.  For decades, the region\'s banana 
growers -- plantation owners and laborers alike -- have been 
caught in the crossfire.  The Uraba banana industry employs 
approximately 17,600 laborers working on 344 farms that range 
from small producers to large-scale agribusiness. 
Paramilitaries and guerrillas, including the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and National Liberation Army 
(ELN), traditionally exerted pressure on workers, managers, 
owners, and the general population, often at the expense of 
labor relations in the industry.  According to the ILO 
report, guerrilla infiltration of the region\'s unions in the 
1980s and early 1990s resulted in the extortion of business 
leaders, sabotage and theft of crops and plantation property, 
and, ultimately, paramilitary attacks against banana workers. 
 
 
7. (U) According to the ILO report, a stronger state presence 
and a series of successful demobilization programs have 
reduced the influence of illegal armed groups and contributed 
to improved labor relations in the region, including a 
reduction in violence.  The report states that labor and 
management, no longer separated by a political divide, have 
realized that each is necessary to the other\'s survival and 
that they must work together.  The industry\'s eight labor 
unions now negotiate jointly with the primary growers\' 
association.  A sixteen-day strike in June was characterized 
by record low levels of violence, despite high levels of 
tension and significant crop loss.  Over the course of the 
strike, banana growers lost an estimated USD 25.5 million. 
The 16,000 striking workers lost an estimated USD 5.4 
million.  When President Uribe and acting Vice-Minister for 
Labor Affairs Mauricio Rubio traveled to Uraba to mediate 
between labor and management, the issues on the table were 
bread-and-butter labor concerns, permitting the Government to 
successfully pressure both sides to meet halfway over the 
course of a one-evening negotiating session. 
 
----------------------------- 
Case Study #2: Chevron Texaco 
----------------------------- 
 
8. (U) The ILO report describes the state of play in labor 
relations within Chevron Texaco facilities in Colombia in 
2000.  Employees were represented by two labor unions, 
SINTRACHEVRONTEX and the Syndicated Workers Union (\"Union 
Sindical Obrero,\" or USO).  The former split away from the 
latter in 1998 primarily because of disagreements over USO\'s 
political orientation and aggressive tactics.  The technical 
cooperation program conducted workshops for leaders of both 
unions in 2000 and 2001 and worked with labor and management 
to set up a permanent conciliation commission in which 
management explains the company\'s business plan and 
priorities and organized labor presents concerns about 
workplace issues.  Discussion of national oil policy and 
other political issues is off-limits.  As a result of the 
technical cooperation program\'s efforts, the two unions set 
aside their political differences and now jointly present 
labor concerns to management.  Collective negotiations 
conducted since 2002 have been resolved quickly with a focus 
on traditional labor relations.  The Chevron Texaco case 
study contrasts sharply with the May \"political strike\" 
declared by USO in protest of the GOC\'s restructuring of 
Ecopetrol, Colombia\'s state-owned oil company (ref C). 
 
---------------------------- 
Case Study #3: Cementos Nare 
---------------------------- 
 
9. (U) According to the ILO report, conflict between Cementos 
Nare, which operates in the municipalities of Nare and 
Caracoli, Antioquia Department, and organized labor escalated 
in the 1970s when the Colombian Confederation of Unions 
(CSTC), a Communist labor union, convinced labor unions to 
take a more radical stance, oriented in the idea of class 
struggle, against management.  (CSTC and the radical 
Colombian Workers Union (UTC) merged to form the CUT in 
1986.)  Increased guerrilla activity in the region in the 
1980s radicalized labor unions even further.  Between the 
1970s and 1990s, violence against organized labor and 
management in the region escalated.  In 1986, Cementos Nare\'s 
Director of Industrial Relations and the union\'s president 
were assassinated by illegal armed groups.  In 1991, the firm 
closed its plant for 25 days after several workers were 
murdered.  The firm reopened the plant with the proviso that 
further violence would result in permanent closure.  The ILO 
report posits 1991 as a turning point in labor relations. 
Levels of violence declined substantially throughout the 
1990s as the firm increased social benefits for workers and 
social investment in the community and rank-and-file union 
members gradually voted the union\'s radical leadership out. 
Once workers\' interests began to take precedence over 
political demands, levels of violence diminished quickly. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) The ILO study does more than support our conclusions 
about the nature of labor violence in Colombia, for it 
demonstrates that GOC strategies to strengthen state presence 
and demobilize illegal armed actors have played a role in the 
reduction of violence against trade unionists.  The ENS 
itself acknowledges that the paramilitary peace process has 
played the most significant role in the striking decline of 
violence against trade unionists (ref D) over the last 18 
months.  The ILO study provides models for future action 
through which unions may be convinced to leave politics to 
Colombia\'s political parties and focus instead on labor 
relations and the promotion of traditional labor priorities. 
Funding for the DOL-financed technical cooperation program 
will run out in May 2005.  We urge that serious consideration 
be given to extending this program or funding other programs 
-- perhaps under FTA-related capacity building assistance -- 
that will use the ILO\'s findings to develop sector-specific 
plans of action to reduce labor violence and improve labor 
relations.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT SIGNS REVISED CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE 
INTO LAW 
 
REF: BOGOTA 6350 
 
1. (U) On August 31, President Uribe signed into law a 
new criminal procedure code consistent with Colombia\'s 
transition to an accusatory criminal justice system. 
Approval of the code by the Colombian Congress was a 
somewhat novel example of cooperative relations between 
the GOC and both houses of Congress.  The new code 
imposes dramatic changes in the roles of judges, 
prosecutors, police, and defense attorneys, as well as 
new methods for the presentation of evidence, i.e., in 
oral, public trials.  It will be introduced gradually 
throughout the country over the next four years, 
beginning in 2005 in the cities of Bogota, Armenia, 
Manizales, and Pereira. 
 
2. (SBU) The code is not perfect, and several provisions 
are problematic, including sections authorizing 
representatives of the Inspector General\'s Office 
(\"Procuraduria\") to participate in court proceedings (a 
holdover from the current criminal justice system and 
expression of political power by the Procuraduria), 
limiting prosecutorial discretion, and complicating 
prosecutors\' ability to obtain cooperative witnesses in 
narcotics, terrorism, and human rights cases.  On 
balance, however, the code is stronger than most codes in 
Latin American countries that have adopted accusatory 
systems. 
 
3. (SBU) The conversion to an accusatory system will be 
complicated.  Moreover, although the Prosecutor General\'s 
Office (\"Fiscalia\") and law enforcement agencies are 
generally well prepared for the transition, serious 
concerns remain about the preparedness of the judiciary 
and the support of the public defenders system. 
 
4. (SBU) Current Prosecutor General Luis Camilo Osorio 
has been very supportive of the transition and 
instrumental in the development of the new code.  His 
term of office, however, ends in July 2005.  Osorio\'s 
replacement will have a major impact on the 
implementation process.  Continued high levels of USG 
assistance to Colombia\'s judicial system, including 
training, technical assistance, and political and 
financial support remain critical to the success of the 
conversion.

FIRST YEAR OF OPERATIONS 
 
REF:  A. 2003 STATE 265910 
 
1. (U) Summary: This is the August 2004 Air Bridge Denial 
(ABD) activity report required by ref A.  This message also 
includes an overview of the program\'s achievements in its 
first year.  During August, there were two Phase III events 
and two Phase I events, including one arrested pilot.  There 
were 3583 tracks, of which 32 were declared Unidentified, 
Assumed Suspect (UAS). Areas of concern include P-3 
surveillance aircraft availability and decreased Relocatable 
Over-the Horizon Radar (ROTHR) tracks.  End Summary. 
 
ABD Tracks 
---------- 
 
2. (U) In August, 2004, 3583 tracks were identified over 
Colombia, of which 32 were declared Unidentified, Assumed 
Suspect (UAS) aircraft.  The GOC did not react to 19 UAS: 
seven were too close to international waters; five were near 
international borders; three were subsequently identified as 
friendly; information on two was too old or insufficient; 
and two were in areas covered with weather.  The GOC reacted 
to 13 UAS, nine of which were not located by the trackers. 
Phase I was conducted on two: one was identified as friendly 
and one resulted in the pilot\'s arrest.  Phase III events 
were conducted on August 8 and 24. 
 
Law Enforcement End Game 
------------------------ 
 
3.  (SBU) On August 31, 2004, the Carepa Radar (Northern 
Colombia) picked up a track westbound towards the Pacific 
coast.  A Citation tracker was scrambled to locate it and 
the UAS was detected 90 minutes after it disappeared from 
radar.  A UH-60 gunship was scrambled and joined up on the 
Citation and the UAS.  The UAS responded to Phase I calls 
and proceeded to land at Santa Fe de Antioquia, where the 
Gunship also landed and waited until Colombian National 
Police arrived, impounded the aircraft, and arrested the 
pilot. 
 
Phase III Events 
---------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) On August 8, 2004, ROTHR picked up a track inbound 
to Colombia in the Dog\'s Head area (southeastern Colombia.) 
A Citation and an AC-47 were scrambled from Apiay air base 
in Meta Department.  A second Citation was eventually 
launched to relieve the first one.  The AC-47 sighted the 
UAS on the ground, concealed in vegetation with engines 
showing as two hot spots.  Phase I was completed and Phase 
II was requested and completed with no response.  Phase III 
was then completed by the AC-47 with no indication of the 
aircraft being disabled.  The AC-47 then returned to base to 
refuel, an OV-10 conducted Phase III with no visible results 
and returned to base.   The AC-47 refueled, returned, and 
completed Phase III with an apparent hit, as smoke was 
observed and the aircraft was presumed destroyed.  A 
Citation was overhead during these actions. 
 
5.  (SBU) August 24, 2004.  Based on GOC Intelligence, a 
Citation sighted a helicopter parked in an illegal field in 
Northern Antioquia Department and concealed with a tarp.  A 
Bell 212 helicopter gunship was launched.   No ground forces 
were launched due to security situation in the area. Phases 
I and II were conducted without receiving any response or 
seeing movement in the area and the Bell 212 proceeded with 
Phase III and destroyed the target. 
 
August Activity 
--------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) There was limited P-3 surveillance aircraft 
activity over Colombia during August and for the months of 
June, July, and August there was a 25 percent decrease in 
ROTHR tracks, probably due to atmospheric conditions.  The 
three Citations flew a total of 187 Hours in August.  Fifty 
percent of the August sorties were in response to GOC 
intelligence, 20 percent in response to ROTHR tracks, and 13 
percent for P-3 support. 
 
First Year of ABD operations 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) From the beginning of the program to the end of 
August, there have been seven Phase I events, five Phase II 
events, and 17 Phase III events.  Eighteen aircraft have 
been destroyed, two pilots have been arrested and one died 
when the aircraft crashed trying to land.  Five other 
crewmembers were arrested.  This compares favorably to the 
average of 16 aircraft destroyed per year during the six 
years of the previous air interdiction program.  Under the 
previous program, any FAC aircraft anywhere in Colombian 
Airspace could perform an intercept.  Under the current ABD 
program, more stringent procedures are in effect, including 
the requirement that an ABD tracker be present to initiate 
an ABD event.  In effect, three aircraft are interdicting 
aerial drug trafficking over an area the combined size of 
Texas and California.  By the end of CY 2004, we expect the 
number of ABD trackers to double, with a seventh tracker 
expected to arrive early 2005. 
 
8. (U) An Interim Program Review (IPR) was held August 24 in 
Bogota.  The next ABD IPR will be September 22, also in 
Bogota.

1. (C) Summary.  On September 9, Under Secretary for 
Political Affairs Marc Grossman had separate meetings with 
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and Vice-President Francisco 
Santos in Cartagena.  Grossman thanked Uribe and Santos for 
their efforts to secure the safe release of the three 
American hostages held by the FARC.  He also congratulated 
them on progress on human rights cases and called for much 
more.  Grossman said he would not be able to make immediate 
changes on U.S. business visa policies or the travel advisory 
for Colombia.  Both Uribe and Santos asked for additional 
funding for demobilization and said the FARC is showing signs 
of weakness.  The peace process with the AUC remains 
complicated, but there has been some progress toward possible 
talks with the ELN.  Santos said the fall of the U.S. dollar 
was affecting export industries, while Uribe expressed 
concern that the tourism industry in Cartagena was suffering 
because of the U.S. travel warning.  Both said the USG should 
recognize the legitimacy of the Chavez administration in 
Venezuela while maintaining pressure on the GOV regarding 
good governance and relations with the political opposition. 
End Summary. 
 
------------ 
Human Rights 
------------ 
 
2. (C) Grossman congratulated Uribe and Santos on the 
administration\'s many human rights progress, notably arrests 
in the Arauca union murders case (refs A and B), the effort 
to move the Mapiripan case to Bogota, and the decision to 
hold high-level meetings with NGOs.  Grossman stressed the 
need for even more progress on human rights, highlighting the 
importance of eliminating impunity for military leaders 
guilty of human rights violations or collusion with 
paramilitaries.  He also highlighted U.S. concerns over the 
prosecution of Lieutenant Colonel Orozco in the Mapiripan 
case, providing Uribe with a chronology of events to explain 
the USG\'s position. 
 
3. (C) Uribe said he would raise the Orozco case with 
Prosecutor General Osorio and pass on our concerns and the 
chronology of events.  (Later that day Osorio provided 
information on two human rights cases reported in ref C.) 
 
4. (C) Uribe expressed frustration that NGOs are not 
interested in hearing his side on human rights issues, but 
are instead promoting their own political agendas.  Grossman 
stressed the important role that NGOs can play and supported 
Uribe\'s invitation to bring more NGOs to Colombia.  Grossman 
congratulated Uribe on the meeting between the Military High 
Command and the NGO community on August 5, and on Uribe\'s 
meeting with Amnesty International (ref D).  Both were 
credited in the public eye as successes in improving dialogue 
on human rights. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Humanitarian Exchange with the FARC 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) U/S Grossman thanked Uribe for his efforts to secure 
the safe release of the three U.S. hostages being held by the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  Uribe 
admitted that the offer for a humanitarian exchange with the 
FARC, initiated by Switzerland, was a surprise.  His first 
reaction was to refuse the offer because the FARC wanted to 
obtain the release of high-level leaders convicted of 
atrocities.  He eventually decided, however, that if the FARC 
released all of its political hostages he would be willing to 
release an equal number of low-level FARC members charged 
only with rebellion.  He explained that he does not have the 
legal authority to release those convicted of violent crime. 
He also wants the released prisoners to either be resettled 
in France, or participate in reintegration programs in 
Colombia.  He repeated his earlier commitments to insist that 
any exchange with the FARC include the American hostages. 
Vice-President Santos was pessimistic that Uribe\'s position 
on reintegration would be feasible, and predicted that the 
return of FARC members to combat would be a demoralizing blow 
to the military.  Santos added that the hostages issue is 
hurting Uribe\'s image and chances for reelection. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Demobilization and Peace Processes 
---------------------------------- 
6. (C) Uribe was pleased to report that for the first time 
his sources tell him the FARC is under pressure from Plan 
Patriota Phase 2B.  Santos said the COLMIL would soon be 
sending a mobile brigade into Arauca.  Both Uribe and Santos 
said they had overestimated the strength of the FARC. 
Grossman said the USG has been pleased with the number of 
terrorist deserters, but Santos countered that numbers are 
likely to decrease, since the remaining fighters are more 
dedicated to their cause. 
 
7. (C) Santos said peace negotiations with the United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) are not going smoothly 
because the AUC does not really want to demobilize.  He 
opined that AUC leaders are more worried about extradition to 
the U.S. than leaving a power vacuum that could be exploited 
by the FARC.  He expressed concern that if peace talks with 
the AUC break down, \"it could get bloody.\" 
 
8. (C) Santos said incipient peace negotiations with the 
National Liberation Army (ELN) are going more smoothly.  The 
GOC sent a letter to the ELN in June regarding terms for a 
peace settlement.  (Note: The ELN responded to the GOC in 
writing on September 6 (septel).  End note). 
 
9. (C) Uribe said the GOC needs the USG\'s help to reintegrate 
former fighters from illegal armed groups.  Roughly 6,000 
members of the FARC, ELN, and AUC have voluntarily 
demobilized and need to be reintegrated into Colombian 
society.  Grossman assured Uribe that demobilization is a 
high priority for the USG, that we have committed USD 275,000 
towards demobilization, and plan to add another USD 300,000. 
 
-------------------- 
Free Trade Agreement 
-------------------- 
 
10. (C) Grossman told Uribe the U.S. supports efforts to 
attract U.S. investors to Colombia, including events such as 
promotions in New York City on September 29 and Miami on 
September 30.  Uribe said he has been criticized recently for 
his support of the free trade agreement (FTA) with the U.S., 
specifically because of the difficulty many Colombian 
nationals have obtaining business visas to the U.S.  Charge 
d\'Affaires informed Uribe that Embassy officers would be 
meeting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the following 
day to discuss business visas.  Grossman said the Embassy 
would do what it could to facilitate the visa application 
process, but added that it would not be helpful to link an 
FTA and visa issuances. 
 
11. (C) Uribe said he believes the biggest obstacle to 
implementing the FTA will be agreement on agricultural 
exports.  Santos said the fall in the value of the dollar 
against the peso was putting pressure on agricultural 
exporters in the coffee, banana, cotton, and finished textile 
export sectors, which have all laid off workers because of 
decreases in production.  Otherwise, said Santos, the 
Colombian economy is doing well.  He said the growing deficit 
in the pension system is the only major fiscal policy issue 
at the moment. 
 
----------- 
Extradition 
----------- 
 
12. (C) Uribe reiterated his support for extradition of 
criminals to the U.S., but said he did not want it to become 
an issue in his campaign for reelection.  He asked that the 
USG ensure that prison sentences for criminals extradited 
from Colombia not be longer than allowed under Colombian law, 
and that extradited individuals be convicted for acts that 
considered crimes in Colombia.  Grossman said we had received 
the message delivered to Secretary Powell in Panama and that 
we are working to improve our mutual understanding of both 
legal systems.  Uribe accepted Grossman\'s suggestion of a 
visit by a senior DOJ official to Bogota. 
 
--------- 
Venezuela 
--------- 
 
13. (C) Grossman asked for Uribe\'s and Santos\' views on 
engagement with the administration of Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chavez.  Both stressed the importance of recognizing 
Chavez as president, but also noted the need to pressure him 
privately on good governance and keeping doors open with the 
political opposition.  Uribe said we need to cooperate with 
Venezuela on counternarcotics and counterterrorism where we 
can.  Santos said we should work hard to assure that the 2006 
elections are free and fair.  He also asked the USG to work 
with the GOV on security and border issues, as kidnappers 
tend to move easily across the border and police/military 
cooperation is weak, especially at higher levels. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Security in Cartagena and the USG Travel Warning 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
14. (C) President Uribe took advantage of the venue to 
comment on overall improvements to security in Colombia and 
his desire to see U.S.-flag cruise ships return to Cartagena. 
 He asked Grossman if it would be possible to make an 
exception to the travel warning for Colombia to highlight the 
relative security of Cartagena.  Grossman said our first 
priority is the safety of U.S. citizens and did not commit to 
change the travel warning in the near term, but agreed to 
convey these concerns in Washington.  Uribe said that the 
population of Cartagena has swollen from 500,000 in 1990 to 
almost 1 million people today, mostly reflecting internally 
displaced persons (IDPs).  Unemployment is high, and Uribe 
would like to attract more international visitors to 
Cartagena and stimulate tourism. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Request for Assistance with Money Laundering Education 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
15. (C) Santos passed a request to Grossman from the Ministry 
of Finance for USG assistance.  The MOF\'s financial 
intelligence unit (UIAF) is seeking funding for a program to 
educate the public about money laundering.  The program would 
elicit phone calls through posters or handbills offering 
pesos at a favorable exchange rate.  Callers would be 
informed that they are playing a dangerous game, and told how 
money laundering affects the economy.  Santos said the 
campaign is important, because many Colombians do not 
consider purchasing currency on the black market to be a 
crime.  Ignorance of money laundering\'s real consequences was 
a major reason why public reaction to \"Operation White 
Dollar\", a sting operation that led to several high-profile 
arrests on money laundering charges, was overwhelmingly 
negative.

Classified By: Charge d\'Affairs Milton K. Drucker for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) On September 6, the Central Command (COCE) of the 
National Liberation Army (ELN) formally responded to the 
GOC\'s August 3 communiqu reported reftel.  The ELN\'s written 
response criticized the GOC for its delay in responding to 
the ELN\'s June 4 negotiating proposal and for failing to 
address the substance of the ELN\'s offer.  Nevertheless, the 
COCE said it accepted the GOC\'s August 3 response as a 
positive sign of willingness to dialogue.  The tone of the 
ELN\'s letter was cautious but civil and left the door open 
for further communication and continuing facilitation by the 
Government of Mexico. 
 
2. (U) Begin unofficial translation: 
 
Last August 3, we received your letter responding to the 
proposed humanitarian accord presented by the ELN on June 4. 
As you can see, the Government\'s response took two months, 
while this message only took one month, which means the ELN\'s 
speed of response is twice that of the Government. 
 
But what most stands out in the Government response is that 
none of its seventeen paragraphs mention the ELN\'s June 4 
proposal.  It seems that the Government did not understand or 
intentionally ignored what we are proposing. 
 
To not respond to an interlocutor\'s proposals or to dodge 
them can lead us into a dialogue of the deaf, which is not at 
all productive in building (mutual) confidence, so it is 
obvious we are speaking different languages.  We have 
advanced a bit; at least we realize that we are speaking, 
even if we do not understand each other.  In any case, 
despite the delay in the Government\'s response, we value it 
as a positive sign of interest in dialogue. 
 
We deduce from the Government\'s proposal that we are very far 
apart.  The Government maintains that all is well in the 
country, that with the Democratic Security Policy things will 
be even better, and that the solution to the social and armed 
conflict can be reduced to demobilization and disarmament. 
In the meantime, the guerrillas will declare a unilateral 
ceasefire to demonstrate they can stop \"being terrorists,\" 
and if they stop kidnapping the Government can release some 
imprisoned guerrillas, that is, \"if they do not misbehave 
again.\" 
 
The country has spent more than 13 years reflecting on the 
situation and concluded that the armed conflict has deep 
social roots, that the State is primarily responsible for the 
chaos that Colombia is living through, and that as long as 
these causes are not overcome, it will be very difficult for 
a paradise of peace to reign on a boat that is adrift. 
 
The Government has proposed that we cease kidnapping, to 
which the ELN says to the Government that it should turn over 
the thousands of \"disappeareds\", the State being primarily 
responsible for them.  Of course we will have to address this 
issue, the ELN is aware of this, but while we take that large 
step, it would be better to decide on modest, realistic 
goals. 
 
It is then a matter of clarifying our visions with respect to 
PEACE, and whether achieving peace requires social and 
political transformations that would make the use of arms 
unnecessary.  It is critical to know whether the State is 
disposed to take such a track.  We believe that the effort to 
clarify is assisted by the facilitation of Mexico, the Group 
of Friends and other national and international efforts. 
 
The nation continues its path towards greater and greater 
polarization, increasingly as a result of hawkish policies 
and repressive actions against the population.  If this bad 
environment does not change in favor of democracy and 
persecution does not end, the search for peace will be as 
futile as plowing the desert. 
 
We would like to invite the Government to examine these 
proposals with more flexibility and that, with the goal of 
recreating initiatives, international facilitating bodies 
work to overcome current obstacles.  To that end, we 
reiterate that the ELN proposes to work towards a 
Humanitarian Accord whereby, in addition to reaching an 
agreement with the Colombian Government about the use of 
mines and explosives, we reach a General Amnesty for the 
Political Arrests and Prisoners of War, and a bilateral, 
temporary ceasefire.  Agreements which together could open 
the way to the longed for political solution that all 
Colombians dream of. 
 
When negotiating a deal, you cannot ask of the insurgency 
what the Government is not willing to take on ) that is, the 
healthy principle of reciprocity. 
 
Dare to think of peace, it is a notion shared by the people 
of the nation. 
End text.

Mediation by Mexico 
------------------- 
 
3. (C) On September 15, the Charge d\'Affaires met with 
Ambassador Andres Valencia, the Government of Mexico\'s 
designated facilitator for GOC outreach to the ELN.  Valencia 
said the generally respectful tone of the ELN\'s response -- 
particularly its failure to allude to the Colombian 
military\'s recent killings of three alleged ELN union 
activists in Arauca Department -- was encouraging.  He 
admitted that the relatively positive tone surprised him, 
given the GOC\'s insistence in its August 3 letter on a 
unilateral ELN cease-fire before negotiations could begin. 
Valencia opined that if the GOC were to insist on such a 
hard-line precondition, it would essentially kill the process 
before it even begins.  He admitted he is still struggling to 
understand both sides\' bottom-line negotiating positions and 
demands, but said he believes that a degree of flexibility by 
the GOC will permit measurable progress over time.  He asked 
the U.S. to urge the GOC to be more flexible in the 
discussion with the ELN. 
 
4. (C) Valencia also noted the ELN, unlike the 
paramilitaries, is broke.  They have no way of supporting 
themselves if they stop kidnapping and other illegal acts. 
Therefore, according to Valencia, in order for an 
ELN-ceasefire to be effective, the ELN will need some way of 
obtaining sustenance.  In response to a Valencia idea, the 
Charge pointed out it was unreasonable to expect the GOC to 
feed the ELN during negotiations, but perhaps some outside 
group might think it appropriate.  Nonetheless, he reminded 
Velencia that the ELN had been declared a terrorist 
organization by the United States and the EU countries.  This 
would be a severe constraint on anyone trying to assist the 
ELN during negotiations.

 1. (U) On September 20, the Prosecutor General\'s Office 
(\"Fiscalia\") publicly confirmed that United Self Defense 
Forces of Colombia (AUC) commander Miguel Arroyave Ruiz was 
killed.  Arroyave commanded the AUC\'s Centauros Bloc and was 
participating in peace talks with the government.  The 
reasons for his death are unknown.  He apparently died 
outside of the zone of concentration, where he was supposed 
to have been located. 
 
2. (C) Arroyave controlled several thousand troops in 
Casanare, Arauca, and Meta Departments and several hundred 
urban militia members in southern Bogota.  He was heavily 
involved in drug trafficking and was one of the most powerful 
regional AUC commanders.  For the past year or so, Arroyave\'s 
forces had been clashing with the independent Self Defense 
Forces of Casanare (ACC) for control over territory and drug 
trafficking routes, leading to a sharp spike in violence on 
Colombia\'s eastern plains.  On August 12, Arroyave agreed to 
begin demobilizing his troops.  The Peace Commissioner\'s 
Office had hoped to begin demobilization later this month, 
but had noted to us that the conflict between the Centauros 
Bloc and ACC was a major obstacle. 
 
3. (C) Little is known about Arroyave\'s subordinates, who 
will presumably take command of the Centauros Bloc.  It is 
not clear who will replace Arroyave at the negotiating table 
or if his successor will follow through on Arroyave\'s 
agreement to demobilize.  Post will follow up with septels.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (S/NF) On September 16, the Office of the Prosecutor 
General (\"Fiscalia\") issued preventive detention orders 
against one officer, two enlisted men, and a civilian 
informant in the ongoing investigation of the killing of 
three trade unionists on August 5.  The three soldiers had 
been in Fiscalia custody since September 7, following a 
preliminary investigation that led officials to conclude the 
deceased labor leaders were executed, rather than killed in a 
firefight as the soldiers had claimed.  A reinserted National 
Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla who acted as an informant in 
the case was taken into custody on September 11.  It appears 
that the trials of all four will take place in civilian 
court.  The three soldiers were part of a vetted cavalry 
squadron in Saravena, Arauca Department, attached to the 
Colombian Army\'s (COLAR) 18th Brigade.  The Ministry of 
Defense believes all three of the accused received some form 
of instruction from U.S. Special Forces trainers.  Because 
the 18th Brigade has cooperated fully with the Fiscalia\'s 
investigation and turned over the alleged offenders, post 
believes the Brigade has so far complied with Leahy Amendment 
conditions.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Three Military and Informant Detained 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On September 16, the Prosecutor General\'s Office 
(\"Fiscalia\") ordered the preventive detention of Lieutenant 
Juan Pablo Ordonez Canon and two enlisted soldiers -- Oscar 
Saul Tuta Hernandez Suarez and Jhon Alejandro Hernandez 
Suarez -- assigned to the Reveiz Pizarro Cavalry Battalion 
based in Saravena, Arauca Department.  The cavalry battalion 
is part of the Colombian Army\'s (COLAR) 18th Brigade, which 
is headquartered in Arauca City.  The Fiscalia charged the 
three soldiers with murder after a forensic examination 
indicated that three trade unionists -- Jorge Prieto, Leonel 
Goyeneche, and Hector Alirio Martinez -- allegedly killed by 
the soldiers in a firefight on the morning of August 5 (ref 
A) were probably executed.  In addition to reporting a 
firefight, the soldiers claimed the trade unionists were in 
possession of two pistols, dynamite, and detonating cord. 
The Fiscalia issued arrest warrants for the three labor 
leaders in 2003 for alleged collaboration with the National 
Liberation Army (ELN).  The three soldiers have been in 
Fiscalia custody since September 7, when they were detained 
based on warrants issued the previous day.  The Fiscalia has 
also ordered the detention of a reinserted ELN guerrilla who 
reportedly led the soldiers to the home outside Saravena 
where the trade unionists were staying. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Fiscalia Actions Satisfy NGOs, Unions 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) The preventive detention orders, which formally link 
the three accused soldiers to the alleged crime, suggest that 
the case will be heard by the civilian criminal justice 
system, rather than by the military penal justice system. 
Fiscalia officials have said both publicly and privately that 
they expect the case to be tried in civilian court.  In a 
recent conversation with the Embassy, Elba Beatriz Silva, 
director of the Fiscalia\'s Human Rights Unit, told us the 
military has not asked for jurisdiction in the case and that 
the 18th Brigade has cooperated fully with the Fiscalia\'s 
investigation.  Silva said that Prosecutor General (\"Fiscal 
General\") Luis Osorio sent civilian human rights prosecutors 
to Saravena on his official jet to take charge of the case 
the day after the killings.  From the outset, NGOs and labor 
unions disputed the soldiers\' version of events, stating that 
several witnesses reported that the trade unionists were 
extrajudicially executed (ref B).  On September 6, Deputy 
Prosecutor General Luis Alberto Santana publicly confirmed 
these allegations, stating, \"The evidence shows a homicide 
was committed.  We have ruled out that there was combat.\" 
Reaction from NGOs and labor unions has been overwhelmingly 
positive.  According to Carlos Rodriguez, President of the 
United Workers Central (CUT), the Fiscalia\'s decision \"breaks 
the cycle of impunity in Colombia.\"  Silva told Emboffs that 
Vice-President Francisco Santos, who came out in defense of 
the soldiers shortly after the incident, admitted to her 
privately that he had spoken out of turn and would make no 
more public comments about the investigation. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Three Military Assigned to Vetted Unit 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (S/NF) The Reveiz Pizarro Cavalry Battalion has been 
vetted to ensure that they have not committed human rights 
violations.  Two platoons within the battalion have received 
training from Special Forces personnel stationed on the 18th 
Cavalry Squadron\'s base in Saravena.  A third platoon is 
currently being trained.  The Ministry of Defense believes 
all three of the accused received some form of training from 
Special Forces personnel.  Special Forces training normally 
involves marksmanship, small unit tactics, and human rights. 
The Leahy Amendment requires vetted units to take steps to 
investigate and address allegations of human rights abuses. 
Because the 18th Brigade has cooperated fully with the 
Fiscalia\'s investigation and turned over the alleged 
offenders for prosecution, post believes the 18th Brigade has 
so far complied with this requirement.

1. (SBU) Summary: GOC security forces dealt two major blows 
to paramilitary forces this month.  In early September, 
elements of an Antinarcotics Police Airmobile Company 
(\"Junglas\") seized a large cocaine HCl laboratory believed 
to belong to the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia 
(AUC) in Valle del Cauca Department.  On September 18, a 
task force composed of Colombian National Police and 
Colombian Air Force elements conducted a successful assault 
on a major AUC base in Risaralda Department.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On September 6, 2004, a Colombian National Police 
(CNP) Antinarcotics Police Airmobile Company (\"Junglas\") 
destroyed a large cocaine HCl laboratory near the 
municipality of Bugalagrande, Valle del Cauca Department. 
The Junglas captured 450 kilograms of cocaine base, two 
metric tons of solid precursors, and 10 MT of liquid 
precursors.  The laboratory and cocaine base are believed to 
have belonged to elements of the AUC which support the 
network run by Norte del Valle Cartel trafficker Wilber 
Varela. 
 
3. (SBU) On September 18, a 600-man task force of Colombian 
Air Force (COLAF) and CNP units attacked and destroyed a 
major AUC encampment 25 miles northwest of Pereira, in 
Risaralda Department.  Intelligence reports and imagery 
indicated that as many as 280 AUC members may have been in 
the camp.  The camp was reported to be a base of operations, 
training facility, and narcotics production facility for the 
Central Bolivar Bloc (BCB). This was the first operation 
planned by the CNP\'s new Operations-Intelligence Center 
established to target \"cabecillas\" - FARC, AUC, and ELN 
leadership targets - and coordinate operations against them. 
 
4. (SBU) An airmobile assault on the base camp was preceded 
by COLAF fixed wing and helicopter gunships and CNP 
helicopter gunships.  Four hundred Rural Mobile Police 
(\"Carabineros\") established a perimeter around the base camp 
to contain fleeing paramilitaries.  Over 50 suspected AUC 
members were captured and an undetermined number wounded or 
killed.  Mopping-up activities were ongoing as of early 
September 20, but preliminary reports indicate the presence 
of a large cocaine HCl laboratory and several tons of 
chemical precursors.  GOC security forces suffered no 
casualties during the assault. 
 
5. (SBU) The BCB, which reportedly controls the base camp 
destroyed in the September 18 operation, is led by Carlos 
Mario Jimenez, alias \"Javier Montanez\", aka \"Macaco\", a 
participant in the AUC\'s ongoing demobilization negotiations 
with the GOC in Santa Fe de Ralito, Cordoba Department 
(reftel).  While AUC leaders participate in peace talks with 
the GOC, their organizations remain fully engaged in 
recruitment, training, and narcotics production and 
trafficking.  The GOC has made clear that it will continue 
to prosecute crimes committed by paramilitary leaders or 
their associates, even while concentrated in Santa Fe de 
Ralito.  These two attacks are spectacular evidence of that 
determination.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) In mid September, Emboffs discussed security issues 
with local officials in Cali, capital of Valle del Cauca 
Department.  Despite an overall improvement in most security 
indicators, the murder rate in the department has increased 
substantially this year.  A combination of several factors 
has contributed to the highest per capita murder rate in the 
country: a violent rivalry between two powerful drug 
traffickers, an absence of real legal punishments for minors, 
lack of access to adequate employment, and increased gang 
related activity.  At the same time, Cali\'s outlook is 
improving as security programs and investment work to provide 
options and protection for the community.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Homicide Rate Increasing 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Homicides in Cali, capital of Valle del Cauca 
Department, have increased over the past few years.  Cali\'s 
murder rate is now the highest in the country.  According to 
Colonel Oscar Lopez, acting Commander of the Army\'s 3rd 
Brigade, there had been 1,742 murders in Cali as of September 
13, compared with a total of 1,634 in 2003.  Cali Police 
Commander General Mario Gutierrez said Cali averages 8.3 
deaths per day, including criminals killed in shoot-outs with 
police and military forces. 
 
3. (C) Municipal authorities attribute the escalating 
homicide rate primarily to the rivalry between drug 
traffickers Wilber Varela (alias \"Jabon\") and Diego Montoya 
Sanchez.  Varela and Montoya finance numerous loosely 
organized militias that act as private gangs to conduct 
cocaine trafficking, weapons transfers, money laundering, and 
selective assassinations.  Varela and Sanchez, who inherited 
the remnants of the Cali Cartel in the late 1990s, used to 
work together but are now competitors.  Varela is known to 
work with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 
and Montoya has confirmed ties with paramilitary groups. 
Cali\'s widespread poverty and unemployment have provided 
Varela and Montoya with a ready supply of able-bodied youths 
prepared to engage in criminal activities, including 
selective assassinations. 
 
4. (C) Increasing violence is also ascribed to conflicts 
between neighborhood gangs unrelated to the Varela/Montoya 
rivalry, fighting between guerrilla and paramilitary urban 
militias, and poverty-driven crime.  According to Valle del 
Cauca Governor Angelino Garzon, 60 percent of homicides in 
the department are a result of clashes between armed 
criminals, while 40 percent are attacks on unarmed victims. 
On September 14, Governor Garzon\'s personal driver was 
murdered.  The motive for the murder is unclear. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Overburdened Government Resources 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Local authorities explained the difficulties of 
overcoming rising levels of violence in Cali.  Gangs are 
abundant and loosely affiliated, making it difficult to 
identify them and bring their members to justice. 
Downtrodden youth drawn into illegal activities far outnumber 
Cali\'s security forces.  2,000 police and 220 military troops 
work in Cali, and are limited by poor logistics and a lack of 
transportation, communications, and communications intercept 
equipment.  The Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\"), 
with only 265 prosecutors for the entire department, has a 
backlog of approximately 2,500 cases.  The Departmental 
Fiscalia Director noted that Cali\'s prosecutors cannot even 
come close to investigating each of the approximately eight 
murders that happen each day.  Prosecutors work under 
strenuous conditions, are overburdened by their caseloads, 
and regularly receive death threats. 
6. (C) Local officials complained that Cali\'s already thinly 
stretched security forces are saddled with the additional 
task of combating major counterfeiting rings, who maintain 
intricate connections to drug trafficking, arms smuggling, 
and militia groups.  Cali is Colombia\'s largest producer of 
counterfeit bills, owing to a well developed infrastructure 
based in legitimate paper making, graphic arts and 
typography, and Cali\'s strategic proximity to various 
criminal entities.  Cali\'s security forces seized nearly 3 
million USD in counterfeit money this year, and the 
Department of Administrative Security (DAS ) Colombia\'s 
equivalent to the FBI) has established a special team to 
investigate and dismantle counterfeiting and money laundering 
organizations.  Both are supported by U.S. law enforcement 
agencies. 
 
-------------------- 
Problematic Policies 
-------------------- 
 
7. (C) Government officials cited the absence of real 
punishments for minors as another obstacle to reducing the 
murder rate.  Interlocutors told us Colombian law does not 
allow any person under the age of eighteen to be sent to 
jail.  Instead, a minor detained by law enforcement 
authorities must be delivered to the head of his or her 
household, or, in the event the minor does not have family, 
turned over to the Colombian Family Welfare Institute (ICBF). 
 Narcotraffickers capitalize on this virtual immunity to 
recruit minors to act as their personal henchmen.  Contacts 
in the Police, Army, and Fiscalia complained that youths 
released after being detained for murder or other violent 
crimes often commit additional offenses soon after being 
freed.  The ICBF has only basic infrastructure in Cali and 
cannot provide an attractive alternative to a life of crime 
for many of Cali\'s youth. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Calls For Greater Social Investment 
------------------------------------ 
 
8. (C) Valle del Cauca Governor Angelino Garzon and Cali 
Mayor Apolinar Salcedo emphasized that Cali\'s endemic 
violence calls for greater civic outreach.  Marginalized 
youth drawn into Cali\'s gangs live in poverty-stricken and 
densely populated neighborhoods with minimal access to 
education and employment opportunities.  Drug addiction, 
prostitution, and armed violence have become a way of life. 
The continuing influx of displaced persons, numbering around 
38,000 and generally from the violence-torn Departments of 
Choco and Narino, exacerbates these basic standard-of-living 
deficiencies.  According to Garzon and Salcedo, Valle\'s 
already limited resources are compounded by a debt burden 
totaling 550 billion Colombian pesos (approximately 220 
million USD). 
 
9. (C) Monsignor Juan Zarasti, the Roman Catholic Archbishop 
of Cali, said that although the city\'s leaders are well 
intentioned, many of their policies foster criminality and do 
not effectively address the real cause of violence.  A local 
human rights NGO echoed these sentiments, complaining that 
the government is too focused on increasing the police and 
military presence in the city but is failing to provide even 
basic social services. 
 
---------------------- 
A Coordinated Approach 
---------------------- 
 
10. (C) The military, police, DAS, and Fiscalia have formed a 
joint security campaign called \"Cali Segura\" (Safe Cali). 
The program is a coordinated effort to decentralize security 
and justice services and gain the confidence of the local 
population.  State institutions aim to encourage residents to 
respect the rule of law and cooperate with authorities in 
combating illegal militias.  The program focuses on the most 
violent neighborhoods located in the eastern part of the city 
near the Cauca River, collectively referred to as \"Agua 
Blanca.\"  In a city of almost 3 million people, Agua Blanca 
houses over 1 million.  As part of Cali Segura, the police 
and military provide 24-hour street patrols and security for 
school buses and community events.  The Fiscalia is working 
to strengthen its witness protection program.  Agua Blanca 
has a U.S.-funded \"Casa de Justicia\" (Justice House) where 
residents can voice legal grievances and seek legal advice, 
but the Casa de Justicia does not have an active law 
enforcement role. 
 
------------- 
The Good News 
------------- 
 
11. (C) Despite escalating violence in the region, almost all 
other security indicators have improved this year, including 
kidnappings, extortion and theft.  Local officials claimed 
that guerrilla and paramilitary groups have been pushed out 
of the city, and that the rate of displaced persons 
relocating to Cali, although still high, is decreasing. 
 
12. (C) The Governor touted Valle del Cauca\'s diverse and 
expanding economy.  Previously buoyed by powerful drug 
cartels, Valle\'s economy collapsed following their takedown 
in the mid-1990s.  Although Valle represents the third 
largest producer of exports in Colombia, including sugar, 
coffee, corn based foods, pharmaceuticals, graphic arts, 
cement, electrical and industrial materials, paper, and 
leather goods, many of these will be affected negatively by a 
free trade agreement.  Historically, Cali was a center of 
foreign investment, but that has been reduced as Medellin 
eclipses Cali.  According to Governor Garzon, Valle\'s 
unemployment rate is beginning to fall.  As a result of 
recent restructuring, the department is on track to pay its 
debt in full by 2010.  Ana Lucia Jaramillo, Director of the 
American Chamber of Commerce in Valle del Cauca, said there 
are about 50 U.S. firms in Cali, and foreign investors are 
showing renewed interest, largely as a result of improved 
overall security.

Meta Notables Murdered

2.  (U) On September 14, the bullet-riddled bodies of former 
El Dorado (Meta Department) Mayor and National Peace Prize 
winner Euser Rondon Vargas, former Governor Carlos Javier 
Sabogal, and ex-member of Congress Nubia Sanchez were found 
in an abandoned car on the road between the cities of Briceno 
and Zipaquira, Cundinamarca Department, near Bogota.  All 
three were members of the Colombia Team (\"Equipo Colombia\") 
Party, which opposes current Meta Governor Edilberto Castro 
Rincon.  The deceased had challenged Castro\'s eligibility for 
office and questioned overspending on a project to provide 
school supplies to children.  The three had left Bogota on 
September 13 for an appointment in the town of Tocancipa. 
Rondon told his bodyguards it was not necessary to accompany 
him, because the meeting was with someone he trusted.  There 
are no leads in the case.

Academic Assassinated After Being Cleared by Fiscalia 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Critics of the Uribe Administration\'s Democratic 
Security Policy have seized on the September 17 murder of 
Professor Alfredo Correa by presumed paramilitaries as an 
example of the dangers of using information from confidential 
informants to arrest suspected guerrilla collaborators. 
Correa was arrested by Department of Administrative Security 
(DAS) agents on June 17 after reinserted guerrillas 
identified him as a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia\'s (FARC) Caribbean Front.  He was released in 
early September after the Prosecutor General\'s Office 
(Fiscalia) concluded there was insufficient evidence to 
prosecute him.  Human rights NGOs labeled Correa\'s arrest an 
\"arbitrary detention.\"  The Colombia office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) has 
called for an investigation into his murder. 
 
------------------------ 
Indigenous March on Cali 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (U) Over the course of four days, 60,000 indigenous 
persons from Cauca, Narino and Putumayo Departments marched 
44 miles from the town of Santander de Quilichao, Cauca 
Department, to Cali, Valle del Cauca Department, to protest 
violence perpetrated against indigenous communities by 
illegal armed groups and alleged abuses by security forces. 
The peaceful march also protested lack of indigenous 
representation and participation in FTA negotiations. 
President Uribe had asked the indigenous groups not to march 
for security reasons and out of concerns about the potential 
disruption of public order and traffic flow on a major 
highway.  Nonetheless, Uribe explicitly recognized the 
indigenous groups\' right to march peacefully, only insisting 
on keeping the roads open.  During the event, the roads 
remained open and security forces acted with restraint. 
 
------------------------- 
High Profile Resignations 
------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Vice-Minister of Defense Andres Soto submitted his 
letter of resignation on September 16, notifying the Minister 
of Defense of his intent to leave his post by the end of 
September.  Soto\'s resignation comes as no surprise given his 
reportedly deteriorating health, waning influence within the 
Ministry, and speculation that his family\'s business ventures 
represented a conflict of interest.  Many observers had 
predicted that Soto\'s departure would coincide with the UNGA 
session, although it is unclear why he chose this 
particularly time to resign.  He will be replaced by Jorge 
Mario Eastman, who has been senior adviser to outgoing OAS 
Secretary General Cesar Gaviria for the past two years. 
 
SIPDIS 
Prior to working at the OAS, Eastman served in several posts 
in the Pastrana Administration, including as liaison to the 
National Liberation Army (ELN). 
 
6.  (U) The director of the National Statistics Department 
(DANE), Cesar Caballero, resigned on September 16 after 
claiming he had received -- and not for the first time -- 
inappropriate political pressure from the Office of the 
President.  DANE had recently released, to the GOC\'s apparent 
displeasure, the results of its latest \"Survey of 
Victimization\" in which only one-third of respondents in 
Colombia\'s three largest cities (Bogota, Cali, Medellin) said 
they felt more secure than a year ago, and two-thirds said 
they would not report a crime because they did not believe 
the police would respond.  Editorialists fretted about the 
effects on foreign investment of suggestions that GOC 
statistics, including economic data, might be 
politically-motivated. 
 
------------------------------- 
GOC Seizes La Rebaja Drugstores 
------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) On September 16, thousands of police, prosecutors, 
and Government auditors took control of 442 \"La Rebaja\" 
drugstore outlets in the GOC\'s largest seizure of suspected 
drug trafficking assets.  The GOC\'s Drug Control Office (DNE) 
is now responsible for administering the chain of stores 
still technically owned by the notorious Rodriguez Orejuela 
family.  The chain employs about 4,100 workers.  Relatives of 
the jailed Rodriguez Orejuela drug bosses failed to convince 
the GOC that ownership of La Rebaja had passed to the firm\'s 
employees.  OFAC and US Customs agree that the Rodriguez 
Orejuela family continues to control and use La Rebaja. 
Thousands of the chain\'s employees demonstrated against the 
GOC action, either out of fear for their jobs, or prompted by 
their former employers.  Seizure of the chain, however, did 
not transfer ownership.  That transfer can take place only 
after a lengthy legal process. 
 
-------------------- 
Reelection Advancing 
-------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Legislation to authorize presidential reelection 
continues to grab headlines, as former presidents and pundits 
debate the issue in public.  Several senators plan to 
introduce a separate bill to transform Colombia into a 
parliamentary democracy, ostensibly after the next 
presidential election (2006).  Only two steps remain in the 
legislative process for the reelection bill -- passage by the 
House Constitutional Affairs Committee followed by the full 
House.  House passage is highly probable, in spite of attacks 
on reelection by the likes of former President Andres 
Pastrana.  The Constitutional Court, which is composed of 
justices generally unsympathetic to Uribe, will have to rule 
on whether the Congressional action complied fully with every 
aspect of the law.  The Court may have the last word.

1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------ 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (S) The Colombian Military (COLMIL) continues to make 
progress combating illegal armed groups.  The number of 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), National 
Liberation Army (ELN), United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia 
(AUC), and smaller illegal armed group members killed, 
captured, or deserting is on the rise.  COLMIL intelligence 
figures show that all but the AUC have been unable to 
replenish their forces at the same rate they are being lost. 
To replace troop depletions, the FARC and ELN are exhausting 
their strategic reserves of personnel, which the COLMIL 
anticipates could deal both groups a devastating blow in the 
long term.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Illegal Armed Group Membership Declining Gradually 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (S) In August, the Colombian military (COLMIL) released a 
report outlining its progress against the country\'s three 
major terrorist organizations -- the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army 
(ELN), and the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) 
-- and smaller illegal armed groups.  According to the 
report, in the first seven months of 2004 COLMIL forces 
captured, killed, or received as deserters 3,147 FARC 
insurgents (roughly 24 percent of total combatants), 605 ELN 
insurgents (roughly 16 percent of total combatants), 1,999 
AUC fighters (roughly 15 percent of total combatants), and 67 
insurgents from smaller illegal armed groups (roughly 16 
percent of total combatants).  Despite this apparent 
progress, data from the same period indicates that illegal 
armed groups replenished most of these losses through 
additional recruitment.  Taking replacement rates into 
account, FARC membership declined by only about 6 percent, 
ELN membership by about 3 percent, and smaller groups by 
about 3 percent.  In contrast, the AUC replaced troops faster 
than they were eliminated, growing by about 7 percent.  As 
the number of illegal combatants who desert or are captured 
increases, so does the financial burden on the GOC to 
imprison or reinsert them.  Illegal armed groups, on the 
other hand -- particularly the FARC and ELN -- recruit with 
few financial obligations. 
 
---------- 
AUC Growth 
---------- 
 
3. (S) The COLMIL attributes paramilitary expansion to 
aggressive recruitment.  The AUC is boosting its numbers to 
gain leverage in negotiations with the GOC and increasing 
combat operations against the FARC, ELN, and dissident 
paramilitary groups in struggles over lucrative drug 
production territories.  Many new AUC recruits are attracted 
by the potential benefits of a reinsertion program, and 
paramilitary recruiters have succeeded in downplaying the 
dangers of joining by pointing to the COLMIL\'s focus on the 
FARC in its Plan Patriota Phase IIB operation in southeastern 
Colombia. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Long-Term Damage to the FARC and ELN 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (S) The COLMIL maintains that the FARC and ELN are 
exhausting their strategic reserves to replenish blocs 
depleted by COLMIL offensives.  FARC reserves include Popular 
and Bolivarian militias that provide logistics, 
communications, and re-supply support, primarily from urban 
areas.  The FARC is replacing casualties and deserters with 
Bolivarian forces, which, unlike the popular militias, have 
some military training.  COLMIL leadership does not believe 
the FARC and ELN have sufficient recruiting and training 
assets to replenish strategic reserve forces at the same rate 
they are depleted, a trend that could deal a devastating blow 
to both groups in the long term.  Although the FARC continues 
to forcibly recruit from the rural population, increased 
security and COLMIL civic action projects have hindered its 
freedom to do so.  The new police presence in municipalities 
that historically lacked a government security presence is 
also eliminating sources of recruitment.   The COLMIL asserts 
that, in contrast with a year ago, the ELN can no longer 
maintain a positive recruitment rate and cannot effectively 
combat AUC or FARC fronts without opportunistic assistance 
from one or the other. 
 
5. (C) The COLMIL continues to aggressively target FARC 
leaders, further weakening the insurgency.  Less experienced 
leaders have replaced skilled mid- and upper-level combat 
commanders, finance chiefs, and general staff members.  Since 
the beginning of the year, the COLMIL has killed the 52nd 
Front Commander, two 22nd Front Deputy Commanders (both 
replacements to previous commanders who were killed in 
action), the 27th Front Finance Chief, the Amazonas Front 
Finance Chief, a Northwestern Bloc General Staff Member, and 
Ricardo Morantes, alias \"Pacho Arenas,\" a member of the 
General Central Staff and son of deceased FARC ideologue 
Jacobo Arenas.  The FARC has lost almost 50 mid-level combat 
leaders and financiers since July 2003.  While the FARC can 
replace the rank-and-file with strategic reserve forces and 
some forced recruitment, the loss of these mid-level combat 
commanders has had a significant adverse impact on the FARC. 
 
 
6. (S) Among the FARC leaders captured this year, three will 
be especially difficult to replace given their longevity, 
experience and organizational knowledge.  General Staff 
member and key financial adviser Ricardo Palmera, alias 
\"Simon Trinidad,\" was captured in Ecuador on January 2.  He 
was a former combat commander in Caribbean Bloc and served as 
one of five designated FARC negotiators and spokesmen during 
peace negotiations with the Pastrana Administration. 
Captured on February 10, the 14th Front\'s Finance Chief and 
20-year FARC combatant Nayibe Rojas Valderrama alias \"Sonia,\" 
has extensive knowledge of FARC Southern Bloc finances, 
plans, and operations and valuable insight into FARC 
Secretariat plans and intentions, possibly including 
 
SIPDIS 
information about the U.S. hostages.  Her arrest likely 
created a void in the Southern Bloc\'s operations and 
logistical network.  On August 29, FARC 56th Front Commander 
Jorge Eliecer Jimenez, alias \"Geronimo\", was captured in 
Casanare Department.  Geronimo is believed responsible for 
the 1999 murders of three American Indian activists and the 
execution of at least 69 Colombian soldiers and a local mayor. 
 
7. (C) We believe COLMIL operations in 2004 have weakened 
FARC and ELN forces, but a continued decline depends on 
sustainability of the military offensive and the ability of 
the GOC to hold territory after it has been cleared of 
illegal armed groups.  The FARC and ELN appear to be trying 
to wait out Government forces, engaging in minimal direct 
combat, and drawing from their strategic reserves to keep 
their principal blocs in operation.

Who Are The AUC Commanders? 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Since the disappearance and probable death of former 
United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) Political Chief 
Carlos Castano in April 2004, Salvatore Mancuso, Vicente 
Castano, and Diego Murillo have emerged as the most 
significant AUC leaders: 
 
-- Salvatore Mancuso Gomez, AUC Central Command Chief and 
Northern Bloc Commander, controls approximately 1,800 
paramilitaries in northern Colombia and is AUC spokesman. 
His two recent public appearances -- during the concentration 
zone\'s inauguration on July 1 and his address to Congress on 
July 28 -- revealed his celebrity-like status within parts of 
Cordoba society and his close relationship with Congresswoman 
Eleonora Pineda, who accompanied him throughout the 
congressional address.  Mancuso was conciliatory toward the 
GOC during the initial phase of negotiations, but has now 
become less so, demanding, for example, a \"re-definition\" of 
government conditions, including a cease-fire.  He often 
clashes verbally with Central Bolivar Bloc (BCB) Political 
Commander Ernesto Baez.  Mancuso was born on August 17, 1964, 
in Tierralta, Cordoba Department, near the current 
concentration zone.  He studied engineering at a prestigious 
Bogota university and reportedly studied English in 
Pennsylvania.  He is under indictment in the U.S. on drug 
trafficking charges. 
 
-- Vicente Castano (\"El Profe\"), a senior AUC commander, is 
the eldest of the three Castano brothers who founded the AUC 
(youngest brother Fidel Castano was reportedly killed in the 
1990s).  He plays a behind-the-scenes role and, according to 
the AUC list, is not present in the concentration zone.  He 
does not attend negotiation sessions, but allegedly wields 
significant influence over Mancuso and other AUC commanders. 
Vicente is thought by some observers to be one of the 
intellectual authors of the murder of Carlos Castano.  Press 
reports say he controls AUC finances and drug trafficking. 
Castano was born on July 2, 1957, in Amalfi, Antioquia 
Department. 
 
-- Fernando Diego Murillo (\"Adolfo Paz\" or \"Don Berna\"), AUC 
Inspector General, is heavily involved in drug trafficking. 
Murrillo came to the AUC after becoming a preeminent drug 
trafficker.  He controls several thousand troops in and 
around Antioquia, loosely organized into the Pacific Bloc. 
His drug trafficking wealth has given him significant power 
within the AUC.  According to OAS representative Sergio 
Caramagna, Murillo is skilled at rebutting GOC arguments for 
demobilization and legal accountability for serious crimes 
but rarely speaks during negotiations.  Murillo was commander 
of the Cacique Nutibara Bloc (BCN), which demobilized in 
Medellin in December 2003.  Both Caramagna and Peace 
Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo have noted privately, 
however, that Murillo did not demobilize his core military 
structure.  Murillo was born on February 23, 1961. 
 
----------------------- 
AUC Regional Commanders 
----------------------- 
 
5. (C) There are several regionally powerful AUC commanders 
in the concentration zone who have left their troops under 
the command of mid-level leaders in the field.  These 
commanders tend to be less politically-astute and heavily 
involved in narcotics trafficking. 
 
-- Jorge Tovar Pupo (\"Jorge 40\"), Northern Bloc Operations 
Commander, has gained power by expanding his drug trafficking 
operations.  He is suspected of seizing thousands of acres of 
valuable land in Cesar Department through threats and 
violence, including the murder of a sitting judge.  He put 
the AUC\'s negotiations with the GOC in jeopardy in June by 
kidnapping former Senator Jose Gnecco.  He has been 
implicated in the recent death of an indigenous leader and 
the kidnapping of two other indigenous activists in August in 
the Sierra Nevada region.  (The OAS verification mission is 
investigating the incident, but predicts that the truth will 
be impossible to uncover given the heavy control 
paramilitaries have in the region.)  Tovar controls 
approximately 4,000 troops in Cesar, La Guajira, Magdalena, 
Norte de Santander, Bolivar, and Sucre Departments. 
 
Recently, Tovar has been conciliatory toward the government. 
Peace Commissioner Restrepo held a secret meeting with him 
shortly after the Gnecco kidnapping.  During the meeting, 
Tovar agreed to demobilize his troops and later persuaded 
Mancuso to back the idea.  Tovar has told Restrepo that he 
wants to leave the armed conflict and is willing to turn 
himself in to U.S. authorities to \"prove\" he is innocent of 
drug trafficking.  Restrepo speculates that the possibility 
of extradition to the U.S. convinced Tovar that 
demobilization was his best option.  Tovar was born in Cesar 
Department to an affluent family. 
 
-- Hernan Hernandez is commander of the Calima Bloc, whose 
several hundred troops operate in the departments of Cauca 
and Valle del Cauca.  According to the OAS, Hernandez also 
controls the 350-member Bananero Bloc in Cordoba and northern 
Choco Departments, which he has agreed to demobilize.  Two of 
Hernandez\'s key subordinates were captured in Medellin in 
early September.  OAS officials who have dealt with Hernandez 
describe him as one of the youngest commanders, mid-ranking 
in terms of influence, and eager to demobilize his troops. 
He has acknowledged that he faces serious criminal charges 
within Colombia and must remain in the concentration zone if 
his troops lay down their arms. 
-- Ramiro Vanoy (\"Cuco\") is powerful in Antioquia Department, 
where his Mineros Bloc operates.  He is reportedly about 50 
years old, a native of Boyaca Department, and has been 
affiliated with the AUC since at least the 1990s.  He is 
under indictment in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges. 
 
-- Francisco Javier Zuluaga Lindo (\"Gabriel Galindo\" or 
\"Gordo Lindo\") is roughly second-in-command of Murillo\'s 
Pacific Bloc.  He is under indictment in the U.S. on drug 
trafficking charges. 
 
-- Juan Carlos Sierra Ramirez is reportedly a powerful 
commander in the Middle Magdalena region.  He was born on 
April 15, 1966. 
 
-- Jhon Santamaria is an AUC field commander in western 
Antioquia Department. 
 
-------------- 
BCB Commanders 
-------------- 
 
6. (C) The Central Bolivar Bloc (BCB) has several thousand 
members and is the second largest paramilitary group.  It 
held separate negotiations with the GOC until the 
concentration zone was formed, at which time it formally 
joined the \"unified\" negotiating table. 
 
-- Ivan Roberto Duque (\"Ernesto Baez de la Serna\"), BCB 
Political Commander, is a skilled public speaker.  Government 
and OAS officials who have participated in negotiations say 
Duque is a tough negotiator who believes violence and drug 
trafficking are justified to further the paramilitary cause. 
He has said that if talks break down, the BCB would form a 
right-wing insurgency to \"rid the country of guerrillas.\" 
Duque was born on May 9, 1955, and was involved in politics 
in the Middle Magdalena region before joining the 
paramilitary movement. 
-- Javier Montanez (\"Macaco\"), the BCB Military Commander, 
appeared publicly for the first time during the July 1 
inauguration of the concentration zone.  He controls the 
BCB\'s several thousand troops, which operate primarily in and 
around Antioquia Department.  Restrepo has privately 
commented that Montanez is a major drug trafficker but keeps 
his record relatively clean by delegating the nuts-and-bolts 
of illicit activity. 
 
-- \"Julian Bolivar,\" the BCB\'s third-in-command, is similarly 
powerful and involved in drug trafficking, although Restrepo 
believes Bolivar has some ideological misgivings about 
dealing in narcotics and is more politically motivated. 
 
----------------------- 
Regional BCB Commanders 
----------------------- 
7. (C) The BCB has two important regional blocs: 
 
-- Guillermo Perez Alzate (\"Pablo Sevillano\") is commander of 
the Liberators of the South Bloc, which operates along the 
Pacific coast in Narino and Cauca Departments. 
 
-- Miguel Mejia Munera (\"Pablo Mejia\") commands the 
Vencedores of Arauca.  His unit is one of three AUC/BCB 
groups that operate in Colombia\'s eastern plains and agreed 
to demobilize on August 12.  Mejia and his twin brother 
Victor are powerful drug traffickers.  Mejia is under 
indictment in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges. 
 
------------ 
Other Groups 
------------ 
 
8. (C) There are several commanders in the zone who represent 
independent paramilitary groups or were previously unknown to 
us: 
 
-- Ramon Maria Isaza Arango is the commander of the 
independent Middle Magdalena Self-Defense Forces (AMM). 
Isaza unexpectedly joined the negotiating table with the 
AUC/BCB in June 2004, although his absence in the zone 
suggests he is not entirely comfortable associating with 
other paramilitary organizations or fully on board with 
talks.  Our interlocutors have described Isaza as a more 
\"traditional\" paramilitary, who is less involved in drug 
trafficking and more interested in combating guerrilla 
groups.  Isaza was born on September 30, 1940. 
 
-- Victor Triana Botalon is sometimes described as Isaza\'s 
deputy and other times reported to be an independent 
paramilitary commander who operates in Boyaca Department.  He 
has been associated with the AUC in the past. 
 
-- Luis Eduardo Cifuentes (\"El Aguila\") is an independent 
paramilitary commander who operates in Cundinamarca 
Department and has sometimes been associated with the AUC. 
He was born on March 16, 1960. 
 
-- \"Guillermo Torres\" commands the independent Self-Defense 
Forces of Meta and Vichada and joined the AUC/BCB negotations 
shortly before the concentration zone was inaugurated.  On 
August 12, he agreed to demobilize his troops. 
 
-- We have no information on field commanders Marlon Perez 
and Pedro Frontera. 
 
----------------------- 
Those Not Participating 
----------------------- 
 
9. (C) Three small paramilitary groups remain outside the 
Santa Fe de Ralito negotiations: 
 
-- The Elmer Cardenas Bloc, led by Alfred Berrio (\"El 
Aleman\"), operates in northern Choco and Antioquia 
Departments and has about 1,000 members.  Aleman was a 
protege of Carlos Castano but refused to join negotiations on 
the grounds that most of the AUC commanders were involved in 
drug trafficking.  His bloc has held separate talks with the 
government but has not formally agreed to a cease-fire or 
demobilization. 
-- The Peasant Self-Defense Forces of Casanare (ACC), led by 
Hector German Buitrago Parada (\"Martin Llanos\"), has 
repeatedly told the government that it wants to demobilize 
but has demanded a concentration zone of several thousand 
square miles to do so.  Buitrago did not respond to Uribe\'s 
August ultimatum that all paramilitary groups operating on 
the eastern plains demobilize or face the full weight of the 
security forces.  The group has about 800 members who are 
being pushed into an increasingly smaller area of Casanare 
Department by attacks from other AUC groups.  Buitrago was 
born on January 21, 1968. 
 
-- The Tolima Bloc, led by Daniel Roa, has about 200 members 
and has not held talks with the government.  GOC officials 
report that Roa is not closely tied to drug trafficking.

Summary 
-------- 
 
1. (C) During a visit to Sincelejo, capital of Sucre 
Department, Embassy officials observed that security is 
improving only slowly in this traditionally violent area, 
where the Uribe administration briefly gave the police and 
military state-of-emergency powers in 2002.  The notorious 
Montes de Maria region has a permanent police presence, 
seizures of illegal drug shipments and civilian road travel 
are increasing, and certain acts of terrorism have decreased. 
 However, murders and attacks on rural estates are on the 
rise, and the region is increasingly dominated by a 
paramilitary strongman, who has completely disregarded the 
AUC cease-fire.  The FARC and ELN have maintained a presence 
in central Sucre.  Socially and economically, the department 
faces daunting challenges, including a large internally 
displaced population, high unemployment, and illiteracy.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Former Rehabilitation Zone Struggling for Security 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (C) Sucre Department is notorious for guerrilla and 
paramilitary violence, especially in the central region of 
Montes de Maria, where the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC) have a strong presence and the United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) have been vying for 
dominance since about 2000.  In 2001, the AUC massacred 21 
civilians in Chengue, a small village in the Montes de Maria 
region.  Violence and instability in the Montes de Maria area 
led the Uribe administration to designate central Sucre one 
of two \"rehabilitation and consolidation zones\" in 2002, 
which gave the police and military state-of-emergency powers. 
 These expanded powers were short-lived, however, as the 
Constitutional Court abolished the zones several months after 
they were established.  Since that time, the government has 
made slow progress in combating violence and illicit activity 
in the department.  There are almost 1,500 members of the 
Colombian National Police (CNP) in Sucre, and the 
departmental commander told us his goal is to work with 
department\'s Marine and Army units to reduce crime and 
increase operations by ten percent each. 
 
-- Last year, all six municipalities in the Montes de Maria 
received squadrons of rural mounted police (\"carabineros\"). 
Several of these municipalities had never had a police 
presence and had become accustomed to FARC influence.  The 
department has one EMCAR (mobile police squadron) of 150 
police. 
 
-- The two principle highways leading to Cartagena and 
Barranquilla, which illegal armed groups use for drug 
trafficking and illegal roadblocks, are closed after 6:00 
p.m.  Highway police patrol the roads and the police 
commander told us that travel, especially by tourists driving 
to the coast, has increased.  During the trip, Embassy 
officials drove several hours from Monteria, Cordoba 
Department, to Sincelejo. 
 
-- Drug seizures in the department are increasing.  Earlier 
this year, the police seized a 700 kilogram shipment of 
cocaine -- the largest seizure ever in Sucre -- on its way to 
Cartagena. 
 
-- So far in 2004, there have been no reported illegal 
roadblocks and only five kidnappings.  In 2003, by 
comparison, there were five roadblocks and 43 kidnappings, 
and 11 roadblocks and 51 kidnappings in 2002. 
 
3. (C) Nevertheless, the department\'s security situation 
remains tenuous, and paramilitary and FARC presence is a 
serious problem.  Murders increased by three percent between 
January and September of 2004, and guerrilla attacks on rural 
estates are a growing problem.  As of September 1, nine 
ranches had been burned. 
 
-------------------------- 
AUC Cease-Fire Disregarded 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Nearly all our interlocutors emphasized that 
paramilitary commander Rodrigo Antonio Mercado Pelufo (alias 
\"Rodrigo Cadena\") exerts significant control over Sincelejo 
and most of the department\'s coastal municipalities and is 
vying for dominance in the Montes de Maria region.   There 
are an estimated 400 paramilitary fighters in Sucre. 
Although Mercado is formally a member of the AUC\'s Northern 
Bloc -- commanded by Salvatore Mancuso -- and should be 
obeying the unilateral cease-fire the AUC declared in 2002, 
all our interlocutors agreed that he is conducting business 
as usual: drug trafficking, struggling with guerrillas over 
territory, and intimidating the public.  The departmental 
police commander assured us that Cadena is the police\'s 
number one paramilitary target.  Cadena was implicated in the 
Chengue massacre and the murder of a judge in 2002. 
 
5. (C) A human rights NGO affiliated with the University of 
Sucre, as well as the Roman Catholic Bishop of Sincelejo, 
questioned the local government\'s commitment to capturing 
Cadena and combating the paramilitaries.  The NGO noted that 
Cadena is widely known to have a home in Sincelejo\'s most 
posh neighborhood but authorities look the other way.  The 
Bishop complained that many city government officials are AUC 
sympathizers who come from families that have long supported 
paramilitary activity.  He said guerrilla control over many 
rural government officials is equally troubling. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Guerrillas: Still in Montes de Maria 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The FARC\'s 35th and 37th fronts, with about 200 
members each, operate in rural areas of Montes de Maria and 
elsewhere in central and southern Sucre.  The National 
Liberation Army\'s (ELN) Jaime Bateman Canyon Front cooperates 
closely with the FARC.  Although the guerrilla presence has 
been mostly eliminated in Sincelejo, it is still a major 
source of concern for the security forces in rural areas.  A 
former mayor of one of the Montes de Maria municipalities 
noted that in 2000 she was the only mayor who was not forced 
to govern her municipality by proxy from Sincelejo.  With the 
increased police presence today, all six mayors govern from 
their towns, although FARC death threats and attacks on 
ranches continue. 
 
------------------------ 
Pressing Social Problems 
------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Economically and socially, Sucre is in dire straits. 
According to our interlocutors, Sucre has one of the highest 
rates of illiteracy and internally displaced persons in the 
country.  There are between 60,000 and 90,000 displaced 
persons in Sucre (primarily in Sincelejo), most of whom have 
been displaced by violence elsewhere in Sucre or in the 
departments of Antioquia or Choco.  Since Sucre\'s total 
population is only 600,000, the displaced population may be 
as high as 15 percent.  Upon taking office, the mayor 
installed streetlights and built several roads in Sincelejo\'s 
poorest neighborhoods and is building or expanding six 
elementary schools with assistance from the government of 
Japan.  However, both he and the governor expressed 
frustration at their inability to provide adequate assistance 
to the displaced and unemployed.

SUBJECT: RESTREPO OUTLINES AUC DEMOBILIZATION PROCESS TO 
THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS 
 
REF: A) BOGOTA 10728 B) BOGOTA 10687 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: On October 26, Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos 
Restrepo presented the government\'s demobilization plan for 
the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) to the 
diplomatic corps.  Seven AUC groups will demobilize between 
November 3 and December 18 and the GOC continues to insist 
that the AUC groups operating in the eastern plains follow 
suit.  Demobilization will last up to 48 days: 15 to 30 days 
to prepare the demobilization zone, two to ten days for the 
paramilitaries to disarm, and eight days to leave the zone 
and report to government reinsertion centers.  During this 
time, the Prosecutor General\'s Office (Fiscalia) will 
determine which of the demobilized are guilty of major 
crimes.  Those guilty will be required to remain in 
government-controlled areas until the Law for Justice and 
Reparation passes.  According to Restrepo, paramilitary 
murders have gone down 67 percent and massacres 83 percent 
since the cease-fire began.  Diplomatic corps reaction was 
subdued; no one present was openly critical but most want 
more details.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On October 26, Restrepo presented a detailed 
demobilization plan to the diplomatic corps.  He prefaced his 
power-point presentation by reiterating the pre-condition for 
negotiating with the AUC and guerrilla groups: a public 
demonstration of will to abandon violence, to which only the 
AUC had so far agreed.  He emphasized that there was no 
distinction in bringing these groups to justice, and that 
there would be no mass pardons.  He described the process not 
as a political negotiation, but as a negotiation that, if 
turned out right, would lead to a real political negotiation 
that could bring these groups into the democratic mainstream 
of the country. 
 
3. (C) Restrepo then described how the demobilization would 
proceed on a day-to-day basis and which groups would 
demobilize.  Between November 3 and December 18 the following 
AUC groups will concentrate and demobilize: 
 
- Self Defense Forces of Catatumbo (eastern Norte de 
Santander) 
- Lower and Upper Sinu Self Defense Forces (western Cordoba) 
- The Bananero Front (northwestern Antioquia) 
- The Southeastern Antioquia Front 
- The Pacific Front (coastal Cauca and Valle del Cauca) 
- The Self Defense Forces of Cundinamarca (northern 
Cundinamarca) 
- The Calima Bloc (Cauca and Valle del Cauca) 
 
4. (C) Restrepo noted that the government continues to insist 
that the AUC groups operating in the eastern plains -- the 
Centauros Bloc, the Vanquishers of Arauca, and the Self 
Defense Forces of Meta and Vichada -- demobilize before the 
end of this year.  (He did not mention the independent Self 
Defense Forces of Casanare, which have suffered heavy 
military blows). 
 
5. (C) Stressing the need for flexibility, Restrepo gave the 
following time line: 
 
-- Preparation: 15 to 30 days (GOC provides security for the 
demobilization zone and formerly occupied areas, conducts 
community outreach, and transports paramilitaries to the 
zone.  The paramilitaries submit a list of who is 
demobilizing). 
 
-- Concentration, demobilization, and identification: two to 
ten days (disarmament, minors turned over to the Family 
Welfare Institute, OAS verifies list, and GOC conducts survey 
of paramilitaries and provides basic humanitarian assistance). 
 
-- Exiting demobilization zone: eight days (demobilized 
return home and report to local reinsertion centers.  These 
centers will be in urban areas where the demobilized live). 
 
6. (C) According to Restrepo, the Fiscalia would begin 
investigating each demobilizing individual once the list is 
submitted.  However, because the paramilitaries will remain 
in the demobilization zone for only two to ten days, the 
Fiscalia will not finish the investigations until after they 
leave.  Investigations are still underway in Medellin, more 
than a year after the demobilization of the Cacique Nutibara 
Bloc.  Once the Fiscalia determines who is guilty of an 
unpardonable crime (serious violations of human rights or 
narcotics trafficking), those individuals will be required to 
remain in government-controlled areas until they are given an 
alternative sentence under the \"Law of Justice and 
Reparations.\"  Restrepo noted that time spent in these 
controlled areas could reduce the alternative sentence. 
 
7. (C) As outlined in ref A, the government is offering 
economic incentives, including preferential credit, to 
private companies which provide jobs to the demobilized. 
 
8. (C) Restrepo acknowledged that the cease-fire has not been 
perfectly observed.  He reported, however, that between 
February 2001 to November 2002 and December 2002 to September 
2004 paramilitaries murders dropped 67 percent (1,172 versus 
390 murders).  During the same time frames 
paramilitary-perpetrated massacres dropped 83 percent (100 
versus 17 massacres).  According to Restrepo, between June 
2000 to July 2002 and August 2002 to September 2004, the 
military has captured 300 percent more paramilitaries, killed 
229 percent more, and seized 286 percent more paramilitary 
weapons.  He said that this process should result in the 
demobilization of approximately 30 to 35 percent of the AUC 
before the end of 2004. 
 
9. (C) The reaction of the diplomatic corps was subdued but 
not openly critical.  Following the meeting, some Europeans 
expressed concern about the lack of specifics in the 
concentration and monitoring phase, the short period of time 
the paramilitaries would remain in the demobilized zone (two 
to ten days), and the slow movement in the Congress of the 
\"Law of Justice and Reparations.\"  The law will be critical 
in dealing with fighters wanted for serious human rights 
violations or narcotrafficking and senior leaders remaining 
in the special concentration zone at Santa Fe de Ralito.

1. (U) President Uribe shot down a United Self Defense Forces

incorporated into the armed forces.  On October 28, Uribe 
said that members of an illegal armed group who demobilize

allowed to join the military.  Uribe was responding to an AUC 
communique released on October 26 that proposed demobilized 
AUC members assist the armed forces by protecting the 
country\'s infrastructure.  The AUC specified that the 
Ministry of Interior rather than the Ministry of Defense 
should supervise the initiative. 
 
2. (U) Although some high level officials, including Minister

GOC Proposes Limited Humanitarian Exchange with FARC 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
1. (SBU) On October 28, GOC High Commissioner for Peace Luis 
Carlos Restrepo wrote an open letter to Papal Nuncio 
Beniamino Stella proposing that the Catholic Church mediate 
an exchange of 15 prisoners from both the GOC and the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  Face-to-face 
negotiations between representatives of the GOC and FARC over 
a broader exchange would follow.  Restrepo\'s letter sent 
under Uribe\'s instructions is the latest iteration of GOC 
efforts to reach an exchange agreement with the FARC. 
Although both sides have expressed interest in an exchange, 
neither has been willing to cede on key preconditions for 
talks, such as the GOC\'s insistence that released FARC 
fighters not return to terrorist ranks, or the FARC\'s 
requirement that the GOC temporarily withdraw security forces 
from two southeastern municipalities. 
 
2. (C) Father Dario Echeverri (strictly protect), chairman of 
the Roman Catholic Church\'s National Conciliation Commission, 
told Embassy poloffs that the exchange proposal was generated 
in an October 27 meeting between three Church officials -- 
he, Archbishop of Medellin Luis Augusto Castro, and Cardinal 
Pedro Rubiano -- and Restrepo.  Echeverri said the Papal 
Nuncio, who is out of the country, responded favorably to the 
proposal in an October 28 conversation, but would need 
authorization from the Vatican to take on such a formal role. 
 Echeverri also noted that before the FARC would be likely to 
consider the proposal, the GOC would have to formally deliver 
it to FARC leaders.  This would most likely be done through 
the Church or the Swiss Embassy, neither of which, to 
Echeverri\'s knowledge, has been asked to do so.  Swiss 
Embassy officials welcomed the Church\'s possible role as a 
mediator, and hinted that, should the talks materialize, they 
would likely take place in their embassy or the Holy See\'s. 
 
 
GOC Prisoner Exchange Proposal 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) Begin informal translation: 
 
Bogota, October 28, 2004 
 
Monsignor Beniamino Stella 
Apostolic Nuncio of His Holiness 
 
Your Excellency: 
 
The Colombian government appreciates the Catholic Church\'s 
efforts in the search for a Humanitarian Accord that would 
allow us to free FARC hostages and permit their speedy return 
home. 
 
Mr. Nuncio, before you the government ratifies its will to 
advance a humanitarian accord according to the terms 
expressed to the Swiss government on July 23, 2004, made 
public on August 18: 
 
\"The Government will unilaterally free, in accordance with 
Colombian laws, fifty guerrillas charged or found guilty of 
rebellion and offer them the opportunity to be reincorporated 
into society.  They will be offered two options: leave 
Colombia or remain in Colombia and participate in the 
National Government\'s reinsertion program.  These options 
will be extended under the auspices of the French government 
and Colombian Church. 
 
Subsequently, the guerrillas will free the political hostages 
and the members of the Public Forces currently being held. 
The release will be coordinated with the support of the 
Swiss, the French and the International Red Cross. 
 
To advance the creation of this agreement of intent, the 
national government proposes the following procedure: 
 
-- Reiterating the government\'s offer to free 15 guerrillas 
jailed for rebellion. 
 
-- The guerrillas will subsequently release, as proof of good 
will, a similar number of hostages. 
 
-- Immediately following the release, the government will 
meet with the FARC in an embassy in Bogota.  The Apostolic 
Nunciature of Colombia could be used for negotiations. 
 
-- The meeting will not exceed a period of five days and will 
only attempt to reach a prisoner exchange agreement. 
 
-- The International Red Cross may transport the FARC members 
to and from Bogota with the support of the Colombian Church. 
 
-- Military actions will not be suspended in any part of the 
national territory. 
 
Excellency: If the proposal is accepted, we hope we can 
depend on your valiant cooperation to move this new effort 
forward and relieve the suffering of those kidnapped and 
their families.\" 
 
End text. 
 
4. (C) Comment: The GOC\'s repeated attempts over the past 
several months to reach an exchange agreement with the FARC 
are a reflection of increased public interest, pressure from 
the families of hostages, a public campaign for an exchange 
by former President Samper, and the government\'s sincere 
desire to get prisoners released if it can do so without 
damaging its anti-terror efforts.  At the same time, it would 
be surprising if the FARC took any step that would bolster 
the Uribe Administration.  End comment.

SUBJECT: TAX REFORMS IN COLOMBIA 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Ambassador Wood met with Colombian Minister 
of Finance Alberto Carrasquilla to discuss tax reforms in 
Colombia.   The Ambassador offered U.S. Embassy assistance to 
help move tax reforms forward.  Minister Carrasquilla was 
receptive to the offer and agreed that reforms were needed; 
however, he expressed surprise over private sector interest 
in reform The Embassy has encountered. 
 
2.  (SBU) During an October 25 meeting, Ambassador Wood 
pointed out to Carrasquilla that a strong fiscal situation is 
fundamental to Colombia,s continued growth.  The Ambassador 
stressed the need for meaningful reform to the tax system as 
a key element in improving Colombia,s fiscal health.  The 
Ambassador also noted private sector concerns over the 
perception that large businesses are paying more taxes than 
smaller firms.  Carrasquilla thanked Ambassador Wood for his 
comments, and expressed interest in working with the U.S. 
Government on this issue. 
 
3.  (SBU) The Ambassador offered Embassy assistance to help 
in developing support for a reform package.  The Ambassador 
told Carrasquilla that a possible first step could be for the 
US Embassy to invite The Minister and private sector to 
exchange ideas and define reform goals.  Once the GOC and the 
private sector define common ground on these issues, the 
Ambassador told Carrasquilla that it will strengthen 
President Uribe\'s position before Congress. 
 
4.  (SBU) Carrasquilla admitted that of those that can pay 
taxes only a small percentage do, and offered that private 
sector interest would greatly influence the Congress. 
However, he noted that there is a short time frame in which 
Congress will be willing to tackle legislation resulting in 
major fiscal reform.  Emboffs noted that 2006 (right after 
the next presidential elections) would be the best time to 
present such a package.  This would provide sufficient time 
to develop proposals with broad public support. Carrasquilla 
noted that communication between stakeholders was the key to 
passing reforms.  The DCM and Carrasquilla agreed to keep in 
contact on this issue and to move forward with increased 
dialogue.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On October 28, Vice Minister for Labor Affairs Luz 
Stella Arango briefed embassies of ILO Governing Body (GB) 
members on GOC cases before the ILO\'s Committee on Freedom of 
Association (CFA) scheduled for discussion at the ILO 
Governing Body meeting in November.  She also requested 
support for continued funding of the ILO\'s special technical 
cooperation program.  Arango noted that the cooperation 
program has played a key role in advancing labor rights and 
outlined plans for future activities should funding continue. 
 Representatives of the Office of the Prosecutor General 
(\"Fiscalia\") described progress on 40 key cases of trade 
unionist murders included in CFA case 1787, which calls for 
GOC action to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of 
murders and human rights abuses of labor leaders, but 
acknowledged slow progress on addressing impunity issues 
across the board.  Fiscalia representatives briefed on the 
status of the criminal investigation of three military and 
one civilian accused of the August 5 murder of three trade 
unionists in Arauca Department, asserting the Fiscalia has 
rejected the military justice system\'s request for shared 
jurisdiction.  Arango acknowledged unions remain skeptical of 
GOC efforts.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
GOC: Technical Cooperation Program Essential 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Arango began her briefing with a push for continued 
funding for the ILO\'s special technical cooperation program. 
She noted the program has played an essential role in 
fostering tripartite dialogue and raising awareness of 
international labor norms within the GOC, regional 
governments, and Fiscalia.  Arango also asked GB members to 
vote against a Commission of Inquiry or Fact-Finding 
Commission should they be proposed by unions at the November 
session.  She asserted an ILO investigative commission is not 
necessary and could undo many of the cooperation program\'s 
gains to date by increasing tensions.  Arango stressed the 
importance of ILO trainers\' continued participation in 
training seminars and dialogue tables because of lingering 
mistrust between labor unions and the Government.  Arango 
also outlined GOC plans for future activities, should funding 
continue, including tripartite discussions on Convention 87 
and the right to strike in \"essential services\" sectors and 
additional seminars for police, military, law students, 
public servants and Fiscalia prosecutors.  The GOC also plans 
to launch a nationwide television ad campaign to promote 
workers\' rights. 
 
--------------------------------- 
More Protection for Labor Leaders 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Arango reminded those present that levels of violence 
against trade unionists continue to decline.  Although GOC 
statistics differ from those presented by the National Labor 
College (\"Escuela Nacional Sindical\"), both show significant 
declines in the number of trade unionist murders and 
kidnappings this year (ref A).  Arango also noted that 
funding for the Ministry of Interior\'s protection program has 
increased substantially in the past two years and observed 
that the majority (55 percent) of the program\'s resources go 
to trade unionist participants.  (The program also provides 
protection for human rights defenders, journalists, 
politicians and other at-risk populations.)  Representatives 
of the Presidential Program for Human Rights also discussed a 
relocation program for teachers, who represent about 
one-third of organized labor (ref B).  GOC officials pressed 
for the creation of the program after hearing about increased 
levels of violence against teachers at several ILO seminars. 
------------------------- 
Progress Slow on Impunity 
------------------------- 
4. (C) Fiscalia representatives reviewed progress on 40 key 
cases included in CFA case 1787, stating that most cases have 
moved to trial and, in some, guilty verdicts have been handed 
down.  Arango acknowledged that 40 cases is a small number 
and that much work remains to be done.  She noted the 
technical cooperation program had conducted seminars with 
prosecutors to sensitize them to the importance of trade 
unionist murder cases.  Fiscalia representatives noted they 
are constrained by limited resources and security concerns, 
which often preclude witnesses from sharing information and 
place prosecutors and investigators themselves at great risk. 
 Recent security improvements have permitted the Fiscalia to 
re-open cases previously suspended due to lack of evidence. 
On the investigation into the August 5 killings of three 
trade unionists in Saravena, Arauca Department, three 
suspected Colombian Army soldiers and one civilian informant 
remain in custody after forensic examinations revealed the 
trade unionists were not killed in a skirmish (ref C).  The 
Fiscalia denied the military justice system\'s request for 
shared jurisdiction on October 7.  (The question of 
jurisdiction has been sent a higher court for resolution.) 
The Fiscalia\'s national human rights unit has made the case a 
priority and hopes to move to trial quickly, but must still 
complete a series of steps mandated by the penal code. 
 
-------------------- 
Unions Not Convinced 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) In response to a question from the French political 
counselor, Arango agreed unions do not seem convinced that 
the GOC is serious about dialogue despite the series of 
seminars already conducted.  In private discussions with the 
Embassy, several labor leaders have acknowledged the large 
number of seminars but have complained about GOC 
follow-through on concerns raised in the seminars.  Labor 
leaders have also told us that the GOC is willing to discuss 
local and regional issues in seminars but is generally 
reluctant to consult on national policy issues, such as 
pension reform, privatization, and changes to the labor code. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Limited GOC, Union Representation Expected 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The GOC delegation for the November session has not 
yet been decided, but we have reason to believe Arango will 
lead it.  Colombian labor federations are leaning against 
sending representatives to Geneva just to participate in a 
half-day session.  Labor leaders continue to express 
frustration at the success of the GOC\'s lobbying efforts with 
the international community and their own failure to secure 
an ILO investigative commission.

SUBJECT: SEVEN PERCENT INCREASE IN 2005 DEFENSE BUDGET 
 
REF: BOGOTA 6598 
 
------ 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) The GOC\'s 2005 central defense budget is 9.2 trillion 
pesos, an approximately seven percent increase over 2004 
(reftel).  Defense spending has grown over 50 percent since 
2001.  The 2005 increase will fund over 16,000 new uniformed 
police and military, including three Army mobile brigades, 
one Army high mountain battalion, 5,000 rural police 
officers, eight mobile police squadrons, 158 additional 
hometown soldier platoons, and 969 marines.  Despite the 
steady increase in defense spending since Uribe took office, 
spending on social services as a percentage of the national 
budget has not fallen.  Social Protection and Education 
programs continue to receive more resources than the central 
defense budget.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Defense Spending Increased Again 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In late October, the Colombian Congress approved the 
GOC\'s 2005 national budget, which includes 9.2 trillion pesos 
for defense, a 7.1 percent increase -- 610 billion pesos -- 
over 2004 spending.  The additional funds will finance 
personnel growth and compensate for increases in routine 
expenses.  Because GOC budget practices differ from those in 
the U.S., the figures below should be considered in the 
context of the text before drawing conclusions. 
 
3. (U) Since 2001, Colombian central defense budgets have 
been: 
 
2001: 6.0 trillion pesos 
2002: 6.69 trillion pesos 
2003: 8.117 trillion pesos 
2004: 8.59 trillion pesos 
2005: 9.20 trillion pesos (projected and approved by Congress) 
2006: 8.86 trillion pesos (projected as of July 2004, but 
probably an underestimation) 
 
4. (U) The central defense budget covers salaries; the 
operating costs for each service, the joint staff, and the 
Defense Ministry; pensions for a small number of civilian 
employees; health care services; and investments, including 
heavy equipment and training.  The central budget does not 
include most non-operational (\"decentralized\") expenses, such 
as pensions for uniformed staff and the security forces\' 
private sector ventures, including the Tequendama Hotel and 
Business Center and Satena Airlines.  This \"decentralized\" 
budget is 2.64 trillion pesos for 2005. 
 
5. (U) The 2005 central defense budget can be broken down as 
follows: 
 
General Management (includes Defense Ministry): 623.34 
billion pesos 
Joint Staff: 38.86 billion pesos 
Army: 3.42 trillion pesos 
Navy: 664.17 billion pesos 
Air Force: 690.21 billion pesos 
Police: 3.07 trillion pesos 
Health Care: 686.55 billion pesos 
Miscellaneous: 12.5 billion pesos 
 
6. (U) Alternatively, it can be broken down in the following 
manner: 
 
Military and Ministry Operational Expenses: 5.16 trillion 
pesos 
Military and Ministry Investment: 655.48 billion pesos 
Police Operational Expenses: 3.29 trillion pesos 
Police Investment: 102.6 billion pesos (this is the only 
figure that has decreased from 2004.  Investment in 2004 was 
112 billion pesos). 
 
7. (U) By December 2005, the GOC plans to increase the 
security forces by 16,345 men, bringing the total to 374,125 
uniformed police and military.  Before Uribe took office in 
July 2002, the police and military totaled 278,796.  If all 
increases projected for 2005 take place as planned, the 
security forces will have increased by 34 percent, or almost 
100,000 members, during Uribe\'s first three and a half years 
in office.  The 2005 increases will be: 
 
-- Three Army mobile brigades (total: 15) 
-- One Army high mountain battalion (total: seven) 
-- 5,000 rural police officers (Carabineros) (total: 20,000) 
-- Eight mobile police squadrons (EMCAR) (total: 54 squadrons) 
-- 158 hometown soldier platoons (total: 27,006 hometown 
soldiers 
   in 754 municipalities) 
-- 969 marines (total: 4,355) 
 
8. (U) Projected increases in 2006 are: 
 
-- Three Army mobile brigades 
-- One Army high mountain battalion 
-- 5,700 hometown soldiers 
-- 500 marines 
9. (U) Increased defense spending has not displaced spending 
on social services.  The total national budget (excluding 
service on the national debt) in 2005 is 59.657 trillion 
pesos, a 19.6 percent increase over 2004\'s 49.876 trillion 
peso budget.  Defense spending represents 15.4 percent of the 
national budget, down from 16.3 percent in 2004.  It is the 
nation\'s third largest budget expense.  Key program budgets 
are as follows, according to the Finance Ministry: 
 
Social Protection: 22.4 trillion pesos 
Education: 10.6 trillion pesos 
Central Defense Budget: 9.2 trillion pesos 
Public Health: 7.4 trillion pesos

1. (C) SUMMARY:  Ambassador met with UN special advisor on 
Colombia James LeMoyne at the latter\'s request on October 28 
and 30.  LeMoyne said that the EU would release a new policy 
paper on Colombia in January 2005 which would lead to an more 
engaged approach.  On demobilization, LeMoyne reported that 
GOC Peace Commissioner Restrepo had requested UN political 
support and technical assistance.  LeMoyne told the 
Ambassador that the UN system was not working in Colombia and 
relations between the UN and GOC were strained.  The SYG had 
proposed a high-level working group to discuss the situation 
which will meet later this month.  Foreign Minister Barco 
will lead the Colombian side.  Of particular concern was the 
operation of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, whose relations with the GOC and G-24 had 
deteriorated sharply.  LeMoyne reviewed the latest GOC 
proposal for Mexican facilitation of talks with the ELN.  He 
also reported that the FARC was conducting a series of 
interviews with prominent leaders in Bogota from business, 
politics and journalism to discuss their views on the current 
situation, prospects for the future and possible scenarios in 
which the FARC may consider taking political steps.  LeMoyne 
said that he doubted the FARC would do anything to help 
President Uribe but might be willing to \"play politics\" to 
see what they could pocket.  He speculated that the FARC 
might use the Catholic Church, the Swiss, and ex-presidents 
Samper and Pastrana to pressure President Uribe on the 
hostages and a humanitarian accord with terms closer to what 
FARC leaders want. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) On October 28 and 30, Ambassador met with UN special 
adviser on Colombia James LeMoyne during the latter\'s 
five-day visit to Bogota.  Issues covered included possible 
increased engagement by the EU, upcoming demobilizations of 
the AUC, the future of the UN presence, the status of ELN 
negotiations with the GOC, and recent FARC activity. 
 
------------------------------- 
NEW EU POLICY PAPER ON COLOMBIA 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) LeMoyne said the EU position on the Colombian peace 
process was shifting.  A new policy paper was circulating in 
Brussels which would be blessed by the Council in December. 
LeMoyne described it as advocating a more serious, engaged 
approach in Colombia.  It will establish a framework to do 
more, he said.  EU High Representative Javier Solana planned 
to come to Colombia in January to unveil it. (From readouts 
Embassy has received elsewhere, the EU paper may contain new 
positive statements but also establish new conditionalities 
on aid.  That will impede assistance and widen the 
Colombia/EU gap.) 
 
------------- 
PEACE PROCESS 
------------- 
 
4. (C) LeMoyne briefed Ambassador on his meeting with GOC 
High Commissioner for Peace Luis Carlos Restrepo on October 
26.  In the context of upcoming demobilizations of the AUC 
(reftels), Restrepo had requested that the UN provide: (1) 
public support for the OAS mission, including an appeal to 
donors for financial and technical support; (2) a strong 
declaration urging that those who disarm and the communities 
that receive them not be attacked; and (3) high-level 
training for GOC officials on demobilization, disarmament and 
reintegration (DDR).  LeMoyne recommended that the UN, the 
International Committee for the Red Cross and the Catholic 
Church expand and deepen their DDR programs already underway 
in the affected areas. 
 
----------------------------------- 
REPAIRING GOC RELATIONS WITH THE UN 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) LeMoyne told Ambassador that his meetings with GOC 
officials during the UNGA \"were not good.\"  President Uribe 
remained unhappy with the UN.  As a result, the SYG has 
proposed that the GOC and UN form a small, high-level working 
group to discuss the GOC\'s vision of the UN in Colombia and 
what the UN thought it ought to be doing.  Barco will lead 
the GOC delegation to the first meeting tentatively planned 
for the end of November in New York. 
 
6. (C) LeMoyne conceded that the UN system was not working in 
Colombia, characterizing the various agencies as atomized, 
defending their own micro-programs.  He noted that helpful 
but frustrated UNDP (and UN country team) director Alfredo 
Witschi would be retiring in the spring.  This might be an 
opportunity to set in motion a new approach.  LeMoyne also 
underscored that other countries -- the EU, the Nordics, 
Canada, Mexico, Brazil -- had to weigh in with the SYG and 
others in the system to energize UN attention to Colombia. 
 
 
7. (C) As LeMoyne saw it, the UN has three missions in 
Colombia: the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR), a revised humanitarian action plan, and good 
offices.  He had already heard during this trip from FM Barco 
that GOC officials had lost confidence in the OHCHR presence 
and want it changed.  The 27 recommendations were now viewed 
as draconian demands.  In the view of GOC officials, whatever 
they told the OHCHR in the spirit of cooperation and 
consultation was used against them.  LeMoyne forewarned that, 
if the OHCHR report due out soon was seen as unfair by the 
GOC, \"we will have a very big mess on our hands.\"  On the 
other hand, the UN presence and the human rights dimension in 
particular, were important to the Europeans and, with the EU 
likely to strengthen its involvement, the OHCHR would be even 
more essential.  The high-level working group needed to 
tackle this problem first. 
 
8. (C) According to LeMoyne, the humanitarian agencies were 
also not working because of turf battles.  The revised 
humanitarian action plan, to be launched in mid-November, had 
little chance of succeeding.  There was not much scope for 
the good offices role either.   There was little negotiating 
and unlikely to be any for a while.  U/SYG Prendergast was 
advocating that the UN lower its profile in Colombia or close 
down the operation altogether.  LeMoyne consulted with 
Restrepo on this point who urged that the UN good offices 
operation not depart.  Restrepo had agreed that increasing 
the role was equally unwarranted because it would raise 
illusions which were not true. 
 
9. (C) Ambassador agreed that the humanitarian agencies were 
making a huge effort, but most of it was being frittered away 
by incompetence.  He also expressed reservations about OHCHR 
representative Michael Fruhling.  LeMoyne reiterated his view 
that whatever its problems, the OHCHR presence was essential 
and would become even more so when the \"Law for Justice and 
Reparations\" passed the Congress.  Ambassador responded that 
the approach of both the OHCHR and leading NGOs on the law 
had been unhelpful.  Demobilization was happening and the 
legal framework to deal with senior leaders and those who 
have committed gross violations of human rights or 
narco-trafficking remained unfinished.  The result was that 
Restrepo\'s position at the negotiating table was undermined. 
His only response to requests from the AUC for legal 
guarantees was \"no\" because he has no legal structure to back 
him up. 
 
10. (C) LeMoyne said he was not prepared to write off the 
OHCHR but understood that the GOC wanted to.  Barco was more 
than upset, convinced that the GOC was given no credit for 
making a sincere effort and that mending relations may not be 
worth the effort.  Barco planned to travel to Geneva to meet 
High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour in 
mid-November to discuss the situation.  LeMoyne wondered 
whether the mandate of the office was a problem -- could it 
monitor and offer assistance to the GOC at the same time.  A 
debate was underway at OHCHR headquarters on the issue.  The 
office had had three directors and all had ended up badly. 
Perhaps it was time to review the mandate.  Ambassador 
disagreed, noting that the U.S. and others were able to do 
both.  GOC officials could absorb and respond constructively 
to criticism if convinced that their interlocutors were 
working in their best interest.  He noted that GOC officials 
remained fearful of the power and influence of the UN and the 
possibility that Colombia could land on the agenda of the 
Security Council.  GOC officials did not draw a distinction 
between the Council and the UN writ large, and were convinced 
that the parts of the UN they interacted with were 
unsympathetic. 
 
---------------------------- 
STATUS OF TALKS WITH THE ELN 
---------------------------- 
 
11. (C) LeMoyne said the ELN was fading, no threat to anyone, 
and under the protection of the FARC.  The little brother-big 
brother dynamic remained in play: the smarter, more 
intellectual ELN, dependent on the thuggish and powerful 
FARC.  The ELN hated the FARC, was frightened of it, and 
believed it was wrong.  He was convinced that the FARC and 
ELN were meeting at high levels and maintained an agreement 
and alliance, and neither would negotiate seriously until 
things changed.  The ELN was trying to tell the FARC that it 
wanted international breathing space and needed to take 
political steps, but the FARC would limit its 
maneuverability.  Ambassador noted that the ELN remained 
politically important for the FARC, which would otherwise be 
isolated.  The ELN might be disappearing as a meaningful 
piece on the chessboard, but the FARC would do everything to 
keep it alive. 
 
12. (C)  LeMoyne heard that the Mexicans were putting 
considerable pressure on the GOC to move the negotiating 
process forward.  The ELN wants to meet the Mexicans directly 
and Mexico wants the ELN to come to Mexico.  Restrepo has 
resisted so far, insisting that the ELN respond to earlier 
GOC proposals.  Nine years of ELN traveling abroad had 
yielded little.  Restrepo wants the ELN to acknowledge that 
it has to deal with the GOC.  His latest proposal is for the 
Mexicans to tell the ELN that Restrepo meet with (jailed) 
Francisco Galan as a first step.  Then, the ELN would be 
permitted to go to Mexico for a one day meeting, and the next 
day, ELN would meet with Restrepo with Mexican facilitation. 
LeMoyne did not know how the ELN would respond.  He assumed 
the Mexicans would wince but go along. 
 
13. (C) Ambassador responded that the GOC was afraid that 
Mexican facilitation would turn into a negotiating session 
with the GOC outside the room.  Restrepo also knew, according 
to LeMoyne, that whatever travel rights he conceded to the 
ELN, the GOC would soon be pressed by the Swiss and others to 
give the FARC. 
 
--------------- 
NEW FARC MOVES? 
--------------- 
 
14. (C) LeMoyne reported that the FARC had assembled a team 
of interviewers who were soliciting views in Bogota on the 
current situation, prospects for the future, and possible 
scenarios in which it could consider taking political steps. 
The FARC had reached out to a number of prominent individuals 
in business, politics and journalism.  Some had agreed to 
talk; others refused.  Most were surprised how easily the 
FARC was able to move around Bogota.  Characterizing the FARC 
as a Stalinist, 1950s-style organization whose public 
statements still mattered, LeMoyne said that the most recent 
FARC communiqu \"was not entirely bad\" either.  Finally, he 
said that FARC leader Manuel Marulanda Velez had cancer and 
was dying, and an effort was underway to raise the profile of 
Alfonso Cano.  He expected that an interview with Cano would 
be published soon, projecting him to a wider audience. 
 
15. (C) LeMoyne doubted that anything constructive would come 
out of the FARC leadership \"until President Uribe was 
re-elected.\"  The FARC hated Uribe and would do nothing to 
help him politically or otherwise.  They are convinced, 
according to LeMoyne, that he will weaken after re-election. 
Nonetheless, the FARC may want to play politics over the next 
few months and see what they can pocket.  He speculated that 
they might use the Catholic Church or the Swiss to test the 
waters.  Or, they might make peace overtures through 
ex-presidents Samper or Pastrana to pressure Uribe on the 
hostages and a humanitarian accord with terms closer to what 
FARC leaders want.  Or, the FARC could accept a cease fire 
and play along to see what they could get out of it, with the 
hope of damaging Plan Patriota along the way.  LeMoyne 
acknowledged that Plan Patriota has been a strategic hit on 
the FARC and the leadership would do anything to rid 
themselves of it. 
 
16. (C) According to LeMoyne, the Swiss channel (Jean-Pierre 
Gontard) remained open, and he and the Swiss government 
continued to press the FARC for a ceasefire.  Their preferred 
scenario was to bring the FARC to Switzerland for a direct 
meeting with GOC officials under Swiss auspices.  LeMoyne 
noted that Restrepo had told him that if the FARC agreed to a 
ceasefire, everything was possible. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
17. (C) In addition to an exhange of views, LeMoyne was 
looking to mend fences with the GOC and the G-24 to salvage 
the UN presence in Colombia.  The latter is worth monitoring 
closly.  LeMoyne\'s operation will be part of the GOC-UN 
evaluation.  He said that he would resign if it became clear 
that he was impeding progress.  The OHCHR operation has lost 
the GOC\'s confidence and exhausted its political capital with 
the G-24.  A meeting between Foreign Minister Barco and UN 
High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour would be 
useful to clear the air.  This is the OHCHR\'s largest 
operation outside of Geneva and should be its biggest 
success.  The GOC needs it to succeed as well.  As the GOC 
and the UN negotiate their future relationship, other 
countries active in Colombia beside the U.S. need to approach 
the SYG on the importance of supporting demobilization and 
other aspects of the peace process.  In that context, a new 
EU policy as described be LeMoyne would be welcome.  We 
understand that UK Foreign Secretary Straw has raised 
Colombia with the SYG on several occasions over the last few 
months.  Countries like Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada, 
Brazil and others now need to do the same.

INTERNATIONAL UNION LEADERS 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Milton K. Drucker for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Over the weekend of October 30-31, GOC 
immigration officials denied entry to four international 
labor leaders, including one U.S. citizen, and cancelled the 
tourist visas of approximately 60 others, while permitting 
them to stay for a period of three days pending resolution of 
their cases.  The 60 labor leaders were later granted 
permission to stay until November 30.  The labor leaders had 
been invited to attend a meeting of female trade unionists 
organized by Colombia\'s major labor federations.  According 
to GOC officials, none of the labor leaders possessed visas 
consistent with the purpose of their visit.  On November 2, 
Vice-President Santos publicly apologized for the incident 
and announced all four labor leaders were welcome to return. 
MFA officials attributed the incident to immigration 
officers\' strict interpretation of the country\'s visa 
regulations and told labor leaders the decision did not 
represent an effort to undermine freedom of association.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On October 30-31, GOC immigration officials at 
Bogota\'s El Dorado international airport denied entry to four 
international labor leaders.  The four men -- U.S. citizen 
Cameron Duncan of Public Services International; Panamanian 
Rodolfo Benitez of the Switzerland-based Union Network 
International; Brazilian Antonio Fritz of the International 
Transport Workers\' Federation; and Venezuelan Victor Baez, 
General Secretary of the International Confederation of Free 
Trade Unions\' regional organization for the Americas -- had 
been invited to attend a meeting of female trade unionists. 
According to MFA Americas Division desk officer Francisco 
Gonzalez, the names of the four labor leaders, who arrived in 
Bogota without visas, were on a GOC watchlist because they 
had previously violated Colombian immigration regulations 
requiring travelers to obtain special visas if they plan to 
participate in speaking events, rallies, or marches during 
their stay in the country.  (Citizens of the United States, 
Panama, Brazil, and Venezuela may enter Colombia without a 
visa if the purpose of their visit is purely tourism.)  All 
four had visited Colombia in September to participate in 
pro-labor events organized by Colombia\'s three main labor 
federations. 
 
3. (SBU) Over the last few days of October, Colombian 
immigration officials granted approximately 60 other 
international labor leaders three-day stays to attend the 
labor event, even though they had arrived in Colombia with 
only tourist visas.  On November 3, Gonzalez explained that 
the 60 labor leaders were \"paroled\" into the country pending 
resolution of their cases, and had since been granted 
permission to remain in Colombia until November 30. 
 
4. (SBU) On November 2, MFA and immigration officials met 
with the leaders of Colombia\'s major labor federations to 
explain the weekend\'s events.  According to Gonzalez, the MFA 
said the decision to turn around the four labor leaders was 
made by immigration officials at the airport on the basis of 
a strict interpretation of the country\'s visa regulations. 
MFA representatives assured labor leaders that the decision 
did not represent an effort to undermine freedom of 
association.  The same day, Vice-President Francisco Santos 
publicly apologized for the incident and announced that all 
four union leaders were welcome to return to Colombia. 
However, Benitez publicly speculated in press interviews that 
the four union leaders\' names were placed on the watchlist 
after a tense meeting with President Alvaro Uribe during 
their September visit. 
 
5. (SBU) On November 3, Emboff spoke by telephone with 
Duncan, a long-time Embassy contact.  Duncan, who arrived in 
Colombia at 11 p.m. on October 31 on a flight from Miami, 
said he had not been aware he needed a special visa to 
participate in a labor event.  When an immigration officer 
asked Duncan if he had attended labor events in Colombia in 
September, he responded in the affirmative.  The immigration 
official then told Duncan he would need to speak to a shift 
supervisor, who told him two other trade unionists had been 
denied entry earlier that day because they had previously 
attended labor events in Colombia without a proper visa.  The 
official then told Duncan that he was denying him entry for 
the same reason.  When Duncan asked about the possibility of 
obtaining the requisite visa, immigration officials told him 
the following day was a Colombian holiday and recommended he 
apply for a new visa at the Colombian Embassy in Washington. 
Duncan spent the rest of the night at the airport and 
returned to Miami on the first available flight at 8 a.m. on 
November 1. 
 
6. (C) Comment: Most governments, including the USG, turn 
around visitors who fail to present proper visas at ports of 
entry.  However, a persistent challenge for the GOC is 
sensitizing immigration, law enforcement, and military 
authorities to the need to avoid taking actions that can 
easily be perceived as heavy-handed or that needlessly 
provoke domestic and international NGOs, including labor 
organizations.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: On November 3, Father Joakin Mayorga visited 
the Embassy to discuss the status of an investigation by the 
Office of the Prosecutor General (\"Fiscalia\") into 
accusations made by two Army officers that he had committed 
criminal misrepresentation.  In February, Mayorga alleged -- 
on behalf of residents of a peasant community in Bolivar 
Department -- that soldiers from the Antonio Narino Marine 
Infantry Battalion had killed three community residents and 
played a role in the disappearance of a thirteen-year-old boy 
in January.  Mayorga told us Fiscalia prosecutors have 
conducted themselves professionally and will decide whether 
to press formal charges by the end of the year.  Mayorga has 
been told his case is being followed closely by high-ranking 
officials in the Fiscalia and the Office of the Inspector 
General (\"Procuraduria\").  Mayorga expressed satisfaction 
with the Fiscalia\'s progress in investigating the alleged 
murders and forced disappearance.  Church officials have 
reassigned Mayorga from Bolivar Department to Bogota for 
security reasons.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On November 3, an Embassy official met with Father 
Joakin Mayorga, former director of the Roman Catholic 
Church\'s Social Ministry (\"Pastoral Social\") in the Diocese 
of Magangue, Bolivar Department.  Mayorga has been the 
subject of a Fiscalia investigation after two Army officers, 
including the commander of the Antonio Narino Marine Infantry 
Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Luis Fernando Rojas, accused 
him of criminal misrepresentation (ref A).  In February, 
residents of the community of Canonico, Bolivar Department, 
asked Mayorga to present to the Fiscalia their allegations 
that soldiers from the battalion had killed three peasants 
and played a role in the disappearance of a thirteen-year-old 
boy in January.  To date, the Fiscalia has not pressed 
charges against Mayorga. 
 
3. (SBU) Mayorga first met with Fiscalia investigators on 
August 26 to answer questions related to the officers\' 
accusations.  (The meeting had originally been scheduled for 
late June, but was postponed when Mayorga informed 
investigators of a schedule conflict.)  Mayorga was invited 
to a second meeting with investigators on September 17 to 
discuss the possibility of reaching a settlement with the 
military officers.  Although legally required to attend, 
neither officer was present for the meeting.  Fiscalia 
investigators suggested Mayorga issue a retraction in order 
to put the matter to rest.  He refused, citing his 
responsibility to members of the community of Canonico and 
his interest in seeing the perpetrators of the alleged 
murders and disappearance brought to justice.  Mayorga said 
he told Fiscalia investigators he was not personally accusing 
the military of any wrongdoing.  On October 18, Fiscalia 
investigators interviewed several community residents, 
including family members of the murder victims.  The case 
against Mayorga remains under investigation.  Prosecutors are 
expected to decide before the end of the year whether to 
charge Mayorga with criminal misrepresentation or close the 
investigation. 
 
4. (C) Mayorga said Fiscalia investigators conducted 
themselves in a respectful, professional manner and told him 
the case was being followed closely by Prosecutor General 
Osorio and high-ranking officials within the Procuraduria. 
Fiscalia investigators told Mayorga that both offices had 
expressed a special interest in resolving the case quickly 
and transparently.  (When Ambassador raised Mayorga\'s case 
with Vice-President Santos in August, Santos promised to look 
into the matter (ref B).)  Mayorga told us the Fiscalia\'s 
Human Rights Unit had launched an independent investigation 
into the alleged murders and forced disappearance and had 
already interviewed most of the victims\' family members. 
Mayorga was pleased the case was progressing quickly.  He 
also said the Procuraduria is conducting a disciplinary 
investigation to determine whether soldiers from the 
battalion were involved in the January incident.  Mayorga 
confided his suspicion that certain elements within the 
battalion actively cooperate with paramilitaries. 
 
5. (C) Mayorga said he had been reassigned to Bogota on 
October 1 after other priests and a bishop in the region 
began to receive threats from paramilitaries, who told the 
priests that they would be held responsible if Mayorga 
continued his \"subversive work\" in Bolivar Department. 
Mayorga, who has himself received similar threats over the 
past two years, said he protested the decision and feels he 
has abandoned the isolated communities in which he had worked.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, ENRG, EPET, CO 
SUBJECT: COLOMBIA WOULD BE FURTHER IN THE RED IF NOT FOR 
WINDFALL PROFITS FROM THE STATE OIL COMPANY 
 
 
Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary.  With oil trading at around USD 50 a 
barrel, Ecopetrol\'s windfall profits continue to rise.  GOC 
officials have stated privately that were it not for the 
record revenues of the state oil company, the GOC would not 
make its 2004 deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP.  End 
Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Increase in oil prices 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Betting conservatively, the GOC estimated that for 
2004 oil would sell at an average price of USD 25.1 per 
barrel due to the reincorporation of Iraq\'s oil into the 
world market and its predictions of increased oil production 
from Algeria, Lybia, Nigeria and the UAE.  The GOC thus 
estimated that Ecopetrol, the state oil company, would 
transfer USD 333 million to government coffers.  As oil 
prices rose, Ecopetrol recalculated its oil\'s reference price 
at USD 35 per barrel, netting a profit of USD 590 million as 
of June 2004.  With oil trading in the USD 45-50 range, 
Ecopetrol will likely recalculate the reference price once 
more before the year is over.  As a result, Ecopetrol\'s 
president, Isaac Yanovich, stated 2004 annual net profits 
could reach USD 770 million (a 39 percent increase from 
2003), depending on the WTI price of oil. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
A Sigh of Relief from the Ministry of Finance 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) The Finance Ministry hoped to achieve its 
IMF-mandated 2.5 percent of GDP fiscal deficit target through 
serious belt-tightening and a series of privatizations  The 
GOC also obtained the IMF\'s agreement to a 2.8 percent fiscal 
deficit target for 2004, in case its privatization program 
did not materialize.  The GOC managed to sell only 8 percent 
of ISA, the state-owned electric and transmission grid, and 
Transelca, another state-owned power distributor.  Its first 
attempt to sell the state-owned Coffee bank (Bancafe) failed 
when no bidders expressed interest.  The GOC was thus faced 
with severe spending cuts in order to meet the deficit 
target.  Luckily, Ecopetrol\'s windfall profits will allow the 
GOC to meet its initial target without needing such severe 
measures. 
 
---------------- 
Windfall Profits 
---------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Econoffs met with Dr. Javier Rondon, Deputy 
Director for National Finances, at the Ministry of Finance 
and Public Credit to discuss the current fiscal deficit. 
Rondon, as well as Dr. Juan Pablo Zarate, the Director for 
Macroeconomic Policy, stated categorically that without 
Ecopetrol\'s increase in revenues, primarily due to the 
increase in the price of oil, the GOC would not have met its 
2.5 percent deficit goal.  The GOC\'s 2004 financial plan 
initially estimated that Ecopetrol would contribute 0.3 
percent of GDP towards the fiscal deficit, but after revising 
Ecopetrol\'s numbers with the high price of oil, the GOC now 
estimates Ecopetrol\'s contribution at 0.6 percent of GDP. 
 
--------------- 
Looking Forward 
--------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Colombia\'s oil production dropped 2.5 percent in 
2004, while Ecopetrol (and the GOC\'s coffers) were saved by 
the dramatic increase in oil prices in 2004.  Efforts to 
correct the current fiscal situation, through tax and pension 
reform, are before Congress but have only begun their lengthy 
and treacherous course.  The GOC is championing an expansion 
of the value added tax (which currently only covers about 60 
percent of products), but Congress is not supporting the 
effort.  The GOC is also attempting pension reform, which is 
again very unpopular with the Congress.  Business groups are 
also protesting the GOC\'s annual tax reforms (three in three 
years) as being bad for the investment climate.  Despite a 
spate of new oil exploration contracts, Colombia\'s crude 
production could drop to the point where the country will 
become a net importer in 2008.

2. (U) In October, DOJ\'s Justice Sector Reform Program 
coordinated 25 training and technical assistance programs for 
820 police officers, 145 prosecutors and 110 judges.  The 
subjects of the programs were:  Basic Accusatory System; 
Crime Scene and Courtroom Testimony; Investigator as a 
Witness; Judicial and Dignitary Protection; Criminal Trial 
Advocacy; Judicial Workshop; Specialized Training for 
Criminal Behavior Units; Interview Techniques; Police 
Discipline, Ethics and Transparency; Financial Analysis and 
Data Base Management; and Firearms Inventory and Tracing. 
All of the programs emphasized the preparation of police 
agencies, prosecutors and judges for the implementation of a 
new criminal procedure code and its accusatory style system. 
DOJ also sponsored a trip to Arizona for nine Colombian 
trainers of prosecutors and judges to observe court 
proceedings and reinforce their understanding of an 
accusatory system.  DOJ also provided key speakers for the 
Colombian National Police (CNP) Criminal Symposium, and gave 
a briefing on the U.S. Patriot Act to Colombian business,

3. (U) On October 28, the several agencies of the GOC 
(Ministry of Defense, Presidencia, Colombian Army (COLAR), 
Colombian National Police (CNP), Fiscalia, National 
Directorate of Dangerous Drugs, and the Ministry of Interior 
and Justice) and Emboffs met to institutionalize a program of 
manual eradication brigades, or \"Grupos Mobiles de 
Erradicacion\" (GMEs).  President Uribe recently directed his 
Administration to prepare 30 GMEs by January 2005, to achieve 
the ambitious goal of eradicating 40,000 hectares of coca for 
the same year.  The GMEs will be made up of 30 individuals 
(either demobilized combatants, or civilians) who will uproot 
coca and poppy, mainly by hand.  The CNP and COLAR will share 
the responsibility for security, providing 6,300 CNP and 
COLAR personnel for GME laborer protection. 
 
4. (U) Emboffs reiterated the USG commitment to exploring 
manual eradication as a complement to spraying but reminded 
the attendees that the safest, most efficient, and cheapest 
way to eradicate coca and poppy is aerial spraying.  They 
also said the USG intends to increase investment in equipment 
and training to help protect personnel engaged in manual 
eradication.  Emboffs recommended that target areas for the 
GMEs should be chosen from areas where we cannot spray 
(because of cloud cover, winds, small fields, national parks, 
etc.), and should be selected based on security rather than 
politics.  Political considerations have been the dominant 
criteria for recent decisions to send manual coca eradication 
teams into Narino and Norte de Santander Departments. 
Embassy intends to provide logistical and other support for 
GME units that use civilian labor, but will have to balance 
unanticipated GOC funding requests against programmed 
bilateral counter-narcotics initiatives.

Director Michael Deal visited the Villagarzon Agro-Industrial 
Center in the department of Putumayo.  The Agro-Industrial 
Center processes Putumayo\'s various tropical crops including 
tropical wood, flowers and foliage, black pepper and other 
condiments, tropical medicines, culinary and aromatic plants, 
and dried cassava for animal feed.  The center was 
established to create the foundations for a new licit economy 
and transform the economic landscape in Putumayo.  The 
department\'s illicit coca-based economy has been dramatically 
reduced from 66,000 hectares in 2000 to approximately 7,500 
hectares in 2003.  In addition, USAID\'s Alternative 
Development Program has made a significant contribution to 
transforming the socio-economic situation of Putumayo by 
working with 290 indigenous and small farmer communities, and 
by providing economic and social benefits to 19,983 families 
through the establishment of over 27,840 hectares of licit 
crops. 
 
9. (U) Under its Anchor Company initiative, USAID\'s Colombia 
Enterprise Development Program (CED) provided US $100,000 
worth of technical assistance to C.I. LTC, a large textile 
and garment manufacturer located in Cali, Valle del Cauca. 
With this assistance the firm trained 260 new operators in 
the use of industrial machinery, placing them among satellite 
suppliers.  As a result of this activity, 27 new jobs have 
been created.  USAID also provided US $50,000 in technical 
assistance to Industrias Integradas, a textile and garment 
manufacturer in Cali, to improve productivity.  The 
assistance has generated an additional 36 new jobs in this 
industry.  To date, the CED Program has approved 51 SME 
project proposals geared toward generating additional 
employment and income in secondary cities connected to areas 
of illicit crop influence. 
 
10. (U) USAID and the Global Development Alliance (GDA), are 
providing funding of roughly US $1.7 million for programs to 
be implemented by VallenPaz and US $1.9 million for programs 
to be implemented by the Colombian Association of Flower 
Exporters (Asocoflores).  The USAID contribution will 
leverage another US $1.7 million for VallenPaz and US 
$850,000 for Asocoflores from local NGOs and the private 
sector.  The VallenPaz projects on \"Restorative Justice\" and 
\"Co-existence and Peace in Colombia\" seek to create 
restorative justice in Colombia through a series of 
activities.  The programs include the establishment of peace 
restoration centers in 12 municipalities in the departments 
of Cauca and Valle del Cauca, and an academic component 
regarding \"transitional justice\" issues.  The agreement 
signed between USAID and Asocolflores supports the 
\"Cultivating Peace in the Family\" program, a joint project 
that will help 21,000 workers by providing conflict 
resolution training and social and psychological assistance.

11. (C) On September 25-26, General Reynaldo Castellanos 
Trujillo, Commander JTF-Omega (JTF-O), assembled all of the 
mobile brigade commanders in Larandia for an operations 
review, the first time since the start of Plan Patriota (PP) 
IIB that all JTF-O commanders were together in one location. 
Each Mobile Brigade Commander gave a presentation on unit 
operations since the beginning of PP IIB, and each JTF-O 
staff section gave an overview of activities.  This was the 
first time all subordinate commanders were able to see an 
overview of JTF\'s combat operations.  General Carlos Alberto 
Ospina Ovalle attended the first four hours of the event and 
opened by stressing four points: 
 
-- That JTF-O was viewed as conducting operational and 
national campaigns, and civic actions for the COLMIL; 
 
-- The COLMIL must become more proficient on the use of 
psychological operations; 
 
-- Operations against the FARC must block/cut the mobility 
corridors that give the FARC tactical advantage; and 
 
-- COLMIL operations must be conducted against high value 
targets. 
 
12. (U) USMILGP, specifically the Air Force Mission, is 
working with COLAF to purchase two C-130 aircraft from 
Evergreen.  FMS case/LOR is being refined by all parties in 
Colombia.  USG recently learned that Hoover Aviation, a CONUS 
company, is attempting to purchase these aircraft before the 
COLAF can act, modify them and then re-sell the aircraft to 
the COLMIL at a higher price.  USMILGP is accelerating the 
LOR process here to purchase the C-130s as airlift remains a 
critical issue for the COLAF. 
 
13. (U) In meeting with MOD Uribe on October 14, the Minister 
and his staff refined his vision for \"Plan Shakespeare.\"  The 
concept is a long-term plan to create a bilingual office 
corps, to make English proficiency a prerequisite for 
promotion to field grade, and to establish a tiered language 
program that runs concurrently with officer professional 
development that offers baseline and sustainable training 
opportunities.  Conceptually, MILGP will work with the 
Ministry, COLMIL, Defense Language Institute and private 
language institutes to develop a plan to meet the MOD 
requirements.

SUBJECT: LIBERAL PARTY SANCTIONS NINE SENATORS FOR 
SUPPORTING REELECTION 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Jeffrey DeLaurentis, Reasons: 1.4 b 
 
1.  (U) On November 8, the Liberal Party suspended nine 
senators for ten months for breaking with the party\'s 
official position and voting in favor of legislation to 
permit Presidential reelection.  Internal party rules require 
members of Congress to vote the party line.  Prior to the 
move, the party had 29 senators of 102 total.  The 
suspensions affected several leading senators, including Luis 
Guillermo Velez, a former party head, and Victor Barco, one 
of the \"deans\" of the Congressional ranks and a relative of 
former President Virgilio Barco.  Velez has been outspoken in 
favor of presidential reelection and moving the party toward 
open support for President Uribe. 
 
2.  (C) Several leading Liberal officials, including 
immediate past party president Camilo Sanchez and 
Representatives William Ortega and Griselda Restrepo, told 
poloff that the length of the suspension was intended to 
prevent the nine senators from attempting to move the party 
toward open support for President Uribe\'s reelection at the 
next party assembly, scheduled for May 2005.  Uribe is 
himself a former member of the Liberal Party.  Poloff 
inquired if sanctions were planned for some 30 Liberal 
members of the House who voted for Presidential reelection in 
June.  Both Sanchez and Ortega said that no such disciplinary 
move would occur, as House members have been generally more 
discreet in their pro-reelection stances than the nine 
senators.  They added that Speaker Zulema Jattin, a Liberal, 
supports reelection, and her presence in the dissident 
Liberal group in the House make the likelihood of a similar 
sanction slim. 
 
3.  (C) While on the decline nationally, the Liberal Party 
nevertheless was the top overall vote getter in October 2003 
departmental and local elections and continues to control the 
majority of governorships and departmental assemblies. 
Current party leadership and former presidents Ernesto Samper 
and Cesar Gaviria want the party to run its own candidate for 
President in 2006.  Given those factors, the party 
disciplined several dissident, pro-Uribe members who openly 
broke internal party rules.

SUBJECT: OAS URGES MORE SUPPORT FOR AUC PEACE PROCESS 
 
 
1. (U) On November 9, OAS Mission Chief Sergio Caramagna, in 
charge of verifying the paramilitary peace process, publicly 
urged the international community to give more support to the 
government\'s plan to demobilize the United Self Defense 
Forces of Colombia (AUC).  In a statement to Colombia\'s 
leading newspaper El Tiempo, Caramagna said large sectors of 
the international community needed to re-think their 
skepticism about the process.  He said he had never seen a 
more conditioned peace process than the one with the AUC, and 
warned that without outside resources such a large 
demobilization might not be successful. 
 
2. (U) According to Caramagna, constant demands that AUC 
members guilty of major crimes be held accountable are a 
diversion because, since the onset of the process, the GOC 
has made clear that such individuals would not receive 
blanket amnesty and could not re-enter civil society without 
punishment.  Caramagna asserted that the international 
community should focus instead on the practical aspects of 
helping the government reinsert several thousand fighters.

SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT URIBE IN COLOMBIA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
------------ 
Introduction 
------------ 
 
1. (C) President Uribe welcomes the visit of President and 
Mrs. Bush with enthusiasm.  Current hot topics include: 
 
--Floods in Northern Colombia, more than 150,000 persons 
affected 
 
--Demobilization and reinsertion of up to 3,000 paramilitary 
terrorists in the next two months 
 
--U.S. support in out years 
 
--Free Trade Agreement negotiations; next round in Tuscon at 
the end of November could be crucial 
 
--Record-breaking drug eradication and seizures 
 
--Major judicial reform starting in January 
 
--Extradition 
 
--U.S. travel advisory and security in Cartagena 
 
--Continued shortage of helicopters for counter-drug and 
counter-terror missions 
 
--Status of U.S. hostages 
 
--Human rights 
 
--Alternative development and humanitarian assistance 
 
--------------------------- 
Floods in Northern Colombia 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Heavy rainfall has caused flooding in the north coast 
region, including the Cartagena area.  Some 200,000 persons 
have been affected and more than 300 homes destroyed. 
Through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, we are 
providing $150,000 in assistance to the Red Cross to help 
some 10,000 persons in the hardest-hit areas south of 
Cartagena. 
 
------------------------------ 
Demobilization and Reinsertion 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Colombia plans to demobilize 3,000 or so members of 
the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), the 
country\'s largest paramilitary terrorist organization, in the 
next six weeks, adding to the over 1,000 paramilitaries who 
demobilized in 2003.  The program is underfunded and the OAS 
verification chief has issued an international call for help; 
several European nations have responded with low levels of 
aid.  Uncertainty regarding Patriot Act restrictions has 
prevented direct U.S. assistance or involvement in design of 
the program.  President Uribe may seek U.S. assistance to 
help reinsert voluntarily demobilized ex-terrorists who are 
cooperating against their former organizations and otherwise 
adhering to the government\'s program.  This 
demobilization/reinsertion is expected to be the template for 
eventual demobilization of up to 15,000 paramilitaries by the 
end of 2005, and the leftist terrorists of the ELN, with whom 
preliminary talks are underway but going slowly. 
 
------------ 
U.S. Support 
------------ 
 
4. (C) As in past meetings, Uribe will be looking for private 
and public reaffirmations of U.S. support and continued 
financial resources for the next few years.  Requested U.S. 
assistance tops $660 million in FY05, plus a number of DOD 
operating accounts.  Special DOD assistance to Plan Patriota 
operations runs out after 2005. 
 
---------------------------- 
Free Trade Agreement/Economy 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement, with Peru and 
Ecuador, begin their fifth round on November 29 in Tuscon. 
President Uribe remains a strong proponent, but agricultural 
and other concerns, principally regarding pharmaceuticals, 
have prevented Colombia from moving as rapidly as it should. 
As a result, our goal of conclusion by early 2005 is 
uncertain.  Colombia hopes for special consideration for its 
close cooperation on counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism 
efforts.  Overall growth continues to be strong (about 4 
percent), and investment is returning.  But the country faces 
fiscal pressure, and President Uribe political pressure, from 
the competition for resources between defense and social 
needs, especially unemployment (currently 12.5 percent). 
 
----------------------------- 
Drug Eradication/Interdiction 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) FY04 drug eradication and interdiction are at record 
levels.  We should meet our 130,000-hectare goal for coca 
spraying and exceed last year\'s level for opium poppy. 
President Uribe is working to expand manual eradication 
efforts.  We continue to press for spraying in national parks 
in the face of Colombian and U.S. congressional resistance. 
Drug seizures are also at record levels.  In 2004 the 
Colombian National Police has seized approximately 56 metric 
tons; the Colombian military, primarily the navy and coast 
guard, approximately 68 metric tons; and a multi-national 
force approximately 192 metric tons.  Between eradication and 
seizures, more than 475 metric tons of drugs have been 
blocked in 2004, in comparison to about 300 tons in 2003. 
 
--------------- 
Judicial Reform 
--------------- 
 
7. (C) Colombia will switch to an oral adversarial trial 
system, like that of the U.S., in January.  We have provided 
extensive training and advice to this major reform; it is 
also a high priority among many in the U.S. Congress. 
President Uribe may request additional resources.  The 
Minister of Justice has requested that the justice sector 
rapidly/rapidly receive 50 percent of all Colombia-related 
drug assets that we seize; in the past, Colombia has received 
a smaller share, sometimes after years of delay. 
 
----------- 
Extradition 
----------- 
 
8. (C) President Uribe has approved since taking office more 
than 150 extraditions to the U.S.  He will likely ask for 
more political sensitivity in our extradition requests, as he 
and his ministers have done several times in the last year. 
Although Uribe is solid in his support, extradition faces 
political pressure from well-connected drug traffickers 
awaiting extradition and from paramilitary leaders involved 
in peace negotiations.  We are taking steps to avoid killing 
the golden goose.  Uribe may raise paramilitary leaders\' 
efforts to negotiate extradition at the peace table.  We have 
said that extradition should not be a topic in the 
negotiations, and not be addressed in any way before all/all 
demobilization steps are fulfilled by the paramilitary 
leaders, including peaceful demobilization of their troops. 
Uribe has agreed. 
 
------------------ 
Cartagena/Consular 
------------------ 
 
9.  (C) The U.S. travel advisory warns against all travel to 
Colombia.  President Uribe may ask for a cut-out for 
Cartagena, so cruise ships, a potential major source of 
tourist revenue, can enter.  Cartagena has not seen a 
terrorist incident for two years, has special safeguards for 
cruise ship tourists (no incidents have been reported for 
European cruise ship tourists), and has a better security 
record than many Latin American capitals.  Although we resist 
a cut-out for Cartagena, we are working to revise the travel 
advisory for Colombia as a whole, and the State Department 
head of security will visit Cartagena at the end of November. 
 
---------------------- 
Plan Patriota/Military 
---------------------- 
 
10. (C) The Colombian Armed Forces has made steady progress 
against illegal armed groups since the late 1990s, thanks in 
large part to U.S. assistance.  Plan Patriota is currently 
focused in FARC-dominated, heavily forested southeastern 
Colombia; it is going well, but slowly.  The logistical 
strain of keeping 17,000 troops in the dense, hostile jungle, 
hundreds of miles from their supply bases, has been a huge 
challenge.  Poor inter-service cooperation, corruption, and 
tolerance of paramilitarism continue, but they are improving, 
most recently with good changes in senior military 
leadership.  There continues to be competition for scarce 
helicopters between counter-drug and counter-terrorism 
missions.  President Uribe may ask for additional Blackhawk 
helicopters. 
 
---------- 
Reelection 
---------- 
 
11. (C) Constitutional reform to permit Presidential 
re-election is near completion; we believe it is probable. 
The reform will face review by the Constitutional Court early 
next year, a wild card.  The press may seek a U.S. view on 
re-election.  Although we can praise President Uribe, we 
should avoid comment on re-election, which could be played as 
\"interference in domestic affairs.\"  Uribe is above 65 
percent approval in polls. 
 
------------ 
Human Rights 
------------ 
 
12. (C) The Uribe Administration continues to make progress 
in human rights, but has not been completely successful in 
ensuring accountability, strengthening the military justice 
system, in breaking military ties to paramilitary groups, or 
in ending corruption.  The government has an active dialogue 
with NGOs, the United Nations, and foreign governments. 
Human rights training is mandatory for all members of the 
military and police.  The Embassy vets all units that receive 
U.S. assistance, in accordance with the Leahy Amendment. 
Homicides fell by 20 percent, kidnappings by 30 percent, and 
forced displacements by 49 percent in 2003; that trend has 
continued in 2004.  Less than 2 percent of human rights 
violations are attributable to government security forces. 
But recent violations by members of the armed forces, such as 
the suspicious murders in August of three trade unionists in 
the highly conflictive department of Arauca, demonstrate the 
need for further improvement. 
 
------------- 
U.S. Hostages 
------------- 
 
13. (C) The three U.S.-contractor hostages captured by the 
FARC in February 2003 are now the longest U.S. terror 
captives in the world.  (Another U.S. contractor and a 
Colombian were killed by the FARC in the same incident, when 
their helicopter safely crash-landed due to mechanical 
failure near a FARC camp.)  Plan Patriota operations have 
increased the likelihood that we will receive more 
information about the hostages, but also that an unintended 
encounter between Colombian forces and the hostage holders 
will result in their execution.  The Colombians are providing 
full assistance, both to keep us informed and to avoid 
unplanned encounters that might endanger the hostages.  The 
U.S. publicly has counseled against negotiations with the 
FARC for any of its dozens of hostages, to avoid providing an 
incentive for further hostage-taking.  We have supported 
Uribe\'s proposals for an exchange of hostages for FARC 
prisoners not accused of violent crimes provided that the 
FARC prisoners are prevented from returning to terrorist 
activities; so far the FARC has refused.  Uribe has assured 
us that the U.S. hostages will be included in any possible 
exchange. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Development, Humanitarian, Judicial Reform 
------------------------------------------- 
14. (C) Alternative development, humanitarian aid, and 
democracy programs are going well.  We have leveraged 
substantial private sector assistance to establish 270 square 
miles of legal agriculture benefiting 40,000 families.  U.S. 
aid has helped nearly 2 million internally displaced persons. 
 Colombia has the largest displaced population outside Africa.

SUBJECT: PEACE COMMISSIONER DESCRIBES DEMOBILIZATION DETAILS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
------ 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On November 12, Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos 
Restrepo reviewed for the Ambassador recent developments in 
demobilizing the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) 
and clarified key steps in the process.  Restrepo\'s principle 
concern is that without adequate security, the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) could occupy AUC areas and 
gain access to key mobility corridors and coca growing areas, 
especially in the conflictive Catatumbo region.  Meanwhile, 
the Catatumbo Bloc has submitted a list of names and 
identification numbers of those who will demobilize and the 
GOC has selected a demobilization zone.  The GOC is beginning 
to receive lists, select demobilization zones, and prepare 
security for other AUC groups scheduled to demobilize before 
the end of the year. 
 
2. (C) Restrepo detailed parts of the demobilization process: 
 
- Monitoring: He asserted that monitoring former 
paramilitaries\' behavior was key to the process\' legitimacy 
but emphasized that local government and police had to 
cooperate with him. 
 
- Identification:  Restrepo will consider issuing each 
individual demobilizing a provisional identification card 
when they enter the demobilization zone. 
 
- Interviews: Each demobilized paramilitary is required to 
report to a local reinsertion center to be interviewed by the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office (Fiscalia), with whom he must 
cooperate.  If this does not happen, the individual would not 
be pardoned for having belonged to an illegal armed group and 
would be arrested. 
 
- Renunciation: Before leaving the demobilization zone, each 
individual is required to sign two documents: one renouncing 
membership in an illegal armed group and the other requesting 
pardon for the crime of sedition.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
Security Biggest Challenge 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Restrepo said his biggest concern was securing the 
Catatumbo region in Norte de Santander Department, where 
1,400 paramilitaries are scheduled to demobilize in the 
coming weeks.  He explained that the AUC controls territory 
around the Catatumbo River thereby depriving the FARC of a 
key mobility corridor into Venezuela.  The security forces\' 
presence is minimal.  The Navy does not patrol the Catatumbo 
River and there is no police or military presence west of the 
river, where the government estimates there are 1,800 
hectares of coca.  Restrepo is worried that without patrols 
on the river and an increased presence on the ground, the 
FARC would occupy the former AUC territory, especially the 
coca-growing areas.  Restrepo would like at least four Navy 
patrol boats on the river and aerial and manual eradication 
of coca. 
 
4. (C) Restrepo warned that a FARC takeover of the 
demobilized region would de-legitimize the peace process and 
strengthen the AUC\'s negotiating position.  AUC Commander 
Salvatore Mancuso has already threatened to halt 
demobilization if the government cannot prevent the FARC from 
taking over Catatumbo.  Restrepo hoped the U.S. could provide 
support for security, but noted that he had not yet discussed 
this idea with President Uribe. 
 
5. (C) In a subsequent conversation, Ambassador raised 
Restrepo\'s concern about Catatumbo with Armed Forces 
Commander General Ospina and Navy Commander Admiral Soto. 
Both already were aware of the issue, and promised at least 
some level of action.  We will follow up. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Some Zones Identified, Lists Submitted 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Restrepo described recent progress: 
 
-- Catatumbo: The Catatumbo Bloc, led by a retired Police 
Captain \"Camilo Catatumbo,\" submitted a list of 1,400 members 
to demobilize, including 900 full names and cedula (national 
identification document) numbers.  The Fiscalia, Department 
of Administrative Security (DAS, rough FBI equivalent), 
police, and military intelligence have begun researching the 
names.  The Bloc also submitted a list of weapons, which 
includes 470 rifles, 350 pistols, and several machine guns. 
A two-hectare demobilization zone about 28 kilometers from 
the town of Tibu has been selected (reported in the press on 
November 14).  During the week of November 15, the government 
will prepare the zone\'s infrastructure.  The publicly 
announced target date of November 29 for formal 
demobilization will probably be pushed back a week or two. 
 
 -- Uraba: The government has identified a demobilization 
zone but the AUC groups operating in Uraba have not submitted 
a list.  The AUC\'s territory in Uraba is relatively 
controllable, and Restrepo has been working closely with the 
Army\'s 17th Brigade to develop a strategy to protect it.  The 
police have a permanent presence in much of the region.  The 
only potential problem area is the Nueva Antioquia region 
where the FARC and AUC have competed for control. 
 
-- Valle and Valle del Cauca: The Calima Bloc is scheduled to 
demobilize there but has not submitted a list and the 
government has not identified a demobilization area. Restrepo 
is concerned about security because the FARC has a strong 
presence and could regain key mobility corridors. 
 
-- Cordoba: Mancuso submitted a list of several hundred names 
and cedula numbers.  Restrepo expects his biggest challenge 
to be winning public trust.  The population there generally 
believes the AUC is needed for its safety and has little 
faith in state security forces. 
 
-- Llanos (eastern plains): Since AUC Centauros Bloc 
Commander Miguel Arroyave was killed and the independent Self 
Defense Forces of Casanare (ACC) have suffered heavy military 
blows, the region has become more stable and less violent. 
However, demobilization of the AUC groups is complicated. 
The Centauros Bloc has broken into two groups, one led by 
\"Mauricio,\" a former guerrilla, in the north and the other 
led by \"Jorge Pirata\" and \"Cuchillo\" in the south.  AUC 
commander Miguel Mejia, who is in Santa Fe de Ralito, offered 
to demobilize the 300-member Vencedores of Arauca but 
insisted that his twin, Pablo Mejia, be included in the 
demobilization.  Both brothers are major drug traffickers and 
Restrepo has refused to let Pablo participate in the 
demobilization.  The paramilitaries and the FARC groups 
operating on the eastern plains are deeply involved in drug 
trafficking, making any demobilization complicated. 
 
------------------------------ 
Law for Justice and Reparation 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) After the GOC\'s last draft of the Law for Justice and 
Reparations was completed in April under the supervision of 
the Peace Commissioner\'s Office, Restrepo asked President 
Uribe to put the Ministry of Interior and Justice in charge 
of the bill.  Given the AUC\'s dislike of the legislation, 
Restrepo said negotiating with the AUC and being responsible 
for the law put him in too difficult a position.  Restrepo 
has not seen Senator Rafael Pardo\'s version of the law.

---------- 
 
8. (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s comment that close 
monitoring of the demobilized paramilitaries was key to 
preventing paramilitaries from returning to criminal 
behavior, Restrepo said he needed the local governments and 
security forces to cooperate with him.  He expressed 
frustration with the Medellin city government\'s reluctance to 
punish or even publicize crimes carried out by demobilized 
members of the Cacique Nutibara Bloc (BCN).  To prevent 
similar problems in future demobilizations, Restrepo\'s office 
hired a police Colonel to help coordinate demobilizations 
with local police units. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Identification, Investigation, and Renunciation 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
9. (C) Restrepo agreed with the Ambassador\'s suggestion that 
each paramilitary be given a provisional identification card 
upon entering the demobilization zone. 
 
10. (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s concern that each 
demobilized member be interviewed by the Fiscalia, Restrepo 
clarified that the former paramilitaries are not pardoned for 
rebellion until they speak with the Fiscalia at the 
government-controlled reinsertion centers.  Upon leaving the 
demobilization zone, each former paramilitary is required to 
report to a local reinsertion center.  At these centers, the 
Fiscalia interviews each former paramilitary, dental records 
are taken to verify identity, a pardon for sedition is issued 
after a thorough investigation by the Fiscalia, and each 
individual enrolls in reinsertion programs.  Any former 
paramilitary who fails to report to one of these centers or 
cooperate with the Fiscalia\'s investigation can and will be 
arrested for having belonged to an illegal armed group. 
Restrepo also is creating an intelligence team that will 
interview the paramilitaries while still inside the 
demobilization centers. 
 
11. (C) Restrepo underscored that before leaving the 
demobilization zone, each paramilitary is required to sign 
two documents: one renouncing his/her membership in an 
illegal armed group and pledging not to return to criminal 
behavior and one requesting pardon for rebellion against the 
state.  Without signing these documents, the individual is 
not eligible for reinsertion benefits.

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, for reasons

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On November 10, Minister of Defense Uribe announced 
changes to the Armed Forces high command: Armed Forces 
Commander General Ospina and all the service chiefs except 
Army Commander Major General Carreno will remain in their 
positions.  Carreno will retire.  Joint Task Force Omega 
Commander Major General Castellanos will replace Carreno and 
Director of Operations of the Joint Staff Major General 
Fracica will replace Castellanos.  Embassy has good relations 
with the commanders who will remain, as well as with 
Castellanos.  The choice of Castellanos was a victory for 
jointness and cooperation among services, a high Embassy 
priority.  Fracica is an aggressive, results-oriented 
commander but has sometimes been reluctant to work closely 
with us and tends to be hard on his subordinates.  End 
Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Preliminary Changes Announced 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) On November 10, President Uribe announced preliminary 
changes to the Armed Forces High Command.  Armed Forces 
Commander General Ospina, Navy Commander Admiral Soto, Air 
Force Commander Major General Lesmez, Police Commander Major 
General Castro, and Chief of the Joint Staff Major General 
Padilla will remain in their current positions.  Army 
Commander Major General Carreno will retire.  Joint Task 
Force Omega (JTFO) Commander Major General Castellanos, 
currently in charge of Plan Patriota, will replace Carreno. 
Director of Operations of the Joint Staff Major General 
Fracica will replace Castellanos as JTFO Commander.  The 
deputy commanders of all three services are expected to 
retire.  Changes to lower level officers will be announced 
later in the year or in January. 
 
---------------- 
Focus on Results 
---------------- 
 
3. (C) President Uribe\'s decision to keep Ospina and all but 
one of the service commanders indicates his satisfaction with 
their results and trusts them to continue to deliver.  We 
enjoy excellent relations with Soto, Lesmez, and Ospina. 
 
4. (C) Carreno\'s departure was a victory for MOD Uribe, who 
had to convince President Uribe to replace the aggressive but 
volatile and Army-centric Carreno.  His departure should 
alleviate counterproductive inter-service competition.  In 
contrast to Carreno, Castellanos is skilled at joint 
operations and his appointment to Army Commander should close 
the breach between the Army and the rest of the services, 
including the police.  We also expect our relationship with 
the Army to improve.  While Carreno was often reluctant to 
share information with us, Castellanos has been a valuable 
interlocutor throughout his time as JTFO Commander and in his 
prior position as the Army\'s 5th Division Commander. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Plan Patriota Loses Talented Leader 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Castellanos showed impressive results in leading Plan 
Patriota Phase 2A in Cundinamarca Department and the 
still-ongoing Phase 2B in southeastern Colombia.  Fracica had 
been angling for several months for the JTFO command and is 
already well up to speed on Plan Patriota.  However, he is 
hard on his subordinates and can be slow to use actionable 
intelligence.  As Joint Staff Director for Intelligence, he 
was sometimes difficult for us to work with and made public 
remarks critical of the U.S.

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) On November 16, Defense Minister Jorge Uribe requested 
a meeting with the Ambassador to explain an article in El 
Nuevo Herald that claimed he had made a conjugal visit to a 
woman imprisoned in Medellin.  The woman, Dora Adriana Alzate 
Restrepo, was arrested and sentenced to nine years in jail 
when authorities found heroin in her suitcase bound for Miami 
in the Medellin airport in February 2003.  Uribe told the 
Ambassador that he had had a ten-year, personal relationship 
with Alzate, whom he met while he was president of Delima 
Marsh and she worked for an associate company.  On the day of 
her arrest, Uribe and Alzate were traveling separately to the 
U.S. from Medellin and were chatting in the airport. Alzate 
was detained by security and Uribe boarded the plane unaware 
of her fate.  After her arrest, Uribe said that he visited 
her in prison once and spoke with her on the telephone once. 
He emphasized he had no prior knowledge of her drug 
trafficking activities and has not had any contact with her 
since becoming Minister.  Uribe subsequently called the 
Ambassador back to tell him that he had talked to President 
Uribe, who had given him full support. 
 
2. (C) Uribe said that he wanted to present the facts 
directly to the Ambassador so there would be no questions 
between them.  The MOD is one of our strongest allies in 
combating drug trafficking.  The Ambassador told Uribe that 
his private life was none of the Embassy\'s business, that his 
record on drugs, as far as the U.S. was concerned, was 
perfect, and that the Embassy continued to have the highest 
confidence in him.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Ambassador Valencia, the Mexican facilitator for talks 
between the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the GOC, 
briefed the Ambassador on recent communications between the 
two sides on November 16.  On October 8, the ELN offered to 
meet with the GOC in Mexico but demanded the GOC provide a 
helicopter and aircraft for the visit, prevent INTERPOL from 
taking action against them, and release imprisoned commander 
\"Francisco Galan\" (Gerardo Bermudez) for the talks.  The GOC 
responded by repeating its condition for a unilateral 
cease-fire before any meeting, but with the condition that it 
could be a temporary cease-fire.  It also asked the ELN to 
clarify whether it was asking for a humanitarian accord to be 
followed by a cease-fire, and whether it would be willing to 
meet with the GOC in the Mexican Embassy in Bogota after 
declaring a temporary cease-fire.  Valencia said the ELN 
would respond negatively and expressed frustration that the 
talks could be reaching a breaking point.  As Valencia\'s 
principle interlocutor was the imprisoned Galan, the 
Ambassador encouraged Valencia to try to gain wider access to 
the ELN leadership.  He said the U.S. was willing to support 
a legitimate peace process, would not press the GOC to 
jeopardize the process with the paramilitaries and eventually 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) by making 
too many concessions to the ELN, and urged Valencia to 
publicly blame the ELN if talks were to break down.   End 
Summary. 
 
----------------- 
ELN Makes Demands 
----------------- 
 
2. (C) On November 16, Mexico\'s Ambassador Valencia, who 
facilitates talks between the ELN and the GOC, briefed the 
Ambassador on recent communications between the two sides. 
On October 8, the ELN Central Command (COCE) proposed a 
meeting with the GOC in Mexico but demanded that the GOC 
provide a helicopter and aircraft for the visit, prevent 
INTERPOL from taking any action against them, and release 
imprisoned ELN commander \"Francisco Galan.\"  Valencia 
explained that the COCE had been upset by government comments 
following the leaked conversations between Peace Commissioner 
Restrepo and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) 
(reftel).  The COCE continues to resist being labeled and 
treated as a terrorist group rather than a \"legitimate\" rebel 
group, being equated to the AUC, and being subjected to jail 
sentences for major crimes. 
 
---------------- 
The GOC Response 
---------------- 
 
3. (C) Last week, the GOC responded to the ELN, reiterating 
its condition of a unilateral cease-fire before any meeting. 
If the ELN agreed, the GOC would be willing to hold talks and 
consider the ELN\'s political demands.  The GOC also requested 
two clarifications: (1) Is the ELN asking for a sequence in 
which a humanitarian accord would be followed by a 
cease-fire? and (2) Would the ELN be willing to meet with the 
GOC and Valencia in the Mexican Embassy in Bogota following a 
declaration of a temporary cease-fire? 
 
------------- 
Prospects Dim 
------------- 
 
4. (C) The ELN has not issued a response yet but Valencia 
understands that the ELN will not accept even a temporary 
cease-fire because it fears setting a precedent of requiring 
a cease-fire before any meeting.  Valencia expressed 
frustration at the impasse and predicted that the talks could 
be near a breaking point.  Valencia\'s abilities are further 
limited because the imprisoned Galan may not accurately 
represent the COCE\'s mindset.  Without a peace deal, Galan 
remains in jail, making him a willing interlocutor but not 
necessarily a good COCE spokesman.  Valencia admitted that he 
did not know the views of the COCE members. 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador encouraged Valencia to try other 
channels to access the COCE.  Author Gabriel Garcia Marquez 
has been involved in outreach to the ELN and could have 
better access.   The Embassy will not pressure the GOC to 
soften its conditions any more than it already has, 
especially regarding the conditions of a cease-fire, jail 
time, and other elements of importance to the paramilitary 
(and eventual FARC) processes, but was prepared to help a 
legitimate peace process in other ways, including the use of 
the residence for a meeting between the COCE and GOC.  (Note: 
The Ambassador did not/not offer his participation in any way 
in the talks themselves.)  The Ambassador noted that if 
communications were to break down completely, Valencia should 
publicly blame the ELN\'s intransigence. 
 
6. (C) Comment: The GOC has been flexible and committed to 
starting a peace process with the ELN without standing down 
on the requisite cease-fire.  The ELN, meanwhile, does not 
appear to know what it wants out of talks or if it is even 
serious about negotiating.  End comment.

1. (U) The following is an update of Plan Colombia-related 
activities reported during November 2004. 
 
-------- 
DOJ/JSRP 
-------- 
 
2. (U) The Justice Sector Reform Program (JSRP) coordinated 
several training courses during November.  They included the 
following: \"Investigator as a Witness\" (in Bogota, Medellin, 
Cali, Bucaramanga, Pereira, Tunja and Manizales); \"Criminal 
Trial Advocacy ) Judge\'s Training\" (in Bogota for 40 
judges); \"Criminal Trial Advocacy\" (two courses in Bogota for 
120 prosecutors and 60 investigators); \"Police Discipline, 
Ethics, and Transparency\" (in Bucaramanga for 40 Police 
Commanders); an \"Expert Witness Course\" (in Bogota for 20 
laboratory forensic examiners); and a \"Train the Trainer\" 
course (in Bogota for 35 potential new 
prosecutors/instructors of the Criminal Trial Advocacy 
program). 
 
3. (U) JSRP also coordinated an observational visit to U.S. 
Courts in Washington D.C. for 12 prosecutors and one judge; 
set up an oral trial presentation and simulation at the 
Twelfth National Congress of Legal Medicine and Forensic 
Science for 200 forensic experts and medical examiners; sent 
4 Colombian justice officials to the DOJ Cyber Crime Regional 
Workshop in Lima, Peru; and completed a one-week expert 
evaluation of the status of Colombia\'s evidence rooms and 
evidence procedures. 
 
---------- 
DOJ/ICITAP 
---------- 
 
4. (U) During the week of November 1, ICITAP sponsored the 
visit of chief medical examiners from Wayne County, Michigan, 
and Cook County, Illinois.  They gave presentations at the 
12th Annual Forensic Science Conference on the role of the 
medical examiner\'s office in the accusatory justice system. 
The presentations included a \"mock trial\" practical exercise. 
 
5. (U) In November, ICITAP provided the equipment and 
technical assistance to start a wireless fingerprint network 
within and between the National Police - DIJIN and the 
Institute for Legal Medicine.  The network will allow 
investigators at a crime scene to send fingerprints obtained 
at the scene via a wireless transmission to the Police 
Fingerprint Archive.  The Institute can now also wirelessly 
transmit the fingerprints of unidentified cadavers to the 
Police Fingerprint Archive for possible identification.  The 
system should reduce the time for fingerprint examinations, 
especially in critical cases involving human rights abuses 
and violent crimes. 
 
6. (U) In November, ICITAP conducted \"Investigator as a 
Witness\" training for all Judicial Police Investigators in 
Armenia, Quindio Department.  So far this year, ICITAP has 
trained 385 Judicial Police Investigators.  In December, 
ICITAP will complete training in Pereira, Risaralda 
Department, and Manizales, Caldas Department.  The training 
is designed to help the Judicial Police transition to the 
accusatory system of justice that will be implemented in 
Bogota, Armenia, Pereira, and Manizales in January 2005. 
 
-------- 
MILGROUP 
-------- 
 
7. (C) Colombian Military Commander General Ospina said that 
following changes among the Flag-Grade Officers he will 
establish a joint command on the north coast consisting of 
the First Division, Caribbean fleet assets, Combatant Air 
Commands, and riverine elements.  The command will be led by 
an army commander, probably the division commander.  General 
Ospina is also planning to create three joint entities in the 
capital region: a joint intelligence command, a joint 
MEDEVAC/Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) unit, and the Joint 
Special Operations Command.  He will name a General Officer 
to head each organization and is considering appointing 
General Freddy Padilla de Leon as their first line reporting 
General Officer.  Ospina will staff the joint Special 
Operations Command with one General Officer, three colonels, 
five lieutenant colonels, and 13 other officers and 
non-commissioned officers.  The command will be located on 
the grounds of the Infantry or Cavalry School. 
 
8. (C) Brigadier General Gustavo Matamoros Camacho said that 
Civil Affairs/PSYOPS activities are beginning to change 
civilian perceptions of the military throughout Arauca. 
Support actions by battalion commanders, such as Lieutenant 
Colonel Francisco Medina Corredor in Saravena, are gaining a 
civilian support base.  Activities like Medical Readiness 
Training exercises, soccer games/tournaments sponsored by and 
on military installations, children\'s activities and parties, 
and radio broadcasts and military-civilian contact are 
beginning to show results. The mayor of Saravena, who won the 
election while jailed under suspicion of being a member of 
the ELN, is now working closely with Lt. Col. Medina to 
affect change with the population of Saravena.  The efforts 
of the deployed Special Forces Operation Detachment Alpha in 
assisting with recent activities were highlighted by both 
BGen Matamoros and Lt. Col. Medina as being force 
multipliers.  BGen Matamoros has forged a strong relationship 
with the Governor of Arauca and both realize that 
civil-military cooperation in Arauca is a long term project 
that must be sustained by the GOC and COLMIL.  Discussions at 
the Second Division in Bucaramanga also indicated that the 
Information Operations campaign was as effective as military 
operations in neutralizing the influence of illegal armed 
groups. 
 
9. (C) A COLAF commander signed a sole source justification 
letter to accompany a letter of request for pricing and 
availability on two C-130 aircraft for sale by Evergreen 
Aircraft Sales and Leasing Company.  The paperwork was 
submitted via security assistance channels.  The most 
effective method for the COLAF to acquire these systems is 
through security assistance funding and acquisition.  A 
third-party company, Hoover Aviation, may purchase the 
C-130s, then perform maintenance/avionics upgrades, and 
re-sell them to the COLAF.  This acquisition will increase 
the strategic lift fleet by 25 percent.

10. (U) Asset forfeiture has long been a torturously 
bureaucratic and ineffective process in Colombia, reserved 
only for the strongest cases against major narcotics 
traffickers.  In a little-noticed September press conference 
in the Department of Santander, President Uribe announced 
that in cases involving the cultivation of illicit narcotics, 
asset seizure and forfeiture would be applied to small farms 
as well as large ones.  Since that announcement, the 
Colombian National Police (CNP) have taken several steps to 
make the President\'s warning a reality.  The CNP currently 
has plans to implement the asset forfeiture process as a 
potent complement to forced eradication. 
 
11. (U) On November 24, the SIJIN (Judicial and Investigative 
Police) conducted a workshop on asset forfeiture and seizure 
to brief Boyaca municipal police units on legal requirements 
for building strong cases.  These include firm identification 
of title and possession of the plot, proper chain of custody 
techniques for crop samples, testing by an established 
criminal laboratory, and coordination with several GOC 
agencies, including the Fiscalia, Direccion Nacional de 
Estupifacientes (DNE - Colombia\'s \"Drug Czar\" equivalent 
agency), and the Augustin Codazzi Geographic Institute.  NAS 
is working with departmental police -- who are now manually 
eradicating coca in western Boyaca -- to start an asset 
forfeiture case in each coca-growing municipality.  NAS and 
the CNP District Commander for the zone recently met with 
police units and local mayors to explain the program and NAS 
will soon be providing GPS units and other equipment to 
facilitate the process.  GOC-led manual eradication projects 
underway in Llorente (Narino) and Orito (Putumayo) also plan 
to start at least one case in each area to alter the 
risk/reward ratio for illicit crop growers. 
 
12. (U) Through leaflets and radio interviews, the CNP is 
spreading the word that land seizure awaits any who risk 
planting coca on their land.  Examples of actual cases in 
each growing region will undoubtedly be the most effective 
force multiplier, and may even result in growers uprooting 
their own crops in advance of the arrival of law enforcement. 
 Post has previously reported on the many drawbacks of manual 
eradication, which include hazardous, difficult working 
conditions and a tempo that is unable to outpace replanting. 
Post will encourage the GOC to incorporate an active, 
strategic asset forfeiture program into manual eradication 
programs so that the CNP garners some advantage from an 
inherently risky activity.

13. (U) VIP Personal Protection Program:  Weapons for this 
program have been received and will be distributed to the 
personal protection details of the President, Vice President, 
Minister of Defense, and the Mayor of Bogota.  Some will be 
held back for training purposes. 
 
14. (U) Anti-Kidnapping Initiative:  Ten persons assigned to 
GAULA units completed a two-week \"train the trainer\" course 
and will be assistant instructors when Crisis Response 
Training (CRT) commences in early January.  Dates for the 
next CRT course have not been confirmed at this time, but it 
will probably take place in early January 2005.

15. (U) Ambassador Wood and Foreign Minister Barco formalized 
the FY04 obligation of USD 116.7 million in USAID 
humanitarian and socio-economic assistance.  To date, the USG 
has allocated a total of USD 458 million, including USD 123 
million to support a more responsive and accountable 
democracy, USD 206 million to promote economic and social 
alternatives to illicit crop production, and USD 129 million 
to provide economic and social opportunities to displaced 
persons and members of other vulnerable groups. 
 
16. (U) Under its Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) program, 
USAID is assisting the Colombian government with the design 
of a contingency plan to support former child combatants in 
the event of large-scale demobilizations.  Training for local 
authorities has been undertaken in eight municipalities and 
will eventually cover at least five additional localities. 
To date, USAID has assisted over 2,000 former child 
combatants through activities such as psychological 
counseling, education, and vocational skills development. 
 
17. (U) USAID Alternative Development Program partner Land O\' 
Lakes signed a grant agreement for USD 100,000 with a local 
cooperative, COLANTA, to establish milk collection centers 
(MCCs) in the municipalities of Yarumal, Valdivia, Briceno, 
Caceres, Taraza, and Caucasia in the Bajo Cauca region of the 
department of Antioquia.  In the initial phase, 20 MCCs will 
be established with a daily average capacity of 750 liters 
each.  Each tank will serve between two and ten producers on 
nearby farms.  The average investment per MCC is USD 5,000, 
of which 80 percent will be financed directly by program 
beneficiaries through bank loans facilitated by the GOC\'s 
Agricultural and Livestock Financial Fund (FINAGRO).  The 
remaining 20 percent will be financed with grant resources 
from USAID\'s Dairy Development Program.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN 3RD QUARTER GDP GROWTH MISSES THE MARK 
 
 
1.   (U) SUMMARY. The GOC released 2004 Q3 GDP figures 
showing a sluggish 2.43 percent growth rate.  GOC forecasts 
had predicted a 3.9 percent increase.  Colombia\'s expected 
2004 GDP growth rate of 4 percent can now only be achieved if 
Q4 GDP growth reaches 5 percent or higher.  These numbers are 
disappointing to Colombian government economists, and the 
GOC, through the Colombian press has come out with multiple 
explanations. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   (U) Colombian government officials expressed concern 
over lower growth figures; however, they explained their 
inability to meet the 4.1 percent target as being a result of 
multiple variables.  Economists at the Central Bank and the 
National Planning Department (DNP) told econoff that the 
lower numbers are due to supply shocks caused by a truckers 
strike in September and October. In addition, Central Bankers 
noted that public investment in the third quarter was low. 
Colombia is currently experiencing a change of governments at 
the local level and local governments are currently in a 
period of renewing contracts, which constrains regional 
investment.  Officials at DANE, the National Statistics 
Department, have said that a slow down in the farming, coal 
and oil sectors is responsible for the low numbers. 
 
3.  (U) COMMENT: As it struggles to explain what went wrong 
with Q3 GDP figures, the GOC is also looking for explanations 
that do not frighten potential investors. END COMMENT.

 1. (U) Summary: On December 2, Embassy Bogota and the 
Ministry of Defense co-sponsored the third annual Public 
Forces and Journalism Seminar to improve military-media 
communication.  Almost one hundred media and Armed Forces 
members (including the police) attended the meeting in Paipa, 
Boyaca Department.  Participants commented that discussions 
helped reduce mutual suspicion and hostility, but open 
communication remains a distant goal.  Military attendees 
criticized the press for skewing stories negatively, 
portraying guerrillas in a positive light, and ignoring 
advances of the Armed Forces against insurgents.  Press 
attendees claimed that the military restricted and concealed 
information, ostracized reporters who disagreed with them, 
and used the media for free propaganda against guerrilla 
groups.  Both sides welcomed the opportunity to air their 
concerns and improve relations.  End summary. 
 
 
Military Urges More Positive Stories, Downplays Negative 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2. (SBU) Keynote speaker Minister of Defense (MOD) Jorge 
Uribe summarized military and police accomplishments over the 
last months.  He announced that the military would welcome a 
one-day personnel swap between the Armed Forces and press to 
improve mutual understanding.  Other military representatives 
including Vice Minister of Defense Andres Penate and police 
Public Affairs Liaison Col. Jairo Agudelo commented that the 
press influenced public opinion in important and sometimes 
erroneous ways.  As an example, Agudelo showed a series of 
press headlines on safety in Bogota.  Clippings dating back 
to 1996 cited Bogota as the most dangerous city in the 
hemisphere.  Other headlines told of the public\'s fear of 
crime but then changed to reflect an improving situation, 
ending with accounts of the city\'s impressive security record 
and citizens feeling secure.  Agudelo claimed that they were 
all exaggerated and demonstrated that the press directly 
influenced the public\'s view of security and therefore 
affected the armed forces\' ability to work. 
 
3. (U) Military representatives asserted that their chain of 
command structures and national safety concerns contributed 
to the lack of communication with the press.  Younger 
officers added in breakout sessions that they often were 
prohibited from commenting on high-profile military criminal 
cases like Guaitarilla, Cajamarca and Arauca (reftels A, B, 
and C) since the military did not want such cases debated by 
the public.  Officers added that no one wanted to \"give the 
enemy an advantage\" in the conflict by damaging the 
military\'s morale or reporting strategies to the press.  They 
also noted some details were classified and could not be 
released to the press.  Panelists reiterated their 
frustration with some in the media who presented sympathetic 
stories on the guerrillas and portrayed the military in a 
negative light.  They dubbed such stories \"unpatriotic\" and 
claimed they prompted the Colombian public to sympathize with 
illegal terrorists.  As an alternative, Vice Minister Penate 
urged the press to produce more news stories on the 
demobilization and reinsertion process.  Such \"good news\" 
pieces could help bridge the communication gap. 
 
Media Requests More Understanding and Transparency 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (SBU) Jaime Abello Banfi, President of the Antonio Narino 
Project, offered the press perspective and praised the 
previous two conferences for improving understanding.  Daniel 
Fernando Patino of Caracol news agreed with Abello\'s comment 
on institutional culture clashes and said the military only 
wanted positive news items.  He asserted that reporters were 
routinely made \"persona non grata\" for contradicting military 
counterparts.  Maria Teresa Ronderos of the Free Press 
Foundation added that reporters were dependent upon military 
escorts for protection in combat zones.  This put reporters 
in the precarious position of either reporting the military 
perspective or taking chances by going unescorted.  When 
Penate requested further demobilization and \"good news\" 
coverage, some participants countered that the military 
wanted the news to be a supplemental, free psychological 
operation in rural areas against insurgent groups. 
 
5. (U) In the breakout session, media representatives urged 
their military counterparts to accept that reporting was not 
an issue of patriotism.  Reports should be factual and inform 
the public.  Patino added that public comments during the 
immediate aftermath of the Arauca case only underscored the 
unreliability of official sources in unflattering military 
situations.  MOD Uribe agreed that it was important for the 
military to check facts before speaking to the press, but 
asserted that it was critical to stand by one\'s staff and 
believe in its abilities.  The media representatives conceded 
that some press colleagues pushed aggressively, advanced an 
agenda, or otherwise deluded the public at times. 
Nevertheless, panelists stressed that greater transparency 
and information sharing with the press would be critical to 
improving relations and the military\'s profile in the press. 
 
Suggestions to Make Progress 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Both military and media participants suggested 
exchanges and ongoing dialogue to close the communication 
gap.  Abello suggested that the civilian MOD and vice 
ministers serve as interlocutors to promote greater 
understanding.   Alvaro Sierra, an editor with El Tiempo, 
recommended that both sides agree to basic rules of 
interviewing and review other nations\' military-press 
relationship.

SUBJECT: COUNTER DRUG BRIGADE SHUTS DOWN TWO HCL LABS IN 
GUAVIARE 
 
1. (SBU) On November 26 and 27, elements of the Plan 
Colombia-supported Counter Drug (CD) Brigade captured two 
FARC cocaine hydrochloride (HCL) labs during Operation 
Hurricane in Guaviare department. 
 
2. (SBU) The first lab, in the Vaupes river/Miraflores area, 
had two chemical recycling vats (marcianos) and 30 microwave 
ovens.  The lab had an estimated peak capacity of 10 metric 
tons of cocaine HCL per month.  At the second lab, which was 
in the same general area, the CD Brigade captured chemicals 
and equipment for processing and packaging cocaine HCL. 
 
3. (SBU) Through analysis of the location and description of 
the lab, CD Brigade Intelligence Officer determined that the 
first captured lab had been identified in January, 2004.  At 
that time the informant was taken to the United States and 
was not available to lead an assault on target. Another 
informant subsequently led the CD Brigade to the lab. 
 
4. (SBU) Thus far this year the CD Brigade has captured or 
destroyed 10 cocaine HCL labs and seized 76 kgs of cocaine 
HCL and 538 kgs of cocaine base.

Summary 
------- 
 
3. (C) WHA DAS Shapiro, INL PDAS Farrar, and Ambassador Wood 
called on President Uribe on December 15.  Uribe expressed 
gratitude for U.S. counternarcotics and counterterrorism 
assistance, but shared his concern that record levels of 
seizures and eradications have not had an effect on prices in 
Europe and the U.S.  Uribe noted that Colombia\'s illegal 
armed groups have been seriously weakened by GOC military 
pressure and, like the paramilitaries, both the FARC and the 
ELN will opt for peaceful negotiations within the next five 
years.  Uribe stressed the importance of human rights in GOC 
policies and pledged to continue dialogue with NGOs.  He also 
promised to review key human rights cases, including 
Guaitarilla, Cajamarca, and Mapiripan, with the MOD.  Uribe 
agreed to clarify the GOC\'s positions and implementation 
plans for demobilization by presenting a series of key points 
to the international community.  Uribe commented on his 
difficult position with regard to Venezuela and Brazil and 
promised to look into Colombia\'s voting position on human 
rights in the UN.  Despite the Supreme Court\'s wait-and-see 
attitude on extraditions, Uribe affirmed his full support for 
continued extraditions.  End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
Counternarcotics 
---------------- 
 
4. (C) President Uribe expressed appreciation for U.S. 
assistance, noting that without U.S. support Colombia would 
not have the ability to fight guerrilla or paramilitary 
groups, both of which are financed by narcotics trafficking. 
Farrar thanked Uribe for his Government\'s efforts against 
illegal armed groups and pledged continued support for 
counternarcotics efforts.  Uribe asked Farrar for the USG\'s 
assessment of counternarcotics programs in Colombia and 
expressed concern that, although seizures and crop 
eradication figures are at record high levels, the price of 
cocaine has not increased.  Uribe noted that a failure to 
show results would lead to greater pressure for legalization 
or funding cuts.  Wood observed that there is not enough data 
on actual narcotics supply in the U.S. or quantities of 
narcotics in the \"pipeline,\" which limits our ability to 
explain the lack of tangible results on the streets of the 
U.S. 
 
--------------------- 
Prospects for Success 
--------------------- 
 
5. (C) In response to a question, Uribe said Colombia\'s 
illegal armed groups cannot resist an additional five years 
of military pressure.  Refusing to promise concrete dates and 
noting the importance of being a realist, Uribe pledged to 
continue to pressure illegal armed groups.  Paramilitaries 
are not negotiating simply because they want peace, but 
because of the military pressure the Government has applied 
and their fear of extradition to the U.S.  Uribe speculated 
that splinter groups of narcotrafficking organizations will 
follow in the wake of the paramilitaries and observed that 
destroying those groups will require a military solution. 
Uribe said that the ELN has been significantly weakened and 
is seeking a political solution.  Uribe estimated the FARC 
have lost about 40 percent of their military capacity and had 
only a limited capacity to recruit new members.  Uribe 
speculated that the FARC would agree to negotiate if he wins 
re-election, but added he would continue to caution the 
public to not expect quick results.  DAS Shapiro told Uribe 
the U.S. would continue to support the GOC\'s efforts.  Uribe 
agreed on the importance of sustaining efforts to improve 
security and increase public confidence in Government 
institutions. 
 
------------------------- 
Coordination and Advances 
------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Uribe noted that cooperation with the U.S. has been 
extraordinary, citing several recent captures of guerrilla 
leaders, including the FARC\'s \"Foreign Minister,\" Rodrigo 
Granda Escobar (septel).  Shapiro said he had been impressed 
with USG-GOC coordination during his visit to San Jose de 
Guaviare and congratulated Uribe on his efforts to increase 
the state\'s presence throughout the country.  Uribe said he 
had observed a greater commitment from the armed forces to 
address corruption and collusion with paramilitaries.  He 
also noted that the number of allegations of collusion 
continues to drop. 
 
------------ 
Human Rights 
------------ 
 
7. (C) Shapiro stressed the importance of continued work on 
human rights.  Uribe reaffirmed his commitment to human 
rights, noting the central role they play in his efforts. 
Shapiro noted the importance of continued dialogue with NGOs. 
 Uribe acknowledged the tense nature of many of his 
discussions with NGOs, but agreed continued dialogue is 
important.  The Ambassador recognized improvements on human 
rights, but stressed the importance of progress on several 
key human rights cases that are followed carefully by 
Congress and NGOs, including Guaitarilla, Cajamarca, and 
Mapiripan.  On Guaitarilla, Wood stressed the importance of a 
transparent, public judicial investigation with effective 
results, adding that an internal disciplinary process was not 
sufficient.  Uribe agreed to review the case with the MOD. 
 
8. (C) On Mapiripan, Farrar said that Fiscalia pressure on 
Orozco and the persistence of unresolved human rights cases 
impede the Administration\'s efforts with Congress.  Uribe 
stressed he only has the ability to guarantee military 
justice, noting that Colombia\'s judicial system is 
independent of the executive branch.  Uribe noted that the 
latest generals\' promotion list contained no individuals 
accused of human rights abuses or collusion.  Wood expressed 
U.S. interest in General Avila\'s dismissal, stating that it 
was not sufficient simply to remove him from command and 
reassign him.  Wood stressed the importance of thorough 
investigations of all allegations.  Uribe asked if there was 
direct evidence implicating Avila.  Uribe agreed that Avila 
would have to be retired if there was sufficient evidence 
against him, but cautioned that the Government cannot dismiss 
an officer on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations. 
Uribe promised to follow up with the MOD. 
 
--------------------------- 
Paramilitary Demobilization 
--------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Shapiro and Wood encouraged Uribe to be more active in 
communicating the GOC\'s position on the Law for Justice and 
Reparations, noting that the GOC\'s silence had allowed their 
opponents to frame the debate and created confusion in 
Washington and European capitals.  Uribe stressed the 
importance of balancing peace and justice, but added that the 
GOC was slowly resolving differences with members of the 
opposition in Congress.  He also stressed the importance of 
legislation that would apply to paramilitaries and guerrillas 
equally, noting that many guerrillas would not agree to the 
lengthy prison sentences included in the opposition\'s draft 
legislation.  Uribe agreed that the GOC would draft a series 
of key points, including criteria and an implementation 
process, to present to the international community in order 
to clarify the GOC\'s position. 
-------------------- 
Venezuela and Brazil 
-------------------- 
 
10. (C) Uribe said he had discussed Chavez with President 
Bush in Cartagena.  He described the difficulties of 
balancing Colombia\'s friendship with the U.S. with the 
importance of maintaining positive relations with his 
neighbors.  The absence of evidence proving that Chavez stole 
the elections and Chavez\'s private assertion that he has no 
relationship with the FARC or narcotraffickers makes it 
difficult to condemn him publicly, despite Uribe\'s private 
distrust of Chavez and his belief that Chavez may be helping 
the FARC and narcotics traffickers.  In bilateral meetings, 
Uribe\'s criticisms have focused on Chavez\'s failure to take 
action against narcotraffickers.  Uribe also told Chavez in 
Cuzco that he is not helping himself by taking a 
confrontational position with the U.S.  On Brazil, Uribe said 
his relationship with Lula is complicated by Lula\'s effort to 
build an anti-U.S. alliance in Latin America.  Lula is more 
practical and intelligent than Chavez, but is driven by his 
leftist background and Brazilian \"imperial spirit\" to oppose 
the U.S.  Uribe has little influence with either Lula or 
Chavez because they see him as a friend of the U.S.  Uribe 
said he would continue to press Chavez to take action against 
narcotraffickers and noted that Lula has not followed through 
on promises to fight narcotics trafficking. 
 
--------------------- 
OAS Secretary General 
--------------------- 
 
11. (C) In response to a question, Uribe said the GOC wanted 
to support the candidacy of former President of El Salvador 
Flores for Secretary General of the Organization of American 
States (OAS), but cautioned that Flores would have to ratchet 
up his public relations effort.  (Mexican Foreign Minister 
Derbez, presumably visiting to advocate his own candidacy, 
was the next visitor on Uribe\'s schedule.) 
 
--------------------- 
UN Human Rights Votes 
--------------------- 
 
12. (C) Shapiro said he did not understand the GOC\'s 
abstentions on key human rights votes in the UN involving 
Cuba, Zimbabwe and Sudan.  In particular, he asked the 
President to oppose possible upcoming no-action motions in 
the UNGA plenary on Iran and Turkmenistan.  Uribe asked MFA 
Americas Division Director Francisco Gonzalez if the GOC had 
in fact abstained on earlier votes and promised to review the 
matter with the MFA. 
 
----------- 
Extradition 
----------- 
 
13. (C) In response to a question on extradition, Uribe 
explained that the Supreme Court of Justice had taken a 
wait-and-see position in the wake of a statement -- and 
despite the later retraction of this statement -- by an 
Assistant U.S. Attorney in Miami that Gilberto Rodriguez 
Orejuela would be tried for acts committed during the past 20 
years, contrary to USG assurances that he would not be tried 
for acts committed before 1997 (reftel).  Uribe affirmed his 
commitment to extradition and expressed confidence that the 
matter would be resolved in the near future.

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.4 (b)

1.  (C) Summary. Post has no objection to Ex-Im Bank\'s 
financing of a Boeing 767-300F cargo aircraft for Tampa 
Airlines based on currently available information.  Embassy 
recommends that Ex-Im proceed with caution, however, based on 
results of a recent meeting between DEA and Tampa Airlines 
and Tampa\'s subsequent cooperation.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Embassy officers have evaluated the progress of Tampa 
Airlines as a result of a November 10 meeting between Tampa 
Airlines\' president, general counsel, U.S. lawyer and 
MartinAir Holland\'s lawyer and DEA and ECON officials. 
During that meeting, DEA Bogota outlined major concerns with 
Tampa Airlines, specifically Tampa Airline\'s noncompliance 
with Colombian and DEA law enforcement activities.  Tampa\'s 
president, Fred Jacobsen, said he was unaware of this 
situation but adamantly stated he and Tampa Airlines would 
comply with any requirements DEA and the Colombian police 
have with Tampa Airlines.  Jacobsen acknowledged that Tampa\'s 
executive management control had been disconnected from 
Tampa\'s airport ground control personnel and stated he will 
personally monitor ground control operations in the future so 
that meaningful improvements will be implemented immediately 
to yield positive results in security.  DEA responded that 
although this new company position was encouraging, future 
action would be the final factor in determining meaningful 
results. 
 
3.  (C) Subsequent to the November 10 meeting, Tampa Airlines 
has made marked improvements in cooperating with the 
Colombian Anti-Narcotics police as well as with DEA Bogota. 
To improve ground control operations, Tampa Airlines has 
contracted an outside security firm to analyze its security 
operations in Cali in an effort to combat drug smuggling on 
Tampa airplanes. 
 
4. (C) It appears that USG scrutiny, especially Ex-Im\'s 
decision to delay financing for Tampa, resulted in Tampa\'s 
new cooperative attitude.  Although, at present, Tampa 
Airlines is willing to cooperate, Post recommends future 
dealings between USG agencies and Tampa Airlines take into 
account the continued level of cooperation Tampa Airlines is 
providing.

gratitude for U.S. counternarcotics and counterterrorism 
assistance, but shared his concern that record levels of 
seizures and eradications have not had an effect on prices in 
Europe and the U.S.  Uribe noted that Colombia\'s illegal 
armed groups have been seriously weakened by GOC military 
pressure and, like the paramilitaries, both the FARC and the 
ELN will opt for peaceful negotiations within the next five 
years.  Uribe stressed the importance of human rights in GOC 
policies and pledged to continue dialogue with NGOs.  He also 
promised to review key human rights cases, including 
Guaitarilla, Cajamarca, and Mapiripan, with the MOD.  Uribe 
agreed to clarify the GOC\'s positions and implementation 
plans for demobilization by presenting a series of key points 
to the international community.  Uribe commented on his 
difficult position with regard to Venezuela and Brazil and 
promised to look into Colombia\'s voting position on human 
rights in the UN.  Despite the Supreme Court\'s wait-and-see 
attitude on extraditions, Uribe affirmed his full support for 
continued extraditions.  End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
Counternarcotics 
---------------- 
 
4. (C) President Uribe expressed appreciation for U.S. 
assistance, noting that without U.S. support Colombia would 
not have the ability to fight guerrilla or paramilitary 
groups, both of which are financed by narcotics trafficking. 
Farrar thanked Uribe for his Government\'s efforts against 
illegal armed groups and pledged continued support for 
counternarcotics efforts.  Uribe asked Farrar for the USG\'s 
assessment of counternarcotics programs in Colombia and 
expressed concern that, although seizures and crop 
eradication figures are at record high levels, the price of 
cocaine has not increased.  Uribe noted that a failure to 
show results would lead to greater pressure for legalization 
or funding cuts.  Wood observed that there is not enough data 
on actual narcotics supply in the U.S. or quantities of 
narcotics in the \"pipeline,\" which limits our ability to 
explain the lack of tangible results on the streets of the 
U.S. 
 
--------------------- 
Prospects for Success 
--------------------- 
 
5. (C) In response to a question, Uribe said Colombia\'s 
illegal armed groups cannot resist an additional five years 
of military pressure.  Refusing to promise concrete dates and 
noting the importance of being a realist, Uribe pledged to 
continue to pressure illegal armed groups.  Paramilitaries 
are not negotiating simply because they want peace, but 
because of the military pressure the Government has applied 
and their fear of extradition to the U.S.  Uribe speculated 
that splinter groups of narcotrafficking organizations will 
follow in the wake of the paramilitaries and observed that 
destroying those groups will require a military solution. 
Uribe said that the ELN has been significantly weakened and 
is seeking a political solution.  Uribe estimated the FARC 
have lost about 40 percent of their military capacity and had 
only a limited capacity to recruit new members.  Uribe 
speculated that the FARC might begin to negotiate if he wins 
re-election, but added he would continue to caution the 
public to not expect quick results.  DAS Shapiro told Uribe 
the U.S. would continue to support the GOC\'s efforts.  Uribe 
agreed on the importance of sustaining efforts to improve 
security and increase public confidence in Government 
institutions. 
 
------------------------- 
Coordination and Advances 
------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Uribe noted that cooperation with the U.S. has been 
extraordinary, citing several recent captures of guerrilla 
leaders, including the FARC\'s \"Foreign Minister,\" Rodrigo 
Granda Escobar (septel).  Shapiro said he had been impressed 
with USG-GOC coordination during his visit to San Jose de 
Guaviare and congratulated Uribe on his efforts to increase 
the state\'s presence throughout the country.  Uribe said he 
had observed a greater commitment from the armed forces to 
address corruption and collusion with paramilitaries.  He 
also noted that the number of allegations of collusion 
continues to drop. 
 
------------ 
Human Rights 
------------ 
 
7. (C) Shapiro stressed the importance of continued work on 
human rights.  Uribe reaffirmed his commitment to human 
rights, noting the central role they play in his efforts. 
Shapiro noted the importance of continued dialogue with NGOs. 
 Uribe acknowledged the tense nature of many of his 
discussions with NGOs, but agreed continued dialogue is 
important.  The Ambassador recognized improvements on human 
rights, but stressed the importance of progress on several 
key human rights cases that are followed carefully by 
Congress and NGOs, including Guaitarilla, Cajamarca, and 
Mapiripan.  Wood stressed the importance of a transparent, 
public judicial investigation with effective results, adding 
that an internal disciplinary process was not sufficient. 
Uribe agreed to review the cases with the MOD. 
 
8. (C) On Mapiripan, Farrar said that Fiscalia pressure on 
Orozco and the persistence of unresolved human rights cases 
impede the Administration\'s efforts with Congress.  Uribe 
stressed he only has the ability to guarantee military 
justice, noting that Colombia\'s judicial system is 
independent of the executive branch.  Uribe noted that the 
latest generals\' promotion list contained no individuals 
accused of human rights abuses or collusion.  Wood expressed 
U.S. interest in General Avila\'s dismissal, stating that it 
was not sufficient simply to remove him from command and 
reassign him.  Wood stressed the importance of thorough 
investigations of all allegations.  Uribe asked if there was 
direct evidence implicating Avila.  Uribe agreed that Avila 
would have to be retired if there was sufficient evidence 
against him, but cautioned that the Government cannot dismiss 
an officer on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations. 
Uribe promised to follow up with the MOD. 
 
--------------------------- 
Paramilitary Demobilization 
--------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Shapiro and Wood encouraged Uribe to be more active in 
communicating the GOC\'s position on the Law for Justice and 
Reparations, noting that the GOC\'s silence had allowed their 
opponents to frame the debate and created confusion in 
Washington and European capitals.  Uribe stressed the 
importance of balancing peace and justice, but added that the 
GOC was slowly resolving differences with members of the 
opposition in Congress.  He also stressed that the 
legislation would apply to paramilitaries and guerrillas 
equally, noting that many guerrillas would not agree to the 
lengthy prison sentences included in the opposition\'s draft 
legislation.  Uribe agreed that the GOC would draft a series 
of key points, including criteria and an implementation 
process, to present to the international community in order 
to clarify the GOC\'s position. 
-------------------- 
Venezuela and Brazil 
-------------------- 
 
10. (C) Uribe said he had discussed Chavez with President 
Bush in Cartagena.  He discussed the difficulties of 
maintaining a workable relationship with Chavez.  The absence 
of evidence proving that Chavez stole the elections and 
Chavez\'s private assertion that he has no relationship with 
the FARC or narcotraffickers makes it difficult to condemn 
him publicly, despite Uribe\'s private distrust of Chavez and 
his belief that Chavez may be helping the FARC and narcotics 
traffickers.  In bilateral meetings, Uribe\'s criticisms have 
focused on Chavez\'s failure to take action against 
narcotraffickers.  Uribe also told Chavez in Cuzco that he is 
not helping himself by taking a confrontational position with 
the U.S.  On Brazil, Uribe said his relationship with Lula is 
complicated by Lula\'s effort to build an anti-U.S. alliance 
in Latin America.  Lula is more practical and intelligent 
than Chavez, but is driven by his leftist background and 
Brazilian \"imperial spirit\" to oppose the U.S.  Uribe has 
little influence with either Lula or Chavez because they see 
him as a friend of the U.S.  Uribe said he would continue to 
press Chavez to take action against narcotraffickers and 
noted that Lula has not followed through on promises to fight 
narcotics trafficking. 
 
--------------------- 
OAS Secretary General 
--------------------- 
 
11. (C) Shapiro pressed Colombia to strengthen its support 
for former President of El Salvador Flores for Secretary 
General of the Organization of American States (OAS).  Uribe 
said the GOC supported his candidacy, but cautioned that 
Flores would have to ratchet up his campaign.  (Mexican 
Foreign Minister Derbez, presumably visiting to advocate his 
own candidacy, was the next visitor on Uribe\'s schedule.) 
 
--------------------- 
UN Human Rights Votes 
--------------------- 
 
12. (C) Shapiro said he did not understand the GOC\'s 
abstentions on key human rights votes in the UN involving 
Cuba, Zimbabwe and Sudan.  In particular, he asked the 
President to oppose possible upcoming no-action motions in 
the UNGA plenary on Iran and Turkmenistan.  Uribe promised to 
review the matter with the MFA. 
 
----------- 
Extradition 
----------- 
 
13. (C) In response to a question on extradition, Uribe 
explained that the Supreme Court of Justice had taken a 
wait-and-see position in the wake of a statement -- and 
despite the later retraction of this statement -- by the U.S. 
Attorney in Miami that Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela would be 
tried for acts committed during the past 20 years, contrary 
to USG assurances that he would not be tried for acts 
committed before 1997 (reftel).  Uribe affirmed his 
commitment to extradition and expressed confidence that the 
matter would be resolved in the near future.

TAGS: PGOV, CO 
SUBJECT:  NEW DEVELOPMENTS ON REELECTION 
 
REF: Bogota 12290 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  Congress has reformed the Constitution 
to permit presidential reelection.  Implementing 
legislation is pending for the upcoming session.  Legal 
challenges are likely.  A showdown between two high courts 
is also a possibility.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) On December 14, the Senate and House both passed 
by large margins the conference committee version of 
legislation to permit presidential reelection (two terms 
maximum, consecutive or staggered).  The conference 
version (faxed to WHA/AND) produced a new twist, however, 
and poloffs followed up by consulting on legal and 
procedural issues with the House Speaker, the Secretaries 
General of both houses, and numerous members of Congress, 
one an immediate past magistrate of the Constitutional 
Court. 
 
3.  (U) The legislation completed eight rounds of 
debate/vote in both houses of Congress earlier this month 
(reftel).  The Constitution at this point is considered 
amended.  The next step, which must take place during the 
next session of Congress, March-June 2005, is passage of 
implementing legislation, which requires majority votes in 
both houses.  Once the Congress passes implementing 
legislation, the Constitutional Court would then have 
three months to review that legislation (a mandatory 
requirement).  It is worth noting that at this point any 
individual or party can legally challenge the 
Constitutional reform. 
 
4.  (U) The conference committee version of the 
legislation added a new twist, however.  The text 
stipulates that if either: 
 
A) The Congress fails to pass implementing legislation by 
June; or 
B) The Constitutional Court declares eventual implementing 
legislation null and void; 
 
Then the 27-member Council of State (Consejo de Estado) 
would be instructed to issue implementing legislation 
within two months of either of the above two events.  This 
has generated controversy in media and political circles. 
Another important aspect of the legislation is that 
sitting governors and mayors may run for president or vice 
president in 2006 provided they resign their current post 
one year prior to the presidential election, scheduled for 
May 2006. 
 
5.  (SBU) The legal foundation of the Council of State 
fallback option is subject to much debate.  Senator Carlos 
Gaviria, a former Constitutional Court magistrate, 
questioned the move and told poloffs on December 17 that 
in any eventual showdown between the Constitutional Court 
and Council of State the former would likely prevail.  In 
addition, leading daily El Tiempo ran an article on 
December 16 in which several former members of the Court 
and Council were interviewed regarding the fallback 
option.  None were in agreement about whether the 
provision was insurmountable on legal grounds. 
 
6.  (SBU) Comment:  Given Uribe\'s high approval rating and 
the wide margins of passage of the legislation, it is 
probable that the Congress will pass implementing 
legislation in the next session and that the fallback 
option will not be necessary.

STATE PASS TO USTR 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EPET, PGOV, PREL, CO 
SUBJECT: COLOMBIA INSTITUTES CAPITAL CONTROLS ON INVESTORS 
 
1.   (U) SUMMARY. President Uribe announced in an evening 
press conference on December 14 that Colombia would be 
instituting capital controls investments entering Colombia. 
This move comes after a year-long appreciation of the peso 
(14 percent over the past year) and a three day period just 
before the decision in which the peso appreciated 3 percent. 
While it is still too soon to determine what the long term 
effects of this move will be, investors agree that the 
controls will do little to change the positive macro 
environment in Colombia. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.    (U)  Decree 4210, signed by the Minister of the 
National Planning Department, the Minister of Finance, the 
Minister of Commerce and the President, forces investors to 
keep their money in Colombia for at least one year.  The 
decree comes after what one Central Banker says was intense 
pressure from the export lobby for the government to 
intervene.  Export lobbyists argue that up to 20,000 jobs 
have been lost in the past few months as a result of a fall 
in revenues from exports hurt by the strong peso.  This 
argument stands in stark contrast to Colombia\'s current 
unemployment rate of 12.5 percent, down from 17 percent at 
the beginning of 2004.  In addition, Colombian exports have 
risen dramatically this year, creating a USD 723 million 
trade surplus, which is up from a total year trade deficit of 
USD 192 million in 2003. 
 
3.   (U)  On the Presidential website, Uribe states, 
\"Colombia wants to give a clear signal that Colombia is ready 
to receive serious capital that is established and for 
investment, but we can\'t permit that speculative capital in 
the short run comes into Colombia and endangers our exchange 
rate.\"  In the aftermath of this decision, multiple investors 
have told econoffs that the effects will be limited; however, 
many seem ready for more intervention in the future.  There 
is a general expectation that a Tobin tax, a tax on 
investments coming in and out of the country, is possible. 
While future reforms may cause some concerns to investors, a 
Deutsche Bank representative told econoff that investors 
looking at credit risk are more concerned about delays in the 
passage of pension and tax reforms than the appreciation of 
the peso. 
 
4.   (U)  While the peso has appreciated against the dollar, 
it has not greatly appreciated against other regional 
currencies. In addition, the peso did not appreciate in 2003, 
which leads many analysts to assume that it was undervalued 
as the year began.  A Citigroup report values the peso at 
just above its 12 year average and still very far below highs 
in 1997.  The peso continued to appreciate against the dollar 
the day after the decree was signed. 
 
5.   (U)  Experts have offered many reasons as to why dollar 
inflows and  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) have increased 
since last year.  From January to June of 2004, FDI increased 
73 percent from 2003 numbers.  These increased dollar inflows 
are the likely outcome of improved security and an economy 
recovering from a recession.  Investors are more willing to 
invest in a politically and economically stable country. 
Remittances, which totaled USD 3 billion last year, have also 
put upward pressure on the peso.  The high price of oil 
(petroleum exports January to July in 2004 were USD 2.8 
billion vice petroleum exports for the same period of in 2003 
which were USD 1.9 billion) has also brought dollars into 
this oil exporting country.  Higher coffee prices are another 
factor pushing the peso upward. 
 
6.  (U) COMMENT. Colombia\'s capital control decree was issued 
in response to intense political pressure from exporters, 
including the sensitive agricultural sector.  Exporters may 
be concerned about the \"double whammy\" of a lower-priced 
dollar and the opening of Colombia\'s market to U.S. goods via 
the forthcoming Free Trade Agreement.  As we move closer to 
signing an FTA, Colombian exporters, especially in the 
agricultural sector, may view government intervention to 
weaken the peso as the only solution to this perceived 
threat.  END COMMENT

1. (U) On December 20, the GOC reiterated its willingness to 
revoke its extradition order against Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC) Commander Ricardo Palmera (aka 
\"Simon Trinidad\") if the FARC releases 63 hostages, including 
the three U.S. contractors, before December 30.  The GOC 
expanded on the proposal by offering to meet with members of 
the FARC in a church in any part of the country to finalize 
the prisoner release, but only if the FARC first releases a 
preliminary group of hostages.  The Roman Catholic Church of 
Colombia would be responsible for the FARC members\' safe 
passage to and from the proposed meeting.

Begin translation: 
 
The government reiterates its willingness to revoke the 
extradition of Simon Trinidad if, before December 30, the 
FARC releases 63 kidnapped Colombians and foreigners. 
 
The government is willing to meet immediately with the FARC 
in any church, rural or urban, in the country, if they first 
release a preliminary group of hostages as a gesture of good 
will.  The meeting\'s only purpose would be to perfect the 
agreement to facilitate the release of all 63 hostages before 
December 30. 
 
The movement of the members of the FARC to the meeting place 
and their return would be carried out under protection from 
the Church of Colombia.

Summary 
------- 
 
3. (C) Restrepo told DAS Shapiro that the peace process with 
the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) was going 
well and that the Calima Bloc in Valle Department was next to 
demobilize.  AUC strongmen Salvatore Mancuso, Vicente 
Castano, and Hernan Hernandez have become allies of the peace 
process.  Restrepo agreed that it was important to have a 
legal framework for the process but said the GOC would wait 
until February to present its version of the Law for Justice 
and Reparations.  It is trying to avoid a long, drawn-out 
national debate on the law.  Restrepo also said the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) would not 
negotiate until they suffer a serious military defeat.  The 
GOC authorized Mexican facilitator Ambassador Valencia to 
invite the National Liberation Army (ELN) Central Command 
(COCE) to meet with him in Mexico without GOC participation 
provided they halt all violence during the meeting.  Valencia 
expects the COCE to agree. 
 
------------------------------ 
AUC Demobilizations Going Well 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Restrepo told DAS Shapiro that the recent 
demobilization of the Catatumbo Bloc in Norte de Santander 
Department was a success.  The group turned in over 1,000 
weapons, 150 farms, and 57 houses and commercial outlets. 
However, the threat of a FARC resurgence in the area remains 
real.  In order to guarantee state control of the Catatumbo 
region, Restrepo said the government needs: 
 
- Aerial eradication in the mountainous, FARC controlled 
coca-growing region in Catatumbo.  The GOC estimates there 
are 3,800 hectares of coca including 800 in the Bari national 
park.  Eradication in the formerly AUC-controlled plains of 
Catatumbo has been successful.  (Embassy is reviewing our 
coca estimates and spray plans for the region.) 
 
- At least four Navy patrol boats on the Catatumbo River; 
 
- One to two helicopters for aerial coverage; and 
 
- 42 kilometers of paved roads and about 50 kilometers of 
secondary dirt roads 
 
5. (C) The Calima Bloc in Valle del Cauca Department has 
begun concentrating and is scheduled to formally demobilize 
on December 19.  This would bring the total demobilized in 
2004 to approximately 2,500. 
 
6. (C) AUC strongmen Salvatore Mancuso, Vicente Castano, and 
Hernan Hernandez have become government allies in the peace 
process.  Castano, who is the behind-the-scenes powerbroker 
of the AUC, called Restrepo to tell him personally that he 
had decided to support the peace process.  Mancuso and 
Hernandez are demobilizing the blocs they command.  However, 
AUC \"narcoparas\" Diego Murillo and Jorge Tovar Pupo are 
trying to stall demobilization and view Mancuso as a traitor. 
 Restrepo has tried to take advantage of internal AUC 
dissention since the onset of the process.  He explained 
that, although the AUC has talented advisers, they are poor 
negotiators when left alone at the negotiating table.  This 
allowed Restrepo to convince the AUC to sign the July 15, 
2003 agreement to demobilize all their troops by the end of 
2005.  In response to Shapiro\'s question about local support 
for the AUC, Restrepo explained that the rural elites in 
areas such as Cordoba, Magdalena, and Uraba believe the AUC 
are necessary for their safety.  Local elites fear the 
government does not have the capacity to prevent the FARC 
from returning after the AUC demobilizes.  These are areas 
plagued by FARC violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
 
------------------------------ 
Law of Justice and Reparations 
------------------------------ 
7. (C) Restrepo agreed that it was important to have a legal 
framework to deal with demobilized paramiltaries who are 
charged with major crimes.  The GOC plans to present its 
version of the Law of Justice and Reparations in February, 
possibly during the G-24 London conference follow-on in 
Cartagena.  Senator Rafael Pardo wrote his own draft of the 
law to counter the GOC\'s version.  Restrepo explained that 
the GOC had four main concerns about Senator Pardo\'s version: 
 
- Pardo\'s draft requires that all demobilizing members of an 
illegal armed group (IAG), including those not accused of any 
crime beyond membership in an IAG, go through a complete 
legal investigation before being pardoned.  The GOC\'s version 
only applies to IAG members who are accused of major crimes. 
The rest are pardoned for membership in an IAG and related 
non-violent crimes under current Colombian law.  Restrepo is 
concerned that a prior full investigation for each IAG member 
is counterproductive and too time consuming. 
 
- Pardo\'s draft requires that a judge decide if a potential 
beneficiary can be pardoned only after he has completed the 
punishment imposed by the Tribunal for Truth, Justice, and 
Reparations.  The GOC version states that the Tribunal both 
imposes the punishment and pardons the beneficiary for the 
remainder of the original sentence at the same time (the 
pardon could be revoked).  Restrepo explained that this would 
streamline the process. 
 
- Pardo\'s version requires that the IAG submit a list of all 
crimes before demobilizing.  The GOC requires that each 
demobilizing IAG member confess all crimes to the Prosecutor 
General\'s Office and have dental identification records and 
fingerprints taken for purposes of investigation, but only 
after he demobilizes.  Restrepo fears that requiring a full 
confession before demobilization would prevent groups from 
even considering demobilizing.  He asserted that the GOC 
sequence allows better control over former IAG members 
because they would first be identified and put under state 
supervision and then required to cooperate with authorities. 
 
- Pardo\'s version allows the Supreme Council of the Judiciary 
to choose the Tribunal members.  The GOC version allows the 
President to nominate them.  (This distinction between a 
\"legal\" versus \"political\" leadership could be central to 
future negotiations with the ELN and FARC.) 
 
8. (C) Shapiro urged the GOC to share its approach with the 
international community and human rights organizations. 
Pardo was skilled at lobbying for his draft and had framed 
the terms of the debate, but little was known about the GOC 
draft.  Restrepo explained that the GOC had been 
intentionally silent on the issue to avoid starting a 
national debate but he believed the GOC had little choice but 
to challenge Pardo\'s version.  The Ambassador urged the GOC 
to work for early consensus with Congress behind the scenes 
instead of debating in public. 
 
----------------------- 
FARC: Military Pressure 
----------------------- 
 
9. (C) When asked if the FARC was willing to negotiate, 
Restrepo said not until the group suffered a serious military 
defeat.  Restrepo asserted that the GOC needed to disprove 
the myth that the FARC Secretariat was untouchable by killing 
or capturing several of its senior commanders.  In contrast 
to the AUC, Restrepo said the FARC was hierarchical with a 
united leadership and provincial mindset.  For example, 
two-thirds of the 35 imprisoned guerrillas whom the GOC 
pardoned and released in November were illiterate or just 
barely able to read. 
 
------------------------------------ 
ELN: Possible COCE Meeting in Mexico 
------------------------------------ 
 
10. (C) Restrepo said the GOC had authorized Mexican 
facilitator Ambassador Andres Valencia to hold a meeting with 
the COCE in Mexico provided the ELN ceased all violent 
activity during the meeting.  The proposal was presented to 
the COCE as an invitation from Valencia with no involvement 
from the GOC as a way to get around the ELN\'s refusal to 
declare a cessation of hostilities to the government.  The 
ELN has responded positively, and Valencia told Restrepo that 
he expects the COCE to agree to the meeting.  Restrepo 
asserted that COCE member Antonio Garcia\'s recent interview 
in which he said the group would agree to a bilateral 
cease-fire was nothing new and remained unacceptable for the 
GOC because (1) the ELN has refused to include a cessation of 
kidnapping in the cease-fire, and (2) the GOC wants a 
unilateral cease-fire.

Summary

1. (C) The Calima Bloc, the fifth paramilitary group to 
demobilize in 2004, demobilized near a small village in 
northern Valle del Cauca Department on December 18.  Bloc 
members, most from the departments of Valle del Cauca or 
Antioquia, turned in over 500 weapons.  The police have 
increased their presence in the Cauca River valley, where the 
Calima Bloc used to operate, and the military is conducting 
counterguerrilla operations in the mountain range east of the 
valley, where the FARC is active.  Civilian and security 
officials noted that drug trafficking by other illegal armed 
groups and the Norte del Valle Cartel remained a serious 
obstacle to fully securing the region.  Peace Commissioner 
Restrepo said the Calima Bloc would be the last paramilitary 
group to demobilize in 2004, bringing the total number of 
paramilitaries demobilized collectively in 2004 to 
approximately 2,600.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
Calima Bloc Demobilizes 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U) On December 18, 553 paramilitaries from the United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia\'s (AUC) Calima Bloc 
demobilized on a farm near the village of Galicia, 
Bugalagrande municipality, Valle del Cauca Department.  Peace 
Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo, AUC commanders, and local 
government and Roman Catholic Church officials, including 
Valle del Cauca Governor Angelino Garzon and the Bishop of 
Buga, gave speeches.  Police and military officers, other GOC 
officials, and members of the OAS verification mission were 
also present.  Chief of National Police Operations General 
Alberto Ruiz was the highest-ranking security official in 
attendance.  Governor Garzon urged other illegal armed groups 
active in the department to follow the Calima Bloc\'s example 
and cease hostilities.  He encouraged the GOC and the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to hold a 
humanitarian exchange.  AUC senior commander Salvatore 
Mancuso, who appeared in civilian clothes after having 
officially demobilized in Catatumbo on December 10 (ref a), 
lamented that some doubted his motives for participating in 
the peace process and emphasized that his only objective was 
demobilization and peace.  Central Bolivar Bloc (BCB) 
political commander Ivan Roberto Duque, aka \"Ernesto Baez,\" 
said other paramilitary groups active on the Pacific coast, 
including the Pacific Bloc, were prepared to demobilize in 
2005.  Both Duque and Restrepo praised AUC leader Vicente 
Castano\'s support for the peace process. 
 
3. (U) In contrast to the other two large-scale paramilitary 
demobilizations of 2004 (reftels), which took place near 
large towns, the Calima Bloc demobilized in an isolated rural 
area.  The nearest airstrip was at least a 45-minute drive 
away on poorly maintained dirt roads.  AUC commanders Mancuso 
and Duque arrived in a private helicopter from the 
concentration zone at Santa Fe de Ralito, Cordoba Department, 
under the supervision of the Peace Commissioner\'s staff. 
 
----------------------------- 
Looking Forward to a New Life 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (U)  Many of the demobilizing paramilitaries cheered when 
they turned in their weapons; some even kicked their 
ammunition.  Galicia residents attended the event, and one 
observer commented that some in the crowd had traveled long 
distances in hopes of being reunited with sons or daughters 
whom they suspected had joined the Calima Bloc.  There were 
ten women and 26 minors in the bloc.  Bloc members 
surrendered just under 500 weapons, primarily rifles but also 
about ten machine guns and a dozen rocket launchers.  OAS 
mission staff immediately began taking inventory of the 
weapons. 
5. (C) The demobilized paramilitaries began leaving the zone 
on December 19 in government-provided buses.  Few were 
natives of the Bugalagrande area.  Over 300 were from Valle 
del Cauca Department, mostly from the cities of Buenaventura 
and Cali.  Another 170 were from Antioquia Department, who 
will report to the reinsertion center in Turbo, in 
Antioquia\'s coastal Uraba region.  The GOC has not yet 
decided where to establish the reinsertion center for former 
paramilitaries from Valle del Cauca.  Several members of 
Restrepo\'s staff said a preliminary check of the list of 
demobilizing paramilitaries conducted by the Prosecutor 
General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\") and Department of 
Administrative Security (DAS) indicated about ten percent are 
implicated in crimes beyond membership in an illegal armed 
group and would be required to report to the concentration 
zone at Santa Fe de Ralito.  Twenty former members of the 
Bananero Bloc and 60 former members of the Catatumbo Bloc are 
already there. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Good Security, But Drug Trafficking Remains A Problem 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6. (C) Local police and government officials expressed 
confidence in the state\'s ability to prevent areas formerly 
dominated by the Calima Bloc from being taken over by the 
FARC or other illegal armed groups.  They emphasized, 
however, that drug trafficking remains a serious threat to 
the area\'s security.  The police have increased their 
presence in the Cauca River valley, where the Calima Bloc 
used to operate, and the military is conducting 
counterguerrilla operations in the mountains east of the 
river, where guerrillas led by FARC commander Fabian Ramirez 
are active.  The Calima Bloc had partially blocked the FARC 
from entering the valley to transport drugs to the Pacific 
coast or along the river.  GOC officials underscored the 
importance of demobilizing the Pacific Bloc and combating the 
Norte de Valle Cartel, both of which are active in the 
mountains to the west of the Cauca River and along the coast. 
 
 
------------------------------------- 
Demobilizations Will Continue in 2005 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Restrepo told Embassy officials the Calima Bloc will 
be the last paramilitary group to demobilize in 2004, 
bringing the total number of paramilitaries demobilized in 
collective acts this year to 2,624.  The next paramilitary 
groups to demobilize will be 800 paramilitaries in Cordoba 
Department formerly under Mancuso\'s command and 110 in the 
Mojana region of Cordoba, Bolivar, and Antioquia Departments, 
who are only loosely affiliated with the AUC.  Restrepo 
thanked the Embassy for its political support for 
demobilization, but expressed frustration over the conditions 
the international community was placing on the process.  He 
lamented that international focus has been on the legal 
debate regarding justice and reparations, and not on the fact 
that the GOC has achieved the successful demobilization of 
thousands of rank and file paramilitary troops.

SUBJECT:  Guarded Optimism at First Year Anniversary of 
BCN Demobilization 
 
REF:  BOGOTA 12188 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
\"It\'s Working\"-First Year Anniversary of BCN 
Demobilization 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
1. Just hours after the November 25 demobilization of 
AUC\'s Bananero Bloc combatants in Turbo, Antioquia 
Department (reftel), the first anniversary of the 
demobilization of the Cacique Nutibara Bloc (BCN) was 
celebrated in the department capital of Medellin.  With 
banners emblazoned with the slogan \"After a Year - it\'s 
Working\", the cavernous Medellin convention hall filled 
with an audience of over 1000, including former BCN 
combatants and their families, public officials, civil 
society leaders, and representatives of foreign missions. 
 
2. In a keynote speech, former BCN commander Diego 
Murrillo, one of the AUC\'s principal negotiators in talks 
with the GOC, described the difficult road traveled in 
the ongoing peace process.  He told the crowd that former 
and current AUC combatants can \"see a light of hope at 
the end of the tunnel that will bring us to join our 
families, reconcile with society, and search for 
political space.... From a position of legality [we will] 
contribute to the building of roads towards often 
mentioned but never well understood social justice.\" 
 
3. Murillo accused critics of the peace process of 
refusing to accept the mechanisms of pardon and 
reconciliation. He was critical of their purported \"wish 
to apply humanitarian fundamentalism,\" characterizing 
them as \"trapped in offices in Europe..\"  He said they 
\"fail to understand, not even with a glance, the dramatic 
realities of Colombia.  A process of peace that does \'not 
have as a fundamental direction pardon and reconciliation 
is\' not viable.\"  Departing from his written remarks, he 
asked the GOC to be generous in its handling of the 
movement\'s leaders\' legal status. 
 
4. In his public remarks, Mayor of Medellin Sergio 
Fajardo admitted that a year earlier he had serious 
doubts about prospects for success of the AUC 
demobilization process.  However, as a close observer of 
the process over the past year, he had become a believer. 
Linking the demobilization to reduced levels of violence, 
he noted that murders in the city had fallen by over 60% 
from the previous year.  Yet he reminded the gathering 
that the problems of Medellin and Antioquia will not be 
solved only by demobilizing former combatants, but by 
dealing successfully with other forms of violence and 
offering Medellin\'s youth educational and employment 
opportunities that discourage them from joining criminal 
gangs or engaging in other types of crime. 
 
5. The mood after the ceremony was genuinely positive, 
almost festive.  Embassy officials spoke with several 
demobilized fighters, all of whom said they were happy to 
have returned to their families and reintegrated into 
society and \"legality.\" Although they recognized that the 
road ahead is not easy, they emphasized that it is 
nevertheless better than the one left behind.

SUBJECT: CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN COLOMBIA 
 
-------- 
Summary 
-------- 
 
1. Leading companies are implementing strategically-focused 
corporate social responsibility programs in Colombia.  Each year, 
private companies donate millions of dollars to fund education, 
health, and recreational initiatives throughout the country.  The 
private sector is also providing management consultancy services 
to civil-society organizations and is leading efforts to raise 
and channel international donations to support Colombian 
development organizations.  Many Colombian companies also provide 
a variety of employee benefits and social services -- including 
housing subsidies -- through innovative cost-sharing programs. 
Although the long-term impact of such programs in Colombia has 
not been rigorously analyzed, top Colombian companies are 
demonstrating significant potential to promote and support the 
country\'s most critical development needs.  End summary. 
 
2. The Catholic Church has greatly influenced the development of 
philanthropy in Colombia. Corporate foundations support social, 
economic, and humanitarian assistance efforts nationwide. 
Prominent young Colombian professionals and entrepreneurs are 
spearheading creative and high-impact initiatives.  This new 
generation of business and social leaders is developing a culture 
of corporate social responsibility within Colombia\'s private 
sector and involving their own companies. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Profile of Corporate Foundations 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. Over the past three years, the Colombian private sector has 
increasingly realized its stake in improving socio-economic 
conditions. In 2002, Colombian companies donated at least 140 
billion Colombian pesos (CPS) (approximately USD 52 million) to 
various social development initiatives. The most recent records 
indicate that in 1997 there were 94 corporate foundations 
formally operating in Colombia, with assets approximating one 
billion dollars, equivalent to 1 percent of Colombia\'s GDP and 5 
percent of total public sector expenditures.  Since then, several 
new corporate foundations have been created and we expect this 
trend to continue. 
 
4. Some foundations leverage third party resources, mostly using 
donations and matching grants from international foundations 
(primarily from the U.S.).  Several prominent corporate 
foundations, such as Corona and Carvajal, are actively involved 
in supporting institutional development and strengthening through 
management consulting and other services.  This type of 
assistance is provided directly through specialized NGOs such as 
\"Corporacin Calidad,\"  \"Corpoeducacion,\" \"Gestion Hospitalaria,\" 
and \"Compartamos Con Colombia,\" among others. 
 
------------------------------------- 
CSR Investment Mechanisms and Targets 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. According to a recent study of the top fifty companies in 
Colombia carried out by Compartamos Con Colombia (CCC), 52 
percent of the companies it surveyed make direct donations, 28 
percent contribute to corporate foundations, and a small number 
have grant programs.  The CCC study demonstrates a focus on 
education, employment generation, and health, followed by sports, 
cultural activities, and other forms of recreation.  Smaller 
contributions are earmarked to promote civic values. 
Additionally, the private sector is supporting micro-businesses 
and small enterprises in Colombia through micro-credit and direct 
investments.  Twenty-six companies in CCC\'s sample include micro- 
enterprise development as part of their CSR strategies, and most 
support small business ventures in marginal and underserved 
areas.   Companies that operate production facilities, however, 
generally concentrate their activities in nearby communities. 
 
-------------------------------- 
\"Cajas de Compensacion Familiar\" 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. Many Colombian companies make sizeable contributions to social 
programs through family subsidy and benefit compensation 
entities, or \"Cajas de Compensacion Familiar\" (CCFs).  Unique to 
Colombia, the 54 Cajas are key players in the implementation of 
wide-ranging social programs that directly benefit almost 10 
million Colombians, or 23 percent of Colombia\'s total population. 
Obligatory employee payroll contributions channeled through 
affiliated private sector companies fund the Cajas.  This 
\"forced\" contribution by employees through CCFs constitutes a 
critical delivery channel for a broad range of social programs. 
 
7. The number of affiliated companies has grown 18 percent since 
1994, helping to increase the resources available to undertake 
critical social programs.  As a result, there is a sizeable 
increase in the number of affiliated workers and family members 
eligible for the social services that CCFs provide.  The total 
number of affiliated persons increased from 8,641,384 in 1994 to 
9,846,031 in 2003. 
 
8. Taken as a whole, 83,676 private sector companies are 
currently affiliated with the 54 Cajas, which are financed by 
means of a 4 percent payroll tax and paid by these companies. As 
a result, the CCFs enjoy a sizeable budget which they invest in a 
variety of social programs.  In 2003, CCF expenditures reached 
CPS 1.4 trillion (approximately USD 519 million), and for 2004 
the proposed budget is CPS 1.5 trillion (approximately USD 555 
million).  CCF programs cover education, health, housing, 
tourism, and recreation, as well as unemployment and housing 
loans.  The subsidies provided through the CCFs are divided into 
two main categories: 
-- Monetary subsidies, in which the CCFs typically spend CPS 
511.4 billion (approximately USD 189 million) benefiting an 
estimated three million members; and 
 
-- Housing subsidies, in which the CCFs typically spend CPS 158.2 
billion pesos (approximately USD 59 million), benefiting some 
25,000 member families annually. 
 
In 2004, housing subsidies are expected to increase to CPS 170 
billion (approximately USD 62 million), and will benefit 34,200 
members. 
 
9. The CCFs operate 31 percent of Colombia\'s health system. In 
2003, these entities operated 224 health centers, including basic 
health clinics, hospitals, dental centers, and comprehensive 
medical service units. 
 
------------------ 
Leading Companies 
------------------ 
 
10. According to CCC, the 20 leading private sector Colombian 
companies with advanced social responsibility practices are: 
Bellsouth (now owned by Telefnica of Spain), El Tiempo, Bavaria, 
Corona, Carvajal, Hocol (a petroleum producer), Promigas, 
Almacenes Exito, Sociedad Portuaria De Buenaventura, Ingenio 
Riopaila, Emgesa, Grupo Mac, Smurfit Carton De Colombia, Noel, 
Empresa De Energia De Bogota, Carbones Del Cerrejon, Isa, 
Coomeva, Colsubsidio, and Indupalma. 
 
11. Leading Colombian companies increasingly create local 
development organizations in which a large number of national and 
international companies unite to support a specific social cause 
or goal, in contrast with more traditional models in which 
companies work independently and in an oftentimes paternalistic 
manner.  For example, the recently created \"Empresarios por la 
Educacion\" (Entrepreneurs for Education) foundation resulted from 
the combined efforts of more than 60 companies working in 
alliance to improve educational standards in Colombia. 
Regionally focused activities include marketing, internet-based 
fundraising and business consulting services focused on NGOs and 
foundations. 
 
------------------- 
General Conclusions 
------------------- 
 
12. Colombia has a long tradition of corporate giving and is a 
leader in this area in the Andean region.  While they are not yet 
a common business practice and not widely integrated into 
corporate strategies and values, more companies are beginning to 
develop community-oriented policies and programs.  Additionally, 
very few companies currently measure the results and impact of 
their strategic and targeted social and economic investments as 
well as charitable contributions, making evaluation difficult and 
inadequate information systems often limit the efficacy of the 
evaluations that are undertaken.

SUBJECT: TRANSPARENCY OF COLOMBIAN BUDGET/MILITARY SPENDING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 239929 
 
1.   (U)  Per Secstate 239929, post has spoken to appropriate 
Colombian government authorities and has responses to 
questions posed by Washington. 
 
2.    (U)  Military Expenditures are audited by the National 
Comptroller, which works on an annual cycle to audit each 
aspect of military expenditures.  There are five types of 
auditing modalities.  A regular audit is performed for new 
entities (first-time audits) or entities that have not 
received recent audits.  Abbreviated audits are performed on 
a yearly basis for most entities.  Special audits are 
performed on specific processes such as audits on classified 
military spending.  Account audits are performed for very 
small entities.  Finally, follow-up audits are performed on 
entities that face a critical situation or those that have 
already been audited and have committed to special 
improvement plans.  Assigned auditors submit their auditing 
reports to multidisciplinary teams of economists, lawyers, 
and generals to evaluate a strategy and the information they 
have received.  They determine the deficiencies, determine 
linkages to problems, analyze causes of deficiencies, 
determine the impact of deficiencies, determine if the 
problems are sporadic or reoccurring, and evaluate the 
evidence.  The auditing teams are obliged to inform the 
entities that receive the audits about their findings.  The 
audited entities are also mandated to apply corrective 
measures immediately after receiving auditing reports (they 
have 3 days to respond to the National Comptroller after 
receiving the report). 
 
3.   (U) At the regional level, 31 departmental offices 
perform audits on military units throughout the country. 
Those regional offices consist of groups of auditors 
supervised by regional managers who report to the National 
Comptroller\'s Office at the central level.  At the central 
level, the National Comptroller assigns 5 auditors for the 
Army, 5 for the Navy, 5 for the Air Force, 4 for the National 
Police, 4 for the DAS (Administrative Security Department), 
and 3 for the other entities related to security such as 
DISAN (Defense Sanitary Directorate) and the Superintendence 
of Private Vigilance.  Auditing of classified security 
spending is done separately on a total of 11 entities 
(including Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, DAS, INPEC, DNE, 
Prosecutor General,s Office, and a few others).  A total of 
7 auditors are assigned to classified defense spending.  As 
mentioned above, these auditors report to working teams at 
the Comptroller,s office who evaluate and measure the impact 
of the findings and report to the audited entities, judicial 
and legislative authorities for corrective actions and 
political control. 
 
4.   (U)  The audits are reported to the audited entities, 
Congress and the President.  While the Contraloria is the 
only entity that approves the audits, the President usually 
meets with the Comptroller to discuss the results.  If the 
auditing reports conclude that there are grounds for 
initiating disciplinary or penal investigations, then the 
audits are also reported to the Prosecutor General or the 
Attorney General Offices accordingly. 
 
5.    (U)  Apart from the military authorities, some civilian 
entities make up part of the defense and security sector 
including the Military Hospital, Military Club, Military 
University, Civilian Defense, Indumil (Military Industry), 
Satena (Airline), Superintendence of Private Vigilance, DAS 
(Administrative Department of Security), INPEC (Penitentiary 
Institute), National Police, DNE (National Drugs Directorate) 
and others.  The National Comptroller audits all of these 
civilian entities. 
 
6.    (U)   There is an existing framework for conducting 
annual audits of military expenditures.  The Comptroller 
performs these audits annually, starting in August and ending 
in June.  97 percent of the military budget is audited every 
year.  The auditing process by the National Comptroller is a 
standard procedure that has been certified by ISO 9000.  The 
auditing is based on past auditing reports and on information 
received from the entities receiving the audits.  Audits 
consist of three phases: planning, execution, and reporting. 
The planning is documented in a General Auditing Plan, which 
determines specific dates and entities to be audited.  During 
execution, auditors collect evidence and evaluate the 
evidence.  The reporting consists of producing a report with 
the findings of the audits performed. There is an instituted 
policy that requires these audits. 
 
7.    (U) One of the main objectives of the auditing process 
is to measure efficacy.  However, in the defense sector, many 
of the objectives are hardly measurable.  For example, a 
certain amount of military operations were performed to 
maintain peace or fight against terrorism, but there is no 
certain way of measuring what the situation would have been 
in the absence of such operations.  Some deficiencies are 
also present in the process of collecting information.  The 
entities that receive the audits sometimes use different 
accounting methods and in some cases information is not 
submitted on time.  There is classified material that can not 
be fully audited because of the sensitive nature of the data. 
 Additionally, there is no legislation that regulates the use 
of classified spending or that provides management criteria 
for classified budgets.  These deficiencies do not appear to 
be intentional, and likely are the result of restrictions 
related to security concerns or lack of mechanisms to verify 
the information received. 
 
8.     (U)  Colombia\'s defense budget includes the police, 
Ministry of Defense (Armed Forces) and DAS (Dept. of 
Administrative Security).  The only significant off-budget 
military receipts are those for Plan Colombia, which are 
audited because the U.S-Colombia cooperation agreement 
specifically requires that audits be performed on such funds. 
 Other off-budget military receipts include the Military 
Forces, own resources and other international cooperation 
funds, neither of which represent significant amounts.

3. (C) Summary:  MOD Uribe said relations with Venezuela were 
cordial but tense.  He welcomed Venezuela\'s efforts to secure 
the border but expressed concern that, given Chavez\' 
unpredictability, something more serious could be behind it. 
If Venezuela found a pretext to invade Colombian territory, 
the GOC would immediately take the matter to the UN.  Uribe 
said U.S. assistance was key to recent military successes 
against the illegal armed groups.  His objective was to 
improve jointness between the armed services and with other 
ministries responsible for establishing a state presence in 
secured areas.  Uribe agreed that aerial eradication in 
national parks was a high priority.  The incoming Chief of 
Military Justice, General Puentes, provided brief updates on 
four key human rights cases: the Mapiripan paramilitary 
massacre case was moved to a judge in Bogota; the killing of 
five civilians in Cajamarca was moved to the civilian justice 
system;  the crossfire between police and army in Guaitarilla 
was nearing closure in the military justice system; and the 
killing of three trade unionists in Arauca was with the 
civilian justice system.  Uribe said that one his key 
priorities is to reform the military justice system to make 
it more just and transparent.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Underlying Tensions with Venezuela 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Uribe had just returned from what he described as a 
friendly and productive meeting with Venezuelan Defense 
Minister Garcia Carneiro.  The ministers had agreed to send 
two officers to each others\' military academies, which Uribe 
characterized as a step forward.  He described Venezuelan 
misperceptions about Colombian attitudes as extraordinary. 
The GOC was treading carefully to avoid anything that 
President Chavez could interpret as an act of aggression. 
Uribe noted that Venezuela was buying weapons and increasing 
radar along the border.  While securing the border was also 
good for Colombia, the GOC had to watch what was coming 
behind the build up.  Uribe said the Venezuelans were also 
upgrading infrastructure such as extending water pipes, 
reinforcing bridges, and paving roads, which could facilitate 
tank movements.  While Colombia would continue to focus on 
its own war at home, he could not rule out that Chavez could 
do something unexpected.  In the event of an attack, Colombia 
had no option but to recur to the UN for help since 
Colombia\'s capacity to defend itself against Venezuela was 
limited, with only eight combat planes.  Uribe claimed that 
Venezuela was repairing its F-16 planes and buying spare 
parts internationally in order to avoid the difficulty of 
buying them directly from the U.S. 
 
5. (C) Farrar noted that drug trafficking is a growing 
problem in Venezuela.  Uribe agreed and said that there are 
numerous illegal flights from elsewhere in Venezuela to the 
Colombian border to transport arms, precursor chemicals, and 
other illicit products into Colombia, and pick up drugs.  The 
Air Bridge Denial program prevents these illegal planes from 
flying into Colombia.  According to Uribe, Venezuela seized 
25 tons of cocaine this year.  Uribe has warned Garcia 
Carneiro to take counterdrug measures immediately before the 
problem gets out of control. 
 
6. (C) Uribe said that three recent events in particular had 
exacerbated tensions with Venezuela: 
 
- When Colombia was planning to purchase tanks from Spain, 
Venezuela sent numerous officials to Spain to persuade them 
not to go through with the deal. 
 
- The GOC captured Rodrigo Granda Escobar on December 13, one 
of the FARC\'s senior international representatives, on the 
Colombian-Venezuelan border. 
- Four Colombian police officers were arrested for espionage 
in Venezuela.  Working behind the scenes, Uribe was assured 
by the GOV that they would be released in a few days. 
 
-------------------------- 
Counterterrorism Successes

7. (C) Shapiro congratulated Uribe on military success 
against the illegal armed groups, noting that he was 
particularly impressed with his trip to San Jose del Guaviare 
to observe counternarcotics operations and meet with Plan 
Patriota Commander General Fracica.  Uribe credited U.S. 
assistance as a key element to GOC success.  His objective 
was to improve jointness, not only between the armed services 
but also with other ministries, such as health and education, 
which were responsible for establishing a presence in secured 
areas.  He expressed confidence that the FARC were being 
pressured by Plan Patriota.  For example, in a recent 
operation, the security forces discovered the beret worn by 
FARC Commander Mono Jojoy, suggesting he was forced to leave 
in a hurry.  Uribe said the military was locating and 
destroying luxurious FARC facilities with king-sized beds and 
pools during Plan Patriota operations.  The Ambassador 
praised Uribe for a recent presss article about Plan 
Patriota, noting that it was important to publicize military 
successes. 
 
8. (C) Farrar underscored the importance of keeping open the 
option of aerially eradicating coca in national parks.  Until 
permission is granted to spray in parks, operations 
increasingly are focused on hard to reach, small plots of 
coca.  There are five parks, including ones in the Sierra 
Nevada de Santa Marta, Catatumbo, and the Sierra Nevada de 
Macarena, that are known to have extensive coca fields. 
Uribe agreed, but expressed concern about the international 
and domestic reaction if Colombia started spraying national 
parks.  During a trip to Europe in February, Uribe will 
emphasize the importance of aerial eradication.  Manual 
eradication is too time-consuming and labor-intensive to be 
effective in large fields. 
 
9. (C) Uribe said the GOC is already beginning to prepare for 
a post-conflict period.  Internal reform of the military is a 
priority.  For example, he is working to expand the role of 
the Defense Ministry\'s Aeronautic Industrial Corporation of 
Colombia (CIAC) to conduct maintenance on planes, 
helicopters, and other equipment.  His goal is to decrease 
dependence on the U.S. for equipment and maintenance.  Farrar 
noted efforts to create an Armed Forces/CNP joint helicopter 
maintenance facility would improve efficiency, and that the 
GOC needed to weigh operations and maintenance costs in 
deciding on new aircraft purchases. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Human Rights and Military Justice 
--------------------------------- 
10. (C) Shapiro reminded Uribe that, in order for Congress to 
release funding for Colombia, the USG needed to report 
progress on human rights cases.  He raised four problematic 
cases that needed satisfactory resolutions: the 1997 
Mapiripan paramilitary massacre, the April 2004 killing of 
five civilians in Cajamarca, the April 2004 crossfire between 
Army and police forces that resulted in the death of seven 
police and four civilians in Guaitarilla, and the August 2004 
killing of three labor unionists in Arauca Department. 
Farrar stressed that resolution of the Mapiripan case was 
overdue when he was in WHA in 2000, and further delay 
undermined the GOC\'s progress in other areas.  Uribe said he 
is working to reform the military justice system to make it 
transparent, just, and efficient.  He instructed incoming 
Military Justice Commander General Puentes to follow the 
cases closely, give the Embassy a detailed report on their 
status, and to work with the U.S. MILGRP on reform of the 
military justice system.  Puentes reported that: 
- Mapiripan: General Jaime Umberto Uscategui was tried on six 
charges and convicted for the crime of omission for the 
massacre by the military justice system.  The Constitutional 
Court overruled the conviction on the grounds that the 
military justice system did not have jurisdiction over the 
case and transfered it to the civilian justice system. 
Uscategui is under house arrest at the Army\'s cavalry school. 
 Several pre-trial motions delayed the case from going to 
trial.  It is now before a judge in Bogota and should go to 
trial soon. 
 
- Cajamarca: The case is with the civilian justice system. 
One noncommissioned officer and six professional soldiers 
have been detained for alleged involvement in the incident. 
Uribe added that he personally believed the Army\'s claim that 
it mistook the civilians for guerrillas.  He visited the site 
one day after the incident occurred and said the thick fog in 
the area would make it difficult to determine someone\'s 
identity even at close range. 
 
- Guaitarilla: The case is with the military justice system. 
Puentes asserted the judge was close to a decision but was 
trying to clarify the cause of a bone fracture of one of the 
victims.  Two noncommissioned officers and 12 professional 
soldiers have been detained for alleged involvement.  Uribe 
added that President Uribe has repeatedly urged him to find 
and reveal the truth of the incident as quickly as possible. 
 
- Arauca: The case is with the civilian justice system. 
Uribe added he believed the Army\'s report that the three 
unionists faced arrest for involvement in guerrilla activity. 
 All soldiers involved are in detention.

REF:  A) STATE 25492, B) BOGOTA 10415, C) STATE 168732, D) 
BOGOTA 8457 
 
1.   (U) Although Post concurs with the Department\'s 
assessment of Colombia as \"non-compliant\" with the Hague 
Abduction Convention, Post notes legislation to implement 
the Convention is moving through the Colombian Congress. 
There are also positive developments in judicial training 
and cooperation. 
 
2.   (U) Implementing legislation:  On December 14, the 
Colombian House of Representatives passed legislation that 
clarifies jurisdiction by directing Hague cases to the 
Family Court.  Working with Colombian legislators and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Emboffs successfully lobbied 
for CA\'s suggested modifications to the bill prior to its 
adoption by the House.  The bill will now move to the 
Senate, where our initial discussions with leading members 
have been positive.  We can reasonably expect the bill to 
become law during the Spring 2005 legislative session. 
 
3.   (U) Judicial Training:  A Family Court judge attended a 
recent Latin American Judicial Seminar in Monterrey 
sponsored by the Hague Conference on Private International 
Law.  The intent of the Conference was to promote more 
effective implementation of, and compliance with, the Hague 
Abduction Convention. 
 
4.   (U) Cooperation:  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(which, with post encouragement, goaded the Ministry of 
Social Protection and Supreme Council of the Judiciary into 
drafting the necessary legislation) has agreed to take an 
active role in inter-agency cooperation and follow-up, e.g., 
directing cases to trained judges. 
 
5.   (SBU) The Family Welfare division of the Ministry of 
Social Protection still presents a potential challenge.  For 
example, Family Welfare declined to attend the Monterrey 
training, despite the offer of U.S. financial assistance. 
If the legislation described in para 2 above passes into 
law, an abducting family member could file a \"tutela\" (a 
species of appeal) that would result in the equivalent of an 
injunction while the Constitutional Court considers the new 
law. 
 
6.   (U) Progress on Outstanding Cases:  While post is 
unable to report progress on the cases cited in reftel A, 
consular officers successfully conducted a long-delayed 
welfare and whereabouts visit to Christine and Amir Andre 
Sheikh-Attar on December 7.  Details to follow by Septel. 
Additionally, a consular officer conducted a welfare visit 
on August 24 to Sophia Fonte, who had been taken to Bolivia 
by her mother while divorce proceedings were ongoing 
(Reftels C and D).  The Fonte family has since reconciled, 
and the mother and child have returned to the United States. 
 
7.   (U) Comment:  Although the legal processes have been 
slowed by the implementing legislation, for the most part 
Colombian officials are determined to implement the 
Convention fully.  Post is confident that after final 
passage of the legislation, the GOC will implement the 
provisions of the Convention.

SUBJECT: GOC PRESENTS HUMAN RIGHTS STATUS REPORT TO G-24 
AND NGOS IN PREPARATION FOR CARTAGENA 
 
 
------ 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) On December 15, President Uribe, Vice President 
Santos and several other GOC officials presented a human 
rights status report to the G-24 Ambassadors and NGO 
representatives in preparation for the London Declaration 
follow-up conference in Cartagena on February 3-4, 2005.  The 
proceedings were carried by local media.  The GOC reported 
that nearly all violence indicators, including murders, 
forced displacement, and kidnappings, had decreased 
significantly since 2002, and military operations against the 
illegal armed groups were working.  The GOC highlighted 
progress in key human rights programs, including efforts to 
develop a National Action Plan for Human Rights, expanding 
the early warning system and state protection for threatened 
individuals, and developing a national plan to address 
anti-personnel landmines.  It reported on the 45 hours of 
consultations conducted over the last couple of months with 
the NGO community on the 27 recommendations of the UN Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and announced an 
agreement to share intelligence files with NGOs.  Santos, who 
led the substantive part of the GOC presentation, said the 
Uribe administration plans to complete the National Action 
Plan for Human Rights and strengthen its human rights 
programs in 2005.  G-24 chair Ambassador Marina Celina 
Azevedo of Brazil read a statement on behalf of the group 
(see para 13).  Following the formal presentations, President 
Uribe conducted a spirited exchange with NGO representatives. 
 Santos and Foreign Minister Barco, who was also present, 
characterized the President\'s encounter with NGOs as much 
tamer than past ones.  However, several NGOs questioned the 
government\'s claims of progress and expressed doubt about its 
capacity to improve the country\'s human rights situation. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (U) President Uribe, Vice President Santos, Foreign 
Minister Barco, Presidential Advisor for Social Action Hoyos 
Aristizabal met with G-24 Ambassadors and representatives 
from eight NGOs on December 15.  Director of the UN Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights Michael Fruhling also 
made a brief presentation.  NGOs represented were Alianza de 
Organizaciones Sociales y Afines, Confederacion Colombiana de 
Organizaciones No Gubernamentales, Secretariado Nacional de 
Pastoral Social, Dialogo Inter-Agencial en Colombia, Consejo 
Nacional de Planeacion, Federacion Colombiana de Municipios, 
Asociacion Nacional de Industriales and Fundacion Restrepo 
Barco.  The meeting lasted almost four hours. 
 
------------------- 
Positive Statistics 
------------------- 
 
3. (U) Vice President Santos reported the following 
statistics on human rights indicators for 2002, 2003 and the 
first 11 months of 2004, respectively: 
 
- murders: 28,837, 23,031 and 18,579 (down 20 and 14 percent 
from the year before) 
- murders of labor unionists: 121, 54 and 37 (down 55 and 27 
percent) 
- murders of mayors: 13, 9 and 14 (down 31 and up 75 percent) 
- murders of councilmen: 80, 75 and 18 (down 6 and 73 percent) 
- murders of indigenous people: 180, 164 and 79 (down 9 and 
45 percent) 
- murders of teachers: 79, 41 and 57 (down 48 and up 39 
percent) 
- massacre victims: 680, 504 and 238 (down 26 and 48 percent) 
- massacres: 115, 94 and 43 (down 18 and 49 percent) 
- murders of journalists: 10, 7 and 3 (down 43 and 50 percent) 
- kidnapping victims: 2,986, 2,200 and 1,250 (down 26 and 41 
percent) 
- attacks on towns: 32, 5 and 15 (down 84 and up 200 percent) 
- attacks on infrastructure: 905, 494 and 264 (down 45 and 45 
percent) 
- forced displacement: 379,289, 219,431 and 124,284 (down 42 
and 41 percent) 
 
4. (U) Santos said security forces have killed and captured 
the following numbers of illegal armed group members in 2002, 
2003 and the first 11 months in 2004, respectively: 
 
- killed paramilitaries: 187, 346 and 533 (up 85 and 78

percent) 
- captured guerrillas: 3,763, 6,967 and 5,872 (up 85 and down 
ten percent) 
 
------------------------------------- 
National Action Plan for Human Rights 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Of 171 countries that have pledged to develop a 
National Action Plan for Human Rights, Santos underscored 
that Colombia would be one of only 20 countries that had 
complied by 2005.  He reported that the Uribe administration 
has approximately USD 325,000 (880 million pesos) available 
for the plan, 60 percent of which is provided by Switzerland 
and UNHCHR.  In January 2005, the GOC will consult with civil 
society about the plan.  The GOC has incorporated human 
rights into departmental development strategies.  Thirty 
departments and 149 municipalities (equivalent to U.S. 
counties) have humanitarian action plans. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Early Warning System and High Risk Communities 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6. (U) In 2004, there were 83 risk reports and 58 follow-up 
investigations, which resulted in 36 early warnings.  The GOC 
established a regional risk report for the Sierra Nevada de 
Santa Marta region and is working on reports for Arauca and 
Valle del Cauca Departments.  Uribe and Santos credited the 
early warning system, increased state presence, and support 
from civil society with decreases in internal displacement, 
violence, and massacres.  The GOC has identified ten high 
risk areas in the country and will begin augmenting state 
presence there on January 15.  The Spanish Agency for 
International Cooperation and USAID are each providing 
approximately USD 132,000 (330 million pesos) to the 
initiative. 
 
---------------- 
State Protection 
---------------- 
 
7. (U) The GOC had USD 15,000 (37.2 million pesos) in 2004 
for protecting threatened individuals, seventeen percent of 
which was from USAID.  In 2004, 4,249 individuals received 
assistance from this program.  Since 1999, 17,738 people have 
been helped.  The GOC trained 204 individuals in preventative 
security and re-located more than 800 threatened teachers. 
 
------------------- 
Antipersonnel Mines 
------------------- 
 
8. (U) Working with NGOs and the international community, the 
GOC has developed a National Action Plan Against Landmines. 
The military destroyed its last arsenal of stored landmines 
on October 24. 
 
------------------------------ 
Cooperation with Civil Society 
------------------------------ 
 
9. (U) Hoyos stressed GOC efforts to expand its consultative 
process with civil society.  In 2004, the GOC held more than 
20 meetings with civil society representatives to discuss 
human rights, including a meeting between President Uribe and 
international NGOs on August 5 and between the Defense 
Minister and military high command with civil society. The 
Ministry of Defense agreed to share intelligence files with 
NGOs under supervision from the Inspector General\'s Office. 
The Police and military will each form special committees to 
review the files and share requested information.  The NGOs 
will request specific files, after which time the Defense 
Ministry will have two months to respond. 
 
------------------------------ 
Social and Economic Indicators 
------------------------------ 
 
10. (U) According to the GOC, GDP grew 3.7 percent in the 
first three trimesters of 2004.  Unemployment fell 12.4 
percent this year.  Since 2004, the GOC created 734,000 new 
spaces in public schools, and in 2004, 93,000 students 
received education assistance from royalties.  There are 
124,000 adults enrolled in literacy programs and 87,000 
at-risk individuals enrolled in education programs.  The GOC 
provided 35,154 scholarships for higher education and 77,000 
housing subsidies in 2004.  There are nine state-funded 
departmental medical missions. 
 
---------- 
2005 Plans 
---------- 
 
11. (U) Santos said the GOC has the following goals for 2005: 
 
- Complete the National Action Plan for Human Rights by June 
or July (On December 16, Santos and Fruhling signed a letter 
of understanding stating that the UN Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia will advise the 
Vice Presidency on the Human Rights Action Plan.) 
 
- Strengthen the culture of human rights 
 
- Develop a policy to fight impunity 
 
- Establish human rights programs in 350 municipalities 
 
- Expand state presence in the ten designated high-risk areas 
 
- Improve internal investigations of the armed forces 
 
- Complete review of intelligence files 
 
- Develop an information database on human rights 
 
- Achieve optimal functioning of the early warning system 
 
-------------- 
NGOs Skeptical 
-------------- 
 
12. (SBU) NGO representatives peppered Uribe with questions 
and comments for almost two hours.  The exchange was 
spirited.  NGOs questioned GOC statistics and capacity to 
address the country\'s human rights problems.  The president 
of the Alliance of Social Organizations, referring to 
statistics from the Comptroller\'s Office, pointed out that 
Colombia continues to suffer from widespread poverty.  The 
Secretary General of the National Indigenous Organization 
 
SIPDIS 
walked out of the meeting, at one point, complaining that the 
Uribe administration was doing little to stop what he 
described as genocide against indigenous people.  Others 
questioned GOC implementation of the 27 recommendations of 
the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
Uribe responded that he respected the recommendations and 
wished to continue discussing their implementation with the 
OHCHR, but reiterated that they were recommendations and not 
the only way to measure GOC progress in human rights.  That 
said, he asked OHCHR director Fruhling how many 
recommendations the GOC had implemented.  Fruhling demurred, 
stating that implementation was a process, that there was a 
\"positive dynamic,\" and that progress was being made.  He 
cited one area where more needed to be done: incorporating 
training in human rights and international humanitarian law 
for all members of the security forces.  (Fruhling said 
afterwards that giving a scorecard in a public forum in front 
of Uribe and NGO representatives would have been 
counterproductive.)  Still other NGOs questioned the GOC 
approach to the peace process, criticizing ongoing 
paramilitary demobilizations without a law in place to deal 
with those who are guilty of violent crimes beyond membership 
in an illegal armed group.  Uribe responded with a passionate 
defense of his democratic security policy and the 
paramilitary demoblizations underway. 
 
-------------- 
G-24 Statement 
-------------- 
 
13. (U) An unofficial translation of the G-24 statement 
negotiated by G-24 members in Bogota over the last month and 
delivered by outgoing G-24 President, Ambassador Maria Celina 
Azevedo follows: 
 
Begin Text: 
 
Mr. President, 
 
1. As you know, the G-24 was formed as an informal group of 
countries to support the Colombian Government to fulfill the 
principles and goals established in the London Declaration on 
July 10, 2003. 
 
2. In this sense, we want to underline the accomplishments 
achieved by the Colombian Government in the development of 
different themes related to the London Declaration and we 
invite the authorities to follow the aformentioned process. 
We would like to affirm our role as facilitators with respect 
to all the initiatives related to the London Declaration, and 
we consider dialog as the ideal path for the search for 
solutions to the country\'s internal issues.  We reiterate our 
commitment to continue looking for ways for the international 
community to contribute to the realization of the goals of 
the London Declaration. 
 
3. We support the deepening of mechanisms for dialogue 
between the Colombian Government and Civil Society, 
represented by different groups of NGOs, and with the 
international community, for better coordinated international 
cooperation, in such a way that the government can achieve 
its proposed objectives.  Considering the important role that 
civil society plays in an open and transparent democracy its 
participation during the meeting in Cartagena would be 
valuable. 
 
4. Although a long road is ahead, we take note of the 
different methods that have been and continue being taken by 
the Colombian Government with an eye towards fulfulling the 
recommendations of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights.  The Colombian Government can continue counting 
on the support of our governments for this objective. 
 
5. We want to highlight the Colombian Government\'s decision 
to contribute to the cessation of anti-personnel mines, 
especially the destruction of military landmine reserves.  We 
recognize such an action as an important step forward and 
demonstration of commitment to the consolidation of 
International Humanitarian Law in Colombia, and we urge the 
illegal armed groups to follow the example, in such a way to 
protect the civilian population from the damage caused by the 
use of anti-personnel mines. 
 
6. We note that overcoming the conflict and realizing peace 
with the illegal armed groups requires a legal framework that 
emphasizes the principles of Truth, Justice, and Reparation 
and that respects Human Rights and International Humanitarian 
Law.  Likewise, we note that demobilization processes should 
make use of disarmament methods and clear strategies for 
reinsertion for the individuals that participate in 
demobilization.  In this sense, we invite the government to 
take the necessary measures. 
 
7. In this context, we reiterate our call to all the illegal 
armed groups to agree to a cessation in hostilities and move 
towards peace talks. 
 
8. We condemn the evil practices of kidnapping, forced 
disappearances, and extra-judicial executions.  We reiterate 
the need for all kidnapped persons in Colombia to be released 
immediately. 
 
9. We reaffirm our condemnation of drug trafficking and any 
form of violence and terrorist acts, of which, among others, 
the victims are the civilian population and especially the 
most vulnerable groups of civilians.  We therefore repeat the 
need for these acts to be prosecuted with full respect for 
Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law. 
 
10. We believe it is of extreme importance to reinforce the 
special mechanisms of support and protection for the most 
vulnerable segments of Colombian society, such as displaced 
persons, indigenous and afro-Colombian communities, union 
leaders, human rights defenders, and other members of civil 
society who have been threatened, and for their relatives, 
and for the women and children affected by the conflict and 
the humanitarian crisis. 
 
11. As a result, we support the Humanitarian Action Plan and 
the inclusive way in which the government is developing it, 
with support from the international community and civil 
society.  We hope the process will conclude soon. 
 
12. We cannot forget to recognize the important contribution 
of the United Nations, Organization of American States, 
International Organizations, and other actors in Colombia in 
the search for a solution to the grave problems of the 
population that is affected by the activities of the illegal 
armed groups.  In a very notable way, it is equally as 
important to underscore the efforts undertaken toward the 
search for a negotiated peace. 
 
13. Likewise, we reiterate our support for the fight against 
drug trafficking, for the elimination of violence that drug 
trafficking brings, and for the means to overcome these 
circumstances. 
 
14. Finally, we want to express our satisfaction with the 
high level meeting to follow up the London Declaration in 
February 2005.  We hope the meeting strengthens the efficacy 
and coordination of international cooperation, and can take 
note of the advances made in the implementation of the 
recommendations of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in Colombia.  We want to emphasize that 
accomplishments in this field are beginning to be noticeable. 
 The advances that can be seen should not impede recognition 
that much remains to be done to achieve difficult and 
sustainable progress in constructing peace. 
 
Thank you very much.

1.  Como es de su conocimiento, el G-24 fue constituido como 
grupo informal de paises para apoyar al Gobierno de Colombia 
en el cumplimiento de los principios y retos establecidos en 
la Declaracion de Londres, el 10 de julio de 2003. 
 
2. En ese sentido, deseamos subrayar los logros obtenidos por 
el Gobierno de Colombia en el desarollo de diferentes temas 
relacionadas a la Declaracion de Londres e invitamos las 
autoridades a seguir dicho proceso.  Quisieramos reafirmar 
nuestro papel de facilitadores en lo que se refiere a todas 
las iniciativas relacionadas con la Declaracion de Londres, y 
consideramos que el dialogo es el camino idoneo para la 
busqueda de soluciones a las cuestiones internas del pais. 
Reiteramos nuestro compromiso de seguir buscando formas para 
que la comunidad internacional pueda contribuir al 
cumplimiento de los objectivos de la Declaracion de Londres. 
 
3. Apoyamos la profundizacion de los mecanismos de dialogo 
entre el Gobierno de Colombia y la Sociedad Civil, 
representada por diferentes grupos de organizaciones 
no-gubermentales, y con la comunidad internacional, para una 
mejor coordinacion de la cooperacion internacional, de modo 
que el Gobierno pueda alcanzar los objectivos propuestos. 
Considerando el papel importante que juega la sociedad civil 
en una democracia abierta y transparente seria valiosa su 
participacion en la reunion de Cartagena. 
 
4. Si bien un largo camino por recorrer, tomamos nota de las 
distintas medidas que han sido y continuan siendo tomadas con 
miras a permitir el cumplimiento, por parte del Gobierno 
colombiano, de las Recomendaciones de la Oficina del Alto 
Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos. 
 El Gobierno de Colombia puede seguir contando con el apoyo 
de nuestros Gobiernos en este proposito. 
 
5. Destacamos la decision del Gobierno de Colombia de 
contribuir al cese del empleo de minas anti-personales, 
especialmente la destruccion de las reservas militares de las 
mismas.  Reconocemos tal medida como un importante paso y 
expresion del compromiso para la consolidacion del Derecho 
Internacional Humanitario en Colombia, y exhortamos a los 
grupos armados ilegales a seguir tal ejemplo, de modo que se 
proteja a la poblacion civil de los danos causados por el uso 
de las minas anti-personales. 
 
6. Senalamos que la superacion del conflicto y la obtencion 
de la paz con los grupos armados ilegales requieren un marco 
legal con enfasis en los principios de Verdad, Justicia, y 
Reparacion, que contemple el respeto a los Derechos Humanos y 
al Derecho Internacional Humanitario.  De igual modo, 
consideramos que los procesos de desmobilizacion deben 
abarcar mecanismos de desarme y estrategias claras de 
reinsercion de los individuos que se acojan a la 
desmovilizacion.  En ese sentido, invitamos al Gobierno a 
tomar las medidas necesarias. 
 
7. En este contexto reiteramos nuestro llamamiento a todos 
los grupos armados ilegales para que acuerden un cese de 
hostilidades y abran espacios a un dialogo de paz. 
 
8. Expresamos nuestra condena por las aberrantes practicas 
del secuestro, las desapariciones forzosas y las ejecuciones 
extra-judiciales.  Reiteramos la necesidad de que todas las 
personas secuestradas en Colombia sean liberadas 
inmediatamente. 
 
9. Reafirmamos nuestra condena al narcotrafico y a toda forma 
de violencia y todo acto terrorista, de los que, entre otros, 
son victimas la poblacion civil y especialmente los grupos 
mas vulnerables.  Recordamos entonces la necesidad de que 
tales actos sean juzgados con pleno respeto a los Derechos 
Humanos y al Derecho Internacional Humanitario. 
 
10. Creemos que es de extrema importancia reforzar los 
mecanismos especiales de apoyo y proteccion a los segmentos 
mas vulnerables de la sociedad colombiana, como son los 
desplazados, las comunidades indigenas y afro-colombianas, 
los lideres sindicales, los defensores de los Derechos 
Humanos y otros miembros de la sociedad civil que han sufrido 
amenazas, y en contra de sus familiares, y a las mujeres y 
ninos afectados por el conflicto y la crisis humanitaria. 
 
11. En consecuencia respaldamos el Plan de Accion Humanitaria 
y la forma participativa en que esta elaborando por el 
Gobierno, con el apoyo de la comunidad internacional y de la 
sociedad civil.  Esperamos la pronta conclusion del proceso. 
 
12. No podemos dejar de reconocer la importante contribucion 
del Sistema de las Naciones Unidas, de la Organizacion de los 
Estados Americanos, Organizaciones Internacionales y otros 
actores en Colombia en la busqueda de una solucion a los 
graves problemas de la poblacion afectada por las actividades 
de los grupos armados ilegales.  De modo muy especial, cabe 
igualmente destacar los esfuerzos emprendidos hacia la 
busqueda de una paz negociada. 
 
13. Igualmente reiteramos nuestro apoyo a la lucha contra el 
narcotrafico, a la eliminacion de la violencia que este 
conlleva y a las medidas para superar esta situacion. 
 
14. Finalmente, queremos expresar nuestra satisfaccion por la 
convocatoria a la reunion de alto nivel de seguimiento a la 
Declaracion de Londres, en Febrero de 2005.  Esperamos que la 
reunion fortalezca la eficacia y a la coordinacion de las 
actividades de cooperacion internacional, y pueda tomar nota 
de los avances de la implementacion de las Recomendaciones de 
la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de Derechos Humanos de las 
Naciones Unidas en Colombia.  Queremos resaltar que los 
logros en ese campo estan comenzando a constatarse.  Los 
avances que pueden ser vistos no deben impedir el 
reconocimiento de que aun hay que recorrer un largo camino, 
para que se puedan alcanzar conquistas duraderas y 
sonstenibles en la construccion de la paz. 
 
Muchas Gracias.

Father Dario Echeverri, Secretary General of the National 
Conciliation Commission (CCN) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
3. (C) Father Echeverri was optimistic that a meeting between 
the ELN and Mexican Government would create the right 
conditions for the launching of a formal peace process 
between the ELN and the GOC.  However, he said two major 
obstacles remained: (1) the FARC\'s control over the ELN; and 
(2) the ELN\'s belief that the Uribe administration was not 
committed to social and political reform.  Echeverri believed 
that the FARC was not serious about a peace process with the 
Uribe government, but said the Catholic Church would keep 
pressing for a humanitarian exchange and eventually a peace 
process.  He asserted that the best way to weaken the illegal 
armed groups was to have an effective reinsertion program, 
but expressed concern that the GOC\'s program was weak and 
poorly funded.  Echeverri acknowledged that the FARC and the 
Chavez administration have long-standing ties.  End Summary. 
 
4. (C) As Secretary General of National Conciliation 
Commission (CNN), Father Echeverri is authorized by the GOC 
to reach out to the illegal armed groups, particularly the 
FARC, to try start formal peace talks. 
 
------------------------------- 
ELN: Possible Meeting in Mexico 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Echeverri was hopeful that the proposed meeting 
between the ELN Central Command (COCE) and Mexican 
facilitator Ambassador Andres Valencia would help set 
conditions for a formal peace process.  He praised Valencia\'s 
efforts and said the ELN was likely to accept the conditions 
of the proposal, including suspending all violent activity 
while the meeting took place.  He said the ELN was seeking to 
gain political recognition.  However, two obstacles to formal 
negotiations remain: 
 
- The ELN is dependent on the FARC financially and 
militarily.  The FARC would control any ELN peace process 
with the Uribe administration.  The COCE does not have 
sufficient power over the group\'s combatant fronts to 
implement a peace process. 
 
- The ELN does not view the Uribe Administration as serious 
about meeting its demands for social reform.  Although Uribe 
has said he is not opposed to holding a national assembly, 
the ELN would not be satisfied with a one-time forum but 
rather wants concrete political concessions.  Echeverri said 
that he believed the Uribe administration should allocate as 
many resources to social programs as it does to the armed 
forces. 
 
6. (C) Echeverri agreed that the ELN is no longer a military 
threat but warned against discounting it altogether.  The 
December 13 capture of an ELN field commander powerful in 
Valle del Cauca Department was a serious blow to the group. 
He asserted that the ELN, nonetheless, has a significant 
social base in parts of Arauca, Narino, Santander, and Valle 
del Cauca Departments.  He noted that the group is not as 
deeply involved in drug trafficking as the FARC or the 
paramilitaries.  He hoped the group would eventually be held 
accountable for numerous kidnappings, including the 2002 
kidnapping of a 12 year-old boy whom they continue to hold 
for ransom.  He also expressed concern that ELN units could 
be absorbed into either the FARC or paramilitary groups. 
--------------------------------- 
FARC: Not Yet Serious About Peace 
--------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) In October, Echeverri met with the Swiss government to 
coordinate efforts to facilitate a humanitarian exchange. 
The Swiss have been authorized by the Uribe administration to 
reach out to the FARC to orchestrate an exchange.  Echeverri 
hoped that an exchange would be a first step toward an 
eventual peace process.  He pulled Shapiro aside at the end 
of the meeting to assure him that he is putting exactly the 
same priority on the three U.S. hostages as on the Colombian 
hostages.  He stressed that the FARC was not serious about 
holding negotiations with the Uribe administration in part 
because the country\'s widespread poverty provides the FARC 
with easy recruits, and Plan Patriota, in Echeverri\'s view, 
was not hurting the FARC.  For example, Echeverri claimed 
that FARC Secretariat member Mono Jojoy recently met with 
journalists in the middle of a Plan Patriota area of 
operations with minimal security. 
 
8. (C) Echeverri noted that the FARC was undergoing a 
leadership change, which he does not fully understand yet. 
He believes Secretariat member Raul Reyes may be sick and 
losing influence, while Secretariat member Alfonso Cano and 
subordinate Pablo Catatumbo are gaining power.  Echeverri has 
received invitations from both Reyes and Catatumbo to meet to 
discuss conditions for the humanitarian exchange.  He implied 
that there were some divergences among the FARC leaders that 
could possibly be exploited. 
 
------------------------ 
Reinsertion Program Weak 
------------------------ 
 
9. (C) Echeverri asserted that the best way to weaken the 
illegal armed groups was to offer the rank and file a better 
life as civilians.  He expressed concern that the 
government\'s reinsertion program for deserters and the 
demobilizing paramilitaries was not effective.  Without 
adequate funding to train and employ the deserters, they 
would return to a life of crime and violence. 
 
----------------------- 
Venezuelan Ties to FARC 
----------------------- 
 
10. (C) Echeverri acknowledged that the FARC have 
long-standing ties to Venezuela and President Chavez.  He is 
aware of at least one meeting between FARC Secretariat member 
Raul Reyes on December 26, 2003 in the Petare municipality in 
Caracas with GOV officials.  Echeverri noted that when 
Venezuela hosted meetings between the GOC and the FARC in the 
1990s, the FARC negotiators clearly were on friendly terms 
with the GOV officials.  Colombian Ambassador to Venezuela 
Enrique Vargas Ramirez is a member of the CCN, and Echeverri 
hopes Vargas can take advantage of GOV-FARC ties to reach out 
to the FARC through Venezuelan channels.

TAGS: PGOV, KJUS, CO 
SUBJECT: PEACE AND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS: A VIEW FROM THE 
DEMOCRATIC LEFT 
 
REF: BOGOTA 12860 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons: 1.5 B & D. 
 
1. (C) Summary: Leftist Senator Carlos Gaviria -- a 
self-declared presidential candidate in 2006 -- told poloffs 
to expect lawsuits against the recently approved 
constitutional amendment authorizing presidential reelection 
and expressed concerns about a possible clash between high 
courts over the issue.  He lamented the democratic left\'s 
inability to coalesce around a single candidate capable of 
challenging Uribe and suggested that former President Gaviria 
could shift the official Liberal Party to the right in 
alliance with Uribe.  He blamed the internal armed conflict 
on inequality of wealth and opportunity and complained that 
the security forces do not set a high enough human rights 
standard.  He will be an articulate presidential candidate, 
but his chances are poor.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On December 17, poloffs met with Senator Carlos 
Gaviria Diaz, former Constitutional Court Magistrate, current 
head of the center-left Democratic Alternative movement, and 
self-proclaimed 2006 presidential candidate.  In discussing 
Congress\'s recent passage of Constitutional reform 
legislation authorizing presidential reelection, Gaviria 
noted that any person can file suit (\"demanda\") against the 
legislation and said it is reasonable to expect a number of 
such suits in the near future.  He also expressed concern 
about a potential clash between two of the country\'s high 
courts -- the Constitutional Court and Council of State -- 
over the issue.  Gaviria acknowledged that President Uribe\'s 
popularity would be among the factors influencing the 
Constitutional Court\'s ultimate decision, but asserted that 
polls exaggerate the President\'s popularity. 
 
3. (SBU) Gaviria said it would be difficult for Colombia\'s 
democratic left to coalesce around a single presidential 
candidate, despite general agreement among leftist parties on 
a basic platform.  One factor is the continued high level of 
support for Uribe among the general public.  Another is that 
Bogota Mayor Luis Eduardo \"Lucho\" Garzon -- the left\'s most 
charismatic candidate, who has publicly declared he will not 
run for president in 2006 -- has concentrated on municipal 
administration and pulled away from purely political debate 
and infighting.  (Note: Per reftel, the reelection law would 
permit Garzon to run if he resigns as mayor one year prior to 
the presidential election scheduled for May 2006.  End Note.) 
 According to Gaviria, Garzon has distanced himself from the 
Independent Democratic Pole party (\"Polo Democratico 
Independiente,\" or PDI) in recent months.  PDI leaders 
Antonio Navarro and Samuel Moreno both have presidential 
aspirations, but neither is competitive in public opinion 
polls at this time. 
 
4. (SBU) Regarding the struggling official Liberal Party, 
Gaviria predicted former Colombian President and OAS 
Secretary General Cesar Gaviria may seek to take control of 
 
SIPDIS 
the party and lead it in a so-called \"neoliberal\" direction. 
To do so, however, the former President would have to 
overcome opposition from the party\'s vocal social democratic 
wing.  Gaviria said the former President might also move the 
party toward open support for Uribe\'s reelection.  However, 
the \"horse trading\" to get Liberal Party support could strain 
the Conservative Party\'s support for Uribe.  Some 
conservatives, while loyal to Uribe as a party, perceive that 
Uribe has taken them for granted and would probably resent 
any concessions Uribe might make to gain the support of his 
former party\'s official structure. 
5. (SBU) For Gaviria, former President Andres Pastrana\'s 
failed appeasement policy with the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia (FARC) was politically motivated and poorly 
negotiated, failing to exhaust the possibilities for a 
negotiated settlement.  Uribe\'s Democratic Security Policy 
correctly focuses on achieving public order through expanded 
state control, but has lost legitimacy because the security 
forces have not maintained standards sufficiently superior to 
those of the illegal armed groups they are trying to subdue. 
Gaviria offered frequent cases of mass detentions as an 
example of the state\'s failure to live up to its obligations. 
 
6. (C) Comment: Gaviria is one of the loudest voices of the 
center-left.  He was realistic about his slim prospects in 
the presidential campaign, continually pointing to Uribe\'s 
approval numbers and the lack of coordinated center-left 
opposition.

------ 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) In 2003 and 2004, the GOC demobilized over 3,600 
paramilitaries from the AUC.  They turned in well over 1,000 
weapons and other supplies, which were inventoried by the OAS 
verification mission.  2005 will be the most challenging year 
for the peace process; the GOC is commited to demobilizing 
the rest of the AUC, facilitating its successful 
participation in the government\'s reinsertion program, and 
establishing a legal framework for those who are guilty of 
serious crimes.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Almost 3,000 Demobilized in 2004 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In 2004, the GOC demobilized 2,627 members of the 
United Self Defense Forces (AUC), including five separate 
blocs and senior commander Salvatore Mancuso and bloc 
commander Ever Veloza Garcia (alias Hernan Hernandez).  The 
OAS verification mission oversaw and inventoried the weapons 
turned in to the GOC: 
 
- November 25: 452 paramilitaries from the Bananero Bloc 
turned in 245 rifles, 2 machine guns, 6 grenade launchers, 4 
mortars, 4 semi-automatic machine guns, 2 carbines, 6 shot 
guns, 38 pistols, 44 revolvers, 232 grenades, 1 flare gun, 
41,016 bullets, 482 camouflage shirts, 439 camouflage pants, 
147 travel supplies, 262 weapons carriers, 61 radios, 2 base 
radios, and miscellaneous accessories. 
 
- December 4: 47 paramilitaries from southern Magdalena 
Department turned in 26 rifles, 3 semi-automatic machine 
guns, 1 machine gun, 1 hand-made mortar, 6 pistols, 3 
revolvers, 1 shot gun, and numerous rounds of ammunition, 
grenades, and radios. 
 
- December 9: 147 paramilitaries in Cundinamarca Department 
turned in 104 rifles, 3 machine guns, 3 grenade launchers, 4 
shot guns, 2 carbines, 18 pistols, 6 mortars, ammunition, 
miscellaneous, radios, and explosives 
 
- December 10: 1,425 paramilitaries from the Catatumbo Bloc 
turned in 983 rifles and shotguns, 10 machine guns, 19 
semi-automatic machine guns, 25 grenade launchers, 21 
mortars, 47 pistols, and 15 revolvers, 556 hand grenades, 201 
mortar grenades, 183 rifle grenades, 3 smoke grenades, 268 
MGL grenades, numerous radios, and explosives 
 
- December 18: 556 paramilitaries from the Calima Bloc turned 
in 316 long arms, 62 short arms, 15 semi-automatic machine 
guns, 14 pistols, 33 revolvers, 27 support weapons, 1,008 
miscellaneous supplies, 2,500 chains, 83 hand grenades, 51 
40mm grenades, 10 mortars, 2 rifle grenades, 51 radios, 
uniforms, and travel supplies. 
 
Total demobilized: 2,627 
 
----------------------- 
2003: 1,000 Demobilized 
----------------------- 
 
3. (U) The GOC held two small demobilizations in 2003.  The 
first, on November 25, involved 874 members of the AUC\'s 
Cacique Nutibara Bloc in Medellin.  Of the entire block, 17 
have died, 34 are serving time in jail mostly for 
non-pardonable crimes commited before demobilization, and the 
government has lost track of four.  The remaining 819 are 
participating in the GOC\'s reinsertion program and being 
tracked by the electronic monitoring and evaluation system. 
Second, on December 7, 150 paramilitaries of the independent 
Self Defense Forces of Ortega in Cauca Department 
demobilized.  They are not participating in the reinsertion 
program, but instead the GOC is building roads in the region 
and providing vocational training.  These demobilizations 
occured before the OAS agreed to verify the process.  For 
this reason, an inventory of weapons turned in is not 
available. 
 
------------------------ 
2005: A Bigger Challenge 
------------------------ 
 
4. (U) The AUC agreed to demobilize its entire structure by 
the end of 2005.  The GOC has three important, costly tasks 
to complete in 2005: 
 
1. Demobilize the rest of the AUC: the AUC claims to have 
20,000 members, and the GOC has based its budget needs on 
this figure, which leaves approximately 16,000 paramilitaries 
to be demobilized.  Post estimates the AUC had between 12,000 
and 15,000 before the demobilizations began, but paramilitary 
family members and support networks will increase the number 
to demobilize. 
 
2. Reinsertion: paramilitaries who demobilize and are not 
guilty of serious crimes join the GOC\'s reinsertion program, 
which offers job training, basic humanitarian assistance, and 
employment.  The GOC is responsible for successfully moving 
them through the program and turning them into productive 
citizens.  Otherwise, former paramilitaries are likely to 
return to a criminal lifestyle. 
 
3. Legal framework: the GOC needs to establish a legal 
framework to hold accountable former paramilitaries guilty of 
major crimes.  It is considering calling an extraordinary 
congressional session in February to debate the Law of 
Justice and Reparations, which calls for -- among other 
things -- mandatory jail time, confession, reparations to 
victims, and cooperation with authorities.

1. (SBU) Summary: Passage of presidential reelection 
reform and implementing legislation for a new criminal 
procedure code were the principal accomplishments of the 
last session of Congress.  Political wrangling prevented 
the Congress from dealing effectively with key pension and 
tax reform bills.  Media coverage claiming Congressional 
indolence, a circus-like appearance before Congress by 
paramilitary leaders, and a decision by the Constitutional 
Court to strike down anti-terrorism legislation based on 
procedural irregularities were low points.  President 
Uribe has continued to maintain high approval ratings in 
spite of tension with the Legislative Branch.  Congress is 
ignoring public opinion at its own peril.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The most notable accomplishment of the July- 
December Congressional session was passage of 
Constitutional reform to permit presidential reelection 
(ref A).  That issue occupied a large portion of the 
Congressional agenda during the period.  In addition, 
Congress passed (and the President signed) a new criminal 
procedure code (ref B), which will bring an accusatory 
(oral) criminal justice system into force on January 1 in 
Bogota and the Coffee Region Departments (Caldas, Quindio, 
and Risaralda).  Congress also passed legislation to 
implement the new penal code and organizational law of the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office (Fiscalia) and completed the 
first two of the required four rounds of approval of 
pension reform legislation, including measures to end 
additional monthly payments and special pension regimes 
and cap the highest pensions at 25 times the minimum wage. 
 
3. (SBU) Congress was unable to pass legislation on tax 
reform, a key component of President Uribe\'s domestic 
agenda, and the prolonged impasse over the issue 
negatively impacted the session\'s productivity.  Working 
together with the GOC, various proposals were floated in 
Congress concerning changes to the value added tax (VAT). 
Debate centered on expanding the basket of taxable items 
at a lower rate, or raising the VAT on currently taxed 
items.  Toward the end of the session, lawmakers from the 
Conservative (normally allied with the President) and 
Officialist Liberal Parties, and several small left-of- 
center movements, walked out, killing fiscal reform for 
2004. 
 
4.  (SBU) Uribista (pro-Uribe) Liberals reneged on earlier 
commitments to Conservatives, Officialist Liberals, and 
center-left movements to support a so-called \"Opposition 
Statute,\" which would have mandated that the second-place 
party in presidential elections be awarded the 
directorships of governmental watchdog agencies such as 
the Inspector General\'s Office (Procuraduria) and the 
Comptroller (Contraloria).  The backlash from 
Conservatives over this issue torpedoed other key pieces 
of legislation.  The \"Bancadas\" law, geared toward 
strengthening internal party discipline within the 
Congress, is under consideration by the House but has made 
little progress.  The legislation, which would require the 
naming of whips and would strictly allocate debate time 
based on party size, has met with resistance from the 
small center-left parties, Officialist Liberals, and even 
some Uribistas. 
 
5. (SBU) Media attention on empty plenary sessions, early 
suspension of planned debates, and other signs of 
procedural wrangling caused a deterioration of the 
public\'s already low opinion of Congress.  Of all public 
institutions in Colombia, the Congress is consistently 
viewed in the most negative light in major polls. 
Congress\' standing with the public and leading media 
outlets also suffered from the circus-like atmosphere of 
an appearance in Congress by paramilitary commanders in 
July (ref D).  In addition, the Constitutional Court\'s 
decision to strike down controversial anti-terrorism 
legislation passed by Congress (ref C) called the 
institution\'s deliberative mechanisms into question.  The 
Court overturned the legislation based on alleged coercion 
and fraudulent vote counting.  Tension between the 
Congress and high courts--including draft legislation to 
abolish the Constitutional Court--could spill over into 
2005 as the Court hears suits brought against various 
pieces of legislation. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment:  With Congressional and Presidential 
elections scheduled for March and May 2006, respectively, 
the relationship between the executive and legislative 
branches will grow more politicized.  Some of the proposed 
tax measures would affect middle and upper-middle class 
Colombians, and are a difficult sell.  In addition, 
members of Congress are starting to focus on their 
reelection prospects, and their voting will become even 
more focused on local issues, including patronage and 
pork, two areas in which Uribe has not been willing to 
accommodate legislators.  Uribe\'s integrity may have 
earned points with voters, but not with the legislators, 
who would benefit from more political largesse.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.(C) With USG assistance, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe 
has made great strides in fighting drug trafficking and 
terrorism.  The security forces have initiated a nation-wide, 
multi-phased campaign to capture or kill key FARC leaders, 
moved against the FARC in its rural strongholds, and 
reestablished a presence in the country\'s 1,098 
municipalities.  Inter-service and civil-military cooperation 
and Colombia\'s human rights record, although imperfect, are 
improving.  Uribe\'s support in Congress has dampened since he 
took office but he has managed to push through some important 
legislation.  Three U.S. citizens have been held hostage by 
the FARC for over 20 months now.  Their safe recovery 
continues to be one of our top priorities.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
URIBE IS SHOWING RESULTS 
------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) Assistance to Colombia is premised on combating the 
interrelated issues of drug trafficking and terrorism and 
includes training, material aid, and guidance to the security 
forces and other institutions.  President Uribe and Colombian 
Minister of Defense (MOD) Jorge Alberto Uribe (not related) 
have characterized U.S. assistance as key to the GOC\'s 
\"Democratic Security Policy\" and acknowledged the United 
States as Colombia\'s most important ally.  More than halfway 
through his four-year term, Uribe has made the country safer 
and more stable economically by implementing the following 
strategies to promote security and economic recovery: 
 
-- Plan Patriota: The military\'s multi-phased, joint campaign 
to re-establish control over national territory and cripple 
the FARC entered its second major stage (2B) in February 
2004, an approximately 18 to 24 month-long phase to target 
FARC-dominated regions in remote, tropical, southeastern 
Colombia.  The security forces have gained control over 
numerous FARC mobility nodes and reporting indicates that the 
FARC are feeling the effects of the campaign.  Phase 2B is 
logistically complex and supply shortages have caused 
setbacks.  The government will need to establish a permanent 
presence in newly occupied territory to prevent the FARC from 
returning.  The U.S. MILGRP has Planning and Assistance 
Training Teams (PATTs) to assist Plan Patriota.  During the 
campaign\'s first phase (2A) in 2003, the military dealt the 
FARC heavy blows in Cundinamarca Department, which surrounds 
Bogota, killing important mid-level commanders and destroying 
the FARC\'s 22nd Front and several special mobile columns. 
 
-- State Presence Established Nationwide: Upon taking office, 
Uribe pledged to establish a permanent security force 
presence in the 158 municipalities (equivalent to U.S. 
counties) that lacked a military or police garrison.  As of 
January 4, all 1,098 municipalities had a police presence. 
The USG facilitated this effort by training numerous police 
units and building hardened police stations.  Police 
commanders have reported that most communities have welcomed 
the new presence and that it has boosted the economy by 
providing safe transportation and tourist protection. 
 
-- AUC: The country\'s largest paramilitary group declared a 
unilateral cease-fire in November 2002; formal peace talks, 
including an agreement to begin demobilizing, began in July 
2003; and 19 senior AUC commanders with several hundred 
bodyguards concentrated in a 12 x 12 mile zone surrounded by 
police and military in June 2004.  Two small-scale 
demobilizations occurred in late 2003 and AUC violence 
continues at a comparatively low level.  The OAS is verifying 
the peace process.  On October 7, paramilitary leaders 
pledged to demobilize between 3,000 and 4,000 of their 
members between November 3 and the end of 2004.  The GOC 
remains committed to a transparent, legitimate peace process 
and has made it clear that extradition is a non-negotiable 
issue and will not hinder any U.S. extradition petitions. 
 
-- U.S. Assistance to Deserters, Demobilized: After a \"no 
objection\" ruling was issued by the Department of Justice in 
August, the U.S. has been able to support financially the 
child combatant program.  The U.S. is now the largest 
contributor to the program.  Justice is still working on a 
legal opinion on U.S. funding for the broader reinsertion 
program in light of provisions of the Patriot Act barring aid 
to members of terrorist groups. 
 
-- Drug Eradication On Schedule to Meet Goals: For coca, 
130,000 hectares have been sprayed and 12,000 hectares 
eradicated manually. We have sprayed 3,000 hectares of opium 
poppy and eradicated another 1,200 manually.  Manual 
eradication remains problematic, however, as is spraying in 
parks.  The Council of State recently ruled to reinstate the 
aerial spray program following a brief suspension based on 
allegations of damage to health and environment by 
glyphosate.  However, ongoing appeals still threaten the 
process. 
 
-- Drug Interdiction: We are heading for records in air, 
land, and sea interdiction; i.e., more than 140 tons have 
been seized.  There is substantial interest here about the 
Brazilian air interdiction program and the possibility of 
U.S. cooperation with it. 
 
3. (C) Almost a year ago, Uribe named a new MOD and high 
command with an eye toward improving cooperation and 
rewarding operational performers.  Uribe and his security 
team have emphasized that inter-service and civil-military 
cooperation and intelligence-based operations are key to 
success.  Nevertheless, long-standing institutional rivalries 
are an on-going challenge.  Changes to the high command, 
possibly including a new Armed Forces Commander and Army 
Commander, are expected in December.  We enjoy excellent 
relations with MOD Uribe, Navy Commander Admiral Soto, and 
Air Force Commander General Lesmez.  Our ties with Armed 
Forces Commander General Ospina and Army Commander General 
Carreno, while mostly good, are sometimes strained. 
 
----------------- 
INTERNAL POLITICS 
----------------- 
 
4. (C) Executive-legislative relations have been tense. 
Uribe\'s presidential reelection initiative, however, has 
passed its eight required debates, and only the Plenary vote 
remains.  Most observers are guardedly optimistic about its 
passage.  The mandatory review by the Constitutional Court 
that will follow is less certain.  The Administration\'s 
pension reforms and a new tax on certain basic food products 
-- controversial proposals that have already provoked 
negative reactions from members of Congress )- face tougher 
sledding.  The Uribe administration and several Congressmen 
are working to revamp and reintroduce a \"Justice and 
Reparations\" bill -- which would allow the GOC to issue 
alternate penalties and reparations requirements on 
demobilizing paramilitaries -- before the current legislative 
session closes. 
 
------------------- 
MULTILATERAL ISSUES 
------------------- 
 
5. (C) The GOC consistently votes for U.S.-supported 
candidates for multilateral boards and commissions.  However, 
on Middle East issues, in particular Israeli-Palestinian 
matters, the GOC seldom supports our position.  The GOC was 
pleased with the United Nations Human Rights Commission (CHR) 
Chairman\'s Statement on Colombia and has expressed 
appreciation for our support.  We are skeptical that the GOC 
will take a stronger position on the crisis of democracy in 
Venezuela.  Recent border incidents have contributed to 
Uribe\'s careful diplomacy with Hugo Chavez.  Colombia is 
similarly reluctant to speak out against Cuba. 
 
------------------------------------- 
GOC Generally Attuned to Human Rights 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The GOC maintains an active human rights dialogue with 
NGOs, the United Nations, and foreign governments.  Human 
rights training is mandatory for all members of the military 
and police, and the Embassy vets units that receive USG 
assistance.  The State Department\'s 2003 Human Rights Report 
on Colombia noted that GOC efforts to improve security had 
led to major improvements in key human rights and violence 
indicators.  For example, homicides fell by 20 percent, 
kidnappings by 30 percent, and forced displacements by 49 
percent in 2003.  Less than 2 percent of human rights 
violations are attributable to government security forces. 
However, most Colombian NGOs remain severely critical of the 
GOC.  Recent missteps by the armed forces, such a 
police-military clash in Narino Department (Guaitarilla), the 
murder of three trade unionists in Arauca, and the mysterious 
circumstances surrounding the killing of a family of five by 
the Army in rural Tolima Department (Cajamarca), show a need 
for further improvement in respect for human rights by the 
security forces. 
-------------------------------------------- 
FARC Continues to Hold U.S. Citizens Hostage 
-------------------------------------------- 
7. (C) In February 2003, a DOD plane carrying four USG 
contractors and a Colombian military representative crashed 
in FARC-controlled territory in southern Colombia.  The FARC 
killed one of the U.S. contractors and the Colombian and took 
the other three U.S. citizens hostage.  We believe they are 
being held in a remote, heavily forested region the FARC has 
long controlled and to which the Colombian military has 
little access.  Since the contractors were kidnapped, we have 
worked closely with the GOC to track all leads that could 
reveal their location.  President Uribe has personally 
pledged GOC cooperation and support in any effort to rescue 
the hostages.  As part of our efforts to secure their 
recovery, we initiated the Rewards for Justice Program, which 
offers up to USD five million in exchange for information 
leading to the capture of FARC commanders or other 
individuals involved in the kidnapping.  President Uribe has 
also given personal assurances that he would insist the U.S. 
hostages be included in any \"humanitarian exchange\" with the 
FARC. 
 
--------------- 
Economic Issues 
--------------- 
 
8. (U) In the third quarter of 2004, Colombia\'s macroeconomic 
forecast showed strong growth in multiple areas. Increased 
exports, a strong peso, and low inflation led the way and 
helped to decrease the debt and increase investment. Foreign 
Direct Investment for 2004 is currently at a five year high. 
While the government is optimistic, many analysts worry that 
unemployment remains high and fiscal reforms have not been 
passed through Congress.  These factors make the long-term 
outlook less clear. 
 
9. (U) The fifth round of FTA talks finished in Guayaquil, 
Ecuador on October 29.  Slow movement overall with 
intellectual property and agriculture continue to be major 
issues, specifically patents, medications, agricultural 
subsidies and access to genetic resources. To increase public 
awareness, Colombian lawmakers have begun a robust FTA 
outreach program to compliment other FTA forums sponsored by 
the GOC with assistance from USAID. 
 
10. (U) The central bank has taken advantage of a strong peso 
by purchasing additional reserves and paying off it dollar 
denominated debt.  Analysts expect that if the peso ends 
December at its current level (instead of the 2,900 that the 
government had originally forecast) the GOC will save CP 620 
billion (238 million USD) in debt servicing.  Recently, the 
central bank has been purchasing dollars in order to curb the 
appreciation of the peso.

------ 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On November 27, Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos 
Restrepo briefed Ambassador on developments in the peace 
process with the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia 
(AUC): 
 
-- Bananero Bloc: demobilization is complete.  Thirty-seven 
are implicated in major crimes and will stay in the 
demobilization zone. The rest will report to the reinsertion 
center in Turbo. 
 
-- Catatumbo Bloc: next to demobilize.  The Army has devoted 
a counterguerrilla battalion from Arauca to secure the area. 
 
-- Cordoba: Protests from cattle ranchers fearful of FARC 
retaliation forced Restrepo to halt demobilization.  He is 
concerned but working with the military to secure the area. 
 
-- Elmer Cardenas Bloc: the independent paramilitary group 
powerful in Choco and coastal Antioquia agreed not to invade 
former Bananero Bloc territory and proposed a peace process 
with several conditions short of declaration of a cease-fire. 
 The Bloc commander claims the Marines are complicit in drug 
trafficking by illegal armed groups and independent 
traffickers in the area.  Restrepo believes trafficking is a 
growing problem along the border with Panama. 
 
-- Others: Small groups in Cundinamarca and southern 
Magdalena Departments will be completed this year.  Three 
blocs in Valle del Cauca and Cauca Departments are scheduled 
for early 2005.  Restrepo is concerned about drug traffickers 
taking over the territory. 
 
2. (C) Restrepo said the GOC will unilaterally release up to 
50 imprisoned FARC guerrillas to prove its commitment to 
securing the release of FARC hostages.  Restrepo advised the 
GOC to publicize its latest draft of the Law for Justice and 
Reparations but wait until March to present it formally to 
Congress.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Bananero Bloc Demobilization Completed 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Restrepo expressed satisfaction with the November 25 
demobilization of the Bananero Bloc in Turbo, Antioquia 
Deparment (ref A).  On November 29, the demobilized 
paramilitaries guilty only of membership in an illegal armed 
group will depart the demobilization zone and report to the 
reinsertion center.  There are 37, including Bloc Commander 
Ever Velosa (\"Hernan Hernandez\"), accused of serious crimes 
who will remain in the demobilization zone.  Restrepo is 
working with the Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\") to 
bring investigators to the zone to interview the 
paramilitaries and process their cases.  The police and 
military increased their presence to secure the areas 
formerly controlled by the Bananero Bloc.  Even in the 
conflictive area of Nuevo Antioquia, police coverage 
prevented nearly all residents from fleeing the area in fear 
of guerrilla retaliation. 
 
------------------- 
Catatumbo Bloc Next 
------------------- 
 
4. (C) President Uribe authorized Restrepo to begin the 
demobilization of the Catatumbo Bloc in Norte de Santander 
Department on November 29.  It is the largest and most 
well-armed bloc to demobilize this year.  The 1,500 members 
have at least 900 weapons.  The Army will move a 
counterguerrilla battalion from Arauca Department to the 
areas formerly dominated by the Catatumbo Bloc, and Restrepo 
discussed with Counternarcotics Police Commander General 
Gomez the possibility of increasing aerial eradication. 
Ideally, Restrepo would like Navy patrols on the Catatumbo 
River and aerial coverage from the Air Force but neither 
service has identified resources to do so, although they know 
security must be improved.  The Presidential Council for 
Social Action is preparing social outreach and civic action 
projects. 
 
--------------- 
Cordoba Delayed 
--------------- 
5. (C) Restrepo tried to begin demobilizing parts of 
Mancuso\'s Northern Bloc in Cordoba Department but protests 
from local cattle ranchers forced him to stop.  They view the 
paramilitaries as necessary to their security and fear the 
security forces are not prepared to prevent the FARC from 
entering the area, especially on the coast where drug 
trafficking flourishes.  They threatened to take up arms if 
necessary.  The FARC have a presence in northern (Abibe 
mountain range), southern (Nudo de Paramillo) and eastern 
(Puerto Libano) Cordoba.  First Division Commander General 
Montoya, who has been named to lead a pilot inter-service 
unit for the Caribbean coast, will travel to Cordoba on 
November 30 to coordinate security.  Plans include using at 
least two helicopters, a counterguerrilla battalion, and a 
separate battalion on the coast. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Elmer Cardenas Bloc Still Skeptical 
----------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) In mid-November Restrepo met with \"Aleman,\" commander 
of the independent Elmer Cardenas Bloc (ECB), which operates 
in Choco and coastal Antioquia Departments, has 1,500 ) 
1,800 members, and is well-financed and organized.  Aleman 
agreed not to invade former Bananero Bloc territory and gave 
Restrepo an 11-point peace process proposal, which did not 
include a declaration of a cease-fire.  He claims, with some 
accuracy, that the ECB is in regular contact with the FARC, 
and therefore could not comply with a full cease-fire.  His 
conditions include a mutual cease-fire in exchange for an 
increased presence of security forces in nine specific areas, 
financial support for his troops, and negotiations on 
regional political issues.  Aleman has complained that some 
members of the Marines cooperate with drug traffickers. 
Restrepo asserted that the drug trafficking industry on the 
coast near Panama is growing quickly, and that the security 
forces do not appear to be well informed about the extent of 
the problem. 
 
------------------------------ 
Other Upcoming Demobilizations 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Restrepo does not expect difficulties with two small 
demobilizations planned in Cundinamarca and southern 
Magdalena Departments later this year.  Demobilizing the 
paramilitary groups on the conflictive eastern plains 
(\"Llanos\") continues to be problematic.  In early 2005, 
Restrepo plans to demobilize Hernan Hernandez\'s Calima Bloc, 
Diego Murillo\'s (\"Don Berna\") Pacific Bloc, and Pablo 
Sevillano\'s Liberators of the South in Valle del Cauca and 
Cauca Departments.  Restrepo is concerned about the Valle 
Cartel\'s ability to take over former paramilitary territory. 
He estimates there are at least 4,000 hectares of coca in the 
area.  Restrepo said the GOC will unilaterally release up to 
50 imprisoned FARC guerrillas to prove its commitment to 
securing the release of FARC hostages. 
 
------------------------------- 
Law for Justice and Reparations 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The GOC revised its April version of the Law for 
Justice and Reparations to include some aspects of Senator 
Rafael Pardo\'s draft (ref B).  Restrepo advised President 
Uribe and the Minister of Interior and Justice to hold public 
debate on the draft and present it formally to Congress as 
urgent legislation when Congress re-convenes in March. 
Restrepo is concerned that there is not enough time left in 
this year\'s legislative session to get the bill passed.  He 
noted, however, that it was not his decision.  The Ambassador 
asserted that it was important to get a workable law passed 
as soon as possible.

SUBJECT: FISCALIA INVESTIGATES TAOIST COMMUNITY IN 
SANTANDER DEPARTMENT 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: On November 25, officials from the Office of 
the Prosecutor General (\"Fiscalia\") raided a Taoist commune 
located in a remote region of Santander Department to 
investigate allegations that the commune\'s leadership was 
involved in opium production and kidnapping.  The allegations 
were raised by eight former commune members, four of whom 
have been murdered in recent months.  Authorities entered the 
commune with arrest warrants for twelve commune members and 
are investigating possible involvement of commune leaders in 
the murders of the four informants.  Commune leaders have 
denied any wrongdoing and allege the raid was part of a 
larger GOC plot to close down the commune.  International Red 
Cross (ICRC) representatives departed the scene on November 
29 after determining no violation of international 
humanitarian law had been committed.  Although commune 
leaders say many residents are foreigners, post has been 
unable to verify whether any U.S. citizens are present.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) On November 25, a team of Fiscalia prosecutors and 
judicial investigators -- accompanied by approximately 400 
personnel from the Colombian National Police (CNP), Colombian 
Army (COLAR), Department of Administrative Security (DAS), 
and Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) -- raided 
the Templo Vegetal Sakroakuarius, a Taoist commune located in 
rural Taladro municipality, Santander Department.  The raid 
was based on information provided by eight former commune 
members alleging the commune\'s leadership was engaged in 
illegal activities, including opium production and 
kidnapping.  Some informants alleged the commune holds some 
residents there against their will.  According to media 
reports, four of the eight informants have been murdered by 
hitmen in the past three months.  The remaining four have 
been placed in the Fiscalia\'s witness protection program. 
 
3. (U) Prosecutors entered the commune compound, located in a 
remote, mountainous area, with arrest warrants for twelve 
commune members charged with possession of illegal arms and 
kidnapping.  (None of the twelve were present when the 
prosecutors arrived.)  Two of the informants -- wearing hoods 
to protect their identities -- accompanied prosecutors. 
According to media reports, the Fiscalia confiscated four 
grenades, ten radios, vehicles with foreign license plates, 
and three motorcycles.  In a press interview, General 
Hipolito Herrera told reporters the police are investigating 
whether the commune\'s leadership ordered the murders of the 
four informants.  Post has not yet been able to confirm this 
information with the Fiscalia.  The commune\'s leadership has 
repeatedly denied any involvement in kidnapping, narcotics 
trafficking, or other illegal activities. 
 
4. (C) The commune\'s leadership claims the Fiscalia\'s raid is 
part of a larger plot designed to close down the commune and 
has alleged that COLAR personnel have forced more than 200 
families to evacuate the compound.  The community\'s isolation 
in a region with a significant guerrilla presence makes it 
difficult to gather accurate information.  However, ICRC 
representatives told us their personnel departed the area on 
November 29 after determining the incident was out of ICRC\'s 
jurisdiction because no violation of international 
humanitarian law had been committed.  The number of commune 
residents is unknown.  According to an urgent action e-mail 
issued by commune leaders, the commune\'s members are citizens 
of Colombia, the United States, and a number of Western 
European and Latin American countries.  Although ICRC 
verified the presence of British and Salvadoran citizens, 
post has been unable to confirm whether any U.S. citizens are 
residents of the commune.

1.  (U) On November 30, the House of Representatives 
approved legislation to reform the Constitution to permit 
Presidential reelection (two terms maximum).  Each article 
of the legislation was voted and passed in the range of 
100-115 (of 166 total members) in favor.  The only 
remaining legislative step is a conference committee 
process, which must take place by December 15. 
Subsequently, the nine-member Constitutional Court will 
review the legislation on procedural grounds.  The Court 
will recess from mid-December until early February, and 
its decision is not expected prior to mid-February.  The 
next Presidential election will occur in May 2006. 
 
2.  (SBU) The conference committee will determine whether 
or not to maintain the prohibition on officials elected in 
2003 (including the mayor of Bogota) running for President 
in 2006.  Our Congressional contacts are confident the 
status quo will prevail.  How the conference committee 
handles the legislation could affect the Constitutional 
Court\'s review process.  While the Court did strike down 
anti-terrorism legislation earlier this year, the margin 
of passage in the House on that legislation was one vote.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIANS CREATE NEW CARIBBEAN JOINT COMMAND FOR 
INTER-SERVICE COOPERATION 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (U) On November 17, the Colombian military (COLMIL) 
announced the creation of a new joint command for the 
Caribbean coastal region, designed to maximize the military\'s 
assets in that area.  The Caribbean Joint Command will cover 
the area from La Guajira Department in northeast Colombia to 
Choco Department bordering Panama in the northwest when it 
becomes operational later this month.  Major General Mario 
Montoya Uribe, who gained fame as commander of the 
counter-narcotics Joint Task Force South in southeastern 
Colombia from 1999 to 2000, will direct the Caribbean Joint 
Command while also remaining in command of the Army\'s First 
Division.  In his new role, Montoya will have operational 
command over 40,000 Army troops from the Second, Fourth, 
Tenth, Eleventh and Seventeenth Brigades; 10,000 sailors and 
marines from the Caribbean Naval Force; and elements of the 
Third and Fifth Air Combat Commands of the Colombian Air 
Force.  He will also have a stand-alone staff for the Joint 
Command. 
 
2. (C) The new Caribbean Joint Command builds off the 
successes of Joint Task Force Omega.  JTF-Omega\'s \"Plan 
Patriota\" operations against the FARC in southeastern 
Colombia have been among the best examples of joint 
operations and cross-service cooperation in Colombia to date. 
 Although the Caribbean operations will differ from JTF-Omega 
actions in that there will not be a single campaign with one 
constant target, COLMIL officials hope that a joint command 
will improve the coordination and effectiveness of the 
COLMIL\'s Caribbean operations.  Montoya\'s long-standing 
military experience will probably aid him in establishing an 
inter-service force and in improving the synchronization of 
COLMIL resources in the north.  Each service will still be 
responsible for providing the resources and command structure 
outside of joint command operations. 
 
3. (C) COLMIL contacts said this experiment could lead to 
further joint commands in other areas.  While independent 
commanders may chafe at the new command structure, it could 
help improve missions and reduce the possibility of 
inter-service rivalry.

REF: BOGOTA 12188

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) The GOC has begun demobilization of the 3,000-4,000 
United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) by the end of 
2004.  According to OAS mission chief Sergio Caramagna and 
staff, they are being forced to improvise and go without key 
supplies, including tables, phones, and bathrooms.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
Scrambling to Keep Up the Pace 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) On December 1, OAS mission chief Caramagna and his 
deputy described the demobilization of the Bananero Bloc in 
Turbo on November 25 (reftel). 
 
3. (U)  The reinsertion center did not have tables, enough 
computers, or even a working bathroom on the morning of the 
29th when 40 former paramilitaries reported at 8:00 a.m. as 
scheduled.  OAS and GOC personnel were forced to borrow 
plastic tables from the neighborhood and make do with the few 
computers they had available.  They managed to open the 
center on time, and as of December 1, had successfully 
processed 220 former paramilitaries.  Each has been 
interviewed by the Prosecutor General\'s Office (\"Fiscalia\") 
and Department of Administrative Security (DAS, rough FBI 
equivalent), issued a special identification card from the 
Registrar\'s Office, had dental identification records taken, 
enrolled in reinsertion programs, and met with the OAS.  In 
order to issue provisional reinsertion identification cards 
to all 452 Bananero Bloc paramilitaries, one official from 
the Peace Commissioner\'s Office slept only two hours a night 
for three days until the cards were complete.  He had no 
assistance and was forced to borrow a closet in the back of a 
local pharmacy in Turbo for his office space and use slow, 
antiquated printers.  Caramanga expressed doubt if the GOC 
could manage to issue 1,500 when the Catatumbo Bloc 
demobilizes later this month. 
 
-------------------- 
Insufficient Funding 
-------------------- 
 
4. (U) Through USAID, the U.S. has given the OAS mission 
approximately USD 850,000.  This funding will run out in 
January.  Other donors are: 
 
- Sweden: technical assistance, including an in-country 
adviser and several vehicles. 
 
- Bahamas: USD 5,000 
 
- Holland: has agreed to donate 800,000 Euros which should be 
available soon. 
 
5. (U) These limited resources do not cover the mission\'s 
needs.  For example, the mission has only four satellite 
phones (cellular phones do not work in most of the areas 
where the demobilizations occur).  The GOC has four 
reinsertion centers and plans to open eight more by the end 
of the year.  All of these centers will have to be staffed 
with at least two OAS officials each, in addition to the six 
offices the OAS already has nationwide.  Caramagna has been 
reaching out to the diplomatic corps in Bogota, and will 
travel to Washington on December 8 to plead for more 
resources from OAS member countries. 
 
6. (U) The Peace Commissioner\'s Office has similarly tight 
resources.  Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo has told 
us that his budget will cover the demobilization of 3,000 
paramilitaries in 2004 but funding for 2005 is unclear.  The 
GOC estimates it faces a deficit of about USD 130 million to 
demobilize the entire AUC, not including OAS verification and 
some parts of the government reinsertion program.

REF: BOGOTA 11207 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (U) On December 2, the GOC pardoned 23 imprisoned members 
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  Those 
pardoned were guilty only of membership in an illegal armed 
group; no guerrillas guilty of violent crimes were eligible 
for pardon.  They will be released from prisons throughout 
the country on December 3 and have pledged not to return to 
the armed conflict.  They will be eligible to enter the GOC\'s 
reinsertion program for former members of an illegal armed 
group.  All had light sentences and would have been released 
in a short period of time even without the pardon. 
 
2. (U) The GOC promised the safety of the pardoned guerrillas 
and their families from FARC or paramilitary reprisals, and 
said the release was a demonstration of government commitment 
to secure the release of hostages.  Peace Commissioner Luis 
Carlos Restrepo said efforts would continue to hold a 
humanitarian exchange with FARC and President Uribe 
underscored that the release was not a surrender to FARC 
demands.  Family members of FARC hostages, including Ingrid 
Betancourt\'s mother and the wife of one of the kidnapped 
Valle Department deputies, praised the GOC\'s actions. 
 
3. (C) Restrepo explained to the Ambassador that the GOC was 
responding to heavy pressure from family members of FARC 
hostages to hold a prisoner exchange.  The FARC has rejected 
all GOC offers, including a recent proposal to swap 15 
guerrillas followed by a temporary cease-fire and 
face-to-face meeting in Bogota (reftel).  We understand that 
another 12 ex-FARC members will be released as soon as the 
documents are prepared. 
 
4. (C) Comment: Although we are dubious that this initiative 
will prompt any FARC action, it has some interesting aspects: 
(1) It is very close to the outcome desired for the 
paramilitary process: release and reinsertion of illegal 
armed group members after identification, investigation, and 
verification that they have not committed violent crimes that 
would demand incarceration; (2) It has received a positive 
reaction inside and outside Colombia, putting the ball 
squarely in the FARC\'s court; and (3) It has reduced pressure 
for concessions on cases like Simon Trinidad and other high 
profile FARC members held by the government.

3. (C) Summary: A/S Taylor congratulated Minister of Defense 
(MOD) Jorge Uribe on the significant improvements since his 
last visit in 2002 as A/S for Counterterrorism Affairs. 
Noting the reductions in the numbers of kidnappings, 
homicides, and oil pipeline attacks, Uribe vowed to \"stay the 
course.\"  He added that Colombia had begun to offer other 
nations consultation assistance on combating terrorist 
attacks on oil pipelines, securing ports, and conducting 
counternarcotics operations. End Summary. 
 
Bilateral Assistance Reinforces Security Efforts 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4. (C) Taylor praised Uribe on the success of the GOC\'s 
security programs, especially its anti-kidnapping efforts. 
His trip to the program training site only confirmed to him 
that Colombia had a well-established means of combating 
kidnappers.  He applauded the fact that crime had been on a 
downward trend over the last two years.  Uribe responded by 
stressing that bilateral assistance had been key to providing 
the resources necessary to establish Colombia\'s security 
programs.  He was satisfied that his Administration was on 
the correct path and promised to continue. 
 
5. (C) Taylor noted that his visit to Cartagena had given him 
the opportunity to see the civilian/police cooperation that 
helps protect the city.  He added that President Bush had 
asked for a re-evaluation of the city\'s risk levels after his 
November 22 visit.  In response to Vice Minister Eastman\'s 
question about the future of the anti-kidnapping program, 
Taylor confirmed the USG\'s intention to continue supporting 
it. 
 
CO Shares Expertise with Neighbors 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Uribe stressed that Colombia\'s expertise in addressing 
major security challenges recently had led to Colombia 
advising other countries.  For example, GOC officials had 
advised Haitians and Brazilians on ways to improve port 
security, and he mentioned plans to work with Afghanis on 
planning counternarcotics missions in 2005.  Taylor commented 
that Colombia\'s experience in protecting oil pipelines from 
terrorist attacks would likely be useful in Iraq and Central 
Asia.

Summary 
------- 
 
3. (S) A/S Taylor and Ambassador Wood called on President 
Uribe on November 30.  Uribe expressed gratitude for 
President Bush\'s clear statement of support during his 
November 22 visit to Cartagena.  Taylor congratulated Uribe 
on the GOC\'s successes in improving security throughout the 
country.  Uribe acknowledged his tendency to disregard the 
advice of his protective detail, but noted his 
hands-in-the-crowd approach is essential to maintain public 
confidence in Government institutions.  Taylor thanked Uribe 
for facilitating the strong cooperation of GOC intelligence, 
military and police with the Embassy and effectively 
balancing a strong security policy with improved respect for 
human rights.  Uribe expressed his deep commitment to 
bringing the three U.S. hostages home safely.  Uribe promised 
the GOC would not make any decision on the extradition of 
high-ranking paramilitary leaders without first consulting 
the U.S.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
U.S. Support Plays Key Role 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (C) President Uribe expressed appreciation for U.S. 
support, noting that many of the achievements of his 
administration are the direct result of U.S. assistance.  A/S 
Taylor congratulated Uribe on the GOC\'s success in reducing 
kidnappings and violent crime and stressed the USG\'s 
commitment to continue supporting the GOC.  Uribe expressed 
his personal gratitude for President Bush\'s public statement 
of support during his November 22 visit to Cartagena, which 
sent a clear message to illegal armed groups that there is no 
alternative to committing to a sincere peace process. 
Colombia is at a critical juncture and the success of pending 
large-scale paramilitary demobilizations will play a key 
role.  Uribe stressed his personal commitment to protect 
citizens and enhance the state\'s presence, particularly in 
areas where paramilitary groups demobilize.  Taylor commented 
on the importance of turning demobilized fighters into 
productive citizens. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
VIP Protection and Anti-Kidnapping Training 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (S) Uribe stated that U.S. training and equipping of his 
protection detail -- along with those of Vice-President 
Santos and MOD Uribe -- has been excellent.  Noting Uribe\'s 
hands-in-the-crowd approach to politics, Taylor cautioned 
that passage of re-election legislation increases the odds 
that Uribe will be the target of a terrorist assassination 
attempt.  Uribe acknowledged his tendency to disregard his 
protection detail\'s security protocols is \"not good news\" for 
his staff, but clarified he is not motivated by personal 
vanity, but committed to making a direct connection with the 
people in order to maintain the public\'s confidence in 
Colombia\'s democratic institutions.  Taylor noted the 
importance of striking a balance between security and public 
contact and reminded Uribe that a successful assassination 
attempt would be far more damaging to the public\'s 
confidence. 
6. (C) Taylor congratulated Uribe on the GOC\'s success in 
building on USG training for the GOC\'s anti-kidnapping units 
(GAULAs), pointing to concrete results in reducing the number 
of kidnappings.  He promised continued U.S. support for the 
GOC\'s efforts.  Uribe replied that preventing kidnappings is 
a top GOC priority. 
 
------------------- 
Information Sharing 
------------------- 
7. (C) Taylor noted that cooperation between the Embassy and 
the GOC\'s intelligence, military, and police agencies has 
been nearly flawless.  Information sharing between the 
Embassy and the GOC eliminates second-guessing in Washington 
and helps U.S. policymakers understand the intricacies of the 
situation on the ground.  Uribe said that U.S. and European 
understandings of Colombia\'s unique situation continue to 
improve and noted improvements in relationships with some 
NGOs, particularly Human Rights Watch. 
 
------------------------- 
Security and Human Rights 
------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Uribe confirmed his commitment to build an effective 
and transparent security policy.  Taylor responded that a 
good counterterrorism policy supports a good human rights 
policy.  Taylor congratulated Uribe for successfully 
implementing an effective security policy that has improved 
respect for human rights.  Uribe noted that the number of 
human rights complaints received by the GOC has declined 
steadily and that the public continues to press for increased 
state and military presence to fight illegal armed groups 
throughout the country.  While Uribe acknowledged that many 
problems remain, he reiterated his intent to work hard to 
solve them. 
 
------------- 
U.S. Hostages 
------------- 
 
9. (S) Taylor thanked Uribe for the remarkable level of 
cooperation and transparency in the effort to locate the 
three U.S. hostages and noted that continued cooperation is 
essential to securing their freedom.  Uribe said he was 
deeply committed to bring the three hostages home, as well as 
freeing any Colombian citizens who might be held in the same 
location.  Ambassador noted that communications with the MOD 
and General Ospina could not be better and applauded Uribe\'s 
commitment to include the U.S. hostages in any humanitarian 
exchange. 
 
----------- 
Extradition 
----------- 
 
10. (C) Uribe stressed his commitment to continue 
extraditions to the U.S. and to process extradition requests 
as quickly as possible.  He noted the importance of complete 
coordination and promised the GOC would not make any decision 
on the extraditions of high-level paramilitary leaders 
without first consulting the USG.

CONFERENCE ON GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ-OREJUELA EXTRADITION 
 
REF:  (A) STATE 249758 
 
      (B) BOGOTA 11862 
 
1.  (SBU) Late on December 6, Camilo Ospina, President 
Uribe\'s Legal Advisor, contacted the Ambassador to voice 
the President\'s strong concerns over the press conference 
by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida 
on the extradition of Gilberto Rodriguez-Orejuela to the 
effect that Rodriguez-Orejuela would be tried for acts 
committed during the past 20 years.  (Colombian law 
prohibited extradition of Colombian nationals prior to 
December 17, 1997, so no activities prior to that date can 
be the subject of a U.S. trial under Colombian law.  The 
U.S. has provided assurances - Ref A - that we would abide 
by that condition of extradition.)  Interior and Justice 
Minister Sabas Pretelt de la Vega also contacted Judatt to 
protest the USA\'s comments, suggesting that the ability of 
the GOC to extradite Miguel Gilberto Rodriguez-Orejuela 
could be compromised.  Ambassador also spoke by phone with 
traveling FM Carolina Barco. 
 
2.  (SBU) On December 7, Ambassador was called to the MFA 
by Acting FM Jaime Giron and given a copy of a diplomatic 
note protesting the Florida statement and asking for 
rectification (text - para 4).  He noted that President 
Uribe wanted a public rectification very quickly because 
extradition was under heavy pressure in Colombia. 
Ambassador provided Giron with the just-arrived text of 
the Florida DOJ press release clarifying earlier 
statements during the meeting.  Giron expressed his 
satisfaction with the statement. 
 
3.  (SBU) Comment:  The GOC expressed serious concern 
about negative public reaction to the USA\'s comments and 
the potential arguments they might give to defense 
attorneys defending clients from extradition (notably 
Miguel Rodriguez-Orejuela, Simon Trinidad, and alias 
Sonia).  End Comment. 
 
4.  (U) Begin informal translation of GOC dipnote: 
 
Mr. Secretary: 
 
I want to express to Your Excellency the surprise and deep 
concern with which the Colombian Government learned of the 
press release of Federal Prosecutor Marcos Daniel Jimenez, 
after the appearance of Gilberto Rodrguez Orejuela before 
the Federal Court for the Southern District of Florida, 
according to which Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela would be 
prosecuted in Miami for charges previous to 1997, 
contravening the conditions established by the Colombian 
Government when it authorized his extradition to the 
United States of America. 
 
For the Government of Colombia, it is important to protect 
the extradition process as an effective bilateral 
mechanism to combat organized transnational delinquency 
and, in this context, the scourge of drug trafficking. 
For this reason we want to draw attention to the 
commitment undertaken by the Petitioner State to conform 
to the conditions under which the Government of Colombia 
granted the extradition.  This aspect deserves special 
treatment by United States\' authorities in order to 
guarantee the strictest compliance. 
 
The Government of Colombia granted the extradition based 
on the understanding that the requested person would be 
neither judged for any act previous to that which 
motivated the extradition, nor subject to sanctions 
different from those imposed in the sentence.  In 
addition, if according to the laws of the Petitioner 
State, the crime that motivated the extradition carries 
the death penalty, the extradition would only take place 
with the condition of commutation of the penalty, and 
equally, also as a condition, that the person extradited 
would not be subject to forced disappearance, torture or 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or 
exile, life imprisonment and confiscation. 
 
The above is based on the current Colombian criminal 
justice system (Article 512 of the Colombian Criminal 
Procedure Code) and on Ruling C-1106 of August of 2000 of 
the Colombian Constitutional Court, according to 
requirements of Articles 11, 12, and 34 of the 
Constitution. 
 
I would be very grateful if Your Excellency would transmit 
to your Government the distress generated in Colombia by 
Prosecutor Marcos Daniel Jimenez\'s declarations, as well 
as the importance of adopting the necessary measures to 
guarantee the fulfillment of the conditions under which 
the extradition was granted and that the United States of 
America accepted in its Diplomatic Note 2970 of December 
3, 2004. 
 
I avail my self of this opportunity to renew to Your 
Excellency the assurances of my highest and most 
distinguished consideration.

base camps and destroyed three HCL labs and five base labs. 
 
5. (SBU) DIRAN\'s Jungla (Airmobile Special Forces) 
instructors trained three Carabinero (Rural Mobile Police) 
squadrons in airmobile and antinarcotics operations.  These 
Carabinero squadrons will be attached to DIRAN to support 
aerial eradication operations.  United States Army Special 
Forces conducted a three-week sniper course for 16 students 
from DIRAN\'s Jungla companies.  These sniper teams are 
equipped with INL-funded M24 Sniper Systems to support 
antinarcotics and antiterrorist operations. 
 
6. (SBU) During November, the CNP destroyed 20 Cocaine HCL 
labs and 71 Cocaine Base labs.  The CNP also captured over

Department, Tame, in Arauca Department, San Jose del 
Guaviare, in Guaviare Department, and Neiva, in Huila 
Department, as well as conducted training operations in 
Tolemaida.  Plan Colombia helicopters flew over 2,240 hours 
during November.  This included 1,240 sorties that 
transported 3,318 passengers and 125,041 pounds of cargo. 
Eleven flight hours were dedicated to evacuating 15 medical 
patients. 
 
9. (SBU) During November, Plan Colombia Helicopters were 
also involved in training operations.  UH-60 Training Group 
VIII completed training on 5 November, while Group IX began 
training this month with 10 pilots.  In the current IERW

sustaining injuries. 
 
11. (SBU) On November 26 and 27, elements of the CD Brigade 
captured two FARC cocaine HCL labs near Miraflores, in 
Guaviare Department.  The first lab had two chemical 
recycling vats and 30 microwaves.  The lab had an estimated 
peak capacity of 10 metric tons of cocaine HCL per month. 
The second lab had chemicals and equipment for processing 
and packaging cocaine HCL. 
 
LAW ENFORCEMTNT/ PUBLIC SECURITY 
-------------------------------- 
 
12. (SBU) Interdiction: Base defense and road interdiction 
assessments were conducted in Cucuta, in Norte de Santander 
Department, Santa Marta, in Magdalena Department, and 
Mariquita, in Tolima Department.  Base Defense enhancement 
projects are planned for these locations during FY05. 
 
13. (SBU) Road interdiction operations and re-training 
continued in Cucuta and Santa Marta.  On November 30, DIRAN 
police officers from Villavicencio seized 211 kilos of coca 
base at an interdiction checkpoint near Granada, Meta 
Department.  The coca base was being transported in the roof 
of a bus traveling from San Jose del Guaviare on roads that 
by-passed military checkpoints. 
 
14. (SBU) The 2005 Base Defense and Road Interdiction 
Training Plan was approved for implementation.  The plan 
includes base defense maintenance and upgrades as well as 
road interdiction equipment training. 
 
15. (SBU) Carabineros: During November the Narino Squadron 
supported manual eradication in Llorente, in Narino 
Department.  Carabinero squadrons continue to provide 
security to the major lines of communications in Colombia, 
support manual eradication efforts, and provide security in 
the conflicted zones. 
 
16. (SBU) In October, Carabinero Squadrons captured 35 
narcotraffickers and 68 guerrillas.  They seized 201 
weapons, 150 kgs of coca base, and 10.8 kgs of marijuana. In 
Narino Department, five Carabineros were wounded in a 
firefight with the FARC. 
 
PORT SECURITY AND THE CULTURE OF LAWFULNESS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
17. (SBU) Port Security: NAS and ICE will fund and contract 
for training of a polygraph unit for DIRAN\'s port security 
unit.  NAS visited seaports in Buenaventura and Santa Marta 
to assess interdiction efforts by the ports and DIRAN. 
DIRAN started constructing dog kennels in Santa Marta to 
enhance their canine interdiction efforts along the northern 
coast. 
 
18. (SBU) Culture of Lawfulness: NAS delivered previously 
donated equipment to Surgir, a drug prevention NGO in 
Medelln.  This equipment supports both demand reduction and 
assisted in developing a culture of lawfulness by enhancing

1. (U) On December 3, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC) released a communique dated November 28, 
changing one of its long-standing requirements for a 
humanitarian exchange.  The communique appears to pre-date 
the GOC\'s December 2 release of 23 (with 12 more expected) 
FARC members guilty of membership in an illegal armed group 
-- in most cases the crime of rebellion.  Claiming to cite 
GOC arguments that clearing the municipalities of San Vicente 
del Caguan and Cartagena del Chaira in Caqueta Department for 
a prisoner exchange would weaken the \"Patriot Plan,\" the 
communique proposes that Florida and Pradera municipalities 
in Valle de Cauca Department be used instead.  President 
Uribe responded on December 7 that the GOC would not accept 
any kind of clearing as a condition for exchange and 
suggested the FARC propose different measures. 
 
2. (U) The FARC\'s message added another new condition to any 
exchange agreement; that more than 500 FARC members currently 
imprisoned by the GOC be released.  It also declares that the 
Catholic Church should direct contact with the UN, \"friendly\" 
governments and the Red Cross to support an exchange.  The 
FARC dub the extradition of FARC leader Simon Trinidad as a 
\"crude stunt,\" and warn that such extraditions to the United 
States could interfere with a future exchange. 
 
3. (C) This latest communique may have been a preemptive 
strike by the FARC to show its \"flexibility\" before the GOC 
began releasing the ex-FARC members.  The FARC has not 
responded in any other way to the December 2 release and 
remains unlikely to reciprocate. 
 
FARC Makes Lateral Step 
----------------------- 
 
4. (U) Begin text of informal translation of FARC communique: 
 
The government argues that clearing the municipalities of San 
Vicente and Cartagena del Chaira to conduct a prisoner swap 
is impossible because it would be tantamount to ending or 
suspending the \"Patriot Plan.\"  Therefore, so that the plan 
can continue its normal course, we propose: 
 
-- To demilitarize two municipalities of the hundreds outside 
the Eastern and Southern bloc areas, where the government has 
deluded itself into believing that it can defeat the 
guerrillas with the plan designed and directed by the 
Southern Command of the U.S. Army. 
 
-- The two municipalities that we propose are Florida and 
Pradera in Valle.  They must provide the necessary security 
guarantees for the movement of our spokespeople, the transfer 
of the two sides\' prisoners to the place agreed upon for the 
exchange, and the subsequent pullback of the more than 500 
guerrillas who must be released under the accords. 
 
-- The Catholic Church, which will be in charge of the 
initial contacts, will look into the possibilities of ties 
with the United Nations, friendly governments, and the 
International Red Cross in related and logistical support 
tasks. 
 
-- We invite the relatives of Colombian and U.S. prisoners to 
embrace this proposal and make it successful, as everyone 
hopes it will be. 
 
-- Our political resolve to end the lengthy imprisonment of 
the individuals held by both sides is clearly corroborated by 
this proposal. We hope that Mr. Uribe\'s government is up to 
the challenges of this humanitarian accord, which has been 
awaiting implementation for some time. 
 
-- The Supreme Court has manifestly demonstrated its 
servility and lack of propriety by authorizing the 
extradition of Simon Trinidad, the FARC peace spokesman, to 
the United States.  This crude stunt also attacks the 
unquestionably political nature of our struggle.  Our 
response is that this could seriously interfere with the 
possibility of a prisoner exchange.  On principle we oppose 
the extradition of Colombians, an unworthy practice that 
renounces sovereignty and that cannot continue amid 
indifference. No civilized country in the world is handing 
over its citizens to be prosecuted by the Gringos.

1. (C) The GOC continues to demobilize elements of the United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).  As of December 8, 510 
out of about 1,500 paramilitaries from the Catatumbo Bloc had 
registered in their demobilization zone in Norte de Santander 
Department.  They are scheduled to publicly demobilize on 
December 10.  On December 9, 147 paramilitaries in northern 
Cundinamarca Department demobilized, and on December 4, 47 
paramilitaries in southern Magdalena Department demobilized. 
If GOC plans to demobilize 700 members of the AUC\'s Northern 
Bloc in Cordoba Department succeed by the end of the year, 
the Government will have almost reached its goal of 
demobilizing 3,000 paramilitary fighters in 2004.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Catatumbo Bloc: Demobilization Almost Complete 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (C) As of December 8, 510 out of nearly 1,500 members of 
the AUC\'s Catatumbo Bloc -- including AUC Commander Salvatore 
Mancuso -- had registered in their demobilization zone in 
Norte de Santander Department, received provisional 
identification cards, and completed a survey on demographic 
information and employment plans.  Mancuso and other 
paramilitaries facing criminal charges for serious crimes 
will remain in a concentration area, probably the principal 
zone surrounding the village of Santa Fe de Ralito, Cordoba 
Department.  Rank and file members accused only of membership 
in an illegal armed group will begin departing the Norte de 
Santander demobilization zone after a public demobilization 
ceremony currently scheduled for December 10.  Following 
their demobilization, former AUC fighters must report to a 
reinsertion center in the nearby town of Tibu to register for 
reinsertion benefits.  Contacts at the GOC\'s Office of the 
High Commissioner for Peace Office estimate bloc members will 
turn in approximately 900 weapons. 
 
3. (C) On November 29, the GOC issued a resolution creating a 
demobilization zone on the \"Brisas del Sardinata\" estate, 
located in the rural district of Campo Dos, in Tibu 
municipality.  Paramilitaries present within the zone cannot 
be arrested before December 30.  Police and military are 
responsible for security around the zone and in areas 
formerly dominated by the demobilizing AUC forces.  The Army 
transferred a counterguerrilla battalion from Arauca 
Department to Tibu to assist with security. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Cundinamarca Self-Defense Forces: Demobilization Complete 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
4. (U) One December 9, 147 paramilitaries from the 
Self-Defense Forces of Cundinamarca demobilized in a public 
ceremony at an agricultural institute in the rural district 
of Teran, Yacopi municipality, Cundinamarca Department, 
approximately 60 miles north of Bogota.  The demobilization 
zone will last until December 30.  On November 29, the GOC 
issued a resolution suspending arrest warrants nationwide 
against the group\'s commander, Luis Eduardo Cifuentes, aka 
\"El Aguila,\" until December 30, so he could leave the 
concentration zone at Santa Fe de Ralito and manage the 
demobilization.  Group members turned in 137 weapons (mostly 
rifles and handguns), several dozen radios, and some 
explosives.  The police and military have a relatively strong 
presence in the region where the group operated in northern 
Cundinamarca, and the Peace Commissioner\'s Office has told us 
the possibility of a guerrilla resurgence in the aftermath of 
the paramilitary demobilization is not a serious concern. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Southern Magdalena Paramilitaries: Small-Scale and Simple 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
5. (C) On December 4, 47 paramilitaries demobilized in the 
rural district of Santa Rosa, Santa Ana municipality, 
southern Magdalena Department.  The GOC passed a resolution 
lifting arrest warrants nationwide against the group\'s 
commander, Jose Maria Barrera, aka \"Chepe Barrera,\" until 
December 30.  The group was only loosely affiliated with the 
AUC, and its small size and secure area of operations made 
the demobilization relatively simple and straightforward. 
----------------------------- 
Only Cordoba Remains for 2004 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The demobilizations of these three groups and the 
Bananero Bloc on November 25 (reftel) brings the total number 
of paramilitaries demobilized in 2004 to approximately 2,050. 
 About 700 paramilitaries from the AUC\'s Northern Bloc in 
Cordoba Department are scheduled to demobilize by the end of 
December, but protests from local cattle ranchers have 
complicated the effort.  If the 700 demobilize before the end 
of the year, the GOC will have almost reached its goal of 
demobilizing 3,000 paramilitary fighters in 2004.

SUBJECT: UN MAY CONSIDER DDR PROGRAM FOR COLOMBIA; 
HUMANITARIAN ACTION PLAN IN TROUBLE 
 
REF: BOGOTA 11339 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Begin Summary:  UN Special Advisor on Colombia James 
LeMoyne, visiting Bogota this week, told major donors on 
December 8 that the UN was considering a demobilization, 
disarmament and reintergration (DDR) program for Colombia, 
assuming certain conditions were met.  UNDP is also exploring 
the possibility of a major conference on DDR to highlight the 
issue in Colombia.  Per reftel, LeMoyne expressed continuing 
concern about the \"deteriorating\" GOC-UN relationship in all 
three areas of engagement -- human rights, good offices, and 
humanitarian assistance.  He said that UN officials in New 
York \"were stunned\" that a presumed agreement on a 
humanitarian action plan had recently unraveled, and appealed 
to donors to help the UN and GOC fix it.  He believes that 
GOC officials are convinced that the document in its current 
form would have been used as another vehicle to criticize 
Colombia.  Worse, he believes conceptual and ideological 
differences have emerged between the GOC and UN over how the 
conflict is seen.  LeMoyne noted that the UN-GOC, high level 
working group would finally meet in New York the week of 
January 17 and hoped these issues would be addressed.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) On December 8, Swedish charge arranged a meeting with 
major donors for visiting UN special advisor on Colombia 
James LeMoyne.  Along with the UNDP Resident Representative, 
Ambassadors from Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and 
the UK were present.  Polcouns represented the U.S.  LeMoyne 
will remain in Bogota until December 10, and has meetings 
planned with FM Barco, Peace Commissioner Restrepo, Senator 
Pardo, the Papal Nuncio, and various other embassies.  Issues 
covered included UN discussions about a demobilization, 
disarmament and reintegration (DDR) program, delays in the 
launch of the humanitarian action plan (HAP), and the GOC-UN 
relationship. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
DEMOBILIZATION, DISARMAMENT AND REINTEGRATION (DDR) 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3. (C) LeMoyne said that preliminary discussions were 
underway at UN Headquarters about committing to a DDR program 
in Colombia.  The focus was reinsertion.  While the GOC was 
offering as much as it could, it would not be enough, 
resulting, he said, in the return of ex-fighters into 
guerrilla or criminal groups.  According to LeMoyne, senior 
UN officials including the SYG, U/SYG Prendergast and Chef de 
Cabinet Riza, were signaling a \"qualified maybe\" and had 
solicited possible parameters and conditions for such a 
program.  While acknowledging that the UN had been too 
extreme in the past on the conditions it demanded of the GOC, 
LeMoyne said the UN would probably insist on at least three: 
(1) an official GOC request; (2) the creation of a separate 
GOC agency to manage DDR; and (3) passage of the \"Law for 
Justice and Reparations.\"  He stressed that these were still 
at the discussion stage, and while he awaited a political 
green light from the 38th floor, he did have instructions to 
consult with major donors on the issue.  The group\'s reponse 
to the conditions was unenthusiastic (except for Switzerland) 
and LeMoyne was asked to investigate whether the UN had 
imposed similar conditions on other governments which hosted 
a UN DDR program. 
 
4. (C) UNDP Resident Representative Alfredo Witschi said 
that, in light of the discussions in New York, local agency 
reps were reviewing how the UN system could become involved 
in DDR.  He recommended that the issue be discussed in 
Cartagena in February to ensure a strong signal of support 
from the international community.  One idea being considered 
was an international conference on DDR, led by Iqbal Riza, 
featuring countries which had \"come out the other end\" of a 
DDR process.  Witschi also noted that the humanitarian action 
plan still under discussion (see para 7) with the GOC did not 
include a DDR component, but UN agencies were preparing 
themselves should a consensus emerge to add one.  Swedish 
charge Ingemar Cederberg announced that the GOS had 
identified an additional USD 300,000 as a potential 
contribution to UNDP, a substantial portion of which would 
likely be earmarked for DDR activities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
UN-GOC RELATIONS DETERIORATE FURTHER: GOC BALKS AT 
HUMANITARIAN ACTION PLAN 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5. (C) LeMoyne underscored that discussions on a DDR program 
could be affected by the increasingly strained relations 
between the GOC and the UN.  He reviewed the state of play, 
mostly repeating what he shared with the Ambassador on 
October 30, reported reftel.  He said that, in addition to 
the ongoing problems with the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights and with the good offices role (i.e. his own 
operation), the GOC was now balking at the latest version of 
the humanitarian action plan. 
 
6. (C) LeMoyne hypothesized that GOC officials, including the 
President, Vice President, Foreign Minister, UN permrep, and 
Peace Commissioner, have concluded that the GOC erred in 
permitting a large UN presence in the country, and that the 
UN has taken unfair advantage.  These same officials believed 
that there remains a conceptual and ideological difference 
between the way they and the UN see the conflict.  According 
to LeMoyne, the GOC views it as terrorism, \"in the Chechnya 
model,\" not an internal conflict as the UN labels it. 
Furthermore, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights in Bogota has become the enemy, neither transparent 
nor effective, and the GOC was now prepared to \"take it on.\" 
 
7. (C) According to LeMoyne, the apparent failure of UN 
humanitarian agencies and the GOC to reach final agreement on 
a humanitarian action plan \"stunned us in New York.\"  He 
surmised that the GOC, in particular its permrep in New York, 
concluded that the current version was drafted like a new 
human rights instrument that would be used to judge the GOC, 
and ultimately block support.  He appealed to the government 
reps present to help the GOC and UN fix it. 
 
8. (C) With respect to the good offices role, LeMoyne again 
reported that UN Secretariat officials remained inclined to 
suspend the good offices operation or reduce it 
significantly.  He also hinted that this would lead to his 
departure. 
 
9. (C) LeMoyne reported that the GOC-UN, high level working 
group, led by FM Barco on the Colombian side and U/SYG 
Prendergast on the UN side, would finally meet the week of 
January 17 in New York.  Given the ongoing difficulties with 
the relationship, LeMoyne had been ordered back to New York 
on Monday by Prendergast for two days of meetings, scrapping 
a scheduled visit to Brussels.  A note for the SYG on the 
state of play will be prepared before Christmas in 
preparation for the January meeting. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10.(C) Following the meeting, UK Ambassador Thomas Duggin 
suggested that LeMoyne was \"in overdrive crisis mode,\" 
exaggerating the problem between the GOC and the UN.  That 
said, GOC confidence in the UN has deteriorated to the point 
that any UN initiative, including one as potentially useful 
as a humanitarian action plan, is suspect.  This is something 
we should work to reverse in New York, Geneva and Bogota. 
UNDP\'s Witschi admitted to considerable dissension within the 
UN country team over the \"pro-consul attitude\" of OHCHR 
director Michael Fruhling.  According to Witschi, Fruhling 
was fuming that UNDP/Bogota recommended HCHR Louise Arbour 
attend the GOC-UN high level meeting the week of January 17 
instead of Fruhling.  Witschi believes that a high level GOC 
intervention with the HCHR is the only way to rein in 
Fruhling, and remains puzzled as to why it has not happened 
yet.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Over 1400 members of the AUC\'s Catatumbo Bloc -- 
including AUC military commander Salvatore Mancuso -- 
demobilized in a public ceremony in Norte de Santander 
Department on December 10.  The Bloc surrendered over 1500 
quality weapons, as well as over 150 pieces of real estate in 
the region.  In his address, Mancuso asked for forgiveness 
from the Colombian people, foreign nations -- particularly 
the U.S. -- and \"every mother whose pain (he) had caused or 
permitted.\"  Most of the demobilizing fighters were young men 
from the departments of Norte de Santander, Cordoba, or 
Antioquia, and the GOC will set up reinsertion centers for 
the demobilized fighters in these three departments. 
Residents of the Catatumbo region -- and demobilized 
Catatumbo Bloc fighters -- have reasonable concerns about a 
FARC resurgence in the region, and the GOC has responded by 
permanently transferring an entire counterguerrilla battalion 
from Arauca to Catatumbo.  Peace Commissioner Restrepo has 
asked the Embassy to support GOC efforts to secure the region 
by conducting an aggressive aerial eradication campaign 
northwest of the Catatumbo River and providing the COLMIL 
presence in the zone with riverine patrol boats and military 
helicopters.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Demobilization: Guns and Grenades, Homes and Haciendas 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2. (SBU) On December 10, in what GOC High Commissioner for 
Peace Luis Carlos Restrepo characterized as the largest 
demobilization in Colombian history, 1,423 members of the 
United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia\'s (AUC) Catatumbo Bloc 
-- including AUC military commander Salvatore Mancuso -- 
demobilized in a formal ceremony in a rural zone of Tibu 
municipality, Norte de Santander Department.  The 
paramilitary fighters, divided into field troops dressed in 
fatigues and urban operatives in specially ordered 
tee-shirts, turned in over 1500 weapons that OAS Verification 
Mission inspectors confirmed were in excellent condition. 
According to official OAS figures, the GOC collected over 950 
AK-47 (some with Colombian military (COLMIL) markings), 50 
side arms, 600 grenades, 20 mortars, and 10 RPGs.  The 
weapons were transported that evening via armed convoy to the 
departmental capital of Cucuta, where they will be stored 
until the GOC passes a regulation authorizing their 
destruction. 
 
3. (SBU) The Catatumbo Bloc provided the GOC with a list of 
local assets it was surrendering as part of the 
demobilization, including 105 rural properties, 58 urban 
homes and businesses, 10 boats, and 45 mules.  The Bloc also 
turned over several vehicles and 15 dogs trained to detect 
explosives.  According to Restrepo, the GOC will attempt to 
return illegally seized real estate to its rightful owners, 
although many properties originally seized from Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) or National Liberation Army 
(ELN) sympathizers are likely to go unclaimed.  Funds from 
the sale of unclaimed buildings and lands will be invested in 
a compensation fund for victims of paramilitary violence. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
The Guests: A High-Powered Crowd in a Neglected Region 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
4. (SBU) Restrepo presided over the demobilization ceremony, 
where he was joined at the head table by Mancuso, Monsignor 
Jorge Vidal, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Monteria, Cordoba 
Department, Sergio Caramanga, director of the OAS 
Verification Mission in Colombia, Ivan Roberto Duque, aka 
\"Ernesto Baez,\" the rhetorically-gifted commander of the 
paramilitary Central Bolivar Bloc (BCB), the governor of 
Norte de Santander, and the mayors of Cucuta and Tibu.  Also 
present at the event were members of congress sympathetic to 
the AUC, including representatives Eleonora Pineda and Rocio 
Arias and Senator Carlos Moreno. 
 
------------------ 
Belated Repentance 
------------------ 
 
5. (U) Under a withering tropical sun, Mancuso addressed 
paramilitary troops assembled on a muddy field that passed 
for an improvised parade ground.  In a speech punctuated more 
than once with what appeared to be heartfelt emotion, he 
asked for \"the forgiveness of the people of Colombia.  \"I 
ask,\" he said, \"for the forgiveness of the nations of the 
world, among them the United States of America, if by action 
or omission I have offended them.  I beg for the forgiveness 
of every mother whose pain we have caused or permitted.  I 
assume my responsibility for the leadership I have exercised, 
for what I could have done better, and for what I could have 
done and did not do.\"  Catatumbo Bloc commander alias 
\"Camilo,\" a former Colombian Army captain, also asked for 
forgiveness for his errors, particularly his decision to 
desert and join the AUC. 
 
--------------------- 
Profile of the Troops 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) \"Camilo\" was not the only ex-member of the Colombian 
military among the demobilizing troops.  An Embassy official 
present at the event spoke to a young fighter who admitted to 
deserting the Army and joining the AUC after he was accused 
of killing civilians in southern Bolivar department.  Nearly 
all the former fighters -- only about 30 of whom were women 
-- appeared to be in their late teens to mid twenties. 
According to a survey of the demobilizing fighters conducted 
on site by the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM), less than a third were from Norte de Santander 
Department.  Nearly a third were from Cordoba, birthplace of 
the AUC, and almost 20 percent from the department of 
Antioquia, most from its lowland Uraba region.  As a result 
of the survey, the GOC will establish reinsertion centers for 
former Catatumbo Bloc members in Cucuta, Monteria, and Turbo, 
in Uraba, where the AUC\'s Bananero Bloc demobilized on 
November 25 (reftel). 
 
7. (U) Although most members of the Catatumbo Bloc were from 
outside the region, hundreds of family members of local 
recruits were present at the event.  As demobilized fighters 
wandered among the spectators after laying down their 
weapons, mothers slogged through the mud to embrace their 
prodigal sons, most of whom will have to depart the region 
out of fear of FARC reprisals. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Security Concerns and Pleas for Assistance 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8. (SBU) Concerns about a guerrilla -- and particularly a 
FARC -- resurgence in the coca-rich Catatumbo region was 
palpable among both local residents and former fighters. 
Residents of many Catatumbo communities have noted an 
increase in FARC presence since the demobilization was 
announced, some claim the FARC has summoned \"cocalero\" 
community leaders to discuss the new organization of the drug 
trade, and the current managers of most formerly AUC-owned 
businesses have fled the region.  According to local OAS 
officials, the most common concern they heard in their 
mandatory interviews with demobilizing fighters was that the 
FARC would take advantage of their absence to retake former 
paramilitary zones in Catatumbo, negating the sacrifices they 
made to secure the region. 
 
9. (C) To address residents\' legitimate security concerns, 
the Army\'s Second Division has transferred -- permanently -- 
an entire counterguerrilla battalion from Arauca Department 
to Catatumbo.  Restrepo told the Embassy that the USG could 
support GOC efforts to consolidate Government control of the 
region by conducting an aggressive aerial eradication 
campaign northwest of the Catatumbo River, where most of 
Catatumbo\'s coca is grown.  He emphasized that this campaign 
should include the nearly 2000 acres of coca controlled by 
the FARC in Bari National Park, in northern Norte de 
Santander along the border with Venezuela.  (Note: The GOC 
has so far not permitted spraying in national parks, so 
Restrepo\'s request is probably merely personal.)  Restrepo 
also asked for USG assistance in providing the COLMIL with 
patrol boats to use on the navigable Catatumbo River, which 
was previously controlled by the AUC, as well as two military 
helicopters.  According to Restrepo, the COLMIL currently has 
no air assets in the Catatumbo region.

SUBJECT: PLAN COLOMBIA IMPLEMENTATION ROUND-UP, DECEMBER, 
2004 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) The following is an update of Plan Colombia-related 
activities reported during December, 2004. 
 
---------- 
DOJ/ICITAP 
---------- 
 
2. (U) On December 21, 2004, twenty-one judicial police 
investigators and forensic experts graduated from the 
240-hour Forensic Linguistic Course taken at the Colombian 
Institute \"Caro y Cuervo\".  Forensic Linguistics is vital in 
investigations of kidnappings, extortion, and 
terrorist-related crimes, where voice samples from cassette 
tapes or recorded telephone calls are obtained as evidence 
for introduction at trial. 
 
-------- 
DOJ/JSRP 
-------- 
 
3. (U) During the month of December, the Justice Sector 
Reform Program (JSRP) intensified its assistance to the GOC 
in preparation for the implementation of the new Criminal 
Procedure Code.  This Code will come into effect in Armenia, 
Bogota, Manizales, and Pereira on January 1, 2005. 
 
4. (U) DOJ provided training in the new Code to: 360 police 
investigators in 6 different cities through its two-week 
\"Investigator as a Witness\" course; 120 prosecutors in Bogota 
through its two-week criminal trial advocacy course; and 120 
judges in three courses with respect to the implementation of 
the new Code.  In CY 2004, DOJ trained a total of: over 5,000 
police investigators, over 500 prosecutors, and over 300 
judges.  DOJ has also assisted both the Prosecutor General\'s 
Office (Fiscalia) and the Police with establishing monitoring 
groups to mentor and assist with the implementation of the 
new Code, as well as to report on the progress of the 
implementation. 
 
-------- 
MILGROUP 
-------- 
 
5. (S) The new Joint Task Force Omega Commander, Major 
General Carlos Alberto Fracica Naranja, has been quick to 
take the reins and imprint his leadership style on the task 
force.  MG Fracica is much more reliant on, and demanding of, 
his staff than was MG Reinaldo Castellanos Trujillo, and was 
quick to bring in his field commanders to define his 
strategy, set priorities, and outline his vision.  (Note: MG 
Castillanos was in command ten months before he brought his 
subordinate commanders to meet at a single location. End 
note.)  Indications are that MG Fracica will be aggressive 
and results oriented.  MG Fracica has emphasized mobility 
(both air and ground), small unit operations, fire support 
and psychological operations as being key to defeating the 
FARC in the Plan Patriota 2, Part B area of operations. 
 
6. (U) SOUTHCOM J3, MILGP and COLMIL Joint Staff conducted 
the culminating exercise for the six-month Joint Operations 
and Intelligence Center project during the week of December 
5. The exercise and associated training greatly improved 
COLMIL staff procedures and functions, information flow, and 
integration of intelligence.  It also identified systematic 
problems/improvement areas. USMILGP/SCJ3 anticipates follow 
on exercises to further enhance participating nation 
capability after the installation of the 
communications/intelligence hardware and software packages 
supporting Plan Patriota 2, Part B. 
 
--- 
NAS 
--- 
 
7. (U) December 18, the Colombian National Police received an 
additional DC-3 aircraft.  This is the first of three such 
aircraft that will complement the CNP\'s anti-narcotics 
programs.  These aircraft -- vintage 1940s -- are totally 
rebuilt, equipped with turboprop engines, and are well-suited 
for operation at locations with unimproved airstrips. 
8. (U) NAS personnel participated in DOD\'s annual Plan 
Colombia Helicopter Program Interim Review.  Among the topics 
discussed was the refinement of objectives and milestones for 
helicopter nationalization. 
 
--- 
RSO 
--- 
 
9. (U) Anti-Kidnapping Initiative: The next six-week crisis 
response training (CRT) for GOC anti-kidnapping officers 
(Grupo de Accion Unificada para la Libertad Personal, or 
GAULA) will begin on January 24, 2005.  DS/ATA is still 
searching for a full-time program manager.  A temporary 
program manager is in place and doing an outstanding job. 
RSO will propose to DS/ATA that the temporary manager be 
given the position on a trial basis for six months, or the 
equivalent of two CRT courses. 
 
10. (U) VIP Personal Protection Training Program: Twenty new 
members of the President\'s protective security detail 
graduated on December 17th.  Training will begin again in 
early January. 
 
----- 
USAID 
----- 
 
11. (U) President Uribe visited the Agro-Industrial Center in 
Villagarzon (Putumayo) to publicly recognize USG economic, 
social and humanitarian assistance to Putumayo and Colombia. 
Since 2001, the USG has allocated a total of US $458 million 
to implement democracy, alternative development and 
humanitarian assistance programs nationwide.  In Putumayo, US 
$57.4 million has been invested to transform the department\'s 
socio-economic landscape.  USAID program activities there 
have supported the improvement of 130 kilometers (80 miles) 
of roads, built and equipped 37 schools, and promoted 
livestock and poultry production.  In addition, the 
cultivation of nearly 30,000 hectares of licit crops such as 
cassava, plantains, rubber, black pepper, and heart of palm 
has provided socioeconomic benefits to roughly 20,000 
families.  The department\'s illicit coca-based economy has 
been dramatically reduced from 66,000 hectares in 2000 to 
less than 10,000 hectares in 2003. 
 
12. (U) On December 17, President Uribe and the DCM launched 
the new joint USAID/GOC rubber projects in El Bagre 
(Antioquia).  The projects are part of an agro-industrial 
development program being implemented in alliance with the 
private sector.  USAID\'s contribution of nearly US $1.8 
million to the total US $6.4 million cost of this project 
leveraged 72.6 percent in complementary funding from the 
private sector.  The projects will benefit 343 families 
through the cultivation of 1,372 hectares in six 
municipalities in northern Antioquia and one in Cordoba. 
With these projects, USAID is providing alternative and 
sustainable economic growth opportunities to rural 
populations that are vulnerable to illicit crop production. 
 
13. (U) The governors of Caldas, Risaralda, and Quindio 
publicly recognized the USAID \"Economic Assistance Program\" 
serving Colombia\'s large internally displaced persons 
population.  The program generates new employment and 
promotes sustainable economic growth through activities such 
as technical training, job placement and support to 
micro-enterprises.  To date, the program has benefited 
roughly 3,000 families in the region and more than 9,000 
nationwide.  In addition, the initiative has received nearly 
US $700,000 in matching contributions from more than 35 
organizations in the region and over US $6 million nationwide.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIA: 2004 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: 04 STATE 245841 
 
1. (U) Embassy Bogota\'s contribution to the 2004 Patterns of 
Global Terrorism report follows.  Responses are keyed to 
questions in reftel\'s paragraph 15.  Embassy POC is Poloff 
Dana Brown, (phone) 571-315-2129, unclass email 
browndml@state.gov. 
 
2. (SBU) (A) SUPPORT FOR THE GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST 
TERRORISM:  The Government of Colombia continued to support 
the Global War Against Terrorism through bilateral, 
multilateral, military, and economic activities against three 
domestic terrorist groups -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), and 
the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) -- that have 
been designated by the United States as Foreign Terrorist 
Organizations.  In 2004, Colombia continued to work with 
neighboring countries to combat terrorist expansion, 
investigate terrorist activities outside Colombia, and bring 
terrorists to justice. 
 
(SBU) B) HOST NATION COUNTERTERRORISM ACTIONS: 
 
DIPLOMATIC: Colombia has signed eight of the international 
conventions and protocols relating to terrorism and is party 
to six.  The remaining four are in different stages of the 
Congressional ratification process.  The Colombian Government 
issued a statement condemning the alleged paramilitary plot 
against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in May.  Colombia 
also supported the Venezuelans by releasing prison records 
and criminal information on all individuals arrested. 
 
LAW ENFORCEMENT: The U.S.-Colombia extradition relationship 
continued to be the most successful one we have; Colombia 
extradited 90 fugitives to the United States in 2004.  The 
Colombian Government remained fully cooperative in cases and 
investigations involving Americans; it sought an exchange of 
hostages held by the FARC to release the three U.S. citizens 
kidnapped in February 2003.  In December, Colombia extradited 
Gilberto Rodriguez-Orejuela, who founded the Cali drug cartel 
in the 1970s and at one point was responsible for 80 percent 
of the global cocaine trade.  In late December, the GOC also 
extradited Juvanal Oviedo Ricardo Palmera, \"Simon Trinidad,\" 
the most senior FARC commander ever held by the Colombians, 
to the United States on charges of kidnapping, providing 
material support to terrorists and narcotics trafficking. 
The threat of extradition has been cited as a significant 
concern for leaders of the FARC, ELN, and AUC. 
 
INTELLIGENCE: In 2004, all adult terrorist group deserters 
were debriefed by the military for detailed information on 
their terrorist cell before they entered the 
demobilization/reinsertion program.  Moreover, the 3,000 AUC 
members demobilized in the collective events have given 
useful information about their organizational structure and 
culture during Government processing. 
 
FINANCIAL ASSETS: The Colombian Government fully cooperated 
in blocking terrorist assets.  Throughout 2004, the Colombian 
Financial Information and Analysis Unit (UIAF) assisted the 
U.S. Embassy and the Treasury Department\'s Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (OFAC) in closing suspicious bank accounts. 
In August, the Colombian military, police, and investigative 
units combined efforts to produce an estimate of FARC 
finances.  The GOC planned to continue this research and 
expand it to include the two other main terrorist groups in 
Colombia.  In September, the U.S. Secret Service and the 
Colombian National Police seized 3.6 million counterfeit U.S. 
dollars from the FARC, which had planned to use it for 
weapons and explosives purchases.  The Colombian Government 
also took steps to reorganize and streamline its 
Inter-Institutional Committee Against Subversive Finances. 
 
MILITARY: President Uribe increased military pressure on 
illegal armed groups in 2004, facilitating the military\'s 
nation-wide campaign to retake national territory.  Although 
FARC-dominated southern Colombia was the primary target for 
the inter-service military action, the military also carried 
out actions against the ELN and the AUC throughout the year. 
 
(SBU) C) HOST NATION LAW ENFORCEMENT, INTELLIGENCE/SECURITY 
SERVICE, AND MILITARY ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST AL-QAIDA AND 
OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS; ENACTMENT OF NEW PERTINENT CT LAWS, 
EXECUTIVE ORDERS, OR REGULATORY ACTIONS:  There were no GOC 
actions taken against Al-Qaida in 2004 but the military 
conducted ongoing actions against the FARC, ELN, and AUC as 
outlined in (B), (J) and (Q).  Military and police units 
around the country seized weapons caches, impounded narcotics 
stocks, infiltrated abandoned FARC camps, and rescued kidnap 
victims.  In August, Congress approved a major anti-terrorism 
statute that would have allowed the Government to conduct 
wiretaps, search residences, and detain suspects more easily. 
 In September, however, the Constitutional Court found the 
statute unconstitutional and struck it down before 
implementation.  The Government drafted a \"Law of Justice and 
Reparations,\" which would offer alternative sentences, 
including mandatory prison time and victim reparation, to 
former members of illegal armed groups who committed serious 
crimes prior to demobilizing.  It will be presented to 
Congress in 2005. 
(SBU) D) RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO ACTS OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM DURING 2004:  As detailed in answer B, GOC 
authorities had successful extradition processes with the 
United States and other nations.  Colombia requested the 
Government of Chile to extradite FARC front leader Jairo 
Cuarn Collazos, who was issued a one-year resident visa in 
November.  Colombia also requested the Cuban Government to 
extradite Luis Fernando Gomez Bustamante, a narcotics 
trafficker arrested in Cuba.  There was no impediment to 
extradition for terrorist acts occurring outside Colombia. 
 
(U) E) HOST NATION LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES, SPECIFICALLY 
IN SURVEILLANCE, INTEL COLLECTION, AND INVESTIGATION: 
Colombian law allows wire, oral, and electronic 
communications interception by the security forces and law 
enforcement officials with the permission of a prosecutor. 
 
(SBU) F) HOST GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS OR ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
INVESTIGATIONS, TO REDUCE THE ABILITY OF TERRORISTS TO CROSS 
NATIONAL BORDERS:  The Colombian Government was generally 
willing to assist in investigations of terrorist activity by 
Colombians in bordering nations.  Border controls remained 
weak to non-existent, however, and neighboring countries 
routinely complained that both illegal armed group members 
and displaced persons crossed the borders unhindered.  The 
GOC entity responsible for immigration controls, the 
Administrative Department of Security (DAS) entered into a 
cooperative agreement with Diplomatic Security and Department 
of Homeland Security offices at post to form a vetted 
investigation unit to combat identity document fraud and 
alien smuggling. 
 
(U) G) MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 2004 BY 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL 
AND REGIONAL FORA:  See (A), (B). 
 
(U) H) DEVELOPMENTS IN HOST NATION CT EFFORTS, FOCUSING ON 
ANY NEW ORGANIZATIONS OR PROCESSES CREATED, TO INCLUDE 
EFFORTS TO UPGRADE BORDER AND MARITIME SECURITY:  In early 
December, the Army announced a new Caribbean Joint Command 
center for military operations along the north coast of 
Colombia.  The new command will coordinate Army, Navy and Air 
Force operations along the Caribbean, making the maritime 
border more secure and improving operations against 
terrorists in the area.  Brazil and Colombia signed an aerial 
interdiction agreement similar the US-Colombia Air Bridge 
Denial Program. 
 
(U) I) EFFORTS TO COMBAT EXTREMIST, VIOLENCE-SUPPORTING 
IDEOLOGY, BOTH BY GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL OR RELIGIOUS SOCIETY. 
See (B), (C) and (D). 
 
(SBU) J) IDENTIFY WHERE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS DEPLOYED MILITARY 
OR PARAMILITARY FORCES FOR COMBAT, COUNTER INSURGENCY OR CT 
ACTIVITIES:  The Colombian Armed forces fought the FARC, ELN, 
and paramilitaries throughout Colombia.  The largest 
coordinated campaign in Colombian history, Plan Patriota, 
focused on the FARC in south-central Colombia, but other 
forces and police units were active in every department in 
the country against all illegal armed groups. 
 
(U) K) DESCRIBE MAJOR CHANGES, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN THE 
HOST GOVERNMENT\'S STANCE TOWARDS TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR 
DOMESTIC:  The GOC continued its hard stance against 
terrorists throughout 2004.  Uribe\'s Administration, 
inaugurated in 2002, entered office on a \"get tough with 
terrorists\" platform and has maintained its focus to 
demobilize or defeat Colombia\'s terrorist groups. 
 
(SBU) L) CONSTRAINTS ON CT PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING LACK OF 
CAPACITY OR POLITICAL WILL:  The Government of Colombia 
remained focused on combating thousands of terrorists 
domestically but lacked both the military and financial 
resources to extend the fight to outside terrorist 
organizations.  Colombia made extraordinary progress against 
terrorism in 2004 by processing more than 6,000 deserters of 
illegal armed groups and over 3,000 paramilitaries in a 
collective demobilization program.  However, continued 
success will require significant financial and military 
resources.  The GOC has requested assistance from the 
international community to help support demobilization and 
peace process programs.  Politically, the Colombian public 
became increasingly divided over the controversial issues of 
\"humanitarian exchange\" (a guerrilla-GOC prisoner swap) and 
extradition ) two issues that could influence the GOC\'s 
future negotiations with illegal armed groups. 
 
(SBU) M) HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT (OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL) 
FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS: 
The Uribe Administration maintained ) in both theory and 
practice - its position against terrorism, and continually 
condemned all terrorist actions.  Select members of Congress, 
however, showed sympathies for either the paramilitaries, the 
ELN, or the FARC.  One result was a Congressional invitation 
for AUC leaders to address the plenary session in July and 
imprisoned ELN leader Francisco Galan was released for one 
day to address Congress in June.  Nevertheless, members of 
Congress usually limited any signs of support to unofficial 
actions. 
 
(U) N) PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.  (THE SIX GOVERNMENTS 
DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM 
ARE CUBA, IRAN, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SUDAN, AND SYRIA.) 
None. 
 
(U) O) STATUS OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN HOST COUNTRY, 
INCLUDING EXISTENCE OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, THEIR GOALS 
AND HOW THEY FIT INTO REGIONAL OR GLOBAL EFFORTS:  Terrorist 
groups were once again active throughout the country in 2004. 
Car bombs, kidnapping, political murders, the indiscriminate 
use of landmines and economic sabotage were common 
occurrences. 
 
FARC: The FARC continued to pursue terrorist and 
narcotrafficking activities despite the military campaign 
against them.  Although 2004 was a relatively \"quiet\" year 
for the FARC, the group still executed significant attacks in 
urban areas.  The FARC bombed a popular nightclub in 
Apartado, Antioquia Department killing five and injuring 
almost 100 in May.  In August, a suspected FARC bombing of 
Medellin\'s annual flower festival injured 35 in the Antioquia 
capital.  The FARC orchestrated an attempted mass kidnapping 
in February at an upper-class condominium complex in Neiva, 
Huila Department (one hostage was released two months later 
and three remain in captivity).  The group also kidnapped 
seven people on Christmas Eve in Antioquia Department and 
massacred 16 for suspected paramilitary sympathies on New 
Year\'s Eve. Both the FARC and ELN continued attacks against 
the country\'s infrastructure and oil pipelines in 2003, 
albeit at reduced levels. 
 
ELN:  In June, the ELN showed some signs of being willing to 
negotiate with the GOC using the Mexican Government as a 
mediator.  The group continues fighting but has limited 
resources and dwindling membership.  The most noteworthy ELN 
terrorist act of the year was the July kidnapping of the 
Roman Catholic Bishop of Yopal, allegedly conducted to send a 
political message to the nation. 
 
AUC and other paramilitaries: The AUC declared a cease-fire 
in November 2002.  Since that time AUC murders and massacres 
are down by approximately 70 and 80 percent, respectively, 
according to GOC figures.  Although the overall number of 
displacements caused by paramilitaries fell, paramilitaries 
continued to forcibly displace civilians residing along key 
drug and weapons transit corridors or suspected of being 
guerrilla sympathizers.  For example, on April 18, 
paramilitaries displaced 600, killed 12, and \"disappeared\" 30 
indigenous Wayuu in Bahia Portete, La Guajira Department.  In 
late-June one AUC leader kidnapped former Senator Jose 
Eduardo Gnecco and his family at an illegal checkpoint on a 
highway between Magdalena and La Guajira. 
 
(U) P) AREAS IN HOST NATION WHERE TERRORISTS ARE RELATIVELY 
FREE TO OPERATE (I.E., TERRORIST SANCTUARIES) EITHER BECAUSE 
HOST GOVERNMENT CANNOT OR WILL NOT INTERVENE:  Although the 
GOC had established a state presence in every municipality by 
February (under the auspices of President Uribe\'s Democratic 
Security Strategy), terrorists used remote jungle areas, poor 
rural and urban municipalities, cattle ranches, and mountain 
strongholds as operating bases throughout the year. 
 
(SBU) Q) MAJOR CT DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING ARRESTS, TRIALS AND 
IMPRISONMENT OF TERRORISTS AND TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT WERE 
PREVENTED:  The FARC had the most killed and captured for the 
year: 
 
-- Extradited FARC General Staff Member Ricardo Palmera, 
\"Simon Trinidad\" (extradited to the U.S. on December 31), 
 
-- Imprisoned FARC drug-runner/financier Omaira 
Rojas-Cabrera, \"Nayibe Rojas Valderrama\" or \"Sonia,\" 
 
-- Killed FARC Teofilo Forero Mobile Column (TFMC) operations 
chief Humberto Valbuena, \"Yerbas\" (replacing El Mocho, killed 
in 2003), 
 
-- Arrested FARC international liaison chief Rodrigo Granda. 
 
Numerous attacks against President Uribe and urban centers 
were thwarted by the security forces, but it is impossible to 
cite a definitive number.  The most recent FARC attempt 
against President Uribe was uncovered by the police on 
December 15 when they found a cache of 330 pounds of the high 
explosive anfo intended to be used in a strike against the 
presidential aircraft during a visit to Cartagena.

SUBJECT: 2004 COUNTER-TERRORISM WRAP-UP 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
------- 
Summary 
-------- 
 
1. (C) In spite of limited air mobility and ground 
support/fixed wing aircraft and the challenge of supporting 
some 17,000 troops of Plan Patriota operating in hostile 
jungle, the security forces made great advances in 2004, 
re-taking 11 FARC-run villages and destroying over 400 FARC 
camps.  Elsewhere in the country, the police and military 
maintained an unprecedented high operational tempo against 
all illegal armed groups, which led to the capture of several 
important terrorist commanders and hurt active combat units. 
Interservice cooperation is improving, and the recently 
appointed high command is one of the most skilled and 
U.S.-friendly in Colombian history.  Desertion and 
demobilization programs have removed approximately 10,000 
terrorists from the battlefield.  End Summary. 
 
------------- 
Plan Patriota 
------------- 
 
2. (C) Plan Patriota phase 2B (a more than 17,000 troop 
effort targeting the FARC in southern Colombia) operations 
destroyed 420 FARC encampments, occupied 11 formerly FARC-run 
villages, killed or captured almost 500 guerrillas, and 
clearly brought the fight to the enemy.  The FARC is spending 
more of its time thinking about its own preservation than 
coordinating offensive operations.  The group failed to pull 
off a major attack in Bogota in 2004.  Plan Patriota troops 
seized nearly 250,000 kilograms of FARC rations, over 200,000 
gallons of fuel, 500 vehicles, and numerous other supplies. 
Almost 300 kilograms of cocaine, five HCL labs, and 1,277 
hectares of coca have been destroyed.  Occupying troops also 
have found FARC code books, financial information, and other 
strategic paperwork that provide valuable intelligence.  GOC 
operations have forced senior FARC leaders to withdraw 
rapidly (they even reportedly captured Secretariat member 
Mono Jojoy\'s trademark black beret).  In one case, they found 
evidence that the U.S. hostages had recently been kept in a 
destroyed camp (GOC forces remain committed to the hostages\' 
safety, but a chance encounter remains possible). 
 
3. (C) The military is struggling with the logistical 
challenge of supporting 17,000 troops in the vast, hostile 
area of operations.  Limited air mobility and ground 
support/fixed wing aircraft are serious constraints.  GOC 
forces are taking casualties, and there are few resources 
available to MEDEVAC wounded soldiers from increasingly 
remote areas.  Sixty-seven Colombian soldiers have been 
killed and 328 wounded in combat since phase 2B began in 
February.  Landmines are one of the leading causes of deaths 
and injuries.  The security forces are enduring more than 
1,600 long, painful cases of leishmanaisis from jungle 
living.  Half of an entire mobile brigade had to be taken out 
of operations to recover from the disease.  Plan Patriota 
leadership is revamping the soldiers\' leave schedule and 
improving medical assistance in the field to address the 
problem. 
 
------------------------ 
Elsewhere in the Country 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Military and police set records for operations against 
high value targets, active combat units, and support elements 
of all three terrorist organizations, the FARC, ELN, and 
paramilitaries. 
 
5. (C) The most important commanders killed or captured 
during the year included: 
 
--FARC General Staff Member Ricardo Palmera, \"Simon Trinidad\" 
(extradited to the U.S. on December 31), 
 
--FARC drug-runner/financier Omaira Rojas-Cabrera, \"Nayibe 
Rojas Valderrama\" or \"Sonia,\" 
 
--FARC Teofilo Forero Mobile Column (TFMC) operations chief 
Humberto Valbuena, \"Yerbas\" (replacing \"El Mocho,\" killed in 
2003), 
 
--FARC international liaison chief Rodrigo Granda, 
 
--ELN senior field commander Jose Ramiro Velez, \"El Viejo,\" 
and 
 
--Erminson Cabrera, brother of FARC General Staff member 
\"Fabian Ramirez\" and suspected replacement for Sonia. 
 
--Jose Maria Barros Ipuana, \"Chema Balas,\" believed to be one 
of senior AUC commander Jorge Tovar\'s deputies and implicated 
in a massacre of 12 indigenous people in April. 
 
6. (C) Operations against paramilitary groups are at record 
highs.  For example: 
 
- Over 530 paramilitaries were killed and 4,450 were captured 
in 2004, an increase of approximately 80 and 60 percent, 
respectively, compared to 2003, according to the GOC. 
 
- When AUC Commander Jorge Tovar kidnapped a former senator, 
the GOC ordered the authorities to arrest Tovar wherever they 
could find him, including inside the concentration zone in 
Cordoba Department. 
 
- The GOC refused to accept known drug trafficker Juan Carlos 
Sierra as an AUC negotiator and ordered the authorities to 
arrest him. 
 
- During operation \"Santuario\" in September, the military 
killed and captured hundreds of members of the Self-Defense 
Forces of Casanare (ACC), which is not participating in peace 
talks and was responsible for a large percentage of the 
violence on the eastern plains. 
 
7. (U) Violence indicators nationwide are improving. 
According to the National Police, murders decreased by 16 
percent in 2004 (22,700 in 2003 and 19,010 in 2004), 
kidnapping fell 44 percent, terrorist acts fell 42 percent, 
and extortion fell 15 percent in 2004. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Interservice Cooperation a Priority 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Despite resource shortages and the service-centric 
approach of former Army commander General Carreno, which 
forced each service to look out for its own interests, 
interservice coordination improved in 2004.  With the naming 
of General Castellanos to head the Army, Colombia perhaps now 
has the most professional, internally cooperative, 
U.S.-friendly high command in its national history, and for 
the first time is experimenting with a joint operational 
structure in the traditional divisions, to mimic the success 
of U.S. combat commands.  The military created a joint 
Caribbean Command and a joint intelligence coordination 
center, both of which are headed up by U.S.-friendly generals 
with proven track records. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Deserters and Demobilizations on the Rise 
----------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The various deserter and demobilization programs have 
now removed about 10,000 active terrorists from the field 
(more than 6,000 individual deserters from all groups, about 
1,000 paramilitaries from 2003 collective demobilizations, 
and close to 3,000 paramilitaries from late 2004 
demobilizations) since President Uribe took office in 2002. 
The AUC peace process also is sowing deep divisions among the 
paramilitary leadership and forcing them to distinguish 
between drug traffickers and bona fide members of the 
movement.  AUC commanders Carlos Castano and Miguel Arroyave, 
both wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges, were 
killed or forcibly disappeared by fellow paramilitaries. 
However, the lack of an adequate legal framework to deal with 
those accused of violent crimes, the institutional weaknesses 
of the demobilization process itself, and the inability of 
the security forces to significantly increase their presence 
in areas of demobilization are all threats to the process.

1.  (SBU) Summary.  On December 22, Ambassador Wood met with 
ChevronTexaco\'s Chairman of the Board, David O\'Reilly, and 
other ChevronTexaco executives to discuss oil and gas related 
issues in Colombia.  O\'Reilly was pleased with the 
relationship between Colombia and ChevronTexaco, and said his 
company is interested in future gas projects, but concerned 
about the level of energy sector expertise in the Uribe 
Administration.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) ChevronTexaco\'s Chairman met with Ambassador Wood 
after earlier meetings with President Uribe and the Minister 
of Mines and Energy, Luis Ernesto Mejia.  O\'Reilly stated 
that President Uribe was very enthusiastic about 
ChevronTexaco\'s current investment in Guajira and asked if 
more investment was coming.  O\'Reilly responded that the 
investment process takes time, but that ChevronTexaco was 
interested in exporting gas to both Venezuela and Panama from 
its fields in the north of Colombia in the near term.  Per 
O\'Reilly, Venezuela eventually would like to export gas to 
Asian markets via a pipeline to the Pacific. 
ChevronTexaco\'s president for Latin America, Ali Moshiri, 
stated that the Colombia-Venezuela gas project is simple in 
concept (200km onshore pipeline from Guajira, Colombia to 
Maracaibo, Venezuela).  Uribe and Chavez agreed at a 
political level to a gas pipeline project, but Venezuela has 
since requested more surveys and it was not clear that either 
leader had specifics in mind when they agreed to the project. 
 ChevronTexaco is also interested in a possible offshore gas 
pipeline to Panama. 
 
3.  (U) O\'Reilly commented that the investment climate has 
dramatically improved, noting that under Uribe contract 
negotiations took less than three months as opposed to three 
years under other administrations.  Ambassador Wood added 
that the pro-business Uribe Administration has provided a 
predictable business environment in Colombia via reforms, 
especially in the hydrocarbon sector. 
 
4.  (SBU) O\'Reilly relayed his concern regarding oil and gas 
expertise in Uribe\'s Administration.  He cited the GOC\'s 
willingness to explore and expand the hydrocarbon industry, 
but noted their lack of understanding of the technicalities. 
Ambassador Wood relayed President Bush\'s commitment to 
President Uribe to send an energy trade mission to Colombia. 
 
5.  (SBU) ChevronTexaco\'s chairman ended by saying there are 
many opportunities in Colombia, but the GOC needs in depth 
and objective technical advice regarding Colombia\'s future in 
the hydrocarbon sector.

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (U) This is an action request. Please see paras 7 and 8. 
 
2. (C) Summary: Relations between the GOC and the Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bogota, in 
particular with the approach of director Michael Fruhling, 
remain strained.  Per ref a, the GOC views the OHCHR office 
here as neither constructive nor transparent.  The situation 
may deteriorate once the OHCHR circulates its draft report 
for the Commission on Human Rights.  The Foreign Minister 
attempted to discuss the situation with UN High Commissioner 
for Human Rights Louise Arbour during a November trip to 
Geneva, but Arbour and her deputy were traveling.  Arbour has 
not been engaged on Colombia.  Embassy believes that a 
conversation between a high-ranking GOC official and Arbour 
needs to occur soon to avoid a diplomatic dust-up.  Arbour 
will be in New York Jan. 10-12 to sign an agreement with 
Guatemala.  This could be a target of opportunity for the GOC 
as well as for the U.S. and other G-24 members who believe 
that Arbour needs to know trouble is brewing in her largest 
operation outside of Geneva.  End Summary. 
 
3. (C) On December 29 Bogota and Geneva polcouns met with 
Gianni Magazzeni, acting chief of the field operations branch 
in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) about the field office in Bogota, the approach of its 
director, Swedish diplomat Michael Fruhling, and the GOC\'s 
growing frustration with his implementation of the office\'s 
mandate.  Magazzeni (protect) was not surprised to hear of 
GOC concerns with the OHCHR operation in Bogota (reftels). 
He agreed with Embassy assessment that Fruhling\'s approach is 
antagonistic and aggressive rather than supportive with an 
eye to helping the GOC build capacity to improve the human 
rights situation in the country.  He stressed that the 
OHCHR\'s 27 recommendations should be a point of departure for 
discussions and not \"the bible.\"  GOC implementation of them 
should be only one indicator in assessing its progress. 
Finally, he indicated that most inside OHCHR headquarters, 
including High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour, 
were unaware that Fruhling\'s insistence on total compliance 
of the recommendations was causing problems for the GOC at 
the highest levels.  According to Magazzeni, the mandate is 
not wrong; it is the implementation. 
 
4. (C) Magazzeni said the OHCHR has been politically 
rudderless on field operations since the death of former HCHR 
Sergio Vieira de Mello and the retirement of field operations 
branch chief Jan Cedregren (Sweden) in the first half of 
2004.  As a result, field offices directors have had close to 
a free rein, including Fruhling.  Magazzeni admitted that, as 
acting branch chief, he has been unsuccessful in reining them 
in because they outrank him and have been allowed to travel 
and raise money directly with donor countries.  He tried to 
slash Fruhling\'s budget to bring it line with OHCHR 
priorities (meshing more directly with other UN operations on 
the ground) but was ignored.  Fruhling has told colleagues 
that he has the complete support of the donor community in 
Colombia.  During a visit to Geneva in November, he cited an 
additional $1.9 million pledge from the U.S. earmarked for 
his operation, as proof of U.S. backing. 
 
5. (C) Magazzeni noted that the OHCHR approach toward 
Colombia, a country that had requested UN assistance, was 
skewed.  It was seemingly held to a higher standard than 
China, Iran, Sudan and others where UN assistance had not 
been sought and the OHCHR was trying to engage. 
 
6. (C) Magazzeni expressed surprise that both Arbour and her 
deputy were out of Geneva in late November when Foreign 
Minister Carolina Barco passed through for an IOM meeting and 
had hoped to discuss GOC concerns about the OHCHR\'s Bogota 
office.  Arbour, still assembling her team, traveling 
frequently, and immersed on other issues, has not focused on 
Colombia.  A trip to Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico was 
planned for last October but put off.  When OHCHR field 
operations directors were in Geneva in November, Arbour met 
with each one for only 15 minutes.  That 15 minute meeting 
with Fruhling has been her only substantive briefing on OHCHR 
operations in Colombia.   Magazzeni advised that Arbour would 
be in New York on Jan. 10-12 to sign an agreement with 
Guatemala and suggested that the GOC make another attempt to 
see her. He recommended that G-24 countries should also weigh 
in with her. 
 
-------------------------- 
COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST 
-------------------------- 
 
7. (C) The GOC and the OHCHR are both working to improve 
human rights in Colombia, but are approaching the issue from 
adversarial positions that undermine the effectiveness of 
each and, most importantly, reduce the progress that can and 
should be made.  The relationship between the GOC and the 
OHCHR Bogota office may deteriorate further once the OHCHR 
shares its draft report to the Commission on Human Rights. 
The U.S. objective should be two-fold: (1) to faciliate an 
exchange between Arbour and a key GOC interlocutor; and (2) 
to make Arbour aware that all is not well in Bogota.  It is 
up to her to decide what to do about it.  Arbour\'s presence 
in New York on January 10-12 is a target of opportunity for 
the GOC, the U.S. and other G-24 members.  The timing would 
be particularly ideal if the GOC and the UN proceed with a 
planned meeting in New York the week of January 17 to discuss 
the future of the entire UN presence in Colombia (also 
reported reftel). 
 
8. (C) Embassy has informed the MFA that Arbour will be in 
New York next week.  As Colombian permrep Holguin is close to 
President Uribe, Embassy recommends that the Department 
instruct USUN to reach out to her regarding Arbour\'s arrival 
and the utility of presenting GOC views directly to her.  A 
direct approach by the U.S. to Arbour would be useful but 
more effective if done in concert with other G-24 members. 
Canada (as G-24 chair), the Netherlands (which continues to 
represent the EU in Bogota since Luxembourg has no 
representation here), the UK, Brazil, and Spain, in 
particular, would likely give Arbour the same message. 
Embassy also recommends that the Department request Ottawa 
and the others to engage on this issue, in New York, Geneva 
or in capitals.  Embassy understands that several G-24 
foreign ministers will be in New York on Jan. 12 for a 
Security Council meeting on Haiti.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIA\'S ECONOMY IN 2004 LOOKED STRONG, BUT... 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
 1.   (C)  Summary:  While the Colombian economy posted 
positive results in 2004, the sustainability of such 
performance is still in question.  On the macroeconomic side, 
growth reached almost 4 percent; IMF targets for the budget 
deficit, inflation, and reserves were either met or exceeded; 
public indebtedness declined to less than 50 percent of GDP; 
exports and imports both increased over 15 percent; foreign 
direct investment increased over 70 percent; the stock market 
surged forward buoyed by investor confidence; and 
unemployment, while still in double digits, declined.  Behind 
the good news, however, lurked structural problems that 
threaten the longevity of the recent recovery: basic \"guns 
vs. butter\" pressures on spending; an inability to address 
key pension and fiscal reforms; failure to position the 
country for optimum gains under an FTA; and the government\'s 
susceptibility to special interests, be it exporters 
clamoring for protection from exchange risk or industries 
unwilling to face competition under an FTA.  While there are 
signs that the Government wants to take the steps necessary 
to overcome these problems, there are also signs that it may 
not be able to completely resist sectoral pressures.  End 
Summary. 
 
The Positive Numbers 
 
2.  (U)  The Colombian economy continued its recovery in 
2004.  Growth will be somewhere in the 3.5-3.8 percent range, 
just shy of the projected 4 percent and in keeping with 
2003\'s 3.7 percent growth.  The GOC met the 2.5 percent GDP 
target for the budget deficit (thanks in large part to record 
oil revenues) and inflation, at 5.5 percent, was the lowest 
in 49 years and met the IMF program target. The peso 
appreciated 12 percent in 2004 in real terms, allowing the 
Central Bank to increase reserves 30 percent to USD 13 
billion, but also generating considerable concern among 
exporters.  The peso\'s appreciation also helped total 
indebtedness drop to less than 50 percent of GDP, and allowed 
the GOC to switch the composition of the debt more heavily 
towards domestic sources.  Despite the appreciation, exports 
grew over 20 percent in 2004, outstripping import growth of 
15 percent.  Export growth was greatly aided by price 
increases for coffee, oil and coal that helped offset the 
effects of the peso\'s appreciation.  Non-traditional exports 
also posted their largest increase since 1999. 
3.  (U) Investor confidence, both foreign and domestic, also 
increased.  The stock market grew by almost 50 percent for a 
second straight year - the second best performance of any 
world market monitored by Bloomberg.  Foreign direct 
investment increased over 70 percent from 2003, led mostly by 
increased investment in extractive industries.  Large 
multinationals, such as ExxonMobil and Telefonica returned to 
Colombia and regional investors from Brazil bought up the 
national airline and a local steel mill. 
 
4.  (SBU) While at 12.5 percent, unemployment is down from 18 
percent when President Uribe took power, many see its 
persistence as the single biggest threat to President Uribe\'s 
popularity.  While the numbers at the end of the year show 
improvement, the year has seen spikes as high as 17 percent 
and the average at 14 percent. Central Bank economists note 
that unemployment is a lagging indicator, but after 2 years 
of strong positive growth, the government is still waiting 
for a decline to single digit levels. 
 
The Underlying Dark Clouds 
 
5.   (C)  The Uribe government faces structural issues that 
need to be addressed if the current economic recovery is to 
yield sustainable results.  These include a need to 
rationalize spending and tax collection and shoring up the 
social security system (whose trust fund ran out in 2004). 
Government attempts to fix the problem via law in 2002 and 
public referendum in 2003 either failed or were watered down. 
 Attempts in 2004 to pass these reforms also failed. The 
result, the GOC has cut back on some spending, but has not 
been able to rationalize its collections (which at 20 percent 
of GDP are already higher than the Latin American average). 
Colombia\'s tax rate, at 38.5 percent is high, as is its VAT 
at 16 percent.  The tax base has also grown from 400,000 to 1 
million since 2002 thanks to stopgap reforms, but a more 
systemic reform has been impossible.  According to central 
bank officials, the fiscal situation could be summed up 
easily: constitutionally mandated transfers to the regions 
take up 5 percent of GDP; another 5 percent of GDP goes to 
security; 5 percent for social security and pensions; and 5 
percent for debt payment.  Thus, the government runs out of 
collections (20 percent of GDP) before it can even pay for 
its basic operations or key social programs. 
 
6.  (C)  Under the Uribe Administration, budget items for 
security have increased 46 percent.  Although Congress wants 
more money for social programs, Uribe plans to continue 
funding security items first, then social programs.  Uribe,s 
policy is bent on fixing the ship, not just plugging holes. 
2004 began with Colombian security forces stationed in every 
municipality throughout Colombia, an environment not seen in 
over 40 years.  According to the the Colombian Vice 
President\'s Human Rights Office, 2004 ended with a 41 percent 
decrease in displacements of Colombian citizens.  Key 
indicators, such as kidnappings and murders have also 
decreased by over 50 percent since Uribe came to power. 
The security mission is working. 
 
7.  (C)  The FTA with the US will offer Colombia important 
new opportunities, but the GOC\'s inability to resist sectoral 
pressures and get its economy ready for greater competition 
could reduce these benefits.  The GOC began the FTA 
negotiations thinking it could use  narco-terrorism to seek 
special treatment.  The Colombians tried to raise this 
argument at the highest levels, but failed to win support for 
it.   Subsequently, during the sixth round of FTA 
negotiations, the GOC took a positive step and began to 
negotiate, but we are still far from closure on key sectors 
such as intellectual property and agriculture. Both of these 
sectors are fearful that an open market will fatally damage 
their businesses. 
 
8.  The GOC is facing a difficult challenge.  While President 
Uribe\'s commitment to fully take advantage of an FTA is 
unquestioned, the steps his government needs to take require 
goring many of the oxen of his key supporters.  The GOC 
recognizes the need to modernize both its agencies and 
Colombia\'s economy and infrastructure to prepare for an FTA. 
To that end, they have begun to focus on what they call the 
\"internal agenda\"- a series of initiatives designed to 
increase Colombia\'s competitiveness.  To date, however, there 
have been no concrete proposals put forward, a testament to 
the difficulty of balancing the many sectoral interests 
involved.  Many of these changes require legislation and 
President Uribe has no political party to exert discipline on 
the Congressional ranks.  President Uribe must also  change a 
protectionist mind-set not only in the business sector but in 
much of the government\'s bureaucracy. 
 
9.  (C) The recent GOC decision to provide subsidies to 
flower and banana exporters to counter the negative effects 
of the peso\'s 14 percent depreciation reflects the 
government\'s susceptibility to internal pressure.  A 
mechanism to protect other politically powerful agricultural 
groups is also under design according to the Minister of 
Agriculture.  These efforts have drawn criticism for favoring 
a select few rather than the many, but the GOC continues to 
believe in such support mechanisms.

PRIVATIZATION

1.  (C) Summary.  While the telecommunications chapter in the 
Andean Free Trade Agreement (FTA) should conclude at the next 
round, Colombia will be unable to fully enjoy the benefits of 
the chapter without either privatization or joint ventures as 
well as more autonomy for the Colombian Regulator (CRT). 
Nevertheless, significant opposition to privatization exists 
from various sectors in Colombia.  In general, the sector 
enjoyed a good year in 2004, especially in the wireless area, 
but continued growth faces important structural obstacles. 
End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2.  (C) The telecommunications sector as a percentage of GDP 
reached 2.8 percent for 2003 and is expected to grow to 3 
percent of GDP for 2004.  There are only three long distance 
operators, two state-owned and one 50 percent state-owned, 
three cellular operators, two private and one state-owned, 
one private trunking operator, and over a hundred local 
landline operators, many of which are unauthorized.  All 
three long distance operators are losing market share to the 
cellular operators, and industry experts state that as 
individual companies, none of them are able to compete 
against the capital-rich private carriers. Corruption 
continues to be a major problem for the state-owned 
companies.  This compelled the Colombian negotiating team to 
request U.S. assistance, in the form of a side letter, in the 
telecommunications chapter of the FTA.  In the face of a free 
trade agreement (FTA) with the U.S., industry experts claim 
Colombia\'s telecommunications sector needs to privatize to 
gain more capital and provide better infrastructure, reduce 
corruption, lower international phone charges and compete 
more effectively. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Where The Telecommunications Sector Is Heading 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (U) Over the last two years Colombia has experienced the 
rapid growth of mobile and internet networks.  According to 
the Regulatory Commission on Telecommunications, in 2003 
mobile and internet users increased by 33 percent and 60 
percent, respectively, from 2002.  In mid 2004, the number of 
mobile users surpassed the number of landlines.  From 2000 to 
2003, the overall penetration of mobile and internet services 
for every 100 Colombians increased from 5.3 percent to 13.9 
percent and from 2.1 percent to 6.24 percent, respectively, 
while landlines remained at 17 percent.  Earnings generated 
by mobile and internet networks represented 28 percent of 
total earnings for the telecommunications sector for 2003. 
 
4.  (C) The boom of mobile communications continues with the 
recent sale of BellSouth (Latin America) to Telefonica.  The 
two main mobile service providers, Telefonica and Comcel, 
control more than 80 percent of the Colombian mobile market. 
The other mobile company is Colombia Movil or \"Ola\", which is 
jointly owned by Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM) and 
Empresas de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota (ETB), both owned by 
municipal governments.  According to industry experts, Ola is 
in dire straits with its former president under investigation 
for mismanagement of funds, unsatisfied customers due to an 
increase in dropped calls and an unsustainable business plan. 
 Another player in the mobile market, but without a mobile 
license, is Avantel, a U.S. trunked operator.  Avantel uses 
technology similar to Nextel and had been in the Colombian 
market since 1998.  Without a mobile license however, the 
other mobile operators refuse to interconnect with Avantel, 
causing Avantel to drop in market share from 7 percent to 1.5 
percent.  On December 16, President Uribe signed Decree 4239, 
granting full interconnection rights to trunking operators, 
including Avantel.  Although this is good news for Avantel, 
the conditions and enforcement measures will be the key test 
for Avantel\'s success.  According to the Colombian 
Association for Cellular Operators (ASOCEL), Sprint-Nextel 
will buy Avantel if Avantel achieves the same access given to 
mobile operators. 
 
------------------ 
A Voice of Reason 
------------------ 
 
5.  (SBU) A major blow to the state-owned companies came when 
Colombia\'s national telecommunications company, 
Telecomunicaciones de Colombia, declared bankruptcy in 2003. 
The end result was a \"leaner\" new company called Colombia 
Telecomunicaciones or \"Telecom\", which currently does not own 
the assets of the bankrupt company, but utilizes them to 
ensure continuity of phone service to over 900 
municipalities.  Its president, Alfonso Gomez, realizes the 
challenges Telecom faces and told econoff that Telecom will 
focus on Internet and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 
services.  The young and innovative president also 
understands that the capital-strapped state company cannot 
compete head to head with the private telecoms.  (One saving 
grace that these state-owned telephone companies have is 
time; the expiration date for the exorbitantly priced long 
distance license fees (USD 150 million) is 2008, Reftel B). 
 
----------------- 
Talk of a Merger 
----------------- 
6.  (SBU) Gomez met in late November to discuss a merger with 
the other two long distance operators, Orbitel (which is 
owned by the Medellin city government) and ETB (owned by 
Bogota\'s city government).  Following the merger meeting, 
then-Vice Minister of Communications, Maria Paula Duque, said 
\"with the entry of multinationals and soon the FTA, the 
state-owned telephone companies have realized that the only 
way to compete in the future is to have better economies of 
scale.\"  Although her statement is correct in principle, the 
idea of having an even larger state-owned player in the 
telecommunications sector is worrisome to foreign investors 
as well as to consumers.  Duque believes that from a 
management point of view, a merger is an excellent idea, but 
according to industry experts it is counterintuitive to 
providing a transparent and competitive sector.  The problem 
with a merger of the state-owned telephone companies, which 
combined have 87.5 percent of the total land lines in 
Colombia, is that Colombia\'s telecommunications land-line 
sector would become a nontransparent and noncompetitive 
market.  Viewed in conjunction with the close ties between 
the telecommunications regulatory authority and the GOC, this 
could easily reinforce rigidities in the regulatory regime 
related to licensing and interconnection policies. 
 
7.  (C) In the sixth round of FTA negotiations, which 
followed the merger meeting in Colombia, the U.S. negotiator 
directly asked the Colombian negotiator if the 
telecommunications sector in Colombia was becoming less 
competitive due to talks of a merger.  The Colombians refused 
to acknowledge any talk of a merger and asserted that nothing 
to date has affected the competitive climate in Colombia. 
Since the round, there has been no talk of a merger in the 
press or in the halls of the state-owned telephone companies. 
 
------- 
The FTA 
------- 
 
8.  (C) The GOC is heading into the seventh round of the free 
trade agreement negotiations intent on preventing a carve out 
for mobile communication service providers (found in CAFTA 
and other U.S. FTA agreements), not in the interests of the 
Colombian mobile sector and the public, but in the interests 
of the government and the state-owned telecommunications 
companies.  The state-owned companies feel that it\'s unfair 
that obligations set forth in the FTA only apply to 
fixed-line companies.  Other issues to be addressed are 
illegal phone traffic and transparency. 
 
9.  (C) During the sixth round, the Colombian negotiators 
again asked for U.S. assistance to combat illegal 
international phone traffic, originating in the U.S. (Reftel 
C), via a side letter.  Although the issue is still being 
negotiated, the FCC could not police the corruption within 
Colombia\'s state-owned telephone companies.  The illegal 
traffic is almost exclusively using Voice over IP technology 
and the only companies that have access to VoIP are the 
state-owned phone companies.  These companies also have a 
monopoly on both long distance and internet services.  Thus, 
one part of the company is profiting from the illegal 
activity, while hurting the other.

10.  (U) A few telecommunication conferences have paralleled 
the FTA negotiations and have all focused on Colombia\'s 
future and the need for further deregulation.  Many of the 
speakers have focused on the need to modernize the industry\'s 
operations and infrastructure via foreign direct investment. 
They mentioned that public telecommunication companies, 
primarily ETB, Telecom, Orbitel, EPM, and EMCALI, should look 
to merge with private companies because the public sector 
does not have adequate access to capital and cannot react 
quickly to technology changes.  Further, it has weak 
administrative and commercial departments, high labor costs 
and antiquated networks. 
 
11.  (U) Arguments against the privatization of the 
telecommunications sector span the commercial, financial and 
political spectrums.  They assert that privatization will 
reduce national coverage, cut Colombian jobs and defy the 
1991 Constitution (the Constitution states that the Colombian 
government must provide public services to all Colombians and 
telecommunications is a public service).  The political 
opponents to privatizing claim that due to Colombia\'s high 
poverty level, privatization of the sector will force 
telecommunication operators to focus only on profitable 
regions in Colombia, leaving antiquated networks or no 
networks in rural and poor urban areas.  Currently, Telecom 
is required to provide telecommunication services to all 
areas in Colombia, but if it privatized, opponents believe 
that Telecom would focus on the cities and bypass the rural 
poor areas.  Commercial and financial opponents believe that 
privatizing would invite the major foreign telecommunications 
providers to enter the Colombian market, buy out the 
parastatals, slash Colombian jobs by the thousands, and 
reduce the government\'s revenues. 
 
12.  (C) Those against privatization consist of the Ministry 
of Communications, municipal officials, mayors, and obviously 
the state-owned operators.  Colombian FTA negotiators are 
quick to point out that the privatization section of the 
telecommunications text had been previously deleted in prior 
U.S. FTA agreements.  Lucho Garzon, mayor of Bogota, is the 
most vocal against privatization of the telecommunication 
sector, (Garzon and his own ETB, the second largest 
telecommunications operator in Colombia, provide the city 
with considerable revenues.)  Medellin\'s mayor and council, 
who own EPM, the third largest telecom in the country, share 
a similar view.

Trade Development Agency and the New Telecommunications Law 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
13.  (C) The Trade Development Agency has awarded a contract 
to a telecommunications consulting firm to conduct a market 
study for the Ministry of Communications.  Areas to be 
studied are long distance license fees, deployment of 
broadband networks, the competitive environment of mobile 
communications, and enforcement mechanisms of the Ministry of 
Communications and CRT.  The group will also propose policy 
options for the Ministry and CRT regarding spectrum, VoIP, 
license fees for new cellular and long distance operators, 
and unbundling.  According to Ministry of Communications\' 
officials, the study\'s findings will be used to help draft a 
new telecommunications law, which will be presented to 
Congress in March 2005.  A key aspect of the study will be a 
proposal for a more autonomous regulator.  Although CRT 
officials are in favor of a regulator independent of the 
Ministry, CRT officials, to include the Director, claim that 
the Ministry of Communications will not be in favor of 
relinquishing their hold over the CRT.
