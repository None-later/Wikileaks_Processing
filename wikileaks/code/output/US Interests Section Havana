1. (C)  WE NOTE, FROM CUBAN MEDIA REPORTING, THAT CUBAN 
PARTICIPANTS IN THE UNHRC DEBATE ON MARCH 4 AND 5 CLAIMED 
THAT THE GOC PERMITS BROAD FREEDOM FOR ARTISTS AND WRITERS. 
OUR DELEGATION MAY FIND THE QUOTATION BELOW FROM A CASTRO SPEECH 
IN JUNE 1961 OF USE IN REPLYING TO SUCH RIDICULOUS ASSERTIONS. 
THE SPEECH HAS SINCE BECOME FAMOUS AS HAVING SET DOWN GUIDELINES 
FOR STATE AND PARTY VIEWS ON OBLIGATIONS OF ARTISTS AND WRITERS. 
IT WAS GIVEN EXTEMPORANEOUSLY IN THREE SEPARATE SESSIONS ON 
JUNE 16, 23, AND 30, 1961, IN THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF HAVANA. 
 
2. (U) BEGIN QUOTE: 
\"THE PROBLEM WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING HERE, AND ARE GOING 
TO TOUCH ON FURTHER, IS THE PROBLEM OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION 
FOR WRITERS AND ARTISTS...THE REVOLUTION MUST HAVE AS ITS 
OBJECTIVE THAT ALL HONEST MEN AND WOMEN, WHETHER WRITERS OR NOT, 
MARCH TOGETHER WITH IT...THE REVOLUTION MUST TRY TO WIN TO ITS 
IDEAS THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE...THEREFORE, WITHIN THE REVOLUTION, 
EVERYTHING; AGAINST THE REVOLUTION, NOTHING.  AGAINST THE 
REVOLUTION, NOTHING, BECAUSE THE REVOLUTION ALSO HAS ITS RIGHTS, 
AND THE FIRST RIGHT OF THE REVOLUTION IS THE RIGHT TO EXIST, AND 
NO ONE HAS PRECEDENCE BEFORE THE RIGHT OF THE REVOLUTION TO BE 
AND TO EXIST...IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE REVOLUTION. 
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES, THAT IS TO SAY, ENEMIES OF THE 
REVOLUTION, HAVE NO RIGHTS AGAINST THE REVOLUTION, BECAUSE THE 
REVOLUTION HAS A RIGHT: THE RIGHT TO EXIST, THE RIGHT TO 
DEVELOP AND THE RIGHT TO BE VICTORIOUS...\". 
 
3. (C)  IF THE DELEGATION MAKES USE OF THIS QUOTATION, IT MIGHT 
ADD TO ITS PRESENTATION AN INVITATION TO ANY OF THE CUBAN 
DELEGATES TO DISAGREE WITH THIS QUOTATION IF THEY THINK IT NO 
LONGER EXPRESSES CUBAN POLICY ON ARTISTIC FREEDOM.

2.  SUMMARY:  A RECURRING THEME IN FIDEL CASTRO\'S 
SPEECHES SINCE THE END OF THE OCHOA/ABRANTES 
SCANDALS LAST SUMMER HAS BEEN THAT THE 
TRAUMA HAS STRENGTHENED THE GOC RATHER THAN 
WEAKENED IT.  KEEPING A HEAVY SCHEDULE OF VISITS 
TO CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL SITES IN HAVANA 
AND CENTRAL CUBA, HE HAS CLAIMED THAT CUBA 
IS MAKING GREAT STRIDES TOWARD \"DOING MORE WITH 
LESS\" AND REMEDYING ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  HE 
AND THE PARTY-CONTROLLED PRESS HAVE ALSO 
ENDEAVORED TO PORTRAY CUBA AS MUCH BETTER OFF 
THAN THOSE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES EXPERIMENTING 
WITH \"UNWISE\" POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS. 
COUNTERING AN IMPRESSION OF ISOLATION IN THE 
SOCIALIST WORLD, OFFICIAL MEDIA HAVE ALSO 
BEEN STRESSING CUBA\'S CLOSE TIES TO GDR AND 
CHINA.  THE JAWBONING WILL PROBABLY HAVE LIMITED 
EFFECT ON PUBLIC ATTITUDES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
- 
3.  FIDEL CASTRO HAS MADE, EVEN FOR HIM, A 
LARGE NUMBER OF PUBLIC APPEARANCES AND SPEECHES 
SINCE THE COMMUNIST PARTY DAILY, GRANMA, ON 
SEPTEMBER 2 DECLARED THE OCHOA/ABRANTES CASES 
CLOSED AND URGED THE NATION TO MOVE FORWARD 
WITH THE LESSONS LEARNED OVER THE SUMMER. 
CASTRO HAS TRAVELED AROUND HAVANA, MATANZAS 
(AT THE VARADERO AIRPORT OPENING), AND THE 
CENTRAL CUBAN PROVINCE OF VILLA CLARA TO SPEAK 
MOSTLY TO CROWDS OF CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL 
WORKERS.  MOST OF THE SPEECHES HAVE BEEN BROADCAST 
OVER PRIME-TIME TV AND CARRIED IN GRANMA. 
 
- 
4.  AT EACH STOP, CASTRO HAS BEEN PREACHING 
BASICALLY THE SAME LINE:  CUBA HAS EMERGED FROM 
THE SCANDALS STRONGER THAN EVER AND IS MAKING 
IMPORTANT PROGRESS TOWARD RESOLVING THE VARIOUS 
PROBLEMS IT FACES.  SPEAKING AT AN IMPROMPTU 
PRESS CONVERENCE AFTER A PEP TALK TO THE BLAS 
ROCA CONSTRUCTION CONTINGENT ON SEPTEMBER 30, 
CASTRO DECLARED THAT \"THE SETBACKS WE HAD 
WERE TURNED INTO VICTORIES.\"  HE WAS PARTICULARLY 
INTENT ON PORTRAYING THE \"TRAUMATIC PROCESS\" OF 
CLEANING UP THE INTERIOR MINISTRY (MININT) 
AS MAKING THE ORGANIZATION STRONGER, MORE 
DEDICATED AND MORE EFFICIENT.  MININT IS NOW 
\"DOING A GREAT JOB ...AND WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT 
INSTRUMENT OF THE REVOLUTION.\" 
 
- 
5.  CASTRO ALSO HAS STATED THAT CUBA \"HAS FEWER 
PROBLEMS\" THAN ANY OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRY EXCEPT 
PERHAPS NORTH KOREA.  HE HAS REPEATEDLY EXPRESSED 
DISDAIN FOR THE REFORMS OF THE \"BEGINNER CAPITALISTS\" 
AND \"BOURGEOUIS DEMOCRATS\" IN EASTERN EUROPE 
(I.E., PRO-REFORM SOVIETS, POLES AND HUNGARIANS). 
THE CUBAN MEDIA, TAKING CASTRO\'S CUE, HAVE 
PUBLISHED ARTICLES ALMOST DAILY DEPICTING THE 
CHAOS CAUSED BY THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
REFORMS IN THOSE COUNTRIES.  ON A TYPICAL DAY, 
GRANMA REPORTS ON THE SOVIET UNION\'S NATIONALIST 
AND LABOR STRIFE, POLAND\'S SERIOUS ECONOMIC 
PLIGHT, AND HUNGARY\'S DESTABILIZING SHIFT TOWARD 
A MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM. 
 
- 
6.  CUBA, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS DOING QUITE 
WELL, ACCORDING TO CASTRO.  WHILE REMAINING 
LOYAL TO SOCIALIST PRECEPTS, IT IS \"DOING MORE 
WITH LESS.\"  HAVANA HAS FEWER RESOURCES THAN 
EVER BEFORE AND ONLY HALF THE FOREIGN RESERVES 
IT USED TO HAVE, CASTRO SAID, BUT THE NATION IS 
\"COMPENSATING WITH THE SPIRIT OF WORK.\"  TO COUNTER 
THE IMPRESSION OF CUBA\'S ISOLATION IN THE SOCIALIST 
WORLD, CASTRO AND THE MEDIA HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE 
COUNTRY\'S RELATIONS WITH CLOSE AND HELPFUL 
ALLIES.  THE GOC HAS SENT DELEGATIONS TO EAST 
GERMANY, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, BULGARIA, LIBYA AND 
NORTH KOREA IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS TO FIRM UP 
BILATERAL TIES.  CUBA HAS INVESTED PARTICULAR ENERGY 
IN IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH THE PRC, HAILING 
EVERY DEVELOPMENT (INCLUDING CASTRO\'S ATTENDANCE 
AT THE CHINESE NATIONAL DAY RECEPTION IN HAVANA) 
AS A SIGN OF CLOSER TIES. 
 
- 
7.  AT THE SAME TIME, CASTRO IS PROJECTING OPTIMISM 
IN HIS ABILITY TO COUNTER WHAT THE GOC IS 
BILLING AS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN U.S. 
AGGRESSION AGAINST CUBA:  THE LAUNCHING OF TV 
MARTI.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION AT THE 
SEPTEMBER 30 PRESS CONFERENCE, CASTRO SAID CUBA 
HAD A STRONG FIGHTING SPIRIT AND WAS READY TO 
\"GIVE A GOOD CHUNK OF IT TO THOSE YANKIS.\" 
WHILE SAYING THIS, HE FORMED HIS HANDS INTO A 
SHAPE SUGGESTING A GUN AIMED AT AN IMAGINARY TARGET 
IN THE SKY. 
 
- 
8.  CASTRO HAS EVEN BOASTED ABOUT HIS HEALTH. 
HE ADMITTED THAT LAST SUMMER\'S SCANDALS CAUSED 
HIM GREAT BITTERNESS, BUT HE SAID HE DID NOT 
LET IT OVERCOME HIM.  \"I ACTED WITH EQUANIMITY,\" 
HE SAID, ADDING, \"I AM VERY WELL.  I WORK A LOT 
BUT THIS IS COMPENSATED BY THE SATISFACTION I 
FEEL WHEN I SEE THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE 
EVERYWHERE.\" 
 
- 
9.  COMMENT:  GROUPS LIKE THE BLAS ROCA CONTINGENT, 
A MODEL WORK UNIT THAT ENJOYS PREFERENTIAL 
ACCESS TO HOUSING AND FOOD, ARE AMONG THE 
MOST LIKELY TO ACCEPT CASTRO\'S OPTIMISTIC 
\"MAKE-DO\" ASSESSMENT, AS ARE OTHER WORKERS IN PRIORITY 
INDUSTRIES THAT THE COMANDANTE HAS BEEN VISITING. 
OVERALL, HOWEVER, THE JAWBONING WILL LIKELY 
HAVE LITTLE EFFECT.  THE MESSAGE IS THAT 
DOMESTIC POLICIES WILL REMAIN BASICALLY UNCHANGED 
AND THAT THE COUNTRY WILL SIMPLY TIGHTEN ITS 
BELT.  NEITHER THIS NOR THE NEWS THAT MININT 
WILL NOW BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IN THE 
PAST ARE LIKELY TO INSPIRE JOY.  STILL, CASTRO IS 
TRYING TO MAKE A VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT 
DESPITE SHORTAGES IN CUBA OF FLOUR, GASOLINE, 
MEDICINES, AND MANY OTHER ITEMS, THE PEOPLE 
REMAIN FED AND AT WORK AND THERE IS NO 
INFLATION NOR SOCIAL \"DISINTEGRATION\" AS IN THE 
\"BEGINNING CAPITALIST\" STATES. 
 
- 
10.  CASTRO\'S PUBLIC PUSH ALSO SUGGESTS AN 
EAGERNESS TO REPAIR THE PRESTIGE -- THE 
\"MAGIC HOLD\" HE HAS ENJOYED OVER HIS PEOPLE -- 
THAT APPARENTLY WAS ERODED BY LAST SUMMER\'S 
SCANDALS.

REF:  EVANS/GRANT TELCON 1/2/90 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  WITH THE FALL OF EACH EASTERN EUROPEAN COMMUNIST 
LEADER CASTRO\'S DEFENSE OF SOCIALISM HAS SEEMED TO BECOME 
MORE RIGID.  SHORTLY BEFORE EACH COMMUNIST HEAD LEFT 
OFFICE, CASTRO MADE AN OFFICIAL GESTURE INDICATING 
SOME MEASURE OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS REGIME.  IN ROMANIA\'S 
CASE, THE GOC SIGNED A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CEAUSESCU\'S 
REPS JUST WEEKS BEFORE HIS DEMISE.  AS THESE COMMUNIST 
GOVERNMENTS GO, CASTRO\'S CREED \"SOCIALISM OR DEATH\" 
TAKES ON A MORE OMINOUS MEANING ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING 
THE BLOODLETTING IN ROMANIA. 
 
CUBAN OFFICIALS EXPLAIN THAT FOR CUBA, IF FOR NO 
OTHER NATION, SOCIALISM IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED WITH 
INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY, NATIONAL IDENTITY AND 
NATIONAL CULTURE.  WITHOUT SOCIALISM CUBA, IN OTHER 
WORDS, WOULD BE EITHER OVERTAKEN OR ABSORBED BY THE 
GIANT BOURGEOIS CAPITALIST STATE TO THE NORTH.  THE 
REAL PURPOSE OF THE SLOGAN, OF COURSE, IS TO MAKE AN 
ENEMY OF ANYONE WHO DOES NOT AGREE WITH CASTRO, TO 
PAINT ANY OPPOSITION TO SOCIALISM AS TREASON, AND TO 
BUILD POPULAR SUPPORT FOR INTOLERANCE AND SUPPRESSION 
OF DISSENT. 
 
3.  WE HOPE THE DEPARTMENT, USIA AND OTHER USG AGENCIES 
WILL FIND WAYS TO FOCUS WORLD ATTENTION ON THIS RATHER 
BIZARRE SLOGAN.  \"PATRIA O MUERTE,\" WHICH CASTRO 
ALSO STILL EMPLOYS, RAISES THE IMAGE OF DEFENDING ONES 
COUNTRY AGAINST ALIEN INVADERS.  \"LIBERTY OR DEATH\" 
SUGGESTS A CHOICE BETWEEN TYRANNY AND 
FREEDOM.  BUT \"SOCIALISMO O MUERTE\" SIMPLY SUGGESTS 
A STARK CHOICE BETWEEN ACCEPTING A MARXIST SOCIETY 
OR ELSE DYING.  THIS INTERPRETATION IS REINFORCED 
BY THE CONTEXT AND INDEED THE TARGET OF CASTRO\'S 
SLOGAN, I.E., DECISIONS BY INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES AND 
PEOPLES TO INSTITUTE SWEEPING DEMOCRATIC REFORMS 
THAT HAVE DRASTICALLY ALTERED OR COMPLETELY DISCARDED 
MARXIST-LENINIST SYSTEMS. 
 
4.  WE WOULD HOPE THAT INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS,AND PRIVATE 
AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS WOULD BEGIN TO 
QUESTION THE MANICHEAN CRY OF THE CUBAN LEADER. 
FOLLOWING ARE SOME SAMPLE QUESTIONS THAT COULD BE POSED: 
 
-- DOES \"SOCIALISMO O MUERTE\" MEAN THE CUBAN PEOPLE 
HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT SOCIALISM NOW AND FOR 
ALL TIME? 
 
-- DOES ANY CUBAN HAVE THE RIGHT PEACEFULLY TO ESPOUSE 
ANOTHER POLITICAL-ECONOMIC SYSTEM; CAN HE MAKE SPEECHES, 
PRINT ARTICLES, HAVE MEETINGS, ETC. TO PROMOTE 
AN ALTERNATIVE TO SOCIALISM? 
 
-- CAN A CUBAN WHO IS OPPOSED TO SOCIALISM AND IN FAVOR 
OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY BE A LOYAL CITIZEN? 
 
-- WHAT CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS DOES SUCH A PERSON 
HAVE? 
 
-- IF A SOCIALIST REGIME SUCH AS THAT OF CEAUSESCU 
SEES ITSELF ON THE VERGE OF BEING OVERTHROWN, DOES 
IT HAVE THE RIGHT AND THE DUTY TO USE FORCE AGAINST 
CIVILIAN, UNARMED DEMONSTRATORS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN 
SOCIALISM? 
 
-- DO YOU BELIEVE THAT SOCIALISM REPRESENTS A 
LINEAL PROGRESSION OF HISTORY AND THAT ONCE A COUNTRY 
IS SOCIALIST IT MUST ALWAYS REMAIN SOCIALIST? 
 
-- DO YOU STILL SUPPORT THE WARSAW PACT INVASION 
OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN 1968 AS HISTORICALLY CORRECT? 
 
-- WAS THE 1968 INVASION AN IMPLEMENTATION OF 
\"SOCIALISMO O MUERTE\"? 
 
-- IS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BREZHNEV 
DOCTRINE AND \"SOCIALISMO O MUERTE\"? 
 
-- WOULD YOU PREFER TO SEE CUBA SINK UNDER THE OCEAN 
THAN TO SEE IT BECOME NON-SOCIALIST UNDER A 
POPULAR MOVEMENT? 
 
-- YOU SAY SOCIALISM IS SYNONYMOUS WITH NATIONALISM 
IN NBA.  DOES THIS MEAN THAT MEXICO, PERU AND OTHER 
NON-SOCIALIST LATIN COUNTRIES ARE NOT EQUALLY NATIONALIST 
AS CUBA? 
 
-- WHO HAS DECIDED SOCIALISM IS SYNONYMOUS 
WITH NATIONALISM IN CUBA?  CAN ANY CUBAN OPENLY DISPUTE 
THAT? 
 
-- IF THE UNITED STATES BECAME SOCIALIST (COMMUNIST), 
WOULD IT THEN BE POSSIBLE FOR CUBA TO BECOME NON- 
SOCIALIST?  WOULD THE SLOGAN \"SOCIALISMO O MUERTE\" 
STILL BE VALID? 
 
- 
5.  THESE QUESTIONS COULD BE POSED IN AN OPEN LETTER 
TO CASTRO SUCH AS THE RECENT ONE ON A PLEBISCITE 
SIGNED BY 400 INTELLECTUALS.  OTHER VEHICLES COULD 
INCLUDE:  DISCUSSION PANELS ON RADIO MARTI; STATEMENTS 
BY HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS, AND ARTICLES BY PROMINENT 
INDIVIDUALS AND JOURNALISTS.  WE WOULD ALSO EXPECT 
THAT \"SOCIALISMO B MUERTE\" WOULD MAKE AN INTERESTING 
TOPIC FOR DISCUSSIONS IN GENEVA.

SUBJECT: ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 355397 
 
1.  THIS CABLE RESPONDS TO THE QUESTIONS RAISED IN 
REFTEL. 
 
2.  DESCRIBE ANY HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS 
INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT 
ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: 
 
THE ONLY OSTENSIBLE PROSECUTION OF TERRORIST ACTS IN 
1990 WAS THE JULY 16 TRIAL OF 11 MEMBERS OF A GROUP 
KNOWN AS THE YOUTH ASSOCIATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, 
ACCUSED OF CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS, 
INCLUDING PLANS TO DYNAMITE THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, 
PLANS TO STEAL ARMS BY FORCE FROM A MILITARY UNIT, TO 
PLANT A CAR BOMB AND TO OCCUPY A FOREIGN EMBASSY.  THE 
TRIAL WAS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, BUT WAS NOT ATTENDED BY 
WESTERN OBSERVERS.  NO INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO 
JUDGE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN SUPPORT OF THE 
CHARGES.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS THE TERRORISTS 
WERE FOUND WITH 900 GRAMS OF TNT, ELECTRIC DETONATORS 
AND 7.62 MM SHELLS.  THE GROUP WAS FALSELY ACCUSED OF 
LINKS WITH THE U.S. INTERESTS SECTION IN HAVANA. 
 
3.  DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORIST FOR PROSECUTION? 
 
CUBA DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH REQUEST IN 1990.  HOWEVER, 
IT HAD REQUESTED EXTRADITION OF ORLANDO BOSCH FROM 
VENEZUELA WHILE HE WAS HELD THERE.  ALTHOUGH NO 
EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES EXISTS, THE 
OFFICIAL CUBAN PRESS MADE IT CLEAR THAT CUBA WANTED 
THE UNITED STATES TO RETURN ORLANDO BOSCH TO CUBA TO 
FACE CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE 1976 BOMBING OF A 
CUBANA COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH 
OF ALL ON BOARD. 
 
4.  DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN 
PROSECUTION: 
 
CUBAN PUBLIC STATEMENTS HAVE CONDEMNED THE KILLING OF 
CIVILIANS BY GOVERNMENT AND IRREGULAR FORCES OR DEATH 
SQUADS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, 
NICARAGUA AND COLOMBIA.  THE CONDEMNATION UNIFORMLY 
FOLLOWED POLITICAL LINES.  THAT IS, OFFICIAL 
STATEMENTS CONDEMNED CLAIMED PRE-MEDITATED KILLING OF 
CIVILIANS WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN BY GROUPS OR 
INDIVIDUALS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA. 
THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA DID NOT CONDEMN TERRORIST ACTS 
APPARENTLY COMMITTED BY IRREGULAR FORCES OR 
GOVERNMENTS SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA.  THE 
GOVERNMENT OF CUBA DID NOT MAKE ANY EFFORT TO 
INVESTIGATE OR ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
6.  DESCRIBE MAJOR CONTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN 
IN 1990 BY THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN 
IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
NO MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS WERE UNDERTAKEN. 
CUBA MAINTAINS A LARGE POLICE/STATE SECURITY APPARATUS 
WHICH EFFECTIVELY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM TO PROSPER.  EXTENSIVE SOCIAL CONTROL AND 
STATE INTRUSION INTO NEARLY ALL ASPECTS OF PRIVATE 
LIFE MAKE IT VERY LIKELY THAT NASCENT TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE DISCOVERED OR NECESSARILY REMAIN 
SO SMALL AND INSULAR THAT THEY WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT. 
 
7.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT 
FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, INCLUDING POLITICAL AND 
FINANCIAL  SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT 
THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION, MISUSE OF THE 
DIPLOMATIC POUCH, AND OTHER PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT 
TERRORISM; SANCTUARY EXTENDED TO TERRORISTS OR 
TERRORIST GROUPS AND/OR THE PRESENCE OF OFFICE OF SUCH 
GROUPS; HOST GOVERNMENT TRAINING OR THE PROVISION OF 
TRAINING SITES TO TERRORIST GROUPS; AND POSITIONS 
TAKEN ON TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
THE GOC POLITICALLY SUPPORTS OR SUPPORTED FARABUNDO 
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, THE GUATEMALAN 
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, THE POLITICAL ARM OF THE 
COLOMBIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES, THE FORMER 19TH 
OF APRIL MOVEMENT, THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS, THE 
PALESTINIAN LIBERATION ORGANIZATION.  CUBAN MAINTAINS 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH \"THE STATE OF PALESTINE\", 
AND RECOGNIZES THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS AS A 
NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT.  IT ALSO RECOGNIZED THE 
SOUTHWEST AFRICAN PEOPLES ORGANIZATION (SWAPO) AS A 
NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT BEFORE NAMIBIAN 
INDEPENDENCE.  CUBA SUPPLIED MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO 
SWAPO, THE FMLN, THE M-19, AND PROBABLY THE FARC. 
CUBA IS WIDELY THOUGHT TO CONTINUE ARMS AND OTHER 
MILITARY SUPPORT TO THE FMLN. 
 
8.  HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST SULPORTING COUNTRY ON A 
TERRORISM ISSUE? 
 
CUBA OPENLY SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENTS OF IRAN, IRAQ, 
LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, AND SYRIA.  IT DOES NOT OPENLY 
SUPPORT TERRORISM, WHICH IT DISTINGUISHES, ALONG 
POLITICAL LINES, FROM NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS. 
 
9.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1989, 
POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC. 
WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? 
 
CUBA CONTINUED TO WITHDRAW ITS TROOPS FROM SOUTHERN 
AFRICA ACCORDING TO SCHEDULE.  TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS 
OR NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS SUPPORTED POLITICALLY 
AND PERHAPS MILITARILY BY CUBA HAVE BEEN LESS ACTIVE 
IN 1990 THAN IN 1989, EXCEPT THE FMLN IN EL SALVADOR, 
AND PERHAPS THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY 
UNITY.

CASTRO.  WE FOLLOW THE SPANISH-CUBAN RELATIONSHIP AS 
CLOSELY AS WE CAN FROM HAVANA, AND OUR INFORMATION TRACKS 
WELL WITH THAT IN REFTEL.  WE OFFER A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS 
FROM THE HAVANA PERSPECTIVE. 
 
- 
2.  (C)  MORE THAN MOST, THE SPANIARDS HAVE INDULGED IN 
WISHFUL THINKING ABOUT FIDEL CASTRO.  PERHAPS BECAUSE 
OF HIS GALICIAN ROOTS, PERHAPBSECAUSE OF HIS POWERFUL 
PERSONALITY, PERHAPS BECAUSE OF HIS CAREFULLY CULTIVATED 
ROMANTIC IMAGE AS THE CARIBBEAN DAVID FACING THE NORTH 
AMERICAN GOLIATH, THEY HAVE TENDED TO GIVE HIM THE 
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.  THEY ALSO THOUGHT THEY HAD 
SPECIAL INFLUENCE.  IF THEY EVER DID, THEY NO LONGER 
HAVE.  CASTRO HAS NOW SHOWN THAT HE CAN BE AS DISMISSIVE 
OF FELIPE GONZALEZ AS HE CAN OF ANYONE ELSE WHO OFFERS 
HIM ADVISE HE DOES NOT LIKE. 
 
- 
3.  (C)  THE SPANIARDS -- AND FOR THAT MATTER MOST 
WEST EUROPEANS -- HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RECOGNIZE CASTRO 
FOR WHAT HE IS:  A SOMETIMES CHARMING BUT ALWAYS 
RUTHLESS DICTATOR.  NOW THAT THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO 
RATIONALIZE HIS EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR (SUCH AS THE 
CURRENT CRACKDOWN ON HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS) THEY SEEM 
TO BE MORE LIKELY TO OVERREACT TO IT.  THEY TEND TO 
SEE THE CURRENT SITUATION IN MORE APOCALYPTIC TERMS 
THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE IF THEIR VISION HD NOT BEEN 
CLOUDED BY ROMANTICISM AND WISHFUL THINKING FOR THREE 
DECADES.  MOREOVER, MADRID\'S PESSIMISM PROBABLY ALSO 
REFLECTS THAT OF SPANISH EMBASSY PERSONNEL HERE WHO 
SEEM TO TAKE CASTRO\'S INTRANSIGENCE AS A PERSONAL 
AFFRONT.  THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN DISILLUSIONED BY THE 
RECENT HARDLINE PRONOUNCEMENTS OF PCC IDEOLOGY CHIEF 
CARLOS ALDANA TO WHOM THEY HAD EARLIER IMPUTED THE 
ROLE OF INNER CIRCLE LIBERAL. 
 
- 
4.  (C)  ALL OF THIS IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THE 
CASTRO REGIME IS NOT IN CRISIS.  AND IT IS VERY 
POSSIBLE, EVEN LIKELY THAT CHANGE, WHEN IT COMES, WILL 
BE VIOLENT.  HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THE CUBAN REALITY 
HAS NOT CHANGED AS MUCH AS THE SPANISH PERCEPTION OF IT. 
 
- 
5.  (C)  FINALLY, WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT CASTRO 
WILL BE INVITED TO THE SEVILLE SUMMIT, MWE HAVE SEEN 
PRESS REPORTS IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS QUOTING FELIPE 
GONZALEZ TO THE EFFECT THAT AS LONG AS HE WAS ISSUING 
THE INVITATIONS, CASTRO WOULD GET ONE.  THAT STATEMENT, 
IF ACCURATELY REPORTED WOULD SEEM TO OVERTAKE THE 
SUGGESTION IN PARAGRAPH 11 OF REFTEL THAT THE GOS 
MIGHT USE THE INVITATION FOR LEVERAGE.

CUBAN REGIME HAS PUBLICLY TRIED TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM 
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS IN THE HEMISPHERE.  ENDING 
SUPPORT FOR THE GUERRILLAS IN COLOMBIA WAS SAID TO HAVE 
BEEN A PRE-CONDITION FOR FIDEL CASTRO\'S VISIT TO 
CARTAGENA AUGUST 9-11, AND WAS PART OF THE JUSTIFICATION 
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT GAVE FOR RESTORING DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS WITH HAVANA IN LATE OCTOBER.  AS FOR 
GUATEMALA, THE OTHER COUNTRY MOST AFFECTED BY FORMERLY 
CUBAN-BACKED REBELS, THE OFFICIAL CUBAN PRESS MADE 
GUARDEDLY CONCILIATORY STATEMENTS TOWARD THE PEACE 
PROCESS THERE DURING THE VISIT OF NOBEL LAUREATE 
RIGOBERTA MENCHU TO HAVANA IN EARLY AUGUST. 
 
3.   (U)  RELATIONS WITH TERRORIST STATES.  CUBA HAS 
FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH 
KOREA, AND SYRIA.  ALL THESE COUNTRIES HAVE EMBASSIES IN 
HAVANA, AS DOES CUBA IN EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE 
CAPITALS.  RELATIONS WITH IRAN AND NORTH KOREA ARE 
PARTICULARLY CLOSE AND HIGH PROFILE.  THE PLO IS ALSO 
REPRESENTED HERE AT THE AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL. 
 
4.   (U)  PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON TERRORISM.  THE 
REGIME-CONTROLLED CUBAN PRESS IS CAREFUL TO ESCHEW 
EXPLICIT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS.  NEVERTHELESS THERE 
PERSISTS A SLANT SYMPATHETIC TO \"NATIONAL LIBERATION 
MOVEMENTS\" AND SELF-STYLED MARXIST MOVEMENTS SUCH AS THE 
SHINING PATH.  IN ADDITION THE STRIDENT ANTI-U.S. LINE 
WHICH PERVADES CUBAN NEWS AND COMMENTARY SPILLS OVER 
INTO ATTACKS ON U.S. COUNTERTERROR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS 
THE SANCTIONS ON LIBYA, WHICH THE CUBANS HOLD UP AS AN 
EXAMPLE OF THE WEST\'S \"DOUBLE STANDARD.  AFTER YEARS OF 
ONE-SIDED COVERAGE OF PALESTINIAN ISSUES, THE CUBAN 
PRESS TREATED THE SEPTEMBER PEACE ACCORD RELATIVELY 
OBJECTIVELY. 
 
5.   (U)  HARBORING/TRAINING FOREIGN TERRORISTS.  POST 
IS NOT AWARE OF ANY NEW ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN IN 1993. 
BASQUE TERRORISTS WHO SOUGHT REFUGE HERE SOME YEARS AGO 
REMAIN, BUT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAS ASSURED THE SPANISH 
EMBASSY THAT NO FURTHER ASYLEES WOULD BE ACCEPTED. 
SEVERAL THOUSAND FOREIGN STUDENTS FROM FORMER MARXIST 
REGIMES LIKE SOUTH YEMEN OR NATIONAL LIBERATION 
MOVEMENTS SUCH AS THE POLISARIO OR THE SUDANESE PEOPLE\'S 
LIBERATION MOVEMENT CONTINUE TO ATTEND SPECIAL SCHOOLS 
ON THE ISLE OF YOUTH.  HOWEVER THE MILITARY OR 
PARA-MILITARY COMPONENT OF THESE PROGRAMS APPEARS TO 
HAVE BEEN REDUCED OR LARGELY ELIMINATED, AND THE NUMBERS 
OF STUDENTS HAVE DECLINED, WITH FEW IF ANY NEW ARRIVALS. 
 
6.   (U)  THERE HAVE BEEN NO PROSECUTIONS OR 
EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS MADE PUBLIC IN CUBA IN 1993.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  THE STATUS OF THE RUMORS REGARDING CASTRO\'S HEALTH: 
THE RUMOR HAS SPREAD TO MUCH OF THE HAVANA POPULATION 
AND COMES IN TWO VARIATIONS:  THAT CASTRO HAS AN 
ISCHEMIA OF THE BRAIN AND THE OTHER, THAT THIS WAS 
BROUGHT ON BY AN ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE.  ONE VERSION OF 
THE RUMOR HAS IT THAT CASTRO CANNOT BE MOVED BECAUSE OF 
THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ILLNESS, BUT THAT CIMEQ HOSPITAL 
HAS BEEN PREPARED FOR HIM ONCE HIS CONDITION 
STABILIZES.  (THIS WOULD IN EFFECT RESOLVE THE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUMORS THAT WE HAD HEARD REFS A,B.) 
 
3.  RAUL CASTRO HAS BEEN FEATURED FAR MORE PROMINENTLY 
IN THE CUBAN MEDIA IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, INCLUDING HIS 
SPEECH IN GUANTANAMO OVER THE WEEKEND AND A FRONT PAGE 
PHOTO IN THE APRIL 20 GRANMA, WITH ANOTHER STORY ON THE 
BACKPAGE.  (RAUL SOMETIMES GETS FRONT PAGE COVERAGE, BUT 
IT IS UNUSUAL FOR HIM TO GET SO MUCH ATTENTION IN THE 
SAME EDITION.)  ONE OTHER ODDITY:  IN THE APRIL 20 
\"DOING RADIO\" PROGRAM ON RADIO REBELDE (REF C), MIAMI 
CORRESPONDENT MARCOS CASTELLO NOTES HOW THE EXILE 
COMMUNITY IS TRYING TO \"MAR THE LEGITIMACY\" OF THIS 
WEEKEND\'S DIALOGUE.  AS AN EXAMPLE, HE REPORTED THAT 
THERE WERE REPORTS IN MIAMI THAT THERE WAS \"AN ALLEGED 
PROBLEM\" WITH CASTRO AND THAT \"A HOSPITAL HAS BEEN TAKEN 
OVER.\" 
 
4.  WE HOPE TO HEAR FROM OUR ACTIVIST CONTACTS WITHIN 
THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.

FOR ARA/CCA -- DENNIS HAYS 
 
E.O. 12356:      OADR:DECL 
TAGS:      PGOV, CU 
SUBJECT:   CASTRO\'S HEALTH RUMORS -- FURTHER RUMINATIONS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTLAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  FIDEL CASTRO\'S RECENT TRIPS TO BARBADOS AND SOUTH 
AFRICA, AS WELL AS HIS APPEARANCES DURING THE NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY AND THE DIALOGUE WITH THE EXILE COMMUNITY, BOTH 
OF WHICH WERE TELEVISED, GIVE THE LIE TO RUMORS THAT HE 
IS SUFFERING FROM SOME GRAVE ILLNESS.  NEVERTHELESS, 
RUMORS DO PERSIST THAT HE HAD A MILD CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA. 
ACTIVIST VLADIMIRO ROCA TOLD USINT RECENTLY THAT HE 
BELIEVES THE RUMORS THAT CIRCULATED HERE AROUND 
MID-APRIL WERE NOTHING MORE THAN A DELAYED REACTION TO A 
LEAK IN LATE MARCH- EARLY APRIL THAT CASTRO HAD AN 
ISCHEMIA.  ACCORDING TO ROCA, ISCHEMIAS CAN BE TREATED 
WITH MEDICATION AND BEDREST, WHICH, IN ROCA\'S VIEW, 
WOULD EXPLAIN CASTRO\'S ABSENCE FROM PUBLIC LIFE FOR 
THREE WEEKS DURING THAT TIME FRAME. 
 
3.  RMO DWIGHT BABCOCK TOLD US DURING HIS MAY 11 VISIT 
HERE THAT ISCHEMIAS ARE CAUSED BY LACK OF BLOOD FLOW 
(AND THEREFORE LACK OF OXYGEN) TO A PARTICULAR AREA, 
USUALLY THE BRAIN, HEART OR LEGS.  A CEREBRAL ISHEMIA IS 
CAUSED BY AN OBSTRUCTION AT THE CAROTID JUNCTION AND CAN 
LEAD TO MICROINFARCTS, SMALL AREAS OF DEAD OR DYING 
BRAIN TISSUE CAUSED BY THE LACK OF BLOOD FLOW.  IF 
UNTREATED, THIS CAN LEAD TO VARYING DEGREES OF SENILITY. 
 
4.  TREATMENT CAN BE TO EITHER REMOVE THE OBSTRUCTION IN 
A SIMPLE OPERATION AT THE BASE OF THE NECK OR BY USING 
ANTICOAGULANTS.  DR. BABCOCK NOTED THAT 95 PERCENT OF 
THE PATIENTS WHO HAVE THE ANTICOAGULANT TREATMENT HAVE 
NO PROBLEM, THOUGH 5 PERCENT DO RUN THE RISK OF HAVING A 
STROKE.  THE OPERATION ALSO IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT AND 
WOULD REQUIRE ONLY 3-5 DAYS HOSPITALIZATION.  IN BOTH 
CASES, THE PATIENT WOULD BE ADVISED TO REST 10-30 DAYS 
DURING TREATMENT, THOUGH HE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO CARRY 
OUT SIMPLE ACTIVITIES.  AN OPERATION WOULD LEAVE A SMALL 
ONE-AND-HALF INCH SCAR, BUT ONE WHICH COULD EASILY BE 
COVERED BY A HIGH COLLAR OR MAKEUP. 
 
5.  BABCOCK NOTED THAT EVEN THOUGH THE ISCHEMIA IS 
SUCCESSFULLY TREATED, THERE IS A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY 
THAT WITHIN 2-3 YEARS THE PATIENT COULD HAVE ANOTHER 
ISCHEMIA IN THE SAME AREA.  MOREOVER, THE PATIENT IS 
ALSO AT HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING ISCHEMIAS IN OTHER 
PARTS OF THE BODY (LIKE THE LEG OR HEART).  HOWEVER, 
WITH PROPER TREATMENT (ASPIRIN AND OTHER 
ANTICOAGULANTS), THE PATIENT COULD LIVE SEVERAL MORE 
YEARS -- THE RMO DID NOT WANT TO EVEN HAZARD A GUESS AT 
POSSIBLE LIFE EXPECTANCY. 
 
6.  A FOOTNOTE:  P/E OFF FINALLY SPOKE WITH ACTIVIST 
AIDA VALDES MAY 10 REGARDING HER SOURCE WHO TOLD HER ON 
APRIL 19 THAT CASTRO WAS SERIOUSLY ILL AND BEING TREATED 
IN AN INTENSIVE CARE ROOM SET UP AT THE CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE.  SHE SAID THAT HER SOURCE, CRISTOBAL FAJARDO, 
HAD BEEN RELIABLE IN THE PAST, BUT SHE HAS BEEN UNABLE 
TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT THE RUMOR BECAUSE HE WAS ARRESTED 
SHORTLY AFTER THE RUMORS STARTED CIRCULATING.  VALDES 
SAID THAT FAJARDO HAS BEEN HELD VIRTUALLY INCOMMUNICADO 
AT VILLA MARISTAS FOR THREE WEEKS.  (SHE SAID THAT 
FAJARDO WORKS WITH THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, BUT WE HAVE 
NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY LISTING FOR HIM IN OUR 
RECORDS.) 
 
7.  COMMENT:  IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT CASTRO SUFFERED 
SOME MILD ISCHEMIA IN LATE MARCH.  RUMORS ABOUT THE 
ISCHEMIA MESH WITH ANOTHER RUMOR USINT PRINCIPAL OFFICER 
HAD HEARD FROM A EUROPEAN AMBASSADOR THAT CASTRO HAD HAD 
A SMALL OPERATION AT THE BASE OF THE NECK, QUITE 
PROBABLY TO REMOVE THE OBSTRUCTION.  ANOTHER PART OF 
THIS RUMOR (HAVANA 2693) WAS THAT CASTRO\'S SENSE OF 
BALANCE HAD BEEN AFFECTED, A COMMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE 
SLOW, CAREFUL STEPS BY CASTRO AT THE APRIL 25 AIRPORT 
ARRIVAL CEREMONY FOR THE VISITING ZAMBIAN PRESI 
DENT. 
 
CASTRO DID LOOK TIRED DURING HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES HERE 
IN MID- AND LATE APRIL, THOUGH HE SEEMS TO HAVE 
REBOUNDED WELL FOR HIS EXHAUSTING TRIP TO SOUTH AFRICA. 
WE HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE IF THE RIGORS OF HIS TRAVELS 
AFFECT HIM AFTER HIS RETURN TO CUBA.  END COMMENT.

REF:  HAVANA 5150 
 
1.   CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.   WHY THE CHANGE IN GOC ATTITUDE TOWARD MASSIVE 
EMIGRATION?  FOR YEARS NOW, MOST OBSERVERS HAD JUDGED 
THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT AS UNLIKELY TO STAGE ANOTHER MARIEL 
OR TO OPEN ITS SHORES TO FREE EMIGRATION FOR FEAR OF 
UNLEASHING A SITUATION WHICH IT COULD NOT CONTROL.  WHAT 
HAPPENED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO CHANGE THIS 
SITUATION WAS THAT CUBAN AUTHORITIES WERE GRADUALLY 
LOSING CONTROL, EVEN WHILE SEEKING TO PREVENT ILLEGAL 
EMIGRATION.  THE RATE OF ILLEGAL DEPARTURES BY REFUGEES 
TAKING CUBAN GOVERNMENT BOATS HAS INCREASED 
GEOMETRICALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. 
 
3.   THE SITUATION WAS DRAMATICALLY AGGRAVATED BY THE 
DROWNINGS OF OVER THIRTY FLEEING CUBANS ON JULY 13 IN 
THE TUGBOAT SUNK BY THE ACTIONS OF OTHER TUGBOATS.  THE 
NEGATIVE INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION AND DOMESTIC DISCONTENT 
WHICH THIS INCIDENT PRODUCED ADDED GREATLY TO GOVERNMENT 
PRESSURES BY MAKING VIOLENT EFFORTS TO DETER BOAT THEFTS 
UNPALATABLE.  THE APPARENT USE OF WEAPONS TO SEIZE 
HIGHLY VISIBLE HAVANA HARBOR FERRIES WAS A MAJOR 
IRRITANT AND THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT BECAME CONVINCED THAT 
THE USG WOULD NOT ACT SERIOUSLY TO PUNISH ANY 
PERPETRATORS.  THE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC ANXIOUSNESS TO FLEE 
THE ISLAND PRODUCED BY THESE FERRY FLIGHTS LED ON AUGUST 
5 TO HUGE CROWDS WHICH SOON TURNED FROM THOUGHTS OF 
FLIGHT TO ANTIGOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS AND LOOTING. 
 
4.   THE GOVERNMENT THUS WAS INCREASINGLY FACING A 
SITUATION IN WHICH IT FEARED LOSING CONTROL, EVEN AS IT 
SOUGHT TO PREVENT EMIGRATION.  IT IS IN THIS LIGHT THAT 
FIDEL CASTRO\'S DECISION TO THREATEN TO UNLEASH MASSIVE 
REFUGEE FLIGHT UPON THE U.S. CAN BE UNDERSTOOD.  WE 
BELIEVE THAT SUCH A DECISION COULD STIMULATE DEPARTURE 
EFFORTS BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, EVEN THOUGH PRIVATELY 
HELD VESSELS ARE RARE.  CUBA WOULD INDEED BE TAKING A 
SERIOUS RISK IN OPENING ITS BORDERS -- PROBABLY EVEN A 
GREATER ONE THAN IT REALIZES, BUT CUBAN AUTHORITIES 
ALREADY FELT THEMSELVES RUNNING GROWING RISKS.  BY 
MAKING THE THREAT AND PERHAPS IMPLEMENTING IT, THEY HOPE 
TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE U.S. TO ALTER ITS IMMIGRATION 
POLICY IN WAYS WHICH WOULD DIMINISH THE PRESSURES ON 
CUBAN AUTHORITIES.

REF:  STATE 286744 
 
1.  AS REQUESTED, BELOW ARE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS 
LISTED IN REFTEL PARA 3: 
 
(A)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING 
     INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT 
     DURING 1994.  THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED 
     DIPLOMATIC NOTES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN FEBRUARY 
     AND MAY 1994 PROTESTING THE ALLEGED \"IMPUNITY\" WITH 
     WHICH ANTI-CUBA TERRORIST GROUPS ARE PERMITTED TO 
     OPERATE IN U.S. TERRITORY. 
 
(B)  POST HAS NO INFORMATION REGARDING ANY EXTRADITION, 
     OR REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION, TO CUBA OF SUSPECTED 
     TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
(C)  CLOSE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN CUBA AND OTHER 
     COUNTRIES WHICH SPONSOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
     COULD IMPEDE CUBAN GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR 
     EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
(D)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER CUBAN GOVERNMENT 
     ACTIONS TO CONDEMN OR INVESTIGATE TERRORIST ACTS. 
(E)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM 
     EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1994 BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
(F)  CUBAN GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
     TERRORISM HAS DECLINED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL 
     YEARS.  THE EVER DEEPENING ECONOMIC CRISIS FACING 
     CUBA HAS REDUCED THE RESOURCES PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE 
     TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  AT 
     THE SAME TIME, THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORT TO WIN 
     BOTH INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SUPPORT AND FOREIGN 
     INVESTMENT HAS RESULTED IN DIMINISHED SUPPORT FOR 
     INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  CUBA, HOWEVER, CONTINUES 
     TO MAINTAIN STRONG DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH IRAN, IRAQ, 
     LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, AND SYRIA.  BEYOND THE GROUP OF 
     BASQUE TERRORISTS WHO SOUGHT REFUGE IN CUBA SEVERAL 
     YEARS AGO, POST HAS NO NEW INFORMATION REGARDING 
     TERRORISTS HARBORED IN CUBA. 
 
(G)  THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PRESS IS CAREFUL TO AVOID 
     ANY EXPLICIT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. 
 
(H)  POST SEES NO CHANGE FROM 1993 IN THE CUBAN 
     GOVERNMENT POSITION REGARDING TERRORISM.

FIDEL CELEBRATES AMID CHILDREN 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  (U) THE MAIN PUBLIC CELEBRATION WAS HELD IN THE 
NEWLY-RESTORED PALACE OF THE JOSE MARTI PIONEERS, THE 
CUBAN GOVERNMENT MASS ORGANIZATI0N FOR CHILDREN UNDER 
FIFTEEN.  THE PALACE IS LOCATED IN A PARK OUTSIDE 
HAVANA, WHICH MEANT MANY HAVANA RESIDENTS WERE UNABLE T0 
ATTEND DUE TO LACK OF TRANSP0RTATION.  HOWEVER, THE 
CUBAN GOVERNMENT PROVIDED DOZENS 0F BUSES T0 TRANSP0RT 
CHILDREN TO THE FACILITY (F0R TWENTY CENTAVOS) FR0M ALL 
HAVANAS MUNICIPALITIES.  P0L/EC0N 0FFICERS WH0 ATTENDED 
THE CELEBRATION FOUND A CROWD 0F SEVERAL THOUSAND 
CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF CHILDREN ACCOMPANIED BY A PARENT. 
 
4.  (U) WITH CAMERAS EVERYWHERE, FIDEL TOURED THE PALACE 
FLANKED BY CHILDREN, LISTENING T0 ADULT INSTRUCTORS 
EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS FACILITIES:  A MUSEUM, GAME R00M, 
COMPUTER ROOM, ELECTRICAL ASSEMBLY ROOM, EVEN A SMALL 
BAKERY AND LOW-ALCOHOL BEER BREWERY.  B0TH FIDEL AND A 
YOUNG PIONEER PAID TRIBUTE T0 THE EFF0RT 0F 
RECENTLY-DECEASED GENERAL SENEN CASAS REGUEIR0 IN THE 
PALACES RESTORATION.  FIDEL SPENT ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE 
MINUTES IN AN OPEN-AIR C0URTYARD IN THE PALACE WHERE 
YOUNG PIONEERS MADE A PRESENTATI0N AND SANG \"HAPPY 
BIRTHDAY,\" AFTER WHICH CASTR0 BRIEFLY ADDRESSED THEM. 
 
5.  (U) THE PIONEERS PRESENTED CASTRO A STAR-SHAPED 
CAKE;  HE MANAGED TO BL0W 0UT M0ST BUT N0T ALL THE 
CANDLES WITH ONE BREATH.  A NUMBER 0F OFFICIALS 
ACCOMPANIED CASTRO, INCLUDING BROTHER HAUL (IN CIVILIAN 
DRESS), VICE PRESIDENT CARL0S LACE, HAVANA CITY 
HISTORIAN EUSEBI0 LEAL, FEDERATION 0F CUBAN WOMEN 
PRESIDENT VILMA ESPIN, HAVANA CITY C0MMUNIST PARTY CHIEF 
ESTEBAN LAZO, COMMUNIST Y0UTH UNI0N (UJC) FIRST 
SECRETARY VICTORIA VELAZQUEZ AND MINISTER OF SCIENCE, 
TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT ROSA ELENA SIMEON.  FORMER 
OLYMPIC BOXING GOLD MEDALIST TE0FILO STEVENSON CARRIED 
HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER IN TO HEAR FIDEL SPEAK. 
 
6.  (U) AFTERWARD, FIDEL GAVE AN EXTENDED INTERVIEW TO 
SEVERAL CUBAN FEMALE JOURNALISTS WHO L0BBED QUESTIONS 
THAT FURNISHED CASTRO AN 0PP0RTUNITY T0 REFLECT 0N HIS 
HUMBLE YOUTH, HIS DAILY R0UTINES AND THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF 
THE CUBAN REVOLUTION.  IN RESPONSE TO AN EXCLAMATION 
THAT HE MUST BE DROWNING IN WORK, CASTRO REPLIED THAT 
\"NOW I DO NOT HAVE S0 MUCH WORK,\" REFERRING TO THE 
WELL-PREPARED CADRES AND GREATER INSTITUTIONALIZATION 
OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT. 
 
7.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT-CONTR0LLED MEDIA HAD BEGUN T0 
FOCUS 0N THE EVENT SEVERAL DAYS BEFOREHAND.  NEWSPAPERS 
RAN ARTICLES ON EVERY IMAGINABLE ASPECT OF FIDEL\'S 
LIFE:  HIS YOUTH, HIS B0YH00D H0ME, HIS UNIVERSITY DAYS, 
THE SIERRA MAESTRA, THE REV0LUTI0NS EARLY DAYS.  THE 
FRONT PAGE OF THE AUGUST 13 EDITI0N 0F THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY NEWSPAPER \"GRANMA\" CARRIED A P0EM IN HON0R 0F 
FIDELS BIRTHDAY CALLED \"TIME D0ES N0T DEVOUR REDEEMERS\" 
BY JESUS ORTA RUIZ, THE REGIME\'S CURRENT POET LAUREATE. 
THE AUGUST 13 EVENING NEWS SPENT OVER HALF THE BROADCAST 
ON THE CELEBRATION.  THE NEWS HAS F0LL0WED BY EXTENDED 
EXCERPTS FROM FIDEL\'S POST-BIRTHDAY PRESS CONFERENCE AND 
A DOCUMENTARY ON FIDEL\'S LIFE CALLED \"ANGEL\'S SON\" 
(REFERRING TO FIDEL\'S FATHER\'S FIRST NAME).  THE NEXT 
DAY, \"GRANMA\'S\" FRONT PAGE FEATURED A LARGE PH0T0 OF 
FIDEL BLOWING OUT THE CANDLES 0N HIS CAKE; INSIDE HAS 
ANOTHER PHOTO SPREAD OF THE CELEBRATI0N. 
 
CULT OF PERSONALITY? WHAT CULT OF PERSONALITY? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
8.  (U) DESPITE THE MEDIA ATTENTION, THE OFFICIAL LINE 
FOCUSED ON A DISINGENOUSLY-MODEST FIDEL FROWNING ON 
ANYTHING THAT SMACKED OF A CULT OF PERSONALITY, BUT 
SIMPLY UNABLE TO RESTRAIN AN ADORING PUBLIC.  IN A JULY 
20 SPEECH TO THE PIONEERS, CASTRO MUSED ABOUT HIS 
UPCOMING BIRTHDAY:  \"REALLY WE HAVE NEVER CELEBRATED 
BIRTHDAYS, THEY HAVE ALWAYS PASSED DISCREETLY, NOT EVEN 
MENTIONED IN THE NEWSPAPERS.  ONLY RECENTLY SOME HAVE 
TAKEN THE LIBERTY...OF REMEMBERING SOME OF OUR 
BIRTHDAYS;  BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS RESISTED EVERYTHING THAT 
COULD BE AN OFFICIAL CELEBRATION;  NOR WILL THERE BE ONE 
THIS TIME.\"  BUT THE CELEBRATION HAD ALREADY BEEN 
SCHEDULED, RIGHT DOWN TO LOCATION AND TIME:  THE JUNE 23 
EDITION OF THE COMMUNIST YOUTH UNION (UJC) NEWSPAPER 
\"JUVENTUD REBELDE\" ANNOUNCED A \"TRIBUTE TO THE COMMANDER 
IN CHIEF FOR HIS SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY\" AT 10:00 AM IN THE 
PIONEER PALACE. 
 
9.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA DUTIFULLY PLAYED 
ITS ASSIGNED ROLE.  THE AUGUST 11 EDITION OF \"JUVENTUD 
REBELDE\" DECLARED ALMOST APOLOGETICALLY \"TODAY WE WANT 
TO TAKE LICENSE...WE KNOW THAT FIDEL WOULD PREFER 
ANONYMITY, BUT IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR...TO DEPRIVE 
OURSELVES OF THE JOY OF CELEBRATING HIS SEVENTIETH 
BIRTHDAY.\"  EVEN AS THE HOOPLA REACHED A MIND-NUMBING 
CRESCENDO, FIDEL INSISTED TO A REPORTER ON AUGUST 12: 
\"MY BIRTHDAY HAS NO IMPORTANCE...SOMETIMES, THINGS ARE 
BEYOND OUR CONTROL BECAUSE WE CANNOT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM 
DOING CERTAIN THINGS.  I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO DISCOURAGE 
IT...THEY WENT AHEAD AND DID IT.  NEWSPAPERS HAVE 
PUBLISHED A FEW THINGS ON THEIR OWN.\"  INTERVIEWED AFTER 
THE PALACE CELEBRATION, FIDEL REMINDED REPORTERS HE 
\"FOUGHT\" AGAINST A CULT OF PERSONALITY, GOING SO FAR AS 
TO PROHIBIT OFFICIAL PORTRAITS OF ANY GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS. 
 
A FOCUS ON FIDEL\'S AGE, PHYSICAL SAFETY 
--------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (U) THERE WAS PALPABLE OFFICIAL NERVOUSNESS OVER 
FIDELS AGE.  ORTA RUIZS AUGUST 13 FRONT-PAGE PAEAN 
PROCLAIMED CASTROS ENEMIES \"WANT TIME TO CONDEMN YOU TO 
DEATH...THEY COUNT YOUR HOURS, IT ENCOURAGES THEM TO SEE 
YOUR WHITE BEARD...YOUR GRAY HAIR DELIGHTS THEM.\"  IN AN 
AUGUST 12 INTERVIEW, CASTRO ANSWERED A NUMBER OF 
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS HEALTH, INCLUDING HIS DIET, WEIGHT 
AND EXERCISE.  FIDEL ASSURED THE REPORTER HE WAS IN GOOD 
HEALTH, ADDING \"I DO NOT KNOW WHY PEOPLE PAY SO MUCH 
ATTENTION TO OUR HEALTH.  THIS REVOLUTION HAS BEEN MADE.\" 
 
11.  (U) IN ADDITION TO AGE, PART OF THE BIRTHDAY HYPE 
FOCUSED ON CASTROS PHYSICAL SAFETY.  THE AUGUST 11 
EDITION OF \"JUVENTUD REBELDE\" CARRIED A FULL-PAGE 
ARTICLE FEATURING INTERVIEWS WITH THREE 0F CASTR0S 
PERSONAL MINISTRY OF INTERI0R B0DYGUARDS.  FOLL0WING THE 
AUGUST 13 EVENING NEWS, A BRIEF DOCUMENTARY ENTITLED 
\"BRAVE AND LOYAL\" RECALLED FIDELS BODYGUARDS 0VER THE 
YEARS. 
 
12.  (C) COMMENT:  DESPITE THE OFFICIALLY-FESTIVE AIR, 
THE UNDERLYING MOOD HAS WISTFUL, LOOKING BACK T0 PAST 
EVENTS, NOT TO THE FUTURE.  N0TWITHSTANDING OFFICIAL 
DENIALS OF A CULT OF PERS0NALITY, THE C0NTINUING 
OBSESSI0N WITH THE PERSON 0F FIDEL CASTR0 STRONGLY 
SUGGESTS THE DEGREE TO WHICH REGIME SUPPORTERS BELIEVE 
THAT THE FATE OF FIDEL AND THE REV0LUTI0N ARE 
INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED.  THE CELEBRATI0N 0F HIS 
SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN MAY ALS0 HAVE 
BEEN INTENDED TO SHOW HOW THE REV0LUTIONARY TORCH HAS 
BEEN PASSED AND ACCEPTED BY Y0UNGER GENERATIONS.  THE 
1994 RAFTER CRISIS WOUNDED THE REVOLUTIONS IMAGE BY 
SHOWING THE DISAFFECTION OF THE TWENTYSOMETHING 
GENERATION, THE FIRST GENERATION BORN AND EDUCATED UNDER 
THE REVOLUTION. 
 
13. (C) FIDEL SEEMS -- IN HIS WALK, GESTURES, ETC. -- 
OLDER THAN HIS SEVENTY YEARS.  YOUNGER BROTHER HAUL 
EASILY OUTWITTED HIM IN A CHILDRENS GAME PLAYED DURING 
THE BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION IN WHICH EACH COMPETED TO LIST 
ITEMS BEGINNING WITH THE LETTER \"M\":  FIDEL STUMBLED 
AFTER PROFERRING \"WOMEN\" (MUJERES) AND \"MACEISTAS\" 
(INDEPENDENCE FIGHTERS).  THESE LAPSES NOTWITHSTANDING,

REASONS 1.5 (D). 
 
1.  (C)  IN AN EFFORT TO DEFINITIVELY LAY TO REST RECENT 
RUMORS ABOUT THE DEATH OF FIDEL CASTRO, USINT OFFERS SOME 
ITEMS THAT MAY HELP DISPEL THE ALLEGATIONS. 
 
 
CONG. CAMPBELL:  FIDEL CASTRO APPEARED FIT 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C)  FIDEL CASTRO WAS PRESENT FOR SOME TWO HOURS AT 
AN AUGUST 29 RECEPTION IN HONOR OF A U.S. GROUP ON A 
PRIVATE TRIP TO CUBA.  THE GROUP INCLUDED CONGRESSMEN TOM 
CAMPBELL (R-CA) AND MARSHALL SANFORD (R-SC).  CAMPBELL 
MADE A POINT OF DEBRIEFING PRINCIPAL OFFICER THE 
FOLLOWING MORNING. IN DESCRIBING CASTROS APPEARANCE 
DURING THE RECEPTION, CAMPBELL AND HIS WIFE SAID THEIR 
GENERAL IMPRESSION WAS THAT CASTRO SEEMED TO BE FIT FOR A 
71-YEAR-OLD.  CASTRO MOVED AND SPOKE SOMEWHAT CAUTIOUSLY, 
SAID CAMPBELL, BUT NOT UNUSUALLY SO FOR HIS AGE. 
DESCRIBING CASTRO, THE CAMPBELLS USED PHRASES LIKE 
\"CASTRO LOOKED TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH FOR A MAN OF HIS 
AGE,\" \"DID NOT HAVE A PAUNCH,\" \"WAS INITIALLY CAUTIOUS IN 
WHAT HE SAID, BUT WARMED UP LATER,\" \"HIS EYES FOCUSED 
WELL,\" AND \"HE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY, BUT MOVED 
AROUND FINE.\"  CAMPBELL NOTED THAT CASTRO STOOD 
THROUGHOUT THE TWO HOURS THAT THEY OBSERVED HIM DURING 
THE RECEPTION AND MENTIONED THAT CASTRO CONFESSED TO 
HAVING GIVEN UP DRINKING AS WELL AS COMMENTING ON THE 
HARMFUL EFFECTS OF SMOKING.  THESE COMMENTS OCCURRED IN 
THE COURSE OF A CONVERSATION WITH A U.S. NUTRITIONIST WHO 
WAS PART OF THE SAME GROUP.  CASTRO SAID HE HAS ON 
DOCTORS ADVICE LOST WEIGHT AND EXERCISES \"SOME,\" EATS 
YOGURT AND HAS QUIT DRINKING AS WELL AS SMOKING, AND 
FEELS GOOD.  HE DRANK ORANGE JUICE DURING THE RECEPTION. 
CAMPBELL ADDED THAT CASTRO AGREED TO END THE RECEPTION 
WITH A PRAYER.  REV. SUAREZ, OF THE CUBAN COUNCIL OF 
CHURCHES AND A MEMBER OF THE CUBAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
(ANPP) BEGAN WITH THE WELL-KNOWN \"BLESSED ARE THE 
PEACEMAKERS...\" WHICH CASTRO FINISHED FOR HIM \"...FOR 
THEY SHALL BE CALLED THE CHILDREN OF GOD.\" 
 
3.  (C)  THE CAMPBELLS SAID THAT CASTRO WAS VERY SERIOUS 
DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF 
THEIR GROUP HAD WITH HIM.  THE CONVERSATION RANGED 
WIDELY, WITH CASTRO TAKING AN INTEREST IN VIRTUALLY EVERY 
TOPIC.  CASTRO SPOKE ABOUT AIDS AND THE HIGH COST OF 
TREATING THE DISEASE; ABOUT THE \"EL NINO\" WEATHER 
PHENOMENON; WAS ATTENTIVE BUT REMAINED SILENT WHEN THE 
BENEFITS OF ALLOWING ACCESS TO THE INTERNET WERE 
MENTIONED; SPOKE IN PASSING OF THE NEED TO BE VIGILANT 
AGAINST CORRUPTION; AND WAS \"EFFUSIVE\" IN PRAISING 
EFFORTS BY SOME IN CONGRESS TO EXEMPT FOOD AND MEDICINE 
FROM THE EMBARGO.  DURING THE CONVERSATION, CASTRO 
RETURNED A COUPLE OF TIMES TO PRAISING THE CHINESE MODEL 
OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH POLITICAL STABILITY AND SEEMED 
UNWILLING TO CRITICIZE CHINA.  HE DID CRITICIZE RUSSIA, 
BUT SPOKE IN SOME DEPTH ON THESE MATTERS WITH MRS. 
CAMPBELL WHO RUNS A PROJECT IN RUSSIA PROMOTING FREE- 
MARKET PROCESSES. 
 
4.  (C)  COMMENT:  CONGRESSMAN AND MRS. CAMPBELLS 
DESCRIPTION OF CASTRO AT THE AUGUST 28 RECEPTION IS ABOUT 
AS GOOD A FIRST-HAND ACCOUNT OF CASTRO AND HIS CURRENT 
STATE OF HEALTH AS ONE COULD HOPE FOR, SHORT OF A 
DOCTORS EXAMINATION.  EARLIER THAT DAY, A USINT OFFICER 
SPOTTED CASTRO SITTING IN THE BACK OF HIS OFFICIAL CAR 
DRIVING ALONG THE MALECON AND CASTRO WAS RELIABLY 
REPORTED TO HAVE ATTENDED THE RECENT INDONESIAN NATIONAL 
DAY RECEPTION AFTER THE OTHER GUESTS, INCLUDING PRINCIPAL 
OFFICER, HAD DEPARTED.  CLEARLY, CASTRO IS MOBILE, ALERT 
AND ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC, UP CLOSE AND 
PERSONAL. 
 
5.  (C)  CONGRESSMAN CAMPBELL HAS NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO CLEAR THE FOREGOING ACCOUNT.

SUBJECT:  CASTRO SPEAKS ON REVOLUTION\'S 40TH BIRTHDAY 
 
REF:  FBIS 301938Z DEC 98 
 
(U)  CLASSIFIED BY MICHAEL G. KOZAK, PRINCIPAL 
OFFICER, FOR REASON 1.5 (D) 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IN A RELATIVELY SHORT JANUARY 1 
SPEECH, FIDEL CASTRO RECALLED THE HEROIC MOMENTS OF 
HIS REVOLUTIONS TRIUMPH 40 YEARS AGO AND WARNED OF 
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS HE SAID WAS INEVITABLE. 
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, CASTRO SPOKE TO CUBAS YOUTH, 
TELLING THEM THAT CUBAS REVOLUTION \"HAS JUST BEGUN\", 
AND REMINDING THEM THAT \"GLORIOUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS\" 
AWAIT THEM, TOO.  CASTROS CHICKEN LITTLE SCENARIO 
FOR WORLD FINANCES AND HIS TOTAL AVOIDANCE OF THE 
CUBAN PEOPLES REAL PERSONAL CRISES GIVE NO EVIDENCE 
OF A PLAN FOR RESCUING CUBA FROM THE ECONOMIC AND 
OTHER CRISES IT FINDS ITSELF IN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  CASTROS SPEECH, PRINTED IN ITS ENTIRETY IN 
THE JANUARY 4 EDITION OF THE WEEKLY \"TRABAJADORES\", 
TOOK PLACE IN SANTIAGO DE CUBAS CESPEDES PARK. 
CASTRO SPENT THE FIRST THIRD OF HIS SPEECH RECALLING 
THE SACRIFICES AND HEROISM OF THE GUERRILLAS WHO 
HELPED WIN THE FIRST BATTLES OF THE REVOLUTION IN 
SEVERAL EASTERN CUBA TOWNS.  FIDEL CALLED CAMILO 
CIENFUEGOS AND CHE GUEVARA \"MEN OF IRON\", AND 
ENCOURAGED CUBAN YOUTH TO READ CHES WAR NARRATIVE 
\"PASAJES DE LA GUERRA REVOLUCIONARIA.\"  CASTRO NOTED 
THAT THE ONLY OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE THE REVOLUTION 
RECEIVED WERE 150 SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLES SENT BY THE 
VENEZUELAN ADMIRAL LARRAZABAL.  OTHERWISE, SAID 
FIDEL, \"MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE ARMS AND 
MUNITIONS WITH WHICH WE MADE AND WON THE WAR WERE 
TAKEN FROM THE ENEMY IN COMBAT.\" 
 
3.  (U)  TRANSITIONING FROM THE BATTLEFIELD TO 
PRESENT-DAY CUBA, CASTRO SAID \"FOR THE NEWER 
GENERATIONS, THE REVOLUTION HAS JUST BEGUN.\"  CASTRO 
NOTED THAT THOSE PRESENT WERE NOT THE SAME AS THOSE 
CUBANS PRESENT AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTIONS 
TRIUMPH.  CASTRO ADDED THAT HE HIMSELF WAS \"NOT 
EXACTLY THE SAME MAN\" THAT HE WAS FORTY YEARS AGO. 
\"HE IS ONLY SOMEONE MUCH YOUNGER, WHO HAS THE SAME 
NAME, WHO DRESSES THE SAME, WHO THINKS THE SAME, WHO 
DREAMS THE SAME.\" 
 
4.  (U)  COMPARING DEMOGRAPHICS OF 1959 CUBA TO 1999 
CUBA, CASTRO SAID OF THE ROUGHLY 11 MILLION CUBANS IN 
CUBA TODAY, 7.2 MILLION WERE BORN AFTER THE TRIUMPH 
OF THE REVOLUTION, AND ANOTHER 1.35 MILLION WERE LESS 
THAN TEN YEARS OLD.  HE CLAIMED THAT \"THIRTY PERCENT\" 
OF CUBANS IN 1959 COULD NOT READ, AND \"SIXTY PERCENT\" 
HAD NOT COMPLETED SIXTH GRADE.  NOW, SAID CASTRO, 
TEACHERS AND PROFESSORS IN CUBA NUMBER 250,000; 
THERE ARE 64,000 DOCTORS, AND 600,000 UNIVERSITY 
GRADUATES.  \"AN ILLITERATE PERSON DOES NOT EXIST, AND 
IT IS EXTREMELY RARE THAT SOMEONE NOT HAVE A SIXTH 
GRADE EDUCATION.\"  IN SUM, CASTRO SAID THE \"HEROIC\" 
CUBAN PEOPLES MOST GLORIOUS AND REVOLUTIONARY EPOCH 
HAS BEEN THE STILL-ONGOING \"SPECIAL PERIOD\", \"AS WE 
REMAIN ABSOLUTELY ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEST, 90 
MILES AWAY FROM THE UNITED STATES, AND WE HAVE 
DECIDED TO KEEP GOING FORWARD.\" 
 
5.  (U)  CASTRO DEVOTED ALMOST THE ENTIRE REMAINDER 
OF HIS SPEECH, ROUGHLY SIXTY PERCENT, WARNING 
LISTENERS THAT THE CURRENT ECON0MIC SYSTEM IS 
\"UNSUSTAINABLE\", THAT \"THE ECON0MIC ORDER THAT 
PREVAILS TODAY ON THE PLANET WILL INEVITABLY FALL\", 
AND THAT \"MARKET THEOLOGY IS SECTARIAN, 
FUNDAMENTALIST, AND ANTIECUMENICAL.\" 
 
6.  (U)  USING INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC, CASTRO 
DISCUSSED THE \"WOLVES\" WHO SPECULATE IN FOREIGN 
CURRENCIES, CREDITING GEORGE SOROS WITH \"BRINGING 
GREAT BRITAIN TO ITS KNEES\" THROUGH SPECULATION IN 
THE BRITISH POUND.  THE CUBAN LEADER ALSO SAID \"THE 
WHOLE WORLD IS TALKING ABOUT AN INTERNATIONAL 
FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVENT FOUND OUT 
ABOUT IT ARE THE AMERICANS:  THEY HAVE SPENT MORE 
THAN EVER, AND THEIR SAVINGS ARE LESS THAN ZERO.\" 
 
7.  (U)  CASTRO DESCRIBED TO THE SANTIAGO CROWD A 
WORLD IN WHICH COMPLEX FINANCIAL STRUCTURES HAD 
GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL, COMPARING THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL 
SYSTEM TO A HUMAN BODY INFECTED WITH AIDS.  FIDEL 
SAID THE WORLD HAD TURNED INTO \"ONE BIG CASINO\" WHERE 
\"CURRENCY SPECULATION\" AND TRADING IN 
DERIVATIVES--EVEN \"EMPLOYING COMPUTERS\" TO MAKE 
\"SOPHISTICATED CALCULATIONS\"--HAD BECOME 
COMMONPLACE.  CASTRO CITED THE COLLAPSE OF THE LONG 
TERM CAPITAL FUND IN WHICH \"TWO NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS 
IN ECONOMY AND SOME OF THE BEST PROGRAMMERS IN THE 
WORLD\" COMBINED TO BRING THE FUND TO THE VERGE OF 
FINANCIAL COLLAPSE, THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH WERE 
\"INCALCULABLE.\" 
 
8.  (C)  ALSO NOTEWORTHY IN CASTROS REMARKS WAS HIS 
CALL FOR THE THIRD WORLDS (PRESUMABLY INCLUDING 
CUBA) PROBLEMS TO BE RESOLVED FROM OUTSIDE.  \"THERE 
ISNT THE MOST MINIMAL IDEA OF HOW TO RESOLVE THE 
THIRD WORLDS PROBLEMS.\"  \"WHERE ARE THE CONSUMERS OF 
THE THIRD WORLDS PRODUCTS?\"  CASTRO SAID THE 
UNITED NATIONS, PROVIDED IT \"PUTS AN END TO THE 
DICTATORSHIP OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL\", COULD HELP 
PROGRAM WORLD DEVELOPMENT.  CERTAINLY, SAID CASTRO, 
THAT RESPONSIBILITY CANNOT BE \"IN THE HANDS OF 
MULTINATIONALS AND IN THE BLIND AND CHAOTIC LAWS OF 
THE MARKET.\"  CASTRO ADDED THAT THE AUTHORITY OF THE 
U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY SHOULD BE BROADENED. 
 
9.  (C)  COMMENT:  CASTROS SPEECH IS TYPICAL IN ITS 
FOCUS ON TWO CURRENT THEMES: THE \"MILITARY MIRACLE\" 
OF HIS REVOLUTIONS OVERTHROW OF THE BATISTA 
GOVERNMENT, AND THE \"INEVITABLE\" GLOBAL FINANCIAL 
COLLAPSE BROUGHT ON BY UNBRIDLED FREEDOM OF THE 
GLOBAL CAPITALIST SYSTEM.  WITH LITTLE TO OFFER IN 
DOMESTIC ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, CASTRO (AGAIN) 
CONCENTRATED HIS REMARKS ON THE CERTAINTY OF THE PAST 
AND PLAYED ON FEARS OF A WORLD ECONOMIC CRISIS TO 
VINDICATE THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS OWN INSISTENCE ON 
RETAINING A SOVIET STYLE COMMAND ECONOMY.  HIS 
REMARKS COMMEMORATING THE REVOLUTIONS 40TH 
ANNIVERSARY GIVE LITTLE ROOM FOR HOPE THAT HE IS 
PREPARING FOR ADDITIONAL MARKET ORIENTED REFORMS. 
APPARENTLY WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE CUBAN 
ECONOMY AGAIN REACHES THE SORT OF DIRE SITUATION IT 
FACED IN 1994 BEFORE CASTRO AND HIS REACTIONARY 
COLLEAGUES WILL BE FORCED TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE 
NEED FOR REFORM.  NOTE:  FOR ANOTHER RECENT EXAMPLE 
OF GOC SPEECHMAKING REMOVED FROM REALITY, SEE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO ALARCONS SPEECH 
ENDING THE ASSEMBLYS MOST RECENT SESSION (REFTEL).

     D)HAVANA 4110   E)HAVANA 4186 
 
RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO REF A, BEGINNING WITH THE QUESTION 
IN PARAGRAPH C. 
 
C) POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY JUDICIAL RESPONSE IN THE GLOBAL 
FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AFTER THE TERRORIST ACTS OF 9/11. 
ON DOMESTIC TERRORISM ISSUES, THREE GUATEMALANS ACCUSED OF 
PLANNING A BOMBING CAMPAIGN TO DESTABILIZE THE CASTRO 
GOVERNMENT WERE FINALLY BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND SENTENCED IN 
NOVEMBER.  THEY HAD BEEN IN DETENTION SINCE 1998. 
SPECULATION IS THAT CUBA DECIDED TO TRY THE THREE IN THE 
WAKE OF THE 9/11 ATTACKS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW CUBA HAS ALSO 
BEEN A VICTIM OF TERRORISM. 
 
D) IN 2001, THE GOC DID NOT REQUEST THE EXTRADITION TO CUBA 
OF ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS, NOR THE USG REQUESTED THE 
EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FROM CUBA FOR 
PROSECUTION IN THE U.S.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE U.S.-CUBA 
EXTRADITION TREATY WAS SUSPENDED FOLLOWING THE BREAK IN 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS IN 1961.  HOWEVER, DURING A 
CONVERSATION WITH GOC OFFICIALS FOLLOWING 9/11 WHEN GOC 
COOPERATION WAS SOUGHT, PO SUGGESTED THAT CUBA RELEASE INTO 
U.S. CUSTODY FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE RESIDENT IN CUBA. 
 
E) CUBAN AFFINITY WITH AND SYMPATHY FOR COUNTRIES, GROUPS 
AND INDIVIDUALS WHO PURPORT TO ADVOCATE INTERESTS 
ANTITHETICAL TO THE UNITED STATES COULD IMPEDE CUBAN 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS, AND EXTRADITION COULD 
BE IMPEDED BY THE LACK OF A FUNCTIONING EXTRADITION TREATY. 
NEVERTHELESS, USINT IS AWARE OF NO INSTANCE IN 2001 IN 
WHICH THIS OCCURRED. 
 
F) PUBLIC STATEMENTS FROM THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT IN RESPONSE 
TO 9/11 BEGAN WITH AN INITIAL MESSAGE OF SYMPATHY AND 
STEADILY DETERIORATED.  (REF C)  HOWEVER, EVEN IN THE FIRST 
MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE, THE NOTION THAT CUBA HAS BEEN A 
VICTIM OF TERRORIST ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY INDIVIDUALS 
RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES WAS UNDERSCORED.  THE GOC 
HELD A MASSIVE DEMONSTRATION IN LATE SEPTEMBER PROTESTING 
THE 1976 DOWNING OF A CUBANA AIRLINER BY ALLEGED TERRORISTS 
ORLANDO BOSCH AND LUIS POSADA CARRILES, AT WHICH CASTRO 
UNVEILED HIS NEW MANTRA, \"NO TO TERRORISM, NO TO WAR.\" (REF 
B)  THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY TWO MONTHS OF HIGHLY CRITICAL 
MEDIA REPORTING ON THE `MURDEROUS\' WAR WAGED BY THE U.S. ON 
AFGHAN CHILDREN. (REF D)  GOC OFFICIALS PRIVATELY MADE 
MINIMAL EFFORTS TO COOPERATE WITH POST EFFORTS TO COLLECT 
INFORMATION ON THE ATTACKS, ALTHOUGH GOC OFFICIALS, 
INCLUDING THE FOREIGN MINISTER, REPORTED PUBLICLY THAT THEY 
HAD COOPERATED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. (REF E) 
 
G) THE GOC PARROTED ITS THEME \"NO TO TERRORISM, NO TO WAR\" 
AT BOTH THE UNGA AND THE IBERO-AMERICAN SUMMIT.  CUBA 
SIGNED THE IBERO-AMERICAN DECLARATION ON TERRORISM AT THIS 
YEAR\'S IBERO-AMERICAN SUMMIT - A DEPARTURE FROM ITS 
ATTITUDE DURING THE PREVIOUS SUMMIT, WHEN IT REFUSED TO 
SIGN A SIMILAR DECLARATION BECAUSE IT DID NOT INCLUDE 
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE CENSURING TERRORISM AGAINST CUBA.  CUBA 
HAS SIGNED AND RATIFIED ALL 12 INTERNATIONAL 
COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS. 
 
H) CUBA PERMITS UP TO 20 MEMBERS OF ETA TO RESIDE IN CUBA, 
AND PROVIDES SOME DEGREE OF SAFEHAVEN AND SUPPORT TO 
MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIAN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS FARC AND 
ELN.  THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA IS AWARE OF THIS 
ARRANGEMENT AND, TO POST\'S KNOWLEDGE, DOES NOT OBJECT.  A 
GOC SPOKESPERSON REVEALED IN AUGUST THAT SINN FEIN\'S 
OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR CUBA AND LATIN AMERICA, NIALL 
CONNOLLY, WHO WAS ARRESTED IN COLOMBIA UNDER SUSPICION OF 
TRAINING COLOMBIAN REBELS IN THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES, WAS 
BASED IN HAVANA FOR FIVE YEARS. 
 
I) CUBAN PRESIDENT CASTRO AND VISITED IRAN, SYRIA AND LIBYA 
IN MAY 2001.  CASTRO WAS QUOTED AS SAYING \"IRAN AND CUBA, 
IN COOPERATION WITH EACH OTHER CAN BRING AMERICA TO ITS 
KNEES.  THE U.S. REGIME IS VERY WEAK, AND WE ARE WITNESSING 
THIS WEAKNESS FROM CLOSE UP.\" 
 
J) THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE CUBAN 
GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM IN 2001, OTHER THAN POST 9/11 COMMENTS NOTED 
ABOVE. 
 
K) THERE HAS BEEN MINIMAL COOPERATION FOLLOWING THE EVENTS 
OF 9/11, ALTHOUGH THE GOC AGREED TO INCREASE SECURITY 
AROUND USINT.  THEY BY PROVIDED INFORMATION FOLLOWING 9/11, 
BUT IT PROVED TO BE NOTHING OF VALUE. 
 
L) SHORT OF POST 9/11 COMMUNICATIONS REPORTED IN REFTELS, 
POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY U.S. REQUESTS FOR COOPERATION FROM 
THE GOC DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION 
OR PROSECUTION OF AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST 
U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS. 
 
M) AS THERE HAVE BEEN NO U.S. REQUESTS FOR COOPERATION FROM 
THE GOC IN THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS, POST HAS NO INFORMATION 
THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT TO THIS SUB-SECTION.

2.  A) THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS 
TAKEN BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT THE 
GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE GOC 
REMAINS OPPOSED TO THE U.S.-LED COALITION 
PROSECUTING THE WAR ON GLOBAL TERRORISM AND 
IS ACTIVELY CRITICAL OF MANY ASSOCIATED U.S. 
POLICIES AND ACTIONS.  THE GOC DID NOT 
PROTEST THE USE OF GUANTANAMO BASE TO HOUSE 
ILLEGAL COMBATANTS FROM THE CONFLICT IN 
AFGHANISTAN, HOWEVER, AND IT ALSO RESOLVED 
LONG-STANDING ISSUES RELATED TO EXPANDING THE 
AIRSPACE AT THE BASE.  THE CHANGES FACILITATE 
THE LANDING OF LARGER TRANSPORT-TYPE 
AIRCRAFT, GIVING AIRCRAFT CARRYING UNLAWFUL 
COMBATANTS THE ABILITY TO LAND AT GUANTANAMO. 
THE GOC ALSO AGREED TO FINALLY ALLOW 
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN AIRCRAFT AND THE HAVANA 
CONTROL TOWER WHEN NECESSARY.  CUBA SIGNED 
AND RATIFIED ALL 12 INTERNATIONAL 
COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS IN 2001. 
 
B)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY JUDICIAL 
RESPONSE IN THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST 
TERRORISM AFTER THE TERRORIST ACTS OF 9/11. 
 
C)  THE GOC DID NOT EXTRADITE NOR REQUEST 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR 
PROSECUTION DURING 2002.  IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE U.S.-CUBA EXTRADITION TREATY WAS 
SUSPENDED FOLLOWING THE BREAK IN DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS IN 1961. 
 
D)  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO USG REQUEST FOR GOC 
PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS, CUBAN AFFINITY WITH AND SYMPATHY

PURPORT TO ADVOCATE INTERESTS ANTITHETICAL TO 
THE UNITED STATES COULD IMPEDE CUBAN 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS. 
EXTRADITION COULD BE IMPEDED BY THE LACK OF A 
FUNCTIONING EXTRADITION TREATY. 
 
E)  THE GOC HAS HINDERED USG EFFORTS TO 
COMBAT TERRORISM BY SOWING MISINFORMATION 
THROUGH \"WALK-INS\" AT SEVERAL US MISSIONS 
AROUND THE WORLD.  CUBAN OFFICIALS HAVE 
PUBLICLY ATTACKED THE USG FOR EXECUTING 
\"DISPROPORTIONATE\" MILITARY RESPONSES AGAINST 
TERRORISTS AND FOR DIVERTING INTERNATIONAL 
FORA FROM ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS IN 
FAVOR OF MILITARY ACTIONS.  THERE HAS BEEN NO 
POSITIVE ASSISTANCE. 
 
F)  THE GOC HAS TAKEN NO MAJOR 
COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 2002. 
 
G) CUBA HARBORS UP TO 20 MEMBERS OF ETA IN 
CUBA, AND PROVIDES SOME DEGREE OF SAFEHAVEN 
AND SUPPORT TO MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIAN 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS FARC AND ELN.  THE 
GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA HAS PUBLICLY INDICATED 
THAT IT SEEKS THE GOC\'S CONTINUED MEDIATION 
WITH ELN AGENTS IN CUBA.  A GOC SPOKESPERSON 
REVEALED IN AUGUST 2001 THAT SINN FEIN\'S 
OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR CUBA AND LATIN 
AMERICA, NIALL CONNOLLY, WHO WAS ARRESTED IN 
COLOMBIA UNDER SUSPICION OF TRAINING 
COLOMBIAN REBELS IN THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES, 
WAS BASED IN HAVANA FOR FIVE YEARS.  HIS 
TRIAL IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN THIS YEAR IN 
BOGOTA.  IN ADDITION, CUBA PROVIDES REFUGE TO 
APPROXIMATELY 73 FUGITIVES FROM U.S. JUSTICE, 
INCLUDING JOANNE CHESIMARD, A CONVICTED FELON 
WHO IS WANTED FOR INTERSTATE FLIGHT AND 
MURDER OF A NEW JERSEY STATE TROOPER.  MOST 
OF THE FUGITIVES HAVE BEEN CONVICTED IN U.S. 
COURTS FOR TERRORIST-RELATED CRIMES, I.E. 
AIRCRAFT HIJACKING. 
 
H)  POST IS UNAWARE OF ANY GOC STATEMENTS IN
