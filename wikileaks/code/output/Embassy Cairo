SUBJECT:  GROWING DEBATE ON SHARIA LAW 
 
REF:  CAIRO 5284 
 
 
1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
 
2.  BEGIN SUMMARY.  MOMENTUM IS BEGINNING TO BUILD TOWARD 
A MAY DEBATE IN THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY ON ISLAMIC SHARIA 
(KORANIC LAW).  IN RECENT DAYS, KEY OPPOSITION FIGURES 
FUAD SIRAJ AL-DIN (CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW WAFD PARTY) AND 
OMAR TALMASSANI (GENERAL GUIDE OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD) 
APPEARED BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY\'S RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE 
TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR PURGING OF EXISTING LEGISLATION 
NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA.  THE SPEAKER OF THE 
ASSEMBLY, RIFAAT EL MAHGOUB, WHILE SUPPORTING THE OVERALL 
OBJECTIVE, LEFT DELIBERATELY VAGUE THE TIMING AND EXTENT 
OF THE PURGE.  THE ADVOCATES DOUBTLESS KNOW THE PROCESS 
OF IMPLEMENTING \"FULL SHARIA\" WILL BE PROTRACTED; INDEED, 
MUBARAK IS PERCEIVED AS UNCOMPROMISING IN OPPOSITION TO 
\"THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA.\"  IN ADVANCE OF THE MAY 
DEBATE PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF, AND MANEUVERING ABOUT, SHARIA 
ISSUES IS ALREADY UNDERWAY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  WE RECENTLY REPORTED AT LENGTH ON MUBARAK\'S EVOLVING 
DEMOCRACY -- SEE CAIRO 5284.  THE EGYPTIAN PUBLIC IN THE 
LAST FEW DAYS HAS WITNESSED A REMARKABLE DEMONSTRATION 
OF THIS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION, AS WAFD PARTY CHAIRMAN FUAD 
SIRAJ AL-DIN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GENERAL GUIDE OMAR 
TALMASSANI BOTH ATTENDED HEARINGS OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY 
RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.  THEIR ATTENDANCE, PROMI- 
NENTLY REPORTED ON TELEVISION AND IN THE PRESS, WAS A 
SIGNAL OF RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT 
AND TWO OF THE CHIEF FOES OF FORMER PRESIDENTS NASSER 
AND SADAT. 
 
- 
4.  THE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HEARINGS, ALSO 
ATTENDED BY SPEAKER RIFAAT EL MAHGOUB, A NUMBER OF 
AL-AZHAR SHEIKHS, AND OTHER ISLAMIC EXPERTS, ARE IN 
PREPARATION FOR A MAY ASSEMBLY DEBATE ON SHARIA (KORANIC) 
LAW.  MAHGOUB MADE CLEAR THE GOVERNMENT\'S SUPPORT FOR 
\"PURGING\" EXISTING LEGISLATION OF PROVISIONS IN CONFLICT 
WITH SHARIA, AND HE WAS ECHOED BY SIRAJ AL-DIN, 
TALMASSANI, AND OTHER OPPOSITION PARTY FIGURES.  THE 
SPEAKER, HOWEVER, WAS DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS ABOUT THE 
TIMING AND SPEED OF THE PURGE, AS WELL AS ABOUT HOW FAR 
IT WOULD GO IN CHANGING THE MYRIAD LAWS ON THE EGYPTIAN 
BOOKS.  THE EXCHANGES GAVE THE PUBLIC A TASTE OF MORE TO 
COME IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, EGYPTIAN STYLE, WHEREIN 
ALL SIDES CAN ADDRESS MAJOR ISLAMIC ISSUES LONG UNRESOLVED, 
BUT WITHOUT ANY CONCRETE RESULT LIKELY -- AT LEAST 
IMMEDIATELY. 
 
- 
5.  KEY QUESTIONS ARE OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE TO EGYPTIAN 
SOCIETY -- THE TREATMENT OF THE COPTIC CHRISTIAN MINORITY 
IF SHARIA LAW IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED; POSSIBLE CHANGES IN 
THE STATUS OF WOMEN; THE IMPACT OF ABOLITION OF BANKING 
INTEREST ON THE ECONOMY; THE EFFECTS ON TOURISM OF BANNING 
ALCOHOL; WESTERN REACTION TO THE ADOPTION OF ISLAMIC PUN- 
ISHMENTS SUCH AS AMPUTATION, FLOGGING, AND STONING (EVEN 
IF SPARINGLY APPLIED).  FEW OBSERVERS EXPECT THESE DIF- 
FICULT ISSUES UNDERLYING THE SHARIA DEBATE TO BE RESOLVED 
IN THE ASSEMBLY DISCUSSIONS IN MAY.  THOUGH THEY CANNOT 
SAY SO PUBLICLY, OPPOSITION FIGURES LIKE SIRAJ AL-DIN AND 
TALMASSANI ACKNOWLEDGE PRIVATELY THAT THE SHARIA DEBATE 
WILL ONLY BE THE BEGINNING OF A LONG UNCERTAIN PROCESS. 
INDEED, NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND OPPOSITION OBSERV- 
ERS BELIEVE THAT MUBARAK WILL NOT COMPROMISE IN HIS OP- 
POSITION TO \"THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA,\" BECAUSE 
THE SOCIAL, SECTARIAN, AND INTERNATIONAL COSTS ARE TOO 
HIGH.  WHAT MARGINAL COMPROMISES, IF ANY, HE MAY CONCEDE 
 
- 
6.  MEANWHILE, HAPPENINGS ON OTHER FRONTS ARE BOTH 
PROVOKING AND REENFORCING PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF ISLAMIC 
SHARIA ISSUES.  HANDLING OF SUCH DISPARATE SUBJECTS AS 
OPPOSITION POLITICAL ALLIANCES, PUNISHMENT OF RAPE, AND 
WOMEN\'S RIGHTS INCREASINGLY FEED THE DEBATE.  TO WIT: 
 
--  ONE OF THE STRONGEST PROPONENTS OF SHARIA, SHEIKH 
SALAH ABU ISMAIL, WAS HASTILY EXPELLED FROM THE NEW WAFD 
OPPOSITION PARTY AFTER CRITICIZING SIRAJ AL-DIN FOR NOT 
PUSHING SHARIA HARD ENOUGH.  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GUIDE 
TALMASSANI TURNED HIS BACK ON THE OUTSPOKEN SHEIKH AND 
HAS MAINTAINED THE MB\'S ALLIANCE WITH THE WAFD. 
TALMASSANI OBSERVED TO POLCOUNS AND POLOFF MARCH 5 THAT 
THE SHEIKH SOMETIMES SPEAKS OUT BEFORE HE CONSIDERS ALL 
THE CONSEQUENCES; SHEIKH SALAH WAS NOW IN THE PROCESS 
OF MAKING PEACE WITH THE WAFD (THOUGH NOTHING WAS SAID 
ABOUT HIS BEING RETURNED TO THE PARTY). 
 
--  SHARIA PROPONENTS HAVE BEEN LOUDLY CALLING FOR THE 
EXECUTION OF OFFENDERS IN SEVERAL NOTORIOUS KIDNAP/RAPE 
INCIDENTS IN RECENT WEEKS.  THE OPPOSITION PRESS IS 
GIVING FULL PUBLICITY TO THIS EVIDENCE OF EROSION IN 
TRADITIONAL EGYPTIAN SOCIAL MORES.  PUBLIC FEELING IS 
RUNNING HIGH IN CAIRO, AMIDST CHARGES THAT OFFENDERS 
HAVE BEEN GIVEN SOFT TREATMENT IN THE COURTS.  SOME 
CRITICS, IN THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR SEVERE \"ISLAMIC\" 
PUNISHMENT OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT EXECUTION FOR KIDNAP/RAPE 
IS POSSIBLE WITHIN THE PRESENT LEGAL CODE.  (MANY ALSO 
ARE NOW SAYING THAT AMERICAN-MADE TV FILMS ABOUT VIOLENCE 
AND CRIME AVAILABLE ON EGYPTIAN TELEVISION ARE CORRUPTING 
THE YOUTH.) 
 
--  THE MINISTER OF AWQAF (ISLAMIC ENDOWMENTS) AND THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY\'S COMPLAINTS COMMITTEE HAVE GONE 
PUBLIC WITH DEMANDS TO AMEND THE LAW OF PERSONAL STATUS -- 
SO THAT SHARIA PROVISIONS REGARDING DIVORCE AND PROPERTY 
EOULD AGAIN BE ENFORCED.  THE LAW, PASSED UNDER THE LATE 
PRESIDENT SADAT AND INFORMALLY NAMED THE \"JEHAN LAW\" 
AFTER HIS WIFE, GAVE THE WIFE THE RIGHT FOR THE FIRST 
TIME TO INITIATE DIVORCE IF HER HUSBAND MARRIED A SECOND 
WIFE; THE LAW ALSO GAVE A DIVORCED WIFE FIRST RIGHTS TO 
THE HOUSEHOLD UNTIL SHE IS PROVIDED EQUIVALENT QUARTERS. 
TODAY, IMPORTANT SHEIKHS, WHO IN 1979 TRIMMED THEIR 
INTERPRETATIONS TO SUIT \"WOMEN\'S RIGHTS\" PUSHED BY SADAT 
AND HIS WIFE, HAVE BEGUN TACKING TOWARD A MORE LITERAL 
INTERPRETATION OF SHARIA. 
 
7.  AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF GROWING SHARIA DISCUSSIONS, 
THE STATE AUTHORITIES     IN RECENT WEEKS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE 
AGAINST FRINGE ELEMENTS OF THE POLITICO-RELIGIOUS SPECTRUM. 
 
--  AT CAIRO\'S AL-NUR MOSQUE, A MAGNET FOR ISLAMIC HARD- 
LINERS IN THE CAPITAL, RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS (SOME FROM 
AL-JIHAD, SOME FOR AL-HIDAIYA AL-ISLAMIYA) HAVE BEEN 
PICKED UP ON THREE SUCCESSIVE WEEKENDS FOLLOWING FRIDAY 
PRAYERS -- FOR DISTRIBUTING LEAFLETS WHOSE CONTENTS HAVE 
NOT BEEN REPORTED.  NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN PLACED, AND THE 
DETAINEES RELEASED UPON PAYMENT OF TOKEN FINES.  SIMILAR 
ACTIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED (BUT NOT DETAILED) IN THE 
UNIVERSITY TOWNS OF MINYA AND ASSIUT AGAINST FORMER 
DEFENDANTS FREED LAST OCTOBER IN THE PROLONGED TRIAL OF 
THOSE CHARGED IN THE ARMED REVOLT FOLLOWING SADAT\'S 1981 
ASSASSINATION. (BEHIND THE SCENES THE MINISTRY OF AWQAF 
SEEMS TO BE STRUGGLING TO EXERCISE SUPERVISION OVER AL-NUR, 
WHOSE LEADING SHEIKH IS STILL DENIED THE PULPIT.  IN THE 
LATTER SADAT YEARS, AL-NUR MOSQUE DREW UP TO THIRTY 
THOUSAND WORSHIPPERS ON FRIDAYS TO LISTEN TO ANTI-SADAT 
SERMONS.) 
 
--  IN ALEXANDRIA, A \"CRAZY DOCTOR\" WAS ARRESTED ALONG 
WITH 30 OR SO FOLLOWERS; HE CLAIMED TO BE THE PROPHET 
MOHAMED, AND HAPPENED TO HAVE ONE MILLION DOLLARS PLUS 
IN HIS BANK ACCOUNT.  NO CHARGES HAVE YET BEEN FILED. 
 
--  IN LATE FEBRUARY, SOME 40 BAHAIS WERE ARRESTED FOR 
VIOLATING A 1960 NASSER DECREE (STILL IN EFFECT) OUTLAWING 
BAHAI ACTIVITIES IN EGYPT.  AN AL-AZHAR UNDERSECRETARY 
SENT DOCUMENTS TO THE STATE SECURITY PROSECUTOR SHOWING 
THAT THE BAHAIS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED \"APOSTATES\" 
FROM ISLAM.  (THE BAHAIS HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN RELEASED 
WITHOUT CHARGES AND ARE PRESENTLY REMAINING IN THEIR 
HOMES.  SEE CAIRO 06100.) 
- 
--  ON FEBRUARY 26 TALMASSANI WAS SUDDENTLY (AND WITH- 
OUT EXPLANATION) FORBIDDEN ACCESS TO CAIRO UNIVERSITY. 
HE HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS A MEETING AT THE COM- 
MERCE COLLEGE, AT THE INVITATION OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL. 
PERMISSION WAS IN WRITING, AND STAMPED BY THE VICE 
CHANCELLOR\'S OFFICE.  HOWEVER, HE TOLD POLCOUNS AT 9:30 
ON THE MORNING OF THE SPEECH, HE WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE 
PERMISSION HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN.  THE STUDENT DEMONSTRA- 
TION FOLLOWED (SEE CAIRO 5919).  TALMASSANI CRITICIZED 
THE DECISION TO US, NOTING THAT THE STUDENT COUNCIL HAD 
A \"MODERATE\" ISLAMIC MAJORITY (SUPPORTED BY MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD) AND THAT HIS APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE PACIFIED - 
NOT INCITED - THE STUDENTS. 
 
- 
8.  COMMENT:  THESE MOVES REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
POLISHING OF ITS OWN ISLAMIC CREDENTIALS (IN THE CASES 
OF THE BAHAIS AND ALEXANDRIA\'S DERANGED PROPHET), AND 
SETTING LIMITS FOR ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL/RELIGIOUS BE- 
HAVIOR (IN THE CASE OF AL-NUR MOSQUEAND THE BANNING 
OF TALMASSANI\'S UNIVERSITY SPEECH.) AS FOR THE INCIPIENT 
DEBATE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND PRESS ON SHARIA, IT IS AT THIS 
STAGE MORE SHADOW THAN SUBSTANCE; BUT IT IS NONETHELESS 
AN IMPORTANT REFLECTION OF THE MOOD OF THE SOCIETY.  PRO- 
FOUND SOCIAL ISSUES ARE INVOLVED.  THE GOAL OF \"SECULAR- 
ISTS\" WHO RUN THE GOVERNMENT IS TO ENCOMPASS MODERATE 
ISLAMIC ELEMENTS WITHIN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, UNDERCUT- 
TING EXTREMISM WHILE PREVENTING THE ADOPTION OF THE COM- 
PLETE IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA.  THE ISLAMIC SIDE, WHICH 
INCLUDES THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND TO SOME EXTENT THE 
WAFD, PLUS MAINSTREAM MUSLIM LEADERS FROM AL-AZHAR AND 
THE MINISTRY OF AWQAF, HOPES TO USE THE DEMOCRATIC 
PROCESS TO BUILD UP AN IRREVERSIBLE MOMENTUM TOWARD 
SHARIA.  BOTH SIDES AT PRESENT ARE KEEN TO MAINTAIN THE 
STABILITY OF EGYPTIAN SOCIETY, THOUGH MISMANAGEMENT OF 
THE SHARIA ISSUE COULD CREATE SERIOUS TENSIONS.  END 
COMMENT.

- 
2.  BEGIN SUMMARY.  THE MAY DEBATE IN THE PEOPLES 
ASSEMBLY ON ISLAMIC SHARIA WILL PRODUCE NO IMMEDIATE 
RESULTS, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL SOURCES, 
INCLUDING THE OPPOSITION.  IT IS LIKELY TO LAUNCH A 
REVIEW PROCESS LASTING SEVERAL YEARS TO ENSURE THAT 
EXISTING LEGISLATION IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA.  THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE OPPOSITION NEW WAFD PARTY AND OF THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ARE ON BOARD ABOUT THIS PROCESS, 
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF POSSIBLE TACIT COMPROMISES 
BETWEEN THE GOVERNING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (NDP) 
AND WAFD ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF SHARIA ISSUES. 
ALTHOUGH MAJOR POLITICAL FORCES HAVE APPARENTLY 
ESTABLISHED A \"DETENTE\" OVER SHARIA, HOWEVER, ISLAMIC 
DEMAGOGUERY AND VIOLENCE BY UNDERGROUND ISLAMIC 
EXTREMISTS ARE DANGERS THAT WILL PERSIST EVEN AS THE 
SHARIA PROCESS ROLLS FORWARD IN THE UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC 
CONDITIONS OF THE COUNTRY.  END SUMMARY. 
- 
 
3.  SINCE OUR RECENT REPORT ON THE COMING PEOPLES 
ASSEMBLY DEBATE OF ISLAMIC SHARIA (KORANIC LAW) IN MAY 
(SEE REF A), IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT THIS DEBATE WILL 
PRODUCE NO IMMEDIATE RESULTS.  ACCORDING TO A RANGE OF 
WELL-PLACED SOURCES, THE ASSEMBLY DISCUSSIONS WILL LEAD 
TO A LAW-BY-LAW REVIEW OF EXISTING LEGISLATION TO ENSURE 
THAT EACH AND EVERY LAW IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA 
PROVISIONS.  THIS PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO TAKE AT LEAST 
SEVERAL YEARS.  LEADING ELEMENTS OF THE NEW WAFD PARTY, 
AND OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD NOW ALLIED TO IT, HAVE 
CONFIRMED PRIVATELY TO US THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND 
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS DELIBERATE PROCESS.  THEIR AGREEMENT, 
ADDED TO THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY\'S DOMINATION IN 
THE ASSEMBLY, ROBS THE COMING DEBATE OF SOME OF ITS 
DRAMA AND DECREASES THE CHANGES OF NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS. 
 
- 
4.   THIS SCENARIO REFLECTS THE TACTICS OF PRESIDENT 
MUBARAK, ABLY SUPPORTED BY HIS SPEAKER OF THE PEOPLES 
ASSEMBLY, RIFAAT EL MAHGOUB; THEY ARE WILLING TO LET 
ISLAMIC SENTIMENT BE EXPRESSED FREELY, BUT NOT TO THE 
POINT OF THREATENING THE POLITICAL STATUS QUO.  GOVERN- 
MENT AND NDP CIRCLES HAVE BEEN SPREADING THE WORD QUIETLY 
BUT FIRMLY THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NO INTENTION OF LETTING 
THE SHARIA ISSUE GET OUT OF CONTROL.  COMMENTING IN A 
PRESS INTERVIEW ON A DEMAND BY GAD AL-HAQ, THE GRAND 
SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR (WHO OCCUPIES THE MOST PROMINENT 
ISLAMIC POST IN EGYPT), FOR THE APPLICATION OF ISLAMIC 
SHARIA, MUBARAK STATED THAT EGYPTIAN LAWS \"DO NOT CONFLICT 
IN ANY WAY WITH THE ISLAMIC RELIGION AND ARE 99 PERCENT 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH ISLAMIC SHARIA.\"  MUBARAK DID NOT GET 
INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THE REMAINING \"ONE PERCENT,\" OR THE 
EXTENT OF CHANGES IN LAWS REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AS 
BANKING PRACTICES OR ISLAMIC PUNISHMENTS.  (WE HEAR FROM 
OTHER SOURCES THAT \"TINKERING\" WITH EGYPTIAN LEGISLATION 
WILL FOCUS IN THE BANKING AREA, WITH THE SUBSTITUTION 
OF \"FEES\" AND \"SHARED OWNERSHIP\" FOR INTEREST; ISLAMIC 
PUNISHMENTS ARE SAID TO BE OUT OF THE QUESTION.) 
MUBARAK\'S POINT, OF COURSE, IS THAT NOTHING MUCH NEEDS 
TO BE ALTERED. 
 
- 
5.  THIS VIEWPOINT IS DRAMATICALLY OPPOSED TO THAT OF 
SHARIA PROPONENTS, WHO WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO 
THROW OUT THE ENTIRE EGYPTIAN LEGAL SYSTEM--WITH ALL OF 
ITS FOREIGN ACCRETIONS--AND REPLACE IT WITH \"THE FULL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF ISLAMIC SHARIA.\"  ACCORDING TO THE 
ORIGINATOR OF THIS \"99 PERCENT\" REASONING, STATE SECURITY 
COURT CHIEF JUSTICE SAID AL-ASHMAWY, MUBARAK\'S ADOPTION 
OF HIS STAND SHOWS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ABSOLUTELY 
DETERMINED NOT TO ALLOW \"THE SHEIKHS\" TO GAIN CONTROL OF 
EGYPTIAN LAW. 
 
- 
6.  AL-ASHMAWY ALSO TOLD US THAT HIS ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
\"FULL SHARIA\" HAVE RECENTLY WON SUPPORT IN THE WAFD PARTY 
AS IT PREPARES FOR THE ASSEMBLY DEBATE.  HE MENTIONED 
THE NAMES OF MUMTAZ NASSAR AND WAHEED RAAFAT, TWO SENIOR 
PARTY FIGURES AND BOTH LEGAL EXPERTS, SUGGESTING AN 
INFORMAL UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE DELIBERATE PACE OF VERY 
LIMITED LEGAL CHANGE.  MUMTAZ NASSAR, WAFD LEADER IN THE 
PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, RECENTLY TOLD US HIMSELF THAT THE WAFD 
AGREES WITH THE LENGTHY TIMETABLE FOR SHARIA REVIEW. 
PRAISING PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S \"DEMOCRATIC\" APPROACH 
(COMPARED TO THAT OF SADAT AND NASSER),  NASSAR IMPLIED 
THAT ACCEPTABLE  COMPROMISES BETWEEN THE WAFD AND THE 
NDP ARE ALREADY IN SIGHT OVER THE QUESTION OF THE BANKING 
SYSTEM AND ISLAMIC SHARIA. 
 
- 
7.  COMMENT.  WE SENSE A CERTAIN SATISFACTION IN 
GOVERNMENT AND SECULAR POLITICAL CIRCLES OVER PROSPECTIVE 
SUCCESS IN CONTAINING THE SHARIA DEBATE, WITH THE WAFD 
AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD LEADERSHIP EVIDENTLY ON BOARD. 
HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY.  HAVING A KIND 
OF  DETENTE BETWEEN THE MAJOR LICENSED POLITICAL ORGANI- 
ZATIONS DOES NOT RULE OUT ISLAMIC DEMAGOGUERY OR VIOLENCE 
INSTIGATED BY EXTREMIST ISLAMIC GROUPS. 
 
- 
8.  ADDED COMMENT.  SHARIA PROPONENTS HAVE BEEN THROUGH 
THIS BEFORE.  SADAT\'S RESPONSE TO THEIR DEMANDS WAS TO 
ESTABLISH COMMITTEES AND LET THEM DRAFT LAWS, A PROCESS 
WHICH LASTED FIVE YEARS AND ENDED WITH NO LEGISLATION 
BEING PASSED.  NOW, IT SEEMS WE ARE TO SEE A REVERSE 
PROCESS:  MORE COMMITTEES TO STUDY EXISTING LAWS AND 
AGAIN, LITTLE REAL CHANGE IN THE LEGAL STATUS QUO.  THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN BE EXPECTED TO MAKE THE MOST OF MARGINAL 
ISLAMIC IMPROVEMENTS TO CURRENT LAW, SO AS TO PREVENT 
THE SHARIA ISSUE FROM STRIKING AN ISLAMIC SPARK AMONG 
THE MUSLIM MASSES.  THIS MAY MEAN A POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE 
AND LEGAL STRUCTURE WITH MARGINALLY MORE ISLAMIC COLORA- 
TION.  END COMMENT.

1.  S-ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  THREE STRONG IMPRESSIONS EMERGED FROM 
EMBOFF\'S INTRODUCTORY CALL ON THE NEW MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
LEADERSHIP SEPTEMBER 10:  (1) CURRENT LEADERSHIP IS KEEN 
TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE WITH THE U.S. EMBASSY; (2) 
AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS VERY WORRIED ABOUT AVOIDING 
PROBLEMS WITH THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR; AND (3) 
NEW SUPREME GUIDE ABUL  NASR APPEARS MORE A FIGUREHEAD 
THAN THE REAL POWER WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP, WHO MAY BE 
DEPUTY MUSTAFA MASHHUR.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
3.  POLOFF AND POL FSN MADE FIRST OFFICIAL CONTACT 
WITH MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD LEADERSHIP SINCE DEATH LAST MAY 
OF PREVIOUS SUPREME GUIDE OMAR TALMASSANI, MEETING AT 
OFFICES PREVIOUSLY USED BY BANNED MB MAGAZINE AL-DA\'WA 
SEPTEMBER 10.  CORDIAL BUT SHORT MEETING WAS DEVOTED 
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO WHY THE MEETING COULD NOT TAKE 
PLACE AT GREATER LENGTH AS PLANNED.  DEPUTY SUPREME 
GUIDE MUSTAFA MASHHUR HAD POSITIVELY AND PROMPTLY 
RESPONDED TO EMBASSY REQUEST SEPTEMBER 9 FOR THE CALL 
ON NEW SUPREME GUIDE MUHAMMED HAMAD ABUL NASR, BUT HAD 
ASKED EMBASSY TO SECURE MINISTRY  OF INTERIOR CLEARANCE. 
WISHING TO AVOID THE PRECEDENT OF REQUESTING SUCH 
ADVANCE CLEARANCE  FOR DIPLOMATIC WORK, EMBOFF 
APPEARED AT THE APPOINTED TIME AND PLACE WITHOUT 
MININT CLEARANCE.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE CALL WAS 
ROUTINE COURTESY CALL. 
 
 
4.  MASHHUR AND ABUL NASR CORDIALLY WELCOMED POLOFF AND 
FSN, OFFERED THE CUSTOMARY SWEETS, AND MET WITH THEM FOR 
ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES.  HOWEVER, IN THE PRESENCE OF 
A MALE SECRETARY TAKING APPARENTLY VERBATIM NOTES, 
MASHHUR AND ABUL NASR REPEATEDLY INSISTED ON THE NEED 
FOR THE EMBASSY TO SECURE WRITTEN PERMISSION FOR THE 
MB TO MEET WITH EMBOFFS -- INSISTING EQUALLY STRONGLY 
UPON THEIR WELCOME OF CONTINUED CONTACTS WITH THE 
EMBASSY.  THEY STATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MEET EMBOFF 
AT LENGTH ASAP -- EVEN LATER THE SAME DAY, OR IN THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS -- PROVIDED THE WRITTEN PERMISSION WAS 
FORTHCOMING FROM THE MININT.  THEY EXPLAINED THAT IN 
THE PAST THE GOE HAD PROVIDED VERBAL APPROVAL FOR MB 
CONTACTS WITH THE BRITISH EMBASSY, AND YET HAD CITED 
THESE CONTACTS AS ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES WHEN IT FOUND THIS 
USEFUL AGAINST THE MB.  POLOFF NOTED, TO NO AVAIL, 
THAT EMBASSY OFFICERS HAD HAD PERIODIC TALKS WITH 
TALMASSANI IN THE TWO YEARS PRECEDING HIS DEATH. 
MB INTERLOCUTORS CONCEDED THIS POINT, ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
EMBASSY MAINTAINS CONTACTS EVEN WITH POLITICAL OPPOSITION 
FIGURES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS WORK, AND NOTED 
THAT THE MB IS ALSO FREE TO MEET WITH JOURNALISTS . 
NONETHELESS, THEY INSISTED THAT EGYPTIAN LAW REQUIRES 
THE MB TO SECURE PERMISSION TO MEET REPRESENTATIVES 
OF ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.  THEY WERE CAREFUL TO 
ASK THAT EMBASSY SECURE A GENERAL MININT CLEARANCE 
THAT WOULD PERMIT REPEATED CONTACTS WITH  MORE THAN 
ONE EMBASSY OFFICER, SO THAT WRITTEN PERMISSION WOULD 
NOT HAVE TO BE OBTAINED FOR EACH MEETING. 
 
 
5.  POLOFF EXPRESSED FULL RESPECT FOR EGYPTIAN LAW AND 
UNDERSTANDING FOR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD\'S CONCERNS. 
HE STATED HIS HOPE THAT THE ISSUE COULD BE RESOLVED 
QUICKLY TO PERMIT AN EARLY RETURN MEETING FOR THE 
PURPOSE OF PROMOTING MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING.  BEFORE TAKING 
LEAVE, HE ALSO CONVEYED EMBASSY\'S RESPECT FOR THOSE 
PRESENT AND FOR THE ROLE OF ISLAM IN EGYPTIAN SOCIETY. 
MASHHUR AND ABUL NASR RESPONDED WARMLY AND AGAIN 
STATED THEIR WELCOME FOR CONTACTS WITH THE EMBASSY, 
\"BOTH AS MUSLIMS AND AS ARABS.\" 
 
 
6.  IMPRESSIONS FROM THIS EXCHANGE: 
 
(1) THE MB IS EAGER TO STEP UP CONTACTS WITH THE U.S. 
EMBASSY.  WE CAN ONLY SURMISE THAT, APART FROM WHATEVER 
IDEOLOGICAL THINKING THIS DESIRE MAY REFLECT, ONE 
MOTIVE MAY BE TO ADD TO THE MB\'S LEGITIMACY AS A 
POLITICAL ENTITY. 
 
(2) THE SUCCESSOR LEADERSHIP IS MORE CONCERNED TO 
STAY CLEAR OF PROBLEMS WITH THE GOE.  TALMASSANI HAD 
NOT REQUESTED PRIOR CLEARANCE, AT LEAST NOT VIA 
THIS EMBASSY, FOR HIS SEVERAL CONTACTS WITH EMBOFFS. 
A SEPARATE CONVERSATION BETWEEN POLOFF AND A JOURNALIST 
CONNECTED TO THE MB INDICATED THAT THE MB IS VERY 
CONCERNED OVER THE RECENT WELL-PUBLICIZED ARRESTS 
OF NON-MB FUNDAMENTALISTS.  THIS APPARENT GOE CRACKDOWN 
ON NON-MB FUNDAMENTALISTS MAY BE ONE FACTOR BEHIND 
THE MB\'S UNPRECEDENTED INSISTENCE UPON MININT 
CLEARANCE TO MEET WITH US. 
 
(3) MB LEADERSHIP APPEARED TO LACK SELF CONFIDENCE 
AND COHESION.  THIS MAY BE ANOTHER FACTOR BEHIND 
ITS CAUTION.  ABUL NASR APPEARED PHYSICALLY FRAIL 
AND MORE A FIGUREHEAD THAN THE DOMINANT PRESENCE 
IN THE MEETING.  HIS COMPLEXION WAS SALLOW AND HIS 
WESTERN BUSINESS SUIT HUNG ON HIM LOOSELY.  HIS VOICE 
WAS RASPY AND UNSTEADY, AND HIS VERY THICK EYEGLASSES 
MAY INDICATE FAILING VISION.  ALTHOUGH ABUL NASR 
SAT IN THE POSITION OF HONOR BEHIND A DESK,  MASHHUR, 
ACROSS THE ROOM ON A COUCH, WAS THE MORE IMPOSING 
FIGURE.  MASHHUR, APPARENTLY IN HIS MID-SIXTIES, 
WAS RESPECTFUL -- HE DID NOT INTERRUPT ABUL NASR -- 
BUT NOT DEFERENTIAL.  HE CLEARLY DOMINATED THE 
CONVERSATION WITH STEADY VOICE AND EYECONTACT, AND 
THE MB NOTETAKER LOOKED REPEATEDLY TOWARD MASHHUR AS 
HE TRANSCRIBED THE CONVERSATION.   MOREOVER, 
OUTER OFFICE MB STAFF COMMENTS TO POLOFF OF PROFOUND 
REGRET OVER LOSS OF TALMASSANI SEEMED INTENDED TO 
CONVEY PERCEPTIONS OF ABUL NASR\'S INADEQUACY AS A 
SUCCESSOR. 
 
 
7.  WE DO NOT INTEND TO GET IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE 
SHAKY MB LEADERSHIP AND GOE.  BEYOND ITS OWN CONCERNS, 
TALMASSANI\'S SUCCESSORS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE US TO 
TEST WHETHER THE MININT IS READY TO BESTOW LEGITIMACY 
UPON THE MB.  THROUGH CASUAL LOW KEY CONTACTS IN THE 
FOREIGN MINISTRY, WE INTEND TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR 
NORMAL DIPLOMATIC WORK HERE INCLUDES CONTACTS ACROSS THE 
WIDE SPECTRUM OF EGYPTIAN SOCIETY.  WE SHALL CONTINUE TO 
PURSUE CONTACTS WITH THE MB, MAKING CLEAR TO THEM ALSO 
THAT WE HAVE REMINDED THE MFA OF OUR GENERAL APPROACH.

2.  SUMMARY.  \"NASSERISM\" HAS GAINED PUBLICITY AND 
TOPICALITY IN RECENT MONTHS (REFTEL), BUT NEITHER A 
COHERENT IDEOLOGY NOR A BROAD BASED POLITICAL MOVEMENT HAS 
EMERGED TO GIVE DEFINITION TO THE TERM.  THE MOST CREDIBLE 
ATTEMPT TO FORM A MOVEMENT IS THE SQUARELY ANTI-U.S., 
ANTI-ISRAEL  \"ARAB SOCIALIST NASSERIST PARTY\" (ASNP), NOW 
IN THE LEGAL LIMBO OF \"PARTY UNDER ESTABLISHMENT.\"  A NEW 
WEEKLY NASSERIST NEWSPAPER CLAIMS INDEPENDENCE FROM THE 
ASNP, BUT CLEARLY HAS LINKS TO IT OF DUBIOUS LEGALITY. 
MUBARAK HAS TOLERATED BUT CAREFULLY CIRCUMSCRIBED THE 
RE-EMERGENCE OF NASSERIST VISIBILITY.  THE NASSERISTS 
CLEARLY POSE NO IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE REGIME, AND ARE 
LOCKED IN HOSTILE COMPETITION WITH ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS IN 
THE ATTEMPT TO BEND POPULAR ECONOMIC DISSATISFACTION INTO 
POLITICAL SUPPORT.  THE NASSERISTS\' PRIMARY SIGNIFICANCE 
IS THEIR THEORETICAL POTENTIAL TO INCITE OPPOSITION TO 
ECONOMIC REFORM, ADDING TO MUBARAK\'S CAUTION IN ECONOMIC 
DECISIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  NASSER\'S GHOST:  REFTEL REPORTED DIVERSE ELEMENTS OF 
AN APPARENT RE-EMERGENCE OF  \"NASSERIST \" POLITICAL 
ACTIVITY, NOTABLY:  MOHAMMED HASSANEIN HEIKAL\'S 
RE-APPEARANCE IN PRINT; ESTABLISHMENT OF A PLAINLY 
NASSERIST WEEKLY NEWSPAPER; PROMINENT OFFICIAL 
COMMEMORATION ON 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF NASSER\'S 
NATIONALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL AND HIS SUBSEQUENT 
EMERGENCE AS A NATIONAL HERO IN THE 1956 WAR; AND 
ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF A PROSPECTIVE NEW NASSERIST 
POLITICAL PARTY.  THERE IS LINGERING, PERHAPS EVEN 
MARGINALLY REVIVED POPULAR NOSTALGIA FOR ELEMENTS OF 
NASSER\'S LEGACY.  NEVERTHELESS, THIS SELECTIVE NOSTALGIA 
IS VOICED MAINLY AMONG INTELLECTUALS AND THE LOWER MIDDLE 
CLASS PUBLIC SECTOR AND GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, WHO 
PROSPERED UNDER NASSER.  EVEN THE DEMAGOGIC LEFTIST 
OPPOSITION HAS AVOIDED PROMINENT PLAY OF NASSERISM AND THE 
BRUITED NASSERIST REVIVAL. 
 
4.  MUBARAK AND REVISIONIST NASSERISM:  IN HIS SPEECHES IN 
SEPTEMBER AROUND THE ANNIVERSARY OF NASSER\'S DEATH, 
MUBARAK LAID CLAIM AS THE TRUE HEIR OF NASSERIST 
NATIONALISM AND INDEPENDENCE FROM SUPERPOWER DOMINATION, 
BUT DISTINGUISHED HIS OWN APPROACH FROM NASSER\'S IN KEY 
AREAS (PEACE WITH ISRAEL, DEMOCRACY, ECONOMIC REFORM). 
BESIDES REVISING THE VALUES OF NASSERISM, THE MUBARAK 
GOVERMENT IS TOYING WITH THE NEW \"NASSERISTS.\"  IT 
EFFECTIVELY HAS LURED THEM ABOVE GROUND BY PERMITTING 
PRE-ORGANIZATIONAL POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND PRESS 
INTERVIEWS, WHILE ARRESTING SOME ACTIVISTS AND WARNINQ AT 
LEAST ONE WOULD-BE LEADER OF THE LIMITS ON HIS 
ACTIVITIES.  THE NASSERISTS ARE THEMSELVES (UNADMITTED) 
REVISIONISTS, CLAIMING TO PROMINENT PROSPECTIVE RECRUITS 
THAT THEY HAVE DISCARDED NASSER\'S AUTHORITARIANISM. 
EVIDENTLY THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE MEMORY OF NASSER\'S 
OPPRESSION ALSO REMAINS VIVID FOR SOME. 
 
5.  NASSERISTS VS NASSERISM.  NASSER CONFIDANT AND 
CHRONICLER MOHAMMED HASSANEIN HEIKAL APTLY HAS 
CHARGED IN PUBLISHED INTERVIEWS AND PRIVATE CON- 
VERSATIONS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS \"NASSERISM, 
BUT ONLY NASSERISTS\" TAKING PERSONAL INITIATIVES. 
ABSENT THE GREAT HERO HIMSELF OR A BODY OF SEMINAL 
PUBLICATIONS TO GUIDE HIS HEIRS, NO COHERENT POLITICAL 
PHILOSOPHY EXISTS TO UNIFY THEM.  COMPETING 
NASSERISTS ARE ALLEGEDLY ACTIVE IN EACH OF THE 
ESTABLISHED POLITICAL PARTIES; THE REMNANTS OF THE 
DORMANT \"EGYPT PARTY\"; A PROSPECTIVE NEW NASSERIST 
PARTY; A NEW WEEKLY NEWSPAPER; AND EVEN AMONG 
ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS.   THE TERM \"NASSERIST\" IS 
USED LOOSELY AND DISPARAGINGLY:  THE FREE-MARKET 
WAFDISTS, LIBERALS, AND MEMBERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE 
SIDE OF THE NDP REGULARLY ACCUSE MUBARAK OF TOLER- 
ATING NASSERISTS (IF NOT OUTRIGHT MARXISTS) AMONG 
HIS SENIOR ADVISORS, USING AS EXAMPLES (WITHOUT 
EXPLANATION) OSAMA AL BAZ AND SPEAKER OF 
PARLIAMENT RIFA\'AT MAHGOUB.  THE RIGHT SUSPECTS 
NEW PM ATIF SIDQI FOR HIS PAST ASSOCIATION WITH 
NASSER THROUGH MAHGOUB.  ONE WELL-CONNECTED, INDE- 
PENDENT POLITICAL SCIENTIST CLAIMED THAT THE NASSER- 
ISTS ARE DELIBERATELY PURSUING THEIR OBJECTIVES IN 
MULTIFARIOUS CHANNELS, NOT QUITE AT ODDS WITH EACH 
OTHER BUT NOT QUITE COOPERATING EITHER, AS A 
MEANS TO EVADE GOVERNMENT PRESSURE. 
 
6.  FARID ABDEL KARIM AND THE ASNP:  THE MOST PRO- 
MINENT OF THE NASSER REVIVALISTS -- AND PERHAPS 
LEAST LIKELY TO FAIL -- IS CONTROVERSIAL LAWYER 
FARID ABDEL KARIM, THE \"DEPUTY\" OF THE NEW \"ARAB 
SOCIALIST NASSERIST PARTY\" (ASNP).  THE ASNP IS NOW 
IN THE LEGAL LIMBO DEFINED AS \"UNDER ESTABLISHMENT.\" 
THAT GIVES THE ASNP THE DISADVANTAGES OF BEING OUT 
IN THE OPEN, AND HENCE EASY MONITORING BY THE GOVERN- 
MENT -- WITHOUT THE ADVANTAGES THAT GO WITH BEING 
COMPLETELY LEGAL:  HAVING A REGULAR PUBLIC VOICE (SEE 
PARA 8), OR UNRESTRICTED ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 
ABDEL KARIM TOLD POLOFF THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO IMPORTANT 
POLITICAL FORCES IN EGYPT TODAY:  NASSERISM AND ISLAM, 
NEITHER OF WHICH ARE REPRESENTED BY POLITICAL PARTIES. 
ABDEL KARIM CLAIMS THE NASSERISTS BELIEVE IN TRUE 
DEMOCRACY, AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PERMIT 
ALL THOSE DESIRING POLITICAL PARTIES TO FORM THEM. 
IN THIS CASE, THE ISLAMIC ELEMENTS WOULD QUICKLY 
LOSE THEIR POPULARITY IN THEIR FRACTIOUSNESS.  ON 
THE OTHER HAND, THE OVERWHELMING POPULAR SUPPORT 
FOR NASSERISM -- ABDEL KARIM CLAIMS 100,000 FOUNDING 
MEMBERS -- WOULD ASSURE THE PRIMACY OF HIS PARTY. 
ABDEL KARIM SAID THE ASNP AIMS NOT TO TAKE POWER, 
BUT TO UNITE THE NASSERISTS ONLY TO LEAD THE LEGI- 
TIMATE OPPOSITION THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS.  HE PRO- 
FESSED SATISFACTION AT THE RECENT GOVERNMENT PRESSURE 
ON HIMSELF AND OTHER NASSERISTS, CLAIMING THAT THIS 
IS A POWERFUL UNIFYING FACTOR.  HE EXPLAINED THAT HE 
USES THE TITLE \"DEPUTY\" (\"WAKEEL\") -- ALTHOUGH HE 
IS THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF THE NEW PARTY, BECAUSE 
NO FORMAL ELECTION OF A PRESIDENT CAN BE HELD UNTIL 
THE PARTY EMERGES FROM \"UNDER ESTABLISHMENT.\" 
 
7.  FOREIGN POLICY:  AS IN HIS PUBLISHED INTERVIEWS, ABDEL 
KARIM MADE CLEAR THAT TWO KEY ELEMENTS OF ASNP POLICY ARE 
OPPOSITION TO U.S. \"INFLUENCE\" IN EGYPT AND TO PEACEFUL 
EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI TIES.  HE CHARGED US PRESSURE IS THE 
PRIMARY REASON THAT THE GOVERNMENT STILL HAS NOT PERMITTED 
FULL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ASNP AND HAS SUSPENDED ITS 
PUBLICATION, \"AL ISHTIRAKI\", AFTER ONLY TWO ISSUES 
(PHOTOCOPIES POUCHED INR).  NONETHELESS, HE WELCOMED THE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR A DIALOGUE, AND CLAIMED MANY PERSONAL 
FRIENDSHIPS WITH AMERICANS.  HE ALSO IMPLIED THAT HE 
OPPOSES U.S. INFLUENCE IN EGYPT PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF HIS 
MANIFEST HATRED FOR ISRAEL, RATHER THAN FOR ANY PURELY 
NATIONALIST OR IDEOLOGICAL MOTIVATION.  ABDEL KARIM DENIED 
LINKS BETWEEN THE NASSERISTS AND QADDAFI, CHARGING THAT 
QADDHAFI IS NASSERISM\'S WORST ENEMY.  HE SAID QADDHAFI 
SEEKS ALLIANCE WITH NASSERISM TO DOMINATE IT, BUT THE 
NASSERISTS REFUSE HIS BLANDISHMENTS. 
 
8.  \"SAWT AL ARAB\":  AN EXAMPLE OF THE CONFUSED AND 
COMPETING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG LEADING NASSERIST LIGHTS IS 
THE CASE OF THE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED \"SAWT AL ARAB\" 
NEWSPAPER AND ITS FOUNDER-EDITOR, ABDEL AZIM MANAF, WHO 
HAS AVOIDED EMBASSY CONTACT.  HEIKAL (FOR ONE) DENIED THAT 
\"SAWT AL ARAB\" IS A NASSERIST ORGAN, CHARGING (AS DO MANY 
OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS) THAT MANAF IS ON THE LIBYAN 
PAYROLL.  ONE OF MANAF\'S FORMER UNIVERSITY MENTORS SAID 
MANAF IS A \"FANATIC,\" BUT FIRMLY DENIED THE PREVALENT 
BELIEF THAT MANAF GETS LIBYAN FUNDING, CLAIMING SAWT AL 
ARAB IS INSTEAD SUPPORTED BY THE SONS OF NASSER.  FOR HIS 
PART, FARID ABDEL KARIM DENIES LINKS WITH MANAF OR HIS 
NEWSPAPER; HE ALSO DENIES THAT MANAF HAS POLITICAL 
CONNECTIONS WITH LIBYA OR THE SONS OF NASSER. THE OFFICE 
OF SAWT AL ARAB ALSO DENIES CONNECTIONS WITH ABDEL KARIM\'S 
ASNP, ALTHOUGH THE PAPER HEAVILY COVERS ABDEL KARIM AND 
TOUTS A NASSERIST LINE.  THE PRACTICAL BUT UNOFFICIAL LINK 
BETWEEN THE ASNP AND SAWT AL ARAB IS DARING, BECAUSE UNTIL 
THE ASNP IS FORMALLY ESTABLISHED IT MAY NOT LEGALLY 
PUBLISH A REGULAR NEWSPAPER.  MININT ZEKI BADR COULD CLOSE 
BOTH ORGANIZATIONS AT HIS PLEASURE ON THIS LEGAL BASIS. 
 
 
9.  COMMENT.  WE DETECT NO CONSENSUAL UNDERSTANDING OF 
WHAT THE TERM \"NASSERISM\" MEANS, AND NO POPULAR BASIS FOR 
A REVIVAL OF NASSERISM AS A POLITICAL MOVEMENT, 
PARTICULARLY IN THE ABSENCE OF A SIMILARLY CHARISMATIC 
NATIONAL HERO.  AS HEIKAL SUGGESTED, THE ESSENCE OF 
NASSERISM, AND THAT FOR WHICH SOME NOSTALGIA REMAINS, WAS 
THE MAN AND HIS IMAGE, RATHER THAN ANY COHERENT BODY OF 
IDEAS.  MANY PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS AND GOVERNMENT 
EMPLOYEES PROBABLY DO SHARE LEFTIST INTELLECTUALS\' 
RESENTMENT AT THE PERCEIVED U.S. PRESSURE ON MUBARAK AND 
HIS GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT ECONOMIC MEASURES THEY CONSIDER 
INIMICAL TO THEIR INTERESTS.  MANY EGYPTIANS NO DOUBT ALSO 
SHARE THE NASSERISTS\' BITTER ANTI-ISRAELI ATTITUDES, BUT 
SUCH ATTITUDES ARE ALSO HELD BY ISLAMIC OPPONENTS OF 
NASSERISM, AND DO NOT DETERMINE AN INDIVIDUAL\'S 
IDENTIFICATION AS A \"NASSERIST.\"  THE CHIEF IMPLICATION OF 
LATTER DAY NASSERISM FOR U.S. INTERESTS IS ITS POTENTIAL 
TO DIMINISH POPULAR SUPPORT, OR AT LEAST TOLERANCE, FOR 
THE ECONOMIC REFORMS REQUIRED FOR EGYPTIAN STABILITY. 
THEY LACK ORGANIZATION AND MASS APPEAL, SO THEIR 
EFFECTIVENESS IN ACTUALLY INCITING THE PEOPLE AGAINST 
ECONOMIC REFORMS PROBABLY WOULD BE ONLY MARGINALLY 
INCREASED IF THEY EVENTUALLY ARE PERMITTED TO FORM A 
LEGITIMATE PARTY (OR PARTIES) UNDER THE CURRENT INFORMAL 
LEADERSHIP.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  ESCAPE OF THREE ISLAMIC JIHAD MEMBERS FROM 
PRISON 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY.  THREE MEMBERS OF THE ISLAMIC JIHAD 
ORGANIZATION JAILED SINCE THE AFTERMATH OF THE OCTOBER 
1981 ASSASSINATION OF SADAT ESCAPED JULY 17.  THEY 
OVERPOWERED TWO GUARDS, STOLE THEIR WEAPONS AND ESCAPED 
ON MAKESHIFT ROPE LADDERS, SPARKING RUMORS THAT THEY 
HAD BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE.  THOSE 
SUSPECTED OF LINKS WITH ISLAMIC JIHAD ARE BEING ROUNDED 
UP FOR QUESTIONING, AND AN ENRAGED ZAKI BADR HAS SACKED 
A NUMBER OF HIS OFFICERS.  HOWEVER, WE ARE ALSO HEARING 
GRUMBLINGS THAT THE INTERIOR MINISTER\'S POLICY OF 
SUMMARY TRANSFERS AND OTHER PUNISHMENTS FOR MINOR 
INFRACTIONS HAS CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE OF TIMIDITY IN 
WHICH OPERATIONS SUCH AS THIS ESCAPE ARE EASIER TO PULL 
OFF.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  (U) THREE MEMBERS OF THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION 
WHO WERE IMPLICATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF ANWAR SADAT 
IN OCTOBER 1981 ESCAPED FROM THE MAXIMUM SECURITY AL 
TORAH PRISON IN CAIRO BEFORE DAWN JULY 17.  SECURITY 
FORCES SNARLED RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC IN A FRUITLESS SEARCH 
FOR THE ESCAPEES, BUT REFRAINED FROM ANY ANNOUNCEMENT 
OF THE PRISON BREAK UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON.  A BRIEF 
INTERIOR MINISTRY STATEMENT SAID THAT A SUBSTANTIAL 
REWARD WOULD BE OFFERED FOR THEIR CAPTURE.  THE THREE 
WERE IDENTIFIED AS KHAMIS MOHAMMED MOSSLAM, MOHAMMED 
MAHMOUD EL-ASWANI, AND ESAMEDDIN EL-KAMARI. 
 
 
3.  (C) AN EMBASSY SOURCE WITH EXCELLENT CONTACTS IN 
THE SECURITY FORCES SAID THAT THE THREE APPARENTLY 
ESCAPED ABOUT FIVE AM ON JULY 17, BUT THEIR ABSENCE WAS 
NOT DETECTED UNTIL A ROLL CALL SEVERAL HOURS LATER. 
THE THREE WERE HOUSED IN A SINGLE CELL FROM WHICH THEY 
ESCAPED BY PULLING OUT AN AIR VENT AND THEN 
OVERPOWERING A GUARD.  THEY TOOK HIS WEAPON AND MADE 
THEIR WAY TO THE PRISON WALLS WHERE THEY OVERCAME A 
SECOND GUARD IN THE WATCHTOWER AND THEN WENT OVER THE 
WALL USING IMPROVISED ROPE LADDERS.  CONTRARY TO PRESS 
REPORTS, OUR SOURCE SAID THAT NO SHOTS WERE FIRED, BUT 
BOTH GUARDS WERE BADLY INJURED.  THE ESCAPEES MADE OFF 
WITH THEIR SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND SOME 200 ROUNDS 
OF AMMUNITION. 
 
 
4.  (C) OUR SOURCE DESCRIBED EL-KAMARI AS BY FAR THE 
MOST DANGEROUS OF THE THREE.  HE IS A FORMER MAJOR IN 
THE ARMY\'S ELITE RANGER BATTALION AND HAS A REPUTATION 
FOR INTELLIGENCE AND RUTHLESSNESS.  HE IS BELIEVED TO 
BE THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF ISLAMIC JIHAD\'S \"MILITARY\" WING, 
BUT SINCE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE LINKING HIM DIRECTLY 
WITH SADAT\'S ASSASSINATION, HE WAS NOT GIVEN THE DEATH 
PENALTY.  MOSSLAM AND ASWANI WERE CHARGED WITH THE 
MURDER OF A POLICE OFFICER IN 1981.  OUR SOURCE SAID 
THE FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN HANDLED VERY HARSHLY BY 
AUTHORITIES AFTER THEIR ARREST HAS CONVINCED SECURITY 
FORCES THAT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RECAPTURE THEM 
WITHOUT A BATTLE.  IN AN EFFORT TO TRACE THE ESCAPEES, 
A ROUNDUP OF INDIVIDUALS KNOWN OR BELIEVED TO HAVE 
CONTACTS/SYMPATHIES WITH ISLAMIC JIHAD HAS ALREADY 
BEGUN, AS HAS THE INTERROGATION OF A JIHADIST STILL IN 
AL TORAH PRISON. 
 
 
5.  (C) THE ESCAPE OF THE THREE WILL BE A MAJOR 
EMBARRASSMENT TO INTERIOR MINISTER ZAKI BADR AFTER A 
PUBLICIZED STRING OF SUCCESSES AGAINST TERRORIST 
GROUPS.  HE MOVED IMMEDIATELY TO CASHIER THE HEAD OF 
THE PRISONS DEPARTMENT, AND OUR SECURITY SOURCE SAID 
THAT OVER TWO DOZEN OTHER OFFICERS HAVE BEEN CALLED IN 
FOR QUESTIONING OR SUSPENDED FROM THEIR DUTIES.  THE 
APPARENT EASE OF THE ESCAPE HAS ALREADY SPARKED RUMORS 
THAT THE THREE HAD ASSISTANCE FROM BOTH INSIDE AND 
OUTSIDE THE PRISON.  OUR SOURCE ADDED THAT MANY OF HIS 
CONTACTS, ALREADY DEMORALIZED BY THE INTERIOR 
MINISTER\'S AUTOCRATIC AND INTIMIDATING WAYS, ARE 
GRUMBLING THAT HIS POLICIES OF PUNISHMENT AND SUMMARY 
TRANSFER FOR THE SLIGHTEST INFRACTION HAVE CREATED AN 
ATMOSPHERE OF TIMIDITY AND DISCONTINUITY THAT HAMPERS 
THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SECURITY SERVICES.

2.  SUMMARY:  A MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) JOURNALIST 
(STRICTLY PROTECT) REPORTED TO EMBOFF THAT THE 
ORGANIZATION IS ANGERED AT THE AUTHORITIES OVER THE 
FIRST RECENT ARREST OF A \"PROMINENT MEMBER\" OF THE 
ORGANIZATION, COINCIDING WITH THE INTERIOR MINISTRY\'S 
RENEWED CRACKDOWN ON ISLAMIC GROUPS.  THE JOURNALIST 
CRITICIZED THE POLICE FOR PROVOCATIVE AND UNNECESSARY 
BRUTALITY AGAINST THE JIHADISTS AT AINS SHAMS A FEW 
DAYS PREVIOUSLY, BUT SAID THE MB MEMBERS \"HAVE ORDERS\" 
TO MAINTAIN THEIR DISTANCE FROM THE SUCH GROUPS\' 
ACTIVITIES.  THE JOURNALIST ALSO IDENTIFIED  \"EXTREMELY 
ANTI-AMERICAN\" ABDEL MONEIM SELIM HABBARA AS THE 
SUCCESSOR TO THE LATE GABIR RIZK AS THE MB\'S CHIEF 
JOURNALIST/PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER.  THE JOURNALIST 
EMPHASIZED THE MB\'S ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE FROM 
IBRAHIM SHUKRY\'S SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY (SLP, UNDER 
WHICH MB DEPUTIES WERE ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT), BUT HE 
IDENTIFIED THE MB\'S BASES OF SUPPORT WITHIN THAT 
PARTY.  HE SINGLED OUT \"AL-SHA\'AB\" (SLP NEWSPAPER) 
EDITOR ADIL HUSSEIN AS \"CLOSE\" TO THE MB AND A 
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FIGURE IN ISLAMIC POLITICS, 
COMBINING INTELLECTUAL LEADERSHIP WITH STRONG POPULAR 
CONTACT AND SUPPORT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
- 
3.  NEW MB \"SPOKESMAN\":  A VERY ACTIVE AND COMMITTED MB 
JOURNALIST (STRICTLY PROTECT) WELL KNOWN TO EMBOFFS 
COMMENTED FRANKLY ON MB-RELATED ISSUES DURING A RECENT 
VISIT TO THE EMBASSY FOR A VISA INTERVIEW.  HE REPORTED 
THAT THE MB LEADERSHIP HAD SUMMONED ABDEL MONEIM SELIM 
HABBARA FROM (EVIDENTLY SELF-IMPOSED EXILE IN) THE GULF 
TO SUCCEED THE LATE GABIR RIZK AS THE MB\'S \"LIASON\" 
OFFICER AND EDITOR OF THE MB\'S MONTHLY \"LIWA\' 
AL-ISLAM\".  THE JOURNALIST CONFIRMED THAT \"LIWA\' HAS 
REPLACED IL-DA\'AWA\" AS THE MB\'S MOUTHPIECE.  \"SELIM\" 
NOW RUNS \"LIWA\'\" FROM ITS MID-TOWN OFFICE, WHICH IS 
SEPARATE FROM THE MB HQ AT THE FORMER LOCATION OF 
\"AL-DA\'WA\".  HOWEVER, THE NAME OF BADR MOHAMMED BADR, 
NOT SELIM, WILL CONTINUE TO APPEAR ON \"LIWA\'S\" 
MASTHEAD, BECAUSE SELIM IS NOT REGISTERED WITH THE 
JOURNALISTS\' SYNDICATE AND THEREFORE IS UNLICENSED. 
SELIM IS UNLIKELY TO WELCOME CONTACT WITH U.S. 
DIPLOMATS, THE JOURNALIST SAID, BECAUSE HE IS 
EMOTIONALLY BOTH ANTI-SOVIET AND ANTI-AMERICAN.  SELIM 
IS OF THE OLDER GENERATION OF MB LEADERS, HAVING BEEN 
IN PRISON CONTINUOUSLY FROM 1954 UNTIL SADAT RELEASED 
HIM FROM HIS LIFE SENTENCE IN 1974.  HE HAD BEEN IN THE 
GULF FROM 1974 UNTIL SUMMONED BACK TO SUCCEED RIZK, 
ACCORDING TO THE JOURNALIST. 
 
- 
4.  (COMMENT: A JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR HIMSELF, RIZK HAD 
OFTEN SAT IN ON OUR CONTACTS WITH THE MB LEADERSHIP, 
AND HAD BECOME WELL KNOWN TO THE FOREIGN PRESS CORPS 
DURING THE 1987 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION CAMPAIGN AS THE 
MB \"SPOKESMAN\" AND PRESS LIAISON MAN.  SELIM HAS NOT 
YET BECOME WIDELY-KNOWN AS RIZK\'S SUCCESSOR.  THOUGH IT 
IS TOO SOON TO DISCERN WHETHER SELIM WILL PROVE AN 
ACTIVIST PR MAN, THE FACT THE AGING MB LEADERSHIP CHOSE 
A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN AND THUS FAR RECLUSIVE SUCCESSOR 
FOR THIS POST INDICATES ITS CONTINUED PREFERENCE FOR 
MATURITY AND PERSONAL LOYALTY OVER YOUTHFUL DYNAMISM OR 
PROVEN JOURNALISTIC OR PUBLIC RELATIONS SKILLS.  THIS 
MAY BE ANOTHER INDICATION OF THE GENERATIONAL SPLIT 
BETWEEN THE MORE PR-CONCIOUS, OUTWARDLY LOOKING MB 
YOUTH AND A MORE AUTHORITARIAN AND CONSPIRATORIAL OLD 
GUARD, AND THE CONTINUED UNCHALLENGED DOMINANCE OF THE 
LATTER.  END COMMENT.) 
 
- 
5.  MB-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS:  THE JOURNALIST REPORTED 
THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD ARRESTED WITHOUT CHARGE 
MOHAMMED ABDEL MONEIM, \"ONE OF OUR PROMINENT PEOPLE 
FROM ALEXANDRIA,\" AND HARRASSED THREE ACCOMPANYING MB 
FIGURES UPON THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE AIRPORT FROM A RECENT 
MB CONFERENCE IN THE FRG.  (REFTEL REPORTS FURTHER ON 
THIS INCIDENT.)  BECAUSE THEY ENJOYED PARLIAMENTARY 
IMMUNITY, PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY DEPUTIES \'ESAM EL-\'ARIAN, 
MOKHTAR NOH, AND MOHAMMED MAHDI KESHEF WERE NOT 
ARRESTED.  THE JOURNALIST SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST 
ARREST OF ONE OF THEIR SENIOR FIGURES IN RECENT TIMES. 
THE INCIDENT HAS ANGERED THE MB, HE SAID, WHICH VIEWS 
IT AS A SIGNAL OF STEPPED-UP GOVERNMENT PRESSURE ON 
THEM, PROBABLY CONNECTED TO INTERIOR MINISTER ZAKI 
BADR\'S CRACKDOWN ON THE ISLAMIC GROUPS SINCE THE ESCAPE 
OF THE JIHADISTS LAST MONTH.  AS FOR BADR, HOWEVER, THE 
MB BELIEVES ON THE BASIS OF \"RELIABLE INFORMATION\" THAT 
MUBARAK WILL DUMP HIM SOON, ONLY TO REPLACE HIM WITH 
SOMEONE \"EVEN TOUGHER, BUT MORE CLEVER.\"  FOR ITS PART, 
THE JOURNALIST CONFIRMED, THE MB CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS 
TO ESTABLISH A LEGAL POLITICAL PARTY.. 
 
- 
6.  THE JOURNALIST WENT ON TO CRITICIZE THE PROVOCATIVE 
ATTACKS OF THE POLICE ON THE ISLAMIC GROUPS, STORMING 
MOSQUES WITH THEIR BOOTS ON, FOR EXAMPLE, AS THEY HAD 
DONE AT THE JIHADISTS\' \"ADAM\" MOSQUE AT AIN SHAMS A FEW 
DAYS AGO.  SO WANTON WERE THE ARRESTS IN THAT INCIDENT, 
THE JOURNALIST ASSERTED IRONICALLY, THAT \"THREE OF OUR 
COPTIC BROTHERS WERE ARRESTED WITH THE JIHADISTS\".  THE 
RECKLESS POLICE ACTION, RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF 
CHILD, HAD PROVOKED NEIGHBORHOOD SYMPATHY FOR THE 
JIHADISTS, HE SAID.  THE MB CONDEMNS SUCH POLICE 
OPPRESSION AGAINST THE ISLAMIC GROUPS, THE JOURNALIST 
SAID, BUT ALSO \"DISAPPROVES OF VIOLENCE\" (BY SUCH 
GROUPS); THE MB LEADERSHIP HAS ISSUED \"STRICT ORDERS TO 
STAY AWAY FROM UPRISINGS AND ACTIVITIES\" OF THE ISLAMIC 
GROUPS. 
 
- 
7.  MB AMBIVALENCE TOWARD U.S.:  THE JOURNALISTS SAID 
THE MB LEADERSHIP HAD DECLINED TO NOMINATE AN MB MEMBER 
OF THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY AS ONE OF TWO SLP MEMBERS 
INVITED TO JOIN A PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION TO THE U.S., 
SIMPLY BECAUSE THE USG HAD NOT ADDRESSED AN INVITATION 
TO THE MB DIRECTLY AND FORMALLY.  EVIDENTLY UNCONSCIOUS 
OF ANY IRONY, THE JOURNALIST STATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE 
MB LEADERSHIP AT THE SAME TIME REMAINS WARY OF ANY 
OFFICIAL CONTACTS OR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE USG IN 
CONNECTION WITH MB TRAVEL TO THE U.S.  HE REMARKED THAT 
MB MEMBERS OFTEN VISIT THE U.S. AT THE INVITATION OF 
ISLAMIC GROUPS THERE.  (COMMENT: EMBASSY HAD INVITED 
SLP LEADER AND OPPOSITION SPEAKER IBRAHIM SHUKRY TO 
NOMINATE TWO SLP DEPUTIES OF HIS CHOICE TO PARTICIPATE 
IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION INVITED TO THE U.S. BY 
A PRIVATE U.S. ORGANIZATION.  EMBASSY EXPRESSED NO 
OBJECTION TO SHUKRY\'S INITIAL INQUIRY WHETHER MB 
MEMBERS COULD BE NOMINATED.  SHUKRY LATER ADVISED US 
THAT THE MB HAD DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE, WITHOUT 
OFFERING A REASON.  END COMMENT.) 
 
- 
8.  THE JOURNALIST FURTHER EMPHASIZED THE MB\'S 
ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE FROM THE SLP, BUT SAID THAT 
FOUR FIGURES IN THE SLP LEADERSHIP ARE STRONG 
SUPPORTERS OF COOPERATION WITH THE MB:  SLP CHAIRMAN 
SHUKRY, HIS DEPUTY HILMY MURAD, PARTY ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY FOR YOUTH MAGDY HUSSEIN,  AND SLP NEWSPAPER 
EDITORIALIST \'ADIL HUSSEIN.  (COMMENT: MAGDY HUSSEIN 
RETURNED TO EGYPT VERY FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY HIS VISIT 
TO THE U.S. IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION.  HILMY 
MURAD -- WHO PERIODICALLY \"RESIGNS\"  FROM HIS PARTY 
POST PURPORTEDLY IN PROTEST OF ANTI-DEMOCRATIC 
GOVERNMENT POLICIES -- HAD PRIVATELY INDICATED TO US 
STRONGLY SECULARIST, ANTI-MB VIEWS AT THE OUTSET OF THE 
SLP-MB ALLIANCE IN 1987.  THE FOUR SLP FIGURES CITED 
ARE RELATED BY BLOOD AND/OR MARRIAGE TO EACH OTHER AND 
TO THE LATE AHMED HUSSEIN, ISLAMIC/NAZI FIREBRAND OF 
THE 1930\'S AND 40\'S.  END COMMENT.)  FURTHERMORE, THE 
JOURNALIST SAID, THE MB ENJOYS STRONG SUPPORT AMONG THE 
YOUNGER SLP CADRES.  HOWEVER, THE MB FACES STRONG 
ANTAGONISM FROM THE \"MIDDLE RANKS\" OF THE OLD-TIME SLP 
MEMBERSHIP, WHICH INCLUDES \"NASSERISTS AND 
COMMUNISTS,\"  AND OTHERS, SUCH AS PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY 
MEMBER DR. SALAH ABDULLAH, WHO MERELY \"DON\'T SUPPORT 
THE ISLAMIC TREND VERY MUCH.\"  (COMMENT: JOURNALIST 
IMPLIED CONFIDENCE OF THE MB THAT ITS SUPPORT FROM THE 
TOP SLP LEADERSHIP AND THE YOUNGER ISLAMIC CADRES 
EVENTUALLY WOULD PREVAIL OVER THE LEFTIST SECULARIST 
ELEMENTS.  END COMMENT.) 
 
- 
9.  \'ADIL HUSSEIN:  RESPONDING TO EMBOFF\'S OBSERVATION 
THAT MANY OUTSIDERS QUESTION \'ADIL HUSSEIN\'S RELIGIOUS 
SINCERITY IN VIEW OF HIS PAST AS A MARXIST, THE 
JOURNALIST VIGOROUSLY ASSERTED THAT HUSSEIN HAD 
EXPERIENCED A PROFOUND CONVERSION AS A RESULT OF HIS 
NEAR-DEATH UNDER SEVERE TORTURE WHILE IN PRISON, WHERE 
HE HAD COME TO KNOW MB MEMBERS.  THE JOURNALIST CLAIMED 
THAT \'ADIL HUSSEIN IS NOT MERELY AN INTELLECTUAL OR 
IDEOLOGUE, BUT HAS GOOD RAPPORT WITH ORDINARY PEOPLE, 
ENJOYING GREAT POPULARITY AMONG YOUTH.  HOWEVER, 
HUSSEIN IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE MB, \"THOUGH HE IS VERY 
CLOSE TO US.\"  (COMMENT: HUSSEIN IS INFAMOUS AS THE 
LEADING PROPONENT OF AN AMALGAMATION OF 
NASSERISM/MARXISM AND ISLAM, THROUGH HIS AUTHORSHIP OF 
BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT AND HIS WEEKLY, HIGHLY POLEMICAL 
EDITORIALS IN THE SLP\'S \"IL-SHA\'AB\".  END COMMENT.)

2.  SUMMARY:  TENSIONS SIMMERING BETWEEN THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD (MB) AND A MORE EXTREME GROUP  ERUPTED INTO 
A BLOODY CLASH IN ASSYUT IN LATE JULY.  (THE EXTREMISTS 
WERE IDENTIFIED BOTH AS \"AL-JIHAD\" AND AS \"AL-GAMA\'A 
AL-ISLAMIYA\", OR THE ISLAMIC GROUPING, SINGULAR.)  THE 
INTRA-ISLAMIC VIOLENCE IN ASSYUT PROVOKED SHAME AMONG 
SOME ISLAMIC POLITICAL ACTIVISTS AND REVULSION AMONG 
THE PUBLIC AT LARGE.  THE CLASH APPEARED TO BE MOSTLY A 
CASE OF YOUTHFUL THUGGERY, MIXED WITH A FUNDAMENTAL 
DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCE OVER THE ACCEPTABILITY OF WORKING 
WITHIN A NON-ISLAMIC SYSTEM TO BRING ABOUT ISLAMIC 
GOALS.  THOUGH THE MB SUPREME GUIDE AND ONE LEADER OF 
THE EXTREMISTS PERSONALLY CAME TO A PEACEFUL 
UNDERSTANDING, THEY MANAGED BARELY TO PAPER OVER THE 
CONTINUING FRICTIONS, BASED ON MUTUALLY HOSTILE 
PERCEPTIONS:  THE MB REGARD THE \"JIHADISTS\" AS ERRANT 
AND IGNORANT YOUTH AT BEST, WHILE THE LATTER CHARGE THE 
MB WITH COWARDICE AND \"FORBIDDEN\" COLLABORATION WITH 
THE SECULAR STATE.  MEANWHILE, THE INCIDENT HAS EXPOSED 
AN APPARENT RIVALRY BETWEEN THE MB AND THE JIHAD FOR 
LEADERSHIP OF \"AL-GAMA\'A AL ISLAMIYA\".  END SUMMARY. 
 
- 
3.  ACCORDING TO UNUSUALLY WELL-DONE PRESS ACCOUNTS 
(SEE LAST PARA), THE MB AND THE EXTREMIST \"JIHAD\" GROUP 
(OFTEN IDENTIFIED BY THE PRESS AS \"AL-GAMA\'A 
AL-ISLAMIYA\", OF WHICH AL-JIHAD, HOWEVER, PROBABLY IS 
JUST ONE CONSTITUENT PART) HAD BEEN CIRCULATING 
LEAFLETS AGAINST EACH OTHER OVER SOME NINE MONTHS IN 
THE UPPER EGYPTIAN PROVINCIAL CAPITAL OF ASSYUT. 
HANDBILLS SIGNED \"AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYA\" CHARGED THE MB 
ARE COWARDS, WHO USED TO ATTACK MINOR OFFICIALS, AND 
THEN DENIED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS (IN 
CONTRAST TO THE JIHAD, WHICH STOOD UP FOR ITS 
ASSASSINATION OF SADAT).  THEY CHARGED THAT THE MB 
\"HATE TO SEE \'ISLAM\' EMERGE, EXCEPT FROM THEIR 
THROATS.\"  IT CALLED THEM \"TRAINED CIRCUS LIONS\" FOR 
ENTERING THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY, THEREBY COLLABORATING 
WITH A GOVERNMENT SEEN AS ISLAMICALLY ILLEGITIMATE.  IN 
TURN, THE MB\'S LEAFLETS INSULTINGLY DISMISSED 
AL-JIHAD\", AND ITS PRETENSIONS TO LEADERSHIP OF 
AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYA,  AS \"LITTLE ONES. . . WHO HAS 
LED THEM ASTRAY?\"

OF UPCOMING HOLIDAY PRAYER MEETINGS.  THE POSTER WAR 
WAS RENEWED A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE LARGER FEAST OF THE 
SACRIFICE (JULY 24-25).  AROUND THE SAME TIME, GANGS OF 
MB AND JIHADISTS REPORTEDLY USED MACHO INTIMIDATION 
TECHNIQUES REMINISCENT OF WEST SIDE STORY, INCLUDING 
MOTORCYCLE-MOUNTED MB YOUTHS AND SWITCHBLADE-WIELDING 
JIHADISTS.  AN MB LEADER TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT THE 
JIHADISTS PROVOKED THE CULMINATING RUMBLE OF JULY 23 BY 
CLAIMING \"OUR (JIHADIST) WOMEN HAVE MORE VIRILITY THAN 
THEIR (MB) MEN.\"  IN UPPER EGYPT, THOSE ARE FIGHTING 
WORDS THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED. 
 
- 
5.  ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIVE PRESS REPORTS, 
VIOLENCE FINALLY BROKE OUT ON THE EVE OF THE FEAST OF 
THE SACRIFICE, AS MB YOUTHS WERE PREPARING SWEETS FOR 
CHILDRENS\' HOLIDAY GIFTS IN THEIR MOSQUE OF SHALNAB. 
MORE THAN 150 YOUTHS OF THE GAMA\'A SEALED OFF THE 
STREET, AND SHOUTED TO BYSTANDERS THAT \"POLICE\" INSIDE 
THE MOSQUE WERE PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM ENTERING TO 
PRAY.  THEN THEY INVADED THE MOSQUE, AND OVER THE 
COURSE OF ABOUT 30 MINUTES DESTROYED ITS FURNITURE AND 
WINDOWS, KNIFING THE YOUTHS INSIDE AND BEATING THEM 
WITH CHAINS.  13 MB AND BYSTANDERS WERE INJURED.  THE 
ATTACKERS FLED BEFORE POLICE ARRIVED BUT SEVEN WERE 
LATER ARRESTED, ACCORDING TO POLICE RECORDS REPORTED BY 
THE PRESS.  ONE NEUTRAL BYSTANDER TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT 
HE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH VIOLENCE IN HIS LIFE -- \"EVEN 
THE JEWS AND NASSERISTS COULD NOT DO ANYTHING LIKE 
THIS|\"  THE LOCAL POLICE PASSED UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
GLOAT, TELLING REPORTERS ONLY THAT \"IT IS NOT IN THE 
INTERESTS OF (PUBLIC) SECURITY THAT THERE BE CONFLICT 
BETWEEN THE MB AND THE JIHAD.\" 
 
- 
6.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, IN THE IMMEDIATE 
AFTERMATH OF THE CLASH THE MB LEADERSHIP REJECTED 
RECONCILIATION INITIATIVES BY \"AL-GAMA\'IYA 
AL-SHAR\'IYA\", WIDELY-KNOWN AS AN OFFICIALLY-REGISTERED 
AND ESTABLISHMENTARIAN GROUPING OF SOME 2,000 MOSQUES 
ENGAGED IN SOCIAL SERVICES.  THE FOLLOWING WEEK, 
HOWEVER, DR. \'OMAR \'ABDURRAHMAN, IDENTIFIED IN THE 
SYMPATHETIC RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION PRESS AS \"AMIR 
(PRINCE) OF AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYA,\" SPOKE FROM SAUDI 
ARABIA BY PHONE WITH MB SUPREME GUIDE ABUL NASR. 
ACCORDING TO THE \"SPOKESMAN\" OF THE GAMA\'A,  DR. \'ALA\' 
MOHI AL-DIN, \'ABDURRAHMAN ORDERED THE GROUP TO SHOW 
\"SELF DISCIPLINE\".  OTHER LEADING RADICAL RELIGIOUS 
FIGURES, INCLUDING ALEXANDRIA\'S AHMED AL-MEHALLAWI, 
ALSO INTERVENED.  THE STAGE WAS THUS SET FOR THE 
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF RECONCILIATION AT THE MOSQUE 
OF AL-GAMA\'IYA AL-SHAR\'IYA IN ASSYUT AUGUST 5. 
(DESPITE ITS REPORTED ROLE IN THE MB-JIHAD 
RECONCILIATION, HOWEVER, THE NATIONAL LEADER OF 
AL-GAMA\'IYA AL-SHAR\'IYA, TOLD US THAT HIS GROUP HAS NO 
CONNECTION, PERSONAL OR OFFICIAL, WITH EITHER THE MB OR 
THE GAMA\'A.) 
 
- 
7.  SINCE THEN, WESTERN JOURNALISTS WHO INTERVIEWED 
JIHAD/GAMA\'A MEMBERS INVOLVED IN THE AIN SHAMS INCIDENT 
IN CAIRO OF AUGUST 12-13, TOLD US THAT THE TENSIONS 
BETWEEN THE MB AND RADICALS CLEARLY REMAIN.  THE HEART 
OF THE ISSUE SEEMS TO BE THE MB\'S RESENTMENT OF THE 
JIHAD\'S ASSERTION OF A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITHIN WHAT 
APPEARS TO BE A KIND OF UMBRELLA GROUPING OF AL-GAMA\'A 
AL-ISLAMIYA.  THE JOURNALISTS TOLD US THE YOUTHS 
EVIDENTLY SOUGHT DELIBERATELY TO OBSCURE THEIR GROUP\'S 
IDENTITY OR RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT OF THE AL-GAMA\'A 
AL-ISLAMIYA.  ALSO, THOUGH THE MB\'S \'ESAM AL-\'ARIAN 
CONFIRMED TO EMBOFF THAT THE MB AND JIHAD WERE 
RECONCILED\", HE BROKE THE ISLAMICISTS\' NORMALLY 
MAFIA-LIKE CODE OF SILENCE TO PROVIDE SOME DETAILS 
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ISLAMIC GROUPS. 
(SEPARATE REPORT WILL FOLLOW AS WE SORT OUT CONFLICTING 
DETAILS.)  AL-\'ARIAN WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO EMPHASIZE 
THAT THE JIHAD\'S CLAIM TO LEADERSHIP OF AL-GAMA\'A IS 
BOGUS.  HE BLAMED POLICE OPPRESSION OF THE JIHAD FOR 
TURNING THEM INTO POPULAR HEROES, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT 
FAILS TO DISTINGUISH THE MB FROM THE VIOLENT GROUPS. 
 
- 
8.  COMMENT:  THE BLOODY ASSYUT CLASH CLEARLY HAS 
EMBARRASSED SOME OF OUR CONTACTS AMONG ISLAMIC 
POLITICAL ACTIVISTS BECAUSE OF ITS UGLY AND 
\"UN-ISLAMIC\" VIOLENCE.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE SENSE 
UNHAPPINESS IN ISLAMIC POLITICAL QUARTERS OVER THE 
INCIDENT\'S EXPOSURE OF BITTER DIVISIONS IN ISLAMIC 
POLITICAL RANKS -- AND HENCE, SOME CLUES TO ITS SHADOWY 
ORGANIZATION.  IN FACT, AL-NUR, THE SYMPATHETIC 
RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION PAPER THAT MOST FULLY OUTLINED THE 
STORY, REPORTED THAT HENCEFORTH IT WILL COMPLY WITH THE 
WRITTEN REQUESTS OF BOTH PARTIES TO AVOID PUBLISHING 
FURTHER ON THE ASSYUT INCIDENT. 
 
9.  MEANWHILE, THERE IS NO INDICATION YET THAT THE 
FORMAL MB-JIHAD RECONCILIATION HAS TAKEN DEEP ROOT, OR 
THAT THEIR RIVALRY WILL DEVELOP SOON INTO COOPERATION. 
WITH THE JIHAD LEADERSHIP AND MANY OF ITS \"FEW\" CADRES 
IN PRISON, ACCORDING TO SEVERAL SOURCES, THE MB WOULD 
SEEM TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND.  WHAT REMAINS UNCLEAR IS 
THE EXACT ORGANIZATIONAL NATURE OF THE \"GAMA\'A 
AL-ISLAMIYA\", AND THE ROLE OF THE MB AND OTHER GROUPS 
WITHIN IT.  THE ASSYUT INCIDENT, HOWEVER, HAS SHED SOME 
LIGHT ON THE SHADOWY RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE GROUPS, AND 
OVER THE COMING MONTHS WE WILL BE TRYING TO EXPLOIT 
SOME NEW LEADS TO TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF THESE TIES. 
 
- 
10.  FOR MORE DETAILED REPORTS OF THE ASSYUT INCIDENT, 
WE CALL ANALYSTS\' ATTENTION TO CENTER-LEFTIST, 
SECULARIST ESTABLISHMENT WEEKLY \"ROSE EL-YUSUF\" OF 
AUGUST 22 AND MODERATE ISLAMIC OPPOSITION WEEKLY 
\"AL-NUR\" OF AUGUST 3 AND AUGUST 10.  AL-NUR 
INVESTIGATIVE ARTICLES ARE STARTLINGLY UNUSUAL AS 
EGYPTIAN JOURNALISM, STRIVING FOR OBJECTIVITY BY NAMING 
SOURCES AND DESCRIBING THE INCIDENT FROM THE DIFFERING 
VIEWPOINTS OF THE MB, JIHAD, POLICE, AND INNOCENT 
BYSTANDERS.  ARTICLES PROVIDE MB AND JIHAD/GAMA\'A LOGOS 
FROM THEIR PAMPHLETS, AND PUBLISH PHOTOS AND NAMES OF 
INDIVIDUALS AND MOSQUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIOUS 
ISLAMIC GROUPS IN ASSYUT.

SUBJECT: MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD:  DEFANGED BUT REHABILITATED 
 
REF:  FBIS JN2505152689 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  TWO YEARS AGO, MUBARAK BET THAT BY 
ADMITTING THE OUTLAWED MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) TO THE 
PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY, THE GROUP WOULD BE COOPTED AND THUS 
UNDERMINED AS THE CATALYST OF AN ISLAMIC OPPOSITION 
MOVEMENT.  NOW, THE BET IS PAYING OFF: THE MB HAS 
GAINED IN STATUS IN THE RAREFIED ESTABLISHMENT 
POLITICAL ARENA, BUT HAS BEEN DEFANGED AS A THREAT TO 
THE REGIME.  EXTERNAL AND DOMESTIC FACTORS ALSO HAVE 
HELPED DIMINISH ANXIETY OVER THE MB IN PARTICULAR AND 
REVOLUTIONARY ISLAM IN GENERAL:  THE FAILURE OF ISLAMIC 
GOVERNMENT IN IRAN; THE COLLAPSE OF THE \"ISLAMIC\" 
INVESTMENT COMPANIES; DISSENSION BETWEEN THE MB AND ITS 
OPPOSITION PARTNERS AND MORE EXTREME ISLAMIC RIVALS; 
AND A STRING OF MB PROGRAM FAILURES UNDER A GERIATRIC 
LEADERSHIP.  YET, THE MB ALSO HAS BENEFITED FROM 
PLAYING THE REGIME\'S GAME:  IN PART, THE REHABILITATION 
OF THE MB IS A STRATEGIC SUCCESS OF THEIR OWN ATTEMPT 
TO APPEAR RESPONSIBLE AND ESTABLISHMENTARIAN.  THAT 
THEY AIM CLEARLY AT THE POLITICAL CENTER IS CLEAR FROM 
THEIR MOST RECENT, REMARKABLY MODERATE-SOUNDING 
PLATFORM.  THUS, THEY MAY BE SUCCEEDING IN TRANSFORMING 
FROM A PERCEIVED POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY FORCE INTO A 
MORE SUBTLE BUT STILL SUBSTANTIAL THREAT TO THE 
REGIME:  A POTENTIALLY PLAUSIBLE, \"MODERATE\" CIVILIAN 
ALTERNATIVE.  THOUGH THEY ARE STILL FAR FROM ACHIEVING 
SUCH A DEGREE OF CREDIBILITY, WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE, 
DISCIPLINE, MONEY, LINGERING POPULARITY, AND YOUNGER 
TALENT WAITING RESPECTFULLY IN THE WINGS, THE MB SEEM 
THE OPPOSITION ELEMENT MOST LIKELY TO ENDURE IN 
EGYPTIAN POLITICS.  MOREOVER, IT IS NOT YET CLEAR 
WHETHER THE MB HAVE DETERMINED TO STAY WITHIN THE 
SYSTEM.  MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNMENT REMAINS A FAR MORE 
INFLUENTIAL FORCE THAN THE MB OR ANY OTHER POLITICAL 
GROUP IN THE BROADER, CULTURAL RELIGIOUS REAWAKENING. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
REHABILITATION FOR REGIME PURPOSES 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  LEGAL LIMBO:  OVER ITS 60 YEARS OF EXISTENCE, THE 
MB HAS USUALLY SPRAWLED MORE (BUT NOT ENTIRELY) TO ONE 
SIDE OR THE OTHER OF THE AMBIGUOUS DIVISION BETWEEN 
UNDERGROUND AND ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS.  TODAY, IT IS 
ALL BUT COMPLETELY INTO THE MAINSTREAM POLITICAL ARENA, 
FORSWEARING UNDERGROUND ACTIVITY AND POSSESSING ALL THE 
EARMARKS AND ACTIVITIES OF A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL PARTY 
EXCEPT THE OFFICIAL LICENSE TO CALL ITSELF ONE.  THE MB 
MAINTAINS THAT THE 1954 DECREE DISSOLVING IT WAS LATER 
RESCINDED.  THE GROUP CONTINUES TO SLOG ALONG WITH AN 
ARRAY OF LEGAL CASES AIMED AT GAINING FORMAL PARTY 
STATUS AND RECOVERING VARIOUS SUSPENDED PUBLISHING 
LICENSES.  AT THE SAME TIME, INTERIOR MINISTER ZAKI 
BADR LOSES NO OPPORTUNITY TO PROCLAIM THE MB IS 
ILLEGAL, CRIMINAL, SUBVERSIVE -- AND DOES NOT EVEN 
EXIST; IF IT DID EXIST, ITS MEMBERS SHOULD BE IN JAIL, 
NOT STANDING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE. 
 
 
4.  POLITICAL PAWNS:  SADAT BEGAN THE MB\'S 
REHABILITATION WHEN, IN THE MID-1970S, HE RELEASED 
THOSE OLDTIME MB PERSONALITIES WHO HAD SURVIVED 
NASSER\'S PRISONS.  HIS OBJECTIVE WAS TO HELP ESTABLISH 
HIS CREDENTIALS AS THE \"BELIEVER PRESIDENT\", AIMING TO 
USE ISLAM TO CRUSH THE REMNANTS OF LEFTIST INFLUENCE. 
MUBARAK FURTHER EXPANDED THE MB\'S ACCESS TO 
ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS BY ALLOWING ABOUT SIX OF THEM TO 
BE ELECTED TO THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY UNDER THE 
OPPOSITION WAFD PARTY IN 1984.  ZAKI BADR\'S VIEWS 
NOTWITHSTANDING, IN 1987, MUBARAK ALLOWED ABOUT 35 MB 
DEPUTIES TO BE OPENLY IDENTIFIED AND ELECTED AS SUCH 
(WITH ONLY THE THINNEST OF LEGAL COVERS AS TECHNICAL 
MEMBERS OF THE SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY).  MUBARAK\'S 
MOTIVES WERE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM SADAT\'S: UNDER HIS 
CONCEPT OF \"DEMOCRACY\" (ESSENTIALLY MEANING FREEDOM OF 
SPEECH) AS A \"SAFETY VALVE\", HE EVIDENTLY CALCULATED 
THAT THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY THREAT PERCEIVED IN 
THOSE TIMES WOULD PROVE MORE MANAGEABLE ABOVE GROUND, 
WITH THE MB AS THE PRINCIPAL VOICE OF POLITICAL ISLAM. 
OVER TWO YEARS AFTER MUBARAK WAS ACCUSED OF A DANGEROUS 
GAMBLE, IT APPEARS THAT THE CALCULATIONS BEHIND HIS BET 
WERE CORRECT. 
 
 
5.  DE FACTO PARTY: TODAY, THE MB RECEIVE FOREIGN 
DIPLOMATS AND JOURNALISTS -- WITHOUT THE ADVANCE 
APPROVAL OF THE INTERIOR MINISTRY UPON WHICH THEY USED 
TO INSIST AS RECENTLY AS 1986 -- AND CONDUCT OTHER 
ORDINARY POLITICAL PARTY BUSINESS AT A WELL-KNOWN HQ IN 
DOWNTOWN CAIRO.  THEY PUBLISH A MONTHLY MAGAZINE (LIWA\' 
AL-ISLAM, THE BANNER OF ISLAM) AND HAVE DIRECT ACCESS 
TO SEVERAL OTHER INDEPENDENT MONTHLIES AND WEEKLIES 
(AL-\'ETISAM, AL-MOKHTAR AL-ISLAMI, AL-NUR, AL-SHAAB). 
MB MEMBERS ALSO ARE IDENTIFIED AS SUCH ON THE BOARDS OF 
THE PHYSICIANS AND JOURNALISTS\' SYNDICATES AND, UNTIL 
RECENTLY, THE LAWYERS\' SYNDICATE.  THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL 
RECOGNITION OF THE MB AS A POLITICAL PARTY REMAINS 
THEIR IDENTITY AS AN INDEPENDENT GROUP IN THE PEOPLE\'S 
ASSEMBLY UNDER THEIR OWN DELEGATION LEADER, FORMER 
SENIOR JUDGE MA\'MUN AL-HODEIBY (SON OF AN EARLY SUPREME 
GUIDE).  THE MB NOW ARE THE LARGEST (THERE ARE ABOUT 
33) AND CERTAINLY THE MOST COHESIVE BLOC OF OPPOSITION 
DEPUTIES IN THE ASSEMBLY.  MOREOVER, THE MB AND THE 
CENTER-RIGHT, RELATIVELY SECULAR NATIONALIST WAFD, ARE 
THE ONLY TWO LEGAL OPPOSITION GROUPINGS WITH ANY PROVEN 
HISTORIC STAYING POWER AND SIGNIFICANT POPULAR 
FOLLOWING FROM ASWAN TO ALEXANDRIA. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
GETTING MIRED IN THE MAINSTREAM 
------------------------------- 
 
6.   JOINING THE OPPOSITION DOLDRUMS:  THIS STATUS, 
HOWEVER, REMAINS FAR FROM SATISFACTORY TO THE MB.  AS 
IS TRUE FOR ALL EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION GROUPINGS, THE MB\'S 
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ACCESS TO THE MEDIA AND ASSEMBLY 
DO NOT CONSTITUTE GENUINE POLITICAL ENFRANCHISEMENT. 
LACKING THE RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY\'S (NDP) 
ACCESS TO THE STATE BUREAUCRACY AND ITS ABILITY TO 
DISTRIBUTE JOBS, EDUCATION, HOUSING, AND OTHER GOODS 
AND SERVICES, THE MB (OR ANY OTHER OPPOSITION GROUPING) 
IS UNLIKELY EVER TO BE VOTED INTO POWER, EVEN IF THE 
INTERIOR MINISTRY WERE TO PERMIT GENUINE ELECTIONS. 
THE MB AND OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES CAN OFFER ONLY 
SLOGANS; THE RULING PARTY -- ANY RULING PARTY -- OFFERS 
TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. 
 
7.  DEFANGING:  THUS, AS THE REGIME MUST HAVE HOPED, 
THE MB\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE FORMAL POLITICAL \"SYSTEM\" 
OF THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS DEFANGED THE GROUP AS THE 
PRETENDERS TO LEADERSHIP OF A NEW ISLAMIC ERA:  IN THE 
ASSEMBLY AND IN THEIR PRESS, THEY HAVE LOOKED AND 
SOUNDED MUCH LIKE THE OTHER OPPOSITION POLITICAL 
PARTIES; THEY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED NO MORE THAN THE 
OTHERS, AND HAVE PROVED NO MORE OF A THREAT TO THE 
AUTHORITY OF THE STATE.  IN SUM, EVEN EGYPTIAN 
SECULARISTS AND CHRISTIANS NO LONGER LIVE IN IMMEDIATE 
DREAD OF THE MB.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE ISLAMICISTS 
HAVE SHOWN GREATER INDEPENDENCE OF THE MB: NOW IN THE 
LEGITIMATE POLITICAL THEATRE THERE ARE A GAGGLE OF MORE 
PROMINENT ISLAMIC \"INDEPENDENTS\", AND A NEW (MORE OR 
LESS FRIENDLY) RIVAL PARTY IN THE ISLAMIC WING OF THE 
BELEAGUERED SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY. 
 
 
------------------------------ 
EBBING OF REVOLUTIONARY ISLAM? 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  EXTERNAL FACTORS -- IRAN:  THE DEFLATION OF THE 
PERCEIVED THREAT FROM THE MB TAKES PLACE IN THE BROADER 
CONTEXT OF A RELAXATION OF PERCEPTIONS OF A THREAT FROM 
REVOLUTIONARY ISLAM IN GENERAL.  THE MB, LIKE EGYPT\'S 
OTHER ISLAMIC POLITICIANS, EVIDENTLY FAILED IN THEIR 
ATTEMPTS TO PICK AND CHOOSE ONLY THOSE ASPECTS OF 
KHOMEINISM WITH WHICH THEY WISHED TO BE ASSOCIATED. 
EVEN THOSE EGYPTIANS WHO PERCEIVE AND RESENT WESTERN 
CULTURAL OR POLITICAL DOMINATION SEEM MORE REVOLTED BY 
THE ISLAMIC \"ALTERNATIVE\" MODELED BY \"HANGING JUDGE\" 
KHAMENEI, THE NEAR-HERESY AND VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH 
SHI\'ISM, AND, PERHAPS MOST OF ALL, IRAN\'S PERCEIVED 
\"LOSS\" OF THE WAR WITH IRAQ.  \"NEITHER EAST NOR WEST\" 
-- A KHOMEINI SLOGAN BORROWED BY THE MB FOR ITS 1987 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN -- HAS A SUPERFICIAL APPEAL TO BOTH 
LEFTIST AND ISLAMICIST INTELLECTUALS, BUT EVEN THEY 
JOIN THE MASSES IN SETTING THE WEST AND EAST ON VERY 
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FRIENDSHIP AND ATTRACTION: FOR THE 
VAST MAJORITY OF EGYPTIANS, THE WEST IS NO SATAN AND 
THE EAST IS NO FRIEND.  THUS, EXCEPT AMONG THE 
COMMITTED MINORITY, THE APPEAL OF POLITICAL ISLAM IN 
EGYPT HAS FALLEN WITH ITS FORTUNES IN IRAN. 
 
9.  DOMESTIC SETBACKS:  OTHER UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS 
HAVE ADDED TO THE MB\'S MISFORTUNES.  MOST 
SIGNIFICANTLY, THE CRASH OF THE ISLAMIC PONZI SCHEMES 
IN 1988 DEALT A SHATTERING BLOW TO THE ATTRACTION OF 
POLITICAL ISLAM TO THE LITTLE MAN, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT 
SOMEHOW HAS MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE ANTICIPATED BACKLASH 
FROM THE THOUSANDS OF RUINED SMALL INVESTORS.  AS 
RECOGNIZED CAPITALISTS, THE MB PERHAPS UNFAIRLY WAS 
IDENTIFIED WITH THESE COMPANIES; IT HAD KNOWN CLOSE 
TIES ONLY TO \"SHERIF\", THE MOST LEGITIMATE OF THE 
\"ISLAMIC\" COMPANIES AND THE ONLY ONE THAT SEEMS TO HAVE 
SURVIVED.  MOREOVER, THE ONGOING, BITTER FACTIONALISM 
THAT SHATTERED THE SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY THIS SPRING 
WAS WIDELY BLAMED ON THE INFECTION OF POLITICAL ISLAM 
IN GENERAL, AND ON THE SLP\'S DALLIANCE WITH THE MB IN 
PARTICULAR.  MEANWHILE, OVER THE PAST YEAR AND ONE 
HALF, THE MB HAS FACED SHARP, SOMETIMES EVEN VIOLENT 
ATTACK FROM ITS MORE EXTREME RIVALS FOR LEADERSHIP OF 
POLITICAL ISLAM. 
 
10.  FAILURES:  FINALLY, THE MB HAS HAD A STRING OF 
PROGRAM FAILURES, PROBABLY AT LEAST PARTLY DUE TO THE 
AGING LEADERSHIP\'S INABILITY TO CUT DEALS WITH STRONGER 
ADVERSARIES.  THE MB LOST ITS TWO SEATS ON THE BOARD OF 
THE LAWYERS\' SYNDICATE.  THEY FAILED TO NEGOTIATE WITH 
THE GOVERNMENT EVEN A TOKEN SEAT IN THE SHURA COUNCIL 
ELECTIONS AND APPOINTMENTS.  MOREOVER, AS THE 
SECULARISTS ARE CROWING, THE MB HAVE LITTLE IN THE WAY 
OF TANGIBLE ISLAMIC ACHIEVEMENT TO SHOW FOR THEIR TWO 
YEARS IN PARLIAMENT:  THE MOST ONE MB DEPUTY COULD 
CLAIM WAS SUCCESS IN \"PRESENTING ISLAMIC IDEAS WITH 
CLARITY.\"  IN PRIVATE, THE MB LEADERS ARE FAR MORE 
DISGRUNTLED.  WE EXPECT THAT MANY IN THE MB WILL BE 
REASSESSING THEIR STRATEGY OF PLAYING WITHIN THE 
SYSTEM -- ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE INSULT AND INJURY 
THEY SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE REGIME DURING THE 
SHURA COUNCIL ELECTIONS. 
 
 
------------------------ 
WHOSE STRATEGIC SUCCESS? 
------------------------ 
 
11.  DE-RADICALIZATION:  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MB\'S 
PRESENT UNTHREATENING PUBLIC IMAGE MAY REPRESENT AS 
IMPORTANT A STRATEGIC SUCCESS FOR THEM AS FOR THE 
SECULAR STATE.  IF MUBARAK HAS WON HIS OBJECTIVE OF 
DEFLATING THE REVOLUTIONARY THREAT FROM THE MB AND 
EXTREMIST POLITICAL ISLAM, THE MB ALSO HAS COME FAR 
TOWARD ITS GOAL OF LOOKING MODERATE, RESPONSIBLE, AND 
ESTABLISHMENTARIAN.  SINCERE OR NOT, THE MB LEADERS\' 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS REITERATE THE GROUP\'S REJECTION OF 
ASSOCIATION WITH KHOMEINISM, EGYPTIAN RADICAL GROUPS, 
VIOLENCE, OR EVEN URGENCY IN THE ISLAMIC REFORMS FOR 
WHICH THEY CALL.  THUS, WHILE EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION 
PARTIES MARCH LEMMING-LIKE FOR THE EDGES OF PUBLIC 
OPINION, THE MB CALMLY AND METHODICALLY AIMS FOR DEAD 
CENTER.  IN FACT, BY EGYPTIAN STANDARDS, THE MB\'S 
PROGRAM PUBLISHED DURING THE SHURA COUNCIL ELECTION 
\"CAMPAIGN\" LAST MAY IS A MODEL OF BOTH RHETORICAL AND 
SUBSTANTIVE MODERATION.  MANY OF ITS POINTS ARE NEAR OR 
IDENTICAL TO NDP POSITIONS.  THUS THE MB DIRECTLY 
CHALLENGE THE CLAIM OF THE REGIME AND ITS PARTY TO THE 
LOYALTY OF THE MASS CENTER  -- PERHAPS ONE REASON THE 
MB WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE SHURA COUNCIL IN 1989. 
ALTHOUGH SUCH AN IDEOLOGICAL CHALLENGE HAS LITTLE 
PROMISE OF SHAKING THE BEDROCK OF MASS PERSONAL AND 
COMMUNAL INTERESTS THAT ADD UP TO SUPPORT FOR THE 
REGIME, IT MERITS EXAMINATION AS A REFLECTION OF THE 
MB\'S READING OF THE MINDSET OF THE BROADER CONSTITUENCY 
THEY MUST HOPE ONE DAY TO WREST FROM THE REGIME. 
 
 
---------------------- 
THE MB\'S PROGRAM TODAY 
---------------------- 
 
12.  THE MOST RECENT, DETAILED AND COMPREHENSIVE 
STATEMENT OF THE MB\'S PROGRAM WAS THEIR MAY 1989 SHURA 
COUNCIL ELECTION PLATFORM (REF FBIS).  IT IS NOTABLY 
SHORT ON ISLAMIC CANT AND LONG ON THE EVERYDAY, 
LIBERAL, CENTRIST BROMIDES THAT ARE THE STUFF OF BOTH 
THE WAFD AND THE NDP\'S PITCHES TO POPULAR POLITICAL 
DEMANDS.  THE MB CANDIDATES PLEDGE TO FIGHT, \"IN 
SOLIDARITY WITH ALL HONORABLE ELEMENTS WITHIN THE 
NATIONALIST FORCES,\" FOR ACHIEVEMENTS IN: 
CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL REFORM; GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION 
OF ISLAMIC LAW; ELIMINATING CORRUPTION; EDUCATION, 
MEDICAL CARE, HOUSING AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES; 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS: 
 
-- CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL REFORM:  THE MB CALLS FOR 
DIRECT ELECTION OF A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT FROM 
AMONG SEVERAL CANDIDATES, AS WELL AS ELECTION OF MAYORS 
AND GOVERNORS.  THEY WANT ABOLISHMENT OF THE EMERGENCY 
LAW AND ALL OTHER \"ANTI-DEMOCRATIC\" LAWS AND PRACTICES; 
COMPLETE FREEDOM FOR FORMATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES (IN 
OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS, HOWEVER, THEY STATE THEIR 
CONTINUING OPPOSITION TO THE NASSERITES, NO DOUBT DUE 
TO THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL SCARS INFLICTED ON THEM 
BY NASSER); SEPARATION OF THE RULING PARTY FROM STATE 
ORGANS; GUARANTEES OF THE FAIRNESS OF ELECTIONS; AND 
REPRESENTATION OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS  (IRONICALLY, 
THE WESTERNIZED LIBERALS SUCH AS THE WAFDISTS SEE THE 
PARTICIPATION OF THE UNEDUCATED AS ONE OF THE CRITICAL 
WEAKNESSES OF EGYPTIAN \"DEMOCRACY;\" HERE, THE 
PROPERTIED MB ARE CASTING A BONE TO THE LEFT.)  THEY 
CALL FOR STRENGTHENING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE 
JUDICIARY, AND PUTTING IT IN CHARGE OF PRISONS IN ORDER 
TO END TORTURE AND INDEFINITE PREVENTATIVE DETENTION. 
 
 
-- ISLAMIC LAW:  THE MB CALL FOR \"IMMEDIATE 
IMPLEMENTATION\" OF THE ARTICLE OF THE CONSTITUTION 
WHICH STATES THAT ISLAM IS THE RELIGION OF THE STATE 
AND \"THE PRINCIPLES OF ISLAM ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF 
LEGISLATION.\"  (MORE RADICAL ISLAMICISTS WANT THE 
CONSTITUTION TO STATE THAT ISLAM IS THE ONLY/ONLY 
SOURCE OF LEGISLATION.)  THEY DEFLATE THE URGENCY OF 
THEIR APPEAL, HOWEVER, BY CALLING ONLY TO \"BEGIN THE 
REPEAL OF LAWS THAT CLEARLY VIOLATE ISLAMIC LAW.\"  TO 
FURTHER ASSUAGE THE MODERATE CENTER, THEY EMPHASIZE 
THAT \"ISLAM IS A STATE AND CIVILIZATION OWNED BY ALL 
WHO CONTRIBUTED TO IT.  THUS THE BROTHER COPTS IN 
PARTICULAR AND THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK IN GENERAL HAVE 
THE SAME RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AS MUSLIMS.\" 
 
-- CORRUPTION:  THE MB IDEALISTICALLY EXHORT PEOPLE, 
ESPECIALLY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, TO BE GOOD, AND URGE 
OFFICIAL ENCOURAGEMENT, EDUCATION, PROHIBITIONS AND 
SANCTIONS TO THIS END.  SIGNIFICANTLY, THE MB DO 
NOT/NOT CALL FOR THE \"HUDUD\" - CHOPPING OFF HANDS OF 
THIEVES, STONING OF ADULTERERS, ETC, THAT THE RADICALS 
PUT AT THE HEART OF ISLAMIC LAW.  THE MB WOULD CLOSE 
ALL GOVERNMENT-OWNED ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE FACTORIES (NO 
REFERENCE TO PRIVATELY OWNED PRODUCERS), STOP GAMBLING, 
AND ISSUE NO MORE LICENSES FOR \"BUFFOONERY AND 
ENTERTAINMENT ON THE PRETEXT OF ENCOURAGING TOURISM.\" 
PRESUMABLY, CURRENT LICENSES FOR BUFFOONERY WOULD BE 
UNAFFECTED. 
 
-- EDUCATION AND CULTURE:  THE MB CALL FOR RADICAL 
EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT TO PERMIT EGYPT TO \"FOLLOW THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION.\"  ANY CALL 
FOR INTENSIFYING ISLAMIC INDOCTRINATION OR CENSORSHIP 
IS NOTABLY OBSCURE, IF NOT ABSENT;  THE MB LIMIT 
THEMSELVES TO URGING STATE PROPAGANDA EFFORTS AIMED AT 
SPREADING RELIGIOUS VALUES AND OVERCOMING ALIENATION. 
THEY ALSO CALL FOR FREEING THE MEDIA FROM GOVERNMENT 
OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL. 
 
 
-- SOCIAL SERVICES AND ECONOMIC REFORM:  THE MB URGE 
\"SERIOUS ... SOLUTIONS THAT DO NOT DEPEND ON THE 
GUIDANCE OF THE IMF OR USAID.\"  THE STATE SHOULD 
\"BEWARE OF INTERFERENCE BY FOREIGNERS\" IN ECONOMIC 
POLICY AND \"GUARD AGAINST THEIR CONTROL OF ECONOMIC AND 
PRODUCTIVE GUIDANCE CENTERS.\"  DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE 
BASED ON \"SELF-RELIANCE\" AND \"ISLAMIC PRIORITIES.\" 
THEY WOULD STOP PRINTING NEW BANKNOTES TO COVER THE 
DEFICIT; REDUCE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ON LUXURIES; 
\"LIQUIDATE MONEY-LOSING ECONOMIC ESTABLISHMENTS\"; 
REFORM THE TAX SYSTEM TO SOAK THE RICH AND REDUCE THE 
BURDEN ON THE POOR; RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE; MAINTAIN 
SUBSIDIES OF BASIC COMMODITIES; AND ENCOURAGE THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR TO JOIN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN BUILDING 
LOW- AND MEDIUM- INCOME HOUSING.  THE MB MAKE THE FIRST 
CAMPAIGN REFERENCE WE HAVE SEEN IN EGYPT TO THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE, CALLING FOR REDUCING POLLUTION AS 
A PREVENTATIVE MEDICAL STEP.  THEY WOULD ENCOURAGE 
EGYPTIAN INVESTMENT IN EGYPT, AND COOOPERATE WITH ARAB 
ECONOMIES, BUT THEY MAKE NO REFERENCE TO ENCOURAGING 
\"FOREIGN\" (I.E. NON-ARAB) INVESTMENT.  ORGANS OF THE 
STATE SHOULD \"URGE\" CITIZENS TO CONSUME LESS AND 
PREVENT WASTE.  THE STATE SHOULD INTERVENE IN ECONOMIC 
AFFAIRS, WITH LONG- AND SHORT- TERM PLANS.  THE PUBLIC 
SECTOR IS THE \"NERVE CENTER\" OF THE ECONOMY, BUT IT 
MUST GET OUT OF FIELDS THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN 
HANDLE. 
 
-- FOREIGN RELATIONS:  THE MB SUPPORT THE EGYPTIAN 
ARMED FORCES.  THEY URGE COMMITMENT TO THE NAM POLICY 
OF \"BALANCED RELATIONS WITH BOTH EAST AND WEST\" (IN 
CONTRAST TO THE ISOLATIONIST \"NEITHER EAST NOR WEST\" 
LINE OF RADICAL ISLAM).  THEY MERELY URGE \"CARE\" IN 
RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., IN LIGHT OF ITS \"FLAGRANT\" 
PRO-ISRAELI STANDS; \"FREEZING\", NOT ABROGATION, OF THE 
CAMP DAVID ACCORDS; A \"COMPREHENSIVE BOYCOTT OF THE 
ISRAELI PRESENCE IN EGYPT,\"  BUT WITHOUT CALLING FOR A 
BREAK IN BILATERAL RELATIONS; AND CALL ONLY FOR SUPPORT 
OF THE \"POLITICAL JIHAD\", NOT THE VIOLENT STRUGGLE, 
\"BEING WAGED BY OUR PALESTINIAN BROTHERS,\"  AND OF 
\"THEIR RIGHT TO ESTABLISH THEIR INDEPENDENT STATE ON 
THEIR SOIL.\"  THEY OPPOSE FRAGMENTATION AND 
SECTARIANISM IN LEBANON AND SECESSIONISM IN SUDAN. 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
MUTUAL BENEFIT OF THE MB-GOVERNMENT DEAL 
---------------------------------------- 
 
13.  CONCLUSION:  BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND MB EVIDENTLY 
HAVE GOT MUCH OF WHAT THEY WANTED FROM THEIR 1987 
DEAL:  THE MB GAINED SOMETHING CLOSE TO LEGITIMACY, 
ACCESS TO THE NATIONAL MEDIA (INCLUDING TELEVISED 
PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY DEBATES), AND A VALUABLE IMMUNITY 
FROM OUTRIGHT REPRESSION, REGARDLESS OF THE INTERIOR 
MINISTER\'S OUTSPOKEN VIEWS.  THEIR POSITION AS THE ONLY 
PLAUSIBLE ISLAMIC POLITICAL MOVEMENT, HOWEVER WEAK, IS 
STRENGTHENED:  WITH THEIR PRIVATE WEALTH, LINGERING 
MASS APPEAL, DISCIPLINE, AND AT LEAST A FEW DEDICATED 
YOUTHFUL LEADERS WAITING IN THE WINGS, THE MB ARE MORE 
LIKELY THAN ANY OF THE ESTABLISHED PARTIES TO ENDURE AS 
A FORCE IN EGYPTIAN POLITICS.  FOR THE REGIME\'S PART, 
IN RETURN FOR ENDURING MORE VOCAL PUBLIC CRITICISM FROM 
ISLAMIC POLITICAL QUARTERS, IT HAS SPLIT THE ISLAMIC 
OPPOSITION INTO A COMFORTABLY-MANAGED MAINSTREAM 
ELEMENT (THE MB) AND A \"CRIMINAL\" ELEMENT (\"THE ISLAMIC 
GROUP\" AND THE LIKE) THAT IT IS STERNLY REPRESSING WITH 
LITTLE SIGN OF BROAD PUBLIC REACTION.  MEANWHILE, AS 
ALL THIS OCCURS AT THE RAREFIED POLITICAL LEVELS, A 
CULTURAL RELIGIOUS REVIVAL CONTINUES IN FITS AND STARTS 
IN THE BROADER EGYPTIAN SOCIETY.  THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS 
TO HAVE MUCH MORE INFLUENCE ON THAT LARGER CULTURAL 
PROCESS THAN HAVE THE MB, OR ANY OTHER POLITICAL OR 
RELIGIOUS GROUPS.

1.  IN A STATEMENT ISSUED ON THE EVENING OF MARCH 26, 
EGYPTIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SUPREME GUIDE HAMED ABU 
AL-NASR ISSUED A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF HIS ORGANIZATION 
DENOUNCING THE \"MALICIOUS PLOT\" THAT HAS PRODUCED THE 
INVASION OF KUWAIT, THE DESTRUCTION OF IRAQ\'S 
CAPABILITIES, AND THE POSSIBLE FRAGMENTATION OF IRAQ.  THE 
STATEMENT PREDICTABLY ASCRIBES THE REGION\'S PROBLEMS TO A 
LACK OF ISLAMIC RULE.  TEXT OF STATEMENT FOLLOWS IN PARA 2. 
 
2. BEGIN TEXT: 
 
          A STATEMENT REGARDING THE EVENTS IN IRAQ 
 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, DISTRESSED BY WHAT HAPPENED IN 
KUWAIT DUE TO THE IRAQI INVASION AND THE (ATTENDANT) 
WRECKAGE, DESTRUCTION, AND HUMILIATION OF THE KUWAITI 
PEOPLE, AND DISTRESSED BY THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION TO 
WHICH THE ARMY AND VITAL UTILITIES OF THE FRATERNAL IRAQI 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED AT THE HANDS OF THE AMERICAN 
AND FOREIGN FORCES, DENOUNCE THE VICIOUS PLOT TO FINISH 
OFF WHAT REMAINS OF THE COHESION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND 
TO SEGMENT IRAQ INTO WEAK STATELETS. 
 
THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED HAD IRAQ BEEN RULED ACCORDING 
TO ISLAMIC SHURA, HEADED BY A GOD-FEARING RULER.  THE 
DICTATOR OF IRAQ WOULD NOT (HAVE BEEN ABLE TO) DESTROY THE 
LAND AND MEN OF HIS COUNTRY BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE 
WAR. 
 
THE AMERICAN AND FOREIGN FORCES IN IRAQ AND THE GULF ARE 
PLAYING A SLY, DESTRUCTIVE ROLE IN OUR ARAB REGION.  THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD STRESSES THAT, IN ORDER TO PRESERVE 
HUMAN RIGHTS, THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE (ARAB) NATIONS, AND 
THEIR STABILITY AND PROGRESS, THOSE FORCES MUST DEPART 
(ARABIC \"RAHEEL\").  WE FURTHER IMPLORE THE MEN OF THE ARAB 
NATION TO RETURN TO ISLAM AS A STRAIGHT PATH AND MEANS BY 
WHICH THE ARAB NATION CAN STAND AS A SINGLE RANK BEFORE 
THE DECEIT OF THE ENEMIES AND THE GREEDY. 
 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IS CERTAIN THAT THE ABANDONMENT OF 
ISLAMIC ACTION AND \"SHARI\'A\" ARE BEHIND WHAT HAPPENED IN 
KUWAIT AND IRAQ, (AS WELL AS) WHAT IS OCCURRING NOW, AND 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. 
 
SALVATION LIES IN RETURNING TO GOD AND HIS RULE. 
 
\"GOD WILL ACHIEVE HIS ORDER, BUT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT 
REALIZE THIS...\" (QURANIC QUOTE)

SUBJECT:  THE GREAT SHAYKHS:  THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND 
THE RADICAL FRINGE 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. POLITICAL ISLAM IN EGYPT IS GENERALLY DIVIDED INTO 
ESTABLISHMENT ISLAM REPRESENTED BY THE RELATIVELY 
MODERATE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB), AND THE RADICAL FRINGE 
REPRESENTED BY OMAR ABDURRAHMAN AND COMPANY.  THESE 
GROUPS COMPETE FOR RECRUITS, STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF THE 
MOSQUES AND DEMONSTRATE DIFFERENT ATTITUDES TOWARD THE 
GOVERNMENT.  THE DISTINCTIONS AMONG THEM, HOWEVER, ARE 
NOT ALWAYS VERY TIDY.  STARTING FROM THE ISLAMIC 
PRINCIPLES OF \"SHURA\" (CONSULTATION) AND \"TASALUH\" 
(RECONCILIATION OF DIFFERENCES AMONG BELIEVERS), THERE 
IS CONSIDERABLE DIALOGUE, DEBATE, AND EFFORT AT 
RAPPROCHEMENT EVEN AMONG GROUPS THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN 
BLOODY CLASHES WITH EACH OTHER.  THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
SEEMS TO HAVE CHARGED DEPUTY SUPREME GUIDE MUSTAFA 
MASHHOUR WITH CONDUCTING LIAISON WITH THE EGYPTIAN AND 
THE REGIONAL RADICAL FRINGE. 
 
- 
------------------------------------------ 
PUSHING THE BROTHERHOOD TOWARD RADICALISM? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  FOR YEARS THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD WAS AN UNDERGROUND 
ORGANIZATION PRONE TO VIOLENCE.  IN THEORY, THE BROTHERS 
RENOUNCED VIOLENCE IN 1987 AND DECIDED TO PLAY BY THE 
RULES OF THE FORMAL EGYPTIAN POLITICAL GAME.  THIS 
DECISION APPEARS NOT TO HAVE BEEN UNANIMOUS.  SOME OF 
THE MORE MILITANT BROTHERS, MUSTAFA MASHHOUR FOREMOST 
AMONG THEM, RETAIN AT LEAST A THEORETICAL ATTACHMENT TO 
THE USE OF VIOLENCE FOR THE SAKE OF ISLAM. 
 
4.  INDEED, MANY ESTABLISHMENT ISLAMIC AND SECULAR 
FIGURES INSIST THAT THE BROTHERHOOD\'S DECISION TO PLAY 
THE POLITICAL GAME WAS A MERE PLOY -- THAT THE BROTHERS 
ARE STILL INVOLVED IN ISLAMIC VIOLENCE OR AT LEAST 
KINDLE THE OPTION TO USE FORCE.  MUSTAFA MASHHOUR, THEY 
CLAIM, IS THE HEAD OF THE \"AL-JIHAZ AL-SIRRI\" (\"THE 
SECRET ORGAN\") OF THE GROUP, AND AS SUCH, EITHER DIRECTS 
OR COOPERATES IN THE ORCHESTRATION OF VIOLENT ACTS. 
SOME SPECULATE THAT MASHHOUR LENDS PEOPLE AND ASSETS 
(SAFE HOUSES FOR EXAMPLE) TO ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.  OTHERS 
SAY HIS STRATEGY IS TO SEEK CONTROL OF THE RADICAL 
GROUPS BY SENDING HIS FOLLOWERS TO JOIN AND EVENTUALLY 
RISE TO POSITIONS OF INFLUENCE OR LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE 
GROUPS. 
 
5.  MASHHOUR ASPIRES TO BE THE SUPREME GUIDE OF THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SUCCEEDING THE FEEBLE OCTOGENARIAN 
HAMED ABU AL-NASR.  TO DO SO, HE WILL HAVE TO BEAT BACK 
THE CHALLENGE OF MAMOUN AL-HODEIBI, THE HEAD OF THE 
BROTHERHOOD\'S PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION IN THE 1987-90 
PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY.  AL-HODEIBI, REPUTEDLY THE CHIEF 
ADVOCATE OF PARTICIPATION IN EGYPT\'S POLITICAL GAME, 
EARNED THE GRUDGING RESPECT OF NON-ISLAMISTS FOR HIS 
WORK IN THE ASSEMBLY:  THE DEPUTIES HE SHEPHERDED PROVED 
THE MOST COHESIVE AND HARDWORKING OF THE OPPOSITION 
GROUPINGS.  AS LONG AS PARTICIPATION REMAINS THE 
BROTHERHOOD\'S POLICY, AL-HODEIBI HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN THE 
SUCCESSION STRUGGLE.  THE CYNICS -- AND IT IS HARD TO BE 
TOO CYNICAL IN EGYPTIAN POLITICS -- SAY THAT MASHHOUR IS 
TRYING HARD TO DIMINISH AL-HODEIBI\'S ADVANTAGE BY 
PUSHING THE ORGANIZATION TOWARD CONFRONTATION WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT AND A CONCOMITANT RADICALIZATION.  THUS, IN 
THE LAST FEW MONTHS MASHHOUR HAS ATTENDED RADICAL 
ISLAMIC CONFERENCES IN PAKISTAN AND KHARTOUM, HAS 
SPURNED HIS OLD FRIENDS IN SAUDI ARABIA, HAS URGED 
WORLDWIDE JIHAD WITH THE LIKES OF SUDAN\'S AL-TURABI AND 
TUNISIA\'S AL-GHANNOUSHI, AND HAS FORMULATED THE 
BROTHERHOOD\'S STATEMENT ON PALESTINE, THE RADICAL 
CONTENTS AND TONE OF WHICH ARE FAR FROM THE MB\'S 
DOMESTIC FOCUS AND MODERATE RHETORIC OF THE RECENT PAST. 
 
6.  THE BATTLE FOR LEADERSHIP WILL BE JOINED SOON.  THE 
GOVERNMENT IS AWARE OF THE POLITICAL DYNAMIC AT WORK IN 
THE BROTHERHOOD, AND WILL NO DOUBT TRY TO INFLUENCE THE 
GROUP\'S DECISION.  A VICTORY BY AL-HODEIBI WOULD 
PROBABLY PRODUCE A POLICY MUCH LIKE THAT OF THE LAST 
FOUR YEARS:  RHETORICAL COOPERATION WITH OTHER 
OPPOSITION ELEMENTS AND PATIENCE IN THE GRADUAL 
ISLAMIZATION OF EGYPT\'S PUBLIC LIFE.  A VICTORY BY 
MASHHOUR WOULD LIKELY PRODUCE A MUCH MORE STRIDENT TONE, 
AND PERHAPS EVEN A DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THE FORMAL 
POLITICAL GAME.  SUCH A MOVE WOULD SET IN MOTION A 
RADICAL DYNAMIC WHICH REASONABLY COULD BE EXPECTED TO 
END IN VIOLENCE, GIVING THE AUTHORITIES AN EXCUSE TO 
CRACK DOWN. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
SPENT FORCES:  SALAMA, KISHK, AL-BADRI 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7.  DURING THE LATE SEVENTIES AND EARLY EIGHTIES, HAFEZ 
SALAMA FROM HIS MOSQUES IN SUEZ AND CAIRO AND ABDEL 
HAMID KISHK FROM HIS IN THE QUBBA QUARTER OF CAIRO, WERE 
TWO OF THE MOST INCENDIARY CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT, 
PARTICULARLY ON CAMP DAVID AND EGYPT\'S SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES.  BOTH STRESSED THE 
NEED TO \"STRUGGLE\" -- USUALLY UNDERSTOOD AS A CODE WORD 
FOR THE USE OF VIOLENCE -- FOR THE SAKE OF ISLAM. 
SALAMA HAD EXTRA CREDIBILITY BECAUSE OF HIS RECORD AS A 
HERO IN THE WARS AGAINST ISRAEL.  KISHK\'S CHARISMA WAS 
MAGNIFIED THROUGH THE SALE OF TAPES OF HIS SERMONS.  AT 
THE TIME, MANY THOUGHT THAT IF EGYPT WAS TO HAVE AN 
ISLAMIC REVOLUTION, THESE TWO WOULD BE MAJOR FORCES 
BEHIND AND BENEFICIARIES OF SUCH A DEVELOPMENT. 
 
8.  BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, BUT THEIR INFLUENCE HAS 
WANED.  OTHER THAN BLEATING A FEW PERFUNCTORY REMARKS 
ABOUT THE \"SHAME\" OF MUSLIM FIGHTING MUSLIM AND SALAMA\'S 
REMARK ABOUT THE \"SHAME\" OF CALLING IN WESTERN 
ASSISTANCE, BOTH WERE LARGELY SILENT DURING THE LONG 
MONTHS OF THE GULF CRISIS.  SECURITY SURVEILLANCE 
UNDOUBTEDLY HELPS LIMIT THEIR ACTIVITIES, BUT AGE AND 
ILL HEALTH -- TO WHICH THEIR RADICAL COLLEAGUE SALAH ABU 
ISMAIL SURRENDERED LAST YEAR -- ARE ALSO PART OF THE 
EQUATION.  BOTH ARE IN THEIR SIXTIES WITH THE 
PREDICTABLE GERIATRIC PLAINTS SETTING IN.  KISHK SEEMS 
TO BE FADING GRACEFULLY:  HIS NEWEST TAPES ARE DEVOID OF 
POLITICAL CONTENT AND TEND TO WAX METAPHYSICAL ABOUT THE 
MYSTERIES OF THE VIRGIN BIRTH OF THE PROPHET JESUS AND 
THE PROPHET MOHAMMED\'S ASCENT TO HEAVEN. 
 
9.  BY CONTRAST, HAFEZ SALAMA IS NOT GOING GENTLY INTO 
THE GOOD NIGHT.  INDEED, MOST REFERENCES TO SALAMA HAVE 
HIM ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT OF TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH 
HIM POLITICALLY OR PHYSICALLY.  HE HAS ACCUSED THE 
INTERIOR MINISTRY OF FORCING THE EDUCATION MINISTRY TO 
PLAY BUREAUCRATIC GAMES WITH THE LICENSING OF THE 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS ASSOCIATED WITH HIS HEDAYA MOSQUE 
COMPLEX IN SUEZ.  AT ONE POINT HE ACCUSED STATE SECURITY 
OF ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION BY FORCING HIS CAR OFF THE 
REMOTE SUEZ-CAIRO DESERT ROAD.  OTHER ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISTS SUGGEST THAT SALAMA\'S MORE SERIOUS 
ACCUSATIONS ARE TO GENERATE PUBLIC ATTENTION AND 
SYMPATHY TO REVIVE AN ISLAMIC CAREER IN DECLINE. 
 
10.  ANOTHER ISLAMIC FIGURE WHO HAS RUN OUT OF POLITICAL 
STEAM IS SHAYKH YOUSSEF AL-BADRI, FORMERLY A MEMBER OF 
THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY.  SHAYKH YOUSSEF NEVER ACHIEVED 
THE FOLLOWING OR REPUTATION OF KISHK OR SALAMA, BUT, AS 
HIS ONGOING EFFORTS TO OBTAIN A LICENSE FOR A NEW 
ISLAMIC POLITICAL PARTY ATTEST, HE ASPIRES TO ISLAMIC 
GREATNESS.  CLEARLY, HOWEVER, AL-BADRI\'S FORTUNES HAVE 
WANED.  A SO-CALLED \"WORLD PRESS CONFERENCE\" ON THE GULF 
CRISIS ADVERTISED BY AL-BADRI LAST AUGUST DREW PERHAPS 
TWO HUNDRED LISTLESS ATTENDEES INCLUDING TWO JOURNALISTS 
AND ONE AMERICAN DIPLOMAT.  AL-BADRI\'S COUP DE GRACE 
CAME IN LAST FALL\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WHEN, IN THE 
MOST FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN EGYPTIAN HISTORY, THE 
SHAYKH SUFFERED AN EMBARRASSING DEFEAT. 
 
------------------------------------- 
ABDEL RASHID SAQR:  A HARSH NEW VOICE 
------------------------------------- 
 
11.  ABDEL RASHID SAQR, THE FORMER IMAM OF THE SALAH 
AL-DIN MOSQUE IN CAIRO\'S MANIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, IS A NEW 
AND STRIDENT VOICE FOR ISLAMIC MILITANCY.  THE MAY 1990 
MARCH EMANATING FROM HIS MOSQUE WAS THE LAST SIGNIFICANT 
ISLAMIC STREET ACTION IN CAIRO.  A MARK OF SAQR\'S 
POLITICAL CLEVERNESS WAS HIS MELDING OF THE ISSUES OF 
PROTEST:  HE USED FRIDAY PRAYERS TO URGE THE 
CONGREGATION TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IN PROTEST OF BOTH 
THE INTERIOR MINISTRY\'S ARREST POLICY AND A ROUND OF 
PRICE INCREASES ON GOVERNMENT-SUPPLIED COMMODITIES. 
 
12.  THE DEMONSTRATION COST SAQR HIS MOSQUE AS THE AWQAF 
MINISTRY TRANSFERRED HIM TO A \"HALL-WALKER\" SLOT IN THE 
MINISTRY ITSELF, BUT OVER THE INTERVENING MONTHS THE 
SHAYKH HAS SHOWN A TENDENCY TO BE VOCALLY RADICAL ON A 
WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES.  KNOWING A JUICY ISSUE WHEN HE 
SEES IT, SAQR IMMEDIATELY DENOUNCED THE INVASION OF 
KUWAIT BUT WENT ON AT LENGTH AGAINST THE DISPARITIES IN 
ARAB WEALTH THAT HAD \"LED\" TO THE DISASTER.  IN OTHER 
STATEMENTS, SAQR HAS DECLARED THAT JERUSALEM WILL NEVER 
BE RECOVERED BY NEGOTIATIONS, AND THAT STRUGGLE BETWEEN 
MUSLIMS AND JEWS IS A POSTULATE OF LIFE FOR THE 
FAITHFUL.  SAQR ALSO LIKES TO RE-PLAY ONE OF THE 
FAVORITE CONSPIRACY THEORIES OF IGNORANT MUSLIMS:  E.G., 
THAT THE MUSLIM WORLD IS BESET BY CHRISTIAN AND 
\"CHRISTIANIZING\" SCHEMES.  PLAYING ON THE LOCAL TENDENCY 
TO MISTRUST ANY FIGURE OF AUTHORITY, SAQR LIKES TO 
EXPOUND ON THE THEME THAT AL-AZHAR -- WHICH SHOULD BE 
THE SYMBOL OF ISLAMIC PURITY AND EGYPT\'S LEADERSHIP OF 
WORLD.ISLAM -- IS RIFE WITH CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY. 
 
13.  SAQR SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING OF A LONER.  THERE ARE 
RUMORS THAT HE WAS ONCE A MUSLIM BROTHER, BUT ON AT 
LEAST A FEW OCCASIONS HE REPORTEDLY HAS LAMBASTED THE 
MB\'S WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM.  HE DENOUNCES THE INTERIOR 
MINISTRY\'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE RADICAL FRINGE.  BUT HIS 
GOAL SEEMS MORE DENUNCIATION OF THE GOE THAN SUPPORT FOR 
THE \"AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYYA\" (IG). 
 
----------------------------------- 
ADEL HUSSEIN:  A LINK TO SECULARISM 
----------------------------------- 
 
14.  ADEL HUSSEIN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE SOCIALIST 
LABOR PARTY\'S WEEKLY NEWSPAPER \"AL-SHAAB,\" DIFFERS FROM 
OTHER PERSONALITIES DISCUSSED IN THIS MESSAGE IN ONE 
FUNDAMENTAL RESPECT:  HE ARGUABLY IS NOT EVEN AN 
ISLAMIST.  ADEL SPENT LONG YEARS AS A SELF-DESCRIBED 
\"COMMUNIST,\" UNDERGROUND IN NASSER\'S AND SADAT\'S 
PRISONS, AND AS AN OVERT HARD-LEFT JOURNALIST.  ADEL 
INSISTS THAT HIS EXPOSURE TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERS IN 
PRISON LED HIM TO THE LIGHT OF ISLAM, BUT MOST \"REAL\" 
ISLAMISTS AND LEFTISTS SLIP HIM IN THE SAME POLITICAL 
PIGEONHOLE AS SLP LEADER IBRAHIM SHUKRI:  I.E., A 
POLITICIAN WHO SAW THE INTELLECTUAL EXHAUSTION OF THE 
FITIES AND SIXTIES AND DECIDED TO RIDE THE ISLAMIC WAVE 
LAPPING AT EGYPT\'S POLITICAL SHORES IN THE LATE 
SEVENTIES.  NEVERTHELESS, HE MORE THAN ANY OTHER 
EGYPTIAN PUBLICLY LINKS ISLAM TO CALLS FOR RADICAL 
ACTION. 
 
15.  ADEL HUSSEIN HAS NO ISLAMIC FOLLOWING PER SE.  HE 
IS NOT A SHAYKH, HAS NO FORMAL RELIGIOUS TRAINING, GIVES 
SEMINARS AT SLP HEADQUARTERS RATHER THAN SERMONS AT 
FRIDAY PRAYERS, AND -- PROOF POSITIVE OF HIS SECULARISM 
TO ISLAMISTS -- HAS AN UNVEILED WIFE.  ADEL IS 
POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN ISLAMIC TERMS, HOWEVER, 
BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW WHO SEEK TO UNIFY THE 
ANTI-GOVERNMENT EFFORTS OF DISPARATE OPPOSITION ELEMENTS 
BY USING THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR OF ISLAMIC 
RHETORIC.  HE ALSO SEES THAT POLITICAL ISLAM HAS IGNORED 
THE ECONOMIC ISSUES ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS THE MOST 
VULNERABLE AND HAS TRIED IN \"AL-SHAAB\" TO SENSITIZE 
ISLAMISTS TO THEIR OVERSIGHT.  WHILE CLEVER ENOUGH TO 
KNOW THAT THE ODDS AGAINST IT ARE GREAT, WE SUSPECT 
ADEL\'S IDEAL SCENARIO WOULD HAVE ISLAMIC AND SECULAR 
ELEMENTS SUCCESSFULLY LINKED AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, 
WITH EMPTY ISLAMIC RHETORIC MASKING THE ENACTMENT OF A 
HARD-LEFT SOCIAL AGENDA.  IN OLD-LINE COMMUNIST STYLE, 
AN INTELLECTUAL/POLITICAL ELITE OF PEOPLE LIKE ADEL 
WOULD THEN GUIDE THE MASSES ALONG THE PROPER PATH. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
OMAR ABDURRAHMAN:  GODFATHER OF THE FRINGE 
------------------------------------------ 
 
16.  FOR OVER A DECADE, DR. OMAR ABDURRAHMAN HAS SERVED 
AS THE SPIRITUAL AND, PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY, THE 
OPERATIONAL LEADER OF \"AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYYA,\" A 
RELATIVELY COHESIVE GROUPING ON THE ISLAMIC FRINGE 
UNITED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT FORCE SHOULD BE USED TO 
USHER IN THE ISLAMIC STATE.  RAISED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
AN OLD ISLAMIC TRADITION THAT BLIND BOYS BE TRAINED TO 
RECITE THE QURAN TO ASSURE THEM A LIVELIHOOD, OMAR 
ABDURRAHMAN HAS BEEN IN AN ALMOST STRICTLY ISLAMIC 
MILIEU ALL HIS LIFE.  IN 1965, HE GRADUATED FROM 
AL-AZHAR, WHERE HE APPARENTLY IMBIBED DEEPLY OF THE 
THOUGHT OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD RADICAL SAYYED QUTB, WHO 
NASSER EXECUTED THE SAME YEAR ON CHARGES OF ATTEMPTING 
TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
17.  WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PURSUING HIGHER DEGREES FROM 
AL-AZHAR, ABDURRAHMAN TAUGHT AT AL-AZHAR INSTITUTE IN 
ASSIUT.  HIS RESIDENCE IN THE CITY ROUGHLY CORRESPONDED 
TO SADAT\'S DRIVE TO BOLSTER ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS ON 
EGYPT\'S CAMPUSES TO WEAKEN THE NASSERISTS.  WHETHER OR 
NOT LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITTINGLY USED ABDURRAHMAN, HE 
TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL INSTRUMENTS 
OF THE ISLAMIZATION POLICY, PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO MANY 
OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO HELPED TRANSFORM THE FORMER COPTIC 
BASTION OF ASSIUT INTO AN ACKNOWLEDGED CENTER OF RADICAL 
ISLAM.  THE MOST FAMOUS \"FATWA\" (RELIGIOUS JUDGMENT) 
RENDERED BY ABDURRAHMAN WAS TO THE ASSASSINS OF 
PRESIDENT SADAT:  I.E., IT IS ISLAMICALLY PROPER TO 
ASSASSINATE AN INFIDEL OR APOSTATE RULER.  THIS FATWA 
EARNED ABDURRAHMAN THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE 
PRINCIPAL DEFENDANT IN THE SO-CALLED JIHAD TRIALS 
CONNECTED WITH THE CONSPIRACY TO MURDER SADAT. 
ABDURRAHMAN WAS ACQUITTED IN 1984, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE 
EVIDENCE WAS UNCLEAR ON WHETHER HE HAD DECLARED THAT 
SADAT OR, MORE THEORETICALLY, ANY INFIDEL OR APOSTATE 
RULER COULD BE KILLED. 
 
18.  FOLLOWING HIS ACQUITTAL, ABDURRAHMAN LIVED FOR A 
WHILE IN SAUDI ARABIA, BUT RETURNED IN EARLY 1986 TO THE 
PROVINCE OF AL-FAYYOUM.  SINCE THEN \"AL-GAMA\'A 
AL-ISLAMIYYA\" (IG), THE GROUP OF WHICH HE IS THE 
SPIRITUAL LEADER, HAS INSPIRED DOZENS OF INCIDENTS OF 
VIOLENCE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, COPTS, LESS ZEALOUS 
MUSLIMS, AND IN AT LEAST ONE INSTANCE WESTERNERS.  LESS 
CLEAR IS HIS DEGREE OF OPERATIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
GROUP\'S ACTIONS.  IN AL-FAYYOUM IN APRIL 1989, IT SEEMS 
CLEAR THAT, DESPITE A SUBSEQUENT ACQUITTAL ON 
EVIDENTIARY GROUNDS, ABDURRAHMAN DIRECTLY URGED HIS 
CONGREGATION TO GET OUT AND BATTLE THE SECURITY FORCES 
IN THE STREETS.  WE HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT THE SPRING 1990 
BOUT OF SECTARIAN VIOLENCE WAS A STRATEGY CONCOCTED BY 
ABDURRAHMAN.  AT THE SAME TIME, ONE SCHOOL OF OBSERVERS 
OF THE RADICAL FRINGE BELIEVES THAT OTHER LEADERS IN THE 
IG -- TALAAT FUAD QASSEM, RECENTLY RECAPTURED AL-MAHGOUB 
ASSASSIN SAFWAT ABDEL GHANI, OR PERHAPS ABBOUD AL-ZUMOR 
-- DEVELOP PLANS WHICH DR. OMAR MAY BLESS BEFORE OR 
AFTER THE ACT.  WE HAVE NOT SEEN ABDURRAHMAN 
DISASSOCIATE HIMSELF FROM ANY INCIDENT OF SELF-STYLED 
ISLAMIC VIOLENCE. 
 
19.  UNTIL RECENTLY, ABDURRAHMAN HAS BEEN IN 
SELF-IMPOSED EXILE IN THE GREATER NEW YORK AREA.  HE IS 
NOW BELIEVED TO BE IN JEDDAH.  HIS ABSENCE APPEARS TO 
HAVE CHANGED HIM AND, LESS CLEARLY, CHANGED THE DYNAMIC 
AT WORK IN THE IG.  SOME HAVE IT THAT ABDURRAHMAN HAS 
GONE FROM CONSIDERING HIMSELF THE SYMBOL OF ISLAMIC 
RESISTANCE IN EGYPT TO FANCYING HIMSELF ONE OF THE 
LEADERS OF THE WORLD ISLAMIC MOVEMENT.  AS SUCH, 
ABDURRAHMAN, WHILE STILL EXCORIATING THE MUBARAK REGIME, 
HAS EXPANDED HIS RADICAL MESSAGE TO DECLARE THAT ALL 
ARAB AND ISLAMIC REGIMES ARE ROTTEN AND MUST BE 
OVERTHROWN BY FORCE.  DURING HIS ABSENCE, HOWEVER, HIS 
GRIP ON THE IG SEEMS TO HAVE LOOSENED PERHAPS BECAUSE 
OTHER FIGURES HAVE SOUGHT TO EXPAND THEIR REPUTATIONS 
AND POWER. 
 
20.  THERE ARE RUMORS THAT ABDURRAHMAN IS COMING HOME. 
IF HE DOES RETURN, THE SAME GOVERNMENT WHICH LET HIM 
LEAVE EGYPT EVEN WHEN STATE SECURITY CHARGES WERE 
OUTSTANDING AGAINST HIM WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO 
DETAIN HIM.  IF HE RETURNS AND IS NOT DETAINED, HE WILL 
STICK TO HIS MOSQUE IN AL-FAYYOUM, RENDER ADVICE TO HIS 
ACOLYTES, VIOLENCE WILL BE DONE IN HIS GROUP\'S NAME, AND 
THE AUTHORITIES WILL WATCH CAREFULLY AND SOMETIMES 
ARREST THE PERPETRATORS.  WHETHER AS SPIRITUAL OR 
OPERATIONAL LEADER, HOWEVER, THIS 53-YEAR-OLD DIABETIC 
WILL REMAIN A MAJOR THORN IN THE SIDE OF THE EGYPTIAN 
GOVERNMENT UNTIL ECLIPSED BY ANOTHER RADICAL OR BY POOR 
HEALTH. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
ABBOUD AL-ZUMOR:  LEADING FROM HIS CELL? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
21.  THE PLOT TO KILL SADAT AND INCITE INSURRECTION IN 
ASSIUT IN THE WAKE OF THE ASSASSINATION MOST LIKELY OWES 
ITS SUCCESS TO THE PLANNING AND ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS OF 
ABBOUD AL-ZUMOR, A YOUNG MAJOR IN MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE.  IN 1979 OR 1980, ABBOUD AND HIS COUSIN 
TAREQ BECAME ASSOCIATES -- PERHAPS FOLLOWERS -- OF ABD 
AL-SALAAM FARAG, WHO TERMED HIS RADICAL SPLINTER GROUP 
\"AL-JIHAD\" (AFTER AN EARLIER ALEXANDRIA-BASED 
ORGANIZATION OF THE SAME NAME, HEADED BY ONE ALI IBRAHIM 
SALAMA; WHEN THE ALEX-BASED GROUP WAS SMASHED BY THE 
SECURITY AUTHORITIES, FARAG MOVED TO CAIRO AND STARTED 
HIS GROUP).  EVEN THOUGH HE REPORTEDLY DISAGREED WITH 
THE TIMING OF THE EVENT, ABBOUD USED HIS RECRUITING AND 
ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS -- WORKING ON THE FAMILIAR 
EGYPTIAN BASIS OF KINSHIP TIES AND PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP 
-- TO DEVELOP THE STRATEGY CULMINATING IN SADAT\'S 
MURDER.  THE NUMER-TWO DEFENDANT IN THE SADAT TRIALS, 
ABBOUD WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT AT HARD LABOR 
IN 1984. 
 
22.  PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, THERE HAVE 
BEEN REPORTS THAT AL-ZUMOR IS PLANNING AND/OR DIRECTING 
ACTS OF ISLAMIC VIOLENCE FROM HIS CELL AT CAIRO\'S 
AL-TORAH PRISON.  ON TWO OCCASIONS, HIS WIFE HAS BEEN 
CAUGHT SMUGGLING RADICAL LITERATURE TO HIM WHICH 
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE WAS FOR HIS CLEARANCE BEFORE 
DISTRIBUTION.  RADICAL ISLAMIC ATTORNEY MONTASSER 
AL-ZAYYAT ALSO REPORTEDLY ACTS AS MESSENGER BETWEEN 
AL-ZUMOR AND HIS ADMIRERS ON THE OUTSIDE.  MOREOVER, IN 
EARLY 1991 A SEARCH OF AL-ZUMOR\'S CELL REVEALED A LOOSE 
PAVING STONE UNDER WHICH HIS JAILERS FOUND HANDWRITTEN 
NOTES WHICH APPARENTLY WERE TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO AN 
ANTI-REGIME PAMPHLET ON THE OUTSIDE.  THERE HAVE BEEN AT 
LEAST TWO HAGIOGRAPHIES OF HIM BASED ON LENGTHY 
INTERVIEWS IN PRISON.  RECENTLY, WE HAVE NOTICED THAT 
AL-ZUMOR, SOMETIMES PURPORTING TO SPEAK FOR THE \"JIHAD\" 
AND SOMETIMES FOR \"AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYYA,\" HAS SENT 
CONDOLENCE MESSAGES AND CONGRATULATIONS TO ISLAMIC 
FIGURES AND SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THE 
DEGREE TO WHICH AL-ZUMOR ACTUALLY IS SEEKING TO DIRECT 
RADICAL ACTIVITIES FROM PRISON IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS. 
WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT HE IS TRYING TO RAISE HIS PROFILE. 
 
23.  SOME OBSERVERS RELATE THE UPTICK IN AL-ZUMOR\'S 
PUBLICITY TO ABDURRAHMAN\'S ABSENCE.  ONE SCHOOL OF 
THOUGHT HAS IT THAT AL-ZUMOR IS ABDURRAHMAN\'S DISCIPLE, 
AND THAT IN THE SHAYKH\'S ABSENCE ABBOUD IS TRYING TO 
HOLD THE IG TOGETHER.   AN ALTERNATIVE ARGUMENT IS THAT 
THE TWO ARE AT LOGGERHEADS, OR AT LEAST ARE SOMETIMES 
RIVALS.  THE LATTER IS GROUNDED IN THE EVENTS OF THE 
SADAT TRIALS.  THE TWO COOPERATED SMOOTHLY DURING THE 
TIME LEADING UP TO THE KILLING, BUT AT THE TRIAL GAVE 
CONFLICTING TESTIMONY ABOUT THE DETAILS OF ABDURRAHMAN\'S 
\"FATWA.\"  AL-ZUMOR, SO GOES THE STORY, TOLD HIS FELLOW 
CONVICTS THAT THE GREAT DR. OMAR CHICKENED OUT, THAT HE 
STOOD UP FOR ISLAMIC PRINCIPLE ONLY WHEN IT WAS 
CONVENIENT. 
 
24.  DESPITE HIS INCARCERATION, ABBOUD AL-ZUMOR HAS 
SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER ABDURRAHMAN.  SHOULD 
CIRCUMSTANCES DEVELOP SUCH THAT THE TWO BECAME REAL 
RIVALS, AL-ZUMOR SHOULD HAVE THE UPPER HAND.  HE IS 
YOUNG (FORTY-TWO) AND ROBUST.  ABDURRAHMAN IS SO 
CORPULENT AND UNHEALTHY THAT FRIENDS AND ENEMIES ALIKE 
AT ONE POINT FEARED HE WOULD DIE IN PRISON.  AL-ZUMOR\'S 
MILITARY BACKGROUND IMBUED HIM WITH STRONG 
ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS AND PERSONAL DISCIPLINE.  WHILE 
ABDURRAHMAN IS THE VOICE OF BLIND, VIOLENT ISLAMIC RAGE, 
AL-ZUMOR IS PATIENT AND METHODICAL, BUT EQUALLY 
DEDICATED TO AN ISLAMIC STATE.  A FREED ABBOUD AL-ZUMOR 
WOULD POSE A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO ABDURRAHMAN\'S STATUS 
AS LEADER OF THE ISLAMIC RADICAL FRINGE. 
 
25.  COMMENT:  WHILE THE ISLAMIC LEADERS IDENTIFIED 
ABOVE JOCKEY FOR POSITION, THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO POSE A 
SERIOUS THREAT TO THE GOVERNMENT.  IF THEY BEGIN TO 
COOPERATE EFFECTIVELY, OR ONE OF THEM SUCCESSFULLY 
HARNESSES PUBLIC DISCONTENT, THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO 
CRACK DOWN.

SUBJECT: EL-SADIQ EL-MAHDI ON THE FUTURE OF SUDAN 
 
REF: STATE 262749 
 
 
1.  CLASSIFIED BY DCM VINCENT BATTLE, REASON 1.5 (D). 
CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  DRAWING ON REFTEL TALKING POINTS, DCM MET WITH 
EL-SADIQ EL-MAHDI IN CAIRO ON DECEMBER 30 TO DISCUSS 
HIS FUTURE PLANS, SUDANESE OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES, THE 
POLITICAL SITUATION INSIDE SUDAN, AND HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE 
(NDA).  MUBARAK EL-MAHDI AND THE HEADS OF THE UMMA 
PARTY\'S CAIRO AND ASMARA OFFICES WERE ALSO PRESENT. 
DISCOUNTING THE POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARY VICTORY FOR 
THE NDA, EL-MAHDI ASSERTED THAT A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN 
OF INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON THE NIF, COMBINED WITH 
ACTIVE, MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION, WAS THE 
KEY TO BRINGING DOWN THE NIF GOVERNMENT WITH MINIMAL 
VIOLENCE.  HE ARGUED THAT SUCH A CAMPAIGN WOULD 
DEMORALIZE THE GOVERNMENT AND DEEPEN EXTANT DIVISIONS 
WITHIN THE NIF, WHILE ENCOURAGING OPPOSITION FORCES 
INSIDE SUDAN.  IN THIS REGARD, HE SUPPORTED OFFERING 
A \"SOFT LANDING\" FOR NIF LEADERS, ANTICIPATING THAT 
SUCH A PROPOSITION WOULD FURTHER PROMOTE DISSENSION 
IN THE NIF RANKS. 
 
3.  WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT MANY COUNTRIES, EGYPT 
INCLUDED, WERE RELUCTANT TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH 
THE NDA\'S POLICY OF VIOLENT OPPOSITION TO THE 
GOVERNMENT, HE OBSERVED THAT THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN 
WAS ONLY ONE ASPECT OF THE SUDANESE OPPOSITION\'S PLAN 
TO BRING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.  HE ARGUED THAT THE NIF 
THROUGH ITS POLICY OF JIHAD WAS PROMOTING INSTABILITY 
IN THE REGION, AND SUDAN\'S NEIGHBORS MUST RESPOND. 
 
4.  REGARDING THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, EL-MAHDI AVOWED 
THAT INTERNAL SUPPORT FOR THE CORE BELIEFS OF THE NIF 
WAS ERODING, AND DEEP SCHISMS WERE DEVELOPING BETWEEN 
ELEMENTS OF THE NIF.  HE EXPECTED A POPULAR UPRISING 
TO OCCUR IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AND PREDICTED SUPPORT 
FOR SUCH AN UPRISING FROM THE ARMY AND POLICE FORCES, 
CITING MANY RECENT EXAMPLES OF DISAFFECTION WITHIN 
THE SECURITY FORCES TOWARDS THE GOVERNMENT.  ON HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NDA, HE WAS EXTREMELY POSITIVE 
ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES OUTLINED IN THE ASMARA 
DECLARATION AND IMPRESSED WITH GARANG\'S DEVELOPMENT 
FROM A MILITARY LEADER INTO A GENUINE POLITICAL 
PLAYER.  HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT WITH THE 
RESTORATION OF LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT IN KHARTOUM 
WOULD ALSO COME PEACE AND NATIONAL UNITY.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
SUDAN\'S PROBLEMS HAVE BECOME THE WORLD\'S CONCERN 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5.  EL-MAHDI BEGAN HIS COMMENTS BY STATING THAT THE 
CURRENT REGIME IN KHARTOUM HAS INTERNATIONALIZED THE 
INTERNAL PROBLEMS OF SUDAN.  BY SPONSORING AND 
ENCOURAGING ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO THE VIOLENT 
OVERTHROW OF LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE ARAB 
AND ISLAMIC WORLDS, THE NIF HAD THREATENED THE 
STABILITY OF THESE COUNTRIES AND FORCED THE WORLD TO 
BECOME INVOLVED.  HE ARGUED THAT IT WAS THEREFORE 
UNACCEPTABLE FOR COUNTRIES IN SUDAN\'S NEIGHBORHOOD, 
EGYPT AMONG THEM, TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING WHILE 
THE NIF ENGAGED IN POLICIES OF JIHAD.  HE REALIZED 
THAT SOME COUNTRIES DID NOT WANT TO ASSOCIATE 
THEMSELVES WITH THE MILITARY GOALS OF THE SUDANESE 
OPPOSITION.  HOWEVER, HE OBSERVED, THIS WAS NOT THE 
ONLY PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THE OPPOSITION HOPED TO 
INSTIGATE CHANGE. 
 
6.  REGARDING HIS OWN ATTITUDE TOWARD THE NDA\'S 
POLICY OF VIOLENT OPPOSITION, EL-MAHDI NOTED THAT 
VIOLENCE WAS \"PART AND PARCEL OF THE REGIME\'S OWN 
INITIATIVES.\"  IT WAS NATURAL, THEREFORE, THAT SOME 
SUDANESE WILL MEET FIRE WITH FIRE.  HE PREDICTED, 
HOWEVER, THAT MILITARY OPPOSITION WOULD NOT SUCCEED 
IN OVERTHROWING THE NIF GOVERNMENT ON ITS OWN.  HE 
ARGUED THAT ALL PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE CONFLICT 
ANTICIPATED THAT THIS WOULD COME ABOUT THROUGH A 
SPONTANEOUS, NATIONAL UPRISING.  SUCH AN UPRISING 
WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE, DESPITE LARGE-SCALE 
PURGES AND FORCED RETIREMENTS WITHIN THE ARMY AND 
POLICE, THERE REMAINED A STRONG \"NATIONAL CHARACTER\" 
WITHIN THESE FORCES WHICH OPPOSED THE NIF.  THIS 
\"WILL DECIDE THE ISSUE IN FAVOR OF AN UPRISING.\" 
 
 
-------------------------- 
LOYALTY OF SECURITY FORCES 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  WHEN ASKED TO CITE EXAMPLES OF THIS NATIONALIST 
THREAD WITHIN THE ARMY AND POLICE, EL-MAHDI OBSERVED 
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SIX ARMY COUP ATTEMPTS IN THE 
LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS, REFLECTING AN OBVIOUS 
UNEASINESS WITHIN THE ARMY REGARDING THE NIF. 
FURTHERMORE, DURING INTERROGATION THE OFFICERS 
INVOLVED REFUSED TO DISASSOCIATE THEMSELVES FROM THE 
COUPS, OPENLY DEFYING THE REGIME AND DEMANDING 
CHANGE.  HE ALSO CORROBORATED OTHER REPORTS THAT THE 
POLICE REFUSED TO INTERVENE DURING POPULAR 
DEMONSTRATIONS IN SEPTEMBER, FORCING NIF MILITIAS TO 
CRACK DOWN ON THE DEMONSTRATORS. 
 
8.  HE POINTED TO PERIODIC FORCED RETIREMENTS OF 
POLICE AND SOLDIERS AS EVIDENCE OF INSECURITY WITHIN 
THE REGIME REGARDING THE LOYALTY OF THESE FORCES. 
FINALLY, HE RELATED AN ANECDOTE RECOUNTED BY THE 
MESSENGER HE HAD ENTRUSTED TO DELIVER HIS FAREWELL 
LETTERS OF CRITICISM TO GENERAL OMAR BASHIR AND HASAN 
EL-TURABI.  UPON RECEIVING THESE LETTERS FROM THE 
MESSENGER, THE ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF INQUIRED IF EL- 
MAHDI HAD ESCAPED SAFELY.  WHEN INFORMED THAT HE HAD, 
THE CHIEF OF STAFF REPORTEDLY SAID \"AL-HAMDUL\'ILLAH 
(PRAISE GOD).\" EL-MAHDI ASSERTED THAT THESE WERE NOT 
EXAMPLES OF AD HOC REACTIONS; RATHER, THERE WAS AN 
ORGANIZED REPRESENTATION OF AN ANTI-NIF VIEW WITHIN 
THE ARMY AND POLICE. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE THE KEY TO PEACEFUL CHANGE 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
9.  DURING EL-MAHDI\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DCM, HE 
REPEATEDLY RETURNED TO THE LEITMOTIF THAT 
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WAS INDUCING PSYCHIC CHANGE 
WITHIN THE NIF GOVERNMENT.  EVERY EVENT WHICH 
HIGHLIGHTED THE FAILURE OF THE NIF REGIME OR SUPPORT 
FOR THE SUDANESE PEOPLE VICE THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
DECREASING THE MORALE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND 
INCREASING THAT OF THE OPPOSITION.  THIS, IN TURN, 
WAS EXACERBATING EXISTING SCHISMS WITHIN THE NIF 
ESTABLISHMENT. 
 
10.  HE THEREFORE ENCOURAGED EXTERNAL PRESSURE OF 
EVERY SORT ON THE REGIME.  HE BELIEVED THESE 
PRESSURES WOULD CREATE \"THE CUMULATIVE AFFECT WE ARE 
SEEKING,\" FURTHER DIVIDING THE GOVERNMENT AND 
BRINGING IT CLOSER TO DISSOLUTION.  EL-MAHDI 
EMPHASIZED THAT THIS POLICY REPRESENTED THE GREATEST 
HOPE FOR NON-VIOLENT CHANGE WITHIN SUDAN.  IN 
RESPONSE TO THE DCM\'S INQUIRY ABOUT THE NATURE OF 
PRESSURES OUTSIDERS COULD EXERT, HE CITED THE 
HARDENING ATTITUDES OF THE FRONT LINE STATES AND 
PRESSURE FROM OTHERS IN THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL 
AUTHORITY ON DEVELOPMENT (IGAD) TO RESTORE PEACE AND 
DEMOCRACY IN SUDAN AS EXAMPLES OF SUCH CUMULATIVE 
PRESSURE. 
 
11.  IN THIS REGARD, HE HOPED TO ENCOURAGE THE 
PARTICIPATION OF ARAB STATES SURROUNDING SUDAN IN 
THIS POLICY, SPECIFICALLY CITING EGYPT, LIBYA AND 
SAUDI ARABIA.  HE SUGGESTED, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THEY 
JOIN THE FRIENDS OF IGAD.  HE ALSO PROPOSED THAT ANY 
LEADER AMONG THE IGAD MEMBERS COULD ORGANIZE A SUMMIT 
TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF REGIONAL STABILITY AND FOCUS 
A SPOTLIGHT ON SUDAN\'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES.  HE 
ALSO AGREED WITH THE DCM THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSC 
SANCTIONS AGAINST SUDAN WAS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR 
BRINGING PRESSURE TO BEAR ON SUDAN, NOTING THAT THE 
MORE THE REGIME WAS ISOLATED AND PUNISHED FOR ITS 
ACTIONS, THE MORE PRESSURE WILL ACCUMULATE.  HE 
STATED THAT HE INTENDS TO EXPRESS THESE VIEWS IN HIS 
DISCUSSIONS WITH EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS. 
 
12.  FINALLY, HE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION WITH THE LACK 
OF INTERNATIONAL MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR THE SUDANESE 
OPPOSITION, CLAIMING THAT IT WAS AMONG THE LEAST WELL 
FUNDED OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS IN THE WORLD.  HE NOTED 
THAT THERE IS A SENSE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
THAT SUDAN HAS BEEN ISOLATED BY UNSC SANCTIONS AND 
DIPLOMATIC CONDEMNATION.  HE ARGUED THAT THIS IS 
UNTRUE: SUDAN RECEIVED ACTIVE SUPPORT FROM MANY 
PARTIES, INCLUDING IRAN, IRAQ, QATAR, AND WEALTHY 
INDIVIDUAL ARABS (IN ADDITION TO OSAMA BIN LADEN) WHO 
AGREE WITH ITS POLITICAL AGENDA.  THIS SUPPORT CAN 
ONLY BE NEUTRALIZED BY COMPARABLE SUPPORT TO THE 
OPPOSITION. 
 
13.  THE DCM AGREED WITH THE NEED TO INFLUENCE THE 
NIF BY EXERTING \"CALIBRATED\" PRESSURE.  AT THE SAME 
TIME, THE US MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN TO DISCUSS ITS BEHAVIOR BOTH AT 
HOME AND ABROAD.  EL-MAHDI ENCOURAGED THIS DIALOGUE, 
NOTING THAT IT WAS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THE 
ISSUES.  HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE US POSITION WAS NOT 
ANTI-ISLAMIC, NOR WERE WE SUPPORTING SOUTHERN 
SECESSION.  RATHER, THE US WAS CONCERNED WITH HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY.  HE ARGUED THAT THE NIF WAS 
PRESENTING US POLICY IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT AND TWISTING 
THE FACTS TO CLOUD THE ISSUES.  EL-MAHDI ALSO 
SUPPORTED WHAT HE CHARACTERIZED AS US EFFORTS TO 
PROMOTE A \"SOFT LANDING\" FOR THE NIF, BELIEVING THAT 
ENCOURAGING SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD FURTHER INCREASE 
DISSENSION WITHIN NIF RANKS. 
 
 
--------------------- 
IS THE NIF IMPLODING? 
--------------------- 
 
14.  REFERRING TO ALLEGED SCHISMS WITHIN THE NIF, THE 
DCM INQUIRED ABOUT THE NATURE OF THESE SCHISMS AND 
EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE DEVELOPING.  EL-MAHDI STATED 
THAT A DEEP DIVISION HAD DEVELOPED BETWEEN 
PRAGMATISTS, WHO PERCEIVED THE FAILURE OF THE NIF 
EXPERIMENT AND BELIEVED THAT THE NIF SHOULD 
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS FAILURE; AND THE \"DOCTRINAIRES,\" WHO 
FEARED THAT ADMITTING ANY FAILURE WOULD DEMONSTRATE 
WEAKNESS AND BRING DOWN THE REGIME. 
 
15.  HE CITED THE RECENT DEBATE OVER THE BUDGET AS AN 
EXAMPLE OF THIS DIVISION.  ROUGHLY ONE THIRD OF 
CURRENT BUDGET OUTLAYS INVOLVE TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR 
\"PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS,\" WHICH ARE IN REALITY 
NIF BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN FINANCING PRO-GOVERNMENT 
POLITICAL AND SECURITY ACTIVITIES AND ARE RIFE WITH 
CORRUPTION.  THE CURRENT MINISTER OF FINANCE, AN NIF 
PRAGMATIST, REALIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT 
FUNCTION WITH SUCH A BUDGET AND DEMANDED THAT THE 
EXEMPTIONS BE ELIMINATED.  A RAGING DEBATE ENSUED 
WITH HARD-LINERS, WHO FEARED THAT ELIMINATING THE 
EXEMPTIONS WOULD UNDERMINE THE REGIME.  TO DATE THIS 
ISSUE IS UNRESOLVED.  SCHISMS HAD ALSO ERUPTED 
REGARDING NORMALIZATION WITH EGYPT AND OTHER FRONT- 
LINE STATES, AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF THE ARMY VICE THE 
POPULAR DEFENSE FORCES.  AS A RESULT OF THESE 
SCHISMS, SOME LEADERS WITHIN THE NIF HAD BEGUN TO 
STATE OPENLY THAT SUDAN MUST EMBRACE POLITICAL 
PLURALITY, NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH HER NEIGHBORS, 
AND OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION.  EL-MAHDI 
STRESSED THAT THE MORE EXTERNAL PRESSURE WAS BROUGHT 
TO BEAR, THE MORE THESE SCHISMS WOULD GROW. 
 
16.  TURNING AGAIN TO THE UNSC SANCTIONS, EL-MAHDI 
STATED THAT, PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE, HE HAD BEEN 
ENCOURAGING THE GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH CREATIVE 
WAYS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE UN.  HE ARGUED 
THAT THE THREE ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTING TO ASSASSINATE 
PRESIDENT MUBARAK WERE SYMPTOMS, NOT THE CAUSE OF 
SUDAN\'S PROBLEMS.  RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THESE 
INDIVIDUALS AND INSISTING THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER 
INSIDE SUDAN, EL-MAHDI HAD ARGUED THAT THE GOS OFFER 
CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES TO THE UN DEMONSTRATING 
THEIR COMMITMENT TO COMBATING TERRORISM AND 
RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS.  SUCH CBMS SHOULD INCLUDE 
DISMANTLING THE TERRORISM INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
DISCUSSING WHY THIS APPARATUS EXISTED. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
ARMY REFUSES TO ENGAGE NDA 
-------------------------- 
 
17.  REFERRING TO REPORTS ON BBC RADIO ON 12/30 THAT 
AN UPRISING HAD ERUPTED NEAR THE BORDER CITY OF 
KASSALA, THE DCM REQUESTED FURTHER INFORMATION. 
WHILE UNAWARE OF THE INCIDENT, MUBARAK EL-MAHDI BROKE 
IN TO SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN FOCUSING ITS 
EFFORTS IN THIS AREA DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF NDA 
FORCES INSIDE THE SUDANESE BORDER, AND HAD RECENTLY 
SENT A BRIGADE TO OUST THE NDA FROM THE REGION.  THE 
BRIGADE HAD ALLEGEDLY CONDUCTED GHOST MANEUVERS IN 
THE AREA, REFUSING TO ENGAGE THE NDA WHILE REPORTING 
TO KHARTOUM THAT THE OPPOSITION FORCES HAD RETREATED 
INSIDE ERITREA.  HE DID NOT KNOW IF THERE WAS A 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE EVENTS AND THE REPORTED 
UNREST. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
TRAVEL PLANS: CAMPAIGN FOR SUPPORT 
---------------------------------- 
 
18.  TURNING TO HIS FUTURE PLANS, EL-MAHDI STATED 
THAT HE HOPES TO TRAVEL SOON TO SAUDI ARABIA AND THEN 
BACK TO ERITREA.  IN THE NEAR TERM HE HOPED TO VISIT 
OTHER FRONT-LINE STATES.  ULTIMATELY, HE INTENDED TO 
VISIT THE US (ONCE THE NEW CABINET WAS CONFIRMED AND 
SWORN IN), THE UK, AND OTHER EU NATIONS TO ELICIT 
MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION.  NOTING THAT EL- 
MAHDI HAD MENTIONED LIBYA AS A POSSIBLE SUPPORTER OF 
THE OPPOSITION CAUSE, THE DCM QUESTIONED WHETHER 
LIBYA COULD INDEED PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE.  EL-MAHDI 
AGREED THAT LIBYA HAD OF LATE BEEN MORE A HINDRANCE 
THAN A HELP, OBSERVING THAT LIBYA HAD BEEN PROVIDING 
DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT FOR THE NIF.  HOWEVER, HE ALSO 
OBSERVED THAT THE NIF HAD REPAID THE FAVOR BY 
SUPPORTING RADICAL LIBYAN ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSED TO 
THE GOVERNMENT.  HE EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT LIBYA 
WOULD ULTIMATELY ALIGN ITSELF WITH THE EGYPTIAN 
POSITION, WHATEVER THAT TURNED OUT TO BE. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
RELATIONS WITH NDA, GARANG 
-------------------------- 
 
19.  EL-MAHDI ASSERTED THAT THE ASMARA DECLARATION 
WAS \"ONE OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE SUDANESE 
OPPOSITION.\"  THE FORMATION OF THE NDA REPRESENTED 
TWO IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS: A) AGREEMENT BY ALL 
PARTIES ON BASIC PRINCIPLES; AND, B) A CLEAR 
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE NORTHERN OPPOSITION AND THE 
SPLM ON A FUTURE FRAMEWORK FOR PEACE IN SUDAN.  IN 
THE LAST TWO UPRISINGS AGAINST DICTATORSHIPS IN 
SUDAN, IN 1964 AND 1985, THE REGIMES WERE TOPPLED BUT 
THE CIVIL WAR CONTINUED.  EL-MAHDI EXPRESSED OPTIMISM 
THAT, BASED ON THIS ALLIANCE, FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SUDAN COULD SEE BOTH DEMOCRACY AND PEACE AT THE SAME 
TIME. 
 
20.  AS FOR HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH JOHN GARANG, EL- 
MAHDI NOTED THAT HE HAS ONLY MET GARANG TWICE, ONCE 
IN 1986 AND AGAIN LAST WEEK.  HE COMMENTED ON A 
REMARKABLE EVOLUTION IN GARANG\'S PERSONA IN THE 
INTERIM PERIOD.  WHILE IN 1986 GARANG WAS FOCUSED 
SOLELY ON THE MILITARY STRUGGLE, HE HAS BECOME 
MULTIDIMENSIONAL, WITH A STRONG COMMAND OF THE 
DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL ELEMENTS OF HIS POSITION. 
 
21.  ASMARA - MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

SUBJECT: EGYPT\'S MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD - DOWN BUT NOT OUT 
 
1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON MINISTER COUNSELOR 
JEFF MILLINGTON FOR REASON 1.5 (D). 
 
-------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
2.  (C) MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND JOURNALIST SYNDICATE 
MEMBERS MUHAMMAD ABD AL-QUDUS AND SALAH ABD AL-MAQSUD 
TOLD US RECENTLY THAT: 
 
--  THE LATEST MOVE IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S ONGOING 
CAMPAIGN TO SUPPRESS THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) WAS 
THE ARRESTS IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER OF DOZENS OF MB 
STUDENT ACTIVISTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S INTENT WAS TO DETER ISLAMIC ACTIVISM ON 
CAMPUSES PRIOR TO THE ACADEMIC YEAR. 
 
--  THE MB WILL CONTINUE WITHIN THE JOURNALISTS 
SYNDICATE AND ELSEWHERE TO OPPOSE THOSE EGYPTIANS WHO 
ADVOCATE GREATER PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE TIES WITH ISRAEL. 
 
--  EGYPT\'S MB REMAINS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH OFFICIALLY 
RECOGNIZED MB POLITICAL PARTIES IN JORDAN, YEMEN AND 
ALGERIA. 
 
3. (C) THE GOVERNMENT\'S CONTINUING ARRESTS AND 
DETENTIONS OF MB MEMBERS HAS PUT THE ORGANIZATION, 
WHICH REMAINS ILLEGAL HERE, ON THE DEFENSIVE.  ITS 
LEAFLETS DECRY THE DETENTIONS WITHOUT TRIAL, AND SEEK 
OTHER OPPOSITION GROUPS\' SUPPORT AGAINST THESE ABUSES 
OF POLITICAL FREEDOMS.  DESPITE ITS CURRENT WEAKNESS, 
HOWEVER, THE MB HAS ROOTS IN EGYPT AT ALL LEVELS OF 
SOCIETY AND A DEMONSTRATED CAPACITY TO SURVIVE 
GOVERNMENT CRACK-DOWNS. END SUMMARY. 
 
4.  (C) EMBOFF MET SEPARATELY WITH MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
LEADERS SALAH ABD AL-MAQSUD AND MUHAMMAD ABD AL-QUDUS 
NOVEMBER 6 AND 9.   BOTH ARE PROMINENT JOURNALISTS WHO 
WERE ELECTED TO THE 12-MEMBER BOARD OF THE JOURNALISTS 
SYNDICATE AND WRITE EDITORIALS FOR THE ISLAMIC 
OPPOSITION PRESS (MAINLY THE TWICE WEEKLY \"AL-SHAAB\" OF 
THE ISLAMIC SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY, AND THE WEEKLY 
\"AL-HAQIQAH\" OF THE ISLAMIC-ORIENTED LIBERAL PARTY). 
BOTH HAVE SERVED PRISON TIME FOR THEIR MEMBERSHIP IN 
THE MB, WHICH IS AN ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION IN EGYPT. 
 
------------------------------- 
PERCEIVED U.S. ANTI-MUSLIM BIAS 
------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) ABD AL-QUDUS FOCUSED ON WHAT IS PERCEIVED IN 
THE EGYPTIAN STREET AS A BIAS IN U.S. POLICY TOWARDS 
ISRAEL AND AGAINST MUSLIMS.  PRESSURING ARAB STATES TO 
ATTEND DOHA WAS ONE INDICATION, PER ABD AL-QUDUS.  HE 
UNDERSTOOD IN THEORY THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE ARABS 
OF DOHA BUT REMAINED ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO IT.  IF THE 
EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT ATTENDED DOHA, THE EGYPTIANS IN THE 
STREET WOULD BE ANGRY, HE PREDICTED.  ANOTHER 
INDICATION IS THE APPOINTMENT OF AMERICAN JEWS TO 
POLICY-MAKING JOBS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  EMBOFF ASKED 
HIM NOT TO PREJUDGE PERSONS BASED ON THEIR RELIGIOUS 
BACKGROUNDS, BUT TO FOCUS ON SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES WITH 
U.S. POLICY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6.  (C)  BOTH MB MEMBERS COMPLAINED ABOUT CONTINUING 
GOVERNMENT PRESSURE ON THE PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES. 
TWO YEARS AGO, FOLLOWING THE ELECTORAL SUCCESSES OF MB 
AND OTHER ISLAMIC-ORIENTED LEADERS IN THE SYNDICATES, 
THE GOVERNMENT TOOK STEPS TO SHUT THEM DOWN.  ONLY THE 
JOURNALISTS SYNDICATE IS CURRENTLY OPERATING UNDER ITS 
ELECTED BOARD.   (NOTE:  LAWYERS HAVE TOLD US THEY 
EXPECT NEW ELECTIONS FOR THEIR SYNDICATE IN NEXT 
APRIL).  THE JOURNALISTS SYNDICATE, ELECTED FAIRLY PER 
ABD AL-MAQSUD IN 1995, IS COMPOSED OF 2 MB MEMBERS, ONE 
EACH FROM THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, NASSERIST, 
WAFD AND SOCIALIST TAGAMMU PARTIES, AND SIX 
INDEPENDENTS AMONG WHOM ARE SEVERAL ISLAMIC-ORIENTED 
WRITERS. 
 
7.  (C) ABD AL-MAQSUD DESCRIBED THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MB:  IT STARTED IN EARLY 1995 WITH 
A SERIES OF ARRESTS AGAINST MB LEADERS IN THE 
SYNDICATES, LEADING TO A NOVEMBER 1995 MILITARY COURT 
JUDGMENT AGAINST 54 MB LEADERS.  THEY RECEIVED PRISON 
SENTENCES RANGING FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS.  THE MAIN 
CHARGE - THAT THEY WERE PLOTTING THE OVERTHROW OF THE 
GOVERNMENT -- IS COMPLETELY FALSE, PER ABD AL-MAQSUD. 
THE MB BELIEVES IN BALLOT BOXES NOT VIOLENCE, HE 
STRESSED. 
 
8.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMATICALLY PREVENTS MB 
PARTICIPATION IN ELECTIONS, ACCORDING TO ABD AL-MAQSUD. 
IN THE 1995 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, 170 MB MEMBERS 
WERE CANDIDATES BUT NOT ONE WAS ELECTED OWING TO FRAUD, 
HE SAID.  IN THE APRIL 1997 LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS, 
AGAIN NOT ONE MB CANDIDATE WON.  THE GOVERNMENT USED 
PRESSURE TACTICS, INCLUDING ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS, TO 
FORCE MANY MB CANDIDATES TO WITHDRAW.  FINALLY, THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY COOKED THE RESULTS OF NEXT 
MONTH\'S NATION-WIDE UNIVERSITY STUDENT UNION ELECTIONS, 
ABOLISHING LISTS OF CANDIDATES WITH ISLAMIC LEADERS AND 
FORCING OTHERS TO WITHDRAW THEIR NAMES.  33 STUDENTS OF 
ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY WERE ARRESTED FOR BEING MB 
MEMBERS IN AUGUST, AND ANOTHER GROUP WAS ARRESTED IN 
SEPTEMBER PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR, IN 
ORDER TO DETER ISLAMIC POLITICAL ACTIVITY ON CAMPUS. 
BOTH ABD AL-MAQSUD AND ABD AL-QUDUS SAID THAT NINE OF 
THE STUDENTS ARRESTED IN ALEXANDRIA WERE TORTURED IN 
PRISON (ABD-AL-QUDUS SHOWED EMBOFF A PAMPHLET ON THE 
ALLEGED TORTURE OF THESE STUDENTS, WHO HAVE SINCE BEEN 
RELEASED). 
 
9. (C) ABD AL-QUDUS SAID HE HAD HELPED FOUND IN 1996 
\"THE COMMITTEE TO DEFEND PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE\" 
COMPOSED OF DIVERSE OPPOSITION FIGURES FROM THE MB, 
SOCIALISTS, NASSERISTS AND WAFDISTS.   THE COMMITTEE, 
WHOSE HONORARY CHAIRMAN IS NOBEL PRIZE WINNER NAGUIB 
MAHFOUZ, DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN CONVICTED TERRORISTS 
FROM THE IG, WHOM IT DOES NOT HELP, AND PERSONS 
DETAINED UNDER MARTIAL LAW WITHOUT A CRIMINAL 
CONVICTION.  THE LATTER NUMBER OVER 20,000 PER 
ABD AL-QUDUS.  (COMMENT:  THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY AN 
EXAGGERATED NUMBER, THOUGH THE NUMBER OF DETAINEES IS 
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE.  HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS ESTIMATE A 
TOTAL PRISON POPULATION OF 32,000 INCLUDING THOSE 
SERVING SENTENCES AND THOSE BEING HELD PENDING TRIALS 
AND SENTENCES.  END COMMENT).  LEAFLETS PRINTED BY THE 
COMMITTEE EMPHASIZE ITS BROAD BASE OF OPPOSITION 
SUPPORT, AND LIST DETAINEES WHO REMAIN IN PRISON 
WITHOUT TRIAL. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE PRO-PEACE 
CAMP AND WASAT PARTY (BUT NOT THE COPTS) 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
10.  (C) EMBOFF ASKED BOTH MB LEADERS ABOUT THEIR 
POSITION, AS ADVOCATES OF GREATER POLITICAL FREEDOMS, 
ON THE ATTEMPT OF THE JOURNALISTS\' SYNDICATE TO 
DISCIPLINE SYNDICATE MEMBERS LUTFI AL-KHOLI AND OTHERS 
FOR ADVOCATING GREATER NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL. 
ISN\'T THIS CONTRARY TO THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION?  BOTH SAID THIS WAS NOT A FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION ISSUE BUT RATHER A QUESTION OF ADHERENCE TO 
A SYNDICATE GENERAL ASSEMBLY DECISION IN 1980 TO FORBID 
NORMALIZATION PRIOR TO A COMPLETE PEACE TREATY WITH ALL 
ARAB PARTIES. (NOTE:  AL-AHRAM WRITER LUTFI AL-KHOLI IS 
CONTESTING THIS SYNDICATE DECISION IN COURT FOR BEING 
CONTRARY TO THE EGYPTIAN CONSTITUTION\'S GUARANTEE OF 
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.) 
 
11. (C) EMBOFF ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE MB\'S APPARENT 
OPPOSITION TO THE ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH A NEW POLITICAL 
PARTY ON ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES CALLED AL-WASAT (THE 
\"MIDDLE\"). ABD AL-MAQSUD SAID HE AND HIS WIFE HAD BEEN 
AMONG THE ORIGINAL 71 FOUNDERS OF AL-WASAT BUT WITHDREW 
FOLLOWING THE MB LEADERSHIP\'S DECISION THAT THE MOMENT 
WAS NOT RIGHT FOR A POLITICAL PARTY.  HOW CAN WE HAVE A 
PARTY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT EVEN ALLOW US TO 
PUBLISH A NEWSPAPER, HE ASKED.  HE MINIMIZED THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE FORMER MB MEMBERS WHO CONTINUE TO 
PURSUE THIS NEW PARTY. 
 
12. (C) ON THE ANTI-COPT STATEMENTS MADE BY MB SUPREME 
GUIDE MUSTAFA MASHOUR IN AN AL-AHRAM INTERVIEW LAST 
APRIL, ABD AL-MAQSUD DENIED THAT THIS WAS MB POLICY OR 
PRACTICE.  THERE WERE THREE COPTS IN THE MB LEADERSHIP 
AFTER WORLD WAR II, HE CLAIMED.  HE HIMSELF USED TO 
HAVE A COPT ROOMMATE AND HIS GREATEST ALLY IN THE 
JOURNALISTS SYNDICATE BOARD ELECTIONS WAS A COPT.  THE 
MB CONSIDERS COPTS EQUAL MEMBERS OF EGYPTIAN SOCIETY, 
HE INSISTED. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
EGYPT MB TIES WITH COUNTERPARTS IN JORDAN, 
YEMEN AND ALGERIA 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
13. (C) ABD AL-MAQSUD NOTED THAT IN THREE COUNTRIES 
MUSLIM BROTHER GROUPS ARE LEGAL POLITICAL PARTIES:  THE 
ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT IN JORDAN; THE REFORM (\"ISLAH\") 
PARTY IN YEMEN, WHICH USED TO BE IN THE GOVERNING 
COALITION; AND THE MOVEMENT FOR A PEACEFUL SOCIETY 
(\"HAMAS\") IN ALGERIA, WHICH CONTROLS FIVE GOVERNMENT 
MINISTRIES.  EGYPT\'S MB IS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH EACH 
OF THESE PARTIES, HE SAID.  (NOTE:  ABD AL-MUNEIM SAID, 
DIRECTOR OF AL-AHRAM CENTER, TOLD US THAT MAQSUD HOSTED 
A DELEGATION FROM ALGERIA\'S HAMAS TO EGYPT FOR THE 
INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION MEETING HERE IN SEPTEMBER). 
OTHER LEGITIMATE ISLAMIC PARTIES IN TURKEY (REFAH) AND 
IN PAKISTAN ARE NOT MB AFFILIATES BUT DO MAINTAIN TIES 
WITH THE MB IN EGYPT, HE SAID. 
 
-------- 
COMMENT 
-------- 
 
14.  (C) THE EFFORTS OF ABD AL-MAQSUD AND 
ABD AL-QUDUS TO PORTRAY THE MB AS JUST ANOTHER 
POLITICAL ORGANIZATION THAT IS WILLING TO WORK IN A 
MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM SEEMS TO US TO BE A TACTICAL 
MANEOUVER RATHER THAN A SINCERE CONVERSION TO 
DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES.  THE GOVERNMENT, OF COURSE, IS 
NOT CONVINCED AND ALSO PROMINENT LEFT-WING OPPOSITION 
FIGURES ARE NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
CRACK-DOWN ON THE MB.  THE ANTI-MB CROWD SAYS THE 
ORGANIZATION\'S PHILOSOPHY WILL ALLOW IT TO REVERT TO 
VIOLENT ACTIVISM WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE. 
ACCORDING TO THEM, THE MB IS RELATIVELY WEAK RIGHT NOW 
AND THUS PRACTICING \"DISSIMULATION\" WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT 
DEMOCRACY.  \"DISSIMULATION\" IS A TRADITIONAL SHI\'ITE 
DOCTRINE THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY UNDERGROUND SUNNI 
GROUPS LIKE THE MB. 
 
15. (C) THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUCCEEDED IN 
WEAKENING THE MB, WE DOUBT IT CAN SHUT DOWN THIS 
ORGANIZATION, WHICH HAS A 70-YEAR HISTORY IN EGYPT AND 
FOLLOWERS AT ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY.  ONE INDICATION OF 
ITS DIVERSITY:  MUHAMMAD ABD AL-QUDUS, BORN INTO 
CAIRO\'S ARISTOCRACY, SEEMS TO HAVE ADOPTED POLITICAL 
ISLAM AS A REACTION TO HIS FAMILY\'S MILITANT

MILLINGTON FOR REASON 1.5 (B). 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY:  SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR MUHAMMAD TANTAWI, 
IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 7 IN A POPULAR 
EGYPTIAN MAGAZINE, STATED HIS OPPOSITION ON ISLAMIC 
GROUNDS TO SUICIDE OPERATIONS AGAINST ISRAELI 
CIVILIANS.  LIKE HIS RECENT MEETING WITH THE ISRAELI 
AMBASSADOR, HIS FORTHRIGHT REFUTATION OF POLITICALLY 
POPULAR \"RESISTANCE\" OPERATIONS DEMONSTRATES TANTAWI\'S 
WILLINGNESS TO EXHORT MUSLIMS TO FOLLOW ISLAMIC 
TEACHINGS UNTAINTED BY POLITICAL IDEOLOGY.  TANTAWI 
HAS GOVERNMENT SANCTION, BUT NOT THE FULL BACKING OF 
THE OFFICIAL RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT HERE, FOR HIS 
OUTSPOKEN POSITIONS ON TOLERANCE TOWARDS ISRAEL AND 
JEWS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (U) SHEIKH TANTAWI WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT-OWNED AL-MUSAWWAR.  AL-MUSAWWAR IS A POPULAR 
WEEKLY NEWS MAGAZINE.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
INTERVIEWER:  ALL PREVIOUS SHEIKHS OF AL-AZHAR REFUSED 
TO MEET WITH ANY ISRAELI, AND THE LATE SHEIKH 
GAD EL-HAQ EVEN REFUSED TO MEET ISRAELI PRESIDENT 
EZER WEIZMAN. 
 
SHEIK TANTAWI:  I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OTHERS\' 
OPINIONS.  I PERSONALLY MEET WITH WHOMEVER I WANT AND I 
AM NOT ASKED WHY I MET WITH A CERTAIN PERSON.... 
 
INTERVIEWER:  IN A PREVIOUS INTERVIEW WITH ME YOU 
COMMENTED ON THE LEBANESE RESISTANCE, REPRESENTED BY 
HIZBOLLAH, AND ON THEIR SUICIDE OPERATIONS.  YOU SAID 
THAT THESE DEATHS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ACTS OF 
MARTYRDOM. 
 
SHEIKH TANTAWI:  I CAN\'T CHANGE WHAT I BELIEVE IN. 
I SAY THAT ANYONE WHO BLOWS HIMSELF UP AMONG AN ENEMY 
WHO IS AGGRESSING UPON HIS PROPERTY, LAND, HONOR OR 
COUNTRY IS A MARTYR.  THE DEFENSE OF RELIGION AND 
COUNTRY IS A JIHAD (HOLY STRUGGLE).  BUT BLOWING UP 
ONESELF AMONG CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND OLD, SICK AND 
INNOCENT PEOPLE - THIS IS AN ACT THAT IS VERY MUCH 
AGAINST ISLAM. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  BUT SOME MAY SAY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
DEFINE WHO IS AN INNOCENT ISRAELI AND THAT ALL OF THEM 
ARE MILITARY COLONIAL INVADERS. 
 
SHEIKH TANTAWI:  I CANNOT GO DOWN THAT PATH OR SAY SUCH 
A THING.  PEOPLE MAY SAY WHAT THEY WANT.  MY DEFINITION 
(OF THE ENEMY) CONFORMS TO WHAT THE KORAN COMMANDS US, 
NAMELY TO REPEL AGGRESSION.  ALMIGHTY GOD SAYS:  \"FIGHT 
IN THE CAUSE OF GOD THOSE WHO FIGHT YOU, BUT DO NOT 
TRANSGRESS LIMITS, FOR GOD LOVES NOT TRANSGRESSORS.\" 
OUR PROPHET IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS.  THE PROPHET FOUGHT 
HIS ENEMIES, INCLUDING ARAB RENEGADES, HYPOCRITES, AND 
JEWS, BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN PROVEN THAT THE PROPHET 
KILLED A WOMAN OR CHILD.  WHAT IS PROVEN IS THAT THE 
PROPHET ABHORRED THE PRESENCE OF A WOMAN AMONG AN 
ENEMY\'S DEAD AND SAID \"SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
KILLED.\" 
 
INTERVIEWER:  THE PROPHET ADVISED MUSLIMS TO SEEK THE 
COUNSEL OF CHRISTIANS ONLY, AND NOT THE JEWS, SINCE THE 
LATTER WERE KNOWN FOR TREACHERY, BREAKING PROMISES AND 
DISLOYALTY TO ANY FORM OF COMMITMENT. 
 
SHEIKH TANTAWI: I FOLLOW GOD\'S HOLY BOOK.  THE KORAN 
SPEAKS OF AND EMPHASIZES THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK, AND 
STATES \"DO NOT DISPUTE WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK 
...BUT SAY WE BELIEVE IN THE REVELATION WHICH HAS COME 
DOWN TO US AND IN THAT WHICH HAS COME DOWN TO YOU. OUR 
GOD AND YOUR GOD IS ONE, AND IT IS TO HIM THAT WE BOW 
IN ISLAM.\"  SO IF THE KORAN SAYS SO, CAN I SAY THAT 
WHAT IS MEANT BY \"PEOPLE OF THE BOOK\" ARE THE 
CHRISTIANS WITHOUT THE JEWS?  INDEED THE \"PEOPLE OF THE 
BOOK\" ARE THE JEWS AND THE CHRISTIANS BOTH, AND IT IS 
NOT POSSIBLE TO RESTRICT \"PEOPLE OF THE BOOK\" TO EITHER 
THE CHRISTIANS OR THE JEWS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4.  (C) SHEIKH TANTAWI\'S MESSAGE OF TOLERANCE TOWARDS 
JEWS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S THEME OF 
INTERFAITH TOLERANCE, HIGHLIGHTED IN PRESIDENT 
MUBARAK\'S SPEECH LAST JULY ON THE OCCASION OF PROPHET 
MUHAMMAD\'S BIRTHDAY.  SHEIKH TANTAWI\'S MEETING WITH THE 
ISRAELI AMBASSADOR HAD OFFICIAL SANCTION - HE MENTIONS 
ELSEWHERE IN THE INTERVIEW THAT HE SPOKE WITH FM MOUSSA 
BEFORE AGREEING TO MEET WITH THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR. 
MOUSSA TOLD HIM THE DECISION WAS UP TO HIM, HE SAID. 
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS ENCOURAGED BY SHEIKH 
TANTAWI AND, ACCORDING TO THE ISRAELI EMBASSY HERE 
(PROTECT), THE GOI IS SEEKING A SUITABLE CHRISTIAN 
RELIGIOUS LEADER TO HOST AN INTERFAITH MEETING THAT 
WOULD INCLUDE TANTAWI AND THE CHIEF SEPHARDIC RABBI OF 
ISRAEL.  THEY ARE HOPING POPE JOHN PAUL II WILL AGREE 
TO HOST THIS MEETING. 
 
5. (C) TANTAWI IS USING THE PRESTIGE OF HIS AL-AZHAR 
POST TO PREACH IN THE EGYPTIAN MEDIA AGAINST THE 
RADICALIZED POLITICAL ISLAM PROPOUNDED BY THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD AND BY ISLAMIC TERRORIST GROUPS.  THEIR 
VERSIONS OF ISLAM, AND POSITIONS ON ISSUES OF THE DAY, 
CONTINUE TO HAVE MUCH RESONANCE HERE.  TANTAWI\'S 
POSITIONS ON TOLERANCE TOWARDS JEWS AND ENGAGING IN 
DIALOGUE WITH ISRAELIS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE EGYPTIAN 
GOVERNMENT BUT NOT DICTATED BY IT.   HE REMAINS AT ODDS 
WITH HIS OWN RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT OVER HIS MEETING 
WITH THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR.  TANTAWI FACES AN UPHILL 
BATTLE, BOTH IN AND OUTSIDE OF OFFICIAL RELIGIOUS 
CIRCLES, BUT HE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF RETREAT.

REF:  98 CAIRO 8147 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC-POLITICAL MINISTER 
COUNSELOR RICHARD LEBARON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (C) SINCE 1995, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN 
PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES CONTROLLED BY THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD AND ARRESTED THEIR ACTIVISTS, THE 
BROTHERHOOD HAS REMAINED QUIET, ISSUING ONLY AN 
OCCASIONAL PUBLIC STATEMENT ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES. 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT MOLLIFIED.  IT EMBARKS ON 
CAMPAIGNS OF ARRESTS OF MB MEMBERS, AND PUBLICIZES THE 
ARRESTS, IN ORDER TO PREVENT AND DETER MB ACTIVISM IN 
THE RUN-UP TO NATION-WIDE ELECTIONS.  AFTER RELEASING 
LAST YEAR A GROUP OF 31 MB ACTIVISTS FROM THE 1995 
ROUND-UPS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ARRESTED ANOTHER 110 
SINCE LAST AUGUST.  THE ARRESTS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE AS 
THE COUNTRY PREPARES FOR THE OCTOBER 1999 PRESIDENTIAL 
REFERENDUM ON MUBARAK\'S FOURTH TERM. 
 
3. (C) THE MB IS FURTHER PLAGUED BY INTERNAL DIVISIONS 
ALONG GENERATIONAL LINES, WITH THE YOUNGER ACTIVISTS 
(THE TARGETS OF THE GOE ARRESTS) WANTING A GREATER ROLE 
IN THE DECISION-MAKING, AND BY THE EGYPTIAN MB\'S 
WEAKENING TIES WITH SISTER ORGANIZATIONS IN OTHER ARAB 
COUNTRIES.   DESPITE THESE WEAKNESSES, THE MB REMAINS 
EGYPT\'S LARGEST AND BEST ORGANIZED OPPOSITION MOVEMENT. 
OUR MB CONTACTS COMPLAIN OF THE SECURITY CRACKDOWNS, 
DENY ANY LINKS WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS AND PROFESS 
THEIR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC POLICIES AND PRACTICES. 
WE SHOULD HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ON THE LAST POINT.  IN THE 
MB IDEOLOGY, GOD\'S LAW TRUMPS DEMOCRACY, AND GOD\'S LAW 
AS THEY INTERPRET IT DOES NOT FAVOR HERETICAL VIEWS, 
WOMEN\'S PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT, OR EQUAL RIGHTS 
FOR NON-MUSLIMS IN AN ISLAMIC SOCIETY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------- 
MB INTERNAL STRUCTURE 
---------------------- 
 
4. (C) ACCORDING TO EGYPTIAN EXPERTS ON THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD, THE MB HAS TWO GOVERNING BODIES IN EGYPT. 
THE \"GUIDANCE BUREAU\" OF 14 OFFICIALS RUNS DAY-TO-DAY 
AFFAIRS.  ITS CURRENT SUPREME GUIDE (MUSTAFA MASHOUR) 
HAS TWO DEPUTIES:  ONE (MA\'MOUN AL-HODEIBY) SERVES AS 
SPOKESMAN AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS, 
WHILE THE OTHER (A SYRIAN NAMED HASAN HOWEIDY WHO HAS 
LIVED IN EGYPT SINCE THE EARLY 1980\'S) LIASES WITH MB 
BRANCHES IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.  THE GUIDANCE BUREAU 
INCLUDES THOSE IN CHARGE OF SYNDICATES, UNIVERSITIES, 
FAMILIES, AND OTHERS IN CONTACT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY.  THE MB\'S LEADERSHIP IN EGYPT, WHERE THE 
GROUP WAS FOUNDED IN 1927 AND FIRST BECAME POPULAR, 
REMAINS IN THEORY ALSO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, ALTHOUGH IN PRACTICE THE 
BRANCHES ELSEWHERE HAVE BECOME DE FACTO INDEPENDENT. 
MB CONTACTS HERE SAY THE OTHER BRANCHES HAVE BY 
NECESSITY EVOLVED SEPARATELY GIVEN THE DIFFERING 
CIRCUMSTANCES IN EACH COUNTRY.  NEVERTHLESS, THE OTHERS 
\"COORDINATE\" WITH THE MOTHER ORGANIZATION IN CAIRO, AND 
AT THE TOP OF THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION THE 
SUPREME GUIDE IS ALWAYS AN EGYPTIAN.   MB SOURCES HERE 
NOTE THAT MANY OF THE OTHER MB GROUPS OPERATE IN A 
FREER ENVIRONEMENT, PARTICULARLY THE ONE IN JORDAN. 
THEY INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO JORDANIAN AND SYRIAN MB, 
YEMEN\'S ISLAH PARTY, PALESTINIAN HAMAS, AND ALGERIAN 
HAMAS AS MB AFFILIATES. 
 
5. (C) THE OTHER GOVERNING BODY IS A \"SHURA COUNCIL\" OF 
38 MEMBERS, WHICH MEETS PERIODICALLY TO REVIEW REPORTS 
FROM THE GUIDANCE BUREAU AND SETS OVERALL POLICY.  IT 
INCLUDES A MINORITY OF NON-EGYPTIAN MEMBERS.  IN THEORY 
IT ELECTS THE BUREAU OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE SUPREME 
GUIDE WHO COMES UP FOR ELECTION EVERY SIX YEARS.  BUT 
IN PRACTICE, MUSTAFA MASHOUR WAS CHOSEN AS SUPREME 
GUIDE IN 1995 WITHOUT ELECTIONS.  THE GUIDANCE BUREAU 
SELECTED MASHOUR BECAUSE, AT 74 YEARS OF AGE, HE WAS 
THE SENIOR MEMBER OF THE MB\'S FOUNDING GENERATION, 
ACCORDING TO OUR MB SOURCES.  THE MB IS SUPPOSED TO 
HOLD ELECTIONS FOR THE SHURA COUNCIL AT THE PROVINCIAL 
LEVEL (IN EGYPT) AND NATIONAL LEVEL (FOR THE OTHER ARAB 
BRANCHES), BUT MB MEMBERS HAVE TOLD US THAT IT HAS 
POSTPONED SHURA ELECTIONS IN EGYPT FOR SEVERAL YEARS 
BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT SECURITY PRESSURE. 
 
------------------------------------- 
MB THEORY AND PRACTICE:  NO ILLUSIONS 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) THE MB PRESENTS ITSELF TO BOTH WESTERNERS AND 
EGYPTIANS AS COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, INCLUDING 
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS SUCH AS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.  OUR 
MB INTERLOCUTORS STRESS THAT THE ORGANIZATION WANTS TO 
REFORM EGYPT\'S CURRENT SYSTEM (TERMED SOMEWHAT CORRUPT 
AND INCOMPLETELY ISLAMIC) GRADUALLY BY WORKING THROUGH 
GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY.  THEY SAY AN MB GOVERNMENT WOULD 
WILLINGLY CEDE POWER IF, ONCE ELECTED TO OFFICE, IT 
WERE SUBSEQUENTLY TO LOSE AN ELECTION.   IN FACT, MB 
SHURA COUNCIL MEMBER (AND JOURNALIST SYNDICATE BOARD 
MEMBER) SALAH ABDEL MAQSUD TOLD US THAT THE MB PREFERS 
NOT TO BE IN POWER, BUT INSTEAD SEEKS TO INFLUENCE THE 
GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT COMPLETELY ISLAMIC POLICIES.  HE 
CITES MB FOUNDER HASAN AL-BANNA WHO REPORTEDLY SAID, 
WHEN ASKED, THAT HE DIDN\'T WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF 
EGYPT, HE JUST WANTED THE PRESIDENT TO IMPLEMENT AN 
ISLAMIC PROGRAM.  WE RECENTLY OBSERVED AN MB 
PRESENTATION TO A SECULAR EGYPTIAN AUDIENCE, DURING A 
REGULAR WEEKLY GATHERING HOSTED BY A LOCAL NGO.  THE 
SPEAKER CAREFULLY PITCHED A NATIONALISTIC RATHER THAN 
RELIGIOUS APPEAL, STRESSING THAT EGYPT\'S ACHIEVEMENTS, 
WHETHER IN THE ECONOMY OR FOREIGN POLICY OR BUILDING 
INFRASTRUCTURE, ARE ACHIEVEMENTS FOR ISLAM, SINCE EGYPT 
IS AN ISLAMIC COUNTRY.   WE ARE FOR EVERYTHING THAT 
MAKES EGYPT STRONG, HE CONCLUDED. 
 
7. (C) ON THE OTHER HAND, EXAMINATION OF SPECIFIC MB 
PRACTICES AND POLICIES BELIES THIS STATED COMMITMENT TO 
DEMOCRATIC NORMS. AS THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATE, 
DEMOCRACY IS FINE AS LONG AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH 
GOD\'S LAW, BUT GOD\'S LAW AS INTERPRETED BY THE MB 
TRUMPS ALL. 
 
-- FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION:  MB SPOKESMAN HODEIBY AND 
OTHER MB FIGURES WERE IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE 1995 
CAMPAIGN TO DECLARE CAIRO UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR NASR ABU 
ZEID AN \"APOSTATE\" FOR HIS WRITINGS ON MODERN 
INTERPRETATIONS OF ISLAM.  IN ADDITION, MB MEMBERS IN 
THE PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES FAVOR SYNDICATE 
DISCIPLINARY EFFORTS (E.G. STRIPPING OF PROFESSIONAL 
CREDENTIALS) FOR MEMBERS WHO ADVOCATE GREATER CONTACTS 
WITH ISRAELIS.  THE MB\'S PROFESSED INTEREST IN FREEDOM 
OF EXPRESSION REMAINS LIMITED TO ITS ABILITY TO FURTHER 
ITS OWN IDEOLOGY. 
 
-- WOMEN\'S RIGHTS:  WOMEN CAN IN THEORY VOTE IN THE MB 
SHURA ELECTIONS AND STAND FOR ELECTION.  IN PRACTICE, 
ACCORDING TO MB SOURCES, WOMEN HAVE NEVER PARTICIPATED 
IN EITHER THE SHURA OR GUIDANCE OFFICE (WE UNDERSTAND, 
HOWEVER, THAT IN THE YEMEN AND JORDAN MB, A FEW WOMEN 
HAVE JOINED THE NATIONAL-LEVEL SHURA COUNCILS.)   THE 
ONLY EVEN SEMI-PROMINENT MB WOMAN RECALLED BY OUR 
INTERLOCUTORS IN EGYPT IS ZEINAB AL-GHAZZALI (DAUGHTER 
OF THE LATE MB SHEIKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZZALI).   SHE 
HOLDS NO OFFICIAL POSITION IN THE MB. 
 
--ATTITUDE TOWARDS ISRAEL:  DESPITE ITS STATED 
ADHERENCE TO NON-VIOLENT SOLUTIONS, THE MB HAS NOT 
ACCEPTED THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT\'S PEACE TREATY WITH 
ISRAEL.  IT CALLS FOR ARMED STRUGGLE TO LIBERATE 
JERUSALEM AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. ITS PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS ON THIS ISSUE HAVE INCREASINGLY CRITICIZED 
THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTED HAMAS.  FOR 
INSTANCE, THE MB STATEMENT AFTER THE WYE RIVER 
AGREEMENT (AS PUBLISHED IN THE OPPOSITION AL-SHAAB 
NEWSPAPER OF OCTOBER 27) CONDEMNED THE PA\'S ARRESTS OF 
ISLAMISTS IN GAZA AND CALLED THE PA \"A TOOL FOR 
SUPPRESSING THE PALESTINIANS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO CIVIL 
WAR.\"  INSIDE EGYPT, THE MB STRONGLY REJECTS ANY 
NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAELIS AS NOTED ABOVE. LEADER OF 
THE MB SPLINTER WASAT GROUP ABUL ELA AL-MADI TOLD US 
\"NORMALIZATION\"  SHOULD MEAN NO ISRAEL SINCE 
ELIMINATION OF THAT \"ARTIFICIAL ENTITY\" WOULD BE FOR 
HIM THE \"NORMAL\" CONDITION. 
 
-- POSITION OF MINORITIES:  THE MOST FAMOUS LIVING MB 
SCHOLAR IS YUSUF AL-QARDAWI, AN EGYPTIAN NOW LIVING IN 
QATAR, CONSIDERED BY SOME WESTERN SCHOLARS TO BE A 
MODERATE IN THE FUNDAMENTALIST SPECTRUM.  NEVERTHELESS, 
THE QARDAWI WHOSE BOOKS AND TAPED LECTURES WE FIND IN 
CAIRO IS NO MODERATE.  FOR INSTANCE, HE SUPPORTS RE- 
IMPOSING THE TRADITIONAL ISLAMIC TAX ON NON-MUSLIMS 
LIVING IN AN ISLAMIC COUNTRY (CALLED THE \"JIZYA\" TAX). 
HIS BOOK \"NON-MUSLIMS IN ISLAMIC COUNTRIES\" COMMENTS 
CRITICALLY ON THE EMPHASIS PLACED BY SOME ARAB 
GOVERNMENTS (READ THE GOE) ON INTERFAITH TOLERANCE, 
MISPLACED IN QARDAWI\'S EYES TO THE EXTENT THAT IT 
CONFLICTS WITH GOD\'S LAW.  QARDAWI WRITES:  \"IT IS NOT 
TOLERANCE TO FORCE MUSLIMS TO ABANDON GOD\'S LAW FOR THE 
SAKE OF SPARING THE FEELINGS OF NON-MUSLIM MINORITIES. 
WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY A CHRISTIAN OR JEW SHOULD BE 
OFFENDED BY THE AMPUTATION OF A THIEF\'S HAND, OR THE 
FLOGGING OF SLANDERERS, ADULTERERS OR DRUNKS... A 
MUSLIM OBEYS THESE RULES AS AN ACT OF WORSHIP, WHILE A 
NON-MUSLIM, WHO DOESN\'T UNDERSTAND THEIR DIVINE NATURE, 
SHOULD TAKE THEM TO BE MERELY THE CRIMINAL LAW OF THE 
LAND ADOPTED BY THE MAJORITY.\"  SUPREME GUIDE MASHOUR, 
IN A 1997 AL-AHRAM INTERVIEW, LIKEWISE SUPPORTED 
IMPOSING THE JIZYA TAX ON EGYPT\'S COPTIC MINORITY 
(THOUGH HE LATER DENIED MAKING THE REMARKS). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES - THE LOST MB STRONGHOLDS STAY 
QUIET 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
8. (C) SOME EGYPTIAN OBSERVERS OF THE MB AGREE THAT 
WHILE ITS PRACTICES ARE NOT DEMOCRATIC, THE MB\'S 
YOUNGER GENERATION MAY OVER TIME GAIN POLITICAL 
EXPERIENCE AND EVOLVE AWAY FROM THEOCRATIC THEORY 
TOWARDS A MORE PRACTICAL ACCEPTANCE OF POLITICS IN A 
SECULAR STATE (ALONG THE LINES, SAY THESE OBSERVERS, OF 
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTIES IN WESTERN EUROPE).  IN 
SUPPORT OF THIS ARGUMENT, THESE OBSERVERS POINT 
PARTICULARLY TO THE MB\'S EXPERIENCE OF RUNNING SEVERAL 
OF EGYPT\'S PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES FROM 1992-95.  THEY 
CITE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE MB\'S POTENTIAL 
DEMOCRATIC TENDENCIES AND ACTUAL COALITION BUILDING 
ABILITIES.  PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES HAVE BEEN AN 
IMPORTANT NON-GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTION IN EGYPTIAN 
PUBLIC LIFE SINCE THE 1920\'S.  WHILE THEIR TRADITIONAL 
FOCUS WAS ON REGULATING PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND 
PROVIDING MEMBER SERVICES, THE SYNDICATES HAVE ALWAYS 
BEEN A FORUM TO DISCUSS POLITICAL ISSUES.  IN NASSER\'S 
ERA THEY WERE USED POLITICALLY TO RALLY \"POPULAR\" 
SUPPORT FOR GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS.  UNDER SADAT, THEY 
WERE A REFUGE FOR LEFTIST CRITICS OF THE REGIME.  IN 
ADDITION, THE SYNDICATES ARE OFTEN A STEPPING STONE TO 
A POLITICAL CAREER FOR GOVERNMENT-APPROVED CANDIDATES 
(E.G., FORMER PRIME MINISTER MUSTAFA KHALIL ROSE UP 
THROUGH THE ENGINEERS SYNDICATE). 
 
9. (C) IN THE LATE 1980\'S AND EARLY 1990\'S THE MB USED 
ITS ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL ABILITIES TO GET OUT 
ITS VOTE IN SYNDICATE BOARD ELECTIONS.   SINCE 
SYNDICATE MEMBERS MUST CAST BALLOTS EITHER IN CAIRO 
SYNDICATE HEADQUARTERS, OR IN CAPITALS OF REGIONAL 
PROVINCES, THE MB BUSSED IN THEIR SYNDICATE MEMBERS AND 
OTHER SYMPATHIZERS FROM THE PROVINCES ON ELECTION DAY. 
SYNDICATE MEMBERS MUST PAY DUES, AND ANOTHER MB 
TECHNIQUE OF THE TIME WAS TO AGREE TO PAY A MEMBER\'S 
DUES IN EXCHANGE FOR A PRO-MB VOTE IN THE SYNDICATE 
ELECTIONS.  THE RESULT:  THE MB CAPTURED PLURALITIES OF 
THE GOVERNING BOARDS OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS SYNDICATES 
- THE LAWYERS, ENGINEERS, DOCTORS, AND PHARMACISTS. THE 
MB CONTROLLED THE SYNDICATES BY SUPPORTING A NEUTRAL OR 
PRO-GOVERNMENT CANDIDATE FOR THE TOP POSITION, WHILE 
KEEPING THE DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS AND RUNNING 
THE SYNDICATES THROUGH COALITIONS WITH OTHER OPPOSITION 
AND INDEPENDENT FIGURES. 
 
10. (C)  AFTER THE MB GAINED CONTROL OF THE SYNDICATES, 
THE GOE RESPONDED FIRST BY CHANGING THE SYNDICATE 
ELECTION LAWS IN 1992 TO REQUIRE SUPER MAJORITIES, AND 
THEN IN LATE 1995 BY ABOLISHING THE MB-RUN BOARDS OF 
SEVERAL SYNDICATES AND REPLACING THEM WITH GOE- 
APPOINTED GUARDIANS.  THE GUARDIANS ARE SUPPOSED TO 
TEMPORARILY LOOK AFTER SYNDICATE AFFAIRS AND PREPARE 
FOR NEW ELECTIONS.  IN JUSTIFYING THESE MOVES, THE GOE 
MADE TWO CLAIMS:  THE MB EMBEZZLED SYNDICATE FUNDS, AND 
THE MB WAS USING THE SYNDICATES TO PROMOTE THEIR OWN 
POLITICAL AGENDA.  AHMAD SEIF AL-ISLAM HASSAN AL-BANNA, 
SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE LAWYERS SYNDICATE DURING THE 
PERIOD OF MB CONTROL (AND SON OF THE MB FOUNDER), 
ADMITTED TO US THERE WERE SOME FINANCIAL ERRORS MADE 
DURING THE MB TENURE, BUT HE VEHEMENTLY DENIED THAT 
THIS JUSTIFIED THE GOE SHUTTING DOWN THE INDEDEPENDENT 
SYNDICATES.  THE ONLY FINANCIAL DETAILS CITED TO US IN 
MEETINGS WITH SYNDICATE MEMBERS ARE THAT SOME SYNDICATE 
CONTRACTS (PRINTING LEAFLETS OR ARRANGING SYNDICATE 
MEMBER TRAVEL) WERE GIVEN TO COMPANIES OWNED BY MB 
MEMBERS.  THE MORE SERIOUS CHARGE IS THAT THE 
SYNDICATES BECAME MB POLITICAL PLATFORMS.  AS NOTED 
ABOVE, SYNDICATES HAVE ALWAYS HAD A POLITICAL VOICE, 
BUT THIS VOICE APPARENTLY BECAME INTOLERABLY ANTI- 
REGIME DURING THE PERIOD OF MB CONTROL.  HAMDI SAYYID, 
CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE DOCTORS SYNDICATE AND RULING 
PARTY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, DETAILED FOR US HOW 
POLITICS (E.G., BOSNIA OR THE GOE COUNTER-TERROR 
CAMPAIGN) BECAME THE DOCTORS\' OVERRIDING ISSUES DURING 
THE MB TENURE, TO THE NEGLECT OF PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS 
AND MEMBER SERVICES. 
 
11. (C) SINCE 1995, THE SYNDICATES HAVE GROWN QUIET, 
HOLDING ONLY THE OCCASIONAL SMALL-SCALE PROTESTS OF 
U.S. POLICY DURING IRAQ CRISES.  THE TWO MOST 
POLITICALLY VOCAL DURING THE MB TENURE - THE LAWYERS 
AND ENGINEERS - REMAIN UNDER GOE GUARDIANSHIP, WITH NO 
DATES YET FOR FOR NEW BOARD ELECTIONS.  SPECULATION ON 
IMMINENT LAWYERS SYNDICATE ELECTIONS HAS CIRCULATED IN 
THE PRESS AND AMONG LAWYERS FOR MONTHS.  THE 
GOVERNMENTAL FRONT-RUNNER, RAGA\'I ATIYAH (MUBARAK 
FAMILY PERSONAL LAWYER), IS RUMORED TO HAVE FORMED A 
COALITION WITH THE MB LAWYERS WHEREBY THEY WILL SUPPORT 
HIM FOR PRESIDENT IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GOE\'S ALLOWING 
THE MB A CERTAIN SPECIFIED NUMBER OF SEATS ON THE 
BOARD.  WAFD PARTY COMPETITORS TOLD US THIS RUMORED 
COALITION FELL APART WHEN, AT A RECENT JOINT MEETING OF 
THE ATIYAH BACKERS AND MB LAWYERS, IT BECAME CLEAR TO 
THE GOE SECURITY SERVICES THAT THE MB WOULD DOMINATE 
THIS COALITION.  THE LATEST WORD IS THAT LAWYERS 
SYNDICATE ELECTIONS MUST WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE OCTOBER 
1999 REFERENDUM ON MUBARAK\'S FOURTH TERM. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:  QUIET ISN\'T GOOD ENOUGH 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
12. (U) IN 1995, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT WAS SHUTTING DOWN 
THE MB-CONTROLLED SYNDICATES, IT ALSO ARRESTED SEVERAL 
HUNDRED MB MEMBERS FROM SYNDICATES AND UNIVERSITIES, 
BUNDLING 82 OF THEM THROUGH EXPEDITED TRIALS IN THE 
MILITARY COURT SYSTEM.  THE MAIN CHARGES WERE BELONGING 
TO A BANNED GROUP (THE MB IS NOT A LEGAL ENTITY IN 
EGYPT) AND WORKING AGAINST THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. 
IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT CHARGED MANY WITH CONTACTS 
WITH \"JIHAD\" AND \"ISLAMIC GROUP\" TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS (THUS FURTHER JUSTIFYING THE RESORT TO 
THE MILITARY COURTS ON NATIONAL SECURITY GROUNDS).  IN 
THE FIRST OF TWO TRIALS IN NOVEMBER 1995, 31 MB MEMBERS 
WERE SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON, THREE OTHERS 
WERE SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS AND 15 WERE ACQUITTED 
(CASE NO. 95/8).  IN THE OTHER CASE, 17 WERE SENTENCED 
TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON AND THREE MORE TO FIVE YEARS, 
WITH 13 ACQUITTALS (CASE NO. 95/11). 
 
13. (U) A NEW GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN OF MB ARRESTS BEGAN 
SEVEN MONTHS AGO, WITH A TOTAL OF 110 SUSPECTED MB 
MEMBERS ARRESTED TO DATE, ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS. 
THOSE ARRESTED ARE BEING HELD IN DETENTION WITHOUT 
TRIAL, WHICH IS ALLOWED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO SIX MONTHS 
UNDER THE POST-1981 EMERGENCY LAWS (THOUGH IN PRACTICE 
SUCH DETENTION CAN OCCUR FOR YEARS).  THE CAMPAIGN IS 
NATION-WIDE THOUGH FOCUSED ON MB CENTERS IN THE DELTA, 
CAIRO AND ALEXANDRIA:  IN THE DELTA PROVINCE OF KAFR 
AL-SHEIKH, 16 PERSONS WERE ARRESTED BETWEEN AUGUST AND 
OCTOBER (ALL BUT ONE WERE RECENTLY RELEASED); IN 
ALEXANDRIA, 11 WERE ARRESTED IN OCTOBER AND ANOTHER 
NINE IN FEBRUARY; IN GIZA, FIVE WERE ARRESTED IN 
FEBRUARY.  THE EGYPTIAN ORGANIZATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
(EOHR) HAS COMPILED DATA ON THESE RECENT ARRESTEES, 
GATHERING TESTIMONY AND ALLEGING INCIDENTS OF TORTURE 
AND MALTREATMENT BY THE STATE SECURITY FORCES DURING 
THE INTERROGATIONS.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOE HAS 
RELEASED ALL OF THE 48 MB MEMBERS SENTENCED IN NOVEMBER 
1995 TO THREE-YEAR PRISON TERMS. 
 
14. (U) THE EOHR REPORT PROVIDES NAMES, AGES, AND 
OCCUPATIONS OF THE RECENT ARRESTEES.  THE CONSISTENT 
PATTERN IS MIDDLE-INCOME MEN BETWEEN 30 TO 45 YEARS OF 
AGE (PROFESSIONALS, HIGHER SALARIED LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
EMPLOYEES, MERCHANTS).  THUS FAR, WE HAVE SPOTTED AMONG 
THE NEW ARRESTEES ONLY TWO FROM THE GROUP CONVICTED IN 
1995 AND RELEASED IN 1998.  THEY ARE PROMINENT MB 
ACTIVISTS IBRAHIM AL-ZAAFARANI (SECRETARY GENERAL OF 
THE ALEXANDRIA CHAPTER OF THE DOCTORS SYNDICATE) AND 
MUHAMMAD TAHA WAHDAN (PROFESSOR OF COMMERCE AT 
ISMAILIYYA UNIVERSITY).  ZAAFARANI HAS BEEN RE-ARRESTED 
AND RELEASED FROM DETENTION SEVERAL TIMES SINCE HIS 
THREE-YEAR PRISON TERM ENDED IN JANUARY 1998. 
 
15. (C) OBSERVERS HERE INTERPRET THESE ARRESTS AS THE 
GOE\'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO DETER MB ACTIVISM PRIOR TO 
UPCOMING ELECTIONS. THE LAST MAJOR ROUND-UP IN 1995 
PRECEDED THE NOVEMBER 1995 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS; A 
MUCH SMALLER NUMBER OF MB ARRESTS PRECEDED EACH OF THE 
1997 LOCAL COUNCIL AND 1998 SHURA COUNCIL ELECTIONS. 
WE MAY NOW BE WITNESSING GOE PREVENTIVE EFFORTS PRIOR 
TO THE OCTOBER 1999 PRESIDENTIAL REFERENDUM AND 
PROSPECTIVE  SYNDICATE ELECTIONS.  SOME OBSERVERS 
EXPECT THE GOE TO KEEP UP THIS PRESSURE THROUGH THE 
NOVEMBER 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  THE MESSAGE 
FROM THE GOE TO THE MB IS:  WE WILL NOT LET YOU RE- 
BUILD, EVEN IF YOU ARE KEEPING QUIET.  THE GOVERNMENT 
ENSURES THAT ITS MESSAGE IS WELL DISSEMINATED BY 
INFORMING THE PRESS OF THESE ARRESTS.

16.(C) THE GOE ARREST CAMPAIGNS UNIFORMLY TARGET THE 
MID-RANGE CADRE OF THE MB, LEAVING THE SEPTUAGENARIANS 
IN THE LEADERSHIP UNTOUCHED.  DIFFERENCES HAVE EMERGED 
BETWEEN THESE NOW-LATE 30 SOMETHING ACTIVISTS (WHO LED 
THE SYNDICATE TAKEOVERS IN THE EARLY 1990\'S) AND THE 
OLD GUARD LEADERSHIP OVER ISSUES OF INTERNAL MANAGEMENT 
AND POLICY.  WE HEARD FROM EGYPTIAN OBSERVERS THAT 
SPOKESMAN HODEIBY FILLED SEVERAL VACANT POSITIONS IN 
THE GUIDANCE BUREAU WITHOUT CONVENING A SHURA COUNCIL 
MEETING, AS THE MB RULES STIPULATE.  ACCORDING TO THESE 
OBSERVERS, THE YOUNGER GENERATION ALSO HOLDS MASHOUR 
AND HODEIBY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WASAT GROUP\'S 
DEFECTION.   IN 1996, ABOUT 70 YOUNGER MB ACTIVISTS 
LEFT TO FORM THEIR OWN POLITICAL PARTY, CALLED THE 
WASAT OR CENTER PARTY, AFTER MASHOUR REFUSED TO APPROVE 
THEIR PARTY (REFTEL).  MANY OF THE ORIGINAL WASAT GROUP 
HAS RETURNED TO THE MB BUT, ACCORDING TO MB OBSERVERS, 
THEY CONTINUE TO FEEL LEFT OUT OF POLICY DECISION- 
MAKING.  FINALLY, AT LEAST ONE OBSERVER (DIA RASHWAN OF 
THE AL-AHRAM CENTER) SEES A GROWING RIFT BETWEEN THE 
EGYPTIAN MB AND THE BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS IN OTHER ARAB 
COUNTRIES, ACCENTUATED BY THE SECURITY PRESSURES FELT 
BY THE EGYPTIAN MB.  THE ORGANIZATIONS IN JORDAN, YEMEN 
AND ALGERIA ARE RELATIVELY VIBRANT COMPARED TO THE 
EGYPTIAN GROUP, AND SEEM LESS INCLINED TO FOLLOW 
EGYPTIAN HOME OFFICE GUIDANCE.  FINALLY, OUR MB SOURCES 
SOMEWHAT PARADOXICALLY DO NOT SPEAK WELL OF THE ONLY 
ISLAMIST GOVERNMENT IN THE ARAB WORLD - SUDAN - SINCE 
TURABI\'S NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT SEES ITSELF AS A 
COMPETITOR TO THE MB, SEEKING TO ABSORB SUDAN\'S MB INTO 
ITS OWN \"FRONT.\"

COMMENT 
------- 
 
17. (C) CONDITIONS ARE DIFFICULT FOR THE MB AT PRESENT. 
THE GOE\'S DETERMINED OPPOSITION AND USE OF SECURITY 
SERVICES AND EMERGENCY LAWS KEEPS THE PRESSURE ON.  THE 
EGYPTIAN PUBLIC, AS AN EXHAUSTING BOUT OF ISLAMIST 
TERRORISM WINDS DOWN, SEEMS LESS INTERESTED NOW THAN IT 
WAS A DECADE AGO IN AN ISLAMIST MESSAGE, EVEN THE MB\'S 
SOFT-SELL APPROACH.  NEVERTHELESS, THE MB RETAINS A 
NATION-WIDE ORGANIZATION WITH ROOTS IN THE GROWING 
RANKS OF URBAN PROFESSIONALS, AND IN THE SUEZ CANAL 
CITIES (WHERE IT STARTED), ALEXANDRIA AND PARTS OF THE 
DELTA.   THE MB TAKES A FAMOUSLY LONG VIEW OF ITS 
PROSPECTS, AND IT WILL REMAIN THE LARGEST AND BEST 
ORGANIZED OPPOSITION MOVEMENT IN EGYPT. 
 
--------------- 
NOTE ON SOURCES 
--------------- 
 
18. (C) THE MB IS A BANNED GROUP IN EGYPT.   WHILE THE 
GOVERNMENT USED TO TOLERATE A MORE OPEN MB PRESENCE 
(E.G., THE MB IN 1987 OPENLY JOINED AN OPPOSITION 
COALITION FOR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS), SINCE 1995 IT 
HAS STRICTLY ENFORCED THE BAN.  GIVEN THESE HEIGHTENED 
SENSITIVITIES, EMBASSY CONTACT WITH THE MB FOCUSES ON 
INFLUENTIAL MB MEMBERS WHO ARE ALSO ACTIVE IN THE 
PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES.  WE CALL ON THEM IN THEIR 
CAPACITIES AS SYNDICATE LEADERS, NOT AS MEMBERS OF A 
BANNED GROUP.  OUR CURRENT MB CONTACTS ARE MUHAMMAD 
ABDEL QUDUS AND SALAH ABDEL MAQSUD (BOTH ON THE BOARD 
OF THE JOURNALISTS SYNDICATE), AHMAD SEIF AL-ISLAM 
HASAN AL-BANNA (FORMERLY SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE 
LAWYERS SYNDICATE, AN ACTIVE LAWYER), AND ABUL ELA AL- 
MADI (FOUNDER OF THE MB SPLINTER WASAT PARTY, FORMER 
SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE ENGINEERS SYNDICATE).   WE 
ALSO CONTACT OTHER EGYPTIAN OBSERVERS OF THE MB SCENE. 
THEY ARE DIA RASHWAN AND HALA MUSTAFA OF THE AL-AHRAM 
CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, 
MUHAMMAD SALAH OF AL-HAYAT NEWSPAPER, KHALED DAWOUD OF 
AL-AHRAM NEWSPAPER, RIFAAT SAID, SECRETARY GENERAL OF 
THE TAGAMMU\' PARTY, MAHMOUD ABAZA AND MUHAMMAD KAMIL OF 
THE OPPOSITION WAFD PARTY, AND KAMAL ABUL MAGD, FORMER 
MB MEMBER AND INTERNATIONAL LAWYER.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) THIS IS THE FIRST IN A TWO PART MESSAGE DISCUSSING 
EGYPT\'S MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  PART 1 OUTLINES ITS HISTORY AND 
STRUCTURE, PART 2 OF THE MESSAGE WILL DISCUSS THE BASES FOR 
THE MB\'S POPULARITY AS A POLITICAL FORCE IN EGYPT TODAY. 
EGYPT\'S (ILLEGAL) MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, FOUNDED IN 1928, IS A 
PART OF THE COUNTRY\'S HISTORY AND ITS PRESENT POLITICAL LIFE. 
 THE ORGANIZATION\'S HISTORY IS CHECKERED WITH ATTEMPTS TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS VIOLENT ATTEMPTS TO 
OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.  THE MB IS THE ORGANIZATION FROM 
WHICH THE VIOLENT ELEMENTS, THE GAMA\'A ISLAMIYYA, THE 
EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD AND THE VANGUARDS OF CONQUEST 
SPLINTERED. 
 
2.  (C) DESPITE GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO STIFLE THEIR POLITICAL 
ASPIRATIONS, 17 MUSLIM BROTHERS WERE ELECTED IN FALL 2000 AS 
INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES TO THE NATIONAL PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY AND 
IN FEBRUARY THEY CAPTURED ONE-THIRD OF THE SEATS ON THE BOARD 
OF EGYPT\'S LAWYERS SYNDICATE.  TODAY, THE AGING MB LEADERSHIP 
IS HESITANT TO TURN OVER THE REINS TO YOUNGER MEMBERS, 
CAUSING WHAT SOME VIEW AS AN INTERNAL RIFT.  YOUNGER LEADERS 
ARE THOUGHT TO REPRESENT A MORE CONTEMPORARY AND LIBERAL 
TREND, REFERRED TO AS \"DOVES\" WHILE THE OLDER LEADERS ARE 
THOUGHT TO BE SOMEWHAT SCLEROTIC \"HAWKS.\"  DUE TO THE SECRET 
NATURE OF THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE MB SHURA (CONSULTATIVE) 
COUNCIL, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHO WILL SUCCEED THE CURRENT AGED 
SUPREME GUIDE MUSTAFA MESHHOUR.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
AN HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (U) THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) IS PART OF EGYPT\'S 
HISTORIC AND CURRENT POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.  DESPITE ITS 
ILLEGAL STATUS THE MB IS A SIGNIFICANT FORCE IN CURRENT 
EGYPTIAN POLITICAL LIFE.  FOUNDED BY SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHER 
SHIEKH HASSAN AL BANNA IN ISMAILIA IN 1928, THE ASSOCIATION 
OF MUSLIM BROTHERS WAS THE FIRST WIDE-SCALE, ORGANIZED, 
INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIST MOVEMENT.  SINCE ITS FOUNDING IT HAS 
REMAINED A SEMISECRET ORGANIZATION, WITH A CELLULAR 
ORGANIZATION AND A FOCUS ON ATTRACTING YOUTH.  SOME YOUTH 
GROUPS WERE KNOWN TO BE PARAMILITARY.  THE MB HAS A NETWORK 
OF SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND 
ENTERPRISES.  TITHING (\"ZAKAT\") OF MEMBERS ALSO HELPS TO 
FINANCE THE ORGANIZATION. 
 
4.  (U) IN ADDITION TO PLAYING A PART IN RESISTING AND 
FINALLY ENDING THE BRITISH OCCUPATION OF EGYPT, IN 1948 THE 
MB DEFINED TWO ORGANIZATIONAL OBJECTIVES: IMPLEMENTING AN 
ISLAMIC SOCIAL SYSTEM AND CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIAL SERVICE IN 
EGYPT.  FOR A PERIOD IN BETWEEN WWII AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE 
MILITARY REGIME IN 1952, KING FAROUQ PERMITTED THE MB TO 
FUNCTION AS A POLITICAL PARTY TO COUNTER THE POWER OF THE 
WAFD PARTY.  IN 1948, MB VOLUNTEERS PARTICIPATED IN THE WAR 
FOR PALESTINE.  UPON THEIR RETURN TO CAIRO, THEY WERE ACCUSED 
OF PLOTTING AGAINST THE MONARCHY WITH THE INTENT OF 
ESTABLISHING A THEOCRATIC REPUBLIC.  PRIME MINISTER MAHMOUD 
EL NOQRASHI STRUCK FIRST, ISSUING A DECREE DISSOLVING THE MB, 
IMPOUNDING ITS ASSETS AND ARRESTING ITS MEMBERS.  TWENTY DAYS 
LATER, A YOUNG MB MEMBER ASSASSINATED NOQRASHI.  IN EARLY 
1949, THE MB SUPREME GUIDE EL BANNA WAS MURDERED, IT WAS 
RUMORED, BY GOVERNMENT AGENTS. 
 
5.  (U) AN INTENSE PERIOD OF UNDERGROUND ACTIVITY FOLLOWED. 
A NEW SUPREME GUIDE, HASAN EL HODEIBY TOOK OVER AS HEAD OF 
THE ORGANIZATION.  IN 1951, THE COURT LIFTED THE BAN AND THE 
MB WAS PERMITTED TO RECOVER SOME OF ITS ASSETS AND RESUME 
OVERT ACTIVITIES AFTER THE WAFD PARTY WON THE ELECTIONS AND 
FORMED A NEW GOVERNMENT.  SHORTLY AFTER THE REVOLUTION, A 
1953 DECREE BANNING POLITICAL PARTIES WAS DEEMED NOT TO APPLY 
TO THE MB ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT WAS NOT A POLITICAL PARTY. 
NONETHELESS, IN 1954, NASSER INVOKED THE DECREE, DISSOLVING 
THE MB, WHICH WAS PLOTTING HIS OVERTHROW AND ROUNDED UP 
THOUSANDS OF MBS.  SIX MB LEADERS WERE TRIED, CONVICTED AND 
EXECUTED; 7 WERE SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. 
 
6.  (C) IN 1960, MB DISSENTERS, LEAD BY SAYYED QUTUB, OPENLY 
ADVOCATED THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO OVERTHROW NASSER\'S \"APOSTATE 
REGIME.\"  ONCE AGAIN, MASSIVE ARRESTS OF MB LEADERS AND 
MEMBERS TOOK PLACE.  AFTER NASSER\'S DEATH IN 1970, SADAT 
RELEASED A NUMBER OF JAILED MBS AND THE MAINSTREAM 
ORGANIZATION RENOUNCED VIOLENCE AS A TACTIC.  BOLSTERED BY 
ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH SADAT, THE MB IN 1977 ASKED THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE COURT TO LIFT THE 1954 MILITARY DECREE BANNING 
IT.  THE COURT REFUSED TO OVERTURN THE BAN AND IN 1992 AN 
APPEAL (STILL UNRESOLVED) WAS FILED WITH A HIGHER COURT. 
 
7.  (C) THE MB CARRIED WITH IT TRADITIONS OF IDEALISM AND 
VIOLENCE, PIETY AND TERROR, WHICH HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO 
DISENTANGLE AND SEVER.  AS THE ORGANIZATION TRIED TO MODERATE 
ITS POSTURE IN THE 1970\'S, MILITANT ISLAMIC FACTIONS 
INCLUDING THE GAMA\'A ISLAMIYYA, EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD AND 
VANGUARDS OF CONQUEST SPRANG FROM ITS RANKS.  SINCE THE 
ATTACKS UPON TOURISTS IN CAIRO AND LUXOR IN 1997, EXTREMIST 
ISLAMIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN SEVERELY CRIPPLED BY THE SECURITY 
SERVICES AND POPULARLY DISCREDITED.  LUXOR SEEMED TO DEEPEN 
THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE MB AND ITS EXTREMIST OFFSPRING.  AL 
HAYAT REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING THE ATTACK IN LUXOR, THE MB 
LEADERSHIP WARNED ITS MEMBERS TO HAVE NO CONTACT WITH THE 
ATTACKERS WHO HAVE \"NO RELIGION AND NO CONSCIENCE.\" 
 
------------ 
THE MB TODAY 
------------ 
 
8.  (C) FOR FIFTY YEARS, SUCCESSIVE EGYPTIAN REGIMES HAVE 
ATTEMPTED TO SUPPRESS OR ELIMINATE THE MB, YET THE MOVEMENT 
SURVIVES.  AN ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION SINCE 1954, MB LEADERS ARE 
PERPETUALLY IN AND OUT OF JAIL AS THE GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO 
CONTROL OR SHUT DOWN MB ACTIVITIES, THE MOST OBVIOUS OF WHICH 
CONTINUE TO BE APPLYING AN ISLAMIC SOCIAL SYSTEM AND 
DELIVERING SOCIAL SERVICES.  THEY PARTICIPATED IN THE 
PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY AS SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY MEMBERS IN THE 
1980S.  IN COORDINATION WITH THE SLP, THE MB WON 37 SEATS IN 
THE 1987 LEGISLATURE.  THEIR PROMINENCE CALLED INTO DOUBT 
THEIR COMPETENCE, WITH ONLY DR. ESSAM EL ARIAN RECOGNIZED AS 
A SERIOUS PARLIAMENTARIAN.  THE MB BOYCOTTED THE FOLLOWING 
ELECTIONS UNTIL THE FALL 2000 ELECTIONS.  IN SEPTEMBER 2000, 
DURING A RARE SHOW OF STRENGTH AT THE FUNERAL OF MB SECRETARY 
GENERAL IBRAHIM SHARAF, SUPREME GUIDE MUSTAFA MESHHOUR 
PREDICTED THAT THE MB WOULD ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE IN 
EGYPT BY THE YEAR 2030. 
 
9.  (C) THE ASSOCIATION OF MUSLIM BROTHERS IS HEADED BY A 
SUPREME GUIDE, ASSISTED BY A GENERAL GUIDANCE COUNCIL, 
RESPONSIBLE FOR FORMULATING POLICIES AND RUNNING THE GROUP\'S 
ACTIVITIES, AND BY A SHURA OR CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL.  WE KNOW 
LITTLE ABOUT THE DECISION-MAKING BY THE MB LEADERSHIP WHOSE 
MEETINGS ARE CLANDESTINE.  LIKE A NUMBER OF EGYPTIAN 
POLITICAL PARTIES, THE MB IS TODAY HEADED BY ELDERLY 
LEADERSHIP.  THE ORGANIZATION FACES THE CHALLENGE OF MAKING 
WAY FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION, REPRESENTED BY LEADERS IN 
THEIR 40\'S AND EARLY 50\'S LIKE DR. ESSAM EL ARIAN AND DR. 
IBRAHIM ZAAFARANI OF THE DOCTORS\' SYNDICATE, AND JOURNALIST 
SYNDICATE LEADER SALAH ABDEL MAQSOUD. 
 
10.  (C) THE MB SUPPORTED ABOUT 40 CANDIDATES WHO RAN AS 
INDEPENDENTS IN THE 2000 ELECTIONS FOR THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY 
(LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT).  OF THE 444 ELECTED SEATS, 17 
WENT TO MUSLIM BROTHER INDEPENDENTS.  EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE 
MBS ELECTED ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 45.  THE VAST DIVIDE BETWEEN 
AGED AND YOUTH MEMBERS WAS PERHAPS MOST PRONOUNCED IN 1996 
WHEN YOUNG MB LEADERS JOINED WITH OTHER NON-MB POLITICAL 
CENTRISTS TO SEEK APPROVAL FOR A WASSAT (CENTER) PARTY. 
WASSAT WAS NOT APPROVED BY THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLITICAL PARTIES 
COMMITTEE, BUT THE YOUNG MB\'S REBELLIOUS ACTIONS LED TO A 
RIFT WITHIN THE MB STRUCTURE.  ACCORDING TO ONE ISLAMIST 
EXPERT, \"FOR THE FIRST TIME IN RECOLLECTION, MB LEADERSHIP 
AND ITS CENTRALIZED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE CAME UNDER FIRE 
FROM RANK AND FILE MEMBERS.\"  THE PRAGMATIC, DYNAMIC YOUNG 
MBS INCLUDING EL ARIAN, MAQSOUD AND ZAAFARANI, IMPRISONED 
FROM 1995-2000 WERE INCAPABLE OF PULLING THE ORGANIZATION 
BACK FROM THE BRINK OF DISCORD AND DEMORALIZATION.  WASAT 
SYMPATHIZERS REMAIN OUTSIDE THE MB MAINSTREAM TODAY.  THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S METHOD OF COPING WITH THE POPULARITY OF YOUNGER 
MB LEADERSHIP CONTINUES TO BE DETENTION, TRIAL, AND 
IMPRISONMENT.  IN NOVEMBER 2000, 15 MBS, MOST OF THEM 
PROFESSIONALS ACTIVE IN THE SYNDICATES AND POTENTIAL 
CANDIDATES FOR THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY, WERE SENTENCED TO 3-5 
YEARS IN PRISON FOR MEMBERSHIP IN AN ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION AND 
RELATED CHARGES. 
 
----------------------------------- 
HAWKS AND DOVES -- A GENERATION GAP 
----------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) MOST LEADERS OF THE MB TODAY APPEAR TO FALL INTO 
EITHER \"HAWK\" OR \"DOVE\" CAMPS.  SUPREME GUIDE MESHHOUR 
REPRESENTS THE OLD GUARD, THE MORE \"HAWKISH\" LEADERSHIP, 
REVOLUTIONARIES REARED DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD, SOME 
ACCUSED OF VIOLENT ACTS.  TODAY, HE CLAIMS, THE GOVERNMENT 
FEARS THE FACT THAT THE MB IS A \"WELL-ORGANIZED ENTITY\" 
RATHER THAN AN ADVOCATE OF VIOLENCE.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE 
BOTH THE GENERATION GAP AND THE DIFFERENCE IN VIEWS AND 
TACTICS HAVE BEEN SOURCES OF CONTENTION BETWEEN THE HAWKS AND 
THE DOVES WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION.  ACCORDING TO AL AHRAM 
WRITER OMAYMA ABDEL-LATIF, THE HAWKS INCLUDE MESHHOUR, MB 
SPOKESMAN MAHMOUN EL HODEIBI, ABBAS EL SISSI AND MAHMOUD 
EZZAT IBRAHIM, SOMETIMES MENTIONED AS A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR TO 
MESHHOUR.  OTHER HARD LINERS INCLUDE ABDEL MONEIM ABDUL 
FUTUH, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PHYSICIANS\' SYNDICATE; 
MOHAMED EL SAYED HABIB, FORMER MP AND PROFESSOR AT ASSIYUT 
UNIVERSITY; AND MOHAMED MAHDI AKEF, FORMER HEAD OF THE 
ISLAMIC CENTER IN MUNICH. 
 
12.  (C)  DR. ESSAM EL ARIAN, ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL OF 
THE PHYSICIANS\' SYNDICATE REPRESENTS THE YOUNGER, DOVE 
GENERATION OF LEADERS.  ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS GROUP ARE SEIF 
EL ISLAM EL BANNA, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE LAWYERS\' 
SYNDICATE AND SON OF THE MB FOUNDER;  IBRAHIM EL ZAAFARANI 
SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PHYSICIANS\' SYNDICATE IN ALEXANDRIA 
AND SALAH ABDEL MAQSOUD OF THE JOURNALISTS SYNDICATE. 
POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR IMED SHAHEEN BELIEVES THE YOUNGER 
GENERATION HAS A \"NEW VISION.\"  BRED ON THE CAMPUSES, THEY 
ARE \"POLITICIANS\" RATHER THAN \"REVOLUTIONARIES.\"   ZAAFARANI 
TOLD POLOFF LAST FALL THAT THE MB DOES NOT CONDONE VIOLENCE 
AND HE INDICATED HE WANTED TO OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH THE U.S. 
ESSAM EL ARIAN EXPLAINED TO AL AHRAM IN OCTOBER 2000, \"... 
THE BROTHERHOOD WAS NEVER INVOLVED IN ANY ACT OF VIOLENCE 
(NOTE: PRESUMABLY, IN HIS EXPERIENCE)... WHEN (THEY) WERE PUT 
ON TRIAL, THEY WERE NEVER ACCUSED OF USING VIOLENCE... WE ARE 
AGAINST ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE...\" 
 
---------------------- 
SECRECY AND SUCCESSION 
---------------------- 
 
13.  (C) ASKED ABOUT CONCRETE PLANS FOR SUCCESSION TO AVOID A 
POWER VACUUM, EL ARIAN TOLD AL AHRAM NEWSPAPER, \"ALL MATTERS 
ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE (MB) SHURA COUNCIL.\" 
ACCORDING TO STATUTES SET BY ITS FOUNDER IN 1928 AND 
REPORTEDLY AMENDED IN 1992, A CANDIDATE FOR THE POST OF 
SUPREME GUIDE MUST BE FROM THE 120-MEMBER SHURA COUNCIL.  MB 
CHAPTERS OUTSIDE EGYPT WILL ALSO HAVE A SAY IN SELECTING THE 
NEW LEADER, ACCORDING TO ARIAN.  SPECIFICS AND CRITERIA FOR 
CHOOSING A NEW LEADER ARE NOT CLEAR.  MB SPOKESMAN EL HODEIBI 
ADMITTED TO AL AHRAM IN MARCH THAT, \"CONVENING THE (SHURA) 
COUNCIL WOULD IN ITSELF LEAD TO ARREST.\"  THE GOVERNMENT 
CONSIDERS MEMBERSHIP IN THE MB SHURA COUNCIL A CRIMINAL 
MATTER, ACCORDING TO MB SOURCES. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
14.  (C) DUE TO THE MB CODE OF SECRECY CONCERNING ITS 
DELIBERATIONS AND PLANS AS WELL AS EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT ANGST 
WITH MB ELECTORAL ACTIVITIES AND RECENT GAINS BOTH IN THE 
PARLIAMENT AND THE LAWYERS\' SYNDICATE, MB MEMBERS HAVE BEEN 
HESITANT TO SPEAK WITH EMBASSY OFFICERS ABOUT THE MB.  WE 
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE LIKELY SUCCESSOR TO MUSTAFA 
MESHHOUR, NOW 80 YEARS OLD.  GIVEN THE ORGANIZATIONAL 
STRUCTURE AND SPLIT WITHIN THE POLITICAL CAMPS, SELECTION OF 
THE NEXT SUPREME GUIDE WILL LIKELY REPRESENT A STRUGGLE 
BETWEEN THE HAWKS AND THE DOVES.  GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT 
WHO IS ACTUALLY ON THE SHURA COUNCIL, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHICH 
SIDE IS LIKELY TO WIN, ALTHOUGH ACADEMICS FAMILIAR WITH THE 
MB INDICATE MESHHOUR\'S SUCCESSOR WILL LIKELY COME FROM THE 
\"DOVE\" GENERATION. 
 
15.  (C) DESPITE ITS INTERNAL CHALLENGES, THE SPECTER OF 
GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE, AND ARREST OF ITS MEMBERS, THE MB 
ENJOYS A DEGREE OF POLITICAL POPULARITY AMONG EGYPTIANS, 
WHICH WE WILL EXAMINE IN THE SECOND CABLE IN THIS SERIES.

POLITICAL FORCE 
 
REF: CAIRO 3303 
 
CLASSIFIED BY DCM RENO HARNISH FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) IN THIS, THE SECOND OF TWO CABLES ON EGYPT\'S MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD (MB), WE LOOK AT THE BANNED MOVEMENT\'S POPULARITY 
AND ITS SOURCES.  DESPITE INTERNAL TENSIONS AND IMPRISONMENT 
OF THE MOST DYNAMIC OF ITS YOUNG LEADERS SINCE THE 
MID-1990\'S, THE MB HAS ENJOYED AN UPSURGE IN POPULARITY, 
WINNING 17 PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY (PA) SEATS IN THE FALL 2000 
ELECTIONS AND A RETURN TO THE BOARD OF THE BAR SYNDICATE IN 
FEBRUARY ELECTIONS.  REASONS FOR THEIR POPULARITY ARE MANY; 
AMONG THEM ARE PERCEPTIONS THAT THEY ARE NOT CORRUPT, THEY 
ARE THE ONLY REAL POLITICAL OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT AND 
RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AND THAT THEY HAVE AN 
EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION AND DISCIPLINED MEMBERSHIP. 
 
2.  (C) PUBLIC OUTREACH TO ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS HAS 
INCREASED MB POPULARITY WHICH IS STRONGEST AMONG THE POOR. 
BUT THEY ARE NOT UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED.  INTELLECTUALS - 
WHETHER SECULAR OR RELIGIOUS - MISTRUST THE GROUP AND 
QUESTION ITS POLITICAL VIABILITY IN A DEMOCRACY AND ITS 
RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS.  DETRACTORS CLAIM THERE IS CORRUPTION 
WITHIN MB RANKS AND CONTINUE TO SUSPECT THAT IT HAS A 
CAPACITY FOR VIOLENCE. 
 
3.  (C) MB INDEPENDENTS ELECTED TO THE PA LAST FALL TRIED 
BRIEFLY TO COEXIST WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BUT THE EFFORT WAS 
SHORT-LIVED.  IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THE MB HAVE TAKEN ON 
KEY GOVERNMENT MINISTERS DURING PA SESSIONS AND HAVE AROUSED 
PUBLIC SENTIMENT WITH THEIR STRONG ANTI-GOVERNMENT POSITIONS 
ON DOMESTIC AND REGIONAL ISSUES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING 
TO ISRAEL AND STRIDENT SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIANS.  THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONDED, MAKING CLEAR THAT IT, NOT THE MB, 
IS SETTING THE POLITICAL AGENDA.  END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------- 
POPULAR REACTIONS TO THE MB 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) DESPITE GOVERNMENT REPRESSION AND THEIR OWN INTERNAL 
PROBLEMS (SEE REFTEL) IN RECENT YEARS, EGYPT\'S MUSLIM 
BROTHERS (MB) ARE ENJOYING AN UPSURGE IN POPULARITY.  THEIR 
SUCCESS IN THE FALL 2000 PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY (PA) ELECTIONS, 
ALBEIT AS INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES, AND IN THE LAWYERS\' 
SYNDICATE ELECTIONS IN FEBRUARY, ATTEST TO THIS.  DESPITE AN 
INTENSIVE CAMPAIGN OF ARRESTS AND HARASSMENT, OF 40 MB 
INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES FOR THE PA, 17 WON SEATS.  IN THE 
LAWYERS\' SYNDICATE ELECTIONS MB CANDIDATES WON 8 OF 24 SEATS 
ON THE BOARD.  IN AN ERA OF PERCEIVED VAST CORRUPTION, HIGH 
UNEMPLOYMENT, UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND PRIVILEGES, 
AND OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, THE MB ARE GAINING GROUND.  MANY 
EGYPTIANS SYMPATHIZE WITH THE SIMPLE, DIRECT MESSAGE, \"ISLAM 
IS THE SOLUTION,\" AS WELL AS WITH THE IMAGES IT PROJECTS 
REGARDING ITS PURITY OF RELIGIOUS VALUES AND THE PROVISION OF 
 SOCIAL SERVICES.  ACCORDING TO ITS LEADERS, THE MB ADVOCATE 
STRONGER ISLAMIC INFLUENCE IN SOCIETY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. 
INTERESTED IN THE COMMON WELFARE OF THE AVERAGE EGYPTIAN, 
THEY PROJECT THEMSELVES AND ARE PERCEIVED BY MANY AS THE 
ANTITHESIS OF A CORRUPT, WEALTHY, SECULAR RULING ELITE. 
 
5.  (C) WHILE MANY, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE POOREST, BELIEVE 
THE MB SINCERE IN ITS OBJECTIVES, MANY ISLAMIST AND SECULAR 
INTELLECTUALS WITH WHOM WE SPOKE BELIEVE THE SIMPLICITY OF 
THEIR MESSAGE CONCEALS A POLICY VACUUM AT BEST, OR NEFARIOUS 
INTENTIONS AT WORST.  ANTI-MB INTELLECTUALS CLAIM THAT THE 
ORGANIZATION IS POISED AT ANY OPPORTUNE MOMENT TO USE 
VIOLENCE TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES.  TOO LITTLE, THEY SAY, IS 
KNOWN ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION\'S STRUCTURE AND POLITICS (SEE 
REFTEL).  FOR INSTANCE, WHO ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE MB 
GOVERNING BOARD AND WHAT DECISIONS ARE THEY MAKING?  LITTLE 
IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF ITS MEMBERSHIP AND 
LESS ABOUT THEIR STRATEGY FOR SPREADING MB INFLUENCE AND 
IDEAS IN EGYPTIAN SOCIETY. 
 
--------------------------- 
THE ONLY OPPOSITION IN TOWN 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) AFTER THE GOVERNMENT\'S TARGETING OF THE MB IN 1994 
AND 1995, THE ORGANIZATION EFFECTIVELY WENT UNDERGROUND UNTIL 
2000 WHEN SOME OF THE TOP YOUNG LEADERS WERE RELEASED FROM 
PRISON.  ONE ACADEMIC ARGUED THAT THE MB HAD TO SHOW ITS FACE 
TO SURVIVE.  \"THEY HAD NO CHOICE.  THEY NEEDED TO PROVE THAT 
THE CRACKDOWN HAS NOT BROKEN THEM AND THAT THEY CONTINUE TO 
EXIST AS A VIABLE MOVEMENT.\"  DESPITE THE PRE-ELECTION 
CRACKDOWN, THE MB PROVIDED DISCIPLINED SUPPORT TO ITS 
CANDIDATES IN THE FALL 2000 PA ELECTIONS, UNLIKE OTHER 
PARTIES INCLUDING THE RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (NDP). 
 
7.  (C) THE MB\'S INFLUENCE WAS AMPLIFIED BY THE LACK OF A 
SECULAR OPPOSITION POLITICAL MOVEMENT IN EGYPT WHICH 
CONSTITUTED A CREDIBLE POLITICAL ALTERNATIVE TO THE RULING 
PARTY AT ELECTION TIME.  ACADEMICS ESTIMATE THE POLITICALLY 
ACTIVE SECTOR OF THIS SOCIETY RANGES BETWEEN 2-8%, DEPENDING 
UPON THE TIME (E.G. ELECTIONS) AND THE ISSUE (E.G. 
CORRUPTION).  IN THE FALL 2000 PA ELECTIONS, MB CANDIDATES 
CAPTURED THE POPULAR TIDE OF VOTES AGAINST THE (RULING) NDP 
IN THE SMALL NUMBER OF DISTRICTS WHERE THEY FIELDED 
CANDIDATES.  DESPITE MANY ARRESTS, HARSH TREATMENT OF MB 
MEMBERS AND SYMPATHIZERS AND ITS STATUS AS AN ILLEGAL PARTY, 
THE 40 MB CANDIDATES RUNNING AS \"INDEPENDENTS\" MANAGED TO WIN 
17 PA SEATS.  THEY RECENTLY CINCHED ONE-THIRD (8) OF THE 
BOARD SEATS IN THE EGYPTIAN BAR SYNDICATE IN ITS FIRST 
ELECTIONS SINCE 1992.  THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT 
INFLUENCE IN ALL EGYPTIAN LABOR AND PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES, 
MANY HOLDING SEATS ON UNION BOARDS FROZEN FOR THAT VERY 
REASON BY THE GOVERNMENT IN 1996.  WHILE NO MB POPULARITY 
POLLS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED, ESTIMATES THAT THEY COULD GAIN 20 
TO 30 PERCENT OF PARLIAMENTARY SEATS IN A FREE AND FAIR 
ELECTION SEEM PLAUSIBLE. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
STRONG POLITICAL ORGANIZATION AND DISCIPLINE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) IN THE FALL 2000 PA ELECTIONS AND AGAIN IN THE BAR 
SYNDICATE IN FEBRUARY, THE MB DEMONSTRATED BETTER 
ORGANIZATION AND MORE PARTY DISCIPLINE THAN OTHER PARTIES AND 
CANDIDATES.  A FORMER DIRECTOR OF STATE SECURITY TOLD \"ROSE 
EL YOUSSEF\" MAGAZINE ON APRIL 21, 2001 THAT THE VICTORY OF 
THE MB IN THE PA ELECTIONS \"WAS NOT A RESULT OF THEIR 
STRENGTH IN PROPAGATING THEIR IDEOLOGY, BUT (WAS) A RESULT OF 
THE PASSIVENESS AND LACK OF ORGANIZATION OF OTHER FORCES ON 
THE POLITICAL SCENE.\"  NDP AND OPPOSITION PARTY OFFICIALS 
HAVE COME TO THE SAME REALIZATION.  ISLAMIC AND SECULAR 
INTELLECTUALS DOUBT THAT WERE THE MB TO GAIN A SIGNIFICANT 
NUMBER OF SEATS IN THE PARLIAMENT THAT THEY WOULD BE 
REELECTED TO SECOND TERMS, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO MEANINGFUL 
MESSAGE.  THE GOVERNMENT PREVENTED THEM FROM RUNNING IN THE 
SHURA COUNCIL (UPPER HOUSE) ELECTIONS HELD MAY 16-JUNE 12 BY 
ARRESTING CANDIDATES AND SUPPORTERS IN PRE-ELECTION SWEEPS, A 
RE-PLAY OF STEPS TAKEN BEFORE THE PA ELECTIONS.  OF A 
POSSIBLE 20 INDEPENDENT MB CANDIDATES, ONLY ONE REMAINED BY 
ELECTION TIME TO RUN FOR A SHURA COUNCIL SEAT.  HE DID NOT 
WIN.  THE SUCCESS OF THE MB WHEN IT IS PERMITTED TO RUN IS 
DUE IN PART TO THE INABILITY OF THE RULING AND OPPOSITION 
PARTIES TO ORGANIZE OR IMPROVE PARTY DISCIPLINE AND TO PUT 
FORWARD POPULAR CANDIDATES. 
 
-------------------------- 
OUTREACH KEY TO POPULARITY 
-------------------------- 
 
9.  (U) MUSLIM BROTHERS\' OUTREACH IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE 
POOR BUT THEIR SERVICES ARE NOT LIMITED ONLY TO THE POOR. 
THEY ARE ACTIVELY DELIVERING EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE AND LEGAL 
SERVICES TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT.  THEY ARE INVOLVED IN 
ALL THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (SYNDICATES) AND ARE THE 
BACKBONE OF THE EGYPTIAN MEDICAL AND TEACHERS\' SYNDICATES. 
WITHIN THE SYNDICATES THEY HAVE REACHED OUT TO A BROAD 
AUDIENCE, BY FOR INSTANCE, OFFERING MEMBERS REDUCED PRICE 
MEDICAL COVERAGE.  IN THE JOURNALISTS\' SYNDICATE, THE MB 
HELPED MEMBERS TO GET INCREASED BENEFITS INCLUDING SUBSIDIZED 
HOUSING AND CREDIT CARDS (WITH A US$1,500 LIMIT), A BENEFIT 
VIEWED VERY POSITIVELY EVEN BY ANTI-MB JOURNALISTS. 
 
10.  (U) DOCTORS AND NURSES PROVIDE INEXPENSIVE, SOMETIMES 
FREE MEDICAL CARE TO THE POOR FOR WHOM THERE ARE NO OR 
INSUFFICIENT GOVERNMENT SERVICES.  WHILE THE MB SOMETIMES 
OPERATE  MEDICAL CLINICS AT MOSQUES, THE LACK OF INFORMATION 
ABOUT WHO IS ACTUALLY AN MB MEMBER HAS SOMETIMES RESULTED IN 
BENEFICIARIES THINKING THE MB HAS HELPED THEM WHEN IT HAS 
NOT.  THE MB-DOMINATED DOCTORS\' SYNDICATE HAS MADE IT 
POSSIBLE FOR MEMBERS OF ALL SYNDICATES TO OBTAIN REASONABLY 
PRICED HEALTH INSURANCE.  THE MB REPORTEDLY PROVIDES 
STIPENDS, COVERING LIVING AND BOOK EXPENSES, TO POOR MB 
STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITIES.  MB SHOP OWNERS PROVIDE SUBSIDIZED, 
SOMETIMES FREE, FOOD AND CLOTHING TO THE NEEDY IN 
IMPOVERISHED AREAS.  THE MB IS FILLING A GAP IN A SOCIETY 
WITH FEW GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND POOR ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE 
THAT EXIST. 
 
11.  (C) MANY KNOWN MUSLIM BROTHER LEADERS ARE FROM EDUCATED, 
SOMETIMES WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUNDS.  THE LEADERS ARE 
INVOLVED IN MOST ASPECTS OF PROFESSIONAL AND COMMERCIAL LIFE 
IN EGYPT: MEDICINE, LAW, ENGINEERING, EDUCATION, AND 
BUSINESS, FROM SMALL STORES AND BASIC SERVICES TO HEADING 
LARGE COMPANIES.  A LARGE AMOUNT OF THEIR FINANCING IS 
THOUGHT TO COME FROM ABROAD, PRINCIPALLY FROM SAUDI SOURCES, 
INTERESTED IN PROMOTING A MORE CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS TREND 
IN EGYPT. 
 
------------------- 
CONTROVERSY ABOUNDS 
------------------- 
 
12.  (C) THE MB\'S POPULAR IMAGE IS NOT WITHOUT CONTROVERSY. 
WHEN THE BAR SYNDICATE WAS JUDICIALLY SEQUESTERED IN 1996, IT 
WAS ON THE BASIS OF A COMPLAINT BY NON-MB LAWYERS THAT MB 
SYNDICAL LEADERS WERE DISPENSING THE SYNDICATE\'S CONTRACTS 
AND LOANS TO MB SUPPORTERS, CHANNELING EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES AND PROFITS TO MB COMPANIES.  (IN THIS WAY, 
THEIR OPERATIONS MIRRORED THAT OF THE RULING PARTY.) 
NONETHELESS, THEY ARE BROADLY PERCEIVED AS MORE HONEST THAN 
THE RULING NDP. 
 
13.  (C) ONE PROFESSOR ASKED RHETORICALLY, \"THINGS ARE SO 
BAD, COULD THEY (THE MB) REALLY BE ANY WORSE?\"  A WELL-KNOWN 
ISLAMIST LAWYER HOWEVER, TAKES ISSUE WITH THAT CONTENTION, 
\"THEIR POPULARITY RESTS ON A SLOGAN... THEY HAVE NO ANSWERS, 
NO SOLUTIONS TO EGYPT\'S VERY REAL PROBLEMS (PARTICULARLY) THE 
ECONOMIC CRISIS - THE MOST SERIOUS OF EGYPT\'S PROBLEMS,\" HE 
STRESSED.  ANALYSIS OF MB ACTIVITIES IN THE PA, HE AND OTHERS 
SAY, SUPPORTS THE CLAIM THAT THE MB HAS NO SOLUTIONS.  \"THE 
MB IS ABSORBED WITH PAROCHIAL, RELIGIOUS ISSUES RATHER THAN 
ISSUES OF NATIONAL CONSEQUENCE,\" A POLITICAL SCIENCE 
PROFESSOR ASSESSED.  AN NDP PA MEMBER COMMENTED THAT MB 
MEMBERS ARE COMPLETELY IGNORANT OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES, 
CONSEQUENTLY  WASTING A GREAT DEAL OF THE ASSEMBLY\'S TIME. 
 
----------------------------------- 
REGIONAL ISSUES WORK IN THEIR FAVOR 
----------------------------------- 
 
14.  (C) REGIONAL POLITICS HAVE BOLSTERED THE MB\'S IMAGE. 
RISING DISCONTENT OVER ISRAEL\'S TREATMENT OF THE PALESTINIANS 
AND WHAT IS PERCEIVED AS A HALF-HEARTED RESPONSE BY ARAB 
LEADERS HAVE STRENGTHENED THE MB, WHO HAVE MADE A NAME FOR 
THEMSELVES AS STAUNCH SUPPORTERS OF THE PALESTINIANS.  THEY 
ARE THE MAIN INSTIGATORS OF PRO-PALESTINIAN AND 
ANTI-ISRAEL/U.S. DEMONSTRATIONS ON THE CAMPUSES AND AT THE 
SYNDICATES AND ARE THE BENEFICIARIES OF POPULAR ANGER OVER 
THE AL AQSA INTIFADA.  MANY OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS, INCLUDING 
AN EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENTIST, REMIND US THAT THE 
MB RIDE THE TIDE OF POPULAR CONCERNS: ANTI-CORRUPTION, 
PRO-PALESTINE, ANTI-ISRAEL AND THE PEACE PROCESS.  THEY ARE 
USING THESE HOT ISSUES, HE ESTIMATES, TO \"PENETRATE\" STUDENT 
UNIONS AND PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES.  THE PROFESSOR, LIKE MANY 
EGYPTIANS, BELIEVES THE MB HAS NO STRATEGY PER SE OTHER THAN 
GAINING POWER.  HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN 
INCREASING THEIR OUTREACH BEYOND A COMMITTED NUCLEUS, BUT HE 
BELIEVES THAT IS STILL MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE OUTREACH BY 
MOST POLITICAL PARTIES. 
 
--------------------------------- 
\"OBJECTIVE OPPOSITION\" TURNS SOUR 
--------------------------------- 
 
15.  (C) DESPITE MASSIVE ARRESTS, TRIAL AND IMPRISONMENT OF 
RESPECTED MB LEADERS IN RECENT YEARS, THE ORGANIZATION 
CONTINUES.  THE ELECTORAL VICTORY OF 17 MUSLIM BROTHERS IN 
THE FALL ELECTIONS REPRESENTS A CHALLENGE TO THE GOVERNMENT. 
MB\'S ARE AN ILLEGAL BUT DE FACTO BLOC IN THE PARLIAMENT. 
INITIALLY, MB PARLIAMENTARIANS SEEMED TO PLAY THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S GAME.  OBSERVERS SPECULATED THAT A TRUCE OF 
SORTS HAD BEEN DECLARED BETWEEN THE MB AND STATE SECURITY. 
UNDER WHAT MB MP HAMDI HASSAN TERMED A POLICY OF \"OBJECTIVE 
OPPOSITION\" (TO GOVERNMENT POLICIES), HE TOLD AL AHRAM 
NEWSPAPER, \"THE BROTHERHOOD\'S DEPUTIES CALLED INTO QUESTION 
THE STATE\'S PUBLISHING THREE \"PORNOGRAPHIC\" BOOKS, WHICH WERE 
CONSEQUENTLY WITHDRAWN TO AVOID A POTENTIALLY DAMAGING 
DEBATE.\"  HE ADDED THAT THE MB DID NOT OBJECT TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER\'S JANUARY 22 GOVERNMENT POLICY STATEMENT.  \"WE 
WANTED TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE (MB) PRESENCE... 
SHOULD NOT TRIGGER EXCESSIVE FEARS.  (OUR) PRESENCE DOES 
REALLY GO IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRACY AND NOT AGAINST IT...\" 
 
16.  (C) HOWEVER, ON APRIL 21, THE 17 MB MP\'S STORMED OUT OF 
PARLIAMENT, PROTESTING THE SPEAKER\'S REFUSAL TO GIVE THEM THE 
FLOOR TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF ARREST OF 2 MB SHURA COUNCIL 
CANDIDATES.  FOLLOWING THIS CONFRONTATION, THE MB BLOC 
SUBMITTED TO THE SPEAKER A LONG LIST OF QUESTIONS 
\"EMBARRASSING\" TO THE GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO ONE 
PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.  THEY CALL UPON THE GOVERNMENT TO 
CANCEL THE \"MISS EGYPT\" PAGEANT; QUESTION THE MORALITY OF AN 
ARTICLE IN THE STATE-OWNED FILM MAGAZINE, \"THE STARS\"; ACCUSE 
THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR OF IGNORING VIOLENCE IN THE SCHOOLS; 
AND REQUEST PARLIAMENTARY SESSIONS PAUSE REGULARLY FOR 
PRAYERS.  TARGETED MINISTERS INCLUDE THE POWERFUL MINISTERS 
OF AGRICULTURE YOUSSEF WALY, OF INFORMATION SAFWAT SHERIF AND 
CULTURE MINISTER FAROUQ HOSNI.  THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO GARNER 
PUBLIC SUPPORT WITH TIRADES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, 
CORRUPTION, AND AGAINST EDUCATION MINISTER BAHA EDDIN FOR 
REASSIGNING THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS TO ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS 
BECAUSE THEY WERE MB SUPPORTERS AT A TIME WHEN THE RATE OF 
ILLITERACY AND LACK OF EDUCATION ARE PROFOUND SOCIAL 
CONCERNS. 
 
---------------- 
FUTURE PROSPECTS 
---------------- 
 
17.  (C) TO CONTINUE TO GROW BEYOND ITS CURRENT SUPPORTERS, 
THE MB DEPENDS ON UNREST IN THE REGION, POPULAR DISCONTENT 
OVER GOVERNMENT MISMANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY, CORRUPTION AND 
UNEMPLOYMENT.  THE AVERAGE EGYPTIAN BELIEVES THAT THINGS 
CAN\'T REALLY GET MUCH WORSE WERE THE MB MORE INFLUENTIAL. 
THEY MIGHT EVEN GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO THE PEOPLE.  THE 
MIDDLE CLASS JUST \"WANTS TO GET BY\" WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM 
THE GOVERNMENT OR RELIGIOUS TYPES.  INTELLECTUALS TEND TO BE 
STRIDENTLY ANTI-MB.  AS AN NDP POLITICIAN AND JOURNALIST 
COMMENTED, \"IF ONLY 6 PERCENT OF EGYPTIANS ARE POLITICIZED, A 
LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE PRO-MB.\"  HOWEVER, HE AND OUR 
OTHER INTERLOCUTORS BELIEVE THAT THE MB ARE NOT SO POPULAR 
NOR IS THEIR BASE OF SUPPORT SO SIGNIFICANT THAT THEY COULD 
TAKE OVER THE REINS OF POWER TODAY, OR IN THE VERY NEAR 
FUTURE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
18.  (C) WHILE THE MB HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESUME A 
PLACE ON THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, THEIR POWER AND INFLUENCE 
REMAIN LIMITED.  STATE SECURITY FORCES MAINTAIN THE MB IN A 
TIGHT VISE SINCE THE BAR SYNDICATE ELECTIONS AND HAVE MADE IT 
CLEAR THAT THEY WILL WIN NO MORE POWER OFFICIALLY FOR THE 
TIME BEING.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MB REPRESENTS A 
SERIOUS THREAT TO THE GOE.  IT IS NOT CAPABLE OF SEIZING 
POWER AND MANY OF ITS YOUNGER MEMBERS SEEM TO FAVOR POLITICAL 
ADVANCEMENT THROUGH ELECTIONS.  IN THE CONTINUED ABSENCE OF 
SECULAR OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES THE MB WILL CONTINUE TO 
REPRESENT FOR MANY THE ONLY VIABLE POLITICAL OPPOSITION.

OFFICIAL CONTACTS 
----------------- 
 
1.  THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT REACTED QUICKLY TO THE HORRIFIC 
EVENTS IN THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11.  A CLEARLY 
DISTRAUGHT PRESIDENT MUBARAK APPEARED ON TELEVISION, 
EXPRESSING SORROW AND SADNESS AT THE EVENTS.  HE LATER CALLED 
A CABINET MEETING, DIRECTING THAT ALL FORMS OF ASSISTANCE BE 
OFFERED TO THE EMBASSY.  DEFENSE MINISTER TANTAWI, AS WELL AS 
FOREIGN MINISTER MAHER, WERE IN CONTACT WITH THE AMBASSADOR 
DURING THE EVENING TO INSURE THAT U.S. NEEDS WERE MET.  ARAB 
LEAGUE SECRETARY-GENERAL AMR MOUSSA PHONED THE AMBASSADOR TO 
EXPRESS CONDOLENCES, AND IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS EXPRESSED 
THE SAME SENTIMENTS.  AFTERNOON OF SEPTEMBER 12, SHEIKH 
TANTAWI OF AL-AZHAR TOLD \"WAFD\" REPORTER THAT HE WAS PAINED 
BY THIS ACT AND OFFERED CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES. AT THE SAME TIME, HE CONDEMNED ACTS COMMITTED BY 
ISRAEL AND ASKED THAT THE U.S. NOT JUMP TO QUICK CONCLUSIONS 
AS TO THE PERPETRATORS. 
 
--------- 
THE MEDIA 
--------- 
 
2.  MOST PAPERS FRONT-PAGED MUBARAK\'S STATEMENTS OF SYMPATHY, 
CONDOLENCES, AND DENUNCIATION OF TERRORIST ATTACKS \"UNDER ANY 
CIRCUMSTANCES.\" PAPERS ALSO QUOTED PRESIDENT BUSH ON HOW 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE WOULD BE IDENTIFIED AND PUNISHED.  MOST 
PAPERS REPORTED THE CLOSURE OF THE EMBASSY. 
 
3.  POPULAR TV MORNING CURRENT AFFAIRS PROGRAM \"SUBAH 
AL-KHAYR\" INTERVIEWED AN EGYPTIAN GENERAL WHO SAID THE 
ATTACKS REVEAL THE WEAKNESS OF AMERICAN SECURITY AND THE 
ABSENCE OF A CAPABLE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.  ANOTHER EGYPTIAN 
MILITARY EXPERT WAS SHOWN ON T.V. SAYING, THAT GLOBALIZATION, 
THE GULF WAR, AND THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT WERE 
PROBABLE MOTIVES FOR THE ATTACK, ADDING THAT THE OPERATION 
WAS BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF ANY NON-STATE ENTITY. 
EDITORIAL COMMENT PREDICTABLY RUNS THE GAMUT FROM SOLE 
CONDOLENCE AND CONDEMNATION TO A MIXED MESSAGE COMBINING THE 
ABOVE BUT LINKING THE ATTACKS TO ALLEGED U.S. SUPPORT FOR 
ISRAELI \"TERRORISM.\" 
 
------ 
OTHERS 
------ 
 
4.  THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) ISSUED A STATEMENT OF SHOCK, 
EXPRESSING REGRET AT THIS ATTCK AGAINST ALL HUMAN VALUES. 
THE MB ALSO DENOUNCED \"ALL AGGRESSION AGAINST HUMAN VALUES 
THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE.\" 
 
-------------------- 
ON THE SECURITY SIDE 
-------------------- 
 
5.  CONTACTS REPORT THAT SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS (NFI) WERE 
ARRESTED IN HOMES AND COFFEEHOUSES BY POLICE AND HAULED OFF 
IN SECURITY VANS IN THE PYRAMIDS-KERDASSA AREA LAST NIGHT. 
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF CAIRO WILL STAY CLOSED THROUGH 
SEPTEMBER 12.  AIRPORT SECURITY IS REPORTEDLY EXTREMELY TIGHT.

FROM THE STREET

6.  AS EXPECTED, PUBLIC OPINION RAN THE GAMUT FROM COMPLETE 
SYMPATHY TO DOWNRIGHT SATISFACTION.  WE AND OUR FSN STAFF 
CANVASSED REACTION OF INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT SOCIAL, 
ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL GROUPS.  THOSE FROM POLITICAL 
PARTIES, NGOS, HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE 
KILLING OF CIVILIANS, WITH MANY ADDING THAT THE ATTACKS, 
UNFORTUNATELY REFLECTED THE PROBLEMS WITH U.S. POLICY IN THE 
REGION.  A MINORITY EXPRESSED SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS BUT 
HAD NO VIEW ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ON THE POLITICS OF THE 
ATTACKS.  FINALLY, NEWS VENDORS, SERVANTS, CAB DRIVERS, AND 
COFFEEHOUSE PATRONS GENERALLY EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH THE 
ATTACKS, SAYING THAT PALESTINIANS HAD EXPERIENCED THIS FOR 
MANY YEARS, NOW, FINALLY, IT WAS AMERICA\'S TURN. 
INTERESTINGLY, A LEFT-LEANING CONTACT AND OWNER OF A 
COFFEESHOP TOLD US THAT AFTER THE FIRST REPORTS OF A 
TERRORIST ATTACK OCCURRED IN THE U.S., THERE WAS A GENERAL 
SENSE AMONG THE SEVERAL PATRONS THAT THE U.S. WOULD KNOW NOW 
\"HOW IT FELT.\" HOWEVER, AFTER THE MAGNITUDE OF THE 
DESTRUCTION BEGAN TO BE TELEVISED, OUR CONTACT REPORTED THAT 
SILENCE FELL OVER THE SHOP AND FURTHER TALK OF APPROVAL 
COMPLETELY CEASED.

SEPTEMBER 19, 2001 
 
 ----------- 
1. SUMMARY: 
----------- 
 
THE LEAD STORY IN ALL PRO-GOVERNMENT MEDIA WAS 
PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S INTERVIEWS WITH CNN\'S LARRY KING 
AND THE BBC.  ALL PRO-GOVERNMENT HEADLINES EMPHASIZED 
MUBARAK\'S RENEWAL OF THE CALL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL 
CONFERENCE ON FIGHTING TERRORISM; HIS URGING THAT AN 
AMERICAN ATTACK ON ANY COUNTRY BECAUSE OF A SINGLE 
PERSON MEANS THE KILLING OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS; AND HIS 
STATEMENT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH PROMISED FURTHER EFFORTS 
TO SETTLE THE MIDDLE EAST ISSUE; THAT THE EGYPTIAN 
ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION IS CERTAINLY AFFILIATED WITH 
BIN LADEN. 
 
HOWEVER, THE BANNER IN OPPOSITION AL AHRAR READ, \"WE 
WILL NOT FIGHT WITH AMERICA,\" IN REFERENCE TO PRESIDENT 
MUBARAK\'S STATEMENT THAT EGYPTIAN TROOPS WILL NOT 
PARTICIPATE IN AN AMERICAN ATTACK IN AFGHANISTAN.  AL 
AHRAR\'S FRONT PAGE FURTHER PUBLISHED A STORY THAT 
PRESIDENT BUSH \"IS TRYING TO SAVE HIS FRAGILE ALLIANCE\" 
BY MEETING WITH WORLD LEADERS ON THE PLANS TO RESPOND 
TO THE ATTACKS IN THE U.S. 
 
PROMINENT REPORTS ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO THE 
ISLAMIC CENTER IN WASHINGTON APPEARED IN LEADING PRO- 
GOVERNMENT AL AHRAM AND AGGRESSIVE PRO-GOVERNMENT AL 
AKHBAR. 
 
-- ON ALL FRONT PAGES, PRESIDENT MUBARAK DISCUSSED THE 
AMERICAN SITUATION WITH JORDAN\'S KING ABDULLAH, SYRIAN 
PRESIDENT ASSAD AND OMAN SULTAN QABOOS. 
 
-- LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT AL AHRAM\'S FRONT PAGE 
PROMINENTLY REPORTED THAT THE UNSC DEMANDED THE TALIBAN 
SURRENDER BIN LADEN, WHILE THE U.S. FORMED \"A WAR 
GOVERNMENT\" WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH AND SECRETARY POWELL 
ARE CONDUCTING A DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN TO FORM AN 
INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE AGAINST TERRORISM. 
 
-- LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT AL AHRAM QUOTED SECRETARY 
POWELL\'S PRESS CONFERENCE SAYING THAT THE U.S. DOES NOT 
INTEND HARM TO THE AFGHANI PEOPLE, AND BIN LADEN HAS 
CELLS IN DOZENS OF COUNTRIES.  ALL PAPERS COVERED HIS 
STATEMENT TO AL JAZIRA TELEVISION RULING OUT ISRAEL\'S 
PARTICIPATION IN THE AMERICAN MILITARY RESPONSE AND 
THAT THE ARAB WORLD IS NOT A TARGET OF AMERICAN ACTION 
TO FIGHT TERRORISM. 
 
-- ALL FRONT PAGES REPORTED ON THE KILLING OF AN 
EGYPTIAN COPT IN LOS ANGELES AS A REACTION TO THE 
ATTACKS IN THE U.S.  COLUMNISTS CONTINUED TO CRITICIZE 
THE \"HATE CAMPAIGN\" AGAINST ARABS AND MOSLEMS 
WORLDWIDE. 
 
-- AN EDITORIALIST TACKLED THE ISSUE OF FREEDOM VERSUS 
SECURITY AFTER THE ATTACKS.  ANOTHER QUESTIONED WESTERN 
STANDARDS AND LIKENED THE U.S. CURRENT SITUATION TO 
HITLER\'S GERMANY AND STALIN\'S RUSSIA.  WHILE THE 
GENERAL EDITORIAL TREND IS TO CALL FOR THE EXERCISE OF 
WISDOM AND NOT TO FOLLOW THE PREJUDGMENT AGAINST BIN 
LADEN, ONE COLUMNIST ATTACKED THE TALIBAN FOR 
PROTECTING BIN LADEN. 
 
-- THE MIDDLE EAST SITUATION, WHILE STILL ON ALL FRONT 
PAGES, WAS EMPHASIZED IN PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S INTERVIEWS 
WITH CNN AND BBC.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------- 
2. QUOTE OF THE DAY 
------------------- 
 
\"THESE HAPHAZARD ACCUSATIONS THAT LACK FIRM EVIDENCE 
MAKE THE TRAGEDY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- WITH WHOM 
EVERYONE SYMPATHIZED -- A FARCE WITH WHICH NO ONE 
SYMPATHIZES.  IS THIS WESTERN DEMOCRACY?.. I REGRET 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA.\" LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT 
AHRAM\'S REGULAR COLUMNIST HAZEM ABDEL RAHMAN 
 
--------------- 
3. BLOCK QUOTES 
--------------- 
 
-- \"FREEDOM AND SECURITY\" LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT AL 
AHRAM\'S SENIOR MODERATE COLUMNIST AHMED BAHGAT (9/19): 
DICTATORSHIPS DEEPLY DIFFER FROM DEMOCRACIES.  UNLIKE 
THE CITIZEN IN THE TOTALITARIAN REGIMES, THE CITIZENS 
IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES ENJOY FREEDOM OF SPEECH, 
MOVEMENT AND ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE.  THE PERPETRATORS OF 
THE ATTACKS IN WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK EXPLOITED THESE 
PRIVILEGES.. [HOWEVER,] AMERICANS ARE FEELING THAT 
THEIR FREEDOM IS THREATENED BY FIRM SECURITY MEASURES.. 
AMERICAN ANALYSTS BECAME AWARE OF THIS CRISIS AND 
STRESSED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT LOSE THEIR FREEDOM FOR 
SECURITY REQUIREMENTS..  WILL AMERICA SUCCEED IN 
SOLVING THE EQUATION OF BALANCING FREEDOM WITH 
SECURITY?.. THE ADVANTAGE OF DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES IS 
THAT EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL WITHOUT FEELING 
SECURITY.  WILL THIS IMAGE CHANGE?\" 
 
-- \"READY MADE ACCUSATION\" LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT 
AHRAM\'S REGULAR COLUMNIST HAZEM ABDEL RAHMAN (9/19): 
\"THE U.S. WILL NOT LOSE ANYTHING BY HITTING BIN LADEN\'S 
BASES IN AFGHANISTAN.  IT DID IT IN 1998 AFTER THE 
EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN NAIROBI AND DAR ESSALAM.  THE 
PROBLEM IS THAT IT MAY FAIL AGAIN IN CAPTURING HIM.. ON 
THE OTHER HAND, WHO SAID THAT HE IS THE SOLE 
RESPONSIBLE PARTY IN THE NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON 
ATTACKS?  HOW CAN THE CIA AND FBI BE TRUSTED SO RAPIDLY 
AFTER PROVING THEIR UTTER FAILURE IN DETECTING THE 
ATTACK AND REVEALING THE PERPETRATORS?..  AMAZINGLY, 
THE U.S., A SOCIETY OF POLITICAL PLURALISM, HAS 
SUDDENLY BECOME SIMILAR TO A NAZI SOCIETY IN HITLER\'S 
TIME, OR A SOVIET SOCIETY IN STALIN\'S RULE: EVERYONE IS 
MOBILIZED BEHIND THE ONE TREND AND ONE OPINION TO 
RETALIATE AGAINST A SPECIFIC PERSON BEFORE THE 
INVESTIGATIONS EVEN START.  CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE NOW 
ACCUSED OF BEING TERRORISTS FOR THE MERE FACT THAT 
THEIR NAMES WERE ON THE TRAVEL LISTS BECAUSE THEY ARE 
ARABS OR MOSLEMS, OR POSSESSED BOOKS ON HOW TO FLY A 
PLANE OR HOW TO BE A MOSLEM.  WHERE IS THE SERIOUSNESS 
OF THE INVESTIGATIONS?  THESE HAPHAZARD ACCUSATIONS 
THAT LACK FIRM EVIDENCE MAKE THE TRAGEDY OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE -- WITH WHOM EVERYONE SYMPATHIZED -- A 
FARCE WITH WHICH NO ONE SYMPATHIZES.  IS THIS WESTERN 
DEMOCRACY?  DOES IT CHANGE, AT THE TIME OF DANGER, TO A 
BRAINWASH OPERATION AND AN OPEN FALSIFICATION OF THE 
PEOPLE\'S CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE MOST MODERN NATION?  WHO 
SAYS THAT ONLY ARAB MOSLEMS COMMIT SUICIDE?  WHERE ARE 
THE KAMIKAZE PILOTS OR THE BUDDHISTS MONKS?..  I REGRET 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA.\" 
 
-- \"HATE CAMPAIGNS\" LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT AL AHRAM\'S 
SENIOR INFLUENTIAL COLUMNIST SALAMA AHMED SALAMA 
(9/19): \"THE HATE CAMPAIGNS AND HARASSMENT OF ARABS AND 
MOSLEMS IN AMERICA AND ALL THE WESTERN COUNTRIES IS 
RISING DAY AFTER ANOTHER..  THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT BUSH 
VISITED THE ISLAMIC CENTER IN WASHINGTON..  OUR FEAR IS 
THAT THE STATEMENTS OF OFFICIALS IN AMERICA AND EUROPE 
BECOME USELESS WITH THE WESTERN MEDIA CONTINUAL 
MOBILIZATION OF FEELINGS AGAINST THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC 
TERRORISM AND THOSE SAVAGE ARABS WHO WANT TO CRUSH 
WESTERN CIVILIZATION..  THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THE 
USE OF ARAB DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS WORLDWIDE?  WHY DO THEY 
NOT ADOPT A COLLECTIVE PROTEST POSITION AGAINST THESE 
ATTACKS?  SILENCE WILL ONLY ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO 
CONTINUE THE MISTREATMENT.\" 
 
-- \"THE ISLAMOPHOBIA AND AMERICAN REVENGE\" LEADING PRO- 
GOVERNMENT AL AHRAM\'S COLUMNIST SALAH EDDIN HAFEZ 
(9/19): \"WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A TARGET OF ACCUSATIONS 
ACCORDING TO THE TRADITIONS OF SUPERPOWER. IT FIRST 
AVENGES ITS INJURED PRIDE, AND THEN THINKS ABOUT 
INVESTIGATING THE ATTACKS..  THE RAPID EFFORT TO FORM 
AN INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE OR CONFERENCE LED BY THE U.S. 
TO FIGHT TERRORISM IS THANKFUL.. HOWEVER, WHERE WERE 
THESE EFFORTS WHEN TERRORIST GROUPS KILLED AND BURNED 
LAND IN [EGYPT AND ARAB COUNTRIES]?  WHERE WERE THESE 
FEVERISH EFFORTS WHEN ISRAEL KILLS, BURNS AND DESTROYS 
DAILY?..  IT IS GOOD TO SPEAK WITH AMERICA AND EUROPE 
ABOUT PEACE, STABILITY, DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
FIGHTING TERRORISM.  HOWEVER, THIS MUST BE BASED ON 
UNIFIED STANDARDS AND BALANCED GUIDELINES.  WE SHOULD 
REMEMBER WHEN THE U.S. RUSHED AND PRESSURED EVERYONE TO 
HOLD AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FIGHTING TERRORISM 
IN SHARM EL SHEIKH, EGYPT, IN 1996, WHEN IT TURNED OUT 
TO BE AN AMERICAN ATTEMPT ONLY TO HELP ISRAEL\'S PERES 
WIN THE ELECTIONS.\" 
 
-- \"IF I WERE IN TALIBAN\'S SHOES\" LEADING PRO- 
GOVERNMENT AHRAM\'S COLUMNIST SALAH MONTASSER (9/19): 
\"WHEN BIN LADEN WENT TO AFGHANISTAN, HE RAISED THE 
BANNER OF `STRUGGLING AGAINST THE INFIDELS;\' A CALL 
THAT THE U.S. NOURISHED SO THAT IT WOULD BE USED 
AGAINST THE SOVIETS INSTEAD OF DIRECT AMERICAN 
INTERVENTION..  BIN LADEN WAS TEMPTED BY THE WEALTH HE 
INHERITED, THE STRENGTH THAT EMERGED IN TRAINING CAMPS 
AND INFLOW OF WEAPONS TO SERVE HIS OWN PURPOSE OF 
FORMING THE LARGEST TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.FROM WHICH 
EGYPT SUFFERED..  IN SUMMARY, BIN LADEN IS NOT THE 
INNOCENT NATIONALIST WHO DESERVES THE PROTECTION OF ANY 
COUNTRY.  IF I WERE IN TALIBAN\'S SHOES I WOULD QUESTION 
FIRST BIN LADEN\'S SELFISHNESS AND ASK HIM WHETHER HE 
ACCEPTS TO SURRENDER HIMSELF TO PROTECT AFGHANISTAN 
FROM THE IMPENDING DESTRUCTION OR NOT.\"

SUBJECT: SHARING THE CASE AGAINST AL-QA\'IDA WITH EGYPT 
 
REF: STATE 170698 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM RENO HARNISH. REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
-------------------------- 
MAKING THE CASE TO THE GOE 
-------------------------- 
 
1.  (S) ON OCTOBER 3 AND 4, DRAWING ON DOCUMENTS PROVIDED 
REFTEL, MISSION STAFF MET WITH EGYPTIAN FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
SECURITY, INTELLIGENCE, AND MILITARY OFFICIALS TO MAKE THE 
CASE AGAINST AL-QAIDA.  IN PREPARATION FOR THE BRIEFINGS, WE 
HAD DISTILLED INFORMATION IN REFTEL INTO FOUR BASIC SECTIONS: 
AL-QA\'IDA\'S INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE ATTACKS, TACTICAL 
SIMILARITY TO EARLIER ATTACKS, LINKS BETWEEN THE TALEBAN AND 
AL-QA\'IDA, AND U.S. ENGAGEMENT WITH THE TALEBAN AND 
AFGHANISTAN. 
 
2.  (S) DATT, OMC, ROAL CHIEFS BRIEFED DMI HEAD MG TOHAMY WHO 
REACTED VERY POSITIVELY, ASSERTING THAT HE \"UNDERSTOOD 
EXACTLY\" WHAT THE INTENT OF THE REPORT HAD BEEN, WISHED THAT 
OTHERS IN THE U.S. HAD \"LISTENED TO WHAT WE HAD TO SAY\" PRIOR 
TO THE ATTACKS, AND PROMISED TO INSURE THAT MINISTER OF 
DEFENSE TANTAWY WAS FULL AWARE OF THE TEXT PRIOR TO 
DISCUSSIONS WITH SECDEF RUMSFELD. 
 
-------------------- 
MAINTAIN CLOSE TOUCH 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (S) DCM DISCUSSED THE REPORT WITH PRESIDENCY OFFICIAL 
MAGID ABDEL FATTAH ABDEL AZIZ.  HE WELCOMED THE BRIEFING, 
TOOK EXTENSIVE NOTES, AND PROMPTLY BRIEFED PRESIDENT MUBARAK. 
 NEITHER OFFERED SUBSTANTIVE OBJECTIONS TO THE MATERIAL AND 
TOOK IT AT FACE VALUE.  ABDEL AZIZ DID NOTE THAT, WHILE 
LIMITED DEMONSTRATIONS ACROSS CAMPUSES IN EGYPT HAVE BEEN 
PROMPTED BY EVENTS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, WHEN THE U.S. 
REACTION OCCURRED, THERE WOULD BE SOME FACTIONS WHICH WOULD 
TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO EXPAND THEM.  THE GOE, HE SAID, 
WOULD LIKE AN HOUR OR TWO NOTICE BEFORE THE STRIKE AS IT 
WOULD THEN TAKE EXTRA INTERNAL SECURITY PRECAUTIONS. ABDEL 
AZIZ SAID THAT PRESIDENT MUBARAK MIGHT RAISE THIS WITH 
VISITING SECDEF OCTOBER 4.  HE URGED THAT THE U.S. MAINTAIN 
CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE GOE ON THE SCOPE OF THE MILITARY 
REACTION SO AS TO PRECLUDE HEZBALLAH/SYRIA FROM STOKING AND 
DISSEMINATING CONSPIRACY THEORIES AS TO WHERE THE U.S. WAS 
HEADING.  IN ADDITION, HE SAID THAT PRESIDENT MUBARAK WAS 
UNDER THE CLEAR IMPRESSION THAT THE U.S. HAD GIVEN ORAL 
ASSURANCES TO OMAR SOLEIMAN THAT THE U.S. WOULD NOT HIT 
SYRIA, LIBYA, OR LEBANON.  CONCLUDING, FATTAH REITERATED 
MUBARAK\'S VIEW THAT FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH WOULD NOT BRING 
ANYTHING USEFUL TO THE PROCESS AND THAT PRESIDENT BUSH\'S 
STATEMENT ON PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD HAD BEEN GREATLY 
APPRECIATED. 
 
--------------------- 
IT WON\'T HAPPEN HERE 
--------------------- 
 
4.  (S) THE AMBASSADOR MET OCTOBER 4 WITH SALAH SALAMA, 
DIRECTOR OF STATE SECURITY INVESTIGATION SECTOR (INTERIOR 
MINISTRY).  SALAMA PREDICTED THERE WOULD BE DEMONSTRATIONS IN 
THE EVENT OF A STRIKE ON AFGHANISTAN, BUT MAINTAINED THAT THE 
GREATER POTENTIAL FOR SUCH ACTIONS WOULD RESULT FROM 
CONTINUING VIOLENCE UNDERTAKEN BY ISRAELIS AGAINST 
PALESTINIANS.  HE ASSERTED THAT THERE WAS ALSO POLITICAL 
AGITATION IN UNIONS AND SYNDICATES BUT THIS TOO RESULTED FROM 
ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE. SALAMA PRAISED THE PRESIDENT\'S

FACES MILITARY TRIBUNAL 
 
CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC/POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR GENE A. 
CRETZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF TRIAL BEFORE THE MILITARY 
TRIBUNAL, THE PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN ORGANIZATION OF 94 EGYPTIANS 
AND FOREIGNERS, WHICH HAS BECOME KNOWN AS \"AL-WA\'AD\" (THE 
PROMISE), IS ALLEGED TO BE A SOPHISTICATED NETWORK OF 
TERRORIST CELLS.  INDICTMENTS WERE ISSUED AGAINST 94 
DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING 7 FUGITIVES, ACCUSED OF FORMING A 
CLANDESTINE ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION WITH THE PURPOSE OF IMPEDING 
THE CONSTITUTION AND EGYPTIAN LAW, INFRINGING ON PERSONAL 
FREEDOM AND PUBLIC RIGHTS AND DAMAGING NATIONAL UNITY AND 
SOCIAL PEACE.  A NUMBER OF MEMBERS WERE ALLEGEDLY PLANNING TO 
COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS, INCLUDING ASSASSINATION OF PUBLIC AND 
GOVERNMENT FIGURES.  THEY COLLECTED FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT 
CLAIMS, UPWARDS OF $1,000,000 IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  WHILE 
THE GROUP CLAIMS IT WAS NOT PLANNING INTERNAL OPERATIONS IN 
EGYPT, IT ADMITTED SUPPORTING PALESTINIAN AND CHECHEN 
FIGHTERS.  AL-WA\'AD IS SAID TO BE HEADED BY TWO RELIGIOUS 
FIGURES AND A COMPUTER ENGINEER.  ACCORDING TO THE 
PROSECUTION, ITS GOAL WAS TO UNDERMINE THE STATE AND TO 
ASSASSINATE POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR FIGURES, 
INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUBARAK AND THE SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR.  IN 
REALITY, LITTLE HAS COME TO LIGHT ABOUT THE TRUE ASPIRATIONS 
OF THE GROUP, WHICH ADMITTEDLY COLLECTED LARGE SUMS OF MONEY, 
WHICH IT CLAIMS WAS BEING SENT TO CHECHEN REBELS AND 
PALESTINIANS (HAMMAS).  THE TRIAL CONTINUES AT A RAPID PACE 
AS WE APPROACH THE LONG EID AL-FITR HOLIDAY BUT IS NOT LIKELY 
TO CONCLUDE FOR ANOTHER FEW WEEKS.  END SUMMARY 
 
----------------------------------------- 
REINVIGORATING THE MILITARY COURTS SYSTEM 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2 YEARS, CIVILIAN DEFENDANTS 
WERE REFERRED TO EGYPT\'S MILITARY COURTS SYSTEM FOR TRIAL. 
THE TRIAL OF THE FIRST OF THREE CIVILIAN GROUPS IN THE 
MILITARY TRIBUNAL AT HUCKSTEP, OUTSIDE CAIRO, BEGAN ON 
NOVEMBER 18.  SOME OF THE DEFENDANTS STAND ACCUSED OF 
TERRORIST-RELATED CRIMES.  INDICTMENTS WERE ISSUED AGAINST 94 
DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING 7 FUGITIVES, ACCUSED OF FORMING A 
CLANDESTINE ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION WITH THE PURPOSE OF IMPEDING 
THE CONSTITUTION AND EGYPTIAN LAW, INFRINGING ON PERSONAL 
FREEDOM AND PUBLIC RIGHTS AND DAMAGING NATIONAL UNITY AND 
SOCIAL PEACE.  A NUMBER OF MEMBERS WERE ALLEGEDLY PLANNING TO 
COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS, INCLUDING ASSASSINATION OF PUBLIC AND 
GOVERNMENT FIGURES, MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS, EGYPTIANS AND 
AMERICANS.  THEY COLLECTED FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS, 
UPWARDS OF $1,000,000 IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, TO SUPPORT THE 
PALESTINIAN INTIFADA AND CHECHEN REBELS.  WHILE AL-WA\'AD 
CLAIMS IT WAS NOT PLANNING INTERNAL OPERATIONS IN EGYPT, IT 
ADMITTED SUPPORTING PALESTINIAN AND CHECHEN FIGHTERS. 
 
------------------------------- 
LEADERS AND MEMBERS OF AL-WA\'AD 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) FORMED IN 1996, AL-WA\'AD\'S OPERATIONS WERE 
CLANDESTINE, ACCORDING TO THE PROSECUTION.  THE 
INVESTIGATION, ONGOING SINCE MAY 2001, REVEALED A NETWORK 
HEADED BY TWO POPULAR PRAYER LEADERS, SHEIKH FAWZY AL-SAYEED, 
57, FROM AL-TAWHEED MOSQUE IN DOWNTOWN CAIRO AND NASHAT 
IBRAHIM, 46, THE ORATOR OF THE KABUL MOSQUE IN THE SUBURB OF 
NASR CITY.  (NOTE: NASHAT WAS ARRESTED IN 1981, IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE SADAT ASSASSINATION, SPENT A YEAR IN PRISON, AFTER 
WHICH HE TRAVELED TO SAUDI ARABIA BEFORE RETURNING TO FOUND 
AL- WA\'AD.)  WHILE NASHAT CLAIMED THAT AL-WA\'AD WAS OPPOSED 
TO TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE, THE PROSECUTION ALLEGED THEY WERE 
PLANNING INTERNAL SUBVERSION AND VIOLENCE.  IN ADDITION TO 
THE FORMAL CHARGES, AL-SAYEED HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF ISSUING A 
FATWA (RELIGIOUS OPINION) CLAIMING THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT IS 
AN INFIDEL WHO DOES NOT IMPLEMENT SHARIA (ISLAMIC LAW) 
RULINGS. 
 
4.  (C) AL-WA\'AD MEMBERS INCLUDED EGYPTIANS AND FOREIGNERS, 
AMONG THEM DUAL NATIONALS FROM THE U.S. (MUHAMMAD HISHAM SAYF 
AL-DIN YOUSSEF) , HOLLAND (HISHAM MAHMOUD DIYAB), AUSTRIA 
(MUHAMMAD RABBAH SALIM) AND GERMANY (MUHAMMAD HASAN 
AL-WARDANI).  A PRINCIPAL DEFENDANT AND ALLEGED LEADER OF THE 
AL-WA\'AD ORGANIZATION, MAGDI IDRIS, 33 YEARS OLD, IS A 
COMPUTER ENGINEER WHO OWNS A SPORTS GYM, ALLEGEDLY A SITE FOR 
TRAINING MILITANTS.  HE REPORTEDLY RECRUITED MEMBERS ABROAD 
TO CONDUCT MILITARY AND EXPLOSIVES TRAINING IN EGYPT.  AN 
AL-WA\'AD MEMBER, A DAGESTANI BOMB EXPERT, WAS FOUND IN 
POSSESSION OF NUMEROUS EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.  TWELVE EGYPTIAN 
SUSPECTS WERE CHARGED WITH RECEIVING MILITARY TRAINING 
OUTSIDE EGYPT, WITHOUT GOVERNMENT PERMISSION.  TWO OR THREE 
SEVERAL DEFENDANTS, ACCORDING TO STATE SECURITY PROSECUTION, 
WERE TRAINED IN AFGHANISTAN.  OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDED 
BUSINESSMEN, COMPUTER EXPERTS AND PILOTS.  THE GOVERNMENT 
CLAIMS THAT THE GROUP ADVOCATED A VIOLENT IDEOLOGY, SIMILAR 
TO EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, INTENDING TO ATTACK PRESIDENT 
MUBARAK, GOVERNMENT AND AMERICAN OFFICIALS, POPULAR SECULAR 
FIGURES AND THE MODERATE SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR.  NASSERITE 
WEEKLY AL-ARABY REPORTED (11/1/01) THAT ACCORDING TO SHEIKH 
FAWZY AL-SAYEED, THE NAMES OF SIX INITIAL DEFENDANTS, SONS OF 
FORMER AND PRESENT SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, WERE DROPPED 
FROM THE FORMAL INDICTMENT. 
 
---------------------------------- 
OPENING SESSION: THE PLOT REVEALED 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  AT THE OPENING SESSION (11/18), THE COURT HEARD 
REQUESTS FROM DEFENSE ATTORNEYS, WHO FAILED TO FORM A DEFENSE 
PANEL, LED BY ONE LAWYER.  MANY ATTORNEYS FOR THE DEFENSE 
STRESSED THAT THEY WANTED TO PROCEED INDEPENDENTLY TO DEFEND 
ONLY THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENTS.  AT THE NEXT HEARING ON 
NOVEMBER 21, THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED WEAPONS, INCLUDING A 
BASEBALL BAT AND AIR RIFLE, WHICH WERE RULED INADMISSIBLE BY 
THE JUDGES.  THE PROSECUTION SAID THAT MAJOR OPERATIONS WERE 
TO INCLUDE ATTACKING MOTORCADES OF SENIOR OFFICIALS; ATTACKS 
AGAINST THE SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR, THE RADIO AND TV BUILDING, AN 
UNDISCLOSED LOCATION HOUSING AMERICAN PILOTS AND ATTACKS 
AGAINST BOTH MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN PERSONALITIES.  THE 
PROSECUTOR CHARGED THAT AL-WA\'AD RECENTLY COLLECTED $600,000, 
WHICH WAS SENT TO A JORDANIAN RESIDENT IN THE UAE (MOHAMED 
ALI, AKA ABU-HAMZAH), WHO RUNS THE AL-HARAMAYN CHARITY 
FOUNDATION IN SAUDI ARABIA.  THROUGH THE UAE CONNECTIONS, 
THEY FUNNELED MONEY TO THE CHECHEN RESISTANCE, ACCORDING TO 
THE PROSECUTION.  AL-WA\'AD SOUGHT TO INDOCTRINATE YOUNG 
EGYPTIANS, TO RECRUIT THEM TO FIGHT IN CHECHENYA AND THE 
BALKANS.  ONCE THEY DEVELOPED EXPERTISE, THE GOVERNMENT 
CLAIMS, THEY WOULD RETURN TO EGYPT TO CARRY OUT TERRORIST 
OPERATIONS.  AL-AHRAM AL-ARABY NEWSPAPER CLAIMED THE GROUP 
HAD CLOSE RELATIONS WITH HAMMAS AND ON 12/2 REPORTED A 
MEETING BETWEEN A HAMMAS OFFICIAL AND DEFENDANT NASHAT AT 
WHICH HE RECEIVED A LIST OF REQUESTED MATERIEL, INCLUDING 
MACHINE GUNS AND ANTI-TANK ARTILLERY. 
 
----------------- 
THE PLOT THICKENS 
----------------- 
 
6.  (C) AS THE GOVERNMENT BUILT ITS CASE AGAINST AL-WA\'AD 
MEMBERS, IT REVEALED THAT THE ORGANIZATION WAS DIVIDED INTO 
CLUSTER CELLS.  MEMBERS CAME FROM THE ELITES AND EDUCATED 
CLASSES. FUNDS WERE COLLECTED FROM WORSHIPPERS AT TWO LARGE 
MOSQUES AS WELL AS DONATIONS FROM BUSINESSMEN THEY RECRUITED. 
 NASHAT IBRAHIM REPORTEDLY PAID EXPENSES FOR MEMBERS TO 
RECEIVE TRAINING AT CHECHEN RESISTANCE CAMPS, IN KASHMIR AND 
AFGHANISTAN.  A DAGASTANI EXPLOSIVES EXPERT, REGISTERED IN 
THE MEDICAL FACULTY AT AL-AZHAR TRAINED MEMBERS IN CAIRO AND 
ALEXANDRIA TO PLANT CAR BOMBS AND OTHER DEVICES.  TWO 
DEFENDANTS ALLEGEDLY CONFESSED TO BELONGING TO THE GAMA\'AT 
ISLAMIYYA SINCE THE MID-1990\'S.  THREE OF THE DEFENDANTS 
ALLEGEDLY RECEIVED CIVIL AVIATION TRAINING IN THE U.S.: 
MUHAMMAD HISHAM SAYF AL-DIN, HUSAM ZAKARIYA ABDUL SALAM, AND 
MUHAMMAD MAHMUD NUR-AL-DIN. 
 
7.  (C) IN ITS THIRD SESSION ON DECEMBER 3, AT WHICH THE 
MILITARY TRIBUNAL HEARD TESTIMONY FROM THE INVESTIGATING 
OFFICER, WHO SAID THE GROUP HAD BEEN STUDYING THE MOVEMENT OF 
THE PRESIDENT\'S MOTORCADE, PREPARING TO BLOW IT UP.  DEFENSE 
ATTORNEYS REQUESTED THE PRESENCE OF THE MUFTI OF THE 
REPUBLIC, PRESIDENT OF AL-AZHAR UNIVERSITY, AND DEAN OF THE 
RELIGION FACULTY AS WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENSE.  DEFENSE 
ATTORNEYS CLAIMED THE COPY OF THE CASE WAS ILLEGIBLE AND 
REQUESTED THE HEARING BE HALTED UNTIL A CLEAR COPY COULD BE 
OBTAINED.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT DECIDED TO GIVE LAWYERS 
ACCESS TO THE ORIGINAL OF THE CASE DOCUMENTS WHILE CONTINUING 
THE CASE.  THE ATTORNEY FOR EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN MUHAMMAD HISHAM 
SAYF AL-DIN REQUESTED A MEDICAL EXAMINATION FOR EVIDENCE OF 
TORTURE.  OTHERS ASKED TO BE HOSPITALIZED FOR DETERIORATING 
HEALTH CONDITIONS.  THE COURT ACCEPTED THE DEFENSE APPEALS 
AND AGREED TO REQUEST AN AL-AZHAR COMMITTEE EXAMINE BOOKS 
FOUND IN THE POSSESSION OF THE ACCUSED TO JUDGE THEIR 
CONFORMITY WITH ISLAMIC LEGISLATION. 
 
8.  (C) CROSS EXAMINATION OF PROSECUTION WITNESSES BY DEFENSE 
ATTORNEYS TOOK UP THE NEXT TWO (DECEMBER 4 AND 6) SESSIONS. 
DURING THESE SESSIONS A LINK BETWEEN JORDANIAN ABU HAMZA AND 
DEFENDANT MAGDI IDRIS BECAME CLEAR.  THE FORMER SERVED AS THE 
LINK BETWEEN AL-WA\'AD CELLS AND TRAINING CAMPS ABROAD, MAKING 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEIR MOVEMENTS.  DEFENSE ATTORNEYS CHARGED 
THAT THEIR DEFENDANTS WERE TORTURED AND THEIR CONFESSIONS, 
MADE UNDER DURESS, WERE INVALID.  ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT 
DAILY, AL-AHRAM (12/6) THE PROSECUTION INTRODUCED ONLY 21 
PIECES OF EVIDENCE, SPECIFICALLY RELIGIOUS BOOKS AND DRAWINGS 
FOR TARGET PRACTICE, WHILE THE INDICTMENT INDICATES 150 
PIECES OF EVIDENCE, INCLUDING WEAPONS. 
 
---------------------- 
SKEPTICS VIEW THE CASE 
---------------------- 
 
9.  (C) THE REFERRAL OF THIS CASE TO A MILITARY TRIBUNAL HAS 
RAISED SUSPICIONS AND SOME CONCERNS IN EGYPT.  THE ABSENCE OF 
CONCRETE EVIDENCE AND CREDIBLE WEAPONS FURTHER WEAKENS THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S CASE AND HEIGHTENS SUSPICIONS AS TO WHETHER THIS 
IS A SHOW TRIAL.  SOME BELIEVE THAT INTRODUCING THE CASE IN 
THE MILITARY TRIBUNAL WAS A POST-9/11 DEMONSTRATION OF 
EGYPT\'S CONCRETE RESOLVE TO DEAL WITH TERRORISM.  DEFENSE 
ATTORNEY HAFEZ ABU SAADA CLAIMED THAT THE CASE WOULD HAVE 
ENDED IN ACQUITTAL IN AN ORDINARY COURT OF LAW.  THIS, HE 
SAID, IS LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN A MILITARY PROCEEDING, 
WHERE THE JUDGES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GOVERNMENT PRESSURE. 
 
10. (C) PROMINENT ARAB JOURNALIST MOHAMED SALAH BELIEVES THAT 
THE MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP DID INDEED VIOLATE THE LAW IN 
SOLICITING AND ACCEPTING DONATIONS WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM 
THE GOE, IN VIOLATION OF THE 1992 MILITARY ORDER TO THAT 
EFFECT.  WHAT PROVIDED THIS GROUP A RADICAL ISLAMIC TINT WAS 
THE FACT THAT SOME OF THOSE INVOLVED HAD BEEN MEMBERS OF 
RADICAL ISLAMIST GROUPS IN THE PAST. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  (C) WHILE WE AGREE THAT THE EVIDENCE IS SCANT AND THE 
MAKINGS OF A PUTSCH UNLIKELY SO FAR, THE GOVERNMENT IN OUR 
VIEW, WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROUP\'S POTENTIAL.  THEY 
WERE ALREADY BREAKING THE LAW BY COLLECTING AND SENDING LARGE 
AMOUNTS OF CASH AND PROCURING WEAPONS TO BE SENT TO CHECHNYA 
AND PALESTINIAN HAMMAS BOTH OF WHICH ARE EMOTIONAL AS WELL AS 
POLITICAL CONCERNS FOR MANY ARAB MUSLIMS.  THE ABSENCE OF 
EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE MAY DEMONSTRATE THE DIFFICULTY OF 
TRACING FUNDS, PARTICULARLY CASH CONTRIBUTIONS, IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL ARENA.  WHILE WE SEE NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS 
GROUP AND AL-QAEDA, WE CANNOT RULE OUT THAT IT WAS AN 
OFFSHOOT OF ANOTHER INTERNATIONAL GROUP.  CERTAINLY, LOCAL 
TERRORIST ELEMENTS, OR CELLS, RECEIVING MILITARY AND 
EXPLOSIVES TRAINING ABROAD, COULD USE THAT EXPERTISE 
INTERNALLY, AS THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS.  PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S 
EFFORTS OVER THE PAST YEAR TO TURN THE FOCUS BACK TO PEACE AT 
THE SAME TIME THE ISRAELIS ARE PERCEIVED AS BEING AT WAR WITH 
THE PALESTINIANS, HAVE NOT MADE HIM MORE POPULAR.  THAT IS 
PARTICULARLY TRUE AMONG THOSE WHO FEEL A NEED TO HELP DEFEND 
MUSLIMS AGAINST OCCUPATION FORCES, WHICH THEY VIEW AS 
\"LEGITIMATE JIHAD\".

Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Gordon Gray for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 1. (C) In a November 13 meeting at the Foreign Ministry, NEA 
Assistant Secretary Bill Burns and Egyptian Foreign Minister 
Ahmed Aboul Gheit recalled events surrounding Yasser Arafat\'s 
funeral the previous day and discussed the upcoming Iraq 
conference in Sharm El Sheikh. Aboul Gheit noted his desire 
to make the conference one of interaction and many bilateral 
discussions rather than focusing on formal group meetings. A 
primary goal was to \"enable dialogue.\" He said the communique 
\"went a little beyond UNSC 1546,\" which in his view was 
appropriate to draw attention to the roles of regional players, 
including the Arab League. He cautioned against the negative 
optic of Americans fighting in Falluja during the conference. 
He suggested an informal encounter between the U.S. and Iranian 
foreign ministers in Sharm El Sheikh. 
 
2. (C) Aboul Gheit stressed the need for Israel to help 
facilitate Palestinian elections logistically. Noting his plans 
to visit Ramallah on November 24, he was concerned that Israel 
would seek other reasons for not engaging now that Yasser 
Arafat was out of the picture. The Minister also cited the need 
for GOI \"gestures\" like prisoner releases to give Palestinian 
leaders credibility. Aboul Gheit said Syria was showing 
appropriate restraint. On Sudan, Aboul Gheit reiterated his 
desire to speak at the November 18 UNSC session to be held in 
Nairobi. He discussed the best timing for a trip to the U.S. in 
the spring. This message concludes with a few bio notes on Aboul 
Gheit, who has now been in office for 120 days. 
End summary. 
 
-------------- 
Arafat funeral 
-------------- 
3. (C) Aboul Gheit recalled the funeral services for Yasser 
Arafat the previous day, noting the \"scary\" experience of landing 
in Ramallah for the burial. The crowd did not concern him so much 
as the tight landing area, which he said had the pilot somewhat 
worried about a safe touchdown. Describing his ginger exit from 
the helicopter and 45-minute journey to a nearby building in the 
thick crowd, he commended the PA for going to their \"fall back\" 
position of a direct burial (without the anticipated viewing in a 
building full of dignitaries). He said Abu Mazen calmly received 
word that \"it\'s done\" when many were still anticipating a formal 
viewing. In sum, the funeral was \"an experience.\" 
 
---------------- 
Sharm conference 
---------------- 
4. (C) The Minister described his intention to make the November 
22-23 Sharm El Sheikh conference an opportunity for interaction 
between delegations. Events, including a dinner and a lunch, would 
be available to all delegation heads, yet no one would be obligated 
to join any set event. The design is intended to \"enable dialogue\" 
by offering \"just the setting.\" 
 
5. (C) As for a basic agenda, he cited a two-hour meeting of Iraq\'s 
neighbors plus the UN on November 22, followed by a dinner to which 
all foreign ministers were welcome. (A/S Burns also suggested a 
bilateral with Secretary Powell on November 22 if schedules 
permitted.) Breakfast on November 23 would be at leisure and 
bilateral meetings were encouraged. A 10:00 a.m. meeting would be 
an opportunity for delegations to give statements if they chose -- 
four minutes or so for each delegation who desired. Aboul Gheit said 
he would clarify at the outset, however, that not all delegations 
were obligated to speak. \"We will not insist on hearing from 
everyone.\" After a luncheon on November 23, Aboul Gheit hoped the 
afternoon could be designed to \"encourage interaction\" between the 
various delegations rather than formal group meetings. Aboul Gheit 
said he would offer a statement to the press and take questions 
during the afternoon as well. 
 
6. (C) Aboul Gheit said the communique \"went a little beyond UNSC 
1546,\" which in his view was appropriate since regional powers and 
regional organizations were meeting to engage more deeply on Iraq. 
A strong reference to the role of the Arab League, for example, 
could encourage Secretary General Amre Moussa (\"oblige him\") to act 
within an agreed framework. 
 
---- 
Iraq 
---- 
7. (C) Not wanting to \"jump to conclusions\" about how events in 
Falluja might turn out, Aboul Gheit said the issue was not \"taking 
over the city\" but preventing violence and terror from spreading to 
other cities. He said \"Mosul today reflects Falluja six months ago.\" 
A/S Burns noted that Mosul was looking better then a few days prior, 
and that planning for Falluja involved extensive and immediate 
economic recovery assistance. The \"day after\" plans would help bring 
law and order to Falluja and would make life more hopeful for its 
residents -- including efforts at job creation. Similar programs in 
Najaf and Sadr City had emphasized hope and inclusion in rebuilding 
efforts, said A/S Burns; the upcoming conference in Egypt should 
stress a similar commitment to international engagement. Aboul Gheit 
said \"your problem is not that the U.S. military fought well, but 
that they are on TV\" too often. Iraqi forces should be in the 
limelight, he stressed. 
 
8. (C) Expressing his hope that the U.S. role would not leave \"a 
bitter impression in the Sunni world,\" Aboul Gheit cited media scenes 
 of U.S. forces running through mosques while firing their weapons; 
\"these are scenes one must be careful with.\" A better impression would 
result if \"Mahmoud and Mohammed\" were searching the mosque, not \"John 
and Jack.\" 
 
--------- 
Palestine 
--------- 
9. (C) A/S Burns noted that Secretary Powell was considering a trip to 
Jerusalem around the time of the Sharm El Sheikh conference. A key topic 
would be practical support for Palestinian elections, including pressing 
Israel to cooperate. Aboul Gheit said he also planned to visit (likely 
Ramallah) on November 24. He lamented that President Bush and British 
Prime Minister Blair had \"put everything on the Palestinians\" instead of 
citing Israel\'s need to help facilitate meaningful elections. He asked 
how a people could elect a leader without having freedom of movement 
within their own cities. Aboul Gheit feared that the GOI might find 
further pretexts to avoid engagement with the Palestinians, 
continuing their \"no partner\" mantra with a new formula. Burns noted that 
meaningful Palestinian elections were \"deeply in Israel\'s interest\" and 
an opportunity to help stabilize the region if properly handled. 
 
10. (C) Aboul Gheit floated the idea of the U.S., Egypt, Israel, and the 
Palestinians getting together to \"launch a process\" toward reconciliation. 
A/S Burns said the idea may be premature, but was nonetheless worth 
keeping in mind. He said it was important to \"make sure there is a 
practical commitment\" on all sides first. Aboul Gheit\'s goal was to 
\"implicate Israel in a process.\" The Minister and his staff also cited 
the need for GOI \"gestures\" like prisoner releases, in addition to 
logistical support, to make elections (and newly-elected leaders) a 
success. The lack of such gestures from Israel undercut Abu Mazen\'s 
authority as Prime Minister, they opined. Failure to capitalize on current 
opportunities to reopen negotiations could doom the conflict to continue 
into the next century, concluded Aboul Gheit. He said Intelligence Chief 
Omar Soliman would also be gathering Palestinian factions for cease fire 
talks in Cairo once again, but did not elaborate. 
 
11. (C) A/S Burns said the PA needed to demonstrate that it could govern 
responsibly, and deliver things for Palestinians. He had told Syrian 
President Asad (in a brief conversation at the Arafat funeral) that it was 
important for all parties to use their influence to keep things calm. Aboul 
Gheit said Syria had manifested that desire for some time and was showing 
restraint. The Syrian Foreign Minister had reaffirmed the same in Cairo 
the previous week, he asserted. 
 
---- 
Iran 
---- 
12. (C) Asking how the USG might interface with the Iranians in Sharm El 
Sheikh, Aboul Gheit recommended that Secretary Powell approach the Iranian 
Foreign Minister in a \"small group\" and break off for a few seconds of 
private discussion. After mingling, a simple \"Kamal, let\'s have a talk\" 
might lead the way to a formal bilateral, said Aboul Gheit, who was certain 
that the Iranians would not make the first move. 
 
----- 
Sudan 
----- 
13. (C) A/S Burns expressed appreciation for Aboul Gheit\'s interest in 
addressing a UNSC meeting to be held in Nairobi November 18 and 19. Aboul 
Gheit said he wanted to deliver a statement early on November 18 (because 
he needed to return to Cairo) and asked for assistance in getting his name 
on the speakers list for a brief presentation. 
 
---------------- 
Bilateral Agenda 
---------------- 
14. (C) After a brief listing of pending bilateral issues, Aboul Gheit 
asked when might be the best time for him to visit the U.S. He agreed that 
an early February visit, when the Congress was back in session and a likely 
Mubarak visit was a month or two in the future, might be most appropriate to 
\"bring to bear a certain impression\" of the relationship. He also floated 
the idea of another visit after a Mubarak trip. A/S Burns encouraged Egypt 
to send other ministers in the meantime to keep the issues and personalities 
clear in the minds of USG interlocutors. 
 
15. (C) Referring to Armed Forces Chief of Staff Weheba\'s early December 
visit to Washington, Aboul Gheit said the Lantos amendment (to reassign 
portions of military aid to economic assistance) \"will be defeated, I assure 
you.\" 
 
--------- 
Bio notes 
--------- 
16. (C) About Gheit volunteered during the meeting that he was \"a grandfather 
for the second time.\" His daughter, Lara, had delivered a daughter, Tamara, the 
previous day while he was involved in Arafat\'s funeral. He also reinforced his 
protocol-conscious approach to diplomacy in describing an invitation from U.S. 
PermRep to the UN Danforth which he regretted because the invitation was not 
personalized. When the invitation was reissued with his name properly 
personalized, he was ready to accept the invitation; in the interim, however, 
he was called back to Cairo to begin his tenure as Foreign Minister. 
 
17. (C) Citing his 120 days on the job as very busy for him and for his staff 
(a comment confirmed in the fatigued faces around the room), Aboul Gheit said 
he looked forward to putting his feet up and enjoying a beer at his farm the 
following day (the beginning of the post-Ramadan feast). His staff later noted 
that having the minister away from the office offered some reprieve from a 
hectic pace, but that he would no doubt keep them busy from a distance during 
the next few days of holiday.
