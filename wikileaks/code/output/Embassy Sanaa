REF: STATE 220986 
 
(U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR BARBARA K. BODINE, REASON 1.5 
(B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IN A MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER BA 
JAMMAL NOVEMBER 20, THE AMBASSADOR CONVEYED U.S. CONCERNS 
THAT PRESIDENT SALEH\'S RECENT PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE 
EXACERBATING AN ALREADY DIFFICULT SITUATION.  AT SUCH A TENSE 
TIME, THE ROYG SHOULD BE PUBLICLY URGING BOTH SIDES TO RETURN 
TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, NOT FANNING THE FLAMES OF PAN-ARAB 
ANGER.  THE PRESIDENT\'S EXCESSIVE COMMENTS WILL ONLY 
STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF REJECTIONISTS ON BOTH SIDES.  BA 
JAMMAL EXPLAINED THAT SALEH\'S RHETORICAL EXTRAVAGANCE WAS 
NECESSARY TO SATISFY PRO-PALESTINIAN YEMENI PUBLIC OPINION 
AND FILL A VACUUM THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE FILLED BY THE 
OPPOSITION.  HE STRESSED THAT THE ROYG\'S SUPPORTIVE POLICY 
FOR THE MEPP HAD NOT AND WOULD NOT CHANGE.  AMBASSADOR 
CONTINUED THAT THE GAP BETWEEN YEMENI POLICY AND PRESIDENTIAL 
RHETORIC WAS GROWING TOO WIDE TO BE SUSTAINABLE AS SIMPLY FOR 
DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION.  IT WAS NOT IN THE REGION\'S, THE 
PALESTINIANS\' OR YEMEN\'S BEST INTEREST THAT THIS CONTINUE. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------ 
U.S. RESERVATIONS ON RECENT RHETORIC 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C)  DURING HER NOVEMBER 20 MEETING WITH DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER/FOREIGN MINISTER ABDUL QADIR BA JAMMAL (OTHER TOPICS 
SEPTEL), AMBASSADOR, PER REFTEL, RAISED GROWING U.S. CONCERNS 
OVER THE INCREASINGLY SHARP TONE OF PRESIDENT SALEH\'S PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS ON REGIONAL ISSUES IN GENERAL AND THE MIDDLE EAST 
PEACE PROCESS IN PARTICULAR.  THE PRESIDENT\'S RECENT COMMENTS 
ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF JIHAD, HIS ASSERTION THAT ARMED 
RESISTANCE WAS THE ONLY VIABLE PALESTINIAN OPTION AND HIS 
PUBLIC EXPRESSION OF REGRET -- REPEATED ON AT LEAST TWO 
OCCASIONS -- THAT YEMEN DID NOT BORDER ISRAEL AND THEREFORE 
COULD NOT PROVIDE ARMS FOR THE INTIFADA, WERE 
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO STOP THE 
VIOLENCE IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  THEY ALSO APPEARED TO 
CONTRADICT OFFICIAL ROYG POLICY OF SUPPORT FOR THE MEPP. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
BA JAMMAL:  IT\'S RHETORIC, NOT SUBSTANCE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  BA JAMMAL DOWNPLAYED THE SERIOUSNESS OF SALEH\'S 
REMARKS, ESPECIALLY THOSE EXPRESSING REGRET AT YEMEN\'S NOT 
BEING A BORDERLINE STATE, ADDING THAT HE HAD QUICKLY 
CLARIFIED THE LATTER IN SUBSEQUENT PRESS INTERVIEWS, DENYING 
THAT YEMEN WAS CALLING FOR WAR AND RESTATING THAT THE 
PEACEFUL RECOGNITION OF REGIONAL CONFLICTS REMAINED A 
FUNDAMENTAL PRECEPT OF YEMENI FOREIGN POLICY.  HE EXPLAINED 
THE PRESIDENT\'S RHETORICAL EXTRAVAGANCE AS AN UNAVOIDABLE 
POLITICAL REALITY:  AS AN ARAB LEADER, SALEH IS OBLIGED TO 
ENTHUSIASTICALLY EMBRACE PAN-ARAB SOLIDARITY DURING PERIODS 
OF PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI CONFRONTATION.  ALSO, THE YEMENI 
PUBLIC IS OUTRAGED OVER WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS ISRAEL\'S USE OF 
EXCESSIVE FORCE AGAINST PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS; TO APPEAR SOFT 
ON ISRAEL WOULD OPEN THE GOVERNMENT TO ATTACKS FROM THE 
DOMESTIC OPPOSITION. 
 
--------------------------------- 
THE AMBASSADOR:  RHETORIC MATTERS 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR CHARACTERIZED SALEH\'S RECENT PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS AS FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE AND INTOLERANT THAN THEY 
HAD EVER BEEN AND WELL BEYOND THOSE EMANATING FROM MOST OTHER 
ARAB CAPITALS.  IN FACT, BA JAMMAL HAD HIMSELF EARLIER 
DISPARAGED IRAQ\'S CALLING FOR A JIHAD AND A WAR OF AGGRESSION 
AGAINST ISRAEL.  REGRETTABLY, PRESIDENT SALEH\'S PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS WERE PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO BAGHDAD\'S. THIS HAD BEEN 
NOTICED IN WASHINGTON, WHERE EVENYEMEN\'S FRIENDS WERE 
BECOMING INCREASINGLY WORRIE ABOUT THE EXTREME NATURE OF 
SOME OF SALEH\'S COMENTS.  SUCH STRIDENT RHETORIC ONLY SERVED 
TO ENCURAGE VIOLENT REJECTIONISTS ON THE PALESTINIAN SID 
AND CONFIRM HARD-LINE ISRAELI CLAIMS THAT ALL AABS WANT WAR 
WITH ISRAEL.  GIVEN THE VOLATILITY O THE CURRENT SITUATION, 
OFFICIAL ROYG STATEMENTSSHOULD BE URGING BOTH SIDES TO 
RETURN TO PEACEFU NEGOTIATION, NOT EXHORTING MUSLIMS TO 
JIHAD OR ALESTINIANS TO VIOLENT RESISTANCE. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
ROYG POLICY UNCHANGED:  SUPPORT FOR THE MEPP 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C)  BA JAMMAL DEMURRED, CLAIMING THAT OTHER ARAB EADERS 
HAD ISSUED SIMILARLY STRONG PUBLIC STATEMNTS.  SALEH 
SHOULDN\'T BE SINGLED OUT.  POINTING OT THAT HE HAD 
SUCCESSFULLY PREVENTED ANTI-MEPP LNGUAGE FROM BEING INCLUDED 
IN THE OIC SUMMIT\'S FNAL COMMUNIQUE, BA JAMMAL INSISTED THAT 
THE ROYGS SUPPORTIVE POLICY FOR THE PEACE PROCESS HAD NOT 
AND WOULD NOT CHANGE.  PEACEFUL NEGOTIATION WAS TH ONLY WAY 
TO ACHIEVE A JUST, LASTING PEACE BETWEN ISRAEL AND THE 
PALESTINIANS.  AT THE SAME TIME THE U.S. MUST UNDERSTAND 
THAT THE YEMENI LEADERHIP IS UNDER TREMENDOUS PUBLIC OPINION 
PRESSURE;THE YEMENI STREET HAS TO BE APPEASED.  SALEH\'S 
REENT RHETORIC REFLECTS A \"COMPETITION\" BETWEEN THE ROYG AND 
THE DOMESTIC OPPOSITION FOR THE PUBLIC\'S FAVOR, NOT A POLICY 
SHIFT. 
 
6.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR WARNED BA JAMMAL THAT A CONTINUATION 
OF SALEH\'S RHETORIC RISKED BEING INTERPRETED IN WASHINGTON AS 
AN INDICATION THAT ROYG POLICY HAS CHANGED OR IS IN THE 
PROCESS OF CHANGING.  BA JAMMAL TOOK THE POINT, BUT 
DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN ROYG STRATEGY (OVERALL SUPPORT FOR THE 
MEPP AND PEACEFUL NEGOTIATION) AND TACTICS (BUYING TIME BY 
APPEASING PUBLIC ANGER).  THE AMBASSADOR CONCLUDED BY 
SUGGESTING THAT IT WOULD BE IN EVERYONE\'S INTEREST IF THE 
ROYG BEGAN TO FOCUS ON STRATEGY RATHER THAN TACTICS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  SALEH\'S DESIRE TO BURNISH HIS PAN-ARAB CREDENTIALS 
AND AVOID OPENING HIMSELF TO ATTACKS FROM THE OPPOSITION IS 
PREDICTABLE, IF LAMENTATBLE.  OPPOSITION (AND ESPECIALLY 
ISLAAH) CRITICISM OF THE ROYG\'S DECISION EARLIER THIS YEAR TO 
REVISE ITS TRAVEL POLICY TO ALLOW YEMENI-ORIGIN ISRAELIS TO 
RETURN HOME ON LAISSEZ-PASSER WAS PARTICULARLY NASTY.  AS A 
RESULT, THE NEW POLICY HAD TO BE SUSPENDED.  SALEH MUST ALSO 
CAREFULLY MANAGE THE PUBLIC OPINION ASPECTS OF THE U.S. 
INVESTIGATIVE PRESENCE IN YEMEN FOLLOWING THE OCTOBER 12 
TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE USS COLE IN ADEN HARBOR.  TAKING 
HARD-LINE STANCES ON REGIONAL ISSUES GIVES SALEH THE 
POLITICAL COVER HE NEEDS FOR THE CLOSE AND ONGOING 
YEMENI-U.S. JOINT INVESTIGATION.  THAT SAID, HIS RECENT 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON IRAQ AND THE MEPP ARE WELL BEYOND THE 
PALE EVEN IF THEY REFLECT SALEH\'S MERCURIAL AND COMBATIVE 
NATURE RATHER THAN A SHIFT IN ROYG POLICY.  AMBASSADOR HAS 
REQUESTED AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT TO DISCUSS U.S. 
CONCERNS.

(U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR BARBARA K. BODINE.  REASONS 1.5 
B/D. 
 
1. (C)  IN HIS MBC INTERVIEW EARLIER THIS WEEK, YEMENI 
PRESIDENT SALEH STATED THAT \"THE AMERICANS MADE A GROSS 
MISTAKE WHEN THEY MOVED SUCH A HUGE SHIP (THE USS COLE) INTO 
ADEN HARBOR WITHOUT PROVIDING SUFFICIENT 
PROTECTION....WITHOUT (YEMENI) PROTECTIVE VESSELS GOING IN 
WITH IT.  THEY DID NOT ASK FOR OUR PROTECTION AND THIS IS A 
MISTAKE, A GROSS MILITARY MISTAKE.\"  THE PRESIDENT STATED 
VIRTULLY THE EXACT SAME THING TO THE AMBASSADOR ON NOVEMBER 
21 (OTHER SUBJECTS SEPTELS). 
 
2.  (C) AMBASSADOR REJOINED THAT IT WAS HIGHLY DISTASTEFUL 
THAT THE USS COLE WOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK IT 
SUFFERED.  SHE PRESUMED THAT THE MISINFORMATION THE PRESIDENT 
HAD BEEN PROVIDED ON THIS SCORE WAS PROVIDED BY THE SAME 
\"SENIOR ADVISOR\" WHO INFORMED HIM THE EXPLOSION WAS AN 
INTERNAL ACCIDENT (I.E., THE COMMANDER OF THE NAVY IN ADEN, 
GENERAL IBRAHIM).  SHE ALSO REMINDED THE PRESIDENT THAT IT 
WAS YEMEN\'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. 
THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING WE NEED REQUEST. IT WAS TO BE 
EXPECTED. 
 
3.  (C)  SHE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT, CONTRARY TO A FOLLOW-UP 
POINT BY THE PRESIDENT, THE YEMEN NAVY WAS AWARE OF THE BSF. 
THE ROYG WAS INFORMED IN A PROPER AND TIMELY MANNER, AS WELL 
AS APPROPRIATE PORT AUTHORITIES.  \"DIDN\'T KNOW\" WAS NOT AN 
ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE BY THE YEMEN NAVY.  SALEH CONCEDED THAT 
MAYBE YEMENI INTERAGENCY COMMUNICATIONS WAS NOT ALWAYS GOOD 
AND THAT THE NAVY\'S ARGUMENT WAS NOT TERRIBLY CREDIBLE. 
 
4.  (C)  COMMENT:  WE ARE QUITE SURE THIS TRASH WAS DELIVERED 
BY THE NAVAL COMMANDER, PROBABLY IN DEFENSE FROM A 
PRESIDENTIAL QUERY AS TO WHY HE HAD NOT TAKEN THE NECESSARY 
PRECAUTIONS. THE COMMANDER IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PURVEYOR OF THE 
INTERNAL EXPLOSION THEORY AND IS WELL-KNOWN FOR BEING BOTH 
INCOMPETENT AND VENAL.  ONE FACTOR IN A RECENT FRENCH 
DECISION TO CANCEL A PLANNED PORT VISIT IN ADEN WAS A 
$1000.00 \"SHAKEDOWN\" FROM THE COMMANDER.  THE YEMEN NAVY AT 
ONE POINT ATTEMPTED TO CHARGE THE USN A $500 \"ESCORT 
SERVICES\" FEE, A SERVICE NEITHER REQUESTED NOR NEEDED. WHEN 
RAISED WITH THE SOUTHERN AREA COMMANDER, THESE FEES STOPPED. 
IT WAS ALSO OBVIOUS TO BOTH US AND TO SENIOR MILITARY 
OFFICIALS IN ADEN SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK, SPECIALLY 
GENERALS ALAYWAH AND MAGWALLAH, THAT THE YEMEN NAVY HAD NO 
CONCEPT OF HOW TO SET UP PICKET SHIPS. THE DRESSING DOWN THE 
COMMANDER RECEIVED FROM THE TWO GENERALS PORT SIDE AND IN 
FRONT OF A SENIOR AMERICAN DELEGATION WAS DEVASTATING. WE 
SUSPECT THE COMMANDER IS STILL SCRAMBLING TO SAVE HIS JOB.

2. (C) AMBASSADOR CALLED PRESIDENT SALEH UPON RECEIPT OF 
REFTEL. MAKING SUGGESTED POINTS, AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED URGENT 
NEED FOR MAXIMUM SECURITY EFFORT AND SUPPORTIVE STATEMENTS BY 
ROYG.  SALEH RESPONDED THAT HE HAD ALREADY GEARED UP HIS 
SECURITY FORCES TO ASSURE SECURITY FOR OFFICIAL AND 
NON-OFFICIAL AMERICANS AS WELL AS EUROPEANS.  \"YOU WILL BE 
MORE SECURE IN SANAA THAN WASHINGTON,\" HE SAID.  AMBASSADOR 
THANKED SALEH AND THEN ASKED FOR SUPPORTIVE YEMENI STATEMENT 
TO SHAPE YEMENI PUBLIC OPINION.  SALEH WAS NONCOMMITTAL, 
EXPRESSING SOME CONCERN THAT THE U.S. HAD NOT FULLY EXHAUSTED 
THE POSSIBILITY OF ARAB OR ISLAMIC DIPLOMACY.  HE SAID THE 
PRIORITY FOR NOW SHOULD BE SECURITY AND HE WOULD CONSIDER 
YEMEN\'S POLITICAL POSITION AFTER SEEING HOW THE MILITARY 
OPERATION IS CONDUCTED.  HE SUGGESTED THE AMBASSADOR SEE HIM 
MONDAY OR TUESDAY TO DISCUSS FURTHER THE POLITICAL DIMENSION. 
 
3. (C)  IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION, FOREIGN MINISTER AL-QIRBI 
TOLD AMBASSADOR THAT YEMEN WOULD ENDORSE THE U.S. RIGHT TO 
SELF DEFENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ONGOING HOSTILITIES. HE 
ALSO SAID HE WOULD BE TRAVELING TOMORROW TO THE OIC MEETING 
AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY IN YEMEN\'S 
POSITION BETTER TO SHAPE THE OUTCOME OF THAT MEETING. 
 
4. (C)  COMMENT:  SALEH\'S RETICENCE TO TAKE A STRONG 
POLITICAL STAND REFLECTS LINGERING YEMENI CONCERN THAT YEMEN 
EVENTUALLY MIGHT BE A MILITARY TARGET.  SPECIOUS MEDIA 
REPORTS AND ILL-INFORMED SPECULATION BY EUROPEAN AND ARAB 
DIPLOMATIC AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ARE FEEDING THIS 
CONCERN. 
 
5.  (C)  ACTION REQUESTED:  IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF AMBASSADOR 
COULD REASSURE PRESIDENT SALEH IN MON/TUES MEETING THAT THE

THIS SHOULD COME AS A MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY POWELL OR

SUBJECT: USS COLE: INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMB: EJHULL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B), (C), AND (D). 
 
1.  (S/NOFORN) BEGIN SUMMARY:  THE YEMENI GOVERNMENT IS 
MOVING TOWARDS KEY DECISIONS REGARDING THE USS COLE 
INVESTIGATION, AND THE SUSPECTS IT HOLDS FALL INTO FOUR 
CATEGORIES: A) THOSE WHO WILL FACE TRIAL SOON; B) THOSE WHOSE 
TRIAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE HELD IN ABEYANCE AT U.S. REQUEST; 
C) THOSE WHO WILL BE RELEASED; AND D) THOSE THE YEMENI 
GOVERNMENT IS UNLIKELY TO PROSECUTE, BUT WHOM WE SHOULD 
PURSUE IN OTHER WAYS.  AMBASSADOR\'S RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE: 
PROVIDING LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO YEMEN FOR CATEGORY (A) AND 
PURSUING SEALED INDICTMENTS FOR CATEGORY (D).  SEE FULL 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS BELOW.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (S/NOFORN) DURING GENERAL FRANKS\'S VISIT OCTOBER 17, 
AMBASSADOR RAISED WITH PRESIDENT SALEH PROSECUTION OF USS 
COLE DEFENDANTS.  NOTING THE RECENT ATTACK ON THE FRENCH 
TANKER, AMBASSADOR ARGUED THAT A VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF 
TERRORISTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USS COLE ATTACK WAS A 
NECESSARY SIGNAL FOR TERRORISTS PLANNING OTHER ATTACKS. 
SALEH INITIALLY COMMENTED THAT THE CASE WAS \"SUB JUDICE\" AND 
NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE.  HE QUICKLY ADDED THAT YEMENI JUSTICE 
WOULD BE TOUGH AND INCLUDE LONG SENTENCES AND EVEN 
EXECUTIONS.  TO FOLLOW UP AMBASSADOR\'S MARKER, EMBASSY 
PROPOSES FOLLOWING THOUGHTS ON THIS CASE. 
 
3.   (S/NOFORN) THE FBI/NCIS TEAM THAT IS WORKING HERE ON THE 
USS COLE INVESTIGATION IS DOING A SUPERB JOB WITH THE 
YEMENIS, AND IN THEIR UPDATES FOR AMBASSADOR IT IS BECOMING 
CLEAR THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES FOR WASHINGTON TO 
CONSIDER.  THE GOVERNMENT HERE IS IN THE PROCESS OF DECIDING 
FINALLY WHICH SUSPECTS TO PROSECUTE AND PUT ON TRIAL, WHAT 
KIND OF CASES TO PRESENT, AND WHAT DISPOSITION TO MAKE OF 
REMAINING SUSPECTS.  THE KEY U.S. OBJECTIVE IN THIS IS TO SEE 
THAT THE GUILTY ARE CONVICTED AND PUNISHED, BUT THIS GOAL IS 
LIKELY TO BE SATISFIED ONLY PARTIALLY BY YEMEN\'S DECISIONS. 
IN ADDITION, IT APPEARS THAT BECAUSE OF SHORTCOMINGS IN PSO\'S 
ABILITY TO PREPARE A CASE FOR THE PROSECUTORIAL ARM OF THE 
YEMENI GOVERNMENT, THERE IS A NEED FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE FROM 
THE U.S. PROSECUTION SIDE. 
 
4.  (S/NOFORN). FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY, HERE ARE FOUR 
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF YEMENI-HELD SUSPECTS IN THE COLE 
CASE, AND AMBASSADOR\'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH. 
 
5.  (S/NOFORN) THE FIRST CATEGORY CONTAINS EIGHT AND POSSIBLY 
NINE INDIVIDUALS.  THESE WE UNDERSTAND THE PSO CONSIDERS THAT 
IT HAS EVIDENCE AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE 
INTENTION TO PROSECUTE, CONVICT, AND PUNISH.  THOSE EIGHT 
INDIVIDUALS ARE: 
 
-- MURAD AL-SURURI 
-- ALI AL-MURAKAB 
-- AHMAD AL-SHINI 
-- YASSER AL-IZZANI 
-- YASSER AHMAD QASSIM 
-- ABDULLAH AL-HAKEEM 
-- MUHAMMED DARAMAH 
-- NABIL SALUH 
 
THE NINTH INDIVIDUAL, WAHIB AL-KHODR, THE PSO CONSIDERS IN 
THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE OTHER EIGHT, BUT IS LESS SURE OF ITS 
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM. 
 
FOR THIS GROUP, AMBASSADOR RECOMMENDS THAT UNLESS THE USG HAS 
EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, EXONERATING OR MITIGATING THESE 
INDIVIDUALS, THAT WE OFFER TO ASSIST THE YEMENI PROSECUTION 
IN THESE CASES.  OUR FBI/NCIS TEAM HERE ADVISES THAT WHILE 
PSO MAY HAVE EVIDENCE THAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE COMPELLING, 
FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, THE CASES MAY NOT BE EQUALLY 
STRONG.  IN PARTICULAR, THEN, LEGAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE U.S. 
ATTORNEY\'S OFFICE IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK COULD 
BE INVALUABLE TO THE YEMENI ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S TEAM AS IT 
SEEKS TO SHAPE THESE PROSECUTIONS, USING WHATEVER EVIDENCE 
MAY ALREADY BE IN THE FILE CASES PROVIDED BY THE PSO AND, 
ALSO, ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THE USG MAY BE ABLE TO 
DEVELOP FROM OTHER SOURCES.  SUCH ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE 
PROVIDED ASAP, AS YEMENI OFFICIALS ARE ON PUBLIC RECORD 
STATING THAT COLE PROSECUTIONS WILL BEGIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
A STRONG PROSECUTION CASE OBVIOUSLY SERVES BOTH U.S. AND 
YEMENI INTERESTS, AND WE SHOULD ASSIST IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE. 
 
6.  (S/NOFORN) THE SECOND CATEGORY CONTAINS THREE 
INDIVIDUALS.  THESE WERE IDENTIFIED IN FBI DIRECTOR\'S LETTER 
PRESENTED TO PRESIDENT SALEH ON SEPTEMBER 25 - INDIVIDUALS 
WHOM THE U.S. WOULD LIKE TO BE HELD BUT NOT SENT TO TRIAL 
UNTIL THE U.S. COMPLETES INDICTMENTS AGAINST ABD AL-RAHIM 
NASHIRI, TAWFIQ BIN ATTASH, AND AHMAD AMIN.  THESE THREE 
INDIVIDUALS ARE: 
 
-- FAHD AL-QUSO\'A 
-- JAMAL AL-BADAWI 
-- AHMAD AHMAD HASAN AMIN (ABU JAFAR AL-TAYYAR) 
 
WE EXPECT THE YEMENI GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ACCEDE TO 
THE U.S. REQUEST TO HOLD IN ABEYANCE GOING TO TRIAL FOR THESE 
THREE.  ACCORDINGLY, AMBASSADOR RECOMMENDS THAT U.S. 
INDICTMENTS AGAINST NASHIR, ATTASH, AND AMIN BE COMPLETED AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT FURTHER DELAY IS AVOIDED.  SUCH A 
STEP WILL HELP THE YEMENIS SEE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THE 
COLE INVESTIGATION IN ITS ENTIRETY, AS PART OF OUR 
COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS AGAINST AL-QAEDA.  INDEFINITE DELAY 
COULD HAVE UNFORESEEABLE COSTS. 
 
7.  (S/NOFORN) THE THIRD CATEGORY CONTAINS FOUR INDIVIDUALS. 
THESE FOUR THE YEMENIS HAVE DETERMINED THEY DO NOT HAVE 
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE, AND ACCORDINGLY WOULD 
RELEASE.  THESE FOUR ARE: 
 
-- ABD AL-SALAM AL-FAQIR 
-- ABD AL-HAMID MUTHANA 
-- ABD AL-KARIM AL-RIMI 
-- SA\'EED AL-WAHSH 
 
FBI/NCIS INVESTIGATORS IN SANAA AGREE THAT THERE IS LITTLE OR 
NO EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. 
UNLESS THE U.S. HAS EVIDENCE ELSEWHERE IMPLICATING THESE FOUR 
WHICH WOULD STRENGTHEN A YEMENI PROSECUTION OF THEM, 
AMBASSADOR RECOMMENDS THAT WE INFORM YEMEN OF NO OBJECTION TO 
THEIR RELEASE. 
 
8.  (S/NOFORN) THE FOURTH CATEGORY CONTAINS TWO INDIVIDUALS. 
THESE HAVE PRIOR ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE PSO AND THEREFORE WE 
CANNOT EXPECT YEMEN WILL PROSECUTE THEM.  THESE TWO ARE: 
 
-- BASHIR AL-SHADADI 
-- AHMAD AMIN (ALSO INCLUDED IN SECOND CATEGORY.) 
 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT U.S. EVIDENCE LEAVES NO DOUBT OF THE 
INVOLVEMENT OF THESE TWO IN THE COLE ATTACK.  ACCORDINGLY, 
AMBASSADOR RECOMMENDS THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SEEK A 
SEALED INDICTMENT FOR THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS, AND IN THE EVENT 
THEY TRAVEL OUTSIDE YEMEN, THE U.S. MAY BE ABLE TO SECURE THE 
COOPERATION OF A FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT TO ARREST AND HAND THEM 
OVER TO U.S. AUTHORITIES FOR U.S. PROSECUTION.

SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING - 4 JANUARY 2003 
 
REF: SANAA 04060 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary: The Ambassador convened an EAC 
meeting on January 4, 2003, to assess recent threat 
information that emerged from the investigation of the Dec. 
30 Jibla Hospital shooting (see reftel) and adopt measures to 
enhance security for Yemen-based American citizens.  Key 
offices and personnel represented at the meeting included: 
DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, RMO, ORCA, DAO, OMC, SOC 
YEMEN, FPD and FBI.  End summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador held an EAC meeting on January 4 
to analyze investigative findings known thus far about the 
December 30 Jibla Hospital shooting and how this information 
can be used to bolster security for Americans who reside and 
work in Yemen.  FBI conveyed that the perpetrator, Abd 
Abdulrazak Mohammed Kamel, was motivated to kill Dr. Martha 
Myers primarily because he was told of her success in 
converting numerous Yemenis from Islam to Christianity.  FBI 
emphasized Kamel\'s focus on killing proselytizers, relaying 
that Kamel confessed he has nothing against Americans, 
Christians or Jews.  Nevertheless, Kamel added that U.S. 
Middle East policy is partly to blame for his actions, based 
on the U.S. military presence in the Red Sea and Arabian 
Peninsula and support for Israel. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  EAC discussed the nature and extent of the 
linkage between Kamel and Ali Al-Jarala (who assassinated the 
Deputy Secretary General of the Yemeni Socialist Party on 
December 28), focusing on the potential risk facing the 
American community.  The Ambassador concluded that the most 
prominent targets are Yemeni secularist politicians, 
missionaries and members of the U.S. military.  However, he 
placed great importance on determining which other 
individuals may be in danger, tasking POLM, RSO and FBI to 
request further information from the PSO and Ministry of 
Interior. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  EAC identified specific organizations whose 
members and employees may be vulnerable because they are 
either U.S. citizens, organizations with U.S. affiliations, 
or organizations associated with religious groups or 
practices.  The list includes: Yemen America Language 
Institute (part of the U.S. Embassy); United Nations; the 
NGOs CARE, Amideast and National Democratic Institute; Sanaa 
International School; Adra (a faith-based Christian USAID 
contractor); a Protestant-run eye clinic; and Sanaa-based 
church services held in private residences.  The Ambassador 
assigned particular EAC members to liaise with appropriate 
organization leaders to advise of the threat and consult on 
the implementation of additional security practices.  FPD 
will return to Jibla to conduct a security review for the 
benefit of Americans who choose to remain. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  The meeting ended with concern about any 
potential danger associated with unofficial travel within 
Yemen.  EAC concluded that unofficial travel will be approved 
on a case by case basis. 
 
6.  (U)  Ambassador will meet with American wardens, 
including representatives of groups noted para. 4, to share 
information on Jibla attack and encourage self-assessments of 
vulnerabilities and heightened security.

week, including the condolences received and the ROYG\'s 
efforts to galvanize public opinion to counter terror. 
Recent ROYG efforts include a government report to 
parliament, an unusual cabinet meeting chaired by Saleh after 
the Jibla incident and a meeting of Islamic scholars (ulema) 
to denounce terror (septel).  The FM agreed that mobilizing 
public opinion was very important, noting that the ROYG 
cannot fight terrorism without popular support and a 
comprehensive approach that includes economic development and 
educational reform.  Qirby said that the U.S.-ROYG 
relationship should be expanded.  The Ambassador agreed with 
the notion of a comprehensive approach and mentioned several 
ongoing and future initiatives that the USG is undertaking in 
development, including the hospital in Marib, expanded work 
in Beihan and al-Jowf and the return of USAID. 
 
3.  (S)  The Ambassador reported to Qirby continuing acute 
interest in Washington in finalizing understanding on North 
Korean-Yemeni arms deals.  Given his role in managing the 
crisis, the Secretary was interested in a clear understanding 
that would avoid any future problem.  Ambassador then pressed 
for the ROYG\'s response letter in the exchange of letters to 
close the loop on the SCUDs issue (ref b).  Qirby said that 
President Saleh instructed him to facilitate a meeting for 
the Ambassador with the Minister of Defense to get accurate 
details on any remaining shipments of parts and to formulate 
the ROYG\'s response letter.  Ambassador said we would hold 
that meeting soonest. 
 
4.  (S)  Qirby agreed to study a more detailed Embassy 
request to facilitate diplomatic pouches, including \"belly 
loads\" (ref A). 
 
5.  (S)  The Ambassador briefed the FM on the special IV 
program for presidential and MFA protocol officers and on the 
NESA seminar being organized to assist the ROYG in developing 
a national military strategy.  Qirby expressed appreciation 
for both initiatives. 
 
6.  (S)  Qirby brought up the notion of developing mechanisms 
for dialogue and said he was developing a plan to establish 
working teams.  The Ambassador noted a possible visit from 
A/S Burns and/or Qirby\'s next visit to Washington as good 
starting points. 
 
7.  (S)  Comment:  Qirby\'s promotion of a meeting with the 
MOD may indicate he wants an authoritative statement of 
Yemen\'s arms relationship with North Korea and/or he wants 
the Embassy to do the ROYG interagency coordination of this 
issue.  We have already requested a meeting with the MOD to 
follow up.  End Comment.

1.  (S)  Summary:  Formerly on the defensive regarding 
counter-terrorism cooperation with the U.S., the ROYG has 
seized the initiative in the aftermath of the recent terror 
attacks to push forward on broad CT activity and put 
opposition parties on the defensive.  Its public outreach and 
media campaign (refs) continue at a higher pace and are 
joined by increased support and positive popular reaction 
from all elements of Yemeni society.  Yemeni political will 
to fight terror is on the rise.  End summary. 
 
2.  (S)  The ROYG presented its report on terror to 
parliament on December 30, partially in response to requests 
from opposition parties to explain U.S.-Yemeni 
counter-terrorism cooperation in the aftermath of the 
November 3 attack on al-Harithi but also to seize the 
initiative on countering terror.  The report came two days 
after the assassination of Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) 
leader Jarallah Omar and on the same day as the killings of 
three Amcits in Jibla.  Prime Minister Bajammal added the two 
incidents at the last minute to the already-drafted report 
that was read to parliament, broadcast on television and 
published in the official newspaper.  Notably, in the report 
the ROYG states publicly for the first time that it not only 
cooperated in the November 3 incident but requested the 
action from the U.S.  It also stated that there is nothing 
constitutionally or legally to prevent coordination and 
cooperation with the U.S. and other states.   The report 
emphasized the need for comprehensive economic, educational, 
cultural and social dealings to confront terror and called 
for the mobilization of society to combat terrorism in all 
its forms.  Reaction to the ROYG\'s report was mixed, with 
opposition parties noting that it did not address the root 
causes of terror and it inferred blame on opposition 
(particularly the Islah party).  ROYG statements after each 
terror incident also mentioned specifically each killer\'s 
affiliation with the Islah party. 
 
3.  (U)  The ROYG Shura Council strongly condemned the 
killings last week in a statement on December 30, urging all 
Yemenis to heighten their vigilance to thwart any terror 
plots and expressing deep regret over what the terrorists did 
to Omar and the Americans.  President Saleh called a 
well-publicized extraordinary cabinet session on January 1 to 
condemn the killings and reiterate the need for national 
unity in combating terror. 
 
4.  (U)  Tens of thousands of mourners gathered on January 1 
for the funeral of Jarallah Omar.  In a peaceful procession, 
mourners from all walks of life carried signs saying \"no to 
terrorism.\"  Several anti-violence demonstrations were held 
in cities around Yemen, including Taiz and Bani Husheish, on 
January 2, with demonstrators shouting anti-terror slogans 
and carrying anti-violence banners. 
 
5.  (U)  ROYG officials have increased their crackdown on 
mosque preachers who use sermons politically or as a means to 
incite violence, as evidenced by several arrests in the last 
week and by statements in the official televised sermon on 
January 3.  In that sermon, the imam said that \"mosques must 
be centers for national awareness\" and not the dissemination 
of divisive party ideologies and youths need to be guided 
with regard to true Islam \"where there is no fanaticism or 
extremism\" and taught \"moderation, tolerance and leniency.\" 
Yemeni religious scholars (ulema) issued a statement strongly 
condemning the attacks and preaching a message of tolerance 
on January 2. 
 
6.  (U)  Public and private statements of condolence and 
condemnation of the attacks were written as editorials in 
government and opposition newspapers, issued by political 
parties in public statements and delivered by letter and in 
person to the Embassy from Yemenis across the political and 
social spectrum.  Leaders from the General People\'s Congress 
(GPC) and Islah party paid calls on the Ambassador to deliver 
condolences personally, and the YSP sent a letter. 
 
7.  (S)  The Islah party has been on the defensive after ROYG 
statements linking the two killers of last week\'s attack to 
their party and to al-Iman University, led by their recently 
re-elected Shura Council chairman al-Zindani.  In public 
statements, they have condemned the attacks and sought to 
distance themselves from them;  however, they have accused 
the government of using the attacks for partisan purposes. 
Interviews with Islah party leaders Sheikh al-Ahmar and 
al-Zindani have been more moderate than usual regarding 
counter-terrorism cooperation and have condemned terrorism. 
 
8.  (S)  Comment:  The ROYG has used the opportunity 
presented by recent tragic events to seize the initiative on 
combating terrorism and stigmatizing terrorists.  Its 
stepped-up mobilization of its counter-terrorism campaign has 
put opposition forces on the defensive, particularly the 
Islah party, and forced them to join the anti-terror 
bandwagon or risk being labeled harborers and supporters of 
terrorists.  After two months of attacks on the ROYG for its 
cooperation with the U.S. in the November 3 incident, 
opposition parties are now scrambling for ways to convince 
Yemenis and the international community of their 
counter-terrorism credentials.  End comment.

 1.  (S)  Summary:  The arrest of al-Moayed in Frankfurt has 
surprised many in Yemen, and public reaction is extremely 
negative.  He is a well-known humanitarian to Yemenis, and 
many have expressed shock about a possible connection to 
al-Qaeda.  The Islah party is particularly concerned, and 
similarly rejects the possibility that al-Moayed has an 
al-Qaeda connection.  Negative public reaction to the 
arrests, possibly including demonstrations, is likely.  The 
Yemeni government continues to low key the issue and press 
the FRG for repatriation.  Embassy is assessing security 
implications.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Negative Popular Reaction 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (S)  Moayed is a Islah party Shura Council member and 
formerly a probable candidate for the parliamentary elections 
in April.  Media reports (confirmed by PolFSN) noted that a 
petition with 1000 signatures calling for his release was 
circulated in Moayed\'s neighborhood in Sanaa, where he is 
regarded as a humanitarian who is against terrorism. The 
media has reported that the Islah party plans to provide 
lawyers to those arrested.  Prominent Yemeni interlocutors 
confirmed to the DCM that Moayed is a noted humanitarian, 
active in aiding the poor in general -- particularly via the 
provision of free food to thousands of low-income Sanaa 
residents.  Embassy contacts also recall that he was \"the 
leading recruiter in Sanaa\" for volunteers to fight the 
Soviets in Afghanistan.  One (pro-U.S.) Yemeni NGO official 
described Moayed as \"a big mouth\" who sometimes rants about 
U.S. policy.  Nevertheless, a range of contacts agree that 
his sermons also oppose anti-Western terrorism, and uniformly 
view him as an extremely unlikely candidate for al-Qaeda 
terrorist affiliation. 
 
-------------- 
Islah Approach 
-------------- 
 
3.  (S)  Urgent requests for a meeting with PolOff were made 
by members of the Islah, and PolOff met with Islah Political 
Director Mohamed Qahtan on January 12.  Qahtan, a well-known 
moderate, said that he is convinced that al Moayed could have 
nothing to do with al-Qaeda, and noted that in his last 
mosque speech he condemned terrorism strongly with specific 
references to the incidents in Jibla and against Jarallah 
Omar.  He also described al Moayed\'s humanitarian work on 
behalf of the poor, and expressed concern about his health 
while in custody.  Qahtan said that while he would not be 
shocked by some people being definitively linked with 
al-Qaeda, the alleged links between Moayed and al-Qaeda were 
unbelievable as he was not an extremist personality.  Qahtan 
asked for evidence of such links, and said that if such 
evidence were provided his party would support the arrest 
because Islah is totally against al-Qaeda.  (Comment:  Not 
true, especially Islah\'s Zindani wing.  End Comment)  Qahtan 
said that Islah feels strongly enough to offer to take 
responsibility for al Moayed and provide guarantees unless 
clear evidence emerged to prove links to al-Qaeda. 
 
4.  (S)  PolOff said that the two arrested were being held in 
Germany pending a court hearing, and that details about the 
criminal case would become public as the legal process 
continued.  PolOff noted that there was evidence linking al 
Moayed to al-Qaeda financing.  Qahtan asked about whether al 
Moayed\'s fundraising for Hamas via al-Aqsa would also be part 
of the court case, noting that while \"everyone was against 
al-Qaeda, support for Palestinians is another matter.\" 
PolOff emphasized a focus on links to al-Qaeda and allowing 
due process to take its course.  PolOff said that these 
arrests should not become a political issue between Islah and 
the U.S., and restraint in politicizing the arrests within 
Yemen would be prudent to avoid inflaming the situation. 
Qahtan agreed to advise restraint and said he hoped that the 
dialogue on this issue will continue. 
 
----------------- 
German Assessment 
----------------- 
5.  (S)  German Ambassador to Yemen Werner Zimprich told 
Ambassador Hull January 14 that he has received several 
\"grass roots\" appeals from Yemeni beneficiaries of 
al-Moayed\'s charity to return him to Yemen.  ROYG Interior 
Minister Alimi, who enjoys significant credibility, also 
argued strongly, in support of Yemen\'s case, with Ambassador 
Zimprich that al-Moayed has no links to terrorism.  The 
German Ambassador is re-assessing security for German 
citizens, including many development assistance workers.  As 
yet, he has not decided on a formal drawdown, but some 
Embassy employees have been encouraged to extend leaves 
outside Yemen. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (S)  Comment:  Several contacts have told Post they 
expect an active negative public reaction, including possible 
demonstrations.  The course of the German extradition process 
and subsequent U.S. prosecution will be followed closely by 
many Yemenis and will influence the shape of popular reaction 
in Yemen.  Embassy will assess security ramifications for 
Amcits at an EAC January 14.  As we proceed with extradition, 
U.S. public diplomacy should stress fair legal processes, 
al-Qaeda links and appropriate humanitarian treatment, e.g. 
medical care for any health problems.  End Comment.

Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary: The Ambassador convened an EAC 
meeting on January 14 to assess the security implications of 
the two recent detentions of Yemeni citizens in Germany (see 
reftel), and how this could affect security for official and 
unofficial Amcits in Yemen.  Also discussed was the need to 
provide security assistance to the National Democratic 
Institute (NDI) for its Yemeni election activities.  Key 
offices and personnel represented at the meeting included: 
DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, ORCA, DAO, OMC, SOC 
YEMEN AND FBI.  End summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador briefed the EAC on recent 
developments in Frankfurt, Germany, where honoring a USG 
request, German law enforcement authorities on January 10 
arrested two Yemeni males alleged to be linked to funding 
al-Qaeda.  The two men are being held in Germany pending 
extradition to the United States.  One arrestee, Sheikh 
Mohammed Ali Hassan Moayed, is a popular imam (Islamic 
spiritual leader) and a high-ranking official of the Islah 
party. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador explained that upon informing the 
Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) of the arrests, the ROYG 
requested that Germany return deport both men to Yemen.  The 
Ambassador noted that the ROYG has responded to this incident 
in a fairly low-key manner so far. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  The Regional Security Office (RSO) advised about 
the location of Sheikh Moayed\'s mosque in Sanaa.  Further, 
RSO stated that Embassy personnel are monitoring the area in 
the vicinity of the mosque.  EAC members noted that a 
demonstration following Friday prayers (1/17) was possible, 
but the area is not frequented by Amcits or other Westerners. 
 
 
5.  (S/NF)  The EAC decided that a warden message to the U.S. 
community was not warranted, as the extent of public reaction 
was not yet clear.  While a warden message and/or other 
responsive measures might become necessary, there was as yet 
no specific indications of a heightened threat to Amcits or 
U.S. interests due to the arrest of al-Moayed. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  In a separate item, the Ambassador conveyed that 
NDI, which is continuing its efforts to facilitate and 
monitor the April 2003 Yemeni election, requested security 
advice from the Embassy.  The RSO will consult with NDI in 
the near future to help safeguard NDI\'s staff members and 
operations.

2.  (S)  Summary:  On January 19, 2003 Ambassador Hull met 
with Foreign Minister Qirbi at the MFA.  Qirbi has received a 
letter from the Ministry of Defense outlining outstanding 
North Korean military shipments and plans to respond to 
Ambassador\'s letter this week.  Qirbi also commented on the 
counter-terrorism component of his recent trips to Sudan and 
Tanzania.  The Embassy reiterated concern over problems 
plaguing the receipt of the diplomatic pouch, informed Qirbi 
of the ongoing USAID visit, and expressed approval of Yemeni 
LNOs for CJTF/HOA.  End Summary.

Scuds

3.  (S)  Ambassador Hull\'s January 19th meeting with Minister 
Qirbi was also attended by DCM, AdminOff, PolOff (notetaker), 
and Minister Qirbi\'s Advisor Iryani. 
 
4.  (S)  The Ambassador reviewed his recent meeting with 
Defense Minister Aliwa, who stated that a North Korean team 
will travel to Yemen to help with scud installation.  In 
addition, spare parts for artillery and radar have been 
ordered from North Korea.  Aliwa also said the Defense 
Ministry provided input for a letter for Minister Qirbi\'s 
signature detailing these outstanding arrangements and 
expressing ROYG\'s commitment that no further SCUDs or other 
military material were on order or in transit from North 
Korea. 
 
5.  (S)  Minister Qirbi confirmed that said MOD information 
has arrived in his office, and said he expected to 
incorporate the information into a response to the 
Ambassador\'s letter within the coming week. Qirbi\'s response 
letter arrived at the Embassy on January 20th. 
 
---------------- 
Diplomatic Pouch 
---------------- 
 
6.  (S)  The Ambassador reiterated concern over continued 
problems with diplomatic pouches.  Qirbi said large shipments 
-- i.e. as many as 10 pouches at once -- would be problematic 
until he discussed pouch guidelines and reached a final 
understanding with PSO Chief Gamesh.  Qirbi stated that he 
would sit down with Gamesh (upon Gamesh\'s return from the 
U.S.) and seek final ROYG consensus on pouch guidelines.  DCM 
noted recent pouch shipment represented first successful 
\"bellyload\" of pouches and praised Yemen side for this 
positive step. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
USAID and Potential Development Projects 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (S)  The Ambassador briefed Qirbi on the ongoing USAID 
visit in preparation for the re-establishment of an AID 
office in Yemen.  He noted that the USG is working on a 
strategy and identifying suitable funding sources for further 
development assistance to Yemen.  Qirbi confirmed he is 
sending a letter to Secretary Powell regarding Yemen\'s 
participation in the Middle East Partnership Initiative and 
the Millenium Challenge Account. 
 
----------------- 
Counter-Terrorism 
----------------- 
 
8.  (S)  Minister Qirbi described his recent trip to Sudan 
and Tanzania as a meeting with friends of the anti-terror 
campaign.  When asked about the Sudanese and Tanzanian 
response to this campaign, Qirbi said that it was very 
positive, and added that everyone was aware of the importance 
of cooperation.  Qirbi volunteered that the Sudanese feel the 
U.S. is not as impartial as it should be especially in light 
of its involvement in southern Sudan.  Qirbi stated that the 
Sudanese have reached this conclusion based on U.S. 
legislation penalizing the Sudanese government for its 
activities in the south. 
9.  (S)  The Ambassador noted that practical cooperation 
between Yemen and the U.S. on anti-terrorism was going well 
and referred to meetings between Yemeni Ambassador to the 
U.S. al-Hajjri and A/S Burns and S/CT Coordinator Black.

Minister of Defense\'s selection of liaison officers for the 
USS Mt. Whitney, as a practical step.

1. (U) Summary:  As the least developed country in the NEA 
region, Yemen is likely to show rapid, tangible results from 
well-conceived MEPI-funded programming. The ROYG has welcomed 
the initiative warmly and publicly, and Foreign Minister Dr. 
Abu Bakr Al-Qirbi will send a letter to Secretary Powell in

Yemen. In addition, the imminent return of USAID to Embassy 
Sanaa will help to ensure that post has the capacity to 
manage MEPI funds and implement expanded programming 
effectively.

Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and has made MEPI an important 
component of post,s Mission Performance Plan (MPP). In fact, 
MEPI funding will be critical in achieving the Mission,s

MEPI Goals and Objectives

3.  (U)  Education reform, economic reform, political reform, 
digital readiness, and women,s empowerment are very relevant 
to Yemen and areas where the ROYG is committed to progress. 
The main obstacle to progress, however, is that Yemen has few 
resources from which to draw upon in each of these areas and 
relies heavily on donor assistance. 
 
In education reform, for example, the emphasis would be on 
literacy and availability of basic education more than on 
higher education. The objective in E1 referring to promotion 
of participatory learning and critical thinking skills is 
better situated to some of the wealthier states in the region 
than to Yemen. 
 
In economic reform, for example, Yemen is in dire need of 
technical assistance to strengthen its commercial legal 
systems and banking systems (ER2). Reform of these systems 
will not only boost foreign direct investment in Yemen but is 
also necessary for Yemen,s accession into the WTO and in 
meeting the criteria of the Millennium Challenge Fund. 
 
In political reform, Yemen\'s nascent democracy needs the 
support envisioned under the MEPI goals and objectives, 
including strengthened political parties, developed local 
councils, increased women\'s participation, improved election 
administration, professionalized media and a reformed 
judiciary. With continued support, Yemen,s vibrant democracy 
(Yemen has the most active democracy on the Arabian 
Peninsula) will be better equipped to face the challenges 
that lie ahead. 
 
In digital readiness cross-cut, the Ministry of Education 
lacks the resources to institute multi-media, broadcast, and 
Internet-based educational programming in the school system 
(DR3). As such, there is a general lack of information and 
communication technology knowledge. Fundamental skills, 
related to digital readiness, must first be developed before 
a digital marketplace can effectively take root in Yemen. 
 
In women,s empowerment cross-cut, reducing the drop-out rate 
of adolescent girls combined with women,s literacy programs 
is an important first step in empowering Yemeni women. In a 
country where two-thirds of all women are illiterate, basic 
women,s education programs must be the focus rather than 
increasing the number of successful female business owners 
and office holders as stated in WE1 and WE3. 
 
4.  (U)  A central theme of the Post,s MPP is \"no security 
without development, and no development without security.\" 
MEPI funding for visible, high-impact programs will thus 
buttress and help sustain progress on fundamental U.S. 
counter-terrorism goals in Yemen. The MEPI goals and 
objectives provide a good framework for helping Post target 
key sectors and regions for rapid tangible results and 
maximum impact against the existing support network for 
Islamist extremism. 
--------------------------------------------- 
FY  02 Supplemental Notional Program Planning 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  Post would like to enhance its presence in FY  02 
programming in region-wide and post-specific programs. For 
instance, the Incentives Program for Girls to Stay in School 
is extremely relevant to Yemen, with a girl,s illiteracy 
rate of 67.5%, and Yemen Government institutions are in great 
need of Information Technology assistance. 
 
6. (U)  The Yemen political party and tribal council training 
program already allocated is vital to Yemen,s democratic 
development.  In addition, however, parliamentary elections 
in April will be the most competitive parliamentary elections 
since unification in 1990 and could impact negatively on 
Yemen,s political reform efforts.  A vigorous domestic and 
international election observation effort to increase the 
confidence of Yemeni citizens in the election process and 
help alleviate possible violence is vital to the 
sustainability of democratic progress. 
 
----------------------------- 
FY ,03 MEPI Proposed Programs 
----------------------------- 
 
7.  Post has developed four program proposals that fit 
directly with the MEPI goals and is in the process of 
identifying and developing other programs. The four proposed 
programs that are being proposed for inclusion in the FY ,03 
MEPI program are defined below, with details septels: 
 
Strengthening Education in Rural Areas in Yemen: In-Service 
training for primary school teachers and administrators in 
selected underserved and disadvantaged governorates. This 
program fits directly with the \"Education Reform\" MEPI goal 
and its objective to \"Expand access to, and quality of, basic 
formal education, particularly for girls.\" 
 
Eradicating Women,s Illiteracy in Yemen: Providing basic 
literacy and life skills courses for adult women in selected 
underserved and disadvantaged governorates. This program fits 
the \"Education Reform\" MEPI goal and its objective to \"Expand 
access to, and quality of, basic formal education, 
particularly for girls.\" 
 
Providing the Internet to Yemeni High Schools and NGOs: 
Providing internet classrooms in high schools and access to 
internet for (mainly women,s) NGOs. This program fits the 
\"Digital Readiness\" MEPI cross cutting issue; the \"Education 
Reform\" MEPI goal and its objective to \"Expand access to, and 
quality of, basic formal education, particularly for girls.\" 
See ref B. 
 
Raising Awareness on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM): An 
activity to encourage the establishment of laws prohibiting 
the practice of FGM, and increasing the capacity of a Yemeni 
women,s advocacy NGO, the National Women,s Committee (NWC). 
This program fits the \"Women,s Empowerment\" MEPI cross 
cutting issue, and more specifically, the goal to \"Support 
founding, growth and networking of NGOs advocating equality 
of women.\" 
 
--------------------------------- 
Other MEPI Opportunities in Yemen 
--------------------------------- 
 
8. (U)  Post has identified other areas in which MEPI can 
play a significant role. Strategically targeted MEPI-funded 
programming will play a significant role in ensuring 
continued and enhanced economic development, political reform 
and security, which are vital to Yemen\'s stability, an 
essential ingredient in the global war on terror.

1.  (U)  Summary:  Per request in reftels, below is Embassy 
Sanaa\'s response for the International Narcotics Control 
Strategy Report (INCSR).  End summary. 
 
---------------- 
MONEY LAUNDERING 
---------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Yemen has no anti-money laundering legislation. 
Though the extent of money laundering is unknown, the lack of 
legislation, the existence of Islamic banks and the 
prevalence of Hawala make Yemen vulnerable to money 
laundering.  Yemen\'s banking sector is small and rudimentary. 
 It is composed of 12 commercial banks and two public sector 
specialized banks.  The Central Bank of Yemen supervises the 
country\'s banks. 
 
3.  (U)  In early 2001, the Central Bank presented a 
preliminary draft of anti-money laundering legislation to the 
Bankers Association for recommendations.  It was approved by 
the Central Bank\'s Board of Directors on May 27, 2002 and 
passed to the Yemeni Government on June 25, 2002.  President 
Saleh submitted the proposed legislation to Parliament on 
July 30, 2002, and Prime Minister Ba Jamal reiterated calls 
for its timely passage in December 2002.  When enacted, the 
legislation will place money laundering, and related 
activities, on a list of illegal actions along with 
embezzlement, theft, and kidnapping.  The proposed law also 
forbids opening bank accounts under fictitious names. 
 
4.  (U)  Yemen is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and 
has signed but not yet ratified the UN convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime. 
 
------------------- 
TERRORIST FINANCING 
------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  ROYG incorporated anti-money laundering provisions 
in its anti-terror campaign and added a new anti-terrorist 
financing section to pending anti-money laundering 
legislation.  In Yemen terrorist financing is considered a 
serious crime.  The Yemeni government has the authority to 
identify, freeze and seize terrorist assets under ROYG\'s 
Council of Ministers Resolution of October 2, 2001.  Yemen 
circulated to its financial institutions the list of 
individuals and entities that have been included on the UN 
1267 Sanctions Committee\'s Consolidated List as being linked 
to Usama Bin Laden, members of the Al-Qa\'ida organization or 
the Taliban, or that the USG or the E.U. have designated 
under relevant authorities.  Yemen identified, froze, and 
seized those assets. 
 
6.  (U)  Yemen has taken no quantifiable steps to regulate 
alternative remittance systems, however such initiatives are 
being considered. The ROYG asserts that a majority of hawala 
now goes through banks rather than informal local agents or 
moneychangers.  The Central Bank of Yemen licenses and 
regulates moneychangers, and they are not allowed to maintain 
accounts for their customers. 
 
7.  (U)  The ROYG has taken steps to thwart the misuse of 
charitable and or non-profit entities that can be used as 
conduits for the financing of terrorism.  A 2001 law 
governing charitable societies imposes penalties of 
imprisonment and/or fines on any society or its members for 
carrying out activities or spending funds in contravention of 
the aim and purpose for which the society was set up. 
However, it is unclear whether the law is strongly 
implemented by the Ministry of Pensions and Social Affairs, 
which oversees the activities of charitable societies.

SUBJECT: PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AGAINST WAR IN IRAQ IN SANAA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1/5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (U)  A large, peaceful and well-controlled demonstration 
was held on January 27 in Sanaa expressing solidarity with 
the Iraqi and Palestinian people and protesting a possible 
war in Iraq.  Demonstrators gathered from different points 
around the city to converge in mid-morning near the United 
Nations common premises (approximately 25 minutes away from 
the U.S. Embassy).  The demonstration was billed as a 
general, all-party demonstration, and prominent Yemeni 
politicians took part.  Presidential Advisor Abdul Karim 
al-Iryani and Speaker of Parliament Sheikh Abdullah Ahmar 
both gave speeches and marched with the demonstrators.  Crowd 
estimates vary widely from 250,000 to 5,000, with the latter 
being a likelier number.  Post used its radio net and warden 
message systems to warn Amcits to avoid non-essential travel 
during the demonstration, which did not approach the Embassy 
premises. 
 
2.  (U)  Post received early warning of possible 
demonstrations through press reports and contacts.  It was 
apparent early in the day that the ROYG was well-prepared for 
the demonstration, with hundreds of security officials 
deployed around Sanaa and concentrated near the United 
Nations complex.  According to security officials, several 
busloads of protesters from varying tribal areas were brought 
in for the demonstration.  A senior Yemeni security official 
estimated the crowd in front of the UN at 250,000.  Embassy 
assets estimate, however, a crowd closer to 5,000. 
 
3.  (U)  Although the demonstration appeared to be 
well-controlled and peaceful from the beginning, post decided 
to warn Amcits to avoid non-essential travel during the 
demonstration through its radio and warden message systems 
early in the morning.  By 12:15, post was able to disseminate 
an all-clear message that the demonstration was over and the 
participants were dispersing peacefully. 
 
4.  (C)  Comment:  Indications such as the high-profile 
participants involved and the detailed security presence show 
that the demonstration was probably orchestrated in part by 
the Yemeni government as a way to let the Yemeni public blow 
off steam.  It was peaceful and well-controlled, boding well 
for the ROYG\'s ability to control future demonstrations and 
ensure security.  End comment.

1.  (U)  Begin summary:  On Wednesday, January 29th, Yemeni 
security forces arrested Mohammed Ali Al-Zaidi, a suspect in 
both the July 27, 2001 kidnapping of German diplomat Rainer 
Berns and attacks on government institutions in the Marib 
governorate.  Al-Zaidi was wounded during a gunfight with 
security forces prior to his arrest and is currently under 
guard at a medical clinic in Marib.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  On January 29th Yemeni security forces apprehended 
Mohammed Ali Al-Zaidi, after a shoot-out in which a Yemeni 
soldier was killed, another wounded, and both Al-Zaidi and a 
relative, Ghalib Abdullah Al-Zaidi, were wounded. 
 
3.  (U)  Al-Zaidi is currently receiving medical treatment at 
Al-Wasit clinic in Marib under the guard of Yemeni security 
forces, but, according to the media, the situation on the 
ground remains \"very tense\".  Reportedly, both the tribes of 
Jiham and Murad refuse to allow Yemeni authorities to take 
Al-Zaidi out of Marib, and have threatened to fire on the 
soldiers if they try to take him by force. 
 
4.  (C)  Comment:  Al-Zaidi is described by numerous 
publications as a dangerous individual, who has spent time in 
Afghanistan and organized meetings for extremists. Yemeni 
security officials and a senior staffer for President Saleh 
have contacted the Embassy to draw attention to the Zaidi 
operation as a significant counter-terrorism success.  An 
advisor to Saleh told the DCM that Mohammed Ali Zaidi was 
considered \"one of the most dangerous al-Qaeda elements left 
in Yemen.\"  The German Embassy also called to clarify 
Al-Zaidi\'s position on our most wanted list, and to ask about 
his background.  Al-Zaidi was not, and is not, on any list of 
individuals wanted by U.S. authorities as far as post is 
aware.  Information available at post indicates Zaidi has had 
contacts with known al-Qaeda figures, but does not confirm 
that he himself had been an al-Qaeda operative. 
Nevertheless, the successful Yemeni raid is an important 
security success, and signals ROYG resolve to act against 
extremists.  End comment.

1.(U) Summary: Very few Yemeni newspapers so far reported 
and commented on the Secretary\'s Wednesday address at the 
United Nations Security Council. Al-Thawra, the official 
daily, reported excerpts of Powell\'s speech without 
commentary but referred to it in its editorial. Saba News 
Agency printed the entire speech in its daily bulletin 
today. Al-Ayyam, the main independent paper, reported 
excerpts of the speech without any comment. Yemen TV and 
Yemen Radio reported some excerpts of the speech 
commenting that this is another attempt by the U.S. to 
get international support for the attack on Iraq. Yemen 
TV invited an Egyptian political analyst to give his 
opinion on Powell\'s speech. He said: \"All the evidence 
presented by Powell is not new and there are things under 
suspicion. This information needs to be tested and 
verified.\" A senior MFA official commented privately to 
the Charge that the section of the speech detailing links 
between Iraq and al-Qaeda included \"important new 
information\" and was extremely interesting. (End Summary) 
 
2. (U) The following are headlines from Yemeni papers: 
 
Al-Thawra (official daily, Feb.06) carried a headline 
which says: \"Powell accuses Iraq of hiding weapons and 
its links with al-Qaeda; Baghdad describes U.S. evidence 
as `cartoon movies\'.\" A sub-headline says: \"France and 
China support promoting inspection operations with 
observation, and Germany adheres to its opposition 
against the option of war.\" 
 
Another sub-headline reads: \"A Russian scientist: Baghdad 
does not have scientific capability to produce new 
chemical weapons.\" 
 
Still another headline in the same paper declares: 
\"British intelligence: there is no link between Iraq and 
al-Qaeda.\" 
 
3. (U)Under the title \"Flood of War\" al-Thawra\'s 
editorial commented on Powell\'s speech saying: \"There is 
no disagreement among analysts that many of the scenarios 
of the war are ready. What was said in the meeting of the 
UN Security Council yesterday was nothing but an 
introduction to put these scenarios into effect...War, at 
any time, must not be an absolute option. Once a war 
breaks out, it will open the doors of hell not only for 
the states of the region but for the whole world.\" 
 
Al-Ayyam (Aden-based independent, Feb.06) carried a 
headline which reads: \"Powell: About 24 al-Qaeda suspects 
are stationed in Baghdad.\" The sub-headline reads: 
\"Powell accuses the Jordanian Abu Musa\'ab al-Zarqawi.\" 
The paper reported excerpts of the speech with no other 
comment.

1.  (C)  Summary:  Charge called on FM Qirbi to discuss the 
Secretary\'s UNSC speech and ongoing pouch issues (refs) on 
 
SIPDIS 
February 8.  Qirbi\'s response to the speech was measured, 
noting that it contained circumstantial evidence and 
expressing hope that the evidence can be given to inspectors 
to corroborate before any new UNSCR.  Qirbi looked ahead to 
the inspectors\' reports on February 14 and expressed hope 
that there would be no war.  Also present were MFA advisor 
al-Iryani, AdminOff and A/PolEcon Chief (notetaker).  End 
Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Iraq and Reaction to Secretary\'s UNSC Speech 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Charge said that Secretary Powell\'s speech clearly 
documented that Iraq is in material breach of UNSCR 1441, and 
noted that the Council might consider a second resolution. 
He underscored the importance of Blix\'s 2/14 report and 
emphasized that the onus is on Iraq to comply with its 
obligations.  Charge pointed out that, while there was no 
timetable for action, President Bush has made clear it must 
be a matter of weeks and not months.  FM Qirbi welcomed 
receipt of a copy of Secretary Powell\'s speech. 
 
3.  (C)  FM Qirbi replied that Powell\'s speech \"obviously\" 
contained a lot of \"circumstantial evidence\" and there were 
many points of view about what the evidence meant.  He 
expressed the view that all evidence should be given to the 
inspectors for follow-up investigation as a preliminary step 
to any new UNSCR.  Qirbi said that the ROYG looked forward to 
Blix\'s visit to Baghdad, and his report, to document that 
Iraq is not adhering to UNSCR 1441 or that the inspectors 
need more time.  The FM said that \"we in Yemen and in the 
region\" hope there will be no invasion and no war, as this 
would \"destabilize the delicate situation\" in the region.  He 
noted approvingly that the U.S., while sustaining pressure on 
Baghdad, was also showing some flexibility in its approach. 
 
4.  (C)  Qirbi also mentioned a speech by the Hezbollah 
Secretary General on February 7, which he perceived as 
 
SIPDIS 
addressing an admonitory message to Saddam.  The FM said the 
speech opposed war, but also called for institutional and 
political change in Iraq and placed the onus on Saddam to 
initiate a reform process. 
 
----- 
Pouch 
----- 
 
5.  (C)  Charge also brought up the diplomatic pouch issue 
and asked whether the FM had met with PSO Chief Gamish to 
finalize the last pending detail of the pouch guidelines 
worked out between Qirbi and Amb. Hull.  Qirbi noted that 
Gamish had just returned to Yemen February 6 after a lengthy 
stay abroad, and said he would try to meet with him before 
Eid.  Charge noted that the issue remained an Embassy 
priority and was followed at very high levels in the State 
Department.  AdminOff expressed appreciation for the MFA\'s 
assistance in facilitating the arrival of five classified 
pouch bags February 7, and also expressed concern that one of 
the bags was briefly, and apparently inadvertently, 
mishandled. 
 
---------------- 
CBW Escape Masks 
---------------- 
 
6.  (C) Charge informed FM Qirbi that CBW protective masks 
for Embassy Sanaa personnel had been held up in Customs for 
some weeks.  He asked for Qirbi\'s help if necessary to get 
the masks released before Eid, and Qirbi agreed. 
 
------------------------------------ 
MEPI; Heightened U.S. Security Alert 
------------------------------------ 
 
7.  (C)  Charge referred to the just-completed visit of 
NEA/RA Director Grappo, noting that it had been productive 
and should improve prospects for assistance to Yemen under 
the rubric of the Middle East Partnership Initiative.  Qirbi 
expressed gratitude and said that it is always useful to have 
officials come to Yemen so they can see for themselves the 
developments made and challenges faced in the country. 
Charge also described the recent worldwide security alerts, 
noting that these general alerts focused on the United States 
and the Persian Gulf (including Yemen), but that there were 
no known specific threats in Yemen.  Charge thanked Qirbi for 
the continuing excellent security provided by the ROYG to 
safeguard U.S. locations and personnel in Yemen. 
 
8.  (U)  Finally, Charge passed to Qirbi several letters, 
including the Secretary\'s Eid messages to him and the Prime 
Minister and the response to Qirbi\'s MEPI letter and the

SUBJECT: ROYG INITIATIVE TO ESTABLISH A CODE OF CONDUCT TO 
AVOID VIOLENCE IN THE RUN-UP TO THE APRIL ELECTIONS 
 
Classified By: Acting Pol/Econ Chief Catherine J. Westley.  Reason: 1.5 
 (b,d) 
 
 1.  (C)  Summary:  President Saleh this week proposed an 
initiative between the political parties to establish a Code 
of Conduct to ensure peaceful and fair elections.  In a 
controversial move, Saleh appointed Sheikh Zindani, leader of 
the extremist wing of the Islah party, to the multi-party 
committee that would oversee implementation of the Code.  If 
effective, the Code of Conduct could help alleviate possible 
campaign violence.  However, the reaction of the Islah party 
to Zindani\'s appointment as sole Islah representative could 
presage further discord among the parties.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  President Saleh and Vice President Abdo Rabo Manssor 
met with the heads of political parties on February 2 to 
discuss a number of issues related to President Saleh\'s call 
to establish a national Code of Conduct to achieve a \"high 
democratic ranking\" and protect democracy from violence in 
the run-up to the April parliamentary elections.  According 
to al-Thawra, the official ROYG daily, the basic principles 
of the \"national ranking document\" which came from President 
Saleh\'s letter to the political parties were as follows: 
 
-- commitment to \"national continuities,\" foremost the 
constitution and laws; 
 
-- maintenance of the democratic trend and embodying the 
principle of peaceful transfer of power; 
 
-- adherence to the rules and ethics of peaceful democratic 
practices and avoiding all forms of violence; 
 
-- keenness for making the unity, independence and 
sovereignty of the homeland the common denominator between 
the government and the opposition. 
 
3,  (U)  The political parties have publicly expressed 
appreciation for the initiative.  The meeting approved the 
formation of a committee.  The independent newspaper al-Ayyam 
on February 3 reported that the committee is headed by 
Presidential Advisor Dr. Abdel Karim al-Iryani and includes 
GPC Political Director Dr. Mohamed Qubati, Islah Shura 
Council Chairman Sheikh Zindani, YSP Assistant Secretary 
General Dr. Saif Sael, Nasserite Unionist Party Secretary 
General Abdul-Malik al-Makhlafy and Deputy Speaker of 
Parliament and Arab Baath Party Secretary General Dr. 
Abdul-Wahab Mahmoud. 
 
4.  (C)  The selection of Sheikh Zindani as representative of 
the Islah party has generated controversy, as he is the 
well-known leader of the more extremist Salafi wing of Islah. 
 According to Islah party contacts as reported by NDI, the 
Islah party did not want Zindani as its representative and 
had asked for its Assistant Secretary General Abdul-Wahab 
al-Ansi to be its representative.  President Saleh insisted 
on Zindani\'s participation, and according to contacts chose 
the entire committee personally.  Dr. Iryani told the 
Ambassador February 4 that Zindani had been reluctant to be 
part of the committee, but had earlier approached the 
President about how to avoid violence in the election 
campaign so Saleh insisted.  Moderate Islah party contacts 
believe that Zindani\'s appointment is a power move by Saleh 
to either 1)  create a split between the moderate and 
extremist wings of Islah to hurt its chances in the election, 
2)  highlight the party\'s more extreme elements to discredit 
the party in regards to the public and the West and United 
States or 3)  create problems between the opposition parties 
that are part of the Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) by his 
presence, causing a split that weakens the opposition. 
 
5.  (C)  This Code of Conduct (Arabic:  \"mithaq al-sharaf,\" 
also translated as Code or Compact of Honor) has preempted 
ongoing efforts by international organizations, particularly 
IFES, to establish a written Code of Conduct for the 
elections to prevent violence and promote free and fair 
campaigns.  In November after weeks of negotiations between 
the parties and IFES, an agreement to sign a Code of Conduct 
fell apart after the Islah party pulled out.  The Islah party 
was responding to a new implementing regulation issued by the 
Supreme Committee on Elections and Referenda (SCER) in early 
November that allowed the military to register to vote in 
places other than the location of their barracks.  Because of 
Islah party belief in and fear of military influence in the 
elections in favor of the ruling GPC, Islah pulled out of the 
Code signing in protest.  Dr. Iryani has a copy of this draft 
Code of Conduct for use in the new committee. 
 
6.  (C)  Comment:  President Saleh\'s initiative to form a 
national committee to establish a Code of Conduct to 
alleviate violence is a welcome one, particularly if formal 
mechanisms for dispute resolution are also established. 
However, the appointment of Zindani is at best problematic. 
His presence could make committee consensus harder to 
achieve, and could even provide a pretext for heavy-handed 
tactics by the ROYG to ensure its victory in the April 
elections.  End Summary.

SUBJECT: SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT SHEIKH AL AHMAR TALKS 
DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT WITH AMBASSADOR 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  Within the scope of ongoing post meetings 
with senior political figures in the run-up to the April 
parliamentary elections, the Ambassador called on Speaker of 
Parliament (and leader of the Islamist-oriented Islah Party) 
Sheikh Abdullah Hussein al-Ahmar at his home on January 30. 
In a brief, cordial and low-key meeting, conversation 
centered around democratic development, the upcoming 
elections and U.S. development assistance.  Although often 
intensely anti-American in his public rhetoric, the Sheikh on 
this occasion assiduously avoided contentious subjects such 
as Iraq, the Palestinian issue, U.S.-Yemen counterterrorism 
cooperation or the arrest of Islah party Shura Council member 
al-Moayed in Germany.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Along with Ambassador Hull and Sheikh al-Ahmar, the 
1/30 meeting included Hamid al-Ahmar (son of Sheikh Abdullah, 
Member of Parliament and prominent businessman) and 
Abduleqawe al-Qaisi, Director of the Office of the Speaker, 
as well as DCM and Acting Pol/Econ Chief (notetaker). 
Discussion took place entirely in Arabic. 
 
--------- 
Democracy 
--------- 
 
3.  (C)  Sheikh al-Ahmar expressed concerns about the ROYG 
and ruling General People\'s Congress (GPC) using the 
advantages of incumbency, particularly the media, to 
influence the outcome of the April elections and marginalize 
the opposition.  He said the GPC planned to take \"all\" the 
seats. and made a point of contrasting Western democracies 
and their often close races with leaders in the Middle East 
and their desire to get all the votes possible.  The sheikh 
laughed and acknowledged reference to Saddam\'s 100 percent 
victory as a typical example, but did not take this opening 
for any further discussion of Iraq.  Al-Ahmar expressed 
concern about possible violence in the April elections, and 
the Ambassador agreed that all must be done to prevent it. 
The Ambassador made a point about the importance of ensuring 
enough women candidates in the election, and the Sheikh 
agreed and said that women candidates are taking part. 
 
----------- 
Development 
----------- 
 
4.  (C)  The Sheikh was receptive and positive in response to 
the Ambassador\'s briefing of USG development activities and 
the return of USAID.  He noted that health and education 
programs in deprived rural areas were especially important. 
Al-Ahmar added that he believed military assistance was not 
really important and that it should play a secondary role in 
U.S. relations with Yemen and other countries in the region. 
The Sheikh complained that none of the countries in the 
region had external enemies to arm against, but still 
emphasized military build-up rather than development simply 
in order to repress their own people. 
 
5.  (C)  The Sheikh said that he and President Saleh would go 
on the Hajj together. 
 
6.  (C)  Comment:  It is striking that Sheikh al-Ahmar 
avoided even passing reference to any contentious issue in 
this latest meeting with Ambassador Hull.  While he is 
renowned for the venomous anti-U.S. quality of his public 
remarks, he made no mention of Palestine, Iraq or the arrest 
of Sheikh al-Moayed in Germany.  When hewing to the high 
road, as on this occasion, al-Ahmar strikes a convincing pose 
as an advocate of democracy and government accountability. 
Unfortunately the high road is seldom his chosen route.  His 
party\'s public announcement, several days after this meeting, 
that Islah would field no female candidates and opposed the 
inclusion of women candidates in the parliamentary elections 
-- his contrary remarks to the Ambassador notwithstanding -- 
was an all-too-typical example of his tendency to play to the 
lowest, most exploitative common denominator of Islamic 
rectitude in order to stir and sustain the fervor of his 
constituents.

1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary: The Charge convened an EAC meeting 
on February 9 to assess recent threat information and discuss 
security-related issues, including alleged terrorist food 
poisoning, enhanced personal security awareness and obstacles 
to Chem/Bio training.  Also mentioned was EAP readiness and 
the need to prepare for a future conflict in Iraq.  Key 
offices and personnel represented at the meeting included: 
CHG, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, ORCA, OMC, SOC YEMEN, 
RMO, FPD AND FBI.  End summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  The Charge opened the meeting with a briefing on 
the latest Department worldwide advisory, highlighting the 
possibility for further al-Qaeda attacks in the Arabian Gulf. 
 Specifically mentioned was the possibility of poisoned food 
supplies.  AdminOff will investigate the food procurement 
process and suggested tasking the Regional Security Office\'s 
(RSO) Surveillance Detection team to observe Post food 
deliveries.  FPD Chief volunteered to work with the RSO to 
conduct criminal investigations of potential food supply 
poisoning. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  ORCA Chief described a developing rift between 
two very high-ranking al-Qaeda operatives, explaining that 
one individual continues to seek long range planning of 
attacks against economic targets, while the other wants to 
execute small, multiple, random acts of violence.  ORCA Chief 
advised of the need for continued personal security 
vigilance, especially if the latter strategy proves to become 
al-Qaeda\'s favored modus operandi.  The Consul added that she 
will emphasize the need for unofficial Americans in Yemen to 
employ the same personal security measures currently 
practiced by Embassy officials during the upcoming February 
10 warden meeting. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  The Charge stated that a Department Chem/Bio 
training team had been scheduled to arrive Post on February 
10, but the visit was postponed because escape masks to be 
used for training are being held up at the Republic of Yemen 
Government (ROYG) Customs warehouse (see reftel).  The Charge 
assigned the ORCA Chief to relay to the Political Security 
Organization Chief that holding these masks is an extremely 
serious act that could have grave repercussions for future 
U.S. - ROYG intelligence cooperation. 
 
5. (S/NF)  RSO notified the EAC that Emergency Action Plan 
(EAP) chapters are ready for dissemination to appropriate 
offices for input and clearance.  February 24 is the target

maker. Participants enjoyed the study case immensely as it 
touched on the most important issue women face when 
participating in politics, which is the resistance women 
face and the limited social settings for women to express 
and participate with men in discussion and decision-making. 
 
8. (U) Outcome: Strengths 
 
      Workshops reached 300 women in five governorates and 
     received attention from officials and civil society. 
    Some of the speakers were women local council members 
which gave participants opportunity to listen to their 
experiences and get first hand information of women\'s 
experience in the public and political life. 
    Several district local council members in each 
governorate attended the workshop and benefited from the 
subjects presented and the discussions. 
    Participants\' evaluations of the workshops were very 
positive. Participants acknowledged their dire need to these 
workshops at the governorate levels and the knowledge they 
gain from them as they touch upon very important and current 
women issues. 
    Participation of officials in the workshops showed the 
government\'s support for women empowerment and development. 
    WIDA\'s capacity and efficiency in conducting the 
program in five governorates was evident in the 
participants\' evaluation of the workshops, media coverage 
and visual and written documentation of the program. 
 
9. (U) Outcome: Weaknesses 
 
      In Taiz governorate, the workshop faced resistance from 
     some officials. However, the workshop was well received 
     among the community. 
    In Lahaj, the general secretary was assigned to present 
a paper. But the paper was presented by someone else which 
made discussion of paper subject useless since the general 
secretary was not present to respond. 
 
SIPDIS 
    In Mahweet, participants were less outspoken as the 
area is still conservative and requires more awareness 
programs and advocacy in regards to women participation.

REFS: A) STATE 187026 B) SANAA5295 
 
1. (U) Summary : The Civic Democratic Initiatives Foundation 
(CDF) conducted the \"Democratic Initiatives Enhancement 
Program: Voter Registration Education Project\". It was a 
media project campaign aimed to inform the people that their 
old voter registration cards were no longer valid and 
encouraged them to participate in the new registration. The 
project has also raised awareness of targeted groups about 
the importance of their registration in the coming 
parliament election and to encourage male support for 
women\'s registration. The campaign used radio, newspapers 
and pamphlets, which were distributed to community local 
leaders. This media project was based on three studies 
conducted in preparation for a voter registration education 
program. CDF conducted fourteen-week voter registration 
education media campaign and a series of voter education 
workshops from August to October 2002. 
 
2. (U) Media Campaign: CDF designed the program for 
awareness-raising to have multiple strategies. For example 
this program used national and local radio, newspapers and, 
in the second component, direct contact with local council, 
tribal, and religious leaders. 
Each of the two activities targeted a particular audience. 
The radio drama and comedy episodes\' main audiences were 
rural women. For maximum outreach, each episode was 
broadcast three times during the weekend twice each day. 
Newspaper advertisements targeted the educated population of 
major and secondary cities, thereby reinforcing at the 
governorate levels the radio programs. The ads advised 
readers that their old cards are invalid and urge support 
for full family registration. 
 
3. (U) Radio Drama and Comedy Series Broadcasting: CDF 
assisted six radio stations to produce a series of four 
episodes. Each episode broadcast twice a day, three times a 
week which made it clear that the old registration cards 
were no longer valid and it stressed the importance of all 
sectors of the community registering for the coming election 
(targeting all Yemenis 18 and older with particular 
attention to rural Yemeni and women). CDF used the most 
popular radio program such as Kalam Fi al-Samim in 
Hadramout, Ma Yesah Ela Asahieh in Aden, kalam Mozon in 
Hodeidah, etc. Each station provided CDF with an evaluation 
and impact assessment at the end of the project. These 
indicated that the message of the project reached audiences. 
All programs were broadcast in local dialects within the 
context of drama or comedy, therefore reaching the target 
audience, particularly the illiterate ones. 
 
4. (U) Newspaper Announcements and Articles: Twelve weekly 
newspapers carried three-inch two-line announcements during 
August.  Some ads were accompanied by articles. The total 
newspaper run was 114 weekly and 70 daily announcements and 
more than 18 articles. The ads had slightly different 
messages each week in order to attract more attention. The 
articles carried the message that the old registration is no 
longer valid, and motivated readers to encourage all family 
members, in the rural or urban areas, to register. 
 
5. (U) Community Leaders Pamphlet: 50,000 copies of the 
pamphlet were printed and distributed all over the country 
through local councils and CDF volunteer network for 
official and traditional community leaders including 6,664 
district level local council members and tribal and 
religious leaders. The pamphlets covered areas where no 
radio or TV transmissions are available.  The pamphlet 
conveyed the message that the old cards are no longer valid 
and provides information on the election terminology for the 
new registration with reference to the election law. 
 
6. (U) Outcome:  Project\'s positive impact was more than 
expected probably because it was one of only two projects 
addressing the voter registration issue early on. CDF was 
aware that registration is not enough; therefore, this 
project worked on voter education to encourage Yemeni 
voters, especially females, to vote in the 27 April 2003 
elections. The project used voters\' education in the general 
context of comedy, drama and explanatory newspaper articles 
instead of plain direct educational statements. The main 
target audience for the project were villagers and women, 
groups which historically receive the least attention from 
media and public awareness programs.

1.  (C)  Summary:  The Iraq situation and the recent Arab 
League ministerial were discussed when the Ambassador called 
on Foreign Minister Qirbi on February 18.  Notably, according 
to Qirbi the Yemenis and other Arab countries did not buy 
into the French proposals on inspections, despite their 
appreciation for the French and German stances against 
military action.  Yemen\'s missile cooperation with North 
Korea and other matters were also discussed during the 
meeting (septels).  Also present at the meeting were MFA 
Advisor al-Iryani, DCM, DATT and Acting Pol/Econ Chief 
(notetaker).  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)   While giving the Foreign Minister a readout of his 
recent Washington consultations, the Ambassador said that 
there is total commitment on the part of the USG that Iraq 
must disarm.  He also noted that there is a preference for 
working through the UNSC and the international community, but 
that at the end of the day Iraq must disarm. 
 
3.  (C)  Qirbi gave a readout of the recent Cairo meeting of 
Arab League foreign ministers.  He said that they heard from 
the Saudis, the Syrians, the Iraqis, and that there is 
\"nothing new\" as far as the sequence of events is concerned. 
He said that the \"striking issue\" was the degree of Iraqi 
cooperation and its stated commitment to answer questions 
from the inspectors and eliminate WMD.  Qirbi opined that 
what Iraq said may or may not be correct, but if it is 
correct, they are moving in the right direction. 
 
4.  (C)  Qirbi said that the Arab delegations urged Iraq to 
\"abide by and implement\" UNSCR 1441 in its entirety.  He 
noted that there was unanimous opposition to military action 
unless all peaceful means of resolving the problem are 
exhausted.  He said that until there is a clear statement 
from the inspectors that Iraq is not cooperating, those 
peaceful means remain open.  However, he mentioned the 
possibility that time limits might be imposed. 
 
5.  (C)  Qirbi said the French and German positions against 
military action were appreciated, but that the ROYG and most 
Arab states do not/not agree with their proposals regarding 
inspectors.  He suggested that the Arab delegations are 
mindful of not taking advantage of the split between the 
French and German governments and the U.S. and other European 
governments.  Rather, the Arab position would be to pressure 
Iraq toward an outcome acceptable to both France and the 
U.S., meaning both no war and complete disarmament. 
 
6.  (C)  The Ambassador said it was useful for the AL member 
states to be clear on Iraq\'s responsibilities to disarm.  The 
Ambassador mentioned specifics from Secretary Powell\'s 
February 14 UNSC speech, and noted that time will tell if 
Iraq does decide to change its course and disarm.  Qirbi said 
that the U.S. has a major responsibility to support the 
inspectors (read: through intelligence provision). 
 
7.  (C)  Ambassador Hull stressed the need to sustain 
pressure on Baghdad.  Even Iraq\'s recent participation in the 
Tripartite Committee on Gulf War missing was solely the 
result of international pressure, as Iraq had long boycotted 
the meetings.  Still, Iraq refuses to account for Kuwaiti 
missing.  Saddam Hussein responds to pressure and nothing 
else, said the Ambassador.  Qirbi nodded in agreement, 
acknowledging that Yemen\'s own diplomatic efforts to resolve 
this problem were fruitless as a result of Iraqi 
intransigence. 
 
8.  (C)  FM Qirbi agreed that all should continue to pressure 
Iraq, but added that pressure needs to also be placed on the 
U.S. and its allies not to be hasty in the use of military 
force. 
 
9.  (C)  Comment:  It is notable that the Yemenis and other 
Arab states did not buy the French proposal on inspections. 
The French Ambassador told Ambassador Hull on February 17 
that Paris had tasked him with demarching on the proposals 
throughout the Eid holiday.  Apparently his efforts did not 
influence the Yemeni position.  End Comment.

1.  (C)  Summary:  The Ambassador briefed the Foreign 
Minister on his recent Washington consultations at a meeting 
on February 18.  He detailed current and potential USG 
assistance in several areas and brought up the pouch issue 
for closure.  FM Qirbi expressed appreciation for continued 
U.S.-Yemen cooperation in all areas.  The Ambassador and FM 
also discussed Yemen\'s assurances on Yemen-North Korea 
missile cooperation and the Iraq situation (septels). 
Yemen\'s leading daily Al-Thawra carried a factual front-page 
account of the meeting February 19.  End Summary. 
 
-------------- 
USG Assistance 
-------------- 
 
2.  (C)  The Ambassador briefed Qirbi on several areas on USG 
assistance, including possible budget allocations for 
security and economic assistance, prospects for food aid and 
Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) assistance, current 
democratic development assistance and Yemen\'s candidacy for 
inclusion in the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA). 
 
3.  (C)  The Ambassador noted that Yemen and Morocco are the 
two leading countries from the Middle East for consideration 
in the MCA, but cautioned Qirbi not to be too hopeful in the 
near term.  While Yemen is well-positioned in many areas such 
as political reform, fiscal responsibility and health and 
education expenditures, there is more work to be done.  The 
ROYG, the USG and the World Bank should work together to make 
sure that needed reforms are undertaken.  Qirbi agreed on the 
vital importance of working together to ensure Yemen remains 
a leading candidate.  He noted that even with elections 
looming, the ROYG could develop a reform agenda now that 
includes steps relevant to the MCA. 
 
4.  (C)  Qirbi said it was encouraging to hear good news on 
the assistance front, and said it was a result of good 
cooperation and a frequent exchange of views. 
 
---------------------- 
Pouch and Escape Masks 
---------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Qirbi said that he had still been unable to finalize 
the pouch issue with PSO Chief Gamish because both had been 
traveling at different times.  He undertook to speak to 
Gamish before leaving for a Malaysia trip on February 19. 
Qirbi assured the Ambassador that he had been told that the 
escape masks stuck in Customs were being released today 
(February 18).  However, post has not yet received the masks 
as of late afternoon.

6.  (U)  Qirbi agreed to pass on President Bush\'s letter to 
President Saleh thanking him for Saleh\'s condolences on the 
Space Shuttle tragedy (ref).

REF: STATE 36950 
 
Classified By: Political/Economic Officer Willeah E. Cato for Reasons 1 
.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  Yemen has taken significant steps to 
restrict the number of Man Portable Air Defense Systems 
(MANPADS) available to civilians.  The ROYG has invested an 
estimated $30 million in a weapons buy-back program designed 
to remove MANPADS, RPGs, and other weapons from the civilian 
arms market.  While ROYG commitment appears firm, post is 
following up with Yemen\'s Defense Ministry to address key 
questions -- including availability of resources to sustain 
the buy-back effort.  U.S. assistance could be important in 
that regard.  End summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  The ROYG clearly shares USG concerns on the 
control of MANPADS and is actively trying to remove stocks 
available to the civilian population.  Particularly after the 
unsuccessful September 2002 shooting attack on a Hunt Oil 
helicopter and the al-Qaeda attempt to shot down an Israeli 
airliner in Kenya, ROYG is sensitive to the danger of a 
MANPADS attack. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  During the 1994 civil war a variety of heavy 
weapons (antitank and MANPADS), especially those from the 
former Soviet Union, were available to the general population 
in large quantities.  With the war\'s conclusion and the 
government\'s assumption of central control, many of these 
weapons (estimated in the tens of thousands) remained 
unaccounted for.  Countless weapons, including MANPADS, were 
readily available from weapons souks and rural villages where 
tribal leaders have amassed small arsenals.  These stockpiles 
included Strellas and Grails from Russia and the former East 
bloc. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Today, both government forces and certain 
civilian (especially tribal) elements are in possession of 
MANPADS.  MANPADS in military control are kept in armed 
forces storage facilities under the direct supervision of a 
line commander.  Yemen\'s civilian population overall is 
heavily armed, and ROYG\'s reach, although strong in Sanaa, 
remains limited in many rural areas.  Nevertheless increased 
government regulation and the weapons buy-back program are 
making a difference.  New procedures are in place for 
controlling the sale of MANPADS from weapons souks under 
which arms dealers/purchasers must obtain a license from the 
central government in order to handle MANPADS.  The objective 
of these ROYG programs is to remove MANPADS from the civilian 
market wherever they are found. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  At ROYG invitation, in late January 2003 
Ambassador and DATT viewed a representative sample of 18 
months of collection efforts from five collection sites. 
This sample alone included over 1000 MANPADS (Stellas and 
Grails) -- clear evidence of the substantive and 
unprecedented action being taken by the ROYG.  By eliminating 
key weapons systems from the arms souks, ROYG reduces the 
quantity available to potential terrorists. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  Post is actively following implementation of the 
buy-back program with the Ministry of Defense, as underscored 
in our Mission Performance Plan.  Many important questions 
remain to be answered regarding the program\'s overall impact. 
 The number of MANPADS in private hands (i.e. outside the 
scope of arms bazaars) is unknown, for example, as is the 
extent of ongoing movement of MANPADS into/out of Yemen. 
While ROYG commitment appears firm, the effectiveness of 
enforcement and availability of resources sufficient to 
sustain the buy-back program can only be answered over time. 
However, the buy-back program could be a good investment of 
U.S. funds, both to ensure the program\'s continuation, and to 
reiterate the strength of U.S.-Yemen cooperation.

SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING - 23 FEBRUARY 2003 
 
Classified By: RSO Tim Laas, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary: The Ambassador convened an EAC 
meeting on February 23 to assess recent threat information 
and discuss security-related issues.  Also mentioned was EAP 
readiness and the need to prepare for a future conflict in 
Iraq.  Key offices and personnel represented at the meeting 
included: CHG, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, ORCA, OMC, SOC 
YEMEN, RMO, FPD AND FBI.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  The EAC began their discussion with a review of the 
threat environment in light of the shooting of a British 
defense contractor in Saudi Arabia.  EAC members noted that a 
similar scenario could play out in Yemen.  Accordingly, the 
EAC agreed that Mission personnel should again be urged to 
vary their times and routes and avoid a predictable pattern 
in any other way. 
 
3.  (C)  The EAC discussed the fact that the British Embassy 
in Sanaa had drawn down to the to a minimal staff working out 
of the Ambassador\'s residence.  According to the DCM this was 
a pattern for British missions throughout the region, but 
also reflected the British concern that their Chancery was 
vulnerable because it lacked adequate standoff. 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  The EAC noted that the U.S. mission granted 
authorized departures for Embassy staff in Kuwait, Saudi 
Arabia, Beirut, Syria, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem.  The Ambassador 
asked the EAC if any members thought that American Embassy 
Sanaa should consider requesting such a departure status at 
this time.  The EAC unanimously recommended not requesting 
authorized departure status at this time because the past has 
been at high security alert for some time and has procedures 
in place to manage the existing threat. 
 
5.  (SBU)  EAC members were briefed about the large number of 
FSN and Direct Hire American staff that had opted to receive 
the Smallpox vaccination following excellent briefings 
provided by a TDY State Department medical team in Sanaa. 
The Ambassador noted that the likelihood of a biological 
attack in Sanaa remained small but the potential existed for 
someone regionally to become infected before traveling to 
Yemen at which time he/she might expose inhabitants in Yemen 
to the virus.  The RMO discussed the fact that Anthrax 
inoculations would follow smallpox vaccinations at an 
unspecified time in the future. 
 
6.  (SBU)  The Administrative Officer briefed the EAC that 
Escape Masks being held by ROYG customs would be released 
shortly.  The RSO noted that a training team was scheduled to 
train Embassy personnel beginning on March 10, 2003.  (Note 
the masks were in fact released to the Embassy on February 
24.) 
 
7.  (U)  The DCM briefed EAC members on the success of First 
Responder Training recently provided by the RMO. 
 
8.  (U)  The RSO informed the EAC team that the EAP had been 
finalized by TDY RSO Nick Mariano and was ready for EAC 
Chairman review and approval before send-out. 
 
9.  (U)  The DCM reminded EAC members about the newly updated 
phone tree to be used in the event of a crisis. 
 
10. (SBU)  The DCM invited SOC-Yemen and other EAC members to 
review and provide input into the recently revised Drawdown 
List updated by the DCM, ADMOFF, COMSOFF and RSO. 
 
11. (SBU)  EAC members reviewed tentative \"Hunker Down\" 
Guidelines in the event of hostilities between the U.S. led 
coalition and Iraq.  Subjects covered included: 
 
     Sleeping Arrangements 
     FSN Access 
     Cafeteria 
     Reminder to bring overnight bag to office NOW 
     Have cash on hand 
     Update POA as necessary 
 
12. (SBU)  The EAC noted the success of a Safe Haven Drill 
administered by the RSO on 20 February at 0900 hours with the 
entire Embassy staff. 
 
13. (SBU)  The RSO noted that a Destruction Drill would be 
held on February 25, 2003.  The DCM reminded EAC members of 
the importance of keeping burn times to less than 1 hour in 
each section. 
14. (SBU)  The ADMINOFF reviewed post mail handling 
guidelines formulated to avoid the risk of Chancery 
contamination in case of any future white powder incidents.

SUBJECT: 2002 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT FOR YEMEN MUST BE CREDIBLE 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  The Human Rights Report is a vital tool in 
Post\'s efforts to improve human rights in Yemen, and its 
credibility is central to that effort.  The draft 2002 Human 
Rights Report for Yemen is in danger of a damaging lack of 
credibility unless the report reflects the facts more 
accurately.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  The Human Rights Report (HRR) is taken seriously in 
Yemen, both by the government and the public.  In the last 
couple of years, it was translated and published in several 
newspapers in its entirety.  Several conferences were held, 
and the ROYG published a point-by-point response to the 2001 
report in both Arabic and English newspapers. 
 
3.  (C)  Post\'s experience is that the HRR is the best tool 
available in encouraging improvements in Yemen\'s human 
rights.  Progress was made in several areas over the last few 
years, at least in part because of the HRR and Post\'s 
engagement on the issue.  For example, Post has witnessed a 
marked improvement in the treatment of detainees and 
prisoners by the Political Security Organization (PSO), in 
part due to highlighting abuse in past HRRs and training 
their forces in human rights during counter-terrorism 
training.  Citizens\' ability to change their government has 
also improved over the last few years, with the establishment 
of local government and more widespread competition between 
political parties. 
 
4.  (C)  Because of the importance of the HRR tool in 
pressing the ROYG for changes in its human rights practices, 
the HRR must be strongly credible or the chance for change is 
diminished.  There are several areas of the draft 2002 report 
where credibility is in danger, including the following: 
 
--    Terrorist suspects detained by the ROYG at U.S. 
government request:  Post suggests an acknowledgment be made 
by using phrasing that alludes to \"partners in the war on 
terrorism.\" 
 
--    Prosecution of the USS Cole detainees was delayed at 
U.S. government request to allow time for investigation: 
Post suggests language that alludes to \"international law 
enforcement partners\" in explaining why detainees were held 
beyond normal time limits. 
 
--    Yemeni security forces did not kill persons this year 
in an unlawful or extrajudicial manner.  All instances of 
death by security forces in the draft report came about 
during legitimate law enforcement activities pursuing 
terrorists, including the November 3 attack on al-Qaeda. 
Post suggests that the language \"Members of the security 
forces killed a number of persons during the year\" be changed 
to \"There were no reports of arbitrary or unlawful 
deprivation of life committed by the Government or its 
agents.\" 
 
5.  (C)  In President Bush\'s State of the Union address, the 
predator attack on November 3 against al-Qaeda was 
highlighted as a significant success in the war on terror. 
It is inconsistent that a report from the Department of State 
would indicate that the same killing is extrajudicial or 
unlawful.

SUBJECT: IRAQ:  EVOLVING YEMENI ATTITUDES TOWARD A POSSIBLE 
WAR 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Acting Chief Catherine J. Westley for Reason 1. 
5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  ROYG policy and Yemeni street opinion 
publicly oppose a war in Iraq, but the underlying reality is 
more nuanced.  The public line articulated by Saleh and 
senior officials strongly denounces war and advocates 
concerted Arab action to prevent it, but includes no/no 
expression of support or sympathy for Saddam Hussein.  Most 
Yemenis remain more concerned with day-to-day matters, 
including the poor economy and the upcoming parliamentary 
elections, and numerous contacts have expressed support for 
removing the Baathi regime if/if this is accomplished with 
minimal impact on civilians.  UNSC-related diplomacy which 
has received dramatic coverage in the West has received 
minimal public and media attention in Yemen.  Nevertheless, 
popular reaction could be vehement and emotional if war 
seemed to drag on, or if Iraqi civilians were killed in a 
high-profile incident.  Contacts almost universally express 
hope that the war will be finished quickly.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)   Media statements from ROYG leaders continue to 
oppose war in Iraq.  President Saleh has used domestic media 
to maintain a high public profile out of the Non-Aligned 
Movement Summit in Malaysia, saying that the NAM meeting and 
the upcoming Arab Summit \"should not be merely a verbal 
phenomenon that repeats words of condemnation and 
denunciation.\"  An editorial this week in the official daily 
al-Thawra said, \"Iraq will be the first field of 
confrontation and it is the real test for the capability of 
the Arabs and Muslims to defend themselves.\"  At the same 
time, opposition to war is couched in terms of support for 
the Iraqi people and not Saddam or the Baathi regime. 
Numerous influential Yemeni contacts told the Ambassador this 
week that the removal of Saddam will be good for the region. 
Several predicted that only significant civilian casualties 
would elicit a vehement popular reaction in Yemen. 
 
3.  (S)  Powerful military commander of the northern region 
Ali Muhsen Saleh al-Ahmar recently told the DATT that the 
Arab people would prefer no war, but the main concern was 
about how the \"American occupation\" would be viewed.  He also 
said that there could be flashpoints of reaction here in 
Yemen, but expressed confidence that the ROYG could handle 
it. 
 
4,  (C)  An official in the President\'s office told 
Pol/Econoff that he wished the war would be over with 
quickly, and that if must happen it should happen now without 
further delays.  This sentiment was echoed to Acting Pol/Econ 
Chief by a leading NGO human rights activist who said \"get it 
over with already.\"  Several journalist contacts expressed 
suspicion about American motives in going to war and echoed a 
familiar line in regional media: that the timing of the 
Middle East Partnership Initiative announcement in December 
created questions in Arab minds about what America is \"really 
trying to do\" in this region. 
 
5.  (U)  At the same time, opposition media hype has been 
fairly low-key in recent days.  For example, out of three 
weekly opposition newspapers, only one contained an article 
on Iraq, noting matter-of-factly that a small anti-war 
demonstration was held in Taiz. UNSC diplomacy and the 
prospect of a new UNSCR has received understated media 
attention in Yemen (far less than the President\'s daily 
statements on Iraq), and even contacts firmly opposed to war 
do not see efforts by France et al. in the Council as likely 
to forestall conflict. 
 
6.  (C)  Yemeni public reaction is opposed to a possible war; 
 however, the vehemence of opposition is not as acute as 
concern for internal Yemeni matters and the Palestinian 
issue.  With parliamentary elections coming in two months\' 
time and a worsening economy, many Yemenis are more concerned 
with how to feed their families. 
 
7.  (C)  Comment:  President Saleh and other government 
leaders are playing up their opposition rhetoric, partially 
as a means to keep the \"street\" in line.  However, the 
underlying reality in Yemen is a studied balance of support 
for the Iraqi people and conspicuous non-support for Saddam. 
Those Embassy contacts who urge a quick end to a war they see 
as inevitable appear to be fatigued by the limbo imposed by 
the last several months\' wait, and perhaps concerned about 
what a prolonged war would mean for internal Yemeni issues 
like the parliamentary elections.  End Comment.

1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened an 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC) meeting on March 2 to assess 
threat information and discuss contingency planning for a 
possible conflict with Iraq and other security-related 
matters.  Key offices and personnel represented at the 
meeting included: AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, 
ORCA, OMC, SOC YEMEN, RMO, FPD AND FBI.  End summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Current Threat Assessment 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  EAC discussed the current threat environment, 
concluding that nothing new had come up to change the threat 
assessment.  EAC discussed the arrest of senior al-Qaeda 
leader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Pakistan, noting that it 
could hinder attacks in Yemen if he provides information and 
if al-Qaeda lies low following the arrest.  The possibility 
of shooting attacks against motorists in light of recent 
attacks in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait was reiterated, with a 
reminder that Mission personnel should continue to exercise 
caution by varying times and routes, being unpredictable, and 
making maximum use of armored Embassy vehicles. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Warden Meeting Scheduled for March 3 
------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C)  EAC discussed the timeliness of the Warden meeting 
scheduled for March 3 as part of the Embassy\'s regular 
communication with the American community.  Other scheduled 
contingency consultations include:  DCM meetings with the 
Local Guard Force to discuss perimeter security (especially 
after the recent Karachi attack);  RSO contacts with all U.S. 
Fulbright students in country;  DCM meeting with spouses of 
U.S. employees;  RSO meeting with Amideast deputy director; 
and RSO follow-up at the Yemeni-American Language Institute. 
EAC members have heard increased questions from the larger 
expatriate community about what they should do in light of a 
possible war in Iraq and the drawdowns of British, Dutch and 
German Embassy staff. 
 
------------------------------ 
Securing International Schools 
------------------------------ 
 
4,  (C)  RSO briefed the EAC on efforts to secure 
international schools, including the Ambassador\'s 2/26 
meeting with the Ministry of Interior.  On the basis of 
Ambassador\'s proposal to the Minister of a security 
partnership -- in which the schools will take certain 
unilateral security steps and the ROYG will provide a static 
security presence at school sites during school hours plus 
mobile response teams around the clock -- follow-up is 
underway.  A group of representatives from the international 
schools and several embassies (including Embassy Sanaa RSO) 
met with Interior officials 2/27 to discuss what the schools 
must do and what the ROYG could provide in terms of extra 
protection.  The group is developing a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) for the ROYG that it hopes will help 
facilitate security assistance, including police escorts, 
concrete barriers and improved communications.  Embassy Sanaa 
is a leading participant in this effort. 
 
----------------------- 
Other Mission Drawdowns 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  EAC discussed drawdowns of other Embassies (notably 
Dutch, British and German) and international organizations in 
Yemen, including the UN.  RSO reported that the UN in Sanaa 
is preparing a report for New York to recommend that 
facilitation of the departure of more than 130 family members 
if necessary.  Several other small missions, including 
French, Japanese and Italian, are standing fast.  DCM 
reported that at the USG authorized departure posts in the 
region approximately 50% of dependents have left post. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Vaccinations and Disaster Response 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  EAC discussed the 2/23-25 smallpox immunization 
program, noting that only one person had fallen ill after the 
shot and that it could not be definitively traced to the 
vaccine.  The person is now healthy.  The RMO also discussed 
the future anthrax vaccinations and the possibility that the 
vaccines thought to be spoiled might be usable, pending the 
Department\'s analysis.  RMO briefed the EAC on disaster 
response discussions with ROYG officials, including the 
Minister of Health.  Yemeni authorities have the ability to 
analyze suspect powder and determine if it is/is not anthrax, 
but were generally pessimistic about their other CBW response 
abilities and requested assistance from the Embassy. 
 
7.  (SBU)  RMO briefed EAC on the ongoing First Responder 
training, and noted upcoming training in bio-chemical 
response to include CBW escape mask training on March 10 with 
a visiting expert team. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Contingency Preparation:  \"StandFast\" and \"MoveSafe\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8.  (C)  DCM briefed the EAC on the guidelines for Embassy 
response to a possible Iraq contingency that would require a 
temporary closure and reduced or modified Embassy staffing. 
 
9.  (C)  A declaration of StandFast would entail immediate 
closure of the Embassy and curtailment of all but essential 
operations.  American staff performing essential functions 
would reside in the Embassy or the Alternate Command Center, 
while all other staff will remain in their residences.  DCM 
circulated a classified staff list designating each 
employee\'s StandFast location.  The Embassy would be closed 
to the public, with no vehicle traffic in or out except for 
essential operational travel (e.g., to/from ROYG ministries 
authorized by the Chief of Mission).  FSN staff performing 
essential functions would be admitted to the Embassy on the 
basis of an Access List updated daily by the RSO. 
 
10.  (U)  A declaration of MoveSafe would entail a less 
restrictive limitation on the movement of American personnel 
outside their residences or the Embassy compound.  Embassy 
operations may be shut down or curtailed to a limited degree 
if designated by the COM.  Travel would be allowed only in 
armored vehicles.  Non-essential American and FSN staff would 
be allowed access to the Embassy in accordance with the level 
of Embassy operations and the COM\'s assessment of security 
conditions. 
 
11.  (C)  DCM briefed the EAC on plans for daily situation 
reporting should hostilities occur between Iraq and coalition 
forces.  He asked that each section provide information to 
the Political/Economic section early for inclusion in a daily 
sitrep to be sent out via classified e-mail or cable by 
mid-afternoon. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Security Drills and Radio Checks 
-------------------------------- 
 
12.  (U)  RSO held an intruder drill on February 27 that 
showed some deficiencies in staff knowledge on how to 
respond.  More intruder drills will be held in the immediate

SUBJECT: GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION REACHES PARLIAMENT 
 
Classified By: Political/Economic Officer Willeah E. Cato for Reasons 1 
.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (U)  Summary:  After years of internal debate, amendments 
to Yemen\'s 1992 gun control law have received Cabinet 
approval and been referred to Parliament for final passage. 
However, the absence of official comment of late may signal 
their relegation to the bottom of the pile.  Prospects for 
adoption of an improved law may improve after the April 
elections, but action on MANPADs is likely to continue as an 
entirely separate program.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  As part of the ongoing ROYG counterterrorism 
initiative, the Yemeni Cabinet has approved a series of 
amendments designed to enable Law 40 for the year 1992 to 
regulate possession and trafficking in weapons, ammunitions, 
and fireworks more effectively.  The amendments were drafted 
during 2002 and their swift approval was due, in part, to 
increased political concern after a 2002 ROYG report to 
Parliament on terrorist operations and activities in Yemen. 
 
3.  (C)  In their current form, these amendments will, among 
other things, permit the expansion and duplication of 
programs like the Sanaani licensing initiative.  Established 
by Presidential decree in 1999, this program has notably 
increased ROYG control and supervision of weapons inside and 
transiting through the capital city of Sana\'a.  The 
implementation of such a program in other regions of concern 
would be a significant achievement for ROYG\'s 
counterterrorism efforts. 
 
4.  (C)  Before these amendments can be written into law, 
Parliament must complete a series of constitutional 
procedures.  The Cabinet has assigned oversight of the 
legislative process to both the Minister of Legal Affairs and 
the Minister of State for Parliament and Shura Affairs. 
Nevertheless, the recent absence of official comment, either 
in support of or against the legislation, may signal a 
political impasse. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  Law 40 has remained controversial 
throughout the last decade.  Although successive Ministers of 
Interior have complained about its weakness and expressed 
frustration at their inability to implement gun control 
nationwide, tribal MPs and senior officials, especially 
Parlimentary Speaker Sheikh al-Ahmar, have held any revision 
in limbo for years.  Sheikh al-Ahmar continues to publicly 
oppose amending Law 40, alluding to the possession of weapons 
as a symbol of Yemeni manhood.  Even heightened security 
concerns may thus prove insufficient to ensure its passage, 
especially preceding this April\'s parliamentary elections. 
Prospects could imporve after the elections, particularly if 
al-Ahmar is replaced with a more reform-minded Speaker.  The 
ROYG views MANPADs as a particular concern, but is likely to 
continue its well-established buy-back program as an 
initiative separate from the gun control legislation.  End 
comment.

SUBJECT: TERRORISM FINANCE: REQUEST FOR POST VIEWS ON 
DESIGNATION OF AL-AQSA FOUNDATION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 54754 
 
Classified By: AMB: EJHULL BASED ON REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Reftel\'s proposed designation, under E.O. 13224, 
of the Al-Aqsa Foundation branch in Yemen involves important 
U.S. interests in the global war on terrorism and potentially 
as well US-Yemeni cooperation in that war.  From vantage of 
Embassy Sanaa, our highest priorities at the moment are: (a) 
building a strong bilateral USG-ROYG counter-terrorism 
structure to deal with remaining Al-Qa\'ida HVTs in Yemen 
(ORCA has a specific proposal now pending with the PSO); (b) 
following up on the arrest of Al-Moayad and turning off 
illicit Al-Aqsa Foundation activities; and (c) maintaining a 
stable working relationship with the Yemeni government 
through the Iraq conflict.    Following up on the arrest of 
Al-Moayad and turning off Al-Aqsa Foundation illicit 
activities in support of terrorism must be and can be done in 
a way that is compatible with our other immediate priorities. 
 
2. (S/NF) Embassy Sanaa believes that if there were an 
immediate designation of Al-Aqsa Foundation in Yemen, the 
Yemeni government (and public) would have a strongly negative 
reaction.  A public uproar would immediately ensue, 
highlighted by pro-Palestinian demonstrations orchestrated by 
the opposition Islaah party, senior leaders of which, 
including Al-Moayad, founded the local Al-Aqsa Foundation in 
the early 1990\'s.  Islaah would attempt to make political hay 
alleging American anti-Islamic and anti-Palestinian policies, 
and the government and the president\'s GPC party would be 
thrown on the defensive over the \"holy issue of Jerusalem\" 
during the last month of campaigning before Yemen\'s 
parliamentary elections April 27. None of that would be in 
U.S. interests. 
 
3. (S/NF) Our understanding is that the ROYG has kept an 
arm\'s length from Al-Aqsa Foundation activities.  It is a 
legally registered NGO put up and maintained by Islaah. 
Designation of the Al-Aqsa Foundation may, eventually, and on 
a broader basis, be a sound step to take in our efforts 
against global terrorism.  Immediate designation, in Yemen 
alone, would not be. 
 
4. (S/NF) The now public affidavit in support of the arrest 
of Sheikh Mohammed Ali Hasan Al-Moayad provides considerable 
wealth of detail to corroborate his material support and 
resources to foreign terrorist organizations Al-Qaeda and 
Hamas.  We need to prepare the ground so that the reaction by 
key ROYG officials to this information is one of 
understanding, recognition, and appreciation.  For this 
purpose, Ambassador will shortly draw to the Foreign 
Minister\'s attention key facts about Sheikh Al-Moayad\'s 
activities inimical to U.S. and Yemeni government interests, 
drawn from the publicly released affidavit.  Embassy Sanaa 
will not repeat not alert ROYG officials regarding possible 
USG steps to designate Al Aqsa Foundation.  However, it is 
essential that we initiate discreet private contacts with 
senior Yemeni officials about the public evidence against 
Al-Moayad so that they do not misunderstand USG actions 
against Al-Moayad and draw conclusions inimical to our 
interests.  It would be counter-productive for our efforts in 
this regard to also have to be fighting a public battle with 
the ROYG on Al-Aqsa designation. 
 
5. (S/NF) (S/NF) Rather than immediate designation of the 
Al-Aqsa Foundation branch in Yemen, Embassy Sanaa proposes 
that relevant USG agencies -- diplomatic, law enforcement, 
and intelligence -- assemble more information in order to 
target more broadly Al-Aqsa Foundation offices not just in 
Yemen, but elsewhere in the Middle East, Europe, and wherever 
they are located.

DEMONSTRATIONS AND ANIMOSITY ON THE RISE 
 
REF: SANAA 380 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Deputy Chief Catherine J. Westley for Reason 1. 
5 (b,d) 
 
 1.  (C)  Summary:  ROYG public and private statements 
continue voicing opposition to a possible war in Iraq 
(reftel).  The government staged peaceful demonstrations 
coinciding with the Arab Summit.  Some American contacts are 
reporting an increased sense of animosity from random Yemenis 
on the street.  End Summary. 
 
-------------- 
ROYG Attitudes 
-------------- 
 
2.  (S)  Yemeni military contacts have shown no change in 
their attitude towards Embassy interlocutors.  In fact, the 
OMC chief characterized the relationship as strong and 
unchanged by the tensions in the region.  MFA Director of 
Legal Affairs asked Pol/Econoffs March 3 why the U.S. was 
using diplomatic means to address North Korea while 
threatening war against Iraq, alleging a double standard was 
in place.  However, he agreed that Iraq must comply with UNSC 
resolutions.  He also warned that forced regime change would 
put Arab countries \"in jeopardy.\" 
 
3.  (U)  Yemeni government public statements have continued 
to be against a war on Iraq but for the implementation of 
current resolutions and the inspection process.  President 
Saleh\'s recent speeches at the Arab Summit in Sharm al Sheikh 
and at the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in 
Doha called upon the Arab countries to work together in 
rejecting war.  In Doha, Saleh said, \"launching any war 
against Iraq will create enmity between the assailant on one 
hand and the Islamic world. . .on the other.\"  At the same 
time, Saleh called for \"adhering to the peace option and for 
giving the UN inspectors ample chance to carry out their 
mission in Iraq in accordance with Resolution 1441.\" Like 
many other participants in the conference, Saleh also spoke 
at length about the Palestinian issue. 
 
----------------------- 
Peaceful Demonstrations 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (U)   Several peaceful demonstrations occurred in Sanaa 
on 2/28, 3/1. and 3/2, mostly orchestrated by the ROYG as a 
way to show support for the government\'s position on Iraq. 
All were held far from the Embassy.  Estimated at the tens of 
thousands, the crowds chanted support for the Iraqi people, 
support for the Palestinians and urged no war. 
 
5.  (U)  The Yemen Times published an editorial on the 
demonstrations on March 3 that questioned the value in 
demonstrations orchestrated by the government.  It noted the 
many government employees and busloads of schoolchildren 
brought in for the March 1 demonstration, writing that one 
child answered when asked why he/she was demonstrating, \"to 
just have fun!\"  The editorial said, \"Yemenis are against the 
war, but the government should allow people to speak for 
themselves instead of pushing them around and telling them 
what to do.  Freedom to protest does not mean taking people 
out of work.  What it means is to allow them to demonstrate 
when they want and where they want.  That is real freedom.\" 
 
----------------------------------- 
Citizen Reaction and Media Coverage 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  A few Amcits reported at the Warden Meeting March 3 
that they felt some increased tensions in the last couple of 
weeks.  The NDI representative, for example, reported that 
new participants in their political party training sessions 
were more suspicious than in the past about NDI motives, 
knowing that NDI is an American-based organization.  Another 
Amcit, a longtime resident who speaks Arabic, said that more 
Yemenis were expressing hard feelings to her recently, 
including strangers hissing under their breath at her and 
making anti-American comments in Arabic and English.  On the 
other hand, an Amcit representative of an American oil 
company reported seeing no difference in Yemeni attitudes 
towards his staff. 
 
7.  (U)  Most Yemeni press reports concentrated on reaction 
coming out of the Arab Summit and OIC meetings rather than 
developments in the UNSC such as the upcoming Blix report on 
March 7 or the draft resolution presented by the U.S., UK and 
Spain.  With President Saleh\'s official call on March 3 for 
April 27 parliamentary elections to occur on schedule, much 
attention continues to be focused inward to internal Yemeni 
matters.

TAGS: SCUL, IZ, YM 
SUBJECT: PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ON IRAQ: YEMENI IDEAS 
 
1. (SBU) I spent two days this week in Aden publicizing U.S. 
development and security projects to remind the Yemeni 
government and public of their stake in our bilateral 
relationship as we move toward conflict in Iraq.  One of my 
more interesting encounters was with the editors of Al Ayyam 
newspaper, an independent with the country\'s largest 
circulation. 
 
2. (SBU) During my visit, Al Ayyam not only featured U.S. 
development and security projects, but also showcased an 
interview with me that allowed me to put US-Iraqi policy in 
the best possible light.  I was surprised to find the 
newspaper\'s leadership strongly supportive of the US 
commitment to removing Saddam Hussein and allowing the Iraqi 
people to develop a democracy. 
 
3. (SBU) As we discussed the probable conflict, Al Ayyam\'s 
editors had some pointed suggestions for cushioning the 
impact on Yemenis and other Arabs.  They recalled photos of 
American Muslim GI\'s cleaning a mosque in Afghanistan and 
then praying in it.  They also recalled a photo of American 
Muslim soldiers praying on an aircraft carrier.  Both images, 
they said, sent strongly positive images to Muslims.  They 
also welcome President Bush\'s continuing expressions of 
respect for Islam, e.g., visits to Islamic centers, meetings 
with American Muslims, messages on Islamic occasions.  A 
third suggestion they made was to emphasize the positive 
effects of previous US military interventions in Kosovo and 
in Afghanistan on the daily lives of Muslims in those 
countries.  Our message: in Iraq, as in Kosovo and 
Afghanistan, Muslims can look forward to better lives as a 
result of US intervention. 
 
4. (SBU) I very much appreciated an opportunity to meet with 
you during the recent NEA Chief of Mission conference and 
hope the above thoughts are helpful to you as we explain our 
intervention in Iraq.

1.  (C)  Summary:  On Monday 3/10 DCM provided Foreign 
Minister al-Qirbi with a redacted copy of the U.S. complaint 
against Sheikh al-Moayed and a non-paper highlighting the 
most compelling arguments.  Qirbi commented on \"USG 
misconceptions\" regarding Moayed\'s involvement with Hamas and 
his financial transactions with a mosque in New York.  Qirbi 
also offered future ROYG assistance to clarify these and 
future \"areas of confusion\" concerning this case.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (C)  DCM Misenheimer met with Foreign Minister Abu Bakr 
al-Qirbi on March 10 and discussed the arrest of Sheikh 
Mohammed Ali al-Moayed (other topics reported septels). 
(Ambassador was traveling in Aden).  To facilitate ROYG 
access to relevant public documents, DCM presented Qirbi with 
a redacted copy of the United States District Court Eastern 
District of New York\'s complaint in support of the U.S. 
request for Moayed\'s extradition.  DCM cautioned that many 
have been surprised by the strength of this indictment, 
particularly the evidence of al-Qaida links, and noted that 
the Germans may reach a decision on the extradition of 
Mohammed Mohsen Yahya Zayed, Moayed\'s Assistant, later this 
week, and on the extradition of Moayed himself at the end of 
March. 
 
3.  (C)  Qirbi provided additional information on two issues 
ROYG considers fundamental to the U.S. case against Sheikh 
Moayed:  Moayed\'s receipt of funds from a mosque in New York 
and his involvement with Hamas.  Qirbi noted that the funds 
Moayed received from the mosque in New York were intended to 
assist him in his charity work in Yemen.  Qirbi then 
explained that in Yemen contributions to individuals and 
organizations supporting the people of Palestine, including 
Hamas, are not illegal, and Moayed should therefore be judged 
based on Yemeni, not U.S., law.  Qirbi also said that 
numerous officials, perhaps including Moayed, met with Hamas 
Undersecretary Khalid Mashal during his last trip to Yemen. 
Any such meeting was not evidence of a terrorist connection, 
argued Qirbi -- particularly since Yemeni meetings with 
Mashal were focused on convincing him to support the Middle 
East peace process.  Qirbi reiterated that ROYG and USG 
should work together to look at these issues in more detail, 
and volunteered the assistance of the Political Security 
Organization in this endeavor. 
 
4.  (C)  DCM acknowledged U.S. and Yemen disagreement on the 
designation of certain terrorist organizations, but, in light 
of the mutual designation of al-Qaeda as an illegal terrorist 
group, suggested that any future U.S.-Yemen cooperation on 
this case might focus on evidence of Moayed\'s dealings with 
al-Qaeda.  Qirbi nodded affirmatively but did not pursue the 
point. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  Since DOJ\'s March 5 press conference 
announcing the release of the complaint, media coverage of 
al-Moayed\'s arrest and public opposition have reappeared 
after a hiatus of several weeks.  The March 8 Yemeni Observer 
quoted a Yemeni official attesting to Moayed\'s innocence 
saying, \"It is illogical that a Yemeni with $20 million would 
hand it over to Osama bin Laden.\"  This official has been 
identified by a reliable embassy source as Mohammed Sudam, 
President Saleh\'s interpreter and a BBC correspondent, and 
his comment is thus likely to reflect President Saleh\'s 
personal opinion.  Al-Sahwa Net, a publication of the 
Islamist opposition party Islah, also reported that on 
Sunday, March 9 more than a thousand men from the Khawlan 
tribe participated in a sit-in in front of the Presidential 
Palace demanding President Saleh\'s intervention to seek the 
release of al-Moayed.

Current Threat Assessment 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  EAC discussed the current threat environment. 
DCM said that Sanaa is the only Embassy on the Arabian 
Peninsula not under authorized departure, primarily because 
of excellent security cooperation from the Yemeni government 
and long-standing security measures already in place.  ORCA 
briefed on recent intel relating to potential threats from 
al-Qaeda and Iraq, noting that no evidence of a new imminent 
and specific threat exists but that Sanaa continues to face a 
high potential threat. 
 
3.  (C)  Ambassador asked whether EAC members thought that 
requesting authorized departure status should be considered 
in light of the regional situation and current threat 
profile.  EAC unanimously decided that it was not warranted 
at this time.

Ongoing Security Measures and Contingency Planning

4.  (C)  EAC discussed ongoing security measures, 
consultations and contingency planning.  They include: 
 
-- DCM 3/10 discussion with Foreign Minister al-Qirbi urging 
resolution to the issues of civilian (i.e., non-diplomatic) 
license plates for embassy vehicles and facilitating entry 
into Yemen of increased numbers of armored vehicles.  Embassy 
faces ROYG restrictions on the numbers of non-diplomatic 
license plates (\"blue plates\") and armored vehicles, and is 
waiting ROYG response on pending requests.

Office, Force Protection Detachment (FPD) will conduct a 
follow-on visit to Jibla, where Americans are still working 
at the hospital, to conduct scheduled security consultations

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR VISITS ADEN 
 
 
1.    (U) Summary: Ambassador visited Aden, the financial 
capital of Yemen, March 9 to 10 to check on several U.S. 
government sponsored projects and to carry the public 
diplomacy message that, Yemeni interests are well served by a 
strong relationship with the U.S. regardless of Iraq. Locally 
based media were with the Ambassador at each stop and 
provided wide and positive coverage to the visit. Many Yemeni 
media and other contacts have commented to us favorably this 
week on the fact that the U.S. Embassy has not drawn down its 
staff and remains positively, and publicly, engaged in 
promoting development and bilateral cooperation. 
 
2.    (U) Visit with the Governor of Aden: On his arrival on 
the morning of Sunday, March 9, the Ambassador drove directly 
from the airport to the Governor,s office to begin his very 
busy day of visits.  In a half-hour conversation, the two 
covered a variety of topics, including economic and social 
development, security at the Port of Aden, the U.S. assisted 
development of the Yemeni Coast Guard, the upcoming 
parliamentary elections in April and the participation of 
women in the process and other issues.  The Governor thanked 
the Ambassador for the U.S. interest in and assistance to 
Aden. 
 
3.    (U) Opening of the Computer Center at the Yemen 
Women,s Association: The Ambassador then moved on to the 
Aden center of the Yemen Women,s Association to officially 
open their new computer center which was financed with a 
grant from the Public Diplomacy Section of the U.S. Embassy. 
The computer center now has ten state-of-the-art computers 
with networking capability and has become a busy place 
training women in computer skills. Embassy Sanaa,s 
Information Resource Director Helmi Noman provided technical 
help in helping set up the computer center as well as trained 
the staff as trainers. The Ambassador was briefed on the work 
of the Association and visited the organization,s three-year 
pre-school facility for the children of working mothers.  The 
children entertained the Ambassador and his entourage with 
recitations and songs. 
 
4.    (U) Visit to the School Desk Factory: The Ambassadorial 
motorcade then moved on to the &General Establishment for 
Furniture and School Equipment,8 where 150 thousand school 
desks are being manufactured for schools all over Yemen 
financed through 416(b) funds ($5.4m).  Each desk bears the 
Embassy,s &Gamariyya8 (traditional Yemeni motif 
incorporating the American flag) that has become a highly 
visible symbol of U.S.-Yemeni development cooperation. 
Director Fadhel Saleh Al-Hilali led a tour of the factory to 
show the various stages of the production.  The Ambassador 
walked by the desks at various states of completion sometimes 
piled as high as the ceiling.  The next day, newspapers 
carried photographs of the Ambassador standing next to those 
mountains of desks as well as trucks laden with the desks 
destined for various regions of the country. 
 
5.    (U) Visit to &Al-Ayyam8 Newspaper: The Ambassador 
then visited the editorial offices of the largest selling 
newspaper in the country, the privately-owned independent 
&Al-Ayyam8 to meet with the publisher and the 
Editor-in-Chief and to give a wide-ranging interview.  The 
interview, which was published in full in the Tuesday, March 
11 issue of the newspaper, covered topics under security and 
development in Yemen, as well as the Iraq and Palestine. 
Following the meeting, the Ambassador and his entourage were 
hosted for lunch by the publisher and owner of the newspaper, 
Hisham Bashraheel. (Complete translated text of the 
Ambassador,s interview sent septel). 
 
6.    (U) Visit to the &College of Light8 School for the 
Blind: The Ambassador,s last visit for the day was to the 
&College of Light8 School for the Blind which was renovated 
and equipped with a grant of more than $130 thousand from 
416(b) funds.  The Ambassador received a briefing on the work 
of the School and visited some classrooms where he chatted 
with students. 
 
7.    (U) Reception: In the evening, the Ambassador hosted a 
reception for Mission contacts in Aden at the Sheraton Gold 
Mohur Hotel located at the center of the picturesque Elephant 
Bay. More than 65 people, representing government, business, 
NGOs, the Yemeni Coast Guard, the foreign consular corps and 
the media were present at the gathering.  The Governor of 
Aden, Taha Ahmed Ghanem, came with his entourage and stayed 
for a long time, conversing with the Ambassador and others. 
 
8.    (U) Visit to the Coast Guard Facilities: On Monday, 
March 10, the Ambassador visited the sites of the Coast Guard 
operations and training bases.  Captain Robert Innes, the 
U.S. maritime advisor to the ROYG, guided the tour.  First, 
from the watchtower hill in the city, the Ambassador got a 
panoramic view of the proposed operations base.  Later, he 
visited the proposed operations base and then took a long 
tour of the training base which is located some distance from 
the former. 
 
9.    (U) Visit to the Aden Community College:  The 
Ambassador,s last visit was to the Aden Community College, a 
three-year American-style vocational-technical school which 
was established about three years ago and is scheduled to 
produce its first graduates this May.  The College is trying 
to maintain a flexible profile in providing graduates with 
practical skills which are needed in the actual job market. 
The Public Diplomacy Section of the Embassy has been 
assisting the College by providing books and providing 
computer training.  PD Sanaa has also requested an English 
Teaching Fellow for the College.  The College administration 
hosted a lunch for the Ambassadorial group following the 
briefing. 
 
10.   (U) Comment: One of the main purposes of the trip was 
to promote the public diplomacy aims of creating a positive 
image for the Mission in Aden in particular and in Yemen in 
general during a tense period in the region. The media 
coverage of the visit was wide and very positive.  The most 
prominent Aden daily, &Al-Ayyam8 reported that they sold 
additional copies during the first day of coverage and some 
key selling points sold out copies of the newspaper the day 
the Ambassador,s interview appeared. During the 
well-attended reception at the end of the first day both 
American officers and FSNs were told by many local attendees 
that while other foreign missions were leaving Yemen, it was 
refreshing and reassuring that the U.S. Mission was not only 
staying on, but remained actively and publicly engaged in 
prmoting development programs and bilateral cooperation.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR HULL\'S INTERVIEW WITH AL-AYYAM 
 
Translated text of Ambassador Hull\'s Arabic Interview with 
Al-Ayyam. Other aspects of the Ambassador\'s March 9-10 visit 
to Aden reported reftel. 
 
Begin Text: 
 
\"Q: We have learned that today you visited various places in 
Aden which have received U.S. assistance. Could you please 
tell us what kind of assistance was given? 
 
A: Of course, my visit to Aden has two objectives, the first 
one focuses on development and the other one focuses on 
security.  We started today to focus on development, 
including the assistance for manufacturing school furniture 
for schools all over the Republic of Yemen. We visited a 
school furniture factory in Mualla, Aden. We highly 
appreciate the efforts of all partners and the efforts of 
Yemeni workers. I think the factory currently employs about 
700 Yemeni workers. In addition to that, we visited the 
branch of the Yemen Women,s Union that has now a computer 
lab to provide training. No doubt, the Union provides great 
service to Yemeni society and Yemeni women, especially the 
new generation. Our efforts will continue in Yemen to assist 
Yemeni governorates, including Aden. 
 
Q: Does this assistance come within U.S. policy to support 
Yemeni civil society institutions? 
 
A: Yes, we have a partnership with the Yemeni government and 
with civil society institutions. 
 
Q: Let,s now move to the security side. The United States is 
currently training Yemeni coast guards. It installed 
observation systems in strategic locations in Aden city. How 
is this security cooperation going, and what can we expect in 
the near future? 
 
A: We believe that there is a link between development and 
security. There is no development without security and no 
security without development. Therefore, I believe that our 
efforts regarding the Yemeni Coast Guard are very important. 
We, at present, are working with two objectives. The first 
one is to train the new coast guard cadres and the second one 
is to provide boats and necessary equipment for the Coast 
Guard. We want to benefit from our visit (to Aden) to find 
locations for the Coast Guard and also locations for 
workshops that can serve the Coast Guard in the future. 
 
Q: What is the number of the trainees who were sent to the 
U.S.?  Will you send more groups? 
 
A: I think the first group of cadres was about 20 persons. 
They are now studying English in Yemen. After they learn the 
language, there will be training in the United States. 
 
Q: How do you evaluate Yemen,s efforts in counter-terrorism? 
 
A: I think Yemen is in the lead among states in 
counter-terrorism. No doubt, this was achieved thanks to the 
policy of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and the cooperation of 
the Yemeni people. We recently noticed a concrete and 
important progress in that regard. I think Yemen now, from 
the terrorism side, is much safer than it was in the past. I 
believe that by continuing more efforts in the future, we 
will see stability and security in this country. 
 
Regarding the security of the southern part of the Red Sea, 
there are many naval vessels that belong to the U.S., 
Germany, and Spain. They all set out from Djibouti. Is there 
a trend for using Aden seaport as well? 
 
A: I think it is possible to use Aden seaport if that is 
acceptable by the Yemeni government. At present we use the 
Port of Djibouti. No doubt that Aden seaport is excellent and 
suitable for use, but it is up to the Yemeni government. 
 
Q: Regarding Iraq, the U.S. Administration is now trying to 
get a new resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council. 
There is opposition from many countries in the Council. How 
do you view the issue of the new resolution? 
 
A: The new resolution is presented by the U.K. It is 
supported by Spain and the U.S. We believe that it is useful 
to be discussed by the Security Council. No one can predict 
the result of that debate. However, it is good that such 
issues will be discussed in full in the Security Council. 
 
Q: Don,t you believe that the rejection of that resolution 
or its failure by veto could form a threat to the legal cover 
that resolution No. 1441 provides? 
 
A: I do not think so. Resolution No. 1441 and the previous 
ones state clearly commitments on the Iraqi government to get 
rid of its weapons of mass destruction fully and immediately. 
It is clear that the recent reports of al-Baradei and Blix 
indicated that the Iraqi government did not comply. So, we 
believe that we have sufficient legal cover to go to military 
action without any other resolutions. 
 
Q: As a Yemeni and an Arab, how can I trust U.S. allegations? 
A: I think we should review the history. We faced a lot of 
problems in the past. Afghanistan and the terrorism coming 
from it were a problem of the international community. We had 
a great challenge regarding the Muslims in Kosovo who were 
being persecuted. If we go further into the past, to the 
Second World War and the great suffering in Europe and Asia. 
I think in all these cases, the U.S. played a leading role in 
facing those challenges. In Europe, during the Second World 
War, in the former Yugoslavia, in Kosovo and the suffering of 
Muslims there. And finally, the suffering of the Afghans as a 
result of the Taliban rule. If you review the situation today 
in all those places, people in Germany, Kosovo, Japan, and in 
Afghanistan are enjoying a much better life as a result of 
the effective leadership of the United States. Therefore, we 
should be judged by our record. 
 
Q: Do you mean that the Iraqi people will be in a better 
situation after the changing of the regime in Baghdad? 
 
A: Yes. No doubt the Iraqi people are a talented and educated 
people and Saddam,s government has caused lots of suffering 
to the Iraqi people and to the peoples of the region. The 
Iraqi people have been suffering for three decades from the 
evil of Saddam Hussein,s regime. The evidence of that is 
that many people from Arab states, Europe, and America can 
see university professors, doctors, and the elite of the 
Iraqi people who were forced by the Baghdad regime to leave 
their homeland and work in those countries as barbers, 
taxi-drivers, and restaurant workers. I am sure that the 
citizens of this Arab state will bear responsibility for the 
developmental reconstruction that will change Iraq within a 
few years. Those people were prevented from living in 
dignity. It is enough for us to recall our memory regarding 
Saddam Hussein,s use of chemical weapons against his people 
in Halabja and against his neighbors. That can make us 
realize that Iraq and the region will be in a better 
situation without that regime. 
 
Q: Do you think that overthrowing the Iraqi president,s 
regime and the establishment of a democratic state will lead 
to the spread of democracy and freedom in the region? 
 
A: I think that we have to know that Arab states and the Arab 
people are now undergoing a number of democratic experiences. 
If you think what is going on in Yemen regarding the upcoming 
elections, political pluralism, free press, and the ability 
of papers such as al-Ayyam to publish reports, I think we 
have to admit that there is a democratic activity that exists 
in this part of the world. I do not believe that this 
democratic activity has arrived in Iraq. In the last 
elections in Iraq, Saddam Hussein got 100% of the votes. What 
I think is that the opportunity will be given to the Iraqi 
citizens soon to create their own democracy. I am confident 
that this talented and educated people will add a great 
experience in that regard for the efforts of many 
(states/nations) in the region. 
 
Q: With regard to Yemen as a U.S. friend and ally, what does 
the U.S. expects from Yemen in the coming conflict with the 
Iraqi regime? 
 
A: We expect that Yemen will seek to achieve its national 
interest. I think that this is up to the Yemeni government to 
decide. I am certain that President Saleh and his government 
will do that. As for us, we wish that our cooperation with 
Yemen continue in the fields of development and security 
because we believe that those fields serve the interests of 
the U.S. and Yemeni people. 
 
Q: Some people say that America will enter Iraq to control 
its oil? 
 
A: With regret, the Iraqi people did not benefit from the oil 
which was discovered in 1928. Iraq is the first Arab oil 
state. Yet, Iraqi oil should not be for Moscow, Washington, 
London, Paris, or any other state, but it is for the people 
of Iraq. This has not yet happened, but it will happen soon. 
 
Q: Many people accuse the U.S. of neglecting the Palestinians 
and their suffering. What do you think? 
 
A: I believe that the nations of the Middle East are still 
worried about  developments in Palestine. President Bush 
reiterated his policy recently that the aim of our efforts is 
to establish an independent and democratic Palestinian state 
that lives peacefully side-by-side with Israel. We have a 
 road map, that leads us to that result. This map is not 
the idea of the U.S. only, but it is also the idea of 
Europeans, Russians, and the U.N. I believe that now we must 
put this map in effect so that we reduce violence both on the 
Israeli and Palestinian sides. We also must work towards 
providing more security and a better life for the 
Palestinians. President Bush said clearly that this is very 
important to the U.S. government.\"

REF: 2002 STATE 252456 
 
Classified By: AMB: EJHULL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Embassy Sanaa has now reviewed the targeting 
report noted in para three/reftel.  While the report cited 
several disturbing examples that may implicate Saba Islamic 
Bank (SIB) in supporting terrorist financing, the report also 
stated that the USG had information only on a few specific 
transactions through SIB by terrorists and that these did not 
specify complicity of bank officials.  Embassy Sanaa believes 
that it would not/not be prudent to designate SIB without 
more and better information to substantiate its possible role 
in terrorist financing. 
 
2.  (S/NF) Embassy Sanaa will review and follow up on the 
various sub-reports cited in the targeting report; we note 
that these were submitted over several years and may involve 
issues of context, changed circumstances, and information 
overtaken by events.  We will seek additional,up-to-date 
information on the ownership of SIB and the activities of 
Hamid Al-Ahmar in particular. 
 
3.  (S/NF) We assume as well that U.S. investigators working 
the cases of Sheikh Mohammed Hasan Ali Al-Moayad and the 
so-called \"Yemeni money-laundering\" ring in the U.S. will be 
seeking any information that might substantiate SIB and 
Al-Ahmar activities in terrorist financing.  We note that the 
targeting report, which was compiled prior to the arrest of 
Sheikh Al-Moayad and to publication of news about the 
money-laundering case, made reference to both of these. 
Further investigation along these lines may therefore be 
directly relevant. 
 
4. (S/NF) As Embassy Sanaa noted in our previous message on 
this issue (2002 Sanaa 3726), we believe that designation of 
Shaykh \'Abd al-Majid Al-Zindani could serve U.S. 
counter-terrorism interests, especially if we can tie him to 
Al-Qa\'ida, and get UN endorsement.  Our belief is that USG 
efforts should give primary focus to Shaykh Al-Zindani\'s 
history and activities, and that this is more likely to 
produce results that could lead to ROYG decisions in our 
mutual interests.  Hamid Al-Ahmar and Sabaa Islamic Bank may 
be secondary/secondary targets for subsequent action as 
further supporting information becomes available. In any 
event, prior to possible designation of Al-Zindani, Hamid 
Al-Ahmar, and/or Sabaa Islamic Bank, we need to develop 
additional evidence, and follow where that evidence may lead 
with appropriate decisions.

SUBJECT: YEMEN: FOUR HUNT OIL EMPLOYEES SHOT, THREE FATALLY 
 
Classified By: AMB: EJHULL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (C) Four Hunt Oil employees working at a Hunt rig in 
Marib were shot by a Yemeni employee shortly before 1215 
hours local March 18.  Ron Horsch, an American citizen, was 
killed, as was William Seville, a Canadian, and Anam 
Al-Qubati, a Yemeni.  Another Canadian, Mark Edwards, has two 
gunshot wounds, to the abdomen and to the leg, and will 
shortly be transferred to the Yemen-German Hospital in Sanaa. 
 The assailant was a Yemeni, Naji Ahmed Al-Kumaym, working at 
the Hunt site, an employee of the Nabors firm.  After 
shooting Horsch, Seville, and Edwards, Al-Kumaym shot himself 
dead. 
 
2.  (C) Karim Abu Hamad of Hunt, our source for the above 
information, indicated that Al-Kumaym, as a Nabors employee, 
was a familiar presence at the Marib site.  He was reportedly 
carrying a concealed handgun which he used as the fatal 
weapon.  Abu Hamad said that Hunt has shut down the rig, 
alerted all employees to hunker down and maintain security; 
Hunt headquarters in Dallas has been informed, as have ROYG 
security officials and President Salih\'s office. 
 
3.  (C) We are maintaining contact with Hunt.  We are 
offering medical assistance if necessary, and following up 
regarding contacts with next-of-kin and arrangements for Mr. 
Horsch.  We have alerted the Operations Center by phone and 
the Canadian Embassy in Riyadh.  We are initiating contact 
with the Ministry of Interior to launch an immediate 
investigation, including the FBI representative at post, and 
are also in touch through liaison channels with PSO. 
 
4.  (C) Comment: At this initial stage, it is not possible to 
determine if these Hunt shootings were motivated by 
terrorism, by a job-related grievance, or by al-Kumaym\'s 
personal sense of grievance in the heated environment of 
regional developments.

1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened an 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC) meeting on March 18 to 
assess threat information in light of the shooting incident 
at the Hunt Oil facility in Marib (ref a) and the Iraq 
contingency.  An uncorroborated source from an accounting 
firm that works with Hunt and Nabors reported to RSO that the 
shooter was a disgruntled employee who had been fired and who 
was not supposed to be allowed on the oil complex.  EAC 
members decided to go to the MoveSafe stance immediately as a 
precaution, which means that employees must limit their 
travel and move in armored vehicles from residence to Embassy 
(ref b).  Key offices and personnel represented at the 
meeting included: AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, 
ORCA, OMC, SOC YEMEN, RMO, FPD, FBI and YALI (Yemen American 
Language Institute).  End summary.

Update on Shootings in Marib 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Ambassador spoke by telephone with Ray Hunt, Hunt 
Oil President (in the U.S.), and assured him of the Embassy\'s 
assistance with the disposition of the Amcit Ron Horsch\'s 
body and the injured Canadian victim.  RMO spoke to the 
director of the Yemen-German Hospital where the injured 
Canadian is undergoing surgery at 1830 local time.  He was 
shot twice in the area of the liver but progress is 
reportedly positive.  RMO will remain in close contact with 
hospital authorities to monitor his condition and offer 
assistance as needed.  Hunt headquarters is contacting family 
members of the victims.  CONS is coordinating closely with 
Hunt to provide services as necessary. 
 
3.  (S)  Post cannot yet determine the motive of the killer. 
However, a source from an accounting firm co-located near 
Hunt oil and Nabors in Marib reported to RSO that the killer, 
Naji Ahmed al-Kumayn, was a disgruntled former employee, 
recently fired, who was not supposed to be at the oil 
complex.  This source reported differing information from 
that received from Hunt regarding the weapon used in this 
incident, stating that it was an AK-47 and not a pistol. 
FBI, FPD (acting as a force multiplier for RSO) and security 
personnel are traveling to Marib to assist in the 
investigation.  Post expects further investigative details by 
the morning of March 19.   (Comment:  Post urges caution in 
reaching any conclusion on killer\'s motivation pending 
results of investigation.) 
 
4.  (C)  Post has received many calls from media outlets

Iraq Contingency and Current Threat Information 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Ambassador said that in light of President Bush\'s 
speech, the change to StandFast would probably occur by 
Thursday, March 20 unless circumstances warrant otherwise, 
which will be discussed in another EAC meeting on March 19. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  ORCA briefed on current threat information.  Some 
reporting was received corroborating the possibility of 
random terrorist attacks unaffiliated to al-Qaeda or Iraqi 
elements.  It was noted that such \"lone wolf\" terrorists, 
acting alone or with small groups, could take advantage of 
the Yemeni security forces possibly being stretched thin in 
an Iraq contingency responding to increased demonstrations. 
ORCA said that \"lone wolf\" terrorists do not have the time or 
resources to plan attacks and would look for targets of 
opportunity.  Changing routes and times and avoiding known 
places where Americans congregate or popular intersections is 
key to staying safe. 
 
7.  (S/NF)  In light of the Marib incident of an employee 
being the killer, security at the Embassy regarding FSN 
access was discussed.  FSNs are screened through metal 
detectors both at the entrance gate and at Post One.  EAC 
members were not aware of any FSNs who might be angry at the 
Embassy.  The YALI Director stated that he would immediately 
institute similar entry screening for YALI staff of all 
nationalities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
No Immediate Request for Authorized Departure 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Ambassador asked EAC members to consider seriously 
whether Post should recommend a change to authorized 
departure status.  There was no support for a move to 
authorized departure at this time.  It was decided that the 
EAC would discuss the matter further after more information 
is known about the Marib incident.  EAC members discussed a 
number of other factors, including: 
 
-- surveying all Amcit staff to again ascertain their opinion 
and whether non-essential employees and family members would 
plan to leave; 
 
-- determining what was meant by a comment made by the head 
of airport security to FPD that if it was up to him he would 
close the airport starting March 19; 
 
-- examining the likelihood of incidents like Marib and Jibla 
happening in Sanaa to harder targets; 
 
-- continuing to examine tripwires; 
 
-- assessing reaction to the start of an Iraq war. 
 
---------------- 
MoveSafe Posture 
---------------- 
 
9.  (S/NF)  After discussing the Marib incident, the Iraq 
contingency and other threat information, EAC members decided 
to go to a MoveSafe stance effective immediately after 
weighing the pros and cons of such a move.  During MoveSafe, 
employees are directed to minimize travel on the streets of 
Sanaa and required to perform essential travel in armored 
vehicles only (ref b).  Information on MoveSafe status was 
disseminated by radio, telephone and by section heads to 
those still at the Embassy. 
 
--------------- 
Warden Messages 
--------------- 
 
10.  (U)  RSO reported that the Ministry of Interior 
recommended that Americans avoid Bab al-Yemen and other 
tourist areas for the time being in light of the possible 
war.  EAC decided to issue an immediate Warden Message 
apprising Amcits of the Marib incident and including this 
recommendation to avoid known areas where Americans 
congregate. 
 
------------------------------ 
Other Security Issues/Measures 
------------------------------ 
 
10.  (S)  The area where all vehicles undergo bomb checks in 
front of the embassy was discussed as a possible easy target. 
 RSO will move vehicles to block sightlines to that area and 
in the long term is looking into moving the sight off the 
main road.  In addition, section heads were encouraged to 
ensure that employees did alter their time of arrival to 
avoid congestion and ensure they were changing times and 
routes to a degree sufficient to frustrate any surveillance 
attempt. 
 
11.  (S)  RSO continued follow-up meetings regarding Sheraton 
security to ensure proper coordination between the multiple 
layers of security present at the hotel, including PSO, MOI, 
hotel guards and group four (ref c). 
12.  (C)  Embassy-affiliated Yemen-American Language School 
(YALI) was discussed.  It was recommended that they screen 
all employees.  As recommended to all Amcits, YALI plans to 
lie low when the Iraq war begins and assess the situation 
before returning to regular operations. 
 
13.  (C)  The National Democratic Institute decided to move 
their Amcit and Canadian trainers into Sanaa and move the 
director to a hotel from her well-known house.  NDI is now 
considering having all of its temporary expats leave Yemen in 
light of the Marib incident. 
 
14.  (C)  The March 15 demonstrations were discussed.  RSO 
reported that the MOI gave him conflicting information from 
that reported by the United Nations security director 
regarding how the demonstration near the UN complex in Sanaa 
was dispersed.  The UN representative reported that shots 
were fired in the air by security forces after several unruly 
youths attempted to climb a vehicle with a machine gun mount. 
 No injuries occurred.  The MOI reported, however, that shots 
were fired in the air after stone throwers threatened to get 
out of hand, and denied that anyone attempted to get onto a 
military vehicle.  DAO said that a reliable source confirmed 
press reports that demonstrations in Saada on the same day 
got out of control and several people were killed. 
 
15.  (U)  Text of Press Statement: 
 
The American Embassy has learned of the shooting of four 
employees of Hunt Oil in Marib, Yemen. 
 
One American citizen, a Yemeni and a Canadian were killed; 
another Canadian wounded. 
 
We condemn this violence and call on the Yemeni government to 
investigate it fully. 
 
We cannot release further information pending notification of 
family. 
 
The Embassy will assist in dealing with the injured and 
deceased. 
 
American law enforcement personnel will assist the Yemeni 
government in investigating this case.

1.  (C)  Summary:  An Islah party leader entertained the 
possibility of al-Moayed\'s guilt after hearing evidence from 
the U.S. complaint.  P/E DepChief met with Islah party 
political director Mohamed Qahtan on March 17 and discussed 
the case of Sheikh Mohammed Ali al-Moayed, who is an Islah 
party Shura Council member (ref a).  Qahtan was somewhat 
persuaded that al-Moayed might be guilty, particularly in 
regards to the evidence of jihad trainee sponsorship gathered 
in Afghanistan.  Qahtan, a noted party moderate, had 
requested the meeting to discuss his concerns about the 
increased danger to Americans as more anti-war demonstrations 
occur between now and the April 27 parliamentary elections 
(septel).  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  P/E DepChief verbally briefed Qahtan about the U.S. 
complaint against al-Moayed and highlighted its most 
compelling evidence.  She said that the case was very strong 
and the Islah party should consider whether it wants to 
actively support al-Moayed.  She noted the case is now in the 
German court system. 
 
3.  (C)  On the evidence presented, Qahtan was less impressed 
with the informant-produced evidence, skeptical like others 
cited in the Yemeni press about the $20 million figure of 
money donated to al-Qaeda and was surprised and troubled 
about the evidence from Afghanistan showing jihad trainee 
sponsorship.  He asked if the sponsorship was before 1997 and 
P/E DepChief said no, it was 2000.  He looked very concerned 
at this piece of evidence and said if that were true, Qahtan 
did not know al-Moayed at all.  He repeated that he simply 
could not believe al-Moayed could be involved in al-Qaeda, 
but said perhaps al-Moayed is a very good actor.  He cracked 
a bit of a joke and said if al-Moayed was proven guilty, the 
Islah party would sue to get their donations to his charity 
back.  (Note: P/E DepChief avoided mentioning Hamas and 
concentrated on al-Qaeda.  End Note) 
 
4.  (C)  Qahtan said he had read a report from a Yemeni 
student in Germany who visited al-Moayed in jail.  The report 
alleged that al-Moayed was being kept in solitary confinement 
without anything to keep him busy (books, radio) and that an 
interpreter was not provided when doctors visited (causing 
health problems) nor when meals were served (creating 
problems in relation to religious restrictions).  Qahtan said 
he hoped al-Moayed was being treated well and asked that the 
American Embassy do something to ensure it.  P/E DepChief 
said she had not heard anything about mistreatment and that 
Qahtan should contact German authorities if he had concerns. 
Qahtan thanked her for the information and said he would 
follow the case as it moves through the German courts. 
 
5.  (C)  Qahtan also said that al-Moayed\'s sons had received 
phone calls soon after their father\'s arrest in Germany 
encouraging them to kidnap a German citizen in retaliation. 
He said that the sons thought these to come from members of 
the security forces.  Post cannot confirm this allegation. 
 
6.  (C)  The al-Moayed case continues to get high publicity 
and political play, and the typical view of the case by many, 
including the government (ref b), is that he could not be 
involved with al-Qaeda.  Members of the Khowlan tribe have 
been camping out in front of the President\'s Palace for days 
demanding ROYG action on the matter.  Widespread scorn and 
derision exists from government to journalistic circles about 
the $20 million donation figure quoted in the press and cited 
in the U.S. complaint. 
 
7.  (C)  Comment:  Post succeeded in planting a seed of doubt 
with at least one member of the Islah party regarding 
al-Moayed\'s guilt.  However, Qahtan is a noted moderate and 
his atypical reaction is because he is perhaps more amenable 
to persuasion than others in his party.  End Comment.

1.  (C)  Summary:  Islah party political director Mohamed 
Qahtan expressed concern that an onset of war in Iraq would 
endanger Americans in Sanaa because increased demonstrations 
may spiral out of the government\'s control.  P/E DepChief met 
with him on March 17 at his request.  Qahtan, a well-known 
moderate, requested the meeting to discuss his concerns 
about demonstrations and whether the April 27 parliamentary 
elections will be postponed.  Party election preparations and 
the case of Sheikh Mohammed Ali al-Moayed were also discussed 
(septel).  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Concern about Demonstrations 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Qahtan expressed concern that the 
government-sponsored demonstrations could spiral out of 
control with the onset of war in Iraq.  He wanted to warn the 
Embassy to be extra careful as he did not have great 
confidence that all demonstrations would be controlled well 
by the security forces.  Qahtan also said he thinks \"Saddam 
should go now\" and that the \"Iraqi people have suffered 
enough.\" 
 
3,  (C)  P/E DepChief brought up the Islah party leadership\'s 
comments at the government-sponsored demonstration held on 
March 15.  Islah party leader Sheikh al-Ahmar and Islah party 
Shura Council Chairman and leader of the fundamentalist 
faction Sheikh al-Zindani were both quoted in press reports 
as calling for jihad against Americans should a war begin 
against Iraq.  P/E DepChief said that comments like that put 
Americans and the Embassy in danger and were crossing the 
line.  Qahtan said he had written a column negating those 
comments that was not published.  He offered to apologize on 
behalf of the party, but said he cannot really speak for all 
factions.  (Comment:  Zindani leads the fundamentalist 
faction, Qahtan is one of the moderates.  End Comment).  He 
said that President Saleh had co-opted al-Zindani starting 
with his forced participation on the Code of Conduct 
committee (ref), and tried to place part of the blame for 
al-Zindani\'s comments on the government for allowing and 
perhaps encouraging them.  He did not address Sheikh 
al-Ahmar\'s comments. 
 
4.  (C)  Post learned from the United Nations Security Chief 
in Sanaa that the March 15 demonstration had to be dispersed 
by gunfire in the air by security forces after some unruly 
youths tried to climb a police truck with a machine gun 
mounted upon it.  This information was not confirmed by the 
RSO with the Ministry of Interior.  The MOI said the 
dispersal by gunfire was to stop stone throwers from getting 
out of hand.  No one was injured or killed. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Elections Could be Postponed;  Party Preparations 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5.  (C)  Qahtan said that he hears rumors constantly about a 
possible postponement of the April 27 elections if an Iraq 
war starts, but does not have any concrete information.  He 
indicated that he hoped there would not be any delay.  P/E 
DepChief said that we encourage the elections to go forward. 
 
6.  (C)  Qahtan said election preparations are continuing 
between the Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) and within Islah. 
Approximately 65 constituencies are already agreed between 
Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and Islah in terms of which 
party\'s candidate runs in which constituency.  These are 
primarily in Aden, Taiz and Sanaa.  As of March 16, 8 
constituencies of the regions already discussed remain 
unresolved.  Discussions are ongoing, and Qahtan 
characterizes them as constructive.  He did not give an exact 
number of seats where YSP women are running for the JMP, but 
said there were several. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  Post will continue to monitor demonstrations closely 
and disseminate information on their scope and location to 
the American community to ensure their safety.  It is 
doubtful that the comments made by certain Islah party 
members regarding jihad or containing other inflammatory 
language will end.  The Islah party in particular will try to 
use the Iraq war and U.S.-Yemeni counterterrorism cooperation 
to discredit the governing General People\'s Congress (GPC) in 
the election campaign.  End Comment

Classified By: AMB: EJHULL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Following the March 18 shooting in Marib of four Hunt 
Oil employees (reftel), our consular section has been in 
touch with the family of deceased Amcit Ron Horsch in the 
U.S. and is assisting in arrangements for shipment of remains 
from Yemen tonight via Frankfurt.  Mark Edwards, the Canadian 
wounded in the shooting, had successful surgery in Sanaa and 
was medevaced from Yemen by air through arrangements made by 
Hunt. 
 
2. (C) Investigation of the shooting by Naji Ahmed Al-Kumaym 
is continuing.  Embassy team, including FBI local 
representative, an OSI investigator, and RSO staff have 
received information from Yemeni police sources and are 
presently at the Marib site where they will be examining the 
crime scene and interviewing eye witnesses and others in the 
coming hours before returning to Sanaa tonight. 
 
3.  (C) According to a Hunt Oil source, Al-Kumaym had been 
released as an employee by Nabors three times since 1992.  He 
is said to have had family problems, not to have been 
religiously observant or extremist, and reportedly was on 
medications, with medications having been found in his room. 
Yemeni police told our investigators that Al-Kumaym had been 
an employee of Nabors for seven years in good standing, as a 
carpenter, and that he was well known by Hunt employees 
including his victims.  The police added that Al-Kumaym had 
seen a doctor three days ago, and had been having sleeping 
problems and problems with his family; the police also said 
Al-Kumaym was not religious and was not known to speak of 
politics.  The police confirmed that the attack weapon was a 
handgun of Russian manufacture, not, as some press reports 
have said, an AK-47. 
 
4. (C) A Hunt official told us that operations in Yemen are 
under review in the light of regional circumstances, and that 
dependents are to be evacuated.  RSO is providing requested 
advice and assistance in obtaining metal detectors and 
security equipment. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  Until investigators have interviewed 
witnesses at the site, it remains premature to reach any 
conclusion regarding possible motives behind these shootings. 
 We expect to know more by tomorrow.

 1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened an 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC) meeting on March 19 to 
assess threat information in light of further information on 
the shooting incident at the Hunt Oil facility in Marib (refs 
a, b and septel) and the Iraq contingency.  Because the 
investigation into the Marib incident is ongoing, a 
determination of motive is premature (septel), as is a 
decision on any recommendation for authorized departure.  EAC 
members decided to go to the StandFast stance at close of 
business March 20, which means that the Embassy will be 
closed, American employees must remain at their assigned 
StandFast locations (Embassy, residence or Alternate Command 
Center) and only cleared FSNs are allowed at the Embassy (ref 
c).  Key offices and personnel represented at the meeting 
included: AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, ORCA, 
OMC, SOC YEMEN and RMO.

Update on Shootings in Marib 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Embassy investigative team in Marib is receiving 
good cooperation from the Yemeni authorities and are 
continuing their investigation.  Conflicting information 
about the perpetrator and an ongoing site visit to the crime 
scene mean that a motive is not yet determined.  The injured 
Canadian was medevaced March 19 after successful surgery on 
March 18 that left him in stable condition.  Embassy is 
providing assistance as needed.  Details reported septel. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Current Threat Information; 
StandFast 3/20 COB for Iraq Contingency 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (S/NF)  ORCA said there was no change to current threat 
information, but continued to recommend caution and indicated 
that a \"lone wolf\" attack scenario remains the most likely 
(ref a).  SOC said the Central Security Organization had no 
indications of planned demonstrations.  DAO reported that 
airport officials confirmed normal operations with no plans 
to close or curtail in the event of war in Iraq.  EAC members 
discussed airlines continuing to operate.  Pol/E reported 
that Emirates Airlines and Yemenia Airlines planned to 
continue operations. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  EAC members discussed the current Centcom 
guidance on force protection condition.  After a discussion 
of likely scenarios and opsec considerations, EAC agreed to 
move to a StandFast posture effective at close of business on 
March 20. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  EAC decided to alert American employees about the 
StandFast decision immediately, while waiting until after the 
March 20 EAC meeting to alert FSNs via a DCM-hosted meeting. 
A declaration of StandFast means the immediate closure of the 
Embassy and curtailment of all but essential operations. 
American employees must remain at their assigned StandFast 
location (Embassy, residence or Alternate Command Center) and 
cannot travel without RSO permission.  FSN access is severely 
limited to a list of essential employees updated daily by 
section heads via the RSO (ref c). 
 
6.  (C)  The distribution of gas masks and atropine kits will 
be made March 19 by HU and FMO. 
 
7.  (S/NF)  Because of the Marib incident of an employee 
being the killer and the issue of an exposed area for vehicle 
bomb checks in front of the Embassy, EAC decided to end 
parking privileges inside the compound for FSNs effective 
with the shift to StandFast.  FSNs will be asked to park 
their cars along the barricaded median outside the Embassy 
wall to help block sightlines while vehicles are checked. 
After StandFast, the issue will be reviewed to decide whether 
to continue the practice or alter it. 
 
8.  (C)  Admin made arrangements for supplies, including 
mattresses, sheets and toiletries, to be made available for 
those employees remaining in the Embassy during StandFast. 
The cafeteria will be open for breakfast, lunch, dinner and 
weekends.  In addition, Admin has ensured that motorpool 
handled the change to travel via armored vehicles only during 
MoveSafe with DAO\'s able assistance. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
No Immediate Request for Authorized Departure 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Ambassador continued to ask EAC members to consider 
seriously whether Post should recommend a change to 
authorized departure status.  Ambassador said that without a 
completed investigation and concrete information on motive 
for the Marib incident, the matter should be discussed again 
at the March 20 EAC.  Section heads queried their staff to 
see if who would plan to leave under authorized departure. 
ADM, Pol/Econ, CONS and DAO indicated that none of their 
staff or spouses would plan on leaving under current 
circumstances.

Warden Messages

10.  (U)  CONS reported that, per Department instruction, a 
Warden Message advising Americans to consider buying plane 
tickets in advance as a precautionary measure would be 
disseminated March 19.  CONS will also work with other 
sections to continue close contact with the airlines and 
airport to stay up to date on available flights.

the mission of protecting Americans and close coordination 
would be key.  MOI agreed.  Ambassador briefed on Embassy 
plans for MoveSafe and StandFast postures, which was welcomed 
by MOI and PSO Chief.  Ambassador brought up a number of 
items, including getting needed ammunition out of customs 
limbo, obtaining enough civilian (non-diplomatic) license 
plates for Embassy vehicles, having security provided for the 
YALI teachers shuttle and noting several Iraq-related issues. 
 
 
3.  (S/NF)  MOI brought up the following:

Update on Shootings in Marib 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Embassy investigative team returned from Marib 
the evening of March 19, and at this stage, there is no 
information indicating that the tragic incident was anything 
other than a criminal attack.  Investigators have several 
strong leads to continue their inquiry.  A clear picture is 
emerging of how the slayings occurred; however, the shooter\'s 
motive remains unclear.  Investigation has yet to uncover any 
anti-Western or extremist views by the perpetrator. 
Witnesses confirm that the shooter had sleeping problems and 
was involved in a family dispute, and he was on several kinds 
of medication.  Contrary to press reports, no evidence 
confirms allegations that the shooter had been a poor 
employee or fired at any time.  Embassy is providing other 
assistance as needed.  Details reported septel.  See

information.  EAC members discussed the possibility of 
demonstrations, particularly after mosque sermons on Friday, 
March 21, but had no information of planned demonstrations at 
this time.  RSO reported that airport officials indicated 
that so far only Egyptair would curtail operations.

DEMONSTRATION 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  A violent demonstration that left 
several demonstrators dead and injured near the Embassy has 
dissipated and is over as of 1800 local time.  Embassy 
reacted the Marine Security Guard and other measures in 
response and informed the Embassy and American community of 
the situation.  ROYG security response was strong, including 
more than 2000 military and police forces, including three 
tanks, demonstrating the government\'s commitment to 
protecting Americans.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Demonstration Ended;  Situation Under Control 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  The demonstration that turned violent near the 
Embassy has dissipated and is over as of 1800 local. 
Demonstrators clashed with security forces at Sheraton Circle 
(about 1/4 mile from Embassy).  Numbers were estimated at 
5-7,000 demonstrators.  Security forces used tear gas and 
shots in the air to attempt dispersal.  Embassy personnel at 
the Sheraton reported witnessing shots being fired into the 
crowd, and RSO received reports from our Local Guard Force 
(LGF) that some demonstrators had weapons. Several 
demonstrators have been reportedly killed and several police 
injured.  MFA informed DCM that more than 2000 military and 
police forces were deployed to respond to protect the 
Embassy. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  A group of demonstrators gathered in Tahrir 
Square near the center of Sanaa after Friday prayers (approx. 
1230) and moved through the city past the Sheraton Hotel to 
the intersection near the Sheraton (home of many Embassy 
TDYers). 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Yemeni security, including busloads of riot 
police and water cannon, stopped the demonstrators from 
coming closer to the Embassy.  Embassy received notice of a 
petition, and the DCM prepared to go out and receive it.  Per 
Embassy policy, three petitioners are allowed to come to give 
the petition.  However, the demonstrators could not decide 
which three should go and the Embassy refused to allow more. 
At that time, the crowd became unruly and began to throw 
stones.  Yemeni security reacted by firing tear gas and shots 
in the air. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Several hundred demonstrators attempted to circle 
around the Embassy but were met by security forces firing in 
the air.  They were unable to approach the entrance. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  At this time, reports are that there are at least 
four demonstrators killed, many injured and nine police 
injured (mostly from stones).  Al Jazeera reported six 
demonstrators killed at 1700 local time. 
 
7.  (S/NF)  RSO was informed by Yemeni security that an Amcit 
journalist near the demonstration has been detained at a safe 
location for his safety. 
 
---------------- 
Embassy Response 
---------------- 
 
8.  (S/NF)  Embassy reacted the Marine Security Guards and 
advised the numerous personnel at the Embassy for StandFast 
to remain indoors to avoid any stray bullets coming down. 
RSO activated Embassy assets, including Force Protection 
Detachment and SOC-Yemen, to provide additional protection. 
 
9.  (S/NF)  Warden Messages have been issued to Embassy 
community to inform them of the demonstration and the 
recommend they continue to stay put.  Several radio 
announcements were made by RSO to inform Embassy personnel at 
their residences and at the ACC to continue StandFast. 
 
10.  (S/NF)  Ambassador called a meeting at 1430 local to 
discuss internal defense measures at the Embassy and other 
issues.  Recommendations discussed include: 
 
-- a 24/7 watch being instituted from the Embassy roof. 
-- LGF roving patrols continuing around the perimeter. 
 
-- Ensuring strong command and control structures under the 
COM of all Embassy elements. 
 
-- Rules of Engagement regarding response should an 
intruder(s) attempt to scale the perimeter walls, including 
use of tear gas, the use of lethal force if entry to the 
Chancery or Residence is attempted and procedures for LGF and 
RSO response. 
 
-- DCM to ensure that Sheraton security is strengthened even 
further, with the possibility of pulling Embassy personnel 
there into the Embassy if necessary. 
 
(S/NF)  The 24th Marine Expeditionary Force called to give 
their current position off Djibouti and to inform that they 
can be available for rescue within 12 to 24 hours should the 
situation warrant a forced evacuation. 
 
------------- 
ROYG Response 
------------- 
 
11.  (S/NF)  DCM received phone calls from the MFA protocol 
director providing assurances to the Embassy that the ROYG is 
responding strongly to the situation.  He told the DCM that 
more than 2000 military and police forces were deployed and 
that the forces were expected to continue keeping the 
demonstrators away from the Embassy.  He said the ROYG has a 
\"total commitment\" to protect the Embassy and other 
diplomatic missions.  He added that this commitment extended 
to Embassy residences and the Sheraton Hotel, where he 
realizes many Americans stay. 
 
12.  (S/NF)  Ambassador took a call from the Presidency 
giving reassurance that they will take all \"necessary 
measures\" to protect the Embassy. 
 
--------------- 
Press Reporting 
--------------- 
 
13.  (U)  Television and wire services have been reporting 
the demonstrations since 1500 local time.  Al-Jazeera reports 
that six people have been killed in fierce clashes between 
police and demonstrators near the Embassy. Wire services (AFP 
and Reuters) have reported that tens of thousands of 
demonstrators chanted \"Death to America.\" and that one 
policeman and three protesters were killed.   Yemeni 
television and radio has not reported any news of the 
demonstrations.  However, the English language newspaper the 
Yemen Times has been running wire reports of the 
demonstrations on its website.  PD has been fielding calls 
from press about the situation and is drafting press 
guidance.

1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened two 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC) meetings on March 21.  At 
1400, EAC met to assess threat information in light of 
developments with the Iraq contingency and a developing 
demonstration.  At 1830, EAC met to discuss Embassy response 
to the violent demonstration near the Embassy that left 
several demonstrators and security forces dead and injured 
(ref a).  Internal defense measures are in place, including 
standing a 24/7 watch using RSO-directed Embassy elements 
with agreed-upon rules of engagement.  At 1915 Ambassador 
discussed the situation with President Saleh, offering 
condolences and appreciation for security provided, asking 
for further enhancements and suggesting that Saleh might 
issue a public statement urging non-violence.  Saleh is 
convening a security meeting immediately and will respond on 
specific enhancements for security.  More demonstrations are 
expected March 22.  Key offices and personnel represented at 
the meeting included: AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, 
RSO, ORCA, OMC, SOC YEMEN and RMO. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Demonstration Near Embassy Turns Violent 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  A demonstration at Sheraton Circle near the 
Embassy turned violent, leaving several dead (ref a).  By 
1800 local, ROYG and Embassy security called an all clear. 
SOC said Central Security Organization (CSO) reported two 
officers killed and four critically wounded.  DAO sources 
reported three demonstrators killed and 14 injured.  Media 
reports on deaths and injuries vary.  Al Jazeera and Yemeni 
television reported the death of a 12 year old boy during the 
demonstration. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  ORCA reported that the hard-core demonstrators 
who remained to clash with the security forces were in two 
main groups, one with approximately 400 persons and one with 
approximately 250.  ROYG elements reported approximately 800 
in total. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  In response to rumours at 1845, RSO spoke to MOI 
to dispatch CSO forces to deal with an alleged mob of 
demonstrators who had gathered at the Sanaa International 
School (SIS), which is currently closed.  The rumors proved 
unfounded. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  DAO reported that evening mosque sermons were 
calling for additional protests and stoking the emotions of 
worshippers.  Demonstrators are planning to return to the 
Embassy March 22. 
 
7.  (S/NF)  The YALI teacher and stringer for Associated 
Press who was detained by military intelligence at the 
demonstration was taken to the Embassy pending a safe time to 
get him home via armored vehicle. 
 
---------------- 
Embassy Response 
---------------- 
 
8.  (S/NF)  Internal defense measures were put in place to 
ensure wide security coverage and adequate response.  The 
plan included a floor-by-floor approach by MSG and other 
augmentees for defense of the chancery.  24/7 watchstanding 
began at 1930, with personnel on the roofs of both the 
chancery and the residence.  Rules of Engagement have been 
agreed, to include clear command and control under RSO, 
watchstanders in body armor and armed and use of lethal force 
only with RSO (and COM) direction or in self-defense or in 
defense of American life. 
 
9.  (S/NF)  EAC discussed concern that the Sheraton Hotel 
could become a target in future demonstrations, although it 
was not a target at the 3/21 demonstration.  EAC decided not 
to remove to the Embassy the 15-20 Embassy personnel on 
StandFast at the Sheraton.  Rather, they will be moved in 
armored vehicles as soon as the Embassy hears a demonstration 
might be forming anywhere in Sanaa.  Embassy personnel on 
StandFast at their residences and the ACC will remain because 
they live far from the Embassy and are not in high 
concentrations. 
 
10.  (S/NF)  EAC suggested another radio message be 
disseminated to provide further information on the 
demonstration and advise them to remain at StandFast. 
 
11.  (S/NF)  PAO reported that press guidance is being 
cleared through Washington and that requests were received 
for interviews about the demonstration, which he declined. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
President Saleh Promises Continued Security 
------------------------------------------- 
 
12.  (S/NF)  Ambassador spoke with President Saleh by phone. 
Ambassador offered regret for the Yemenis killed and injured, 
particularly security forces.  He told Saleh that he 
appreciated the protection provided and suggested that 
further enhancements of security measures for Embassy and 
Amcits should be discussed.  Ambassador also suggested it 
would be helpful for President Saleh to make a statement 
discouraging violence and turning efforts towards 
humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, similar to 
statements made in Morocco and soon in Jordan. 
 
13.  (S/NF)  The Presidency phoned again and told the 
Ambassador that Saleh appreciated the Ambassador\'s points and 
is convening immediately a security meeting to go over 
contingencies.  The President will be in touch with specific 
enhancements. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Other Threats and Security Issues; 
Marib Incident 
--------------------------------- 
 
14.  (S/NF)  ORCA reported no change in current threat 
information beyond the demonstrations.  ORCA reported on 
ongoing discussions with PSO regarding Iraqis.  EAC discussed 
developments and upcoming actions in the Iraq war and 
worldwide televised demonstrations in regards to their effect 
on the situation in Sanaa. 
 
15.  (S)  The list of Americans for the MOI for protection 
continues to be worked. 
 
16.  (S/NF)  The investigation into the Marib incident 
continued and no concrete evidence for a motive -- political

Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  As of 1500 local March 22, no 
demonstrations are occurring in Sanaa after the violent 3/21 
demonstration caused numerous deaths and injuries of 
civilians and police (reftels). Security has been further 
augmented around the Embassy, with the addition of more 
Yemeni security personnel and armored vehicles. 
 
-- President Saleh issued a strong statement the evening of 
3/21 condemning the violence and calling the demonstration 
illegal.  He also inserted a note of solidarity with the U.S. 
on preventing terror while continuing to state opposition to 
the war in Iraq, supporting Saleh\'s statement supports post\'s 
expectation that the President is keen to prevent further 
unauthorized demonstrations getting out of control. 
 
-- At a 3/22 meeting with MOI Brigadier General Sunaidar, DCM 
expressed appreciation for security provided during the 
demonstration and condolences for Yemeni deaths and injuries. 
 Sunaidar said he would participate in questioning those 
arrested, and noted that one detained instigator of the 3/21 
demonstration is a leading figure in Yemeni\'s chapter of the 
Iraqi Baath Party. 
 
-- Post received further information early 3/22 about the 
location of the Yemeni Ambassador\'s residence in Baghdad 
after weeks of requests by the Embassy. 
 
-- EAC met at 1400 to discuss the security situation.  Key 
offices and personnel represented at the meeting included: 
AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, ORCA, OMC, SOC 
YEMEN, FPD and RMO.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
President Saleh\'s Strong Statement 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  On Yemeni television and published prominently in 
the government daily al-Thawra, President Saleh issued a 
statement after his National Defense Council and Higher 
Security Committee meeting calling the 3/21 demonstration 
illegal and condemning the violence.  He also said he would 
not allow unauthorized demonstrations and combined sympathy 
for the Iraqi and Palestinian peoples with the American 
people after 9/11.  Text of statement, as translated by FBIS 
and Embassy, in paragraph 14. 
 
3.  (C)  In a message from Saleh, senior Presidential Advisor 
Mohamed Sudam told the Ambassador that opposition parties 
were responsible for the violence at the demonstration. 
Several parties, including the Iraqi Baathis, Nasserites and 
al-Haq, were involved and a Baathi leader was the first to 
speak at Tahrir Square.  Sudam said that Islah party members 
were also involved at the beginning of the demonstration, but 
\"faded away\" long before the demonstration moved to the area 
near the Embassy and turned violent.  He also said the 
General Prosecutor will investigate and prosecute those 
responsible. 
 
-------------------- 
MinInterior Response 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  DCM, accompanied by Consul and RSO, met with 
Brigadier General Sunaidar, Office Director for the Minister 
of Interior 3/22.  Sunaidar said he will participate in 
questioning those arrested in the demonstrations, starting 
afternoon 3/22.  They will focus initially on those who spoke 
to and stirred up the crowd in order to get the demonstration 
moving.  Sunaidar indicated they do not have a full list yet 
of those arrested, but one of them he identified as a leading 
figure in Yemen\'s relatively small chapter of the Iraqi Baath 
party.  DCM passed Ambassador\'s thanks to the Minister and 
appreciation for Saleh\'s statement.  DCM inferred, in light 
of President\'s remarks, that the authorities will be 
anticipating any further unauthorized demonstrations, and 
that they will be prepared to deal with them more quickly. 
Sunaidar indicated he did not know of express orders to this 
effect, but agreed that indeed it was likely the authorities 
will move quickly to head off unauthorized demonstrators. 
The list of American citizens in Yemen requested by the MOI 
to provide better security was also discussed, and Sunaidar 
requested the list in Arabic which Embassy will provide. 
 
5.  (C)  Sunaidar said that the actions of the security 
forces were their \"duty\" and they were prepared to do it 
again.  In terms of security enhancements, more personnel and 
hardware have been provided and higher restrictions on 
movement instituted.  He also requested assistance from the 
USG in training its riot police on more efficient tactics for 
crowd control, including training for personnel and provision 
of equipment. 
 
6.  (U)  Below the President\'s statement in al-Thawra, an 
article quoting a source from the Ministry of Interior was 
published.  Text of statement, as translated by Embassy, in 
paragraph 15. 
 
------------------------------------- 
After-Midnight MFA Visit: 
Finally Providing Baghdad Coordinates 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (S/NF)  After two months in DIA channels and more than 
three weeks through MFA channels, MFA finally responded to 
Embassy request for more precise information on the Yemeni 
Ambassador\'s residence in Baghdad.  While no one had the GPS 
coordinates, the MFA sent someone who knew Baghdad well to 
the Embassy at 0115 Saturday 3/22 to find the residence. 
After poring over satellite photos for more than 45 minutes, 
the location was pinpointed.  More follow up will be 
conducted if additional maps and photos are obtained. 
 
8.  (S/NF)  The Yemeni Ambassador to Iraq was recalled and is 
in Sanaa, although other Yemeni diplomats remain in the 
Baghdad residence.  Official Saba news agency reported 3/20 
that the Yemeni embassy in Baghdad would remain open to 
provide consular services and assistance to Yemenis wishing 
to return home. 
 
------------------------------- 
Embassy Standing Fast; 
EAC Meeting 1400 local March 22 
------------------------------- 
 
9.  (S)  Embassy personnel remained at StandFast and EAC 
agreed to maintain StandFast at least through an EAC meeting 
on March 23 to assess the situation.  All was quiet during 
the night, and watchstanders detected no untoward activity 
around the perimeter.  ORCA reported no new threats. 
 
10.  (S)  EAC discussed in detail each tripwire that might 
warrant a change in Embassy security posture.  EAC agreed 
that a few tripwires, including killings of Americans, 
demonstrations not controlled by ROYG, mosque sermons 
inciting anti-Americanism, serious Yemeni casualties in the 
suppression of demonstrations and a U.S. attack on an Arab 
country, bear close watch.  EAC members concurred that no 
tripwire has been crossed to date, and that possible 
recurrence of violent demonstrations posed greatest present 
risk of a wire being tripped.  EAC consensus was not to 
recommend a request for authorized departure at this time. 
 
-------------- 
Media Reaction 
-------------- 
 
11.  (U)  Official daily al-Thawra ran President Saleh\'s 
statement and the MOI\'s statement prominently on the front 
page.  Reporting on the demonstration was placed on page 
three and was factual and not inflammatory.  The editorial 
called for \"national responsibility\" to \"confront any 
attempts that might destabilize the internal front.\" 
English-language newspaper Yemen Observer 3/22 did not report 
on the demonstration, concentrating on Iraq and the upcoming 
parliamentary elections. 
 
12.  (U)  International television press, including CNN, 
al-Jazeera and MBC, reported the demonstration and showed 
footage of the 12-year old boy who was killed.  In an 
interview with its Sanaa-based correspondent, Al Jazeera said 
that the security forces showed restraint in responding to 
stonethrowers and small arms fire.  International written 
press reported widely on the violent Sanaa demonstrations, 
although usually as a lead for a lengthier article on 
demonstrations throughout the region and the world. 
 
13.  (C)  CNN has run repeated ticker-line reports and other 
accounts estimating demonstrators at 30,000.  This is a huge 
exaggeration of the 5-7,000 marchers and the 6-800 hard core 
demonstrators who remained to clash with police once violence 
began.

Text of ROYG Statements 
----------------------- 
 
14.  (U)  Text of President Saleh statement: 
 
In the name of God, the most beneficent, the merciful.  The 
holding of this meeting, which includes members of members of 
the National Defense Council and the Higher Security 
Committee comes in the context of addressing ourselves to 
today\'s incident which took place after Friday prayers. The 
incident was accompanied by chaos. The demonstrators headed 
for both the northern and Western region in the direction of 
the U.S. embassy. 
 
The demonstration, with much regret, resulted in the death of 
a number of victims, a child and citizen, and 14 security 
personnel, as well as nine civilians were injured. 
 
We regret this painful incident. We are of the view that the 
people of Yemen had expressed their views in open and clear 
manner in the demonstrations they held last Saturday (15 
March). The demonstrations were held in the capital, Sanaa, 
provincial and some districts headquarters. The 
demonstrations expressed the opinion of the people of Yemen 
and their political stand, at the official (government), 
people\'s and party levels. 
 
We expressed our opinion of objecting to the war against 
Iraq. We also expressed our view regarding what the Arab 
nation of Palestine was facing, ranging from killings, 
terrorism and cleansing. 
 
We consider today\'s incident, as announced through reports by 
the security organs, a violation of the law.   As for today\'s 
incident we consider it as a shortcoming and a disruption of 
national security, despite the fact that government and 
people\'s opinions are in agreement, contrary to other Arab 
countries. 
 
There are three considerations upon which we have expressed 
our position.  We expressed opposition to the war against 
Iraq,  we condemned the torture and terrorism of the people 
of Palestine, and we have condemned the terrorist actions 
which are directed against the United States and directed 
against the nation of Yemen. 
 
In this country, the constitution, law and order govern us. 
Any demonstration by any political group in this country 
should adhere to the law and seek permission. Any political 
group has the right of expressing its opinion peacefully. But 
if it happens that this is unlawful and foolish and if it 
harms the security of the nation, it does not aid anyone 
except the enemies of the nation and does not aid the 
foundation of Yemen. 
 
Regarding the terrible situation in Iraq, this is indeed 
frightful and scary. However, we as Yemenis and as Arab 
Muslims aren\'t the only ones that have been harmed or 
suffered pain. The whole world is harmed by what has resulted 
from this disaster. 
 
We all generally object to the war against Iraq and what the 
Palestinian people are facing. We all condemn terrorist 
activities against the United States of America and against 
our country and against the lands of the Arabs and the 
Muslims and what has happened to the Palestinians. This 
position is agreed upon, by all of us, even those who have 
different views and different politics.

15.  (U)  Text of al-Thawra article quoting MOI source: 
 
A well placed source in the Ministry of Interior told Saba 
news agency that the massive demonstration resulted after 
Friday prayers, did not have permission to conduct a 
demonstration from the Ministry of Interior, thus breaking 
the law. Furthermore, the security forces defended against 
the demonstrations through the march that occurred through 
the streets of the capital that approached the American 
Embassy. The demonstrators were trying to take control of the 
Embassy. 
 
Some riotous elements among the demonstrators concealing arms 
started to fire randomly, a behavior that prompted the 
policemen to fire upward and disperse the crowd with tear gas 
and water hoses. 
 
The source added, \"14 policemen were injured, three 
critically, two demonstrators were killed and nine injured.\" 
The source explained that security authorities managed to 
hold some demonstrators suspected of firing their weapons, 
committing vandalism acts on cars and other properties 
belonging to citizens and they will be brought to court. 
 
And at the end of his presentation, the source encouraged all 
of the brotherly citizens to express their ideas peacefully 
and far from the acts of hooliganism and to govern themselves 
with the order and law that are in the interests of the 
country.

1.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador convened an Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) March 23 to discuss current threat 
information, enhanced security measures and Embassy security 
posture.  EAC decided to move from StandFast to MoveSafe 
effective 3/23 at the close of business.  Key offices and 
personnel represented at the meeting included: AMB, DCM, 
POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, DATT, ORCA, OMC, SOC YEMEN, 
FPD and RMO.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
Current Threat Information 
-------------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  ORCA reported no new threat information.  ORCA 
and RSO reported that the Political Security Organization 
(PSO) and Ministry of Interior had no indications of any 
upcoming planned demonstrations.  ORCA noted that the PSO 
continues to make arrests in relation to the 3/21 
demonstration that turned violent, including a ROYG move to 
ask the Shura Council and Council of Deputies (the upper and 
lower houses of parliament) for a waiver of immunity for two 
of its members, both Nasserite party members involved in 
organizing and inciting the unauthorized demonstration.  DATT 
briefed on developments with the Iraq war. 
 
3.  (C)  EAC discussed what Embassy personnel are hearing 
about popular opinion.  PD reported anecdotal information 
from contacts that Yemeni \"street\" opinion is rising in 
anger. 
 
--------------------------- 
Increased Security Measures 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (S/NF)  RSO briefed EAC on increased security measures. 
Embassy stood down the 24/7 watchstanders.  The location 
where cars are swept outside the compound was changed to be 
farther away from the street.  Embassy employees other than 
cleared Americans will no longer be allowed to park vehicles 
inside the compound.  ROYG security enhancements and 
responses include: 
 
-- providing additional personnel and equipment to guard the 
Embassy, residences and other Amcit locations such as the 
Sheraton Hotel. 
 
-- ensuring that Iraqi agents are under 24-hour surveillance. 
 
-- working with the Embassy to compile a list of expat 
Americans and their contact information to provide extra 
security. 
 
--attempting to manage public opinion through statements and 
the media to avoid violent reaction. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Embassy Change to MoveSafe 3/23 COB 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (S)  EAC decided to alter Embassy\'s security posture from 
StandFast to MoveSafe effective COB 3/23.  MoveSafe entails 
curtailed operations, limited movement from residence to 
Embassy and to essential meetings and travel exclusively in 
armored vehicles.  Despite the end of StandFast, the Embassy 
will not/not be open to provide visa/consular services to the 
public.  Armored vehicle shuttle services began after EAC to 
ensure a well-staggered departure from the Embassy.  FSNs 
will return to work on 3/24 as normal. 
 
----------------------------------- 
No Request for Authorized Departure 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (S)  EAC discussed whether a request should be made to 
move to authorized departure status and deferred making a 
recommendation pending developments.  The issue remains open 
and under active review, and will be discussed further in 
connection with tripwires (particularly the possibility of 
further violent demonstrations in coming days).

1.  (S/NF)  DCM delivered reftel demarches to Chief of the 
Americas Office Abdul-Salam Q. Al-Awadi on 3/24.  Awadi said 
he would convey the U.S. message to FM Qirbi, but offered his 
own \"opinion\" of the ROYG position.  He said that it would be 
very difficult for Yemen to act against Iraq because of their 
long-standing bilateral relations.  He further noted that for 
countries like Jordan and Egypt this type of action would be 
easier because they are closer to the U.S.  Awadi also 
indicated that the ROYG was concerned about Yemeni students 
still present in Iraq, noting that severance of diplomatic 
contacts could restrict the ROYG\'s ability to assist them. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  DCM explained that our request pertained only to 
the Iraqi government, its officials and its missions, and 
that Yemen-Iraq people-to-people relations would obviously 
continue.  Moreover, the impending removal of the Iraqi 
regime would compel the ROYG to address the question of how 
to deal with representatives from Saddam\'s government.  Still 
hesitant, Awadi stated that it would be very difficult to 
change the ROYG position, especially in light of Yemeni 
support for the Iraqi people.

1.  (C) An interpreter for President Salih, Mohamed Sudam, 
phoned Ambassador March 23 to underline that the Yemeni 
government is taking criticism over its stance on the war 
against Iraq.  Sudam cited March 23 remarks of Iraqi VP Taha 
Ramadan, and an editiorial by Al-Quds Al-Arabi\'s 
editor-in-chief Abdul Bari.   (We have been unable to find 
the latter, nor has the local stringer here for Al-Quds.) 
Concurrent with Sudam\'s signal of Yemeni sensitivity, there 
has been a shift in local media coverage (septel). 
 
2.  (U) Here is the Ramadan excerpt -- in which Yemen clearly 
falls in the third category: 
 
\"As for the official Arab stands, they are divided into three 
categories.  I know some Arab rulers will be annoyed by what 
I say.  What I will say applies to the majority and not all 
Arab states.  Here are the three categories.  1. Rulers who 
directly plot and take part in the aggression, like the 
regime in Kuwait.  2.  Rulers who plot and coordinate in 
secret and indirectly or secretly take part in the 
 
SIPDIS 
aggression.  However, their role has started to be exposed. 
The Arab masses started to discover their roles.  I will not 
mention the names of those governments now.  3.  The failing 
rulers who try to prevent their people from protesting the 
aggression.  They ask their masses not to protest except with 
the approval of interior ministers.  If the masses go the 
embassies of aggression, they are confronted with bullets and 
killing.  They convene councils of war and form investigation 
committees and consider those who confront security men as 
plotters against the security of their countries.  They 
pledged to protect the Americans and Zionists in their 
countries and they are ready to launch a war for this sake.\"

Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Yemen media coverage of Operation Iraq 
Freedom and anti-war protests underwent a noticeable shift in 
tone from low-key for several days to more sensationalist 
since March 23.  Initially, it appears that the ROYG 
attempted to down-play media coverage to minimize public 
outrage.  However, criticism of Yemen\'s position by the Iraqi 
Vice President on March 23 has apparently made the ROYG 
anxious to counter accusations of agreeing with the war in 
Iraq.  Reports coming to us from a variety of sources 
indicate that the level of anti-war sentiment among Yemenis 
is on the rise.  The risk of further protest or other violent 
acts remains, although the ROYG has given emphatic assurance 
that Amcits will be protected and further violent 
demonstrations will not be tolerated.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
Low-Key Coverage until March 23 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Local Yemen media coverage gave only sterilized media 
reports on the demonstrations that took place on March 21 and 
the continuing war in Iraq until March 23.  Newspapers and 
local television and radio presented factual reports of 
events, drawing heavily on independent news wire services 
such as AP and Reuters for the content of their information. 
Even newspapers that are notorious for printing 
unsubstantiated and sensational information and are known to 
be anti-American, such as Al-Shumu, reported mostly factual 
information. 
 
3. (U) During the demonstrations on March 21, Yemen radio and 
television did not report on the event until later in the 
evening when the two news outlets reported only factual 
information (Ref A). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Shift in Media Coverage Spurred by Iraqi Statement 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4.  (U) On March 23, al-Jazeera and Yemeni television showed 
a live, televised press conference by the Iraqi Vice 
President.  The Vice President spoke in anger about three 
categories of Arab countries: those that overtly support the 
aggressors, those that are indifferent and those that are 
\"failures.\"  The \"failure\" category included several points 
that clearly referred to Yemen without mentioning it 
specifically.  These included the suppression of public 
opinion through the media, the \"shooting of demonstrators\" 
and the forging of security committees to deal with the 
situation. 
 
5. (U) On March 24, in contrast to previous media reporting, 
the Yemen Times, an independent and usually pro-American 
newspaper, showed a large color photo of the slain boy on its 
front page with a headline reading \"IT\'S WAR\".  Over 80 
percent of the newspaper contains negatively slanted articles 
and editorials regarding U.S. action in Iraq, the negative 
effects of the war on the Yemen economy, worldwide negative 
reaction, photos of private citizens injured in Iraq and 
continued U.S. assistance to Israel. 
 
6. (U) Al-Thawra, an official daily and usually moderate to 
pro-American newspaper, on the afternoon of March 23, printed 
photos of U.S. missiles and bombs used by U.S. led forces in 
the war in Iraq.  One headline carried the rejection to the 
U.S. demand to expel Iraqi diplomats from Yemen.  The March 
24 edition carried an editorial that says \"...The flagrant 
aggression against Iraq...without any legitimate or legal 
justification has made it obvious that its real motives do 
not only target that country (Iraq) but all Arab nations are 
a target.\" 
 
7. (U) Yemen TV and radio have also elevated their tone 
against the war in Iraq.  These reports are much more 
frequent. 
 
--------------------- 
Public Reaction Angry 
--------------------- 
 
8. (C) The ROYG efforts until the shift were overshadowed by 
programming on al-Jazeera that continued to show violent 
images of the war in Iraq and graphic images of the 3/21 
demonstration.  Al-Jazeera showed film footage of the father 
carrying his slain son, both covered in blood. Post believes 
that a large portion of the Yemeni population watches 
al-Jazeera for its news information. 
 
9. (C) We continue to hear Yemenis expressing disdain for 
Saddam and acknowledging the expected benefit of his regime\'s 
removal.  At the same time, information received from several 
sources indicates that popular opposition to the war is 
hardening, and that the risk of violent protest or individual 
violent acts remains significant.  Al-Jazeera broadcast 
images of coalition POWs and KIAs are likely contributing to 
this trend.  One individual said that many Yemenis are 
discussing jihad but more on an individual basis because, in 
his words, more individuals are contemplating acts of 
violence against the U.S.  This correlates with the \"lone 
wolf\" scenario of possible terrorist attacks (Ref B).

1. Sensitive But Unclassified, please protect. 
 
 2. (SBU) Summary: Two World Bank economists in Sanaa are 
complimentary about the ROYG\'s fiscal policy and commitment 
to reforms. In a March 17 discussion with Emboffs, the bank 
economists gave positive assessments of Yemeni fiscal 
discipline, currency management and WTO prospects. End 
Summary. 
 
------------- 
Fiscal Policy 
------------- 
 
3. (SBU) World Bank Senior Economist for Yemen Nadir A. 
Mohammed (please protect throughout) and Economist Mohammed 
Al-Sabbry both have positive forecasts for the Yemeni economy 
despite Yemen\'s per capita income of $460 USG, literacy rates 
of 56 %, and prospects for oil revenues dwindling in the next 
five years.  Nadir said that while they have a huge 
challenge, the Yemenis are on the right track.  Citing five 
billion dollars in foreign reserves, he said the ROYG 
compared favorably to other countries that have spent their 
recently increased oil revenue less wisely. (Note: Yemen 
Central Bank Figures for February report 4.75 Billion USG in 
Reserves. End Note.) Mohammed said that he was impressed with 
the frankness and openness of his Yemeni contacts, and felt 
that the ROYG\'s fiscal policy was sound.  He said that the 
ROYG appears to have learned lessons from 1991 (the first 
Gulf War), and 1994 (the abortive rebellion in the South). 
 
-------- 
Currency 
-------- 
 
4. (U) Nadir also praised the ROYG Central Bank for holding 
firm on its decision to float the riyal.  Nadir\'s point was 
confirmed when on March 19 Pol/Econoff visited Omar S. 
Bazara, the Payment Systems Director of the Yemeni Central 
Bank. He reported that the Central Bank was selling dollars 
to keep the riyal from slipping further on the dollar as a 
result of worries about an attack on Iraq. For the last 
month, the riyal had held firm at 182 riyals to the USG 
dollar, but yesterday the rate had increased to 183 Yemeni 
riyals to the dollar. One of our FSNs reported that same day 
that the black market rate had risen to 186 riyals to the 
dollar. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Yemen\'s Bid to Join the World Trade Organization 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (U) Mohammed was optimistic on the ROYG\'s prospects for a 
faster than average accession to the World Trade 
Organization. He estimated that it could take four to five 
years, less than the average seven to eight years, because 
Yemen\'s neighbors and others are unlikely to press strong 
objections to Yemen\'s candidacy. (Background: In October 
2002, Yemen submitted its Memorandum on Foreign Trade Regime 
to the World Trade Organization. End Background.) 
 
-------------- 
Fishing Rights 
-------------- 
 
6. (U) Mohammed Al-Sabbry said that the Bank was closely 
following USG efforts to improve the capacity of the Yemeni 
Coast Guard and Navy because the illegal harvesting of fish 
has adversely affected the Yemeni fishing industry. 
Specifically, Chinese fishermen take their boats to the Red 
Sea to harvest and process their fish.  According to Nadir 
Mohammed, the Chinese obtain licenses for a lower amount of 
fish, then through bribery of unnamed Yemeni officials, 
vastly exceed their allotment. Fishermen from Egypt, Eritrea 
and Ethiopia also have been over-fishing in Yemeni 
territorial waters.  Al-Sabbry said that Bank experts are 
worried that if Yemen promotes fish exports too heavily, the 
waters might be over fished, damaging a potentially lucrative 
resource for the ROYG. Thus, any effort to improve the 
ability of the ROYG to protect their fishing rights will have 
a direct impact on the local economy. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
Boycott on US/Israeli Products 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) Pol/Econ Chief noticed a sticker pasted onto the front 
door of the Jordanian owned restaurant calling for a boycott 
of American and Israeli products. He wondered aloud in the 
owner\'s presence why the sticker was so prominently 
displayed.  After the meal, Pol/Econ chief noticed that the 
sign had been removed. However, other contacts report mixed 
results for the boycott of US and Israeli goods. The local 
Pepsi distributor told one of our FSNs that he had seen only 
a 10% decline in business in 2002, noting that this decrease 
was much less than Pepsi had felt in other countries. A 
colleague at the British Embassy related a story about taking 
a delegation of nine British security officials to do some 
shopping at a store where a boycott sign was displayed. The 
team made the removal of the sign a condition of doing 
business with the store, but the owner refused to comply and 
the team went elsewhere. 
 
-------- 
Bio Note 
-------- 
 
8. (SBU) Nadir Mohammed said that he was born in the Sudan, 
and received his doctorate in Economics from Cambridge 
University where he also completed his post doctoral studies 
and did some teaching. He has worked at the Islamic 
Development Bank in Washington, and has held jobs with the 
World Bank in Morocco, Ethiopia and Egypt. He expects to 
leave Yemen in the coming year and said he would like an 
assignment in Southeast Asia.

MoveSafe Posture for Non-official Americans 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (S/NF)  PSO Chief Gamish proposed to Ambassador March 24 
that Yemeni security provide escorts to non-official expat 
Americans for any movements they want to make outside their 
home for the duration of the Iraq war.  PSO proposed an 
operations center be established at or near the Embassy, to 
be staffed by PSO, Embassy and MOI personnel, to which Amcits 
could call when escorts are needed.  Ambassador welcomed the 
idea.  RSO, PSO and MOI met on March 25 to discuss 
implementation details and these will continue to be 
discussed.  The arrangement would parallel existing Embassy 
MoveSafe system currently being used by official Americans. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  PSO Chief Gamish also exchanged lists of expat 
Americans in Yemen with Ambassador.  At EAC, CONS reported 
that the list of approximately 40 expat Amcits was 
comprehensive though changing every day as Amcits arrive and 
leave Yemen.

Embassy Security Posture 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C)  Barring any new threats arising, EAC decided to 
change security posture from MoveSafe to StandFast on 
Thursday, March 27 at COB in anticipation of possible 
demonstrations after Friday prayers.  If no demonstrations or 
other threats arise, Embassy personnel would revert to 
MoveSafe posture at COB on Friday 3/28.

Town hall Meeting 3/26: 
Discussion on Possible Authorized Departure 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Ambassador asked EAC members their opinion on 
requesting authorized departure status.  He said that if 
anyone asks that we request it, Post will propose it to the 
Department.  EAC members reported that no one in their 
sections had requested it.  A town hall meeting will be held 
on March 26 for all official Americans to discuss authorized 
departure and to solicit views directly from staff.  Post 
will also hold a warden meeting next week.

1.  (S/NF)  SUMMARY:  On March 26 Italian Ambassador to Yemen 
called on AMB Hull stating that he had information regarding 
an Iraqi plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy on March 27.  Italians 
arranged for an alleged IIS operative responsible for the 
plot to come to Embassy Sanaa for interview by ORCA.  Subject 
was cooperative and provided credible information on the 
planned attack, which he said he did not/not wish to carry 
out.  Embassy arranged with Yemeni Political Security 
Organization for other members of the attack cell, with their 
explosive devices, to be seized evening of 3/26.  Post is 
considering appropriate follow-on security steps. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  On March 26, 2003, at approximately 1700, Italian 
Ambassador to Yemen Giacomo San Felice visited Embassy Sanaa 
and called on AMB Hull.  Ambassador San Felice stated that he 
had information regarding an Iraqi IIS operative who intended 
to bomb the U.S. Embassy the following day, March 27. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Following discussion in a meeting including ORCA, 
DCM and RSO, Italians arranged for the suspected IIS 
operative and a friend to come to Embassy Sanaa.  They 
arrived at approximately 1800.  After thorough security 
screening procedures, they entered the Chancery and were 
separately interviewed by ORCA. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  RSO provided walk-ins\' cellular phones to Embassy 
assets for exploitation.and will forward the information 
separate channel. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  The walk-in claims to be an IIS asset in command 
of an operational cell.  ORCA finds his claim convincing. 
The man stated he had orders to attack Embassy Sanaa using 
multiple IEDs comprised of 6.8 kg of TNT rigged for timed or 
command detonation.  The Iraqi operative stated that the 
explosives were to be delivered in unspecified packages, 
three with timers and two built for detonation by remote 
control.  The cell realized that the explosions would have 
limited physical effect on the well-fortified Embassy, but 
desired a political effect from the attempt.  The cell also 
undertook surveillance of DATT and PAO residence and Egyptian 
consulate.  The individual has agreed to cooperate, terminate 
the attack and turn over cell members and explosives. 
Further details will be provided via ORCA reporting, 
including knowledge of attacks in 11 other countries. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  Based on information provided by the walk-in, 
ORCA arranged with ROYG Political Security Organization (PSO) 
to seize the explosive devices and the three other members of 
the attack cell evening of March 26.  Accordingly, RSO 
believes the attack plan outlined in this report has been 
thwarted. 
 
7. (S/NF)  RSO will brief Embassy security assets to be 
vigilant regarding methods of explosive delivery with use of 
timers or remote control devices.  Post will decide on 
appropriate follow-on security measures.

2.  (C)  ORCA briefed EAC on threat information (ref).  The 
government held a peaceful anti-war demonstration on 3/27 at 
1000 in the center of Sanaa.  It began at Tahrir Square and 
moved to the viewing stands at Old Airport Road 
(approximately 3 miles from Embassy).  Post was informed of 
the demonstration by MOI and PSO on 3/26 and Yemeni 
television announced it last evening.  Post sent a warden

1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  On March 27 at 0145 local, Yemen\'s 
Political Security Organization (PSO) officers arrested three 
members of a terrorist cell and confiscated explosives per 
REFTELS.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF) On the afternoon of 27 March 2003, the Ambassador 
called on PSO Chief Gamish to discuss follow-up to possible 
Iraqi attack plot described in REFTELS.  The PSO Director 
informed Ambassador three suspected IIS operatives were 
arrested by PSO at 0145 on 3/27.  Explosives were also found 
in the house, apparently confirming threat information from 
REFTEL source. 
 
3. (SBU)  RSO considers the post\'s current security 
configuration as appropriate to adequately protect USG 
personnel and facilities while in the \"Stand Fast\" mode. 
Under Stand Fast operations the potential for an attack 
against a \"soft target\" is minimized because movements of 
Embassy officers are restricted to essential movements only 
in a armored vehicle monitored by the RSO with random ROYG 
marked police car escorts. 
 
4. (S/NF) Post has been in a Stand Fast posture since 
receiving the preliminary threat information.  As noted in 
REFTEL A, source indicated that residences of the DAT and 
Public Affairs Officer were to be targeted along with the 
Egyptian Embassy and a local travel agency that works for 
British Airways.  The American Embassy was identified by 
REFTEL source as a surveilled potential target, but was 
dropped from the target list as \"two difficult\".  Source 
indicated that the attack cell intended to throw a small IED 
timed or remote control device over the wall of the selected 
Embassy residences.  RSO notes that such an act would run a 
substantial risk of detection and armed confrontation due to 
perimeter security coverage which includes one armed ROYG 
officer at the front gate, \"as directed\" Surveillance 
Detection activities, PSO spot coverage on the residential 
perimeters, one mobile patrol unit visiting each post three 
times per one eight hour shift, and hourly radio checks with 
one unarmed LGF post on the inside of the each compound. 
 
5. (SBU) U.S. Embassy-related facilities in Sanaa including 
residences have aggressive perimeter and access control 
policies.  Embassy security was recently made more 
restrictive with a new prohibition against Foreign Service 
National\'s parking on the Embassy compound.  Post will be 
reassessing all there arrangements in light of this 
experience, and seek to learn as much as possible from source 
about how U.S.-related sites were surveilled and targets 
chosen.

1.  (C)  Summary:  ROYG is determined to stay ahead of 
regional and Yemeni opinion and maintain its bilateral 
relations with the U.S.  Yemeni leadership continues to 
oscillate between condemnation of the U.S. for the war in 
Iraq and its stated commitment to protect foreigners, 
particularly Americans, and continue CT cooperation in Yemen. 
 End summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
PRE-WAR: A TIME OF RHETORIC 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Prior to the outbreak of hostilities, ROYG, like 
many of its Arab neighbors, expressed its opposition to the 
use of force in Iraq and the importance of Iraqi compliance 
with the inspection regime.  President Saleh, FM Qirbi, and 
other senior officials availed themselves of the media and 
numerous regional and international conferences, including 
the Arab League, OIC, and the NAM summits, to clarify and 
expand upon the ROYG position.  Specifically, FM Qirbi noted 
that the U.S. and its allies should not be hasty in the use 
of military force (ref C), and, on February 8, predicted that 
war in Iraq would \"destabilize the delicate situation\" in the 
region (ref D). 
 
3.  (C)  ROYG organized a series of internal demonstrations 
to signal their support for the people of Iraq, the 
inspection program, and opposition to the use of force. 
Orderly and non-violent, these demonstrations resembled 
political rallies, with pictures of President Saleh rather 
than Saddam. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Privately, the same senior officials 
characterized U.S.-Yemen relations as \"good\" and \"very 
important.\"  Behind closed doors, ROYG officials never 
objected to, and even welcomed, regime change, but were 
concerned about the commencement of hostilities so close to 
Yemen\'s April 27 parliamentary elections and U.S. plans for a 
\"new\" Iraq.  President Saleh positioned himself and his party 
in an effort designed to limit the influence of extremist 
factions, both political and Islamic. 
 
-------------------- 
HOSTILITIES COMMENCE 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  At the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq, ROYG 
statements were low-key and non-confrontational (ref A). 
ROYG called for the cessation of hostilities in Iraq and 
declared ROYG commitment to a peaceful resolution through 
legitimate channels -- namely the UN, the Arab League, and 
the Non-Aligned Movement. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
UNDER PRESSURE FROM GOI, ROYG CHANGES TACK 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C)  ROYG is under diplomatic and media pressure by the 
Iraqi government.  Iraqi VP Taha Ramadan followed his 3/23 
statement (ref B) in which he described Yemen and its 
government as hopeless, with a 3/25 statement (text in para 
10) addressing the Arab regimes who are \"aiding the 
aggressors\", namely Yemen.  Ramadan asked why these regimes 
do not \"demand the closure of the U.S. and British embassies 
instead of killing their own people when they head for these 
embassies to demonstrate\"  -- another direct reference to the 
violent demonstration on 3/21 near U.S. Embassy Sana\'a. 
 
7.  (C)  In a March 25 response President Saleh strengthened 
his previously low-key comments saying \"there is no 
justification for the American and British aggression against 
Iraq, it is against every resolution in international law...\" 
 Saleh also accused the U.S. of allowing Israel to take 
\"advantage of the aggression against Iraq to carry out its 
own terrorism campaign against the Palestinian people.\" 
 
8.  (C)  During a 3/25 meeting between ROYG Speaker of 
Parliament Abdallah Bin-Husayn Al-Ahmar and the Iraqi Charge 
d\'Affaires to Yemen, Husayn Sadiq Khalifa, Al-Ahmar expressed 
what he declared as the attitude of Yemeni leadership, 
government, and people: that the \"Anglo-American aggression\" 
against Iraq is considered aggression against the whole Arab 
and Islamic community.  This is an election year and 
Al-Ahmar\'s comments are similar to statements made by other 
Yemeni officials who are trying to hold on to their 
constituencies in the tide of emotions sweeping the region 
since the beginning of the war.  This tone is also an attempt 
to bolster Yemen\'s Arab and Islamic credentials during this 
time of regional uncertainty. 
 
--------------- 
ULEMA STATEMENT 
--------------- 
 
9.  (C)  In the midst of increasing ROYG rhetoric, the Yemeni 
Ulema (council of religious scholars) released a relatively 
balanced statement after its March 24th session.  The 
meeting\'s stated purpose was \"to review the unjust aggressive 
war that is being waged against the Iraqi Arab and Muslim 
people by the leadership of the United States and its ally 
Britain, and those behind them.\"  The Ulema condemned the 
unjust aggression and called for a boycott of goods from the 
aggressor states, a breaking of the Iraqi blockade, and the 
provision of material and moral support to Iraq and 
Palestine.  However, the last paragraph of their statement 
entreated Yemenis to continue expressing opinions by peaceful 
means and to refrain from damaging public or private 
property, even if it belongs to the citizens of aggressor 
states. 
 
10.  (C)  The Ulema were tapped as leaders of a peaceful, 
government-organized anti-war march on March 27.  This 
reflects Saleh\'s ongoing effort to ensure that the Islamist 
opposition party, Islah, cannot use the war as an electoral 
issue against the ruling party.  The 3/27 march was a 
transparent attempt to pre-empt possible unauthorized 
demonstrations following Friday prayers on March 28.  That 
attempt was successful and there were no demonstrations on 
3/28. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
EXCERPTS OF THE IRAQI VP\'S PRESS CONFERENCE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
11.  (U)  Excerpts from Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin 
Ramadan\'s March 25 news conference: 
 
--  Why do the Arabs supply the aggressors oil to operate 
their war machine?  Why don\'t they stop supplying oil to the 
states of aggression?  Why don\'t they close their airspace 
and land and sea routes to prevent the activities of the 
states of aggression? 
 
--  Why don\'t they demand the closure of the U.S. and British 
embassies instead of killing their own people when they head 
for these embassies to demonstrate?  They defend the safety 
and security of the personnel at the embassies of the 
aggressors but do not give a damn or offer anything to 
protect the safety and security of the Iraqi people.  They 
may not sever diplomatic relations because they are incapable 
of doing so.  But they should tell them:  Withdraw the 
personnel at your embassies because we cannot be responsible 
for their security.

1. (C) Summary: Sanaa FSNs report heightened worry from 
friends and relatives about their working at U.S. Embassy. 
Several expressed concern that they may unwittingly be the 
means to an attack on US personnel or property, and some feel 
that they themselves may become targets because of their 
association with the U.S. Mission. The Ambassador and DCM 
held a meeting with all the FSNs, and several section chiefs 
have met with their FSNs this week to take the pulse on the 
community, which provides a lens with which to view 
unofficial Yemeni reaction to current events. End Summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Connection with U.S. Mission Questioned 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Several FSNs reported that their spouses, children, 
extended family and friends had expressed heightened concern 
about their working for the American Embassy and coming to 
work this week. They were particularly worried about 
Thursday, March 27th, the first day of the weekend after the 
March 21st violent demonstration.  Many thought that 
demonstrations could begin that afternoon and several 
supervisors were approached concerning Embassy closure that 
day. (Note: Embassy Sanaa did move to StandFast on March 27 
because of a government sponsored demonstration which was 
peaceful and uneventful. No demonstrations were held on March 
28. End Note.) Other FSNs told us that they do not express 
their political views among friends and family, and in some 
cases try not to speak of their association with the Embassy. 
 In one case, a third country FSN who may have been mistaken 
for an American had rocks thrown at her by children on the 
way to the Embassy. 
 
---------------------------- 
Fears of Violence Increasing 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) One FSN reported going to \"Al-Aql\" mosque on Friday, 
March 21 and said that he would not have been surprised if 
worshipers had committed violence had the Imam called on them 
specifically to do so. He said people were very upset, and 
the Imam had compared US actions to the Mongols sacking 
Baghdad. Another FSN in a different section reported that he 
felt that the average person may be increasingly inclined 
towards violence.  He added that the anger is still there, it 
is just not being expressed.  FSNs also reported feeling more 
vulnerable in their commutes to and from the Embassy, fearing 
that they may be watched and could be targeted for their 
association with post. 
 
------------------- 
Work Relationships 
------------------- 
 
4. (C) Some working relationships with ROYG officials and 
other Yemeni contacts, according to several FSNs in different 
sections, have broken down.  Requests for information have 
been put off, or delayed, and some are feeling some backlash. 
Pol/Econ FSNs requested that we hold off on making new 
appointments right now due to political sensitivities. 
However, one of the development FSNs reported that this 
contacts at the Ministry of Health actively encouraged U.S. 
development activities to proceed at full speed in order to 
complete projects already underway. 
 
5. (C) Supervisors have been extremely impressed with our 
FSN\'s sense of loyalty and committment to the mission.  Post 
affirms that while some of the external working relationships 
may have cooled, we have not seen any such reaction from our 
FSN employees. FSNs have been working at home during 
temporary Embassy closures, worked weekends to feed staff 
quartered in the Embassy, and provided valuable information 
while security procedures have curtailed much outside 
activity for the American community. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Reaction to Increased Security Measures for FSNS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador met with FSNs on March 25 to discuss 
new security concerns and to gauge public reaction to the war 
in Iraq.   The Ambassador listened to all of their concerns 
and assured our FSNs that their concerns were being addressed 
and the FSNs were an integral part of the Mission team.  New 
security procedures (Ref cable) involve increased screening 
for FSNs entering the building and moving FSN parking outside 
of the Embassy compound.  One FSN said, \"I don\'t care if they 
check me seven or eight times, security is for everyone.\" On 
March 26, Ambassador walked the Embassy perimeter with RSO, 
FSN committee representatives and Central Security 
Organization (CSO) on-site commander. A useful security 
exercise, it also served as a morale booster for our FSNs who 
work inside the Embassy, our Local Guard Force (LGF) and the 
CSO soldiers assigned to protect us. 
 
7. (C) Comment: With heightened security procedures for 
American personnel limiting our outside contacts, post has 
become more reliant upon the information provided by our 
FSNs. This summary of their experiences provides a glimpse 
into the mood of Sanaa. End Comment.

Classified By: DCM Alan Misenheimer for reasons E.O. 12958, 1.5 (b), (c 
) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Although the tone of the Yemeni State owned 
and operated media was subdued in the first few days of the 
war, it has become more strident with developments in the 
theater of war as well as in the wake of increasing protests 
in yemen and the Arab world. Nevertheless, state-controlled 
media have not emphasized visuals of civilian casualties. 
Ambassador has urged Foreign Minister to promote balance in 
coverage. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Coverage in the Yemeni State owned and controlled 
media, consisting of several dailies and weeklies and the 
only television station in the country (Yemen-TV) was very 
controlled and cautious in the first few days of the 
beginning of the Iraq campaign.  However, following the 
bloody demonstrations near the American Embassy on Friday 21, 
2003, and Iraqi VP Ramadan\'s thinly-veiled criticism of 
Yemen\'s position, there has been a noticeable shift in the 
volume and tone of coverage (see ref. D).  Friday\'s violent 
demonstration was reported factually only late that night on 
Yemen TV and the official Al-Thawra daily did not even 
display photographs on its first page the next day. On the 
other hand, both media as well as other state newspapers 
carried long and prominent reports on a subsequent peaceful 
demonstration on Thursday, March 27th, at Sanaa\'s central 
square.  Yemen TV had a 20-minute coverage of the event, 
compared to its cursory coverage of the violent demonstration 
a week prior. 
 
3. (C) All government dailies and weeklies, in coverage 
articles, editorials and op-ed pieces, have been using such 
strident terms as \"Aggression against Iraq\", \"Unjustified 
aggression\", \"Agression against Iraq is agression against 
humanity\", \"A war without bases in international law\", \"We 
deplore the fall of innocent victims\", \"The new Vietnam War\" 
and the like. Coverage of the war and various opinion 
articles cover almost half the number of pages of some of the 
dailies.  However, it is important to note that both State 
television and the printed media are not using the 
sensational pictures of civilian casualties nor the 
photographs of slain coalition soldiers.  TV text is often 
more strident than the pictures that run with it.  Very 
often, we get footage of coalition forces in action with a 
text that is totally irrelevant to what is being shown. 
Yemen radio, which is also State owned and controlled, has 
been following the lead of television and the official 
papers. 
 
4. (C) In a meeting with Foreign Minister Qirbi Saturday, 
March 29, the Ambassador raised the issue of media coverage. 
Ambassador told the FonMin the U.S. has no interest in 
targeting civilians since our strategy is to distance 
Saddam\'s regime from the Iraqi population.  In fact, said the 
Ambassador, coalition forces have been taking great pains to 
avoid civilian casualties.   By contrast, the Ambassador 
noted, the Iraqis seem to be firing on civilians who are 
trying to flee conflict areas.  The Ambassador also noted 
that coalition forces are now making a huge effort to provide 
humanitarian relief to the population of Iraqi regions now 
under their control. He asked Dr. Qirbi to promote a balanced 
approach by ROYG, both in statements and in official coverage 
of events in the conflict. 
 
5. (C) For his part, Foreign Minister Qirbi said that he 
feels that U.S. SecDef Rumsfeld\'s finger pointing at Syria 
and Iran were counterproductive.  He said such issues should 
be addressed in diplomatic channels, not publicly.  Moreover, 
said Qirbi, these public remarks give ammunition to those who 
predict a U.S. invasion of Syria and/or Iran, after Iraq is 
done. 
 
6. (C) Comment: The increase in the stridency of tone and 
content in the Yemeni official media could be a direct 
consequence of the rising anger in the Yemeni populace that 
was expressed in the bloody confrontation of the March 21 
demonstration and that is continuing to be expressed 
peacefully in subsequent demonstrations.  Demonstrations in 
other Arab capitals and cities also seem to be fueling this 
stridency as Yemenis attempt \"to keep up with the Joneses.\" 
Of more significance however, are the graphic reports from 
Al-Jazeera and other broadcasts.

1.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador convened an Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) meeting on March 30 to assess Embassy 
security posture and threat information.  Key offices and 
personnel represented at the meeting included: ADMIN, AMB, 
CONS, DCM, FPD, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, RMO and SOC YEMEN. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  ORCA and RSO reported no new threats.  DCM 
briefed on authorized departure procedures. 
 
3.  (C)  EAC decided to go to a \"MoveSafe Lite\" posture 
effective close of business March 30.  EAC decided to change 
its security posture from MoveSafe to more normal operations 
in the absence of new threat information and given the lack 
of large violent demonstrations in the last several days. 
EAC members deemed it essential to adopt a flexible approach 
-- adjusting security measures in response to changing threat 
conditions -- in order to sustain full compliance of 
employees with security conditions throughout the war in 
Iraq, no matter how long it lasts.  Employees are encouraged 
to continue using the armored shuttles, but are allowed to 
drive their own vehicles if they wish to and from work. 
Travel outside of Embassy and residence will remain at the 
discretion of the COM and RSO and be severely limited. 
 
4.  (C)  Consular services will be provided on a limited 
basis during a gradual return to a pre-StandFast level of 
operations.  Immigrant visa applications and American 
passport services will be provided on an appointment-only

INDIA 
 
1.  (U) This is an action request.  See para 5. 
 
2.  (SBU) According to the Yemeni Foreign Ministry, the State 
Bank of India has, at USG request, adopted restrictions 
affecting the ability of the Yemeni Embassy in New Delhi to 
transfer funds abroad.  Abdul Salaam Al-Awadhi, Director of 
the Two Americas Department at the MFA in Sanaa, convoked the 
DCM March 31 to raise this problem and request our assistance 
in clarifying and resolving it. Al-Awadhi, acting upon 
instructions of FM Al-Qirbi in making this demarche, added 
that the Yemeni Embassy in New Delhi had informed Sanaa of 
this problem about a week ago. 
 
3.  (SBU) Al-Awadhi said the Yemeni Embassy had made 
inquiries at the Indian Foreign Ministry and was told that 
the Indian MFA had not conveyed any instructions or 
information to the State Bank of India vis-a-vis the Yemeni 
Embassy.  Asked if the Yemeni Embassy had contacted the U.S. 
Embassy in New Delhi, Al-Awadhi replied that his report from 
New Delhi made no mention of this.  He added that the 
restriction by the State Bank of India is causing problems 
for personnel at the Yemeni Embassy and for Yemeni students 
in India.  DCM said that Embassy Sanaa had received no 
information from Washington or New Delhi about this issue, 
and would report the problem and request a response. 
 
4.  (SBU) Al-Awadhi provided a \"non-paper\" that he said 
summarized the report Sanaa had received from its Embassy in 
New Delhi.  Following is our unofficial translation: 
 
Begin text:  The Embassy of the Yemeni Republic in New Delhi 
has reported that the State Bank of India, with which the 
Embassy has dealings, has informed it that it is not 
permitted for (the Embassy) to transfer any amounts outside 
of India -- except through the Embassy\'s official account or 
through the personal accounts of the two (Embassy) 
representatives, without a statement of the purpose of the 
transfer, for example, the name of the person or agency, and 
the nature of the connection or relationship, and the reason 
for the transfer.  The Embassy contacted the director of the 
above-mentioned bank and was informed that this measure was 
undertaken based upon a request from the government of the 
United States of America.  End Text. 
 
5.  (U) Action Request: We would appreciate Department 
assistance in obtaining information, from Treasury and/or 
Embassy New Delhi, with which we can respond to the Yemeni 
request.

SUBJECT: YEMEN\'S ECONOMY: THINKING BEYOND OIL 
 
Classified By: Political/Economic Officer Jill E. Hutchings, for reason 
s 1.5 B. and D. 
 
 1. (C) Summary: A forthcoming World Bank sectoral analysis 
of fish, transportation, tourism and labor markets is a 
potential road map for donor projects and steps that the ROYG 
must take in order to diversify and strengthen Yemen\'s 
economy.  The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study examines 
four potential sources of revenue that could make up the 
difference of a projected 30% loss to GDP when oil reserves 
run dry in the next twenty years. End Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) The Integrated Framework Program of the World Bank 
will present to the Ministry of Industry and Trade this month 
a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study on four sectors of the 
Yemeni economy: fisheries, transportation, tourism and labor. 
The following is a summary of the report\'s major findings on 
the four sectors with information about under-reported 
aspects of the Yemeni economy. 
 
--------- 
FISHERIES 
--------- 
 
3. (C) The fishing industry is the second largest export for 
the ROYG behind oil, employing 42,000 people and supporting 
250,000 dependents. In 2001, the ROYG earned $70 million in 
revenue from the export of fish, contributing 2% to GDP. 
While there are several prospects for expanding this market, 
the report warns against rapid expansion that would deplete 
fish stocks. 
 
4. (C) According to the study, Yemeni fish exports are unable 
to receive adequate prices in foreign markets because 
fishermen are unable to maintain the quality of their 
product.  Inadequate storage on boats, transport delays, and 
poor quality control all contribute to a decline in the price 
exporters receive for Yemeni fish.  The most pointed example 
of this problem is the fact that most of the fish bound for 
European markets is shipped out of Sanaa, a four to six hour 
drive from most ports.  Once in Sanaa, exporters rely on 
Yemenia Airlines, whose flight schedule is unreliable and 
ill-equipped to ship large stocks of frozen fish.  In 
response, the World Bank is investing in a project to upgrade 
al-Rayyan airport near Mukallah to allow for more direct 
shipment routes from Yemen. 
 
5. (C) The report also encourages the ROYG to establish a 
Fisheries Council to effectively monitor fish resources 
because, according to the World Bank, the Ministry of 
Fisheries is not adequately staffed or resourced to handle 
its required role. The ROYG is considering, and the Bank 
recommends, privatization of the General Corporation for Fish 
Services and Marketing (CFC), that manages landing slips and 
fish auctions, as a way to raise the standards of quality 
control and fish processing. 
 
-------------- 
Transportation 
-------------- 
 
6. (C) Yemen has one of the lowest percentages of paved roads 
in the World (comparable to Niger and Rwanda); therefore 
enhancement of the transport sector is vital to broader 
economic development. The sectoral analysis also notes that 
80% of the Yemeni population live in isolated, rural 
communities and that road injuries cost the ROYG 1-3% of GDP. 
 According to the report, women are not attending school and 
entering the workforce because the existing public 
transportation is not considered appropriate for their use. 
 
7. (C) The chapter on transportation also strongly recommends 
that the ROYG improve port management.  Such improvements are 
necessary because there is increasing competition for the 
Port of Aden. The port managers of Jebel Ali in Dubai are 
beginning to invest heavily in Djibouti, adding more 
competition for the Port of Aden, which has been already seen 
much of its traffic move to Jeddah and Sallalah after the 
October 2002 attack on the French tanker Limburg. 
 
------- 
Tourism 
------- 
 
8. (C) Tourism in Yemen has vast potential and many hurdles, 
including inadequate hotels, few flights from European 
markets, and fears about security. Nevertheless the sector 
may still become a significant contribution to the Yemeni 
economy. The tourism sectoral analysis states that in 2001, 
tourism accounted for 1.7% of GDP and employed 14,000 people. 
 After September 11, 2001, tourism decreased by 80%.   The 
biggest area identified for growth was adventure tourism. 
The World Bank recommends increased investment in and 
improvement of rest houses (hotels aimed at tourists) in 
tourism regions, and encouraging conservation efforts which 
could in turn attract more tourists. 
----- 
Labor 
----- 
 
9. (C)  In 2001, remittances from foreign workers amounted to 
1.2 billion USD, bringing in more foreign currency than oil 
revenues. In 1999, for example, the report states that oil 
revenue was 967 million USD.  The importance of remittances 
is compounded by high domestic unemployment. The 2000 five 
year plan by the ROYG estimated that unemployment was around 
25%, and the Yemen Center for Studies and Research estimates 
that unemployment in 2000 was about 50.3 % of the labor 
force.  (Note: The ROYG\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
states that the unemployment rate is about 11.5% of the labor 
force.) Comment: Despite large statistical discrepancies, 
clearly unemployment is a huge challenge for the ROYG. End 
Comment. 
10. (C) Female employment, however, continues to grow at a 
rate of about ten percent a year. In 2000, there were nearly 
one million females employed in Yemen. The number of female 
graduates also increased by 189% in ten years with 3,759 
female graduates in 2,000. The number of women registered at 
universities increased by 153% in ten years to 34,994 in 
2000. 
 
11. (C) According to the report, Yemen\'s continued population 
growth will greatly impact its prospects for continued 
economic development. In 2001, 7.8 million (50%) of the 
population were of working age; by 2016, 16.5 million people 
will be of working age.  The World Bank study recommends that 
for the ROYG to find jobs for a doubled work force, it must 
improve its foreign direct investment climate. Furthermore, 
the study encourages the ROYG to expand agreements with other 
countries to increase the number of Yemeni guest workers 
employed in other countries. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (C) Comment: The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study 
prepared by the World Bank for the Ministry of Industry and 
Trade does not explicitly state that its goal is to find 
non-oil revenue sources. However, economists are well aware 
that barring any new discoveries, there is less than twenty 
more years of oil output for Yemen. Planning has clearly 
begun by donor agencies and the Ministry of Industry and 
Trade to find new sources of revenue to compensate for the 
expected loss of oil revenue, which presently accounts for 
32% of Yemen\'s GDP. This report has already served as the 
basis for some of Posts\' planning on how to prioritize future 
development assistance.  Our contacts at the World Bank have 
asked that we keep the analysis confidential until its 
release at the end of April. End Comment.

TAGS: PTER, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM 
SUBJECT: REPORTS OF AL-QAIDA ARRESTS IN YEMEN 
 
Classified By: DCM: AGMISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (U) Eleven persons with suspected links to the al-Qaida 
terror network, including two of the Yemeni government\'s 
most-wanted terror suspects, have been arrested in various 
parts of Yemen, according to an April 1 Associated Press 
report datelined Sanaa.  Citing a Yemeni security official, 
AP reported that the eleven suspects are now detained in the 
intelligence prison in Sanaa, and that the two most-wanted 
suspects were arrested last week, but further details were 
not available. 
 
2.  (S/Noforn) The two \"most-wanted suspects\" referenced in 
the AP report in all likelihood are Fawaz al-Rabai\'e (aka 
Furqan) and Hamza al-Majali, and ORCA has reported in its 
channels about their recent arrests by Yemeni authorities. 
Identities of the remaining nine suspects, as well as timing 
and circumstances of their arrests are unclear.  The Yemenis 
may have arrested nine new individuals recently; it is just 
as plausible that these \"nine\" could represent a Yemeni spin 
on their combined total of successful moves against specific 
Al-Qaida individuals over some recent period, or perhaps even 
since August 2002. 
 
3.  (C) We have no doubt that the AP report was generated by 
sources close to President Salih, likely either Mohamed Sudam 
or Fares Sanibani.  Its purpose was to underline -- for 
anyone to see -- that the ROYG remains firmly committed to 
the pursuit of Al-Qaida terrorists in Yemen (which is clearly 
perceived both in Yemen and across the region as a joint CT 
effort with the USG), notwithstanding ROYG views regarding 
the war with Iraq.

REF: SANAA 661 (NODIS) 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer, for reasons 1.5 ( 
b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  The Charge convened an Emergency Action Committee 
(EAC) meeting on April 6 to assess threat information and 
discuss Sheraton security in light of concerns expressed by 
President Saleh April 5 (reftel).  Key offices and personnel 
represented at the meeting included: ADMIN, Charge, CONS, 
DAO, FPD, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, RMO and SOC YEMEN. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  ORCA reported no new specific threat information. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  EAC discussed Sheraton Hotel security (currently 
home to 24 Embassy TDY personnel, nearly all of whom are 
military).  President Saleh April 5 asked Charge if Embassy 
would consider removing its personnel from the Sheraton Hotel 
to the Embassy for the duration of the war in Iraq.  He cited 
no specific threat information, which was corroborated by PSO 
Chief Gamish.  Saleh brought subject up in a matter of fact 
manner, and Gamish asked Charge to \"think about it.\" 
 
4.  (S)  On April 6, RSO raised Sheraton security with MOI 
second-in-command BG Ahmed Sunidar.  RSO asked if ROYG was 
aware of any threat to the hotel, and whether MOI saw cause 
to consider relocating to another location during the Iraq 
war.  Sunidar expressed surprise at the idea that the 
Americans saw a need to depart the Sheraton Hotel.  Sunidar 
had no threat related information regarding the Sheraton 
Hotel and, because of the line of questions, asked if the 
Embassy had any knowledge of a threat.  Sunidar went on to 
list reasons that the Sheraton Hotel was the best most secure 
choice, which included recent physical security upgrades, 
best utilization of MOI security assets, and close proximity 
to the American Embassy which reduced the time and distance 
Embassy employees were exposed as soft targets while driving 
to and from work.  (Note:  Sunidar was the ranking ROYG 
official at a recent working lunch, also attended by DCM and 
RSO, in which on-site security arrangements were discussed in 
great detail with the Sheraton management.  The ROYG has been 
cooperative and forward-leaning in upgrading hotel security 
over past months.  End Note.) 
 
------------------------ 
Saleh\'s Possible Reasons 
------------------------ 
 
5.  (S)  EAC discussed possible reasons for Saleh\'s 
suggestion, including: 
 
--  uneasiness on Saleh\'s part that security is not solely 
provided by the ROYG at the Sheraton; 
 
--  non-specific threat information that he is unwilling to 
divulge; 
 
--  commercial reasons possibly relating to the Sheraton; 
 
--  an unclear understanding on the part of Saleh of the 
comprehensive security measures in place at the Sheraton (in 
contrast to the perfunctory measures in place at Tourist 
City); 
 
-- desire on Saleh\'s part to appear to be \"doing something\" 
to ensure Amcit security. 
 
EAC members lacked sufficient information to draw any 
conclusions about Saleh\'s reasoning.  They agreed that a) it 
could not be ignored but b) was hard to understand and 
impossible to justify on strict security grounds -- 
particularly in the absence of specific threat information. 
 
-------------------- 
Comparative Security 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (S)  EAC members discussed the security provisions at the 
Sheraton Hotel, security at other possible locations and the 
ramifications of a change, noting the following: 
 
-- following numerous security upgrades in recent months, the 
Sheraton is the second-hardest target in Yemen after the 
Embassy; 
 
--  when specific threat information was known in late 2002 
about possible vehicle-borne attacks against hotels in Sanaa 
and Aden, the EAC assessed all available options and decided 
that the Sheraton remained preferable to any alternative 
housing site(s); 
 
--  comprehensive security measures at the Sheraton include 
1)  equipment such as drop barriers able to stop vehicles 
going up to 40MPH and metal detectors, 2)  personnel 
well-trained in using all equipment and 3)  procedures that 
are in place and working well; 
 
--  other possible locations such as Tourist City near the 
Embassy are much less secure, with the possibility of 
vehicle-borne threat at a much higher level; 
 
--  wide dispersal of personnel to other locations throughout 
Sanaa would stress the capability of the ROYG to protect them; 
 
--  removing personnel from the Sheraton could degrade their 
security posture and make it difficult to raise the level of 
Sheraton security again after the Iraq war ends. 
 
-------------------------- 
Suggested Embassy Response 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  (S/NF)  EAC members decided to respond to Saleh\'s 
concerns by doing the following: 
 
--  using existing ROYG channels via ORCA and RSO to pursue a 
dialogue on the issue; 
 
--  offering to brief appropriate ROYG officials, perhaps 
including the President, on details of Sheraton security with 
a comparison of the poorer security offered by other options; 
 
--  telling ROYG that the Embassy is considering the issue 
seriously, reassessing Sheraton security, actively seeking 
options that would provide comparable or superior security to 
that provided at the Sheraton, and minimizing official Amcit 
presence at the Sheraton and in Yemen as a whole; 
 
-- re-doubling Embassy\'s focus on Sheraton security to ensure 
that equipment, security personnel and equipment continue in 
top working order; 
 
--  putting the onus back on the ROYG to tell Embassy of any 
places that might be more secure than the Sheraton and of any 
possible threats immediately.

SUBJECT: YEMEN: CURBING VOLUNTEERS FOR IRAQ 
 
REF: SANAA 661 
 
Classified By: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES: AGMISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND D 
. 
 
1.  (C) BEGIN SUMMARY:  Yemeni volunteers are being 
discouraged by the ROYG from joining the Iraqis in fighting 
against the coalition, although some volunteers will probably 
continue to make their way to Baghdad from intermiediate 
stops in Damascus and Amman.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) The Yemeni government in recent days has taken steps 
to dissuade its citizens who wish to become \"volunteer\" 
fighters in Iraq.  President Salih told Charge (reftel) April 
5 that the flow of volunteers from Yemen -- as many as thirty 
thousand, Salih claimed -- has been stopped.  Wire stories 
also are reporting that Yemeni authorities are preventing 
local volunteers from going to Baghdad to join the fight 
against coalition forces. 
 
3.  (C) TDY Pol/Econ Counselor April 5 called on one of 
Foreign Minister Al-Qirbi,s aides, Abdel Hakim Al-Iryani, to 
underline USG views about Yemeni \"volunteers\" who may seek to 
join Iraqi forces in fighting against the coalition. 
Pol/Econ counselor noted we are expressing our view in 
various Arab capitals that the safety of such volunteers is a 
responsibility of their respective governments, and in the 
event that volunteers join the fighting, they will be 
considered as hostile elements.  He added that the whole 
world had seen, on an Arab TV network that last week still 
had correspondents in Iraq,  a large group of young men in 
Baghdad, identified as Yemeni volunteers, waving rifles and 
shouting pro-Saddam slogans. 
 
4.  (C) Smiling at the reference to Al-Jazeera, Al-Iryani 
said its correspondents have resumed working in Iraq.  He 
added a \"personal view\" that the Yemenis in Baghdad who were 
shown on Al-Jazeera had not in fact made the trip to Iraq for 
the purpose of volunteering, but were drawn by the Iraqis 
from a rather substantial number of pro-Baathi Yemenis 
already in the country.  He suggested that the sympathies of 
such Yemenis were already clear. 
 
5. (C) Marking further ROYG distance from sponsorship for 
volunteers, Al-Iryani said  that Yemeni authorities had in 
recent days stopped more than forty would-be volunteers from 
leaving Yemen, once it was confirmed that their purpose was 
to volunteer.  Opposition parties are sniping at the 
government over this, he added.  The difficulty for the 
Yemeni government, he said, was in determining the motives of 
travelers.  There is a large number of Yemeni travelers going 
to Damascus and Amman all the time, and the ROYG cannot 
effectively sort out who is really going to volunteer -- but 
if it finds out that is their purpose, they will be stopped. 
 
6. (C) Pol/ECON Counselor said that US-Yemeni cooperation in 
fighting terrorism in continuing despite differing 
perspectives of our governments about the war in Iraq.  It 
would be unfortunate if some Yemeni volunteers were killed as 
a result of engagement in hostilities in Iraq, and more 
unfortunate if this led to unhappy families or vengeful 
tribes who might take actions in Yemen contrary to our mutual 
interests.  Referring to the volunteers, Al-Iryani replied 
simply: They made their own choice. 
 
7.  (C) COMMENT: We are unable to estimate the number of 
would-be Yemeni volunteers, but Salih\'s thirty thousand 
figure (reftel) no doubt is hyperbole.  It is noteworthy that 
the ROYG is actually stopping some volunteers, and to some 
extent exposing its Arab flanks to opposition critics in 
doing so.  As Al-Iryani pointed out, however, some Yemeni 
travelers may still be finding their way to Baghdad, via 
Damascus and Amman, without the ROYG\'s blessing or 
protection.

SUBJECT: ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAW SIGNED, ENFORCEMENT 
QUESTIONED 
 
Classified By: Classified by CDA Alan G. Misenheimer for reasons 1.5 b. 
 and d. 
 
1. Summary: President Saleh signed the ROYG\'s anti-money 
laundering legislation into law on April 5. The law was 
written in consultation with the World Bank. While not 
specifically mentioning terrorism, the law criminalizes money 
laundering for the first time and requires banks to verify 
names of their account holders.  One local banking official 
credits the law as a solid first step, but has strong 
concerns about the Central Bank\'s ability to enforce it. The 
Central Bank has recently intervened to shore up the sagging 
riyal. End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Anti-Money Laundering Law Passed 
-------------------------------- 
 
 2. (U) The official newspaper al-Thawra ran a front page 
story announcing that President Saleh signed Law 35 of 2003, 
the Anti-Money Laundering Law, on April 5.  The new law 
requires banks to verify the names and documents of account 
holders and criminalizes money laundering. To coordinate 
enforcement and unify reporting procedures, the law 
establishes a committee composed of members of the banking 
community and representatives from the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs and Finance under the oversight of the Central Bank. 
The law also encourages international cooperation, 
facilitates information exchange with other nations, and 
includes provisions allowing the extradition of non-Yemenis 
convicted under the law. (Note: Yemeni law does not allow for 
the extradition of Yemeni citizens.) 
 
3. (U) According to press reports, the law defines money 
laundering as the illegitimate hiding of revenue generated 
from such crimes as kidnapping, drug smuggling, and illegal 
arms trade. The law does not specifically mention terrorism, 
but many of the acts associated with the funding of terrorism 
would be covered by this law. Those convicted of money 
laundering could face up to five years in prison and 
confiscation of any assets used illegally.  Ibrahim 
Al-Nahari, Director of External Relations at the Ministry of 
Finance, who had flown to Washington last December to discuss 
provisions of the law with the World Bank, told Pol/Econoff 
that all of the Bank\'s suggestions were incorporated into the 
law. 
 
----------- 
Enforcement 
----------- 
 
4. (C) Regional Manager of the Arab Bank in Yemen, Mahdi 
Alawi (please protect), called the new money laundering law a 
good step forward in the evolution of banking in Yemen. 
Noting that the Arab Bank already follows many of the 
provisions under the law because it makes good business 
sense, he said this law will force domestic banks in Yemen to 
know their customers -- a practice, he said, that is not 
common in Yemen. 
 
5. (C)  Government ministries and organizations are mandated 
by law to use the Yemen Central Bank for accounting and money 
disbursal.  According to Alawi, former Prime Minister Abdul 
Karim Al-Iryani guided this restriction into law, hoping that 
the government would have more control over transactions. 
However, Alawi said, the exact opposite has happened, and 
there is less control over the way the Ministries spend their 
funds because the Central Bank is unable to investigate 
discrepancies and has no financial intelligence operation to 
review unjust accounting practices. 
 
------------------------------ 
Transparency Laws Still Needed 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) An even greater problem, according to Alawi, is that 
Ministers and other high-ranking officials are allowed to 
have personal accounts in banks and are not required to 
report their financial holdings to the government or the 
public. (Comment: This problem will likely persist because 
the anti-money laundering law has no provision for financial 
reporting by government officials. End Comment.)  Alawi said 
that the corruption in Yemen involves small amounts of money, 
and that Yemen compared favorably to what he saw in Nigeria. 
However, he cautioned, in the banking industry, misuse of 
small funds is even harder to discover and report to 
regulatory officials. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Central Bank\'s Fiscal Policy is Sound 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Alawi praised the Central Bank\'s tight control of 
fiscal policy, noting positively that the recent injection of 
approximately fifty million USD to keep the riyal strong 
against selling related to fears the Yemeni economy would be 
hurt as the war in Iraq began.  However, he noted that the 
Central Bank was walking a fine line between keeping the 
currency stable and market pressures that are pushing the 
riyal down. Alawi expects that the riyal will drop slightly 
in the coming year because most experts, including the 
Economist Intelligence Unit, expect economic growth to slow 
because of an expected drop in the price of oil. 
 
8. (C) Comment: The Anti-Money Laundering law is a 
significant step forward for the Republic of Yemen.  However, 
enforcement issues will be the true test of Yemeni commitment 
to having a well-regulated banking industry. Colleagues in 
the banking industry and at the World Bank have praised the 
Central Bank for its tight control of fiscal policy.  The 
next question is if they will be given the means and 
authority to enforce the new law. Yemen has a pattern of 
passing laws that are generally praised by the international 
community, but falls short on enforcement. End Comment.

SUBJECT: PROMINENT OPPOSITION BUSINESSMAN\'S VIEWS ON ROYG 
ECONOMY 
 
 
Classified By: Classified by CDA Alan G. Misenheimer for 
reasons 1.5 B. and D. 
 
1. (C) Summary: A prominent businessman believes civil 
service reform is the most important change that the Yemeni 
government must make to stem corruption.  According to Islah 
party member and leading banking figure Mahfoodh Salem 
Shammakh, attempts by the government, World Bank and other 
lending agencies to reform the civil service have yet to 
force the ROYG to take tough decisions such as laying off 
workers and raising salaries. Shammakh also offered his views 
on Yemeni education and the effects of qat on the economy. 
End Summary 
 
2. (C) Mahfoodh Salem Shammakh, Director of Shammakh and 
Company, cofounder of the Yemeni Commercial Bank, and 
prominent Islah Party moderate, outlined his ideas for 
reforming the Yemeni economy, including civil service reform, 
education overhaul, and land use reform. Shammakh is from 
Hadrawmaut, educated in Aden and a member of several economic 
committees, including the Ministry of Industry and Trade\'s 
World Trade Organization accession advisory committee and the 
Sanaa Chamber of Commerce. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Laws Help, but Civil Service Reform is Real Solution 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3. (C)  Shammakh supported passage of the anti-money 
laundering law by the Yemeni parliament, while acknowledging 
that his own accounting procedures may become more 
complicated. Shammakh explained that his sugar business 
suffered when a Lebanese merchant sold sugar in Yemen at 
below market price, but accounted for the sugar at the 
regular price, effectively laundering his money and harming 
Shammakh\'s own sugar sales. Shammakh said acts like this may 
be curtailed by the law, and his businesses may do better. 
 
4. (C) Shammakh concluded saying, \"the law will never be 
implemented.\" Shammakh contended that tribes make too much 
money smuggling drugs and antiquities to allow for effective 
implementation.  He claimed that many of the tribes were 
smuggling Jewish texts out of the country, and in one 
instance a dealer in Singapore was willing to pay 15 million 
USD (sic) for a piece of ancient Hebrew scripture.  For the 
tribes, this was too much money to forego and after a few 
attempts to enforce the law, the government, he believes, 
will lose interest in enforcement. Corruption by individuals 
in the government, he added, could be stopped, but civil 
service reform was the only solution. 
 
5. (C) Citing his experience with corruption he said, \"I\'m a 
merchant, and I know what things cost. None of the Ministers 
could afford my refrigerators on their salaries, but they all 
have them.\"  Shammakh continued by detailing the financial 
requirements of a high official, and concluded that there was 
no way a senior official could even afford food on the salary 
provided by the Ministry.  The first step for reform is to 
trim the bloated ROYG workforce and the second step is to 
adequately compensate the workers the ROYG is able to keep. 
Admitting this may be a painful and long process, Shammakh 
said it was the most important factor in ending corruption in 
Yemen. 
 
-------------------- 
Ill-prepared Workers 
-------------------- 
 
6. (C) Turning to other problems of doing business in Yemen, 
he said, \"I cannot find a secretary to hire.\" Complaining 
that the Yemeni education system focuses too much on 
impractical knowledge and little on career based education, 
he said he and his colleagues found it extremely difficult to 
find qualified people.  He said to counter this, the Islah 
Party founded the Islahi Technical College to train students 
in computer and job skills. To his disappointment, the 
college has since become a university focused on producing 
engineers and has strayed from its original purpose of 
teaching job skills appropriate for the labor market in 
Yemen. 
 
----------------------- 
Qat: the \"Evil of Evils\" 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C)  Qat, Shammakh said, was \"the evil of evils.\"  He 
blamed many Yemeni economic problems on Qat and the inability 
of the Ministry of Agriculture to encourage the growth of 
alternative crops. He said farmers needed micro-enterprise 
projects, and not long-term studies.  Qat was taking valuable 
land and water that could be used for cash crops.  Shammakh 
owns a tannery and said he was unable to get suitable hides 
in Yemen because people kill their cows too young. Blaming 
this also on qat, he said that people would rather grow qat 
than use the land to graze cattle or grow coffee or ginseng, 
all profitable commodities for Yemen.  Shammakh himself left 
the coffee business because he was unable find land to grow 
enough beans to make production profitable. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Comment: Shammakh focused his strong critique of the 
ROYG on the ministries themselves, and never once mentioned 
the Presidency. We have been reliably told that that 
President Saleh had asked Shammakh to join the ruling GPC, 
but that Shammakh told the President that he needed to stay 
in the Islah Party to keep it moderate.  Shammakh politely 
answered all of Pol/Econoff\'s questions on money laundering, 
but took every opportunity to provide his own views on what 
ails the Yemeni economy. End Comment.

SUBJECT: YEMEN: ASSISTANCE FOR CIVIL DISORDER MANAGEMENT 
(CDM) 
 
1. (SBU) I am requesting your support for Civil Disorder 
Management (CDM) training for Yemen.  There are at least 
three salient considerations: 
 
--  Yemeni efforts against Al-Qa\'ida elements, especially 
over the last eight months, have been sustained and 
increasingly successful. 
--  Despite President Salih\'s differences with us over Iraq 
and the troubled regional climate, Salih has shown steady 
resolve to protect American personnel and facitilies. 
--  When push came to shove during the March 21 violent 
demonstration heading toward the Embassy, Salih and Yemeni 
security forces gave no sign of flinching, even when lethal 
force had to be used. 
 
2.  (SBU) With my encouragement, staff here have been in 
touch informally with INL and S/CT regarding training 
possibilities.  Not surprisingly, FY-03 training budgets are 
already earmarked, and indeed we are told FY-04 plans are 
well advanced.  Sometimes plans fall through, however, and 
countries are unable to participate in training programs 
already approved.  Against that contingency, I would like to 
express my strong support, as soon as possible, for a Civil 
Disorder Management (CDM) Program for Yemen. 
 
3.  (SBU) Such an INL-funded program would provide essential 
in-country training for Central Security Organization 
commanders, and follow-up training and essential equipment 
for Central Security Organization (CSO -- the Ministry of 
Interior\'s internal security body) cadres.  The violent March 
21 demonstration showed clear need, and I cannot think of a 
more appropriate response to the ROYG\'s efforts to ensure the 
safety of this mission during the recent violence.  I am told 
that training and equipment for about 150-175 personnel could 
be done for an estimated $350,000. 
 
4.  (SBU) I recommend such a program be funded as early as 
possible.  Informally, we have been in touch with senior 
working levels at the MOI, who indicate strong interest in 
training possiblities; if/if opportunities materialize,  On 
that basis, Embassy would engage with the Minister of 
Interior on necessary agreements to cover this activity 
should a way forward be found for CDM for Yemen.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM 
SUBJECT: YEMEN\'S ELECTION ADMINISTRATION TECHNICALLY SOUND 
 
 
 1.   (U)  Summary:  Technical preparations for the April 27 
parliamentary elections are significantly better than past 
efforts by the ROYG, which should increase citizen confidence 
in the outcome of the elections.  Improvements include a more 
credible voter registration, increased transparency, better 
election materials, widespread voter education and 
significant moves by the ROYG to alleviate opposition 
concerns about undue influence.  An atmosphere of increased 
political party competition, however, will offer challenges 
for Yemen to continue its democratic progress and avoid 
campaign violence (septel).  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  According to the United Nations Development Program 
(UNDP), National Democratic Institute for International 
Affairs (NDI) and International Foundation for Electoral 
Systems (IFES), the ROYG,s technical preparations for the 
parliamentary elections are vastly improved over past 
elections.   Past elections in 1997 (parliamentary) and 2001 
(local) were judged largely free and fair by international 
organizations despite some problems, including: 
 
-- Technical inefficiency and lack of transparency and 
communication on the part of the Supreme Election Commission 
(SEC); 
 
-- Poor voter registration administration and adjudication 
resulting in diminished confidence in the voter lists; 
 
-- Behind the scenes deals between political parties that 
lessened citizen confidence in the election process; 
 
-- Few women candidates and a small number of registered 
women voting; 
 
-- Ineffective voter education to create citizen 
understanding of ballot secrecy and the importance of 
exercising the right to vote. 
 
3.  (U)  Increased collaboration between the Supreme 
Committee for Elections and Referenda (SCER, re-named from 
the SEC) and the UNDP, IFES and NDI, as well as a strong 
political will on the part of the ROYG, has resulted in 
significant improvements in election administration for the 
April 2003 elections.  Some of these improvements include: 
 
-- More credible voter registration in late 2002 resulting in 
fraud-resistant voter ID cards, better record-keeping 
(including computerized voter lists that allow for checking 
for multiple registration), more than 8 million voters 
registered and a 40% increase in the number of women 
registered; 
 
-- Increased transparency on the part of the SCER to increase 
confidence among political parties and citizens in the 
process, including members drawn from across the political 
spectrum, regularly televised open meetings, strong media 
coverage, a willingness to openly admit problems and offer 
solutions and close cooperation with international 
organizations and donors; 
 
-- Better technical materials and procedures for voting day, 
including fraud-resistant voter ID cards and ballots, 
official registries with photos and tamper-resistant ink to 
prevent double-voting; 
 
-- A confidence building measure by the SCER (advocated by 
NDI) to alleviate accusations of strong military influence in 
the election by placing decision-making to react to election 
day disputes with a multiparty SCER committee (with a 
military member) rather than solely with the military; 
 
--  Strengthened voter education programs that include using 
all media outlets, training voter education coordinators to 
conduct programs country-wide and establishing voter 
education centers. 
 
4.  (U)  Several technical problems remain.  The provision in 
the election law allowing citizens to vote at either their 
place of residence, work or birth leaves an opening for 
multiple voting that is difficult to counteract despite 
improvements in voter registration record-keeping and better 
indelible ink.  The increase in voting centers from past 
elections allows greater access to citizens to vote.  At the 
same time, however, the huge number of election commissions 
(approximately 20,000 sub-commissions, one per 400 voters 
registered) raises the possibility of increased fraud or 
inadvertent mistakes on the part of individual commissioners 
or sub-commissions.  With concerns about terrorism and 
heightened tension in Yemen between political parties, the 
military will maintain a strong presence.  Accusations by 
opposition parties in past elections that the military played 
an intimidating and sometimes fraudulent role could make the 
security presence a campaign and election-day issue.

1.  (C)  Summary:  Ambassador and Foreign Minister Abu Bakr 
al-Qirbi discussed problems plaguing the diplomatic pouch, 
outstanding vehicle exemption requests and the shortage of 
non-diplomatic \"blue\" license plates during an April 12 
meeting on various subjects (septels).  Ambassador criticized 
the lack of ROYG consistency and stressed the need for a 
swift resolution to avoid wider ramifications.  FM Qirbi 
agreed to contact his ROYG counterparts to get these issues 
resolved.  End summary. 
 
---------------- 
Diplomatic Pouch 
---------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Ambassador highlighted the latest diplomatic pouch 
run on April 11 as another example of ROYG inconsistency.  He 
noted that post did everything ROYG requested and even sent 
people to the airport on 4/10 to make sure preparations were 
complete.  Regardless, there were still new requirements on 
April 11 when the pouches arrived.  Ambassador added that 
post now faces a situation that will require even larger 
shipments just to catch-up with the backlog. 
 
3.  (C)  Noting that this impasse is continuing to draw 
attention in Washington, Ambassador delivered a non-paper 
outlining an April 4th incident in which diplomatic couriers 
were physically prevented from performing their duties -- one 
sustaining minor injuries while trying to maintain possession 
of the pouch. 
 
4.  (C)  After hearing the details of the April 4th incident, 
FM Qirbi said he would raise the issue during a meeting with 
PSO Chief Gamish scheduled for later that afternoon (4/12). 
 
------------------- 
Vehicle Exemptions 
------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Ambassador called FM Qirbi\'s attention to four 
pending vehicle exemptions at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, all of which are for armored vehicles.  Ambassador 
highlighted the Embassy\'s need for additional armored 
vehicles to maintain a strong security posture, and advised 
that, due in part to the Embassy\'s growth because of 
increased U.S.-Yemen cooperation, additional vehicle 
exemption requests for both armored and personal vehicles 
would be forthcoming.  Qirbi acknowledged the importance of 
maintaining security, but made no commitment to streamline 
the process. 
 
--------------------- 
\"Blue\" License Plates 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  When discussion turned to the shortage of blue 
(non-diplomatic) license plates, FM Qirbi immediately denied 
MFA involvement in their issuance.  Ambassador countered that 
the Ministry of Interior, the only other player in the 
process, said that the MOI has no objection to the release of 
these plates, the implication being that unresolved problems 
were to be dealt with by the MFA. 
 
7.  (C)  Qirbi replied that he would raise this issue with 
the Minister of Interior later that day (4/12).  The 
Ambassador welcomed Qirbi\'s involvement and added that the 
Embassy is trying to help ROYG by making U.S. officials 
harder targets -- by removing easily identifiable diplomatic 
plates and replacing them with regular blue plates.

1.  (C)  Summary:  The Yemeni government continues to manage 
its anti-war credentials and cooperation with the U.S. by 
playing both sides, although the fall of Baghdad has spurred 
efforts by the ROYG to move cooperation forward with the U.S. 
 Citizen reaction to Saddam\'s regime collapse remains torn 
between relief that the bloodletting will now be limited, 
shock at its quick demise, anger at the \"aggressors\" and 
concerns over U.S. intentions in the region.  Parliamentary 
elections in less than two weeks offer a distraction from a 
public exhausted by regional developments.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
ROYG Balancing Act Continues 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  The ROYG position before and during the war in Iraq 
has been one of straddling two camps:  1)  maintaining close 
cooperation with the U.S. on counterterrorism and protecting 
Americans in Yemen and 2) keeping in line with the Yemeni 
\"street\" and Arab opinion by opposing the war (ref).  The 
fall of Saddam\'s regime has left the ROYG struggling with how 
to shape their public position.  The ROYG understands that it 
has some ground to cover to move cooperation forward with the 
U.S.  At the same time, maintaining public support for the 
ruling party in the parliamentary elections on April 27 
forces the ROYG to continue balancing its anti-war 
credentials with the public while watching the way ahead for 
broader improvement in U.S.-ROYG relations.  Official press 
coverage reflects a shift in tone back to more low-key 
coverage.  Challenges by former Iraqi Vice President Ramadan 
had caused the ROYG to ratchet up the rhetoric around March 
24 (ref).  According to Presidential Advisor al-Iryani, this 
change is a direct result of directives from President Saleh. 
 
 
3.  (C)  Foreign Minister Qirbi on April 12 told Ambassador 
that the ROYG understands that fighting was near the end.  He 
said it was \"sad to see incidents of looting and violence,\" 
it should be a U.S./UK priority to prevent it and it was 
\"nice to see\" Iraqis organizing to look out for security 
concerns.  Qirbi said people are watching to see if the 
coalition leaves, if a government selected by Iraqis takes 
power and if other promises by Bush and Blair in Belfast are 
upheld.  He noted that in Yemen the ROYG has avoided making 
statements because \"this is a time for Iraqis to make 
decisions on their own.\"  He also cautioned that \"softer\" 
U.S. statements regarding Syria and Iran would be preferable 
to avoid inflaming opinion. 
 
------------------------------ 
Yemenis Angry and Yet Relieved 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  (U)  General Yemeni reaction to events in Iraq continues 
to be a mix of relief that the \"killing is over\" and Saddam 
is gone, shock at the speed of events and continued anger 
over the \"aggressors.\"  Conspiracy theories are popular. 
Several FSNs explained the following typical sentiment: 
Yemenis believed Iraqi Information Minister al-Sahhaf when he 
said the Marines were not in Baghdad.  They had to.  Now, 
they cannot accept that the coalition forces overpowered the 
regime.  A conspiracy must have allowed Saddam to leave Iraq. 
 (The most popular conspiracy theory appears to be that Dr. 
Rice arranged for the Russians to spirit Saddam out of Iraq.) 
 
 
5.  (U)  Concerns over the humanitarian situation and looting 
have been supplemented by fear about U.S. plans for Syria. 
Press reporting has turned towards speculation about 
\"American intentions\" in the Middle East while toning down 
its rhetoric regarding the \"invasion\" of Iraq and 
concentrating increasingly on the upcoming elections. 
 
6.  (U)  Virulent Yemeni reaction to the war seems to have 
peaked early on at the beginning of hostilities -- near the 
time of the violent March 21 demonstration.  While resentment 
continues, our everyday interaction with the public gives 
indications of a lessening of tension as the period of major 
combat operations has receded.  The traditional Yemeni 
friendliness and openness seem to be slowly re-appearing 
after several weeks of cooler interactions. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Elections a Distraction from Regional Events 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (U)  As the campaign for the 4/27 elections heats up, 
Yemenis are increasingly focused on internal matters.  Some 
independent and opposition newspapers had published reports 
that the war in Iraq has greatly affected the campaign for 
the elections by reducing the number of candidates, lowering 
citizen interest and creating opportunities for opposition 
parties to gain votes through anti-U.S./ROYG campaigning. 
However, according to a number of political observers, last 
week\'s fall of Baghdad (coming the day after the start of 
official campaigning here) and subsequent winding down of the 
war should lower the war\'s overall negative impact on the 
election campaign. 
 
8.  (U)  From press coverage of the campaign thus far, it 
appears that the war in Iraq and U.S.-ROYG CT cooperation 
have not yet become the big campaign issue that the ruling 
General People\'s Congress and international observers feared. 
 A few editorials in various newspapers -- encouraging 
citizens and political parties to contribute to making 
democracy work in Yemen -- have even suggested one reason: 
Yemen\'s democratic status being a \"safeguard\" against U.S. 
intervention.

SUBJECT: TF1Z01: SANAA EAC MEETING APRIL 16 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  The Ambassador convened an Emergency 
Action Committee (EAC) meeting on April 16 to assess Embassy 
security posture and threat information.  The EAC decided to 
return to normal operations on April 19, and to formally 
request the cancellation of authorized departure -- to 
include the return of dependents to post.  End summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF)   Key offices and personnel represented at the 
4/16 EAC meeting included: ADMIN, AMB, CONS, DCM, FPD, OMC, 
ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, RMO and SOC YEMEN. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  ORCA reported no new threat information. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  RSO reported that there is no information on 
planned demonstrations this weekend.  RSO will monitor the 
situation and alert the Embassy community as warranted. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Imminent Suspension of MoveSafe Light 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Noting the end of major combat operations in Iraq, 
A/DCM raised two issues for EAC\'s consideration: ending 
MoveSafe Lite and returning to normal operations; and 
formally requesting an end to authorized departure.  RSO 
reported a request from the Ministry of Interior (MOI) for 
USG personnel to maintain the current level of security 
practices for 4-5 more days.  MOI recognizes that the 
situation in Yemen is improving considering the events in the 
region, but feels that a few more days of heightened security 
will allow for a greater easing of Yemeni popular opinion. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  Regarding possible threats to the community, EAC 
discussed an MOI report of a road incident in which shots 
were fired at a Jordanian diplomat.  While the Jordanians 
believe their diplomat was specifically targeted, eye witness 
statements describe a vehicular confrontation ending in 
gunfire -- one shot fired into the air and one into the 
Jordanian\'s car.  The shot into the car impacted away from 
the Jordanian diplomat.  His vehicle did not have diplomatic 
plates.  The MOI is assessing this episode as a road-rage 
incident. 
 
7.  (C)  Unless credible new threat information becomes 
available, EAC agreed to go off of MoveSafe Lite on Saturday, 
April 19. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Cancellation of Authorized Departure 
------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C)  Referring to an April 15 meeting in Washington to 
review the status of posts in the Gulf, A/DCM noted that the 
Department welcomes recommendations from posts in the region 
on whether to continue with authorized/ordered departure. 
 
9.  (C)  EAC decided to formally request the lifting of 
authorized departure (AD) with attendees noting the 
following: 
 
--  Informal polling of embassy personnel revealed general 
support for lifting AD because no one at post has used it; 
however, several post personnel have mentioned a perceived 
disconnect between returning to regular staffing while 
maintaining increased security. 
 
--  Addressing the \"disconnect\", attendees noted that 
increased security and use of armored vehicles has brought 
post to its target security posture.  This security will 
remain in place, even while ending AD, to deter future 
threats. 
 
--  AD complicates the day-to-day life of a mission, in 
particular with respect to travel of personnel to and from 
post, and, if no longer required by local and regional 
circumstances, should be discontinued as soon as possible. 
 
-------------------- 
Return of Dependents 
-------------------- 
10.  (C)  Turning to the issue of dependents at post, EAC 
members noted that a year ago, given circumstances in Yemen, 
the Department decided to allow spouses but no minor 
dependents to return to post.  With regional circumstances 
changing after the end of combat operations in Iraq - and 
with improving security conditions in Yemen - EAC members 
agreed to request that in conjunction with the lifting of 
authorized departure, the Department also approve the return 
of minor dependents to Sanaa -- as it presumably may be doing 
for other posts in the region. 
11.  (C)  Foreigners in Yemen have been targeted no more than 
at other posts in the region, and heightened security 
measures and ROYG\'s continued cooperation have been 
effective.  The Department\'s concurrence on the return of 
dependents to post in the near future would also give 
families the chance to make preparations without interfering 
with their children\'s education. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Escape of Ten Suspected Terrorists 
---------------------------------- 
 
12.  (S/NF)  EAC also discussed the security implications of 
the escape of 10 suspected al-Qaida terrorists from a ROYG 
facility in Aden with FPD rep raising the possibility that 
these 10 could pose an increased threat.  Noting that the USG 
was principally interested in 2 of the 10 for further 
investigation and prosecution, ORCA indicated that the other 
8 are not key terrorist activists, while they still merit 
observation.  ROYG is committed to the swift apprehension of 
the 10 and is working closely with the USG.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM, DOMESTIC POLITICS 
SUBJECT: SETTING THE STAGE FOR YEMEN,S PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTION 
 
REF: SANAA 706 
 
1.  (U)  Summary:  The April 27 parliamentary elections 
should be the most competitive elections ever in Yemen.  This 
third parliamentary election in Yemen\'s emerging democracy 
presents a challenge and an opportunity for Yemen to move 
forward.  The potential for violence threatens to mar what 
observers believe will be a mostly free and fair election 
(ref).  Many issues will affect the election\'s outcome, 
including opposition party coordination or lack thereof, poor 
candidate selection, campaign issues, few women candidates 
and effective election observation.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
Most Competitive Elections Ever, 
Higher Potential for Violence 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Unlike in past elections, little evidence of 
\"backroom\" coordination between the GPC and Islah parties has 
emerged.  In 1997, the parties negotiated to create \"safe\" 
constituencies for each other, both because they were running 
in an informal coalition and because they wished to avoid 
violent clashes in high-tension areas.  The Yemeni Socialist 
Party (YSP), former ruling party of pre-unification People\'s 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, is running in this election, 
another major difference from 1997 when they boycotted. 
These two factors mean that the 2003 elections should be the 
most competitive in Yemen ever.  An informal count by 
knowledgeable observers indicates that approximately 120 of 
301 constituencies should be highly competitive \"hot\" races, 
primarily in Sanaa city and the Aden, Taiz and Hadramaut 
governorates. 
 
3.  (U)  The increased competition and resultant tension 
causes many observers to fear increased violence during this 
election period.  Past elections have seen flare-ups of 
violence in random constituencies between political parties 
and between tribes.  In some instances, this violence was the 
result of warring tribes using the elections as \"an excuse\" 
to continue fighting that has gone on for decades.  In other 
instances, the fighting has flared up because of disputes 
between partisans.  The ROYG, political parties and NGOs have 
made significant efforts in recent months to discuss how to 
combat the possibility of violence, including the signing by 
22 political parties of a Code of Conduct on April 8 
(septel).  Observers fear, however, that these efforts may 
not be entirely effective as election day approaches even 
with an increased security presence throughout Yemen. 
 
4.  (U)  Political observers are finding that the heavy 
competition makes predictions of election results difficult. 
A vast majority believe that the GPC will retain its majority 
with little difficulty, but many also see the likelihood of 
the Islah party significantly increasing its number of seats. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Opposition Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  The Islah party, YSP and most small opposition 
parties comprise the JMP, which was formed in early 2002 to 
more effectively challenge the ruling GPC.  At several points 
in the last several months, JMP cohesion was threatened.  For 
example, the assassination of YSP leader Jarallah Omar at the 
Islah party conference December 28, 2002 could have caused 
the JMP to break up.  However, in a development that 
surprised many observers, the JMP has managed to remain 
largely coordinated. 
 
6.  (U)  The JMP failed to negotiate which party,s 
candidates would run in which areas in all constituencies. 
Among the largest parties, the YSP gave way to Islah 
candidates in 130 constituencies while Islah gave way to YSP 
candidates in 30 constituencies.  Negotiations with the 
smaller parties in the coalition did not result in many 
agreements.  A majority of the JMP competitive constituencies 
are located in Aden, Hadramaut and Sanaa, areas where the YSP 
and Islah both believed themselves well able to win. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Sheikh al-Ahmar -- \"Joint\" GPC-Islah Candidate 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7.  (U)  Leader of the Islah party and recent Speaker of 
Parliament Sheikh al-Ahmar will run unofficially as a \"joint\" 
candidate for the GPC and Islah.  Negotiations between the 
GPC and Islah to orchestrate a switch in high positions 
between al-Ahmar and Shura Council Chairman Abdul Ghani 
failed.  These negotiations were fueled by the realization 
that if the GPC retained its majority, it would not make 
sense to re-elect an Islahi because the two parties no longer 
form an informal governing coalition.  At the same time, 
al-Ahmar,s profile and power necessitated a high position in 
the complicated balancing act that is Yemeni politics.  It 
appears that the ROYG and the GPC calculated that, in the 
absence of an agreement to switch, it was prudent to make the 
re-election of al-Ahmar politically feasible by announcing 
him as being supported by both parties.  Al-Ahmar is expected 
to win because the same token opposition candidate that runs 
against him regularly will be his only competition, setting 
the stage for al-Ahmar,s likely re-election as Speaker of 
Parliament. 
 
----------------- 
Candidate Choices 
----------------- 
 
8.  (U)  Approximately 1,500 candidates are running in the 
301 constituencies, including political party and independent 
candidates.  This number is significantly lower from past 
elections.  Some observers have blamed the war in Iraq for 
the decrease, alleging that it reduced the number of 
candidates, lowered citizen interest and created 
opportunities for opposition parties to gain votes through 
anti-U.S./ROYG campaigning.    However, the decrease is more 
likely a result of opposition parties coordinating candidates 
and complicated measures by which independent candidates can 
register that decreased their number significantly. 
 
9.  (U)  Political observers note that decentralization in 
candidate nomination by the GPC and Islah parties caused 
deterioration in \"candidate quality\" in some cases and 
lowered the chances for women being nominated.  Many 
candidates are believed to be illiterate and were nominated 
out of local or tribal power centers rather than from among 
the educated. 
 
10.  (U)  Presidential son Ahmed Saleh, head of the Yemeni 
Special Forces, did not run again.  A well-traveled joke from 
the last parliament was that its numbers of Members were \"300 
  Ahmed,\" an indication of what many thought of his 
effectiveness as a Member.  In his constituency, the former 
Mayor of Sanaa is the GPC candidate, someone that many 
believe corrupt. 
 
----------------------- 
Active Campaign; Issues 
----------------------- 
 
11.  (U)  Halfway through the 19-day official campaign 
period, the election campaign is in full swing.  Campaign 
posters are everywhere, political party newspapers publish 
almost daily and coverage on television and in newspapers is 
widespread.  Political party platforms are published in their 
entirety in official and opposition papers alike.  Concerns 
that the war in Iraq would greatly affect the election -- 
including rumors for several months that the elections would 
be postponed should a war begin -- have dissipated with the 
fall of Saddam\'s regime. 
 
12.  (U)  Campaign issues vary, with the most prominent being 
the economy, law and order, and corruption.  In many cases, 
parties seem to run less on specific issues than on candidate 
or leadership personalities and whether they are government 
or opposition.  The issues of U.S.-ROYG counterterrorism 
cooperation and, in relation, the war in Iraq, do not appear 
to be the huge issues that the ROYG and ruling GPC feared. 
Nevertheless, political observers believe that these issues, 
with an attendant flavor of an \"American fight against 
Islam,\" will increase the Islah party vote. 
 
-------------------- 
Few Women Candidates 
-------------------- 
 
13.  (U)  In what many consider the biggest disappointment of 
the run-up to the election, only 11 women are running for 
election.  They represent four political parties, including 
GPC and YSP, and include five independents.  Not only has 
Yemen allowed universal suffrage since 1993 (the first on the 
Arabian Peninsula), but both parliaments in 1993 and 1997 had 
women Members.  Some observers and political parties fear 
that no women will be elected this time and Yemen will 
backslide in its women,s representation. 
 
14.  (U)  Several domestic and international NGOs and some 
political parties had advocated for either a formal or 
informal \"set-aside\" for women candidates to ensure at least 
10 percent representation.  Ideas included parties informally 
agreeing to run only women in 30 selected constituencies and 
a formal last-minute change in the election law to mandate 
\"women,s constituencies.\"  Several problems caused the low 
number of women candidates, including a decision by the Islah 
that they would lose a large part of their base should they 
run women, decentralization in candidate selection that left 
central party bodies without the ability to place women 
candidates, increased competition that caused parties to be 
reluctant to run women they thought might be weaker 
candidates than men and a traditional male-dominated society. 
 A formal resolution in the election law was not feasible 
before the election, and many are discussing the possibility 
of raising the issue after the election. 
 
-------------------- 
Election Observation 
-------------------- 
 
15.  (U)  The National Democratic Institute for International 
Affairs (NDI) is fielding the only official international 
observation delegation.   30 delegates from 10 countries, 
including several in the Middle East, will observe.  More 
than 30,000 domestic election observers are registered as 
well, including between 6-10,000 NDI-trained observers.  The 
Embassy plans to informally observe the elections.  Details 
on observation septel.

SUBJECT: PRESS PLAYS ON EXAGGERATED ECONOMIC FEARS, ROYG 
PUNCHES BACK 
 
Classified By: Classified by A/DCM Ken McKune for reasons 1.5 b. and d. 
 
1. (C)  Summary: Grave economic consequences from the war in 
Iraq have been predicted in both official and unofficial 
Yemeni press. However, most of the articles have been based 
on conjecture and faulty math. In response, ROYG officials 
have been reinforcing positive economic news and developing 
new trade and supply policies to assure the public that the 
economy is stable. End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) Press reports in both the official and opposition 
media have run several stories  projecting a severe negative 
impact to the economy of Yemen from the war in Iraq. One 
popular scenario predicts budget losses to the ROYG economy 
if oil drops to $8 a barrel. Another, repeated frequently in 
the English language press, is that the Ministry of Industry 
and Trade has launched an initiative to fix the prices on 
thirteen essential commodities. To counter this, the ROYG 
officials have been promoting a new trade and supply policy, 
making several statements affirming that there are no food 
shortages, and announcing new oil finds. 
 
------------------------- 
8 USD per Barrel of Oil ? 
------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Dr. Muhammed Al-Maytami, a professor of Economics at 
the University of Sanaa, published an article in Al-Hayat on 
March 2nd that outlined three scenarios for Yemen if the 
price of oil drops to 20, 18 and 8 USD a barrel.  According 
to Dr. Al-Maytami\'s math, if oil drops below 20 USD per 
barrel,  Yemen would likely lose 500 million USD a year. 
However, his worst case scenario has oil dropping below 8 USD 
per barrel,and Yemen losing 1.2 billion USD a year. The $1.2 
billion figure for loss has been repeated by al-Jazeera, 
al-Thawra, al-Hayat and the Yemen Times, often without any 
reference to the fact that this figure is based on an 8 USD 
per barrel price. 
 
4. (U) According to Dr. Al-Maytami, the sole strategy of the 
U.S. war on Iraq was to protect oil prices and keep them 
under twenty dollars a barrel.  In all three price scenarios, 
implementation of the ROYG\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy would 
be delayed because much of the money planned to finance this 
project was to originate from oil revenue. While most 
government officials stayed away from such speculation, Under 
Secretary for Planning and Development  Mutahhar al-\'Abbasi 
 
SIPDIS 
told Al-Hayat that Yemen\'s 4-5 percent growth rate could be 
eliminated if the price of oil continues to fall, and added 
that this loss could have a negative affect on the ability of 
the ROYG to meet their poverty eradication goals. 
 
5. (C) Comment: According to the World Bank statistics, 
Yemen\'s budget is based on the price of oil being 21 dollars 
a barrel. As this cable is written, oil is about 29 USD per 
barrel. Therefore, the price can fall much farther without 
significant harm to the ROYG\'s budget planning. End Comment. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Price Fixing by the Ministry of Industry and Trade 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5. (C) Claiming a crisis in foodstuffs and supplies, the 
Yemen Times ran a story on April 6, repeated by several 
internet news outlets, stating that the Ministry of Industry 
and Trade had resorted to price fixing to control food 
shortages.  Arab Bank Manager Mahdi Allawi told Pol/Econoff 
that his business contacts were incredulous over the idea of 
price fixing, and thought the ROYG was not powerful enough to 
enforce such an economic agenda. He later confirmed that 
there were no such price fixing plans by the ROYG. 
 
6. (C) Post obtained a copy of trade and supply proposal and 
confirms that there are no subsidies or price restrictions 
discussed in the plan. However, the Ministry of Industry and 
Trade has been given authority to oversee production to 
ensure that there are no food shortages. An Embssy FSN 
recently traveled to Al-Jowf, a rural northern governorate, 
and reports that he saw no food shortages.  Some businessmen 
Pol/econoff have spoken with have reported that business is 
indeed down because of the war, but there have been no 
accounts of empty shelves and wide-spread hoarding of food by 
Yemenis. Comment: While misrepresented, the new supply 
proposal is most likely an effort to assure the average 
citizen that the war will not drastically affect their 
day-to-day lives. End comment. 
 
------------------------------------ 
ROYG Pushes Economic Success Stories 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) In an effort to get out in front of the dire 
predictions, several government officials have reinforced 
positive economic news. Prime Minister Ba Jammal affirmed on 
several occasions that there were no food shortages in Yemen. 
 Later, Minister of Oil and Minerals Rashid Salih said his 
ministry would soon declare new oil discoveries in Hadhramout 
and Shabwah. On April 3, he told Yemen\'s Sabaa news agency 
that \"oil sales, navigation and even investments didn\'t get 
affected by the war.\"  Reinforcing the message, Minister of 
Trade and Industry Muhammed Uthman noted on several occasions 
that food supplies were stable and even threatened to punish 
those who raise prices to gain economic advantage as a result 
of the war. 
 
8.(C) Comment: Economic worries over a significant drop in 
oil prices and food shortages reflect greater concerns over 
long-term economic stability in Yemen.  It is widely 
understood that oil revenues account for approximately 35% of 
GDP, although some of the articles referred to in this piece 
claim that 95% of Government revenue comes from oil.  Many 
Yemenis Pol/Econoff has spoken to, including several FSNs, 
believe part of the U.S. strategy behind the war in Iraq is 
securing cheap oil. Therefore articles that emphasize drastic 
price drops in oil and the subsequent harm to the Yemeni 
economy, however farfetched, are likely to resonate with the 
average Yemeni citizen.

SUBJECT: POSITIVE MEDIA REACTION TO AMBASSADOR\'S VISIT TO 
MARIB AND POST\'S DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FUNDING 
 
1. Summary.  Ambassador visited Marib Governorate, located in 
the north of Yemen, from April 20-21.  (Refer to Septel.) 
The trip focused on health, development and cultural issues 
in the region and provided the opportunity for Post to 
emphasize work being funded by the U.S. Government in Marib. 
In order to highlight project funding in the area, three 
journalists and one photographer accompanied the Ambassador 
on the trip.  The journalists attended all events on both 
days of the trip and have since positively reported on Post\'s 
development projects in Marib.  End Summary. 
 
------------ 
Journalists 
------------ 
 
2. Journalists accompanying Ambassador were Mohammed bin 
Sallam from the Yemen Times (Yemen\'s principle English 
language, quasi-independent weekly), Mohammed Fare 
Al-Shaibani from Al-Ayyam (Aden-based independent), and 
Abdullah Hizam, editor, and Abdul Aziz Omer Abdul Aziz, 
photographer, from Saba News Agency (Yemen\'s main source of 
official news information). 
 
------------ 
Site Visits 
------------ 
 
3. During the trip, the Ambassador signed an agricultural 
agreement with the Governor of Marib, Abdulla Ali Al-Nassi, 
and visited future agricultural/farm development sites. 
Ambassador also visited a school with new desks funded by the 
U.S. Government, discussed a future museum in Marib to 
protect ancient artifacts found in the region and visited the 
President\'s Hospital where he spoke with students who are 
receiving scholarships from the U.S. Government to study 
various medical fields.  Upon completion of their studies, 
the students will return to Marib to work at the President\'s 
Hospital. 
 
---------- 
Reporting 
---------- 
 
4. Reporting to date has been immensely positive and has 
covered most of the development sites visited during the trip. 
 
5. On April 20, Yemen TV reported on the visit of the U.S. 
Ambassador and stated that the focus of the trip was on 
development and cultural issues in the area.  The news 
broadcast specifically mentioned the signing of an 
agricultural agreement and the future building of a museum in 
Marib. 
 
6. Also on April 20, Al-Thawra (privately owned independent) 
reported two stories regarding the signing of the 
agricultural agreement and U.S. development aid to Yemen. 
Al-Ayyam carried a front page story that covered the signing 
of the agricultural agreement with the Governor of Marib and 
a press conference held by Ambassador on the afternoon of the 
trip.  In the interview, one of the reporters asked, \"Why 
Marib?\" as a place for U.S. funding.  The Ambassador\'s 
response of the importance of their being \"no development 
without security and no security without development\" was 
quoted in the paper. 
 
7. On April 21, both Al-Thawra and Al-Ayyam reported 
additional details of the Ambassador\'s visit.  Al-Ayyam 
carried a story on the front page with two photos of the

YEMEN\'S ELECTION

1.  Summary:  Yemen\'s parliamentary election April 27 (refs 
and septel) will benefit from a well-organized election 
observation effort that will assess its outcome.  Encouraged 
by the ROYG, political parties and NGOs, more than 30,000 
international and domestic observers will deploy on election 
day.  The National Democratic Institute (NDI) will field the 
only official international delegation and plans to issue a 
statement on April 29.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  In an event striking for its contrast with some 
other country leaders who discourage or disallow independent 
election observation, President Saleh hosted a televised 
event for all international observers at the Presidential 
compound on April 23.  President Saleh welcomed the observers 
and said that Yemen has \"attempted to learn from other 
democratic experiments\" and has worked hard to improve 
election administration.  He described efforts to ensure a 
peaceful election and said that Yemen is committed to 
democratic development.  When challenged about the 
disappointing number of women candidates running for 
election, he encouraged all voters to elect women and 
admitted that Yemen had to work harder on women,s inclusion 
in political life while noting the difficulties involved 
culturally in doing so.   One National Democratic Institute 
(NDI) observer told Pol/Econoff that she was \"pleasantly 
surprised\" to get such a welcome after her observation 
experience in Zimbabwe, noting that NDI, UNDP and IFES had 
characterized the cooperation between internationals and the 
ROYG during the election process to her as \"constructive and 
close\" despite some difficulties. 
 
3.  (U)  The 30-member international delegation from NDI 
arrived in Yemen April 22.  Members from 10 countries, 
including Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Turkey, 
comprise the NDI delegation, which includes members of 
parliament, academics, NGO and political party activists, 
journalists and former diplomats (including former U.S. 
Ambassador to Yemen Charles Dunbar).   Because of funding 
constraints and security concerns, neither the UN nor the EU 
was able to mount official observation efforts, making NDI,s 
the only official international delegation.  NDI plans to 
issue its statement on the election on April 29. 
 
4.  (U)  The NDI delegation will be joined by more informal 
efforts by various embassies, including the U.S.  Post will 
deploy more than 20 observers to constituencies in Sanaa, 
Aden and Hadramaut but plans to keep a low profile, both for 
security reasons and to ensure the multi-country NDI 
delegation remains at the forefront.  Post has closely 
coordinated within the Embassy and with NDI to ensure 
appropriate security coverage for the observers by the ROYG. 
 
5.  (U)  More than 30,000 domestic observers representing 
NGOs, political parties and other actors have obtained 
credentials to examine the election process.  Of these, 
6-10,000 are from non-partisan and experienced NGOs trained 
by NDI, which should add valuable analysis to NDI,s official 
statement.

1.  (U)  Summary:  With three days left in the campaign, 
Yemen\'s April 27 parliamentary elections dominate the 
political scene (refs b and c).  The opposition Islah party 
looks likely to gain seats against the ruling General 
People\'s Congress (GPC), although no observers predict that 
the GPC will lose its majority.  A war of harsh words between 
the political parties has not yet escalated into violence. 
Yemen has declared April 27 a \"weapons free day\" in another 
measure to help ensure peaceful elections.  More than 30,000 
international and domestic election observers will deploy to 
assess the conduct of Yemen,s third parliamentary election 
(ref a).  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Predictions Difficult, 
but Islah Will Likely Narrow the Gap 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  Even though the campaign is almost over, predictions 
of probable winners remain complicated.  Clear differences in 
campaign issues are for the most part difficult to discern 
between the parties, leaving the process of the campaign a 
more important factor in its outcome.  A well organized 
campaign by the Islah party, coupled with what some observers 
call poor candidate selection by the GPC, make it likely that 
the wide gap between the GPC and Islah in the last parliament 
will be narrowed from the previous 223 to 64 margin. 
 
3.  (U)  Evidence of the Islah party\'s strong campaign is 
clear.  Islah party activists are going door-to-door in their 
constituencies asking citizens for their vote.  Their 
campaign literature is well-composed and modern in style, 
with clear and concise messages.  Islah party banners, 
posters, flags and mountain sculptures of their party symbol, 
the sun, blanket Sanaa, Marib, Aden and other areas of Yemen. 
 In contrast, while the GPC has also blanketed Yemen with 
such material, there is little evidence of door-to-door 
campaigning or well-crafted campaign literature.  As one GPC 
Shura Council member lamented to Pol/Econoff, the GPC is like 
an elephant when it comes to embracing modern campaign 
methods -- if one grabs its foot, it takes a long time for 
the touch to reach its brain.  He also noted that being in 
government allows for laziness in the campaign, while being 
in opposition makes their supporters motivated to work hard. 
According to him, the strong Islah grassroots campaign has 
many GPC party leaders concerned. 
 
4.  (U)  Informed observers expect the Yemeni Socialist Party 
(YSP) -- which boycotted the 1997 election -- to gain between 
10 and 15 seats, with small numbers of other seats going to 
various smaller political parties and independents. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Campaign Rife with Partisan Fighting 
------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (U)  A battle is waging via faxes, newspapers, electronic 
media and word of mouth between political parties accusing 
each other of unfair campaign practices and violations of 
election law.  Accusations run the gamut from exploiting 
government property for campaigning to using rhetoric 
intended to incite to tearing down each other\'s posters to 
interfering with campaign rallies.  Opposition parties also 
raised concerns about the use of State media in favor of the 
GPC and various actions by the Supreme Commission for 
Elections and Referenda (SCER), including allegedly 
preventing some opposition party election commissioners from 
working and erroneously eliminating some candidates by citing 
improper registration.  Observers characterize these 
complaints, however, as minor. 
 
6.  (U)  Disputes in several constituencies have caused 
concern and, in some cases, direct action by the SCER.  For 
example, according to the UNDP, the election has been 
suspended in one constituency because one political party 
continues to hold hostage a ballot box from the 1997 
elections. 
 
7.  (U)  Despite reported clashes in several constituencies, 
there are no reports of deaths as a result of violence. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
The Al-Ahmar Clan Straddles Both Sides; 
A Son Clashes with Governor 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U)  Leader of the Islah party and former Speaker of 
Parliament Sheikh al-Ahmar has five sons running in the 
elections, three for his Islah party and two for the GPC.  In 
an example of tribe triumphing over party, one GPC candidate 
son is being contested by a powerful Islahi Sheikh from the 
same tribe.  It remains to be seen if this is a serious 
challenge that could engender violence or insurance to make 
sure the seat remains within the tribe. 
 
9.  (U)  The eldest al-Ahmar son, an Islah party candidate, 
clashed with the GPC governor of Amran on April 16, injuring 
several, when the governor was campaigning in the son\'s 
district.  The SCER responded by suspending the election in 
that constituency, while the governor offered his resignation 
in protest.  However, according to a Shura Council contact, 
the dispute has been resolved after high level discussions 
sponsored by President Saleh.  The election is on, and the 
governor is still in place. 
 
------------------------------ 
\"Weapons Free Day\" Declared; 
Sporadic Violence Still Likely 
------------------------------ 
 
10.  (U)  The SCER announced early this week that election 
day should be \"weapons free,\" a move echoed by ROYG 
officials.  The first announcement of its kind in Yemen, it 
encourages all Yemenis to leave their weapons at home to 
ensure a peaceful election.  The UNDP and SCER voter 
education project will include wide dissemination of the 
directive as part of its overall outreach efforts, which are 
widespread.  Education efforts include television skits, 
radio spots, banners, cars with megaphones and information 
tents in all areas of Yemen.  Some of the other messages 
disseminated by the project include assuring voters that 
their ballot is secret, encouraging citizens to exercise 
their right to vote, reminding women to vote and instructing 
voters to only vote once. 
 
11.  (U)  The call for a \"weapons free day\" is part of 
several moves by government, political parties and other 
stakeholders to discourage violence during the election 
period.  Yemen has experienced sporadic violence in every one 
of its elections and voter registration periods since 
unification, including more than 20 killed during the 2001 
local elections and 7 killed during the 2002 voter 
registration.  The SCER will not allow any weapons inside 
voting centers.  A widely publicized \"Code of Honor\" was 
signed April 9 by 22 political parties to encourage all 
parties in Yemen to conduct free and fair campaigns and 
refrain from electoral violence (ref d).  Spurred by an 
initiative from IFES and NDI in late 2002, President Saleh 
took sponsorship of the Code, formed a committee of political 
parties and came to an agreement.  While the initiative has 
significant symbolic power, neither the Code nor the 
committee has any enforcement measures to ensure that the 
signatories live up to the measure. 
 
12.  (U)  A decision pushed by the political parties that was 
issued by the SCER recently threatens to heighten tensions on 
election day.  Because Yemen does not have a tradition of 
citizens holding identity documents, internationals and the 
SCER had intended to allow citizens to vote if they forgot 
their voter registration card or other identification as long 
as their name and photo could be verified on the voter lists 
and attested to by all commission members.  For reasons 
unclear to the UNDP director of the election support project, 
the Islah party refused to go along with the suggestion. 
This decision could increase the likelihood of clashes on 
election day as voters without ID are turned away from the 
polls.

SUBJECT: MARIB: ALL POLITICS IS LOCAL 
 
REF: SANAA 857 
 
Classified By: Ambassador E.J. Hull for reasons 1.5 b. and d. 
 
1.(U) Summary: As part of a USG initiative to encourage 
development and security in the underdeveloped governorates 
of Yemen, Ambassador traveled to Marib to initiate USG 
assistance in agriculture, to study cultural preservation and 
to review progress on the U.S. efforts to train and equip the 
Marib Presidential hospital. The visit took place in the 
final days of the parliamentary election campaign. According 
to Marib Governor Nassi, the Islah party could win two out of 
the three seats of the Marib district. End Summary 
 
2. (U) On April 20 and 21 Ambassador led a delegation to 
visit Marib, a conservative and tribal-dominated eastern 
governorate to sign an implementing agreement on agricultural 
projects with the Governor of Marib, visit the hospital to 
which the USG is providing 5.3 million dollars of equipment 
and training assistance, and engage in discussions regarding 
the future location of a USG-funded museum. 
 
----------------------- 
USG Assistance to Marib 
----------------------- 
 
3. (U) Marib Governor Abdulla Nassi welcomed Ambassador and 
signed the proposal initiating the first phase of 
agricultural assistance for irrigation, rural women\'s 
development, livestock management, and seed multiplication. 
The agreement also allows for the USG to bring electricity to 
an agricultural research center that will serve the 
governorates of Al-Jowf and Shabwa to develop shade and green 
houses.  Research will be conducted with the aim of 
establishing a second growing season comprised of cash crops 
for Marib and to determine ways to fight prevalent plant 
diseases. Governor Nassi asked for additional assistance in 
bringing local agricultural products to market, canning and 
preserving, irrigation, and help in establishing the mining 
industry of Marib. 
 
4. (U) Ambassador stressed that the U.S. is currently 
providing nearly USD 8 million in assistance for Marib 
residents. At the Presidential Hospital, the Ambassador 
visited with 15 of the 161 students who were all selected 
from the Marib governorate and funded by the USG to study at 
institutes throughout Yemen and return to staff the hospital. 
The building itself is paid for by ROYG oil revenue, and the 
USG is providing 5.3 million dollars for training and 
equipping the hospital. Note: Marib governorate is also where 
Yemen-Hunt has its main drilling facilities. End Note. 
 
5. (U) In an effort to encourage tourism in Marib, the 
ancient home of the Sabaen kingdom and the Queen of Sheba, 
the USG is studying a proposal to build a museum to house 
antiquities. The Ambassador visited the storage facility 
where many of the ancient artifacts are stored haphazardly on 
the governor\'s compound, and initiated discussion on the 
location of the museum.  (Comment: Rumors that foreign 
archeologists, including Americans, are taking artifacts out 
of Marib is a continuing source of tension. End Comment.) 
 
--------------------- 
Islah Permeates Marib 
--------------------- 
 
6. (U) At a dinner hosted by the Ambassador for project 
stakeholders, Governor Nassi told Ambassador that he believed 
Islah would gain one seat in the upcoming parliamentary 
elections on April 27, giving Islah two out of the three 
districts in Marib. Describing himself as a soccer referee 
who happens to favor one side, the Governor explained that 
Islah is extremely active in the local community, focusing 
their campaign on the economy and social services.  Islah\'s 
popularity was clearly visible: several rock formations in 
the shape of the Islah party sun symbol lined the road to 
Sanaa, on the return the delegation passed a large, loud 
convoy supporting Islah, and banners were hung on houses, 
trucks, and businesses.  Nassi described the present 
electoral system as a modern system overlaying traditional 
tribal organization and has called on tribal custom to keep 
violence down. But, Nassi added, tribal allegiances do not 
necessarily follow party lines, and many tribes were offering 
candidates in both Islah and GPC parties for the elections. 
 
7. (U) At a local primary girls\' school, the Ambassador 
toured classrooms that had just received 100 of the 4,000 
school desks provided by the USG to Marib. Local officials 
told the Ambassador that some of the schools that had 
received desks had had no place for the children to sit. At 
the girls\' school, Islah party literature was visible on the 
outer walls, and above the entrance a banner promised that 
Islah would provide a better future and eliminate women\'s 
suffering.  The curriculum appeared overly religious to 
members of the national press who commented negatively on the 
strong religious overtones in the teaching methods and signs 
on the walls. 
 
8. (U) Fanda Al-Amri, chairperson of the Union of Women and 
Child Development Association and principal of the girls\' 
school where the delegation visited, gave Pol/Econoff a range 
of requests for the women of Marib.  Explaining that the 
short growing season makes it difficult for vegetables to be 
consumed year-round, she requested assistance in providing 
local women with knowledge on how to can and preserve food. 
Turning to education, she said that there is one girls\' 
secondary school serving the whole district of Marib and 
often parents do not want the daughters to travel the long 
distance necessary to attend.  At the same school, she 
continued, there are no chemistry and physics teachers, which 
excludes the girls from taking national qualifying exam 
should they wish to further their education. 
 
9. (C)  Comment: The political race in Marib will be 
determined by who can demonstrate that his party can provide 
more services and reforms to serve the local population.  An 
education leader, prominent in local women\'s organizations, 
Al-Amri represents Islah\'s popularity in Marib.  She voiced 
frustrations with that Ministry of Education\'s inability to 
provide basic education to the girls of Marib, but also 
directly appealed for USG assistance in that area. She proves 
that despite anti-US rhetoric by some factions of Islah, her 
reason for political alignment is at least in part based on 
who she believes will help the girls of Marib.

SUBJECT: YEMENI ELECTION DAY PEACEFUL WITH HIGH TURNOUT 
 
 
1.  (U)  Summary:  Yemen enjoyed an overwhelmingly peaceful 
election day on April 27.  Early results indicate that the 
GPC will maintain its parliamentary majority, with opposition 
parties increasing their seats.  Voter turnout was very high, 
estimated to be at least 70%.  Election administration 
appeared professional and well-organized despite some 
irregularities.  The only official international delegation, 
organized by the National Democratic Institute (NDI), will 
issue its preliminary assessment on April 29.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Early Results Show Opposition Narrowing the Gap 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2.  (U)  While results are still coming in from most 
constituencies 18 hours after the close of polls, preliminary 
results from 20% of constituencies show the ruling General 
People\'s Congress (GPC) leading but members of the opposition 
Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) running close.  Several 
traditional GPC strongholds in Sanaa, for example, have seen 
well-known GPC candidates lose to the Islah party.  Analysts 
say that Islah did well at least in part because of a strong 
women\'s vote.  However, the GPC is expected to maintain a 
clear majority.  Individual constituency results will be 
announced by the election commission as they come in and 
final results for all 301 constituencies will be announced by 
the April 30 deadline.  One ROYG official estimated that a 
new government would be announced within two weeks. 
 
------------------------------ 
Mostly Peaceful;  High Turnout 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  (U)  Sporadic violence marred the elections in some 
areas, including Taiz, Amran, Dhamar and Hajira.  According 
to reliable sources, approximately 14 persons were injured in 
clashes, primarily between the GPC and Islah.  Uncorroborated 
reports say that between one to three persons were killed. 
At least one clash was clearly between rival tribes and 
unrelated directly to the election.  With almost 30 people 
killed in Yemen\'s last elections in 2001 for local councils, 
however, in comparison these elections were overwhelmingly 
peaceful on election day.  Possible reasons for the lack of 
violence include the strong messages sent by the President, 
the election commission, political parties and others for 
non-violence and a \"weapons free day,\" fewer candidates vying 
for election and a strong security presence. 
 
4.  (U)  The opening of polls saw huge crowds waiting outside 
to vote, with Embassy observers reporting palpable enthusiasm 
and eagerness on the part of voters.  By midday, Embassy 
observers were reporting between 50-65% of voters had already 
cast their vote.  By the close of polls, domestic and 
international observers were estimating at least a 70% 
turnout.  High numbers of women voters were in evidence, with 
some commissions reporting 80% turnout. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Professional Administration; 
Fairly Smooth Voting with Some Irregularities 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  Embassy observers, who received a warm welcome at 
voting centers in Sanaa, Aden and Hadramaut, were impressed 
at the professionalism of the election commissions, noting 
that a vast majority were well-organized and smoothly run. 
Observers reported that irregularities inside polling centers 
appeared to be a result of poor training or knowledge rather 
than organized fraud.  One commissioner told an Embassy 
observer, \"it may not be perfect but we are getting better.\" 
During the lengthy counting process, observers witnessed 
painstakingly careful procedures to ensure its integrity, 
with political party, NGO and international observers as 
witnesses.  Some technical irregularities reported  by 
observers include commissioners possibly influencing votes in 
women\'s commissions in the course of explaining how to vote, 
ballots in a few constituencies that contained faint markings 
(likely a result of a printing error) that could influence 
voters and some commissions that failed to use the 
photographic voter lists to verify voter identity. 
 
6.  (U)  Accusations by opposition parties of campaign 
irregularities include vote-buying, politicking too close to 
polls, interference by the GPC at some voting centers and use 
of official media for partisan purposes. 
 
7.  (U)  The National Democratic Institute (NDI) fielded a 
30-member international delegation and organized between 
6-10,000 non-partisan domestic NGO observers.  NDI will issue 
a preliminary statement assessing the election on April 29.

SUBJECT: YEMEN,S ELECTION:  CITIZENS BET ON DEMOCRACY 
 
 
1.  (U)  Summary:  The April 27 parliamentary election 
demonstrated significant progress in Yemen\'s democratic path 
despite some flaws.  Obvious enthusiasm and interest by 
voters in the campaign, including more than 75% turnout on 
election day, indicate a healthy appetite for democracy in 
Yemen.  The preliminary results contain little change, with 
the ruling party maintaining a wide majority of more than 70% 
of the seats.  The Islah party, however, made surprising 
gains in the urban city of Sanaa.  In a region with a noted 
lack of healthy democratic trends, this exercise in democracy 
represents an important example.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Progress on the Road to Democracy 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Yemen,s third parliamentary election since 
unification represents another milestone in movement towards 
full democracy despite flaws in its election and political 
processes, as noted by the National Democratic Institute 
(NDI) and other political observers (see paragraph 10 below). 
 The campaign period saw a palpable sense of enthusiasm and 
participation, culminating in a huge turnout of 76% of 
registered voters on election day.  With a 40% increase in 
women registered to vote over the last registration, massive 
numbers of women exercised their right to freely choose their 
representatives.  As NDI reports, citizens\' \"deepening sense 
of democratic entitlement is an important indication of 
Yemen,s progress. . .\" 
 
3.  (U)  President Saleh played a constructive and important 
role in encouraging the democratic process.  His comments at 
several press conferences before and during the election made 
several key points that were important for the peaceful 
nature of election day and for setting the tone of democratic 
rights.  He said on April 27, \"we have to accept defeat or 
victory with a democratic spirit.\"  Election day was 
relatively peaceful compared to past elections, owing in part 
to the prominence placed on a \"weapons free day.\"  He also 
made a comparison to Iraq, saying that he did not want 
\"99.9%\" of the vote for the ruling party, and noted that a 
strong democratic showing would ensure that Yemen was safe 
from actions similar to what happened in Iraq. 
 
-------------------------- 
Results Show Little Change; 
Islah Gains in Urban Areas 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  The Supreme Commission for Elections and Referenda 
(SCER) announced official results on April 30, under the 
72-hour deadline mandated by election law.  Out of 301 
constituencies, final results are known in 280 while 21 
remain under dispute.  The ruling General People\'s Congress 
(GPC) garnered an overwhelming majority with 214 seats so 
far, more than 70%.  The opposition Islah party gained 40 
seats (13%), the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) 7 seats (2%), 
and independents and smaller parties 19 seats.  One woman of 
the 11 female candidates won, marking a decrease from the 
last parliament, which had two women. 
 
5.  (U)  The SCER did not give specific details about the 
problems holding up the disputed constituencies but noted 
that some might require by-elections.  Observers note that 
these constituencies face problems such as counting 
commissioners who refuse to complete the count and stolen 
ballot boxes. 
 
6.  (U)  Many observers were surprised that the opposition 
parties, particularly Islah, did not do better in the 
election.  During the campaign, it appeared that the 
opposition parties would increase their seats, particularly 
Islah.  However, only in Sanaa city did Islah make noticeable 
gains, increasing their number from one to over half of the 
constituencies.  This result in a major urban area surprised 
many because Islah\'s strongholds tend to be in traditional 
tribal areas.  Some observers were shocked as well that the 
Islah won in what is called the \"unity constituency,\" where 
President Saleh votes and where his son last held the seat. 
While difficult to confirm, some observers believe that fraud 
and political intimidation did effect the outcome of the 
election in GPC\'s favor in some constituencies outside of 
Sanaa. 
 
7.  (U)  Political observers believe that Islah\'s gains in 
Sanaa were a result of dissatisfaction with the government, 
Islah\'s message of change resonating with voters, a 
well-organized campaign and poor GPC candidate selection. 
 
--------------- 
Campaign Issues 
--------------- 
 
8.  (U)  \"Bread and butter\" issues dominated the election, 
with economic and law and order issues prevalent. 
Anti-corruption and anti-government messages were popular 
among opposition parties.  Although observers had thought 
that the war in Iraq and ongoing U.S.-Yemeni counterterrorism 
cooperation would become big issues, the fall of Baghdad 
three weeks before election day largely diminished the issue. 
 As one Yemeni observer said, \"when people are hungry, they 
don\'t care about foreign policy.\" 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
9.  (U)  While far from perfect, these elections demonstrated 
an entrenchment of political rights by Yemeni citizens that 
sets an example for future democratic trends in the region. 
The flaws in the process must be vigorously addressed before 
the next election in 2006, with the help of the international 
community, to avoid backsliding in Yemen\'s democratic 
progress.

NDI Report:  Significant Step Forward Despite Flaws 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
10.  (U)  As NDI described in its preliminary statement on 
April 29, both positive and negative developments 
characterized the elections.  The full report, with specific 
examples and anecdotal evidence, was sent to NEA/ARP and is 
also available at www.ndi.org.  The positive developments 
include: 
 
-- a relatively peaceful election, with fewer injuries and 
deaths due to violent clashes than in previous elections; 
 
-- full participation by all major political parties allowing 
for increased competition and a further entrenchment of the 
multi-party system; 
 
-- a well-administered and organized balloting process on 
election day; 
 
-- significant professional improvements by the Supreme 
Commission for Elections and Referenda (SCER); 
 
-- close and constructive cooperation between international 
actors, including NDI, International Foundation for Electoral 
Systems (IFES) and the UN Development Program (UNDP), and the 
SCER, resulting in significant administrative and political 
improvements. 
 
Despite many positive developments, significant flaws remain 
that must be addressed vigorously in future election 
processes, including: 
 
-- evidence of election law violations, primarily but not 
exclusively by the GPC, including political intimidation, 
underage voting, inappropriate behavior by security forces 
and vote buying on election day; 
 
-- obstruction by counting commissioners that has caused the 
results of more than 20 constituencies to go unannounced 72 
hours after the end of voting, calling into question the 
credibility of results in these areas.

SUBJECT: EMERGENCY ACTION COMMITTEE MEETING 04/30/03 
 
 
Classified By: ACTING DCM RUSSELL  JONES, FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (S/NF) Begin Summary:  On April 30, 2003, the Chief Of 
Mission chaired a core Emergency Action Committee meeting 
with COM, ORCA, DATT, FPD, SOC-Yemen and RSO in attendance. 
The topic of discussion was TD-3/OO/13299-03, 21 April 03, 
regarding a senior Al-Qaida planner in Saudi Arabia who was 
attempting to revive plans for a kidnapping operation 
(of US or UK citizen) in Yemen.  EAC members noted that 
election tension still remain in some districts where the 
vote has not been counted and election results are expected 
to be finalized within the next two or three days. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF) Regarding the kidnapping threat against mid-level 
officials, the EAC noted: 
- That the veracity of the source and information was 
hard to assess. 
 
- The threat information, according to ORCA, demonstrated 
the potential for a continuing threat in Yemen, showing that 
remnants of terrorist cells still want to do something. 
 
- Extreme elements are displaying disappointment in 
Al-Qaida\'s failure to follow-up on threats against 
American interests following Coalition action 
against Iraq. 
 
- Kidnapping according to ORCA, has been a historic factor 
for many years and more specific information on kidnapping 
does not necessarily mean that the threat level has risen. 
 
- EAC members agreed that no one can be certain if the 
threat is against official Americans, members of the 
western business community or both official and 
non-official Americans and other third country nationals. 
 
3.  (SBU) The EAC was unanimous in its opinion that the 
American community at large, must not become complacent 
now that a lessening of security tensions has occurred in 
Yemen following the war with Iraq and the conclusion of 
national elections. 
 
4.  (SBU) The EAC noted that community members were 
beginning to ask questions regarding the security situation 
and are looking for security guidance regarding daily 
activities within Sanaa and Yemen, following the war and 
the national elections on 27 April. 
 
5.  (C) The EAC was advised about the following RSO liaison 
and discussions with MOI: 
- The potential for kidnapping Americans (MOI provided no 
guidance). 
- The potential for transnational terrorism and border 
security (MOI indicated that border security was a very 
sensitive national security matter and RSO\'s MOI contact 
was reluctant to comment on it). 
 
6.  (SBU) The RSO also reviewed: 
- Surveillance Detection Team (SD) efforts to monitor 
Embassy Officer residences. 
- Security screening at the Sheraton Hotel with senior MOI 
officials to identify areas of improvement in security 
practices by Yemeni officials at entry points. 
 
7.  (SBU) EAC members noted the worldwide warden message 
warning Americans to be cautious during overseas travel. 
 
8.  (SBU) The Ambassador concluded the EAC meeting by 
stating that he would schedule a warden meeting with the 
wider American community to discuss post-war and 
post-election security concerns.  The Ambassador also 
directed the RSO to coordinate with the Administration 
Officer regarding follow-up with the MOI on issuance of 
non-diplomatic license plates for Embassy vehicles. 
Finally the Ambassador directed the RSO to draft a message 
to the American community regarding security awareness.

REF: SANAA 955 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.   (U)  Summary:  Despite several irregularities in 
post-election procedures, the assessment of the April 27 
elections remains generally positive, even among the 
opposition.  Observers express concern that the make-up of 
the new parliament, with its overwhelming General People\'s 
Party (GPC) majority and fairly inexperienced members, will 
weaken the institution.  Other observers point to a united 
opposition and the power of the expected Speaker of 
Parliament as factors that will serve to strengthen it. 
Several prominent figures gained seats.  The new government 
is expected to be formed by mid-May.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Negotiating the Results; 
Assessment Still Generally Positive 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  (U)  As of May 5, four seats remain undecided.  These 
seats may go into by-elections.  The results are the 
following: 
 
GPC   225 
Islah       45 
YSP         7 
Independents      14 
Baathists   2 
(pro-Syrian) 
Nasserites  3 
Undecided   4 
GPC/Islah (al-Ahmar)    1 
 
 
3.  (U)  In typical Yemeni political style, several 
unresolved constituencies are undergoing or completed 
high-level \"backroom\" negotiation towards resolution rather 
than going through the election-law mandated legal 
procedures.  For example, reliable sources indicate that 
President Saleh and the GPC offered the Islah party five 
seats in exchange for conceding one seat in Sanaa won by 
Islah -- the so-called \"unity constituency\" where the 
President voted.  The Islah party reportedly turned the offer 
down.  Many political observers cannot understand the 
candidate selection process in this important symbolic 
constituency (#11).  The GPC ran al-Masawari, a close 
associate of Saleh whose tenure as Mayor of Sanaa was so 
marked by perceptions of corruption that the joke on election 
day went \"vote for al-Masawari, or else he will go back to 
running the capital.\" 
 
4. (U)  Several pro-government and pro-opposition journalists 
told Pol/Econoff May 3 that despite the reported 
manipulations of the counting process, they still believe 
that these elections are a milestone in Yemen\'s democratic 
development.  They agreed unanimously with NDI\'s assessment 
(ref), highlighting the report\'s balance of positive and 
negative developments.  While some members of the Joint 
Meeting Parties (JMP) have called for some form of action to 
protest the results, including a boycott of parliament, most 
observers do not believe the JMP will chance losing their 
platform in parliament. 
 
5.  (U)  The JMP held a press conference May 5 (covered by 
national and international press) and announced that it would 
not withdraw from parliament, as some JMP members had 
threatened.  However, during the press conference, 
representatives from the Islah and Nasserite parties 
challenged President Saleh directly, accusing him of meddling 
in the election and calling upon him to act as a \"unifying\" 
force rather than a party leader.  President Saleh tends to 
command widespread deference, and this direct challenge 
represents a departure from the support he usually receives 
across party lines. 
 
6.  (C)  The editor-in-chief of the Islah party newspaper 
al-Sahwah, Nabil al-Sufi (please protect), said May 3 that 
his assessment was mostly positive.  He noted high turnout, 
an organized and modern campaign, vastly improved election 
administration and Islah\'s high-profile wins in Sanaa (10 of 
19 constituencies) as positive developments that show 
\"democracy works\" in Yemen.  He said that while the 
violations were troubling, it was \"to be expected\" in a 
developing democracy and he looked ahead to the next 
elections (local council and presidential in 2006) with 
optimism. 
 
---------------------------- 
Parliament Possibly Weakened; 
Lots of New (and Old) Faces 
---------------------------- 
7.  (U)  Some political observers lament the number of 
brand-new politicians to the ranks of parliament, expressing 
concern that the relatively less-educated and inexperienced 
members will weaken the parliament. While the GPC 
overwhelming majority may also serve to weaken parliament\'s 
oversight of the government, close cooperation among 
opposition parties and the power wielded by the veteran 
Speaker of Parliament, Sheikh Abdullah al-Ahmar, should 
provide a counter-balance.  Also, as noted by the GPC 
political director Mohamed Qubaty on May 5, the lack of 
complete party unity within the GPC affects the ability of 
the government to pass legislation.  Often, other 
considerations, such as tribal or regional interests, play a 
larger role than party affiliation. 
 
8.  (U)  Among the \"new blood\" are several sons of prominent 
political figures, including Dr. Rashad al-Alimi (son of the 
Minister of Interior), Sadiq Ameen Abu Ras (son of the 
Minister of Local Administration) and Ali Hassan al-Shater 
(son of a close aide to Saleh and the Editor-in-Chief of 
September 26 weekly newspaper). 
 
9.  (U)  None of the seven Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) 
winners have parliamentary experience, nor are they from the 
party\'s known current senior leadership.  However, the only 
YSP member from the 1997 parliament (who ran independent 
during the boycott) may still gain a seat, because his 
constituency remains under dispute and observers report he 
was leading the vote. 
 
10.  (C)  Two of Post\'s most useful contacts in the outgoing 
parliament, Sultan al-Barakani (Chairman of the GPC bloc) and 
Nabil Basha (Deputy Chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee), retained their seats.  Both have played effective 
roles in the parliament\'s ratification of a number of 
international conventions related to counter-terrorism. 
 
11.  (C)  Among the more infamous of winners, the GPC former 
governor of Sanaa and Marib, Naji al-Sufi, won a seat in 
Sanaa governorate.  He is known for his flagrant violations 
of human rights while he was serving as governor of Sanaa, as 
noted in the 2000 Human Rights Report, including violations 
such as attacking judges, arbitrarily arresting citizens and 
maintaining a private prison. 
 
------------------------------ 
Family Affair -- the al-Ahmars 
------------------------------ 
 
12.  (U)  Five members of the al-Ahmar family gained seats in 
parliament.  Sheikh al-Ahmar, widely expected to resume his 
post as Speaker of Parliament, is now joined by four of his 
sons.  Two are from Islah and two are from GPC, while Sheikh 
al-Ahmar was elected with the support of both parties.  This 
result is more evidence of how family and tribal ties often 
trump political party ties in Yemeni politics.  Some joke 
that the al-Ahmar bloc alone rivals that of the YSP with its 
seven members. 
 
-------------------- 
Government Formation 
-------------------- 
 
13.  (U)  The parliament will meet on May 10, and observers 
estimate that a new government will be formed by May 15. 
Details reported septel.

 1. (S/NF)  The Ambassador convened an Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) meeting on May 13  to assess the threat of a 
\"copy cat\" attack similar to Riyadh, to determine the best 
approach to ROYG officials regarding the events in Riyadh and 
to evaluate Embassy security preparedness.  Key offices and 
personnel represented at the meeting included: AMB, DCM, 
ADMIN, CONS, DAO, FPD, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, RSO and SOC 
YEMEN. 
 
2. (S/NF) DCM briefed on the events in Riyadh, reviewing the 
methodology of the attack in Riyadh and the need for Embassy 
community to be aware of potential \"copycat attacks.\" As of 
this morning, the attacks on the compounds were believed to 
be conducted by two cars, a lead car that was used to take 
out the guards, and a second car containing explosives. DCM 
stressed that this latest modus oparandi should be understood 
and incorporated into our security posture. 
 
3. (S/NF) After receiving notification of the Riyadh attacks 
just before 3 am local time, RSO notified Embassy Security, 
the Sheraton Hotel, Tourist City and Haddah compound security 
contacts and asked them all to increase security.  RSO 
briefed that some believe that the Riyadh operation may have 
been in connection with a possible hostage-taking attempt and 
noted one uncorroborated report (Ref B) of a potential for 
hostage taking in Sanaa. Per Reftels C, D, E, the RSO also 
stated that he is investigating a possible case of 
surveillance by individuals in a Saudi-plated car currently 
under investigation.  In another case, an NGO representative 
called the RSO to report a rumor that the ROYG had 
intercepted a pick up truck with UAE plates containing 
explosives. 
 
4. (S/NF) ORCA reported no new threat information concerning 
Yemen. 
 
5. (S/NF) The EAC discussed how to share information about 
this attack with ROYG officials.  The RSO will brief his MOI 
and PSO contacts with details of the attack methodology (when 
known) and raise the rumor about the UAE truck. SOC Yemen 
will discuss the same issues with CSO. 
 
6. (S/NF) DCM reviewed the Embassy security posture and the 
EAC agreed that an Admin notice should be sent to encourage 
the Embassy community to maintain vigilant security 
procedures.  Ambassador asked Consul to schedule a Warden 
meeting for this week.  DCM raised the question of whether 
the Embassy community should return to \"Move Safe Lite,\" in 
which Embassy officials are encouraged among other measures, 
to use armored shuttles and limit non-essential movement. 
EAC agreed that absent specific threats, Admin should make 
the shuttles available for those who wish, but it was not 
necessary to return to Move Safe Lite. EAC also reviewed 
present travel procedures, both for TDYers arriving in Yemen 
and within country travel, and agreed that while the 
community is still under Authorized Departure, no change was 
needed for TDYers.  In country travel procedures will 
continue to be reviewed by the RSO and coordinated with local 
government officials.

1. (U) Below is Post\'s response to the information requested 
in ref A. 
 
A. Does host government publish national budget in a timely 
manner? 
Answer: Yes, with minimum delay. 
 
B. Where Subnational levels of government are significant, 
are their combined fiscal position published. 
Answer: No, not relevant. 
 
C. In what form is the National Budget published? 
Answer: In newspaper and private media. 
 
D. Please rate the quality and comprehensiveness of fiscal 
data published. 
Answer: 2. Limited System of budget reporting, monitoring 
with limited classification system. Some payments arrears and 
deviations between actual expenditures and amounts budgeted. 
 
E. List up to 5 key laws and/or regulations governing public 
disclosure of revenues and expenditures in the national 
budget. 
Answer: The Financial Law No. (8) of 1990 and amendments 
Central Statistics Organization No (28) of 1995 
Law No. 3 of 1997 regarding Government Tendering, Auctions 
and Purchases. 
Central Bank of Yemen Law No. (14) of 2000 
Note: Each Fiscal year budget is issued by a law, and each 
development plan is issued by a law. 
 
F. Assess adequacy of those laws and regulations establishing 
fiscal transparency and accountability requirements. 
Answer: 3. Detailed Comprehensive. 
 
G. Assess extent to which laws and regulations on fiscal 
transparency and accountability are implemented or enforced. 
Answer: 2. Sporadically/unevenly enforced. 
 
H. How would distribution of tax powers and expenditure 
responsibilities of central government be described? 
Answer: 2. Currently being clarified. 
 
I. Does a national audit body or equivalent organization 
independent of the executive provide reports for the 
legislature and the public on the financial integrity of 
government accounts? 
Answer: No. 
 
J. How would the link between nonfinancial public/state owned 
(e.g. extractive industries) enterprises and general 
government be described? 
Answer: 2. Limited independence of spending/procuremement 
 
K. Are privatization processes transparent and published? 
Answer: 2. Moderately transparent. 
 
L. How would the reliability of budget revenue and 
expenditure estimates best be described? Answer: 2. 
Moderately reliable. 
 
M. Short description of host government committment to fiscal 
transparency and accountability. 
 
Answer: The Central Bank and Ministry of Finance are 
committed to fiscal transparency and publish their statistics 
on the internet, in bulletins and in local media.  Local NGOs 
have been active in anti-corruption issues, and the World 
Bank began a program in 2001 working on judicial reform and 
corruption issues. 
 
While Yemen has fundamentally sound investment laws, labor 
laws, customs tariff regulations and tax laws, transparency 
of implementation and enforcement is elusive.  The next steps 
required in Yemen\'s civil service and administrative reform 
process are to clarify procedures, create implementing 
regulations and build a mechanism to enforce these standards. 
 The formal judicial system is widely regarded as inefficient 
and corrupt.  Parliament has not passed a pending financial

REF: STATE 13796 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. In 2002, Embassy Sanaa managed several successful programs 
that encourage respect for human rights in Yemen, including 
equal access to education, human rights training for military 
officers, and 17 small grants focused on grassroots democracy 
and the development of civil society. 
 
Most notably, during 2002 preparations for the recent 
national parliamentary elections, the Mission worked closely 
with major NGOs to support nationwide voter registration 
programs, the development of political parties, women\'s 
political participation (43% of registered voters) and 
training for effective local governance.  These efforts 
culminated recently with exceptionally high participation 
(75% of all registered voters) in national elections judged 
generally free, fair and peaceful by international observers. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
HUMAN RIGHTS - A CRITICAL MISSION OBJECTIVE 
------------------------------------------- 
2. Promoting respect for human rights in Yemen is a top 
Mission priority that directly supports the essential US 
interests: eradicating terrorism and ensuring stable, 
democratic governments in the region.  Yemen is a poor 
country with explosive population growth (3.5%), traditional 
social structures that exclude women, widespread adult 
illiteracy, troublesome levels of corruption, and radical 
religious groups.  However, it has also been making 
measurable progress in moving toward democracy, the rule of 
law, and increased participation for its citizens in an 
effective civil society. 
 
3. The Embassy\'s Democracy Working Group (DWG) includes 
American and FSN members from every Country Team agency. It 
maintains close contacts with local and international NGOs, 
as well as other foreign missions working on development and 
human rights issues.  With no direct-hire American USAID 
officers at post, DWG members work together on Mission  human 
rights agenda.  They monitor grants, evaluate proposals, 
recruit promising candidates for the International Visitors\' 
Program, and visit distant field projects.  The Ambassador, 
the DCM and other officers make human rights issues a regular 
part of their conversations with leaders in every segment of 
society. 
 
---------------------- 
EDUCATING NEW LEADERS 
---------------------- 
 
4. Education/Participation:  In 2002, USDA PL 416 (B) funded 
12.4 million dollars for the construction and furnishing of 
new primary schools for girls in isolated rural areas. This 
will provide thousands of young women their first access to 
modern education and their first entry into civil society. 
The International Visitors\' Program allowed a number of young 
Yemeni leaders to share and debate US perspectives on such 
issues as \"Women as Political Partners.\" 
 
5. Military Training:  In 2002, Defense Department 
Counter-Terrorism Fellowship funds ($450,000) provided many 
opportunities for promising Yemeni officers and 
non-commissioned officers to learn increased respect for 
human rights as an essential element of their professional 
military studies.  These courses, either in the US or 
directed by US military trainers in Yemen, have produced 
gratifying results: a marked decrease in cases of human 
rights abuse by the Yemeni military.  The Embassy\'s Office of 
Military Cooperation is tracking these results to ensure the 
most effective training in years to come. 
 
------------------- 
PROMOTING DEMOCRACY 
------------------- 
 
6.  Small Grants/Big Results:  The Embassy\'s Public Diplomacy 
Office funded 17 programs throughout Yemen in 2002, totaling 
almost $100,000, through the Democracy Small Grants Projects: 
The individual cost of these programs is small, but the goals 
are ambitious.  For example: to \"Educate Society Leaders in 
Human Rights Law\" ten influential preachers/prayer leaders 
from mosques throughout the country gathered for a series of 
workshops on political, civil and constitutional rights 
guaranteed under Yemen\'s new Human Rights Law.  To combat 
\"Violence Against Women\", project leaders drawn from local 
women\'s groups worked with officials from several Ministries 
to raise  awareness of the psychological, medical, criminal, 
cultural and legal roots of these crimes.  This 2002 
initiative helped lead to the recent establishment of a 
national network of women\'s groups helping victims of 
domestic violence. 
 
7.  Training Local Councils: In 2002, the National Democratic 
Institute (NDI) began an ambitious program to train local 
councils.  Throughout Yemen, local councils control 
significant resources and provide basic services to Yemen\'s 
population: trained members are essential to combat 
traditional problems of patronage, corruption, and gender 
bias.   The Mission will continue to work closely with NDI on 
this ongoing project, and seek additional funding for it from 
the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI), the Economic 
Support Fund (ESF) and the Middle East Democracy Fund (MEDF). 
 
8.  The Infrastructure of Free Elections: NDI and the 
International Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) also 
provided special training in 2002 to strengthen Yemen\'s 
multi-party system.  Funds from MEPI and MEDF helped support 
comprehensive technical and organizational assistance to the 
Government of Yemen.  NDI staffers worked directly with local 
political activists, focusing on women\'s political 
participation, voter registration, and local governance. 
 
9.  The Results: In the April, 2003 national parliamentary 
elections,  Yemen scored encouraging international marks for 
organization, participation, and security. The Ambassador and 
twenty-five Embassy Sanaa staffers joined international 
election observers from IFES, NDI, the EU and the United 
Nations, at polling places throughout the country.  Although 
much work remains, 2002 was a year of progress for human 
rights in Yemen, with positive and measurable results.  The 
MIssion will continue to build on that record.

REF: SANAA 1099 
 
1. At approximately 0900 on May 14, 2003 an explosion 
occurred at a courtroom next to Ibb central prison, slightly 
injuring Judge Haizam Naji Fadl. Fadl was not/not the judge 
who presided over the recently concluded trial of Mr. Kemal 
who was convicted of killing three Amcits at the Jibla 
hospital. Information obtained to date does not indicate a 
connection with that trial. 
 
----------------------- 
MOI: It Was an Accident 
----------------------- 
 
2. Ministry of Interior office director Brigadier General 
Ahmed Sunidar  confirmed to RSO that a explosion occurred at 
in the Court of Appeals next to the Ibb Central Prison, 
located approximately 125 miles south of Sanaa.  According to 
the initial report by the MOI, a soldier guarding the judge 
dropped a hand grenade, wounding the judge. This explanation 
is improbable. Embassy conoff who attended the trial in Jibla 
reports that he did not see guards carrying grenades. 
Subsequent accounts indicating that a grenade was thrown into 
the courtroom are more likely. 
 
----------------------- 
Which courtroom was it? 
----------------------- 
 
3. AFP reported that the incident occurred in another court 
than the Jibla trial and that the perpetrator was arrested 
shortly afterwards.  A judge at the same courthouse, reported 
to a Consular FSN that the explosion took place during a 
trial that had been moved from Yarim to Ibb for \"security 
reasons.\"  Later, Consular FSN talked to Ibb Prison Warden 
Mohammed Al-Saidi, who said that the bomb exploded in the 
same courtroom where the Jibla shooter trial was held. 
 
4. Comment: As in the case with previous incidents in Yemen, 
conflicting reports are common. Post is seeking further 
clarification with MOI and sources in Ibb.  The information 
available so far does not establish a connection between this 
incident and the judge in the recently concluded Jibla trail. 
End Comment.

-------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (C) On May 14, Deputy FM al-Radi called in the DCM to 
deliver a condolence letter from ROYG President Salih to 
President Bush for the 5/13 Riyadh bombings.  The letter 
expresses condolences for the American victims\' families, 
condemnation of the terror acts, and Yemen\'s commitment to 
the war on terrorism. While delivering the letter, al-Radi 
spoke about ROYG-US security cooperation, the US-Saudi 
relationship, and the situation in Iraq since the return of 
Shia leader Mohammed Bakir al-Hakim. 
 
----------------- 
CONDOLENCE LETTER 
----------------- 
 
2. (U)  The DCM, accompanied by polecon chief, was convoked 
on 5/14 by Abdullah Ali al-Radi, MFA Deputy Minister for 
Arab, Asian and African Affairs, to receive a condolence 
letter from ROYG President Ali Abdullah Salih to President 
Bush.  The letter (text below in para 7) expresses emphatic 
condemnation of the Riyadh bombings as terror acts 
incompatible with all religious teachings and reaffirms 
Salih\'s previous pledges of partnership with the US in 
combating terrorism. 
 
3. (C)  Al-Radi also expressed his own personal condolences. 
The DCM briefed him on the methodology of the attacks, 
stressing that security practices in Yemen and elsewhere must 
adjust to counter the evolving tactics of the terrorists. 
The DCM took the opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding 
cooperation the Embassy receives from ROYG security forces 
protecting the Embassy, the Hadda compound (predominately 
American and international residents), the Sheraton Hotel, 
which hosts many American visitors, and Embassy residences. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
REGIONAL ISSUES - SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAQ 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Al-Radi was curious about US-Saudi relations in the 
aftermath of the attacks, given the tensions existing since 
9/11. The DCM assured him that friendship and cooperation 
between Saudi Arabia and the US have stood the test of many 
years. 
 
5. (C) Turning to Iraq, Al Radi asked for an update on the 
security situation, especially since the return of Shia 
leader Mohammed Bakir al-Hakim from Iran.  Will the US be 
able to prevent a three-part ethnic breakup of the country? 
The Coalition\'s prompt establishment of three administrative 
divisions had provoked much speculation among Yemenis, he 
said. The DCM reminded him of the U.S. Administration\'s firm 
commitment to the territorial integrity of Iraq and 
underscored U.S. determination to restore essential services 
and help the Iraqi people build a better future. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) Al Radi stretched the delivery of the condolence 
letter into an hour\'s conversation on current events.  His 
questions on Iraq\'s potential problems with Shia separatism 
and Saudi Arabia\'s current unenviable position may have been 
posed with the imminent arrival of Iranian President Khatami 
in mind. Khatami\'s official visit began today, 5/15.

TEXT OF SALIH CONDOLENCE LETTER 
-------------------------------- 
 
Dear friend Mr. President George W. Bush, 
President of the United States of America, Washington 
 
I was greatly moved and felt deep sorrow to receive the news 
that a number of American citizens had fallen victim to the 
distressing terrorist attack targeting several residential 
compounds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 
 
As we express to you our emphatic condemnation of this 
shameful terrorist act, I offer my sincere sympathy for the 
victims who fell as a result of it and convey our deepest 
condolences to the families of the victims and to the 
friendly American people. 
 
Such terrorist acts, which are incompatible with all 
religious teachings and proper humanitarian values, can only 
heighten the determination of the international community to 
move forward and redouble its efforts to combat and eradicate 
terrorism and prevent the loss of innocent souls.  We affirm 
to you that the Republic of Yemen, which rejects terrorism in 
all its forms and aspects and from whatever source, will 
remain an effective partner to your friendly country and to 
the international community in combating terrorism and 
confronting its perpetrators. 
Please accept my highest regards.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C)  Qassem Salam, the Secretary General of Yemen\'s Arab 
Socialist Baath Party slunk back from Baghdad in late April. 
In a May 6 interview with a London Arab paper, he claimed 
ROYG President Salih had recently praised Saddam Hussein as a 
\"brave struggler\".  The MFA declares a complete mis-quote, 
and insists Salam is headed for the political sunset. End 
Summary 
 
-------------------------- 
YEMENI BAATHIST COMES HOME 
-------------------------- 
2. U) In a meeting on other subjects (reported septel), the 
DCM queried Abul al-Saleem al-Awadhi, MFA Director of the 
Americas Desk, about statements made by Qassem Salam, 
secretary-general of Yemen\'s Arab Socialist Baath Party (the 
 
SIPDIS 
Iraqi,as opposed to Syrian, wing of the party).  Qassem 
Salam, who was resident in Iraq, fled Baghdad on April 12. 
 
3. (U) Salam\'s May 6 interview with London\'s Al-Arab 
al-Alamiyah  gained some local and international media 
attention when he claimed knowledge that Saddam Hussein was 
still alive, preparing to organize \"tough, decisive, 
historic\" resistance to coalition forces, 
 
4. (U) While these delusions may be Salam\'s last gasp at 
attention, he also referred to a meeting he had with ROYG 
President Ali Abdullah Salih after returning from Baghdad. 
Salam claimed that President Salih was, Quote: pained by what 
happened...and stressed his conviction that Saddam Hussain 
was a brave and generous struggler...however, like any other 
leader, he had his mistakes and positive points. End Quote. 
 
----------------------- 
NOT BRAVE, NOT GENEROUS 
------------------------ 
5. (C)  When the DCM asked for clarification of these 
remarks, al-Awadhi quickly responded that they were 
inaccurate.  President Salih had not praised Saddam Hussain, 
although he may well be pained by the situation of the Iraqi 
people. Qassem Salam had misinterpreted his words.  In 
addition, the President had received Qassem Salam only as the 
Secretary General of a registered political party that was 
 
SIPDIS 
fielding candidates in Yemen\'s approaching parliamentary 
elections. 
 
5. (C) The DCM pointed out that the presidential meeting had 
given Salam both prestige and opportunities for mischief, 
al-Awadhi assured him that it was unlikely to be repeated. 
The Iraqi wing of the Baath Socialist party had not won a 
single seat in the elections, and Salam would soon fade away. 
 After a short nostalgic review of the Baath Party\'s long ago 
days of intellectual respectability under party founder 
Michel Aflaq, Al Awadhi reiterated his point: President Salih 
is not at all \"pained\" by the fate of Saddam Hussain. 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
6.  (c) Qassem Salam is a fading figure, and his quotes 
regarding President Salih\'s views on Saddam\'s moral character 
were never credible.  Nevertheless, we believe it was 
worthwhile to remind the ROYG that the USG will be paying 
attention to the fate of the (never terribly relevant) Iraqi 
Baath Party in Yemen.  We predict Qassem Salam will not be 
meeting again soon with President Salih or finding a 
political spotlight in Yemen.

REF: SANAA 1105 
 
1. On May 15, one day after an explosion occurred in the same 
courthouse in Ibb as the recently concluded trail of the 
Jibla hospital murders, more details have emerged that point 
to this incident being a result of a tribal dispute. 
 
2.  Ibb PSO officer al-Kudaimi, told Consular FSN that a 
night-shift military guard allowed the perpetuators to place 
the bomb inside the appeals courtroom the night before the 
incident occurred. The next morning, the bomb went off as the 
judge entered the room, slightly injuring him.  PSO reports 
no other casualties. 
 
3.  Al-Kudaimi reported that nine or ten individuals 
allegedly connected to the attack were arrested and charged 
with disturbing the peace. Further charges will be added 
pending the results of a task-force investigation.  The 
murder trial that was being held in the courtroom where the 
explosion took place was originally held in Yarim, but was 
moved to Ibb for security reasons.  Al-Kudaimi stressed that 
PSO does not believe this is related to any extremist 
activity, and believes that the man\'s fellow tribesmen sought 
revenge for his murder conviction. 
 
4. Ministry of Interior officials told RSO they had no new 
information to report. 
 
5. Comment: As more information comes to light, the courtroom 
explosion increasly appears to be the result of a tribal 
dispute and not related to al-Qaeda or other extremist 
activity. There is no indication of a link to the recent 
conviction of the Jibla hospital murderer. End Comment.

Summary 
------- 
1. (C): Begin Summary: ROYG Prime Minister Ba Jammal\'s new 
Cabinet (complete list para 12) introduces several fresh 
faces, but incumbents retain the major ministries and all 
Ministers are members of the General People\'s Congress (GPC). 
At a glance: 
-  By relative population, the South (10 Ministers) outweighs 
the North (25 Ministers) and scores important portfolios for 
junior technocrats. 
-  The average age drops, ten Ministers are Members of 
Parliament, purely tribal/family influence has waned and 
education levels are high. 
-  Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Ahmed 
Sofan wins the added title of Deputy Prime Minister. 
-  The sole female Minister takes her female predecessor\'s 
portfolio, but is moved up to full Minister. 
-  Some former Ministers with poor records are  dismissed; 
others with marginal reputations remain. 
 
2. (C) The new Cabinet is ready for business and tasked with 
reform.  It should perform adequately. However, by limiting 
Ministers to GPC party stalwarts, and selecting only one 
woman for the Cabinet, Prime Minister Ba Jammal seems to have 
aimed for business as usual over bold change. End Summary 
 
---------------------- 
Fifty Percent Turnover 
---------------------- 
3. (U) On May 17, ROYG President Ali Abdullah Salih approved 
the new Cabinet presented by incumbent Prime Minister Abdul 
Qadir Ba Jammal.   The list includes 15 new ministers (and 
two former ministers with new portfolios) in a total Cabinet 
of 35, a near fifty percent replacement rate.  However, the 
most important Ministries are unchanged: Alawi Saleh 
Al-Salami as Deputy Prime Minister/Finance Minister, Abubakir 
Abdullah al-Qirbi in Foreign Affairs, Abdullah Alaywah in 
Defense, Rashad al-Alimi in Interior and Ahmed Mohammed Sofan 
as Minister of Planning and International Cooperation. 
 
------------------------------ 
Minister of Planning Promoted 
----------------------------- 
4. (C) The most important change from the Embassy\'s 
perspective may be Ahmed Sofan\'s promotion to Deputy Prime 
Minister, retaining his portfolio as Minister of Planning and 
International Cooperation (no longer \"Planning and 
Development\".)  Some observers believe the Prime Minister 
needs him as a counterweight to the powerful Finance 
Minister, Alawi Saleh al-Salami, who reigned as sole Deputy 
Prime Minister in the previous cabinet.  Comment: While 
al-Salami gets good marks from the World Bank and others for 
his strict monetary policy, he has been less effective in 
advancing business and development.  In contrast, Sofan, a 
successful businessman by background, has made his planning 
and development portfolio a center for long-term investments 
in Yemen\'s social and human resources. End Comment 
 
------------------------ 
The South Keeps Its Edge 
------------------------ 
5. (U) The North/South tally of cabinet seats (25/10) is 
still tipped toward Aden by relative population 
(approximately 16 million to four million.)  In addition, 
several new Cabinet Ministers have portfolios that reflect 
the long-standing Southern edge in education and 
international business.  The new Ministers of Justice, 
Transportation, Fisheries, Industry, Higher Education and 
Technical Education have impressive credentials as Southern 
technocrats. 
 
------------ 
DEMOGRAPHICS 
------------ 
6. (U) The average age of the Cabinet has declined, with two 
young Ministers and no elder statesmen.  For example, the new 
Ministers of both Justice and Agriculture are thirty-four, 
but most Ministers weigh in with solid forties and fifties. 
In a sign of growing technocracy, 12 Ministers have PhD\'s and 
seven have MA\'s.  Only four Ministers come from wealthy 
commercial families and only three have important tribal 
standing.  The single woman member is a notable Cabinet 
standout.  Former Ambassador to the Netherlands Amat al-Alim 
al-Soswah takes the designated female portfolio of Human 
Rights, but as a concession to her public stature, she was 
elevated to full Minister, rather than Minister of State. 
 
------------------------- 
New Stars For The Party? 
------------------------- 
7. (U) Ten Ministers are Members of Parliament, including 
seven impressive first-time winners in the recent elections. 
Sanaa\'s mayor, Ahmed al-Kohlani, Minister of State without 
Portfolio, may be the most outstanding, given his effective 
administrative record.  His tribal connections, while 
important, may be less of a factor than his high popularity 
in the capital city. 
 
8. (U) The new Ministers of Agriculture, Justice, Transport 
and Civil Service also shine as freshman Parliamentarians. 
They all showed electoral prowess, and now have the fortune 
to replace marginally effective former Ministers.  The GPC 
will mark these new party stars for bright futures if they 
can manage their first portfolios more successfully than 
their predecessors. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (U) Yemen is changing, and even such establishment 
institutions as the Cabinet are beginning to reflect more 
important priorities than tribal and regional preferences. 
For example, the distinction between North and South may 
gradually be losing its importance as groups begin to align 
by common interests and issues:  political parties; business; 
religion; reform. 
 
10. (C) Ba Jammal could and should have nominated a number of 
well-qualified female Ministers.  However, his sole choice is 
a good one.  She may help pave the way for more 
representative government in the future.  The Cabinet\'s 
educated young technocrats have impressive credentials and 
should be able to conduct public business with more 
credibility than their predecessors. By ridding himself of 
deadwood (like the former Education Minister) Ba Jammal 
should accomplish more in his second term. 
 
11. (C) The GPC\'s landslide victory in the recent elections, 
although hampered by losses in Sanaa and tarnished by 
controversy over vote-counting in some districts, gives the 
government a solid mandate for its programs.   The GPC must 
now show the public that it heard the electorate\'s clear 
calls for government reform.  Ba Jammal seems to have split 
the difference - continuity in the power ministries but 
significant change elsewhere. End Comment

------ 
SUMMARY 
 ------ 
 
1. (C) Summary.  The Foreign Minister\'s Office Director 
confirms that Iraq\'s former Ambassador left Sanaa before the 
war, that the remaining diplomats are keeping a low profile, 
and that the ROYG continues to protect the Embassy as 
inviolable diplomatic premises. In these circumstances, he 
believes it impractical to make promises about Iraqi 
diplomatic files or consular seals. Also, two Yemeni 
diplomats remained in Iraq throughout the war: they report no 
major problems to date. End Summary 
 
---------------------------- 
No Iraqi Ambassador in Yemen 
---------------------------- 
2. (u) On May 20, Pol/Econ chief discussed the reorganization 
of the Iraqi MFA with Marwan Noman, Office Director for 
Foreign Minister Qirbi. He promised to convey to the Minister 
the non-paper containing reftel talking points immediately, 
in preparation for his subsequent meeting with Ambassador 
Hull. 
 
3. (C) Noman confirmed that Iraq\'s Ambassador to Yemen, Taha 
Y. Al Basri, left Sanaa before the war began. The remaining 
diplomats are keeping a low profile now, and the embassy 
premises are guarded, as before, by ROYG soldiers.  He did 
not know if they had been contacted by the Iraqi MFA steering 
committee headed by Ambassador Ahmed. 
 
-------------------------- 
But What About the Babies? 
-------------------------- 
4. (C)  Noman agreed that it would be \"most inappropriate\" 
for the remaining diplomats to exercise any diplomatic 
authority.  However, as a lawyer who specializes in 
diplomatic law, he personally questioned the need to suspend 
consular functions, especially services to expatriate Iraqi 
citizens.  \"If an Iraqi baby is born, or an Iraqi marries a 
Yemeni, their papers must be endorsed by their Embassy.  Who 
else would do that?  The American Embassy as the occupying 
power?\"  He stressed again that his questions were personal 
and hypothetical, but he hoped the impending United Nations 
resolution on Iraq would clarify the responsibilities of the 
occupying power. 
 
5.  (C) As for ensuring that the Iraqi staff do not remove 
diplomatic files or consular seals, he speculated that they 
had burned anything they wanted to well before the 
Ambassador\'s departure.  Since the Embassy chancery and 
grounds remained inviolable diplomatic premises, the MFA can 
not prevent future bonfires, or take an inventory of 
sensitive diplomatic and consular material. 
 
---------------------------- 
The Foreign Minister Concurs 
---------------------------- 
6. (C)  FM Qirbi reiterated the same line in a 5/22 meeting 
with Ambassador Hull (other subjects reported septel). He 
noted that an initial concern had been to protect the two 
remaining Iraqi diplomats from possible attack by Iraqi 
expats resident in Yemen.  They remain under security 
surveillance but no such attack has materialized.  Qirbi 
added that several Iraqi academics he knows intend to remain 
in Yemen for some time, but eventually want to return to 
Iraq. 
 
--------------------------- 
Yemeni Diplomats in Baghdad 
--------------------------- 
7. (U) Noman confirmed that two diplomats remain in Yemen\'s 
Baghdad Embassy.  The embassy is undamaged, and the diplomats 
have reported by radio to Sanaa that they are well. Noman was 
not aware of any contacts with ORHA. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
8. (C) Comment:  The Yemen Government is probably relieved 
that the Iraqi Ambassador did not stick around to become an 
embarrassment. While Noman claims \"diplomatic inviolability\" 
cloaks the remaining Iraqi diplomats in the embassy, we 
expect the ROYG is keeping a very good eye on their 
activities. End Comment

Classified By: DCM ALAN MISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (E) 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. C) Iranian President Mohammed Khatami\'s May 15/18 visit to 
Yemen was low-key, almost pro forma, with little public 
exposure and no overtures to Yemen\'s large Shi\'a community. 
Although six cooperative agreements were signed, in areas 
from security to shipping, the accords broke little new 
ground. The joint statement released on his departure was 
anodyne, calling for \"foreign troops to end their occupation 
of Iraq.\"  Relations have improved in recent years and 
Khatami showed a friendly face.  But the visit does not seem 
to signal great advances in mutual confidence. End Summary 
 
----------------- 
LOW-KEY FORMALITY 
----------------- 
 
2. (C)  Iran\'s President Mohammed Khatami, returning ROYG 
President Salih\'s 2002 visit to Tehran, was welcomed with all 
presidential courtesies in Sanaa on May 15. His schedule was 
formal, with few public events. All proper protocol was 
observed, including joint arrival statements with television 
coverage. The two presidents were photographed beaming 
cordially across the interpreter; in a rare departure from 
his usual formal habits, President Salih wore Yemeni native 
dress, with the traditional jambiah dagger in his belt. 
 
--------- 
PHOTO OPS 
--------- 
 
3. (C)  Khatami\'s official meetings were appropriately 
scheduled with the highest ranking local notables, including 
Speaker of Parliament, Sheikh Abdullah al-Ahmar, Shura 
Council head, Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani, and Prime Minister 
Abdul Qadir Ba Jammal. Katemi also had an unusual private 
meeting with Ahmad Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president\'s 33 
year old son who commands the Republican Guard, but no 
substantive military contacts. The opening greetings at all 
these meetings were duly photographed for television and 
newspapers, but the conversations were merely summarized as 
\"friendly exchanges of views.\" 
 
------------------ 
WHAT DIDN\'T HAPPEN 
------------------ 
 
4. (C) Khatami did not address any public gatherings during 
his visit, such as university students or parliamentary 
groups, did not meet with any local Shi\'a clerics, and gave 
no interviews to the local media. He  visited Sanaa\'s famous 
Grand Mosque (which dates from the seventh century founding 
of Islam) but as a tourist rather than a worshiper.  Local 
television covered President Salih attendance at Friday 
prayers at the same mosque, escorted by his usual retainers 
but without his Iranian visitors. 
 
-------------- 
THE AGREEMENTS 
-------------- 
 
5. (C) The two sides signed agreements in six areas, 
including  security, trade, development and economic 
cooperation, banking, education and culture and shipping. 
According to one Yemeni contact in the Ministery of 
Development and International Cooperation, the two agreements 
signed in his office were \"fill in the blanks\" documents with 
few specific references to Yemeni conditions.  Press accounts 
of the security accord refer to increased cooperation on 
fighting drug trafficing and organized crime. (Other details 
about security cooperation are reported reftel.) 
 
6.(C) The more specific agreements focused on trade, 
education, and shipping.  Bilateral trade has grown tenfold 
since 1990 and Iranian goods are increasingly found in local 
markets, including machine tools, pharmaceuticals, and small 
buses. (These products often beat European, Asian and 
American products on price, FOB Aden, and are considered good 
quality by local merchants.) Iranian companies have completed 
several projects here, including the Socotra airport strip, 
improvements to Hodeidah\'s oil port anchorage, and road 
paving works. In education, Iran offered a number of 
scholarships and exchange programs as well as a schedule for 
increased \"cultural functions.\" The shipping agreement 
reflects Yemen\'s need to increase traffic through the port of 
Aden; more Iranian cargo and tanker ships would be most 
welcome, whether to transship goods, or merely for bunkering 
stops. 
 
 
------------------- 
THE JOINT STATEMENT 
------------------- 
 
7. (C) The anodyne joint statement signed by Salih and 
Khatemi may also have been a cut and paste exercise: there is 
little to distinguish Yemen\'s document from other stops on 
Khatami\'s Arab Tour 2003.  Predictably, both leaders praised 
brotherly relations, called for immediate withdrawal of 
foreign troops from Iraq, stressed the pivotal role of the UN 
and renewed their dedication to the legitimate rights of the 
Palestinian people, including Jerusalem as their capital. 
They did strongly denounce and condemn terrorism, but drew a 
distinction between it and \"legitimate national resistance\" 
movements. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.(C)  Khatami\'s recent tour focused on Arab countries with 
large Shi\'a communities embedded among Sunnis.  But, in Yemen 
at least, pastoral or leadership pretensions were not 
apparent.  He seemed to go out of his way to be 
non-threatening to his Yemeni hosts, who had viewed past 
Iranian leaders with deep suspicion.  The visit had some 
practical benefits: ROYG President Salih enjoys the prestige 
of international visitors, growing commercial ties make 
economic sense, and poor Yemeni students, especially those 
majoring in religious and legal training, will gratefully 
accept scholarships to Iran. However, as one MFA contact 
commented, the visit did little to strengthen ties between 
Yemen and Iran, because no one expects Khatami to hold power 
much longer \"between you Americans and the Mullahs.\"

1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  The Ambassador convened an Emergency 
Action Committee (EAC) meeting on May 27 to assess Embassy 
security posture in light of recent unspecified threat 
information.  Post is working closely with ROYG to review 
security, and continues to endorse the return of minor 
dependents.  EAC also discussed confusion surrounding the 
text of a recent travel warning.  End summary.

5/27 EAC meeting included: ADMIN, AMB, CONS, DCM, FPD, 
LEGATT, MSG, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, RSO, and SOC YEMEN. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  LEGATT, ORCA, and RSO reported ongoing efforts to 
clarify unspecified threat information recently provided by a 
U.S. law enforcement agency.  Post has identified no specific 
area of concern based on this information, and numerous 
security enhancements are already in place including 
increased security at the Hadda and Tourist City compounds 
and the Sheraton Hotel.  Efforts are underway to seek 
clarification of the information. 
 
---------------- 
Minor Dependents 
---------------- 
 
4.  (S/NF)  In light of recent events in the region, members 
of the EAC reviewed and upheld post\'s decision to recommend 
the return of minor dependents.  Several participants noted 
the impossibility of proving a negative, i.e. that no 
terrorist strike against U.S. interests would occur in Yemen, 
despite the absence of information indicating a current 
threat.  The Ambassador noted that work undertaken to enhance 
the security posture of U.S.-related sites after the attacks 
in Riyadh and Casablanca demonstrates the continuing 
effectiveness of security cooperation with ROYG authorities. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  The EAC noted that, in March 2002, post requested 
and received approval for the return of adult dependents. 
Eighteen months later the security measures employed by Post 
with ROYG cooperation have proven effective.  No adult 
dependent has been targeted, victimized, or identified as a 
security liability.  Post reiterates its recommendation for 
the return of minor dependents. 
 
-------------- 
Travel Warning 
-------------- 
 
6.  (S/NF)  EAC members expressed concern over confusion 
caused by a recent travel warning announcing the cancellation 
of authorized departure while reiterating advice to American 
citizens to leave Yemen.  Some Embassy contacts apparently 
interpreted this announcement as an indication of a new 
threat and a signal of the Embassy\'s eminent closure.  EAC 
members will review the text of the announcement to identify 
areas that should be considered for revision.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (S) Summary: The head of the Americas Desk at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs had little substantive comment on 
the USG designation of the al-Aqsa Foundation as a Foreign 
Terrorist Organization. Al-Aqsa is a sensitive subject in 
Yemen and USG efforts to extradite al-Aqsa\'s local leader, 
Sheikh Muhammad Ali Hassan al-Muayad, from his current German 
detention are not popular. We may see some public reaction to 
the designation: at the same time our demarche was presented, 
a public demonstration was calling for the release of 
al-Muayad.  End Summary 
 
--------------------------- 
REQUESTING ROYG COOPERATION 
--------------------------- 
2. (S) On May 26, Pol/Econ Chief spoke with Abdul Salam 
al-Awadhi, the head of the MFA\'s America\'s desk, and Dirham 
al-Saidi, USA desk officer, about USG plans to freeze assets 
of the al-Aqsa Foundation and designate it as a Foreign 
Terrorist Organization.  Using reftel talking points and 
background information (left as a non-paper) she emphasized 
current international cooperation to end terrorist financing, 
and Yemen\'s critical role in that campaign.  To support these 
efforts, the USG urged ROYG action to investigate the local 
branch of the al-Aqsa Foundation, to freeze its assets and to 
block the transfer of its funds. 
 
3. (S)  Al-Awadhi responded very briefly on substance, noting 
that the issue remains sensitive.   He believes the Al-Aqsa 
Foundation\'s Sanaa office is still open, but has no 
information about its activities. He recalled previous 
instances of close cooperation between Yemen and the US on 
terrorist matters, and promised that the al-Aqsa designation 
information would be promptly conveyed to the appropriate 
authorities and held confidential until the US public 
announcement. 
 
4. (C) Al-Awadhi and al-Saidi spoke at some length about 
Islamic traditions of charity, without specifically 
mentioning al-Aqsa or its leader, Sheikh Muhammad al-Muayad. 
Yemenis, like other Arabs, were angered by the plight of the 
Palestinians and gave charity to help them.  If such 
generosity had been subverted by terrorists, they agreed that 
governments must monitor charitable operations.  However, not 
everyone who supported the Palestinians was a terrorist.  The 
POL/ECON chief firmly rejected that linkage: the USG funds 
humanitarian relief to the Palestinians and encourages others 
to do so as well.  Terrorism is an entirely different 
subject. 
 
--------------------------- 
DEMONSTRATION FOR AL-MUAYAD 
--------------------------- 
5. (C) Returning from the MFA, the Embassy vehicle was forced 
to detour several blocks by a demonstration in Tahrir 
(Liberation) Square. According to local press accounts, more 
than 5,000 people attended the demonstration in support of 
al-Muayad, calling for the ROYG to insist on his immediate 
release from German detention, and to resist US efforts to 
obtain his extradition. (RSO local staff estimated the actual 
number of demonstrators at around 800.) 
 
6. (C) Islaah, the conservative Islamic political party that 
came second in Yemen\'s recent parliamentary elections, 
sponsored the rally. The popular prayer leader, radical 
Sheikh Abdul Majid al-Zindani addressed the crowd, calling on 
President Ali Abdullah Salih to protect al-Muayad and bring 
him home.  According to press accounts, Salih recently 
authorized the use of public funds for al-Muayad\'s defense in 
the German courts, and plans to raise the matter during his 
previously scheduled visit to Germany next month. 
 
----------------------- 
THE GERMANS ARE QUERIED

1. (C) Summary: Newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister for Planning and International Cooperation Ahmed 
Sofan outlined the new government\'s priorities to Ambassador 
in a courtesy call on May 26. Sofan also said that he expects 
the long-delayed gun-control legislation to pass Parliament. 
Welcoming President Bush\'s free trade proposal, Sofan 
reinforced his committment to cooperate fully with the USG on 
assistance-related issues. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On May 26, Ambassador paid a congratulatory call on 
newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Planning and International Cooperation Ahmed Sofan.  Sofan 
was promoted in the recently formed cabinet from Minister of 
Planning and Development to Deputy Prime Minister and his 
ministry was given new oversight authority over international 
cooperation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
New Agenda: Economics and Combating Terrorism 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (U) Sofan highlighted three priorities for the new 
government\'s agenda: economic reforms, implementation of the 
poverty reduction strategy formulated by the World Bank, and 
enhancing counterterrorism activities. 
 
4. (C) Expressing concern over the effect of declining oil 
prices on the Yemeni economy, Sofan said that if oil prices 
fall below 25 USD a barrel the ROYG may seek donor support. 
Even now, he added that the public may be surprised at next 
year\'s budget, implying that there may be cuts.  Adding that 
regional economic cooperation has not fulfilled expectations, 
Sofan said that the Yemeni public may see a disconnect 
between their social welfare needs and the current economic 
reality. 
 
5. (C)  Sofan predicted that he thought Yemen would be more 
forthcoming in the political realm of combating terrorism by 
making its position very clear to the public.  On a related 
issue, the Ambassador raised the long-delayed gun control 
legislation -- which inter alia could ban private ownership 
of MANPADS -- and noted its passage would be an \"important 
step.\" Sofan responded by saying that he thought they were 
going to succeed in gaining its passage. 
 
 
------------------------------------- 
Free Trade Agreement: Supportive, but 
Regional Integration Faces Hurdles 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Sofan supports President Bush\'s Middle East Free Trade 
Initiative because he believes it will offer better 
assistance to the private sector than other USG assistance 
projects.  He specifically asked for an American firm to help 
with Yemen\'s public relations and complained that the ROYG 
received very little assistance in that area from other 
donors. Programs funded by the USG through the National 
Democratic Institute to facilitate democracy, Sofan added, 
were helping Yemen\'s reputation.  However, he repeated, an 
American PR firm was the best solution to promote Yemen\'s 
tourism, business and image abroad. 
 
7. (C) Turning to the possibility of regional free trade 
agreements, Sofan recalled that in the past, internal Arab 
politics had frustrated regional trade promotion programs. 
Recalling the first Arab Free Trade Agreement in 1958, Sofan 
declared that no progress has been made since then to 
facilitate trade. Moreover, the U.S. Free Trade Agreement 
with Jordan has hurt Egyptian textile trade with the U.S. 
Sofan noted that the Gulf countries have similar economies 
and must compete against each other for business. 
 
8. (C) Instead, Sofan encouraged the USG to consider short 
term initiatives that would help the Yemeni economy and 
pledged that he would work with the USG to determine what was 
needed. For example, he thought the Ministry of Trade and 
Industry may need special experts on preparation of documents 
for World Trade Organization accession. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Civil Service Reform: The Slower Approach 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8. (C)  Sofan reinforced the new government\'s committment to 
civil service reform, saying there was \"no question of not 
doing it.\" Suggesting that as many as 300,000 civil servants 
would eventually have to be laid off, and that salaries would 
have to be raised to ten times the amount presently offered, 
Sofan said the new government would embark, of necessity, on 
a \"slower approach\" to civil service reform.  The government 
will focus on encouraging employees to retire, ending \"double 
dippers\" (people who hold jobs at more than one ministry) and 
minimizing the bureaucracy. Sofan added that the World Bank 
program on civil service reform would not be sufficient to 
carry out a complete overhaul of the civil serve and there 
may be areas for future USG cooperation. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Encouraging Increased Interaction 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Positively assessing USG and ROYG assistance 
cooperation, Sofan pledged to continue USG and ROYG close 
interaction, especially with the imminent arrival of USAID. 
Ambassador described the process that determines whether 
Yemen qualifies for the Millennium Challenge Account and 
pointed out that he may return to Sofan and ask for his 
specific help in certain categories where Yemen may fall 
short. Sofan agreed and pledged to work closely on MCA. 
Sofan closed by explaining that his new Ministry was created 
to centralize all interaction on assistance, with the goal of 
stemming corruption. Before, he added, too many Ministries 
were involved in making decisions on assistance and this 
process allowed for corruption.

YEMEN 
 
REF: A. SANAA 1078

     C. SANAA 1066 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------------ 
Introduction 
------------ 
 
1. (S/NF)  The Ambassador has briefed President Saleh on your 
visit.  Saleh wishes to meet with you and welcomes the 
establishment of a LEGATT office in Sanaa.  As noted in the 
2002 Patterns of Global Terrorism Report, ROYG has provided 
\"excellent cooperation with the U.S.\"  Your visit could 
hardly be better timed.  Having just mounted successful 
parliamentary elections and weathered the anxieties generated 
by the war in Iraq, Saleh and his newly formed government are 
in an upbeat mood as they formulate their agenda for the next 
two years.  CT cooperation with the USG figures prominently 
in that agenda.  Pushing for sustained Yemeni efforts to 
re-capture Cole suspects and enlisting Saleh\'s personal 
support for the LEGATT office should be two primary 
objectives of this visit. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Yemen Minister of Interior (MOI) Alimi also looks 
forward to meeting with you during your visit.  Alimi has 
plans for expanding MOI\'s CT capabilities and has requested 
the FBI\'s cooperation and assistance.  The other key 
interlocutor for you here will be General Ghaleb Gamish, head 
of the Political Security Organization (PSO -- Yemen\'s 
intelligence service).  Both should be included in your 
meeting or luncheon with Saleh. 
 
-------- 
OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
3.  (C)  U.S. relations with Yemen, the poorest and most 
populous nation on the Arabian Peninsula, have improved 
steadily in recent years.  Yemen has made commendable 
progress in political and economic reform, and internal 
security. 
 
4.  (C)  Since unification in 1990, Yemen has taken numerous 
steps to broaden political participation.  Yemen was the 
first country on the Arabian Peninsula to have universal 
suffrage and the first to have direct presidential elections. 
 Yemen held remarkably peaceful and orderly parliamentary 
elections on April 27, and a new cabinet has been appointed. 
The agenda for the new government, which will focus on 
economic development and security, should be released in 
early June. 
 
----------- 
JIBLA TRIAL 
----------- 
 
5.  (C)  The trial of Abed Abdulrazak Kamel, confessed 
murderer of three American citizens in Jibla on December 30, 
2002, concluded on May 7.  Kamel was sentenced to death on 
May 10.  Reports indicate that he intends to appeal.  The 
investigation phase of the trial was marked by excellent FBI 
support and U.S.-Yemen cooperation, including joint crime 
scene investigations.  FBI and ROYG officials conducted joint 
interviews with Kamel and all of the witnesses. 
 
-------- 
USS COLE 
-------- 
 
6.  (S/NF)  On April 11, ten prisoners, including four 
individuals implicated in the attack against the USS Cole, 
escaped from a high-security prison facility in Aden. 
Following the escape the local PSO Chief and the prison 
guards in Aden were questioned, roadblocks were set up, and 
photos of the escapees were carried by major newspapers. 
 
7.  (S/NF)  The re-arrest of the escapees is a matter of the 
highest priority.  President Saleh has assured the Ambassador 
that the ten will be re-captured.  A reward of up to 10 
million riyals (USD 54,645) has been offered for information 
leading to their arrest. 
 
8.  (S/NF)  Nevertheless, we need to urge continued Yemeni 
efforts or this campaign will flag.  Moreover, if they are 
recaptured, Saleh will almost certainly move to try Quso and 
Bedawi quickly.  He believes the delay in their trail, at 
U.S. behest, kept them alive and in less secure confinement. 
 
---------------- 
COUNTERTERRORISM 
---------------- 
 
9.  (S/NF)  The ROYG has been effective in disrupting 
terrorist activities inside Yemen, and taken steps to monitor 
extremist elements.  The ROYG is also responsive and 
effective in providing security for Embassy personnel.  It 
looks to the U.S. for training and financial assistance in 
accomplishing these tasks. 
 
10.  (S/NF)  The ROYG has conducted CT operations throughout 
Yemen to capture key al-Qaida operatives, and has cracked 
down on religious institutions implicated in breeding 
extremism, including Dar al-Hadith institute in Marib and 
Al-Iman University in Sanaa, resulting in the expulsion of 
foreign students.  Yemen is also monitoring its ports of 
entry for entrants from Iraq and Afghanistan.  ROYG has 
provided excellent support to Embassy security, and 
intelligence sharing has improved.  The Yemenis have also 
been supportive of our requests for action against terrorist 
financing sources in Yemen, but this is a field in which 
bilateral cooperation has been limited. 
 
---- 
IRAQ 
---- 
 
11.  (S/NF)  A member of the UN Security Council at the time 
of Iraq\'s 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Yemen allied itself with 
Iraq and voted against the UN resolution authorizing the use 
of force in Iraq during the Gulf War.  Yemen suffered 
greatly.  It was marginalized by its Arab neighbors and over 
a million Yemenis working in Gulf states were sent home. 
U.S. support for Yemen re-unification after the 1994 civil 
war provided an opening for improved relations, and the ROYG 
responded.  Yemen has since issued statements consistent with 
those of the Arab mainstream -- lamenting the suffering of 
the Iraqi people and opposing long-term U.S. occupation of 
Iraq -- but stopped short of denouncing the U.S.  Saleh\'s 
desire to protect relations with the U.S. and the lingering 
economic impact and isolation caused by the ROYG\'s foreign 
policy after the first Gulf War notably softened its 
opposition to Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
 
--------------- 
REGIONAL ISSUES 
--------------- 
 
12.  (C)  Yemen has actively attempted to repair damage to 
its relations with other Gulf states caused by its support 
for Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.  Yemen has re-established 
relations with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and the border 
dispute with Oman has been resolved.  Yemen has also settled 
the dispute with Eritrea over the Hanish Islands (although 
fishing disputes remain a bilateral irritant), and reached a 
border agreement with Saudi Arabia. 
 
--------------- 
U.S. ASSISTANCE 
--------------- 
 
13.  (S/NF)  The USG continues to help Yemen develop its CT 
capabilities.  U.S. Marines are currently training Yemeni 
security forces in Hodeidah, Sanaa, and Marib; support for 
Yemen\'s economic and political development continues; and 
USAID will re-open in June. 
 
----------- 
THE EMBASSY 
----------- 
 
14.  (C)  Sanaa is no longer on authorized departure, 
although minor dependents are not permitted at post.  Embassy 
security continues to benefit from ROYG cooperation augmented 
by structural improvements and personal protective measures.

SUBJECT: MIDDLE EAST TRADE INITIATIVE: YEMEN 
 
REF: A) SECSTATE 135263 B) TUNIS 1273 
 
Classified By: By DCM Alan G. Misenheimer for 1.5 (b.) and (d.) 
 
 1. (C) Summary: The ROYG will respond very positively to the 
Middle East Trade Initiative.  Yemen should accede to the 
World Trade Organization in five years and that process 
should help reinvigorate efforts to conclude a Bilateral 
Investment Treaty.  Sub regional FTAs could have wide 
benefits for Yemen; GCC membership for example is a top 
economic policy objective for Yemen  To qualify, Yemen will 
need technical assistance in WTO accession, privatization, 
regulatory enforcement and public relations. End Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) The Middle East Trade Initiative will be welcomed by 
the ROYG as an excellent avenue to develop business 
infrastructure and investment climate as a means to raise 
Yemen\'s standard of living and institutionalize economic 
reform. Several contacts in business and government sectors 
are seeking USG assistance in meeting WTO accession 
requirements and expansion of USG investment in Yemen. The 
Middle East Trade Initiative will also compliment USAID and 
MEPI assistance projects. 
 
---------------------------------- 
WTO Accession: Four to Five Years 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) In October 2002, Yemen submitted its Memorandum of 
Foreign Trade Regime to the World Trade Organization. 
Accession for Yemen is still four to five years away; Yemen 
is currently working hard to answer questions from the 
European Union, the United States and Australia.  The EU has 
pledged 7 million Euros to help Yemen accede, and the Dutch 
and World Bank plan on holding Yemen\'s Integrated Framework 
Conference in June. 
 
4. (C) We believe this initiative will also reinvigorate our 
efforts to conclude a bilateral Investment Treaty that we 
have been working on with the Ministry of Finance for the 
past year.  Progress has stalled as Yemen works on meeting 
the USG\'s core text requirements. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Subregional FTAs: Bridging the Gap 
between Yemen and other Gulf Countries 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Subregional FTAs would be beneficial for Yemen, 
especially if Yemen gains admission to the Gulf Cooperation 
Council. However, we note Embassy Tunis\' (Reftel B) concerns 
that intra-region politics may hamper the development of 
subregional free trade agreements.  Our  contacts have told 
us that Gulf countries compete with each other in similar 
economic sectors, such as oil and transshipment business, the 
two core aspects of the Yemeni trade economy.  To counteract 
such competition, we suggest that the Middle East Trade 
Initiative encourage the development of complimentary sectors 
in subregional countries. 
 
 
------------------------------------- 
Investment Climate: Micro-Enterprise 
and Export Industry Development 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C)  Post is already engaged in developing 
Micro-Enterprise projects and expanding business related 
education as part of our MEPI strategy. Expansion of export 
tied financing programs could help USG firms do business in 
Yemen. Yemenia Airlines representatives told Pol/econoff that 
they prefer to buy Boeing planes, however loan terms offered 
by Airbus were too good to pass up and therefore they placed 
their last order with Airbus. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Technical Assistance: WTO Accession, 
Privatization, and Public Relations 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
7. (C)  The following are possible areas for technical 
assistance: 
 
-- WTO Accession (A): Fortifying Yemen\'s copyright protection 
enforcement is one area that where USG technical assistance 
would aid Yemen.  Post does not assess intellectual copyright 
issues to be a major problem for Yemen, but developing a 
sound legal structure would greatly assist the accession 
process. Any help that we can provide to ensure that future 
IPR problems do not occur will encourage both trade and 
investment in Yemen. 
-- WTO Accession (B): Export industries should be made aware 
of the benefits of WTO status: a technical assistance program 
for exporters to meet quality control  and world trade 
organization standards for their goods would provide 
significant future dividends for domestic industry. 
 
-- Privatization: Assistance programs to encourage ROYG 
efforts to privatize the banking industry and national gas 
companies would help diversify the economy. 
-- Public Relations: Our contacts at the General Investment 
Authority and at the Ministry of International Cooperation 
are eager for Public Relations assistance that would promote 
Yemen\'s tourism, industry and trade. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Comment: Foreign Direct Investment a Key to Yemen\'s Future 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
8. (C) Comment: Foreign direct investment is an imperative 
for Yemen, which could eventually lose as much as one-third 
of its GDP as oil incomes decline in the next twenty years 
and its twenty plus million population is increasing at a 
rate of 3.7% a year. Free trade agreements are crucial to 
encouraging direct investment, and will be a valuable asset 
in our encouragement and assistance to help Yemen diversify 
its economy.

EAST REGIONAL JUSTICE FORUM 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 130099 
     B. SECSTATE 138602 
 
1.  Embassy Sanaa warmly endorses the proposed Middle East 
Regional Justice Forum.  While the ROYG has conducted a 
judicial reform project since 1997 with donor support from 
several countries, the results have been mixed and more work 
needs to be done.  Yemeni reform-minded judges and justice 
officials will welcome the opportunity to learn from their 
regional counterparts and international experts. 
 
2.  Based on readouts from judicial reform project supporters 
as well as Post\'s own contacts, Embassy Sanaa makes the 
following recommendations for possible participants in the 
September session in Manama: 
 
Dr. Adnan Omar al-Jafri 
Minister of Justice 
Newly-appointed to the cabinet (May 2003), professor of 
international law at Aden University, and Member of Parliament 
 
Judge Hamoud al-Hitar 
Member, Supreme Court 
Former Chairman of the Ulema (\"religious scholar\") Committee 
to conduct dialogue to reform fundamentalist terror-related 
detainees in 2002, considered one of the most moderate Yemeni 
clerics, prominent reform and human rights activist, close 
contact of Embassy, former IVP participant in the 1990s 
 
Reem Tariq Abdullah 
Lawyer, Aden 
Maritime and commercial law practice, reform-minded female 
lawyer, part of well-connected Yemeni family, former Humphrey 
fellow 
 
Judge Ahmed Sharafaddin 
Head, Sanaa Court of Appeals 
Traditional background but dedicated reform activist, 
well-known as scrupulously honest 
 
Judge Isaam al-Samawi 
Head, Aden Court of Appeals 
Young, fairly traditional judge, dedicated reformer 
 
3.  Post agrees with the broad themes outlined in reftels and 
offers the following suggestions relevant to the Yemeni 
context for consideration for the first meeting or subsequent 
regional gatherings: 
 
--  Strengthening the official judicial system to counteract 
reliance on traditional tribal justice:  In Yemen, the 
reliance on traditional tribal justice for resolution of 
disputes lessens confidence in and respect for the formal 
judicial system and keeps patronage and power in the hands of 
the tribal system.  This tendency undermines the rule of law 
and future democratic progress. 
 
--  Specialized training on commercial law:  The lack of wide 
expertise and understanding of commercial law among judges 
and lawyers creates problems for the business community, 
helps block foreign investment and creates barriers for 
increasing opportunities for U.S. business access and 
investment. 
 
--  Land tenure law:  Land disputes, particularly among rival 
tribes, continue to be a primary source of conflict in Yemen. 
 The lack of a clear and enforceable land tenure law 
contributes to the lack of effective avenues of peaceful 
resolution to land disputes.

Overview 
-------- 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Director Mueller arrived in Aden on June 2 as 
part of a larger regional tour.  The Director met with 
Ambassador Hull upon arrival to discuss agenda items for the 
Director\'s meeting with President Saleh.  Arriving in Yemen 
from Saudi Arabia, the Director was able to provide a 
valuable assessment of the current situation there.  He noted 
SAG\'s renewed activism in the fight against terror and their 
concern about the transfer of weapons and explosives from 
Yemen -- specifically from the weapons souk in Saada.  SAG 
also provided the Director with a list of items confiscated 
during illegal border crossings from Yemen that was 
mentioned, but not delivered, to President Saleh. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Ambassador highlighted intelligence indicating 
that a Saudi based group tried to recruit Abu Assem 
(Al-Makki), number two on the U.S. most wanted list for 
Yemen, to conduct terrorist acts in Saudi, which Abu Assem 
declined.  This is a warning and it should serve as a message 
to the Yemenis that these individuals must be apprehended.

President Saleh and Director Mueller

5.  (S/NF)  Starting a cordial meeting with President Ali 
Abdullah Saleh, Director Mueller conveyed President Bush\'s 
thanks for continuing ROYG efforts, particularly the recent 
arrest of IIS agents.  Mueller presented Stephen Gaudin to 
Saleh as the new Legal Attache-designate to Yemen, noting his 
years of experience in CT and his involvement in the East 
Africa Embassy bombings investigation.  Gaudin\'s selection is 
evidence of the FBI\'s long-term commitment.  The FBI will 
send additional personnel to support him, increasing the 
frequency and quality of its exchanges with the Political 
Security Organization (PSO) and the Ministry of Interior 
(MOI).  Mueller also introduced Executive Assistant Director 
for Counterterrorism Pat D\'Amuro.  Based out of Washington, 
D\'Amuro will be traveling throughout the region, including 
Yemen, to met with his counterparts in the months ahead. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  President Saleh welcomed Mueller and stressed his 
wish to enhance cooperation and coordination between the FBI, 
PSO, and MOI.  He also noted the importance of information 
sharing to continue the joint efforts to arrest those 
responsible for terrorism and identify \"sleeper\" Al-Qaeda 
cells in Yemen. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Return of Yemeni Detainees at GTMO 
---------------------------------- 
 
7.  (S/NF)  President Saleh cited the recent return of Saudi 
detainees from GTMO to SAG.  He said that, when the U.S. 
investigation of Yemenis at GTMO is complete, they should be 
handed over to Yemen so ROYG can conduct their own 
investigation and perhaps uncover more sleeper cells.  Saleh 
noted that, at the end of the day, the USG is not going to 
adopt tough measures against these individuals, but Yemen 
can.  These people must be a burden to the U.S. and ROYG is 
only trying to help. 
 
8.  (S/NF)  Mueller affirmed that USG authorities continue to 
look at the individuals at GTMO and will take appropriate 
steps when their investigations are complete.  ROYG has had 
an opportunity to meet with Yemenis at GTMO. 
 
9.  (S/NF)  Ambassador Hull added that there is a request for 
additional information from ROYG about some of the people in 
Yemeni custody. 
 
--------- 
Al-Moayed 
--------- 
 
10.  (S/NF)  President Saleh noted that the USG wants to 
prosecute Sheikh Mohammed Ali al-Moayed, but ROYG considers 
him a businessman, not a terrorist.  He suggested that the 
U.S. have the CIA and FBI investigate al-Moayed\'s activities, 
and, when the investigation is over, the U.S. should turn 
al-Moayed over to ROYG who will perform their own 
investigation. 
 
11.  (S/NF)  Director Mueller assured President Saleh that 
significant evidence of links to terrorist financing has been 
collected against al-Moayed and the case against him is quite 
strong. 
 
------------------------------- 
Re-education of Former Al-Qaeda 
------------------------------- 
 
12.  (S/NF)  Saleh outlined an ongoing ROYG initiative to 
re-educate former Al-Qaeda members.  The goal is to get them 
to repent and pledge their loyalty to ROYG and the country. 
This program is being run through moderate religious clerics, 
and Saleh believes it will provide ROYG with valuable 
information that will lead to the apprehension of more 
people. 
 
13.  (S/NF)  Mueller expressed concern that while these 
\"reformed\" individuals may promise not to commit terrorist 
attacks in Yemen, they may do so somewhere else.  President 
Saleh assured that these individuals are not permitted to 
leave Yemen.  Saleh noted that people with \"blood on their 
hands\" were not eligible for this program.  He added that 
last Ramadan (Nov/Dec 2002) the ROYG released 36 \"reformed\" 
individuals who were all doing well, proof that ROYG\'s 
re-education -- a mixture of religion, culture, and education 
-- is working. 
 
14.  (S/NF)  Saleh also said that the fact that nothing 
happened to Americans in Yemen during the war in Iraq was 
important evidence that ROYG\'s intervention, especially 
Saleh\'s personal intervention, was effective. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Precarious Regional Security Situation; Saudi Factor 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
15.  (S/NF)  Comparing the lack of central control in Iraq to 
the situation in Yemen after the 1994 civil war, Saleh said 
the bombings in Saudi Arabia were due in part to the flow of 
arms out of Iraq.  Director Mueller countered with the Saudi 
theory that the weapons used in these attacks actually came 
from Yemen.  While noting that it was a possibility, Saleh 
asked why the Saudis fail to control their own borders, 
including the Yemeni one. 
 
16.  (S/NF)  Mueller noted that the question of Saudis 
controlling their borders is a separate issue from the 
ability to buy weapons -- RPGs, explosives, etc. -- from 
Yemen.  Saleh mentioned ROYG\'s weapons-buyback program -- in 
the last few months ROYG says they have bought-back about 
70-80% of the weapons from the souks -- but again cited 
instability in Iraq as an immediate threat.  Saleh said that 
weapons dealers in Yemen have been trying to get permission 
to go to Iraq because the weapons there are cheaper.  Saleh 
also noted that members of the \"former Iraqi regime\"  were 
now selling weapons and munitions to Al-Qaeda, although he 
gave no sources. 
 
17.  (S/NF)  Saleh later agreed with the Director and the 
Saudis on proliferation from Saada (a northern city with a 
large weapons souk), confirming that ROYG knows the 
explosives used against the Cole and explosives used to 
target Saleh\'s residence were from Saada. 
 
--------------------------- 
CT Cooperation and Training 
--------------------------- 
 
18.  (S/NF)  Saleh said that while cooperation with CIA is 
good, cooperation with FBI is only fair; the ROYG has needs 
that should be discussed.  Mueller said that is why Steve 
Gaudin has been assigned to Yemen for the next two years as 
the first Legal Attache permanently assignment to Yemen. 
Mueller also noted that the FBI will conduct a two week 
course on crime scene investigation, evidence collection, 
etc. at the end of July for 24 Yemeni officials.  Equipment, 
which the officials will retain, will also be provided. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Sidebar:  President Saleh and Director Mueller One-on-One 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
19.  (S/NF)  At the conclusion of the delegation\'s meeting 
with the President, Saleh dismissed everyone except Director 
Mueller (and the President\'s interpreter) to have a private 
exchange.  During this sidebar, Saleh informed the Director 
that ROYG has information indicating that disaffected Iraqis 
are contacting elements of al-Qaeda to plot against U.S. 
interests.  No details or sourcing were provided. 
 
----------------- 
USS Cole Escapees 
----------------- 
 
20.  (C)  During a working lunch hosted by Minister of 
Interior Alimi and PSO Director Gamish, discussion continued 
on numerous issues including the April 11 escape of ten 
prisoners from a high-security prison facility in Aden.  Four 
of the ten were implicated in the October 2000 attack against 
the USS Cole. 
 
21.  (C)  PSO Security Director Gamish noted that they have 
proved difficult to find, but the investigation continues. 
ROYG distributed names and photos of the escapees, there is a 
reward, and ROYG is trying to find their hideouts.  President 
Saleh and Gamish both commented that intel indicates the 
escapees are still in Yemen. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Requests for Assistance and New CT Unit 
--------------------------------------- 
 
22.  (C)  Both Alimi and Gamish had a list of items their 
respective organizations require to improve their 
effectiveness, including computers, crime scene processing 
kits, and magnetometors.  Alimi also announced the 
establishment of a new CT Unit as called for by a recent Arab 
League ruling.  ROYG has given this unit a site, but the unit 
will require training and equipment before it is fully 
operational. 
 
23.  (C)  Director Mueller suggested that the U.S. has found 
small vetted units to be more effective than large divisions. 
 He added that those who receive specialized training must 
use it (i.e. no good to train people and then transfer them 
to a unit where they don\'t use that skill).  Alimi agreed and 
noted that personnel selection is key; however, ROYG needs 
larger units to ensure that qualified individuals are 
available when they are needed.  Gamish explained that 
turnover is high due in part to the importance of family.  If 
a family member is needed at home or elsewhere, they will go. 
 
 
24.  (C)  Ambassador Hull noted the importance of maintaining 
these skills with periodic exercises.

Press Coverage

25.  (C)  Press coverage of the Director\'s visit was limited, 
but positive, highlighting increased bilateral cooperation 
and USG appreciation for ROYG\'s efforts to combat terrorism.

FBI Director Mueller Visits Yemen; Meets President Saleh 
 
Robert Mueller, Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, met with Yemen\'s President Ali Abdullah Saleh 
in Aden Monday to discuss counter-terrorism and legal 
cooperation. 
 
Director Mueller\'s brief stopover in Aden came as part of his 
tour of the countries in the region to discuss the global 
struggle against terrorism.  Director Mueller briefed 
President Saleh on his talks with Saudi officials regarding 
the latest terrorist attacks in Riyadh that left more than 
thirty people dead.  He also underlined the existing close 
security cooperation between the United States and Yemen, and 
expressed the hope that the relationship would continue and 
develop further.  In this regard, he told President Saleh 
about the establishment of a LEGATT (Legal Attache) office at 
the U.S. mission in Sanaa. 
 
Also, attending the meeting in Aden were Yemeni Interior 
Minister Alimi and PSO Chief General Ghamesh as well as U.S. 
Ambassador to Yemen Edmund Hull.

1. (C) Summary: In a 6/2 meeting with Ambassador, FM Qirbi 
said he looked forward to visiting WDC, possibly with 
Interior Minister Alimi for policy discussions.  He welcomed 
Ambassador\'s readout of the FBI Director\'s meeting with Saleh 
earlier the same day.  Ambassador briefed Qirbi on the 
upcoming visit of U/S Bolton, underscoring the importance of 
positive Yemeni action on Article 98 and cooperation with the 
DPRK.  On terrorist financing, the Ambassador argued that 
Moayed should cooperate with U.S. investigators and urged the 
ROYG to designate a legitimate channel (vice the al-Aqsa 
Foundation) of Yemeni public support for Abu Mazen and the 
PA.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
FBI Director Mueller\'s Visit 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, called on FM Abubaker 
al-Qirbi at his home late in the evening of 6/2.  Qirbi was 
joined by Special Assistant Abdel Karim al-Iryani. 
Ambassador began by providing Qirbi with a detailed readout 
of FBI Director Mueller\'s meeting with President Saleh 
earlier the same day.  Qirbi expressed satisfaction with the 
discussion, noting that law enforcement cooperation with the 
United States would remain a major Yemeni interest for the 
foreseeable future.  Ambassador urged Qirbi to see that Yemen 
is well represented at the upcoming economic forum in Amman 
and the September judicial reform conference in Manama. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Policy Dialogue with the USG 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Qirbi said he had been reflecting on his recent 
discussion with Ambassador about travel to Washington.  In 
the aftermath of both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Yemen\'s 
April parliamentary elections, he said it was \"high time\" to 
initiate substantive talks with the USG about future 
developments in the region.  He said he wanted to make Yemen 
a positive element in U.S. strategic thinking about the 
region, including both Iraq and Israeli-Palestinian peace 
efforts.  Of particular importance, he said, was U.S. 
cooperation with Yemen and other countries in the region -- 
especially the GCC states -- to build regional security.  The 
time is past, argued Qirbi, when Yemen or any other country 
in this region, can think of its own security to the 
exclusion of broader security in the region.  Qirbi suggested 
that the effort should address Iran as well.  Referring to 
his talks with Iranian officials during the recent OIC 
meeting in Tehran, he reported that the \"Iranians think they 
are reaching out to you but you are ignoring them.\" 
 
4. (C) The FM commented that it could make sense for him to 
visit Washington together with Interior Minister Alimi, as 
this would provide for a broader base of bilateral 
discussions, including detailed talks on CT cooperation -- 
including U.S. assistance for the Yemeni Coast Guard, which 
falls under Alimi\'s authority. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
U/S Bolton\'s Visit: Article 98; DPRK 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Ambassador characterized the upcoming visit of U/S 
Bolton (now set for June 16-18) as a golden opportunity for 
the ROYG to reach a successful outcome on Article 98.  He 
briefly reviewed the positive examples set by Jordan, Egypt, 
Kuwait and Bahrain and noted that the Egyptian model -- based 
on a simple exchange of notes -- might readily be adapted for 
Yemen.  Iryani confirmed that Qirbi\'s office had received 
copies of the Egyptian notes from the Embassy earlier in the 
week and were actively studying them.  The Ambassador made a 
strong pitch for Qirbi to take personal ownership of the 
issue for Yemen and work it to conclusion in advance of U/S 
Bolton\'s visit.  Qirbi said he would coordinate with the 
Embassy over coming weeks toward this end. 
 
6. (C) Ambassador also advised the FM that U/S Bolton would 
raise Yemen\'s cooperation with North Korea, a very sensitive 
and important subject for the USG.  Recalling previous 
discussions of the subject, Ambassador urged Qirbi to 
postpone any actions or decisions on further interaction with 
the DPRK -- including planned port improvements -- before 
discussing the issue with U/S Bolton.  He reiterated the 
recommendation that Yemen seek an acceptable alternative, 
perhaps engineering/construction firms from Eastern Europe. 
Qirbi welcomed the advice and said he looked forward to 
successful discussions with U/S Bolton. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Economic Reform Meeting in Amman 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7. (C) Ambassador urged Qirbi to ensure that the ROYG is well 
represented at the upcoming WEF meeting in Amman.  The FM 
acknowledged the importance of the meeting and said Yemen 
would take part. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Judicial Reform Meeting in Manama 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) In response to urging that Yemen also attend the 
September Bahrain meeting on judicial reform, Qirbi expressed 
regret at the new Justice Minister\'s decision not to attend a 
judicial reform conference in South Korea.  By September he 
will be well settled in, so Yemen should be well represented 
in Manama.  Qirbi acknowledged that judicial reform, 
especially in the areas of commercial contracts and land 
tenure, was desperately needed in Yemen. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Terrorist Financing/Sheikh Moayed 
------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Qirbi said he was pleased the Moayed case had come up 
in the FBI Director\'s discussions in Aden.  He said the ROYG 
remained deeply concerned over the domestic implications of 
the case and was attempting to mitigate the impact of a 
possible German decision to extradite Moayed to the United 
States.  Many people are convinced he is innocent, said 
Qirbi.  The Ambassador noted Moayed\'s popularity in Sanaa, 
but urged Qirbi to draw attention to the integrity of both 
the German and U.S. legal systems.  Moayed will receive due 
process, and should cooperate with U.S. investigators in 
uncovering the network of terrorist financing in the United 
States, said the Ambassador. 
 
10. (C) The Ambassador also noted the financing issue as an 
appropriate way for states of the region, including Yemen, to 
show support for President Bush\'s high profile effort to 
foster Israeli-Palestinian peace.  Since the USG had recently 
designated the al-Aqsa Foundation, both in Yemen and 
elsewhere, as a terrorist financing entity, the ROYG should 
now seek not only to shut off any remaining channels of 
monetary support for Palestinian extremist groups but also to 
designate and support a legitimate channel for Yemenis to 
support Abu Mazen and the Palestinian Authority as it embarks 
on a difficult peacemaking effort.  Qirbi said the ROYG would 
follow up accordingly.

1.  (C)  Summary and Comment:  There are conflicting reports 
on the facts behind an explosion in Aden on June 7 that 
killed three Yemeni men.  However, the most credible account 
of the incident from DAO staff visiting in Aden, with 
corroborating facts from other sources, point to an 
accidental explosion.  Differing accounts of incidents like 
this one are not unusual in Yemen because the lines of 
responsibility (and therefore the most accurate description 
of facts) among ROYG elements are not always clear.  Post 
will continue to investigate the incident to ensure no 
relation to terrorism.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
2.  (C)  Members of the DAO who were in Aden heard the 
explosion at around 12:30am on June 7 and followed up with 
the Political Security Organization (PSO) and other local 
contacts to ascertain the circumstances.  They were told that 
three scrap-metal scalvagers recovered a unconfirmed type of 
missile, possibly a small surface-to-air missile, and were 
attempting to remove the metal when the missile detonated. 
The three, from the same family, were killed instantly.  The 
incident reportedly happened in a scrap metal yard owned by 
the family in the Little Aden area. 
 
3.  (C)  The area around Aden contains numerous known 
minefields that are undergoing clearance through the U.S. and 
UNDP-supported ROYG National Mine Action Committee, but there 
are still areas that contain unexploded ordinance (UXO) 
outside these well-marked areas.  DAO members have observed 
old missile scraps lying along the route from Aden to Little 
Aden. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Local independent newspaper al-Ayyam printed the 
names of the three dead.  ORCA conducted a name-check as a 
precaution and came up empty. 
 
5.  (C)  In another version, Ministry of Interior (MOI) 
contacts told RSO that three men found an old Rocket 
Propelled Granade (RPG) launcher, took it home and tried to 
take it apart when it blew.  Other accounts of the facts from 
various sources, including United Nations officials and the 
international and Yemeni press, differ in the details.  Some 
accounts mention a missile and some mention an RPG, while 
some accounts mention different locations in Aden.

NEA/PPD FOR DMACINNES, WMOONEY, JGAFFNEY 
 
 
SUMMARY: 1. Most Yemeni official and opposition 
newspapers reported and commented on the road map and the 
Sharm al-Sheikh and Aqaba meetings. The two official 
papers considered the road map to be an achievement for 
peace if it ensures the legitimate rights of 
Palestinians. However, most other papers described the 
road map as a justification to eradicate the Palestinian 
resistance by Palestinians themselves.  Overall, Yemeni 
media have adopted a skeptical attitude toward recent 
Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts and given the issue far 
less play than Iraq received in the run up to OIF. END 
SUMMARY 
 
 
2. \"September 26\" the official weekly of the Yemeni Armed 
Forces, noted on June 5 that Yemen welcomed the road map 
in which the Palestinian side declared its acceptance. 
The paper said that Yemen reiterated its support for the 
establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as 
its capital. \"Foreign Minister Dr. al-Qirbi called on the 
U.S. and the Quartet to commit themselves to the 
implementation of the road map without postponement or 
amendment. The paper noted that Al-Qirbi underlined 
Yemen\'s appreciation of the importance that President 
Bush personally committed himself to achieve a 
comprehensive and just peace and to work for the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state. 
 
3. The official daily \"Al-Thawra in its June 4 editorial 
considered that it was not sufficient for America to 
sponsor peace or just dedicate itself to creating 
confidence between disputing parties. The paper went on 
to say:  \"Washington should exert pressure on Israel to 
give up its haughty settlement policy and respond to the 
essential questions that could lead to security, peace, 
and stability\" 
 
4. The anti-American (putatively independent) weekly \"al- 
Shumu\'\" reported that Speaker of Parliament Sheikh al- 
Ahmar criticized the \"road map\" saying that it is not for 
the interest of the Palestinian people or Arab and Muslim 
nations. \"Al-Ahmar considered that the U.S. call for Arab 
leaders and Muslim nations to cooperate with the U.S. 
Administration in counter-terrorism is a shameful lie and 
an excuse for occupying Arab nations.\" 
 
5. \"Al-Shura\" the weekly newspaper of the minor 
opposition Union of Popular Forces party, in an opinion 
piece on June 8 wrote: \"The U.S. Administration in the 
Sharm al-Sheikh summit was able to receive Arab 
guarantees to put mechanisms in place and perhaps to 
administer a secret preventive war against what 
Washington describes as terrorism. Washington means by 
terrorism Hamas, Jihad, and the Palestinian al-Aqsa 
brigades as well as Hizbullah in South Lebanon.\" 
 
6.\"17 July\" the pro-GPC (ruling party) weekly, 
editorialized on June 8: \"The Central Authority of al- 
Quds Institution warned against making any compromises 
regarding the new U.S. initiative, the road map. It is 
one more step in a new series of U.S.-Zionist conspiracy 
against the Palestinian people to eliminate the 
Palestinian resistance and achieve Israeli security on 
the account of a bloody conflict between the resistance 
and the Palestinian authority.\" 
 
7. \"Wahj al-Haqiqa\" another pro-GPC weekly, wrote in an 
analytical piece on June 7 that Bush\'s plan at the end 
does not seek to offer anything good to Palestinians, but 
to save Israelis from the hands of suicide bombers and 
abort that important weapon that caused heavy losses to 
Israel. \"There are dozens of former plans that were not 
implemented such as Clinton, Mitchell, and Tenet plans as 
well as numerous UN resolutions. The Oslo convention 
itself was not implemented and was frozen or was left 
behind.\" 
 
8. \"Al-Ummah, the weekly newspaper of the minor Union 
Islamist opposition al-Haq party, in an op-ed article 
June 5  wrote: \"Counter-terrorism is an image for the 
U.S. in occupied Palestine and in the Arab region. This

opposition Islah party, in an opinion article June 5 
wrote: \"The U.S. choice of time in Madrid in the nineteen- 
nineties and Sharm al-Sheikh and Aqaba now proves that 
the U.S. Administration does not want to listen to 
conditions or talk about historical rights. Rather, it 
just wants to listen to commitments and pledges that it 
considers appropriate for the region. This explains why 
Syria and Lebanon were excluded from attending the Sharm

invited instead.\"

1. (U) On 6/7, Acting Pol/Econ Chief delivered Ref A demarche 
concerning the International Code of Conduct against 
Ballistic Missile Proliferation (ICOC) to Marwan Noman, 
Office Director to Yemen\'s Foreign Minister. 
 
 2.  (C) Noman was familiar with the issue: the diplomatic 
note that would have added Yemen to the list of ICOC 
signatories had been on his desk in April, ready to pass to 
Foreign Minister Abu-Baker al-Qirbi for signature.  According 
to Noman, the Ministry of Defense objected at the last 
minute, claiming the Code would limit their military options. 
 That objection had trumped, at least for the time being, the 
strong ICOC endorsement given by Amat al-Alim al-Soswah, 
recently named as Minister of Human Rights in the new Yemeni 
cabinet. 
 
 3. (C) Pol/Econ chief reviewed ref B talking points, 
stressing that the ICOC would not affect any legitimate 
defense or space exploration requirements.  Noman promised to 
raise the matter again and said he was optimistic that the 
MOD objections would be overcome and the Foreign Minister 
would sign the ICOC. 
 
4. (c) Comment: The view presented to us --  that FM Qirbi 
and the MFA are ready to proceed, while the MOD is hesitant 
-- is credible.  Our MFA contacts say MOD reservations are 
not deeply held and may soon give way.  Nevertheless, such 
inter-ministerial discord often proves difficult for the ROYG 
to resolve.  Post will continue to press on both the MFA and 
the MOD.

b,d) 
 
1.  (U)   This is an action request -- see paragraph 7. 
 
2.  (U)  Dr. Moustafa Bahran, Chairman of the Yemeni National 
Atomic Energy Commission (NATEC), requests the Department\'s 
assistance in coordinating an important visit to the U.S. to 
discuss the physical security of radiological materials 
(PSRM).  In 2002, NATEC entered discussions with many member 
states of the IAEA on a proposed PSRM resolution to prevent 
the use of radioactive materials for terror.  The Republic of 
Yemen, in cooperation with the United States and the European 
Union, co-drafted and co-sponsored the final resolution -- 
IAEA GC/46/Res/13. 
 
3.  (U)  NATEC believes GC/46/Res/13 falls short of their 
expectations, and the international community can do more. 
Consequently, NATEC is campaigning to strengthen the existing 
PSRM resolutions during the 47th IAEA General Conference in 
September 2003.  NATEC intends to submit at text on PSRM, 
stressing the difficulties caused by the historical 
entanglement of PSRM and the Physical Protection of Nuclear 
Materials (PPNM).  According to Bahran, if progress is to be 
made, PSRM must be a stand alone issue. 
 
4.  (U)  Chairman Bahran held discussions with his French 
counterparts in May and plans to visit England this summer on 
his way back from the U.S.  NATEC intends to use the support 
garnered from these consultations to move the General 
Conference towards consensus, 
securing the passage of their resolution. 
 
5.  (U)  For his consultations in the U.S., Bahran requests 
meetings with: 
 
 
a)  Department of State 
 
-- Bureau of Nonproliferation (specifically, Ronald Burrows 
in NP/SC) 
 
 
b)  Department of Energy 
 
-- Courtesy call with the Secretary of Energy 
 
-- Meeting with the Office of International Cooperation to 
discuss the peaceful use of atomic energy 
 
-- Meeting with NNSA\'s Office of International Protection and 
Cooperation to discuss strengthening international efforts on 
PSRM 
 
 
c)  Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 
 
-- Courtesy call with the Chairman of NRC 
 
-- Meeting with the Office of International Cooperation to 
discuss radiation protection 
 
 
6.  (S)  Dr. Bahran will be meeting with the Department of 
State\'s Undersecretary for Arms Control and Nonproliferation. 
 U/S Bolton visits Yemen June 16-17.  Dr. Bahran is scheduled 
to join the U/S for breakfast and will discuss the activities 
and objectives outlined above, as well as the importance of a 
regional initiative. 
 
7.  (C)  Action requested:  Post appreciates NP/MNA\'s 
assistance and requests their continued coordination and 
scheduling of meetings for Dr. Bahran.  Dr. Bahran would like 
to travel as soon as possible and has a multiple entry visa. 
However, his assistant does not.  Consequently, the earliest 
his delegation will be ready to depart is early July.  POC

1. Post requests inclusion in the Arabic Book Translation 
Program. 
 
--------------------- 
Answers to Questions 
--------------------- 
 
2.  PAO, John Balian, recently spoke with officials from the 
Ministry of Education regarding the proposed project. 
 
3.  MOE officials were enthusiastic about the program and 
promised cooperation with Amembassy Sanaa in planning and 
implementation of the project. 
 
4.  Post will work with appropriate host government officials 
so that schools are ready to participate in the initial pilot 
project to be launched in Fall 2003. 
 
5.  Host country is receptive to participating in both the 
primary school and (future) upper grade programs. 
 
6.  Post believes that the classroom library set-up will be 
effective. 
 
7.  Although the MOE does not have sufficient funds to offer 
financial buy-in to the project, MOE is fully prepared to 
work with Amembassy Sanaa in school selection and other forms 
of cooperation necessary to make the project successful. 
 
8.  Post does not currently know the number of schools that 
could be impacted by the initial roll-out of the program but 
due to the desperate need of additional educational/reading 
materials in the country\'s school system, the future impact 
of the program could be impressive. 
 
9.  There is no local facility that can be used for printing 
of the books. 
 
10. Post would work with media outlets in Yemen, in 
cooperation with the ROYG to insure wide-spread media 
coverage in all of the areas where the program is 
implemented. 
 
11. The USG\'s profile in the roll-out of the program should 
be high once books are actually donated to schools and 
classroom libraries are established. 
 
------------------ 
Education in Yemen 
------------------ 
 
12. Basic education and literacy is a fundamental component 
of Post\'s MEPI strategy as there are many areas of education 
that need to be addressed in Yemen. Only half of all Yemeni 
children aged 6 to 11 enroll in schools, the literacy rate, 
especially in the rural areas, is as high as 91 percent for 
married women, and teachers often have minimum 
qualifications.  The 2000/1 Education Survey estimated that 
only 60 percent of teachers have just basic education, or at 
most, one to two years of secondary school. 
 
13. Education has not historically been considered essential 
among many Yemenis. However, the Yemeni Government is working 
to improve the educational system.  The ROYG Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper states that education is a key 
factor in creating sustainable economic and social 
development.  The education strategy in Yemen focuses on 
improving the quality of education, improving the management 
of the educational system, giving priority to basic education 
and focusing on girls\' education. 
 
14. The Arabic Book Translation Program will work to help the 
ROYG meet these objectives and will help meet some of the 
education needs of the country, especially in rural areas 
where illiteracy is most prevalent.

TAGS: PARM, PREL, OTRA, OVIP, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM 
SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR UNDER SECRETARY BOLTON\'S VISIT TO 
YEMEN 
 
 
Classified By: CHARGE ALAN G. MISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) You are the most senior State Department official to 
visit Yemen since Secretary Baker came in late 1990.  The 
ROYG thus recognizes your visit as an important opportunity 
to continue building the positive bilateral relations that 
have evolved in the aftermath of the Cole and 9/11 attacks, 
so your brief stay in Yemen should be productive.  Our 
post-9/11 CT cooperation with Yemen has achieved important 
successes, and President Saleh has shown resolve; but your 
visit forces the Yemenis to focus on areas of the 
relationship that are difficult for them, particularly SCUDs 
and cooperation with North Korea.  Your discussions with 
Defense Minister Aliwa and, especially, FM Qirbi will advance 
the U.S. agenda on those issues, and on Article 98.  This 
cable follows up your discussion with AMB Hull in Washington 
early this month. 
 
--------------------- 
Yemen and North Korea 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Yemenis have no ideological affinity for the DPRK, 
but like to buy cheap.  Of course the question of why a 
country like Yemen -- among the world\'s 25 poorest, with 
annual per capita income around $400 -- would buy a useless 
weapons system like the SCUD (or Russian MIGs for that 
matter) at any price is often posed by international donors, 
and Yemen has no convincing answer.  The 11/02 interdiction 
of the So San with its cargo of SCUD-Bs underscored such 
questions and prompted several donors (particularly the 
Japanese) to suspend aid until the ROYG offered assurance 
that those SCUDs would be the last. 
 
3. (C) Those assurances, conveyed in similar terms to both 
Japan and the USG, fall short of the simple and categoric 
language we sought to elicit.  The most recent Yemeni 
statement on this -- a 3/5/03 letter from Aliwa -- stated 
that existing contracts with the DPRK for spares/ 
maintenance, as well as construction of a naval port near 
Hodeidah, would be implemented.  We have seen no recent 
indication of movement on either, and have strongly urged the 
Yemenis to refrain from both. 
 
4. (C) The ROYG has invited the USG to propose an affordable 
alternative to the DPRK.  We have urged the Rumanians (the 
best established of the East Europeans in Yemen) to use their 
extensive port-building experience to undercut the DPRK. 
They are interested, but have bad memories of unpaid bills 
for construction here in the early 90\'s.  AMB Hull has 
discussed with you the possibility of dangling expected 
supplemental FMF as assistance toward responsible military 
procurement. 
 
---------- 
Article 98 
---------- 
 
5. (C) U.S. military assistance is vital for Yemen, so our 
leverage on the ICC/Article 98 issue is considerable.  The 
fact that other Arab states have taken the plunge on Article 
98 is also an important consideration for the Yemenis, who 
are hesitant to step ahead of their Gulf neighbors on any 
potentially sensitive issue.  The ROYG has signed, but not 
ratified, the Rome Statute; and we have ensured that the 
Yemeni leadership is aware that ratification without an 
Article 98 agreement in place would precipitate a cut-off of 
FMF. 
 
6. (C) The ROYG put off consideration of an Article 98 
agreement for many months in the run-up to the April 27 
parliamentary elections.  Since then we have worked the issue 
hard with the MFA, which has been responsive.  FM Qirbi is 
interested in pursuing an exchange of diplomatic notes based 
on the Egyptian precedent, and we have encouraged this. 
President Saleh\'s approval is required, and we believe Qirbi 
is hoping for presidential authorization to proceed in time 
for your visit. 
 
--------------------- 
Humanitarian Demining 
--------------------- 
 
7. (C) You will pay a brief visit to Yemen,s National Mine 
Action Committee.  With U.S. guidance, the ROYG began a 
humanitarian demining program in 1998.  Sixty percent of all 
marked areas have been cleared of mines and UXO, including 10 
out of 14 \"high impact\" areas.  Despite Yemen\'s poverty, the 
program is widely recognized as one of the best managed and 
most successful in the world. 
 
8. (C) There is an issue here.  The USG has been the largest 
contributor to the program, but FY03 NADR funds -- $750,000 
-- have not yet been released as the June 30 deadline looms. 
The program provides humanitarian benefit to the rural poor, 
and has helped anchor bilateral CT cooperation. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Security of Radioactive Materials 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Yemen\'s National Atomic Energy Commission -- led by 
U.S.-educated Moustafa Bahran -- is surprisingly active and 
supportive of U.S. positions in international fora.  Bahran\'s 
main initiative is a proposal to enhance the physical 
security of radiological materials.  The Republic of Yemen, 
in cooperation with the United States and the EU, co-drafted 
and co-sponsored the final resolution in the 2002 IAEA 
conference on preventing the use of radioactive materials for 
terror.  Bahran looks forward to meeting you. 
 
------------------------------ 
10. (C) Foreign Minister Qirbi 
------------------------------ 
 
In his second term as Foreign Minister, Dr. Abu Bakr al-Qirbi 
(a physician by background) has worked to advance Yemen\'s 
return to a responsible foreign policy, although he is not 
inclined to take bold steps that might alienate Arab or 
Muslim opinion.  Both he and Saleh were cautious in public 
expressions of opposition to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 
Qirbi privately told us many times he welcomed the removal of 
Saddam Hussein.  Qirbi has strongly endorsed the 
Israeli-Palestinian Road Map and publicly praised President 
Bush for launching the initiative.  He is UK-educated and 
speaks fluent English. 
 
------------------------------ 
11. (C) Defense Minister Aliwa 
------------------------------ 
 
Major General Abdullah Ali Aliwa has served both as a soldier 
and as the civilian governor of a poor province.  He is 
anxious to strengthen military cooperation with the U.S.  He 
does not take the lead on international policy issues, 
however, and will defer to the Minister of Foreign Affairs on 
Article 98 and, to a lesser degree, cooperation with North 
Korea.  He may raise the ROYG\'s program to buy back MANPADS 
as in indicator of Yemen\'s CT commitment.  He speaks limited 
English and will prefer to converse in Arabic.

1.  (C)  AP reported on 6/13 that Yemeni police defused a 
time bomb outside the Hadda Hotel late on Thursday, June 12. 
The hotel is located about 150 yards from a residential 
compound housing many foreigners, including Embassy staff. 
Foreign Minister Qirbi, the Ministry of Interior (MOI), and 
the Political Security Organization (PSO) have all assured 
the Embassy that this report is untrue. 
 
2.  (C)  The 6/13 AP article by Ahmed Al-Haj reported that 
\"security guards found the bomb placed against the outside 
wall of the four-star Hadda Hotel shortly before midnight

 1. (U) This is an Action Request, please see para 8. 
 
2. (S) Summary: The Head of the Americas desk at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs requests more information regarding the 
link between the Yemen Al-Aqsa Foundation and Hamas. ROYG 
officials are seeking an alternative charity for donations to 
the Palestinian people, possibly the Arab League\'s al-Quds 
foundation. In a follow up meeting, Pol/Econoff confirmed 
that the Ambassador had already provided information on this 
connection at the highest levels sufficient to justify 
freezing the assets of the Al-Aqsa Foundation. End Summary. 
 
3. (S) In a follow-up meeting on June 9 regarding the USG\'s 
request that the ROYG freeze the assets of the local branch 
of the al-Aqsa Foundation, (Reftel A) Head of the America\'s 
desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Abdul Salam al-Awadhi 
requested more information relating to al-Aqsa Foundation\'s 
support for Hamas.   He stated that evidence in the USG 
nonpaper (Ref B) linking Sheikh al-Muayed, the head of 
al-Aqsa foundation, to al-Qaeda was clear.  However, 
al-Awadhi claimed that the evidence concerning the al-Aqsa 
foundation itself and its connections to Hamas, were not 
explicit enough for the MFA to make a clear decision. 
4. (S) Al-Awadhi said that his office is preparing a report 
for Foreign Minister Qirbi recommending whether or not to 
freeze al-Aqsa Foundation assets. At the same time, ROYG 
officials are also seeking alternative conduits for the 
public to donate money on behalf of the Palestinians (Ref A). 
 Al-Awadhi raised the possibility of promoting the Arab 
League backed al-Quds Fund as a possible mechanism for 
charitable donations. 
 
5. (S) Pol/Econoff pointed out that halting the funding for 
an organization that supports Hamas was particularly 
important in light of Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Mazen\'s 
statements against terror at the Aqaba meetings.  Al-Awadhi 
responded that the ROYG understood this issue, and that they 
did not want to be \"more royal than the King\"  on the matter 
of positive support for the Palestinians. 
 
6. (S) On June 11, in a subsequent meeting, Pol/Econoff 
confirmed to al-Awadhi that the Ministry had already been 
given all relevant information and that the Embassy believed 
the information was sufficient to justify freezing the assets 
of the Yemen al-Aqsa foundation.  She also explained that the 
Ambassador had given Minister Qirbi copies of the al-Muayed 
indictment, which included information on al-Aqsa\'s 
activities in Yemen.  Al-Awadhi politely disagreed that the 
ROYG had enough information to make such a decision. 
However, he  said that all available information would be 
discussed by an interagency team from the Ministries of 
Interior, Finance and Foreign Affairs, who would decide on 
this matter. 
 
7. (S) Comment: Al-Awadhi may not have been fully briefed on 
the Ambassador\'s conversations with Foreign Minister Qirbi 
regarding Sheikh al-Muayed and al-Aqsa. Either way, al-Awadhi 
is seeking as much information as possible to support a 
difficult decision for the ROYG. However, his search for more 
facts is postponing a decision on al-Aqsa\'s assets, and this 
may be the desired effect. End Comment. 
 
8. (S) Action Request: Please advise Post on the Arab 
League\'s al-Quds Fund, in particular  whether there are 
objections to its possible designation by the ROYG as an 
acceptable conduit for donations from Yemeni citizens to the 
Palestinians.

REPRESENTATIVE 
 
 
Classified By:  Classified by CDA Alan Misenheimer for reasons 1.5 b. a 
nd d. 
 
1. (C) Summary: Minister of Agriculture Hasan Omar Sowaid 
told Charge and USAID Representative that he welcomes USG 
assistance in the agriculture sector. Sowaid is the youngest 
Minister of the newly appointed Cabinet at 34, and new to the 
Sanaa political scene. However, with agriculture employing 
54% of Yemeni workers, and accounting for 15.3% of GDP, 
Minister Sowaid has the potential to positively impact the 
lives of many Yemeni citizens. End Summary. 
 
2. (U)  Charge called on newly-appointed Minister of 
Agriculture Hasan Omar Sowaid on June 15 to congratulate him 
on his appointment and introduce Douglas Heisler as the new 
USAID representative to Yemen.  Sowaid welcomed Charge and 
Heisler and briefly described the useful impact of previous 
USAID cooperation in Yemen.   Sowaid added that there was 
still more work to be done in the field of agriculture, and 
that donor assistance in the agricultural field has recently 
been declining. Any US assistance, he said, will be warmly 
received. 
 
3. (U) Heisler reviewed potential areas for cooperation, 
including production, processing and marketing of 
agricultural products.  Sowaid was receptive to USAID\'s offer 
of consultants, especially concerning his plans to reorganize 
the entire Ministry. 
 
4. (U) Charge also handed Sowaid an invitation from the 
Secretary of Agriculture to USDA\'s upcoming Conference and 
 
SIPDIS 
Expo on Technology in Sacramento.  Note: Due to the recent 
change of government, and change of Ministers, Sowaid is 
awaiting permission to attend from the Prime Minister. End 
Note. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Bio Note: Farmer One Day, Minister of Agriculture the Next 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
5. (C) Minister Sowaid is a political neophyte and, at 34, he 
is the youngest Minister of the new Cabinet.  Long-time 
Embassy contact and prominent businessman Abdul Wahab Thabet 
told Pol/Econoff that Sowaid had approached his brother, 
Abdul Jalil Thabet, the GPC representative for the Hodeida 
Governorate, asking for a job in a local branch office of the 
Ministry of Agriculture.  Thabet stressed that this man had 
little ambition beyond farming, and had not sought anything 
higher than a simple office job.  However, after Sowaid had 
won his constituency and apparently through his good 
connections to the Thabets, Sowaid was appointed Minister. 
Thabet also implied that the Minister\'s appointment was also 
related to the geographical proportionment and that Sowaid\'s 
strong ties to Hodeida figured prominently in his being 
chosen as a Minister. 
 
6. (C) In his conversation with Charge, Sowaid stressed his 
background as a farmer, saying he had personally recived 
assistance from both the United States and Russia for his 
farm.  Sowaid was educated in Cairo, receiving his BA in 
Agricultural Sciences. He has not traveled to the United 
States. 
------------------------------------- 
Comment: Hope for Ministry of Agriculture 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C)  The Ministry of Agriculture was one of the most 
notoriously mismanaged Ministries in the former government. 
Sowaid seems open to new ideas and warmly accepted all offers 
of advice.  While still young, he has the backing of one of 
the most progressive commercial families in Yemen and will 
bring welcome new blood for agriculture in Yemen.

Classified By: Charge D\'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for Reason 1.5 (b, 
d) 
 
1.  (U)  This is an action request - see paragraph 13. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Begin summary:  Yemen has launched an aggressive 
11th hour campaign for the return of Sheikh Mohamed Ali 
al-Moayed, now awaiting an extradition ruling in Germany on 
charges of support for terrorist organizations.  After 
raising the case with FBI Mueller on June 2, the ROYG 
dispatched two high level envoys to Germany on 6/17.  On 
6/18, FM Qirbi called in the Charge to appeal for Moayed\'s 
return to Yemen for prosecution in lieu of extradition to the 
US, citing his age, poor health, political naivet, high 
national standing as a cleric and philanthropist, and the 
growing \'street\' conviction that he has been judicially 
kidnapped by the FBI.  Also on 6/18, a close advisor to ROYG 
President Saleh contacted the Charge to convey Saleh\'s 
personal request for Moayed\'s return to Yemen and a proposal 
for a joint U.S./Yemeni investigation in Sanaa.   Saleh is 
traveling to Germany later this week and has requested a 
response before he departs Yemen.  End summary. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  With the German ruling on Sheikh Mohammed Ali 
al-Moayed\'s extradition to the US imminent, the ROYG has 
mounted an intense effort to bring Moayed back to Yemen. 
That effort is spurred by pressure from Islah, the 
conservative Muslim opposition party, as well as a growing 
media campaign and high-level appeals to President Saleh in 
support of the Sheikh.  President Saleh, who personally 
authorized funds for Moayed\'s defense team in Germany, raised 
the case with visiting FBI Director Mueller on June 2, saying 
that ROYG considers Moayed a businessman, not a terrorist 
(ref A).  Saleh suggested that the U.S. have the CIA and FBI 
investigate Moayed\'s activities, and, when the investigation 
is over, the U.S. should turn Moayed over to ROYG to perform 
its own investigation.  Director Mueller assured President 
Saleh that significant evidence of links to terrorist 
financing have been collected against Moayed and the case 
against him is quite strong. 
 
4.  (U)  With the extradition decision expected later this 
month, President Saleh ordered Isma\'il Ahmad al-Wazir and 
Abdallah Ahmad Ghanim, members of his Shura (Consultative) 
Council, to travel to Germany on 6/17 to follow the case of 
Moayed and his assistant, Mohammed Zayad.  According to Saba, 
the official news agency, the two envoys will join Moayed\'s 
defense team and offer legal evidence to prove the 
defendant\'s \"incorruptibility.\" 
 
5.  (C)  During a 6/18 meeting held at FM Qirbi\'s behest, the 
Charge was informed of ROYG\'s concern over a letter from 
Moayed\'s lawyers in Germany complaining about their inability 
to review U.S. provided evidence against their clients. 
Qirbi said he discussed this concern with the German 
Ambassador on June 17 and delivered a diplomatic note (text 
paragraph 15).  The Foreign Minister noted ROYG is focusing 
on the political as well as legal aspects of this case.  Many 
Yemenis view Moayed as a religious, charitable leader.  Qirbi 
voiced ROYG fears Moayed\'s extradition to the U.S. will 
derail ROYG efforts to enlist popular support for the war 
against terror, and could destabilize the country. 
 
6.  (C)  Qirbi suggested that Yemen, Germany, and the U.S. 
could get together to work this out, in lieu of proceeding 
with the extradition.  He believes that, even if Moayed had 
contact with terrorist organizations, he probably didn\'t know 
what he was doing.  Referring to the U.S. \"entrapment\" of 
Moayed, Qirbi commented dryly that he is clearly easily duped 
and misled. 
 
7.  (C)  In response, the Charge assured Qirbi that he would 
relay the ROYG\'s concerns to Washington.  He noted that this 
is not a personal attack against Moayed, as it has been 
portrayed in the local press, but part of a worldwide 
initiative to disrupt terrorist funding.  Asked if the ROYG 
had informed Moayed\'s supporters of the various assurances on 
Moayed requested by Germany and provided by the USG, Qirbi 
replied in the affirmative.  These assurances were an 
important positive element, he said, but not enough. 
 
8.  (C)  With the extradition ruling expected soon, the 
Charge highlighted the importance of sharing information in 
the coming days.  Moayed\'s defense team should urge him to 
begin cooperating fully with U.S. investigators, especially 
by providing full details of fund-raising in the U.S.  Qirbi 
agreed, but added that, if information, including information 
on terrorism, was the major goal, it would be better for 
Moayed to be interrogated in Germany by U.S. and Yemeni 
security.  He would be more cooperative in those 
circumstances than if he were taken to the U.S. 
 
9.  (C)  Qirbi further noted that the defense team was 
concerned about Moayed\'s deteriorating health, which has also 
been cited in recent press reports.  He asked that we confirm 
or deny this information. 
 
10.  (C)  At 10:00pm on 6/18 Mohamed Sudam, personal advisor 
and translator to President Saleh called the Charge to convey 
\"an urgent personal message from President Saleh to the U.S. 
Administration\".  The message (text para 14) is urgent -- 
Saleh travels to Germany on Friday June 20 and Moayed is 
among his top concerns. 
 
11.  (C)  Comment:  These unusual late night demarches 
immediately follow Qirbi\'s strong pitch to Charge earlier in 
the day.  The structure and phrasing of this evening\'s 
message (para 14), no less than the fact that it was 
delivered by the President\'s go-to adviser for dealings with 
the Americans, indicates that it really is a personal message 
from Saleh. 
 
12.  (C)  Comment continued:  The suggestion that the U.S. 
interrogate al-Moayed in Germany, or, even better, return him 
to Yemen for prosecution, reflects Saleh\'s genuine worry over 
domestic consequences if Moayed is sent to the U.S.  It also 
reflects his strong belief that political problems are best 
handled by personal negotiations, not by impartial judicial 
proceedings.  For Saleh, the weight of evidence against 
Moayed is easily balanced by the political consequences of 
angry domestic reaction as well as the increased economic 
devastation that would follow another terrorist attack 
against US or German interests.  End comment. 
 
13.  (C)  Action Requested:  Please advise if it will be 
possible to provide Post with a NIACT reply by COB 6/19 on: 
1) Response to Saleh\'s request that Moayed be returned to 
Yemen; 2) ROYG request that Moayed be interrogated in 
Germany; and/or 3) an update on Moayed\'s health condition. 
Charge told Qirbi on 6/18 that the best way to transform this 
case constructively would be for Moayed himself to cooperate 
with U.S. investigators seeking information on fund-raising 
in the U.S.  Post offers this as a possible point for 
inclusion in a U.S. reply to Saleh. 
 
14.  (C)  Text of President Saleh\'s 6/18 personal message to 
the U.S. Administration: 
 
(Begin text) 
 
President Saleh submits his personal request that al-Moayed 
be released and handed over to Yemen.  This is justified 
because he was not involved in terrorist acts.  If he had 
been, Yemen would be the first to investigate him, arrest him 
and break his head (sic). 
 
After his return to Yemen, he would be kept under arrest. 
There could be a joint U.S.-Yemeni investigation.  If the USG 
wishes, Germany could also participate. 
 
This question is being submitted in the common interest of 
Yemen and the United States. 
 
The President will leave for Germany in the next two days, 
and hopes to receive a positive answer from the U.S. side 
prior to his departure.

German Embassy: 
 
(Begin text) 
 
No.: 1/144/102/1315 
Date: June 17, 2003 
 
Republic of Yemen 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Minister\'s Office 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Yemen 
presents its best compliments to the Embassy of the friendly 
Germany in Sana\'a. 
In reference to the subject of the two Yemen citizens Mohamed 
Ali Hasan al-Maiad and his companion, the Ministry could not 
understand the deprivation of the defense lawyers of the two 
arrested Yemeni citizens, requested for extradition by the 
United States of America, from knowing the decisively 
important records in connection of the evaluation of the U.S. 
request of their extradition.  The Ministry could not either 
understand the uncertainty of the legal prosecution that 
deprives the two-mentioned lawyers from knowing the referred 
records.  On the basis of all these uncertainties expressed, 
the Yemeni party has inquired the details of the subject once 
again in a way that allows it to corroborate what is 
mentioned as follows: 
 
The U.S. request for extradition is basically founded on 
extracted information according to the information mentioned 
in the request of the U.S. including audio records and 
recorded video tapes in Frankfurt.  These records, judging 
upon the circumstances in which they were taken and the 
permission of their transforming to be in U.S.\'s possession 
must, logically and legally speaking, be submitted by German 
authorities.  Therefore, the legal interest of the two Yemeni 
citizens, without any additional explanation, is not 
obviously guaranteed to be fairly and objectively handled 
unless the defense lawyers have the access to find out the 
information the records contain.  These lawyers were not able 
to do so although they frequently requested to find out the 
information the records contain whether from the concerned 
authorities or even getting the records from these 
authorities, having a look at them and eventually returning 
them back later.  In addition, these lawyers were not 
informed even of the names of proper authorities that keep 
the records and the reference number that these files carry. 
What these lawyers know is only reference number that enables 
them to ask for a legal assistance from the Public 
Prosecution in the Regional Frankfurt Court.  The number of 
the reference is 9409AR204640/02.  That file does not 
contain, according to the Public Prosecution, any reports 
regarding the records conducted while the two Yemen citizens 
were subjected to monitoring.  In addition, the request of 
the two defense lawyers to find out what the file with the 
mentioned reference contains was not responded to. 
 
The Yemeni party sees what is going on as a quite striking 
fact when the defense lawyers were deprived in such a way to 
go ahead and defend the two Yemeni citizens. 
 
The government of the Yemen would like to mention here what 
was mentioned in the note received from the lawyer Mr. Klaus 
Gunter Newman dated March 27, 2003 that requests the return 
of the two Yemeni citizens to their country instead of that 
practice that represents a violation of the International 
Law.  The government of Yemen renews its request of the 
return of the two Yemeni citizens and handing them over to 
Yemen. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs avails itself of this 
opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the friendly German 
Republic its best respect and highest appreciation.

1.  (S/NF)  On June 18, before a meeting with FM Qirbi (see 
septels), Charge 
delivered the USG response to the ROYG request for 
information on Salah 
al-Muktar, the Saddam-era Iraqi Ambassador to Vietnam, to 
Abdul Hakim 
al-Iryani, Advisor to Foreign Minister Qirbi.  Iryani noted 
that the text (see 
para 4) appeared rather ambivalent, and did not explicitly 
answer the key 
question on Muktar\'s affiliation with the Iraqi Intelligence 
Service. 
Iryani also confirmed that Muktar arrived in Sanaa on Monday, 
June 16, and 
is in the care of a group of Iraqis living in Sanaa. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  FM Qirbi opened the 6/18 meeting with a plea for 
a quicker response 
to ROYG\'s requests for information.  Qirbi noted that some 
Iraqi officials 
whose names ROYG submitted to the U.S. for vetting (see 
septels) have since 
pulled their applications for asylum in Yemen, but did not 
offer specifics. 
ROYG faces a potential problem, said Qirbi, because some 
Iraqis are coming into 
the country without advising ROYG in advance -- Iraqis, like 
some other Arab 
nationals, do not require visas to enter Yemen. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  During a telcon with PolOff on 6/16, Iryani said 
the next request 
for USG vetting would include a high-level diplomat 
(Ambassador or 
DCM-equivalant) from Azerbiajan.  Post expects to receive the 
new list, as well 
as contact information for the ROYG mission in Baghdad, on 
Saturday, June 21.

1.  (U)  This is an action request -- see paragraph 6. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Summary:    The Charge received a call from 
Mohamed Sudam on behalf of President Saleh regarding Sheikh 
al-Moayed late on June 21.  He relayed a response from Saleh 
to the ref a points delivered by Charge earlier in the day by 
phone to Sudam.  President Saleh asked Charge to facilitate a 
phone conversation with FBI Director Mueller within two hours 
6/21 (by 1600 Washington time).  Saleh repeated his appeal 
(ref c) that Moayed be turned over to Yemen to allow for a 
joint Yemeni-U.S. investigation.  See paragraph 5 for text of 
message.  After discussing the request with NEA/ARP and 
failing to reach Sanaa\'s Legatt in Washington to check the 
feasibility and desirability of a phone conversation, Post 
responded to President Saleh by saying that a phone call was 
not feasible in that timeframe and that the points passed to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (details septel) represented 
the U.S. position.  President Saleh requested that a phone 
call still be arranged as soon as possible.  End Summary. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Muhamed Sudam, personal advisor and translator to 
President Saleh, phoned Charge from Germany at approximately 
2100 Sanaa time to respond to ref a points delivered by 
Charge by phone at approximately 1600 Sanaa time.  In a 
message translated directly from President Saleh (whose voice 
was audible in the background), Sudam dictated the appeal in 
paragraph 5.  Sudam relayed a request from President Saleh to 
facilitate a phone conversation with FBI Director Mueller. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Charge said he would look into the possibility of 
arranging a phone call but reiterated the points in ref a. 
Charge added that the issue in Germany was legal and not 
political, saying the United States had no standing in the 
German judicial system and cannot make them do what Saleh 
wants.  President Saleh asserted that the political and legal 
distinction is not so clear cut -- \"serious cooperation is 
needed to overcome problem.\" 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Text of President Saleh\'s 6/21 personal message 
to the U.S. Administration: 
 
President Saleh appeals again for the U.S. to agree to a 
joint Yemeni-U.S. investigation of Sheikh al-Moayed.  He 
should be returned to Yemen for that purpose.  President 
Saleh believes that al-Moayed is not a terrorist or a \"bad 
man,\" perhaps simply stupid. 
 
President Saleh has talked to the Germans and he says they 
are \"embarrassed\" by the case.  Based on his conversations, 
he thinks all the Germans would need is a \"green light\" from 
the United States to release al-Moayed to Yemen. 
 
The Yemen-U.S. relationship is bigger than al-Moayed.  We 
need to work together in a positive way to overcome this 
problem.  In Yemen, we can investigate together the details 
of al-Moayed\'s actions. 
 
Please facilitate a phone conversation with FBI Director 
Mueller so that President Saleh can discuss this matter. 
 
(End Text.) 
 
6.  (U)  Please advise on Saleh\'s request for a telcon with 
FBI Director Mueller to discuss the Moayed case.

 1.  (C)  Summary:  A ROYG-protected medical assistance 
convoy was attacked by unknown forces in Abyan governorate on 
June 21.  Reports of deaths and injuries differ, with the 
highest estimate at five dead.  No Amcits or other foreigners 
were involved.  The motive for the attack is yet unknown, and 
no one has claimed responsibility.  Embassy will continue to 
seek further information.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  The PSO has provided additional information on 
the attack that will be reported via ORCA channels. 
 
------------------------------ 
What We Know -- Where and When 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C)  All sources agree that the attack occurred on a 
medical assistance convoy traveling in the Sarar district in 
Abyan governorate in the early afternoon of June 21.  This 
area of Abyan governorate, to the northeast of Aden, is 
well-known as an area in which the recently dormant 
Aden-Abyan Islamic Army (AAIA) has occasionally operated in 
the past. The convoy consisted of two vehicles, both with Red 
Crescent markings and Defense Ministry license plates, with 
approximately seven Yemeni military medical personnel heading 
to Sarar to provide humanitarian assistance. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
What We Cannot Confirm -- 
Details/Results of Attack, Who and Why 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Most reports indicate an attack by rocket 
propelled grenades and AK-47s by an unknown number of 
assailants.  DMI sources told DATT that both RPGs and 
explosives were used.  Reports of deaths and injured differ. 
Ministry of Interior told RSO that seven were injured but 
none dead, and PSO contacts told Pol/Mil a similar story. 
However, DMI contacts told DATT that five were killed, which 
concurs with what the Governor of Abyan told the PSO liaison 
to Force Protection Detachment (FDP) Chief, who was in Aden. 
 
5.  (C)  The identity and motivation of the attackers remains 
unconfirmed.   PSO liaison told the FPD Chief that the 
Governor of Abyan presumed it was remnants of the AAIA who 
attacked the convoy, believing it was about to attack them. 
AP correspondent Ahmed al-Haj (please protect) told Pol FSN 
that his sources said the attackers numbered about 20 and 
were remnants of the AAIA. 
 
------------- 
Press Reports 
------------- 
 
6.  (U)  Official government daily al-Thawra reported on the 
attack, quoting an official source at the Ministry of 
Interior to Saba news agency.  The source said, \"yesterday at 
about 11 am, and while a group of Yemeni doctors and their 
assistants belonging to the military medical services was 
providing medical services to the citizens in the region of 
Habban of Sarar district, Abyan governorate, a group of armed 
persons fired on the doctors\' vehicles and their assistants 
which resulted in the injury of seven persons, a doctor, five 
assistants and the driver....\"  The source indicated that 
security forces are tracking down the criminals to bring them 
to justice.  The Ministry of Interior urges citizens to 
cooperate with the security forces \"to seize these criminals 
who committed this awful act by attacking people who are 
rendering humanitarian medical services to citizens.\" 
 
7.  (U)  Independent newspaper al-Ayyam reported the 
statement above, adding another statement from the local 
council in Sarar district.  The statement condemns the 
\"criminal terrorist act\" and says the presence of these 
groups (the perpetrators) in this region is strange.  It also 
said that \"these groups camped in the area. . .prior to the 
parliamentary elections of this year, and they were carrying 
out some provocative acts, firing on vehicles and tearing 
down pictures of candidates.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C)  The attack was not directed at Amcits or other 
foreigners, and occurred in a remote area previously 
associated with violent acts by the AAIA.  While there is no 
basis for viewing this as the opening of a new campaign 
rather than an isolated incident, the attack could 
nevertheless have implications for overall security in Yemen. 
 Yemeni authorities have been forthcoming with information, 
and Post will continue to follow events closely.  End Comment.

 1.(S)  On 6/21, Polecon Chief delivered reftel response to 
President Saleh\'s request for special consideration in the 
extradition case of Mohammed al-Moayed to the Foreign 
Minister\'s Office Director, Marwan Noman.  Noman promised to 
forward the response immediately to Foreign Minister 
al-Qirbi, who is traveling with President Saleh\'s party in 
Germany.  (The Charge also gave the response directly by 
telephone to Saleh\'s advisor, Mohammed Sudam, in Germany. 
Septel.) 
 
2. (S) Noman repeated many of the points raised by FM 
al-Qirbi in his 6/18 conversation with Charge (Ref B). 
-  President Salih faces great pressure to save al-Moayed 
from extradition to the U.S. 
-  The pressure increased after media reports on the alleged 
poor state of Al-Moayed\'s health and the isolation in which 
he is confined by German authorities. 
-  Many people fear that his treatment would be even worse in 
the United States. 
-  In these circumstances, President Saleh must do his best 
for a deserving Yemeni citizen; people will be watching and 
judging his efforts. 
-  Therefore, Saleh authorized official funds for al-Moayed\'s 
defense, is personnally appealing to the U.S. for a political 
solution, and has scheduled meetings in Germany with top 
officials to press the case. 
 
3. (C) Noman concluded with comments he described as purely 
personal:  The al-Moayed case would bring \"trouble no one 
needs\".  The U.S. should have brought its charges directly to 
Yemeni authorities, rather than giving the perception that 
al-Moayad had been \"kidnapped\" in Germany.   Finally, as a 
lawyer himself, he thought the case was \"very weak\" because 
it relied on a paid informer. PolEcon chief reminded Noman 
that al-Moayed and his associate,  Mohammed Mohsen Yahya, are 
answering the charges against them in a fair, impartial 
German court. If extradition is granted, they will have every 
opportunity to defend themselves in an equally fair American 
court. 
 
4. (C) Comment: The al-Moayed case is a difficult issue for 
the ROYG because it demonstrates its lack of international 
influence. Saleh\'s last minute involvement may have been an 
effort to show his good intentions to al-Moayed\'s supporters, 
but they will portray his failure to deliver al-Moayed as 
weakness. End Comment.

Summary 
--------- 
 
1. (C)  Summary:   ROYG Foreign Minister al-Qirbi pledged his 
support for an Article 98 agreement with the U.S. during the 
June 16-17 visit of U/S Bolton.  On timing, President Saleh 
was equivocal, suggesting that Yemen would not sign until a 
specified list of other Arab states were on board. According 
to the Foreign Minister, Saleh later agreed that Yemen would 
join \"some\" other Arab signatories by exchanging diplomatic 
notes (on the Egyptian model).  Al-Qirbi estimates the 
Ministry of Legal Affairs will take six to eight weeks to 
complete preparations for the notes. Parliamentary 
ratification of the Rome statute, which Yemen signed in 2002, 
will not come until some time later in the year. End Summary 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
Article 98: Important to America 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) During his June 16-17 visit to Yemen (septels), Under 
Secretary John Bolton pressed Foreign Minister Abu Bakr 
 
SIPDIS 
al-Qirbi on the urgent need to sign an Article 98 agreement 
with the U.S.  Explaining the importance of the issue to the 
American people, as well as the Administration, U/S Bolton 
assured the Minister that Article 98 is not meant to provide 
immunity for American citizens accused of serious crimes. In 
such circumstances, U.S. courts would provide immediate and 
vigorous prosecution.  The International Criminal Court, in 
contrast, risks becoming politicized and thus losing both 
credibility and effectiveness. 
 
3. (C)  U/S Bolton reminded the Foreign Minister that Egypt, 
Djibouti, and Bahrain had already signed Article 98 
agreements, and Kuwait was about to do so.  Yemen should join 
them as soon as possible.  A team of experienced U.S. 
negotiators would be ready to assist with any ROYG questions. 
 
----------------------- 
Endorsing the Agreement 
----------------------- 
4.  Al-Qirbi agreed on the importance of concluding an 
Article 98 agreement, having studied the issue for some time. 
His staff had recently completed a report on Article 98, 
recommending an exchange of diplomatic notes, rather than a 
bilateral treaty that would require parliamentary approval. 
Al-Qirbi promised U/S Bolton to refer that report, with his 
endorsement, to the Ministry of Legal Affairs for action. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
President Saleh: Bargaining on Numbers 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5.  President Ali Abdullah Saleh seemed less forthcoming 
during his Article 98 discussions with U/S Bolton.  Saleh 
said he wanted to see his GCC neighbors and a number of other 
Arab states on board before Yemen signed. His list of 
countries which must act before Yemen included the GCC 
countries, Egypt, Djibouti, Jordan Morocco, Tunisia, and 
Mauritania.   Half-jokingly, he proposed that the U.S. commit 
$100 million in development aid if it needed Yemen\'s 
immediate agreement. 
 
6. U/S Bolton reminded Saleh that it was politically 
important for Yemen to sign an agreement as soon as possible. 
 Other Arab States had either signed already, or were in the 
process of concluding agreements; Yemen should not wait for 
the last minute. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Yemeni Timetable: Six to Eight Weeks 
------------------------------------ 
 
7.  In a follow-up meeting on June 18 with Charge, FM 
al-Qirbi said he had reviewed U/S Bolton\'s visit with ROYG 
President Saleh.  Saleh had agreed in principle to an Article 
98 signing, as long as \"some\" other Arab states were already 
enrolled.   With this presidential green light, Qirbi 
estimated that the Ministry of Legal Affairs would take six 
to eight weeks to prepare for the exchange of notes. 
 
8.  The Charge welcomed al-Qirbi\'s assurances, and again 
stressed the need for Yemen to conclude an agreement as soon 
as possible.  Rather than waiting for other Arab states to 
act, Yemen should lead.  Al-Qirbi quipped that leadership is 
costly in the Middle East, but Yemen would proceed.   Charge 
asked the Foreign Minister to follow the issue personally, 
and promised to supply any information required by the 
Ministry of Legal Affairs.  He stressed that the exact 
wording of the text is very important and should follow the 
successful models already in force to prevent unnecessary 
delay. 
 
7.  Qirbi concluded by noting that Yemen\'s formal 
ratification of the Rome Statute was \"months away.\"  It had 
been referred to the Yemeni Parliament for ratification 
immediately after signing.  However, with the seating of the 
new parliament and government following the April 2003 
elections, the ratification process would have to begin again 
as new business. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  Comment:  FM Qirbi\'s timeline  - six to eight weeks for 
Legal Affairs to complete preparations for the exchange of 
diplomatic notes - is potentially achievable, given President 
Saleh\'s nod of approval and the number of Arab states now 
lined up for signature.  We will prod the ROYG on Article 98 
progress at every opportunity, and provide whatever 
information resources are needed to speed the work. End

COOPERATION

1.  (C)  Begin summary:  On June 21, Charge met with Minister 
of Interior Alimi to discuss recent developments in 
Yemen-Saudi border security, Red Sea counter-terrorism 
cooperation, press reports of Yemeni terrorist arrested in 
Saudi Arabia, and other issues.  The Charge was accompanied 
by RSO and PolOff.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Yemen-Saudi Arabia Border Security 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  During a 6/21 meeting with Minister of Interior, Dr. 
Rashad Alimi, Charge asked him to discuss the recent 
Yemen-Saudi border agreement and its implications for 
improved border security.  Alimi noted that Yemen-Saudi 
border cooperation is complicated by populations that 
straddle the border and flow freely from one side to the 
other.  The border security agreement between the two 
countries established several committees to manage this 
phenomenon, but controlling the flow of \"cars and lambs\" 
around the border towns is very difficult.  Smuggling remains 
a major problem; some groups are able to bypass ROYG 
checkpoints crossing from Yemen\'s Hadramut region into Saudi 
Arabia, and vice versa. 
 
3. (C)  Overall, Alimi described Yemen-Saudi border 
cooperation as strong and improving.  The joint committees 
are responsive to changes in the situation and meet whenever 
Yemeni or Saudi Arabia desires.  Since the recent terrorist 
attacks in Riyadh, Alimi feels there is a heightened Saudi 
commitment to security throughout the Kingdom. 
 
4.  (C)  Noting that the Minister of Defense was unable to 
attend a scheduled 6/17 meeting in order to deal with a 
security incident near Marib, Charge asked whether terrorist 
suspects had been arrested. Alimi explained that the incident 
was not terror-related, but criminal.  A group of criminals 
in Saudi broke a colleague out of police custody and fled 
across the border into Yemen.  Saudi Armed Forces, not 
police, followed the fugitives about 240 kilometers into 
Yemen, killing one during the exchange of gunfire which 
ensued.  The fugitives car later overturned in the desert. 
The remaining suspects ran off and remain at large.  The 
Minister of Defense went to Marib for talks with his Saudi 
Defense counterpart after this \"hot pursuit.\" 
 
5.  (C)  According to Alimi, ROYG considers the incident the 
sort of territorial infringement that underscores the need 
for cooperation.  The ROYG asked the Saudis to ensure that it 
does not happen again, \"Yemen will take care of the Yemeni 
side of the border, but we accepted their apology.\" 
 
6. (C)  In response to the Charge\'s query on recent press 
reports of Yemeni terrorists arrested in Saudi Arabia, Alimi 
noted that two people were arrested with false Yemeni 
passports, but are now believed to be Egyptians.  The ROYG is 
currently seeking the extradition of about 100 Yemenis in 
Saudi Arabia for criminal prosecution. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Qatari and Djiboutian Cooperation 
--------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Alimi indicated that there was no direct CT 
discussions during the recent visits of the Djiboutian 
President or the Qatari Emir to Yemen.  However, Qatar has an 
active  CT agreement with Yemen and works with all its 
neighbors on Red Sea security -- a top ROYG priority.  That 
security requires an effective Coast Guard reporting to the 
MOI.  Alimi then repeated a familiar refrain - Yemen needs 
financial assistance to defray the Coast Guard\'s $100 million 
plus price tag.  The Saudis have not been forthcoming - 
during Alimi\'s last trip to the Kingdom, they told him that 
the U.S. should assist the Coast Guard because of Yemen\'s 
cooperation in the war on terror. 
 
------------------------- 
And Now, About Our Cars... 
------------------------ 
 
8.  (C)  Charge thanked Alimi for MOI\'s commitment to the 
security of American interests in Yemen, and reiterated the 
need for continued vigilance.  Alimi agreed to look into some 
administrative delays that affect Embassy security including 
non-diplomatic license plates for Embassy vehicles and an 
18-car backlog of privately owned vehicles for mission 
personnel at Hodeidah port.

Bolton met with Dr. Moustafa Bahran, Chairman of the Yemeni 
National Atomic Energy Commission (NATEC) and science advisor 
to ROYG President Saleh.  Discussing the U.S. campaign to 
target and cut off revenue that funds North Korea\'s nuclear 
program, Bahran advised concentrating on the Ministry of 
Defense (MOD) and suggested the U.S. keep Yemen\'s development 
needs in mind.  Bahran outlined his work with the IAEA to 
secure nuclear materials and radioactive sources, proposed a 
joint Yemen-U.S.-UK-France resolution on the security of 
radioactive sources, and suggested a regional initiative to 
strengthen nuclear and radioactive controls.  End summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Yemen-DPRK Cooperation 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  During a working breakfast on June 17, U/S Bolton 
and the Chairman of Yemen,s National Atomic Energy 
Commission Dr. Moustafa Bahran discussed several issues, 
including Yemen\'s relationship with the DPRK.  Bolton noted 
that, while the U.S. is pursuing a diplomatic solution, it is 
also working to undermine the DPRK\'s nuclear program by 
stopping weapons sales and other transactions that provide 
funding.  Transit and purchasing countries, especially those 
in the Middle East, must say \"No\" to the DPRK.  He called 
Yemen the most important stop on his tour because of its 
known DPRK SCUD missile purchases, highlighted by the 
December 2002 interception of the So San cargo vessel.  The 
time has come for ROYG to join the international community in 
denouncing North Korea\'s unacceptable behavior. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Bahran said that Yemen-DPRK cooperation is purely 
a question of cost.  The U.S. must convince the Ministry of 
Defense (MOD), not the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), of 
the importance of this issue.  The MOD would have no problem 
working with the U.S. if convinced the U.S. offered 
affordable, realistic alternatives.   However, Bahran 
cautioned, if the price difference is too high, MOD will 
object. 
 
4. (S/NF) U/S Bolton suggested that the positive political 
gains of ending cooperation with the DPRK should also be 
calculated into the \"final price\".  The cooperation that led 
to resolution of the So San incident is only one example of 
the larger U.S.-Yemen partnership that the ROYG should take 
into consideration.  Bahran advised that if the USG shows 
consideration for Yemen\'s critical development needs, the 
DPRK problem would end. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  U/S Bolton said that during a recent meeting of 
11 countries in Madrid -- including Japan, a major donor to 
Yemen -- a decision was made to conduct more operations like 
the Spanish interdiction of the So San.  In light of the 
growing threat posed by North Korea\'s weapons program, Bolton 
noted these countries are willing to accept the burden of 
interdiction costs. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Security of Nuclear Materials and Radioactive Sources 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6.  (C)  Bahran noted that, in December 2000, Yemen was one 
of the first countries to raise the issue of protection and 
physical security of radioactive sources (PSRS).  In 2002, 
Yemen co-drafted and co-sponsored IAEA resolution 
GC/46/Res/13.  While the resolution is adequate, it does not 
do enough to address PSRS.  Bahran then outlined his efforts 
to enlist support for the passage of a three-part resolution 
at September\'s IAEA General Conference covering illicit 
trafficking, nuclear materials, and radioactive sources.  He 
met with the French Nuclear Commission in May, and plans to 
approach his counterparts in the U.S. and the UK later this 
summer to garner support for the resolution.  U/S Bolton then 
offered to assist Bahran in scheduling a meeting with 
Secretary Abraham at the Department of Energy. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
------------------- 
Regional Initiative 
------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Bahran cited poor security in many Gulf states as 
the impetus for the formation of a regional authority to 
harmonize PSRS licensing and enforcement.  By contributing to 
regional security, a ROYG-led initiative might also help 
Yemen\'s bid to join the Gulf Cooperation Council.  Bahran 
said President Saleh would send him to talk to Gulf leaders, 
but ROYG would appreciate U.S. assistance to set the stage 
with the GCC.  U/S Bolton agreed to carry Bahran\'s ideas back 
to Washington, but again suggested he raise these issues with 
Secretary Abraham directly. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
8.  (C)  Comment:  Dr. Bahran obviously enjoyed his meeting 
with U/S Bolton, and asked the U/S when he was meeting with 
the President.  At that point, no meeting had been requested 
or  scheduled.  Two hours later, President Saleh\'s office 
called to request an immediate meeting at the Presidential 
Palace (septel).  It appears likely that Bahran was directly 
responsible, reflecting the close relations between President 
Saleh and his science advisors.

efforts to stop North Korea,s nuclear program, as well as 
ongoing U.S. negotiations to reach Article 98 agreements with 
countries around the world.  President Saleh maintained that 
ROYG has no new SCUDS contracts with the DPRK, and has been 
very open about outstanding contracts for spare parts and 
maintenance.  He also noted that ROYG would suspend ongoing 
Yemen-DPRK negotiations on the construction of a naval base 
near Hodeidah if presented with a viable option.  End summary. 
 
------------------- 
Unscheduled Meeting 
------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  After receiving a last-minute invitation for an 
immediate meeting with ROYG President Saleh, U/S Bolton began 
their talks by congratulating President Saleh on Yemen,s 
successful April 27 parliamentary elections.  Salah said he 
was already beginning to work on his candidacy for the 2006 
presidential elections.  At the President,s request, Bolton 
described the nature of his mission to the region, and Yemen 
in particular, highlighting two issues:  North Korea,s 
nuclear proliferation and Article 98 (septel). 
 
------------------------- 
Ending DPRK Proliferation 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (S/NF)  U/S Bolton told Saleh that President Bush has 
personally directed U.S. officials to find a peaceful way to 
dismantle North Korea,s nuclear program.  The DPRK finances 
its nuclear program through the sale of weapons, narcotics, 
and illegal gambling.  If these sales were terminated, the 
international community could impede the progress of, if not 
stop completely, the DPRK,s nuclear program. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Bolton noted that historically many of DPRK,s 
sales have been to the Middle East region, so he was visiting 
four friendly nations -- Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and the 
UAE -- to seek an agreement on this issue.  Yemen was the 
most important stop on his trip.  The U.S. did not want to 
infringe upon Yemen,s legitimate defense needs, but wanted 
to work with Yemen to counter the immediate threat posed by 
North Korea. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  President Saleh noted that contacts with North 
Korea began in 1994 during Yemen\'s civil war, when the 
Socialist Party - then in control of southern Yemen - 
purchased 17 or 18 SCUDS from the DPRK.  When the war ended 
the ROYG was left with the contract.  Saleh stressed that all 
of the ROYG,s transactions with the DPRK were open; even the 
financing went through a bank or banks in the U.S. 
 
------------------------ 
Saleh - We Kept Our Word 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (S/NF)  Referring to his December 2002 telcon with 
Secretary Powell, Saleh said he had kept his promise that 
 
SIPDIS 
there would be no new contracts with the DPRK, thus proving 
that ROYG is credible and wants to have good relations with 
the U.S.  Saleh noted that he had told the Secretary, and 
later the U.S. Ambassador, that Yemen had an existing 
contract for spare parts, a SCUD maintenance team, and 
coastal defense artillery with the DPRK.  In addition, he 
said there were ongoing negotiations with the North Koreans, 
who work quite cheaply, to build a  naval facility near the 
port of Hodeidah.  The ROYG had asked for a loan for the 
naval facilities from the Japanese.  (Note: The Japanese 
Embassy has informed Post of this request and their 
subsequent refusal -- septel.)  Saleh said that ROYG had been 
planning to buy medium range missiles from the DPRK, but 
stopped when they learned of USG objections. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Naval Construction Project and Coastal Defenses 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
7.  (S/NF)  Noting his readiness to break off negotiations 
with North Korea, Saleh suggested the U.S. approach other 
nations to ask them to aid the ROYG with the naval 
construction projects because it is important to regional 
security.  Among potential donors the U.S. might lobby on 
Yemen\'s behalf, Saleh listed Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, 
Holland, and Japan.  U/S Bolton noted that he would convey 
Saleh,s message to Washington and remain in contact with 
ROYG on this issue. 
 
8.  (S/NF)  After placing a call to his staff to confirm the 
information, Saleh added that a team of North Koreans has 
been in Yemen for over a year working at a munitions factory 
in Abyan.  He said they have been making munitions for 
Kalashnikovs. 
 
------------------------------- 
Iraq and US - Yemen Cooperation 
------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Saleh changed topics with a \"special\" message to the 
U.S. Administration on Iraq.  Noting that the situation in 
Iraq is difficult and unstable, Saleh joked that the U.S. 
might unite Iraq and Kuwait and install a Kuwaiti ruler. 
 
10.  (C)  Saleh did not question or crticize Operation Iraqi 
Freedon, but said that he believed the U.S. had been 
surprised by the quick victory.  The ROYG has no confidence 
in the Iraqi opposition that is returning from abroad, said 
Saleh, and believes it has no support inside Iraq. 
 
11.  (C)  Saleh also noted the importance of cooperation 
between the U.S, and Yemen \"as full partners in the war on 
terrorism.\"  Last, but not least, he made a plea for 
continued U.S. assistance to Yemen, but also for U.S. 
advocacy on behalf of Yemen with the World Bank, the European 
Union, and the Gulf Cooperation Council.  \"Development is 
critical to Yemen\'s hopes of combating poverty.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12.  (C)  President Saleh was animated and voluble during his 
unscheduled meeting with U/S Bolton: joking about the 
Islamist opposition; stopping discussion to ask if he had met 
U/S Bolton\'s assistant, Mark Groombridge before (he had not); 
and offering facetious \"advice\" on Iraq.  However, he was 
evidently well briefed on U/S Bolton,s agenda regarding the 
DPRK, providing clarification of past discussions, as well as 
new information -- including the presence of North Koreans at 
the munitions factory in Abyan.  His concluding remarks on 
Yemen\'s immense development needs reflect grim reality.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Begin summary:  During a day of official meetings on 
June 17, Under Secretary for Non-Proliferation and 
International Security John R. Bolton met with Foreign 
Minister Abubaker al-Qirbi and MOD Chief of Staff Major 
General Mohammed al-Qasami to discuss Yemen\'s relations with 
the DPRK and to encourage the ROYG to sign an Article 98 
agreement (FM Qirbi Article 98 conversation reported septel). 
 Minister of State Qassim Ahmed al-Ajjam also briefed U/S 
Bolton on Yemen\'s humanitarian demining program and the 
impact of U.S. participation on its success.  During his 
visit to Yemen, U/S Bolton also met with President Saleh and 
his atomic energy advisor, Dr. Bahran -- see septels.  End 
summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Foreign Minister Qirbi 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  U/S Bolton, accompanied by Charge, Special 
Assistant Mark Groombridge, Jodie Green,OSD, and PolOff, 
began his meeting with Foreign Minister Abubaker al-Qirbi by 
discussing North Korea\'s nuclear program.  Bolton noted that 
since last summer\'s confirmation of the DPRK,s 
proliferation, the USG has worked hard to promote peaceful 
nuclear disarmament.  Unfortunately, he added, the DPRK has 
progressively escalated the conflict.  The USG will continue 
to pursue a diplomatic solution, but, the flow of money which 
is funding the DPRK,s nuclear program must be reduced, if 
not stopped entirely.  To this end, the U.S. is forming a 
partnership of people around the world to denounce the 
DPRK,s unacceptable behavior.  Yemen\'s participation in this 
partnership is very important because of ROYG SCUD missile 
purchases from the DPRK, highlighted by last year\'s So San 
incident.  Bolton said that it is time for Yemen and the U.S. 
to place pressure on the DPRK and deny it the ability to 
amass WMDs. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Bolton expressed his belief that a way can be 
found to deal peacefully with the DPRK.  Citing a recent 
conference in Madrid, Bolton noted that the U.S. is prepared 
to do more than just ask countries to cut off aid and stop 
transactions.  During the meeting in Madrid, eleven 
countries, all willing to bear the associated financial 
burden, are preparing to conduct operations to intercept 
suspect shipments from the DPRK.  However, it would be less 
problematic if there were no purchases at all.  Because of 
DPRK,s record of continued deception, the U.S. is concerned 
about the sale of WMDs, including plutonium and uranium.  The 
U.S. goal is to shut down DPRK sales of weapons and drugs, by 
working with Yemen and others in the region. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Yemen and the DPRK - No Love Story 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Foreign Minister Qirbi said that ROYG has been 
following the DPRK WMD problem and is ready to cooperate with 
the U.S.  There is no love between ROYG and North Korea: the 
relations are pragmatic, based on the low cost North Korea 
offers on arms and construction.  Qirbi stressed that the 
last shipment of SCUDS to Yemen was in December 2002, and 
ROYG is not upgrading the SCUDS in its possession.  There is 
an outstanding order for spare parts, totaling about $3-4 
million, and ongoing negotiations with DPRK for the 
construction of naval base. (Qirbi quickly added that ROYG is 
open to alternatives on the latter.) 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Qirbi also said that ROYG has no interest in 
providing the DPRK with any money for the development of 
WMDs, particularly in light of the threat to Japan - a major 
donor to Yemen.  Bolton noted that the U.S. has talked to 
China and Russia on this issue.  The U.S. is in a race to 
resolve the problem before the DPRK,s weapon status becomes 
even more advanced. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  Qirbi responded by noting that ROYG still needs 
to explore ways in to develop their coastal defense in the 
absence of the DPRK.  While the problem of the Yemen-Saudi 
border is being addressed by new security agreements with the 
Saudis, Yemen has over 2,000 kilometers of coastline which is 
difficult to control and must be secured.  Before 
unification, Yemen had a limited naval capacity, and 
currently has almost none.  The estimated cost for a new 
naval base in Aden or Hodeidah was $80-100 million.  U/S 
Bolton expressed an interest in pursuing this issue further. 
-------------------------------------- 
MOD Chief of Staff Qasami and the DPRK 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (S/NF)  U/S Bolton was originally scheduled to meet with 
Minister of Defense Abdullah Ali Aliwa, who was called away 
on short notice in response to a border incident near Marib 
(septel).  Chief of Staff Major General Qasami began by 
apologizing for the Minister,s absence while noting ROYG,s 
satisfaction with U.S.-Yemen cooperation in the war against 
terror.  Training by U.S. forces has greatly improved 
Yemen,s capabilities and with time, will advance them even 
more. 
8.  (S/NF)  U/S Bolton noted that, while the U.S. has no 
intention of infringing upon Yemen,s legitimate defense 
needs, it is important that the U.S. and Yemen work together 
to cut off the flow of funding for the DPRK,s nuclear 
program.  The U.S., he said, seeks a firm political agreement 
that Yemen will have no additional procurement from the DPRK, 
and will work with the U.S. to monitor and exchange 
information on the DPRK and their sales in the Middle East. 
 
9.  (S/NF)  Qasami noted that ROYG has discussed this issue 
before, notably with Secretary Powell, and hopes the U.S. 
understands Yemen\'s position.  The purchase of the SCUDS was 
initiated in 1994 just before Yemen\'s civil war.  ROYG 
subsequently asked for the money back, but, he said, the 
request was ignored.  In the end ROYG decided to take the 
SCUDS. Qasami emphasized that no more SCUDS will be purchased 
and the ROYG will not upgrade those it already possesses. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Negotiations with DPRK for a Navy Base 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10. (S/NF)  Reviewing the same list of ongoing matters as FM 
Qirbi, Qasami mentioned an agreement with the DPRK for 
maintenance of missiles and coastal defenses and negotiations 
on the possible construction of a naval base. U/S Bolton 
noted that the U.S. would like to cut off these transactions 
as well, and asked about alternative bidders -- perhaps from 
Eastern Europe.  Qasami replied that ROYG looked at Eastern 
European contractors but they were expensive and they all 
wanted cash.  As for the contract for maintenance of coastal 
defenses, that had been signed and partially paid, but the 
amount -- about seven million dollars-- is not large.  The 
ROYG will stop that contract, he offered, if the U.S. will 
reimburse them. 
 
11.  (C)  COS Qassimi again noted that ROYG will stop 
negotiations with the DPRK for the naval base if the U.S. is 
willing to assist.  He lamented the many problems facing ROYG 
-- smuggling, Somali refugees, drug trafficking, and illegal 
fishing -- as well as the lack of the facilities and 
equipment necessary to deal with them.  What happened to the 
Cole and the Limberg must not happen again, but the ROYG 
needs U.S. assistance to prevent future terrorist attacks. 
U/S Bolton replied that he did not question the ROYG,s 
assessment of their needs; the U.S. is prepared to work with 
Yemen and others interested in solving the North Korean 
problem. 
 
-------------------------- 
The MOD View of Article 98 
-------------------------- 
 
12.  (C)  Article 98:  Qasami noted that the Article 98 issue 
was being worked between the MFA and the Ministry of Legal 
Affairs.  If they ask the MOD for advice, he would support an 
agreement.  Charge added that this should be an important 
issue for MOD because if Yemen ratifies the ICC before 
signing an Article 98 agreement, it will result in the loss 
of military funding.  Qasami concluded by expressing his 
appreciation for U.S cooperation on military assistance and 
demining, noting that 95% of demining staff are recruits from 
the MOD. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Demining: Successful Program with \"A Long Way to Go\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
13.  (C)  Minister of State and Chairman of the National Mine 
Action Committee (NMAC) Qassim Ahmed al-Aajam thanked U/S 
Bolton for United States support to the ROYG\'s humanitarian 
demining program.  American assistance was the \"fundamental 
basis\" for demining\'s achievements over the past few years, 
but continued USG engagement was crucial.  Mansour al-Azi, 
the Executive Director of the NMAC, gave a presentation on 
Yemen\'s humanitarian demining program overall and the impact 
of U.S. contributions specifically.  After the presentation, 
U/S Bolton spoke about the long-term needs of the demining 
program, and  offered to check the status of current USG 
funding for Yemen upon his return to Washington. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Development: The Key to Security in Yemen 
----------------------------------------- 
 
14.  (C)  Development was the main topic during U/S Bolton\'s 
lunch with Ahmad Soufan, Deputy Prime Minister/Minister of 
Development and International Cooperation, Foreign Minister 
Qirbi and Charge.  Soufan and Qirbi both emphasized that 
progress in development was the key to security and stability 
in Yemen.  Development is the most important issue for the 
people of Yemen, because they need hope for the future and 
progress they can see in their daily lives.  Qirbi also 
raised the Millennium Challenge Account, noting that Yemen is 
on the list of eligible countries.  Both Ministers were 
relaxed and cordial during the lunch, and thanked U/S Bolton 
for coming to Yemen.  Soufan emphasized that U.S. visitors do 
not come to Yemen frequently enough.

1.  (S/NF)  Summary and Comment:  On June 25, ROYG launched 
an offensive against terrorists suspected in the June 21 
attack on a ROYG military medical convoy in Abyan (ref).  The 
successful operation resulted in approximately 30 combatants 
killed or captured.  Initial reports indicate a link between 
these terrorists and al-Qaeda, and the strong ROYG response 
appears to have dealt an important and successful blow 
against attempts to re-establish a strong al-Qaeda presence 
in Yemen.  The contribution of U.S.-trained Central Security 
Forces (CSF), the open lines of communication between ROYG 
and the Embassy during this operation and strong 
counterterrorism cooperation between Yemen and the U.S. 
generally emphasize the importance of continuing robust CT 
training assistance.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Additional information on both attacks has been 
reported via ORCA and other channels.

ROYG Operation Against Possible AAIA Remnants in Abyan 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3.  (S/NF)  The attack on a ROYG military medical convoy by 
terrorists, believed to be comprised of remnants of the 
Aden-Abyan Islamic Army (AAIA) and other extremists, in Abyan 
on June 21 left seven injured (ref).  In response, 
approximately 700 ROYG military and security forces gathered 
in the region of the Hatat mountains in Abyan governorate on 
June 24.  Five terrorists surrendered overnight on June 24 
according to DMI sources.  After negotiations for surrender 
failed and the 1000 June 25 deadline passed without result, 
the ROYG forces began their assault on the remaining 
terrorists (estimated at 80-100 persons).  The combined ROYG 
forces included the Army and U.S.-trained Central Security 
Forces (CSF).  Involvement of possible Political Security 
Organization (PSO) forces could not be confirmed.  The attack 
began with an artillery barrage, followed by helicopter 
attacks and a frontal assault by ground forces. 
 
4.  (C)  Consistent but unconfirmed reports from press 
reports and other sources put the number of extremists killed 
or captured at between 20 and 30.  Those captured were being 
interrogated.  Press reports confirmed by CSF also indicate 
that a large amount of explosives and weapons were also 
seized on June 25.

PSO Chief Gamish -- Terrorist Leader Linked to al-Qaeda? 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
5.  (S/NF)  At the request of President Saleh via a phone 
call to the Ambassador, the Ambassador and ORCA Chief met 
with Political Security Organization (PSO) Chief Gamish on 
6/26.  Gamish said the reputed leader of the insurgents, Abu 
Bashir Abdul Nabi, was recently in Saudi Arabia and came to 
Yemen in the last three months.  A mujaheed who fought in 
Afghanistan, his mission in Abyan was allegedly to 
re-organize Yemeni al-Qaeda, which has been degraded in the 
last year.  Press reports stated that Abdul Nabi was killed 
in action, and Col. Yahya Saleh of the CSF confirmed that he 
was killed.  Gamish reported that two ROYG forces were killed 
in action and that several captured extremists were being 
interrogated.  DMI told the DATT that two ROYG forces were 
killed and three wounded.

ROYG Op Successful -- U.S.-trained Forces Key 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (S/NF)    The Central Security Forces (CSF) 
Counterterrorism Unit is a newly formed entity within the 
Central Security Organization (CSO).  The unit currently 
consists of approximately 150 officers and enlisted.  All 
members of the unit received basic training in rural and 
urban CT tactics.  The training has been and continues to be 
provided by U.S. and U.K. military trainers.  Both groups of 
trainers assess the unit members as being highly motivated. 
The Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) touts this unit as 
the National CT unit of Yemen. 
 
7.  (S/NF)  The CSF CT Unit deployed to the Abyan area in 
response to the 6/21 attack on the ROYG military medical 
team.  This unit was the only ground element that was 
deployed from the North of Yemen.  They were heavily involved 
in the fighting, engaging the enemy at ranges as close as 15 
meters.  They were also tasked to clear and search in excess 
of 20 caves. The unit returned to Sana\'a after the 
hostilities on June 27 only to be redeployed on the morning 
of June 28.  The ongoing effort is aimed at further 
exploiting the caves for intelligence and looking for 
remnants of the terrorist group. 
 
8.  (S/NF)  On the evening of June 28, CSF officials invited 
U.S. military trainers to view film footage of combat 
operations conducted by the CSF during the Abyan operation. 
The film confirmed the capture of a large quantity of 
explosives and at least six dead terrorists.  The dead 
terrorists did not appear to be native Yemenis but foreign 
fighters with long beards and military-style ammo vests.  CSF 
indicated that a reduced-length copy of the film will be 
released to the Embassy in the near future. 
 
-------------------------- 
Comment and Recommendation 
-------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  President Saleh and others have requested continued 
U.S. support for counterterrorism training and the Embassy is 
studying requests for an expansion of economic assistance to 
the Abyan governorate as an area targeted by extremists as an 
operations area.  Somewhat unusually, the ROYG kept the 
Embassy continually informed on developments and invited the 
media to cover the operation.  Additionally, the effective 
performance of the U.S.-trained CSF adds a strong argument 
for sorely-needed further funding to continue and expand CT 
training.

AL-HAYAT 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (U)  Begin summary:  A recent interview with Speaker of 
Parliament Sheikh Abdullah bin Hussein al-Ahmar provides an 
illustrative example typifying the views of this prominent 
Yemeni political figure.  Al-Ahmar is known for his 
controversial ideas as demonstrated in a June 20 interview 
with London-based daily Al-Hayat in which he criticized the 
Arab response to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the 
situation in Iraq, condemned the Sharm-al-Sheikh and Aqaba 
summits and described the domestic political scene from his 
vantage point as leader of Yemen\'s second largest party. See 
biographic note in paragraph 8.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Palestinian-Israeli Conflict 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  In a 6/20 interview with the London-based daily 
Al-Hayat, Yemeni Speaker of Parliament Sheikh al-Ahmar 
denounced \"Arab pressures on the Palestinian groups to stop 
the legitimate resistance against the Zionist occupation\" and 
criticized the Roadmap.  He explained that Arab opposition to 
the Palestinian issue is the result of \"defeat, internal 
fear, and the inability to say no to the occupation and 
Zionist terrorism.\"  Sheikh al-Ahmar condemned the 
Sharm-al-Sheikh and Aqaba summits because \"they turned the 
resistance, martyrdom, and the jihad against Zionism into 
terrorism.\"  He asked \"what dignity and value is left for the 
Arabs if they abandon the legitimacy of the Palestinian 
resistance?  How can they confront Israel with all its 
military capabilities and American support without the 
resistance?\"  Al-Ahmar surmised that \"martyrdom and the jihad 
card is the only thing left to confront Israel.  The Arabs 
should defend all the Palestinian factions in order to 
continue the free and legitimate resistance.\" 
 
---- 
Iraq 
---- 
 
3.  (U)  Sheikh al-Ahmar blamed Arab states for the situation 
in Iraq saying that \"had it not been for the green light from 
some Arab and Muslim states, the U.S wouldn\'t have invaded 
and occupied Iraq.\"  Al-Ahmar believes \"Arab states are 
responsible for what is happening (in Iraq) after the fall of 
Saddam Hussein\'s regime under the pretext of the existence of 
weapons of mass destruction.  The Americans have no excuse 
anymore for slaughtering and annihilating the Iraqi people 
and destroying the country.  It is impermissible to remain 
silent over the massacres, violation of honor, desecration of 
land and holy site that is taking place now in Iraq.\" 
 
--------------- 
Domestic Issues 
--------------- 
 
4.  (U)  Discussing domestic issues for the first since the 
April 27 parliamentary elections, al-Ahmar said that Yemen\'s 
political situation is \"better than that of the other Arab 
countries despite the cracks and violation.\"  Commenting on 
President Saleh\'s recent decision to pardon 16 former ROYG 
officials living in exile, he declared that \"President Saleh 
is known for his leniency and his care for all the sons of 
Yemen.\"  Al-Ahmar denied that he ever objected to or voiced 
any reservations about the pardon, saying that he has always 
supported \"closing the pages of the past\" for Yemen\'s 
interest and stability.  Sheikh al-Ahmar said that during the 
campaign for the April 27 parliamentary elections \"the Islah 
alliance with the YSP and other opposition parties...under 
the umbrella of the Joint Meeting Parties was a natural 
phenomenon.\"  However, he admitted that he was not one of 
those who supported this experiment. 
 
5.  (U)  Al-Ahmar disclosed a tension between GPC and Islah 
\"due to the violations, extortion, and pressure by the ruling 
party against Islah during the elections,\" but stressed that 
\"this tension does not pose a danger to security and 
stability in Yemen.\"  He described it as a temporary 
disagreement that coincided with the elections and will not 
turn into ongoing confrontations.  Continuing, he added that 
had it not been for the Islah leadership\'s flexible and 
patient policy the elections could have been a catastrophe. 
Had the election been fair, which al-Ahmar asserted it was 
not, he believes Islah would have won twice as many seats. 
He added that YSP was expected to win the largest number of 
seats, but \"the GPC worked to turn everything in its favor.\" 
 
6.  (U)  In the aftermath of the 4/27 elections, al-Ahmar 
said that although Prime Minister Ba Jammal\'s government was 
granted confidence by the majority of the ruling party MPs, 
there were those who questioned the new program, but \"were 
afraid of being held accountable later if they blocked the 
vote of confidence.\"  Returning to the ROYG line, al-Ahmar 
re-affirmed his condemnation of all acts of terrorism and 
expressed his support for President Saleh\'s policies in 
combating terrorism and promoting security and stability in 
Yemen. 
 
-------------------- 
Comment and Bio Note 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Begin comment:  The 70-year old Yemeni Speaker of 
Parliament is also the foremost sheikh of the Hashid tribe 
and chairman of Islah (an Islamist-oriented reform party and 
the second largest political party in Yemen).  His status as 
tribal leader, business leader and Speaker of Parliament 
allows al-Ahmar a prominent platform.  Sheikh al-Ahmar is 
well-known for his anti-U.S. rhetoric and, more recently, his 
opposition to the inclusion of female candidates in the 4/27 
parliamentary elections.  For him, the tribe and its 
authority are above everything else.  His comments to 
Al-Hayat are consistent with his conservative ideals, 
represent a broad spectrum of thought in Yemen and illustrate 
areas of continued tension between his followers and more 
moderate elements in Yemen.  End comment. 
 
8.  (U)  Begin bio note:  Sheikh al-Ahmar was born in the 
Amran governorate in 1933.  He was active in the national 
struggle against Imamite rule and was imprisoned in 1959 by 
the late Imam Ahmed.  (Imam Ahmed also executed al-Ahmar\'s 
father and brother.)  Al-Ahmar was released from prison after 
the 1962 revolution against the Imam, and led the Hashid 
tribes in defense of the revolution and the republic.  He was 
appointed as a member of the Presidential Council, formed 
after the 1962 revolution, and was Minister of Interior in 
three consecutive cabinets.  In 1969, al-Ahmar was elected 
Chairman of the National Council that was tasked with 
drafting the constitution, and in 1972 he was elected 
Chairman of the Shura Council.  After unification and the 
declaration of political pluralism, al-Ahmar called for the 
formation of the Islah party.  Al-Ahmar became the first 
Speaker of Parliament in 1993, and was re-elected in 1997, 
2000 and 2003.  Four of his sons are members of the newly 
elected parliament: two are Islahis, while the other two 
represent GPC (the ruling party).  End bio note.

1. (U)Summary: Embassy Sanaa presents the MEPI Strategy 
2003/04 at para 2,  prepared by the Embassy Development Team 
that includes Pol/Econ, PD and USAID. This strategy reflects 
Embassy Sanaa\'s long-term goals for MEPI.  Embassy Sanaa 
believes MEPI will become a substantive part of our 
engagement with the ROYG, and looks forward to substantial 
programs in the MEPI pillars of Education, Democracy and 
Economic Reform. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) BEGIN MEPI STRATEGY TEXT: 
 
-------------------------- 
Introduction and Overview 
-------------------------- 
 
In the past two years, the U.S.-Yemeni relationship made 
great strides: Yemen is a key partner in the war on 
terrorism, a USAID office re-opened, and recent 
Parliamentary elections demonstrate that Yemen is making 
solid democratic progress.   However, internal instabilities 
are threatening the country\'s move towards greater democracy 
and economic freedom, which could possibly weaken the U.S.- 
Yemen partnership against terrorism. Extreme poverty, an 
uneducated populace, inexperienced civil society, and 
traditional tribal order all threaten Yemen\'s ability to 
move forward. 
 
Over the next five years, Embassy Sanaa\'s MEPI goals are 
aimed at giving Yemen an opportunity to provide its citizens 
with more educational opportunities, stronger democratic 
institutions, and improved economic conditions.  MEPI 
initiatives will expand choices in education, government, 
and economics to empower all Yemenis, including the 
traditionally marginalized categories of the poor, women, 
and children, to become active participants in all aspects 
of Yemeni society. 
 
Specifically, we expect Yemen to have made great strides in 
its security situation, buttressed by significant progress 
in democracy. A diversified economy will provide jobs for a 
growing population.  In education, we envision greater 
access to schools for both girls and boys, and more 
education choices that lead toward jobs in the private 
sector. 
 
Specifically, Embassy Sanaa requests MEPI funding for: 
 
Education Reform 
  1)   Expanding basic education and literacy; 
2)   Increasing English language training; 
3)   Improving technical training; and 
  4) Expanding U.S.- Yemeni Education and Research 
  Cooperation 
 
Political Reform 
  1)   Strengthening democratic institutions 
2)   Improving electoral processes 
3)   Reforming the judiciary 
4)   Increasing the professionalism of media organizations 
and journalists 
 
Economic Reform 
  1)   Increasing trade and investment 
2)   Expanding employment and business opportunities at the 
local level 
3)   Enhancing policy reform and program development 
 
Each pillar strategy is comprehensive and includes an 
analysis of the need for reform along with achievable and 
measurable results. The entire MEPI strategy corresponds to 
our 2005 MPP plan, including Goal 3: Democratic Systems and 
Practices; Goal 4: Economic Growth and Development; and Goal 
5: International Public Opinion.  Based on this strategy, 
Embassy Sanaa looks forward to working closely with MEPI and 
USAID personnel to develop specific activities and Request 
for Grant Proposals. 
 
 
--------- 
Education 
--------- 
 
The quality of education and training helps determine 
economic development and social progress in Yemen. 
Therefore, Embassy Sanaa will focus on raising education 
standards and providing the training needed to meet the 
demands of the modern business environment and increased 
trade. Higher education standards will also create an 
improved climate for development goals.   Corresponding with 
Post\'s MPP Economic Growth and Development and International 
Public Opinion goals, the MEPI Education strategy includes 
support for:  1) Expanding basic education and literacy; 2) 
Increasing English language training; 3) Improving technical 
training; and 4) Expanding US-Yemeni education and research 
cooperation. 
 
1. Expanding Basic Education and Literacy 
 
Problem: Only half of all Yemeni children aged 6 to 11 
enroll in school and gender disparity is pronounced, 
especially in rural areas where only 30% of girls attend 
school and two-thirds drop out before completing their 
primary education.  In the rural areas where three-fourths 
of Yemenis live, 68% of men and 94% of women have had no 
formal education or have failed to complete primary school. 
Nearly all (91%) never-married rural women are illiterate. 
Only 60 percent of teachers have a basic education, or at 
most, one to two years of secondary school.  The majority of 
children in grades 4-6 have difficulty relating what they 
learn in schools to their daily lives. Most pupils have 
limited ability to read, write or solve problems.  There are 
shortages of teachers and teaching materials.  Constraints 
also include severe overcrowding, insufficient numbers of 
schools and inadequate school buildings. 
 
In Yemen, girls are more likely to enroll and stay in school 
if they have female teachers, but only a fifth of Yemeni 
teachers are women and only 8% of those women teachers work 
in the rural areas.  Only 56% of schools have any toilet 
facilities and few have separate facilities for girls. 
Overcrowded co-educational classrooms also deter girls\' 
enrollment and retention because families feel uncomfortable 
with the close physical proximity of male and female 
students. 
 
MEPI Strategy: 
 
The USG education strategy in Yemen focuses on basic 
education (grades 1-6), improved literacy, especially for 
women and girls, and education reform.  To carry out these 
goals, Embassy Sanaa seeks MEPI funding in the following 
areas: 1) Enhancing access to quality primary education in 
the public sector; 2) Increasing literacy and numeracy for 
adults and out-of-school youth at the community level; and, 
3) Improving the environment for public education. 
 
1. Enhancing access to quality primary education in the 
public sector: 
 
     -- Build, renovate and equip elementary schools in 
     partnership with community organizations. Special 
     attention will be paid to physical constraints to 
     girls\' participation (e.g. separate latrines) 
 
     -- Train teachers (especially female teachers) with a 
     focus on improved students\' ability to think abstractly 
     and solve problems 
 
     -- Train administrators to better manage limited 
     resources and increase engagement with the community 
 
2. Increasing literacy and numeracy for adults and out-of- 
school youth at the community level: 
 
     -- Create opportunities for illiterate men, women and 
     children in rural communities to learn to read, write 
     and do basic math in programs related to their needs. 
     Community-based activities may include 
     radio/video/internet distance-learning and parents\' and 
     women\'s education circles 
 
3.  Improving the environment for public education 
 
     -- Develop district and governorate education plans 
     with community participation; Increase citizen input by 
     providing education planning and program grants 
     -- Promote new teaching approaches, i.e., interactive 
     and inquiry-based learning 
     -- Develop policies to increase girls\' enrollment and 
     retention in school 
     -- Structure outreach programs to educate adults and 
     out-of-school youth 
     -- Provide technical assistance to the Ministry of 
     Education and the district and governorate education 
     offices to implement the ROYG decentralization 
     objectives and the ROYG Basic Education Strategy 
     -- Provide technical assistance to the ROYG at all 
     levels to collect and use education data for planning 
     and management 
     -- Develop IT applications that can be used with solar 
     and satellite technology 
     -- Develop programs to improve public attitudes 
     regarding the value of education, especially for girls 
 
Expected Results: 
 
     -- Increased number of teachers trained in interactive, 
     inquiry-based, teaching methods 
     -- Increased number of administrators trained, with a 
     focus on maximizing limited resources 
     -- Education facilities improved 
     -- Increased average number of days teachers spend in 
     the classroom 
     -- Increased enrollment and retention of girls in 
     school 
     -- Increased numbers of adults and out-of-school youth 
     with improved basic literacy and numeracy skills 
     -- Expanded communities receiving education outreach 
     services 
     -- Community-based education organizations formed or 
     strengthened 
     -- District and governorate education plans and 
     resource allocation budgets prepared with community 
     participation 
     -- District and governorate education offices with data- 
     based planning capacity; District education offices 
     that plan and share budget information with the 
     community 
 
2.  Increasing English Language Training 
 
Problem: English language instruction is uneven throughout 
the Republic of Yemen.  In Sanaa, English has become a 
\"second language,\" where it is routinely used in business, 
educational and diplomatic endeavors.  The Yemen America 
Language Institute (YALI)\'s high enrollment figures 
(approximately 1,350 students per term), the number of new 
language institutes, and the number of professional job 
vacancies requiring English proficiency all point to a clear 
demand for quality English language instruction. 
 
Outside of Sanaa, however, a far lower percentage of the 
population has any working knowledge of English.  Moreover, 
there are few venues to learn English outside of Yemeni 
schools and universities in the major cities.  Even where 
English is taught, the quality of language teaching is 
mediocre.   Without increased opportunities to learn 
English, Yemen\'s development options will continue to be 
limited along with the American-Yemeni political, economic, 
and cultural relations. 
 
MEPI Strategy: 
 
To improve the quality of English language training in Yemen 
and to expand access to English instruction, Embassy Sanaa 
seeks MEPI funding to: 
 
     -- Expand English language instruction in rural Yemen 
     -- Provide training in technical and specialty topics 
     (e.g. medical, auxiliary health services, public 
     administration, engineering, business, trade, finance) 
     -- Offer stipends (tuition, fees, materials, 
     transportation and living expenses) for students and in- 
     service training 
     -- Train English teachers in improved methodology and 
     curriculum 
     -- Supply instructional materials to expand English in 
     public sector classrooms 
 
Expected Results: 
     -- Increased numbers of schools and language centers 
     teaching English 
     -- Expanded pool of teachers able to teach English 
     -- More Yemenis able to communicate and work in English 
 
3. Expanding Technical Training: 
 
Problem: There are too few job opportunities for Yemen\'s 
growing population.  For those who have a high school 
education, finding work is difficult because their skills 
often do not match the needs in the public and private 
sectors.  Adults also do not have the skills now demanded by 
the labor market and must be retrained.  Furthermore, those 
who have academic degrees often lack the practical skills 
required by employers. 
 
MEPI Strategy: 
 
To provide appropriate training suitable for the job market 
in Yemen and to enhance education opportunities for Yemenis, 
the Embassy seeks to use MEPI funding to: 
 
     -- Train teachers at technical universities in updated 
     teaching methodology 
     -- Strengthen Community College management and their 
     ability to provide practical, job-related training 
     -- Promote workforce development centers with the 
     private and public sectors 
     -- Develop curricula in basic technical areas such as: 
     computer skills, laboratory technicians, medical 
     equipment operators and repair technicians, 
     electronics, management, accounting, building 
     management, construction management, hotel and tourism 
     administration 
     -- Offer scholarships to enable students to attend 
     technical training (tuition, fees, materials, 
     transportation and living expenses) 
 
Expected Results: 
     -- Increased enrollment at technical institutes 
     -- Strengthened community college system, including 
     increased enrollment 
     -- Workforce development centers established in 
     partnership with the private and public sectors 
     -- New curricula and teaching materials developed and 
     used by teachers 
     -- Expanded number of students trained and placed in 
     jobs 
 
 
4.  Expanding US/Yemeni Education and Research Cooperation: 
 
Problem: American researchers who wish to visit Yemen lack a 
permanent home from where to base their research. Presently, 
the American Institute of Yemeni Studies (AYIS), the premier 
institute of its kind in Sanaa, has been operating out of 
ill-equipped, leased quarters.  As a result, AIYS is unable 
to expand its cultural outreach activities that promote 
deeper understanding between Yemen and America. 
 
MEPI Strategy: Post seeks funding to acquire a facility for 
AIYS. 
 
Expected Results: 
     -- Enhanced U.S.- Yemen cooperation in research and 
     cultural exchanges 
     -- Establishment of a permanent home for the American 
     Institute of Yemeni Studies 
 
---------------- 
Political Reform 
---------------- 
 
Despite a weak economy, nascent democratic development, and 
few examples to draw from in the Middle East, Yemen has 
moved towards significant political reform since 1990. 
Yemen has universal suffrage, a multi-party system, elected 
national and local representatives, and an active, if still- 
developing, civil society sector.  However, recent April 
2003 parliamentary elections exposed the considerable 
weaknesses that remain in Yemen\'s political reform efforts, 
including allegations of fraud, a lack of support for women 
candidates, and a judicial and media system that favored the 
ruling party. 
 
With local council and presidential elections scheduled for 
2006 providing an important opportunity, the MEPI goals of 
strengthening democratic processes, promoting the rule of 
law and accountable, effective government institutions, and 
strengthening the role of media in society will help 
strengthen citizens\' participation in democratic life and 
foster a society in which adherence to the rule of law is 
the norm.  Corresponding with Post\'s MPP Democratic Systems 
and Practices goal, the Embassy Sanaa strategy for MEPI 
political reform support includes the following categories: 
1) Strengthening democratic institutions; 2) Improving 
electoral processes; 3) Reforming the judiciary; and, 4) 
Increasing the professionalism of media organizations and 
journalists. 
 
1.  Strengthening Democratic Institutions 
 
Problem:  Yemen\'s democratic institutions remain fragile, 
which reduces the avenues by which strong democratic reform 
can take root, particularly regarding the inclusion of women 
and other underrepresented groups.  Local councils, elected 
in 2001, represent an arm of government close to the 
citizens where women and opposition parties stand a much 
better chance to take advantage of political life. However, 
local councils lack the resources, skills, and knowledge of 
their power to function properly.  ROYG Ministry offices at 
the district and governorate levels lack the ability, 
resources, and experience to implement ROYG decentralization 
policy, and engage effectively with elected officials and 
citizens. 
The Parliament also remains weak and is not effective in 
providing oversight of the executive branch of ROYG, 
drafting legislation, or representing constituents.   While 
Yemen enjoys an active multi-party system, the ruling party 
dominates the political scene and all parties lack a clear 
long-term strategy, a membership base that represents 
citizens, and a democratic internal structure.  Strong 
political parties that effectively represent Yemenis are 
needed to consolidate democratic progress.  In a similar 
way, most non-governmental organizations (NGOs) suffer from 
poor organization, little experience, and unfocused goals 
that reduce their ability to advocate effectively on behalf 
of the community, particularly outside of urban areas. 
 
MEPI Strategy: 
 
To strengthen democratic institutions, Embassy Sanaa seeks 
MEPI funding for long-term multi-year programs for 
activities in the following areas: 1) Increasing democratic 
participation; 2) Encouraging decentralization; and, 3) 
developing the NGO sector and civil society. 
 
1. Increasing Democratic Participation 
 
     -- Local council governance program to assist members 
     to better represent their constituents and act as more 
     effective officials through training on their legally 
     mandated roles and responsibilities, including 
     integrating traditional tribal culture into democratic 
     political culture.  (FY O2 MEPI funds have funded the 
     first-phase of this project via the National Democratic 
     Institute (NDI) through March 04.) 
     -- Parliamentary strengthening program to build the 
     institutional capacity and increase the ability of 
     parliament to act as an independent entity through 
     training new members, fostering communication between 
     democratic institutions and improving constituency 
     relations 
     -- Political party strengthening program to consolidate 
     party representation of citizens and strong multi-party 
     competition 
     -- Women in politics program to improve the skills and 
     knowledge of women office holders and increase the 
     number and efficacy of future women candidates for 
     public office as a complement and follow-on program to 
     the regional campaign training schools program that 
     began in November 2002 and ongoing NDI programming. 
 
2.   Encouraging Decentralization: 
 
    -- Pilot decentralization projects in selected 
    governorates to train and equip local councils to 
    manage resources and provide services to constituents 
    -- Pilot decentralization projects in selected 
    governorates to train and equip local offices of ROYG 
    Ministries to engage effectively with local councils 
    and citizens to plan and implement sectoral programs 
 
3.   Developing the NGO sector and Civil Society: 
 
    -- Enable the NGO sector and civil society to 
    effectively participate in community and human rights 
    development through training interventions and 
    establishing an NGO support center 
 
Expected Results: 
     -- Increased numbers of local councils that represent 
     citizens effectively, obtain and allocate resources 
     wisely, provide needed services to the community, 
     integrate tribal culture and offer avenues for women 
     and other disadvantaged groups to participate in 
     democratic life 
     -- Increased number of times Parliament challenges 
     government initiatives or amends legislation 
     -- Increased number of Members of Parliament (MPs) who 
     represent constituents effectively 
     -- Increased use of strategic planning and internal 
     democratic processes by political parties 
     -- Increased party membership base representing 
     citizens across Yemen 
     -- Increased multi-party competition resulting in a 
     more balanced political spectrum 
     -- Increased numbers of women in elected office 
     -- Increased numbers of elected women and men with the 
     ability to advocate effectively on issues 
     -- Increased efficacy and number of NGOs that 
     effectively advocate on behalf of citizens 
     -- Increased number of district and governorate offices 
     of ROYG Ministries that engage substantively with local 
     councils and citizens in program planning and resource 
     allocation 
2.  Improving Electoral Processes 
 
Problem: The April 2003 parliamentary elections marked an 
improvement in Yemen\'s electoral process, but significant 
flaws show that much more work is needed to build confidence 
in the electoral process.  With local council and 
presidential elections scheduled for 2006, problems with the 
voter registry (caused by a lack of civil registry 
documenting citizens accurately that allowed significant 
underage voting), election administration, political party 
fraud, and citizen confidence in the election must be 
addressed. 
 
MEPI Strategy: 
To improve the electoral process, Embassy Sanaa seeks 
support for the following long-term programs: 
 
     -- Continue to assist to the Supreme Committee for 
     Elections and Referenda (SCER) to professionalize its 
     operations and to administer the 2006 elections in an 
     effective, independent and confidence-building manner 
     -- Assist the ROYG and SCER to develop a modern, cost- 
     effective, accurate and comprehensive civil registry 
     -- Support and train Yemeni civil society groups to 
     monitor the elections to help ensure confidence in the 
     election and to foster political party confidence in 
     the SCER and election administration 
 
Expected Results: 
 
     -- Increased professionalism in the SCER resulting in 
     effective management of and confidence in the electoral 
     process 
     -- The first-ever civil registry in Yemen and 
     government identification cards for all Yemenis 
     -- Improved accuracy in voter registration and other 
     benefits, including citizen access to basic services 
     and more effective counter-terrorism measures 
     -- Increased confidence in election results through 
     monitoring and effective adjudication of citizen, NGO 
     and political party concerns 
 
3.  Reforming the Judiciary 
 
Problem: Yemen\'s judicial system needs comprehensive reform, 
including reconciling differing pre-unification laws, de- 
politicizing judges, strengthening the application and 
implementation of law, training more effective and fair 
judges, and effectively responding to human rights concerns. 
The absence of effective rule of law affects all aspects of 
Yemeni society negatively, including undermining the 
stability of land tenure, fostering a reliance on tribal 
adjudication outside the political system, and negative 
impacts on expanded trade and investment. 
 
MEPI Strategy: 
 
Participate in the MidEast Regional Judicial Reform program 
and design effective follow-up programming within the Yemeni 
judicial system by training judges, assisting in the reform 
and effective implementation of key laws, and encouraging 
the non-politicization of judges. 
 
Expected Results: 
 
     -- Improved information sharing of best practices in 
     judicial reform across the region 
     -- Increased number of judges that are impartial and 
     give fair judgments 
     -- Increased number of needed laws that are implemented 
     effectively 
     -- Increased confidence and transparency in the 
     judicial system, lessening the reliance on traditional 
     tribal justice 
 
4.  Increasing the Professionalism of Media Organizations 
and Journalists 
 
Problem:  While Yemen has a fairly active government and 
opposition written press compared to other countries in the 
Middle East, it suffers from ruling-party dominated 
broadcast media, government oppression of journalists, and a 
lack of professional journalists trained in investigative 
and factual reporting. 
 
MEPI Strategy: 
 
To increase the professionalism of media organizations and 
journalists, Embassy Sanaa seeks funding to establish a 
Media Training Center to: 
     -- Provide working journalists with best practices and 
     methods of journalism, including investigative and 
     factual reporting 
     -- Offer training and support to foster a more 
     effective media sector 
     -- Work to reduce government oppression of the media 
 
Expected Results: 
     -- Increased professionalism of journalists resulting 
     in more effective reporting and decreased oppression of 
     journalists 
 
--------------- 
Economic Growth 
------------------ 
 
One of the 25 poorest and least developed countries in the 
world, Yemen\'s real GDP per capita is approximately US$300. 
According to the World Bank, GDP growth for 2002 was 2.9 %, 
which does not match population growth of 3.5% a year. 
Unemployment is estimated to be 25-35%, and oil resources, 
which account for one third of the gross national product 
and 70% of government revenues, are expected to decline 
significantly during the next decade.  Despite these 
negative indicators, many international donors praised 
Yemen\'s fiscal policy and progress in economic reform 
throughout the last five years. 
 
MEPI goals encouraging foreign direct investment and 
developing revenue and employment growth will help diversify 
and strengthen the Yemeni economy by providing jobs, 
expanding the economic base, and, in the long term, lessen 
Yemen\'s dependence on oil.  Corresponding to its MPP 
Economic Growth and Development goal, the Embassy Sanaa 
strategy for MEPI economic reform support has three goals: 
1) Increasing trade and investment; 2) Expanding employment 
and business opportunities at the local level; and, 3) 
Enhancing policy reform and program development. 
 
1.  Increasing Trade and Investment 
 
Problem: Yemen is considered by the World Bank to be among 
the most open and trade liberalized countries in the MENA 
region. However, oil exports represented more than 95 
percent of total merchandise exports in 2000. Of the 
remaining 5 percent, products such as fish, coffee, fruits, 
and vegetables are low value added. This fact made economic 
growth in Yemen vulnerable to volatility in price and 
demand. 
 
Obstacles constraining the growth potential and development 
of export-potential sectors are: 
 
     -- Weak institutional and organizational structures 
     that fail to uphold competition and prevent monopoly, 
     ensure good quality products and protect intellectual 
     property rights 
     -- Limited infrastructure necessary to enhance 
     exporting activities 
     -- Limited-quality economic, population and trade data 
     -- Limited information about markets and demand for 
     products 
     -- Informal activities that dominate the private sector 
     -- Lack of technical know-how, product quality and 
     trade experience resulting in the inability to meet 
     international standards 
 
Similar constraints also restrict the ability of Yemeni 
producers to contribute to internal economic growth and 
employment creation by exporting their products to markets 
within Yemen. 
 
Foreign investors are discouraged from investing in Yemen 
because the commercial legal system is ill-equipped to 
adjudicate disputes. Judges are often unfamiliar with 
commercial law, and since unification, conflicting laws 
remain on the books.  Courts are burdened with large 
caseloads and, often, a case may take years to be heard and 
then stagnates in the appellate process.   If a commercial 
ruling is won, it is rarely enforced.  Without a clear land- 
titling system, limited ability to collateralize against 
property, and courts\' reluctance to enforce default 
judgments against property collateral, domestic investors 
are also reluctant to invest their money into new 
businesses. 
 
MEPI Strategy: 
 
The MEPI strategy for trade assistance will work to enhance 
the export climate and to reform commercial law to establish 
the appropriate export and investment environment in Yemen. 
MEPI goals will be coordinated with and assist in Yemen\'s 
active participation in the proposed U.S.-Middle East Free 
Trade Area.  Embassy Sanaa will also integrate commercial 
law reform with the MidEast Regional Judicial Reform Program 
and subsequent follow-up activities. Embassy Sanaa seeks 
MEPI funding to: 
 
1. Enhance the Export Climate 
     -- Identify trade opportunities.  Targeted research in 
     selected sectors will identify opportunities to expand 
     exports and increase investment in new businesses 
     -- Develop the country\'s overall export potential 
     through an improved legal, regulatory, and 
     institutional environment for international trade 
     -- Improve the quality of data needed for expanded 
     trade and investment 
     -- Provide exporters with the training and technical 
     expertise required to meet international standards 
     -- Support selected elements of the WTO Integrated 
     Framework 
     -- Increase economic growth and jobs 
 
2.  Reform Commercial law 
 
     -- Train judges and lawyers in commercial law 
     -- Embark on a program to deconflict old laws remaining 
     on the books since unification 
     -- Expand existing alternative dispute resolution 
     mechanisms to lessen reliance on the over burdened 
     court system 
     -- Develop programs to train ROYG courts to enforce 
     commercial rulings 
     -- Identify participants for the Mideast Regional 
     Judicial Reform Program 
 
Expected Results: 
 
Export Climate: 
 
     -- New trade opportunities identified 
     -- Expanded investment in export sectors 
     -- Improved legal and regulatory environment 
     -- Increased international, regional and internal 
     trade; Enhanced trade links between Yemen and regional 
     trading partners 
     -- Level of non-oil exports increased 
     -- Improved quality and transparency in commercial and 
     population data 
     -- Selected elements of the WTO Integrated Framework 
     supported 
     -- Increased economic growth and jobs at the sub- 
     regional level through increased trade within Yemen 
 
Commercial law: 
 
     -- Increased numbers of judges and lawyers with 
     appropriate commercial training 
     -- Expanded use of alternative dispute resolution, if 
     proven more effective, for commercial cases 
     -- Evidence of enforcement of commercial dispute 
     decisions 
 
2.  Expanding employment and business opportunities at the 
local level 
 
Problem: With unequal access to government, credit and 
markets, the growth in number, size, and productivity of 
small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) stagnated over the 
last decade. Because SMEs comprise 96 percent of the private 
sector, their lack of growth is stalling the Yemen economy 
and helping to increase the poverty level. 
 
The underserved governorates of Marib, Al-Jawf, Shabwa, 
Saada, and Amran, in particular, have vast, unrealized 
potential in the agriculture, mining, and light 
manufacturing sectors. Enterprises cannot take advantage of 
these resources and potential because they lack financial, 
business, and marketing services and know-how. Virtually no 
opportunities exist for entrepreneurs to access capital, to 
expand or start enterprises or to receive business 
development support (e.g. marketing, business planning). 
 
MEPI Strategy: 
 
The focus will be placed on providing small and medium-sized 
enterprises with greater and reliable access to sustainable 
financial and business services:  1) Enhance microfinance 
and SME finance institutional development; 2) create SME 
business development services; and, 3) Expand SME 
association development. This program element will pay 
particular attention to expanded business and employment 
opportunities for women. 
 
1. Enhance Microfinance and SME Finance Institutional 
Development 
 
     -- Create and enhance institutional entities that are 
     able to offer finance to small lenders in Marib, Al- 
     Jawf, Shabwa, Amran, and Saada Governorates 
2. Create SME Business Development Services (BDS) 
     -- Develop access to non-financial services for micro 
     and small entrepreneurs to receive training and 
     technical assistance, technology transfer, product and 
     services marketing assistance, general management 
     assistance, and business mentoring 
 
3. Expand SME Association Development 
 
     -- Develop associations that integrate producers, 
     processors and vendors into a single organization 
     focused on developing different sub-sectors and 
     enhancing the prospects of economic success 
 
Expected Results: 
 
     -- SME finance providers developed and offering 
     services in the five target governorates 
     -- SME finance providers reach sustainability (meeting 
     100% of their operational and financial costs) and 
     offer services to capable SMEs 
     -- Technical assistance and training programs for SMEs 
     developed 
     -- Business development services available for specific 
     SME sectors, such as agriculture, food processing, 
     transport, handicraft and tourism, mining, and light 
     manufacturing 
     -- Increase in business linkages between SMEs and 
     economic drivers 
     -- Associations developed, coordinating and networking 
     -- New business opportunities identified 
     -- Increase in income and employment generating- 
     activities 
 
3. Enhancing Policy Reform and Program Development 
 
Problem: Economic development in Yemen is constrained by 
limited institutional support by the ROYG and the private 
sector. 
 
MEPI Strategy: 
 
To enhance the Republic of Yemen\'s policy reform and program 
development, Embassy Sanaa will seek funding to: 
 
     -- Expand and improve the higher education and research 
     institute systems\' to support economic growth in trade, 
     investment and SMEs 
     -- Expand the ability of the ROYG Ministry of Industry 
     and Trade to produce and share business abstracts and 
     reports 
     -- Develop comprehensive district and governorate 
     economic and development growth plans 
     -- Establish economic development offices and/or 
     authorities at the local level 
     -- Expand business education and training in high 
     schools, community colleges and universities 
     -- Establish public/private sector fora to identify 
     obstacles to expanded business and employment 
     opportunities 
 
Expected Results: 
 
     -- Increased access to information 
     -- Improved laws, regulations and policies 
     -- Economic growth integrated into local level planning 
     -- Increased numbers of Yemenis with business-related 
     skills 
     -- Improved partnerships between the public and private 
     sector

TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, PINR, YM, HUMAN RIGHTS 
SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND MINISTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS:  LET\'S 
WORK TOGETHER 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  Summary:  The Ambassador called on the newly-appointed 
Minister of Human Rights Amat al-Alim al-Suswa on June 30. 
In a cordial meeting, they discussed the state of human 
rights in Yemen, the 2002 Human Rights Report, developments 
in the new Ministry and specific human rights issues, 
including women, prisons, security forces and the media. 
They also explored areas of closer cooperation, including 
increasing potential USG assistance such as community 
policing and media training.  The Ambassador offered to see 
if A/S Craner might be available to meet with al-Suswa during 
her planned visit to Washington for Yemen Days September 5-6 
(see paragraph 12).  Acting Pol/Econ Chief and A/PAO also 
attended.  See biographic note in paragraph 11.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
General Environment for Human Rights; 
New Ministry of Human Rights 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  The Ambassador and Minister agreed that human rights 
remains a difficult issue in Yemen that must be addressed on 
all fronts.  At the same time, they agreed that, unlike in 
some other Middle Eastern countries, the environment of 
openness and a higher level of freedom in Yemen offers 
opportunities to make great progress in improving human 
rights.  The Minister said there is great willingness to 
admit to problems, but often the capacity to address them was 
hindered by economic, social and sometimes bureaucratic 
constraints. 
 
3.  (U)  In the government formed in May 2003, the previous 
structure of a Minister of State for Human Rights 
coordinating the work of an inter-agency committee was 
improved to the status of a full Ministry of Human Rights. 
The Minister said she has a lot of work to do and asked for 
patience while she works to improve the capacity of the new 
ministry to undertake work, particularly in the areas of 
staff development and addressing specific complaints. 
 
------------------------- 
Human Rights Report (HRR) 
------------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  The Ambassador encouraged the Minister to increase 
the dialogue between the Embassy and the Ministry on human 
rights in general and the HRR specifically.  He urged the 
Minister to work with other ministries to bring old cases to 
resolution.  The Minister agreed, citing the issue of the 
disappeared from the 1986 and 1994 conflicts.  She said the 
families of the disappeared had come to informal agreement 
with the ROYG to resolve the issue, but that it should be 
resolved in an official manner. 
 
5.  (U)  The Minister indicated that the ROYG felt that the 
HRR was \"important input\" in improving their human rights 
situation.  The ROYG plans to issue an official government 
response to the 2002 HRR as it did in 2001, which would be 
published and discussed widely.  She said the inter-agency 
process was ongoing to formulate the response.  The 
Ambassador said the 2001 response was appreciated for its 
evidence of Yemen taking the HRR seriously and that it was 
taken into account as the 2002 HRR was drafted.  He added 
that dialogue on the report should be continual and frequent 
as well. 
 
6.  (U)  The Minister said that the ROYG was planning to 
develop a report on the U.S. treatment of Yemenis and 
Yemeni-Americans, citing ill-treatment in the aftermath of 
9/11 including Guantanamo detainees and arrests in the U.S. 
The Ambassador said the U.S. has a sincere desire to protect 
people\'s rights and that we should continue to discuss the 
issue. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Issues:  Women, Prisons, Security Services, Media 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
7.  (U)  The Ambassador brought up the status of women as one 
of the key concerns about human rights in Yemen.  The 
Minister agreed, noting it as one of her main interests.  She 
said it is a \"huge, complex and difficult\" issue because of 
Yemeni traditional society.  She noted that the ROYG cabinet 
plans to endorse a Strategy for Women.  She used the horrible 
treatment of women in prisons as an example of the extreme 
situation.  She said that while progress has been made on 
their conditions with the change to more female guards and 
higher political attention, the societal view that leaves a 
stigma where families refuse to take back women prisoners 
remains a huge hurdle. 
 
8.  (U)  The Ambassador noted improvements in the treatment 
of citizens by security services while stressing that much 
more needs to be done.  The Minister agreed that the 
ignorance by which some police and security services treat 
citizens needs to be comprehensively addressed.  The 
Ambassador described the concept of community policing in the 
United States and said it might be one way to address the 
issue.  He offered to work with the Minister and the Minister 
of the Interior to explore such programs that could possibly 
be assisted by the USG. 
 
9.  (U)  As a former journalist, the Minister agreed with the 
Ambassador that the media situation could be improved.  While 
much press freedom is allowed, journalists still often censor 
themselves for fear of government reprisal.  They agreed that 
journalists need to be more professional as well, and the 
Ambassador offered potential USG assistance in this regard 
via training and visitor programs. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C)  The previous Minister of State for Human Rights, 
Waheeba Fara\'a, offered promise when she was appointed the 
first woman ROYG minister, but that promise was never 
realized to full potential.  This new appointment of a 
dynamic and energetic Minister, who appears to intend to 
accomplish concrete progress rather than rhetoric and who is 
well-regarded by internationals and ROYG officials alike, 
offers greater promise for Yemen to improve its human rights 
record.  The Embassy intends to explore concrete ways to 
assist in addition to ongoing programs, including improving 
community policing and training the media.  End Comment.

1.  (C)  Summary:  The Ambassador called on Foreign Minister 
Qirbi July 2 upon the FM\'s return from Germany and France. 
He urged increased assistance to the Palestinian Authority 
per reftel A.  They discussed the al-Moayed case, current 
Coast Guard training in Aden, the impressive role of the 
U.S.-trained Central Security Forces (CSF) in the Abyan 
operation (ref B) and other topics.  The Ambassador also met 
with Qirbi one-on-one to discuss terrorist financing 
(septel).  A/DCM and Acting Pol/Econ Chief accompanied the 
Ambassador.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Middle East Peace Negotiations:  Secretary\'s Message 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2.  (C)  Ambassador delivered Secretary\'s message in reftel 
A.  He also highlighted the encouraging progress recently and 
the ongoing U.S. high-level engagement.  Qirbi responded that 
there was a dispute between the ROYG and the Arab League 
regarding Yemen\'s assessment.  Before unification in 1990, 
North Yemen and South Yemen each contributed 1% of the Arab 
League budget, for a total of 2%.  After 1990, the ROYG 
maintained that its proper assessment is still 1% while the 
Arab League maintains 2%.  Assistance to Palestine is based 
on the Arab League assessment.  Hence, the ROYG feels it has 
fully paid while the Arab League considers it only 50% paid. 
The Ambassador said that this was not a usual time in the 
peace process, progress was becoming possible and the ROYG 
should increase its contribution regardless of any dispute. 
 
3.  (C)  The Ambassador cautioned Qirbi on contributions to 
Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups, noting that the 
ROYG needs to make sure that contributions, both official and 
non-official, go to the right place.  Ambassador said that 
contributions are vitally needed to buttress Abu Mazen and 
other legitimate charity groups such as the Red Crescent 
Society.  Qirbi said it was a contentious issue, saying that 
Hamas had recently showed flexibility and \"we need to exert 
pressure\" on them to support Abu Mazen.  He referenced a 
British House of Commons report that claimed that 80-90% of 
Hamas funding was used for legitimate charity.  Qirbi said 
the impetus should be on how to influence its military wing 
to stop attacks. 
 
4.  (C)  Qirbi noted that Yemen has established a committee 
to handle official and public contributions for the 
Palestinians, headed by Deputy Prime Minister (and 
MinFinance) al-Salami and composed of NGO representatives and 
ROYG officials.  This committee has already changed emphasis 
to increased aid to the PA, therefore reducing contributions 
to Hamas.  The Ambassador said he would discuss this issue 
with the Deputy PM and encouraged the ROYG to study further 
efforts to give Abu Mazen the strongest possible hand. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
President Saleh\'s visit to Germany -- al-Moayed 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.  (C)  The Ambassador and FM discussed the upcoming 
resolution to the al-Moayed case in Germany, including the 
timing of extradition and the potential appeals process.  The 
Ambassador noted that we need to work together on managing 
public sentiment at extradition, particularly regarding 
security issues.  Qirbi agreed that the \"security, public 
responses and political impact\" should be discussed and 
managed.  Qirbi said he did not know if an appeals process 
was beneficial or not, but noted that delaying the 
extradition would \"give us a chance to work out a mechanism\" 
by which al-Moayed can cooperate and give information.  He 
said that Yemen needs to be convinced of his culpability, and 
wondered if the Yemeni people would accept the situation 
otherwise if the case was not made. 
 
---------------------------- 
Coast Guard Training in Aden; 
Central Security Forces (CSF) 
---------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  The Ambassador informed Qirbi about the Coast Guard 
training in Aden, noting its importance as part of ongoing CT 
cooperation.  He also congratulated Qirbi on the performance 
of the U.S.-trained CSF forces in the Abyan operation (ref B) 
and the visit by CSF commander to Tampa and Washington in 
August. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Other Issues:  U/S Bolton Visit; Car Exemptions; 
Ambassador\'s Washington Consultations 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7.  (C)  The Ambassador thanked Qirbi for meeting with 
UnderSecretary Bolton June 17 (ref C).  He said it was a 
productive visit, particularly the discussions on Article 98 
and the DPRK.  Qirbi expressed appreciation when the 
Ambassador informed him of the recent release of humanitarian 
demining funds as a tangible result of the UnderSecretary\'s 
visit.  A/DCM mentioned that he was working the issue of car 
exemptions with the MFA head of protocol, where several 
armored and regular vehicles were being held up in 
bureaucratic delays.  Qirbi indicated that he expected the 
issue to be expedited.  The Ambassador briefed Qirbi on his 
recent Washington consultations.  He told Qirbi that he 
discussed his idea of a strategic dialogue with Washington 
officials, and that the suggestion was to focus on a 
substantive agenda. The Ambassador suggested two important 
topics, arms flows and money flows, and suggested they 
discuss it further.

Ministry\'s predictions that oil output could decline as much 
as one third by 2010.  Nevertheless, even with Yemen\'s oil

Yemen, told Pol/econoff on June 25th that there were several 
rumors that Canadian Nexen has discovered a huge oil field, 
perhaps in the billions of barrels of oil. Al-Iryani cited as 
evidence two news stories on Al-Jazeera and in the daily 
newspaper Al-Ayyam announcing new finds in Canadian Nexen\'s 
Block 14 in the Hadramawt governorate. (Note: According to 
the Petroleum Exploration and Production Authority, Yemen\'s 
proven oil reserves are just over 4 billion barrels. End 
Note.) Canadian Nexen officials are reluctant to comment on 
the find, but have confirmed to Embassy officials that there 
have been new discoveries. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Ministry of Oil and Minerals Sanguine about Future 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (U) In an earlier courtesy call with Nabil al-Gawsi on 
June 10, Chairman of the Petroleum Exploration and Production 
Authority (PEPA) of the Ministry of Oil and Minerals, 
al-Gawsi expressed optimism that present high production 
rates of 450,000 barrels a day could be maintained, possibly 
slipping slightly to 400,000 barrels per day in the future. 
When asked to respond to most experts\' prediction that oil 
production  will decline significantly in the next ten years, 
 Al-Gawsi countered that he believed there was still a great 
deal of oil to be found. He confirmed that Canadian Nexen had 
found oil in concession area 14, near in Hadramawt. Al-Gawsi 
did not comment on the size of the discovery.  (Note: The 
Ministry of Oil has publicly estimated in 2001 that by 2010 
production would drop to 1/3 of today\'s levels, around 
145,000 barrels a day. End Note.) Al-Gawsi also promoted 
recently opened oil concessions along the border with Saudi 
Arabia, which have recently opened for exploration after the 
conclusion of the 2000 border agreement with Saudi Arabia. 
 
5. (U) Expressing some frustration with Hunt Oil, al-Gawsi 
said that there was likely more oil in Hunt\'s concession near 
Marib than Hunt would extract. The concession might be opened 
to other companies if Hunt leaves after their PSA expires in 
2005. Closing by promising a bright future for oil in Yemen, 
al-Gawsi said only 3% of all the oil concessions have been 
explored, and was positive there were still more reserves to 
be discovered. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
New Finds Aside, 
Oil Not the Solution to Yemen\'s Economic Woes 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5.  (C) Comment: The rumored oil find explains the optimism 
of al-Gawsi and his coworkers at PEPA and will likely delay 
the ROYG\'s having to compensate for revenue losses due to 
diminished oil production. The rumored size of the find is 
undoubtedly exaggerated. Most likely, al-Gawsi is more on 
target with his expectation that new finds will maintain 
current oil production levels. While new oil finds are good 
news for government revenue, oil is not a panacea for the 
ROYG economy. Last year\'s high oil prices and record oil 
production levels only accounted for 2.9% GDP growth (World 
Bank Statistic) for Yemen in 2002, which did not match the 
ROYG\'s published population growth estimate of 3.5%.  Keeping 
in mind that oil prices are expected to fall next year, 
simply maintaining current production levels will translate 
into even slower GDP growth, and most likely a budget deficit 
for the ROYG in 2004.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: YEMEN: LATEST WEAPONS BUYBACK CACHE 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (c) and (d) 
 
1.  (S/NF)  During a July 1 telcon, President Saleh informed 
Ambassador that Yemen is actively engaged in 
non-proliferation efforts and instructed Brigadier General 
Ali Shater to coordinate a viewing of ROYG proceeds from the 
past few months of weapons buyback collection efforts. 
Shater later invited Ambassador Hull, accompanied by a team 
of USG experts of his choosing (namely FBI, DAO, CIA, etc.) 
to visit the Yemeni Special Forces Camp on the morning of 
July 2nd. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Upon entering the hanger, the Embassy team, 
comprised of the Amb, DATT, ORCA, and POL, observed that the 
items displayed were different than those seen in late 
January 2003.  The ordinance, on the whole, was older and 
included items not previously displayed, including: 
 
--  SAM-18s 
--  Strella 2 
--  Strella 3 
--  AT-7 
--  RPGs 
--  plastique 
--  blasting caps 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Although expected, Brigadier General Ali Shater 
was not present.  The overview and tour was given by General 
Yahya Abdullah.  Ambassador noted that it is important to 
continue these collection efforts, especially in light of 
recent events in Abyan and Riyadh.  When asked about the 
disposition of the previous buyback proceeds, Abdullah said 
that useable ordinance was incorporated into Ministry of 
Defense stockpiles, while surplus items were destroyed. 
Abdullah agreed to allow Post to view the destruction in the 
future, which would be more systematic, noting that in the 
past ROYG destruction efforts had been piecemeal. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Ambassador said that the USG would like to have a 
DIA team visit Yemen to assist ROYG to inventory past and 
future collection efforts.  (Comment: This offer was 
previously rejected by Brigadier General Shater in April 
2003.  End comment.)  While Abdullah and the other working 
level officials agreed in principle, they referred the final 
decision to the Minister of Defense.  General Abdullah said 
that pending legislation would outlaw the trade in heavy 
weapons and institute controls on the trade of light 
weaponry, like Kalashnikovs.  He said ROYG will push hard to 
get this legislation adopted, but in the interim ROYG is 
actively engaged in working within tribal laws to collect as 
many weapons as possible.  Referring to U.S. cooperation with 
the U.S. Coast Guard and the Yemeni Special Forces, Abdullah 
noted that the Yemen military appreciates this ongoing 
cooperation and wants to expand it to include the weapons 
buyback program. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Ossama Al-Shami of Presidential Protocol called 
Post on the afternoon of July 2 to request a meeting between 
Brigadier General Shater and the Ambassador.  The meeting has 
been scheduled for July 6th. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  Begin comment: ROYG had multiple TV cameras and 
photographers covering the Ambassador\'s 7/2 walk-through of 
the YSOF facility, and the efforts of his team to collect 
data on the items recovered.  ROYG will use this event to 
showcase their ongoing arm control efforts, and to ensure 
their neighbors, especially Saudi Arabia, and the 
international community that Yemen is committed to combating 
weapons smuggling and terror.  End comment.

1. (C)  Deputy Minister of Finance Ahmed Ghaleb and External 
Relations Director Ibrahim al-Nahari told Pol/econoff on July 
7 that there were no/no Iraqi government assets in Yemen in 
response to reftel demarche.  Al-Nahari explained that the 
only Iraqi Government assets in Yemen were several cargo 
boats moored in Aden harbor during the 1991 Gulf War. 
However, al-Nahari said that these boats became a liability 
to the people of Yemen, and a Yemeni court case awarded 8 
million USD from Iraq  to the ROYG to compensate for their 
upkeep. Having gained possession through the court case, the 
ROYG sold the boats to Jordan at a two million dollar loss. 
Therefore, the ROYG believes that the Iraqis owe the people 
of Yemen the two million dollars. 
 
2. (SN/F) Turning to non-government Iraqi assets, Al-Nahari 
stated that the one Iraqi owned bank in Yemen, the Raffadin 
bank, only holds private citizens\' funds. Referring to U/S 
Taylor\'s April 1 call to Central Bank Sub-Governor for 
Control Mr. Abdullah Ulafi, al-Nahari said that the ROYG had 
already told the Treasury Department that only private funds 
are held at the Raffadin bank. Ghaleb added that he believed 
that Raffadin only holds about 20 million Riyals (about 
110,00 USD at the 07/09/03 exchange rate) in its reserves. 
 
3. (U)  Al-Nahari said that an official response would be

1. (U) Deputy Minister of Finance Ahmed Ghaleb confirmed to 
Pol/econoff on July 9 that the ROYG had placed fifty million 
USD in an escrow account at HSBC in accordance with the 
January agreement with Lloyds\' to lower transshipment 
insurance rates for Yemen (Reftel A). However, Ghaleb added, 
the insurance rates have not yet been lowered because the 
underwriters still are not satisfied with some of the 
technical details of the escrow account. 
 
2. (C) Comment: Embassy worked directly and with the donor 
community to put pressure on the ROYG to fulfill its terms of 
the deal. That, along with a June 10 Financial Times article 
criticizing the ROYG\'s handling of the matter, finally moved 
the ROYG to fulfill the terms of the agreement.  While this 
is a positive step for the shipping industry, as Reftel A 
points out, HSBC was originally not on the approved list of 
banks by Lloyds. The choice of HSBC by the ROYG suggests that 
continued political maneuvering may still be negatively 
affecting the return of shipping to Aden. End Comment.

President Saleh, held a 7/2 viewing of ROYG proceeds from 
recent weapons buyback collection efforts for the Ambassador 
and other USG officials (reftel).  On July 6, Shater met with 
the Ambassador to ascertain the U.S. reaction to the display 
and to discuss ROYG\'s ongoing arms control strategies, 
including the weapons buyback program.  Also in attendance 
were DATT, PolOff (notetaker), and Ossami al-Shami from 
Presidential Protocol.  (Comment:  Al-Shami\'s presence 
indicates the President\'s personal oversight of this recent 
exchange.  End comment.) 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Ambassador said that initiatives like the weapons 
buyback program are extremely important because of reports 
indicating that arms and munitions from Yemen were used in 
the Riyadh attacks.  However, citing similar buyback 
programs\' creation of secondary markets, the Ambassador 
stressed that the U.S. will not attempt to purchase billions 
of dollars of weapons worldwide --  but the U.S. will help 
with technical assistance. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Ambassador reiterated the April and 7/2 offer of 
assistance (reftel) in the form of a DIA team.  This team 
would consist of specialists capable of helping ROYG 
catalogue current stockpiles and future acquisitions.  This 
data could then be incorporated into a database that would 
allow both ROYG and the U.S. to ascertain the origins of 
weapons purchased through the weapons buyback program, seized

 Depending upon the findings and recommendations of the DIA 
Team, this may include the acquisition and installation of

shows ROYG\'s commitment to controlling the illicit arms trade 
and the President\'s desire to secure external funding to 
expand ongoing efforts.  The continued removal of weapons

YEMEN 
 
REF: STATE 128494 
 
1.  THE FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY\'S YEAR 2003 INVESTMENT CLIMATE 
STATEMENT FOR YEMEN. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT OF INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT: 
 
 
A. 1.  Openness to Foreign Investment 
 
The Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) is committed to 
attracting foreign investors by improving its overall 
investment climate.  To this end, it adopted a new policy of 
uniform treatment for all investors, domestic and foreign. 
The lead ROYG agency is the General Investment Authority 
(GIA), established in March 1992, which has worked with the 
World Bank\'s Foreign Investment Advisory service to update 
Yemen\'s Investment law 22 of 1991 (as amended).  The 
alternative Investment Law number 22 of 2002 was adopted by 
parliament on June 2002 and signed by the president on July 
20, 2002.  However, to date the law has not been 
implemented.  Once implemented the new law will safeguard 
all exemptions and benefits called for in the previous 
investment law and shift the focus of the GIA from 
regulation to registration and promotion.  The new law will 
eliminate intervention of the GIA and other government 
agencies in investment projects and gives wider freedom to 
investors in running their projects. The new law will cancel 
some legal provisions, which provided special exceptions for 
investors from obtaining import and export licenses from the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade and also from paying relevant 
stamp duties.   The new law will encourage local production 
by reducing customs duties by 50 percent on imported raw 
materials and 100 percent on raw materials produced locally 
for agricultural and fisheries projects.  Finally, the new 
law will cancel some tax categories.  The new investment law 
falls under the government\'s financial, economic and 
administrative reform program, intended to encourage foreign 
investment. 
 
Under the new law 22 of 2002, the primary role of the GIA is 
limited to registration and promotion of investment 
opportunities.  The GIA provides potential investors with an 
information packet that includes a copy of the investment 
law, an investment guide summarizing GIA activities, and an 
application form with instructions.  Packets may be obtained 
from the promotion section, General Investment Authority, 
P.O. Box 19022, Sanaa, Republic of Yemen (Phone:  967-1-262- 
962/3 or 268-205; Fax:  967-1-262-964, E-mails: 
mohdhussein@yahoo.com; website is:  www.giay.org. 
 
The GIA welcomes investment in all projects with the 
exception of arms and explosive materials, industries that 
could cause environmental disasters, banking and money 
exchange activities, and wholesale and retail imports. 
Investments in the exploration and production of oil, gas 
and minerals are subject to special agreements (e.g., 
production sharing agreements) under the authority of the 
ministry of oil and mineral resources and do not fall within 
the purview of the GIA.  Investment is open to Yemeni, Arab, 
or foreign investors acting solely or in partnership on any 
project. 
 
The investment law revision is part of a large ROYG economic 
restructuring program, sponsored by the IMF and World Bank, 
begun in 1995.  The broad objectives of the program have 
been to stabilize the economy and stimulate sustainable 
growth.  By and large, it has been successful, and the ROYG 
will negotiate with the IMF after the April 2003 election 
for a new three-year poverty reduction and growth facility 
(PRGF) for 2003-2005.  Macroeconomic stabilization has been 
achieved with the Yemeni rial stable and floating at market 
rates at the range of (1 USD equaled approximately 174 YR 
until October 2002; and 183 YR from October 2002-July 2003. 
Inflation (as measured by the CPI) declined from 71 percent 
in 1994 to 11. 8 percent in 2003, and foreign currency 
reserves now reached USD 4.7 billion, or 17.6 months of 
imports.  Most bilateral debt has been rescheduled under the 
Paris Club and commercial debt has largely been eliminated 
through a World Bank grant program.  External debt is now 
about 48.7 percent of GDP as at March 2003. 
 
Under the international financial institutions\' reform 
programs, Yemen\'s trade environment has also improved, and 
basic elements of a social safety net have been implemented. 
A simplified and less protective tariff structure has been 
initiated with the elimination of nearly all import bans, 
export restrictions, and import licensing, and the adoption 
of a unified tariff.  Under the new (investment) law 22 of 
2002, duties applied on raw materials not available locally 
will be exempted by 50 percent.  There will also be a full 
exemption on imported materials included in agricultural and 
fisheries projects.  Also as instructed by the president, 
there should be a 100 percent exemption on lands in the 
southern and eastern provinces if the project cost, 
excluding land, is more than ten million dollars.  A 
privatization program, begun in 1998 with sixteen 
enterprises in industry, tourism, and trade, came to a 
standstill in April 2001 when parliament refused to approve 
a World Bank credit to fund a larger, long-term 
privatization program.  Financial sector reform has advanced 
with passage of a new law granting full independence to the 
Central Bank.  Commercial banks have also been required to 
improve their accounting procedures and loan recovery rates. 
That said, the bank system remains weak, with most 
commercial banks owned by families who have very low 
capitalization rates. 
 
A.2. Conversion and Transfer Policies 
 
The Yemeni rial is freely convertible at market rates.  It 
has been stable at the 176-177YR/1USD range through October 
2002.  The rial went down to 182-183YR/1USD through the end 
of the year, due partially to the impact of the attack on 
the oil tanker M/V Limburg off the coast of Yemen.  All 
other foreign currencies, especially U.S. dollars, are 
readily available and trade freely at market rates.  Under 
Investment Law 22, investors may transfer funds in hard 
currency from abroad to Yemen for the purpose of investment 
and may re-export invested capital, whether in kind or in 
cash, upon liquidation or project disposal.  Net profits 
resulting from investment of foreign funds may be 
transferred freely outside of Yemen. 
 
A.3. Expropriation and Compensation 
 
Yemen\'s investment law stipulates that projects will not be 
nationalized or seized.  Moreover, the funds will not be 
blocked, confiscated, frozen, withheld or sequestered by 
other than a court of law.  Likewise, real estate may not be 
expropriated except in the national interest, according to 
the law and a court judgment, and against fair compensation 
based on its market price on the issuance date of the court 
judgment.  Such compensation may be freely transferred 
abroad. 
 
Since Yemen\'s unification in 1990, there have been no cases 
of property expropriation.  The ROYG recognizes that 
expropriation (which existed in the socialist-led Peoples\' 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, the former South Yemen, until 
1990) is contrary to its economic reform aspirations.  Much 
of the expropriated lands in the southern and eastern 
provinces have been returned to the rightful owners.  Land 
registration, however, is in its infancy in Yemen, and 
disputes over both residential and commercial plots are 
frequent and nearly impossible to adjudicate legally. 
 
A.4. Dispute Settlement 
 
There have been no significant investment disputes involving 
U.S. investors over the past several years, although 
commercial disputes are common.  Yemen signed the Convention 
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes in 1997, but has 
not yet ratified the New York Convention on Arbitration.  In 
the interim, business disputes are generally handled by 
informal arbitration or within Yemen\'s court system.  In 
1998, a private arbitration center, the Yemeni Center for 
Conciliation and Arbitration, was created by a group of 
lawyers, bankers, and businessmen as an alternative to the 
courts.  The center has settled a number of cases so far in 
the areas of trade, finance, construction and industry, and 
is gaining recognition as a viable alternative. 
 
The formal judicial system is widely regarded as inefficient 
and corrupt.  While Yemen\'s investment-related laws are 
basically sound, enforcement remains problematic at best and 
nonexistent at worst.  The ROYG has special commercial 
courts to provide a mechanism for commercial dispute 
resolution, but they are generally considered ineffective. 
In the fall of 2002, the GIA board of directors and the 
council of ministers decided to establish specialized courts 
for settlement of investment disputes with four appointed 
judges.  To date these special courts has not been 
established.  Bilateral and multilateral donors are actively 
encouraging the ROYG to press forward with more extensive 
judicial reforms. 
 
Most investors would be best served by establishing a 
partnership with a Yemeni who knows the system, and by 
including International arbitration clauses in their 
contracts.  In cases involving interest, most judges use 
Shari\'a (Islamic) law as the guideline, under which claims 
for interest payments due are almost always rejected.  Local 
commercial banks are sensitive to this problem, and rarely 
lend to other than established, large trading houses for 
this reason. 
 
A.5. Performance Requirements/Incentives 
 
Under Yemen\'s investment law, no performance requirements 
are specified as a condition for establishing, maintaining 
or expanding investment.  Incentives include, but are not 
limited to:  exemption from customs fees and taxes levied on 
fixed assets of the project; tax holiday on profits for a 
period of seven years, renewable for up to 18 years maximum; 
the right to purchase or rent land and buildings; and the 
right to import production inputs and export products 
without restrictions and registration in the import/export 
register. 
 
Boycott issues:  Yemen formally renounced observance of the 
secondary and tertiary aspects of the Arab League boycott of 
Israel in 1995.  However, occasional reports of violations 
occur when some Yemeni companies use old purchase order 
forms that contain prohibited language.  When these 
violations are brought to the attention of concerned 
officials, corrective action is taken.  Yemen has stated 
that it will not renounce the primary aspect of the boycott 
absent an Arab League consensus. 
 
A.6. Right to Private Ownership 
 
While foreigners may own property, foreign companies and 
establishments generally may trade in Yemen only through a 
Yemeni agent.  Law 23 of 1997 (amended), Regulating Agencies 
and Branches of Foreign Companies and Firms, outlines the 
requirements for establishing a Yemeni agent.  Chapter 3 of 
law 23 permits foreign companies and firms to conduct 
business in Yemen by establishing foreign-owned and managed 
branches.  Foreign establishments wishing to open branches 
in their own names must obtain a permit by decree from the 
Minister of Industry and Trade, subject to law 23 and other 
laws in force at the time of application.  However, as a 
practical matter, establishments should plan to engage a 
Yemeni partner.   Regarding investment projects, under the 
new investment law foreigners can own 100 percent of the 
land and can execute projects without a Yemeni agent and 
without obtaining import/export license from the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade or implementing law 23 of 1997. (The 
investment law has precedence over other laws.) 
 
Mortgage lending in Yemen is rare because of the 
aforementioned unwillingness of the court system to uphold 
the payment of interest.  In addition, Yemen has a long 
history of incomplete or inaccurate land records and 
frequent land ownership disputes, which make using land or 
buildings as collateral difficult for lenders to manage. 
While the general survey authority is working to establish a 
just and legally defensible land registry system, it is some 
years off. 
 
A.7. Protection of Property Rights 
 
Yemen has a record of inadequate protection of intellectual 
property rights (IPR), including patents, trademarks, 
designs, and copyrights.  It has not acceded to any 
international IPR conventions, and its IPR law no. 19 of 
1994 is not TRIPS compliant. Yemen\'s Ministry of Industry 
and Trade drafted three new projected laws known as the 
patents law; trademark law, and the designs and copyrights 
law.  These three new laws are expected to be approved this 
year by the cabinet, ratified by parliament and endorsed by 
the president, which will replace the IPR law no. 19 of 
1994.  In March 1999, Yemen became a member of the World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and is now 
revising its laws with WIPO guidance.  Yemen\'s application 
to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) was approved in 
July 2000.  As a next step in the accession process, Yemen 
presented to the WTO a memorandum of foreign trade regime in 
October 2002.  As part of its accession requirements, Yemen 
will need to enact its revised IPR legislation and take 
concrete steps to enforce adequately these laws. 
 
A large U.S.-based multinational firm litigated successfully 
a trademark infringement case in Yemen\'s courts in 1999. 
The ruling is now under appeal and the violator continues to 
infringe on the trademark despite the court ruling.  A final 
resolution was expected by the end of 2000, but it is still 
pending in the Supreme Court.  In a second case involving a 
U.S. Company\'s trademark, the Appeal Court handed down a 
final ruling in April 2001 to enforce the rights of the U.S. 
Company.  As of April 2003, the enforcement of the final 
ruling to cease production of the infringed products has not 
been implemented.   Both of these cases demonstrate the 
soundness of Yemen\'s basic IPR laws.  However, enforcement 
of rulings remains weak. 
 
A.8. Transparency of the Regulatory System 
 
While Yemen has fundamentally sound investment laws, labor 
laws, customs tariff regulations and tax laws, transparency 
of implementation and enforcement is elusive.  The next 
steps required in Yemen\'s civil service and administrative 
reform process are to clarify procedures, create 
implementing regulations and build a mechanism by which to 
enforce these standards.  Health and safety standards are 
rudimentary and not enforced. 
 
A.9. Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
 
In the 1990s, Yemen\'s financial sector consisted of a 
banking system that suffered from a large volume of non- 
performing loans, inadequate loan provisioning, low bank 
capitalization, and weak enforcement of prudential 
standards.  Under a 1997 World Bank-sponsored financial 
sector reform program, the government took actions to 
address these problems.  A bank reform law was passed in 
December 1998 to update, strengthen, and regulate the 
industry.  By June 2000, the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) had 
circulated strict regulations pertaining to credit risk 
management, liquidity, insider lending, foreign exchange 
exposure, financial leasing and external auditors.  Banks 
are now required to reach a capital adequacy ratio of eight 
percent and meet new classification and provisioning 
standards for loan portfolios.  Most banks are complying. 
That said, commercial banks still suffer from extremely low 
capitalization rates and are essentially owned by large 
trading families who establish the bank to service their own 
business needs. 
 
Lending to the private sector is constrained by the lack of 
judicial recourse to recover bad loans.  To correct this 
weakness, a steering committee produced a series of reform 
recommendations in mid-1999 that were approved by the 
government and sent to the Ministry of Justice for 
implementation.  Among the recommendations was the 
establishment of special loan recovery courts, which began 
operations in 2000. 
 
The ROYG was engaged in a program to privatize government- 
owned commercial banks, although progress in this area was 
thwarted when parliament did not approve a World Bank credit 
to fund the privatization program.  The National Bank of 
Yemen was to be put up for sale pending a final audit report 
for 1999, but no action has been taken.  The Yemen Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development is under restructuring and 
will likely not be privatized.  The two remaining 
specialized banks--housing and agriculture--are also being 
restructured.  Once sound, they too were to be privatized. 
 
In June 2000, the president signed the Central Bank law no. 
14, which grants greater independence to the CBY.  Its 
mandate will now focus on price stability, limiting public 
sector financing to emergency loans, freedom to adopt its 
own monetary and exchange rate policies, and enforcing 
greater commercial bank accountability.  It is authorized to 
conduct inspections of all banks implement provisioning and 
capital increase schedules, and enforces penalties and 
corrective measures.  Interbank activities are limited, and 
there are no equity or bond markets.  The ROYG is planning 
to establish a stock market in Yemen to promote the 
government\'s private sector-led growth strategy.  However, 
the consensus of most Yemeni and foreign observers is that 
the country lacks the expertise to establish such a market 
at this time.  It is also doubtful that there are sufficient 
numbers of Yemeni investors to sustain an active stock 
market. 
 
The CBY began offering treasury bills in December 1995. 
Commercial banks purchased a large share of the bills, 
investing up to 30 percent of their assets in them.  The 
interest rate on T-bills was gradually reduced from a high 
of 23 percent in 1999 to about 13-14 percent in April 2003 
to encourage investment lending. 
 
A.10. Political Violence 
 
While there were no kidnappings in 2002, Kidnappings of 
foreigners have occurred sporadically since the 1970s and 
received wide international press coverage.  Some tribal 
groups have used hostage taking to put pressure on the 
government to obtain projects or services, or to focus 
government attention on the redress of grievances.  Victims 
have included foreign businessmen, diplomats, aid workers 
and tourists.  Historically, most have been treated well and 
released unharmed after two to three days, although some 
have been held as long as four weeks.  A botched rescue 
attempt during a May 2000 kidnapping of a Norwegian citizen 
resulted in his death.  Tribal kidnappings of foreigners 
have been on the decline since 1998, partly as a result of 
tough penalties enacted by the Yemeni government as a 
deterrent, and no foreigner has been kidnapped in Yemen 
since November 2001.  The president has spoken out strongly 
against kidnapping, terming it \"terrorism.\"  Many tribal 
leaders have given assurances to the ROYG to cooperate in 
hunting down kidnappers. 
 
A significant exception to the usual pattern was the 
kidnapping in Abyan Governorate of 16 foreign tourists in 
December 1998.  Four died during a rescue attempt, at least 
two of those at the hands of the kidnappers.  Most 
observers, however, have concluded that this incident was 
the responsibility of Islamic extremists rather than tribal 
kidnappers.  The perpetrators were tried, found guilty of 
murder, and sentenced.  The Yemeni national who led the 
kidnapping was sentenced to death under the anti-kidnapping 
law of 1998 and executed in October 1999.  The non-Yemeni 
nationals involved were given maximum prison sentences, but 
some were deported in early 2002.  In late December 2002, 
three American doctors were killed near the city of Ibb. 
The perpetrator was convicted and sentenced to execution. 
 
Some tribal elements hijack automobiles or other expensive 
equipment owned by foreign companies as another means to 
pressure the government to accede to their demands. 
Particularly where oil and mineral extraction are concerned, 
some tribes in the mineral-rich areas feel that they are not 
getting their share of the wealth.  Investors in such 
ventures should be sensitive to the need to hire more local 
tribesmen than might first be judged economically necessary 
in order to build community relations and preserve the 
peace.  The provision of community-based buildings and 
services, such as in health care and education, can go a 
long way toward ensuring trouble-free investment in isolated 
areas. 
 
The bombing of the USS Cole in Aden harbor in October 2000, 
in which 17 U.S. Servicemen and woman were killed, and the 
October 2002 bombing of a French oil tanker of the coast of 
Mukalla, are considered to be the acts of international 
terrorists.  The Republic of Yemen Government and the United 
States are cooperating closely on counter terrorism 
measures, and in investigations and preventions following 
repeated terrorist acts. 
 
A.11. Corruption 
 
As one of the poorest countries in the world, with a hugely 
overstaffed (due in part to the unification of North and 
South Yemen) and underpaid civil service, Yemen has a 
significant and widely acknowledged corruption problem.  If 
anticorruption laws exist on the books, they are not 
enforced.  Illicit activities range from soliciting and 
paying bribes to facilitate or obstruct projects, to 
leveraging dispute settlements, skewing taxation and customs 
tariff augmentations, and engaging in family or tribal 
nepotism.  The government recognizes that it must affect 
civil service and administrative reforms (better jobs, 
higher pay, removal of the worst offenders) to create new 
disincentives to corruption.  Following Yemen\'s signing of a 
border treaty with Saudi Arabia in June 2000, Yemen\'s 
president Ali Abdullah Saleh announced a new commitment to 
reduce corruption.  The Ministry of Civil Service has the 
lead on anticorruption issues and has set up an executive 
committee to address the issue.  A national strategic plan 
to eliminate corruption is still not in place, however. 
 
B - Bilateral Investment Agreements 
 
The U.S. and Yemen are currently discussing a bilateral 
investment treaty (BIT) but there is no bilateral tax treaty 
between the two governments.  According to the General 
Investment Authority, Yemen signed in 2002 three new 
investment promotion and protection agreements, bringing the 
total bilateral treaties to 31, with five additional 
countries having initialed a tentative agreement.  Yemen has 
bilateral investment treaties with Algeria, Austria, 
Bahrain, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Djibouti, Egypt, 
Ethiopia, France, Federation of Russia, Germany, Indonesia, 
Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, the 
Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, 
Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Ukraine, and the United 
Kingdom.  Yemen has initialed agreements with, Croatia, 
Hungary, India, Mongolia, and Romania. 
 
C - OPIC and other Investment Insurance Programs 
 
Yemen and the United States signed an investment guarantee 
agreement in 1972.   As of October 1997, OPIC and EXIM Bank 
are on cover (or provide guarantees) for both private and 
public sector projects of short and medium term (up to seven 
years) duration. Yemen is a member of the Multilateral 
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). 
 
D - Labor 
 
The Yemeni government generally adopts International Labor 
Organization (ILO) standards regarding labor and worker 
rights.  In 1999, it ratified ILO conventions on the 
elimination of the worst forms of child labor and the 
minimum work age for employment.  As in other areas, 
enforcement of the law is weak.  Child labor has increased 
due to the negative impact of economic reforms.  Most 
children work with their families in agriculture, although 
an increasing number are being sent out to work in shops and 
restaurants.  To address this issue, the ROYG signed in June 
2000 an agreement to cooperate with the International 
Program on Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC). After 
ratification of the ILO, the ROYG established the Child 
Labor Unit at the Ministry of Labor to implement and enforce 
child labor laws and regulations. Investors may find the 
local pool of skilled labor for technology intensive 
ventures limited. 
 
Yemen\'s overall illiteracy rate is approximately 47 percent 
(2000), 27.7 percent for men and 67.5 percent for women. 
Given the departure of thousands of unskilled and semi- 
skilled Yemeni laborers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other 
Gulf states during the 1990-1991 Gulf war, Yemen\'s 
unemployment rate now stands at about 35 percent.  Those who 
complete secondary education and university studies in Yemen 
often do not possess the same professional standards as 
their counterparts hailing from Western educational 
institutions.  University graduates also experience 
difficulty finding appropriate employment and are sometimes 
unwilling to accept lower skilled jobs.  The government is 
beginning to focus considerable attention on increasing 
access to and improving the quality of vocational training 
as a means to develop a cadre of skilled laborers in high 
demand fields, including construction workers, electricians, 
plumbers and carpenters. 
 
E - Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports 
 
The Yemen Free Zone Public Authority was established in 1991 
to develop the Aden Free Zone.  Yeminvest, a joint venture 
of the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) and the Bin Mahfouz 
Group of Saudi Arabia, was awarded the concession to develop 
the area.  PSA now holds primary ownership and manages the 
Aden Container Terminal.  ACT started operating in March 
1999, and was officially opened in September of that year. 
The impressive growth was achieved in spite of the effects 
of September 11.  However, the October 2002 terrorist attack 
on the French oil tanker M/V Limburg significantly impacted 
Yemen\'s economy.  Initially, insurance premiums rose 250% 
and as a result, ships were diverted to the ports of 
Djibouti and Salalah in Oman.  The ROYG is working with the 
insurance industry to lower insurance rates, and by the end 
of 2003 insurance premiums may drop somewhat. In 2003, it is 
expected to handle 388,500 Tons Equivalent Units, TEUs, a 3 
percent rise over the 377,400 TEUs of 2002. The port mainly 
serves as a transshipment hub, but attempts are being made 
to increase the percentage of the local cargo through the 
development of the industrial and warehousing estate.  Both 
the container terminal and industrial estate are run by PSA 
and its infrastructure is now in place. 
 
In its first phase of development, ACT planned to handle up 
to 1 million Tons Equivalent Units annually on its two- 
berth, 700m quay.  Recently a fifth quay crane was added in 
February 2002 bringing current capacity to 650,000 TEUs. 
The container yard of 35 hectares offers storage capacity 
for 10,000 boxes. 
 
The industrial and warehousing estate called Aden Distripark 
(ADP) has been launched.  The first 30 hectares are ready 
for occupation and building of tenants\' factories and 
warehouses.  This area will grow to 74 hectares and 
eventually to 1,550 hectares when demand increases.  The 
Aden Container Terminal and the Aden Free Zone are promising 
areas for investment.  Majority ownership and operation by 
PSA as assured technical excellence both in construction and 
management of the container port.  Yeminvest is offering 
special \"early bird\" deals to the first investors. 
Opportunities in light industry, repackaging and 
storage/distribution operations are welcome.  Future plans 
include development of heavy industry and more extensive 
tourist facilities than currently exist in the greater Aden 
area. 
 
Free zone incentives include 100 percent foreign ownership, 
no personal income taxes for non-Yemenis, and corporate tax 
holiday for 15 years (renewable for 10 additional years), 
100 percent repatriation of capital and profits, no currency 
restrictions, and no restrictions on, or sponsoring 
required, for the employment of foreign staff.   Aden\'s main 
selling point is its strategic location - nine days steaming 
from Europe and seven from Singapore.  It is just 4 nautical 
miles off the main Far East - Europe sea route.  PSA\'s 
expertise and management guarantees stability and efficiency 
to shipping lines calling at ACT and investors to the ADP.

In May 2001, a new terminal at Aden International Airport 
was officially opened.  In addition a study was completed in 
August 2001 for future plans for the airport to include a 
duty free zone and cargo village to facilitate transit trade 
with the Aden Free Zone port facilities.  The Aden Free Zone 
Authority is looking for a company to build and operate the 
cargo village. 
 
F - Foreign Direct Investment Statistics 
 
Yemen produces no reliable statistics on foreign direct 
investment.  Most U.S. investment in Yemen to date is in oil 
exploration, production and oil field services.

newly-appointed governor of Aden, Dr. Yahya Al-Shaibi. 
Ambassador and Governor Shaibi agreed on the importance of 
sustainable development, discussing Aden\'s status as a World 
Bank Port City, and e-learning.  Ambassador highlighted the 
re-assurance a professional Yemen Coast Guard will provide 
international investors, and discussed possible future 
security training for the Aden airport.  During the one-day 
trip, Ambassador also attended a ROYG graduation for training 
conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard, met with the Director 
General and Deputy DG of Aden Airport, and bid farewell to 
longtime Amideast representative Edward Prados (septel).  The

2.  (C)  During the 7/8 trip to Aden, Ambassador met with the 
new Governor of Aden, and former Minister of Education, Dr. 
Yahya Al-Shaibi (bio note para #7), on an early morning 
flight and again during a formal office call later that day. 
 Governor Shaibi began by joking that he and the Ambassador 
already covered their agendas on the plane and introductions 
were unnecessary, but turned serious, noting the need for 
continued improvement in security, employment, investment, 
restaurants, and tourism in Aden.  Shaibi noted that Aden has 
been selected as a World Bank Port City, and said the initial 
development plan should be ready next year.  He also noted 
that he was visiting the Free Zone later that afternoon (7/8) 
and hoped future development would turn around the 50% plus 
reduction in the number of ships using the port. 
 
---------- 
E-Learning 
---------- 
 
3.  (C)  Ambassador congratulated Shaibi on his appointment 
and offered U.S. support for initiatives that strengthen 
Aden, \"a window on Yemen for the rest of the world.\" 
Ambassador announced a $1.5 million E-Learning project that 
will install internet in 20 classrooms across Yemen, 
including 5 in Aden.  He explained that the E-Learning 
program provides not only hardware, but installation and 
training.  The goal, said the Ambassador, with the support of 
ROYG and the business community, is to provide an academic 
resource to link Yemen with the rest of the world.  In 
addition, the local purchase of hardware should produce an 
added economic stimulus.  The governor noted that the 
Ministry of Education (MOE) also has a program by which 
schools can obtain computers directly from MOE and pay only 
3,000 rials ($24USD) a month.  In Aden, Shaibi said he is now 
trying to create an e-government connected to both internal 
and external networks.  He added that this connectivity will 
help with basic information and administration.

4.  (C)  Turning to the graduation ceremony in honor of the 
conclusion of U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) training, Ambassador 
shared the USG observation that the 21 Yemen Coast Guard, 
Navy, and Special Forces officers who completed the training 
were committed to their professions and enthusiastic -- all 
the makings of a \"first class operation.\"  He noted that a 
professionally competent Yemen Coast Guard (YCG) will 
showcase Aden\'s improved security posture to the world. 
Shaibi added that, in addition to the YCG, ROYG considers 
remote monitoring an important security upgrade for the port.

U.S. Coast Guard Training Graduation 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  A five-person U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) team 
instructed 21 Yemeni officers from the Yemen Coast Guard, 
Navy, and Special Forces in a nine-day \"Waterside Port 
Security Course (CG-28).\"  The Ambassador attended the July 8 
graduation ceremony and made a brief statement on the 
importance of continued U.S.-Yemen maritime cooperation. 
USCG trainers were impressed by the students\' attitude and 
ROYG cooperation.  The ceremony was also attended by Deputy 
Governor Abdul-Karim Shaif who noted that maritime 
cooperation to thwart the terrorist threat was still in its 
infancy and \"close cooperation with the U.S. must continue\". 
He thanked the U.S. for the training and vowed to find ways 
to increase the level of cooperation.  (Note:  See septel. 
The graduation was covered by numerous media outlets, 
including the Yemen Observer, Al-Ayyam, Saba News Agency, and 
Al-Tariq.  The Ambassador and the Lieutenant-in-Charge of 
U.S. Coast Guard training were interviewed by Al-Ayyam.  End

3.  (U)  Following the graduation, the Ambassador hosted a 
lunch for the Deputy Governor and officials from the Yemen 
Coast Guard, Navy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and 
Hodeidah Shipping Company.  Conversation focused on the 
operating parameters of the Yemen Coast Guard, including the 
legality of customary fees, stateless vessels, and \"piracy\" 
vs. \"larceny\".

Aden International Airport 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (S)  Before departing, Ambassador sat down with Aden 
Airport Director General Mohamed Jumeia Al-Khadhar and Deputy 
Director General Mohamed Al-Funasi to discuss strengthening 
security at Aden International Airport (see bio note para 
#7).  DG Al-Khadhar provided the Ambassador with a history of 
the Aden Airport from the 1940s to present day, and discussed 
ongoing renovations.  He highlighted the extensive 
cooperation between the airport and the U.S. and produced an 
overflowing dossier of flight clearances and diplomatic notes 
from the U.S., including correspondence during the USS Cole 
investigation.  Khadhar and Funasi discussed the airport\'s 
security at length, including talking through hypothetical 
scenarios raised by the Ambassador, and escorted the 
Ambassador on a private tour of the airport facilities -- 
stopping for a demonstration of the Terrorist Interdiction 
Program (TIP) PISCES system.  Funasi welcomed the 
Ambassador\'s proposal for a USG security assessment team 
visit within the next six months, and expressed interest in 
additional training opportunities.

5.  (C)  Edward Prados, Amideast\'s Aden Director, discussed 
the new Governor of Aden, Aden atmospherics, and education 
initiatives during breakfast with the Ambassador, PAO, and 
PolOff.  Prados, who has been working in Yemen for over three 
years, is scheduled to depart later this month.  Sharing some 
of his observations, Prados noted that the selection of a new 
Political Security Chief, and an ambitious and open-minded 
Governor, are positive developments for the entire 
governorate.  He called the December 2003 opening of a new 
shopping complex -- constructed by businessman and Member of 
Parliament Hayeel Saeed -- and the selection of Aden as a 
World Bank Port City as concrete examples of positive change. 
 
6.  (C)  Prados also identified areas for continued study 
prior to the launch of E-Learning, the MEPI funded Internet 
in Schools project for 20 schools Yemen-wide (5 in Aden).  He 
said that empowering teachers is key to the long-term success 
of the project, and voiced concern about schools\' ability to 
cover recurring costs like electricity.  PAO clarified that 
over half the E-Learning budget is designated for training 
and curriculum development, and teacher training will be an 
integral part of the program\'s implementation.  PAO also 
discussed the importance of gaining the support of the 
business community to ensure adequate funding for recurring 
costs, and, if possible, to expand E-Learning beyond the 20 
pilot schools.

attendance were Dr. Abdul Ghani and PolOff (notetaker).  End 
summary. 
 
---------------- 
Industrial Zones 
---------------- 
 
2.  (C)  During a 7/12 courtesy call, Ambassador 
congratulated Dr. Khaled Rajeh Sheik on his appointment as 
Minister of Industry and Trade, and welcomed the opportunity 
to discuss the Minister\'s program.  Sheik announced a ROYG 
plan to establish three industrial zones - one each in Aden, 
Hodeidah, and Mukalla.  ROYG will initiate this process, he 
explained, by creating laws to legalize such areas.  The goal 
is to create profit generating ventures like Jabil Ali in 
Dubai, but on a much smaller scale. 
 
3.  (C)  Sheik also discussed the importance of connecting 
Yemen to her gulf neighbors, noting that regional trade was 
only in its infancy.  He mentioned ongoing trade in fruits 
and vegetables, but noted that trade in meat was forbidden 
because of cases of Rift Valley disease in the region, 
especially in Saudi Arabia.  However, he added, smuggling of 
meat does occur.  Overall, said the Minister, \"with ongoing 
projects with the European Union (EU) and the World Bank, 
ROYG is on the right track.\" 
 
4.  (C)  Ambassador agreed that U.S.-Yemen cooperation on 
industrial zones may be a possibility.  An initial focus 
should be on improving Yemen\'s image in the world arena with 
development and security initiatives -- for example, by 
increasing maritime security with the creation of a Yemen 
Coast Guard.  Other initiatives designed to improve technical 
skills, like community colleges, he added, are also important 
to long-term success.  Concurrently, the Ambassador suggested 
highlighting a successful Yemeni corporation like the Hayeel 
Saeed Company to further strengthen Yemen\'s public image. 
 
-------------------- 
World Economic Forum 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Minister Sheik positively reflected on his 
experience as head of Yemen\'s delegation to the World 
Economic Forum in June.  He said that Yemen, Jordan, and 
other Arab countries supported the remarks made by Secretary 
Powell, and agreed upon the importance of cooperation. 
Citing a WEF debate on the effects of terror on trade, Sheik 
welcomed U.S. support for ROYG industries that have been 
affected by terror.  He also expressed interest in the 
free-trade zone outlined by Secretary Powell at WEF, although 
he noted that a great deal of work would be required to bring 
the proposal to fruition. 
 
------------------------ 
World Trade Organization 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C)  Minister Sheik confirmed that ROYG has asked the 
U.S., the EU, and Australia to support Yemen\'s accession into 
the World Trade Organization (WTO).  He said that ROYG is 
committed and will continue to engage until an agreement has 
been reached, and while the average period before accession 
is six years, ROYG wants to see Yemen accede in as little as 
three. 
 
------ 
PL-480 
------ 
 
7.  (C)  Announcing $15 million (USD) in funds for PL-480 in 
FY-2004, Ambassador said these funds should be used to 
encourage sustainable development in Yemen.  He stressed that 
the health of the Yemen economy is internally and externally 
significant because security, financial and political 
stability, and investor confidence are all interrelated. 
Ambassador noted that USAID has experience in this type of 
development and AID Yemen would tap experience elsewhere -- 
e.g. Egypt. 
 
----- 
USAID 
----- 
 
8.  (C)  USAID Representative Douglas Heisler explained that 
USAID\'s development plan for Yemen is two-fold: 1) 
short-term: strenghtening the local level, including 
agriculture and agriculture-related business; and 2) 
long-term: working with ministries, the World Bank, and other 
donors to identify long-term opportunities for sustainable 
trade and investment.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON AMBASSADOR HULL\'S ARTICLE ON 
IRAQ 
 
 
1. SUMMARY: On July 2, an opinion article on Iraq by 
Ambassador Edmund Hull, entitled \"Toward a Free Iraq: 
Security, Economic, Political Efforts on Track\" was 
widely distributed to the Yemeni press.  Out of about 29 
newspapers, six independent papers published the article 
plus the al-Sahwa.net website.  At least four papers 
reacted to the article, saying it did not change the 
minds of Yemenis about what is happening in Iraq. End 
Summary 
 
2. Commenting on the article, \"Annas\" independent weekly 
(of Islamic orientation), published an article July 7 
entitled \"Forget it Mr. Hull.\"  The paper commented that 
\"Mr. Hull wrote the article as if he were an Arab 
ambassador for quoting President Bush as Arab ambassadors 
usually do when they quote their leaders.\"  Annas 
indicated that the Yemeni people will not believe what 
the Ambassador is saying that all efforts made by the 
Americans in Iraq will serve to improve the lives of the 
Iraqi people \"even if he (the Ambassador) writes a 
thousand articles a day.\"  The paper stressed that 
Yemenis are not concerned about the future of the people 
of Iraq \"as much as they are concerned about the US 
Ambassador\'s movements and activities in Yemen which only 
God knows where they will lead.\" 
 
3. Al-Sahwa weekly, mouthpiece of the Yemeni Congregation 
for Reform (Islah party), indicated that the U.S. image 
in the eighties of last century was that of a country 
helping and supporting poor nations.  \"America\'s image 
now\" the paper added \"is that of a haughty President; of 
a frowning politician; of a soldier armed with fear and 
might and ready to strike and kill; and of disreputable 
informers - all of which do not convey the message of 
justice and truth.\"   The paper indicated that the 
\"atrocious pictures Yemenis see on TV everyday of what 
the Americans are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan are more 
truthful than what the U.S. Ambassador is trying to tell 
us.\" 
 
4. The anti-American (putatively independent) weekly \"al- 
Shumu\'\" commented that it was not very diplomatic for 
Ambassador Hull to portray the \"reckless\" American 
practices in Iraq as something \"grand\".  The paper added 
that the article\'s message was not \"very persuasive\" 
since it clashes with Yemenis\' convictions about what is 
happening on the ground in Iraq.  Al-Shumu\' concluded 
that the U.S. Administration has lost credibility in the 
world for following a \"Hollywood-like thinking.\" 
 
5. \"Al-Ihya\'a al-Arabi\" (mouthpiece of the Socialist 
Nationalist Ba\'athist party, extremely anti-American) 
described the circulation of the US Ambassador\'s article 
in the Yemeni press as \"a silly move\".  It reported that 
if \"the Ambassador knew how much the Yemeni people hate 
the pro-Zionist US administrations, he wouldn\'t send the 
article.\"  The paper criticized the newspapers that 
published the article and commended the ones that did 
not. 
 
6. COMMENT: This is the first time that we have been able 
to place an article on Iraq in so many Yemeni newspapers, 
despite our continued and insistent attempts.  The 
reaction it has produced is not very surprising because 
the mood here on Iraq is still anti-coalition.  Following 
on the heels of this placement, we have devised a plan to 
continue to seek a more balanced reporting by the Yemeni 
press (see septel).

REF: STATE 199008 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmuind J. Hull, Reasons 1.5(b and d) 
 
1, (C) We totally agree with the Department\'s assessment of 
the Arab media coverage of Iraq.  That picture is repeated 
here in Yemen, with all media outlets, official and 
independent, carrying similar tunes.  During the war in Iraq, 
Ambassador and PAO Sana\'a made personal calls to the official 
media and some independent media to ask for a more balanced 
approach.  As a result, we witnessed a diminution of the 
strident rhetoric we were seeing in some newspapers.  Our 
latest attempt to place an Op-Ed article on some coalition 
successes in Iraq bore fruit.  Six independent newspapers 
carried the article and four newspapers commented on it 
(septel). 
 
2. (C) We note however that it is not just the Arab media 
that has been guilty of misrepresenting the facts or carrying 
one-sided reports.  We have seen unbalanced and 
sensationalized coverage on CNN and other American networks. 
 
3. (C) In response to your latest call, we will expand our 
aggresive campaign to ask for a balanced coverage of events 
in Iraq.  Ambassador will emphasize progress in Iraq, e.g., 
the formation of the Governing Council, in a series of media 
interviews and make the points suggested in reftel during his 
meetings with ROYG officials. PD section will meet with the 
editors of all the media in Sana\'a starting week of July 20 
and, whenever possible, with editors in other cities, to 
deliver the same message.  This method has worked well for us 
in the past. 
 
4. (C) In the meantime, we would welcome: (1) indications 
that the security situation is improving in the country, (2) 
indications that Iraqis are increasingly governing 
themselves, (3) indications that daily life is improving for 
the average Iraqi.

AL-MOAYAD EXTRADITION DECISION 
 
REF: SANAA 1586 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (b, d) 
 
1. (c) Summary:  Foreign Minister Qirbi requested a meeting 
with the Ambassador July 19 to renew the ROYG,s request that 
the U.S. withdraw its extradition request from Germany and 
allow Yemen to host the trial of al-Moayad and his colleague. 
 Qirbi also delivered points indicating that such a 
withdrawal would have a positive impact on ROYG,s 
counter-terrorism efforts (full text translation in paragraph 
9 below).  Pol/Econ Chief and Deputy Chief accompanied the 
Ambassador.  End Summary. 
 
2. (c) Qirbi called in the Ambassador in anticipation of the 
announcement of the German court,s ruling on the al-Moayad 
extradition expected July 21.  Qirbi is aware that the ruling 
has already been made, but not of its content.  He said the 
German Ambassador, who met with Qirbi immediately before the 
Ambassador, was also not informed of the court,s decision. 
 
3. (c) According to Qirbi, the ROYG will suggest that 
Al-Moayad appeal to the constitutional court in Germany if 
judged extraditable.  He said that this will give the U.S. 
&time to reconsider its extradition request.8  He then read 
part of the July 19 diplomatic note (para. 9) in Arabic to 
make absolutely clear their concerns about the potential 
harmful effects of the German court,s decision and to 
reiterate that ROYG is willing to prosecute al-Moayad in 
Yemen, if the evidence is supplied.  He noted that similar 
points had just been delivered to the German Ambassador. 
 
4. (c) Qirbi responded positively to the Ambassador,s 
question of whether al-Moayad would take the ROYG,s advice 
to appeal.  He said that the facts of the German court,s 
ruling and the suggestion to appeal the decision would form 
the substance of any official statements concerning the 
matter. 
 
5. (c) The Ambassador also asked if the ROYG has suggested to 
al-Moayad that he cooperate with the investigating 
authorities.  Qirbi was somewhat evasive, indicating that the 
suggestion had been made, but he was not certain the 
information had actually been passed to al-Moayad. 
 
6. (c) The Ambassador said that the information provided 
would be passed to Washington at the appropriate levels, and 
that the U.S. would give serious consideration to Yemen,s 
views.  He strongly expressed that it would be helpful for 
the ROYG to make a public statement along the lines suggested 
by Qirbi that also discouraged violence or extremist 
reactions that might target U.S. or German citizens, as 
previously discussed (reftel).  Qirbi said that the Ministry 
of Interior (MOI) is working on the issue.  The Ambassador 
told Qirbi that the Embassy plans to give U.S. citizens 
notice of the preliminary decision and the anticipated appeal 
and, that while there are no particular threats, caution is 
advised. 
 
7. (u) Yemeni television and press (al-Thawra) reported July 
20 on the July 19 MFA meeting with the U.S. and German 
ambassadors and noted that the ROYG asked the U.S. to 
withdraw its extradition request; no mention was made of any 
U.S. response to the request or of Yemen,s recommendation 
that al-Moayad appeal. 
 
8. (c) Comment:  FM Qirbi is positioning the government to 
state that it has contacted the U.S. and Germany in a 
concerted effort to protect al-Moayad,s rights.  It is 
probable that the undefined steps by the MOI involve 
discussions with tribal leaders that support al Moayad to 
impress upon them that the government is addressing the 
issue.  Post will prepare a warden message in anticipation of 
the July 21 announcement of the German court,s ruling that 
cautions Amcits to be careful.  Pending final actions by the 
German judicial system and extradition to the U.S., Post 
anticipates that most demonstrations or petitions are more 
likely to be directed at the Germans.  End comment. 
9. (u) Translation of July 19 diplomatic note from the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
(begin text) 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Yemen 
extends its best regards to the Embassy of the friendly 
United States in Sanaa. 
 
In reference to the communications between the Republic of 
Yemen and friendly United States of America regarding the 
issue of Yemeni citizens Mohamed Hassan al-Muayed and his 
entourage, whom the U.S demands the German Federal Republic 
extradite to be tried in the U.S on alleged charges of being 
associated with terrorism, and with regard to the ROYG\'s 
request from the government of the United States to withdraw 
its (U.S) demand to the German Federal Republic, 
 
And in reference to the communications conducted with the CIA 
and FBI, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs herein renews ROYG\'s 
request from the U.S of withdrawing that demand and confirms 
ROYG\'s readiness to present Sheikh al-Muayed and his 
entourage to a fair trial after their return to the Republic 
of Yemen and after receiving files of the alleged accusations 
against them. 
 
The United States is aware through its experience of 
cooperation between the two countries (ROYG and U.S.) that 
Republic of Yemen will not disregard tracking down and 
punishing terrorists and all those connected to terrorism. 
 
Based on the existing close cooperation between the 
governments of Yemen and America, the government of the 
Republic of Yemen emphasizes the importance of the U.S 
withdrawing of its request of extraditing Sheikh al-Muayed 
and his entourage to the U.S and to be handed over instead to 
the government of Republic of Yemen in promoting the 
relationship. 
 
The U.S. withdrawal of its demand will have a positive impact 
on the efforts of ROYG in confronting extremism, violence and 
terrorism which will double efforts and cooperation of the 
two countries in combating terrorism, will also promote the 
emphasis in the significance of cooperation in this field, 
and will enable Yemen to avert any negative consequence of 
this case. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Yemen 
avails itself of the opportunity to express its greatest 
respect and highest consideration to the Embassy of the 
friendly United States of America.

1.  (C)  Summary and Comment:  Neither Post nor the German 
Embassy in Sana\'a have yet received any direct reaction from 
the ROYG or the public to the German court ruling in favor of 
granting the U.S. request to extradite al-Moayed and his 
companion.  Press reports 24 hours after the decision remain 
non-inflammatory;  however, many opposition papers are not 
yet published.  The ROYG appears to be encouraging a low-key 
immediate reaction.  This is evidenced in part by the 
official statement coming from Berlin and not Sana\'a and the 
emphasis placed on the expected appeals process.  Foreign 
Minister Qirbi\'s demarche (ref B) reflects a serious concern 
by the ROYG about managing the issue.  The ROYG wants to 
avoid harming U.S.-Yemeni counterterrorism cooperation and to 
protect Americans and Germans in Yemen from any violent 
reaction by showing that the government is working hard on 
the issue.  Post will continue to monitor the official and 
unofficial reaction, particularly as it affects security (see 
warden message issued 7/21 in paragraph 8).  End Summary and 
Comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Reaction Towards German and American Embassies 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2.  (U)  Post\'s Public Diplomacy section has received no 
press queries as of July 22.  Neither the German Embassy or 
Post has received any new petitions or letters.  ROYG 
officials have not brought up the issue since July 19 
(reftels). 
 
3.  (C)  German Poloff told Pol/E Deputy July 22 that German 
officials have instituted extra security measures, including 
the use of armored vehicles at all times.  Post will continue 
to monitor the situation closely and implement appropriate 
security adjustments accordingly. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
ROYG Statement; Official Media Reaction 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  Most official reports featured a press statement 
issued by the Yemeni Embassy in Berlin.  As reported in the 
press, the statement reiterated \"ROYG\'s firm stand\" on 
pursuing resolution to the case and confirmed that \"the two 
mentioned Yemeni citizens were lured from Yemen to Germany in 
violation of international laws and against Yemeni 
sovereignty.\"  It added that the Yemeni authorities would 
follow up the case and make \"all the efforts\" to succeed in 
the appeal.  It ended with a line about having confidence in 
the continuation of Yemen-German relations. 
 
5.  (U)  Official daily al-Thawra issued the press statement 
on its front page July 22.  Yemen television news on July 21 
did not lead with the story, instead reporting it in a 
straightforward manner towards the end of the newscast and 
emphasizing the expected appeals process. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Other Media Reaction;  Islah Party 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U)  Islah party affiliated Sahwa-net July 22 published 
the Yemeni Embassy\'s statement from Berlin and reported that 
Hamoud al-Darihi, member of the Islah Supreme Authority and 
Chairman of the Follow-up Committee on the al-Moayed case, 
expressed \"his astonishment\" about the German court decision. 
 Al-Darihi said his committee has been in touch with the 
Yemeni Ambassador to Germany and al-Moayed\'s lawyer and 
confirmed that they will appeal to the German higher court. 
Al-Darihi also disclosed that a Yemeni parliament and Shura

Warden Message 
-------------- 
8.  (U)  Text of Warden Message: 
The Embassy of the United States wants to inform American 
citizens in Yemen that the German authorities have ruled in 
favor of the U.S. request to extradite Yemeni Sheik Mohamed 
Ali Hassan Al-Moyyad.  Sheik Al-Moyyad was provisionally 
arrested by the German authorities on U.S. criminal charges 
of providing material support to foreign terrorist 
organizations.  Sheik Al-Moyyad has the right to appeal this 
decision and it is fully expected that he will do so. 
 
In light of this judgment and the expected appeals process, 
American citizens in Yemen are reminded to pay particular 
attention to their personal security at all times.  Americans 
should make it a point to keep a low profile, vary routes and 
times of travel, avoid large crowds and demonstrations and 
report any suspicious activity to the Embassy\'s Regional 
Security Office at 303-156/7/8/9.

 1. (c) Summary:  The Ambassador, PAO, and Pol/Econ Chief 
paid a courtesy call on Minister of Information Hussein 
Dhaifallah al-Awadhi on July 23 to congratulate him on his 
appointment and deliver the demarche points in reftel b. 
(Note:  Biographical information in paragraph 8.)  In 
addition to emphasizing the need for more balanced coverage 
of the situation in Iraq, the possibility of more broadcast 
options in Yemen, the need for increased freedom of the press 
and our mutual interest in expanding the International 
Visitor Program (IVP) for Yemeni journalists in an effort to 
promote more investigative journalism.  End comment. 
 
BALANCING IRAQ COVERAGE ) MOI ALREADY BEING CRITICIZED 
 
2. (c) After noting improvements in the security situation, 
the Ambassador said that it is time to consider serious 
economic reform, including a substantial reduction in 
corruption.  Citing both domestic and foreign investors 
interest in improvement, the Ambassador highlighted the need 
for an active and free media to expose corrupt practices.  He 
assured al-Awadhi that the U.S. is looking for ways to help 
Yemen develop a professional, responsible and well-trained 
media that will understand the privileges and 
responsibilities of a free press.  He criticized the Yemeni 
press for not acknowledging positive aspects of the removal 
of Saddam Hussein,s regime in Iraq, coalition efforts to 
help the Iraqi,s govern themselves and the establishment of 
the Governing Council.  The Ambassador suggested that the 
media should be more supportive of the &new8 versus the 
&old8 Iraq and firmly requested more balanced reporting. 
 
3. (c) The Minister said that the Parliament has criticized 
the Ministry of Information (MOI) for not controlling the 
papers enough, for example, by not designating coalition 
operations as the &U.S. occupation.8  He acknowledged that 
the problem is often a lack of information, and that the 
independent papers will attack both the official media and 
the Ministry.  When the Ambassador then asked if there was 
someone else he should speak with, al-Awadhi quickly said 
that he would call a meeting and point out U.S. concerns, but 
defended the Yemeni media by comparing it favorably to the 
Egyptian press.  He said that while Yemen did not support the 
Iraqi government, it has enjoyed a good relationship with the 
Iraqi people and would like to continue on positive terms. 
The Ambassador reiterated that both sides of the issues need 
to be presented, the U.S. is willing to accept criticism, but 
would also like credit when due -- e.g., formation of the 
Governing Council. 
 
RADIO SAWA ) ACCESS FOR ONE, MEANS ACCESS FOR ALL 
 
4. (c) Al-Awahdi said that a draft print media law is in the 
works and another law is being developed for broadcast media 
that would pave the way for other radio and television 
stations (note: The broadcast media is currently all 
government owned and controlled).  He expects to complete the 
draft in the next two months, and it will then need approval 
from both the Cabinet and Parliament.  He indicated that if 
it goes forward it would pave the way for the opposition 
party Islah to request radio and TV broadcasts.  Currently, 
the opposition intermittently broadcasts via short-wave from 
a mosque.  Responding to the Ambassador,s inquiry about 
allowing a transmitter for Radio Sawa, al-Awahdi expressed 
concern that if the ROYG gives permission for Sawa (or BBC or 
Monte Carlo, which have also made requests), Yemeni citizens 
would also be entitled to the same access.  He commented that 
Yemen is looking to its Arab neighbors for guidance and that 
Egypt has already started privatizing the media.  The 
Ambassador pointed out that Jordan and numerous Gulf states 
had licensed Radio Sawa. 
 
5. (c) The Minister said that the current focus is on 
rebuilding broadcast stations and upgrading technology.  The 
goal is to provide service to the entire country in contrast 
to the current 60 percent coverage.  He cited a new radio 
station in Hodeidah that is being built by a U.S. company at 
a cost of $1 million as well as a second project. 
 
PRESS FREEDOM ) A WORK IN PROGRESS 
 
6.  (u) While noting that the Yemeni President allows people 
to express their opinions, the Ambassador commented that 
pending court cases, intrusive investigations, and the 
detention of journalists inhibits investigative journalism. 
He said we would like to work with Yemen to promote freedom 
of the press and protections against the violation of 
journalists\' rights.  Al-Awahdi said the MOI is working to 
have a provision that would send journalists to jail for 
certain acts stricken from the new draft print media law and 
that the Ministry is changing and trying to support the 
journalists union.  He further suggested that visitor 
exchanges (e.g., professors from journalism programs) as well 
as the continuation of the Humphrey and International Visitor 
Programs focused on young journalists would promote more 
investigative journalism, which Yemen,s print news currently 
lacks.  (Note: al-Awahdi offered to provide accommodation and 
in-country support for any visiting professor if the U.S. was 
willing to pay airfare). 
 
INTERNATIONAL VISITORS ) MORE WOMEN JOURNALISTS, PLEASE 
 
7. (u) The Ambassador passed a list of six journalists who 
will participate in IV programs between now and March 2004. 
Al-Awahdi noted the balance between official and independent 
papers with appreciation, but asked why there were no female 
journalists.  PAO said that inquiries to several women failed 
to produce any willing to travel without a male escort. 
Ministry officials promised to provide the names of 
potentially eligible female journalists able to travel alone. 
 The PAO,s request for biographical information on working 
Yemeni journalists was also favorably received. 
 
8. (u) Biographical note:  Born in 1958, Al-Awadhi is a 
graduate of the University of Maryland, a Humphrey fellow and 
went on a one month IVP about three years ago.  Previously a 
professor of Arab media at Sanaa University, he has been 
Minister since 2001 and was retained from the previous 
cabinet.

Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1. (c) In a July 27 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign 
Minister Qirbi said Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh,s 
recent visit to Ethiopia paved the way for increasing 
regional cooperation.  FM Qirbi deemed President Ali Abdullah 
Saleh,s three day trip  successful in terms of strengthening 
Yemeni-Ethiopian coordination on counter-terrorism, as well 
as planning for economic development and increased trade.  He 
claimed that the growing tripartite alliance that includes 
the Sudan is not directed against any country, but is open to 
all and designed to increase economic cooperation among the 
HOA countries.  He also said that settling disputes by 
peaceful means (e.g., in Somalia and the Sudan) would be a 
major function of the alliance.  Noting that the Sudan and 
Ethiopia already have a open trade zone and that the 
Ethiopian market for Yemeni goods (oil and agricultural 
products) is about $120 million, Qirbi said the goal is to 
eventually have a Free Trade Area (FTA) and to develop a 
common market.  The Ethiopian and Yemeni presidents also met 
with businessmen to discuss improving the investment 
environment. 
 
2. (c) The Ambassador mentioned General Robeson,s recent 
visit to Yemen (septel), his interest in the HOA, training in 
Yemen and other countries, and the possibility of future 
regional exercises.  He also asked about Kenya,s inclusion 
in the alliance.  According to Qirbi no other specific 
countries or limitations on cooperation were discussed by the 
presidents.  There is interest, however, in developing 
stonger ties to Tanzania given the large Tanzanian population 
in Yemen.

1.  (u)  Begin summary:  The Ambassador\'s July 8 trip to the 
southern port city of Aden (reftels) to attend the graduation 
ceremony of the first group of Yemeni officials trained by 
the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) received favorable coverage in 
both national and local press.  During the visit, the 
Ambassador also met with the newly appointed Governor of 
Aden, Dr. Yahya Al-Shaibi, to discuss the training, 
strengthening Aden\'s security posture and an 
Internet-in-the-classroom initiative (ref b).  Two Aden-based 
independent newspapers -- the widely-circulated daily 
Al-Ayyam, and the weekly Al-Tariq -- carried extensive 
coverage of the visit underscoring the vital role of Yemeni 
coastal forces in safeguarding the port of Aden and the 
Yemeni coastline.  Al-Ayyam also published exclusive 
interviews with Ambassador Hull (text para 5) and USCG 
Representative to Yemen, Captain Robert Innes (text para 6). 
End summary. 
 
2.  (u)  On July 9, Al-Ayyam, an independent daily based in 
Aden, published a full-page, illustrated story titled 
\"American Ambassador Praises First Graduates of the Yemen 
Coast Guard and Affirms They Will Be A Deterring Force to 
Protect Yemen,s Security.\"  The article described the 
graduation of about 20 Yemeni officers as the \"first (Yemen) 
coastal force trained by experts from the U.S. Coast Guard,\" 
and said the Deputy Governor of Aden, Abdul-Karim Shaif, 
praised the efforts of the American experts.  The paper also 
mentioned the Ambassador,s discussions with the newly 
appointed Governor of Aden, Dr. Al-Shaibi (ref b). 
 
3.  (u)  On July 10, Al-Ayyam published an exclusive 
full-page interview under the heading \"U.S. Ambassador to the 
Paper: Yemen Exerted Serious Efforts to Increase Security for 
Aden Port and Yemeni Coasts\"  (text para 5).  The interview 
discussed various aspects of U.S.-ROYG cooperation, as well 
as reconstruction in Iraq and the Roadmap. 
 
4.  (u)  Aden-based weekly Al-Tariq carried a half-page 
report titled \"Aimed at Protection and Safeguard of Shipping 
at the Regional Waters the Americans Sponsor Training of 
First Group of Yemen Coast Guard Forces\" on July 15.  The 
report says that following the attacks on the USS Cole at the 
Port of Aden and the French tanker along the coast of 
Mukalla, there has been an urgent need for the existence of a 
security apparatus to undertake the responsibility of 
ensuring safety and security for Yemen territorial waters. 
Al-Tariq concludes that this will require the establishment 
of a Yemen Coast Guard. 
 
5.  (u)  Excerpt from Ambassador\'s Interview with Aden-based 
daily Al-Ayyam. 
 
(Begin text) 
 
Al-Ayyam:  Could you brief us on the reason for your visit to 
Aden? 
 
Ambassador:  We have three reasons for this visit.  First, is 
to meet with the new Governor of Aden who has a good 
reputation.  Since we are interested in doing a number of 
things in Aden, it would be good to get to know the Governor 
at the beginning of his new post and also to know his ideas 
and explore the issues of co-operation.  The second reason 
for the visit is to announce a new program launched by the 
Embassy, which is the e-learning program under the Middle 
Eastern partnership initiative.  We have $ 1.5 million to get 
Internet into 20 to 25 Yemeni schools.  We will choose five 
schools in Aden and five in Sana,a.  The rest will be 
distributed to other Yemeni governorates.  We wanted to 
inform the Governor about this project and get his support. 
The third reason is that the U.S. Coast Guard has a team in 
Aden providing training for the Yemen Coast Guard.  Today we 
are attending the graduation of the first batch of 
U.S.-trained Yemen Coast Guard officers and I wanted to be 
here for the graduation. 
 
Al-Ayyam:  Your government has a lot of programs for Yemen, 
some of which are in Aden, such as the de-mining program and 
the current security training for Aden Airport security.  Why 
don,t you have a consulate here as rumors indicate that you 
have an intention to open one? 
 
Ambassador:  I think the answer to that is simple that we 
feel that we could do all our works in Aden by visiting Aden 
regularly from Sana,a.  Transportation between Sana,a and 
Aden including air flights are available and the roads are 
good.  This allows us to do several programs though we do not 
have permanent representation here. 
Al-Ayyam:  How do you think Coast Guard training would serve 
Aden Port security and how would that be reflected in the 
West? 
 
Ambassador:  I think the world is watching Yemen make serious 
efforts to increase security in Aden port and along the 
Yemeni coasts as a whole.  This is not the issue of high 
sounding statements, but these are doable efforts and do not 
only include getting the required equipment but also getting 
the necessary training to enable the Coast Guard force to use 
such equipment effectively.  In addition, the Coast Guard is 
building a qualified modern institution with the required 
infrastructure such as the headquarters and maintenance 
centers to be able to run their operations.  Therefore you 
have to look at what the Coast Guard is doing and not at what 
is being said about them.  If you looked at what Yemenis are 
doing to improve security in Aden and along the Yemen coast, 
I think that will have a great effect to change the image 
that there is no security in this area. 
 
Al-Ayyam:  In regards to e-learning, how many schools will 
have the program?  Will the private sector take part in this 
program? 
 
Ambassador:  The program includes 20 schools at least in 
Yemen and we hope that the private sector will participate. 
We are currently in contact with the private sector and we 
have found some interest.  We believe that it is natural for 
the private sector to contribute to this program since 
Internet training in Yemen for a new generation capable of 
using the Internet would be very useful for private 
establishments. 
 
(End text) 
 
6.  (u)  On July 9, Al-Ayyam carried an article based on a 
July 8 interview with USCG Representative Captain Robert 
Innes. 
 
(Begin text) 
 
\"U.S. Maritime Officer to Al-Ayyam:  Aden is Nominated to 
Establish a Regional Coast Guard Training Center\" 
 
In his talk to al-Ayyam, Captain Robert Innes, Maritime 
Advisor to the Yemeni Authorities, described the graduation 
of the first batch of the Yemen Coast Guard as a step in a 
series of others to train the Yemen Coast Guard.  He 
indicated that \"the training of the first batch focuses on 
safety and security and future training will include maritime 
and engineering skills for all, since achieving 
professionalism in this area means training to all sailors.\" 
 
As far as the new training programs are concerned, he said 
that \"new training programs actually began before this one, 
which ended today (July 8th); even started, and will 
continue.\"  \"We have been working with the Yemen Navy for two 
years and my job is to transfer knowledge and experience and 
infrastructure equipment to the leadership, and once this 
leadership takes over they would be able to do everything by 
themselves\" he added. 
 
Responding to al-Ayyam,s question about having a regional 
training center instead of moving from a port to another and 
whether Aden is nominated for this; Mr. Innes said that there 
will be one in the future and that Aden is nominated \"but we 
are looking for an institution for which Aden could act as a 
branch.  The center in Aden will be leading a 500km-long 
coast with operation centers alongside the coast.  Other 
ports such as Mukalla and Hodeida will have branches too. 
There is a great benefit in making certain duties such as 
training central since this is an economic issue too. The 
Yemen Navy and the Yemen Coast Guard have been clever about 
this since they have selected the best examples from all over 
the world and not from the United States alone and I am 
encouraging them to do this.  The system followed in the U.S. 
may not be the best for Yemen.  America is a big country and 
applying the American system in Yemen may not be the best 
solution, and the Yemen Government has looked around the 
world for the models that suit them best.\"

2. (c) In a meeting with FM Qirbi on July 27, the Ambassador 
lauded the formation of the IGC and its recent participation 
in the UNSC meeting in New York.  He noted UN SYG Annan\'s 
supportive statements and Special Representative de Mello\'s 
supporting role in helping the IGC to begin the process of 
normalizing Iraq by naming ministers and ambassadors, writing 
a new Constitution and preparing for elections.  He strongly 
urged Yemen to make public statements in support of the IGC 
and provided the talking points in reftel a as a non-paper. 
 
3. (c) In response to the demarche, Qirbi said Iraq is on the 
agenda for the next Arab League ministerial in September and 
indicated that the ROYG would follow the Arab League\'s 
decisions on the IGC,  According to Qirbi, the need for the 
IGC to have backing of the Iraqi people in the form of 
constitutional status was discussed at a meeting of Arab 
League countries and until the formulation of such a 
government, Yemen views the \"alliance\" (coalition) as being 
the \"rulers\" of Iraq. 
 
4. (c) In response to the question of whether Iraq would be 
allowed a representative at the League\'s meeting of foreign 
ministers, Qirbi suggested that IGC members might be 
permitted to address the League in their \"personal\" 
capacities.  He also suggested the need for a \"roadmap\" for 
how the Arab League and its members will work with the UN to 
benefit Iraq.  He asked whether or not the coalition wants 
Arab participation in resolving Iraq-related issues and what 
Arab countries\' role would be in supporting coalition 
objectives.  Qirbi stated that Yemen sees the key goals as: a 
democratic state with a new Constitution, ending \"occupation\" 
and re-integrating Iraq into the region. 
 
5. (c) Comment/action request: The upcoming Arab League 
ministerial in September could be an opportunity to gain 
broad Arab acceptance of the IGC, if the UNSC precedent is 
followed.  We recommend that the Department build early 
support among sympathetic Arab League members for such a 
step. End comment/action request.

cooperate on al-Moayed case.  Saleh also pressed for 
additional CT resources.  Ambassador briefed Saleh on pending 
contract for Marib power plant that would adversely affect 
American investment in Yemen.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (S) At President Saleh\'s request, Ambassador, ORCA Chief 
and Legatt-designate met with him July 30.  Ambassador 
presented Saleh initially with chart that depicted history of 
American company Delma\'s effort to win contract for Marib 
power plant.  Chart outlined steps since 1998 that Delma had 
taken in accordance with Yemeni contracting procedure only to 
be informed recently that a Yemeni company (NATCO) was to be 
awarded the contract on the basis of its bid which appeared 
to be based on and marginally improved Delma\'s offer. 
Ambassador emphasized that virtually no American business 
would be interested in investment in Yemen if Delma\'s 
multi-million dollar effort was frustrated due to 
irregularities in the Yemen bid process.  Saleh took the 
point and phoned the Minister of Electricity to direct that 
all documents be forwarded to the President\'s office for 
review. 
 
3. (S) Saleh then raised next tranche of ORCA support for 
Yemen\'s counter terrorism effort.  ORCA chief briefed Saleh 
on recent discussions with PSO Chief Gamish and reiterated 
documentation required.  It was agreed that Yemeni government 
would provide bank statements as needed. 
 
4. (S) Saleh then turned to al-Moayed case and reviewed his 
telcon with FBI Director Mueller and \"understanding\" that US 
and Yemen would cooperate in resolving the issue.  Saleh 
argued that al-Moayed was an unimportant personality, unlike 
other al-Qa\'ida figures like Nashiri, and that political cost 
to ROYG and US of his extradition outweighed potential CT 
gain.  In response, Legatt-designate briefed Saleh on letter 
now being translated from him to Interior Minister Alimi 
which would provide basis of US case and an invitation to 
three Yemeni officials to come to New York to work with the 
prosecutors and FBI case agents, on al-Moayed\'s case. 
Legatt-designate stressed importance of al-Moayed and 
corroborating evidence from several sources of his 
association with Al-Qa\'ida.  Ambassador noted that 
al-Moayed\'s crime involved collecting funds in the US and 
from Americans which reinforced US determination to pursue 
his case vigorously. 
 
5. (S) Saleh agreed that Interior Minister Alimi, 
Legatt-designate and Ambassador should work further to 
determine how to deal with the issue. He emphasized the 
political embarrassment the ROYG will suffer if al-Moyad is 
extradited.  He agreed to study the FBI invitation but did 
not commit to sending a Yemeni team.  Ambassador noted that 
al-Moayed was associated with the Islah party which had 
several suspect associations including Sheikh Abdul Magid 
Zindani with al-Qa\'ida and the Al Aqsa fund which financed 
Hammas.  Within Palestinian circles, it was known that Islah 
fundraising for Palestine was rife with corruption.  ROYG 
should not associate itself with the Islah party and 
specifically al-Moayed, Ambassador advised. 
 
6. (S) Legatt-designate briefed Saleh on ongoing training of 
Interior Ministry officials on crime scene investigation and 
conveyed personal greetings from FBI Director Mueller.  Saleh 
expressed interest and appreciation for the training and 
reciprocated Muller\'s greetings. 
 
7. (S) COMMENT:  Saleh remains personally engaged on the 
al-Moayed case.  The sheikh\'s charitable works in Sana\'a have 
made him a popular figure here.  Saleh continues to hope that 
his extradition to the US can be avoided and it will take 
continuing effort on our part to get the ROYG to acquiesce 
and work with the USG.  Ambassador and Legatt-designate will 
follow up with Interior Minister and try to move toward 
US-Yemeni cooperation rather than confrontation.

SUBJECT: EMBASSY SANA\'A PROPOSAL FOR PKO FUNDS 
 
 1.  (SBU) Below is the spending proposal from US Embassy 
Sanaa for use of $5 million PKO funds in Yemen. 
 
2.  (SBU) We have three (3) objectives in using these funds: 
(1) Continue to move forward with the Counter Terrorism fight 
in Yemen and, as a second/third order effect, in the region, 
(2) Provide an infrastructure for joint use by the Yemen 
Navy/Coast Guard as part of the Maritime Security Strategy, 
and (3) Preclude any involvement of North Korea in Yemeni 
maritime affairs. 
 
3.  (SBU) The Yemen Maritime Strategy directs that the Yemen 
Navy and Coast Guard work jointly to secure its ports and 
interdict sea borne infiltration from the Red Sea. The Yemen 
Coast Guard performs its mission out to 12 nautical miles 
while the Yemen Navy works from 12 nautical miles and out. 
Currently, the ROYG is standing up the Yemen Coast Guard with 
EDA patrol boats from the USCG.  The ROYG has let a contract 
to buy ten patrol boats from an Australian firm.  While these 
are good first steps, no infrastructure exists to maintain 
the boats over the long term.  Without this infrastructure 
the new boats will quickly become inoperational and the 
Maritime Strategy unworkable. 
 
4.   (SBU) Additionally, it is necessary to train the 
officers and men of the Yemen Navy and Coast Guard.  English 
language proficiency is a hugely lacking in Yemen.  We need 
to take it upon ourselves to train these officers and men in 
English so they can travel to the Unites States and undergo 
training in our service schools.  This has the added affect 
of immersing these officers and men in the US lifestyle and 
professionalism of the US Armed Forces that they will bring 
back to Yemen. 
 
5.   (SBU) We have found that as we bring trainers in to 
train the Yemen Armed Forces the Yemen soldiers do not have 
the basic equipment of soldiering to include uniforms, boots, 
helmets and other needed items.  We then lose valuable 
training time as we buy essential items of equipment for 
their use. We propose to stockpile uniforms, boots, helmets 
and other equipment so as we begin to train these soldiers 
they look and feel as if they belong to a professional unit. 
This has a great impact on morale and professionalism. 
 
6.  (SBU) We propose to spend $4.45M on Yemen Navy/Coast 
Guard infrastructure to include mobile repair shops, marine 
travel lift, secure communications equipment, facility 
establishment, engine repair parts, hull repair parts, 
maritime skills training, and coastal security and counter 
terrorism training.  Additionally, we propose to spend $350K 
on English language training for up to 200 personnel and 
$200K for basic and essential soldiering equipment. 
 
7.  (SBU) In a meeting with the Yemen Armed Forces Chief of 
Staff, the Ambassador also reiterated the importance of 
Yemeni understanding of USG sensitivities to any Yemeni 
cooperation with North Korea in the construction of the 
Yemeni navy port at Hodeidah.  (Ambassador will be meeting 
with Minister of Defense on this subject next week.) 
 
8.  (SBU) This proposal achieves the objectives outlined in 
paragraph 1 above and also attains US goals and interests in 
Yemen and the region.  Request approval of the proposal and 
the release of the $5M PKO funds to Yemen.

SUBJECT: INTERIOR MINISTER ALIMI ON AL-MOAYED, TRAINING AND 
COLE ESCAPEES 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, Reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  Interior Minister Alimi again pressed 
Ambassador August 5 for US agreement to return Sheikh 
al-Moayed to Yemen for trial, in response to FBI invitation 
for Yemeni officials to visit New York and review evidence 
following al-Moayed\'s extradition.  Ambassador and 
Legatt-Designate reiterated firm USG intent to extradite and 
urged Yemeni government to cooperate in al-Moayed case and 
urge al-Moayed himself to cooperate.  Current training of 
Interior forces was assessed favorably by both sides and 
future training discussed generally.  Legatt-Designate 
proposed formation of a joint task force to pursue Cole 
escapees.  Alimi was cool to the idea, but agreed to study 
it. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador, Legatt-Designate Gaudin, Special Agent 
Fernandez and RSO Laas met Interior Minister Alimi for nearly 
two hours August 5, to follow up previous discussion with 
President Saleh and invitation for Yemeni officials to come 
to New York to meet with American prosecutors and review the 
al-Moayed case subsequent to his extradition. 
 
3. (C) To start, Ambassador praised Alimi on excellent crime 
scene exercise which he had attended that morning on the 
outskirts of Sanaa.  Ambassador praised Yemeni participants 
for their enthusiasm and qualifications.  He also praised FBI 
trainers for their expertise.  Ambassador noted that this 
training had direct relevance to our counter terrorism 
efforts and was funded by the Diplomatic Security Bureau of 
the State Department.  Alimi welcomed the training and said 
it would serve as one of the bases for the new CT capability 
that he was forming within the Ministry of Interior. 
 
4. (C) Discussion turned to extradition of al-Moayed. 
Minister Alimi said he, PSO Chief Qamish and President Saleh 
had all considered the letter of the Legatt-designate (Para 
8) which contained particulars of the US case and an 
invitation for Yemeni officials to come to New York City to 
review all evidence and cooperate with US prosecutors.  Alimi 
said the facts in the letter broke little new ground.  The 
Yemenis continue to consider al-Moayed a relatively 
unimportant player and one best handled in the Yemeni courts. 
 He reiterated previous Yemeni offers to work with US 
authorities in bringing al-Moayed to justice in Yemen.  In 
response, Ambassador and Legatt-designate reiterated US 
determination to extradite al-Moayed and cautioned the 
Minister that previously seemingly unimportant terrorists 
subsequently played important roles in facilitating attacks. 
Extensive discussion ensued and Alimi indicated that it is 
unlikely Yemeni authorities will accept the invitation. 
Ambassador stressed that cooperation on al-Moayed\'s part and 
between the US and Yemen offered the best opportunity to deal 
with the political fallout of the al-Moayed case. 
 
5. (C) Discussion eventually turned to future training of 
Interior Ministry CT Unit.  Legatt-Designate sketched 
training programs that have been successfully done in 
Indonesia and Pakistan.  In so doing, he noted that such 
training falls within the purview of the State Department ATA 
Program, but he would recommend that the FBI support such 
training if agreed. RSO noted funding for such training would 
have to be obtained.  Ambassador said that US would explore 
the possibility based on the Minister\'s interest. 
Legatt-designate then noted that the FBI hopes to have slots 
for one or two Yemenis at the FBI Academy and suggested that 
the Yemeni facilitator in the current training program, Major 
Qatan, would be an excellent candidate. 
 
6. (C) Legatt-Designate then noted Ambassador\'s previous 
demarche to President Saleh on urgency to recapture escaped 
Cole suspects as well as BG Robeson\'s similar Demarche to 
Alimi August 4.  Legatt-Designate proposed that a joint task 
force be formed with the sole purpose of recapturing 
prominent Cole escapees.  FBI participants would bring their 
expertise and capabilities to the effort.  Such a step would 
signal from the Yemeni side complete determination to bring 
these wanted individuals to justice.  In response, Alimi 
expressed Yemeni determination to recapture the escapees.  He 
noted the significant changes that have occurred in Yemeni 
security services in the wake of the escape.  The issue 
currently was to develop leads, follow-up and re-arrest. 
Ambassador pointed out that development of leads was exactly 
where the FBI could help and extraordinary efforts are now 
required in this regard.  Alimi said he would study the 
proposal. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT:  Minister Alimi was obviously conflicted in 
this meeting.  The al-Moayed case presents significant 
political costs here, and the Minister is accurately 
reflecting President Saleh\'s strong personal preference that 
al-Moayed be returned to Yemen.  The Minister is also 
responsible for security of Americans in Yemen and will have 
to manage any threats that result from an extremely unpopular 
handover.  That said, Minister Alimi appreciates acutely the 
benefits Yemen accrues from CT cooperation with the US and 
will work to keep that cooperation on track despite 
inevitable political and security fallout from al-Moayed\'s 
extradition. 
 
8. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT OF FBI LETTER TO MINISTER ALIMI: 
 
His Excellency 
Dr. Rashad al-Alimi 
Minister of Interior 
Sana\'a 
Excellency: 
 
It is our pleasure to invite three members of your government 
to visit the Federal Bureau of Investigation\'s New York City 
Office.  The purpose of the invitation is to discuss the 
pending United States criminal case against two Yemeni 
citizens, Mohamed al-Moayad and Mohamed Zayed.  We would like 
to extend this offer for your visit upon completion of all 
extradition proceedings involving al-Moayad and Zayed.  It is 
believed that this visit will further the spirit of 
cooperation between our two agencies in combating the global 
war against terrorism.  This request for you to visit the 
United States is at the expense of our government.   A more 
complete and full disclosure of the facts involved in the 
case will be made available to you upon your arrival in New 
York City. 
 
A summary of the case is outlined below: 
 
It initially was reported to the FBI that al-Moayad was 
involved in supplying money, arms and recruits to mujahideen 
fighters, i.e., men fighting for extremist Muslim groups such 
as al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and the separatists in Chechnya 
and Kashmir.  Al-Moayad also stated, in substance, that he 
has supplied al-Qaeda with arms and communication equipment 
in the past. 
 
Al-Moayad identified five individuals in New York who were 
sending money from the United States to al-Moayad.  Al-Moayad 
provided contact telephone numbers for these individuals. 
Al-Moayad indicated that he received money for the jihad that 
was collected at a mosque in Brooklyn, NY. 
 
Al-Moayad suggested meeting in Frankfurt, Germany because he 
and the secretary who was to accompany him could easily get 
visas to Germany.  Al-Moayad also explained that he 
(al-Moayad) had business to conduct in Germany.  Al-Moayad 
specifically referenced plans to purchase 
counter-surveillance equipment from a German company, known 
as PK Electronic International GmbH and Co KG, located in 
Hamburg, Germany.  Al-Moayad showed a typewritten invoice 
from PK International reflecting al-Moayad\'s proposed 
purchase of equipment.   The buyer was listed as Ali Ibrahim 
Elhayek, whom al-Moayad identified as the individual making 
the purchases on al-Moayad\'s behalf.  Al-Moayad claimed that 
he wanted the equipment to enable him to conduct 
counter-surveillance against Yemeni internal security 
authorities, whom al-Moayad believed might be monitoring him. 
 The invoice reflects the purchase of, among other things, a 
\"Mini Transmitter Detector,\" a \"Wrist Watch Transmitter,\" a 
\"Wrist Watch Camera Set,\" \"Audio Surveillance Device,\" 
\"Quartz Controlled Ball Point Pen,\" \"Photographic 
Surveillance System with Camera and Adapter\" and a \"Universal 
Tapping Detector.\" 
 
The names of people living in the United States were then 
investigated by the FBI.  It was determined that the persons 
in the U.S. were involved in helping al-Moayad. 
 
On January 7, 2003, Mohamed Zayed and Mohammed al-Moayad 
arrived in Frankfurt, Germany.  On the previous day, an FBI 
source had a telephone conversation, which was not recorded, 
with Mohamed Zayed, in which he told the source that 
al-Moayad and Zayed almost cancelled their trip because of an 
incident that had occurred in Frankfurt on January 5, 2003, 
during which the pilot of a small airplane threatened to fly 
into a building, but that al-Moayad thought the meeting in 
Frankfurt was too important. 
 
On January 7, 2003, al-Moayad and Mohamed Zayed met a second 
FBI source and the four men went to dinner.  At the direction 
of the FBI agents, source one and two did not discuss the 
purpose of their trip and the meeting in Frankfurt at the 
dinner. 
 
On January 8, 2003 Mohamed Zayed, al-Moayad, source one and 
source two, had breakfast together and then met in source 
two\'s hotel room to discuss business.  During a two-hour 
meeting, which was recorded, source two advised al-Moayad 
that source two was interested in providing money to support 
the jihad against America and Zionist governments.  Al-Moayad 
told source two, in part and substance, that al-Moayad had 
met with Usama bin Laden and discussed matters with bin Laden 
and that bin Laden says that al-Moayad is his \"sheikh\" or 
spiritual leader.  Al-Moayad also said that jihad\" was 
al-Moayad\'s field and that he is connected to terrorist 
organizations and has prior knowledge of terrorist 
activities.  In response to a question by source two, 
al-Moayad said he would make inquiries as to whether source 
two\'s men could train with terrorist fighters.  Towards the 
end of the meeting, al-Moayad said he would provide source 
two with names of people in the United States who could 
transfer money from source two to al-Moayad.  The meeting 
concluded with the four men agreeing to meet again to 
continue their discussions. 
 
During the January 8, 2003 meeting, source two and al-Moayad 
were the primary speakers, with source one serving as a 
translator.  Mohamed Zayed was present for the entire meeting 
and occasionally interjected in the conversation by prompting 
al-Moayad\'s responses to questions from source two.  For 
example, at one point, when al-Moayad was having difficulty 
remembering the name of one of his terrorist contacts, Zayed 
supplied the name.  Zayed also nodded his head in apparent 
agreement to certain statements made during the meeting.  At 
the outset of the meeting, Zayed questioned the presence of 
source two\'s pager on the coffee table, appearing to express 
concern about the possibility of cameras and recording 
equipment in the room.  At one point during the meeting, 
al-Moayad said they should swear on the Quran that they will 
trust each other with respect to the matter of the money and 
keep it secret, remembering that Allah is watching.  In 
response, all four men, including Mohamed Zayed, stood up and 
placed their hands on the Quran.  At another point during the 
meeting, al-Moayad pointed to Zayed and told source two that 
money could be sent through \"Mohammed.\" 
 
In the evening of January 8, 2003, source two met with 
al-Moayad and Mohamed Zayed in a hotel room.  During that 
meeting, which was recorded, the three men discussed the use 
of codes when speaking with each other on the telephone. 
 
On January 9, 2003, Mohamed Zayed and al-Moayad again met 
with both sources.  During this conversation, which was 
recorded, source two asked al-Moayad to identify the group or 
groups to which source two\'s money would go, specifically 
whether source two\'s money would go to al-Qaeda, or other 
groups.  Al-Moayad responded that the money would be used to 
support the mujahideen fighters of both al-Qaeda and other 
groups.  Source two asked what the defendant Mohamed Zayed\'s 
role was and whether he was someone source two could deal 
with directly if something happened to al-Moayad.  Al-Moayad 
responded that Zayed was someone he trusted.  Source two 
asked Zayed directly if source two gave Zayed his (source 
two\'s) money, would Zayed give it to the people to whom 
source two wanted it to go.  Zayed swore to Allah that he 
would.  Later in the meeting, Zayed suggested that possibly 
arrangements could be made with members of terrorist groups 
to allow source two to send money directly to a terrorist 
group. 
 
Over the course of the meetings in Germany, al-Moayad 
reiterated to source one that individuals in Brooklyn, New 
York could be used to facilitate the transfer of money to 
al-Moayad. 
 
It is believed that the opportunity to review the evidence of 
the case in its entirety will assist you in fighting the 
threat imposed by al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. 
 Additionally, it is hoped that at the completion of the 
review, both your agency and ours, can continue to work 
together to locate evidence against al-Moayad and other like 
minded persons in the U.S., Yemen, and abroad. 
 
 
                              Sincerely, 
 
                              Stephen Gaudin

SUBJECT: YEMEN SEEKS INCREASED COOPERATION WITH HOA TO 
DECREASE TERRORISM 
 
REF: SANAA 1814 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. This is an action request.  See paragraph 10. 
 
2. (c) Summary: Commander of the U.S. Combined Joint Task 
Force for the Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), General Maston 
Robeson, met with the Yemeni Ministries of Defense, Foreign 
Affairs and Interior on August 4 to discuss American and 
Yemeni policy objectives in the Horn of Africa (HOA).  The 
ministers\' comments largely focused on maritime security, the 
need to promote stability in Somalia and counter-terrorism 
cooperation, and were consistent with press reports of a ROYG 
campaign to increase cooperation in the Horn of Africa and 
the formation of a Yemen-Ethiopia-Sudan tripartite (reftel). 
Yemeni officials, concerned that terrorists are taking 
advantage of the transit routes used by the many immigrants 
landing on Yemen\'s unguarded coasts, are working with the 
U.S. to establish a fully functioning Coast Guard and to 
increase border security.  They anticipate regional 
cooperation will help increase domestic stability in HOA 
countries which will result in decreased migrant flows and 
stem some of the flow of terrorism.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Increased Border Security Required to Staunch 
Migrant/Terrorist Flow 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (c) On August 4, General Robeson met with Minister of 
Defense Abdullah Ali Aliawa, Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Abubaker Abdullah al-Qirbi, and Minister of Interior Rashad 
Mohammad Al-Alimi to discuss Yemen\'s role in increasing HOA 
cooperation in the fight against terror.  All three ministers 
conveyed similar messages.  With vast coastlines and porous 
borders with Saudi and Oman, border security remains an area 
of ROYG concern.  Since the resolution of border demarcation 
issues with Saudi Arabia, ROYG has turned its attention to 
maritime security along the southern and western coasts. 
There is specific concern about the Gulf of Aden and the \"Bab 
al-Mandeb\" Straits.  Chief of Staff Gassimi, who attended 
Robeson\'s meeting with the Defense Minister, believes the 
same vessels taking advantage of Yemen\'s unguarded coasts to 
smuggle people, goods, and possibly weapons, may be involved 
in the \"bi-directional flow of terror across the Red Sea.\" 
 
4. (c) The ROYG is working with the U.S. to establish a fully 
functional Coast Guard by 2006, and holds monthly security 
meetings between the Ministries of Interior, Transportation, 
and other security officials to study ways to improve border 
security.  However, Minister of Defense Alaiwa said, \"ROYG 
lacks the tools necessary to do more\" including a radar 
system.  Robeson asked all three ministries if ROYG would be 
interested in \"Safe Skies\", a program designed to create 
region-wide radar coverage by increasing the level of radar 
technology at HOA airports.  FM Qirbi and Minister Alaiwa 
agreed to consider the program and requested additional 
information.  The Minister of Interior deferred to Ministry 
of Defense. 
 
5. (c) The Defense Minister also told Robeson that Yemen has 
good relations with Sudan, Kenya, and Ethiopia, but relations 
between Yemen and Eritrea remain strained (due in part to the 
dispute over the Hanish Islands), and that there is no 
central government in Somalia with whom the ROYG can work. 
He noted that Yemen is making overtures to increase economic, 
political, and security cooperation among HOA countries 
through the recent creation of a tripartite (Yemen, Ethiopia, 
and Sudan) commission and an invitation to other countries in 
the region with similar \"principles and objectives\" to join 
its efforts (reftel).  The ROYG is considering expanding the 
multilateral partnership to include Kenya, Tanzania, and/or 
Djibouti.  (Comment: This \"open\" invitation has been met with 
skepticism by Eritrean officials in Sana\'a, who maintain that 
the sole purpose of the tripartite is to ensure Eritrea\'s 
isolation. End comment.) 
 
6. (c) Foreign Minister Qirbi called on General Robeson and 
the U.S. to facilitate greater regional cooperation to bring 
stability and security to HOA, thereby stanching the 
continuous flow of migrants to Yemen.  Robeson noted that the 
U.S. is already conducting training in Yemen, Eritrea, and 
Djibouti to provide local forces with the necessary skills to 
improve maritime security, and training in Sudan is scheduled 
to start soon.  He suggested that a regional exercise would 
be useful in promoting Yemen\'s efforts to increase maritime 
security. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Local Conflict Contributes to Regional Instability - 
Solving Somalia 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7. (c) To succeed in the war on terror, Minister Qirbi 
believes the U.S. must do more to solve regional conflicts -- 
there is no government in Somalia, the Sudanese government is 
overwhelmed, and Ethiopia and Eritrea are still dealing with 
a border issue.  Qirbi said strong central governments need 
to be established, and domestic issues must be dealt with 
impartially and politically in order to achieve a 
comprehensive solution. 
 
8. (c) According the ministers, the ROYG,s goal in Somalia 
is to reduce external influences on internal Somali issues 
(for example, interference from Ethiopia and Eritrea) and to 
promote the establishment of a strong central government. 
Chief of Staff Gassimi expressed interest in the U.S. 
position on Somalia, asking which side the U.S. will 
recognize, and alluded to a failed ROYG attempt at mediation. 
 Undeterred by previous difficulties, the Minister of 
Interior said Yemen is preparing to send ROYG officials to 
Somalia in the near future as there are currently no Yemeni 
officials on the ground. 
 
----------------------------- 
Counter-terrorism Cooperation 
----------------------------- 
 
9. (c) The ministers were also united in their view that a 
lack of counter-terrorism cooperation makes HOA an attractive 
target for terrorists interested in exploiting its unguarded 
transit routes.  General Robeson was told in his meetings 
that President Saleh has raised this issue with Ethiopia, 
Djibouti and Kenya but, with the exception of the new 
tripartite venture, there is currently no multilateral 
initiative to address the issue. 
 
10. (c) Comment: ROYG officials responded well to Robeson\'s 
preliminary proposals for areas of future U.S.-Yemen 
cooperation and U.S.-HOA cooperation that might include 
Yemen.  They spoke about Yemen\'s approach to HOA and the 
reasons more regional cooperation is necessary with 
unexpected candor, and provided unusually detailed responses 
to General Robeson\'s questions.  The Yemen-Ethiopia-Sudan 
tripartite is evidence of HOA multilateralism at work and may 
prove the basis for a regional security initiative capable of 
deterring terrorist operations.  Having said this, the effort 
is still in its infancy and the details of how such a 
consortium might operate and its effectiveness are untested. 
Post will continue to engage with the host government and HOA 
representatives in Yemen to seek opportunities to influence 
the process in such a way that it promotes U.S. interests in 
regional stability.  Post also welcomes additional guidance 
and information from the Department or CENTCOM on U.S. 
programs in the HOA that could be expanded to include Yemen, 
specifically the \"Safe Ships\" initiative.  End comment.

TAGS: PREL, PARM, MCAP, YM, DPRK 
SUBJECT: YEMENI MILITARY LEADERS BRIEF AMBASSADOR ON DPRK 
CONTACTS 
 
Classified By: AMB EDMUND J. HULL FOR REASONS 1.5 (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: On 8/10 Yemen\'s Chief of Staff and Defense 
Minister informed the Ambassador that President Saleh had 
taken the decision to end Yemeni military cooperation with 
North Korea.  At Yemen\'s invitation a senior DPRK delegation, 
possibly including the deputy ministers of defense and 
industry, will soon visit Sanaa to discuss modalities.  Yemen 
will seek redress of \"technical problems\" with SCUD missiles 
delivered in December, possibly involving the return of 
defective missiles to North Korea and refund of payment.  The 
Yemenis made clear that these steps are being taken in 
response to the requests of the USG, particularly U/S 
Bolton\'s June visit, and Japan.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, OMC Chief and CT 
Coordinator, called on Chief-of-Staff Qasimi and MinDef Aliwa 
August 10 to discuss an impending visit to Yemeni by a North 
Korean delegation to discuss military cooperation.  The 
meeting was a follow-up to MoD\'s meeting with BG Robeson 
August 4, in which Aliwa first informed the Ambassador that 
DPRK officials would visit soon. 
 
3. (C) Following an initial discussion of Yemen\'s 
increasingly effective counter-terrorism efforts, the 
Ambassador turned to the main topic of the meeting: North 
Korea.  Ambassador noted that he had requested the meeting to 
receive the ROYG\'s briefing on the impending visit of DPRK 
officials to review aspects of military cooperation between 
the two countries.  He reminded Qasimi and Aliwa of the USG\'s 
deep concern over North Korea\'s past cooperation with Yemen, 
as underscored during the June visit of Under Secretary 
Bolton. 
 
4. (C) Aliwa stated that Yemen had understood U/S Bolton\'s 
message, and for that reason had informed the U.S. Embassy of 
the pending DPRK visit -- which would possibly include the 
Deputy Ministers of Defense and Industry -- and welcomed the 
opportunity to provide details.  Aliwa stated that Yemen had 
benefited from the low prices North Korea charged for its 
military goods and services.  Nevertheless, at the urging of 
the USG, Japan and others, the ROYG had taken a \"political 
decision\" to end all cooperation with the DPRK.  Talks with 
the visiting North Korean officials would concentrate on 
modalities of doing so.  Aliwa said that President Saleh had 
personally made the decision and directed that he (Aliwa) 
brief the Ambassador.  He added that Yemen would need U.S. 
help to compensate for the loss of affordable North Korean 
services, particularly with regard to construction of a 
naval/coast guard facility at Hodeidah. 
 
5. (C) Chief of Staff Qasimi reviewed three areas of past 
bilateral cooperation between Yemen and the DPRK: 
 
-- SCUD missiles, which had been provided under an old 
contract.  Qasimi stressed that Yemen would not/not undertake 
any upgrades to its current stock of missiles, and revealed 
for the first time that the shipment of SCUDs received last 
December had \"technical problems.\"  He said Yemen had not 
formally accepted the defective missiles, and that addressing 
this problem would be one focus of the impending DPRK visit. 
Qasimi noted that one option was to return the missiles to 
North Korea and seek a refund if no other solution could be 
found.  Aliwa suggested, in jest, that the U.S. might want to 
buy the missiles.  In response to a direct question from the 
Ambassador, he said there was no/no possibility of any SCUDs 
being exported from Yemen to a destination other than North 
Korea. 
 
-- A small ammunition factory in Abyan (southern Yemen), 
which had been producing small caliber ammunition since the 
1970s. 
 
-- A \"coastal project\" which had as yet had not been 
implemented.  This involved several aspects, including 
construction of docks, a repair workshop and buildings for 
the residence of naval/coast guard personnel.  The terms had 
been attractive for Yemen, as the North Korea had offered 
financing over a period of more than 10 years. 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador urged the Yemeni military leadership to 
think holistically about planning facilities for the navy and 
coast guard to avoid duplication and inefficiency.  He 
stressed that Yemen should develop its own domestic 
capabilities and minimize dependence on outside assistance, 
such as North Korea had provided.  Qasimi agreed, but noted 
that the ROYG had approached China, which was currently 
performing a study of possible coastal defense construction. 
Ambassador pointed out that cooperation with China did not 
carry the same sensitivity for the United States as did 
cooperation with North Korea.  Qasimi and Aliwa both asked 
that the USG urge Japan to provide financial assistance to 
help Yemen meet its coastal defense needs.  Aliwa asked that 
the USG also ask Yemen\'s Gulf neighbors to offer support. 
Qasimi expressed frustration with Saudi Arabia, which was 
providing financial support to improve security along the 
land border between the two countries but no help on 
confronting the maritime threat, which in fact was greater. 
 
7. (C) Ambassador also raised the recent EP-3 incident, which 
is reported via a separate channel. 
 
8. (C) Comment: Clearly the ROYG at the highest level 
received and have understood U/S Bolton\'s message on North 
Korea.  Post will continue to work this issue closely with 
the Yemeni leadership as the ROYG works toward ending its 
cooperation with the DPRK.  Embassy is currently studying 
ways to assist Yemen in developing coastal facilities.  We 
have a plan to use currently available funding for facilities 
that serve the Yemen Coast Guard and Navy.  Through military 
channels, we are requesting experts to look at the 
requirements holistically with the objective of a 
cost-effective approach that precludes recourse to North 
Korea.

1.  (U)  This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
2. (S/NF) Post understands that the German Constitutional 
Court has indicated it will issue a decision to extradite 
Sheikh Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayed and his colleague 
Mohammed Mohsen Yahya pending the answers to questions posed 
to the USG.  However, the timing of the announcement of the 
decision remains unknown.  Best estimates of German officials 
and Amembassy officers in Sanaa are that Sheikh al-Moayed 
could be extradited to the United States within several weeks. 
 
3. (S/NF) From conversations with the Department, Post 
further understands that declassification procedures for the 
statement of case to designate Sheikh Abdul Magid Zindani 
(refs a and b) are near completion.  We have been told that 
we can expect a pre-notification cable to designate Zindani 
by the end of August. 
 
4. (S/NF) Comment/Action request: Post fully supports the 
designation of Zindani, and has pre-briefed the issue and 
received initial indications of ROYG support (ref b).  The 
al-Moayed case, in contrast, remains extremely sensitive in 
Yemen and presents significant political costs for the ROYG 
(refs c, d and e).  Sheikh Zindani does not enjoy the same 
level of general public support as al-Moayed.  However, 
should Zindani\'s designation be announced at or near the time 
of al-Moayed\'s extradition, we anticipate a heightened 
negative public reaction due to a perceived linking of the 
two cases.  This reaction would be exacerbated if the Moayed 
extradition decision came before the Zindani designation. 
The government\'s need to manage this reaction could lead to 
decreased political will to fully support and implement 
Zindani\'s designation.  Therefore, Post requests that the 
Department consider completing Zindani\'s designation as 
rapidly as possible -- immediately if feasible -- to distance 
it from the expected al-Moayad decision and maximize ROYG 
support.  End Comment/Action request.

SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING - AUGUST 20, 2003 
 
Classified By: CHARGE ALAN G. MISENHEIMER, for reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Charge convened an EAC 
meeting on August 20 to assess the recent bombings in Baghdad 
and Jerusalem and how this could affect security for official 
and unofficial Amcits in Yemen.  Also discussed was a recent 
internet news item concerning terrorism and security in 
Yemen.  Key offices and personnel represented at the meeting 
included:  POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, ORCA, DAO, OMC, 
AND SOC YEMEN.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  The Charge briefed the EAC on the August 19, 2003 
bombings in Baghdad and Jerusalem, and discussed with 
attendees any implications for the security situation in 
Yemen.  The EAC decided that there were no immediate or 
obvious connections to be drawn between the bombings and an 
increased threat in Yemen.  EAC attendees collectively had no 
specific indications or warnings of an immediate threat to 
Amcits or American installations in Yemen. 
 
3.  (C)  The Assistant Regional Security Officer (ARSO) 
briefed that he had discussed the attacks with the Local 
Guard Force (LGF) supervisor and had directed an increase in 
vigilance among LGF staff.  The ARSO also discussed the issue 
with counterparts in the Central Security Organization and 
the Political Security Organization.  Both organizations had 
been directed earlier in the day by their higher command to 
increase Yemeni guard vigilance around the American Embassy 
and housing installations. 
 
4.  (C)  The EAC decided that a warden message to the U.S. 
community was not warranted.  While a warden message and/or 
other responsive measures might become necessary, there was 
as yet no specific indications of a heightened threat to 
Amcits or U.S. interests. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  In a separate issue, the Charge passed out copies 
and discussed a August 16, 2003 internet news item from the 
DEBKAfile.com site.  The story was passed to him by the 
director of the local United Nations (UN) office.  The story 
indicated that Yemen, as well as Kenya and Saudi Arabia, had 
been targeted during the week of August 10 for devastating 
mega-terror offensives.  ORCA reported no information to 
substantiate such lurid predictions.  OMC indicated that he 
knew of the site and that it was consistently sensationalist. 
 While the UN director told the Charge that he would keep an 
eye on the site and forward any other information of 
interest, the EAC agreed that the Embassy would continue to 
rely on its own sources of information regarding security 
issues.

SUBJECT: YEMENI JUSTICE MINISTER PLANS FOR REFORM 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons 1.5 (b 
,d) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary and comment:  Charge, accompanied by 
pol/econoff, called on newly-appointed Minister of Justice 
Dr. Adnan Omar al-Jafri on August 24 to discuss judicial 
reform efforts in Yemen.  The Minister described his 
methodology for approaching the reform he admits is sorely 
needed, highlighting specifically the role of women and the 
need for commercial law reform.  The Minister will attend the 
Arab Judicial Forum in Bahrain and said repeatedly the \"doors 
are open\" for cooperation between his Ministry and the USG on 
reform efforts.  A congenial and energetic persona, the 
Minister appears eager to make his mark on judicial reform. 
However, given the complicated and antiquated justice sector 
in Yemen and his newness in the ROYG Cabinet, it remains to 
be seen if his efforts will result in the kind of concrete 
reform that Yemen needs.  See paragraph 7 for biographic 
data.  End summary and comment. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
He Has a Plan;  Requests USG Assistance 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  The Charge asked about ROYG efforts on judicial 
reform since 1997 and the Minister\'s plans for continuing 
reform, particularly regarding women.  The Minister said he 
visited all twenty governorates over the summer, exploring 
such issues as accessibility to justice, the speed by which 
judgements were made and the special difficulties faced by 
women seeking justice.  He said that eight conferences will 
be held over the next month covering all governorates to 
discuss judicial reform.  The results and recommendations of 
the conferences will be brought together in a large gathering 
in Sanaa, with the aim of developing a comprehensive reform 
document that would provide the basis for the ROYG\'s reform 
efforts.  He noted the sessions would be open to the public 
and invited Embassy officials to attend. 
 
3.  (U)  The Minister said that the international community 
has not provided the necessary engagement on judicial reform. 
 However, he admitted that part of the problem has been a 
ROYG reluctance to be open to such assistance, partly because 
of the Islamic Shari\'a roots of Yemen\'s law practices.  He 
emphasized that his \"doors were open\" to strong cooperation 
and assistance and said that once his reform plan is 
developed, he plans to engage with the donor community on a 
frequent basis.  He said he would like to work closely with 
the U.S. Embassy to cooperate in \"all areas\" of judicial 
reform.  He also described his efforts to modernize 
administrative aspects of the judicial sector that need 
assistance, including putting hand-written laws and court 
decisions on computer and training staff.  (Note:  Both the 
World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme have 
nascent programs to assist the justice sector.  Bilateral 
assistance is limited.  End note) 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Increasing Role of Women; Commercial Law Reform 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.  (U)  On increasing the number of women in the justice 
sector, the Minister said that more than half of the law 
students in Aden were women, noting that \"all fields are open 
to them.\"  (Note:  Yemen currently has less than ten female 
judges, all of whom serve in family court.  One of the 
participants attending the Arab Judicial Reform conference in 
Bahrain is a female commercial lawyer based in Aden, Reem 
Abdullah.  End note) 
 
5.  (U)  The Charge also asked about Yemen\'s weak commercial 
law courts, which the Minister agreed create a disincentive 
for foreign investment.  Al-Jafri noted the sector only has 
five commercial law courts and thirty judges, not all of whom 
are trained in commercial law practice.  He requested 
assistance with training programs targeting commercial law 
reform, including English-language training. 
 
---------------------------- 
Attending Bahrain Conference 
---------------------------- 
 
6.   (U)  Minister al-Jafri expressed appreciation for the 
Bahrain conference and said he looks forward to attending. 
He said he is particularly interested in meeting Justice 
Sandra Day O\'Connor and discussing possible cooperation with 
the United States.

Dear Colleagues, 
 
Please find enclosed the first draft of our proposed 
resolution for the 47 general session of the General 
Conference of the IAEA under the agenda item 15: Nuclear 
Security/ Measures to Protect Against Nuclear Terrorism, for 
your consideration. 
It has been structured in a way to reflect the agreement in 
principle that we have obtained in Paris, Washington and 
London which is basically to disentangle radioactive material 
from nuclear material (this draft is being sent only to the 
three countries at the time being).  The resolution consists 
of: 
 
A: Illicit Trafficking: 
This is taken basically from GC(45)/Res/14/A with some 
modifications.  It needs to be fine tuned once the Report of 
the IAEA DG called for by GC (45)/ Res/14, is published, 
which will be this week according to a phone conversation 
with the Agency relevant people.  We are open to changes on 
this part of the proposed resolution. 
 
B. Nuclear Security and CPPNM: 
This is taken from GC(45)/Res/14/B and GC(46)/Res/13 with 
modifications.  It needs to be fine tuned to reflect the 
current status regarding the negotiation on the CPPNM, which 
we are not fully aware off.  Again, we are open to changes 
here. 
 
C. Security and Safety of Radioactive Material: 
This, we are very well aware off everything going on and we 
have put together what we believe is an excellent text that 
we would like to keep as is if possible. 
 
We will be waiting for your thoughts.  Please communicate 
with your representative in Vienna to work with us on this as 
we plan to be in Vienna the week before the General 
Conference.  Thank you for your cooperation and look forward 
to hearing from you.

1. (c) On September 1, Pol/Econoff met with Abdul Hakim 
Al-Iryani to deliver reftel demarche on Iraqi Governing 
Council (GC) participation in the September 9-10 Arab League 
(AL) meetings in Cairo, and to discuss last week\'s 
\"postponement\" of an announced GC visit to Yemen. 
Pol/Econoff also delivered reftel points on the October donor 
conference, although Iryani did not say if the ROYG would 
like to attend. 
 
2. (c) Iryani believes the Arab League (AL) will invite the 
Iraqi Governing Council (GC) to Cairo because Arab countries 
\"do not want to see an empty chair.\"  He took note of reftel 
points highlighting the importance of GC participation in 
regional and international fora, including GC interest in 
addressing AL members.  Referring to a list of new Iraqi 
Ministers in the press, Iryani asked if the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs would be confirmed in time to attend AL 
meetings in Cairo.  Regardless of the timing of his 
appointment, Pol/Econoff said the GC welcomed invitations and 
would designate a representative as appropriate. 
 
3. (c) On the apparent postponement of the GC visit to Yemen, 
Iryani noted that the GC never set a firm date and, while GC 
representatives would probably have met with Yemeni Foreign 
Minister Qirbi and Prime Minister Bajammal, no appointments 
were actually scheduled.  Iryani said the ROYG assumed the GC 
would contact one of Yemen\'s embassies in the Gulf during 
their regional tour.  However, according to Iryani, the GC 
failed to contact Yemeni authorities in either the Gulf, 
Yemen, or Iraq, to finalize, postpone, or cancel their visit. 
 
 
4. (c) Comment:  The MFA apparently discovered the trip was 
canceled when the GC delegation did not show up.  Yemeni 
authorities appear receptive to a GC visit; but until the GC 
reschedules its visit it will be difficult to gauge the 
ROYG\'s actual level of support for the Iraqi Governing 
Council.  End comment.

1. (c) Begin summary:  During an August 7-11 trip to the 
Hadramaut, Embassy officials met with Governor Hilal, Deputy 
Governor Ulufi, political figures, and members of the Civil 
Democratic Forum -- a Yemeni NGO -- to discuss the region\'s 
future.  In Mukalla, Governor Hilal and members of Yemen\'s 
three major political parties -- the General People\'s 
Congress (GPC), Islah, and Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) -- 
highlighted the importance of maritime security, ongoing 
efforts to convince Yemeni expats to return, and attempts to 
rehabilitate Hadramaut,s economic sector.  In Seiyun, Deputy 
Governor Ulufi and YSP representative Mahboob Faraj Aman 
discussed ROYG\'s objectives in the inner Hadramaut.  The 
delegation\'s visit to the oil company Canadian Nexen\'s 
shipping terminal and Central Pumping Facility is reported 
septel.  The regional visit received positive media coverage 
in Al-Ayyam, a widely-read independent based in Aden, and the 
ROYG daily Al-Thawra.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Maritime Security and Other Assistance: 
Don\'t Forget About the Hadramaut 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (c) Governor Abdul Qader Hilal, Deputy Governor Ulufi, and 
members of Yemen\'s three major political parties -- GPC, 
Islah, and YSP -- agreed on the importance of security and a 
strong economy.  Although \"a strategically important 
governorate that is more stable and less disposed to violence 
than the north,\" Hilal said that to ensure maritime security 
the Hadramaut needs more resources.  Citing U.S. efforts to 
help Yemen establish a maritime security force, GPC Chief 
Awadh Abdullah Hatem invited U.S. advisors to Mukalla, but 
stressed that any training should include local trainees. 
(Note: ROYG routinely deploys its Sanaa-based security forces 
around the country instead of recruiting from the local 
population.  End note.) 
 
3. (c) Hatem recognized ongoing Yemen-U.S. military 
cooperation, including support for the Yemen Coast Guard and 
the Navy, but emphasized that assistance needs to go directly 
to the people.  Ulufi later suggested assistance include 
drinking water, education, and health projects, including 
family planning.  Long considered taboo, Ulufi believes 
people are beginning to realize the benefits of smaller 
families and would welcome family planning.  Islah (an 
Islamist oriented party) representative Muhsen Basurrah also 
noted that Yemen needs U.S. support in the areas of job 
creation and garnering international support for subsidies. 
(Note: the latter is strongly at odds with World Bank and IMF 
recommendations.  End note.) 
 
----------------------- 
Economic Rehabilitation 
----------------------- 
 
4. (c) According to Governor Hilal, benefits from the 
governorate\'s natural resources, location, and economic 
experience have been eroded by government mismanagement and 
poor political decision-making.  He said the government must 
focus on the needs of the people, and has begun to encourage 
fish wealth, mineral exploitation, agricultural development, 
and road construction. 
 
5. (c) Remittances are an important source of revenue for the 
Hadramaut, and Hilal hopes the return of wealthy expats will 
increase direct investment.  One example of the type of 
investor the Governor is trying to attract is Sheikh Bukchan, 
a Saudi businessman of Yemeni origin.  Bukchan is building a 
fish canning factory near As-Shahir that Hilal believes will 
create 10,000 new jobs.  (Note: ROYG is also preparing land 
along the coast near As-Shahir for a still unnamed project -- 
believed to be a textile plant -- and the World Bank, the EU, 
and Canadian Nexen are all working on new projects in the 
region. End note.) 
 
---------------- 
Fishing Industry 
---------------- 
 
6. (c) Ongoing conflicts between commercial and traditional 
fishing, and the absence of a maritime security force to keep 
foreign fishing vessels out of Yemeni waters, remain areas of 
concern.  Efforts to resolve the conflict between commercial 
and traditional fishermen have gone all the way to President 
Saleh who, according to Hatem, spent four hours negotiating 
between the sides during his last visit to the region. 
However, Governor Hilal noted that the recent establishment 
of fishing associations has increased overall productivity. 
Before these associations there was no cooperation, no 
stockpiles, and no marketing culture.  Hilal said other 
proposals to support the fishing industry will include new 
roads, cold storage facilities, and programs to encourage 
graduates to enter the fishing industry. 
 
------------------------------ 
Employment vis--vis Education 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (c) To lay the foundation for economic development, Hilal 
believes that work must be done away from the ministries in 
the private sector, particularly in oil refining and 
fisheries.  Unemployment among university graduates is a 
continuing concern, and Hatem noted that one of Mukalla,s 
private universities is trying to establish a program to 
partner with enterprise.  To ensure that foreign firms are 
hiring Yemeni nationals, Hatem said the Ministry of Oil and 
Industries has requested information on the nationality of 
employees.  Hilal also asked for greater transparency in the 
application process for U.S. educational exchanges and an 
increase in the frequency and funding of such exchanges.  The 
Islah representative Basurrah echoed Hilal,s concerns. 
 
---------------- 
Tribal Influence 
---------------- 
 
8. (c) According to Seiyun\'s YSP representative Mahboob Faraj 
Aman, tribal influence is considerably less in the inner 
Hadramaut than in other areas in Yemen.  He said local tribes 
are split between Islah and GPC, but their affiliation is 
based largely on \"who pays more for their support.\" 
 
-------------- 
Media Reaction 
-------------- 
 
9. (u) With the exception of the pro-Saddam Ba\'th party 
newspaper \"Al-Ehya Al-Arabi,\" media reaction to the Embassy\'s 
August 7-11 trip to the Hadramaut has been positive.  On 
August 8 the official daily \"Al-Thawra\" carried a short piece 
noting that Governor Hilal discussed economic, social, 
cultural and political activities with the American Embassy 
delegation.  The August 9 edition of the Aden-based 
independent \"Al-Ayyam\" ran a one-page exclusive on the visit, 
including a rough transcript of a working lunch between USG 
officials and representatives from the GPC, Islah, and YSP. 
 
10. (c) However, the August 14 edition of \"Al-Ehya Al-Arabi\" 
described the visit as a scandal \"in continuation of U.S. 
violation in Yemen.  (Comment:  Embassy contacts have 
commented extensively on the \"Al-Ayyam\" piece, but few appear 
to have seen \"Al-Ehya Al-Arabi\'s\" coverage.  End comment.) 
 
--------- 
Bio Notes 
--------- 
 
11. (u) Governor Abdul Qader Ali Hilal was born in 1962.  He 
holds a BA in police sciences, a diploma in Sharia law, and a 
higher diploma in local administration.  He served as 
Director General in the Taiz and Ibb governorates, 
consecutively, from 1985 until 1994 when he became Deputy 
Governor of Ibb.  Hilal served as Governor of Ibb from 1995 
until he assumed his duties as Governor of Hadramaut in 2001. 
 A former marathoner, he is married with seven children. 
 
12. (u) Mukalla GPC Chief Awadh Abdullah Hatem was born in 
Mukallah in 1952 and is a graduate of Mukalla University.  He 
was a member of the Executive Committee of the Local Council 
before unification and was formerly the Director of Youth and 
Sports.  In addition to his duties as GPC Chief, Hatem is 
Undersecretary of the Hadramaut governorate.  He is married 
with three children.

CPF 
 
Classified By: Charge Alan Misenheimer for reasons 1.5(b,d). 
 
1. (c) Begin summary:  During an August 7-11 visit to the 
governorate of Hadramaut, Embassy officials toured oil 
company Canadian Nexen\'s Central Pumping Facility (CPF) and 
Export Terminal.  Nexen said it has good relations with its 
neighbors and there have been no threats to the pipeline, but 
noted that both facilities are focused on the safety and 
security of operations and personnel.  Since the October 2002 
attack on the French tanker \"Limburg\" and the 2003 Riyadh 
bombings, Nexen has increased its security posture by 
purchasing new vessels for maritime patrols, fencing in its 
airstrips, and installing additional barriers.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
CPF:  Security and Coordination 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (c) Embassy officials met with Central Pumping Facility 
(CPF) Production Manager Ralph Johnson, Environmental Health 
and Safety Director Alan Philips, and Administrative Manager 
Mohammed Bin Naibhan.  The CPF is a self-sufficient compound 
with generators, a sewage treatment plant, an airfield, and a 
helicopter pad.  The CPF is protected by both military and 
contract guards, and the 120 kilometer pipeline to the 
Terminal has six isolation points -- 4 controlled by the CPF 
and 2 by the Terminal -- that can be monitored by both. 
 
3. (c) CPF personnel security includes monthly updates of 
employee lists and a database of electronic copies of 
employees\' passports, which are shared with U.S. Embassy 
Sana\'a.  Nexen officials said that all personnel are now 
flown to/from Sanaa and between the CPF and the Terminal at 
greater altitudes to decrease any land-based threat. 
 
4. (c) According to Johnson, oil companies Total, DNO, and 
Dove have tied their lines into the CPF, which is expected to 
produce between $275-300 million in revenue over the next 2 
years.  Nexen, \"as the largest and most established company 
in the region, has also assumed a mentoring role\" for their 
overall operations, including security.  There is \"constant 
radio communication\" between the four and each has 
participated in UNDP-sponsored security meetings in Sana,a. 
In early August, Nexen also held a workshop with local Yemeni 
officials to discuss contingency plans and clarify 
appropriate points of contact. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Terminal:  Maritime and Compound Security 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (c) At the Terminal, Embassy officials were escorted by 
Terminal Manager Nigel Precious and Crude Oil Exports 
Superintendent Barry Herbert.  Completely self-sufficient, 
the Terminal operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to 
prepare and batch oil from the CPF to meet quality and 
quantity standards for export.  Two expansion groups are 
currently onsite:  one studying the feasibility of adding a 
second SBM (Single Buoy Mooring); the other conducting 
maintenance on storage tanks.  Nexen is also providing ROYG 
guidance and coastal surveys for a proposed ROYG refinery a 
few miles east of the Terminal.  (Comment:  If the project 
goes forward, the ROYG will likely use Nexen,s SBM for 
export.  End comment.) 
 
6. (c) According to Precious, Chevron, Texaco and other 
routine consumers share information and observations on Nexen 
and ROYG\'s security posture, \"which have a direct impact on 
the entire industry.\"  In response to the 2003 bombings in 
Riyadh, Nexen increased the Terminal\'s physical security by 
installing additional barriers and fencing in the airfield. 
Nexen officials said the ROYG military presence around the 
facility has also  improved.  Forsight and \"luck\" saved Nexen 
considerable financial loss when the Limburg was attacked in 
October 2002 on its way to pick-up over one million barrels 
of oil.  Nexen had just completed a 1 million barrel storage 
tank and was able to hold the excess until alternative 
transportation was found. 
 
7. (c) As part of ongoing efforts to strengthen maritime 
security, Nexen also recently purchased four Delta 10m ribs 
with twin 315-horse power engines.  These vessels are more 
sophisticated than those Nexen,s maritime security force (9 
ROYG officers) had been using, and, while Delta trainers 
accompanied the boats upon delivery, the ROYG-contracted 
Pakistani trainers who took over upon their departure were \"a 
disaster.\"  Nexen has now entered a month-to-month training 
contract with the British-based Hart Group. 
 
------------------- 
Community Relations 
------------------- 
 
8. (c) Both the Terminal and CPF have extensive community 
relations programs.  In 1998 Nexen made a strategic decision 
to provide support to the local population via the local 
government.  The local councils submit proposals directly to 
Nexen, and the company decides which to fund.  Nexen,s 
medical clinics also offer free health care and medicine to 
the local population and the military, including medevacs. 
CPF offiials estimate that 2,000 people a month pass through 
the clinic -- of whom 1,200 are local villagers. 
 
9. (c) A planned bypass in Wadi Arab to take the pipeline out 
of the way of mudslides may impact community relations.  The 
villages along this portion of the pipeline help Nexen dig 
out when floods bury the line, and moving the line will mean 
a local loss of revenue.  Nexen has maintained open lines of 
communication with the villagers throughout the deliberation 
phase to prepare them for change.

1. (c) On September 15, the DCM discussed Iraq and other 
issues with Ministry of Foreign Affairs Under Secretary 
Hussein Taher bin Yahia, who said that the ROYG would welcome 
a visit by the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) \"with open 
arms,\"  and that plans for such travel would most likely be 
arranged through Yemen\'s mission in Baghdad.  The DCM 
commended Yemen\'s support of the Iraqi delegation at the Arab 
League ministerial in Cairo, September 12-14. 
 
2. (c) Pol/Econ Chief and Pol/Econoff met with Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Director of the Americas Office Abdulsalem 
Qassim al-Awadhi on September 9 to deliver several unrelated 
demarches (septels).  During the meeting, al-Awadhi previewed 
that the ROYG was joining other Arab countries in support for 
allowing IGC a seat at the table for the Arab League meeting 
of foreign ministers.  He noted that the main purpose of the 
recent visit of Syrian Vice President Khaddam was to discuss 
Iraq.  Note: This is in contrast to press reports and a 
Syrian diplomat in Sanaa who claimed the main purpose of the 
visit was bilateral relations.  End note.  When asked about 
whether the IGC would visit Yemen, al-Awadhi said that the 
ROYG is prepared to welcome the Council and there has been 
some speculation that the IGC will visit Yemen and other 
countries after the Arab League meeting, but no firm plans 
have been discussed. 
 
3. (u) Background:  On or about August 28, the ROYG announced 
that it would recognize the Iraqi cabinet.  Several days 
later the Yemen Government officially welcomed the formation 
of an Iraqi government under U.S. civilian supervision (ref 
b).  Local press reports that in a recent satellite 
television interview Foreign Minister Qirbi reaffirmed the 
ROYG position that U.S. and British forces should withdraw 
from Iraq and said that the Arab League and the UN should 
provide the groundwork for any new Iraqi constitution.  End 
background. 
 
3. (c) Comment:  Yahia\'s and al-Awahdi\'s seemingly 
enthusiastic support for a visit by the IGC is a welcome 
development, but it does not appear that the government is 
extending an invitation to the Council so much as expecting 
that it will include Yemen in any as-yet-unannounced official 
travel plans (ref a).  End comment.

SUBJECT: PROMINENT EXILES RETURNING TO YEMEN 
 
Classified By: Charge D\' Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for reasons 1.5 ( 
b) and (d) 
 
1. (c) Summary: Prominent Yemeni exiles who left after the 
1994 conflict continue to slowly return to Yemen, including 
most recently Dr. Abdul-Aziz al-Dali, a former People\'s 
Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) foreign minister.  The 
2002 Presidential pardon of 16 separatist Yemen Socialist 
Party (YSP) leaders, however, has not resulted in the return 
of any of the \"list of 16,\" including the top leadership. 
President Saleh publicly repeated his encouragement for 
exiles to return home just after the April 2003 parliamentary 
elections, supporting speculation that the measure is 
intended to provide a counter-balance to tribal, Islamist and 
military forces on the political landscape.  It remains to be 
seen how prominent a role returnees will play in Yemeni 
politics.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2. (u) Following the foiled secession attempt during the 1994 
war, hundreds of Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) military and 
civilian leaders and their supporters fled Yemen to 
neighboring Gulf States, Egypt, Syria and the United Kingdom. 
 The ROYG conducted trials in absentia and issued death 
sentences to 16 senior leaders, led by former ROYG 
vice-president and YSP secretary general Ali Salem al-Beedh, 
who had fled to Oman. 
 
3. (u) Since the May 2002 Presidential decree dropping 
charges against separatist leaders of the \"list of 16\" and 
pardoning them, a number of military and civilian leaders and 
their families have returned to Yemen.  While it seems that 
no one from the list has yet come back, the pardon issued by 
President Saleh has encouraged other prominent personalities 
to return.  The most prominent leader to return recently is 
Dr. Abdul-Aziz al-Dali, member of the YSP Central Committee, 
former PDRY Foreign Minister and post-1990 unity Minister of 
State for Foreign Affairs.  He is the highest-ranking YSP 
official come back since newly-appointed Presidential Advisor 
Salem Saleh last year (septel). 
 
---------------------------- 
Will Any of the \"16\" Return? 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (u) It appears that none of the prominent members of the 
\"list of 16\" has returned to Yemen, although there are 
unconfirmed rumors that perhaps one minor military official 
has come back.  Negotiations between President Saleh and some 
of the most well-known members of the \"16\" for their return 
are reportedly ongoing.  In a statement to al-Sahwa-net, the 
on-line newspaper of the Islah party, Dr. al-Dali mentioned 
that several high-level exiles were considering returning to 
Yemen soon, including: 
 
--  Haidar Abu-Baker al-Attas, among the \"16\" and former 
Prime Minister of the ROYG and former PDRY President of the 
Supreme People\'s Council 
 
--  Yassin Saeed Noman, former Speaker of the first 
post-unity Parliament and former PDRY Prime Minister (Note: 
He is popular and widely regarded by all political forces. 
End Note) 
 
--  Mohamed Saeed Abdullah Muhsen, former Minister of what is 
now called the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and 
former PDRY Minister of State Security. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Comment:  What\'s in it for Saleh? 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (c) Before the 1994 conflict, the YSP was seen as a 
counter-balancing force to the tribal, Islamist and military 
influences in Yemen.  Many observers view the returnee 
initiative as an attempt to keep influential forces balanced 
against each other in a political scene where maintaining a 
power equilibrium is one of President Saleh\'s primary 
objectives (along with following the adage keep your friends 
close but your enemies closer).  Some believe Saleh wants to 
ensure the Republic of Yemen can never be split again into 
north and south by keeping close tabs on the PDRY\'s former 
leaders.  His recent appointment of former YSP Assistant 
Secretary General Salem Saleh, a 2002 returnee, as one of his 
 
SIPDIS 
advisors supports these views (septel).  Saleh\'s repetition 
of his call to the so-called \"list of 16\" soon after the 
April 2003 elections was probably also fueled by such 
concerns.  Despite the overwhelming win by the ruling party 
majority in the election, the opposition Islamist and tribal 
Islah party made significant gains in Sanaa, including in the 
President\'s constituency.  Some observers also believe that 
the ROYG may be under pressure from the countries harboring 
the exiles to allow returns, because many of these countries 
provide financial support to the exiles.  End Comment.

1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened an EAC 
meeting on September 1 to consider a Department Threat 
Advisory (reftel).  Also discussed was the lack of credible 
and specific recent threat reporting on American targets in 
Yemen, the impending al-Moayad extradition, the official 
designation of Shaykh Zindani as a supporter of terrorism, 
and the need to convene a warden meeting.  Key offices and 
personnel represented at the meeting included:  POL/ECON, 
CONS, MO, FPD, ORCA, DAO, OMC, and SOC YEMEN.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  DCM briefed the cable describing the continuing 
threat from Al-Qaeda to targets in the Persian Gulf region, 
East Asia, Africa and CONUS.  Attendees concurred with the 
cable\'s observation that the enemy remains active, and that 
host government support to counter the threat must be 
sustained and enhanced.  ORCA and OMC briefed recent intel 
relating to potential security threats in Yemen.  EAC members 
agreed that there was no credible information indicating a 
current heightened threat in Yemen.  Nevertheless, attendees 
agreed on the need to continue good personal security 
practices, including continuing to vary routes and times. 
 
3.  (C)  DCM updated events surrounding the continued 
incarceration of Hafez al-Moayad in Germany.  The case has 
been remanded to the Frankfurt regional court, where it is 
likely to remain for several weeks.  The case will then 
return to the Supreme Court level where it might be delayed 
again for several weeks before final adjudication.  Available 
information indicates that al-Moayad\'s extradition to the 
United States is likely to be affirmed.  The DCM commented 
that the post is following events closely and will 
re-evaluate the security situation and any potential threats 
against American targets at the time of the final extradition. 
 
4.  (C)  DCM updated events surrounding the USG designation 
of Shaykh Zindani as a supporter of terrorism.  The DCM noted 
that the Zindani case differs from al-Moayad in that Zindani 
is an ideologue and minor Islah party official who enjoys 
less-widespread support than al-Moayad.  DCM reiterated that 
the ROYG has been informed of the pending designation, but 
that the official U.S. declaration has been put on hold. 
 
5.  (C)  Finally, the EAC agreed on the need to schedule an 
early warden meeting to reiterate caution against \"soft 
targets\".  Consul had recently returned from meeting wardens 
in the south and noted that given the likely 
end-of-summer/post-war return of Amcits to Yemen a warden 
meeting would be beneficial.  The EAC decided to schedule a 
warden meeting in the near term.

1. (u) Summary: Minister of Industry and Trade Khaled Rajeh 
Sheikh will lead the Yemeni delegation to the WTO ministerial 
in Cancun.  Yemen is moving steadily forward on WTO accession 
and expects to accede in 3-5 years.  The European Commission 
(EC) is launching a five-year, seven million Euro project to 
provide technical assistance to Yemen\'s accession.  While the 
ROYG is pushing accession, the business community is voicing 
strong concerns over Yemen\'s preparedness.  End summary.

2. (u) Minister of Industry and Trade Khaled Rajeh Sheikh and 
Advisor to the Minister and Chief of WTO Coordination and 
Communication Nagib Hamim will travel to Cancun for the WTO 
Ministerial, September 10-14.  Hamim told Pol/Econ Chief and 
Pol/Econoff on August 25 that the ROYG was examining the 
accession process of Nepal and Cambodia, in order to obtain a 
more favorable accession agreement for Yemen.  Hamim said 
that the ROYG is also monitoring the outcome of the 
discussion on agricultural subsidies.  Commenting that Yemen 
is a net food importer, Hamim said he supports a gradual 
reduction in agricultural subsidies.

WTO Accession Still 3-5 Years Out 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (u) Deputy Minister Iqbal Bahder told participants at the 
June 23-25 Ministry of Industry and Trade sponsored National 
Integrated Framework (IF) Workshop that he expects Yemen\'s 
WTO accession to take 3-5 years.  The purpose of the workshop 
was to review the results of the Diagnostic Trade and 
Integration Studies on Yemen completed in 2002.  Government 
and non-government representatives determined an action plan 
to enhance and strengthen the ROYG economy.  Several 
academics and Islah-oriented businessmen criticized the IF 
study for neglecting the ROYG role in job creation.  The 
completed action plan focuses on infrastructure development, 
building roads, job-training, and improving the quality of 
exports. 
 
4. (u) The Dutch, who are the ROYG\'s partner in the IF 
process, circulated the action plan to the donor community 
and will hold meetings throughout the Fall to coordinate 
assistance plans.  At the same time, ROYG officials will 
combine the results of the IF study with the World Bank\'s 
Poverty Reduction Strategy into a single reform strategy. 
 
5. (u) According to Hamim, Yemen is finalizing its answers to 
the 167 questions submitted from the U.S., EC and Australia 
on Yemen\'s Memorandum of Foreign Trade Regime. Hamim expects 
the questions to be answered by the end of the year, which 
will enable Yemen to have its working party meeting early in 
2004.  On a recent visit to Geneva, Hamim obtained approval 
for two outreach seminars funded by Geneva to discuss WTO 
accession with academics and parliamentarians, which will be 
held this fall.

6. (c) Head of the Yemen office of the European Commission 
Reiner Schierhorst (protect) described to Pol/Econ Chief and 
Pol/Econoff the EC\'s five-year 7 million Euro program to 
assist Yemen in its accession process on August 27.  The EC 
will fund a WTO advisor at the Ministry of Industry and Trade 
to oversee its program, which includes assistance for 
accession, institutional strengthening and public awareness. 
Comment: Schierhorst said that, in a unique arrangement for 
the EC, the chief will be ROYG WTO Advisor Nagib Hamim. 
Hamim did not mention this to Embassy officials, and post 
requests that this information remain close-hold until 
publicly announced.  End comment. 
 
7. (c) Officials from the EC are in Sanaa the week of 
September 6-10 to initiate the program.  Schierhorst said 
that the one area that he felt the program did not cover was 
small and medium size enterprise development.  He supports 
such an initiative,  but a team from Brussels visited Yemen 
and concluded that Yemen lacked the business environment  to 
enable the program to operate. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Business Community: ROYG Not Prepared 
------------------------------------- 
 
8. (c) Pol/Econoff raised WTO accession with several 
businessmen affiliated with both major political parties (GPC 
and Islah) and the Sanaa Chamber of Commerce.  Most believe 
that the ROYG does not have the economic infrastructure to 
support accession.  National Trading Company (NATCO) Manager 
Nabil Hayel Saeed (protect) conceded that WTO accession is 
inevitable, but told Pol/Econoff that the ROYG does not have 
the customs, border and tax authorities to support WTO 
membership.  According to Saeed, NATCO, which operates the 
Hewlett-Packard license for Yemen, faces stiff competition 
from smuggled computers.  Saeed stated that 80 percent of 
printers and 50 percent of computers were smuggled into 
Yemen, and expressed fear that his business will suffer with 
further reduction in trade barriers. 
 
9. (c) Ahmed Bazara (protect), the Toyota distributor and 
member of the Sanaa Chamber of Commerce, explained that 
because Yemen has poor quality control mechanisms and lacks 
industrial products to trade on a world market, accession 
would likely have negative consequences for the Yemeni 
economy.  Echoing Saeed\'s comments, Bazara said that Yemen is 
just not ready to compete on the world market. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Comment: Marketing WTO Accession to Public 
------------------------------------------ 
 
10. (c) Comment: The ROYG is moving steadily forward on WTO 
accession, with or without public support.  New initiatives 
funded by Geneva to reach out to academics and 
parliamentarians may help, but the businessmen Post has 
spoken to are looking for concrete improvements in government 
services.  The ROYG has a tough road ahead in securing public 
acceptance of WTO accession if even the businessmen who trade 
in western goods and services do not support accession.  End 
comment.

for reasons 1.5, b and d 
 
1. (s) Answers are keyed to reftel questions.  See reftel b 
for more information on prominent exiles returning to Yemen. 
 
2. (s) Salim Salih Muhammad: 
 
A. (s/nf)  Why did President Saleh appoint Muhammad as his 
special advisor when he was Saleh\'s former political rival? 
 
President Saleh has been keen on reconciliation with those 
leaders of the former PDRY who were exiled (or who exiled 
themselves) after the 1994 war.  Observers believe his 
motives for seeking reconciliation are complicated and 
include several elements.  Some believe he wants to ensure 
the Republic of Yemen can never be split again into north and 
south by keeping close tabs on the PDRY\'s former leaders. 
Others argue that President Saleh wants to balance tribal, 
military and Islamist influences through high-level 
appointments such as Salim Salih\'s. 
 
B. (s/nf) How is Muhammad viewed in Yemen? 
 
Views about Salim Salih vary depending on one\'s political 
views.  General People\'s Congress (GPC) members would tend to 
think he\'s \"come to his senses\" by joining the government, 
while YSP members and other oppositionists would view him as 
an opportunist who is just seeking a government position and 
power.  He is also a long-time advocate for merging political 
parties, particularly YSP and GPC, both during early 
unification period and more recently in informal gatherings. 
Because he keeps a fairly low profile, it is unclear how the 
general public views him. 
 
C. (s/nf) What kind of influence does Muhammad have in the 
Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP)? 
 
Salim Salih formally remains a politburo member of the YSP. 
However, there is no evidence that he ever attends meetings, 
nor do YSP leaders cite him as one of their leaders. 
 
D. (s/nf) What are his leadership and personality traits -- 
does he have any influence or base beyond his YSP 
connections, e.g., among tribes or military officers? 
 
He is a prominent member of the Yafaa tribe, which is one of 
two tribes which has kept to strong tribal ways in the south. 
 The Yafaas are located in Lahaj governorate, although many 
of the most prominent leaders are businessmen in the southern 
port city of Aden.  While he is considered a leader, he is 
not a shaykh.  He does not appear to have mass popularity or 
a strong base beyond his tribe. 
 
In July 2003, rumors circulated in Yemen that Salim Salih was 
being groomed for the Vice Presidency.  The ROYG 
Vice-president Abdo-Rabo Mansoor was out of the country at 
the time.  The rumors speculated that President Saleh would 
appoint him Deputy Chairman of the GPC at the next party 
congress, a position held by VP Mansoor.  Rumors further 
noted that the President would appoint him Vice-President 
soon thereafter.  (Note: Mansoor was the leader of a group of 
southerners called Zumra who fled to the north after YSP 
in-fighting in 1986.  In 1994, the same group fought 
prominently on the side of the north.  End note)  These 
rumors have died down significantly since the return of 
Mansoor to Yemen later in July. 
 
3. (u) Additional bio notes: Salim Salih Muhammed is commonly 
known as \"Salim Salih.\"  He was born in 1948 in Yafa\'a in the 
Lahj governorate, and is married with children.  He graduated 
from Belqis College in Aden.  From 1980 to 1985, he was 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People\'s Democratic 
Republic of Yemen (PDRY).  He was first elected Assistant 
Secretary General of the YSP after the bloody infighting of 
 
SIPDIS 
YSP factions in 1986.  From 1990 to 1994, he was Assistant 
Secretary General of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and 
 
SIPDIS 
member of the Presidential Council of the Republic of Yemen. 
Salih was a member of the Presidential Council of the 
proclaimed separatist government of the South during the 1994 
war (May to July).  His 1994 to 2002 exile in the United Arab 
Emirates ended when President Saleh appointed him an advisor 
in May 2003.  End bio notes. 
 
4. (s) Abdullah al-Ahmar: 
 
A. (s/nf) As the reappointed Speaker of Parliament and the 
leader of Islah, how has his relationship with President 
Saleh changed since the Islah party lost votes in the April 
27 election? 
 
It appears that the relationship has worsened, although it is 
by no means ended.  President Saleh called al-Ahmar \"senile\" 
in a televised interview with al-Jazeera in July 2003, 
shocking many observers.  (Comment:  None of the newspaper 
accounts of the interview mentioned the quote and it appears 
that a lid has been placed on discussion of the topic to 
prevent an escalation of personal tensions.  End comment.) 
At the same time, the general rhetoric against Islah by 
GPC-affiliated newspapers and commentators has increased, in 
some cases calling Islah the \"taliban\" and hinting at terror 
connections. 
 
B. (s/nf) Is his tribal position of less importance now than 
before -- did the election results diminish his influence 
with the tribes? 
 
There is no evidence that the election results have had any 
negative effect on his strong influence with the tribes. 
 
C. (s/nf) Are he and Salih equals, rivals or partners? 
 
They are both rivals and partners.  Al-Ahmar and Salih are 
not equals, but both have immense influence in different 
spheres.  Saleh\'s personal control of Yemen\'s executive 
apparatus, particularly the government\'s revenue stream, 
budget process and -- above all -- the military, place Saleh 
in a pre-emininent position.  (Comment:  It appears that 
Salih no longer needs al-Ahmar like he did during and 
immediately after the 1994 conflict, when the Islah party and 
al-Ahmar played key roles in winning the war.  Their 
partnership appears to come into play only when both sides 
have something to protect or to gain from it. End comment.) 
 
D. (s/nf) What is Abdallah al-Ahmar\'s familial/tribal 
relationship with President Saleh? 
 
Al-Ahmar is Paramount Shaykh of the Hashid federation, of 
which President Saleh is only a member.  There do not appear 
to be familial ties between them. 
 
E. (s/nf) What is his (Abdallah al-Ahmar\'s) relationship with 
Shaykh Zindani, for example, has he distanced himself from 
Zindani because of terrorism connections? 
 
Al-Ahmar\'s exact relationship with Zindani is unclear, but 
does not appear to be close.  During the election period, 
President Saleh gave Zindani a prominent role in the 
committee to ensure a Code of Conduct between the parties for 
a peaceful election.  (Comment: Saleh\'s aims were probably 
two-fold, both trying to encourage a split by Islah\'s 
factions (tribal, religious and business) and highlighting 
the extreme side of Islah.  End comment.)   Before that, 
Zindani had been keeping a low profile in the aftermath of 
the 9/11 attacks. 
 
F. (s/nf) Is he (al-Ahmar) as moderate and against terrorism 
as he claims to be or is there more of a story here? 
 
Al-Ahmar\'s rhetoric claims to be against terrorism, and Post 
has no evidence that there is \"more of a story.\"  Some 
government measures to combat terrorism have been stymied by 
al-Ahmar, but the stated reasons are not linked to not 
wanting to fight terror.  For example, the ROYG\'s efforts to 
strengthen their gun control law have been stopped by 
al-Ahmar, but on cultural and traditionalist tribal grounds 
(where the carrying of weapons is an important symbol) and 
for reasons of personal power. 
 
G. (s/nf) What information do you have on his (al-Ahmar\'s) 
sons, i.e., do they still have drinking problems and are 
disliked? 
 
The sons are still widely disliked, and seemingly for good 
reason.  For example, a wide-ranging shoot-out near the 
British Embassy in Sanaa in late 2002 was a direct result of 
one of the son\'s bodyguards shooting at British Embassy 
guards when they tried to limit the al-Ahmars\' ability to 
park near the Embassy.  The sons have also expanded their 
influence in political and business circles.  For example, 
four al-Ahmar sons (from both the Islah and GPC parties) are 
now members of Parliament, causing many to joke that their 
caucus rivals that of the YSP (which has seven members). 
 
H. (s/nf) Is he (al-Ahmar) still on the Saudi payroll? 
 
It is not known if al-Ahmar remains on the Saudi payroll, but 
he clearly has ties to the country.  For example, in August 
2003 he returned from the KSA after seeking medical 
treatment.  In 2000, he was instrumental in helping to broker 
the Yemen-Saudi border agreement. 
 
I. (s/nf) Does he (al-Ahmar) retain other prominent foreign 
connections? 
 
Some of his family members have married tribal leaders in 
other countries.  For example, in June 2003 his daughter was 
allegedly killed by her husband, a tribal leader in Jordan. 
 
J. (s/nf)  What are his (al-Ahmar\'s) major business/property 
interests? 
 
The al-Ahmar Group is involved in the oil and gas services 
industry and imports military and police equipment.  The 
group is also a major shareholder of SabaFon, one of the two 
prominent mobile communications companies in Yemen, and is 
part owner of Sabaa Islamic Bank and Universal Travel.  The 
group also owns franchises for Kentucky Fried Chicken and 
Baskin Robbins.  The Al-Ahmar family are reputed to be 
heavily invested in qat production. 
 
K. (s/nf) Do these affect/shape his (al-Ahmar\'s) politics to 
any agree? 
 
He appears to be able to separate his politics from his 
business interests.  For example, during the most recent war 
in Iraq, al-Ahmar called loudly for a boycott of American 
products, but he never closed his Kentucky Fried Chicken or 
Baskin Robbins franchises.

NEA/PPD FOR DMACINNES, JDAVIES, JGAFFNEY 
 
 
1.   SUMMARY: U.S. President George W. Bush\'s speech on 
September 7 has so far been mentioned only in one government 
and one opposition paper.  The opposition paper, which is 
usually very anti-American, only published excerpts of the 
speech with no commentary.  Only the government paper 
carried commentary.  Most newspapers in Yemen have not yet 
published since the President\'s speech last Monday.  Instead 
of focusing on the President\'s speech, press reports in 
general have rather focused on the 2nd anniversary of 
September 11 and its ramifications in the Arab region. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. \"Al-Thawra\" (official daily) published excerpts of 
President Bush\'s address to the nation in its publication 
last Monday.  The paper highlighted President Bush\'s call on 
the UN to play a wider role in Iraq, which has become a 
central front in the war on terrorism.  On 09/09, \"Al- 
Thawra\" carried an opinion article entitled \"The 
Babylonians\' Curse.\"  The article indicated that Bush\'s 
speech carried a confession that Iraq has turned into a 
difficult front for the US to face.  The paper added that 
\"President Bush is facing the curse of the Babylonians at 
the economic and military levels\". 
 
3.  Without commenting on the speech, the typically anti- 
American Al-Balagh independent weekly, published excerpts of 
the speech highlighting the objectives of the US strategy in 
Iraq as stated in the President\'s speech as to  \"destroy the 
terrorists, enlist the support of other nations for a free 
Iraq and help Iraqis assume responsibility for their own 
defense and their own Future.\" 
 
4.   The majority of Yemen press articles are focusing on 
ramifications of September 11 and continue to argue that the 
US anti-terror campaign launched two years ago did not 
achieve its objectives but rather increased anti-US 
sentiments in the region.  The government-owned weekly, al- 
Wahda, once argued that \"the US is targeting Arabs and Islam 
in general . it\'s creating enemies to serve its colonial 
interests worldwide.\"

E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/16/2013 
TAGS: PINR, POLM, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM 
SUBJECT: MAKING THE MONEY WORK IN YEMEN; ON-GOING SUPPORT 
FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (b and d). 
 
1. (u) This is an action request.  See paragraph 6. 
 
2. (s/nf) Summary/comment:  We need to stay engaged with the 
Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) to ensure that Yemen 
continues to support U.S. counter-terrorism efforts.  In 
order to be successful, we must both continue current levels 
of assistance -- both for security and for economic 
development -- and find ways to sustain and expand the 
programs we have created.  In 2003, the ROYG publicly 
designated their Ministry of Interior\'s Central Security 
Force (CSF), the National Counter-terrorist (CT) Force of 
Yemen.  This was due in large part to the specialized 
training the unit received  from U.S. and U.K. military 
personnel.  In the short while since the unit\'s designation 
as Yemen\'s National CT Force, they have conducted several 
successful CT operations.  However, sources of funding for 
this unit are severely limited.  We need to stay engaged with 
the ROYG, and the CSF in particular, to ensure that Yemen 
continues to take aggressive action against terrorism and 
does not revert to being a haven for extremists or 
terrorists.  If the U.S. expects the ROYG to be a useful 
partner in CT matters, a solution for sustainable funding 
will have to be found.  End summary/comment. 
 
3. (s/nf) Training and materiel support for the Central 
Security Force 
(CSF) is the cornerstone of our CT engagement in Yemen.  The 
CSF\'s 
participation and outstanding performance in a July 2003 
operation in Abyan to defeat terrorists who had attacked a 
ROYG medical convoy the previous month is an obvious example 
of the benefits of providing this training.  Elements of the 
Ministry of Defense along with Ministry of Interior 
U.S.-trained CSF soldiers killed or arrested the terrorists, 
who were holed up in caves.  In April 2003, this 50-member 
unit also captured Hamza Majali and Fawaz Al-Rabii AKA 
Furqan.  Furqan was a designated USCENTCOM High Value Target 
(HVT).  The CSF are training hard and operating aggressively 
against terrorism in Yemen.  They represent our most notable 
success in getting the ROYG to take action and we currently 
do not have a reliable, long-term solution for funding 
engagement with this unit. 
 
4. (s/nf) Military offices at Post have utilized a variety of 
sources to fund training the CSF to date.  The training 
conducted in FY 2003 was funded using Title 10, Commander\'s 
Initiative Funds (CIF).  These funds were authorized by the 
Joint Staff but are not allowed to be used on the same 
project two years in a row.  Fortunately, USCENTCOM recently 
received some FY 2003 CT Supplemental funds and has agreed to 
cover the costs of training the CSF throughout FY 2004 using 
these funds.  However, CIF and CT Supplemental funds are 
neither reliable nor sufficient to maintain long-term, 
productive engagement with the CSF. 
 
5. (s/nf) Foreign Military Funding (FMF) and/or International 
Military Education and Training (IMET) monies would appear to 
be possible long-term solutions, but there are legislative 
constraints against using FMF or IMET funds for training 
outside the control of a country\'s Ministry of Defense.  This 
issue was brought to the attention of Senate Select Committee 
on Intelligence (SSCI) Staffer Randy Bookout and General 
Counsel Richard Douglas when they visited Sana\'a in August. 
Bookout and Douglas suggested the possibility of a 
legislative fix to expand the scope of permissible uses for 
FMF funding and promised their support for a solution in 
Washington. 
 
6. (s/nf)  Action request:  I would like to request your 
assistance resolving this issue and identifying an on-going 
source of funding for sustaining U.S.-Yemen military 
cooperation with the CSF.

SUBJECT: TRIBAL ATTACK ON U.S. OIL PIPELINE LIKELY 
REPRESENTS ANTI-ROYG, NOT ANTI-USG SENTIMENTS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5. (b and d) 
 
1. (s/nf) Summary:  On September 12, tribal elements 
succeeded in damaging U.S.-based Yemen Hunt Oil Company\'s 
pipeline approximately 60 kilometers from the Marib 
production facility.  A single explosion from an IED of 
unknown specifications made three or four holes in the 
pipeline.  No personnel were injured.  The pipeline was shut 
down for repairs and operations resumed approximately 24 
hours after the incident.  End summary. 
 
2. (s/nf) According to Yemen Hunt\'s General Manager, a 
pipeline leak was reported at 8 a.m. on September 12 and the 
pipeline was shut down at 9 a.m.  There were 3-4 holes in the 
pipeline, the largest of which was about 4 inches in 
diameter.  Note: The 420-kilometer-long pipeline carries oil 
from production fields in Marib to the deep sea port of Ras 
Isa on the Red Sea.  End note.  There were no injuries, and 
Hunt will provide Embassy with an estimate of lost oil when 
available.  Hunt Security Chief said the actual incident took 
place about 4 a.m.  Repairs were delayed until about 10 p.m. 
that day because of the location of the damage, approximately 
60 km from the Marib production facility, and were completed 
at approximately 5:00 a.m.  The company resumed full 
production shortly thereafter. 
 
3. (s/nf) The pipeline was damaged in the Sirwah region of 
Marib province, northeast of the capital Sanaa.  ROYG 
military have secured the location.  Initial investigation by 
Hunt indicated the damage was caused by the explosion of a 
single IED of unknown specifications.  Local press reported 
that government officials in Sanaa believe the attackers 
belong to the Jahm tribe, and that the attack was to protest 
the arrest of fellow tribesmen by Sanaa police last month. 
Note: Sirwah is the stronghold of the Jahm tribe, known in 
past years for kidnappings of foreigners and occasional 
bombings calculated to obtain benefits/services from the 
ROYG; most notorious was the July 2001 kidnap of a German 
diplomat.  End note. 
 
4. (s/nf) Ministry of Interior Chief of Staff, Brigadier 
General Ahmed al-Sunaidar confirmed to RSO that there is 
security posted on the above-ground portions of the pipeline. 
 The absence of security in the area where the explosion took 
place was due to the fact that the section of pipe was in an 
isolated area previously covered by sand, which shifted, 
leaving the pipe exposed.  Sunaidar committed the MOI to 
investigate the incident and to arrest the perpetrators. 
Because it is very remote, there is no American citizen 
travel warning to the area of the incident. 
 
5. (s/nf) Comment:  Tribal interests have occasionally 
targeted the Hunt pipeline in years past.  The September 12 
pipeline attack is notable because it is the first such 
action against the pipeline in well over a year.  Based on 
available information, it appears that the ROYG was the 
intended target of disgruntled tribe members, likely in 
retaliation for the recent arrest of Zaidi shaykhs in Sana\'a. 
 There is no evidence of anti-U.S. intent per se.  End 
comment.

ARTICLE 98; DIPLOMATIC POUCH 
 
REF: SANAA 1450 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: In a 9/16 meeting with Ambassador, FM Qirbi 
said Yemen would welcome a visit by the Iraqi Governing 
Council \"at any time.\"  He expressed Yemeni support for early 
return of Iraqi sovereignty, and proposed a dialogue to 
engage AL member states constructively in the process.  Qirbi 
suggested a meeting between the Arab Group and Secretary 
Powell on the margins of the UNGA as a possible way to open 
such a dialogue.  In response to Ambassador\'s push for Yemeni 
action on Article 98, Qirbi offered no substantive reply but 
said he would be prepared to re-engage on the issue soon. 
After detailed discussion of the failed 8/31 diplomatic 
support flight, Qirbi agreed to a return flight on 10/5 and 
pledged full Yemeni support.  Action requests paras 8 and 11. 
 End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Yemen Days 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) Ambassador began by briefing Qirbi on the success of 
the 9/4-5 Yemen Days cultural festival at the Smithsonian, 
which drew crowds far in excess of expectations.  On the 
margins of the event Yemeni Human Rights Minister al-Soswa 
and former PM al-Iryani had productive meetings with senior 
U.S. officials, and a Yemeni business delegation also had 
useful contacts. 
 
3. (C) Qirbi hailed the Yemen Days event as a significant 
step toward correcting Yemen\'s undeserved negative image. 
Later in the meeting he also expressed the ROYG\'s protest at 
the extreme delays and harsh treatment some of the Yemeni 
businessmen received at Dulles Airport.  Ambassador 
underscored efforts the Department made to ensure smooth 
airport transit for people and materiel arriving in 
Washington for Yemen Days, and apologized for the delays and 
hassles that did occur.  He pledged that the Embassy would in 
future redouble its effort to avoid security-related delays 
for Yemeni officials and others visiting the United States at 
USG invitation, but that the continuing need for heightened 
homeland security made this difficult to guarantee. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Iraq: Door is Open for IGC Visit to Yemen 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4. (C) Ambassador noted that Deputy Secretary Armitage had 
raised the recent postponement of a planned visit to Yemen by 
representatives of the Iraqi Governing Council.  Qirbi said 
the delay had come from the Iraqi side as a result of 
internal political developments and security issues.  Qirbi 
stressed that \"they are welcome at any time,\" and that 
Yemen\'s embassy in Baghdad was prepared to coordinate 
scheduling.  Qirbi said he understood the IGC was studying an 
early visit to Qatar, Yemen and Sudan. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Qirbi: Need for U.S.-AL Dialogue on Iraq 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5. (C) Qirbi expressed satisfaction with the decision by the 
Arab League ministerial to seat Iraqi FM Zebari.  Qirbi said 
he had useful discussions with Zebari in Cairo, and said he 
hoped AL acceptance would help the IGC \"get things moving\" in 
Iraq.  Yemen\'s position is not mere acceptance of the interim 
Iraqi government, but active support for constructive 
measures to hasten the return of full Iraqi sovereignty. 
This is because ROYG sees the integrity and stability of Iraq 
as crucial for the stability of the region. 
 
6. (C) Accordingly, said Qirbi, now that the IGC has received 
\"universal recognition by the Arabs\" the time has come for 
dialogue on Iraq between AL members and the occupying 
authorities in Iraq.  He observed that the Secretary\'s 
remarks in Baghdad, especially on the need for a UN role, had 
been positive, but argued that international engagement 
should include a role for the Arab League.  The coalition 
should engage the Arabs in advancing the return of 
sovereignty, said Qirbi, and aim to keep shared national 
objectives, rather than narrow ethnic or religious 
affiliations, at the forefront of the process inside Iraq. 
 
7. (C) Qirbi suggested that one possible framework for 
opening such a dialogue would be a meeting between the Arab 
Group and Secretary Powell on the margins of the UNGA.  In 
addition, Saleh might raise it with CINC Abizaid on his 
(9/20) visit to Yemen. 
 
-------------------------- 
USG Visits to Yemen 
-------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Ambassador briefed Qirbi on upcoming visits to Yemen 
by CINC Abizaid (9/20), FBI Director Mueller (9/28) and 
possibly NEA A/S Burns (10/3 or 4).  FM Qirbi welcomed the 
visits, but noted that he would not return from the UNGA 
until 10/4, and asked that A/S Burns coordinate his timing to 
allow for that return. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Diplomatic Pouch/Support Flights 
----------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Ambassador expressed serious USG concern over Yemen\'s 
non-cooperation with the 8/31 diplomatic support flight, 
stressing that Deputy Secretary Armitage had raised the issue 
with Iryani in Washington.  After extended discussion, Qirbi 
agreed to the scheduling of a return flight on 10/5 and 
pledged full Yemeni cooperation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Article 98: ROYG Still reviewing Options 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
10. (C) The Ambassador urged Qirbi to focus actively on the 
ICC issue and move quickly toward concluding an Article 98 
agreement.  He stressed the need for this important follow-up 
to U/S Bolton\'s June visit.   Qirbi noted that the Yemeni 
Parliament had not ratified the ICC convention, and said the 
ROYG was still reviewing the materials provided by Embassy 
Sanaa (reftel and previous).  He undertook to renew 
discussion of the issue soon with Ambassador.  (Note: In a 
9/15 meeting with DCM, MFA Under Secretary Hussein Taher bin 
Yahia noted that \"several levels\" of the ROYG were studying 
the Article 98 question.  He indicated that some were 
concerned at the obviously one-sided benefit that such an 
agreement would impart, but predicted movement in the near 
term.  End Note.) 
 
------------ 
Comment 
------------ 
 
11. (C) Despite Yemen\'s limited regional influence, FM Qirbi 
has made positive efforts on Iraq, including advocacy leading 
to the AL decision to seat the Iraqi delegation.  We believe 
his proposal of a NY meeting to engage Arab states 
constructively in Iraq is sincere and well intended.  We 
recommend serious consideration and welcome feedback.

1. (C) Hunt Oil director Karim Abuhamad provided Ambassador 
September 15 further information and his assessment of recent 
attack on Hunt Oil pipeline (reftel).  Abuhamad who has long 
experience in Yemen and with the pipeline, noted the attack 
was extremely sophisticated in that the saboteurs picked the 
point of greatest vulnerability, i.e., the lowest point in 
the region.  This location meant the pipeline was under 
maximum pressure at the point of attack and Hunt repair teams 
required a prolonged period to decrease the pipeline pressure 
to permit repairs. The charge itself was buried eight feet 
underground and represented considerable effort on the part 
of the saboteurs. 
 
2. (C) Abuhamad believes saboteurs were from the Zayidi clan 
of the Jahm tribe.  He noted that the Yemeni government has 
recently detained significant numbers of this clan as a 
result of altercations between security forces and the clan 
in Sana\'a.  The Zayidi are using this attack to embarrass 
President Saleh, Abuhamad said, and further attacks are 
expected by Hunt.  Three individuals have been detained as 
suspects, but Abuhamad did not know if they were involved in 
the attack. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT:  The Zayidi clan have embarrassed President 
Saleh previously, for example by kidnapping a German national 
in December 2001 while President Saleh was visiting Berlin.

assassination of Jarallah Omar, deputy secretary-general of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) (ref a), and plotting the

Rights Watch (HRW) in a letter sent to President Saleh in 
mid-August 2003.  The letter requested a \"special 
investigation. . .to be conducted in a thorough and impartial 
manner, into all aspects of this crime, and to make the 
results public.\"  The letter noted \"serious and widespread 
allegations about possible involvement. . .by government 
security officials and prominent Salifi political figures\" in 
addition to its concerns about victim family access to the 
results of the state investigation.  Post is unaware of an 
official ROYG response to this letter to date. 
 
3. (c) Post has not been able to determine whether a 
comprehensive investigation was conducted, but news reports 
indicate that 5-7 accomplices were also convicted and 
sentenced to jail time, while other suspects were acquitted. 
Post anticipates that al-Jarallah will appeal his sentence. 
The YSP has formed a coalition of opposition groups, 
journalists and sympathizers to continue to protest the 
handling of the matter and demand a more public airing of 
al-Jarallah\'s background and connections. 
 
4. (c) Abed Abdul Razak Kamal was sentenced to death in May 
2003 for the actual murder of the three Americans in Jibla, 
which al-Jarallah is believed to have helped plan (refs b and 
c).  Kamal\'s trial was held in the governorate of Jibla, at a 
state court level.  In contrast to the Sana\'a court, the 
Jibla court proceedings have been open to the public and post 
officials have attended a number of sessions.  Kamal\'s appeal 
is still pending and is expected to take up to a year. 
 
5. (c) Comment: The motivations for keeping the investigation 
of al-Jarallah\'s activities and the court proceedings in his 
case under wraps are not obvious.  The prevailing public 
opinion is that the government wanted the matter resolved 
relatively quickly and preferred to treat it as a criminal 
matter rather than investigating it as a political 
assassination or delving too deeply (and publicly) into 
al-Jarallah\'s potential links to terrorist groups.  The ROYG 
may also be trying to garner favor with the U.S. by quickly 
convicting and sentencing the alleged mastermind of the Jibla 
murders.  End comment.

Classified By: DCM Alan G. Misenheimer for reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1. (s/nf) Summary:  Post has determined from various ROYG 
sources, informed journalists and the Egyptian Embassy that 
9/16 media reports that an Egyptian diplomat was kidnapped in 
Sanaa were overstated.  While sources provide a range of 
variant \"facts\" and posit wildly differing motives for the 
assailant (including a 1995 arms deal gone awry), the 9/16 
incident does not/not appear to presage any heightened threat 
to Americans or other diplomats, nor to herald a return to 
the long-gone bad old days of tribal kidnappings in Yemen. 
Notably, the 9/16 episode has no visible connection with the 
GOE\'s detention of Hillah.  End summary. 
 
2. (s/nf) On September 16 Reuters reported that an Egyptian 
diplomat, possibly the Military Attach, was kidnapped by 3 
or 4 armed Yemeni tribesmen from a car with Egyptian mission 
diplomatic plates, but was released after a police chase 
(refs b-d).  Post immediately sought details from police and 
security authorities as well as informed journalists and the 
Egyptian Embassy.  Journalists\' reflexive (but 
unsubstantiated) assumption that this was a tribal kidnapping 
by the Beni Hosheish calculated to press the GOE to release 
Hillah shaped initial reporting, but subsequently proved to 
be untrue. 
 
3. (c) Yemeni police and security sources played down the 
incident from the outset, and Embassy\'s eventual success in 
contacting the Egyptian MilAtt himself (who denied that he or 
any of his colleagues had been kidnapped) during the evening 
of 9/16 confirmed that the lurid initial published reports 
were distorted. 
 
4. (c) Early on 9/17 the official Saba news agency carried an 
account of the \"kidnapping\" that proved only vaguely 
consistent with divergent accounts provided to Embassy Sanaa 
by other sources during the day.  While Saba held that an 
Egyptian embassy driver was kidnapped by individuals hoping 
to press the GOE on an unspecified financial dispute, police 
sources told Embassy contacts the incident consisted of an 
attempted kidnapping by a single assailant.  A journalist 
connected with the Presidency stood by the kidnapping 
account, adding that the perpetrators were tribal elements 
from Shabwa province.  A top security official provided a 
variant story and added carjacking as another motivation of 
the perpetrator. 
 
5. (s/nf) Also on 9/17, Pol/Econ Chief met with Egyptian 
Political Counselor Hossam el-Din Salama, who characterized 
the incident as \"harassment\" rather than kidnapping, and 
added arms trafficking as another angle.  Salama said that in 
1995 a Yemeni named Ali Mansour purchased arms from Bulgaria 
for shipment to Yemen via Egypt.  The weapons were reportedly 
seized in Egypt because of a \"lack of paperwork.\"  According 
to Salama, within the last week Mansour contacted the 
Egyptian Military Attach to complain about the situation and 
was told to work through the Yemeni Ministry of Defense. 
Salama played down the 9/16 incident, but was evasive on 
exactly what Mansour had done, and on whether he acted alone 
or with tribal accomplices. 
 
6. (s/nf) Comment: Despite the varying accounts of the story, 
all sources agree on facts central to U.S. interests and 
security of Embassy Sanaa personnel: (a) There is no/no 
indication of a link between the 9/16 incident and Hillah; 
(b) There is no/no reason to believe the incident was 
ideologically motivated; and (c) there is no evidence of a 
heightened general threat of kidnapping (tribal or otherwise) 
against Egyptian, American or other diplomats in Yemen. 
Nevertheless, post will continue to pluck at the disparate 
strands of the story, and a scheduled courtesy call on 
Ambassador next week by the new Egyptian Ambassador may offer 
further insights.

Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (a), (d) 
 
1. (S/NF) Summary: In his first visit to Yemen, GEN Abizaid, 
CDR USCENTCOM, met with the Country Team and called 
separately on Chief of Staff Qasimi (septel) and President 
Saleh.  Saleh briefed the CDR on the ROYG\'s discovery and 
arrest of a terrorist cell over the previous few days.  Saleh 
revealed that the cell had planned to target the U.S. and UK 
Ambassadors, in addition to senior Yemeni officials and the 
Central Bank.  He undertook to share full details of the 
operation via intel channels over coming days.  Saleh 
provided an upbeat account of Yemen\'s CT cooperation with 
Saudi Arabia, and engaged in an extended discussion of 
challenges facing coalition forces in Iraq.  Yemeni media 
featured GEN Abizaid\'s meetings and robust U.S.-Yemeni 
security cooperation.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Yemeni-Eritrean Relations 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) GEN Abizaid, accompanied by CJTF-HOA Commander BG 
Robeson, Ambassador, DCM (notetaker) and OMC Chief called on 
President Saleh at the Presidency during a 5-hour visit to 
Yemen on 9/19/03.  The CINC noted that he had just visited 
Asmara and bore greetings to Saleh from President Isaias. 
Saleh welcomed this, noting that Yemeni-Eritrean relations 
were OK except for some disputes over traditional fishing 
which were \"not big.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
CT Cooperation; al-Qaida Cell in Sanaa 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3. (S/NF) In response to questioning by the CDR, Saleh stated 
that U.S.-Yemeni cooperation was good, although the USG 
processes were slow.  The CDR expressed appreciation for 
Yemen\'s CT cooperation, and observed that it was showing good 
results.  In reply, Saleh revealed that ROYG authorities had 
recently scored a major success: breaking up an al-Qaida cell 
in Sanaa that had planned a series of terrorist attacks, 
including a strike against the Ambassador. 
 
4. (S/NF) Referring to a written report, Saleh provided the 
following selected details from the ROYG investigation: 
 
--    The attack against the Ambassador was to involve RPGs 
followed up by a car bomb.  Saleh said that the group had 
targeted the Ambassador twice (nfi).  The actual attack was 
to be carried out by Saudi nationals. 
 
--    One member of the group was to bring al-Qaida money 
from Saudi Arabia to purchase TNT and missiles.  Saleh 
mentioned two types of missiles: \"loo\" and \"milal\" (as heard). 
 
--    Other targets on the cell\'s hit list included: the 
British ambassador; former Yemeni PM Abdelkarim al-Iryani; 
Defense Minister Aliwa; Military Chief of Staff GEN Qasimi; 
PSO Chief Gamish; Interior Minister Alimi; PM Bajammal; and 
the Yemeni Central Bank.  (Comment: Embassy has briefed UK 
Ambassador) 
 
--    Yemeni authorities in Sanaa discovered the plot by 
chance, when criminal investigation of a \"girl\" in connection 
with a moral offense (nfi) turned up documents linking her 
with an al-Qaida cell operating in the city.  The group, 
including two Saudis, two Syrians, the girl and one Yemeni, 
was headed by Omar Abdel Rahman al-Sharif, whom Salah 
described as the man who had succeeded Abu Ali al-Harithi as 
head of al-Qaida operations in Yemen.  Sharif and the others 
are in custody. 
 
5. (S/NF) Saleh did not provide a linear account of the 
alleged plot or the Yemeni investigation that cracked it, and 
follow-up questions from GEN Abizaid and the Ambassador 
elicited little additional detail.  Saleh said the Political 
Security Organization would pass a copy of the written report 
to the Embassy via intel channels soon. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Saudi-Yemeni CT Cooperation 
------------------------------------- 
6. (C) In response to questioning by GEN Abizaid, Saleh said 
CT cooperation with Saudi Arabia was going well.  Information 
is being exchanged, and both sides have rendered terrorist 
suspects to the other.  He pointed to the previous week\'s 
Yemeni handover of al-Ghamdi as a recent case in point, and 
said Yemen was waiting for the Saudis to turn over eight 
suspects.  Nevertheless, said Saleh, money from Saudi Arabia 
and elsewhere in the Gulf continues to flow to extremist 
elements inside Yemen.  He added that Saudi Arabia provided 
insufficient financial help to Yemen, and that by comparison 
the United States does better. 
 
----- 
Iraq 
----- 
 
7. (S/NF) Saleh expressed considerable interest in the 
progress of coalition operations in Iraq, and asked if the 
overall situation was improving.  He commented that President 
Bush was making good use of the tools of state, including 
military, economic and diplomatic power.  The CDR responded 
that the situation is improving, with the central region -- 
including Baghdad, Rumadi and Tikrit -- remaining dangerous 
while the north and south are calm.  Saleh joked that the 
British remained in Basra because the UK\'s colonial 
experience in Iraq told them it would be less dangerous. 
 
8. (S/NF) GEN Abizaid replied that the UK soldiers were very 
good, and reviewed positive developments in the country, 
including the ongoing training of new military and police 
units, reopening of schools and universities and general rise 
of economic activity.  He added that the overall challenge 
was more political and economic than military -- mainly 
because Saddam had left the country in poor condition -- and 
cited the need for greater participation by the Sunni 
community.  People in the north and south are already better 
off than under the old regime, and those in the middle must 
also join the rebuilding effort and be part of the solution. 
Above all, stressed the CDR, the old regime was gone for 
good.  Forty-three of 55 former regime officials were 
accounted for, although it remained important to find Saddam 
Hussein.  Saleh expressed the view that arresting or killing 
Saddam would not end resistance, and GEN Abizaid agreed.  He 
said the resistance came mainly from terrorists and Islamic 
zealots rather than Baathi loyalists. 
 
9. (S/NF) Saleh asked about the number of foreign terrorists 
active in Iraq, noting that he was aware of 6,000 Saudi 
terrorists who had fled police pressure in the KSA.  The CDR 
estimated that perhaps 1,000 foreign fighters were in Iraq, 
and about 10 Saudis were in custody.  Saleh expressed 
surprise that a larger percentage of the fugitive Saudis had 
not turned up in Iraq.  GEN Abuzaid said some Yemenis had 
also been apprehended in Iraq, although Syrian fighters were 
the most numerous national group.  Saleh responded that he 
knew of Yemeni students in Iraq, but not terrorists.  The 
Ambassador pointed out that recent intel showed the beginning 
of networks to recruit Yemenis for combat in Iraq.  Regarding 
the Syrians, Saleh posited that they were \"individuals,\" as 
it was not SARG policy to send them to Iraq. 
 
10. (S/NF) GEN Abizaid reviewed the range of challenges 
facing coalition forces in Iraq, including Baathi loyalists, 
Islamic extremists and foreign fighters.  Saleh observed that 
much of the resistance came from the four million or so who 
had benefited from the regime of Saddam Hussein.  GEN Abizaid 
pointed out that the number of resistance fighters was far 
lower. 
 
11. (S/NF) Saleh ventured to put himself in the place of U.S. 
planners and offered his counsel on Iraq.  First, he urged 
coalition action to close Iraq\'s borders to stem the inflow 
of foreign fighters, noting that the coalition was \"legally 
responsible\" for border security.  He cited the decision to 
dissolve Iraq\'s military and security structure as a mistake, 
and the cause of much of the current disorder.  Finally, he 
advised against placing too much faith in former exiles like 
Ahmed Chalabi and warned of the danger of erecting political 
institutions based on ethnic and religious affiliation. 
Focusing on separate Kurdish, Shia and Sunni identities 
creates division and impedes progress.  Saleh called for an 
inclusive political solution and reconciliation with all 
Iraqis, including those connected with the former regime.  He 
stressed that he did not want see Americans continue to be 
targeted in Iraq nor to see the United States face long-term 
enmity either in Iraq or in the region.  It is thus necessary 
to move quickly toward the model democracy in Iraq that 
President Bush has spoken of, declared Saleh. 
 
12. (S/NF) The CDR said AMB Bremer understands the complex 
challenge of doing just that and is managing it well. 
Moreover, a huge majority of Iraqis support the 
reconstruction effort, although, again, the Sunni community 
needs to engage more actively.  Saleh acknowledged that most 
Iraqis were supportive, but observed that if even 10 percent 
remained non-supportive it would cause problems.  He 
expressed worry that all the terrorists in the world will now 
get together in Iraq, as they used to do in Afghanistan.  He 
immediately concurred with GEN Abizaid\'s assertion that the 
terrorists would fail, but worried aloud at the tension and 
damage they could create in the near term. 
 
--------------- 
Other Issues 
--------------- 
 
13. (C) Saleh reiterated the value of training and continuing 
information exchange.  He added that U.S. assistance to the 
Yemeni Coast Guard had been extremely valuable.  The 
continuing influx of illegal immigrants from Somalia was a 
huge problem for Yemen.  A recent fatwa by Afghan clerics had 
legitimated the export of drugs to finance weapons purchases, 
and this was creating new concerns for Yemen.  He also 
welcomed U.S. assistance on economic development issues, 
adding that he and the Ambassador spoke often on this. 
 
14. (U) Following the meeting President Saleh hosted a lunch 
iho GEN Abizaid that was attended by more than 100 senior 
government and military officials.  As in the past, Yemeni 
media provided ample coverage of GEN Abizaid\'s visit and 
reaffirmed robust Yemeni-U.S. security cooperation. 
 
15. (U) This cable was cleared by USCENTCOM. 
 
16.  (S/NF) Comment: We will be analyzing information to be 
provided through intel channels on the disrupted al-Qaida 
cell, but caution against premature conclusions based on 
Saleh\'s sketchy account.

1.  Embassy Sanaa requests funding for a grant from the 
NEA Democracy Small Grants Program to the \"National Women 
Committee/ Aden\" to conduct the \"Early Marriage 
Phenomenon Study and Awareness Workshop.\" 
 
2.  The National Women Committee is quasi-governmental 
and receives much of its funding from the ROYG, and its 
head in Sanaa is government-appointed. In most other 
respects, it functions as an NGO and works closely with 
women\'s NGOs throughout Yemen. The fact that it is well 
organized and properly staffed gives us confidence that 
the Aden branch will be able to implement this project. 
 
3.  Project description: The project titled \"Early 
Marriage Phenomenon Study and Awareness Workshop\" will 
address the early marriage phenomenon and risks and 
effects, among young girls in the rural areas of 6 
southern governorates: 
Lahj, Abyan, Adhalie, Hadramout, Shabwa and Almahra. 
The study will focus on how early marriage is denying the 
rights of young girls and preventing them from enjoying 
the life of childhood, education, freedom to choose their 
partners, and the right to build their personalities. 
The study will search this phenomenon and call for 
identifying such problem, its causes, and impacts on 
family conditions. A discussion group will be formed to 
discuss the study results and work on the formulation of 
adequate solutions that eradicate this phenomenon, with 
the cooperation of all concerned, the government, civil 
society, individuals, NGO\'s and International donors. 
The purpose of such cooperation is to ensure that women 
in general and young girls in particular are enjoying 
their rights and promote the exercise of these rights 
without violence. 
Discussion groups will include judges, lawyers, religious 
men, doctors and specialist groups such as social 
experts, psychologists and social leaders. 
Following the research and study team, public awareness 
mobile workshops will be organized by the specialist 
team, visiting the families in the study areas, girls 
schools and women centers.  The purpose of this method is 
to educate and make the public aware about the risks and 
impact of this phenomenon on both sexes, and to get their 
comments and opinions. This method is considered to be 
participatory. 
Workshop will use posters and signs to get the message 
across and reach people. 
 
4.  Project objectives: 
-To raise awareness about early marriage risks. 
-To assert girls right to education 
 
5.  Project justification: Yemen has one of the highest 
rates of early girl marriages in the region due to strict 
traditions that make parents the ultimate decision 
makers. According to traditions, parents in most Yemeni 
provinces especially in poor and tribal remote areas, 
take their daughters out of school and force them into 
marriage either to follow family tradition, or to get the 
marriage dowry which will help the family economically. 
The continuation of this tradition has caused many risks 
to young girls whose rights to education, freedom of 
expression and choice have been violated. It also has 
affected their physical well being since they bear 
children at a young age and are unable to cope with 
marriage responsibility, therefore get divorced and bear 
the social and economical responsibilities of their 
circumstances. 
 
Project supports mission key MPP goal of promoting girls 
rights to education, freedom of choice and intellectual 
and physical development.

1. (C) Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened an EAC meeting 
on September 28 to consider information provided to the 
Embassy by the ROYG concerning recent disruption of a local 
Al-Qaida cell targeting U.S., other Western, and Yemeni 
objectives.  The new information, provided by Interior 
Minister Alimi in a briefing for the U.S. and four other 
Western embassies, elaborates preliminary information 
provided by President Saleh during GEN Abizaid\'s 9/20 visit 
(reftel).  While the identified threat has been disrupted, 
the EAC decided to issue a warden message immediately and 
schedule a meeting of wardens later in the week.  The EAC 
also reviewed security measures for upcoming public events 
and USG visitors.  Key offices and personnel represented at 
the meeting included:  POL/ECON, CONS, RSO, MO, FPD, POL/MIL, 
DAO, OMC, and SOC YEMEN.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) DCM opened the 9/28 EAC meeting with a readout of the 
just-concluded briefing by Interior Minister Dr. Rashad 
al-Alimi for key Western embassies.  Attendees at the 
briefing included the Ambassador (accompanied by DCM and 
RSO), the Italian Ambassador, the French Charge, the German 
DCM and the British Ambassador.

ROYG Briefing: Disruption of new al-Qaida Cell in Sanaa 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3. (C) Alimi convened the meeting to provide information on 
Yemen\'s recent disruption of a Sanaa-based al-Qaida cell. 
(Note:  Alimi\'s briefing elaborated on information initially 
passed by President Saleh in his 9/19 meeting with GEN 
Abizaid (reftel).  End note).  The Minister told attendees 
that the cell had identified a long list of Western targets, 
including: the U.S. Ambassador, the British Embassy, the 
Italian Embassy, and the French Cultural Center.  Other 
targets included the Hadda Compound, Spectrum (a language 
school with no Embassy affiliation), and many senior ROYG 
officials and government buildings. 
 
4. (C) Alimi said that only the UK Embassy attack was in 
operational preparation, but noted that the arms and 
explosives to be used in the attack -- which were to be 
obtained in Marib with money sent from Saudi Arabia -- had 
not been received by the Sanaa cell.  He showed tactical 
sketches of the UK Embassy and shared detailed surveillance 
notes obtained from the four arrested members of the cell. 
He promised to provide the UK Ambassador with a copy of video 
surveillance footage of her embassy. 
 
5. (C) Alimi stated that the cell had targeted the U.S. 
Ambassador\'s motorcade for attack on two prior occasions, but 
had been deterred by his security escort.  (Note: 
Ambassador\'s detail includes both Embassy bodyguards and 
Yemeni police elements.  End note) 
 
6. (C) The Interior Minister said that the arrested al-Qaida 
cell members -- led by \'Amr Abdul Rahman al-Sharif, who is in 
custody -- called their group the \"Cells of Faith and Unity,\" 
which was a part of a larger grouping called the \"Unification 
Brigades.\"  He indicated that the ROYG had no previous 
knowledge of this nomenclature, but stressed that the group 
was definitely tied to Al-Qaida.  The individuals arrested 
and currently being held are of Yemeni and Saudi nationality. 
 Alimi added that information about the cell had already been 
shared with Saudi Arabia -- specifically with Deputy Interior 
Minister Mohamed bin Naif, currently in Sanaa.  Alimi added 
that he would also brief the Iranian Ambassador on September 
29 and request Iranian assistance with the investigation, as 
one of the cell members was based in Iran. 
 
7. (C) Dr. Alimi told attendees that although the imminent 
threat presented by the operations cell had been dealt with, 
attendees should review security procedures and exercise 
extraordinary caution.  Dr. Al-Alimi said that additional 
ROYG security on targeted facilities had already been put in 
place.  When asked how the ROYG was going to publicize the 
information, he responded that comments would be minimized 
due to the ongoing investigation and the desire to capture 
suspects who remain at large.  When presented with our duty 
to release a warden message, Dr. Al-Alimi agreed to the 
release of non-specific threat information. 
 
---------------- 
EAC Actions 
---------------- 
 
8. (C) The EAC agreed to issue a warden message and hold a 
warden meeting within the next few days.  At Alimi\'s request, 
the warden message will not/not include specific details of 
the disrupted terrorist cell, but will advise wardens of a 
new threat and urge exceptional precautions.  Taking into 
account ROYG security enhancements at Embassy-affiliated 
locations and all other locations on the target list, the EAC 
agreed that the Embassy\'s current security posture and 
measures were appropriate.  Upcoming social events are to 
proceed as scheduled with necessary security measures in 
place for each.  The DCM reiterated the need to practice 
vigilant personal security and avoid predictability.  Travel 
outside of the capitol will continue to be subject to advance 
consultation with ROYG authorities.  The EAC agreed to defer 
discussion of the Marine ball (set for November 10 on the 
Embassy compound) until a subsequent meeting.

Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (C), (G). 
 
1. (C) Summary: On 9/28 Interior Minister Alimi called in 
Ambassador, with ambassadors of Italy, France, UK and 
Germany, to brief on ROYG\'s recent disruption of a 
Sanaa-based al-Qaida cell targeting U.S., other Western, and 
Yemeni objectives.  Alimi\'s briefing elaborated on 
preliminary information provided by President Saleh during 
GEN Abizaid\'s 9/20 visit (ref b).  The group -- calling 
itself the \"Unification Brigades\" -- reportedly targeted 
Ambassador\'s motorcade on past two occasions, but was 
deterred by his security escort.  The group had compiled a 
long list of potential targets, but only one -- an assault on 
the UK Embassy -- was in operational preparation.  Alimi 
noted that explosives and weapons for that attack were to be 
procured in Marib and al-Jawf with money sent from Saudi 
Arabia, and had in fact not/not yet been sent to Sanaa. 
While the leader of the group (\'Amr Abdul Rahman al-Sharif) 
is in custody with three confederates, Alimi stressed that at 
least one group member (Abdul Rahman Basoura) remained at 
large (probably in Saudi Arabia) and there could be others. 
Accordingly the ROYG had boosted security at all sites on the 
target list, and urged Western embassies to exercise caution. 
 Alimi said he had briefed the Saudi Deputy Interior 
Minister, and  would ask the Iranian ambassador for Tehran\'s 
cooperation in the ongoing investigation because Basoura was 
based in Iran.  Embassy Sanaa\'s EAC discussed the information 
and issued a warden message 9/28 (ref a), and held a wardens 
meeting 9/30.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Yemen\'s Interior Minister, Dr. Rashad al-Alimi, on 
9/28 convened a meeting of key Western embassies to brief on 
ROYG\'s recent disruption of an al-Qaida affiliated cell in 
Sanaa.  Attendees at the briefing were the Ambassador 
(accompanied by DCM and RSO), British Ambassador, Italian 
Ambassador, French Charge, and German DCM.  Alimi noted that 
the operation was carried out by Central Security 
Organization forces under his ministry.  His read-out 
elaborated on initial information provided by President Saleh 
in his 9/20 meeting with CENTCOM Commander GEN Abizaid on 
9/20 (ref b).  Alimi said the investigation was ongoing, 
stressing that further information would be provided to the 
embassies as it became available \"because all of us are 
targets now.\" 
 
---------------------------- 
A Long List of Targets 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Alimi reviewed the group\'s lengthy target list, which 
included: the UK embassy; the Italian embassy; the French 
cultural center; DHL; Spectrum (a local language school that 
specializes in English but has no affiliation with the U.S. 
or UK embassies, but which, Alimi pointed out, is close to 
the home of PSO chief Gamish); the Hadda Compound (home to 
many foreign workers and diplomats, including more than a 
dozen U.S. Embassy families); the Red Cross; the Hertz car 
rental company; American restaurants (e.g. the Pizza Hut and 
Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises); Yemenia Airlines; PSO 
headquarters; the Presidential Palace; Parliament; the 
Radio/TV center; the Central Bank; The Interior Ministry\'s 
Immigration and Passports Office the Civil Records Office; 
The Yemeni International Bank; Spacetel (a mobile phone 
company); Coca Cola; the Procter and Gamble office in Taiz 
(closed more than a year ago, suggesting a gap in the 
terrorists\' research); Defense Minister Aliwa; Interior 
Minister Alimi; PSO Chief Gamish; former PM Iryani; and 
current PM Bajammal. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Plan to Target UK Embassy 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Alimi cited three main modes of attack the group had 
envisioned: car bombs, ambush/assassination attacks, and 
standoff attacks with RPGs.  This was theoretical, however, 
as the group had not yet acquired the necessary arms and 
explosives. 
 
5. (C) Alimi stressed that only the UK embassy compound 
attack was in an operational planning stage. He showed 
surveillance notes and tactical sketches the group had made 
of the compound\'s entrances others, and promised to provide 
the UK Ambassador with a copy of a surveillance videotape 
they had made.  The group was awaiting weapons and explosives 
for the attack which were to be acquired in Marib and al-Jawf 
with money sent from Saudi Arabia, and then the arms were to 
be sent on to Sanaa.  Alimi expressed high confidence that 
the weapons/explosives had not/not reached Sanaa. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Targeting the U.S. Ambassador 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The Minister noted that the group had \"more than once\" 
targeted the U.S. Ambassador\'s motorcade for assassination, 
but were deterred by his security escort. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Members of the \"Cells of Faith and Unity\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7. (C) Alimi stated that four members of the group were in 
custody, and provided general information on several group 
members: 
 
--  The head of the group, now in custody, is a Yemeni named 
\'Amr Abdul Rahman al-Sharif, aka Abu Saqr al-Mekki, who had 
been a long-term resident of Saudi Arabia.  Alimi described 
him as the 4th ranking al-Qaida leader in the Arabian 
Peninsula, noting that he had succeeded Abu Ali al-Harithy as 
head of al-Qaida operations in Yemen.  A peninsula-wide 
al-Qaida reorganization in the aftermath of Harithy\'s death 
and the arrest of Fawaz al-Rabi\'e moved Sharif up in the 
hierarchy and gave rise to a new nomenclature.  Sharif\'s 
group called itself the \"Cells of Faith and Unity,\" and 
claimed to be part of a larger grouping called the 
\"Unification Brigades.\" 
 
--  Sharif\'s deputy, Abdul Rahman Basoura, also Yemeni, 
remains at large.  He was sent to Saudi Arabia to get money 
for the group, so Alimi hopes he will be apprehended in the 
KSA or in Yemen when/if he returns.  Basoura is based in 
Iran, and on that basis Alimi said he planned to call in the 
Iranian Ambassador and request Tehran\'s assistance in the 
investigation. 
 
--  Another group member still at large, Ghalib al-Zaidi, was 
perhaps charged with the task of bringing the arms and 
explosives, once obtained, from Marib to Sanaa. 
 
8. (C) Alimi revealed that discovery of the cell resulted 
from investigation of an 18 year-old girl who, having run 
away from her family, was living with members of the group. 
A police inquiry into this illicit connection led to 
discovery of documents establishing the group\'s terrorist 
aims.  Alimi said police did not consider the girl a \"member\" 
of the group as such, but surmised that she would have been 
used in some way in a future operation.  He observed that the 
immoral use of a young girl reflected the falsity of the 
group\'s pretense of religious rectitude. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Yemeni-Saudi Cooperation 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Yemeni authorities recovered a wealth of information 
in the round-up of cell members, including documents, 
computer disks and telephone numbers.  Alimi stated that the 
telephone numbers were all being monitored, and might lead to 
more arrests.  The information also included telephone 
numbers in Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis -- specifically 
Deputy Interior Minister Mohamed bin Naif, who was in Sanaa 
9/28 -- had been given all details.  He repeatedly 
underscored both the closeness of ongoing cooperation with 
the Saudis and the fact that \"all the group\'s money and 3/4 
of its leadership\" was to be found in the Kingdom. 
 
----------------------------- 
Follow-up Inside Yemen 
----------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Alimi added that further information, including 
written documentation, would be provided to the U.S. Embassy 
by the PSO later the same day.  While expressing confidence 
that the cell\'s operational plans had been disrupted, Alimi 
urged that the embassies be alert to possible action by 
elements as yet unknown.  One aim of the continuing 
investigation in Yemen, he told the Ambassador, was to 
discover any location the group had used in Yemen for 
training. 
12. (C) In response to a question from AMB Hull, Alimi said 
the ROYG would maintain stepped up security at potential 
target sites but would not make a full public statement until 
the investigation was further along.  He noted with evident 
satisfaction that the investigation had proceeded 
productively for a full week without any loss of secrecy. 
 
13. (C) The German DCM asked if a ROYG order for German 
archaeologists to leave Sirwah and return to Marib was 
related to this investigation.  Alimi replied in the 
affirmative, stating that the German team should either work 
in the Marib area -- which would pose no security problem -- 
or return to Sanaa. 
 
14. (C) The German DCM praised the work of the MOI in 
disrupting this cell, a sentiment echoed by Ambassador Hull. 
 
15. (S/NF) Comment: Disruption of this Sanaa-based cell is a 
major success for the Interior Ministry, which seems to have 
moved quickly to round up cell members and conduct productive 
interrogations.  The Political Security Organization has 
provided ORCA with further documentation on the disrupted 
cell that will be reported via intel channels.  Post will 
probe ROYG for maximum detail on the two reported instances 
of targeting Ambassador\'s motorcade and reassess security 
arrangements accordingly.  Ambassador\'s security escort 
currently includes both Embassy bodyguards and Yemeni police 
elements.  Post issued a 9/28 warden message (which was 
previewed to Alimi) and held a wardens meeting on 9/30.

SUBJECT: DETAINEES: REHABILITATION AND RELEASE 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Since the 8/02 inception of the ROYG\'s 
program to rehabilitate and release detainees, approximately 
160 of the over 220 detainees who have participated in the 
Ulema run dialogues have been recommended for release.  Of 
those, 43 detainees, none of whom were facing criminal 
charges, have been released.  According to a senior legal 
source, none of those released has had problems to date, and 
another prisoner release is anticipated before Ramadan begins 
on 10/26.  The ROYG has not/not vetted with post the names of 
those recommended or released.  Our requests for the names 
remain pending separately with security, intelligence and 
legal authorities.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
The Philosophy of the Dialogues 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) During a two-hour meeting on 10/1, Judge Hamoud Hitar 
-- who heads the ROYG committee charged with the 
rehabilitating security detainees so they can be released -- 
expanded upon recent press reports concerning the program. 
After announcing the program on 24 August 2002, President 
Saleh summoned government officials and 15 Yemeni clerics to 
a planning meeting on August 30, 2002.  One of those 
summoned, Hitar said the meeting was attended by Prime 
Minister Bajammal, the Speaker of Parliament, Islah Party 
Shura Council Chairman Sheik Majid Al-Zindani, Presidential 
Advisor Dr. Abdelkarim al-Iryani, Minister of Interior Alimi, 
Head of the Political Security Organization Ghalib Gamish. 
The meeting resulted in the formation of a committee selected 
by the attendees and coordinated by the Ulema, a council of 
Yemeni religious scholars. 
 
3. (C) During the Ulema-hosted planning meeting that followed 
on September 2-4, 2002, a number of attendees expressed 
concern about the President\'s initiative.  Hitar said that 
they feared being attacked for their interference or labeled 
American agents, and were worried that the detainees would 
refuse to take part in the program.  He alone declared that, 
as a direct order from the President, the dialogue must occur 
and was rewarded a half-hour later with a call from President 
Saleh noting his loyalty and pledging full support. 
 
4. (C) Phase one of the dialogue project began with the 
committee\'s formation on September 5, 2002.  The committee 
included Judge Hitar, Sheikh Hasan As-Sheikh, Sheikh Mokbil 
Al-Kabadi, and Sheikh Al-Mahrabi (a fifth member, Sheik Ali 
Motar, joined the committee for phase two.)  The project 
faced a number of problems during the early days, including 
anger from those who believed this was not suitable work for 
the Ulema, and members\' fear of physical attack by 
extremists.  However, reiterating their commitment to the 
Koran, Hitar and other committee members asked for a 
dialogue, declaring: \"If you (the detainees) are right, we 
will follow you.  If we are right you will follow us.\" 
 
5. (C) This first round of dialogues concentrated primarily 
on detainees in Sanaa, but later spread to Ibb, Taiz, Aden, 
Abyan, and Hodeidah.  It included 104 detainees, 80 of whom 
were recommended for release, and 43 who have since been 
released.  Hitar said the 43 have had \"no problems\" following 
release, and he hopes the remainder will be released soon. 
 
6. (C) The Ulema held the second round of dialogues from 
mid-August 2003 to September 13, 2003 primarily in Aden 
because of a large number of detainees from the southern 
Yemen region of Hatat.  126 detainees participated in the 
discussions.  Their names, along with the committee\'s 
recommendation for the release of approximately 80 detainees, 
were forwarded to the President in late September 2003. 
Hitar believes those detainees who are not facing criminal 
charges and make it through Presidential and security reviews 
will be released before Ramadan. 
 
7. (C) Hitar expects phase three to begin after Ramadan, but 
said the committee is ready to conduct another session at any 
time. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Process of Dialogue - Not a Substitute 
for Criminal Proceedings 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Hitar stressed that the committee is not investigative 
and that criminal cases are a matter for the judicial system, 
not the dialogues.  He noted that some of these detainees 
have been expelled from other countries in the region because 
they were suspected of extremism.  Others are facing criminal 
charges and are not eligible for release but, said Hitar, 
their exclusion from the dialogue process would only spread 
their ideology to others. 
 
9. (C) The Political Security Organization (PSO) selects 
detainees -- highlighting influential leaders -- and provides 
the committee access to and use of their prison facilities. 
The committee divides the detainees into groups of 5-7 for 
Ulema-led sessions on the concepts of jihad in Islam: Holy 
War (when, how, where, who can declare, and against whom), 
the rights of rulers, commitment to constitution and laws, 
the rights of non-Muslims in Muslim countries, the principle 
of doing good, and actions that destabilize security - 
violence, extremism, and terrorism.  For all detainees who 
commit to the Koran and the rights of non-Muslims -- and who 
are not/not facing criminal charges -- the committee 
recommends release.  Yemeni security officials initially 
opposed this initiative, but Hitar said the Ulema explained 
that individuals cannot be detained indefinitely without 
charges as noted in an Amnesty International report (2003). 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Commitment to Uphold the Rights of Non-Muslims 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
10. (C) Hitar explained that all detainees pledge their 
commitment to the ruler, the constitution, laws, peace and 
security, the rights of non-Muslims, and the inviolability of 
foreign interests.  They must agree that attacks in the 
Muslim world, like those against the USS Cole, the Limburg, 
and tourists, are not jihad but actions that are banned under 
the Koran.  Each repentant detainee\'s signed commitment, 
along with the committee\'s recommendations, is sent to the 
President, who in turn forwards the package to security 
officials including the PSO and the Ministry of Interior. 
 
11. (C) The committee\'s recommendations also include 
suggestions for the restoration of jobs, new jobs for the 
previously unemployed, special dialogues to reinforce vows of 
those released, and special supervision for a period of time 
to be determined by security forces.  The committee 
recommends that detainees released under the program invite 
others to join their newfound ideology, and asks the 
government to encourage unity, tolerance, and moderation in 
mosques, schools, media, and other public arenas. 
 
12. (C) Judge Hitar noted the importance of providing the USG 
with the most accurate information, and welcomed future 
discussions with the Embassy. 
 
13. (S/NF) Comment: We believe Hitar\'s outline of the 
rehabilitation/release process is accurate.  That process 
does not/not include vetting names with the USG either before 
or after a detainee\'s release.  We have requested the names 
previously via intel channels, through Judge Hitar on 10/1 
(he had the list of names at hand while meeting with 
pol/econoff, but lacked authorization to share it), and DCM 
requested it through the Interior Minister\'s Office Director 
on 10/6.  While Hitar\'s claim that detainees facing criminal 
charges will not/not be considered for release is credible, 
post will continue pressing to obtain the names for further 
U.S. review and entry into the Visas Viper system.

1. (S/NF) Summary: In a 10/4 meeting with President Saleh, 
NEA A/S Burns welcomed U.S.-Yemeni CT cooperation and 
supported U.S. assistance for Yemen\'s security and 
development.  Saleh briefed on expanding Saudi-Yemeni CT 
cooperation, which he characterized as better than ever 
before, despite (according to him) occasional Saudi 
foot-dragging and a continuing flow of terrorist financing 
flowing coming from the KSA.  Burns stressed the need for an 
Article 98 agreement.  Saleh asked for a Powell-Qirbi letter 
on the subject to help the ROYG reach a positive response. 
In a discussion of long-running problems with the diplomatic 
pouch and diplomatic support flights for Embassy Sanaa, Saleh 
expressed lingering concerns over the volume and 
non-transparency of shipments.  A/S Burns underscored the 
need for cooperation to ensure that the 10/5 support flight 
would succeed and set a positive model for the future.  In a 
private exchange at the meeting\'s end, Burns reiterated the 
U.S. call for Yemen to sever cooperation with North Korea. 
Saleh agreed in principle, but  cited ongoing talks on the 
\"defective\" SCUDs Yemen received from the DPRK last winter. 
Saleh and Burns also exchanged views on Iraq and Palestine.

Summary. 
 
2. (C) NEA A/S Burns, accompanied by Ambassador, DCM and 
Pol/Econ Chief (notetaker) called on President Saleh 10/4/03 
during Burns\' 1 1/2-day stay in Yemen.  Saleh received the 
U.S. delegation in a recently restored old Turkish military 
garrison known locally as \"the new Pentagon.\"  MFA staffers 
confirmed afterward that Saleh intends to use the site as an 
alternate venue for high-level meetings, and that the meeting 
with A/S Burns marked the first time he had done so. 
 
SALEH: IMPROVEMENT IN COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION WARRANTS 
INCREASED ECONOMIC AID 
 
3. (C) Noting that the August visit to Washington DC by 
Presidential Advisor Abdelkarim al-Iryani was fruitful, Saleh 
quickly shifted to the progress that Yemen has made in 
combating terrorism.  Pointing to the ROYG\'s recent success 
in disrupting an al-Qaida cell in Sanaa (ref a), Saleh 
expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. media and urged the 
USG to be cautious about sharing information with the media 
while Yemen is still trying to track down all parts of the 
cell.  He maintained that the leaking of information has had 
a negative impact on the flow of European tourism and 
investment to Yemen. 
 
4. (C) Saleh criticized the USG for not providing economic 
assistance commensurate with Yemen\'s contribution to 
counter-terrorism efforts.  A/S Burns pointed out that Saleh 
had voiced a similar concern about CT assistance a year or 
two earlier, but that the CT relationship was now well 
established.  He said a similar positive trend was underway 
with respect to economic assistance, and would grow and 
become increasingly visible over time as Yemen made progress 
on its own economic reforms.  Saleh re-emphasized the need 
for economic assistance, commenting that the U.S. is a 
superpower and should overlook small mistakes and concentrate 
on the fact that it needs allies in the region.  He recalled 
that he was the first Arab leader to visit Washington after 
9/11, and suggested that the U.S. convince Saudi Arabia to 
exempt Yemen from its debts as a further economic assistance 
measure. 
 
5. (C) A/S Burns noted that he had headed the U.S. del at the 
10/02 World Bank-sponsored Coordinating Group meeting in 
Paris.  Saleh interjected that Burns\' \"excellent\" speech had 
been the best at the event and positively influenced the 
meeting outcome.  Underscoring U.S. commitment to expanding 
economic assistance to Yemen, Burns noted that Yemen has to 
date been the number one beneficiary of program funding under 
the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI).  He continued 
that Yemen may also qualify to benefit from the Millennium 
Challenge Account (MCA) if it moves forward on essential 
reforms, e.g. in civil service, the judiciary and corruption. 
 Burns urged Saleh to move ahead decisively in these areas. 
Saleh asserted that the World Bank, the IMF and the USG need 
to understand Yemen\'s problems, including the population 
explosion, absence of tourism, limited oil revenues and 
limited export markets for Yemeni goods. 
 
6. (C) A/S Burns referred to U.S. support for the nascent 
Yemeni Coast Guard, including the delivery of EDA patrol 
craft set for January 2004.  Saleh half-jokingly suggested 
that the U.S. provide Yemen 15-20 new vessels from the UAE 
shipyards, as this would be faster and cheaper than the old, 
refurbished craft the USG was sending.  Saleh complained that 
Yemeni CT cooperation with the United States had caused the 
international community to criticize the ROYG\'s human rights 
record.  A/S Burns responded that Yemen has moved ahead in 
some areas, such as women\'s rights and increased voter 
registration, and had a self-interest in showing the same 
determination in other areas of civil society and political 
freedoms.  This was not a favor to the U.S., but a step 
forward for Yemenis. 
 
NEW AL-QAIDA LEADERSHIP; SAUDI ARABIA IS A \"DEN\" FOR HIDING 
TERRORISTS 
 
7. (S/NF) A/S Burns asked Saleh\'s assessment of recently 
expanded security cooperation with Saudi Arabia.  Saleh said 
it was good, and that recent exchanges of information and of 
prisoners was very positive.  Nevertheless, the KSA remains a 
\"den\" in which terrorists find safe hideouts, and cutting off 
Saudi-origin funding for terrorism must be a priority.  Saleh 
revealed that he had envisioned a three-way meeting with 
Saudi Deputy Interior Minister Mohamed bin Naif to correspond 
with the recently postponed visit to Yemen by FBI Director 
Mueller.  He said he still hoped to arrange such a session 
when Mueller\'s visit is rescheduled.  Saleh noted that the 
ROYG killed seven Saudis in recent clashes in al-Jawf, Marib 
and Houdeidah and that he has passed their names to Mohamed 
bin Naif.  Saleh passed Ambassador Hull the name Ali al Hajj, 
who he said had replaced al-Nasheri as new head of al-Qaida 
operations in the Arabian peninsula). 
 
8. (C) Saleh commented the May bombings had an \"excellent\" 
effect on the SAG, as the Saudis are now focused on CT as 
they never were previously.  Asked by AMB Hull to specify 
Yemen\'s coordinator for the expanding cooperation with the 
Saudis, Saleh named two: Interior Minister Alimi handles the 
relationship on a political level, while PSO chief Gamish 
handles details -- e.g. exchange of telephone numbers, names 
and other information on terrorist suspects.  In response, 
Ambassador noted that Alimi was upbeat on cooperation with 
the Saudis, while Gamish told us privately that it was 
unproductive.  Saleh responded that Gamish was \"sensitive\" 
because the Saudis were often slow to respond to specific 
requests for information -- e.g. the KSA\'s slow response to 
Yemen\'s long-standing request for extraditions. 
Nevertheless, said Saleh, overall Saudi-Yemeni CT cooperation 
is better than at any time in the past. 
 
ARTICLE 98: REQUEST FOR POWELL-QIRBI LETTER 
 
9. (C) A/S Burns emphasized the importance of reaching a 
U.S.-Yemeni agreement on Article 98 promptly, since Yemeni 
ratification of the ICC treaty without such an agreement in 
place could trigger curtailment of U.S. assistance.  Saleh 
initially said that Yemen was \"opposed,\" but quickly backed 
off as A/S Burns elaborated on the issue.  Saleh asked that 
an official letter be sent from Secretary Powell to FM Qirbi 
spelling out the issue (once again) and the steps Yemen 
needed to take.  A/S Burns agreed that the USG would provide 
such a letter.  Saleh concluded that the ROYG would consider 
the matter carefully and hopefully offer a positive response. 
 
DIPLOMATIC POUCH/DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT FLIGHTS 
 
10. (C) Apparently briefed by Qirbi that A/S Burns intended 
to raise U.S. concerns over continuing Yemeni restrictions on 
the pouch and diplomatic support flights for Embassy Sanaa, 
Saleh pre-emptively raised the issue himself.  He complained 
that U.S. insistence on importing large volumes of material 
and refusing to have it inspected was a violation of the 
Vienna Convention and a source of embarrassment for the ROYG. 
 He fretted that Parliament and the opposition parties were 
aware of the issue and pressed the government not to sell out 
Yemeni sovereignty by acceding to these excessive U.S. 
demands. 
 
11. (C) Saleh then offered a \"solution.\"  He said the ROYG 
would permit Embassy Sanaa to bring in anything it wished, as 
long as it is inspected first.  He expanded on this theme, 
inviting the Embassy to import even secret/sensitive items -- 
e.g. \"eavesdropping devices,\" \"espionage equipment,\" weapons, 
explosives, bombs, rockets, cameras, computers, etc. -- but 
to cooperate with Yemeni authorities in doing so.  Inspection 
of such \"secret\" items could be performed in a \"locked room\" 
with only a single Yemeni security official present, after 
which the items could be taken immediately to the Embassy 
compound.  Inspection was unavoidable, however, and must 
occur in the airport -- i.e. on Yemeni soil -- rather than at 
the Embassy, which was American soil and therefore outside 
the scope of Yemeni sovereignty and control. 
 
12. (C) A/S Burns replied that the diplomatic support flight 
scheduled for the following day (10/5) would meet the 
President\'s concerns as it contained only five dip pouches -- 
which, by common assent, were non-inspectable -- and items of 
diplomatic cargo which were all inspectable.  He asked that 
Yemeni authorities cooperate fully to make the 10/5 flight a 
shared success which could set the stage for future progress 
on this important bilateral issue.  (Note: The 10/5 
diplomatic support flight was off-loaded in record time with 
full Yemeni cooperation.  End note.) 
 
IRAQ 
 
13. (C) At Saleh\'s request, A/S Burns provided an overview of 
current conditions and U.S. aims in Iraq.  Reviewing themes 
covered in his recent meeting with GEN Abizaid (ref b), Saleh 
offered a range of \"friendly\" opinions and advice on Iraq: 
the Iraqi army should not have been disbanded; police and 
administrative responsibilities must be placed in Iraqi 
hands; that former soldiers and former Baathists must be 
given an economic stake; restoring security is a top 
priority, ahead of creating a model democracy; many 
opposition figures who arrived with coalition troops are not 
credible.  A/S Burns expressed appreciation for FM Qirbi\'s 
helpful role in getting the Iraqi delegation seated in the 
Arab League and asked that Yemen maintain such a supportive 
posture. 
 
ISRAEL-PALESTINE AND THE ROADMAP 
 
14. (C) Saleh strongly urged the USG to press the parties for 
implementation of the roadmap, which he said would give the 
U.S. credibility with the Arab countries.  He commented that 
by overthrowing Saddam Hussein, but refusing to work with 
Arafat, the U.S. was using a double standard.  A/S Burns 
outlined the U.S. approach, stressing commitment to the 
roadmap and a two-state solution.  President Saleh said Yemen 
is against Hamas, adding that Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, 
Syria, Lebanon and Jordan are all ready to press the 
Palestinians to stop the violence, but the U.S. must 
guarantee that Israel will stop the settlements.  The A/S 
agreed that the Palestinians must have a sense of hope if the 
extremists are to be marginalized, but emphasized again that 
Palestinian performance on security is critically important. 
Saleh agreed and said that Yemen is ready to help and 
cooperate.  He equated a Palestinian state with Israeli 
security.  (Note: The meeting occurred prior to the 10/4/03 
Haifa suicide bombing.) 
 
ROYG-DPRK COOPERATION; SCUDS 
 
15. (S/NF) In a brief private exchange with Saleh at the end 
of the meeting, A/S Burns underscored the importance of 
cutting off Yemeni cooperation with North Korea.  Saleh said 
Yemen had taken the decision to do so, including the 
Houdeidah naval base, but discussions were underway regarding 
the \"defective\" SCUDs imported last winter (ref c).  This 
could lead to either a North Korean refund payment to Yemen 
or possibly a DPRK technical team to visit Yemen and effect 
repairs.  A/S Burns cautioned again that Yemen should limit 
all interaction with North Korea.

SUBJECT: A/S BURNS IN YEMEN:  MEPI AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS 
SHOWING RESULTS 
 
 
1. (u) Summary:  During his October 3-4 visit to Yemen, 
Assistant Secretary Burns experienced first-hand how 
development programs complement and support Post\'s 
counter-terrorism goals.  Meetings with President Saleh and 
FM Qirbi reported in septels.  A/S Burns received 
comprehensive briefings from the Embassy development team 
(USAID, Pol/Econ, Public Diplomacy, Agriculture) in 
preparation for on-site visits.  At the Supreme Committee for 
Elections and Referenda, the Chairman and MEPI-funded 
implementors NDI and IFES discussed the close cooperation 
that resulted in a forty percent increase in women\'s voter 
registration, excellent election day administration and the 
most peaceful election ever despite some acknowledged flaws. 
Burns visited a local NGO train-the-trainers workshop for the 
MEPI-funded project to eradicate women\'s illiteracy.  He also 
saw the Sailah municipal drainage project in central Sanaa 
that provides improved flood control and sanitation. 
American Institute for Yemen Studies (AIYS) briefed the A/S 
on the plans for the new MEPI-funded building that will 
increase cultural and academic exchanges and understanding 
between Yemen and the U.S.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Embassy Sanaa Development Team -- Practical Focus on 
the Most Troubled Governorates 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2.  (u)  Embassy Sanaa\'s Development Team briefed A/S Burns 
on Post\'s efforts to effectively tap all available funding 
(AID, MEPI, monetized food aid) and expertise to create 
complementary and effective USG programs.  USAID highlighted 
the team\'s strategy for both short-term high-impact projects 
and long-term development in four main sectors -- health, 
education, private sector development (primarily through 
agriculture) and democracy and governance.  Health programs 
in Marib were highlighted to illustrate the team\'s emphasis 
on fostering development primarily in five remote and tribal 
governorates where services and government control are 
lacking, an important complement to Post\'s counter-terrorism 
goals. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
MEPI/Elections 2003: 
Excellent Cooperation between SCER, NDI, IFES 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (u) The Supreme Committee for Elections and Referenda 
(SCER) hosted A/S Burns, the National Democratic Institute 
(NDI) and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems 
(IFES) for a discussion on the April 2003 parliamentary 
elections and MEPI-funded assistance.  SCER Chairman Khalid 
Ash Sharif welcomed A/S Burns and thanked him for the 
assistance provided through the Middle East Partnership 
Initiative (MEPI) to NDI and IFES, which he praised as 
instrumental to the success of the election.  Ash Sharif 
detailed the technical preparations for voter registration 
and election day, showing materials such as IFES-assisted 
voter registration books that helped increase women\'s 
registration by 40% -- making women 42% of the electorate. 
He noted vital NDI\'s role; agreeing with NDI Director Robin 
Madrid that the cooperation helped the SCER act as a bridge 
between government and the opposition parties to alleviate 
suspicion and dampen the potential for violence. 
 
4. (u) A/S Burns said it was important for the United States 
to support Yemen\'s goals in economic development and 
democratic reform through partnership.  He noted that \"Yemen 
was out ahead of other societies in the region on many 
democratic reforms\" but that there were \"more challenges on 
the road ahead.\"  Burns said the U.S. was proud to have found 
practical ways to encourage democratic reform through NDI and 
IFES and pledged to seek more resources through MEPI and 
other avenues to continue providing support.  Ash Sharif 
welcomed continued cooperation, noting that the current and 
future programs outlined by NDI and IFES Director Enrique 
Saltos during the meeting would be very important to Yemen\'s 
continued democratic development. 
 
---------------------- 
Eradicating Illiteracy 
---------------------- 
 
5.  (u)  A/S Burns visited SOUL\'s (Women and Children\'s 
Development Association) two U.S.-sponsored workshops.  As 
part of the $2 million MEPI-funded eradication of women\'s 
illiteracy project implemented by CARE, SOUL hosted a 
train-the-trainers workshop for CARE workers to conduct 
baseline surveys and assessments.  CARE contracted SOUL to 
conduct evaluation and training for the project, which is 
designed to provide basic education to women who have been 
left behind by the educational system.  A/S Burns was also 
briefed on SOUL\'s training of local NGO capacity, which was 
funded through Democracy Small Grants. 
 
-------------- 
Sailah Project 
-------------- 
 
6. (u) During transits between meetings, A/S Burns was shown 
the Sailah municipal drainage and flood control project, 
funded primarily via more than $15 million dollars of USG 
monetized food aid assistance over the last several years. 
The Sailah project is a channel through central Sana\'a that 
has been instrumental in controlling flooding and the flow of 
water during the rainy season.  It has drastically improved 
the health and sanitation situation in the city. 
 
------------------------------------ 
American Institute for Yemen Studies 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (u) A/S Burns met with American Institute for Yemen 
Studies (AIYS) Director Chris Edens to discuss support for 
on-going research and fellowships, renovations of cultural 
sites, and efforts to increase U.S.-Yemen understanding 
through the exchange of research and ideas.  The A/S and 
Edens discussed AIYS\'s ability, as a non-governmental entity 
separate from the U.S. Embassy, to engage in non-traditional 
diplomacy efforts.  AIYS has been forced to move to six 
different locations over the past 25 years.  It currently has 
$500,000 in MEPI funding to purchase a building and compound 
for its offices and hostel facilities.  Both the A/S and 
Edens agreed that having a permanent location would provide 
the security and infrastructure for AIYS to expand its 
capacity to promote interests beyond economic development and 
culture. 
 
------------------------- 
Burns Meets Embassy Staff 
------------------------- 
 
8. (u) A/S Burns spoke to all Embassy staff about U.S.-Yemen 
cooperation on security and development, Iraq and the 
Israeli-Palestinian situation.  The Ambassador hosted an 
in-house barbecue that provided an excellent opportunity for 
the Embassy\'s junior officers to meet A/S Burns.

1.  Pol/Econ Officer and Commercial Specialist visited 
Mohamed Abdulrahman Kawkaban, the General Manager of Summer 
Tour and Travel located on Hadha Street, Sanaa.  Kawkaban is 
also an owner and executive officer of the Kawkaban Modern 
Center, a separate company that brokered the procurement 
order (reftel) on behalf of the Minister of Interior (MOI) 
for the Central Security Organization (CSO) of the MOI. 
 
2.  Kawkaban reported that five items were initially ordered: 
tactical vests, ceramic protective plates, tactical helmets, 
gas masks, and face shields.  This complete order was 
initially to be procured from an undisclosed French company; 
after meetings with the U.S.-based firm Armor Holdings 
Company (which has branches in UAE, London, and Paris), 
Kawkaban elected to procure the equipment from the U.S. 
company due to their more competitive prices and higher 
standards of quality.  He further explained that after a 
misunderstanding regarding the specifications of some of the 
products which were being ordered from Armor Holding, 
Kawkaban canceled the order for the helmets and the face 
shields with no plans to reorder them.  The order was thus 
reduced to three items.  According to Kawkaban, the tactical 
vests are being shipped from the London-based branch of the 
Armor Holding company, and the ceramic plates and gas masks 
are being shipped from the U.S.  All three items on the order 
are still pending delivery in the near future.  Post can 
schedule a follow-up visit once the materials arrive in 
country. 
 
3.  Kawkaban and his business enterprise appeared to be 
above-board.  Kawkaban was open to discussing his business, 
business contacts, and the details of the purchases, to 
include confirmation of the end-user, the officers in charge 
of the procurement for the CSO, and his contact with them. 
Kawkaban explained that Summer Tour and Travel is owned by 
the Al-Maz Group, a large and fairly well-known enterprise; 
he said there is no relationship between his Kawkaban Modern 
Center company and Al-Maz other than the fact that he is the 
GM for the travel agency, and on occasion, uses their 
computers, faxes, and office spaces for his personal 
business.  Kawkaban is a family business and company which 
was founded by his father who established the entity in 1967. 
 Currently, Kawkaban manages the company with his brothers. 
Post\'s commercial section has little information on the 
company which specializes in import and export, specifically 
for various ROYG ministries and agencies.

1. SUMMARY AND COMMENT: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
William Burns\'s visit to Yemen received wide and positive 
coverage in the Yemeni media in general.  Without commenting 
on the visit, some papers published straight coverage of his 
meetings with President Saleh and with the Supreme 
Commission for Elections and Referenda. This time, the media 
coverage of a visit made by a top US official to Yemen was 
less negative than has often been the case in the past.  END 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
 
2. \"Al-Thawra 10/04\" (official daily) carried straight 
reporting of the visit and indicated that Burns discussed 
international and regional developments including U.S.- 
Yemeni co-operation in the areas of security, counter- 
terrorism and development with the President. 
 
 
3.  Yemen TV conducted an exclusive interview with A/S Burns 
on October 4.  Questions focused on US aid to Yemen, the 
future of Palestine and the Road Map and US plans for Iraq 
and the Guantanamo prisoners.  The interviewer raised a 
question quoting Yemen\'s Prime Minister, Dr. Bajamal, who 
said in a recent interview with Reuters that the US is 
making impossible demands on Yemen in the war on terror and 
providing little aid in return.  A/S Burns disagreed with 
the Prime Minister and told Yemen TV that it was in the 
interest of Yemen to have secure borders and fight violent 
extremists threatening Yemen\'s economy.  Burns also added 
that Yemen benefited more than any other Arab country from 
the Middle East Partnership Initiative.  Yemen TV broadcast 
the interview in English with no Arabic subtitles. 
 
4. The bi-weekly English-language Yemen Times 10/06 
published excerpts of the Yemen TV interview with Burns.  It 
also covered his visits to the NGOs implementing programs 
funded by the US Embassy in Sana\'a. 
 
5. Al-Sahwa.net of the Islamist Yemeni Congregation for 
Reform party (Islah) reported Sunday 10/05 that the visit 
was to discuss counter-terroris stating:  \"The U.S. 
official\'s talks with President Saleh focused on the Yemeni 
government performance in counter-terrorism.\" 
 
6. \"Annas\" independent weekly 10/06, published an op-ed 
article commenting that A/S Burns\'s visit to Yemen aimed to 
put pressure on Yemen \"to comply to more US demands at the 
level of security and in relation with the situations in 
Palestine and Iraq.\"

1. (C) Summary: During a 10/4/03 call on FM Qirbi, NEA A/S 
Burns reviewed U.S.-Yemeni CT cooperation and focused on U.S. 
development assistance.  Burns stressed the need for Yemen to 
pursue domestic reforms as the U.S. works to increase 
assistance, e.g. via MEPI and, if Yemen qualifies, the MCA. 
Qirbi agreed on the need for reforms, particularly judiciary. 
 They reviewed Yemeni cooperation with the Gulf states and 
interaction with the Horn of Africa.  A/S Burns stressed the 
need for an Article 98 agreement.  Qirbi said ROYG 
ratification of the Rome Statute was not imminent, and 
undertook to work the Article 98 issue within the Cabinet. 
Burns also underscored the need for Yemeni cooperation to 
ensure success of Embassy Sanaa\'s 10/5 diplomatic support 
flight, and Qirbi was supportive.  On Iraq, Burns thanked 
Qirbi for Yemen\'s support of AL recognition of the Iraqi 
Governing Council (IGC), and they agreed on the need for 
security and steps to place maximum authority in Iraqi hands. 
 Qirbi said the Palestine situation is still \"worrisome\" and 
expressed concerns that U.S. presidential elections next year 
would weaken efforts to implement the roadmap.  Septels 
report A/S Burns\' meetings with President Saleh, other Yemeni 
officials and NGOs.  End summary. 
 
YEMEN COMMITTED TO COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION 
 
2. (C) NEA A/S Burns, accompanied by Ambassador, DCM and 
Pol/Econ Chief (notetaker) called on FM Abubaker al-Qirbi on 
10/4/03 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Qirbi also 
hosted a lunch iho A/S Burns later in the day. 
 
3. (C) A/S Burns and Ambassador praised the ROYG\'s recent 
success in apprehending a terrorist cell (ref a), but 
stressed the need for Yemen to stay ahead of al-Qaida to 
prevent it from reorganizing.  Ambassador noted that the both 
the A/S and GEN Abizaid met Central Security Force (CSF) 
Chief of Staff COL Yahya Saleh and had paid informative 
visits to the CSF range.  Qirbi said that Yemen has 
demonstrated a commitment to transparency and is no longer 
trying to hide terrorist operations.  He admitted there is 
room for more progress on CT and mentioned the need for 
training and logistical support, saying the ROYG is working 
to track and arrest terrorists to eliminate Yemen as a 
breeding ground for terrorism. 
 
4. (C) On developing the Coast Guard, both A/S Burns and AMB 
Hull emphasized the need not just for equipment, but for 
training and developing the infrastructure to support 
cost-efficient Coast Guard, Navy and commercial operations. 
 
IMPROVED COOPERATION WITH SAUDI ARABIA; YEMEN SEEKS SUPPORT 
FOR INCREASED ROLE IN GCC 
 
5. (C) FM Qirbi said that Yemen and Saudi Arabia are starting 
to see more \"eye-to-eye\" on the issue, resulting in 
increasing cooperation and transparency after \"shying away\" 
from issues of terrorism for the past several years.  He 
expressed hope that Yemen will be able to expand CT 
cooperation to other Gulf states.  Referring to the 
Secretary\'s annual meeting with GCC Foreign Ministers during 
 
SIPDIS 
the UNGA, Qirbi asked that Yemen be included in such regional 
contacts when the subject is counter-terrorism. 
 
6. (C) Qirbi said that Qatar and Oman, and UAE to a lesser 
degree, support a greater role for Yemen within the GCC. 
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are less certain.  Qirbi said his 
goal for the next Gulf states summit in 12/03 is to push for 
more economic development and freer markets, as well as 
expanded acceptance of Yemeni workers in the Gulf states. 
Yemeni labor is not a threat to security, he said. 
 
DEVELOPING HOA RELATIONSHIPS TO PROMOTE REGIONAL STABILITY 
 
7. (C) A/S Burns suggested that Yemen could assist the USG in 
developing regional policy toward the Horn of Africa 
countries to track with security cooperation already underway 
with that region.  Qirbi welcomed the idea, noting that Yemen 
is affected by events in the Horn, and reviewed current 
issues in the area.  Refugees, mainly from Somalia and 
Eritrea, affect economic conditions, political stability, and 
social and health factors in Yemen.  Qirbi expressed concern, 
in particular, that the continuing lack of a government 
Somalia could turn it into the next Afghanistan as a 
terrorist haven. 
 
8. (C) The FM identified Yemen\'s objectives in the region as 
security -- especially enhanced CT cooperation -- and 
economic/political cooperation.  He observed that close 
relations among Yemen, Sudan and Ethiopia did not define an 
\"exclusive club,\" noting that Ethiopia was wooing Kenya and 
he would invite Djibouti to closer coordination during a 
pending visit. 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: FOCUS ON JUDICIAL REFORM AND REDUCING 
CORRUPTION 
 
9. (C) Qirbi characterized development in Yemen\'s more remote 
areas as \"minuscule,\" and said Yemen is looking to MCA to 
help it fund projects.  He acknowledged that the ROYG must 
tackle some issues in order to qualify, specifying judicial 
reform, corruption and economic reform as areas \"acceptable\" 
to the government and president Saleh for focus.  A/S Burns 
agreed on the need for reform.  He stressed that progress 
would enable the USG to do more on economic assistance. 
 
10. (C) A/S Burns pointed out that Yemen has been the biggest 
beneficiary of MEPI in the region and said the program could 
expand in future.  He acknowledged Yemen\'s progress on 
democracy and the electoral process, but said there is still 
a need to close holes in the process.  FM Qirbi agreed. 
Burns added that MEPI can be used as a bridge to MCA, and 
that Yemen should set its sights on qualifying in 2005 -- an 
ambitious but achievable goal. 
 
11. (C) Qirbi agreed that qualifying for MCA is critical and 
cited the need to encourage more private investment in Yemen. 
 He said previous attempts to stimulate investment had been 
\"futile,\" and that Yemen needs the expertise of the U.S. and 
Europe to improve. 
 
ARTICLE 98 
 
12. (C) A/S Burns emphasized the need for Yemen to reach an 
Article 98 agreement soon.  He told Qirbi that 70 countries 
have already entered into such agreements, including Egypt, 
Kuwait and Morocco, and that those agreements offered several 
possible models for a U.S.-Yemeni agreement.  He reminded 
Qirbi that ratification of the Rome Statute before completing 
an Article 98 agreement would result in cessation of U.S. 
assistance.  Qirbi said that the Statute had been returned by 
the Parliament to the government, so ratification would be 
delayed.  Recalling his meeting with PM Senior Adviser Bodine 
during his recent U.S. visit, the FM said he had discussed 
two possible options and Bodine had promised to send him a 
third option for consideration as well.  A/S Burns welcomed 
Qirbi\'s active engagement on the Article 98 issue and urged 
conclusion of an agreement by year\'s end.  Qirbi promised to 
consult internally with an eye to concluding and agreement 
enshrined in an exchange of letters. 
 
DIPLOMATIC POUCH/SUPPORT FLIGHTS 
 
13. (C) Turning to Embassy Sanaa\'s scheduled diplomatic 
support flight the following day (10/5), Ambassador stressed 
the need to avoid a repetition of the failed 8/31 flight, 
which cost the USG $70,000.00.  A/S Burns underscored the 
point, noting that expanding U.S. assistance programs 
required reliable pouch and support flight services for the 
Embassy.  FM Qirbi agreed, noting that arrangements had been 
coordinated with the Embassy and the MFA would have a 
representative at the airport to smooth any difficulties. 
(Note:  The diplomatic support flight was off-loaded without 
impediment or delay.  End note.) 
 
IRAQ: SECURITY AND SOVEREIGNTY 
 
14. (C) Qirbi referred to the pending UNSCR on Iraq, agreeing 
with A/S Burns that security was the immediate priority in 
Iraq.  He observed that Yemen and the USG have the same 
objectives, including transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi 
people and the writing of a new Iraqi constitution, and urged 
the U.S. to be \"flexible\" in working toward those aims. 
Burns expressed thanks for Qirbi\'s support of Arab League 
acceptance of the IGC at its September ministerial in Cairo. 
 
 
ISRAEL-PALESTINE: PRESSURE TO MAKE BOTH SIDES MEET OBLIGATIONS 
 
15. (C) Qirbi said that the situation in Palestine is still 
\"worrisome,\" and that he is concerned that the focus will 
shift away from the Israel-Palestine conflict in the run-up 
to the 2004 U.S. presidential elections.  He praised 
President Bush as the first U.S. president to acknowledge 
Palestinian\'s right to a state, and emphasized the need to 
implement the roadmap.  He said that the U.S. and Yemen need 
to work together to make Palestine and Israel come around, 
noting that Palestine can be \"easily pressured\" but Israel 
will listen only to the U.S.  Burns responded that the new PA 
government will need to make tough choices to stop the 
violence and Israel must adhere to its commitments.

1. (c) On October 12, Pol/Econ Chief met with Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Director of the Americas Office Abdulsalem 
Qassim al-Awadhi to re-deliver and discuss the  Proliferation 
Security Initiative (PSI) Statement of Interdiction 
Principles (refs a and b) and to review the questions and 
answers in reftel c.  Pol/Econoff reiterated the U.S. request 
for support for the initiative and feedback on the ROYG\'s 
views on how such principles could be incorporated into 
existing counter-terrorism efforts, as well as whether there 
are concerns about whether Yemen\'s domestic laws can support 
the initiative.  Al-Awadhi assured Pol/Econoff that he had 
passed the information on the initiative delivered September 
9 (ref b) to the responsible parties in the foreign 
minister\'s office, the prime ministry, and the presidency. 
He said he expected a request for recommendations from his 
office, and that he did not see any obvious problems with 
supporting the initiative. 
 
2. (c) Al-Awadhi was not aware of the letter the UK 
Ambassador to Yemen recently forwarded to FM Qirbi on the 
PSI, but said that his office would coordinate with the 
Office of European Affairs on a response, if necessary.  He 
was unable to provide a timeline for a substantive response. 
 
3. (c) Comment:  Director al-Awadhi gave the impression that 
a response on the PSI was unlikely to come from his office, 
but needed to be addressed at a much higher level.  From the 
conversation, it was clear that while al-Awadhi might be 
comfortable with the general approach of the PSI, he is not 
familiar enough with Yemeni law on the subject to speak to 
its compatibility with the initiative.  End comment.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: SCUL, YM, KSEP OEXC 
SUBJECT: SANAA AMERICAN CORNER PROJECT PROPOSAL 
 
1.  Post requests funding to establish American Corner 
partnerships with six public institutions in Yemen. 
Institutions include Dhamar University, Hodeidah University, 
Sana\'a University, Aden University, Taiz University and the 
Sana\'a Public Library.  John Balian, PAO, is the designated 
point of contact for the program and will provide oversight in 
developing the partnership in conjunction with the APAO. 
 
2.  Post is targeting these six institutions as a means of 
promoting MPP goals by increasing knowledge of the English 
language, American society, culture, politics and economics 
and by expanding the reach of Embassy programs into rural 
Yemen.  The overwhelming majority of Yemenis have little or no 
knowledge of American culture, history, politics, etc. 
although Yemenis that we meet as we travel around Yemen 
express a genuine interest in opportunities to learn more 
about the United States.  Yemenis are hungry for knowledge and 
post is targeting areas in Yemen that do not normally receive 
development or educational aid.  Institutions are listed in 
order of preference. 
 
3.  Dhamar University is located approximately two hours by 
car from the capital Sana\'a and serves as the primary 
educational facility for about two dozen tribal areas.  The 
University\'s president, who is a US alumnus, has been working 
to expand the size and outreach of the university so that it 
can affect the lives of youths living in this largely 
agricultural area.  A new library/computer center has been 
built and is waiting to be fitted with computer equipment, 
furnishings and books.  The President of the University is 
enthusiastic about using the currently empty space for an 
American Corner. 
 
4. Dhamar University Budget: 
 
25 Computer stations          $50,000 
Electronic Resources            10,000 
Books                      40,000 
 
Total                         $100,000 
 
5.  Sana\'a Public Library is the only national public library 
in Yemen and it has been inadequately funded for many years. 
The library previously had one computer dating from around 
1985 and Post recently donated five computers to help the 
library transfer its card catalogue to the computer.  The 
library director will open up space in the library\'s main 
building for the American Corner collection so that it may 
serve as a useful reference for researchers and the general 
Yemeni population.  Many researchers, students and members of 
the general public use the public library as a reference 
source as the university libraries, even in the capital city, 
are inadequate. 
 
6.  Sana\'a Public Library Budget: 
 
25 Computer stations          $50,000 
Electronic Resources            10,000 
Books                      40,000 
 
Total                         $100,000 
 
7.  Even though Hodeidah University is a relatively new 
institution, it has succeeded in serving the entire western 
region of Yemen and the American Corner project will provide a 
unique opportunity for their students, staff and faculty 
members.  Previously, Post had not had a great deal of direct 
contact with the university due to its location far from the 
capital.  However, since initial contact, post has been 
developing new ways to work in conjunction with this 
university.  Post believes that this university will continue 
to provide an ideal outlet for reaching young people in this 
Red Sea region of Yemen.  The staff at the university will 
work closely with post to coordinate and run the American 
Corner smoothly and successfully. 
 
8.  Hodeidah University Budget: 
 
25 Computer stations          $50,000 
Electronic Resources            10,000 
Books                      40,000 
 
Total                         $100,000 
 
9. Taiz University is located approximately four hours by car 
from the capital Sana\'a and has a student body of around 
35,000.  The American Corner project at Taiz University will 
not only be made available to the university\'s large student 
body but also to various institutions working in Taiz 
conducting research and development work.  This is the largest 
university in central Yemen. 
 
10.  Taiz University Budget 
 
15 Computer stations          $30,000 
Electronic Resources            10,000 
Books                      35,000 
 
Total                         $75,000 
 
11.  Aden University reaches students in the south of Yemen 
and continues to rely largely on staff trained in the former 
Soviet Union.  Western influence into the teaching staff, 
materials and curriculum of Aden University is relatively new. 
The university is anxious to provide additional information 
regarding American and the West to its staff and students. 
 
12.  Aden University Budget: 
 
15 Computer stations          $30,000 
Electronic Resources            10,000 
Books                      35,000 
 
Total                         $75,000 
 
13.  Although Sana\'a University is located in the capital of 
Sana\'a it, like all Yemeni universities, has been inadequately 
funded and has not been able to keep up with modern technology 
and resources.  Many individuals who graduate from the 
university with a major in English lack the language ability 
to communicate effectively and know little to nothing of 
American culture, history, politics, etc. as most universities 
teach British English literature and use resources previously 
donated by the British.  There is little to no American 
influence.  The university administration is enthusiastic 
about introducing American materials into university studies 
and making such information available to university students. 
 
14.  Sana\'a University Budget: 
 
15 Computer stations          $30,000 
Electronic Resources            10,000 
Books                      35,000 
 
Total                         $75,000 
 
15.  Easch of the institutions Post has selected as a  partner 
in an American Corner project affords the means for Post to 
reach out to a younger audience, to provide knowledge and 
information to the remote rural areas of Yemen and to engage 
the widest audience possible.  Computers and electronic 
resources comprise a large portion of each request.  Post\'s 
MPP has focused on providing internet and computer resources 
to the rural areas of Yemen.  This component of the American 
Corner project would complement a current post project of 
providing internet classrooms to secondary schools throughout 
Yemen.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
------------------ 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Demonstrations 
 
A. Are there any ethnic or religious communities in country 
that are capable of carrying out significant anti-American 
demonstrations? 
 
Yes, Muslim Yemeni pro-Palestinian/pro-Iraqi/anti-American 
demonstrators. 
 
B. Have there been anti-American demonstrations in the 
country within the last 12 months? 
 
On March 21, 2003, a march of 5-7,000 people protesting the 
war in Iraq was stopped by police approximately 1/4 mile from 
the U.S. Embassy; violent confrontations resulted in the 
death of several police and protesters. 
 
In Winter 2002 - 2003, Yemeni women held demonstrations in 
front of the German Embassy protesting the arrest of Sheikh 
Moayed in Frankfurt, Germany, on terrorism charges. 
 
In March, 2003, Yemenis held several anti-war demonstrations, 
most near the UN headquarters complex in Sanaa, Tahrir Square 
and Old Airport Road, all several miles from the Embassy. 
 
C. Have these demonstrations taken place near or in front of 
U.S. diplomatic facilities? 
 
The usual sites for anti-American gatherings are in areas of 
Sanaa away from the Embassy, however, the above-mentioned 
March 21, 2003 event took place nearby. 
 
D. What is the average size of an anti-American demonstration? 
 
Depending on the location, up to several hundred people.  In 
our experience, demonstrations in front of the Embassy are 
usually less than 100 people.  Peaceful demonstrations 
protesting the war in Iraq have ranged from approximately 
1,000 to 100,000, by some media accounts.  Local press 
routinely carry inflated estimates ranging from half a 
million to one million-plus. 
 
E. Are these anti-American demonstrations usually triggered 
by U.S. foreign policy initiatives, military actions, or by 
domestic issues? 
 
U.S. foreign policy initiatives and military/law enforcement 
counter-terrorism endeavors, in addition to ROYG cooperation 
with the USG. 
 
F. Are these demonstrations generally violent or peaceful? 
 
Generally peaceful.  Demonstrations must be coordinated and 
approved by ROYG in advance, consequently, the vast majority 
are peaceful.  If not approved in advance, ROYG forces will 
disband a demonstration. 
 
G. If violent, have any demonstrations resulted in damage to 
USG property or injuries to USG employees? 
 
No, however, Yemeni police and protester fatalities in March 
2003 were due in large part to the intervention of host 
government security protecting the U.S. Embassy. 
 
H. If violent, have any demonstrations ever penetrated our 
perimeter security line? 
 
No. 
 
I. Have there been anti-government demonstrations in the 
country within the last 12 months? 
 
Yes, directed at specific policies, including child labor, 
education and bringing mosques under government control. 
Several anti-government demonstrations occurred in Sanaa and 
Aden. 
 
J. Have these demonstrations taken place near or in front of 
U.S. diplomatic facilities? 
 
No. 
 
K. What is the average size of an anti-government 
demonstration? 
Fairly small, approximately 50 to 200 individuals, similar to 
anti-U.S. protests. 
 
L. Are these demonstrations generally violent or peaceful? 
 
Generally peaceful. 
 
M. If violent, have any demonstrations resulted in damage to 
USG property? 
 
No. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Macro Conflict Conditions 
A. Is the host country currently engaged in an interstate or 
intrastate conflict? 
 
Host country is cooperating with U.S. efforts to identify and 
stop/attack terrorist targets within Yemen.  In this regard, 
the ROYG in recent months has demonstrated willingness to 
engage in fairly large-scale hostile operations against an 
identified terrorist force -- e.g. in Abyan in July 2003. 
 
B. If an intrastate conflict, is it an insurgency that is 
limited to a specific region or a country-wide civil war? 
 
Host government counter-terrorism operations tend to occur in 
areas where terrorists strike first.  ROYG\'s actions are 
usually reactive, following attacks perpetrated by the 
terrorists.  However, when ROYG believes taking the 
initiative is in its interests, it has struck first. 
 
C. If limited to a specific region, are any U.S. diplomatic 
facilities located in this region? 
 
Yes.  In Sanaa: the U.S. Embassy; Yemen America Language 
Institute (YALI), which is part of the Embassy; and the Sanaa 
International School (SIS), which employs American teachers. 
 
D. Have any of the factions involved in these intrastate 
conflicts signaled or demonstrated an anti-American 
orientation? 
 
Yes, al-Qaeda members and tribesmen sympathetic to al-Qaeda\'s 
ideology or beholden to an al-Qaeda element for past support. 
 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Host Country Capabilities 
 
A. Are law enforcement agencies professional and well-trained? 
 
They are often corrupt, poorly trained and underpaid.  For 
example, an average officer earns 60 USD per month.  A 
captain with 20 years experience earns only 120 per month.  A 
Brigadier General earns 300 USD per month.  This economic 
condition -- reflecting Yemen\'s widespread poverty (average 
per capita income is less than USD 400 countrywide) -- 
fosters widespread corruption that possibly could be 
diminished with increased remuneration.  Further, law 
enforcement agencies face numerous challenges regarding 
planning, coordination and execution of complex 
counter-terrorism operations.  Reliance on manpower is 
emphasized over the use of technology.  Agencies have 
difficulty maintaining operations security and have 
difficulty operating in a nighttime environment.  As 
evidenced by observation at the August 9, 2002, blast site, 
Yemeni law enforcement\'s ability to conduct a complex 
criminal investigation resulting in a successful resolution 
is limited, despite relevant training and equipment provided 
in the past by European donors. 
 
In July - August 2003, 24 host government police 
investigators from across the country participated in a 
two-week DS/ATA Terrorist Crime Scene investigation course 
taught by Evidence Response Team FBI special agents. 
 
 
B. Have they been trained by U.S. agencies? 
 
Some officers have received DS/ATA training, however, the 
full impact of this training will be manifest only over the 
long term.  The Regional Security Office does maintain 
high-level contacts within the Ministry of Interior who 
received ATA training. 
 
The Central Security Forces (CSF) is the counter-terrorism 
(CT) arm of the Central Security Organization (CSO).  The CSF 
has been trained by U.K./U.S. personnel for the past year and 
will continue into the next fiscal year.  This unit is being 
equipped and trained.  They are ROYG\'s primary CT force. 
 
C. Are law enforcement agencies confronted with serious, 
widespread corruption inside their agencies? 
 
Yes, see question 3A. 
D. Are the intelligence services professional and capable of 
deterring terrorist actions? 
 
The intelligence services are moderately professional but in 
no way can deter a determined terrorist group. 
E. Have the intelligence services been cooperative with U.S. 
Embassy requests or information and support? 
Yes, but often begrudgingly.  Intelligence services rarely 
volunteer information.  Yet on some occasions the ROYG takes 
the initiative to inform the USG of CT developments -- e.g. 
in the case of ROYG success in September 2003 in disrupting a 
Sanaa-based al-Qaeda cell. 
 
F. Assuming there have been significant terrorist threats in 
recent years, have host country security services been able 
to score any major anti-terrorism successes? 
 
Yes. 
 
G. Has host country been responsive (re: timeliness and 
allocation of resources) to Embassy requests for protective 
security? 
 
Yes. 
 
H. How does the Embassy assess the overall security at major 
airports in the country? 
 
Poor, but the ROYG is quite receptive to additional 
U.S.-funded equipment and security training.  This view is 
corroborated by a recent visit to Sanaa by a two-person 
Transportation Security Administration assessment team. 
 
I. How effective are customs and immigration controls 
agencies? 
 
Ineffective but improving.  Since February 2002, Somali and 
Ethiopian refugees have been entering Yemen at a reported 
rate of approximately 1,500 per month, adding to the 60,000 
refugees previously registered.  They are settling on the 
southern and western coasts, forming criminal and 
prostitution rings along clan lines.  Criminal related 
violence is on the rise.  With USG assistance, the customs 
and immigration services are attempting to standardize and 
modernize equipment and coverage. 
 
J. How effective are border patrol forces? 
 
In the recent past ineffective; however, a current surge of 
more than 7,000 troops from MOI/MOD resources and increased 
cooperation by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (to include 
collaboration on intelligence and smuggling information) has 
generally improved the effectiveness of border patrol forces. 
 
 
-------------------- 
INDIGENOUS TERRORISM 
-------------------- 
 
4. (S/NF)  Anti-American Terrorist Groups 
 
A. Are there indigenous, anti-American terrorist groups in 
country? 
 
Yes. 
 
B. If yes, how many? 
 
Four are known: Aden-Abyan Islamic Army (AAIA); Yemen Islamic 
Jihad; al-Qaeda Sympathizers; Yemen Hizballah. 
 
C. Have these groups carried out an anti-American attacks 
within the last 12 months? 
 
No, however potential attacks may have been foiled due to 
pre-emptive U.S. strikes and joint U.S.-Yemeni operations. 
 
D. Were any of these lethal attacks? 
 
N/A. 
 
E. Have these groups attacked U.S. diplomatic facilities? 
N/A. 
F. Have these groups attacked U.S. business, U.S. military, 
or related targets? 
 
N/A. 
 
G. Have these groups limited their attacks to specific 
regions or do they operate country-wide? 
 
N/A, but these groups do possess the capability to operate 
country-wide. 
 
H. If their attacks are limited to regions, are there any 
U.S. diplomatic facilities located in these regions? 
 
See 4G. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Other Indigenous Terrorist Groups 
 
A. Are there other indigenous terrorist groups (not 
anti-American) in country? 
 
Yes. 
 
B. If yes, how many? 
 
Two: National Liberation Front (MAWJ) and the Right to 
Self-Determination Movement (HATM). 
 
C. Have these groups carried out attacks in the capital or in 
areas where U.S. diplomatic facilities are located? 
 
No known incidents of this type. 
 
D. Were these attacks lethal and/or indiscriminate? 
 
None known. 
 
E. Have any Americans ever been killed or injured in these 
attacks? 
 
No. 
 
 
----------------------- 
TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM 
----------------------- 
 
6. (S/NF)  Transnational Terrorist Indicators 
 
A. Are there any foreign terrorist groups that have a 
presence in country? 
 
Yes.  Al-Qaeda, Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), al-Gama\'a 
al-Islamiyya (AKA: The Islamic Group), Libyan Islamic 
Fighting Group (LIFG), Algerian Islamic Group GIA), Salafi 
Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), Hamas, Palestinian 
Islamic Jihad, PFLP, Hizballah.  The Iraqi Intelligence 
Service formerly maintained a presence in Yemen, but is no 
longer visible in the aftermath of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
 
B. How does the EAC assess this presence? Is it an 
operational cell?  Financial cell?  Support cell?  Propaganda 
cell? 
 
Al-Qaeda: all of the above.  Many, but not all, of these 
other groups maintain close links or cooperate directly with 
al-Qaeda, thus bolstering their operational capabilities. 
 
C. Is the host government sympathetic to these groups? 
 
ROYG officially supports Palestinian groups, including Hamas 
and Hizballah, but support is mainly rhetorical and does not 
extend to operational activities inside Yemen. 
 
D. Are there suspect non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in 
the country that have a relationship with any of these groups?

E. Are there any ethnic or religious communities in country 
that are sympathetic to these groups? 
 
Many Yemenis in rural/tribal areas are deemed sympathetic to 
the ideology of al-Qaeda.  Public sympathy for 
pro-Palestinian/anti-Israeli groups is widespread. 
 
F. How does the EAC assess the level, intent, and scope of 
hostile intelligence services (Iran, Iraq, Syria, Serbia, 
Sudan, et. al.) in country relative to potential 
anti-American terrorist acts? 
 
Foreign hostile intelligence services, e.g. Syria, are 
primarily focused on information gathering for their own 
countries\' interests, not to assist anti-American groups in 
country with terrorist activity.  However, the notion that a 
country such as Iran maintains connections with terrorist 
groups in Yemen is highly likely. 
 
G. How does the EAC assess the availability of weapons and 
explosives in country or from nearby countries for hostile 
terrorist elements? 
 
Yemen likely has among the highest number of weapons per 
capita in the world, with easy access to varieties of 
explosives.  Weapons and explosives are easily attainable and 
quite inexpensive.  Tribal-owned gun markets are large, and 
in some cases may be better stocked than host country 
military and law enforcement arsenals. 
 
Though Yemen is awash in numerous types of weapons, the 
Yemeni cabinet approved a series of amendments to a 1992 gun 
control law intended to bolster regulation of weapons 
possession and trafficking.  These amendments must gain 
approval by the Yemeni Parliament before becoming law. 
Parliamentary opposition to the amendments remains 
significant; more than 150 MPs have reportedly signed a 
petition to quash the gun control law that is still under 
discussion.  Accordingly, Speaker of the Parliament Sheikh 
Abdullah al-Ahmar has publicly equated possession of weapons 
as a Yemeni symbol of manhood. 
 
In a separate effort, the ROYG has initiated a weapons 
buy-back program, at a reported cost of 38 million USD, 
intended to acquire Man Portable Air Defense Systems 
(MANPADS), rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) and a variety of 
other heavy weapons from civilian weapons markets.  Citing 
the acquisition of over 1,400 MANPADS from January to June 
2003, ROYG says the program is a success.  There are 
problems, however, such as: 1) cataloguing weapons; 2) ROYG 
paying over market value; and 3) the sustainability of the 
weapons buy-back program.

1. (C) Summary: Defense Minister Aliwa informed Ambassador on 
10/20 that an August visit of North Korea\'s Deputy Minister 
of Industry had yielded agreement for DPRK experts to install 
replacement parts needed to restore defective SCUDs to 
operational status.  In response to precise questioning by 
Ambassador, Aliwa stressed that the missiles would be 
repaired, not enhanced, and that the repairs would mark the 
end of Yemeni military cooperation with the DPRK.  He noted 
that the ROYG had cancelled plans for North Korean 
construction of a naval facility at Hodeida, and was seeking 
an alternative contractor: perhaps China or Japan.  Aliwa 
said he was briefing the Ambassador in accordance with 
Saleh\'s decision -- following the visits of U/S Bolton and 
NEA A/S Burns -- to end military cooperation with North 
Korea.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador, accompanied by DCM and OMC Chief, called 
on Defense Minister BG Abdullah Ali Aliwa on 10/20 at the 
latter\'s request.  Aliwa was joined by senior military staff 
and Dirham Saidi of the MFA\'s Americas Desk.  Aliwa explained 
that the virtually unprecedented attendance of an MFA 
representative at a MoD meeting reflected the ROYG\'s desire 
to maintain internal coordination of DPRK-related contacts 
with the U.S. Embassy. 
 
------------ 
SCUD Repairs 
------------ 
 
3. (C) Aliwa said he had requested the meeting at the behest 
of President Saleh to \"keep the USG in the picture\" on ROYG 
contacts with North Korea.  He noted that the briefing was 
consistent with Saleh\'s commitment -- following the 6/03 
visit of U/S Bolton, as reviewed in the early October visit 
of NEA A/S Burns -- to end contacts with North Korea 
(reftels). 
 
4. (C) The Minister briefly recounted Yemen\'s \"problem\": some 
of the SCUDs received in 12/02 were non-functional because 
certain components were old and defective.  At Yemen\'s 
request, a senior DPRK official -- the Deputy Minister of 
Industry -- had visited during August to discuss the matter. 
(Note: The visit was not/not publicized in Yemen.  End Note) 
Yemen\'s demand for a monetary refund was not accepted, but 
after 10 days of negotiation a \"solution\" was agreed.  North 
Korea is to send a team of experts with the spare parts 
necessary to restore the defective missiles to working order. 
 They will come \"soon,\" and remain as long as necessary to 
complete the job. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
No Missile Upgrade; No Future Cooperation 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Ambassador questioned Aliwa closely for further 
details.  The Minister appeared unable to address technical 
aspects -- e.g. what parts are defective: propulsion? 
guidance? -- but gave repeated and emphatic assurance that 
the process would involve merely repair.  There will be no 
upgrade, no extension of range, and no enhancement of missile 
capabilities in any respect.  In response to further 
questioning, BG Aliwa stressed that there would be no further 
payment by Yemen, as the repairs were within the scope of the 
old agreement under which the missiles were delivered. 
Moreover, the presence of the North Korean technical team 
would not be prolonged or evolve into some new technical 
cooperation.  They would depart once the work was complete, 
and Yemeni technicians were prepared to assume comprehensive 
responsibility for the SCUDs in Yemen\'s arsenal. 
 
6. (C) Ambassador reminded Aliwa that the USG had repeatedly 
made clear its view that Yemen should cease all contact with 
the DPRK, and that this was the outcome Washington wanted to 
see. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Hodeida Port: Seeking Alternative Contractors 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) In response to follow-on questioning by Ambassador, 
Aliwa affirmed that Yemen had dropped plans for DPRK 
construction of a military port facility in Hodeida.  He said 
the ROYG was seeking an alternative, perhaps China or Japan. 
 
7. (C) Embassy Sanaa coordinates with Japanese Embassy on 
DPRK-related issues, and on 10/21 DCM briefed Japanese DCM on 
Aliwa\'s message.  He said Japanese were unaware of the North 
Korean deputy minister\'s August visit to Yemen.  He confirmed 
that Saleh had asked the recently arrived Japanese Ambassador 
for Tokyo to support Hodeida port construction.  Japanese 
Ambassador declined, however, because of domestic legal 
constraints on aid projects with military applications. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Aliwa\'s briefing seems to confirm the course the ROYG 
has steered on North Korea since U/S Bolton\'s 6/03 visit: 
visible action to curtail bilateral cooperation, but also a 
desire to get and keep the existing stock of SCUDs 
operational.  The fact that the ROYG briefed the Embassy 
(albeit two months after the DPRK official\'s visit) is 
positive.

 1. (C) Summary:  On 10/22 Foreign Minister Qirbi convened a 
joint meeting with Interior Minister Alimi with key Western 
Embassies to provide an update on the September disruption of 
an al-Qaida cell (refs).  Alimi provided further information 
on ROYG\'s investigation into the cell\'s activities and 
members, particularly information on several recent arrests 
in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, including specific names.  He 
asserted that the \"danger was over\" for Western targets in 
Yemen because MOI believed that all cell members inside Yemen 
had been captured.  Close cooperation between Yemen and Saudi 
Arabia appears to have broken this particular cell. 
Attendees at the briefing included Pol/Econ Chief and Deputy 
(Ambassador was on in-country travel, DCM was out of 
country), the ambassadors of France, Germany, Italy and the 
Netherlands and the UK deputy head of mission.  Despite the 
success of this investigation, Post\'s security practices will 
remain tight. End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
ROYG Message: \"All the Members\" Inside Yemen Arrested; 
\"Danger is Over\" 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2. (C) Interior Minister Alimi said it was \"very important\" 
to provide an update after the last meeting on 9/28 (ref c). 
He noted the 9/28 meeting was held to provide the Embassies a 
warning because of ROYG concern that, despite the capture of 
the main leader of the al-Qaida cell, they had not reached 
all members of the terror cell.  Alimi said he wanted to 
provide a \"clear picture\" of ROYG actions to date, the 
results of the Yemen-Saudi investigation and assurances of 
increased safety to all Embassies that were targets.  He 
noted the MOI was able to arrest \"all the members\" of the 
cell inside Yemen. 
 
3. (C) After the French Ambassador asked for clarification on 
the ROYG\'s message, Alimi said the official message was that 
Yemen is \"safer now\" and that the \"danger is over.\"  In 
response to further questioning by the Dutch Ambassador on 
previous comments by the ROYG that the arrests could be the 
\"tip of the iceberg,\" Alimi said that he judges things 
according to reality and what he can see, but admitted that 
he cannot really know about things he has not yet seen.  He 
invited the French Ambassador to re-open the French Cultural 
Institute, which was closed recently because of security 
concerns, and urged all attendees to send the message back to 
their governments that Yemen was safe. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Cell Information:  New Names, Basoura Captured, 
Financier Still At-Large in Saudi Arabia 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4. (C) Dr. Alimi described the cell as having three groups. 
The first was headed by the main leader, \'Amr Abdul Rahman 
al-Sharif, who remains in custody.  The second was led by a 
financial coordinator named Abdul Rahman Basoura (ref c), who 
went to Saudi Arabia to collect funds to carry out the 
planned attacks.  The Saudis recently handed Basoura over to 
the ROYG authorities after they arrested him as part of a 
joint investigation.  He is currently in \"security\" (note: 
presumably the Political Security Organization (PSO).  End 
Note) custody.  The third group that advised on religious 
matters was led by a Syrian named Amr Majid al-Abiyad.  Alimi 
said the KSA told the ROYG that they have arrested him and 
that he \"admitted to transfering money to the cell to conduct 
terrorist acts.\" 
 
5. (C) Dr. Alimi said that MOI believes it has been able to 
arrest all members of the cell present in Yemen in 
cooperation with Saudi Arabia, although he remains worried 
about the \"re-birth of other cells.\"  He also mentioned that 
the last five members of the cell arrested in Yemen are still 
under investigation.  This last group was arrested with 
documents proving that money had been transferred from Saudi 
Arabia.  The name found on the official money transfer 
documents (Ahmed Saad al-Ghamdi) was provided to KSA 
authorities for follow-up, and Alimi noted that unless 
al-Ghamdi used false identification, he was confident the 
name was correct and accurate. 
 
6. (C) When asked about the total number arrested in Yemen 
and Saudi Arabia, Alimi said that 17 persons were arrested in 
Yemen.  In Saudi Arabia, he mentioned Basoura and al-Abiyad 
by name and said that the ROYG had provided \"code names\" to 
the Saudi authorities and had been informed that the Saudis 
had made the arrests.  Dr. Alimi again characterized the 
Yemen-Saudi cooperation as \"excellent.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
FM Qirbi -- MOI Successful, 
More Assistance Requested, and Media Leaks Damaging 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7. (C) Foreign Minister Qirbi noted the Ministry of Interior 
has done a \"very good job\" in the last year and requested 
increased support so MOI \"could do even better.\"  He also 
cautioned about leaks to the media, saying that they have 
created a lot of anxiety that damaged the ROYG\'s move towards 
a more normal security situation.  He specifically mentioned 
travel advisories and their negative impact on tourism, and 
said he did not want the price of transparency to be inflated 
security concerns that continue to damage Yemen\'s economy. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (S/NF) Begin Comment:  The briefing was clearly aimed to 
provide assurances of safety.  While the success of the 
continued investigation is impressive, Post will maintain its 
current vigilant security practices.  Post does not deem that 
the new information requires a warden message.  The evidence 
of a productive and cooperative Yemen-Saudi investigation is 
good news for regional security and efforts in other 
counter-terrorism areas such as combatting weapons smuggling. 
 While the MOI repeated that they had \"no objection\" to 
sharing documents and evidence through \"coordinating 
agencies\" (Note: presumably the ORCA and PSO) and offered to 
inform \"security\" to share information, ORCA reports that 
they have only received a brief PSO investigative report and 
no access to any raw evidence.  There is an apparent 
disconnect between the MOI and PSO on willingness to share 
information.  End Comment.

1. (c) Summary/Comment:  During his mid-September 2003 visit 
to Yemen, Dr. John Tambi, from United Nation\'s Panel of 
Experts on Somalia (UNPES) stated that UNPES was looking into 
the possible use of Yemeni airports to smuggle weapons from 
Yemen to Somalia.  Given the prevalence of arms dealing 
in-country, Post believes that information provided by Tambi 
is plausible, but has not independently verified the 
information.  End Summary/Comment. 
 
2. (c) Dr. John Tambi, a member of the UNPES, told 
Pol/econoff during a September 14 meeting that UNPES is 
investigating possible arms smuggling from Yemen to Somalia. 
Tambi is the civil aviation expert on the panel, other UNPES 
members include boats and arms experts.  Tambi visited Yemen 
to look into air traffic that may be currently used to 
smuggle arms from Yemen to Somalia. 
 
3. (c) UNPES is investigating the possible involvement of 
United Arab Emirates-based flights in smuggling arms to 
Somalia during re-fueling stops at Riyan airport in the 
southern region of Mukallah.  Note:  Tambi actually was not 
certain of the name of the airport, but provided and old 
airport code that post was able to identify as Riyan.  End 
note.  Tambi explained that the re-fueling stops in Yemen 
seem unnecessary and last longer than the usual time needed 
for re-fueling, leading UNPES to speculate that such flights 
may be being loaded with weapons in Riyan.  The final 
destination of these flights are airports in Somalia 
allegedly controlled by warlords.  After unloading their 
cargo in Somalia, Tambi said the flights return a small 
airport in Sharja, UAE,  without making a re-fueling stop in 
Yemen. 
 
4. (c) Tambi\'s meetings  to  discuss UNPES concerns that 
Yemeni weapons are being smuggled to war-torn Somalia 
included ROYG officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and the Ministry of Defense.  According to Tambi, all the 
ROYG officials he met rejected the notion that Yemeni 
airports were used in any smuggling activities into Somalia. 
UNPES plans to continue its investigation and will present 
any findings to the ROYG.  Tambi requested that Embassy 
Sana\'a provide UNPES with any information related to their 
ongoing investigation.

PROSPECTS FOR YEMENI REFORM 
 
1.  (U) Ambassador accompanied by Pol/Econ Deputy 
(notetaker) called on Minister of Justice Adnan al-Jafri to 
discuss the September Arab Judicial Forum conference and 
progress in reforming the Yemeni justice system on November 
5.  After detailing serious problems with the rule of law in 
Yemen, the Minister urged the Ambassador to seek U.S. 
assistance to reform the judiciary.  Al-Jafri said, \"an 
efficient and strong judiciary is essential to creating 
stability in Yemen and in the region.\"  The Ambassador 
agreed to explore ways in which to assist, particularly in 
the area of commercial law reform.  End Summary. 
 
ARAB JUDICIAL FORUM - GREAT SUCCESS 
 
2.  (U) The Minister expressed great appreciation for the 
MEPI-supported Arab Judicial Forum that was held in Bahrain 
in September.  He said he wanted to bring together the 
Yemeni participants to discuss lessons learned and how to 
apply them in Yemen.  Al-Jafri praised the participation of 
Justice Sandra Day O\'Connor and noted the following areas as 
being particularly useful as the Ministry draws up its 
strategic plan for reform: 
 
-- Improving the selection and training of judges, including 
their morals and ethics as well as their rights and 
obligations; 
 
-- Ensuring the independence of the judiciary; 
 
-- Exploring the role of civil society organizations in 
improving the rule of law; 
 
-- Strengthening human rights provisions in the judiciary 
and in legislation; 
 
-- Applying legislation super-nationally in areas such as 
corruption, transparency and money laundering; 
 
-- Codifying Shari\'a law. 
 
WIDESPREAD PROBLEMS WITH YEMENI JUSTICE SECTOR 
 
3.  (U) The Justice Minister said he was developing 
ambitious plans for re-structuring and reforming the 
judiciary.  He invited U.S. representatives to a December 14 
conference in Sanaa that will bring together the results of 
public discussions held in the governorates over the past 5 
months in order to develop a written strategic plan for 
reform.  The Minister outlined numerous problems facing 
justice reform efforts.  Generally, he noted the lack of 
access by the less powerful, such as women and the poor, and 
the complicated procedures that prolong the path to justice. 
He also said the lack of women judges exacerbated women\'s 
ability to seek justice and that the political will to 
appoint more women judges was an obstacle rather than the 
law itself.  He described the problem of traditional tribal 
justice and the intervention of powerful sheikhs in 
resolving disputes.  He said corruption was an endemic 
problem, with 13 judges dismissed in 2003, as well as 
antiquated administrative procedures that limit judges\' 
ability to apply the law properly. 
 
4.  (U) Specifically, the Minister highlighted commercial 
law reform as a vital area for improvement. The investment 
climate cannot improve until the commercial courts play 
their role robustly in fair judgments and implementation. In 
addition to investment problems, al-Jafri noted land 
disputes, maritime law and money exchange as other areas for 
improvement. 
 
COMMENT:  POSSIBILITIES FOR U.S. ASSISTANCE 
 
5.  (U) With areas and prospects for reform so diverse at 
this time and ROYG reform efforts still underdeveloped, Post 
will continue to explore ways to follow-up on the Bahrain 
conference directly.  However, Post believes that the area 
of commercial law reform provides an area for reform that 
can be assisted immediately.  Post will seek MEPI or other 
appropriate funds to develop a program to improve the 
commercial law system, including training judges and lawyers 
in commercial law, deconflicting old laws remaining on the 
books since unification and improving enforcement of 
commercial rulings. End Comment.

1.  (S/NF) Summary:  On 5 November 2003, FBI Director 
Mueller, accompanied by Ambassador,  met with ROYG President 
Saleh in Sanaa.  The Director pressed Saleh on the urgent 
need to arrest al-Qa\'ida members at large in Yemen; expressed 
concerns over the ROYG\'s release of arrestees who may be 
associated with terrorism; and cautioned Saleh of the 
apparent financing and recruitment of Yemenis to go and fight 
against coalition forces in Iraq.  Saleh told the Director 
that ROYG security forces were committed to the Global War On 
Terrorism and were doing everything possible to be good 
partners with America.  Saleh further complained that the USG 
was putting undue pressure on him without providing the 
necessary tools (financing and technical support) to 
accomplish the mission.  The Director was firm in his 
insistence that Yemen\'s CT performance must improve, 
particularly in regards to the sharing of intelligence.  End

pursuing and arresting al-Qa,ida members at large in Yemen; 
that there were serious concerns in Washington surrounding 
the reported impending release of detained radicals who had 
supposedly promised not to conduct operations in or against 
Yemen; and that the USG had information indicating an effort 
by some elements in Yemen to recruit or conduct fund-raising 
for Yemenis to travel to Iraq to conduct terrorist operations 
against coalition forces.  The Director said that he was 
concerned and desired increased cooperation to jointly 
develop intelligence on terrorists located in Yemen and 
elsewhere. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  The Director told Saleh that he saw many 
similarities in the current conditions of USG-ROYG CT 
cooperation and conditions between the USG and Saudi Arabia 
prior to the 12 May 2003 terrorist attacks in the Kingdom. 
He went on to describe the significant improvement in 
cooperation (for example, the capture of Swift Sword) that 
followed the attacks and stated that he wanted to see that 
same level of cooperation and partnership in Yemen. 
 
5.  (C)  President Saleh responded that he and his government 
shared common concerns in the CT arena with the USG, but that 
it was placing pressure on the ROYG without providing 
necessary financial and technical support.  He stated that 
the ROYG was fully committed to the GWOT, but that the ROYG 
would not take orders from the USG.  Saleh said that the ROYG 
was not afraid of the USG like other countries in the region 
were, and would not be &intimidated into8 participating as 
a partner in the GWOT.  Saleh criticized the anti-Yemen 
position held in Washington, and said that those 
decision-makers were relying on false information delivered 
by the Embassy and various agencies. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  President Saleh said that the Embassy was relying 
on weak intelligence and that this would harm the joint 
relationship.  As an example, Saleh cited the reported 
release of Hadi Dulqam.  Saleh said that there was no truth 
to this and that the Director needed to trust him and his 
security apparatus in this matter. In this way, by the 
Director trusting what Saleh (or one of his representatives) 
directly said and not what the Embassy said, the relationship 
could improve.  Saleh said that he wanted to be a partner 
like Pakistan or Egypt, with commensurate support and trust. 
The Director countered that such trust only comes with time 
and positive experience. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
THE RELEASE ISSUE 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7.  (C)  Saleh said that the Ramadan 2003 release of 
detainees was a very contentious issue and that no conclusion 
had yet been reached regarding its implementation due to 
lingering security concerns.  Saleh said that the number of 
candidates for release had been pared down from an initial 
152 last month to the current figure of 92, and that the 
number would likely further be reduced.  Saleh said that of 
the group of 34 who were released during Ramadan in 2002, 
some had returned to the Hitat Camp and were re-arrested -- 
but he added that all releasees were subject to continual 
surveillance by ROYG security forces to ensure they did not 
carry out any further attacks. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
KHALID ABDUL NABI 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (S/NF)  Saleh said that during June 2003, while he was in 
Germany, Khalid Abdul Nabi was involved in an attack on a 
Yemeni medical team deployed in the Abyan region.  Saleh said 
that following the attack Abdul Nabi surrendered himself, and 
his 40 soldiers, to the Presidential  Diwan and that Saleh 
had personal discussions with Abdul Nabi.  Based on Abdul 
Nabi,s promise not to conduct another attack in Yemen, Saleh 
released him and told the Director that he (Saleh) could 
offer a 75% guarantee that Abdul Nabi would not conduct 
another attack. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
ABU  ASIM AL-MAKKI 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
9.  (S/NF)  The Director told Saleh that many senior 
officials in Washington are frustrated with the ROYG,s 
continuing failure to capture al-Makki.  Saleh responded 
vigorously that he was prepared to use tanks if necessary to 
destroy al-Makki.  Saleh insisted that the ROYG did not know 
al-Makki,s current location and that if the USG had any 
targeting data (even partial information) the ROYG was 
prepared to conduct operation to kill al-Makki.  Saleh said 
that circa 2 November 2003 he had dispatched an emissary to 
negotiate the surrender of al-Makki (no further information). 
 Saleh further criticized the USG by stating that it had 
failed over a period of years to capture Usama bin Laden, but 
still raised inappropriate expectations for the ROYG in its 
pursuit of al-Makki.  Saleh said he believed the last known 
location for al-Makki was in the al-Jouf region.  The 
Ambassador corrected Saleh and said the embassy had reason to 
believe he was in the Hadda District of Sanaa.  BG Qamish 
concurred with this assessment. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
HOW TO IMPROVE FBI/ROYG COOPERATION 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
10.  (C)  The Director finished the meeting by requesting 
ROYG commitment to expand existing FBI-Yemeni cooperation in 
three issues.  First, to extend the sharing of fingerprinting 
and DNA-mapping information to detainees currently in Yemeni 
custody.  Second, to allow for the participating of FBI 
specialists in the ROYG,s efforts to hunt down fugitives. 
Lastly, to expand the exchange of intelligence and to allow 
FBI officials to participate in the interrogation of 
terrorist suspects.  Saleh deferred on these issues, but 
nominally accepted FBI assistance in cases of the USS COLE 
escapees Fadl al-Quso and Jamal al-Badawi.  He added the ROYG 
security forces had arrested hundreds of suspects who 
remained in Yemeni jails, but that many of these individuals 
were merely suspects and had not committed a crime. 
Accordingly, Embassy requests for personal data on them (and 
grouping them in with proven criminals/terrorists) were 
inappropriate and there would be no sharing of such data 
because merely planning to commit a crime was no the same 
thing as actually committing it.

MOI/PSO DIRECTORS 
 
 
Classified By: CTC AUSTIN G. GILREATH, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  On 8 November 2003, the Ambassador was 
called to a meeting with Minister of the Interior, Dr. Rashad 
al-Alimi, and the Director of the Political Security 
Organization, BG Ghalib al-Qamish, to discuss current levels 
of cooperation on the counter-terrorism front.  The 
Ambassador presented a number of requests for further 
information on threats to American targets and details of 
Al-Qa,ida presence in Sana,a, and reaffirmed the need for 
the ROYG to commit fully in word and deed to the Global War 
On Terrorism.  Alimi and Qamish confirmed Yemen,s interest 
in cooperating with America.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
THE AL-SHARIF CELL 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (C)  The Ambassador told attendees that based on 
information given to him by MOI Alimi on the 28 October, he 
understood that the Amr al-Sharif al-Qa,ida cell arrested in 
September 2003 had attempted to conduct two attacks on the 
Ambassador,s motorcade.  The Ambassador requested additional 
information, to include weapons, locations and timings of the 
aborted attacks.  The Ambassador also asked for additional 
threat targeting information, developed from cell member 
interrogations, on western restaurants, institutes, USG 
residences and the Hadda Compound.  The Ambassador told the 
attendees that because the cell members were currently in 
jail, and the arrest team had discovered a wealth of 
information (computer disks, written targeting packets, and 
casing videotape), these requests were not unreasonable. 
 
3.  (C)  After some initial confusion regarding the existence 
or non-existence of a videotape containing casing information 
of the British Embassy, Dr. Alimi finally produced the 
original and promised that copies would be made and delivered 
to the embassy and the British Ambassador.  (Comment:  It 
appears PSO, the designated conduit for materials, was not 
provided with a key piece of material.  End comment) 
 
4.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador said that it was his understanding 
that seventeen individuals had been arrested in connection to 
the cell.  The Ambassador asked why their names had not been 
provided to the Embassy yet.  Qamish told the Ambassador that 
he had indeed provided those names to his liaison Pol/Mil 
contact at the Embassy.  After the meeting, the Pol/Mil 
Section Head confirmed to the Ambassador that he has not 
received any of these names, but that he would check with PSO 
liaison to see if such material was in the pipeline. 
Subsequently, the names were turned over in memo format on 9 
November. 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
THE IRANIAN DEPORTEES 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Referring to a recent Yemeni press article 
detailing the extradition by Iran to Yemen of thirteen Yemeni 
al-Qa,ida terrorists, the Ambassador pointedly asked 
attendees why the Embassy, and officials in Washington, had 
to receive such information late from open sources and not 
early from our committed CT partners in the ROYG.  Qamish 
responded that this was in fact old news and that the 
transfer had taken place in January 2003.  He continued by 
saying that these individuals had targeted objectives outside 
of Yemen, did not present a threat to the Embassy, and that 
it was a Yemeni-Iranian matter.  The Ambassador asked if 
Embassy interlocutors had been made aware of the transfer 
during the time of its execution, and attendees responded 
that while Washington knew of the transfer, the names had not 
been conveyed at the Iranians\' request.  Qamish said he would 
provide these names in official channels since Iran has now 
leaked them. 
 
----------------------------------- 
ESCAPED FUGITIVES 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) The Ambassador queried the current status of ROYG 
efforts to capture Ahmed al-Quso and Jamal Muhamad Ahmad Ali 
al-Badawi.  Attendees confirmed that the two individuals were 
in Yemen, but that they did not have specific locational data 
on the fugitives.  Attendees confirmed that two of the ten 
March 2003 Aden prison escapees had been recaptured.  Qamish 
again reiterated that if the Embassy had any information on 
the current location of Abu Asim al-Makki, this information 
should be turned over to the PSO. 
7. (C)  Comment:  A joint Alimi/Qamish meeting is rare, and 
this one was at the Yemenis request.  It was obviously an 
effort by the Yemenis to respond to concerns raised by FBI 
Director Mueller and the Ambassador. (Septel)  The episode of 
the missing UK Embassy videotape indicates the lack of 
coordination between Yemeni agencies.  In Ambassador,s 
judgment, it illustrates dramatically why we need to develop 
close and constant contact with the MOI.  Embassy,s DCM will 
take the lead in this regard. End comment.

1. (S) Begin Summary:  The Charge convened an EAC meeting on 
November 15 to consider the impending extradition of Sheikh 
al-Moayad from Germany to the United States.  While the 
Embassy has seen no evidence of anti-US demonstrations or 
political activity in anticipation of the transfer, the EAC 
decided to issue a warden message providing background on the 
issue and advising increased personal vigilience on or about 
November 16 (i.e., after Moayed actually departs Germany 
enroute to the United States).  Key offices and personnel 
represented at the meeting included:  POL/ECON, CONS, RSO, 
MO, FPD, POL/MIL, DAO, OMC, and SOC YEMEN.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The Charge opened the meeting with an update on recent 
developments in the case of Sheikh al-Moayed in Germay, 
concluding that extradition was expected to be conducted on 
16 November.  The Charge cautioned that the Sheikh had many 
friends in Yemen who believe him to be an apolitical figure 
unjustly accused and duped by the US and Germany.  The Charge 
assessed that the delay resultant from protracted legal 
appeals in the case has probably worked to our advantage by 
allowing time for Yemeni public interest in the case to wane. 
 The RSO briefed that he has been in contact with his 
Ministry of Interior (MOI) interlocutors and that they 
reported an absence of any extradition-related political 
activity in the streets or the mosques. 
 
3. (C) POL/ECON briefed the EAC on her recent conversation 
with the German DCM regarding security issues related to the 
extradition.  Although it has no indications of impending 
trouble, the German Embassy in Sanaa has issued a travel 
warning and restricted the movement of embassy personnel as a 
safety precaution.  MOI has deployed extra security personnel 
at the German Embassy, employee residences and selected 
German civilian residences.  As of November 15, 2003, the 
German air carrier Lufthansa has suspended its flights into 
Sanaa International Airport.  This suspension of service was 
expected to last no less than one week.

4. (C) The EAC decided to issue a warden message in the near 
term (after Moayed actually leaves Germany enroute for the 
U.S.) to brief the facts of the case, point out that the 
Shaykh will be tried in a regular court and not a military 
tribunal, and advise increased personal vigilience.  Upcoming 
social events are to proceed as scheduled with necessary 
security measures in place for each.  The Public Diplomacy 
section is sponsoring an Iftar dinner on 19 November, but the 
EAC will monitor and evaluate the security situation and opt 
to cancel the dinner if warranted.

NATIOANL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY (NED).

1.   SUMMARY: U.S. President George W. Bush\'s remarks at the 
National Endowment for Democracy (NED) on November 6th have 
been mentioned in government, opposition and independent 
papers.  The opposition and independent papers, some of 
which are anti-American, published excerpts of the speech. 
Most papers carried commentary focusing primarily on \"the US 
bias to Israel\" which many papers believe is responsible for 
a growing anti-U.S. sentiment in the region.  Yemeni 
organizers of an international human rights/democracy 
conference set for January 4 (to be funded and jointly 
sponsored by the E.U.) are citing the speech as an important 
boost for their efforts (see reftel).END SUMMARY. 
 
2. Under the title \"U.S. President calls for political 
reforms in the region and lauds the multi party system in 
Yemen,\" Al-Thawra official daily (11/07) published a front- 
page report covering Bush\'s remarks on democracy for the 
Middle East. 
 
 
3. \"Al-Thawra\" of 11/08 cited reactions to the speech in 
Jordan, Egypt and Iran all indicating that the main reason 
for the growing anti-US sentiments in the Arab region is 
\"the total U.S. bias toward Israel.\" 
 
4. \"Al-Thawra\" published on November 11 an op-ed article 
indicating that Bush\'s remarks were not very much welcomed 
by the Arabs \"and were received by suspicion especially with 
regard to his remarks on freedom and democracy in the Arab 
world.\"  The paper added that the US credibility will be 
assessed based on its policies toward Israel.  \"All the 
Arabs bear no hatred toward the American people but toward 
the US political bias to Israel which made all Arabs and 
Muslims very suspicious of the U.S. policies in the region.\" 
Al-Thawra added that: \"If the U.S. wants its policies to 
gain acceptance and support in the Arab world it has to take 
one single step which is to force Israel to withdraw from 
occupied Palestine and to comply with Security Council 
resolutions and peace accords.\"  \"Only then\" Al-Thawra added 
\"Arabs will give a round of applause to President Bush\'s 
speech\" al-Thawra concluded. 
 
5. \"Al-Shura\", weekly of the Popular Forces Union, (November 
9)published an op-ed titled \"Bush markets democracy to the 
region\" commenting specifically on Bush\'s remarks regarding 
the multi party system in Yemen.  Al-Shura indicated that 
\"the US\'s growing interest in Yemen in the context of 
democracy confirms that the U.S. wants to use Yemen as a 
regional center to implement its strategy that failed in 
Iraq.\" 
 
6. \"Annas\" independent weekly (11/10) published an op-ed 
article saying that Bush has revealed in his speech \"the 
US\'s bad intentions toward Syria and Iran.\"  The article 
indicated that \"the proposed U.S. democratic reforms for the 
region cannot yet be implemented in countries that still 
hold political prisoners, unfair elections and high poverty 
rates.\"  The article rejected Bush\'s remarks \"since the 
White House is as much corrupt as the Arab Regimes are.\" 
 
7. Without commenting on the content, \"Al-Sahwa\" weekly 
(11/13, mouthpiece of the Yemeni Congregation for Reform - 
Islah) published a major part of the speech. 
 
8. \"Ra\'ay\" weekly (mouthpiece of the Rabita party) published 
excerpts of the speech highlighting Bush\'s remarks on 
democracy for the Middle East as stated in the speech such 
as: \"the United States has adopted a new policy: a forward 
strategy of freedom in the Middle East that requires the 
same persistence and energy and idealism we have shown 
before ... and it will yield the same results.\"  The paper 
criticized the speech for ignoring \"the Israeli practices 
against the Palestinians.\"

1. (S) Begin Summary:  Charge convened an EAC meeting on 18 
November to consider further the repercussions of the 17 
November 2003 extradition of Sheikh al-Moayad from Germany to 
the United States, and any appropriate embassy response.  The 
Embassy has not seen, nor is there visible cause to expect 
widespread demonstrations or anti-US political activity as a 
result of the extradition.  The embassy will maintain close 
liaison with Yemeni security bodies, continue to monitor the 
situation with close attention, and adjust its actions when 
and if warranted.  Key offices and personnel represented at

DAO, OMC, and SOC YEMEN.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The Charge opened by briefing the EAC on an 18 
November morning meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Qirbi to discuss the al-Moayad case.  Qirbi\'s approach was 
low-key. (septel) 
 
3. (C)  The A/RSO briefed that his office had no indications 
of a threat or planned demonstration.  There is no 
information, including from MOI, to elaborate on FM Qirbi\'s 
mention to Charge of a pro-Moayad \"demonstration\" at the 
Presidential Palace on 11/17.  PD said that the issue had 
lingered too long in the courts and that the timing of the 
release during Ramadan had apparently served to dampen any 
anti-US energies.  In his survey of press coverage, the DAO 
said reporting of the release was largely factual and not 
inflammatory; in fact, one newspaper even presented some of 
the USG\'s evidence against al-Moayad in its reporting. 
POL/ECON Chief briefed the EAC on her 18 November meeting 
with the German DCM, who said that as of 18 November the 
embassy was re-opened without any incidents to report.

1. (C) On November 18, FM Qirbi called in Charge to discuss 
the 11/16 Moayed extradition and several other subjects 
(septels).  Pol/Econ Deputy (notetaker) also joined. 
 
2. (C) Qirbi was low-key, stating that the ROYG wished to 
protect Moayed\'s rights as a Yemeni citizen.  He expressed 
the hope that Moayed would receive decent treatment in prison 
(\"better than he received in Germany\"), and said the ROYG 
would hope to receive \"the full file on the accusations and 
evidence\" now that Moayed is in U.S. custody.  Qirbi noted 
that the Moayed case could be included in upcoming dialogue 
to address mutual concerns in CT cooperation (septel). 
 
3. (C) The Charge observed that public reaction to Moayed,s 
extradition had so far been muted.  Qirbi agreed, but 
mentioned a \"demonstration\" by tribesmen related to Moayed in 
front of the Presidential Palace on November 17.  The Charge 
thanked Qirbi for the ROYG\'s provision of security 
cooperation with the Embassy in conjunction with the Moayed 
extradition. 
 
4. (C) Comment: Recent media reports, including an 11/17 
al-Jazeera TV interview, have included more activist 
statements by Qirbi -- e.g. the ROYG will pay for Moayed,s 
legal defense -- but his approach to Charge was mild and 
understated.  Friday prayers on 11/21 could see some protest 
(e.g. in Moayed,s home district in Sanaa), but public 
reaction to the extradition has been virtually invisible to 
date.  The Embassy,s EAC (septel) accordingly decided not to 
institute new restrictions for the 11/20-21 weekend.

Yemen,s 11/17 announcement of detainee releases and other 
subjects (septels).  Charge voiced U.S. concern over the ROYG 
decision to disregard repeated U.S. requests for consultation 
prior to any releases.  Qirbi called for dialogue, 
particularly with Interior Minister Alimi and PSO Chief 
Gamish, to address each side,s concerns over CT cooperation. 
 Qirbi stated that 54 &repentant8 detainees were to be

Qirbi: Need to Increase Dialogue on CT Issues

3. (C) Qirbi began by acknowledging concerns about CT 
cooperation aired by both sides in recent U.S.-Yemeni 
meetings ) including FBI Director Mueller,s meeting with 
President Saleh and follow-on meetings between AMB Hull and 
senior Yemeni officials.  Chief among ROYG complaints was a 
perceived U.S. tendency to accept erroneous intel on Yemeni 
CT actions without taking time to check the story with Yemeni 
authorities.  His proposed solution: \"We have to initiate a 
process of dialogue on CT cooperation\" to \"get to the crux of 
the matter\" and address \"difficulties faced by both sides.\" 
He cited Minister of Interior Alimi and Political Security 
Organization (PSO) Chief Gamish as key figures with which the 
U.S. side must maintain ongoing dialogue. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Case in Point: Detainee Releases 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Charge agreed that CT cooperation needed to be put 
right, as there is no more important aspect of the current 
bilateral relationship.  He pointed out that Yemen,s 11/17 
announcement that 92 &repentant\" security detainees were 
slated for release had raised serious U.S. concerns due to 
the lack of advance consultation by the ROYG.  Repeated U.S. 
requests for such consultation during the Mueller visit and 
in Ambassador,s subsequent meetings with Alimi and Gamish 
had not been taken into account, he said.  Charge underscored 
the need for Yemen to address U.S. concerns by sharing names 
and information on those slated for release. 
 
5. (C) Qirbi reviewed recent U.S.-ROYG CT exchanges, and 
appeared surprised that just the sort of dialogue he was now 
recommending had occurred, but had not prevented a serious 
disconnect on the release of detainees issue.  Qirbi noted 
that 54 persons were to be released, and that official 
statements referring to 92 were incorrect.  He said none had 
yet been freed. 
 
6. (C) Returning to his dialogue theme, Qirbi observed that 
the points raised at a recent meeting between Yemen,s 
Ambassador in Washington and Deputy National Security Advisor 
for Combating Terrorism Townsend were a virtual \"repeat\" of 
the points Mueller raised with Saleh (ref a).  He said the 
\"stage is therefore set\" for serious discussions and that \"we 
cannot wait for incidents\" to happen before increasing 
dialogue on CT matters.

Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Comment: Qirbi,s citation of a new number ) 54 vice 
92 ) illustrates the obscurity surrounding virtually every 
aspect of the detainee release issue.  The Sanaa rumor mill 
is rife with conflicting accounts of numbers and criteria for 
release.  While &no blood on the hands8 is frequently heard 
as a key consideration, this could mean simply \"no terrorist 
actions committed in/in Yemen.\"  Some Arab diplomats are even 
convinced that the entire issue is a smokescreen to deter 
terrorism in Yemen and/or constrain restive tribes, and that 
no/no detainees will actually be released.  Through the MOI 
and other channels, post will continue to seek clarification. 
 Qirbi,s call notwithstanding, post believes that channels 
of dialogue are adequate and active, but we are not hearing 
enough from the Yemeni side.

1. (C) Summary: Charge called on Interior Minister Alimi 
11/19 to express concern over Yemen\'s reported release of 92 
security detainees (refs).  Alimi said that U.S. concerns had 
not been ignored, because no/no detainees had yet been 
released.  None slated for release had committed acts of 
violence inside or outside Yemen.  Each of the 92 must 
provide sworn, written assurances of good conduct, and 
parallel guarantees from family members, before release can 
occur.  PSO Chief Gamish will decide when the required 
standard of assurances has been met.  Alimi said Embassy 
Sanaa will &immediately8 receive name and biodata on any 
detainee actually released, and agreed to discuss with Gamish 
possible sharing of such data prior to release.  He offered 
no estimate of when releases might occur, but indicated none 
was imminent.  On numbers, Alimi confirmed that 54 of the 
&candidates8 for release are from the Hattat/Abyan 
engagement, and 38 are detained on suspicion of affiliation 
with al-Qaeda or other extremist groups.  Alimi, the ROYG,s 
polished &good cop,8 was at pains to put an upbeat spin on 
the announced release of detainees, but important questions 
remain unanswered.  Local reaction to the Moayed extradition 
(minimal) and pending prosecution of Cole suspects (timetable 
uncertain) were also discussed.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On 11/19 Charge, joined by Acting LEGATT and Pol/Econ 
Deputy, called on Interior Minister Dr. Rashad al-Alimi to 
press U.S. concerns over the ROYG,s 11/17 announcement that 
92 security detainees had been released (ref xx).  Charge 
reminded Alimi that the USG had repeatedly requested 
consultation prior to any detainee release (refs b and c), 
including in FBI Director Mueller,s 11/5 meeting with 
President Saleh, and Yemen,s failure to consult prior to 
announcing releases had caused disappointment and concern in 
Washington. 
 
3. (C) Alimi said he was briefed on Charge,s meeting with FM 
Qirbi the previous day, and welcomed the chance to &correct 
misperceptions8 caused by ROYG media releases.  He said 
Saleh and Yemen,s security services took seriously their 
responsibility for security in Yemen, and also recognized 
that the USG shared in responsibility for security and CT 
efforts regionally and globally.  Thus, he said, there must 
be complete coordination and transparency between the two 
sides. 
 
DETAINEES MUST MEET CONDITIONS FOR RELEASE; NONE INVOLVED IN 
VIOLENCE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE YEMEN WILL BE RELEASED 
 
4. (C) Alimi stressed repeatedly that no/no detainees have 
yet been released, so U.S. concerns have not been ignored. 
Rather than an instant mass release, the ROYG had initiated a 
process whereby each of 92 detainess could win release by 
meeting conditions set by Saleh.  Those who failed to do so 
would remain in jail.  None of the detainees slated for 
release had committed acts of violence inside or outside 
Yemen.  &This is a red line we will not cross,8 said Alimi. 
 He emphasized that any detainee who had committed a violent 
act would be referred to the Attorney General for prosecution. 
 
NUMBERS 
 
5. (C) In response to questioning by Charge and Acting 
LEGATT, Alimi summarized the breakdown of numbers as follows. 
 Under Yemen,s dialogue program, teams of religious scholars 
(ulema) engaged 150 detainees over the past year.  PSO Chief 
Gamish had eliminated 58 of those from consideration from 
release.  Of the remaining 92 ) all now candidates for 
release ) 54 had surrendered themselves with Khalid Abdul 
Nabi following the Hattat/Abyan engagement.  Alimi described 
these as non-ideological men in need of jobs, and noted that 
Abdul Nabi himself \"was never arrested.\"  The other 38 were 
arrested in various places on suspicion of al-Qaeda 
membership or other extremist affiliation. 
 
PROCESS 
 
6. (C) The Minister explained that the announcement of 
detainees slated for release began a process whereby each 
individual must to provide written, sworn assurance (a) that 
he will follow the law and avoid extremist contacts, (b) that 
he will not attempt to travel outside Yemen without ROYG 
permission, and (c) that he will report to police when/if 
called.  Each detainee must also obtain parallel 
guarantees/assurances from family, friends, tribe and 
business/social associates, who must all: (a) attest to their 
own belief that the detainee has reformed, (b) agree to 
inform the police should he misbehave, and (c) tell police 
where he is when/if asked. 
 
7. (C) Political Security Organization Chief Ghaleb al-Gamish 
will assess when the required standard of assurances is met, 
and any detainee fails to meet that standard will remain in 
jail.  Alimi noted that the release process was based on 
positive experience from the release of a smaller number of 
detainees during Ramadan 2002, including creation of a 
network of informers who had exposed terrorist sleeper cells. 
 Moreover, the requirement of assurances from family members 
and other associates turned Yemen,s tight-knit tribal/family 
structure to the advantage of the security services ) 
particularly because relatives would be reluctant to offer 
assurances unless sincerely convinced the detainee will keep 
his promises.  The 11/17 public announcement of releases was 
calculated, in part, to spur detainees and their relatives to 
provide the assurances. 
 
8. (C) Once a detainee obtains the necessary assurances, and 
is approved for release, the PSO will inform the Ministry of 
Interior, which places him on the ROYG,s security 
&blacklist8 as a person forbidden to travel out of Yemen. 
When asked, Alimi said that the \"blacklist\" entails the entry 
of each name into the Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP) 
system. 
 
9. (C) Alimi repeatedly declined to offer any timeline for 
when actual releases might begin.  While noting that the 
process of obtaining assurances could take as little as a few 
days if a detainee,s family were committed to supporting 
him, Alimi insisted that the &comprehensive\" and 
\"time-consuming\" nature of the process would mean that no 
release is imminent. 
 
USG WILL RECEIVE NAMES OF ALL RELEASED DETAINEES 
 
10. (C) Dr. Alimi said that the PSO would &immediately8 
provide to Embassy Sanaa the name and full biodata of any 
detainee released.  Acting LEGATT said names should be 
provided now, before release.  Failing that, the explanations 
provided by Alimi were inconsistent with the 11/5 
Mueller-Saleh conversation and insufficient to address U.S. 
concerns.  Moreover, U.S. authorities should not have first 
learned of ROYG detainee release plans via press reports. 
Alimi said he understood the misunderstanding stemmed from 
press reports that said detainees were already released when 
they were not.  He offered to discuss the matter further with 
PSO Chief Gamish to explore whether names could be provided 
prior to actual release. 
 
11. (C) When asked about obtaining the names of detainees 
released during Ramadan last year, Alimi expressed surprise 
that the PSO had not provided them.  Charge confirmed that 
the Embassy had not received them.  Alimi said he would 
discuss this meeting with PSO Chief Gamish in \"complete 
detail\" and also raise the question of last year,s detainee 
releases.  Above all, concluded Alimi, the United States and 
Yemen need not worry about detainee releases, and should 
focus on apprehending terrorists who remained at large ) 
particularly Abu Asim al-Makki, Jamal al-Badawi and Fadl 
al-Quso ) because they are the ones who can pose an active 
threat. 
 
USS COLE SUSPECTS TO TRIAL SOON? 
 
12. (C) Charge asked about press reports that more than 60 
detainees, including suspects in the USS Cole case, would 
move to trial in December.  Alimi was uncertain.  He said he 
would like to see prosecution move quickly, but expressed 
concern that the Moayed extradition and instability in Iraq 
could negatively affect public reaction.  He noted that 
escaped Cole suspects Jamal al-Badawi and Fadl al-Quso could 
potentially be tried in absentia.  (Note: Post will pursue 
the question with the Attorney General,s office.) 
 
MOAYED REACTION CALM; ROYG REMAINS VIGILANT 
 
13. (C) Charge thanked Alimi for heightened security 
preparations in conjunction with the extradition of Sheikh 
Mohamed al-Moayed from Germany to the United States, and 
observed that public reaction had been muted.  The Minister 
agreed, noting that the MOI had no indication of 
demonstrations or disturbances planned for the impending 
weekend.  The ROYG is nonetheless taking precautionary 
security measures, said Alimi, and will pay close attention 
to Friday mosque sermons that could inflame reaction.  He 
added that the ROYG was making \"widespread efforts,\" 
including media outreach, to keep the situation calm and 
avert repercussions.  He noted that Yemen,s Embassy in 
Washington is working with Moayed,s family and supporters to 
arrange his defense, concluding that the ROYG will now depend 
on the \"justice and fairness\" of the American judicial system. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
14. (C) Alimi, the ROYG,s polished &good cop,8 was calm 
and conciliatory throughout the meeting.  He was aware of 
U.S. concerns (from Charge,s meeting with FM Qirbi the 
previous day), and was at pains to deemphasize the issue and 
emphasize Yemen,s intention to provide notification when a 
release does occur.  Unfortunately he could provide no idea 
of when that might be, nor any promise that biodata will be 
provided prior/prior to any release.  This may be in part 
because the process resides with the PSO rather than the MOI, 
but we will continue working all channels with the ROYG to 
seek further answers.

1. (C) Summary/Comment: In an 11/18 meeting with Charge, FM 
Qirbi delivered a verbal invitation for &high-level8 USG 
participation in an international conference to take place in 
Yemen 10-12 January 2004.  Shura Council Member Mohamed 
al-Tayeb, who will head ROYG preparations, provided 
background in separate meetings with Charge.  The conference 
will be jointly sponsored (and entirely paid for) by the EU, 
with its affiliated NGO, No Peace Without Justice, playing a 
central role.  Invitees will include: all OIC member states; 
all EU member states; the United States; Canada; Japan; and 
selected non-OIC African states including Chad, Ghana, 
Ethiopia, and Kenya.  Most invitations have been sent, with 
each country,s Foreign Minister, Justice Minister and heads 
of upper and lower houses of parliament invited by name. 
NGOs will constitute up to half the projected 350-400 
participants. 
 
2.  (C) Summary/Comment Continued: The ROYG is willing to 
meet U.S. conditions -- e.g. downplaying ICC and playing up 
support for Iraq, Afghanistan and the 11/5 POTUS NED speech 
-- in order to draw a senior delegation from Washington. 
Even so, EU sponsorship and hostiles (Libya, Iran) on the 
guest list will likely constrain U.S. ability to 
influence/inform conference outcomes.  It is nevertheless 
important that the USG be present to highlight U.S. policy 
and achievements in the region.  We recommend a delegation 
headed at DAS level (perhaps NEA acting DAS Romanowski) and 
including DRL and AID.  U.S. delegation should also be able 
to address criticism on ICC and GTMO.  Post would welcome 
Department guidance on (a) Yemeni request on invitation for 
Iraq (para 7) and (b) our ongoing engagement with the ROYG on 
the agenda (para 8).  End summary/comment. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
WHY A HUMAN RIGHTS CONFERENCE IN YEMEN? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) On 11/16 Shura Council member Mohamed al-Tayeb, a 
former cabinet minister and current head of the SC,s human 
rights committee, approached Charge with a preliminary 
invitation for USG participation in the &Intergovernmental 
Regional Conference on Democracy, Human Rights and the Rule 
of Law.8  The conference will take place in Sanaa January 
10-12, 2004.  The event, which will be funded and 
co-sponsored by the EU will aim to increase awareness and 
&market8 democracy in the region.  In Tayeb,s words, &We 
will act on President Bush,s recent speech on democracy in 
the region.8 
 
4.  (C) The impetus for the conference began last summer, 
when Tayeb attended two human rights conferences in Rome 
sponsored by the EU-affiliated NGO &No Peace Without 
Justice.8  NPWJ members told him of plans to host a 
conference on the ICC in Jordan late in the year.  Tayeb 
persuaded them that the ICC was not a salient enough issue 
for a stand-alone conference in the Middle East, and the 
discussion led to broadening the agenda and shifting the 
venue to Yemen (where some NPWJ had favorable experience as 
observers for Yemen,s 4/03 parliamentary elections).  While 
the ICC will not/not be a focus of the conference, Tayeb 
confirmed that the ROYG intends to complete an Article 98 
agreement with the USG as soon as possible, and then proceed 
to ratify the Rome Statute prior to the conference. 
 
--------------------- 
AGENDA AND MODALITIES 
--------------------- 
 
5. (U) Following a plenary at Sanaa,s Republican Palace 
(typically used for large, formal state occasions), the 
conference will devolve into three sub-conferences -- 
promoting the rule of law; building democracy; and promoting 
human rights - in separate venues.  Along with national 
delegations expected from dozens of countries (ministers of 
foreign affairs and justice, along with heads of upper and 
lower parliamentary bodies, will be invited by name), NGO 
members could constitute 40-50 percent of participants. 
European diplomats tell us several EU states are considering 
delegations headed at the deputy FM level, but most have not 
yet decided.  NGO invitees will include former Secretary 
Albright, in her capacity as head of the National Democratic 
Institute. 
 
6. (SBU) Tayeb will head preparations on the ground, aided by 
staffers from NPWJ who arrived 11/18.  He expects a draft 
agenda to be ready within the coming week, and has offered to 
share it with Embassy Sanaa.  Invitees will include: all OIC 
member states; all EU member states; the United States; 
Canada; Japan; and selected non-OIC African states including 
Chad, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Kenya.  Most invitations have 
already gone out, and the ROYG plans a particularly warm 
reception for the new leadership of both Iraq and 
Afghanistan. 
 
7. (SBU) Tayeb told Charge 11/19 that the Iraqi Embassy in 
Sanaa has declined to accept the invitation on the grounds 
that it lacks the ability to forward it to authorities in 
Baghdad.  Tayeb thus asked if the USG could assist in 
forwarding the invitation to FM Zebari.  Charge urged him to 
explore other options (e.g. Yemen,s embassy in Baghdad, or 
the Arab League) but agreed to forward his request to 
Washington. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
U.S. PARTICIPATION: WILLING TO MEET U.S. &CONDITIONS8 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
8. (C) During a frank exchange 11/18, Charge advised Tayeb 
that the USG would not be able to decide on its level of 
participation without having a clearer idea of the agenda. 
Beyond that, ROYG assurance on certain points could also help 
elicit a favorable view from Washington.  For example: 
 
-- ICC: Assurance that the ICC will not emerge as a major 
conference focus, that the agenda will not be slanted to 
&slam8 the U.S. position on the ICC; that all agenda items 
relating to the ICC will be clearly disclosed and defined in 
advance, and that the ICC will not/not be mentioned my name 
in the final communiqu; 
 
-- Israel/Palestine: Assurance that issues of Israeli 
occupation and Palestinian aspiration will not be allowed to 
distort the positive focus of the conference; 
 
-- Iraq and Afghanistan: Assurance that Iraq and Afghanistan 
will be held up (including in the final communiqu) as 
positive examples of democratic transition, that the agenda 
will not be shaped to criticize intervention in those 
countries; that the final communiqu will exhort participants 
and the world community to assist the peoples of Iraq and 
Afghanistan in their transition to democracy; 
 
-- Women: Assurance that women,s issues will be highlighted, 
both in the agenda and the final communiqu, and that female 
participation (e.g. through NGOs) will be maximized. 
 
-- 11/5 POTUS NED Speech: Assurance that the speech will be 
appropriately integrated into the agenda and acknowledged, 
ideally in the final communiqu, as a positive statement of 
generally held values and aims. 
 
-- GTMO detainees: In a conversation on 11/19, Charge added 
this subject to the list of those that should not receive 
undue or negative attention at the conference. 
 
9. (C) Tayeb responded favorably on all counts, including 
GTMO.  He welcomed the input, and emphasized that the rough 
and informal list above were consistent with both his views 
and those of the ROYG, and could readily be worked with Arab, 
European and other participants.  He invited further U.S. 
input, including in drafting the final communiqu, and 
offered a &guarantee8 that U.S. concerns would be met. 
Tayeb reiterated his intent to structure the conference so as 
to: (a) draw the highest possible level of U.S. 
participation; and (b) ensure an upbeat and positive outcome 
for all/all participants (&no finger pointing8).  &We have 
no disagreements on this,8 he said. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) Even with experienced staffers from &No Peace 
Without Justice,8 the ROYG faces a daunting task to organize 
a large international conference in less than two months. 
Although some invitations are already in the mail, organizers 
are just at the point of translating a broad vision into 
details -- so untold devils could still emerge. 
Nevertheless, with endorsement by Saleh and EU financing 
assured, the event is likely to proceed.  The Yemenis showed 
that they could host a large conference with the 1999 
Emerging Democracies Forum in Sanaa. 
11. (C) We take seriously Tayeb,s assurance that the agenda 
will not be slanted against U.S. interests, and we will 
remain engaged with him toward this end; but assessment of 
potential risks (e.g. undue emphasis on the ICC or GTMO), and 
benefits (e.g. opportunity to promote international support 
for Iraq and Afghanistan and highlight the 11/5 POTUS speech) 
cannot be completed until the agenda comes into clearer 
focus.  Moreover, with EU sponsorship and a long list of 
invitees -- including some critical of U.S. policy (e.g. 
Libya, Iran) -- our ability to influence/inform the outcome 
on key issues is likely to be constrained despite Tayeb,s 
best intentions.  Nevertheless, post deems it important that 
the USG be present in order to highlight U.S. aims and 
achievements in the region.  Based on what we know at this 
point, post recommends the Department consider a delegation 
headed at DAS level -- perhaps NEA acting DAS Romanowski, who 
has visited Yemen and can highlight MEPI -- and including AID 
and DRL.  U.S. delegation should also include member(s) able 
to address criticism on ICC and GTMO. 
 
12. (C) Finally, post would welcome Department guidance on 
engagement with Tayeb to ensure that U.S. priorities are 
appropriately reflected in the agenda.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON AL-MOAYAD\'S EXTRADITION FROM 
GERMANY TO THE UNITED STATES.

1.   SUMMARY: The Extradition of Mohammed Al-Hasan al-Moayad 
and his aide Mohammed Zayed from Germany to the United 
States on November 17th to face charges of conspiring to 
provide material support to the al-Qaeda and Hamas terrorist 
groups have been mentioned in government, opposition and 
independent papers.  Most papers published factual coverage 
of the extradition.  Government papers including the al- 
Thawra official daily tracked government reactions to the 
extradition and ROYG efforts showing seriousness in dealing 
with the case.  A few papers carried commentary on the case. 
A well-known anti-U.S. weekly, al-Balagh, indicated in its 
editorial that the extradition will have a negative effect 
on Yemen\'s co-operation with the U.S.  Pro-Islamist 
newspapers such as Annas independent weekly carried no 
commentary on the extradition but urged the government to 
exert all possible efforts in support of al-Moayad before 
the U.S. courts. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. Without commenting on the extradition, \"Al-Thawra\" 
(November 18) reported that President Saleh instructed the 
government to double efforts and contacts with the U.S. 
authorities in Washington and the U.S. Embassy in Sana\'a 
with regard to al-Moayad and his aide who were extradited 
from Germany to the U.S. November 17. 
 
3.  Al-Thawra (November 19) published reports tracking the 
government\'s reactions including Foreign Minister Dr. al- 
Qirbi\'s meeting with the U.S. Charge d\'Affaires Alan 
Misenheimer in which Dr. al-Qirbi renewed his request to 
send al-Moayad back home and informed the U.S. Charge that 
it has not been proven that al-Moayad and his aide were 
involved in any illegal actions.  COMMENT: News reporting 
does not reflect the full scope of the Foreign Minister\'s 
comments at the meeting. END COMMENT. 
 
4. Anti-American weekly \"Al-Balagh\" (November 18) published 
an op-ed article probing what it described as \"the secrets\" 
behind the detention of al-Moayad outside Yemen and raising 
concerns over his trial in a U.S. court.  Al-Balagh said 
that \"trying al-Moayad in Yemen would make Yemen\'s co- 
operation with the U.S. in counter-terrorism more acceptable 
to the people of Yemen.\"  The paper indicated that the 
repeated visits by FBI Director Robert Mueller to Yemen 
played a role in accelerating the extradition of al-Moayad 
to the U.S. 
 
5. \"Al-Shura\", weekly of the Popular Forces Union, (November 
16) published an op-ed article commenting on the Yemeni-U.S. 
counter-terrorism cooperation which al-Shura described as 
\"deficient\".  The paper indicated that \"in spite of Yemen\'s 
unlimited co-operation with the U.S. in the fight against 
terrorism Washington insisted on the extradition of al- 
Moayad to America and disregarded Yemen\'s request to send 
him back home.\"

4. (C) CT COOPERATION/DETAINEES: Charge briefed Qirbi on 
recent Embassy contacts with Interior Minister Alimi and PSO 
Chief Gamish, who had both provided some further 
clarification of ROYG procedures for determining which 
detainees would be released (ref b).  Charge stressed that 
unanswered questions nevertheless remain, and that it would 
be preferable for Yemen to provide such background prior to 
public announcements that releases have already taken place 
or are imminent.  Qirbi reiterated his call (ref c) for 
Embassy to pursue steady dialogue with Alimi and Gamish, 
especially the latter, to avoid disconnects in CT cooperation. 
 
5. (C) The FM offered the view, furthermore, that the ROYG,s 
recent public announcement of detainee releases ) even 
though none has yet been released ) were useful to 
demonstrate, both to family members and to critics, that the 
ROYG is constantly reviewing the issue and positive movement 
is possible.  Finally, he noted approvingly that Yemen,s 
Ambassador in Washington had been pursuing numerous contacts 
) including State, Defense, the White House, the FBI and the 
Pentagon ) to resolve any problems in counter-terrorism 
cooperation and address any U.S. misunderstanding of ROYG 
policy on releasing detainees. 
 
6. (C) MOAYED EXTRADITION: Qirbi noted that the U.S. court 
had appointed two lawyers for al-Moayad and Zayed, and said 
he understood family members wished to hire one or more 
additional attorneys.  He acknowledged that Yemen,s 
Ambassador in Washington is assisting in legal arrangements 
for the case.  Qirbi said he hoped the USG would consider 
favorably visa applications by any family members who wished 
to travel to the U.S. to visit the defendants or assist with 
the case.  Charge offered assurance that any such visa 
applications would be handled in accordance with U.S. law and 
regulations.

SUBJECT: USAID NATSIOS EXPLAINS MCA TO PRESIDENT SALEH 
 
 
Classified By: Classified by Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 
(b) and (d). 
 
1. (c) Summary: On November 3 USAID Administrator Natsios 
presented Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) criteria to 
President Saleh, and said Yemen could qualify if Yemen 
improved in the \"Governing Justly\" category.  While initially 
questioning the need for Yemen to make progress on such 
issues as good governance and corruption, Saleh agreed to 
have Post discuss potential reforms with Deputy Prime 
Minister (DPM) and Minister for Planning and International 
Cooperation (MOPIC)  Ahmed Sofan.  Previously, DPM Sofan 
outlined Yemen\'s development history and  raised the present 
challenges of economic expansion and high population growth 
to Natsios.  Natsios also met with the Minister of Health to 
hear about USAID\'s health projects and discussed potential 
programs to strengthen local councils with the Governor of 
Aden.  End summary. 
 
2. (c) USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios visited Sanaa 2-4 
November, 2003 and was accompanied by Connie Newman AA/AFR, 
Kate Almquist, Special Assistant for Policy and Joanne 
Giordano, DAA/LPA.   Post\'s Development team briefed Natsios 
on its development strategy, including activities in health, 
education, agriculture, economic development and democracy 
and governance.  After a brief tour of the Embassy, Natsios, 
Ambassador, USAID Representative (AIDRep), USAID Health 
Specialist and Pol/Econoff (notetaker) flew  to Aden to meet 
with President Saleh, Deputy Prime Minister Sofan, Governor 
of  Aden Yahia al-Shuaibi and Minister of Health Mohammed 
al-Noemi. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
President Saleh Questions MCA Criteria 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (c) After relaying greetings from President Bush and 
Secretary Powell, Natsios told Saleh that President Bush 
 
SIPDIS 
ordered the opening of the Yemen USAID mission to promote the 
bilateral relationship.  Turning to possible areas of 
increased U.S. development assistance, Natsios outlined 
President Bush\'s Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) 
initiative  Explaining that it was designed to reward a small 
number of countries (12-15), Natsios said the MCA is a new 
concept in development assistance because countries are 
judged in several categories that relate to how well a 
country is governed.  In the MCA categories of \"Investing in 
People\" and \"Economic Growth,\"  Natsios said, Yemen does 
well.  However, in the \"Governing Justly\" category, which 
mainly deals with issues surrounding corruption and 
governance, Yemen falls short.  (Note: Post believes Yemen 
meets the minimum MCA requirement only in the corruption 
indicator of the six  \"Governing Justly\" criteria.  Any 
action taken by the ROYG to further reduce corruption will 
raise Yemen,s scores in the other five categories.  End 
Note.) 
 
4. (c) Saleh questioned Natsios extensively on the sources of 
information that determine MCA qualification, and said that 
he does not agree with the World Bank opinion of democracy 
and corruption in Yemen.  Adding that \"we don\'t accept the 
idea that there is corruption,\" Saleh said that everything in 
Yemen happens in \"complete transparency\" and cited open 
tendering for ROYG contracts and salary increases for judges 
as two of the reforms the ROYG has undertaken.  Criticizing 
the World Bank for sending incorrect information to 
Washington, Saleh said that Yemen is not a Gulf State, \"we 
are a poor country and don\'t have corruption.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Saleh: CT Cooperation Should Count for Something 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5. (c) Highlighting the ROYG\'s counterterrorism cooperation 
with the U.S., Saleh complained that the value of USG 
assistance does not match the political cost of supporting 
the U.S. and argued that more assistance should be given to 
Yemen.  Natsios replied that MCA qualification is distinct 
from other forms of USG assistance, such as the type Yemen 
already receives.  MCA, Natsios explained, is intended for 
countries with a proven record of reform and serves as an 
incentive for countries to make politically difficult 
decisions. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Saleh: Stay Away From the Diesel Subsidy 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. (c) Yemen may be considered for MCA, Natsios said, because 
President Saleh and his Ministers have shown that they can 
make tough reforms and that Yemen is close to qualifying. 
Otherwise, Natsios said, we would not be discussing MCA 
qualification.  Blaming his earlier questioning of MCA 
criteria on the effects of his Ramadan fast, Saleh closed the 
meeting by saying that Post could speak with DPM Sofan about 
necessary reforms as long as the diesel subsidy is not 
discussed.  Claiming that there would be \"revolution in the 
streets\" if the ROYG heeded the World Bank and IMF 
recommendation to cut subsidies, Saleh said reducing the 
diesel subsidy is not politically feasible.  (Background: 
The IMF and World Bank have been encouraging the ROYG to 
reduce the diesel and gas subsidy which costs the ROYG 3% of 
its GDP.  The subsidy is widely believed to do little to help 
farmers reduce costs, but supplies a large smuggling 
business.  Riots occurred when subsidies were reduced on food 
and gas in 1997; however, in 2001 when the diesel subsidy was 
last reduced there was little visible protest because the 
ROYG announced a concomitant pay increase for civil servants. 
 End background.) 
 
------------------------------ 
DPM Sofan and Governor of Aden 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (c) Earlier, DPM Sofan described Yemen\'s development 
history to Natsios, and identified Yemen\'s 3.5% population 
growth rate and slow economic growth as issues of immediate 
concern.  While commenting that Yemen still had a long away 
to go in democracy and governance areas, Sofan touted recent 
improvement in the good governance category of the World 
Bank\'s Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA). 
Natsios praised Yemen\'s development progress, but added that 
MCA qualification could lead to even more development 
assistance if Yemen improved in such areas as corruption and 
transparency.  When Aden Governor al-Shaubi joined the 
meeting, Natsios and the Ambassador raised the possibility of 
USG assistance to Aden local councils as a way to support 
ROYG decentralization initiatives. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Health: Key Sector in Development Strategy 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8. (c) Natsios and Minister of Public Health and Population, 
Dr. Mohammed al-Noemi, agreed on the importance of a lower 
population growth rate if the ROYG is to meet its economic 
development goals, including basic education for all, reduced 
mortality and improved employment opportunities.   (Comment: 
At the current 3.5% growth rate the population will double to 
40 million in twenty years, just about the time that the 
World Bank estimates that Yemen,s proven oil reserves will 
be depleted.  End Comment.)   Natsios told the Minister that 
improved health is a key goal of the USG development program 
in Yemen and that the USG looks forward to assisting the 
Minister in implementing health reforms. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Comment: MCA Incentive for Democratic Reform 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (c) Comment: While initially questioning Yemen\'s 
provisional \"Governing Justly\" scores that may not qualify 
Yemen for MCA in the first year, Saleh seemed to come around 
to Natsios\' argument that the amount of money available for 
MCA qualifying countries may be worth democracy and 
governance reforms.  Post has engaged with ROYG interlocutors 
at every level describing what is known about MCA criteria 
and where Yemen needs to show improvement. Natsios\' pitch may 
give incentive to President Saleh to heed the growing donor 
push in Yemen for more progress in the areas of democracy and 
governance.  End Comment.

1. (sbu) Embassy Sanaa warmly welcomes you and your team to 
Sanaa, Yemen, December 7-8.  You will be the first visitor 
from the Department of Commerce since Deputy Assistant 
Secretary Molly Williamson in May 2001.  Your visit will 
 
SIPDIS 
afford an opportunity for follow-on talks with the Yemeni 
businessmen you met on the margins of the September Yemen Days 
symposium.  Your meetings with ROYG officials will provide an 
important forum to press Yemeni officials and businessmen to 
improve the tendering process and give due regard to U.S. 
bidders and to encourage Yemen\'s continued progress on WTO 
accession.  You will also find your Yemeni counterparts eager 
to hear about the U.S. Trade agenda, specifically the Middle

2. (U) WHILE MAINTAINING SUSTAINED SECURITY COOPERATION WITH 
YEMEN IS A KEY OBJECTIVE, USAID REOPENED ITS OFFICE IN JUNE 
AND AS PART OF THE MISSION DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS FOCUSING ON THE 
EDUCATION, HEALTH AND AGRICULTURE SECTORS.  OUR MIDDLE EAST

SANAA LOOKS FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO EXPAND ITS ECONOMIC 
ASSISTANCE THROUGH BOTH USAID AND MEPI.  THE MISSION IS ALSO 
WORKING WITH YEMEN TO IMPROVE ITS CHANCES FOR QUALIFYING FOR 
THE MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE ACCOUNT (MCA) IN THE FUTURE. 
 
----------------- 
ECONOMIC OVERVIEW 
----------------- 
 
3. (u) One of the 25 poorest and least developed countries in 
the world, Yemen\'s real GDP per capita is approximately 
US$481. According to the World Bank, GDP growth for 2002 was 
2.9 percent, which does not match population growth of 3.5 
percent per year.  Unemployment is estimated to be 25-35%, and 
oil resources, which account for one third of the gross 
national product and 70% of government revenues, are expected 
to decline significantly during the next decade.  Despite 
these negative indicators, many international donors praised 
Yemen\'s fiscal policy and progress in economic reform 
throughout the last five years. 
 
-------------------- 
Trade and Investment 
-------------------- 
 
4. (u) Yemen is considered by the World Bank to be among the 
most open and trade liberalized countries in the MENA region. 
However, oil exports represented more than 95 percent of total 
merchandise exports in 2000.  Of the remaining 5 percent, 
products such as fish, coffee, fruits, and vegetables are low 
value added.   Similar constraints also restrict the ability 
of Yemeni producers to contribute to internal economic growth 
and employment creation by exporting their products to markets 
within Yemen. 
 
5. (sbu) Foreign investors are discouraged from investing in 
Yemen because the legal structure is weak and commercial 
courts are ill-equipped to adjudicate disputes.  Proctor and 
Gamble\'s (P&G) long standing IPR case (ref a), is an 
illustrative example of the problems investors face.  Judges 
are often unfamiliar with commercial law, and since the 
unification of North and South in 1990, conflicting laws 
remain on the books.  Courts are burdened with large caseloads 
and, often, a case may take years to be heard and then 
stagnates in the appellate process.  If a commercial ruling is 
won, it is rarely enforced.  Without a clear land-titling 
system, limited ability to collateralize against property, and 
courts\' reluctance to enforce default judgments against 
property collateral, domestic investors are also reluctant to 
invest their money into new businesses. 
 
6. (sbu) One of the greatest obstacles to direct foreign 
investment in Yemen is the non-transparent and protracted 
nature of the tendering process.  Two American firms, Delma 
and Fusion, have had difficulty with the confidentiality of 
their bids.  There have also been bids awarded to American 
businesses that were later overturned and rewarded to their 
competitors.  Post has raised concerns about the tendering 
process at the highest levels and repeats often that a sound 
tendering process is necessary for continued American 
investment in Yemen. 
 
7. (u) The following is an overview of suggested themes to 
raise at your upcoming meetings. 
 
-------------------- 
American Businessmen 
-------------------- 
 
8. (u) American Business is dominated by the oil sector in 
Yemen.  Hunt Oil Company has recently renewed its agreement 
with Yemen to continue their operations until at least 2010. 
Production in Yemen Hunt Oil\'s Jannah and Marib fields 
contribute about 140,000 bpd of Yemen\'s total 450,000 bpd. 
Yemen Hunt is the second largest producer in Yemen behind 
Canadian Nexen, which produces about 240,000 bpd.  While 
output from the Marib concession is falling, the introduction 
of new technologies is expected to minimize the decline in the 
near term. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Dinner with Yemeni Businessmen and 
Working Level Trade Contacts 
----------------------------------- 
 
9. (u) Post proposes a dinner hosted by DCM Alan Misenheimer 
with Yemeni businessmen on December 7.  This dinner will be a 
chance to talk with the business delegation you met with on 
the margins of the Yemen Days celebrations in September.  The 
businessmen are hesitant about, if not against, WTO accession 
and any information you can provide on WTO and the Middle East 
Free Trade Agreement (MEFTA) will help promote our dialogue on 
these issues.  Because the businessmen are also a strong 
lobby, you may also want to raise problems with the investment 
climate and solicit their input for reforms. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Minister of Industry and Trade Rajeh Sheikh 
------------------------------------------- 
 
10. (u) Bio note:  Dr. Khaled Rajeh Sheik was born in 1955. 
He has a PhD in Economic Administration.  He has also served 
as a Cabinet Economic Affairs Officer, as the Assistant 
Secretary-General of the Supreme Council for Economic and 
 
SIPDIS 
Investment Affairs, and as a Regional Consultant for the 
International Labor Organization.  He is an assistant 
professor at Arwa University. End bio note. 
 
11. (u) Ministry of Industry and Trade (MEIT) officials are 
moving forward on WTO accession with the help of a five 
year/seven million Euro grant from the EU.   Yemen will also 
be receiving assistance through the State Department\'s MEPI 
program for GCC members and WTO accession.  Presently, 
officials at MEIT are finalizing answers from the 167 
questions submitted from the U.S., the EU and Australia on 
Yemen\'s Memorandum of Foreign Trade Regime.  Officials hope to 
have their working party meeting early in 2004.  Minister 
Rajeh Sheikh also oversees all intellectual property rights 
enforcement, and this visit is a good opportunity to raise our 
desire to see Yemen\'s Supreme Court\'s ruling in favor of P&G 
upheld (ref a). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technology al- 
Moalimi 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
12. (u) Bio note: Abdul-Malik al-Moalimi was born in 1947.  He 
has a BA in Engineering and a Diploma in Administration.  He 
has also served as Minister of Telecommunications (2001-2003), 
as Deputy Minister of Education (1998-2001) and as Deputy 
Minister of Labor and Vocational Training (1990-1992).  End 
bio note. 
 
13. (u) Only 1.5 percent of all Yemenis have phone lines, and 
the ROYG plans for 3 million additional phone lines by 2009. 
While there is little American investment presently in this 
sector, telecommunications and information Technology could be 
a source of American investment (ref b). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Planning and 
International Cooperation Sofan 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
14. (u) Bio note: Ahmad Mohammed Sofan was born in 1958.  He 
has a High Diploma in Economics and Political Sciences from 
the UK (1970).  He is licensed in Sharia and Law, Sana\'a 
University (1985).  He has been the Minister of Planning and 
Development since 1991.  He has also served as the Minister of 
Industry, as a Shura Council member and is a Member of 
Parliament.  End bio note. 
 
15. (u) Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Planning and 
International Cooperation Sofan will want to hear about the 
MEFTC and opportunities to expand trade.  Post is also closely 
engaging with Sofan\'s office on Yemen\'s potential qualifying 
for the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA).  Presently, Post 
does not believe Yemen will qualify for MCA in the first year, 
and in order to qualify in future years it must make progress 
in the \"Governing Justly\" category.  Particular areas of 
concern are Yemen\'s poor court systems, which have a direct 
impact on foreign direct investment and government 
effectiveness. 
 
16. (u) If past experience serves as a guide, Sofan will ask 
to increase trade and investment cooperation with the USG. 
Recent American experiences with unsound tendering practices 
and the P&G saga, however, make it necessary for Post to 
reiterate that the investment climate must improve before 
American companies will invest in Yemen.  We encourage you to 
echo our message and provide a perspective on what U.S. 
companies seek in an investment climate.

 1.  (c) Summary:  The UN Committee of Experts presented 
highlights of its  \"Report of the Panel of Experts on Somalia 
pursuant to SCR 1474\" (2003) to members of the Diplomatic 
Corps in Yemen on November 16.  A number of Ambassadors or 
Deputy Chiefs of Mission from western countries, including 
the UK, Germany and France, as well as African states, 
including Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia attended; Pol/Econ 
Chief represented the Embassy.  The discussion focused mainly 
on Yemen\'s role as a supplier and transporter of arms.  The 
Committee also reported on an earlier meetings with ROYG 
officials, including FM Qirbi, representatives of the 
ministries of interior, Defense and Transportation, and 
\"military intelligence,\" noting that the response from the 
ROYG was positive, but that more needs to be done.   In 
addition to general agreement that information sharing is 
important, several key points were made in both sets of 
meetings:  the amount of arms in Yemen must be reduced; the 
ROYG is aware of the illegal export of arms via sea routes 
and plans to increase licensing of arms and 
registering/monitoring of vessels; and Yemen has requested 
assistance from the international community in increase its 
capacity to track and to stop smugglers.  End summary. 
 
2. (c) Prior to briefing the Diplomatic Corps, the Committee 
met with ROYG officials, including Foreign Minister Qirbi, 
and the vice ministers of Interior, Defense and 
Transportation and representatives from \"military 
intelligence\" to discuss the expert report.  Per the 
Committee, FM Qirbi promised cooperation on the Somalia arms 
embargo/arms smuggling issue, but expressed reservations 
about the report and Yemen\'s role in the problem, stressing 
the country\'s lack of capabilities, particularly for 
controlling its maritime borders.  The ROYG is aware of the 
illegal export of arms, which Yemeni officials said need to 
be addressed by the international community and will be 
helped by the establishment of a fully functioning radar 
system to help track smugglers.  According to a Committee 
representative, the Commander of the Yemeni Coast Guard (YCG) 
explained that the YCG is new and has only been developed 
over the last year. 
 
3. (c) A Committee member identified the major issue for 
Yemen as the quantity of arms in the country, which the 
Committee was told would be addressed by licensing and 
increased efforts to stop arms from entering Yemen and 
increasing  the capacity of the YCG to monitor its maritime 
borders.  He added that on tracking the movement of boats, 
the ROYG said it is working on registering boats (see 
above-cited report, paragraph 90, regarding information on 4 
vessels registered in Mukullah involved in Yemen-Somalia arms 
smuggling), including working with Yemeni fishermen in the 
south.  The Committee said that overall the response from the 
ROYG was positive, but the conclusion was that there was a 
lot to be done and more information sharing is needed. 
 
4. (c) The German Ambassador noted problems with the gun 
control legislation (it was tabled during last Parliamentary 
session, had to be re-introduced following the April 2003 
elections, and shows no sign of movement toward passage) and 
agreed that both an overall reduction in arms and the 
registration of weapons are necessary.  The Committee agreed 
that encouraging the ROYG to implement gun control 
legislation is important, but said it had not heard much 
about the substance of the draft law. 
 
5. (c) British Ambassador criticized the Committee\'s 
contention that its existence and visit to Yemen would deter 
arms smuggling.  She said that the 4-5 key arms dealers in 
Yemen are not likely to stop because an expert panel asks 
questions.  A Committee member responded that the UNSC\'s 
attention, including expert panels and their reports, to this 
issue should help deter embargo violations.  (Comment: The 
response was met with considerable skepticism by the 
audience.  End comment) 
 
6. (c) There were several general questions about how to help 
Yemen support the arms embargo against Somalia.  The 
Committee noted that on-going dialogue, cooperation among 
countries in the region, the Intergovernmental Authority on 
Development (IGAD), the Arab League and African Union is 
needed.  It also emphasized the need for stability in the 
region and problems with gaining access to Somalia\'s 
territorial waters because there is currently no recognized 
government. 
 
7. (c) After the briefing, the German expert told Pol/Econ 
Chief that when the Committee met with both Brigadier General 
Robeson and the Italian commander of the Red Sea fleet and it 
was told that the security/CT mandate of the fleet does not 
extend to interdiction of arms smuggling, which is largely 
done via smaller boats staying within territorial waters.  It 
was informed that the fleet does not have the type of boats 
needed to conduct such close surveillance, and to expect a 
reduction in the number of ships available for patrols (see 
also report, paragraphs 86-87).  The expert also noted that 
ROYG officials did not respond to requests for information 
about the weapons used in the November 2002 al-Qaida attacks 
in Mombassa (see report, box on pages 29-30, for more details 
on the source of the weapons used in the attacks). 
 
8. (c) Comment: Unlike earlier reporting on official 
rejection of the use of Yemen\'s airports for smuggling (ref 
a), the ROYG does not deny that there is arms smuggling from 
Yemen to Somalia via sea routes.  Standing up of the Yemeni 
Coast Guard, including the anticipated delivery of four 
reconditioned EDA patrol boats from the U.S. in January 2004, 
is an important step toward increasing Yemen\'s capacity to 
provide maritime security.  The long-anticipated gun control 
law faces serious political opposition from tribal leaders 
who see it as an attempt to limit their influence and power. 
Even if such a law is passed, implementation in regions 
outside the capital is likely to be extremely difficult.  End 
comment.

1.  (C)  Summary:  DCM and Pol/Econ Deputy received updated 
information on the Sana\'a Inter-Governmental Conference on 
Democracy, Human Rights and the role of the International 
Criminal Court to be held in January (reftels) from No Peace 
Without Justice (NPWJ) representative Niccolo Figa-Talamanca 
12/3.  Figa-Talamanca noted changes in the agenda, including 
creating a new working group session on the role of civil 
society in democracy and human rights.  Confirmed government 
participants include the Jordanian Foreign Minister, the 
German Deputy Foreign Minister and the French Minister of 
State for Foreign Affairs, while prominent non-government 
participants include Saad Eddin Ibrahim.  Organizers expect 
the foreign minister and/or the justice minister to attend 
from Arab countries.  The ICC working group panel is 
well-developed, while the organizers continue to welcome 
assistance and advice on the composition and design of the 
other two working groups.  Post will continue to track 
conference preparations.  End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
Agenda Structure 
---------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Figa-Talamanca said the agenda was refined further 
to reflect concerns raised by Post and others.  In addition 
to plenary sessions, the three sub-conferences/working groups 
are now divided into a) the democracy and rule of law, b) the 
role of civil society in promoting democracy and human 
rights; and c) the International Criminal Court (ICC).  The 
democracy and rule of law and the ICC sessions would have 
primarily government participants while the civil society 
session would involve primarily NGO and media participants. 
Figa-Talamanca said this adjustment was partly in response to 
Post\'s concerns about the ICC panel, in that the organizers 
believe limiting non-government participation to only the 
highest levels in the ICC panel would limit potential 
anti-U.S. rhetoric.  He said that each working group would 
begin with five to seven minute speeches from specific 
highest-level participants and follow with open discussion in 
which speakers register during the first session to speak. 
 
3.  (U)  Figa-Talamanca said the non-ICC portions of the 
agenda were less well-developed in terms of participants and 
focus because he was waiting for the National Democratic 
Institute (NDI) Yemen Country Director to return 12/9 and for 
an UNDP representative to arrive 12/10 to consult further. 
He also reiterated an invitation for Embassy Sanaa 
representatives to join those discussions and help shape the 
sessions. 
 
------------------------------ 
Invited and Confirmed Speakers 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  (U)  Figa-Talamanca said several prominent government and 
non-government officials have confirmed their attendance, 
including the Jordanian Foreign Minister, the German Deputy 
Foreign Minister, the French Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs, the Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, 
international law expert George Abisaab and activist Saad 
Eddin Ibrahim.  He said the Dutch were considering sending 
either the Minister for Development and International 
Cooperation or the head of parliament\'s foreign affairs 
committee.  DCM asked about Arab countries participation, and 
Figa-Talamanca said they received assurances that at least 
one of the two government ministers invited (Foreign Minister 
and Justice Minister) would attend from most Arab countries. 
The organizers have not yet received confirmations from Iraq 
or Afghanistan yet, but he said they \"really hope they come.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
International Criminal Court (ICC) Working Group 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5.  (U)  DCM again noted USG concerns over the ICC portion of 
the conference and asked for more details.  Figa-Talamanca 
said he expected the Jordanian Foreign Minister to address 
the plenary in Jordan\'s capacity in the presidency of the ICC 
Assembly of States Parties, with the Prosecutor of the ICC 
Luis Moreno Ocampo speaking at the working group.  He said 
\"it is possible to discuss ICC without being anti-American,\" 
noting that in two recent conferences where the ICC was the 
primary focus -- a technical-level governmental one with 105 
countries in 2002 and a combined governmental and NGO one 
held in Rome in 2003 -- the American position was not a 
focus.  He expected either the French or German deputy FMs to 
also speak at the ICC working group level.

1. (u) On December 1, a three-judge panel affirmed the death 
sentence of Abed Abdulrazak al-Kamel, who was convicted in 
May 2003 of the December 30, 2002 murders of 3 U.S. citizens

appeal the decision to the Yemen Supreme Court.  Court 
officials, however, expect that the conviction will be upheld

order to carry out the sentence.  No specific date has been 
set for Kamel\'s execution. 
 
2. (u) Kamel claimed he coordinated the attack with Ali

1. (C) Summary and Comment:  Pol/Econ Deputy met with 
Minister of Human Rights Amat al-Alim al-Suswa December 1 to 
discuss the ROYG\'s input for the 2003 Human Rights Report, 
her winning the fight to maintain ministry responsibilities 
for human rights through effective by-laws and her trip to 
Washington and Oman for programs aimed at increasing women\'s 
political participation.  The Minister looks forward to 
meetings at the Department to discuss the Middle East 
Partnership Initiative and human rights in Yemen.  Her 
description of the ROYG internal fight over the Ministry\'s 
by-laws illustrates in part the dynamics often at play in 
Yemeni politics.  Her victory, along with by-laws that 
provide strong guidance and accountability, should bode well 
for the ROYG\'s efforts to improve the human rights situation 
and increase women\'s participation in political life.  End 
Summary and Comment. 
 
MINISTER THREATENS TO RESIGN UNLESS GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY 
NEEDED TO DO THE JOB RIGHT 
 
2. (C) Minister al-Suswa described a last-minute fight within 
the ROYG on issuing the Republican Decree outlining the 
regulatory by-laws on the Ministry of Human Rights (MHR) that 
she ultimately won.  The by-laws abolish the previous 
structure of a Supreme Committee on Human Rights chaired by 
the Prime Minister, with Deputy Ministers from key ministries 
and with the Minister of State for Human Rights\' role akin to 
a secretary general.  Several ministries and some members of 
the Prime Minister\'s office were reluctant to relinquish the 
structure (Comment: presumably because of power and control 
issues, as well as the potential loss of government perks. 
End Comment).  The Minister said she argued that maintaining 
both structures -- a (nominal) full Ministry and a Supreme 
Committee -- with similar mandates would undermine Yemen\'s 
ability to improve human rights because of competing 
interests and confusion over accountability.  She said at one 
point she offered to resign should the new Ministry not 
receive the \"responsibility needed to do the job right.\" 
Ultimately, the Minister prevailed and retained her ability, 
underwritten by specific by-laws issued by Republican Decree, 
to take charge of Yemen\'s human rights agenda. 
 
MINISTRY BY-LAWS PROVIDE DETAILED SCOPE OF WORK 
 
3. (U)  The by-laws outline the general functions and tasks 
of the MHR, the responsibilities of the Minister, Deputy 
Minister, Board and staff and its regulatory structure.  The 
Ministry\'s primary functions include: 
 
--  proposing \"policies, programs and procedures required for 
the enhancement of human rights and their protection in 
coordination with the bodies concerned;\" 
 
--  studying legislation and laws to judge compatibility with 
international human rights conventions and treaties ratified 
by Yemen and proposing amendments as necessary; 
 
--  receiving complaints from citizens and organizations to 
\"study them and treat them in accordance with jurisdictions 
of MHR in coordination with bodies concerned;\" 
 
--  enhancing \"fields of cooperation\" with civil society 
organizations; 
 
--  contributing to the preparation of human rights studies; 
 
--  reporting on Yemen\'s international HR commitments; and 
 
--  coordinating with the human rights-related international 
organizations and developing cooperation with them. 
 
4. (U) The regulatory/organizational structure is made up of 
the Minister, a Deputy Minister (Note:  Not yet appointed. 
End note), a Board made up of the Minister, Deputy Minister, 
advisors and general directors, and seven General 
Directorates (complaints and reports, legal affairs, 
organizations and international reports, civil society 
organizations, awareness, studies, researches and 
translation, and financial and administrative affairs). 
 
INPUT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT 2003 
 
5. (U) Minister al-Suswa provided detailed responses -- 
coordinated with other relevant ROYG ministries -- to 
specific questions asked by Post for inclusion in the 2003 
Human Rights Report, including case updates regarding the 
disappeared from the 1994 civil war and previous wars and 
other security-related cases.  In addition, she detailed the 
re-cast ROYG initiative to improve prisoners\' rights, 
including the release of those criminal prisoners (not/not 
terror-related suspects) who have served two-thirds of their 
sentence and behaved well, the increase in women security 
guards for women\'s prisons and recommendations for improving 
prison infrastructure to alleviate space problems that 
exacerbate human rights conditions. 
 
MINISTER TO WASHINGTON AND MUSCAT -- INCREASING WOMEN\'S 
POLITICAL PARTICIPATION 
 
6. (U) The Minister left for Washington December 5 to take 
part in the National Democratic Institute\'s Win with Women: 
Strengthen Political Parties global women\'s forum on December 
9-10.  As the sole Yemeni representative, she said she 
coordinated with opposition parties (Islah and YSP) on their 
input but will represent the General People\'s Congress (GPC) 
primarily.  She said she looks forward to meeting with DoS 
officials, including NEA/PI A/DAS Romanowski and 
representatives from DRL.  On her way back from Washington, 
she is stopping in Muscat at the invitation of Vital Voices 
Global Partnership (VVGP) to speak at an Embassy 
Muscat-sponsored conference on women\'s leadership in Oman.

2.  (C)  Ambassador and Pol/Econ Deputy called on Minister of 
Human Rights Amat al-Alim al-Suswa December 9 to ascertain 
what happened at Frankfurt Airport that caused her to turn 
back and cancel her trip to Washington for the National 
Democratic Institute (NDI)-sponsored Win With Women event and 
other official meetings (reftel). 
 
3.  (C)  The Minister flew Yemenia Airlines from Sanaa to 
Frankfurt, enroute to Dulles.  While checking in at the 
United counter in Frankfurt to obtain her boarding pass, the 
Minister said that the computer beeped and the person behind 
the counter told her she had been picked by the computer for 
a security search.  The Minister described the person as a 
\"security employee\" of United Airlines.  The employee was 
\"polite\" and said she would have to undergo a search of all 
luggage and questioning.  When the Minister asked why she had 
been picked and explained she was traveling on an official 
basis at the invitation of NDI as a ROYG Minister, the 
employee said that the computer had picked her and that it 
had also picked a \"Turkish Muslim\" whom the Minister later 
discovered was a United Nations employee.   The airline 
employee also told the Minister that the computer chose 
persons from certain countries to be searched.  The Minister, 
affronted and upset by the procedure, asked for her passport 
and tickets back and said she would not go on the flight if 
this was how she was treated.  She then discovered that the 
Yemenia flight returning to Sanaa would be leaving shortly, 
and she was able to take the flight back to Sanaa. 
 
4.  (C)  Unlike some reports Post heard from Washington 
interlocutors, at no time was she told she would have to 
undergo a \"body search.\"  The Minister said when she told 
fellow ROYG Ministers and others about her incident upon 
return, they told her they had endured similar experiences, 
particularly on American airlines. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  It seems to us that there is a significant 
difference between intensive security checks required at 
random to which all are subject versus intensive checks 
required for Yemen and other Islamic countries.  Post will 
seek to ascertain from United Airlines their reasons for 
requesting the check, but would welcome any clarification 
Department can obtain.  End comment.

1.  (S/NF)  Summary: The DCM convened an EAC meeting on 
December 9, 2003, to review security conditions for Embassy 
personnel and the general American community in light of a 
recent news article reporting that Yemeni al-Qaeda has 
threatened attacks in the next 48 hours.  The EAC commenced 
with a brief synopsis of the article by the DCM and the 
degree of credibility attributed to the article by the ORCA 
Chief.  As the published threat was assessed to be (a) of 
uncertain validity, at best, and (b) directed against the 
Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG), not U.S. interests in 
Yemen, the EAC decided a new warden message is unnecessary. 
Key offices and personnel represented included: DCM, 
POL/ECON, MO, CONS, PD, ORCA, DAO, OMC, FPD, MSG and RSO. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  The DCM briefed EAC members on the 12/08/2003 BBC 
report citing that Yemeni al-Qaeda has threatened a response 
directed at the ROYG in the next 48 hours in retribution for 
the host government\'s failed attempt to arrest Abdallah 
Al-Qar\'am (NFI).  ORCA Chief explained that none of the 
players named in the article is known, adding that the source 
of the BBC\'s information was a website whose credibility was 
uncertain, at best. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Based on ORCA\'s assessment and the article\'s 
specific language of targeting ROYG elements, the EAC decided 
that issuance of a new warden message is unwarranted at this 
time.  DCM emphasized to EAC members the need to alert RSO if 
new information arises. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Concomitantly, RSO raised the issue of the 
currently heightened regional threat to expatriate housing 
compounds, and the pending request to MOI for an additional 
lane closure on Haddah Road in front of Haddah compound.  DCM 
reiterated that these threats are generalized, not Yemen 
specific.  It was agreed that DCM and RSO would raise the 
issue in pending meeting with the Interior Minister\'s Office 
Director. 
 
RSO comment: MOI representative assured RSO on 11/25/2003 
that he would raise the Embassy\'s concern at the next ROYG 
Security Council meeting.  End comment. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Finally, RSO suggested center-massing Embassy 
employee apartments within Haddah compound as new leasing 
contracts become available.  Acting Consul added that the 
Consular Section has recently generated a list of all Amcits 
residing in the compound, including addresses and passport 
numbers.

1. (u) Post warmly welcomes the MEPI FY 03 funding 
recommendations (ref a) and is pleased that Yemen is strongly 
represented across the pillars.  At the same time, Post would 
appreciate being considered for the following programs: 
 
Economic Pillar: Post requests that Yemen be considered for 
Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) development as part of the 
Middle East Finance Corporation.   Because SMEs constitute 96 
percent of the private sector in Yemen, their development is 
vital to the continued growth of the country\'s economy (ref 
b). 
 
Education Pillar: Post requests that Yemen be included in the 
\"Partnership Schools\" program.  Reftel b explains the 
inadequacies of Yemen\'s educational system.  In sum: Yemen\'s 
schools are ill-suited to meet the needs of a growing 
population and developing economy: teachers are poorly 
trained, qualified English language instructors are rare, and 
technology is not yet used in most classrooms. 
 
Women\'s Pillar: Post welcomes MEPI strategic thinking on 
women\'s issues and believes Yemen will be fertile ground for 
continued focus on women\'s development. 
 
2. (u) Comment:  MEPI funding in Yemen has been successful in 
strengthening democratic processes and will soon bring 
internet connectivity to ten schools and increase women\'s 
literacy.  Post looks forward to the development 
opportunities the FY 03 allocations will bring.  End Comment.

1. (C) Saddam\'s capture dominated discussion at UAE National 
Day December 14 with numerous Yemenis seeking Ambassador out 
to congratulate him.  Saddam\'s surrender without a fight 
surprised many.  Shura Council member Mohammed Tayeb told 
Ambassador in confidence that President Saleh had reacted 
angrily to Saddam\'s surrender because Saddam allowed himself 
to be taken without a fight.  Saudi Ambassador Khattani noted 
humiliation of Saddam\'s meek and degrading appearance during 
medical examination.  Several Yemeni\'s confirmed that 
Saddam\'s image had been deflated in their eyes.  Other 
comments welcomed the role of Iraqi Governing council and the 
Iraqi court in meting out justice to the former president. 
In presenting congratulations, one Iraqi-American expressed

SUBJECT: YEMEN: 2003 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 301352 
 
1.  Embassy Sana\'a responses to instructions for the 
\"Patterns on Global Terrorism\" report are keyed to lettered 
paragraphs in State 301352. 
 
2.  Post responses: 
 
A) SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TAKEN BY HOST GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT 
THE GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST AL-QAIDA OPERATIVES, BUT 
INCLUDING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS AND  ACTIONS TO BLOCK TERRORIST 
ASSETS, ENACT NEW COUNTERTERRORISM LAWS, AND RATIFY EXISTING 
TREATIES. 
 
-- Law Enforcement:  There was continuing law enforcement 
cooperation between Yemeni and U.S. law enforcement 
authorities throughout 2003, which has produced tangible 
results and progress on dismantling al-Qaida in Yemen: 
 
On November 25, the Republic of Yemen government (ROYG) 
arrested Saudi-born Mohammed Hamdi al-Ahdal (AKA Abu Assam 
al-Maki), who has been implicated in the October 2000 attack 
on the U.S.S. Cole.  Abu Assam is suspected to have been a 
close associate of Ali al-Harithi, who was among the six 
al-Qaida suspects killed in November 2002 in Marib and is 
believed to have been a mujahidin facilitator connected to 
the Cole attack.  U.S.-trained and equipped Central Security 
Forces (CSF) put their training into action and played a 
central role in the operation to apprehend Abu Assam. 
 
Hadi Dulqum, a weapons dealer, al-Qaida associate and 
supplier of weapons for the group also arrested by the ROYG 
in 2003 and remains in custody. 
 
In mid-September 2003, the ROYG disrupted an al-Qaida cell 
operating in Sana\'a, Yemen and targeting Western interests. 
The cell was headed by Afghanistan-trained \'Amr al-Sharif, 
who was trying to reconstitute al-Qaida in Yemen.  In 
October, however, the ROYG expressed confidence that the 
\"danger was over\" for Western targets in Yemen and asserted 
that all cell members inside Yemen had been captured.  The 
government provided further information on the ROYG\'s 
investigation into the cell\'s activities and members, 
particularly information on several arrests in Yemen and 
Saudi Arabia. 
 
In cooperation with Yemeni officials, the FBI actively 
participated in the investigation of the December 30, 2002 
shootings of three American health care workers in Jibla. 
Pursuant to the joint investigation, the shooter, Abed 
Abdulrazak al-Kamel, was tried, convicted and sentenced to 
death in an open trial in May 2003.  This decision was upheld 
by the appellate court and is being referred to the Yemen 
Supreme Court (see also, response to Question B). 
 
During Operation Iraqi Freedom, an Iraqi Intelligence Service 
(IIS) sleeper cell was disrupted by the ROYG in Sana\'a and 
its members arrested.  This cell was planning attacks on U.S. 
Embassy personnel. 
 
There was one significant Anti-Terrorist Assistance (ATA) 
event with the ROYG in 2003.  From July 26 to August 6, the 
Department of State and the FBI jointly sponsored a terrorist 
crime scene investigation training course for ROYG officials. 
 Yemeni officials trained by the FBI participated in the 
take-down of the \'Amr Sharif al-Qaida cell (see above). 
 
-- Military/Counterterrorism Cooperation:  Based on mutual 
cooperation with Yemen, the U.S. is providing: 
 
- counter-terrorism training and modernization for Yemeni 
Special Forces; 
-  U.S. Military Training Teams (MTTs) in country to train 
ground and maritime forces; 
- equipment (including 8 patrol boats due to arrive in early 
2004), training, and guidance to establish Yemeni Coast Guard 
(YCG) capabilities; 
- equipment and training for Yemen\'s Terrorist Interdiction 
Program (TIPS), an on-line system for monitoring entry and 
exit from all of Yemen\'s air, land, and sea ports.  The 
program is currently in Phase II (of 3 phases) and has 
established monitoring portals at all 24 border crossing 
points in Yemen.  Phase III will be completed in early 2004. 
 
These collaborations are producing tangible successes.  In 
June 2003, the newly-formed Central Security Forces (CSF) CT 
unit was dispatched to the Hattat mountains in Abyan province 
to hunt down and bring to justice those responsible for an 
attack on a Red Crescent medical convoy the week before.  The 
area commander put this unit, trained by British and U.S. 
forces, at the lead of this effort when Ministry of Defense 
forces became bogged down by harassing gunfire from the 
surrounding hills.  Over a three day period, the CSF unit 
engaged those responsible and completed their mission with 
praise from Minister of Interior Alimi and President Saleh. 
The same unit was sent out the following week to complete 
mop-up operations, as they were trained to do by the 
U.S./British training teams. 
-- Actions to block terrorist assets:  Throughout the year, 
Yemeni authorities referred for action to appropriate banking 
institutions information about individuals and entities 
identified under U.S. executive orders as related to 
terrorists or terrorist activities, as well as the freezing 
of Iraqi assets.  The regulatory system of Yemeni banks 
remains relatively unsophisticated, however, and it is 
difficult to assess its effectiveness. 
-- Diplomatic Efforts:  President Saleh and senior government 
officials in 2003 held extensive bilateral discussions with 
visiting senior U.S. officials (CENTCOM General Abizaid, FBI 
Director Mueller, CJTF-HOA Commander General Robeson, 
Assistant Secretary Burns, Under Secretary for 
Non-Proliferation Ambassador Bolton), in which U.S.-Yemeni 
counter-terrorism cooperation was a key issue. 
 
-- Ratification of Existing CT Treaties:  As of November 
2003, the Yemeni government still needed to ratify two of the 
twelve (financing and bombing) counter-terrorism treaties, 
both of which have been referred to Parliament and are 
expected to be ratified by early 2004. 
 
B) DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF EACH 
COUNTRY TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT 
ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 2003, INCLUDING ANY HOST 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO TERRORISM.  PARTICULAR 
ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT ACTIONS 
REGARDING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. 
CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. 
 
-- There have been no reported kidnappings of any Westerners 
since the November 2001 kidnapping of the German businessman. 
 The Yemeni government has worked closely with U.S. officials 
to prevent attacks against Western interests. 
 
-- The perpetrators of the December 30, 2002 shootings of 
three Americans in Jibla -- Abed Abdulrazak al-Kamel, the 
shooter, and Ali Ahmed Mohamed Jarallah, the planner -- were 
tried, convicted and sentenced to death in separate trials in 
2003.  On December 1, 2003, a three-judge panel affirmed the 
death sentence of al-Kamel, who will appeal the decision to 
the Yemen Supreme Court.  Court officials expect that the 
conviction will be upheld and passed to President Saleh, who 
is likely sign off on the order to carry out the sentence. 
Post representatives attended al-Kamel\'s trial and appeal 
proceedings, which were relatively transparent and openly 
reported in the local media. 
 
-- Al-Kamel coordinated the attack with Ali al-Jarallah, who 
was convicted of both the Amcit murders and the assassination 
of Yemeni Socialist Party Deputy Secretary-General Jarallah 
Omar in a separate trial in Sana\'a in October 2003. 
Al-Jarallah is also expected to appeal his conviction and 
sentence.  No specific date has been set for the executions. 
 
-- In April 2003, it was reported that a number of the U.S.S. 
Cole suspects had escaped prison; two have since been 
recaptured, but neither of the primary suspects, Jamal 
Mohammed al-Badawi and Fahd Mohammed Ahmed al-Quso, have been 
returned to custody. 
 
-- An Islamic scholarly commission formed in August 2002 
continues its dialogue efforts with detainees arrested in 
connection with extremism and/or terrorist attacks which 
reportedly include Yemeni returnees from Afghanistan and 
members of the Al Jihad organization.  Prior to being 
released, the detainees are screened by the Political 
Security Organization (PSO) and must sign statements assuring 
good conduct (i.e., commitment to Yemeni President Saleh, the 
constitution, laws, peace and security, the rights of 
non-Muslims, and the inviolability of foreign interests). 
Thirty-four detainees were released post-Ramadan 2002 and the 
commission recommended 92 for release after Ramadan 2003.  At 
this date it remains unclear how many have actually been 
released. 
 
-- In October 2003, despite repeated statements that \"Islamic 
Aden-Abyan Army\" leader Khalid Abd-al-Nabi was dead, Yemeni 
officials revealed that he was not killed in February 2003 
confrontations between the hard-line Islamic group and a 
Yemen army anti-terrorism unit in the Hattat Mountains 
region, Abyan Governorate (in the southern part of the 
country).  Instead, Abd-al-Nabi surrendered to the Yemeni 
authorities, was released from custody, and is not facing 
charges for any of his activities. 
 
C) DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING 
THE YEAR?  PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO U.S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR 
ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES. 
 
D) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
(Answer to Question 2C and 2D combined) 
 
-- Article 45 of the Yemeni Constitution prohibits the 
extradition of any Yemeni citizen to any foreign authority. 
 
-- There is no extradition treaty between Yemen and the 
United States, and Yemen made no requests for extradition 
from the U.S. in 2003. 
 
-- The ROYG requested that the U.S. not extradite Shaykh 
Mohammed Hasan al-Moayad and Mohammed Mohsen Yahya Zayed, 
both Yemeni citizens, from Germany to the United States to 
face charges of conspiring to provide support to al-Qaida and 
HAMAS.  Al-Moayad and Zayed arrived at Kennedy International 
Airport in New York on November 16, 2003 and were 
subsequently arraigned in U. S. District Court in Brooklyn, 
New York. 
 
-- Yemen periodically exchanges prisoners with Saudi Arabia, 
including terrorist suspects.  One October 2003 press report 
claims that 40 \"militants\" have been exchanged in the past 
two years.  Names are generally not provided. 
 
E) DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. 
THESE WOULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES 
FOLLOWING A TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY) 
AND EFFORTS BY HOST GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
-- In January 2003, the official government news agency 
(SABA) undertook a public diplomacy campaign aimed at 
stigmatizing terrorist activities.  The government printed 
booklets on \"The Phenomenon of Terrorism in Yemen\" to 
highlight the political, social and economic costs of 
terrorism, which were presented to Yemen\'s Parliament and 
widely distributed.  In 2003, the ROYG also began publishing 
the details, names and pictures of terror suspects, e.g., 
escaped U.S.S. Cole suspects. 
 
-- The public statements of President Saleh, Prime Minister 
BaJammal, Minister of Foreign Affairs Qirbi, Minister of 
Interior Alimi, and other senior Yemeni officials in 2003 
made clear the policy of the Yemeni government to oppose 
international terrorism, especially the activities of 
al-Qaida (see responses 2A through 2D above).  President 
Saleh repeatedly called upon al-Qaida elements in Yemen to 
repent and abandon their mistaken views, and to surrender to 
Yemeni authorities. 
 
F) DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 2003 
BY THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
-- Increased cooperation with the U.S. on counter-terrorism 
(as described in the responses above) has included improving 
the Yemeni capabilities to develop and implement a Maritime 
Security Strategy and to increase border security. 
 
-- Land border security, particularly the long frontier with 
Saudi Arabia, is a major concern for Yemen.  In the aftermath 
of the Riyadh bomb attacks in May 2003, Yemen and Saudi 
Arabia launched a joint effort (reportedly with funding from 
the Saudi side) to improve border control, including a signed 
agreement in June 2003 to upgrade border surveillance.  An 
important change on the Yemeni side is that responsibility 
for border control is expected to be transferred from the 
military to civilian forces under authority of the Ministry 
of the Interior.  The head of the Border Guards has a bold, 
but as-yet unfunded, plan to establish 18 districts along the 
Yemeni-Saudi border to provide in depth defenses against 
smuggling activity. 
 
-- Yemen has also initiated a tripartite collaboration with 
Sudan and Ethiopia to increase counter-terrorism, security 
and cultural cooperation, as well as economic development. 
 
G) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS, 
INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS OR THEIR ACTIVITIES; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT 
THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION; MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC 
POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; 
PROVISION OF SANCTUARY AND/OR THE PRESENCE OF OFFICES OF 
TERRORIST GROUPS; PROVISION OF TRAINING OR TRAINING SITES; 
PROVISION OF WEAPONS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON TERRORISM ISSUES 
IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
-- Yemen is a supplier and transshipment point for weapons, 
including surface-to-air missiles, to both Middle Eastern and 
Horn of Africa countries.  A UN Committee of Experts recently 
reported on the need to reduce arms in the country and to 
increase international cooperation to reduce the flow of arms 
from Yemen to Somalia.  The government is aware of the 
illegal export of arms via various routes, and is taking 
steps to make borders less permeable (e.g. boat/vessel 
registration) and to track weapons within its borders (e.g., 
gun licensing). 
 
-- Like other Arab governments, Yemen distinguishes between 
terrorism, which it condemns and opposes, and what it sees as 
legitimate resistance activities against the Israeli 
occupation by Palestinian organizations such as HAMAS and 
Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ).  (Note: This position was 
given formal expression in the 1998 Arab Convention on the 
Suppression of Terrorism. End note) 
 
-- Yemen has consistently opposed the U.S. definition of 
\"terrorism\" and calls for a \"demarcation line\" to be drawn 
between \'terrorism\' and \'resistance\' in reference to the 
Palestinian intifadha.  Yemen\'s policies provide political 
support to Palestinian organizations, while seeking to 
dissociate it from approval for terrorist acts, such as HAMAS 
and PIJ-sponsored suicide attacks against non-combatant 
Israeli targets. 
 
-- Al-Qaida is attempting to re-constitute an operational 
presence in Yemen. 
 
-- HAMAS maintains a political presence in Yemen. 
 
-- Yemen\'s indigenous Aden-Abyan Islamic Army remains active. 
 
-- While Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) has a legally declared 
presence in Yemen, it does not have any known actual or 
operational presence. 
 
-- Shaykh Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, Speaker of the Yemeni 
Parliament, has repeatedly called for boycotting Israeli 
goods as well as the goods that are made in states supporting 
Israel.  In an October rally for boycotting U.S. and Israeli 
goods at Sana\'a University, Al-Ahmar said that \"we must not 
buy Israeli products because it supports and strengthens the 
enemies of Islam, the oppressors, and the murderers who are 
spilling the blood of our Palestinian brothers.\"  Al-Ahmar 
subsequently backed away from any boycott of American goods. 
The al-Ahmar family runs the lucrative Kentucky Fried Chicken 
franchise in Sana\'a. 
 
H) HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 
SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM 
ISSUE?  (THE SEVEN GOVERNMENTS DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY AS 
STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ARE CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, 
NORTH KOREA, SYRIA, AND SUDAN. PLEASE NOTE THAT, ALTHOUGH 
IRAQ REMAINS A DESIGNATED STATE SPONSOR, ALL APPLICABLE 
SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED.) 
 
-- The Yemeni government does not consider Arab countries 
such as Iraq, Syria and Sudan as \"terrorist-supporting\" 
countries.  As far as Iraq is concerned, the Yemeni 
government did not support U.S.-led Operation Iraqi Freedom 
and never accepted the U.S. position that the former Iraqi 
regime possessed weapons of mass destruction. 
 
-- In many local and international events, Yemen has 
reiterated its rejection of terrorism and violence, as well 
as any activities that aim to impair the interests of any 
country.  Yemen always called for lifting the sanctions 
imposed on Sudan, Libya and Iraq \"as the reasons for imposing 
the sanctions do not conform with international laws.\" 
 
-- Yemen has never considered suicide attacks carried out by 
HAMAS or by other jihad movements in Palestine as terrorist 
acts, but it called on such organizations to give former 
Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Mazen the chance to accomplish 
peace. 
 
-- On November 12, 2003, Yemeni Vice President Abd Rabbu 
Mansour Hadi met with the Syrian Ambassador in Sana\'a 
denouncing Israeli threats to strike at Syria and declaring 
full support to Syria, which is strongly opposed to U.S. and 
Israeli policies.  The official Saba News Agency quoted Vice 
President Hadi as vowing full support to Syria \"against any 
provocations threatening Syria\'s security or stability.\" 
These remarks came after Israel had threatened to hit Syria 
if it continued to support extremist organizations 
threatening Israel from Syrian territories. 
 
-- In May 2003, Iranian President Khatami visited Yemen to 
sign seven bilateral agreements to cooperate on security, 
trade, development, culture and shipping; Khatami was on the 
first visit by an Iranian president to Sana\'a since the 1979 
Islamic Revolution.  Relations between the two countries have 
improved noticeably in recent years and both nations have 
shown a firm political resolve to boost bilateral ties. 
 
-- Yemen has consistently expressed solidarity with Sudan and 
called for its territorial integrity to be maintained.  The 
Yemeni government welcomed and expressed strong support for 
the recent peace accord signed between the Sudanese 
government and the Sudanese Front for the Liberation of 
Sudan. 
 
I) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 2002, POSITIVE OR 
NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS 
CHANGE? 
 
-- Over the past several years, Yemen\'s attitude regarding 
international and domestic terrorism has strengthened 
noticeably, and the trend continued throughout 2003.  (See 
responses to questions above.)

SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING - 20 DECEMBER 2003 
 
Classified By: Ambassador E.J. Hull, for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (s)  Summary: On December 20 Ambassador convened an EAC 
meeting to discuss Post response to recent security incidents 
involving Westerners.  Post has confirmed that three Western 
males were stabbed in or near the Old City on December 15-17. 
 After reviewing security procedures, the Embassy issued an 
updated warden message cautioning Americans against travel on 
foot around Bab al-Yemen, Tahrir Square, the Bounia 
neighborhood and the areas surrounding the Taj Sheba Hotel, 
Jamal Street and Suq al-Qah.  Subject to ROYG concurrence, 
EAC also agreed to request that RSO arrange security-escorted 
visits for Embassy personnel who wish to visit these areas. 
End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Three Westerners Stabbed in Old City Area 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (s) RSO briefed the EAC on what Post has been able to 
confirm through contacts with other Embassies and the ROYG. 
On December 15 a Dutch national was knifed in Bab al-Yemen. 
On December 16, a German national was stabbed walking from 
the Taj Sheba hotel to al-Tahrir Square.  On December 17, an 
Austrian national was knifed knocking at a door in the 
al-Bunia neighborhood.  RSO also informed the EAC that all 
the men were clearly identified as European and are blond. 
The Austrian national told the Yemen Observer newspaper that 
the attacker muttered something regarding Saddam Hussein. 
 
3.  (s) A/DCM relayed information from the German DCM who 
said the Austrian national and the German national have 
described different attackers.  Local news organizations also 
report the German national said he was attacked by two men. 
 
--------------------------- 
ROYG Confirms Two Stabbings 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (s) A/RSO met with Ministry of Interior Chief of Staff 
Sunidar on December 18 who confirmed that a Dutch and a 
German national were stabbed.  CONS issued a warden message 
on December 18 informing the community of two stabbings. 
A/RSO noted that he requested a follow-up meeting with the 
Ministry of Interior (MOI), but this request was denied by 
the MOI, which cited that A/RSO already had met with Sunidar 
that week and that Sunidar was tied up in meetings all day. 
A/RSO will continue to push for an MOI meeting as soon as 
possible.  Ambassador reviewed Warden message distribution 
procedures, noting that many Embassy employees only received 
the annoucement on Saturday morning (December 20) when they 
opened their email.  CONS will investigate alternate weekend 
distribution to American employees. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
New Security Procedures: Escorted Visits to Areas of Concern 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
5.  (s) Ambassador proposed to the EAC that the A/RSO, in 
consultation with the CLO, organize escorted trips to the 
areas of concern.  AID suggested adding Suq al-Qah to the 
areas subject to caution and EAC members concurred.  FPD 
encouraged all Embassy staff to travel in groups.  The EAC 
agreed to issue a Warden message updating members of the 
American community about the third incident.  The message 
also cautions American citizens to be particularly alert and 
to avoid travel on foot around Bab al-Yemen, Tahrir Square, 
the Bounia neighborhood and the areas surrounding the Taj 
Sheba Hotel, Jamal Street and Suq al-Qah.  EAC also agreed to 
reissue guidance encouraging Americans to limit use of public 
transportation to known, reliable operators.  An updated 
Warden message was sent on December 20. 
 
6. (u) Ambassador tasked CONS to take the temperature of the 
Warden community and advise if the Ambassador should schedule 
a Warden meeting.

REF  A) STATE 328024 
 
 
1. (SBU) EMBASSY SANAA SUBMITS ITS UPDATE FOR THE 2003-2004 
INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL STRATEGY REPORT (INCSR) AT 
PARA TWO.  COMMENT:  WHILE THE ROYG MUST IMPROVE ITS 
ENFORCEMENT OF FINANCIAL CRIMES, THE PASSAGE OF ANTI-MONEY 
LAUNDERING LEGISLATION REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD 
IN MEETING INTERNATIONAL BANKING STANDARDS.  END COMMENT. 
 
2. (U) Begin Text: 
 
The extent of money laundering in Yemen is not known.  Yemen\'s 
Parliament passed anti-money laundering legislation in April 
2003.  However, the inexperience of the Central Bank of Yemen 
(CBY) in enforcing new money laundering legislation and the 
prevalence of hawala (informal money transfers) make Yemen 
vulnerable to money laundering.  The CBY supervises Yemen\'s 
relatively small banking sector, which consists of 14 
commercial banks, including three Islamic banks.  Domestic 
banks account for approximately 60 percent of the total 
banking activities, while foreign banks cover the other 40 
percent. 
The 2003 legislation criminalizes money laundering for a wide 
range of crimes including narcotics offenses, kidnapping, 
embezzlement, bribery, fraud, tax evasion, illegal arms 
trading, and money theft, and imposes penalties of three to 
five years imprisonment.  There is no specific legislation 
relating to counter-terrorist financing in Yemen, but 
terrorism is covered in various pieces of legislation that 
treat terrorism and its financing as serious crimes. 
The law requires banks, financial institutions, and precious 
commodity dealers to verify the identity of persons and 
entities that want to open accounts or deal with them, to keep 
records of transactions for up to ten years and to report 
suspicious transactions.  In addition, the law requires that 
reports be submitted to an information-gathering unit within 
the CBY.  The unit acts as the Financial Intelligence Unit 
(FIU), which in turn will report to the Anti-Money Laundering 
Committee (AMLC).  The AMLC is composed of representatives 
from the Ministries of Finance, Justice, Interior, and 
Industry and Commerce, the CBY, and the Board of Banks is 
authorized to issue regulations and guidelines and provide 
training workshops related to combating money laundering 
efforts.  Several training workshops have been conducted by 
the CBY in 2003 on the new legislation. 
The law grants the AMLC the right to exchange information with 
foreign entities.  The head of the committee can ask local 
judicial authorities to enforce foreign court verdicts based 
on reciprocity.  Also, the law permits the extradition of 
criminals in accordance with international treaties or 
bilateral agreements.  (Note:  The Yemeni Constitution 
prohibits the extradition of Yemeni citizens.  End note.) 
In April 2002, the CBY issued Circular 22008, informing banks 
and financial institutions that they must verify the legality 
of all proceeds deposited in or passing through the Yemeni 
banking system.  The circular stipulates that financial 
institutions must positively identify the place of residence 
of all persons and businesses that establish relationships 
with them.  The circular also requires that banks verify the 
identity of persons or entities that wish to transfer more 
than $10,000 through banks at which they have no account.  The 
same provision applies to beneficiaries of such transfers. 
Banks must also take every precaution when transactions appear 
suspicious, and report such activities to the CBY.  The 
circular was distributed to the banks along with a copy of the 
Basel Committee\'s \"Customer Due Diligence for Banks,\" 
concerning \"Know Your Customer\" procedures. 
In response to UNSCR 1267/1390 and Yemen\'s Council of 
Ministers directives, CBY issued a number of circulars to all 
banks operating in Yemen directing them to freeze accounts of 
144 persons, companies, and organizations, and to report any 
finding to CBY.  As a result, one account was immediately 
frozen with a balance equal to $33. 
A LAW WAS PASSED IN 2001 GOVERNING CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS, 
ENTRUSTING THE MINISTRY OF PENSIONS AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS WITH 
OVERSEEING THEIR ACTIVITIES.  THE LAW IMPOSES PENALTIES OF 
FINES AND/OR IMPRISONMENT ON ANY SOCIETY OR ITS MEMBERS FOR 
CARRYING OUT ACTIVITIES OR SPENDING FUNDS FOR OTHER THAN THE 
STATED PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE SOCIETY WAS ESTABLISHED. 
Yemen is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and has 
signed, but not yet ratified, the UN Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime, which is not yet in force 
internationally.  Yemen is a member of the Arab Convention for 
the Suppression of Terrorism. 
The Government of Yemen is making progress in enforcing its 
domestic anti-money laundering program.  However, 
international cooperation with criminal investigations is 
nascent.  As of the writing of this report, the CBY is still 
organizing its enforcement mechanism; its effectiveness will 
demonstrate the ROYG\'s commitment to ending money laundering. 
As a next step, Yemen should also enact specific legislation 
with respect to the financing of terrorism and pass a law 
giving the ROYG executive authority to freeze assets of those

AIRPORT

1.  (C)  As part of Post\'s investigation into security 
procedures at Frankfurt Airport affecting official ROYG 
travelers, DCM met with United Airlines officials on December 
18 to explore the incident.  Background:  When transferring 
to United Airlines in Frankfurt, the Minister of Human Rights 
was subject to stringent security checks without regard to 
her official status, and she chose to not travel to 
Washington rather than be subject to these checks (reftel). 
End Background. 
 
2.  (C)  The DCM met with a United Airlines security official 
to gain more information about their security policies and 
practices.  The official confirmed that United, along with 
other U.S.-flag carriers, is subject to TSA guidelines. 
According to the United official, TSA guidelines include the 
following: 
 
-- CTX screening of all baggage and random computer selection 
of some bags for physical search; 
 
--  Passenger screening at two levels, personal interview and 
computerized review.  For both, travel from Yemen and/or 
Yemeni citizenship triggers additional scrutiny.  This policy 
of profiling is not random and the United official said that 
connection (citizenship and/or point of origin/destination) 
to a Middle East country is a major criteria; 
 
--  The computer review selects individuals (including 
Amcits) traveling to/from the Middle East for additional 
screening without exception.  The computer does not/not take 
note of whether a given Amcit traveler bears a diplomatic 
passport or not and the computer has no field for such 
information to be entered into the system.  Likewise, no 
provision exists for non-American Government officials 
traveling on diplomatic passports on diplomatic visas (such 
as the ROYG Minister of Human Rights) to be identified. 
 
--  When the computer selects an individual, a security 
employee has no discretion to exempt the selected traveler. 
 
3.  (C)  Pol/Econ Deputy met with Minister al-Suswa December 
22 to inform her of the DCM\'s findings.  She said she 
appreciated Post looking into the procedures and understood 
why they were in place security-wise.  She added, however, 
that she already turned down an invitation from Northwestern 
University because she did not want to \"be humiliated\" by 
traveling on U.S.-flag airlines.  She noted that it did not 
make sense for security officials to spend extensive time on 
official government travelers on diplomatic missions when 
there were \"bad guys\" to catch. 
 
4.  (C)  Comment:  Post confirms that these procedures apply 
to all travelers from certain countries.  Embassy personnel 
have also received increased scrutiny, including extensive 
questioning and other search procedures.  End Comment.

1. (S/NF) Summary: In an extended 12/17 meeting with 
President Saleh, PM Senior Advisor Bodine welcomed 
U.S.-Yemeni CT cooperation and, along with the Ambassador, 
requested greater access for U.S. interrogation teams. 
Supporting U.S. assistance for Yemen\'s security and 
development, Ambassador Bodine and the Ambassador calmed 
Saleh\'s concerns with the December visit of an Export and 
Border Security (EXBS) team to the Haradh border crossing 
point.  Saleh and Ambassador Bodine also exchanged views on 
Iraq and former Secretary Baker\'s successful efforts on debt 
rescheduling.  Saleh briefed on the advanced status of the 
Saudi-Yemeni border demarcation.  Ambassador Bodine\'s meeting 
with FM Qirbi will be reported septel.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) PM Senior Advisor Ambassador Barbara Bodine, 
accompanied by the Ambassador, DCM and Pol/Econ Chief 
(notetaker) called on President Saleh on December 17 during 
Bodine\'s 2-day stay in Yemen.  The meeting lasted an hour and 
forty-five minutes. 
 
SALEH: SAUDI CT COOPERATION IS NOT A PRECEDENT FOR U.S. 
ACCESS TO DETAINEES 
 
3. (S/NF) In response to Ambassador Bodine\'s question about 
developments on the CT front, Saleh cited to the recent 
apprehension of Abu Asim (refs a and b), and the rolling up 
of \"3 or 4 cells\" related to al-Qaida.  He noted there has 
been no recent violence and that \"tribal kidnapping is over.\" 
 He gave a brief overview of the al-Sharif cell\'s proposed 
targets (refs c and d), which included the British and 
Italian Embassies, the French cultural center, ROYG officials 
and buildings, as well as the American Ambassador.  He said 
that most importantly, \"those arrested had all graduated from 
holy Mecca,\" and included one Yemeni-American and ten Saudis. 
 Saleh claims that Yemen has gotten ten suspects from the 
Saudis, 8 of them Yemeni, and has requested four more. 
 
4. (S/NF) Saleh said Yemen has focused on stopping terrorist 
financing and that cutting off financial resources has 
noticeably improved things.  He then said that when the ROYG 
got names from Abu Asim, they invited Saudi officials to 
Yemen.  Both Ambassador Bodine and the Ambassador strongly 
advocated that Yemen should accord the same privileged access 
to U.S. experts.  Saleh stated that on December 16 he gave 
instructions to ORCA to see key detainees, including Hadi 
Dulqum, in order to \"clear up any doubts\" that they were in 
custody and immediately got on the phone with Presidential 
Security Office (PSO) Chief General Gamish to confirm that 
the visits had taken place.  Both Ambassadors pointed out 
that this was not the same as approval for appropriately 
trained U.S. experts to directly interrogate the detainees. 
Saleh insisted that the Saudi situation is different because 
of the flow of money from Saudi Arabia and that the Saudi 
officials only got information and were not permitted to 
directly question the detainees.  Following a second call to 
Gamish, Saleh explained that the information provided to the 
Saudis concerned Abdo Abdullah al-Khatani and a possible 
terrorist attack at a wedding in Saudi Arabia.  He suggested 
that if the U.S. wants information, it should give the 
questions to the PSO in writing.  He later amended this and 
said the U.S. could submit questions to the detainees related 
to \"threats to the U.S. or terrorist elements in Yemen\" and 
the ROYG would relay their answers. 
 
5. (S/NF) The Ambassador pointed out that the arrest and 
questioning of Saddam Hussein produced information that led 
to arrests of more militants, which prevented further 
terrorism and saved lives.  Saleh claimed that Saddam is a 
totally different situation because of the U.S. occupation. 
He continued that the U.S. can have information, through the 
PSO, that relates to \"U.S. interests, headquarters, citizens 
or employees,\" but that he will not permit the direct U.S. 
interrogation of any Yemeni.  The Ambassador raised the issue 
of Abu Asim -- the ROYG insisted he was in al-Jowf, but the 
Ambassador told Saleh and PSO that Abu Asim was in Sana\'a, 
which was correct and resulted in his arrest (ref e).  Saleh 
acknowledged good U.S.-Yemen cooperation, but complained that 
U.S. demands equated to U.S. interference in Yemeni internal 
affairs. 
 
6. (S/NF) Saleh berated the Ambassador for \"provoking\" him 
and protested that there is a military guard for the U.S. 
Embassy compound, but not one soldier in front of the Yemeni 
Embassy in Washington.  The Ambassador reasoned that there 
should be a practical way to meet the interests of both sides 
without violating the Yemeni constitution and cited a number 
of countries, including Pakistan, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, 
where we were able to find an acceptable solution.  Saleh 
agreed that the issue could be discussed, but emphasized that 
Yemen is \"not under U.S. mandate\" and that it would deal with 
the U.S. on its own terms.  He said that cooperation should 
be done under the auspices of an agreement and complained 
that Yemen submitted a working paper/security MOU to 
Washington that was rejected.  The Ambassador noted that the 
U.S. has already gone beyond the terms of any proposed MOU. 
 
7. (S/NF) Saleh was upset by the Export and Border Security 
(EXBS) team\'s visit to Haradh on December 7.  He claimed that 
members of the team demanded to see passports and lists of 
names to know exactly who was crossing back and forth from 
Yemen to Saudi Arabia.  (Note:  The team did not inspect 
either passports or any lists, as far as we know.  End note.) 
 Both Ambassadors assured him that the purpose of the program 
is to strengthen border security.  The visit was only to 
assess what procedures are already in place and to determine 
what technical assistance the U.S. could best provide.  Saleh 
retorted that the visit was done in a \"provoking manner\" and 
that the region is a \"pit of terror\" that Yemen is trying to 
keep calm.  He continued to insist that Yemen welcomes 
training and equipment, but that he would prefer to sign an 
MOU regarding the exchange of information.  Even when 
confronted with the facts that the MFA had helped arrange the 
trip and that the team was accompanied by Yemeni officials, 
Saleh\'s response was that Yemen cooperates with the U.S. 
\"like no one else in the region or world,\" but the U.S. 
administration provides only promises.  He again said he 
would not be provoked and that the U.S. needs to stop its 
\"internal intervention.\" 
 
8. (S/NF) Turning to the issue of money, Saleh railed that 
Yemen got $20 million for vehicles, and that it was promised 
$21 million if Abu Asim was arrested.  He complained that 
there are now additional conditions and that the U.S. is 
attempting to renegotiate terms.  Both Ambassadors assured 
him that the U.S. is not trying to bargain, but Saleh 
interrupted that FBI Director Mueller promised a $5 million 
reward for Jaber al-Banna and that he is now being told that 
the reward is only for American citizens.  (Comment: 
Director Mueller made no/no such promise during his visit to 
Sana\'a.)  Ambassador Bodine said that assistance and 
cooperation are both part of an on-going process and 
highlighted the increased programming for security, military 
and political cooperation since her departure over two years 
ago. 
 
9. (S/NF) Saleh expressed deep dissatisfaction with what he 
characterized as the United States, lack of recognition of 
Yemen,s counter-terrorism accomplishments and complained 
that he has not heard \"thank you.8  In response, the 
Ambassador said &shookran8 (&thank you\" in Arabic) several 
times.  He also asked whether Saleh had been briefed on the 
three U.S. planes that recently arrived carrying supplies and 
equipment for the Central Security Forces (CSF), the PSO, and 
the Presidential Guard and whether Deputy Prime Minister 
Sofan had told him of the progress on a 416(b) agreement for 
dry milk products.  Saleh dismissed the 416(b) plan, but both 
Ambassadors encouraged him to reserve judgment.  Saleh 
bragged that the ROYG is the &police force of the region8 
and bemoaned U.S. &stinginess,8 but promised to maintain 
the level of security even if cooperation were to cease. 
 
10. (S/NF) Towards the end of the meeting, Saleh said he 
would like to see greater transparency, and denied that he 
was trying to &twist arms,8 calling such an approach 
undemocratic.  The Ambassador noted that there are problems 
in every important U.S. bilateral relationship.  He explained 
that we will continue to ask for more cooperation, but that 
it will be done in an appropriate way that will not create 
problems for Yemen, and that we will continue to try to 
expand our support for development, cultural and security 
cooperation.  Saleh reiterated his request for transparency 
and praised the idea of fruitful cooperation based on mutual 
trust, saying without trust, cooperation is meaningless.  He 
said &we are ready8 and asked both Ambassadors to carry 
back the correct impression, closing with the observation 
that &the problem with the Europeans is that they are not 
like the Americans, who are open and frank.8  Ambassador 
Bodine echoed this sentiment and reassured Saleh that his 
candor is appreciated and that trust and honesty is important 
for a healthy relationship.  Saleh said only the future will 
tell, but Ambassador Bodine noted that the past is a good 
guide. 
 
SALEH ON IRAQ:  U.S. Should \"Distribute the Cake\" to France 
and Germany 
11. (C) Saleh inquired about Ambassador Bodine\'s involvement 
in Iraq.  She commented on strong Iraqi efforts to rebuild 
their country.  Saleh said that if the situation improves, it 
will good for the U.S., but if it worsens, it will be the 
responsibility of the U.S. administration.  Expressing 
confidence that the situation will improve, Ambassador Bodine 
commented that some Iraqis were afraid that Saddam would 
return and that with his capture the Iraqi people can now 
begin to look to the future, not over their shoulder to the 
past.  Calling former Secretary James Baker a friend, Saleh 
noted the success of his trips to Germany and France and said 
that the U.S. should \"distribute the cake\" and reconsider 
giving France and Germany a role in Iraq\'s reconstruction. 
 
12. (C) Citing Oman and Bahrain, Saleh referred positively to 
the region\'s gradual steps toward democracy and said that 
Oman is taking \"smart\" steps to quell unjustified fears about 
democratic elections.  He noted Yemen\'s progress on local 
councils since 2001, and cited the fact that there were 7,000 
candidates \"from every village\" this time around.  He said 
that the recent local council by-elections for 92 seats 
yielded 8 seats for Islah and 4 seats for YSP.  He also said 
that the GPC reclaimed 19 seats formerly held by Islah and 
that this represents the public\'s rejection of Islamic 
extremists.  (Comment: Islah is Islamist but not all elements 
are extremist.  Its leadership encompasses a broad spectrum 
that includes both moderate and extreme elements.  End 
comment.) 
 
13. (C) Ambassador Bodine commented that it is important to 
maintain balance in the system and that the GPC would lose 
credibility if it captured 99.5 percent of the vote.  Saleh 
acknowledged the point and said that the GPC wants others to 
participate and advocates complete transparency.  He joked 
that Islah always claims that they know the election results 
in advance - if they win, it should have been by more; if 
they lose, it was rigged, but there is always an excuse at 
the ready for any outcome.  He reiterated that Yemenis are 
not happy with the more radical/extremist parties and noted 
that the socialists left a poor legacy by pushing for 
separation and expounding bad economic policy.  He said that 
he has called on the opposition parties to form a joint forum 
and provided financial support for its formation, an effort 
he claims is aimed at making sure the ruling party (GPC) does 
not get 99.5% of the vote. 
 
YEMEN-SAUDI BORDER DEMARCATION IN FINAL STAGES 
 
14. (C) Saleh said that they are finalizing the technical 
review of the Yemen-Saudi land border.  He claims that Yemen 
has spent $1.1 billion on the project, which is being done by 
a German company and a Lebanese sub-contractor. 
 
COMMENT:  SALEH\'S PUBLIC FACE DOES NOT ALWAYS MIRROR HIS 
PRIVATE MESSAGE 
 
15. (S/NF) Comment:  Some of Saleh,s blustering about 
&provocation8 may have been posturing for his advisors and 
others in the room (there was one ringer later identified as 
a Nassarite \"cultural\" advisor).  Iryani tried to give us a 
heads up at the start of the meeting asking Ambassador Bodine 
if she had a \"private message\" for the President.  We missed 
the hint. Had the meeting taken place in private or with 
fewer participants, Saleh may have been more willing to admit 
that U.S.-Yemen CT cooperation has, in spite of its 
successes, not yet fully evolved and has room for 
improvement.  Clearly recognizing that the tone of the 
meeting was more confrontational than the situation 
warranted, Presidential Advisor Abdelkarim al-Iryani (who was 
present at the meeting) called Ambassador Bodine on December 
18 to apologize on behalf of President Saleh and reiterate 
Yemen and Saleh\'s confidence in the fundamental strength of 
the relationship. End Comment.

 1. (C) Summary: During a 12/18/03 call on Foreign Minister 
Qirbi, PM Senior Advisor Bodine and Qirbi exchanged signed 
diplomatic notes to complete an Article 98 agreement, (ROYG 
has asked that this not/not be publicized, however.)  Without 
setting a precise date, Qirbi responded positively to the 
Secretary\'s offer to meet during February 4-6, 2004, and 
 
SIPDIS 
supported completion of a U.S.-Yemen TIFA and 416(b) 
agreement for dry milk by that time.  Efforts to control 
small arms smuggling to Yemen and within its borders were 
also discussed, and Ambassador Bodine offered U.S. diplomatic 
support with other countries in coordination with Yemen\'s 
revised procedures and review of outstanding end-user 
certificates.  Qirbi explained the new Yemen-Oman maritime 
agreement, and asked for more assistance on border and 
maritime security.  He noted that President Saleh\'s concerns 
about the EXBS team\'s December visit would likely be 
alleviated when the program produces tangible results, i.e., 
training and equipment.  Qirbi responded matter-of-factly to 
the Ambassador\'s briefing on the appointment of military 
counsel for a Yemeni Guantanamo detainee, but seemed unaware 
of rumors of a European businessman\'s stabbing near Tahrir 
Square (ref a) and promised follow-up with ROYG security 
offices.  Ambassador Bodine\'s 12/17 meeting with President 
Saleh is reported septel.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) PM Senior Advisor Ambassador Barbara Bodine, 
accompanied by Ambassador, DCM and Pol/Econ Chief (notetaker) 
called on FM Abubakr al-Qirbi on 12/18/03 at his office. 
Qirbi also hosted a lunch in honor of Ambassador Bodine later 
in the day. 
 
ARTICLE 98: EXCHANGE OF DIPLOMATIC NOTES COMPLETED 
 
3. (SBU) FM Qirbi accepted the Secretary\'s signed December 
10, 2003, note on an Article 98 agreement hand-carried from 
Washington by Ambassador Bodine.  Qirbi signed and provided 
Ambassador Bodine with the ROYG\'s response note, in both 
English and Arabic, dated December 18, 2003.  Ambassador 
Bodine has hand-carried the ROYG notes to Washington.  The 
text of the ROYG\'s Article 98 note, which reiterates and 
agrees to the provisions in the note signed by the Secretary, 
is below in paragraph 16.  No ceremony accompanied the 
exchange, and Qirbi specifically requested that the agreement 
not/not be publicized. 
 
OFFER OF FEBRUARY MEETING WITH THE SECRETARY:  SIGNING TRADE 
AND INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT (TIFA) AND 416(B) 
ARRANGEMENT POSSIBLE 
 
4. (C) After the exchange, Ambassador Bodine gave Qirbi the 
Secretary\'s December 10 letter to express thanks for the 
 
SIPDIS 
ROYG\'s \"expeditions approval of the text\" of the Article 98 
agreement and to extend an invitation to the Foreign Minister 
to come to Washington for a meeting between February 4-6, 
2004, to \"discuss broader issues of bilateral cooperation.\" 
Qirbi responded positively, and undertook to get back to the 
Embassy shortly with proposed precise dates.  The Ambassador 
said that he would try to be in Washington at the same time 
as the FM. 
 
5. (C) Noting that a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement 
(TIFA) is a first step toward a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), 
the Ambassador suggested that it might be possible to 
complete the negotiations and have the TIFA ready for 
signature during the proposed February visit.  Qirbi again 
responded positively, commenting that while a TIFA for Yemen 
has more of a psychological impact than concrete long-term 
benefits, it is still important. 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador also briefed Qirbi on the status of the 
416(b) program, noting that work with Yemen,s prominent 
business families has resulted in progress toward an agreed 
price for dry milk that would extend the program for about 
two years.  The Ambassador gave credit to USDA )- &a hero 
in U.S.-Yemen relations8 )- and suggested that if the 
timing worked out the agreement could also be signed in 
February.  Qirbi responded with a few questions and agreed to 
consider the possibility. 
 
QIRBI: CONTROLLING SMALL ARMS THROUGH END-USER CERTIFICATES 
AND LICENSING 
 
7. (C) Ambassador Bodine raised the issue of controlling the 
flow of small arms to and through Yemen.  Commenting 
favorably on the ROYG,s decision to vet all end-user 
certificates through its embassies abroad, she suggested that 
the U.S. could be helpful with diplomatic support with key 
producing/exporting countries.  Qirbi explained that the ROYG 
decision is to negate all end-user licenses, and that the 
plan is to continue to pressure traders of small arms to and 
within Yemen.  He said, secondly, that there is a law in 
Parliament that would enforce the government policy on 
carrying arms within the country.  (Note: Presumably a 
reference to the gun licensing law that was tabled by 
Parliament during 2002, and also in 1999/2000, and 
reintroduced after the April 2003 elections, which shows no 
sign of movement towards passage.  End note.)  Qirbi said a 
third goal is to slow the smuggling of arms from Yemen to the 
Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia (ref b).  He mentioned, 
however, that the French Embassy had notified him that they 
stopped a small boat carrying arms in the reverse direction, 
from Somalia to Yemen. 
 
8. (C) Ambassador Bodine remarked that the ROYG has made 
excellent progress on the Yemen Coast Guard.  The EDA boats 
(expected in January 2004) would help the government\'s 
efforts.  The Ambassador said that he is getting reports that 
the Yemeni students in coast guard training in the U.S. are 
finishing at the top of their classes.  Qirbi proudly noted 
that three of the top ten graduates from the police academy 
in Dubai are Yemeni, and that this demonstrates not superior 
academic ability, but a good selection process.  Ambassador 
Bodine agreed that this reflects positively on Yemen,s 
reputation for selecting candidates for student slots, and, 
after their graduation, utilizing them effectively.  This 
reputation facilitated the embassy\'s efforts to secure 
training slots for Yemenis elsewhere in our cooperation 
programs. 
 
QIRBI ON THE NEED FOR MORE BORDER/MARITIME SUPPORT AND 
SALEH\'S REACTION TO THE EXBS VISIT 
 
9. (C) Qirbi said that he has complained to the Europeans 
that the U.S. does not provide adequate resources for 
border/maritime security.  He said that the Italians are 
giving $22 million dollars for radar from Aden to Shuqrah, 80 
miles to Aden\'s east.  The Ambassador requested that Captain 
Innes, U.S. Maritime Advisor to Yemen, be informed about the 
radar, which he noted seemed excessively expensive for its 
reported coverage.  Ambassador Bodine commented that the 
Yemen Coast Guard (YCG) should not be viewed as solely a U.S. 
project and that other donors should be encouraged to provide 
expertise and equipment.  Both the U.S. and the ROYG would 
benefit from a broader base of support to the YCG.  The 
Ambassador suggested that when the YCG gets the EDA boats 
operational (7 to 10 days after arrival this January) the 
ROYG should invite all potential donors to a ceremony to 
promote support for the YCG. 
 
10. (C) The Ambassador raised the issue of President Saleh\'s 
reaction to the Export and Border Security (EXBS) 4-person 
team\'s visit to Haradh (septel).  After explaining the 
background on the trip, including Deputy Foreign Minister 
Ambassador al-Dhabi\'s involvement in the planning, the 
Ambassador noted that the team is now back in Washington to 
battle for equipment and training to help Yemen improve its 
border controls.  He commented that Saleh misperceived the 
team\'s activities as \"spying.\"  The Ambassador said that if 
the ROYG decides that EXBS is not an appropriate program for 
Yemen, we will not force the issue, but we need to see what 
Washington proposes first.  Qirbi responded that the support 
provided by the program will demonstrate its intentions. 
 
NEUTRAL RESPONSE ON YEMENI GUANTANAMO DETAINEE ASSIGNED 
MILITARY DEFENSE COUNSEL 
 
11. (C) The Ambassador briefed Qirbi on the pending press 
announcement that the Department of Defense assigned a 
military defense counsel to Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni 
citizen detained at Guantanamo.  He explained that although 
Hamdan has not been charge, President Bush has determined 
that his case is subject to President Bush\'s Military Order 
of November 13, 2001.  He further noted that Hamdan was 
assigned counsel in order to prepare a defense, that he is 
presumed innocent until proven guilty, the standard of proof 
is beyond a reasonable doubt and that Hamdan has the right to 
remain silent, to present evidence and call witnesses.  Qirbi 
responded in a matter-of-fact manner and asked a few 
questions to make sure that this information did not pertain 
to pending releases of detainees.  The Ambassador clarified 
that post has no information that any Yemeni has been 
designated for release or transfer.  Qirbi claimed that 
Yemen\'s Ambassador to the United States, Abdulwahab al-Hajri, 
attended White House and FBI meetings and was informed that 
Yemenis were among those to be released.  At the Ambassador\'s 
request, Qirbi said he would try to confirm the source of 
this information from Ambassador al-Hajri. 
 
RUMORS OF EUROPEAN STABBINGS IN SANA\'A RAISE CONCERN 
 
12. (C) The Ambassador asked Qirbi about rumors that a German 
businessman had been stabbed, without apparent political 
motive, in the stomach while walking from the Taj Sheba Hotel 
to Tahrir Square in downtown Sana\'a.  He noted that there are 
multiple stories that might be echoes of the first, but 
seemed to point to incidents involving different European 
nationalities.  (Note: Post has now determined that there 
were three separate incidents, all involving blonde 
Europeans, and issued appropriate warden messages.  Post\'s 
December 20 EAC meeting minutes are reported in reftel a. 
End note.)  Qirbi, who had only returned to Yemen early that 
morning, was surprised at the information, and promised to 
follow up with ROYG security offices. 
 
U.S. CONCERNS WITH YEMEN\'S DEMOCRACY/HUMAN RIGHTS/ICC 
CONFERENCE 
 
13. (C) Qirbi was keen to determine the level of U.S. support 
for the Conference on Democracy and Human Rights, including 
the International Criminal Court, Yemen will co-host with the 
EU in mid-January.  The Ambassador noted that the National 
Democratic Institute (NDI) Director, Robin Madrid, would be 
back in country and that he planned to work with NDI to 
determine practical, positive U.S. involvement.  He noted 
that, to produce constructive results, the EU should, for 
example, provide resources for the national registry project. 
 Qirbi remarked that he is aware that the U.S. has concerns 
with the ICC component of the conference, but sought to 
assure the Ambassador and the U.S. that he intends to focus 
on empowerment in human rights and democracy.  He further 
stated that the Sana\'a Declaration following the Conference 
will \"not subject anyone to intimidation\" and that reviewing 
the proposal for the conference should alleviate U.S. worries 
on ICC.  The Ambassador responded that there is still the 
issue of practical outcomes from the conference, to which the 
FM retorted \"that is why we want you to speak.\" 
 
YEMEN-OMAN COOPERATION ON MARITIME SECURITY 
 
14. (C) Ambassador Bodine noted that Qirbi had inaugurated 
the new Yemeni Embassy building in Muscat and signed an 
agreement with Oman the week before.  The FM said that the 
Oman-Yemen agreement on maritime borders established new 
protocols, particularly on the pursuit of pirate ships, and 
that it addresses the important issues of terrorism and 
fishing.  He agreed with the Ambassador\'s suggestion that 
that Yemen,s hosting of the Spring NESA conference on 
maritime security might provide an opportunity for Omani 
participation. 
 
QIRBI MESSAGE TO WASHINGTON: YEMEN WANTS MORE DEVELOPMENT 
AID, U.S. INVESTMENT AND COOPERATION ON TERRORISM 
 
15. (C) In response to Ambassador Bodine\'s offer to relay 
messages to Washington, Qirbi outlined three key requests: 
(1) more development aid; (2) increased investment by U.S. 
companies; and (3) more cooperation on terrorism, including 
increased transparency.  In addition to a general request for 
more aid, Qirbi said the ROYG just terminated the previous 
contract on the Aden port and is working with the World Bank 
to develop plans for the port\'s management.  He outlined a 
basic plan to have a private investor/company manage the 
port, the container terminal and the Aden airport.  He cited 
interest from Honk Kong and British companies and encouraged 
the U.S. to consider the opportunity.  In the context of 
increased CT cooperation and transparency, Qirbi urged more 
information exchanges and said people dealing with Yemen need 
to better understand the culture and the Yemeni mindset. 
16. (C) Ambassador Bodine stated that the change in port 
management was a positive change and that initiatives such as 
the TIFA would help address the Yemeni request for greater 
investment.  On development and other cooperation, she noted 
that the increase in assistance and cooperation over the past 
two and a half years was remarkable and exemplified our 
understanding of Yemen\'s needs.

His Excellency 
Colin L. Powell 
Secretary of State 
 
SIPDIS 
Of the United States of America 
Washington D.C. 
 
Excellency: 
 
I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency\'s 
note dated December 10, 2003 which reads as follows: 
 
&Excellency: 
 
     I have the honor to refer to recent discussions between 
representatives of the Government of the United States of 
America and the Government of the Republic of Yemen regarding 
the surrender of persons to International Tribunals. 
 
Reaffirming the importance of bringing to justice those 
who commit genocide, crimes against humanity and war 
crimes, 
 
Considering that the Government of the United States of 
America and the Government of the Republic of Yemen have each 
expressed their intention to, where appropriate, investigate 
and prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity, and 
genocide alleged to have been committed by their respective 
officials, employees, military personnel, and nationals, 
 
I have the honor to propose the following arrangement: 
 
1. For the purposes of this arrangement, &persons8 of 
either Party include all nationals of that Party and, for the 
Government of the United States of America, also include 
current and former non-U.S. national U.S. military personnel 
with respect to acts or omissions allegedly committed or 
occurring while they are or were U.S. military personnel. 
 
2. Persons of one Party present in the territory of the 
other shall not, absent the express consent of the first 
Party, 
 
(a) be surrendered or transferred by any means to any 
international tribunal for any purpose, unless such tribunal 
has been established by the United Nations Security Council, 
or 
 
(b) be surrendered or transferred by any means to any other 
entity or third country, or expelled to a third country, for 
the purpose of surrender to or transfer to any international 
tribunal, unless such tribunal has been established by the 
United Nations Security Council. 
 
3. When the Government of the United States of America 
extradites, surrenders, or otherwise transfers a person of 
Yemen to a third country, the Government of the United States 
of America will not agree to the surrender or transfer of 
that person by the third country to any international 
tribunal, unless such tribunal has been 
established by the United Nations Security Council, absent 
the express consent of the Government of the Republic of 
Yemen. 
4. When the Government of the Republic of Yemen extradites, 
surrenders, or otherwise transfers a person of the United 
States of America to a third country, the Government of the 
Republic of Yemen will not agree to the surrender or transfer 
of that person by the third country to any international 
tribunal, unless such tribunal has been established by the 
United Nations Security Council, absent the express consent 
of the Government of the United States of America. 
 
5. This arrangement shall remain in force until one year 
after the date on which one Party notifies the other of its 
intent to terminate the arrangement.  The provisions of this 
arrangement shall continue to apply with respect to any act 
occurring, or any allegation arising, before the effective 
date of termination. 
 
If the proposal set forth herein is acceptable to Government 
of the Republic of Yemen, this note and Your Excellency\'s 
affirmative note in reply shall constitute binding 
obligations under international law between our two 
Governments which shall be effective on the date of Your note.

 1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  Ambassador convened an EAC on December 
23 to discuss the change to Orange Alert and an update on 
recent stabbings of Westerners in Old Sanaa (ref).  EAC 
agreed that while none of the threat information causing the 
change to Orange Alert pointed specifically to Yemen, Embassy 
personnel would maintain vigilant security practices.  The 
Ministry of Interior arrested a suspect in the recent 
stabbings of Westerners on December 20 who has confessed to 
all three stabbings.  No stabbings have occurred since 
December 17.  Post will maintain stringent security 
practices, including Embassy security-escorted visits to the 
Old City until further notice. Key offices and personnel 
represented at the meeting included:  POL/ECON, CONS, RSO, 
MO, FPD, POL/MIL, DAO, OMC, and SOC YEMEN.  End Summary. 
 
------------ 
Orange Alert 
------------ 
 
2.  (C)  Ambassador briefed EAC on the reasons behind the 
change to Orange or \"High\" Alert.  He said that patterns of 
intelligence and a spike in terrorist communications could 
mean attacks abroad as well as in the U.S. in the coming 
weeks.  While listing several countries that warranted 
heightened concern that did not include Yemen, he noted that 
attacks could be anywhere and good security practices must be 
maintained. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  ORCA said that while there is nothing to indicate 
a specific credible threat in Yemen, the takedown of the 
terrorist cell by ROYG authorities in September shows that 
terrorist motivation remains to conduct operations in Yemen. 
He said that while recent captures of wanted terrorists 
significantly dented their ability to fund terrorist actions 
and move weapons, anything could still happen and vigilance 
should be continued. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Alleged Perpetrator of Stabbings in Custody 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  A/RSO briefed EAC on the recent stabbings in Sanaa 
(reftel).  He said that the Ministry of Interior arrested one 
Yemeni male on December 20, who confessed to all three 
stabbings.  The MOI is continuing to investigate to ascertain 
whether others were involved in the incidents.  A/RSO noted 
no stabbings have occurred since December 17. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Post to Maintain Security Posture Despite Arrest 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5.  (C)  EAC members decided to maintain the increased 
security procedures on travel to the Old City for the time 
being, despite the arrest of a stabbing suspect, noting that 
prudence dictates being careful until Post can be more 
certain the threat is eliminated.  RSO has arranged 
security-escorted visits for Embassy personnel and their 
families to include two plain-clothed RSO Surveillance 
Detection (SD) officers to provide surveillance and early 
detection of possible threats.  MOI informed A/RSO that their 
significantly increased police presence in the Old City would 
be able to respond quickly to any incident.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON THE VISIT OF PHIL REEKER, STATE 
DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN-AT-LARGE, TO YEMEN DECEMBER 8-11, 03. 
 
NEA/PPD FOR MQUINN, JKINCANNON, TROBERTS 
 
 
1.   SUMMARY: U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesman Phil 
Reeker visited Yemen during December 8-11.  He held an open 
meeting with the press in Sana\'a December 9th attended by 
journalists and correspondents of local newspapers, 
international news agencies and Arab TV channels including 
Al-Arabiya and Al-Jazira.  The discussion covered issues of 
counter-terrorism, Iraq, the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, 
the road map, and the U.S.-Yemeni security co-operation. 
The visit was covered by a few Yemeni newspapers including 
the most widely-circulated Aden-based Al-Ayyam independent 
daily.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Phil Reeker held an open discussion with Yemeni 
journalists (December 09) giving a \"nutshell approach\" to 
the relationship between U.S. State Department spokesmen and 
media in the U.S.  He discussed how spokesmen work with the 
media and explain U.S. policies.  He told reporters 
attending the discussion that \"Powell\'s one instruction in 
how we spokesmen do our jobs is to always tell the truth.\" 
Journalists were expecting Reeker to comment on U.S.-Yemeni 
relations, U.S.-Yemen counter-terrorism co-operation and al- 
Qaeda in Yemen and questions revolved around these issues. 
Reeker told journalists that the aim of the visit was to 
open up discussion and dialogue with journalists and listen 
to their comments on U.S. policies.  Questions focused on 
U.S. aid to Yemen, and the possible release of any Yemeni 
prisoners from Guantanamo, Iraq and Palestine.  Al-Jazira\'s 
correspondent reiterated Yemen\'s Prime Minister\'s comments 
on October 3rd that the U.S. is making difficult demands on 
Yemen in terms of counter-terrorism while offering little 
aid in return.  Al-Arabiya\'s correspondent referred to the 
question of Palestine and \"the sufferings the Palestinians 
are going through in light of a total U.S. bias to Israel\" 
which he described as \"the main cause that motivates 
terrorists and extremists to commit crimes.\" 
 
3.  Independent English-language Yemen Times bi-weekly 
(12/11) published a report on Reeker\'s visit with a bold 
headline reading: \"Reeker: Fighting terrorism (in Yemen) is 
Yemen\'s primary responsibility.\"  On the Guantanamo 
prisoners\' issue, Yemen Times quoted Reeker as saying that 
\"the U.S. Defense Department and other officials are working 
to quickly resolve the problem of al-Qaeda detainees at 
Guantanamo.\"   \"However\" Yemen Times added \"Reeker 
spotlighted the growing level of cooperation between his 
country and Yemen in fighting terrorism and that the whole 
world should join hands to fight terrorism since al-Qaeda is 
not merely targeting the U.S.\"  Yemen Times also quoted 
Reeker as saying that his visit to the region was part of 
the U.S. Administration\'s efforts to bridge the gap and 
misunderstanding between the U.S. and Arabs. 
 
4.  Aden-based Al-Ayyam independent daily (12/13) published 
an interview with Reeker covering issues on: the U.S. 
initiative on democracy for the Middle East, democracy in 
Yemen, the local council system in Yemen and the U.S. 
policies in the Middle East.  As far as Palestine and the 
road map are concerned, questions indicated that \"the Yemeni 
public bears a sense of dissatisfaction toward the U.S. 
policy with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts\" and 
that \"the road map has become a dead initiative.\"  Some 
questions carried a critical tone to the U.S. for 
\"neglecting\" the problems of Somalia and for not getting 
involved in Somalia as strongly as it does in the Middle 
East. 
 
5.  Pro-Iranian Al-Balagh independent weekly (12/16) 
published a report titled \"former U.S. Spokesman says al- 
Qaeda is regrouping in the Arab Peninsula.\"  The report said 
Reeker has admitted that the risk of al-Qaeda\'s presence in 
the Peninsula is increasing and that they still pose a 
threat to the whole region and not to the U.S. interests 
alone.  \"The statement,\" Al-Balagh added, \"came in reply to 
the al-Balagh reporter\'s question which asked for Reeker\'s 
comments on a recent statement released by al-Qaeda in Yemen 
threatening attacks against U.S. interests in the region.\" 
 
6.  Al-Balagh (12/16) published an op-ed commenting on 
Reeker\'s statement that State Department spokesmen have 
always to tell the truth.  The article commented that \"media 
in the Arab and Muslim world, on the one hand, and the U.S. 
administration on the other, are at variance mainly due to 
the boiling issues of Iraq and Palestine.\"  \"America\" the 
article said \"wants the Arab and Muslim journalists to 
support its mission in Iraq and wants us to shake hands with 
Sharon and carry out Bush\'s democracy in our countries, 
while forgetting that it (the U.S.) has marginalized 
international laws with its rockets and troops in Iraq.\" 
The article concluded that \"we hope that Reeker would tell 
the truth and convey our messages and concerns over Iraq and 
Palestine to the U.S. Administration as he had promised.\" 
 
7.  A journalist from Armed Forces weekly 26 September 
newspaper conducted an interview with Reeker December 11th 
covering issues on Yemen\'s co-operation with the U.S.-led 
international counter-terrorism campaign, Iraq and 
Palestine.  The interview was supposed to come out Thursday, 
December 17th, but the interviewer said it will be published 
in the next week or two.

DELIVERED TO YEMEN\'S CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY 
 
REF: 03 STATE 348468 
 
 1. (sbu) Pol/Econ Chief and Econoff delivered texts of three 
aviation emergency amendments provided in reftel to Hamed 
Ahmed Farag, Chairman of Yemen\'s Civil Aviation and 
Meteorological Authority (CAMA), Mohammed al-Madhagi, CAMA 
Advisor and Chief of the Technical Advisory Bureau.  Noting 
that Yemen does not currently have an air marshal program, 
Pol/Econ Chief asked if Yemen would be able to provide 
\"armed, trained, government law enforcement officers\" if 
warranted by circumstances or required by TSA.  Officials did 
not provide a clear answer, but al-Madhagi noted that Yemen 
had a sky marshal program more than ten years ago that was 
discontinued because of safety concerns, i.e., a passenger 
could take a marshal\'s weapon and use it to hijack the plane. 
 He asked if the additional security requirements were an 
ICAO or U.S. standard.  Upon learning it was a U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security requirement, he opined the 
world will not accept the requirement because of the 
perceived danger of armed officers on flights. 
 
2. (sbu) Comment: There are currently no direct flights from 
Yemen, by domestic or international carriers, to, from or 
over the United States, which greatly reduces the likelihood 
that the emergency amendments would ever need to be enforced 
with CAMA\'s cooperation.  CAMA officials received the 
information, but seemed skeptical about the law\'s 
effectiveness.  End comment.

COMMUNICATION TRAINING & QUALIFYING INSTITUTION 
 
REF: A) STATE 187026 B) SANAA 5295 
 
1.   The  Communication Training & Qualifying Institution 
(CTQI)   has   concluded  its  training  project   titled 
\"Advocacy  and  Media  Campaign.\"  Conducted  from  04-15 
October  2003  for 20 participants from ten NGOs  working 
with women and human rights issues on how to use media to 
prepare  and  produce media based awareness and  advocacy 
campaigns. 
 
2.   The  administrative part of the training did not  go 
well as the head of the project was unable to be involved 
thereby  making  information about the training  location 
not   clear  to  some  participants.  Participants   also 
complained  that  one  of  the  trainers  was  not   well 
qualified  for  the training and they were  not  learning 
much  from her. PAS attended one of the training sessions 
and    talked   to   the   training   coordinator   about 
participants\' complaints. The coordinator said they would 
look into changing the trainer. 
 
3.   The second trainer was very qualified and had a  lot 
of  experience  as the head of the Civic  Cultural  Media 
Center   which   designs  and  produces  media   campaign 
packages.  He  was  very effective in  teaching  trainees 
methods  of a successful advocacy campaign. Trainees  got 
the  opportunity  to  make their  own  advocacy  campaign 
programs  using  TV,  Radio and newspapers.  The  trainer 
evaluated  the  programs  and  guided  trainees  on  best 
practices in this field. 
 
4.   The Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Media,  head 
of  ICQT,  PAO and PAS attended the concluding  ceremony. 
Trainees   made  presentations  of  the  advocacy   media 
campaign projects they worked on during the training. PAO 
delivered a remark emphasizing the importance of advocacy 
in  civil  society work as an effective  tool  to  change 
attitudes and bring awareness among society. 
PAO  also distributed the graduation certificates for the 
trainees. 
 
5.  Outcome: Strengths 
 
       The  training\'s topic found positive interest from 
     the NGOs participating in the training, as it will help 
     them advocate for their projects reaching larger segments 
     of audience. 
 
      CTQI was very responsive to suggestions and ideas to 
     improve the training administration and change one of the 
     trainers  according  to  the  participants\'   strong 
     suggestions. 
 
       Training  was practical and effective in  teaching 
     trainees campaign methods. 
 
6.  Weaknesses: 
 
       Some trainees missed the first day of training, as 
     they did not receive clear information of the training 
     location place from CTQI. 
 
      One trainee did not receive a certificate, as he was 
     not consistent with his attendance. 
 
        The  financial  report showed a transfer  of  one 
     budget item to another item without notification  of 
     embassy personnel. PAS asked CTQI head to follow up the 
     issue and explain reasons for such action.

4.    The   training  was  especially  useful  to   those 
participants  coming  from Al-Baida governorate,  a  very 
tribal   area   where  NGO  work  is  very  limited   and 
inexperienced.  These participants learned  the  most  as 
this was the first training they ever attend which helped 
them  to  identify weakness areas within their NGO\'s  and 
work  on  improving plans based on what they have learned 
at the workshop. 
 
5.   At  the  end  of  the workshop,  an  evaluation  was 
distributed  to the participants to evaluate the  program 
as a whole. 
 
 
6.  Outcome: Strengths 
 
      Workshop facilities, administration, and management 
     were very efficient. 
 
       Trainers were good communicators and knowledgeable 
     about the subject. 
 
       Training  used participatory methods  to  maximize 
     learning benefits. 
 
7.  Weaknesses: 
 
       Follow  up  of  participants\' progress  after  the 
     completion of the workshop to measure the improvement was 
     not consistent. 
 
       Female  participants were coy  and  needed  to  be 
     encouraged consistently to speak out.

SUBJECT: FINAL REPORT: DEMOCRACY SMALL GRANT FOR THE 
COMBATING CHILD WORK ASSOCIATION 
 
REF: A) STATE 187026 B) SANAA 5295 
 
1.   The  Combating Child Work Association has  concluded 
its  training  project titled \"Awareness-Raising  Program 
Among  the  Working Children\'s Community\". The  awareness 
sessions  were conducted from 20 August until 22 December 
03. 
 
2.   PAO  and  PAS attended the opening ceremony  of  the 
project in Aden city.  PAO\'s remark focused on the  NGO\'s 
important  work  to educate the society  of  child  labor 
risks  to  the  children and the society  as  whole.  PAO 
explained that children get pulled out of schools to work 
in  low-wage  jobs and at the same time  are  exposed  to 
various  kinds of harassments and physical  abuse.  Above 
all  these  children loose the opportunity  of  a  bright 
future when they have no education. 
 
3.   PAS  traveled  to Aden to follow  up  the  project\'s 
activities  and  progress. PAS attended  three  awareness 
sessions  in  poverty  stricken  communities.  The  first 
session  was  the meeting of the speakers and specialists 
to  discuss the program\'s plan, methodology and progress. 
Participants  in this session included the head  of  Aden 
University who offered his support for the project. 
 
4.  PAS attended the second activity of the program where 
the actual awareness session was conducted at a very poor 
populated  targeted  area within Aden  city  where  child 
labor  is  common.  The speakers in the session addressed 
the  current situation of working children and  the  risk 
they  are  exposed  to during their work.   The  speakers 
encouraged parents to keep their children in schools  for 
a  better  future and better life.  Parents talked  about 
difficulties  they face and reasons why they  pull  their 
children out of school and force them to work. One of the 
main reasons for child labor is poverty. 
 
5.   From the audience, a mother of about 50 years  stood 
up  to speak about her commitment to educate her children 
and  the  daily  financial struggle she went  through  to 
provide  food for her children in order to keep  them  in 
school and educate them for the future. 
 
6.   The  session was able to engage parents in  thinking 
about  their  children\'s future, but the reality  of  the 
poverty and the need for food and shelter remain  one  of 
the  biggest  hindering factors for changing the  current 
situation of child labor. 
 
7.   PAS  also  attended a third awareness session  where 
most  of  the  audiences were mothers  who  came  to  the 
session with many questions and eager desire for help. In 
this  session, it was obvious to the awareness  committee 
that the magnitude of the problem is much larger than the 
sincere,  yet  small  efforts of the  project.  The  weak 
education   system,  the  practice   of   some   damaging 
traditional   beliefs,   and  the   stagnant   economical 
situation are all factors in the making of this problem. 
 
8.   One  of  the main questions that resulted from  this 
project  is  how  effective the awareness sessions  were? 
Were there measurable results? What are they? 
 
9.    The awareness committee realizes that the awareness 
sessions  provided this poor society  a  platform  to  be 
heard, to offer them guidance and possible help. However, 
they  also realize that awareness sessions are not enough 
to  make a difference and that their future project  must 
have measurable results and focused goals.

SUBJECT: FINAL REPORT: DEMOCRACY SMALL GRANT FOR Al- 
MARA\'WA SOCIAL AND HELATH ASSOCIATION 
 
REF: A) STATE 187026 B) SANAA 5295 
 
1.    Al-Mara\'wa   Social  and  Health  Association   has 
concluded its project titled \"Girls\' Education: Awareness 
and  Advocacy  Program\".  The Association  conducted  two 
workshops   in  ten  selected  rural  areas  with   dense 
population in Al-Marawa district in accordance  with  the 
terms of their Democracy Small Grant. 
 
2.   PAO  and  PAS attended the opening ceremony  of  the 
first    workshop   conducted   on   August    13,    03. 
Representatives  from the Ministry  of  Education,  local 
council,  district  mangers, social figures  and  parents 
attended the opening session. 
 
3.   PAS  made a monitoring visit and met with the  NGO\'s 
head  in  Hodida Governorate who explained the  project\'s 
progress  in the selected villages. The mobile  awareness 
workshops were moving from one village to another to talk 
to   parents,  and  social  leaders  encouraging   girl\'s 
education and discussing existing obstacles in the  rural 
areas. 
 
4.   PAS  traveled  with the NGO\'s  head  to  Al-Ashaarya 
village  to  attend  an awareness  session.  Two  of  the 
speakers  at  the  session were a  member  of  the  local 
council  in the district and the General Manager  of  the 
Education  Office. The Education General  Manager  talked 
about  the importance of girl\'s education and the efforts 
of  the  Education Office in the area to  provide  female 
teachers  and  locate girl schools in the  district.  The 
audiences  were parents and leaders in the community  who 
discussed  obstacles to girls\' education in the  district 
and ways to move forward. 
 
5.   PAS observation on the awareness session is that  it 
was  very  necessary  but it has  little  effect  on  the 
current  reality.  From the debates in the  session,  PAS 
sensed  that  these  communities  feel  so  isolated  and 
abandoned and their motivation and enthusiasm is at a low 
level.  So even though the awareness session was  a  good 
opportunity  to  engage parents in a healthy  debate  and 
help them realize the importance of girls education, more 
collective  efforts need to be made in terms of  building 
girls  schools and providing female teachers in order  to 
increase girls enrollment in schools. 
 
6.  Outcome: Strengths 
 
      Workshops reached the selected villages and received 
     a positive welcome from the community. 
 
         Parents   expressed   their   enthusiasm   about 
     participating in awareness programs in rural areas where 
     it is much needed. 
 
       Participants acknowledged their dire need for more 
     workshops  at  the governorate levels as  they  gain 
     knowledge and touch upon very important and  current 
     issues facing women. 
 
7.  Weaknesses: 
 
       The awareness program was much needed in the rural 
     areas where little efforts are made to increase girls\' 
     enrollment in schools; however, the program has little 
     impact for the long term. The NGO\'s effort to tackle the 
     issue alone shows a good commitment, yet the magnitude of 
     the  problem  needs serious collective efforts  from 
     government, community and the civil society. 
 
      Some of the selected speakers were adequate but not 
     engaging; therefore some sessions were not  as  well 
     attended as others. 
 
      In some of the visited districts, there seemed to be 
     a  feeling of helplessness and passiveness among the 
     community, so even though they attended the awareness 
     session, they were skeptical of any changes happening in 
     their community.

SUBJECT: FINAL REPORT: DEMOCRACY SMALL GRANT FOR THE 
HANDICAP REHABILITATION SOCIETY FOR CHILDREN 
 
REF: A) STATE 187026 B) SANAA 5295 
 
1.   The Handicap Rehabilitation Society for Children has 
concluded  its  awareness mobile sessions project  titled 
\"Inclusion of Disabled Children in Public Schools\". 
 
2.    The   PAO   and   PAS  attended   the   Handicapped 
Rehabilitation Society opening ceremony for  its  project 
\"Inclusion  of  Disabled Children in Public  Schools\"  in 
Aden  city.  This  project worked on  bringing  awareness 
among  school children and educators about the rights  of 
all  children  to education.  In his remark,  PAO  Balian 
talked  about disabled children rights and  the  need  to 
include them as full participating members of society. 
 
3.   PAO  and  PAS attended three awareness  sessions  in 
three schools in Aden. The first awareness session was in 
a  girls\' high school. We met with the school manger  who 
was  happy  that  such activity is taking  place  in  her 
school.  About forty girls attended the awareness session 
which started with one of the NGO trainers speaking about 
the  meaning  of  disability. The  speaker  talked  about 
disabled  children and the need to respect them as  human 
beings  capable of learning and participating in society. 
The  speaker also distributed stories written by disabled 
children about their struggles to be included in society. 
Girls and boys of different ages wrote the stories,  some 
wrote  about  their  success in overcoming  struggles  in 
their  life as handicapped children and some wrote  about 
their  continuing  struggle to gain respect  among  their 
family   and   peers.  The  stories  were   painful   yet 
courageous. 
 
4.   Students  read three stories and had the opportunity 
to comment about their impressions. They shared their own 
stories  of  handicapped children in their  neighborhood, 
among their families and in the streets. 
 
At the end of the session, the speaker distributed papers 
and  colors for the girls to draw pictures of the session 
subject. 
The  drawings were collected and will be added to  a  new 
printout along with the handicapped children stories. 
 
5.  The observation of the PAO and PAS of the session was 
very  good  in  terms  of materials  used,  however,  the 
speaker  was not using a participatory approach  and  was 
not well organized in her thoughts. 
 
6.   PAO  and PAS sat with the speaker and the  NGO  head 
after  the  session  and suggested better  participatory, 
engaging methods for her to use in her next session which 
was the same day. 
 
7.   The speaker did a much better job in her second  and 
third  sessions where she used more interactive dialogue. 
Student  response was much more positive than  the  first 
session. 
 
8.   The  overall  result of the  project  was  good.  It 
enhances children\'s knowledge of their handicapped  peers 
and makes them aware of the struggles these children face 
in  their  daily life.  This project can be considered  a 
good  civic education initiative that can be  used  on  a 
larger scale in schools.

SUBJECT: REGIONAL CONFERENCE ON DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) 
 
REF: A. 03 SANAA 2754 
 
     B. 03 SANAA 2839 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (U)  Summary and Comment:  The Sanaa Inter-Governmental 
Regional Conference on Democracy, Human Rights and the Role 
of the International Criminal Court was held January 10-12, 
sponsored by No Peace Without Justice (an EU-affiliated NGO), 
the ROYG, the European Union and several European governments 
and Canada.  Participants included a wide variety of 
government and civil society representatives from the Middle 
East and beyond.  The U.S. was represented by the Ambassador 
and kept a low profile because of the Conference\'s ICC 
component.  The opportunity to discuss ideas of democracy and 
human rights regionally and a  Declaration establishing a set 
of principles on democracy, human rights and the rule of law 
present a step in the right direction for democratic 
advancement.  However, the rhetoric far exceeded practical 
commitments to real democratic change.  End Summary and 
Comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Background on Conference: Organizers, Goals, Participants 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2.  (U)  The Conference was the brainchild of No Peace 
Without Justice (NPWJ) founder Emma Bonino, a former European 
Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs who has close personal 
ties to Yemen.  NPWJ organized several conferences outside 
the Middle East on the International Criminal Court (ICC) and 
was looking for a host in the region.  Several months ago, 
Bonino approached the ROYG Minister of Human Rights Amat 
al-Alim al-Suswa.  The Minister told Pol/Econ Deputy that she 
expressed reservations on the irony of the ROYG hosting a 
conference to convince themselves and fellow governments to 
ratify the Rome Statute (ICC).  However, ultimately the ROYG 
expanded the aims of the Conference to include democracy and 
human rights and agreed to host it. 
 
3.  (C)  The Conference was organized by NPWJ and the ROYG, 
and sponsored by the European Union, Canada, Germany, France, 
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom, 
UNDP and the Open Society Institute.  Participants included 
Arab and Islamic governments (including Iraqi GC Minister of 
Human Rights and an Afghani delegation), neighboring African 
states, the Arab League, the United Nations, the United 
States and European governments and civil society activists 
from the region and the West.  It was organized into plenary 
sessions and smaller \"thematic sessions\" on:  the ICC; 
Democracy and Human Rights; and the Role of Civil Society in 
Democracy, Human Rights and the Rule of Law.  Note:  Because 
of the Conference\'s ICC component and originally unclear 
aims, the USG delegation was low-key and led by the 
Ambassador.  Prominent U.S. NGO representatives included 
participants from the National Democratic Institute and 
Partners for Democratic Change.  The DCM delivered remarks 
during the Democracy and Human Rights thematic session on the 
importance of democracy, President Bush\'s vision as outlined 
in his November 6 speech, the Middle East Partnership 
Initiative and practical steps needed to advance democracy. 
End Note. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Sanaa Declaration Calls For 
Furthering Democracy and Human Rights in the Arab World; 
ICC Ratification Downplayed 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
4.  (U)  The \"Sanaa Declaration on Democracy, Human Rights 
and the Role of the International Criminal Court\" outlines 12 
principles on democracy, human rights and the rule of law, 
including specific references to the importance of 
representative institutions, civil society, effective 
judicial systems, combating corruption and free and 
independent media.  The participants agreed to 10 specific 
points, including to \"work seriously\" to fulfill the 12 
principles, empower women, ensure equality, establish a free 
and independent judiciary and establish an Arab Democratic 
Dialogue Forum to continue the dialogue on democracy and 
human rights.  Despite the original aims of the Conference to 
promote ratification of the ICC, the ICC was mentioned only 
once in the Declaration as one avenue to strengthen 
international judicial institutions. 
 
5.  (C)  The U.S. delegation did not participate in the 
closed-session Declaration negotiations, which were attended 
by the regional government participants and the organizing 
European countries.  The U.S. delegation did not/not 
officially attest to the Declaration because of reservations 
to its ICC component and an oblique reference to \"occupation\" 
being \"contrary to international law.\"  Before viewing the 
final version of the Declaration which contained the new 
occupation language, the Embassy officially noted its 
reservations over the ICC in a brief letter.  A UNDP contact 
not inside the discussions told Pol/Econ Deputy that he 
believed the ICC language was downplayed primarily because of 
reservations from Saudi Arabia, which has not signed or 
ratified the Rome Statute. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Some Controversy Over Participants; Poor Organization 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6.  (U)  The Conference attempted to combine government and 
non-government participants to foster a dialogue during the 
conference.  Several governmental delegations did not react 
well to some of the non-governmental participants invited to 
the Conference.  For example, the Egyptian government 
delegation almost did not attend and ultimately became more 
low-level with the participation of Saad Eddin Ibrahim. 
According to conference organizers, the Iranian delegation 
threatened not to attend should 2003 Nobel Prize winner 
Shirin Ebadi attend.  Note: She did not attend. End Note. 
Yemeni NGO leaders, opposition parties and journalists also 
complained of late invitations (the parties were invited 
three days before the event) and denial of participation of 
specific NGOs and journalists because of political reasons. 
 
7.  (U)  The Conference was organized in less than three 
months, and its specific makeup and design was not finalized 
until mid-December.  Participants were added until the last 
minute, almost doubling the original estimate of participants 
to more than 800.  Comment:  This disorganization caused some 
problems during the Conference, particularly in terms of 
logistics.  However, several observers expressed surprise 
that the Conference went as well as it did.  End Comment. 
 
---------------------------- 
Good Rhetoric But What Next? 
---------------------------- 
 
8.  (U)  In addition to the Declaration, Conference speeches 
and interventions were full of language praising human rights 
and democracy.  For example, a speech from a Saudi Arabia 
government participant noted KSA commitment to move on the 
democratic path, albeit at a measured pace.  ROYG President 
Saleh -- who invested the conference with high-level support 
by personally presiding over the opening plenary and closing 
ceremony -- called democracy a \"rescue ship\" for autocratic 
governments. 
 
9.  (C)  Comment:  The interventions of several delegations 
from autocratic countries praising democracy and human rights 
were somewhat ironic. e.g., Iran\'s recent denial of 
participation from reform candidates.  The Conference 
contained few practical or effective steps to move the region 
towards democracy and human rights beyond dialogue.  However, 
as the first of Conference of its kind in the region, the 
event and its Declaration represent an Arab advance in the 
direction of meaningful principles on democracy and human 
rights.  The Conference did not visibly advance regional 
support for the ICC.  End Comment.

Classified By: RSO Tim Laas, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened a core 
Emergency Action Committee on 1/14 to discuss a shooting 
incident in Aden involving Yemeni security personnel and 
SOC/Yemen personnel.  EAC members agreed, following initial 
investigation of the incident and apology offered to the 
Ambassador by the commander of Yemen\'s Special Forces, that 
the incident: (a) did not indicate a heightened threat for 
Amcits in Aden and (b) did not appear to justify cancellation 
of SOC/Yemen training for Yemeni security elements in Aden 
scheduled later this week.  EAC members attending the meeting 
included AMB, DCM, RSO, MO, POL/ECON, POL/MIL, DAO, OMC, and 
SOC/Yemen. 
 
2.  (C)  An Emergency Action Committee meeting was convened 
at 1700 hours on 01/14/2004 to review a security incident 
which occurred that same day at approximately 1445 hours, 
when two members of the SOC/Yemen training unit were shot at 
in Aden while traveling in a three-vehicle convoy consisting 
of two rental vehicles and a Yemeni military security 
vehicle.  An initial investigation by Embassy Force 
Protection Units in Aden determined that the vehicles in the 
attacking motorcade contained uniformed members of Yemen\'s 
elite Presidential Guard, and that BG Ahmed Ali 
Saleh--commander of the Yemeni Special Forces (YSOF) and a 
son of President Saleh---was a passenger in the lead vehicle. 
 Both motorcades stopped after the shooting and the 
Presidential Guard stated that they viewed the SOC/Yemen 
motorcade as a possible threat because it did not immediately 
pull over to the side of the road, and had Yemeni security 
personnel (actually YSOF personnel) in plainclothes who were 
carrying arms. 
 
3.  (C)  During the EAC meeting the Ambassador advised 
committee members that BG Ahmed Ali Saleh, had called to 
apologize and offer an explanation of the event. BG Saleh 
claimed that due to the fact that the armed YSOF military 
escorts were not properly dressed and therefore were not 
easily identifiable by the Presidential Guards, they were 
perceived as a threat.  Saleh also relayed to the Ambassador 
that the ROYG would determine the cause of the error and take 
measures to prevent any reoccurrence of this kind. 
 
4.  (C)  The EAC decided that this was not a terrorist 
attack, and it was agreed that Americans need not be warned 
against travel to Aden.  The EAC also determined that 1) The 
threat to Americans has not increased 2) Yemeni government 
officials have reacted in an appropriate and timely manner to 
this incident, and 3) That joint training exercises in Aden 
between American and Yemeni military units scheduled for 
later this week should continue as planned. 
 
5.  (C)  The Regional Security Office is in contact with the 
Ministry of Interior regarding ROYG\'s ongoing investigation 
of the incident, which will include a meeting of all 
concerned U.S. and Yemeni organizations on the morning of 
January 15th.  Members of the DAO, FPD, and SOC/Yemen will 
conduct further inquires into the matter through liaison with 
members of the Yemeni security apparatus, and will 
participate actively in the ROYG investigation.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR,S 1/19 MEETING WITH SHEIKH AL-AHMAR: 
ZINDANI, OPPOSITION CONTACTS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, reasons 1.5 (b), (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  In a 1/19 meeting with Ambassador, Sheikh 
al-Ahmar appealed for more high-level contact with the 
Embassy and stoutly defended the bona fides of Sheikh Zindani 
and al-Iman University which the Ambassador disputed.  The 
Islah leader,s unusually conciliatory approach appears 
calculated to forestall the long-pending U.S. designation of 
Zindani as engaged in terrorist financing.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, called on Parliament 
Speaker Sheikh Abdullah al-Ahmar on January 19 at the 
latter,s invitation.  Ahmar, who also heads the Islah Party, 
had a two-part agenda to discuss with Ambassador.  After 
opening discussion of Yemen,s economy and potential for 
increased international investment and tourism, Ahmar 
explained at some length his desire for increased high-level 
contact between Islah and Embassy Sanaa -- especially 
personal contact between himself and Ambassador.  He reviewed 
his own status as head of a major tribal coalition, in 
addition to his party and Parliamentary roles, noting that he 
represented the views of a broad sector of the Yemeni 
population.  Ahmar stressed that dialogue between the Embassy 
and Islah could help control rumors, dispel misinformation 
and avoid misunderstanding.  Finally, Ahmar touted his role 
in buttressing Yemen,s security and stability, including by 
reining in mosque preachers and young Islahis. 
 
3. (C) Ambassador welcomed the prospect of increased dialogue 
with Islah and its leader, pointing out that the Embassy had 
long maintained regular working level contact with Islah 
officials.  He underscored the Embassy,s commitment to 
dialogue with Parliament and with all parties, including the 
opposition. 
 
4. (C) Ahmar,s second focus was on al-Iman University and 
its head, Sheikh Abdul Majid Zindani.  Sheikh al-Ahmar said 
he knew the USG had \"question marks\" regarding Zindani, and 
asserted that Zindani is a reasonable, responsible man and 
that al-Iman is a normal educational institution and not 
linked to extremism.  The Ambassador disagreed and noted that 
ROYG security authorities had found that numerous extremist 
suspects had links with al-Iman University and questions 
about its status are thus justified.  Similarly, questions 
about Zindani are well founded, the Ambassador insisted. 
Ahmar reiterated that Islah felt a responsibility for Zindani 
and al-Iman University, and asked that the Ambassador discuss 
with him any adverse information the USG might receive on 
either.  The Sheikh concluded that dialogue could dispel 
misunderstanding.  The Ambassador reiterated a willingness 
for contacts with Islah as an opposition party, but pointedly 
declined to enter into a dialog on Zindani or al-Iman 
University. 
 
5. (C) Comment: Ahmar,s pitch on behalf of Sheikh Zindani 
may be an attempt to pre-empt the long-pending U.S. 
designation of Zindani (and/or institutions linked to him) as 
engaged in terrorist financing.  It is notable that Ahmar 
declined to make any similar pitch on behalf of Sheikh 
Mohamed Ali Hassan al-Moayed, who awaits trial in the United 
States after extradition from Germany.  End comment.

1. (c) Summary: Pol/Econ Chief, Counter-terrorism Coordinator 
and Political Specialist (as translator) met with Judge 
Hamoud al-Hitar,  leading cleric of the ROYG committee 
responsible for the dialogue with security detainees, on 
February 9.  Concerning the dialogue, al-Hitar said that 
there are fewer than 30 detainees recommended for release, 
and that the rest are facing criminal prosecution, including 
those suspected in the bombings of the USS Cole and French 
tanker Limburg  He stated that information from detained 
al-Qaida member Abu Asim al-Makki has led to a small number 
of arrests and suggested the possibility of extraditions, if 
\"such an action would strengthen U.S.-Yemeni relations.\" 
Al-Hitar also confirmed that there is a very high likelihood 
that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will be ratified 
by Parliament soon.  While he did not provide specific 
proposals for follow-up from the January HR/Democracy/ICC 
conference (ref b), al-Hitar  believes that democracy is a 
\"weapon\" to change regimes from within and that a dialogue on 
democracy is the way to restore U.S.-Islamic relations. 
Because of concerns that external factors would lead to an 
unpalatable outcome, he recommended indefinite postponement 
of a proposed conference on moderation of religious messages 
to be hosted by Yemen\'s Ministry of Awqaf (ref a).  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Fewer Than 30 Recommended for Release; 
Remaining Detainees Face Criminal Charges 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (c) On the status of the dialogue, Judge al-Hitar said 
that there are fewer than 30 detainees remaining that have 
been recommended for release by the group, and that the rest 
are slated for criminal prosecution.  He said that it is not 
in the interests of either the U.S. or Yemen to imprison 
innocent individuals, but that this standard certainly \"did 
not apply to suspects in the Cole or Limburg bombings,\" and 
cited our mutual interest in moving the prosecutions of these 
suspects forward, which he believes will have a deterrent 
effect.  Al-Hitar said he recommended that the last group of 
less than 30 be let go over the Eid-al-Ahda holiday (February 
1-3), but claims that the security forces have concerns that 
have delayed the process.  When asked about the timing of 
releases, al-Hitar said that it was dependent on the 
particular number of prisoners in detention at any one time, 
and not on a pre-determined holiday schedule.  (Note: the 
first two groups were released over or just after Ramadan in 
2002 and 2003.  End note). 
 
3. (c) Al-Hitar said that elements of the parliamentary 
opposition have used the detainee issue, and ROYG resistance 
to releases, to pursue their own agenda by attempting to show 
a tie between the regime and the \"extremist\" detainees -- 
which they believe has a deleterious effect on the regime\'s 
reputation.  He also confirmed that security forces had 
recently arrested a small number of suspects based on 
information developed from detained Al-Qaida member Abu Asim 
al-Makki. 
 
4. (c) When asked if he had participated in the dialogue on 
Constitutional issues related to extradition for criminal 
cases, al-Hitar claimed that he was out of the country. 
However, he counseled \"patience\" on the issue because: (1) 
the ROYG needs to be very sensitive to public 
opinion/reaction, e.g., harsh criticisms of the government 
because of the 2002 al-Harithi incident accompanied by 
accusations from the opposition that it had abandoned its 
sovereignty; and (2) the ROYG and the opposition are both 
committed and very close to ratifying membership in the ICC, 
which would automatically lead to constitutional amendments. 
 
5. (c) On the extradition issue, al-Hitar said that if there 
is a \"possibility that such an action would strengthen 
U.S.-Yemeni relations, then it would certainly be 
considered,\" but the ROYG would need to be very sensitive to 
ensure that such an action would not provide ammunition to 
the political opposition/extremists.  Comment:  Along with 
Foreign Minister Qirbi\'s comments in a February 5 Al-Jazeera 
interview on Jaber al-Banna that \"the question should be 
whether the Yemeni law applies to him as a Yemeni or as a 
Yemeni who abandoned his Yemeni citizenship,\" this seems to 
constitute a softening from the blanket denial from various 
sources that stated extradition was impossible due to 
constitutional prohibitions.  End comment. 
 
 
5. (c) At the invitation of the UK government, Al-Hitar is 
likely to be traveling to the UK later this month to discuss 
the dialogue process.  He welcomed the opportunity to meet 
with U.S. visitors to Yemen to discuss the issue, and hinted 
several times that he would welcome an invite to travel to 
the U.S., even mentioning that his 1995 trip to the U.S. (on 
an IVP program) changed both his thinking and personal 
behaviors in a positive way. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Democratic Dialogue Will Restore U.S.-Islamic Relations 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
6. (c) Asked about follow-up from the recent HR/Democracy/ICC 
Conference hosted by the ROYG (ref b), al-Hitar said that he 
would like to see a U.S. strategy for the Middle East based 
on the outcome of the January meeting.  He commented that 
Yemen is \"competing\" for a role in the region, and that 
democracy is its only card.  He clarified that the conference 
was put forward in the context of creating a \"slow-burn\" or 
simmering effect for democratic dialogue and reforms, and 
that democracy can be used as a \"weapon\" to change regimes 
from within countries.  He stated several times during the 
meeting that a dialogue on democracy is the primary way to 
build/restore U.S.-Islamic relations. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Conference on Moderate Preaching Postponed Indefinitely 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
7. (c) On the proposed Ministry of Awqaf (Endowments and 
Religious Guidance) conference on religious moderation (ref 
a), al-Hitar said that a cabinet-level committee has already 
prepared a program and proposed guest list for the event, but 
that over Ramadan he counseled against going forward because 
of concerns that Iraq would dominate the discussion.  He 
characterized the conference as a \"double-edged sword,\" 
saying that although it is aimed at moderating religious 
messages, it could result in a more hard-line message.  He 
believes things are too \"emotional\" right now and that 
outside influences (e.g., Afghanistan, Iraq) would be too 
strong for participants to ignore.

2. (u) Begin Text: 
 
Yemen 
 
Although events in 2003 reflect improvement in its human 
rights record, Yemen has a history of problems in both the 
political and social sphere, including citizens\' limited 
ability to change the government, a weak judiciary, human 
rights abuses, and laws limiting freedom of expression.  The 
2003-2004 U.S. human rights and democracy strategy for Yemen 
addresses the need for the Government to continue to 
strengthen its human rights record, continue to enact social 
reforms, improve problems within the judiciary, and further 
the process of democratic development.  The United States 
continued several long-term projects addressing these issues, 
including programs aimed at strengthening Yemen\'s political 
parties, improving election administration, increasing voter 
participation, fostering civil society and improving the 
country\'s human rights record. 
 
The Defense Department Counter-Terrorism Fellowship funds a 
training program in the United States for Yemeni military 
officers, one aim of which is to convey the importance of 
respecting human rights.  This program is highly successful 
in Yemen and is ongoing. 
 
Yemen continued a long-term program of judicial reform, in an 
attempt to counter the numerous problems within the 
judiciary.  Yemen\'s Minister of Justice and other jurists 
participated actively in the Middle East Partnership 
Initiative\'s Arab Judicial Forum.  The courts are only 
nominally independent and have been plagued by corruption, 
executive branch interference, and the failure of authorities 
to enforce rulings. 
 
In addition to political reforms, the United States has been 
urging the Government of Yemen to enact social reforms and 
encourage respect for human rights. The United States engages 
frequently with the Government\'s Ministry of Human Rights to 
improve the Government\'s ability and willingness to redress 
specific human rights abuses.  The Embassy continued to 
support 17 separate NGO projects in 2003.  Two programs to 
provide training and capacity building to NGOs targeted rural 
areas where civil society remains nascent. Another project 
raised awareness of the struggles and rights of disabled 
children in public schools to combat discrimination.  Several 
projects aimed to improve women\'s rights.  Yemeni women have 
traditionally been politically and socially marginalized, 
with limited political representation in parliament or local 
councils despite high voter participation, restricted access 
to healthcare and education, as well as widespread reports of 
domestic abuse, and some instances of female genital 
mutilation.  Under a USDA program, the Embassy established a 
project to build and furnish new primary schools for girls in 
isolated rural areas in order to give girls access to modern 
education and to facilitate their inclusion within society. A 
$2 million MEPI-funded program aims to address the 67% 
illiteracy rate among women and girls. 
 
USAID reopened its offices in Yemen in 2003.  USAID is 
promoting a social/economic development program to address 
some fundamental human issues facing the Government of Yemen 
and its people, including:  health; basic education and 
literacy; food security and employment in a predominantly 
agricultural society; and strengthening democratic 
institutions. 
 
In 2003, International Visitor Programs brought NGO 
activists, government officials and other leaders to the 
United States to gain skills and knowledge in such areas as 
youth leadership, women\'s leadership in civil society and the 
public and private sector and community service and NGOs. 
 
A multi-year Department of Labor-supported program 
administered through the International Labor Organization 
continued combating the problem of street child labor in 2003. 
 
Although the citizens of Yemen still have limited ability to 
change their Government, significant strides have been made 
to address problems plaguing the electoral system, including 
poorly-organized voter registration resulting in 
disenfranchisement, inadequate election day administration 
and fraud prevention, and inequitable political party 
participation.   The United States funded programs by the 
National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the International 
Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) to strengthen Yemen\'s 
multi-party system.  They worked directly with political 
activists to improve future elections by focusing on 
increasing women\'s political participation and 
representation, improving voter registration, particularly 
among women, and strengthening election day administration. 
 
NDI continued a U.S.-funded program to improve the ability of 
local councils to represent the citizens through a better 
understanding of the law governing local councils.  The April 
2003 national parliamentary elections were generally 
considered to have been a significant improvement over 
previous elections, with good marks for organization, 
participation and security.  For example, women\'s 
registration and participation in the election increased by 
more than 40% to reach more than 75% of eligible women voters 
participating.  The Ambassador, embassy staffers, and 
election observers from IFES, NDI, the European Union and the 
UN were present at polling places throughout the country to 
observe the elections. 
 
In 2004, the Embassy will increase programming designed to 
strengthen democratic institutions, decentralize authority 
and resource management, and expand opportunities for civil 
society in decision-making. 
 
Regionally, the U.S. supported the al-Khalij Forum For 
Democratic Political Action, held in Sanaa in October 2003. 
It was the third such forum in the region, which brought 
together democratic activists from the Gulf and Iraq to 
improve their advocacy skills in fostering political reform 
in the region.

Classified By: Charge d\' Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer, for 
reasons 1.5 (a), (b) and (d) 
 
1. (s) Summary/comment: DCM and Acting Defense Attach 
delivered reftel b demarche and diplomatic note to Major 
General Ali Mohamed Saleh, Deputy Chief of Station for 
Operations at the Ministry of Defense (MOD) on January 27, 
with Pol/Econ Chief as notetaker.  Major General Saleh had 
already received the diplomatic note, delivered to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 23 (ref a), and was 
well-briefed on the issue.  Saleh repeated several times that 
the ROYG did not \"deserve\" the message in the demarche and 
diplomatic note because the Yemenis understand that state 
aircraft are not obliged to notify them of flights through or 
over international airspace.  Although the MOD requested 
notification of patrols or circular flight patterns, in 
general they believe the problem is already being addressed 
by the informal arrangement for U.S. aircraft to respond to 
hails from Yemeni air traffic controllers (ATC); an 
arrangement that appears to be honored in practice by U.S. 
pilots.  Some of the MOD response may be attributed to delays 
in responding officially to the August 26 letter from Yemen\'s 
Chief of Defense Staff, Major General Mohammed Ali al-Qassami 
(ref b).  MG Saleh also said, however, that there have been 
additional incidents in the past month -- which may relate to 
aircraft not following clear flight paths -- and have been 
promised a letter documenting the specifics. 
 
2. (s) Director for Air Operations Brigadier General Abdul 
Ghani Bin Audel, Colonel Ismail Awad of Command and Control, 
Chairman of Yemen\'s Civil Aviation and Meteorological 
Authority (CAMA) Hamed Ahmed Farag, and Major Ahmed Alos of 
the Defense Military Institute, who acted as translator, were 
also at the meeting.  Touching on the issue of a pending 
review of the status of Sana\'a International Airport (i.e., 
government or private), Saleh and the CAMA Director raised 
the issue of airport landing and service fees, but did not 
provide information requested previously concerning a 
schedule of fees.  End Summary/comment. 
 
MOD WANTS ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT AIRSPACE PROBLEMS ARE BEING 
ADDRESSED 
 
3. (s) Major General Saleh said that he is \"very, very, very 
sorry\" that the USG has not said \"thank you,\" because Yemen 
routinely grants clearances for all flights in domestic or 
international airspace, and has not acquiesced to Yemen\'s 
requests that state aircraft identify themselves.  He 
repeated several times that the ROYG did not \"deserve\" the 
letter, a sentiment echoed by other ROYG officials at the 
meeting.  He explained that they are well aware of the 
international law, but that they would like U.S. state 
aircraft to identify themselves.  (Comment: MG Saleh\'s 
remarks do not take into account that there is still not a 
meeting of the minds on the meaning of flying with \"due 
regard\" in international airspace (ref b).  End comment). 
 
4. (c) Director for Air Operations Brigadier General Audel 
and Colonel Awad of Command and Control complained that U.S. 
aircraft do not notify Yemeni ATC of changes to flight plans. 
 Citing safety and the need to control airspace over 
international and domestic waters in a post-9/11 environment, 
they requested that pilots identify themselves, particularly 
when flying patrols or in circular patterns.  They insisted 
that Yemen does not require clearances for aircraft in 
international airspace, but that they want pilots to respond 
to ATC calls.  A/DATT explained that U.S. aircraft operate 
under international aviation law and fly with \"due regard\" 
for safety and that pilots have been responding to Yemen ATC 
hails, even though it is not legally required.  Major General 
Saleh acknowledged that there is no need for aircraft to take 
the initiative to identify themselves, but maintained that it 
is better if they do so within Yemen\'s area of responsibility 
(presumably a reference to Yemen\'s Flight Information Region 
(FIR)). 
 
5. (c) Major General Saleh also stated that there have been 
several incidents of airspace violations or changes in flight 
plans since the demarche was delivered to the MFA on December 
23 (ref a), one within the past few days.  MOD officers 
promised to provide a letter, which they claim has already 
been drafted, but must be cleared, outlining the specific 
problems. 
 
SANA\'A INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NO FEES IF GOVERNMENT 
CONTROLLED 
 
6. (c) Major General Saleh and CAMA Director Farag both 
raised the issue of airport fees.  Saleh conceded that 
overflight fees are not an issue, but insisted that the USG 
should be paying for landing and services.  (Note:  This is a 
long-standing issue and relates to a pending airport 
assessment.  CAMA is responsible for Sana\'a Airport, but 
because CAMA is an \"independent government agency\" dependent 
on income from airport fees, not ROYG funding, it insists 
that the airport should be deemed private.  End note.) 
A/DATT and DCM both noted that the USG is reviewing the 
designation of Sana\'a Airport as government-controlled, but 
that the U.S. has not yet officially received the Yemeni 
responses to U.S. questions regarding the operation of the 
airport (Note: Pol/Econ Chief received the responses 
unofficially from CAMA in December and they have been passed 
back to Washington through DIA channels).  A/DATT made clear 
that the USG will pay for services only to the extent that 
such payments are consistent with U.S. policy, which holds 
that it is improper for one government to tax another 
government.

MISSIONS\' MEETING IN SANA\'A, YEMEN 
 
REF: SECSTATE 14279 
 
1. (U) Summary:  On 10 February 2004, the Ambassador hosted a 
meeting of the G-8 Counterterrorism Action Group (CTAG) local 
mission representatives at the Residence to discuss and 
coordinate member-nations\' ongoing counterterrorism training 
and assistance efforts with the Republic of Yemen government 
(ROYG).  Although there was great variance from country to 
country in the level of support and training, all members 
agreed that more needed to be done to bolster the ROYG\'s CT 
capabilities.  For follow-up among members, The Ambassador 
noted the need for a coordination meeting for support to the 
Yemeni Coast Guard (YCG) and a future meeting with Minister 
of Interior Dr. Rashad Al-Alimi to discuss escorted travel, 
travel advisories and bureaucratic requirements for tourists. 
 Attendees included the ambassadors of France, Germany, 
Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Japan and the 
Deputy Chief of Mission of the Russian Federation.  Action 
Recommended:  Strong support for EU funding for CT in Yemen 
pursuant to request from European Ambssadors. (Para 13) End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
The CTAG 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (U) The Ambassador opened the meeting by reviewing the 
purpose of the CTAG and informing the members that a 
capital-level CTAG meeting would be occurring in Washington 
later in the month.  The Department had asked the Embassy to 
solicit mission-level input from other G-8 members for this 
20 February meeting in order to provide focus based on 
combined assessments.  The Ambassador proposed a round-table 
format where each member representative would discuss his 
country\'s security cooperation with the ROYG, explain 
assistance programs and identify outstanding needs.  The 
Ambassador then briefed members on ROYG Foreign Minister 
Qirbi\'s recent visit to Washington and the positive response 
he received. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
USG CT Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (U) In briefly describing the Embassy\'s CT programs, the 
Ambassador told members that the first tranche of US-supplied 
Coast Guard boats would arrive on 14 February and likely 
become operational in mid-March.  The Embassy also intended 
to soon begin work with appropriate ROYG security forces to 
counter the movement of weapons, WMD or unauthorized 
personnel across the borders.  The Embassy had a program to 
work with police or other law enforcement personnel to 
provide training in anti-riot and community policing 
techniques.  Finally, the Embassy would continue its training 
of ROYG military forces, to include the Central Security 
Force (CSF), Special Forces, the Yemeni Coast Guard and the 
Navy. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
French CT Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4. (U) The French Ambassador informed members of an 
early-March 2004 CG training assessment team that would 
conduct a survey as a prelude to further assistance.  He 
added that a French Ministry of Interior (MOI) team would 
also arrive in that same period to conduct a similar survey 
among police units.  This survey was the first step in a 
5-year program budgeted for 2.5 million euros.  The French 
wished to extend training from police units to the ROYG 
judiciary, with emphasis on the principle of \"the rule of 
law.\"  The French Ambassador expected that his Police Attach 
would arrive in April or May 2004. 
 
5. (U) Concerning security assistance, He further explained 
that the French Embassy was in an \"identification phase\" and 
not yet operational.  The French Ambassador expressed a 
desire to mobilize the European Union (EU) to engage them as 
a body to provide training and funding to the ROYG\'s CT 
efforts.  He suggested that costs would be minimal and that 
the model of EU support for the Palestinian Authority could 
be used as precedent, which received support from all 
attendees.  He suggested, and the Ambassador agreed, that the 
U.S. could also assist in this matter at higher levels. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
British CT Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (U) The British Ambassador said that ongoing training 
assistance (joint with American troops) to the CSF would 
continue.  Concerning the CG, in early February 2004 a marine 
engineering delegation made a 2-week visit to conduct a 
survey.  The Royal National Lifeboat Institute would be 
conducting a survey in the near term.  The British Embassy 
would also be sponsoring a visit by Judge Hamud Al-Hitar to 
the U.K. on 25 February to discuss the issue of creating a 
dialogue between government and Islamists.  (Note:  Hitar is 
the primary judicial representative involved in the ROYG\'s 
periodic release of detained extremists.  End note.)  The 
British Embassy has a program to work with members of the 
Political Security Organization (PSO) to promote methods of 
interrogation that increased efficiency without any use of 
torture. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Italian CT Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (U) The Italian Ambassador briefed members that the 
technical issues surrounding Italian-supplied coastal radar 
systems had been resolved and installation of the system 
would begin in late 2004.  The system is sophisticated and 
establishes linkages between local units and a central Sana\'a 
station to complete coverage of all maritime traffic in the 
Bab Al-Mendab region.  The Italian embassy was also pushing 
forward a draft cooperation agreement on international crime 
and terrorism, which the Italian Ambassador said was soon to 
be signed.  The draft proposed formalizing a exchange of 
information at the MOI level between the two countries. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Japanese CT Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
8. (U) The Japanese Ambassador said that his embassy provided 
little CT training or support to the ROYG due to  legal 
prohibitions.  The majority of Japanese external military 
support was limited to humanitarian missions.  Despite this, 
Tokyo was studying the issue of providing assistance to the 
Yemeni Coast Guard and had sponsored PSO attendance at an 
international terrorism investigation seminar in 2003. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
German CT Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
9. (U) The German Ambassador briefed that, like Japan, 
Berlin\'s focus in Yemen is economic development and that 
there was a \"good government\" provision on military support. 
His embassy had been allotted one million dollars for \"crisis 
prevention\" training, but it was unclear how this money would 
be spent.  Press reporting on a German-Yemeni security 
agreement was false. 
 
10. (C) Confidentially, the German Ambassador informed 
members that through liaison with the MOI he had learned that 
the man arrested in December 2003 for stabbing foreigners in 
downtown Sana\'a had been in possession of $60,000.  Through 
other sources, the ambassador said that this man had been in 
contact with two other Yemenis language students in Germany 
and that a man by the same name had unsuccessfully applied 
for a visa. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Russian CT Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
11. (U) The Russian DCM briefed members that although there 
was no formal security agreement, military support to the 
ROYG was very high and had increased dramatically over the 
last year.  When queried, he admitted that the preponderance 
of this support was military sales, but added that it was 
subsidized and materiel was sold at cost.  In the unspecified 
future, the Russian Federation would be sending a team to 
Hudaydah to repair a Russian-supplied naval ship. 
Additionally, Russia and the Ukraine would be fully equipping 
two mobile brigades, which were ostensibly tasked with the CT 
mission.  This provisioning would include tanks and BMP-2 
infantry fighting vehicles, as well as a standard suite of 
other weapons and equipment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Dutch CT Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
12. (U) The Ambassador of the Netherlands said that his 
embassy provided no CT assistance to the ROYG.  For the 
entire world, The Dutch Military Cooperation budget was only 
21 million euros, down from 50 the previous year.  He said he 
approached the ROYG to discuss possible CT assistance, but 
was told to concentrate on issues like health and education 
because there were other donor countries that were engaged on 
the CT issue. 
 
13. (C) Action requested:  Embassy recommends a strong US 
push for enhanced CT support to Yemen by the EU in the 
context of the US-EU dialogue in support of ongoing efforts 
by UK, French and other EU ambassadors in Sana\'a.

country-specific message on U.S.-Yemen cooperation in 
counter-terrorism and economic development.  Officers will be 
able to discuss cooperation face-to-face and to develop 
specific proposals for public outreach and media campaigns. 
One possible focus for cooperation is the imminent arrival 
and commissioning of EDA boats, which represents a large step 
towards launching the Yemeni Coast Guard.  Other potential 
areas of cooperation include publicizing joint training, 
civil affairs projects and economic development efforts. 
 
3. (sbu) Embassy Sana\'a welcomes the opportunity to develop a

 1. (c) In February 16 meeting (other subjects ref b and 
septel), Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi elaborated on the 
current border dispute between Yemen and Saudi Arabia.  Qirbi 
affirmed that President Saleh is traveling to Saudi Arabia on 
February 17 to discuss the issue with the Saudi Leadership. 
Qirbi added that there are no preliminary proposals or draft 
understandings in place (e.g. for Saleh and Abdullah to sign) 
concerning Yemen\'s claim. 
 
2. (c) Qirbi said that the SAG erected sand barriers, 
concrete pipelines and barbed wire less than twenty 
kilometers of the border.  Qirbi described the barriers as 70 
km and 50 km long in some places.  Citing the 2000 Jeddah 
Border Agreement, Qirbi said no fortification is allowed 
within the 20 km zone on either side of the border.  He 
commented that the ROYG believes the construction more 
closely resembles a military fortification, as opposed to the 
SAG claim that it is an anti-smuggling measure.  In light of 
recent expanded CT cooperation, Qirbi added that the ROYG is 
concerned because the SAG did not consult with the ROYG 
before it began construction.  On a recent visit to Saudi 
Arabia, Qirbi said that he told Prince Abdullah that the 
construction violates the Jeddah Agreement.  As an 
alternative to the barriers, Qirbi said the ROYG would like 
to see a bilateral agreement to fight smuggling. 
 
3.(c) Comment: Press coverage of the barrier is widespread 
and follows another widely reported dispute where the ROYG 
contended that the SAG undertook unilateral action against 
the ROYG.  This past summer, the SAG banned many agricultural 
imports from Yemen, and the decision was not reversed until 
January and only in response -- according to Yemeni officials 
-- to Yemen\'s import ban on Saudi goods.  The ROYG, however, 
clearly hopes to resolve the current dispute expeditiously 
under the rubric of wider counterterrorism cooperation 
between the two nations.  End comment.

SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR SANAA VISIT 
 
Classified By: Charge Alan G. Misenheimer for reasons 1.5 (a), (d). 
 
1.  (U) Embassy Sanaa warmly welcomes the visit of GEN 
Abizaid and his staff.  You will find that operational 
counterterrorism cooperation between the USG and the ROYG has 
increased since your last visit. 
 
2.  (SBU) The grant transfer patrol boats for the Yemen Coast 
Guard arrived on 15 February and we are now in the process of 
getting them operational and training the Yemen Coast Guard 
in their operation and war-fighting techniques.  The Yemenis 
plan a gala inaugural event for the YCG boars in mid-March, 
and we will help the ROYG use that event to boost other donor 
support for the YCG. 
 
3.  (C) Through SOCE-Yemen we have extended our &reach8 
beyond Sanaa by conducting MTTs in outlying areas such as 
Marib, Mukalla, Aden, and Hodeidah.  These MTTs enhance the 
credibility of in-country CT cooperation, as we help the 
Yemenis project a visible and increasingly capable presence 
in areas where the terrorists have operated and/or found 
safehaven in the past. 
 
4.  (C) The USOMC has allocated all its FMF grant monies 
through FY03 and has a viable plan for the FY04 allocation of 
$14.9M once the allocation is formalized.  We are working 
through export license issues with the State Department, and 
the recent Bloomfield memo should alleviate prior approval 
problems.  The Yemen MOD still does not have an authorized 
freight forwarder under contract despite spending $500K 
already for a non-authorized shipper.  Under U.S. law, Yemen 
is responsible for providing transportation for its FMF buys. 
 The USOMC and myself have been involved in this issue on a 
daily basis with the Yemen MOD. 
 
5.  (C) Yemen,s regional policy is currently focused on 
Saudi Arabia.  Saleh is visiting the KSA this week to discuss 
the bilateral contretemps over Saudi construction of sand and 
concrete barriers along several stretches of the shared 
border.  The 2000 Jeddah Agreement ended decades of wrangling 
by demarcating the border, but the current dispute -- which 
hinges on the ROYG complaint that KSA has violated the 
Agreement by building within an agreed 20km \"no-construction\" 
zone -- has opened up old wounds.  This is significant, since 
bilateral cooperation to close the border to smuggling and 
terrorist infiltration is key to security of both KSA and the 
Gulf states. 
 
6.  (S) FM Qirbi,s recent U.S. visit was mostly upbeat, and 
yielded Yemeni agreement to permit U.S. teams to come (timing 
TBD) and interrogate al-Qaida detainees here.  On the other 
hand, the ROYG is resisting U.S. plans to freeze the assets 
of prominent Yemeni Sheikh Abdulmajid al-Zindani for 
terrorist financing.  Ramifications of this issue are not yet 
clear; but the overall bilateral relationship, especially CT 
cooperation, is on a positive footing. 
 
7.  (C) There are still threats in Yemen; but Yemeni security 
services have been prompt and effective in responding to 
security issues (including active threats) and the overall 
threat level continues to decline thanks to U.S.-Yemeni 
security cooperation.  Embassy planning for coming FYs is 
shifting toward greater emphasis on development assistance, 
especially in outlying areas where al-Qaida has been active 
in the past.  We are working with CJTF-HOA on a civil 
military opns program that will complement this positive 
evolution in U.S. engagement, even as we also focus on 
sustaining the effective CT engagement established over the 
past two years. 
 
8.  (C) Your meeting with Saleh will afford an important 
opportunity to update his knowledge of the mutually 
beneficial U.S. military engagement with Yemen and -- 
importantly -- to reinforce his personal relationship with 
you.  Again, we are truly looking forward to your visit.

February 2-6.  Noting the positive meetings Qirbi had with

SUBJECT: SIT-IN BY ETHIOPIAN REFUGEES AT UNHCR SANA\'A 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  A group of former refugees composed of 
Mengistu-era Ethopian naval officers have maintained a 24/7 
sit-in at Sanaa\'s UNHCR office for eight days demanding 
consideration for resettlement in the US or another third 
country.  The sit-in began on Tuesday, February 10, after a 
UNHCR translator informed someone outside UNHCR\'s offices of 
the expected late-April DHS visit to Yemen to take 
applications for resettlement.  UNHCR is located adjacent to 
the residence of the DCM, creating security concerns.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (UN) With the fall of the Mengistu government in 1991 a 
group of 700 Ethiopian naval officers fled to Yemen with 14 
Ethiopian naval vessels.  While approximately 150 of the 
officers eventually returned to Ethiopia the rest remain in 
Yemen.  To date the group has not been integrated into Yemeni 
society nor accorded the status of legitimate refugees. On 
February 10 they began a 24/7 sit-in in front of the UNHCR to 
draw attention to their plight. According to UNHCR, the group 
is neither completely homogeneous nor unified.  Some members 
wish to remain in Yemen and are seeking their legal rights 
under the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees, 
which Yemen signed but never implemented domestically.  This 
faction is reportedly seeking work permits and in some cases 
nationality in Yemen. The majority of the group seeks 
resettlement in a third country, namely the US or Canada, and 
is opposed to being registered in Yemen because they believe 
that will end their chances for third country resettlement. 
 
3.  (SBU) On February 15, 2004, representatives of the 
refugees met with UNHCR for over 3 hours, during which the 
refugees expressed their demands and UNHCR explained the 
options available to them.  Subsequent to the February 15th 
meeting, UNHCR met with the ROYG Ministry of Interior and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to push for host government 
compliance with its Convention obligations as well as to 
protest the lack of security surrounding the sit-in. 
According to Saad Al-Attar, the UNHCR representative managing 
the situation, someone in the host government admitted in 
front of UNHCR staff members that the ROYG gave the 
demonstrators a tacit green light to commence and continue, 
despite the fact that no permit to protest was issued. 
Al-Attar stated that in the past when even a few 
demonstrators have appeared at UNHCR, government authorities 
have cleared them away without delay.  In his view, the fact 
that this sit-in has lasted over a week and initially swelled 
to over one hundred people is evidence of ROYG involvement. 
 
4.  Comment.  Most of the initial group have reportedly 
returned to work, but a residual group of several dozen 
remains.  The sit-in remained at all times peaceful.  Post 
has informed the DHS regional refugee coordiantor in Cairo, 
and will continue to monitor the situation.  At this time 
there does not appear to be any reason to postpone or cancel 
the planned DHS visit to Yemen in late April.

1. (s) Summary: President Saleh told CDA on February 19 that 
DCI George Tenent played a major role in facilitating the new 
border agreement between Saudi Arabia and Yemen.  Both 
countries agreed to halt new construction and begin joint 
Ministry of Interior patrols.  A resolution was a political 
necessity for Saleh who likely felt pressure from tribes who 
had lost lucrative cross-border trade after the barriers were 
erected.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
Saleh: Tenent\'s Role Important 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (s) On the margins of President Saleh\'s February 19 
meeting with members of a congressional staff delegation in 
the port city of Mukallah, CDA congratulated Saleh on his 
successful Feb 17/18 trip to Saudi Arabia.  Saleh replied, 
\"George Tenent spoke with the Saudis two days before me, and 
his role was important.\"  (NFI) Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Ahmed 
Sofan also told CDA that Saleh was pleased with the DCI\'s 
role. 
 
3. (s) Later that same day, FM Abubakr al-Qirbi told CDA that 
\"Saleh had to go\" to Saudi Arabia, adding that Saleh\'s 
successful negotiations with Crown Prince Abdullah was a 
significant step for Yemen.  Echoing comments by DPM Sofan, 
Qirbi said Saleh found Abdullah \"unaware\" of this issue, but 
once notified was immediately responsive to ROYG concerns. 
In a separate conversation on the return flight from 
Mukallah, Deputy Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman privately 
questioned the explanation, and wondered out loud how 
Abdullah could be unaware of an 8 million USD expenditure. 
He commented that Yemen was obliged to accept the Saudi 
position as stated. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
ROYG: Despite Loopholes Claimed by Saudis, 
Construction Violates Jeddah Agreement 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4. (s) DFM Noman described Saudi construction as complying in 
the \"technical sense\" of the Jeddah Agreement because the 
agreement prohibits any construction in the 20 km border area 
that obscures vision across the landscape.  The Saudi 
position, according to Noman, is that the construction of 
pipes anchored vertically in the ground and linked by wire 
does not impede vision and thus is permissible under the 
agreement.  Noman stressed that the ROYG believes that the 
Saudi position is disingenuous because the barriers clearly 
violate both the spirit and the letter of the agreement. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Solution: Cessation of Construction and Joint Patrols 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
5. (s) DFM Noman said the agreement includes a freeze on 
Saudi construction (no dismantling of existing structures), 
and upcoming talks will work out details for stepped-up joint 
patrols that will stop smuggling \"and render the barriers 
unnecessary.\"  However, in an interview with al-Arabiyya (ref 
c), Saleh claimed that barriers would be dismantled.  Many 
papers Yemeni repeated this claim.  Saleh also said further 
negotiations would be conducted by the Ministries of 
Interiors.  In a 2/23 meeting, MFA Director of the Arab World 
Department Abdullah Matar told Pol/Econ Chief that an 
agreement had been signed by both Interior Ministers, but 
that the issue of whether to cease construction and/or 
dismantle the barriers was not decided, but would be worked 
out by \"committees,\" 
 
6. (s) DPM Sofan underscored the political necessity of an 
agreement for the ROYG.  He said that the Saudi barrier 
stopped legitimate cross-border movement by tribes on both 
sides of the border.  Sofan said they were not engaged in 
smuggling per se, i.e. they were not smuggling arms, 
explosives or facilitating the transit of terrorists.  But, 
Sofan reiterated, their ability to move freely across the 
border is vital to the tribes.  Sofan commented that Saleh 
was compelled to intervene directly when talks by the 
Interior Minister and Foreign Minister failed to yield any 
progress at all. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Comment: Balancing Security and Economic Needs 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7. (s) Comment:  While the ROYG and the SAG have not yet 
completely resolved their differences over the Saudi\'s 
construction of barriers, the defusing of this dispute is a 
step forward for Yemeni/SAG cooperation (ref b).  While the 
tribes described by DPM Sofan may or may not be smuggling 
arms, they are likely trafficking household goods, foodstuffs 
and cars, which provide the livelihood for many border tribes 
and businessmen throughout the country.  DPM Sofan clearly 
implied that the tribes put pressure on Saleh to pursue a 
resolution and future cooperation will have to continue to 
balance political, economic and security needs for both 
countries.  End comment.

1.  (S/NF)  Summary: The Ambassador convened an EAC meeting 
on February 28, 2004 to review security conditions for 
Embassy personnel and the general American community in light 
of muted public reaction to the terrorist financing 
designation of Sheikh Zindani (refs A and B) and recent 
threat reporting (ref C).  EAC agreed that neither issue 
warranted immediate changes to Post\'s already stringent 
security posture.  Note:  No change to EAC\'s 2/25 decision to 
not issue a Warden Message was made.  End Note.  The EAC\'s 
pending request to the Department to authorize the return of 
minor dependents to Post was also discussed.  Key offices and 
personnel represented included: AID, AMB, CONS, DAO, DCM, 
FPD, MSG, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, SOCE-Yemen, and RSO.  End 
Summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Quiet Reaction to Designation of Zindani 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  EAC noted that ROYG, political party, general 
public and media reaction to the 2/24 designation of Zindani 
(refs A and B) remained low-key (details reported septel). 
Ambassador said muted ROYG reaction reflects President 
Saleh\'s stated desire to work with the U.S. and avoid turning 
this designation into a contentious issue similar to 
al-Moayed (ref E).  RSO and PD noted that Friday mosque 
sermons were quiet.  The official statement of Islah 
(Zindani\'s political party) placed the onus on the ROYG to 
refute any charges, and uncorroborated reports stated that 
Zindani canceled a press conference at Islah\'s request.  EAC 
agreed that no changes in security posture were needed at 
this time but continued monitoring of the situation was 
warranted. 
 
----------------------- 
Recent Threat Reporting 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (S/NF)  EAC agreed that threat reporting in Ref C also 
did not warrant change to Post\'s security posture because it 
did not indicate an imminent threat, did not contain planning 
specifics and, in ORCA\'s view, was not from a reliable 
source. 
 
-------------------------- 
Return of Minor Dependents 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (S/NF)  DCM said the Embassy\'s request to the Department 
for the return of minor dependents to Post (ref D) was under 
review in the Department.  RSO noted that he had confirmed to 
DS that EAC had concurred on the request.  The EAC remains 
unanimous in support of the request.

SUBJECT:  MEPI EDUCATION: DEVELOPING THE \"PARTERNSHIP SCHOOLS\" 
CONCEPT 
 
REF:  STATE 11812 
 
Below is Post\'s response to reftel questions: 
 
1. On January 27, 2004, Post met with the Vice Minister of 
Education, Dr. Abdulaziz Bin Habtoor, to discuss the MEPI 
Partnership Schools Initiative. Dr. Habtoor was responsive to the 
Partnership Schools concept and will provide further feedback and 
guidance after consultations within the Ministry of Education 
(MoE). 
 
2. The Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) is committed to 
specific reforms and improvements in basic education (grades 1-9) 
and has already taken several steps towards the development and 
modernization of the education sector. The MoE is implementing its 
Basic Education Development Strategy (BEDS) designed to expand 
access for children, especially girls, in rural areas, improve 
quality, and increase efficiency of education. Examples of on- 
going activities include school construction, school mapping, 
community participation, and teachers\' deployment and training. 
Through these policies and reforms, the MoE is hoping to achieve 
at least 95% of the net enrolment in the basic education cycle of 
grades 1-9 by 2015. The donor community (UNICEF, EU, GTZ, WB, 
Dutch Embassy, DFID, WFP, and USAID) has been and must continue to 
provide financial and technical support to the education sector 
for Yemen to meet this lofty goal. 
 
3. The ROYG is executing their education reforms jointly with the 
donor community. The governorates with the most active support in 
education reform are: Taiz, Aden, Hodeidah, and Sana\'a. The USG is 
working with the ROYG in five rural, underdeveloped, and 
underserved governorates (Marib, Saada, Al-Jawf, Amran, and 
Shabwa) to execute their basic education strategy. Support for 
education reform in these governorates is strong, especially as 
assistance to these areas has been extremely limited. 
 
4. The national government is responsible for the primary and 
secondary education of students. However, the ROYG is in the midst 
of a decentralization program designed to transfer budgeting and 
planning responsibilities to the governorate, district, and local 
levels. The ROYG spends USD 174 to188 per pupil per year on basic 
education. 
 
5. Though education in Yemen is supposed to be free, there are 
other expenditures that must be covered by families/students, 
which equal approximately USD 10.5 per student per year. These 
expenditures include: registration fees, mid-year exam and end-of- 
year exams, school certificates, and school clothing. (WFP School 
Survey Report Nov, 2002) 
 
6. In some remote areas, families also cover extra expenditures to 
include the cost of water and bread for teachers. These 
expenditures equal approximately USD 4.00 per student per year. 
 
7. In addition, households take turns in providing meals to 
teachers from outside the district, which can be as much as USD 10- 
14 per student per year.

SUBJECT: NO NEW SECURITY THREAT IN YEMEN; FRENCH NOT CLOSING 
 
REF: ROBERTS/MISENHEIMER TELCON 3/1/04 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  French DCM told DCM 3/2 that media reports 
of French diplomatic closure in Sanaa due to new local 
security threats are in error.  The recent Zawahiri audiotape 
prompted Paris to advise French embassies worldwide to review 
security.  In Yemen, this instruction prompted an ongoing 
review of French sites and several prudent security upgrades. 
 French DCM praised responsiveness of Ministry of Interior. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) DCM called on French DCM Jean Louis Rysto 3/2 to 
discuss media reports that French had closed Embassy, 
Cultural Center and/or the French School in response to new 
security threats in Yemen.  Rysto informed DCM that all such 
reports are entirely/entirely in error, and explained current 
security-related steps taken by the French mission. 
 
3. (C) According to Rysto, the recently circulated audiotape 
attributed to al-Qaeda number two Ayman al-Zawahiri included 
expressions of hostility to French interests in connection 
with the hejab controversy in French schools.  In response, 
said Rysto, Paris sent a cable to nearly all its embassies 
worldwide advising of the Zawahiri statement and ordering 
security review and adjustment as needed.  He stressed that 
France had no/no information whatsoever on any new threat 
specific to Yemen.  The Zawahiri statement was not 
geographically specific. 
 
4. (C) Upon receipt of the cable from Paris, the French 
Ambassador met urgently with Interior Minister Alimi on 2/27. 
 Follow-on contacts, including a joint visit by French 
embassy representatives and MOI officials to main French 
sites (embassy, ambassador,s residence, French Cultural 
Center, French Center for Social Studies (CFES), and the 
French School) on 2/29, led to installation of additional 
concrete traffic barriers and deployment of additional Yemeni 
security personnel at the sites. 
 
5. (C) In order to facilitate the security review, the School 
released students 3 days early for a scheduled holiday.  It 
will reopen as scheduled on 3/13.  In the meantime, 
additional on-site security measures will be put in place. 
Rysto considers the French School particularly exposed, as it 
adjoins several busy downtown streets (in contrast to the 
American-curriculum Sanaa International School, which is in 
an isolated suburb and has excellent setback and perimeter 
patrols). 
 
6. (C) Similarly, the French Cultural Center is closed and 
will reopen later this week.  The Cultural Center will close 
during April and relocate to a more secure property, a move 
already in preparation before the Zawahiri message.  Neither 
the embassy nor CFES has closed at all.  Rysto expressed 
frustration that CFES staff focus on academic/cultural 
outreach and resent any security restrictions, but noted that 
they will be compelled to accept at least some on-site 
security measures. 
 
7. (C) A separate meeting between DATT and his French 
counterpart, and telcon between P/E Chief and French consular 
assistant, elicited parallel accounts of the French security 
review. 
 
8. (C) Comment: While not keyed to any local threat 
information, the security moves being undertaken by the 
French are prudent and reasonable.  Their facilities all lack 
setback and previously had minimal perimeter security.  In 
fact, Rysto noted that French Ambassador Moureau had chosen 
to play up the worldwide caution from Paris in order to \"send 
a signal\" to the ROYG -- i.e. to obtain greater security 
attention from the MOI -- and to Paris -- to show that the 
recently arrived ambassador is taking security seriously.  He 
deemed the measure successful, as the MOI has acted quickly 
to provide additional security support.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON US TREASURY DEPARTMENT 
DESIGNATION OF SHAIKH ZINDANI AS TERRORIST FINANCIER. 
 
REF: SANAA 468 
 
1.  SUMMARY: Press coverage of the 2/24 terrorist financing 
designation of Shaikh Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, Head of both 
Al-Iman University and the Advisory (Shura) Council of the 
leading Yemeni opposition party Islah, has generally been 
highly critical.  A few papers offered muted support, 
reprinting the argument outlined by the U.S. Treasury 
Department that Zindani had ties to al-Qaeda.  The 
designation was covered by all Yemeni newspapers and news 
websites except government-controlled media such as Yemen 
TV, Yemen\'s official news agency (SABA), Al-Thawra official 
daily, Aden-based October 14, and 26 September weekly of the 
Armed Forces of Yemen.  Press reports focused on U.S. 
Treasury accusations concerning Zindani\'s role in 
financially supporting terror groups associated with al- 
Qaeda.  The Islah party\'s reaction to the designation was 
described by some newspapers as \"cautious.\"  Some anti-U.S., 
pro-Islah newspapers carried articles critical of the U.S. 
counter-terrorism policy toward Yemen and commented that 
Yemen-U.S. relations will be \"adversely effected\" by the 
Zindani case.  Some newspapers refrained from commenting, 
due to the sensitivity of the issue at least at the public 
level.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Al-Tagheer Net (02/25) published a report titled 
\"Zindani joins the U.S. list of terrorists,\" highlighting 
the U.S. Treasury announcement that Zindani is Usama bin 
Laden\'s loyalist and one of his spiritual advisors.  The 
same site published an op-ed article (2/26) commenting on Al- 
Iman University headed by Shaikh Zindani.  The article said 
that, years after its establishment and particularly after 
many of those who fought in Afghanistan joined it, the 
University turned from a \"scientific institution\" into a 
\"suspicious front that gives birth to elements with 
fundamentalist and extremist views.\"  \"This whole project\" 
Al-Tagheer added, \"emerged amidst an atmosphere full of 
suspicions and controversy about the nature and real 
objectives of the University\'s activities.\"  The article 
referred to an FBI list, which it said was submitted to the 
Yemeni government following the U.S.S. Cole bombing, 
\"putting Al-Iman University on top of 16 locations in Yemen 
suspected of harboring extremist and terrorist elements\" and 
requesting its closure.  The article also examined links 
between Shaikh Zindani and Ali Jarallah, assassin of the 
number two leader for the Yemeni Socialist Party YSP), 
Jarallah Omar, and \"the key role Zindani played in financing 
the assassination.\" 
 
3.  Aden-based Al-Ayyam independent daily (02/26) quoted the 
DPA German news agency in Egypt which said that the Leader 
of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Mahdi \'Akef, criticized 
the U.S. Administration\'s designation of Zindani as a 
terrorism financier.  The Muslim Brotherhood issued a 
statement saying that \"the U.S. is relying on its power, 
designating people as terrorists without any evidence.\" 
\"This act\" the statement added \"is part of a U.S. campaign 
against anything that is Islamic under the pretext of 
fighting terrorism which the U.S. failed to define until 
now.\"  Al-Ayyam added that \'Akef defended Zindani and said 
that, \"if Zindani made any mistake, he should be brought to 
account by his own government.\"  On February 28, Al-Ayyam 
published a statement by Zindani denying U.S. Treasury 
charges, which he described as \"false\".  Zindani said: \"If 
the U.S.A. has any accusations against me it has to present 
them to the competent authorities and the judiciary in the 
Yemen Government.  I would like to remind everyone that the 
Yemeni Government is responsible for defending its citizens 
and I am a Yemeni citizen.  I would like to reiterate that 
terrorism as defined by Muslim scholars in the Juristic 
Assembly of Mecca as `the use of weapons in breach of 
Shair\'ah or the Law, or the murder of innocent people;\' is 
something I condemn in all its forms, and I have already 
announced this several times before.\" 
 
4.  Weekly of the opposition Al-Haq party, Al-Umma (02/26), 
cited \"unconfirmed reports\" that in February 2003 the Yemeni 
Government received a list of Yemenis in leadership 
positions wanted by the U.S. Administration, including 
Shaikh Zindani and Shaikh Omar Ahmad Saif, and accused by 
U.S. sources of having issued a Fatwa to blow up the U.S.S. 
Cole warship. 
 
5.  Independent weekly Al-Usbu\' (02/26) quoted U.S. Public 
Affairs Officer John Balian, who said that \"the designation 
does not constitute a request that Yemen extradite Zindani 
or interrogate him over links to al-Qaeda.\"  The paper 
quoted Foreign Minister Qirbi, as saying that \"the Foreign 
Ministry did not receive the official charge documents from 
the U.S. and will respond to them once it receives them.\" 
The paper commented that the U.S. designation of Zindani 
will \"arouse\" anti-U.S. sentiments in Yemen. 
 
6.  Web site of Islah\'s Al-Sahwa weekly, Al-Sahwa Net 
(02/27), published the text of a short statement issued by 
the Islah party February 27 which said that \"rebutting the 
allegations of the U.S. Treasury Department concerning 
Shaikh Zindani is the responsibility of the (Yemeni) 
Government since Shaikh Zindani is a Yemeni citizen.\" 
 
7.  Independent weekly Al-Ibhar (02/27) published an op-ed 
article commenting that the U.S. played a \"cunning\" game 
first with the former Soviet Union \"when it supported 
mujahideen from different parts of the Arab and Muslim world 
in the fight against communism in Afghanistan\" and against 
the mujahideen themselves \"including Bin Laden, Al-Zawaheri 
and now Al-Moayad and Zindani who once served indirectly the 
U.S. interests during the Cold War.\"  The paper indicated 
that the U.S. designation of Zindani will put Yemen before 
two difficult choices:  \"One\" Al-Ibhar said \"is to extradite 
Zindani to the U.S. which if it occurs will turn the whole 
situation in Yemen upside down.  The second option is for 
Yemen to face a possible economic embargo in case it decides 
to turn down a U.S. request to extradite Zindani.\" 
 
8.  Anti-American Al-Shumu\' independent weekly (02/28) 
quoted an anonymous American source from the Brookings 
Institution who described the recent U.S. Administration\'s 
attempts to pin down people suspected of sympathizing with 
al-Qaeda as \"hasty\".  On the designation, the source told Al- 
Shumu\' that \"sufficient intelligence has not been gathered 
yet about Zindani.\"  Al-Shumu\' also quoted `western 
diplomatic sources\' who said that the U.S. began to gather 
information about the activities of the \"Head of Islah\" 
(probably referring to Speaker of Parliament Shaikh Abdullah 
Al-Ahmar) and his ties with extremist Islah figures accused 
by Washington of involvement in terrorist acts. 
 
9. The English-language Yemen Observer (02/28) commented 
that a massive backlash is expected at every level of the 
Yemeni society in defense of the \"respected national 
figure.\"  The Observer quoted tribal sources who warned 
that, \"they would attack American interests if the U.S. even 
thinks about harming Shaikh Zindani.\"  The Observer quoted 
political observers who regretted the decision and said 
that, \"no state among the 44 countries in what the U.S. 
calls the `Greater Middle East\' that has co-operated more 
than Yemen in the fight against terrorism.\"  In an editorial 
titled \"Sewing the Seeds of Extremism,\" Editor-in-Chief of 
the Observer said: \"With the leveling of accusations against 
Shaikh Zindani, the American administration is putting the 
Yemeni government in very tight spot by raising the ante in 
its pursuit of those it considers extremists ... and by 
adopting this new policy, the U.S. is sparing no efforts to 
shatter the spirit of cooperation with Yemen in the battle 
against terrorism.\"  The editorial questioned America\'s 
motives: \"Haven\'t the American officials considered that 
their inconstant and querulous attitude may ignite anger 
among the Yemeni public and convince them that America is 
not fighting terrorism as it pretends to, but is in fact 
targeting Islam, represented by its leaders and scholars?\" 
The paper added: \"This will undoubtedly give extremists an 
excuse to target Western interests in general and American 
targets in particular in defense of the Yemeni people, whom 
the U.S. has begun kidnapping one by one.\"  \"By this\" it 
concluded \"the American administration has chosen a new 
foundation for extremism, sewing its seeds instead of 
combating them.\" 
 
10.  Prompted by the designation of Zindani, Pro-Islah 
independent weekly Annas (03/01) published an op-ed article 
commenting on Yemen\'s counter-terrorism relations with the 
U.S.  The paper indicated that the effect of President 
Saleh\'s visit to the U.S. in 2000 \"to avoid a possible U.S. 
strike against Yemen\" might not last long.  Annas said that 
Yemen is facing a real danger from outside \"since some 
Yemenis, at least from the American point of view, took part 
in acts of violence, held senior positions in al-Qaeda, and 
were accused of links to terror cells particularly in the 
States.\"  The paper added that the U.S. counter-terrorism 
strategy concerning Yemen is based on: \"using direct 
military force to stamp out so-called terrorists, e.g. Al- 
Harithi; dragging and kidnapping people believed to have 
useful information; such as Al-Hillah (who disappeared in 
Egypt) and Al-Moayad; making terror charges against 
political and religious figures such as Abdullah Sa\'atar and 
Shaikh Zindani of Islah.\" 
 
11.  The independent English-language Yemen Times bi-weekly 
(03/01) quoted Yemeni political analysts, who described the 
Islah response to the charges as \"clever and cautious\". 
 
12.  Mouthpiece of the ruling GPC party, Al-Mithaq weekly 
(03/01), quoted government sources who said that \"once the 
Yemeni government receives something official supporting the 
U.S. allegations against Zindani, it will respond to them, 
since Shaikh Zindani is a Yemeni citizen and is entitled to 
protection.\"  Al-Mithaq also published an article that the 
U.S. Treasury announcement was a shock and a \"puzzle\" to the 
Islah party.  The article described the U.S. Treasury 
announcement as clear and void of complications and its 
expressions noted that the U.S. \"considers Zindani a more 
important target than Bin Laden himself since Zindani is, 
according to the announcement, one of Bin Laden\'s spiritual 
leaders.\"  The article described Islah\'s response to the 
accusations as a \"strategic mistake that carried sheer 
hostility to the Yemeni government by putting it in 
confrontation with the U.S. and making it responsible for 
defending every Yemeni citizen regardless of their acts!\" 
The article indicated that the Yemeni government will not be 
able to enforce the Constitutional provisions that prohibit 
the extradition of Yemeni citizens \"if the extradition 
request came from the Security Council itself or a United 
Nations body.\"  On the other hand, the article commented 
that the delay in making this U.S. announcement on Zindani 
has some \"connotations\" that go beyond the evidence 
question.  \"Winning the coming U.S. presidential elections\" 
the article said \"requires that the Americans\' fear from 
terrorism must be maintained to embellish Bush\'s heroic 
achievements in this area and make the `war option\' look 
like an election program which the Americans have to vote in 
favor.\"  \"Campaigning for these elections, therefore, might 
have started with Zindani, but it could go beyond him since 
Bush is looking for a field where he can launch his new wars 
that require no evidence\" the article added.  \"Our mission\" 
the article concluded \"is clear and that is to find out 
first who informed against Zindani and listen to the 
American evidence so that Yemen does not get blamed or 
attacked for the mistakes of others.\"

Sudam and conveyed reftel demarche evening of 3/3.  Sudam 
noted that the absence of FM Qirbi (in Cairo for AL

Sanaa, March 3 (Saba) - Yemen denounced the blasts took place 
on Tuesday in two Iraqi cities Karbla and Baghdad that caused

criminal acts not target the Iraqi people only, but also its

Begin text (excerpts) of unofficial translation: 
 
Title: The Baghdad Massacres: Who Benefits? 
 
The Republic of Yemen and most countries of the world 
condemned the bloody bombings seen day before yesterday in 
the cities of Kerbala and Baghdad, considering that that 
repugnant act that took the life of dozens of Iraqis is 
included in the framework of the crimes repudiated in all 
heavenly revelations and humanitarian principles. 
 
In the face of the horror of that awful bloodbath, an 
insistent question arises in any mind: who benefits from 
carrying out that crime, and who possesses the capabilities 
and the means of planning that would enable him to carry out 
this sort of operation (lit: implementation), which required 
a high level of equipment and preparation. 
 
(passage on danger of internal strife) 
 
It would be a mistake for anyone to believe or imagine that 
internal strife, if it occurred, would have any outcome other 
than tragedy, for which all would pay the price. 
 
(passage on need to rebuild Iraqi institutions) 
 
What is required of the coalition forces is fulfillment of 
their commitment to hasten the process of enabling Iraqis to 
manage their own affairs in accordance with their free will, 
which will spare this people, and also the occupation forces, 
more losses, especially since continuation of the 
deterioration of security can only lead to subsequent 
disasters, the wounds and tragic scenes of which will linger 
in the minds of the young generations, and will be erased 
only by the return of stability, security and prosperity to 
this country which has suffered from wars such as no other 
country in the world. 
 
Nevertheless the question will remain, who is the beneficiary 
behind those outrages carried out in Kerbala and Baghdad?

1.  (C)  Post confirmed with Ministry of Interior (MOI) that 
the mosque attack in Dhamar 3/5 has no/no relation to 
anti-Western or other terrorism.  As reported in local and 
international press (ref), Abdallah Ahmed Yahia Zeid Ghassan 
killed five persons and injured 30 when he attacked a Dhamar 
mosque with two grenades and small arms fire.  He 
subsequently killed himself.  MOI did not find any letters, 
literature or any personal connections that suggest the

2.  (C)  MOI Chief of Staff Sunidar confirmed to RSO 3/6 
details of the attack.  Sunidar said that \"erratic writings\" 
were found in the attacker\'s house and on his person, calling 
his community immoral and stating that he would \"destroy the 
earth and the village\" because it was evil and corrupt. 
Neighbors reported to MOI that the attacker was mentally

recent divorce with infidelity overtones. 
 
3.  (C)  Sunidar related a specific incident in the attack. 
A woman approached the assailant on the road as he was

REF: SANAA 472 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (c) Summary:  Ambassador presented to the Minister of 
Human Rights on 3/1 the 2003 U.S Annual Report on Human 
Rights Practices on Yemen in Arabic.  Already familiar with 
the report, the Minister said that her Ministry welcomed the 
report\'s findings.  Overall, the Minister described it as 
providing a fair and balanced portrayal of human rights 
issues in Yemen, but admitted that there are some 
shortcomings and Yemen still has a \"ways to go.\"  She said 
that she briefed the report to President Saleh, who 
congratulated her on the positive aspects of the report and 
promised to support the reforms her Ministry is pushing.  The 
Report was also scheduled for ROYG cabinet discussion on 3/2. 
 She identified the Ministry\'s priorities as improving prison 
conditions, reforming the judiciary and increasing awareness 
of human rights issues.  She explained that Yemen is 
beginning to review and address possible sex trafficking 
concerns raised by Post with ROYG interlocutors.  Al-Soswah 
also requested a meeting with the U.S. Delegation to the 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva, from March 15-18 (action 
request ref a).  End Summary. 
 
AWARENESS OF HUMAN RIGHTS HIGHER, REPORT BETTER RECEIVED 
 
2. (c)  Responding to the Ambassador\'s presentation, the 
Minister explained the Report had previously been perceived 
as an attempt to interfere in Yemen\'s internal affairs.  She 
welcomed U.S. observations this year, however, praising the 
report\'s acknowledgment of areas of progress.  She said she 
was encouraged that the report is being viewed domestically 
as constructive criticism among friends.  She acknowledged 
that this year\'s report is more \"balanced\" in giving credit 
and assigning fault, and elaborated that perhaps the most 
significant area of improvement was the President\'s support 
of the Ministry of Human Rights.  She noted that the 
Political Security Organization (PSO) also pledged support 
and indicated a willingness to cooperate with the Ministry in 
addressing security issues as they affect human rights. 
Al-Soswah said that she has requested input and responses 
from ROYG colleagues to the information in the report to 
formulate a unified official response, which she expects will 
be completed within the next few months. 
 
PRIORITIES: IMPROVED PRISON CONDITIONS, JUDICIAL REFORM AND 
INCREASED HR AWARENESS 
 
3. (c) Al-Soswah explained that most shortcomings highlighted 
in the report stem from a lack of capacity or awareness that 
there are problems.  She highlighted three primary 
priorities:  improving prison conditions, reforming the 
judiciary, and increasing awareness of human rights issues. 
She described prison conditions as over-crowded and said that 
prison guards lack training.  Prisoners do not have access to 
basic health care, food and legal representation.  She 
identified a lack of funding as the primary obstacle to 
reforming the prison system, but said that the Ministry plans 
to host a national symposium on prison conditions in April. 
Al-Soswah further commented that the ill-treatment of female 
prisoners continues to be an area of concern, and increased 
awareness among individuals who handle female criminals is 
needed.  She said that private jails, not sanctioned by the 
government, continue to exist and that some women are held in 
these jails primarily for moral crimes, whether real or 
perceived.  The Minister considers private jails to be a 
\"shame\" and cited the Ministry\'s work with women prisoners, 
shunned by family and society, to create post-imprisonment 
options for living and working.  (Comment: Post will explore 
MEPI Small Grants to support NGOs working in this area.  End 
Comment.) 
 
4. (c) Al-Soswah said the Ministry plans to launch a human 
rights awareness campaign that will include a request to the 
Minister of Education to introduce human rights issues into 
school curriculums.  Later in March, the Ministry of Human 
Rights will host a reception celebrating the graduation of 
Islamic law students who, for the first time, studied 
international law from a human rights perspective.  Also, a 
new refugee law is being drafted, which the Minister noted 
will positively impact the estimated 500,000 or more refugees 
in Yemen.  The Ministry is also working on Yemen\'s first 
annual report on human rights, which al-Soswah is confident 
will be an independent report.  Note:  UNHCR estimates 
refugee numbers to be between 70,000-75,000.  End Note. 
 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS UNDER SCRUTINY - ESPECIALLY IRAQI 
WOMEN POSSIBLY TRAFFICKED 
 
5. (c) Regarding the issue of trafficking in persons, the 
Minister reported that new visa restrictions have been 
recently imposed, particularly for women arriving from Iraq. 
Al-Soswah stated that there are approximately 100 people 
arriving to Yemen from Iraq each week, and that a quiet 
investigation into trafficking suspicions related to the sex 
trade raised by Post is currently underway in both Aden and

implicated in trafficking would be severely punished under 
Yemeni laws.  Comment:  Her visa announcement tracks with 
press reports that Iraqis are now required to obtain entry 
visas and that Iraqis living in Yemen must pay a residency 
fee of about 7,500 Riyals (about 40USD).  The new 
requirements represent a reversal of the reciprocal 
arrangement between Yemen and Iraq under Saddam Hussein 
eliminating the need for entry visas.  End Comment.

1.  (C)  Summary: Ambassador called on ROYG Foreign Minister 
3/7 to discuss developments with Arab League reform and the 
Greater Middle East Initiative upon the FM\'s return from the 
Cairo AL ministerial.  Qirbi highlighted the drafting of a 
charter committing the Arab League to political and economic 
reform. On the GME Initiative, Qirbi said that some Arab 
governments were apprehensive while some were willing to 
consider points for \"dialogue.\"  Qirbi had little to add on 
recent CT operations in Abyan (septel).  He welcomed 
information on Millennium Challenge Account (MCA). 
Ambassador also thanked FM for the ROYG condemnation the Iraq 
bombings and the Ministry\'s assistance in addressing 
Trafficking in Persons (TIP).  Also present were DCM and 
Acting Pol/Econ Chief (notetaker).  End Summary.

Arab League Reform; Greater Middle East Initiative 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2.  (C)  Responding to the Ambassador\'s query on the meeting 
of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo, FM Qirbi said intense 
debate occurred on \"lots of issues,\" especially Arab League 
reform and how to proceed.  Qirbi said the important point 
was they agreed to draft a charter committing themselves to 
political and economic reform, including helping 
underdeveloped Arab countries.  Qirbi also noted they 
stressed the Arab commitment to Palestine.  The draft AL 
reform proposal from Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia was 
changed after discussions to a \"balanced and stronger\" 
version.  Qirbi said Arab leaders will designate foreign 
ministers to work on \"substantial changes\" to the Arab League 
charter, with proposals to be presented at the 2005 Algiers 
meeting.  Qirbi later told the Ambassador that the 
discussions on Iraq were \"positive,\" with the Arab League 
exhorting Iraqis to pull together and move forward. 
 
3.  (C)  On the Greater Middle East Initiative, Qirbi said 
that some foreign ministers objected to it being brought up 
without being on the formal agenda.  Qirbi noted it was 
debated for two hours, with more discussion planned in Tunis. 
 He said some were apprehensive, while some feel that it 
should be considered to see which issues are relevant so that 
a dialogue can begin.  Qirbi noted two missing points that 
would have \"made the Initiative more acceptable\": 
Israel-Palestine and Iraq.  Ambassador noted U/S Grossman\'s 
recent consultations and FM Qirbi\'s discussions in 
Washington, particularly at the NSC, as part of a broader 
dialogue.  Ambassador raised the inclusion of the Sana\'a 
Declaration (ref A) in the Under Secretary\'s remarks.  Qirbi 
joked that he never thought the Declaration would be passed 
(at the Sana\'a Conference), noting that the European 
Commission had also adopted a resolution marking the 
Declaration as a basis for moving forward.  He encouraged the 
U.S. and Europe to work together with Arab governments.

4.  (C)  Ambassador thanked Qirbi for ROYG statements 
condemning the attacks on Karbala and Baghdad (ref B). 
Having just returned from Cairo, Qirbi added little 
information about recent security operations by ROYG security 
forces in Abyan that arrested al-Naseeb and others (septel), 
only noting that arrests announced to be in relation to 
suspects related to the USS Cole gives the public \"acceptable 
reasons\" for arrests, hinting that the relationship to the 
Cole is not always accurate.  Ambassador noted the positive 
developments in Yemen and Egypt\'s security relationship as 
typified by the recent rendition of several suspects. 
 
5.  (C)  Ambassador passed report and talking points on 
Millennium Challenge Account (ref C) and noted the provision 
for governments to provide comments.  Ambassador said MCA was 
a priority, and Qirbi noted he had been briefed already by 
Yemen\'s Ambassador to the U.S. on the March 5 discussions. 
Ambassador thanked FM for the comprehensive cooperation 
provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other ROYG 
ministries in addressing Trafficking in Persons (TIP). 
Ambassador noted TIP\'s importance and recognized the 
assistance of the Minister of Human Rights (ref D). 
Ambassador also mentioned possible upcoming USG visitors, 
including CJTF-HOA Brigadier General Robeson, CENTCOM General 
Abazaid and Arabian Peninsula U.S. Ambassadors.

and Commander of the Yemen Special Forces, made a public 
appearance on March 6 at a graduation ceremony for the 
Republican Guard and Special Forces.  DATT, who attended the 
ceremony, confirms that Saleh appeared to be unharmed. 
Saleh\'s appearance refutes widespread press reports (ref a) 
that said Saleh was recovering in Amman after an

2. (c) Post confirmed that Political Security Organization 
(PSO) forces detained al-Quds reporter Sa\'id Thabet, who some 
believe to be the original source of the report.  Thabet is 
an embassy contact and newly-elected to the Yemen Journalist 
Syndicate (YJS) Board, whose members protested 3/7 in front 
of the PSO headquarters.  Both the YJS and the Arab

detention in public statements. 
 
3. (c) Comment: While COL Ahmed Ali Saleh\'s attendance at the 
3/6 ceremony puts to rest rumors that he was injured and 
recovering in Amman as a result of an assassination attempt, 
the circumstances surrounding the reports are still unclear. 
Post is seeking clarification.  After a decrease in the 
number of journalists arbitrarily detained in 2003, Thabet\'s 
detention indicates remaining obstacles to press freedom. 
Journalists who cross so called \"red-lines,\" including 
reporting on security and issues that \"harm national unity,\"

1.  (S/NF)  Summary/Comment:  Yemeni counterterrorism (CT) 
operations by Central Security Forces (CSF) and Ministry of 
Defense forces have been ongoing in the Abyan region for 
approximately one week.  ROYG informed Post of the capture of 
al-Qaida element Raouf Naseeb on 3/3.  Minister of Interior 
and Yemen Special Operations Forces (YSOF) Commander noted 
3/8 the capture of persons related to the USS Cole escapees 
from Aden prison, claiming four captured with six at large. 
Although questions remain on the exact nature of operations 
and what type of terrorists are being targeted (e.g., 
Cole-related or generally al-Qaida), these operations 
demonstrate an aggressive CT campaign by the ROYG.  End 
Summary/Comment. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Senior Advisor to the President Mohamed Sudam 
informed DCM 3/3 that a CT operation had been underway in 
Abyan for several days.  Sudam noted the capture of Ali Abd 
al-Raouf al-Naseeb, aka Abu Mahjan, whom Sudam described as a 
companion of Abu Ali al-Harithi and a significant capture 
affiliated with al-Qaida. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Minister of Defense Abdullah Ali Aliwa told 
CJTF-HOA BGEN Robeson and Ambassador 3/8 that the ROYG 
received information on terrorists hiding in Abyan. 
Operations were begun with Ministry of Interior forces and a 
military brigade.  He said that some persons were captured 
but some were still at large. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  Minister of Interior Dr. Rashad Mohamed al-Alimi 
told BGEN Robeson (visiting from CJTF-HOA) and Ambassador 3/8 
that the ROYG received information about persons preparing 
for terrorist attacks and wanted individuals hiding in the 
Lawdor area in Abyan.  Alimi said they sent a Central 
Security Forces (CSF) CT unit to carry out operations for 
capture.  He noted that the CSF unit also had a military 
brigade in support of CSF.  He said he expected operations to 
be complete within 48 hours.  When asked about USS Cole 
escapees, he said that four persons were apprehended, with 
six still at large.  When asked about the Cole escapees Jamal 
Mohammad al-Badawi and Fahd Mohammed Almed al-Quso, Alimi 
said that they were still at large.  BG Robeson asked whether 
operations could be observed to assist in ongoing U.S. 
training of the CSF.  Alimi said that videotapes could be 
made available. 
 
5.  (S/NF) Yemen Special Operations Forces (YSOF) Commander 
Ahmed Ali Saleh, who appeared healthy and well after 
well-publicized assassination attempt rumors (ref A), said 
that an armored brigade assisted the CSF in the operation. 
He also told BGEN Robeson 3/8 that YSOF would have only 
gotten involved if the CSF were unable to handle the 
operation or if the situation \"got out of control.\"  When 
asked, he said that the operation was against \"10 Cole 
escapees,\" with four captured and six still at large. 
 
6.  (C)  Ministry of Interior Chief of Staff BGEN Sunidar 
told RSO 3/8 that the Abyan operations were a result of 
\"ongoing, long-term planning\" that began in June 2003 after 
the assault on the military convoy in Abyan.  He said the 
operation was ongoing and \"would take time to sort out and 
comment on.\" 
 
7.  (S/NF)  Comment:  While many aspects of the ongoing Abyan 
operation remain unclear, it is positive to see the ROYG 
mounting an aggressive CT deployment involving coordination 
among military and MOI assets (including a U.S.-equipped 
force).  The apprehension of Naseeb is a notable success. 
Possible apprehension of/engagement with escaped Cole 
suspects remains vague.  The paucity of details provided by 
the ROYG has complicated the task of assessing extensive 
regional media reporting on Abyan, e.g., reports of hundreds 
of extremists \"surrounded\" given a surrender ultimatum.  Post 
will continue to seek details and to press the ROYG for more 
information before and during future CT operations.  End

1.  (C) Summary.  The sit-in by Ethiopian refugees reported 
in reftel remains unchanged after nearly one month.  A group 
of refugees continues to camp outside UNHCR\'s Sana\'a offices 
in the road adjacent to the residence of the DCM. Contacts 
with Yemeni officials indicate willingness by the ROYG to 
permit the demonstration to continue until a complete 
solution to the refugees\' situation, i.e. resettlement to the 
U.S. or Canada, is found.  DHS regional refugee coordinator 
might consider postponing travel to Yemen if demonstrators 
obstruct upcoming case screening visit by our overseas 
processing entity ICMC.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Post has sustained an active dialogue with ROYG 
authorities regarding the ongoing sit-in strike by Ethiopian 
refugees -- members of the armed forces of the previous 
regime -- reported reftel. In a meeting on March 1 with 
Deputy Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman, Pol/Econ Chief raised 
Post\'s concerns about the demonstration and the potential 
security threat to the DCM\'s residence.  Noman agreed that 
there is a real security concern and promised to discuss the 
matter with Foreign Minister Qirbi.  After the meeting, the 
MFA confirmed that that conversation had occurred and would 
be followed up by further discussions. 
 
3.  (U)  The demonstrators addressed a letter to the Embassy 
seeking U.S. intervention.  CONS Chief sent a written reply 
urging continued engagement with UNHCR and the ROYG. 
 
4.  (SBU)  RSO met with BG Ahmed Sunidar, the Interior 
Minister\'s Chief of Staff, on March 8 to express Mission\'s 
growing concern about the security risks posed by the 
well-publicized continuing demonstration.  During the meeting 
the RSO made several attempts to get Sunidar on record as to 
whether the ROYG would or would not move the demonstrators or 
end the demonstration.  Sunidar would only offer to add more 
security.  Throughout the discussion Sunidar emphasized 
political and historical aspects of the situation maintaining 
that the solution rests with UNHCR and ultimately the U.S. 
and Canada - the countries to which most of the refugees seek 
resettlement.  Sunidar joked that, even if the DCM moved his 
residence, the demonstration and UNHCR might follow. 
 
5.  (C) Comment.  Based on multiple contacts with the ROYG 
during the last month concerning this ongoing situation it is 
clear that the ROYG is permitting the demonstration to 
continue in the hope that the problem posed by the presence 
of several hundred former Ethiopian sailors will be solved by 
an outside actor -- UNHCR and/or the United States.  There 
are anecdotal reports of demonstrators falling ill, but no 
visible indication that the demonstrators\' resolve is 
flagging.  With the ROYG, similarly, showing no inclination 
to act and UNHCR privately expressing frustration at the 
impasse, Post is concerned that the upcoming visit by our 
overseas processing entity ICMC, during which cases referred 
by UNHCR will be screened at the Sheraton Hotel, may become a 
new or second locus of the demonstration. If this should 
occur and materially hamper ICMC\'s ability to screen 
qualified referrals, the DHS regional representative may wish 
to consider postponing travel to Yemen set for next month 
lest similar demonstrations dominate the visit and impede 
other work.  End Comment.

-------- 
Overview 
-------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Ref A para 18 (Overview of a Country\'s Activities 
to Eliminate Trafficking in Persons) 
 
A.  Yemen may be a country of origin, transit and destination 
for internationally trafficked persons.  In the past, 
trafficking has not been a known problem in Yemen, but some 
indications exist that one may be emerging. 
 
Several cases of children being trafficked within Yemen and 
to Saudi Arabia for street begging were caught by ROYG in 
2002 (confirmed) and perhaps in 2003 and 2004 (unconfirmed). 
These cases involve smugglers known to families who allow 
their children to be taken for begging purposes.  The 
Ministry of Interior (MOI) has made arrests in several cases 
and given instructions for police to investigate and stop the 
practice.  In addition, several ROYG ministries are working 
with UNICEF to investigate the problem. 
 
In 2003 and 2004, increasing numbers of prostitutes, 
particularly from Iraq, may point to a possible problem with 
sex trafficking.  Unreliable and unconfirmed estimates from 
several sources place the number of prostitutes from 1,000 to 
as high as 5,000 in Yemen.  The increase is directly related 
to the new development of Iraqi women acting as prostitutes. 
The prostitution appears organized, although by whom or what 
is unknown at this time.  Two prostitutes told Emboffs they 
were forced via threats against their family in Iraq to 
become prostitutes.  It is unknown but suspected that some 
prostitutes may be under unreasonable debt bondage or 
underage.  The ROYG has begun an investigation (ref B). 
 
Smuggling of migrants from the Horn of Africa (HOA) is a 
problem, although there is no evidence that any are forced 
into prostitution or exploitative labor.  The ROYG is aware 
of the smuggling problem, and treats those who arrive in 
Yemen as prima facie refugees. 
 
Numbers of possibly trafficked persons are impossible to 
estimate accurately.  Yemen has poor government 
infrastructure and little ability to collect and maintain 
reliable statistics.  Children affected in the 2002 cases 
numbered 20, with no confirmed information on further cases 
of child smuggling in 2003-2004.  While the number of 
prostitutes is estimated to be between 1000 and 5000, Post 
can only confirm two instances where Iraqi prostitutes 
indicated they were forced. 
 
B.  The children smuggled were trafficked from areas in 
northern Yemen near the Saudi border to Saudi Arabia by 
persons known to their families for begging purposes.  The 
prostitutes who might be trafficked come primarily from Iraq. 
 Other prostitutes and migrants come from Horn of Africa 
(HOA) countries such as Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea. 
 
C.  Post became aware of an increase in the numbers of Iraqi 
prostitutes in Yemen in late 2003.  Although it is unclear 
how many of these prostitutes fit the trafficking definition, 
it is likely that the sex trafficking problem increased in 
scope. 
 
D.  The ROYG and UNICEF have undertaken a project to examine 
the nature and extent of possible internal and external child 
smuggling.  The project is in its nascent stages, with survey 
work beginning in March 2004. 
 
ROYG ministerial officials were unaware of any possible 
problem with sex trafficking until Post began raising it in 
January 2004.  In February 2004, the Minister of Human Rights 
informed Ambassador that an investigation by relevant ROYG 
ministries into possible sex trafficking had begun (ref B). 
Because trafficking is a nascent issue in Yemen, no surveys 
or reports have been available previously. 
 
E.  The prostitutes that may be trafficked into Yemen live 
mostly in Aden and Sana\'a.  In Aden, they provide their 
services through hotels and clubs.  In Sana\'a, brothels are 
normally found in houses, although some services can be 
obtained at major hotels.  It is not known what conditions 
they might live in when not at work. 
 
Two Emboffs were told by two different Iraqi prostitutes that 
they were forced into prostitution via threats against their 
families in Iraq.  In addition, the prostitution rings appear 
to be well-organized.  One source reported that the Iraqi 
women are brought into Yemen on three-month rotations (see 
classified reporting).  It is not known whether any are 
subject to debt bondage.  It is not confirmed but suspected 
by one source that some may be under the age of 18 (marriage 
age in Yemen is 15). 
 
F.  Ministry of Interior forces caught persons who were 
smuggling children across the Yemen border to Saudi Arabia 
for the purposes of begging.  MOI arrested 8 persons in three 
incidents involving 20 children.  According to several 
sources, including non-governmental, the smugglers were from 
the same areas as the children and known to the families, in 
some cases relations.  The families let their children go for 
begging because they live in extreme poverty and they were 
either given or promised money.  There is no/no evidence that 
any children have been smuggled against their families 
knowledge, nor is there evidence that any children did not 
return to their families.  MOI explained to the families that 
smuggling was illegal.  As with the child labor problem (ref 
D), Yemeni culture and tradition do not lend themselves to 
the understanding that these issues are wrong. 
 
G.  Trafficking in persons is not/not a high-profile issue in 
Yemen because it has not been a problem in the past, the 
scope of the problem now is unknown, and counterterrorism is 
their primary concern.  However, high-level ROYG political 
will to combat trafficking was recently evidenced by 1) 
active cooperation with UNICEF on a study to examine child 
smuggling, including minister-level instructions given to MOI 
offices in remote governorates to help gather statistics; 
and 2)  an immediate response to Post\'s queries about the 
possibility of Iraqi prostitutes being trafficked via A) the 
decision to require entry visas for Iraqis (ref B); and B) an 
immediate investigation launched into possible sex 
trafficking (ref B). 
 
Because trafficking has not been a problem in the past, it is 
unknown whether the ROYG would be willing to take action 
against government officials if they were involved in 
trafficking. 
 
H.  It is unknown whether individual members of government 
forces facilitate or condone trafficking.  Should the 
prostitution issue be confirmed to contain incidents of sex 
trafficking, it is possible that some government officials 
would have been aware or involved, including customs and 
border officials as well as law enforcement and the military. 
 For example, hotels in Aden where prostitutes ply their 
trade are always monitored by MOI and Political Security 
Organization (PSO) officers.  Corruption is a problem in 
Yemen. 
 
I.  The ROYG\'s ability to combat trafficking faces several 
limitations, including extreme poverty, porous borders with 
Saudi Arabia and along its 1400  km coastline, and lack of 
training for police and security officials in identifying and 
preventing cases of trafficking. 
 
J.  The ROYG does not systematically monitor or report its 
anti-trafficking efforts, because it was not/not a problem in 
the past. 
 
K.  All aspects of prostitution are illegal and criminalized, 
including the activities of the brothel owner/operator and 
others.  See para 4. 
 
L.  Marriage age in Yemen is 15 years old.  Young marriage is 
a problem, particularly in rural areas where by tradition 
girls can marry as young as 13 years old.  However, these 
instances of young marriage do not seem to fit the parameters 
of buying and selling of \"child brides,\" but rather come from 
Yemen\'s traditional society.  There is no evidence that 
Yemenis go abroad to purchase \"child brides.\" 
 
---------- 
Prevention 
---------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  Ref A para 19 (Prevention) 
 
A.  The issue of trafficking in persons is too new for the 
ROYG to admit to an overall problem because ROYG officials 
both lack understanding of the issue and do not yet know the 
scope and type of any potential problem.  However, when 
specific problems arise, such as child smuggling, the ROYG 
has admitted to a possible problem and taken action against 
it, e.g., arrests and prosecution of the child smugglers and 
undertaking a study to examine the issue.  When Post raised 
the issue of possible trafficking of Iraqi prostitutes and 
noted the difficulty of tracking numbers and cases because 
Iraqis were not required to have a visa, the ROYG responded 
within weeks by issuing a ruling to require entry visas for 
Iraqis (ref B). 
 
B.  ROYG agencies involved with any anti-trafficking efforts 
would include:  Ministries of Human Rights, Interior 
(including immigration and border control), Labor and Social 
Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Justice; the Prosecutor General. 
 
C.  Because trafficking was not/not a problem, the Government 
has not run any anti-trafficking information or education 
campaigns. 
 
D.  Yes, the ROYG supports many programs that indirectly help 
prevent trafficking problems, although they are not 
specifically targeted at trafficking.  For example, several 
programs on women\'s literacy, combating violence against 
women and increasing women\'s rights have been supported by 
the ROYG and NGOs.  Combating child labor is a ROYG priority 
(see para F below). 
 
E.  As a poor country, Yemen\'s ability to support prevention 
programs is limited. 
 
F.  Because trafficking has not been a problem, there is no 
relationship per se between the ROYG and NGOs on the 
trafficking issue.  However, generally the ROYG and NGOs 
cooperate closely on related issues such as combating 
violence against women, promoting women\'s rights and 
children\'s work.  For example, the U.S. Department of Labor 
funded ILO-International Program for the Elimination of Child 
Labor (IPEC) program combating child labor in Yemen 
cooperates with ROYG entities and with local NGOs working on 
similar issues (ref D). 
 
G.  In response to the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 and the 
9/11 attacks, the ROYG embarked on a comprehensive border 
control improvement program with U.S. assistance.  Yemen\'s 
borders are ocean, rugged mountains and desert, which are 
very difficult to control.  Smuggling and illicit trade are 
problems.  Border agreements with Saudi Arabia and Oman were 
agreed in 2000, with border demarcation proceeding.  The U.S. 
is assisting the ROYG with border control through the 
Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP), using the Pisces 
system, and through assistance to establish a Yemeni Coast 
Guard to patrol the seas.  While border control improvements 
began in response to the terrorist threat in Yemen, increased 
border control has the added affect of improving the ROYG\'s 
ability to identify and prevent instances of trafficking 
should they exist. 
 
At the same time, effective border control remains nascent 
and the ability to monitor emigration and immigration 
patterns for trafficking is limited.  A U.S. training program 
in this regard may be warranted. 
 
H.  Because trafficking in Yemen has not been a problem, 
there is no inter-agency working group or task force to 
combat the problem.  Should a task force be established, it 
would likely involve the entities listed in para 3.B. above 
and be coordinated by the Minister of Human Rights. 
 
I.  Because trafficking has not been a problem, the ROYG does 
not coordinate with multinational or international working 
groups to prevent, monitor and control trafficking.  At the 
same time, the ROYG is actively involved with related groups, 
such as the UN Commission on Human Rights. 
 
J.  Because trafficking has not been a problem, the ROYG does 
not have a national plan of action to address the issue. 
 
K.  Because trafficking has not been a problem, the ROYG does 
not have a specific person or entity identified that is 
responsible for developing anti-trafficking programs. 
However, as noted above, any efforts in this regard would 
likely be coordinated by the Minister of Human Rights, who 
has broad responsibilities to improve human rights in Yemen 
(ref C). 
 
----------------------------- 
Investigation and Prosecution 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Ref A para 20 (Investigation and Prosecution of 
Traffickers) 
A.  Article 248 of the Yemeni Penal Code stipulates a jail 
sentence of 10 years for \"anyone who buys, sells, or gives as 
a present, or deals in human beings; and anyone who brings 
into the country or exports from it a human being with the 
intent of taking advantage of him.\"  Article 249 punishes 
kidnappers for seven years, with the death penalty in cases 
where the kidnapping included killing or sexual assault. 
Article 280 provides sentences of 15 years to death in the 
second offense for persons who \"accept adultery for his wife, 
female members of his family or those he is taking care of,\" 
which presumably could be used to punish sex traffickers. 
Persons accused of trafficking, especially that involving 
coerced labor or prostitution, would also presumably be in 
violation of Article 47 of the Yemeni Constitution, which 
stipulates that \"the State shall guarantee to its citizens 
their personal freedom, preserve their dignity and their 
security...personal freedom cannot be restricted without the 
decision of a competent court of law.\"  Article 161 of the 
Child\'s Rights Law imposes upon the State to \"protect the 
child from all forms of sexual molestation and economical 
disadvantage\" and to protect the child from carrying out 
immoral activities or using them in prostitution or 
molestation or other illegal activities. 
 
The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor. 
 
While only Article 248 appears to explicitly punish 
trafficking, the other articles outlined above could 
presumably be used as well. 
 
B.  The penalty for traffickers under Article 248 is up to 
ten years in prison, while other offenses carry penalties up 
to and including the death penalty. 
 
C.  The penalty for rape by an individual is up to seven 
years in prison. If the rape is committed by two or more 
persons, the punishment is a minimum of two years and a 
maximum of ten years. If the victim is less than 14 years 
old, the penalty is a minimum of three years and a maximum of 
15. 
 
D.  In 2002, the ROYG arrested 8 persons for attempting to 
smuggle 20 children to Saudi Arabia for begging purposes. 
The Ministry of Interior (MOI) reported that most of the 
arrestees were related to those children recovered from their 
custody (mostly elder brothers) and provided the names of 
those arrested and those children recovered to Post.  The 
children were returned to their families, who had allowed the 
children to be taken, and MOI held discussions with the 
families to explain why what they were doing was wrong.  MOI 
also issued a circular to the governorates that border Saudi 
Arabia instructing MOI offices to be alert to the problem of 
child smuggling and to arrest perpetrators. 
 
MOI indicated that those arrested in 2002 were referred to 
the judicial authorities.  Post was unable to obtain 
confirmation from the General Prosecutor or Ministry of 
Justice on the status of these cases in time for this report. 
 This inability to provide detailed case information is not 
surprising.  The Yemeni judicial system is fragmented and 
disorganized, with court decisions still hand-written and 
court records decentralized among individual clerks within 
courts. Post will report such information when it becomes 
available. 
 
In 2003, the Minister of Justice issued circular 13 for 2003 
to the Heads of Appeals courts of all governorates in which 
he noted that rulings issued by primary courts against 
kidnappers and smugglers did not correspond with the \"size 
and danger\" of the phenomenon of smuggling. 
 
E.  Regarding child smuggling, research is underway to 
determine the scope and methods of such operations (see para 
2) but initial indications are that smugglers are free-lance 
operators who are often related to the children in question 
or at minimum well-known to the families.  It would appear 
that such smuggling is due to dire economic conditions and is 
not organized internationally or related to large crime 
syndicates. 
 
Regarding possible sex trafficking, the problem is too new to 
determine yet who might be behind the trafficking.  One 
source identified a particular company, but that information 
is not corroborated (see classified reporting). 
Regarding migrant smuggling that could possibly include 
instances of trafficking, it is unknown who might be behind 
the trafficking. 
 
F.  The ROYG has actively investigated instances of child 
smuggling (see para 4.D above).  The ROYG has launched an 
investigation into possible sex trafficking (ref B). 
Overall, however, because trafficking has not been considered 
a problem in Yemen, the ROYG\'s investigative focus has been 
on counterterrorism rather than trafficking.  In addition, 
the MOI\'s abilities in investigation and surveillance remain 
limited and rudimentary. 
 
G.  Because trafficking has not been a problem in Yemen, Post 
does not believe specialized training has been provided. 
Should such training be identified as necessary, Post would 
welcome ideas on how U.S. assistance might help because the 
ROYG\'s capabilities in this regard are limited. 
 
H.  Because trafficking has not been a problem in Yemen, it 
is doubtful that the ROYG formally cooperates with other 
governments on TIP. 
 
I.  Post is unaware of any extradition of persons charged 
with trafficking to other countries.  The ROYG maintains 
active counterterrorism cooperation with several countries, 
including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where some wanted persons 
have been exchanged.  However, under the Constitution, Yemeni 
citizens cannot be extradited to another country. 
 
J.  Post cannot confirm any government involvement in or 
tolerance of trafficking.  However, should the prostitution 
problem be identified as sex trafficking, it is likely that 
low-level ROYG officials would have been, at minimum, aware 
of it because most prostitution takes place in hotels where 
there is a large presence of both Ministry of Interior and 
Political Security Organization officers. 
 
K.  Because it is not confirmed that government officials are 
involved in trafficking, no steps have been taken by the ROYG 
to end such participation.  The ROYG is undergoing an 
investigation into possible sex trafficking that may uncover 
low-level government involvement. 
 
L.  The government signed and ratified ILO Convention 182 
Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the 
Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour in 1999. It 
ratified the Slavery Convention of 1926 in 1987, and the 
Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and 
Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others in 1989. Yemen 
ratified the Rights of the Child Convention in 1991.  The 
ROYG has signed but not yet ratified the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on Sale of Children 
and Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child in Armed Conflict in 1991. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Protection and Assistance to Victims 
------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (SBU)  Ref A para 21 (Protection and Assistance to 
Victims) 
 
A-I.  Because trafficking has not been a problem in Yemen, 
questions A-I in paragraph 21 of ref A do not yet apply in 
Yemen.  No NGOs address this problem specifically (see para 
3). The children recovered from the child smuggling incidents 
were returned to their families.  The possible sex 
trafficking problem is too new to establish what, if any, aid 
to victims might be provided.  Post will seek information 
from G/TIP to give to the ROYG about what kind of assistance 
ROYG should provide that best meets international standards 
in case a problem is confirmed.

REF: A. STATE 57476 
     B. SANAA 589 
 
Classified By: DCM Alan G. Misenheimer, for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  The Ambassador convened an EAC meeting 
on 3/16 to review security conditions for Embassy personnel 
and the general American community in light of the recent 
thwarted attack on the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan. 
EAC examined Post\'s already stringent and comprehensive 
security procedures and proposed additional security 
measures.  Key offices and personnel represented included: 
AID, AMB, CONS, DCM, FPD, MSG, MO, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, 
RSO, and SOCE-Yemen.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  DCM and ORCA briefed EAC on the details of the 
3/14 bombing attempt in Karachi, noting that security 
personnel observed small but significant details that led 
them to expose the attack in progress.  RSO gave an update to 
EAC on the recent review of security arrangements at other 
sites associated with the Embassy, particularly the Sheraton 
Hotel in Sanaa. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  EAC discussed the security measures in place and 
the potential threat posed to residences and other 
Embassy-related compounds by improvised explosive devices 
(IEDs) concealed in large, high-capacity load vehicles such 
as water-tank trucks.  EAC outlined three areas for further 
planning: (1) to consult with the ROYG on plans and 
capabilities for defusing vehicle-borne improvised explosive 
devices (VBIEDs); (2) to reassess and address risk from 
residential water deliveries; and, (3) to explore if 
additional controls for the post-managed butane canister 
delivery system were necessary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
RAPID RESPONSE EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL (EOD) 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4.  (S/NF)  EAC agreed that RSO would take the lead in 
working with the ROYG to identify and, as possible, 
strengthen current explosive ordnance disposal capabilities 
in the military and/or police forces.  Post will examine 
options for U.S. assistance in the training of rapid-response 
Yemeni EOD personnel.  RSO will also plan a drill or exercise 
based on the Karachi consulate attack scenario. 
 
------------------------------ 
WATER DELIVERIES TO RESIDENCES 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  (S/NF)  EAC discussed residential water deliveries from 
outside contractors and ways to further minimize potential 
risk.  As a first step, the Embassy will adjust the schedule 
of water deliveries to weekday work hours to minimize 
exposure to embassy personnel.  Also, families, members of 
household and any personal household staff will be made aware 
of the water truck delivery schedule and will continue their 
vigilance of suspicious or out-of-schedule deliveries.  Post 
will also examine options for transferring water delivery 
services to Post management if deemed necessary. 
 
-------------- 
WARDEN MEETING 
-------------- 
 
6.  (S/NF)  EAC decided to hold a warden meeting to discuss 
the security situation with the wider community (scheduled 
for 3/22).  EAC noted nervousness among community members 
because of the Madrid attacks and the subsequent statement of 
the Abu-Hafs Al-Masri Brigades (ref b), although the 
much-publicized al-Qaeda videotape (ref a) contains 
references to seven other countries but not Yemen.  DCM 
concluded that these developments, as well as recent CT 
operations in Abyan, provided a powerful reminder of the 
importance of ongoing vigilance and sound personal security 
practices -- even though all available information contains 
no/no reports of specific threats or attack planning in Yemen. 
 
----------------- 
TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS 
----------------- 
7.  (U)  In addition to security, the DCM noted the 
continuing dangers of traffic accidents as the biggest risk 
faced by Embassy Sanaa personnel.  RSO briefed on details of 
a catastrophic traffic accident near the Embassy on 3/15, in 
which a large truck went out of control and caused multiple 
fatalities.  An embassy employee was in the car just behind 
the one demolished by the truck.  RSO reminded EAC members 
that all Embassy personnel should keep radios with them at 
all times for traffic warnings and alerts, in addition to 
security measures.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
------------------ 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Demonstrations 
 
A. Are there any ethnic or religious communities in country 
that are capable of carrying out significant anti-American 
demonstrations? 
 
There are not organized, clearly defined communities as such, 
but ad hoc groupings of Yemeni Muslims are predisposed to 
oppose U.S. policy in Palestine/Israel, Iraq and elsewhere, 
and occasionally demonstrate to express their views. 
 
B. Have there been anti-American demonstrations in the 
country within the last 12 months? 
 
There were small demonstrations at mosques in Sanaa (not sure 
about other places) to protest al-Moayad\'s extradition to the 
U.S. in Fall 2003. 
 
Since September 2003, there have been regular reports, in the 
press and from other sources, of arrests following clashes 
between police and worshippers at the Grand Mosque in Sanaa. 
The disturbances during sermons include protesters shouting 
\"death to America death to Israel\" and other anti-American 
and anti-Jewish slogans. 
 
On March 21, 2003, a march of 5-7,000 people protesting the 
war in Iraq was stopped by police approximately 1/4 mile from 
the U.S. Embassy; the demonstrators initiated violent 
confrontations that resulted in the death of several police 
and protesters. 
 
In March, 2003, Yemenis held several demonstrations opposing 
war in Iraq, most near the UN headquarters complex in Sanaa, 
Tahrir Square and Old Airport Road, all several miles from 
the Embassy. 
 
In Winter 2002 - 2003, Yemeni women held demonstrations in 
front of the German Embassy protesting the arrest of Sheikh 
al-Moayed in Frankfurt, Germany, on terrorism charges. 
 
C. Have these demonstrations taken place near or in front of 
U.S. diplomatic facilities? 
 
The usual sites for anti-American gatherings are in areas of 
Sanaa away from the Embassy; however, the above-mentioned 
March 21, 2003 event took place nearby. 
 
D. What is the average size of an anti-American demonstration? 
 
Depending on the location, up to several hundred people. 
Peaceful demonstrations protesting the war in Iraq have 
ranged from approximately 1,000 to 100,000, by some media 
accounts.  Local press routinely carry inflated estimates 
ranging from half a million to one million-plus. 
 
E. Are these anti-American demonstrations usually triggered 
by U.S. foreign policy initiatives, military actions, or by 
domestic issues? 
 
U.S. foreign policy initiatives and military/law enforcement 
counter-terrorism endeavors, as well as ROYG cooperation with 
same. 
 
F. Are these demonstrations generally violent or peaceful? 
 
Generally peaceful.  Demonstrations must be coordinated and 
approved by ROYG in advance; consequently, the vast majority 
are peaceful.  If not approved in advance, ROYG forces will 
disband a demonstration. 
 
G. If violent, have any demonstrations resulted in damage to 
USG property or injuries to USG employees? 
 
No; however, Yemeni police and protester fatalities in March 
2003 were due in large part to the intervention of host 
government security protecting the U.S. Embassy. 
 
H. If violent, have any demonstrations ever penetrated our 
perimeter security line? 
 
No. 
I. Have there been anti-government demonstrations in the 
country within the last 12 months? 
 
Yes, directed at specific policies, including child labor, 
education and bringing mosques under government control. 
Several anti-government demonstrations occurred in Sanaa and 
Aden. 
J. Have these demonstrations taken place near or in front of 
U.S. diplomatic facilities? 
 
No. 
 
K. What is the average size of an anti-government 
demonstration? 
 
Fairly small, approximately 50 to 200 individuals, similar to 
anti-U.S. protests. 
 
L. Are these demonstrations generally violent or peaceful? 
 
Generally peaceful. 
 
M. If violent, have any demonstrations resulted in damage to 
USG property? 
 
No. 
 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Macro Conflict Conditions 
 
A. Is the host country currently engaged in an interstate or 
intrastate conflict? 
 
No, Yemen is not engaged in any ongoing internal or external 
conflict.  Host country is cooperating with U.S. efforts to 
identify and stop/attack terrorist targets within Yemen.  In 
this regard, the ROYG has demonstrated willingness to engage 
in fairly large-scale police/military operations against 
identified terrorist individuals or cells -- e.g. in Abyan in 
July 2003 and February/March 2004. 
 
B. If an intrastate conflict, is it an insurgency that is 
limited to a specific region or a country-wide civil war? 
 
N/A 
 
C. If limited to a specific region, are any U.S. diplomatic 
facilities located in this region? 
 
N/A 
 
D. Have any of the factions involved in these intrastate 
conflicts signaled or demonstrated an anti-American 
orientation? 
 
N/A 
 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Host Country Capabilities 
 
A. Are law enforcement agencies professional and well-trained? 
 
U.S. assistance has enabled Yemen to develop a competent 
counter-terrorism strike force (see below), but regular 
police/law enforcement are often corrupt, poorly trained and 
underpaid.  For example, an average officer earns 60 USD per 
month.  A captain with 20 years experience earns only 120 per 
month.  A Brigadier General earns 300 USD per month.  This 
economic condition -- reflecting Yemen\'s widespread poverty 
(average per capita income is less than USD 400 countrywide) 
-- fosters widespread corruption that possibly could be 
diminished with increased remuneration. 
 
Further, law enforcement agencies face numerous challenges 
regarding planning, coordination and execution of complex 
counter-terrorism operations.  Reliance on manpower is 
emphasized over the use of technology.  Agencies have 
difficulty maintaining operations security and have 
difficulty operating in a nighttime environment. 
 
On the other hand, Yemeni law enforcement agencies have shown 
a willingness to cooperate with U.S. and Western law 
enforcement agencies -- e.g. in the relatively proficient 
forensic investigation of the M/V Limburg attack in October 
2002.  The United States has provided equipment and extensive 
training to the Central Security Forces (CSF), a 
para-military unit of the Ministry of Interior. 
 
In mid-September 2003, the ROYG disrupted an 
al-Qaeda-affiliated cell operating in Sanaa targeting Western 
interests.  The cell was headed by Afghanistan-trained Amr 
al-Sharif.  The government provided further information on 
the ROYG\'s investigation into the cell\'s activities and 
members, particularly information on several arrests in Yemen 
and Saudi Arabia.  (Note: see answer to Transnational 
Terrorist Indicators question 6B for additional information). 
 
In cooperation with Yemeni officials, the FBI actively 
participated in the investigation of the December 30, 2002 
shootings of three American health care workers in Jibla. 
The perpetrators -- Abed Abdulrazak al-Kamel, the shooter, 
and Ali Ahmed Mohamed Jarallah, the planner -- were tried, 
convicted and sentenced to death in separate trials in 2003. 
On December 1, 2003, a three-judge panel affirmed the death 
sentence of al-Kamel, who will appeal the decision to the 
Yemen Supreme Court.  Court officials expect that the 
conviction will be upheld and passed to President Saleh, who 
is likely sign off on the order to carry out the sentence. 
Post representatives attended al-Kamel\'s trial and appeal 
proceedings, which were relatively transparent and openly 
reported in the local media. 
 
Al-Kamel coordinated the attack with Ali al-Jarallah, who was 
convicted of both the Amcit murders and the assassination of 
Yemeni Socialist Party Deputy Secretary-General Jarallah Omar 
in a separate trial in Sanaa in October 2003.  Al-Jarallah is 
also expected to appeal his conviction and sentence.  No 
specific date has been set for the executions. 
 
B. Have they been trained by U.S. agencies? 
 
Some officers have received DS/ATA training, however, the 
full impact of this training will be manifest only over the 
long term.  The Regional Security Office does maintain 
high-level contacts within the Ministry of Interior who 
received ATA training. 
 
In July - August 2003, 24 host government police 
investigators from across the country participated in a 
two-week DS/ATA Terrorist Crime Scene investigation course 
taught by Evidence Response Team FBI special agents. 
 
The CSF is the counter-terrorism (CT) arm of the Central 
Security Organization (CSO).  The CSF has been equipped by 
the U.S. and trained by U.K./U.S. personnel for the past year 
and will continue into the next fiscal year.  They are ROYG\'s 
intended primary CT force. 
 
In June 2003, the newly-formed CSF CT unit was dispatched to 
the Hattat mountains in Abyan province ostensibly to hunt 
down and bring to justice those responsible for an attack on 
a Red Crescent medical convoy the week before.  However, this 
was a cameo appearance.  In fact, front-line CSO troops were 
actually engaged.  CSO troops were at the lead of this effort 
when Ministry of Defense forces became bogged down by 
harassing gunfire from the surrounding hills.  Over a three 
day period, CSO troops engaged those responsible and 
completed their mission.  CSO was sent out the following week 
to complete mop-up operations. 
 
Per reftel G, beginning in early March 2004, Yemeni 
counter-terrorism operations were conducted by the CSF and 
Ministry of Defense forces in the Abyan region for 
approximately one week.  Yemeni authorities informed Post of 
the capture of al-Qaeda element Raouf Naseeb on March 3, 
2004.  The Minister of Interior and Yemen Special Operations 
Forces commander noted on March 8, 2004, the capture of four 
USS Cole escapees from Aden prison. 
 
C. Are law enforcement agencies confronted with serious, 
widespread corruption inside their agencies? 
 
Yes, see question 3A. 
 
D. Are the intelligence services professional and capable of 
deterring terrorist actions? 
 
The intelligence services are moderately professional. 
Despite ongoing engagement and considerable CT successes, 
they have limited capability. 
 
E. Have the intelligence services been cooperative with U.S. 
Embassy requests or information and support? 
 
Yes, but often grudgingly.  Intelligence services rarely 
volunteer information.  Yet on some occasions the ROYG takes 
the initiative to inform the USG of CT developments -- e.g. 
in the case of ROYG success in September 2003 in disrupting a 
Sanaa-based al-Qaeda cell. 
 
F. Assuming there have been significant terrorist threats in 
recent years, have host country security services been able 
to score any major anti-terrorism successes? 
 
Yes. 
 
G. Has host country been responsive (re: timeliness and 
allocation of resources) to Embassy requests for protective 
security? 
 
Yes. 
 
H. How does the Embassy assess the overall security at major 
airports in the country? 
 
Poor, but the ROYG is receptive to additional U.S.-funded 
equipment and security training.  This view is corroborated 
by an October 2003 visit to Sanaa by a two-person 
Transportation Security Administration assessment team. 
 
I. How effective are customs and immigration controls 
agencies? 
 
Ineffective but improving.  Since February 2002, Somali and 
Ethiopian refugees have been entering Yemen at a reported 
rate of approximately 1,500 per month, adding to the 60,000 
refugees previously registered.  They are settling on the 
southern and western coasts, forming criminal and 
prostitution rings along clan lines.  Criminal related 
violence is on the rise.  With USG assistance, the customs 
and immigration services are attempting to standardize and 
modernize equipment and coverage. 
 
J. How effective are border patrol forces? 
 
In the recent past ineffective; however, a current surge of 
more than 7,000 troops from MOI/MOD resources and increased 
cooperation by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (to include 
collaboration on intelligence and smuggling information) has 
generally improved the effectiveness of border patrol forces.

----------------------- 
TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM 
----------------------- 
 
6. (S/NF)  Transnational Terrorist Indicators 
 
A. Are there any foreign terrorist groups that have a 
presence in country? 
 
Yes.  Al-Qaeda, Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), al-Gama\'a 
al-Islamiyya (AKA: The Islamic Group), Libyan Islamic 
Fighting Group (LIFG), Algerian Islamic Group GIA), Salafi 
Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), Hamas, Palestinian 
Islamic Jihad, PFLP, Hizballah.  The Iraqi Intelligence 
Service maintained a presence in Yemen prior to Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. 
 
In late February 2004, information indicated that the 
militant wing of PLO faction al-Fatah was at a 
meeting/seminar hosted by Kan\'an, a charity that supports 
Palestinian causes. 
 
B. How does the EAC assess this presence? Is it an 
operational cell?  Financial cell?  Support cell?  Propaganda 
cell? 
 
Al-Qaeda: all of the above.  Other groups may have links or 
cooperate with al-Qaeda. 
 
Per reftels D and E, on 09/28/2003, the ROYG Minister of 
Interior held a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador and various 
other Western ambassadors to discuss ROYG\'s disruption of a 
Sanaa-based al-Qaeda cell targeting U.S, other Western and 
Yemeni objectives.  Highlighted was the targeting of the U.S. 
Ambassador\'s motorcade and the British Embassy in Sanaa. 
 
Per reftel F, on 02/14/2004, ROYG Minister of Interior held a 
meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to advise that ROYG 
officials were investigating a possible plot to attack the 
Ambassador. 
 
C. Is the host government sympathetic to these groups? 
 
The Yemeni government is an active partner of the USG in the 
war against al-Qaeda and affiliated groups.  ROYG officially 
supports Palestinian groups, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad 
and Hizballah, but support is mainly rhetorical and does not 
extend to operational activities. 
 
D. Are there suspect non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in 
the country that have a relationship with any of these groups? 
 
Per reftel C: 
 
Organization, Nationality. 
-- Al-Haramain al-Sharifain Foundation, Saudi Arabia 
-- Al-Ihsan Association, Saudi Arabia 
-- World Assembly for Muslim Youth, Saudi Arabia 
-- Dar al-Arqam Stationary for Printing and Publication,

-- Islamic Relief, UK 
-- Dubai Charitable Association, UAE 
-- Al-Fikrah Center, UAE 
-- Al-Islah Association, Kuwait 
 
E. Are there any ethnic or religious communities in country 
that are sympathetic to these groups? 
 
Public sympathy for pro-Palestinian/anti-Israeli groups is 
widespread. 
 
F. How does the EAC assess the level, intent, and scope of 
hostile intelligence services (Iran, Iraq, Syria, Serbia, 
Sudan, et. al.) in country relative to potential 
anti-American terrorist acts? 
 
Foreign hostile intelligence services, e.g. Syria, are 
primarily focused on information gathering for their own 
countries\' interests, not to assist anti-American groups in 
country with terrorist activity. 
 
G. How does the EAC assess the availability of weapons and 
explosives in country or from nearby countries for hostile 
terrorist elements? 
 
Yemen likely has among the highest number of weapons per 
capita in the world, with easy access to varieties of 
explosives.  Weapons and explosives are easily attainable. 
Gun markets are large and well stocked. 
 
Though Yemen is awash in numerous types of weapons, the 
Yemeni cabinet approved a series of amendments to a 1992 gun 
control law intended to bolster regulation of weapons 
possession and trafficking.  These amendments must gain 
approval by the Yemeni Parliament before becoming law. 
Parliamentary opposition to the amendments remains 
significant; more than 150 MPs have reportedly signed a 
petition to quash the gun control law that is still under 
discussion.  Accordingly, Speaker of the Parliament Sheikh 
Abdullah al-Ahmar has publicly described possession of 
weapons as a Yemeni symbol of manhood. 
 
In a separate effort, the ROYG has initiated a weapons 
buy-back program, at a reported cost of 38 million USD, 
intended to acquire Man Portable Air Defense Systems 
(MANPADS), rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) and a variety of 
other heavy weapons from civilian weapons markets.  Citing 
the acquisition of over 1,400 MANPADS from January to June 
2003, ROYG says the program is a success.  There are 
problems, however, such as: 1) cataloguing weapons; 2) ROYG 
paying over market value; and 3) the sustainability of the 
weapons buy-back program.

     C. 03 SANAA 576 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  On the anniversary of the start of the war 
against Iraq, Yemeni opposition newspapers are recalling the 
March 21, 2003 demonstration near the U.S. Embassy that 
resulted in several persons killed and injured after clashes 
erupted between armed demonstrators and ROYG security forces. 
 Press reports are claiming demonstrators were fired upon 
without provocation and printing inflammatory quotes. Embassy 
eyewitnesses (refs) and the 2003 Country Report on Human 
Rights for Yemen both noted that armed demonstrators clashed 
with police.  In response to inaccuracies, Embassy will 
discuss balancing professionalism in journalism with the 
right to press freedom with both ROYG and newspaper 
interlocutors.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  The al-Shura weekly, mouthpiece of the Popular 
Forces Union Party, published 3/17 several reports, op-eds 
and interviews with the families of those killed in an 
anti-war demonstration they dubbed \"Bloody Friday\" near the 
U.S. Embassy 3/21/2003.  One report included a quote from the 
brother of one killed, \"one day I will avenge the U.S. 
Embassy and George Bush.\"  Several so-called witnesses were 
quoted saying the demonstrators were entirely peaceful and 
the ROYG forces were prepared to commit a \"massacre\" that 
day, although Embassy eyewitnesses noted that demonstrators 
came armed (refs).  One op-ed piece stated the Embassy\'s 
security \"turned the demonstration into deadly 
confrontations,\" despite only ROYG forces and not/not Embassy 
security being involved.  In fact, the march was stopped by 
police several blocks from the Embassy, so Embassy security 
had no interaction with demonstrators.  The reports also 
quoted sources as saying the ROYG reached a settlement with 
the families to pay them blood money on the condition the 
families must \"give up any other demands.\" 
 
3.  (U)  Al-Sahwa weekly, mouthpiece of the Islah party, also 
reported 3/18 that the 3/21/2003  demonstration was a 
peaceful one with \"no intention of causing any troubles.\" 
The article criticized the security forces for \"overreacting\" 
and losing patience. 
 
4.  (U)  The 2003 Country Human Rights Report on Yemen 
characterizes the incident.  Referencing Section 1.a:  In 
March, security forces killed and injured demonstrators after 
a gunfight broke out between demonstrators and security 
forces protecting an embassy.  Security forces used tear gas 
and shots in the air to disperse demonstrators.  A policeman 
and 11-year old male citizen reportedly were killed during 
the shootout (see Section 2.b).  Amnesty International (AI) 
reported that police detained dozens of demonstrators and 
subjected some to beatings upon arrest (see Section 1.d). 
The Government had previously allowed several peaceful 
anti-war demonstrations (see Section 1/b);  however, in this 
instance, the demonstrators, led by pro-Iraqi politicians, 
initiated violence aimed at an embassy (see Section 2.b). 
Several members of the security forces were also injured. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  The inflammatory reporting appears to be 
trying to re-write the history of last year\'s demonstration. 
The aim is apparently to place the blame on the ROYG security 
forces and secondarily on the ROYG in general for its 
cooperation with the U.S.  Deputy FM Noman informed the 
Ambassador on 3/18 that the ROYG was considering action 
against al-Shura newspaper for being supported by U.S.-based 
financier Ibrahim al-Wazir (Note:  Foreign financing of 
Yemeni newspapers is against Yemeni law.  End Note.)  Embassy 
reminded MFA of human rights considerations in terms of press 
freedom.  (Note:  The Country Report on Human Rights in 2001 
noted previous ROYG action against al-Shura newspaper.  End 
Note)  Ambassador plans to discuss the reporting and 
responsibilities of professional journalism with persons 
affiliated with al-Shura on 3/24.  End Comment.

1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 6. 
 
2. (C) ROYG Foreign Minister convoked Ambassador on 3/22 to 
pass for USG comment two papers on Iraq/Israel-Palestine and 
the Greater Middle East Initiative (full text paras 7 and 8, 
originals faxed to NEA/ARP) developed by the ROYG for the 
Arab Summit .  Qirbi recalled his February 2004 discussions 
in Washington and Tampa during which American officials 
expressed interest in Arab initiative in these areas.  Qirbi 
asked for any feedback before departing for Tunis 3/24 (see 
action request para 6).  He said he had shared both documents 
with Saudi Prince Saud al-Faisal during his visit to Sana\'a 
3/21-22, and that the Prince\'s suggestions for modifications 
were taken into account.

Arab Summit Draft Resolution 
on the Middle East Initiative 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Qirbi said the ROYG prepared a draft resolution for 
the Arab Summit not just on the GMEI but on \"all reform 
initiatives.\"  He noted two other draft reform resolutions 
from Jordan and Egypt.  The ROYG\'s position tracks closely 
with Jordan\'s.  Qirbi said Arab governments must address the 
reform issue and not shy away from it.  Full translated text 
of reform resolution is in paragraph 7.  In brief, Qirbi 
highlighted the following: 
 
-- leaders should address issue of modernization in Arab 
world, including reform, public participation and democracy; 
 
-- references made to the Sana\'a Declaration and other 
reform-oriented conferences in Doha, Manama, Amman and 
Alexandria (Comment:  MEPI-sponsored conferences); 
 
-- the role of the Arab League in reforms; 
 
--  reforms should take place all over the Arab world and not 
just in a few countries; 
 
-- participation from both governments and the public 
important; 
 
-- reforms should include economic, good governance 
(including civil society), institution building, education. 
Other issues to address include achieving peace in the Middle 
East, freeing Middle East from Weapons of Mass Destruction 
(WMD) and fighting terrorism.

4. (C) When Ambassador asked Qirbi\'s opinion on the 
Transitional Administrative Law, Qirbi said it was \"very 
good\" with the exception of the right of any three 
governorates to veto measures which could counter the wishes 
of the majority.  Full translated text of Iraq and 
Arab-Israel resolution is in paragraph 8.  In brief, Qirbi 
only highlighted the following regarding Iraq: 
 
-- a tri-partite group should be established to set up a road 
map for Iraq, to include United Nations, Arab League and 
Coalition members, with representatives from the Iraq 
Governing Council;  The plan should include the following: 
 
-- the unity of Iraq must be maintained; 
 
-- security should be established by an international force 
under the United Nations; 
 
-- occupying forces should leave the cities; 
 
-- a General Assembly should be established to develop the 
constitution and election law (that should include a 
provision that parties should not be established along 
religious or ethnic grounds); 
 
-- Iraqi security forces must be established.

Comment/Action Request 
---------------------- 
 
5. (C) Comment: The ROYG appears to be trying to find a 
constructive position on both reform and Iraq/Arab-Israel 
conflict to present at the Arab Summit.  Regarding reform, 
Yemen has benefited from MEPI and feels less threatened by 
reform than some other Arab governments because the Yemeni 
experience with political parties, elections, etc. has been 
largely positive.  End Comment. 
6.  (C)  Action Request:  If Department would like Post to 
provide any comments to the ROYG regarding its resolution 
(para 6), please provide points prior to FM Qirbi\'s departure

Republic of Yemen 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
 
Arab Summit Draft Resolution on the Middle East Initiative 
Tunisia, March 29-30, 2004 
 
-- From our belief in the importance of modernizing and 
developing the mechanism of joint Arab work that will achieve 
comprehensive and balanced development for all Arab states. 
 
-- And emphasizing our conviction that the Arab reform 
process is a whole that cannot be split and a common 
responsibility of the rulers and peoples and that all 
official and public efforts, therefore, must be incorporated 
to accomplish the reform and provide an awakening Arab 
atmosphere that brings about prosperity and development and 
preserve the identity and faith of the Arab nation. 
 
-- And from our belief that reforms must spring from the will 
and conviction of the people and that the people\'s 
peculiarities must be taken into consideration in order to 
achieve the required results represented by justice, freedom, 
democracy, public participation, activating the role of women 
and construction of a knowledge society. 
 
-- Conviction that dealing with political problems in the 
Middle East through observance of international legitimacy 
resolutions related to the Palestinian issue, liberation of 
occupied Arab territories, the Iraqi issue, and to avoid 
implementing double standards as is the case of possession of 
WMD - all these form an entryway for the success of reform 
steps in the region. 
 
-- Starting from these all, and according to the clear Arab 
position towards reform and democratic practice and human 
rights which Sanaa Declaration has embodied, and the results 
of conferences that were conducted in Amman, Manama, Doha and 
Alexandria regarding democracy, freedom and reform, we decide: 
 
1. To activate the role of the Arab League as a tool for Arab 
joint work, make the necessary amendments to its charter so 
that it will carry out its role in forming equivalent 
Arab-Arab relations, and lead the reform process in parallel 
steps in all Arab countries through official and public 
contributions, issuing of conventions and agreements that 
promote the democratic and human rights tracks and make their 
protection a common Arab responsibility. 
 
2.  To set and implement a complete Arab strategy for reforms 
with the public participation and free will that spring from 
the aspirations of the peoples of the region, which will 
accomplish minimum social movement for reform, considering 
values, traditions, religious teachings and civilization 
values. 
 
3.  To carry out economic reforms that will lead to the 
enhancement of the common interests between Arab countries 
through stepping gradually from Greater Arab Trade Zone, to 
the Customs Union, to Arab Common Market, liberating markets, 
establishment of development, investment and compensation 
funds for the accomplishment of comprehensive economical and 
development merger in all Arab countries.  Participant 
countries also called on to encourage this direction and to 
dedicate the necessary support for it in addition to what the 
Arab states are offering. 
 
4.  To make a foundation for peoples, participation through 
forms of revival process within the framework of gradualness, 
reality and transparency, and giving the citizens the right 
for freedom of speech, establishing civil society 
organizations, activation of women,s role in development and 
granting her all political and social rights in a way that 
doesn\'t conflict with the traditions and the true religious 
teachings. 
 
5.  To work towards developing the institution building of 
the state, the right governance, separation of authorities, 
accountability, and the assurance of judiciary independence. 
6.  To take the necessary steps that ensure building the 
knowledge society, promoting the educational systems, and 
eliminating the obstacles that hinder the Arab world from 
coping with the knowledge process or that which led to wrong 
understandings of dealing with the others, along with the 
emphasis on tolerant Islamic values that call for freedom, 
justice, and respect of others beliefs. 
 
7.  To continue the efforts that aim to realize the just 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East region, through 
adhering to the Arab Peace Initiative, the Road Map, and 
international resolutions.  Work with the international 
society for eliminating tension and violence from the region 
by solving the Palestinian issue in accordance with the 
treaties and resolutions that call for the establishing two 
states, Palestinian and Israeli that live side by side in 
peace and with total sovereignty and means of existence. 
Also ending the occupation of the Syrian and Lebanese lands 
and ending the occupation of Iraq through working with the 
United Nations and Coalition powers and the Iraqi temporary 
Authority, considering that solving these problems will 
result to the stability of the region and will lead its 
energies toward construction and development. 
 
8.  To work for making the Middle East region free of weapons 
of mass destruction and compliance of all states, including 
Israel, to the signing of the agreement of nuclear weapons, 
because elimination of such weapons enhances elimination of 
elements of doubt and fear among states of the region. 
 
9.  Commitment of all Arab states with the international 
community in combating terrorism with the necessity to deal 
with its reasons and differentiation between terrorism and 
legitimate resistance to occupation. 
 
10.  Arab Foreign Ministers Council is assigned to make plans 
and mechanism for achieving these objectives to be presented 
to the Summit of 2005 for approval.

1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary: Ambassador convened an EAC meeting 
on March 22, 2004, to review security conditions for Embassy 
personnel and the general American community in light of 
Israel\'s assassination of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed 
Yassin (reftel).  Ambassador commenced the EAC with an 
overview of the Yassin assassination.  ORCA Chief and the 
Regional Security Officer (RSO) assessed that the Yassin 
attack did not pose an increased risk of terrorism against 
U.S. interests in Yemen, but demonstrations were likely and 
violent acts by individuals probable.  Additional threat 
information was also discussed, some of which was assessed to 
be unsubstantiated rumor.  DCM reviewed the 3/19 Ethiopian 
refugee incident.  Prior to the EAC meeting, the Embassy 
issued a Warden message warning American citizens to avoid 
possible demonstrations that may arise as a result of the 
Yassin assassination.  After the EAC Ambassador raised this 
issue at a Warden meeting and emphasized the need for 
Americans to lower their profile.  Key offices and personnel 
represented included: AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, MO, PD, ORCA,

2.  (S/NF)  Ambassador briefed EAC members on the 
assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.  Ambassador explained 
that the Hamas presence in Yemen is political, possessing no 
operational capability.  Ambassador advised that there will 
nevertheless be widespread popular sympathy for Yassin within 
Yemen.  While the Yassin assassination is unlikely to 
increase the likelihood of terrorism against U.S. interests 
in Yemen, Ambassador noted the possibility of violent action 
by an enraged individual, such as the March 2002 Embassy 
grenade attack perpetrated by a lone, mentally unbalanced 
individual. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  ORCA Chief concurred with Ambassador\'s 
assessment, stating that Hamas focuses on fundraising 
activity but does not maintain an operational wing in Yemen. 
ORCA advised that the Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) 
embraces Hamas and that potentially violent demonstrations by 
Yemeni citizens are more likely than a Hamas terrorist attack 
in Yemen.  All EAC elements, including intelligence sources, 
concur that no immediate threat of terrorist attacks is 
indicated; but, demonstration(s) over coming days are 
possible.  ORCA Chief added that the Political Security 
Organization (PSO) currently has no information regarding 
threats or demonstrations relating to this issue. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  RSO advised that the Ministry of Interior (MOI) 
does not foresee a major threat emanating from the 
assassination of Sheikh Yassin but assured RSO that the MOI 
would inform the Embassy immediately if a threat was 
recognized.  Furthermore, RSO briefed on two March 22 
incidents that were possibly, but not definitely, linked to 
the assassination, citing a gathering of university students 
in northwest Sanaa and the temporary closing of Tahrir Square 
in downtown Sanaa by ROYG authorities. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  RSO expanded the focus on threats beyond the 
assassination, mentioning: 1) the development of Islah party 
members\' ill will toward Jibla Hospital expatriate workers 
who volunteered medical and teaching services at a Jibla 
school.  The services were withdrawn March 12th to placate 
those Islah party members who perceived the Jibla Hospital 
staff\'s volunteerism as supporting the ruling General 
People\'s Congress party; 2) improvised explosive devices 
found in Amran, Yemen, thought to be linked to labor disputes 
with a Japanese-owned cement plant; and 3) rumors about two 
vehicular bombs in Sanaa.  RSO and ORCA Chief shared the 
assessment that the rumors about the vehicular bombs are 
false. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Ethiopian Refugee Clarification 
-------------------------------- 
6.  (S/NF)  DCM discussed the Ethiopian refugee protest that 
occurred outside UNHCR (adjacent to DCMR) on 03/19/2004.  DCM 
clarified that this is a refugee and immigration issue, not 
one of security, and in no way involves the United States. 
RSO added that based on this issue, the MOI reiterated its 
desire to receive riot control training.  Ambassador advised 
that MOI\'s request made INL\'s pending offer of such training 
especially timely. 
 
--------------------- 
Post Advisory Actions 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (S/NF)  Consul stated that the Embassy issued a Warden 
message that morning, advising U.S. citizens of the 
possibility for large demonstrations to be held in Sanaa and 
thus to take necessary precautions.  Correspondingly, 
Ambassador raised the Yassin assassination issue at a Wardens 
meeting convened following the conclusion of the EAC meeting. 
 EAC advised Embassy employees, and Ambassador reiterated in 
the subsequent meeting with American community wardens, that 
it is a good time for Americans to lower their profile and 
exercise maximum caution.

SUBJECT: 3/20/04 ABIZAID MEETING WITH SALEH: CT OPS IN 
YEMEN, PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN; IRAQ; ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE 
 
 
Classified By: Edmund J. Hull, Ambassador for reasons 1.5 (a) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  During his 3/20/04 visit to Sanaa, GEN 
Abizaid, accompanied by Ambassador and senior staff, called 
on President Saleh.  Saleh asked about ongoing Pakistani CT 
operations in Waziristan.  He asserted that good intelligence 
and money to spread around were more effective in tribal 
regions than large military operations, and predicted that 
Pakistani forces would find it hard to sustain the 
deployment.  Saleh reviewed significant recent CT successes 
in Yemen, including the apprehension of Cole suspects Badawi 
and Quso,.  He was visibly pleased to receive from 
Ambassador a letter of congratulations from FBI Director 
Mueller.  Saleh noted that Yemen,s harsh topography and 
limited resources could have made the country a \"den\" of 
terrorism similar to Afghanistan or northwest Pakistan, but 
ROYG commitment and cooperation with the USG had made the 
country secure.  He suggested resumption of U.S. naval 
refueling in Aden.  Saleh appealed for continuing U.S. 
assistance (both security-related and development-related) 
and U.S. pressure for Yemen,s oil-rich Gulf neighbors to 
assist the country as well.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) CENTCOM Commander General John Abizaid, accompanied 
by Ambassador, called on Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh 
during a five-hour visit to Sanaa on March 20.  The U.S. 
party also included POLAD Litt, RADM Robb, COL Reynes, OMC 
Chief and DCM (notetaker).  Yemeni officials present included 
FM Qirbi, Defense Chief of Staff Qasimi, Interior Minister 
Alimi, and PSO Chief Qamish. 
 
3. (C) GEN Abizaid recalled his useful meeting with FM Qirbi 
during the latter,s early February visit to Tampa and 
Washington, and commended Saleh on the success of 
recent/ongoing counterterrorism operations in Yemen.  He 
noted that the United States appreciates Yemen,s active 
support in the global war on terrorism. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
CT Operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4. (C) Saleh asked Abizaid whether media reports that 
Pakistani forces had surrounded Ayman al-Zawahiri in the 
tribal region of northwest Pakistan were accurate.  The 
General replied that it was uncertain whether or not an HVT 
was present.  He stressed that the initiative shown by 
Pakistani forces was important nonetheless, and assured Saleh 
that U.S. forces were similarly doing their part to keep 
pressure on the terrorists on the Afghan side of the border. 
He expressed optimism over operations in Yemen, Pakistan, and 
Afghanistan, noting that Afghan President Karzai continued to 
strengthen his position. 
 
5. (C) President Saleh showed considerable interest in the 
Pakistani operation, asking if Pakistani forces would remain 
long in the tribal areas.  Abizaid replied that Pakistani 
President Musharraf understood the need to establish 
authority there, so the forces were determined to remain and 
dominate the region.  Saleh expressed skepticism, stating 
that military operations in tribal regions should be a last 
resort, and effective intelligence, coupled with money to 
spread around, was far more effective.  He recalled previous 
CENTCOM Commander GEN Tommy Franks telling him that groups in 
Afghanistan were always seeking money.  Saleh predicted that 
the Pakistani military would find it difficult to sustain 
operations in the tribal zones. 
 
------------------------------ 
CT Operations in Yemen 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) Saleh underscored ROYG determination to work with the 
USG to defeat terrorism despite Yemen,s limited resources 
and difficult geography.  Yemen could have become a worse 
\"den\" of terrorism than Afghanistan or Pakistan, he said, but 
sustained and successful effort by the ROYG -- and good 
cooperation with the USG on many levels -- had brought 
success.  Consequently Yemen is much more secure both for 
Yemenis and for Americans, said Saleh, and U.S. ships can 
again come to Aden to refuel.  Citing his recent extended 
stay in Marib, the President expressed satisfaction at the 
increased presence of security forces there and in other 
tribal areas of Yemen.  \"You will see even more of this in 
future,\" he said. 
 
7. (C) Although Yemen,s tribal regions present difficulties 
similar to those of northwest Pakistan, said Saleh, the ROYG 
had enjoyed greater CT success because of effective 
intelligence.  Saleh recounted several recent successes, 
including the apprehension of Cole suspects Jamal al-Badawi 
and Fahd al-Quso, on March 18, the March 19 capture of two 
others who had been with them, and the expected imminent 
capture of others.  He pointed to the capture of 10 fugitive 
terrorist suspects in recent days, a number which Interior 
Minister Alimi amended to eight.  (Note: MOI forces have 
taken the lead in recent CT operations, as has become the 
norm in Yemen over the past year.  MOD forces are typically 
in a back-up role.  End Note.)  Saleh accepted the amendment, 
concluding that \"We have effective intelligence and we spend 
money, which is better than large military operations.\" 
 
8. (C) In addition, said Saleh, the ROYG had made productive 
use of dialogue to rehabilitate extremist sympathizers who 
had not yet engaged in violent operations.  PSO Chief Qamish 
noted that the dialogue program had succeeded in two areas: 
(a) some jailed suspects had come to realize their error and 
repented; and (b) some fugitive suspects had been induced to 
surrender because they knew that dialogue, rather than death 
or indefinite incarceration, awaited them.  Interior Minister 
Alimi pointed out that dialogue was possible only/only with 
suspects who had had no involvement whatsoever in planning or 
carrying out criminal acts.  Saleh commented that the absence 
of a dialogue option contributed to the USG,s difficulty in 
managing the issue of Guantanamo detainees.  Ambassador 
informed Saleh that the USG was addressing the issue, and 
that a ROYG delegation was being invited to visit the Yemeni 
detainees held at the Guantanamo facility. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Cooperation with Saudi Arabia 
------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Saleh added that cooperation with the KSA was also 
important to CT success in Yemen.  Recently captured 
terrorist suspects had large quantities of Saudi currency, 
illustrating the connection between extremists operating in 
the two countries.  In fact, said Saleh, the influx of Saudi 
money to extremists remained a problem even though the 
terrorist network in the Arabian peninsula had been greatly 
diminished by U.S. and regional CT efforts.  He noted that 
the ROYG had turned over 15 extremists to the Saudis, 
routinely provided Saudi counterparts with information 
gleaned from interrogations, and needed the Saudis to share 
information and hand over Yemenis arrested in KSA.  Saleh 
observed that religious extremism had evolved in the region 
over a period of 60-70 years, so defeating it would take 
work, time and money.  It could not be achieved overnight, 
said Saleh, but he was convinced that Crown Prince Abdullah 
and Deputy MININT Mohamed bin Nayef were serious about doing 
so. 
 
------------------------- 
FBI Director,s Letter 
------------------------- 
 
10. (C) The Ambassador also congratulated President Saleh on 
Yemen,s recent CT successes, and presented him with the 
Arabic text of a message from FBI Director Robert Mueller 
offering congratulations on the capture of Cole suspects 
Badawi and Quso,.  Saleh read the text carefully and was 
visibly pleased.  He commented that this was the first time 
he had received such an expression of thanks from the USG 
over a CT success, despite Yemen,s many successes while 
cooperating with the USG in the war on terrorism. 
 
------------------------------- 
U.S. Assistance to Yemen 
------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Saleh again stressed that Yemen was committed to 
\"maximum cooperation\" with the USG in fighting terrorism 
despite the country,s limitations.  He said Yemen needed 
assistance in many areas, not only in security, intelligence 
and military affairs, but also development assistance -- 
particularly in education, medical care and agriculture.  \"We 
depend on the generosity of U.S. assistance,\" he said.  Saleh 
emphasized that he also hoped the USG would urge Yemen,s 
neighbors, particularly KSA and Qatar, to be similarly 
generous in aiding Yemen.  He noted that some other states in 
the region exert pressure on Yemen due to its close 
cooperation with the USG, and that KSA had even cut some 
financial assistance because the Saudi leadership had an 
exaggerated idea of the scale and type of aid Yemen was 
receiving from the United States.  GEN Abizaid said the USG 
would do what it could to assist KSA in its own CT effort and 
to foster Saudi-Yemeni cooperation. 
 
12. (C) Saleh expressed appreciation for the EDA boats 
recently received for the Yemeni Coast Guard (YCG), but 
appealed to GEN Abizaid to convey to Washington the message 
that Yemen needs continuing assistance.  As an example of the 
sort of help Yemen needs in the security sector, Saleh noted 
that the Yemeni military had an antiquated French 
communications system.  He indicated that Yemen would welcome 
rehabilitation or replacement of this system by the USG. 
Such aid will both increase ROYG capabilities and boost the 
morale of police and security forces to work with the USG to 
achieve further CT successes, he said. 
 
13. (C) GEN Abizaid reiterated U.S. appreciation for Yemen,s 
positive role in the war on terrorism, stating that he and 
the Ambassador would convey the message on continued U.S. 
assistance. The General said he would immediately advocate 
enhanced intelligence sharing, continued training for Yemeni 
military/security forces and cooperation to strengthen the 
YCG.  Intelligence sharing is especially significant, he 
said, because the more each side knows of what the other 
knows, the better they can achieve CT success together.  GEN 
Abizaid added that he also understood and would convey to 
Secretary Rumsfeld the importance of the sort of non-military 
 
SIPDIS 
assistance Saleh had mentioned, particularly in tribal areas. 
 
----- 
Iraq 
----- 
 
14. (C) Turning to the situation in Iraq, Saleh asked the 
nationality of infamous terrorist suspect Abu Musab Zarqawi. 
GEN Abizaid replied that Zarqawi was Palestinian, but 
acknowledged the President,s assertion that Zarqawi was 
thought to hold Jordanian nationality.   Saleh,s point 
appeared to be that Middle Eastern terrorists originate in 
many places, not only Yemen.  In response to Saleh,s 
question about the significance of al-Qaida as a threat in 
Iraq, Abizaid listed, in descending order, four main sources 
of the terrorist threat in Iraq: (a) Zarqawi; (b) Ansar 
al-Islam; (c) Al-Qaida; and (d) Baathi loyalists.   He noted 
that U.S. forces in Afghanistan had not encountered forces 
affiliated with al-Qaida in more than five months, although 
Taliban forces had been engaged as recently as the previous 
week.  Saleh commented that many extremists claim to be 
Yemeni who actually are not, and asserted that 95 percent of 
the extremists in Yemen were actually born in Saudi Arabia. 
\"We Yemenis are not all terrorists!\" he proclaimed. 
 
15. (C) Comment.  President Saleh was clearly pleased that 
the timing of GEN Abizaid,s visit coincided with the 
apprehension of Cole suspects Quso, and Badawi and other 
significant CT successes.  Saleh,s appeal for U.S. economic 
assistance and U.S. pressure on oil-rich neighbors to aid 
Yemen was an updated variation on an important theme. 
Economic development (especially in regions predominantly 
tribal and traditional) is no less important than continuing 
FMF and other channels of direct security-related assistance 
if CT gains in Yemen are to be sustained for the long term. 
Post is coordinating with CENTCOM and CJTF/HOA to institute a 
program of Civil Military Operations to provide visible, 
beneficial projects.  More broadly, it is essential for the 
USG to maintain a significant level of ESF, in addition to 
the highly successful USDA food aid programs of recent years, 
in order to maintain a robust, broad based in-country 
development program as a counterpart to ongoing CT engagement.

1.  (C)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened an EAC 
meeting on March 24th, 2004, to review the security 
situation in regard to potential tensions in the region as 
a result of the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.  EAC 
members noted no specific threats but recommended that the 
American community lower its profile over the weekend due 
to the potential for harsh rhetoric Friday within local 
mosques.  The Embassy issued a warden message warning the 
American community to lower its profile and avoid non- 
essential travel.  This week the RSO conducted and Embassy 
wide duck and cover and safe haven drill, along with an 
emergency notification exercise. RSO assets will monitor 
the streets of Sanaa for potential security problems over 
the next several days.  The American community remains in 
a high state of security awareness even in the absence of 
specific threat against Americans or the Embassy. Key 
offices and personnel represented included: CONS, DAO, FPD, 
MSG, MO, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, SOCE-Yemen, and RSO 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  (C)  Ambassador referred EAC members to a Department 
of State threat advisory explaining that the death of 
Palestinian Hamas leader Sheikh Yassin has caused 
significant upheaval throughout the Middle East and that 
various groups may seize on this event to conduct attacks 
particularly in the occupied territories, and possibly in 
other locations within the Middle East and North Africa. 
The recent threat advisory also stated that Hamas has 
implicated the United States in Sheik Hassin\'s 
assassination and has called on Muslims to retaliate 
against Americans which would indicate a significant 
departure from in message for Palestinian terrorist groups. 
 
3.  (C)  The DCM noted that recent government sponsored 
demonstrations did not contain inflammatory speeches 
denouncing the United States and there were no calls to 
target Americans. 
 
4.  (C)  RSO indicated that the government has expressed 
its concern about the security situation at the Embassy and 
that senior members of the Central Security Organization 
(CSO) have recently visited the Embassy to personally 
inspect the perimeter.  The RSO also conveyed to the 
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) the Embassy\'s need for 
increased vigilance at the Sheraton Hotel, the Yemen 
American Language Institute (YALI), and Haddah Compound. 
Managers responsible for security of YALI, Haddah compound 
and the Sheraton Hotel have been briefed on the security 
situation. 
 
5.  (C)  Community members participated in an emergency 
notification exercise using the emergency and evacuation 
radio network and telephone tree.  Additionally, the entire 
Embassy participated in a duck and cover drill and 
safe haven training exercise during the week of March 21-27, 
2004. 
 
6.  (U)  SEPTEL reports media and ROYG reaction to the 
Yassim assassination.

Post Advisory Actions 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C)  Following the EAC meeting the Embassy issued a 
warden message mirroring the State Department travel 
restriction announcement for civilian travelers to the 
region. The EAC members agreed that Embassy sponsored trips 
should be postponed until after Friday\'s religious services 
when the security situation will be reevaluated. The 
Ambassador advised Embassy personnel to maintain a low 
profile, avoid mosques and large gatherings, and minimize 
their movements over the weekend.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF HAMAS LEADER 
AHMAD YASSIN. 
 
REF: SANAA 468 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  The assassination of Ahmad Yassin 3/22, the 
spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, 
received widespread reaction at various levels of Yemeni 
society including the government, political parties and the 
media.  Newspapers, including government, opposition and 
independent papers, published extensive coverage of the 
incident and statements of condemnation by the government 
and by political parties.  Yemen TV and opposition 
statements commented the same day on the assassination 
saying that the weak Arab presence in the 
Israeli/Palestinian conflict and the U.S. Administration 
backing for Israel were responsible for the assassination. 
Statements supported resistance and argued that the Israeli 
policies are blocking any chances for peace.  A statement by 
the Committee of Yemeni Scholars (Ulama) held the U.S. 
responsible for the assassination and described it as 
\"Israel\'s number one supporter.\"  All media outlets covered 
as well a demonstration in Sana\'a 03/23 in which over 70 
thousand people participated.  President Ali Abdallah Saleh 
addressed the demonstration expressing support to all 
Palestinian factions and demanding that the \"terrorist 
Sharon\" should be tried before the International Criminal 
Court as a war criminal.  Overall, the media condemned the 
act, and held the U.S. Administration responsible for the 
\"Israeli terrorist attacks against the Palestinians.\"  END 
SUMMARY 
 
2.  Yemen TV broadcast two-hour coverage 3/22 on the Yassin 
assassination.  The broadcast commented, \"such consequences 
are a result of the U.S. backing for Israel.\"  Yemen TV 
blamed the U.S. for its \"shy\" reaction to the assassination. 
It also broadcast coverage of a protest organized by the 
Students Federation at Sana\'a University.  Reportedly 
thousands of students and some University professors took 
part in the demonstration.  Anti-Israeli and anti-American 
slogans were chanted during the protest. 
 
3.  Al-Sahwa Net, web site of Islah\'s Al-Sahwa weekly, 
(03/22), published a statement by the major opposition party 
in Yemen, the Yemeni Alliance for Reform (Islah), condemning 
the assassination.  The statement holds Israel and the U.S. 
Administration responsible for the assassination and for any 
consequences that may occur.  It also published separate 
statements by the opposition alliance, the Joint Meeting 
Parties (JMP), the ruling General People\'s Congress and the 
Yemeni Socialist Party.  The JMP statement holds the Arab 
regimes responsible for developments in Palestine \"due to 
their silence to the previous Israeli threats to assassinate 
Sheikh Ahmad Yassin over the past months.\"  The statement 
called on the international community to shoulder its legal, 
humanitarian and political responsibilities \"toward the acts 
of terror being committed in Palestine with U.S. collusion.\" 
 
4.  The statement by the Yemeni Socialist Party stressed 
that \"the assassination will only ignite conflicts and 
reduce chances for peaceful solutions in the region and 
which have already been obstructed by the right-wing 
government of Sharon.\"  The ruling General People\'s Congress 
party stressed in its statement that the Yemeni attitude is 
firm in supporting the Palestinians \"in their legitimate and 
fair struggle to restore their rights and establish the 
independent state of Palestine on their national soil.\"  The 
statement called on the international community \"to 
interfere and stop the Israeli massacres; to try Sharon as a 
war criminal; to impose strict sanctions on the Sharon 
government; and to take the initiative to achieve peace in 
the Middle East region.\" 
 
5.  Al-Sahwa Net (03/22) reported that a parliamentary 
delegation visited the Hamas office in Sana\'a and offered 
condolences over the death of Yassin.  Al-Sahwa Net quoted 
the Hamas representative in Yemen, Jamal Eissa, who called 
on the people of Yemen to attend a ceremony in solidarity 
with Palestine next Thursday, 3/24 in Sana\'a. 
 
 
6.  Al-Thawra official daily (03/23) quoted an unnamed 
Yemeni government source who condemned in strongly worded 
terms the \"criminal act committed by the Sharon government.\" 
\"This cowardly, dangerous and terrorist Israeli criminal 
act,\" the source added, \"is a new affirmation of the state 
terrorism being practiced by Israel and its Prime Minister 
Sharon against the Palestinian people, and is a hindrance to 
all international efforts that aim to establish a fair and 
comprehensive solution to the Israeli/Arab conflict.\"  The 
source said that the assassination \"will only lead to more 
violence and resistance.\"  It demanded on behalf of the 
government of Yemen that the U.N. and the Quartet \"condemn 
this heinous and horrible crime and to put a limit to the 
Israeli terror policies.\"  The source urged the U.N. 
Security Council to send international protection forces to 
protect the Palestinians \"and to prevent the situation from 
deteriorating further.\"  \"This Israeli escalation\" the 
source emphasized \"is a natural result of the international 
community\'s neglect to the destructive and extremist Israeli 
policies.\"  The source demanded from the international 
community to impose sanctions on the Israeli government and 
try Sharon as a war criminal. 
 
7.  Al-Thawra (03/23) also published two separate statements 
by the Parliament and the Shura Council strongly condemning 
the assassination.  The statement urged all levels of the 
Palestinian society, including political leaders and 
resistance factions, \"to unite and strengthen resistance by 
all possible means available.\"  The Parliament called on 
Arab and Muslim leaders to \"offer all types of moral and 
material support to the Palestinian people to help them 
continue the resistance and liberate Palestine.\"  The 
statement requested from the Arab and Muslim countries that 
have \"direct or indirect\" relations with Israel \"to 
reconsider such relations.\"  The Parliament holds the U.S. 
Administration \"fully responsible for the acts of terror 
being committed by the Zionist entity against the 
Palestinians.\"  It called on the international community and 
the Security Council \"to take a serious position toward 
Zionist terrorism and to prove the credibility of its war 
against terrorism.\"  Al-Thawra also quoted the Foreign 
Relations Committee in Parliament, which said that \"any 
peace efforts with Sharon and bloodsuckers in his government 
will never see light.\"  \"Resistance and Jihad\" the FRC added 
\"is the only option that all Arab and Muslim populations 
have to confront the powers of evil which enjoy the support 
of the U.S. Administration.\"  The Shura Council statement 
said that the Council received the news \"with great sorrow 
and anger.\"  It said,  \"all Israel\'s peace theories are 
maneuvers to gain more time to implement its hidden desires 
to eliminate and expel the rest of the Palestinians from 
Palestine.\"  The statement confirmed that the assassination 
is not targeted against Hamas, \"but against all the Arab and 
Muslim populations.\"  Al-Thawra quoted Speaker of Parliament 
Shaikh Al-Ahmar who described the assassination as an 
\"unforgivable act.\"  He called on the U.S. government to 
\"prove its credibility and stand by its responsibilities as 
a peace sponsor to stop the Zionist crimes.\"  He also called 
on the U.S. to \"stop supporting Israel with weapons and 
money and to stop defending it in all international events.\" 
Al-Thawra also quoted the Hamas representative in Sana\'a who 
said that the assassination will make Hamas stronger and 
more determined to resist the Israeli occupation. 
 
8.  Al-Thawra (03/23) published an op-ed titled \"What is 
After the Assassination?\"  The article indicated that strong 
statements of condemnation and negotiations with Israel will 
not stop Israel since Israel \"is looking forward to 
eliminating all the Arabs.\"  \"Israel will not change its 
policies and terrorist plans unless the Arabs move toward 
solidarity and take practical decisions\" Al-Thawra added. 
The paper published another op-ed which said that \"the peace 
process has been buried the day Sheikh Ahmad Yassin was 
killed.\" 
 
9.  Aden-based independent daily Al-Ayyam (03/23) published 
extensive coverage of the assassination.  On the front-page, 
a very provoking photo of Sheikh Yassin in the morgue with 
his brain scattered was printed.  The paper highlighted 
regional and international reactions to the assassination. 
 
10.  All news websites including the government\'s official 
web site Saba News Agency; the Al-Motamar Net (web site run 
by the ruling General People\'s Congress); the Al-Sahwa Net 
(web site of Islah\'s Al-Sahwa weekly); the independent Al- 
Tagheer Net; and the Al-Wahdawi Net reported that a 
\"massive\" demonstration took place in Sana\'a today 3/23. 
Seventy thousand people were reported by newspapers to have 
taken part in the demonstration.  The demonstrators handed a 
letter to the U.N. Representative in Sana\'a requesting the 
U.N. to interfere immediately \"to stop the Israeli massacres 
and try Sharon.\"  Banners were raised during the 
demonstration calling on the people to boycott U.S. and 
Israeli products and calling on the Arab states \"to open the 
door for the Arab youth to go on jihad and not to naturalize 
relations with Israel.\"  The demonstration was attended by 
the President of the Republic who delivered a speech 
condemning the assassination of Yassin.  President Saleh 
requested the U.N. and the international community to try 
Sharon before the International Criminal Court as a war 
criminal.  He described Sharon as \"the world\'s number one 
terrorist\" and that \"no terrorism in the world equals 
Sharon\'s.\"  The President considered the assassination of 
Yassin as a \"challenge to the upcoming Arab League summit.\" 
He said that the Palestinians are suffering from the Israeli 
intransigence \"due to the absence of Arab solidarity.\" 
\"This is the first message to the Arab nation\" the President 
added \"and the second will be to kill Yasser Arafat.\"  The 
President voiced Yemen\'s support \"with all its capabilities\" 
to all resistance factions including Fath, Hamas, Jihad and 
the Public Resistance Movement. The President called on all 
the Palestinian factions to \"unite and confront the Zionist 
intransigence.\"  He noted that the occupation of Iraq is a 
Zionist plot.  \"The occupation of Iraq\" the President added 
\"is a Zionist conspiracy.  Whatever reforms Israel is 
weaving for the Middle East is an overt challenge to the 
Arab nation.\"  \"Reforms only come from inside and with an 
Arab and Islamic will.  Political situations cannot be 
reformed from outside either from the Congress or from 
elsewhere.  And we do not accept foreign pressures whatever 
they are\" the President added. 
 
11.  Al-Thawra (03/24) published another statement by the 
Joint Meeting of the Shura Council and Parliament; the 
Yemeni Cabinet; the Committee of Yemeni Scholars (Ulama); 
and the Yemeni Journalists Syndicate.  The statements 
condemned very strongly the assassination of Yassin. The 
statement by the Shura Council and the Parliament urged the 
Palestinians to unite and \"enhance resistance by all 
possible means.\"  The statement requested all Arab and 
Muslim countries that have \"direct or indirect relations 
with the Zionist entity to reconsider these relations.\"  The 
statement charged the U.S. Administration as \"fully 
responsible for the acts of terror committed by the Zionist 
entity against the people of Palestine since it is the 
strategic ally of Israel and number one supporter.\"  The 
Cabinet called on the international community, the U.N. and 
the Quartet to condemn the assassination; \"to put a limit to 
the Zionist state terrorism and to impose sanctions on 
Israel.\"  The Ulama Committee called on the Arab and Muslim 
countries to boycott the Israeli products and the products 
of companies that support Israel.  It called on the Arab and 
Muslim states that have economic and diplomatic relations 
with Israel \"to break\" these relations. 
 
12.  Anti-American independent Al-Balagh weekly (03/23) 
published an op-ed titled \"Down with terrorist Sharon . Down 
with terrorist Bush.\"  The op-ed blamed the U.S. position 
toward Palestine.  It criticized Bush\'s \"logic\" that 
considers \"the disabled Hamas leader as a terrorist, while 
Sharon for all his crimes, is seen by Bush as a man of 
peace.\"  The paper added that Sharon and Bush are \"the real 
terrorists.\" 
 
13.  COMMENT: While the universal condemnation of the 
assassination by both government and opposition forces as 
reflected in the above statements seems to reflect the 
general public sentiment in the country, the peaceful and 
almost toned-down nature of the demonstrations could be an 
indication that the Yemeni reaction may remain in the realm 
of rhetoric.  Additionally, the government\'s obvious hand in 
organizing the largest demonstration seems to suggest that 
the authorities were acting preemptively to give the public 
a chance to blow off steam and thus avoid more serious 
action. The general condemnation of the United States as an 
accomplice in the act is not new, neither is it surprising 
given the fact that the United States is always blamed for 
not restraining Israel.

SUBJECT: EXPULSION OF YEMENI DIPLOMAT 
 
1.  MFA Protcol Director, Mohamed Taha Mustafa, called in DCM 
on March 28,2004 to discuss the pending expulsion from the 
U.S. of Yemeni diplomat Abdulla M. Al-Socotry.  Ambassador 
Taha Mustafa reviewed the facts of the case explaining that 
the ROYG considers the expulsion decision \"harsh,\" but would 
nonetheless accept it and comply. 
 
2.  Nevertheless, Taha Mustafa asked that the State 
Department not impose additional and undue hardship on 
Socotry\'s wife and family by enforcing the expulsion within 
the stipulated 30-day period.  He asked that the State 
Department give all possible consideration to allowing 
Socotry, his wife and children to remain until the end of the 
school year -- approximately June 30.  Taha Mustafa offered 
assurance that Socotry and his family would depart as soom as 
the children finish out the school year. 
 
3.  The Protocol Director added that he had conferred earlier 
in the day with the MFA assignments office and that Socotry\'s 
reassignment had already been approved.  The effective date 
of his reassingment has been set at July 1, in the hope that 
the State Department will accede to Yemen\'s request to allow 
Socotry, his wife and children to remain until the end of the 
school year. 
 
4.  Post requests guidance on the case of Mr. Socotry and his 
family.

REF: SECSTATE 48784 
 
 1. (U) Summary:  Alumnae of MEPI regional programs 
immediately put lessons learned to work to advance women\'s 
interests in Yemen.  Less than one week after Doha, a female 
journalist won a seat on the 12-member board of the Yemeni 
Journalists Syndicate using tactics gained in the conference. 
 Political party women who participated in Doha secured 
agreement from the Supreme Committee for Elections and 
Referenda (SCER) to establish a Women\'s Department within the 
SCER, an important step in their efforts to reform the 
election law to create better conditions for women to run for 
office.  An Amman alumna held an \"Inspiring Women in Law\" 
conference in Aden 3/13 and plans follow-up work that may be 
supported by MEPI Small Grants.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Doha Alumna Elected to Yemeni Journalists Syndicate Board; 
Election Commission to Establish Women\'s Department 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (U) Freelance journalist and NGO activist Dhekra Abbas 
Shamsan Saeed was elected to the 1000-member Yemeni 
Journalists Syndicate (YJS) 12-member board February 24, less 
than one week after returning from Doha.  She was the only 
woman elected to the board, receiving the fifth highest vote 
count.  She said she believes she won because of the 
techniques and skills she learned at Doha, including crafting 
a message and communicating effectively.  She also credits 
the conference with providing the motivation and belief in 
herself necessary to run for office. 
 
3. (U) Similar, if less dramatic, success was reported by the 
National Democratic Institute (NDI) on behalf of political 
party alumnae of Doha.  Effective advocacy by several alumnae 
and NDI with the SCER resulted in an agreement mid-March to 
establish a Women\'s Department within the SCER, reportedly 
the first such department in the region and perhaps the 
world.  The women are discussing details of the new 
department, including its aims, structure, work plan and 
criteria for hiring, with the SCER. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Amman Alumna Holds Follow-On Conference 
on Women and the Law 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Less than one month after returning from Amman, lawyer 
Reem Abdullah organized a workshop called \"Inspiring Women in 
Law\" March 13 in the southern port city of Aden to examine 
the state of women lawyers and judges in Yemen, given their 
long history in the judicial sphere, and develop a plan to 
advance their roles.  Sponsored under the auspices of the 
Governor of Aden, the workshop drew together male and female 
judges, lawyers, university professors, NGO activists and 
ROYG representatives from the Ministry of Human Rights, 
Ministry of Justice and the National Women\'s Committee.  The 
participants identified obstacles to women in the law, came 
up with specific proposed solutions and developed a work plan 
to generate change.

Comment 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) These specific results from MEPI regional 
programming are heartening for the prospects of advancing 
women\'s participation in Yemen.  In a wide-ranging discussion 
between MEPI alumnae, NDI representatives and Ambassador at a 
DCM-sponsored dinner 3/9, it became clear that the Yemeni 
women returned from Doha and Amman motivated and full of 
specific ideas to advance women\'s interests.  While NDI will 
continue to train and assist the Doha women, Post is 
exploring a MEPI Small Grant with Reem Abdullah to support 
her efforts on women in the law.  End Comment.

REF: A. SECSTATE 55472 
     B. SANAA 710 
     C. 03 SANAA 
 
1. (u) Post welcomes the MEPI FY 04 funding recommendations 
(ref a) and appreciates the opportunity to comment.  Post is 
pleased to see the continuation of a number of successful 
programs, including MEET the U.S., WTO accession training, 
and political parties strengthening.  Reftel a requests 
comments on timing.  Post is willing to begin MEPI programs 
when funding becomes available.  Post offers the following 
pillar-based comments and recommendations: 
 
--------------- 
ECONOMIC PILLAR 
--------------- 
 
2. (u) Trade Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) assistance 
will expand on the already successful WTO accession workshops 
that several Yemeni officials attended.  Post would 
appreciate additional guidance on the structure of available 
TIFA assistance.  While Yemen\'s financial market is still in 
the planning stage, Post believes technical advice through 
the Partnership for Financial Excellence (PFE) might assist 
Yemen as it prepares its legal and regulatory framework 
necessary to build a stronger banking sector, financial 
institutions and, eventually, a stock market. 
 
---------------- 
POLITICAL PILLAR 
---------------- 
 
3. (u) Post enthusiastically supports the overall political 
pillar programming outlined in reftel and has a few specific 
comments.  Regarding election assistance, Post would like to 
note IFES\' 10-year history in Yemen and existing strategy for 
election support.  Therefore, Post hopes that the development 
of a regional strategy does not unduly delay ongoing IFES 
programming in Yemen.  Regarding parliamentary strengthening, 
as discussed between Ambassador and A/DAS Romanowski in 
February, Post proposed to NEA/PI to further divide the $2 
million FY03 allocation to support representative 
institutions more generally by also including local councils. 
 
 
4. (u) Yemen\'s inclusion into the program for higher judicial 
councils and continuing education for judges will be an 
important step forward for judicial reform in Yemen.  At the 
same time, Post has identified commercial law reform as one 
its priorities (ref c) and requests inclusion in the CLDP 
program.  As Post\'s earlier request noted:  Foreign investors 
are discouraged from investing in Yemen because the 
commercial legal system is ill-equipped to adjudicate 
disputes. Judges are often unfamiliar with commercial law, 
and since unification, conflicting laws remain on the books. 
Courts are burdened with large caseloads and, often, a case 
may take years to be heard and then stagnates in the 
appellate process.  If a commercial ruling is won, it is 
rarely enforced.  Without a clear land-titling system, 
limited ability to collateralize against property, and 
courts\' reluctance to enforce default judgments against 
property collateral, domestic investors are also reluctant to 
invest their money into new businesses. 
 
---------------- 
EDUCATION PILLAR 
---------------- 
 
5. (u) The Ministry of Education is implementing a program of 
education reform entitled \"The National Strategy for 
Development of Basic Education in Yemen for 2003-2015.\"  The 
goals are to increase enrollment, increase equality of access 
and opportunities for girls, train teachers and school 
administrators, decentralize the education system and 
increase community participation.  Post will prepare funding 
proposals under the MEPI Education Pillar Education Activity. 
 
6. (u) As the ROYG seeks to implement broad governmental 
reform, consensus within the ROYG and donor community is that 
the lack of public administration skills in Yemen constrains 
reform.  Civil service employees who are not effectively 
trained hinder the ability of the ROYG to achieve national 
level reform and achieve decentralization goals.  Under the 
MEPI Education Pillar/education reform and university 
linkages activities, Post intends to submit a proposal to 
establish a Center for Public Administration through a 
partnership with Yemeni University, a U.S. school of public 
administration and a respected Middle East university.  The 
program will be structured to provide in-service training for 
Yemeni public officials who will remain on the job as they 
pursue a certificate in Public Administration. 
 
-------------- 
WOMEN\'S PILLAR 
-------------- 
 
7. (u) As noted in ref b, MEPI programs assisting women find 
excellent results in Yemen and Post hopes to continue 
increasing programming in this pillar.  While most of Post\'s 
women\'s pillar programs will fall under other pillars 
(political, for example), the ABA CEELI program will find 
enthusiastic interlocutors in Yemen, where women have served 
as lawyers and judges for decades but still face challenges. 
Post also hopes that Yemen might be included in the Freedom 
House survey. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (u) Comment: Yemen is fertile ground for MEPI programs 
(ref b).  Our MEPI alumni universally praise the training 
that they attend.  Post looks forward to future programs that 
encourage the Yemenis to further their reform goals.  End 
comment.

UNHCR SANA\'A 
 
REF: A. SANAA 546 
     B. SANAA 397 
 
1. (U)  Summary.  Following a partial closing by UNHCR of its 
offices in Sana\'a and a threat to close permamently, Yemeni 
police intervened on March 19 to end the sit-in by Ethiopian 
refugees which began February 10, thus ending the potential 
security threat posed to the adjacent residence of the DCM. 
The question of long-term status of the group of Ethiopian 
refugees affiliated with the Mengistu navy remans unresolved, 
however, and a number of them remain in jail.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  On March 11th the Assistant UN High Commissioner 
for Human Rights met in Geneva with Ahmed Al Basha, the 
Director of the Africa Department at the MFA, to discuss the 
sit-in and try to find a way to bring it to a peaceful end. 
According to Saad Al-Attar of UNHCR Sana\'a who was present at 
the meeting, Al-Basha wanted a letter from UNHCR requesting 
the ROYG to disperse the crowd while UNHCR wanted the ROYG to 
end the demonstration peacefully in 3 to 4 days without a 
written request.  The Asst. High Commissioner authorized 
Al-Attar to close the Sana\'a office if the sit-in was not 
brought to a peaceful end.  Al-Basha informed Al-Attar that 
he would return to Sana\'a on March 13 to resolve the 
situation but instead decided to take a week-long holiday in 
Geneva.  With the sit-in continuing and the refugee camp 
taking on a semi-permanent quality including large tented 
areas, a hot food preparation facility and large numbers of 
regular inhabitants, Al-Attar sent most UNHCR employees to 
work from home or to work out of various NGO offices in 
Sana\'a starting Monday March 15. 
 
3.  (SBU)  On March 19 the ROYG moved to break up the 
demonstration.  According to an eyewitness account by the 
DCM, ROYG police removed the Ethiopian men from the sit-in 
site and dismantled their camp early on the morning March 19. 
 Later that morning over 100 Ethiopians, mostly women, 
re-occupied the site after police departed.  After repeated 
attempts by the police to negotiate with the demonstrators 
who eventually began to throw rocks at UNHCR\'s building, the 
police used high-pressure water to disperse the crowd and 
reportedly arrested over 100 men and women.  During the 
confrontation, some demonstrators fled over the wall to the 
DCMR compound but were quickly removed. The DCM departed the 
DCMR shortly after these incursions began. 
 
3.  (SBU)  According to various reports from observers, 
employers of Ethiopian men and women and Ethiopians known to 
Embassy personnel, the arrested demonstrators, some of whom 
were mothers of infants and/or toddlers, were still in 
custody several days after the police action.  According to 
information provided by the MOI to the ARSO, as of March 30 
only men remain in custody but the number of detainees is 
unknown.  According to information provided by the PSO to 
UNHCR, PSO is holding the \"leaders\" of the demonstration. 
The other detainees will be released gradually upon execution 
of an undertaking by each detainee to refrain from future 
threats to Yemeni security. There is no word on when/whether 
the leaders will be released. 
 
4.  (U)  UNHCR employees returned to their offices on March 
20 but remain closed to appointments with refugees.  UNHCR 
plans to resume normal operations on April 3.  The DCM 
returned to his residence on March 19. 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  ICMC visited Sana\'a and successfully interviewed 
cases referred by UNHCR during the course of the sit-in. 
Interviews were held at the Sheraton Hotel and were not 
interrupted by demonstrators.  Meanwhile, PRM has requested 
information about what they now refer to as The Naval Group 
from UNHCR in order to reevaluate whether they qualify for 
resettlement to the US.  According to Al-Attar, the response 
to this request is sensitive and will require careful 
drafting.  Al-Attar is now away on medical leave for an 
undetermined period of time.  His TDY replacement, Steve 
Corliss, has agreed to respond to the inquiry prior to the 
DHS visit to Sana\'a but notes that UNHCR wants to see a 
\'cooling-off\' period prior to resuming any dialogue with the 
Naval Group. 
 
6.  (U)  Comment.  The immediate security threat to UNHCR and 
the DCMR has been removed but the ongoing dilemma of 
how/whether to resettle the Ethiopians, either in the U.S. or 
elsewhere, remains.  While it is unlikely that a referral 
will be forthcoming from UNHCR prior to the planned visit by 
DHS regional representative approximately one month from now, 
based on the successful conclusion of the ICMC visit Post 
believes DHS should go ahead with its plan to come to Sana\'a.

1. (c) Summary:  Ambassador met with FM Qirbi on 3/31 
primarily to discuss the reasons for the postponement of the 
Arab League summit planned for March 29-30 in Tunis.  Qirbi 
characterized the March 27 announcement as a last-minute 
\"surprise.\"  Citing heated discussions on secondary issues, 
debates over semantics and the role of civil society, and the 
apparent rejection of undisclosed, proposed Tunisian changes 
to Charter documents, he suggested that Tunisia\'s leadership 
canceled the summit to avoid public disagreement.  Qirbi 
commented favorably on the discussions of the various 
initiatives and said there was \"60 to 70 percent common 
ground\" among the proposals.  He said that there are on-going 
communications between the foreign ministers and country 
leaders to address Tunisia\'s concerns and that he expects 
that Tunisia may still host the postponed summit.  AID 
Representative and Pol/Econ Chief, as notetaker, also 
attended the meeting.  End summary. 
 
SIGNIFICANT \"COMMON GROUND\" ON PROPOSALS -- TUNISIA UPSET 
OVER REJECTED CHANGES 
 
2. (c) Echoing other Arab leaders (ref b), on 3/31 FM Abu 
Bakr al-Qirbi told the Ambassador that postponement of the 
Tunis summit was a complete \"surprise.\"  He added that no 
explanation was offered and that during a recent interview 
(ref c) he had debunked a reporter\'s misconception that the 
U.S. pressured Tunisian President Ben Ali to cancel the 
meetings.  Offering his best guess, Qirbi suggested that \"hot 
debates\" on secondary issues -- a report from the Council on 
Economic and Social Affairs, the AL\'s push to include 
materials on Arab language and culture at a Frankfurt book 
exhibit, and the role of civil society -- as a source of 
concern for Tunisia, despite the fact that a closed FM 
meeting had resolved the issues. 
 
3. (c) Qirbi said he thought the review of the different 
initiatives went smoothly, noting that \"60 to 70 percent\" of 
the proposals covered \"common ground.\"  He explained that 
they were close to finalizing the documents when the 
postponement announcement was made.  He hypothesized that the 
Charter of Arab Consolidation proposed by Saudi Arabia, Egypt 
and Syria -- approved, with significant changes, by the FMs 
at the beginning of March -- may have been a further cause of 
concern.  He complained that Tunisia wanted to make changes, 
but did not provide a paper outlining its request or explain 
its ideas to the FMs.  His view is that Tunisia possibly may 
have been attempting to weaken the Charter, and that the 
drafting countries opposed the proposed edits.  Qirbi also 
noted that bilateral discussions with Saudi Arabia are 
continuing.  He said that he suggested that Ben Ali, as chair 
of the summit, express his point of view in an opening 
address and have his ideas considered on that basis. 
 
4. (c) Commenting that most countries have made positive 
statements about AL reform, the Ambassador asked about the 
differing views among the countries.  Qirbi responded by 
identifying three positions:  Saudi Arabia-Egypt-Syria, 
Qatar-Yemen-Oman (and possibly Morocco) and the \"silent 
group.\"  He explained that press reports on the \"Arab 
position\" were not quite accurate because the articles pulled 
mostly from the Yemeni AL papers (ref e), along with the 
Sana\'a declaration, neither of which were accepted by the 
Saudis or the Syrians.  He cited the examples of Saudi 
Arabian concern about the word \"democracy,\" Egyptian and 
Omani concerns about the role of \"civil society\" in reforms 
and debates on \"governance\" and the empowerment of women, but 
added that he believes that all parties have the same 
objective and that the differences can be reconciled. 
 
CHALLENGE TO ADDRESS TUNISIAN CONCERNS AND MOVE FORWARD 
 
5. (c) Overall, Qirbi characterized the debates as healthy 
and reflective of the concerns of each individual country 
which, for example, are different for Somalia than they would 
be for Saudi Arabia or Yemen.  He also identified resolution 
of the Middle East conflict as the paramount issue for the AL 
and said that there was extensive discussion of the 
relationship of the Arab World with the U.S. and Europe, as 
well as their roles in implementing human and economic 
reforms.  He concluded that the challenge now is to address 
Tunisia\'s particular concerns.  Given on-going communications 
between the foreign ministers and country leaders for this 
purpose, he expects that Tunisia may get a second shot at 
hosting.  The Ambassador thanked Qirbi for his advance 
briefing on the summit (ref e) and requested that he keep us 
informed of any developments. 
 
6. (c) Comment:  Qirbi\'s assessment of the reasons for the 
postponement overlap in some respects with Tunisia\'s private 
explanations (refs a and b), but notably did not highlight 
discord over any statements on the peace process nor the 
expected absence of key leaders.     The very nature of the 
discussions -- various proposals somewhat messily debated and 
not perfectly wrapped up with a bow -- indicate that a 
democratic process was in play in Tunis.  Qirbi\'s optimism 
that these debates will eventually produce a reasonable, 
agreed-upon result is clearly reflected in his continued 
private and public emphasis on the significant commonalties 
between the proposed reform initiatives and the Arab World\'s 
acceptance of the fact that government reforms are needed, 
even if the rate of progress toward democracy is slow and 
varies from country to country.  End comment.

goods and weapons and that President Saleh\'s February visit 
to Riyadh resulted in an agreement between the Ministries of 
Interior (refs c-d).  Although he commented favorably on 
increased security cooperation and prisoner exchanges, 
al-Mqhm insisted that there is no timeframe for a joint 
committee to meet to discuss border issues or for the pipe 
fence to be dismantled.  He expects that the issue of border 
security will be discussed at the next meeting of the 
\"Supreme Yemen-Saudi Cooperation Council,\" which he believes 
will be hosted in Riyadh, possibly as early as May 2004. 
Saudi Poloff was unable to confirm reports from ROYG 
officials of a joint border security plan that purportedly 
includes watchtowers, roads and vehicular border patrols. 
Al-Mqhm evaded questions on the now-postponed Arab League 
summit in Tunis and denied that there are any actions planned 
to follow-up on the 3/21 Saudi Foreign Minister\'s visit to 
Yemen.  End summary. 
 
POSITIVE ON COOPERATION, BUT VAGUE ON DETAILS OF NEXT STEPS 
 
2. (c) On March 27, Pol/Econ Chief met with Saudi First 
Secretary Badr Abdulmuhsen al-Mqhm to discuss plans for 
 
SIPDIS 
Yemen-Saudi cooperation.  Al-Mqhm was very positive about 
on-going security exchanges, including information and the 
recent swap of eight Yemeni nationals for five Saudis (ref 
b), but was unable to provide details on the nature of the 
information or the names of the prisoners.  Al-Mqhm was very 
open about the SAG\'s concerns about smuggling of people, 
goods, arms and cars across the Saudi-Yemen land border, and 
said that the SAG commissioned the pipe fence to prohibit 
such traffic in known problem areas.  He was adamant that the 
pipe has not been dismantled, and did not seem sure that it 
would in fact be dismantled. 
 
3. (c) When asked about the 3/21 visit of Saudi Foreign 
Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal to Sana\'a, al-Mqhm was 
noncommittal on the outcome and unable to comment on any 
follow-up to the visit.  Similarly, when questioned about the 
Arab League Summit in Tunis, he quickly changed the subject 
without providing any answer. 
 
UNABLE TO CONFIRM DETAILS OF BORDER SECURITY PLAN OUTLINED IN 
ROYG MEETINGS 
 
4. (c) At a February 24 meeting on another matter, Ministry 
of Interior Chief of Staff Brigadier General Ahmed Sunidar 
outlined a Yemen-Saudi border security plan for Pol/Econ 
Chief and CTC that included guard watchtowers on alternating 
sides of the border in an a zig-zag pattern with a road along 
the border for roving car patrols.  Citing ROYG resource 
constraints, he said that the SAG would pay for the 
infrastructure and that both countries would supply border 
guards.  Note: Responsibility for border security recently 
passed from MOD to MOI, which has formulated an ambitious 
plan for MOI border guards/security, but has not been able to 
begin implementation.  End Note. 
 
5. (c) Al-Mqhm denied that there is agreement on a plan or 
arrangements for financing any security measures, but said a 
joint committee would be formulated to discuss the matter. 
When asked about a timeframe, he said he believed the border 
issue and the establishment of the committee would be taken 
up during the next \"Yemen-Saudi Cooperation Council\" meeting 
in Riyadh, which he thought was scheduled to meet the month 
after the (now canceled) Arab League meeting in Tunis, i.e., 
in May.  Note: This is likely a reference to the Supreme 
Yemeni-Saudi Coordination Council, which meets once a year 
under the chairmanship of Yemeni PM Ba Jammal and Prince 
Sultan, the Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister.  The last 
meeting of the council was convened in Sana\'a in 7 July, 
2003, and a number of cooperation agreements were signed. 
End note.  He agreed that whatever the shape of the border 
patrol/security plan, the ROYG was likely to request the SAG 
provide significant financial assistance. 
 
COMMENT:  THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS 
 
6. (c) Comment: While there seems to be an understanding that 
a joint committee will be formulating a border security plan, 
al-Mqhm\'s statements that no committee exists is in sharp 
contrast to public statements by Yemeni FM Abu-Bakr al-Qirbi 
(ref a), and a private statement by another MFA official (ref 
c) that President Saleh\'s February 2/17-18 visit to Riyadh 
produced an agreement and a committee had been formed to 
address the border.  Even allowing that although al-Mqhm is 
well known to other Emboffs this was his initial meeting with 
Pol/Econ Chief and he may have been reluctant to go into 
detail on sensitive subjects, it does not appear that the two 
sides are fully in sync on this issue or that the Saudis are 
completely on board with the blueprint for joint monitoring 
of the border outlined to Emboffs in recent meetings with 
Yemeni officials from two separate agencies.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary: During his 3/13-15 visit to Yemen, Deputy 
Director of NEA/ARP Tom Williams discussed the Greater Middle 
East Initiative (GMEI) and Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) 
with the Deputy Foreign Minister, who critiqued the MCA 
process and indicators.  The DFM also noted his primary 
concern with the GMEI involves linkages with the 
Israel-Palestine conflict, and outlined Yemen\'s limited 
progress on Arab League reform.  CDA delivered reftel b 
points on Iraq during the meeting.  Williams visited USG 
education and cultural development projects outside Sana\'a, 
where progress was illustrated by a U.S. funded school that 
once needed a roof now requesting internet access.  He also 
discussed progress on Yemen\'s democratic reforms with 
parliamentarians, journalists and civic leaders, and met with 
business community members, who are concerned that economic 
reforms will raise prices and increase taxes (ref a). 
 
2. (C) Williams discussed increasing U.S.-Yemen development 
assistance with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC), who commented 
positively on increased bilateral cooperation.   CDA signed a 
U.S.-Yemen MOU in the amount of $1.1 million, whereby USG 
agreed to provide technical assistance and equipment to 
support the 2004 national census.  MOPIC officials are also 
interested in increasing public awareness of USG development 
efforts and the ROYG\'s economic reform package.  End Summary. 
 
US-YEMEN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE: A MODEL OF COOPERATION 
 
3. (C) Williams, along with CDA, USAID Representative, 
Pol/Econoff and PD Officer, met with Deputy Prime Minister 
and Minister of Planning and International Cooperation 
(MOPIC) Ahmed Sofan,  Nabil Shaiban, Director General for 
International Cooperation with Europe and the Americas and 
Technical Advisor Jala Yacoub on 3/15.  DPM Sofan and Shaiban 
both commented positively on the momentum of U.S.-Yemen 
development cooperation, and the need for U.S. support of 
pending ROYG economic reforms.  Sofan\'s comments on the 
economic reform package debate in Parliament and the need for 
economic, judicial and civil service reforms to improve 
Yemen\'s chances of qualifying for the Millennium Challenge 
Account (MCA) are reported in detail in reftel a. 
 
4. (U) Remarking that Yemen is \"hungry for more\" engagement, 
Shaiban said he would like to embark, along with the Embassy, 
on a public awareness campaign to promote U.S. development 
assistance in Yemen.  Shaiban, who freelances as a reporter 
and documentary producer, commented that the public strongly 
associates U.S. assistance with the military and the war on 
terror; he intends to make a short documentary for Yemeni 
television on the subject.  He also mentioned that 90 percent 
of U.S. development aid helps the Poverty Reduction Strategy 
(PRS), and that he wants to do a public presentation on the 
socio-economic impact of the assistance.  When asked how 
projects are prioritized, Shaiban responded that rural roads 
are the priority because they are \"the lifelines of 
development\" and the key to inter-community economic 
activity, i.e., girls can get to school, people can get to 
hospitals, and goods can get to market. 
 
5. (C) On 3/14, Williams met with members of the business 
community, who are worried that economic reforms will raise 
prices and who did not know the details of the new tax 
proposals (ref a). 
 
THE PRESIDENT\'S VISION FOR REGIONAL REFORM: ISRAEL-PALESTINE 
ISSUE MUST BE ADDRESSED 
 
6. (C) Williams discussed U.S. reform concepts with Deputy 
Foreign Minister Noman, who asked for more detailed 
information.  Williams and CDA responded to Noman\'s queries 
with points from reftels c and d, including the fact that 
during a recent visit to the region U/S Grossman made 
favorable references to the Sanaa Declaration. 
 
7. (C) Noman claimed that the lack of a link between the 
United States\' reform ideas and the Arab-Israeli Conflict 
raises an issue of credibility.  He stated that there is a 
misperception and everyone is suspicious of what is coming 
out of DC.  He suggested that the issue of Palestine \"holds 
the Arab world hostage,\" and said people must be convinced of 
U.S. goodwill and, therefore, any reform idea needs to take 
the Palestinian issue into account.  While saying he 
understands that reform should not wait until the problem is 
solved, Noman commented favorably on French and German 
initiatives that address this point. 
 
8. (C) Responding that credibility is not the issue, Williams 
reiterated that the regional reform concept is still being 
formulated, and that reform and efforts to address the 
Palestinian problem can move forward simultaneously.  CDA 
added that the U.S. would like to see a resolution at the 
next Arab League Summit that provides a statement in support 
of reform. 
 
MCA:  YEMEN CRITIQUES INDICATORS AS ECONOMIC REFORMS LOOM ON 
THE HORIZON 
 
9. (C) DFM Noman raised Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), 
remarking that candidates should be encouraged (see also ref 
a), and reported that the Yemeni ambassador in Washington 
told him that he attended a briefing at which he was told ten 
countries have already been chosen and Yemen would not 
qualify.  Pol/econoff noted that there may have been an 
\"unofficial tally\" of the countries, but no formal decisions 
had been made.   Explaining that this is a new process, both 
Williams and CDA encouraged Yemen to focus on maintaining 
momentum on reforms as the best means of advancing its 
candidacy. 
 
10. (C) Noman questioned the MCA indicators and complained 
that Yemen does not see the reports and analysis that are the 
basis of MCA ranking.  Pol/econoff pointed out that Freedom 
House had been to Yemen, and that Yemen had advanced in the 
democracy rating compiled by Freedom House.  Noman said that 
MCA was a tough hurdle and Yemen needs assistance to meet the 
standards.  He also expressed concern regarding Yemen\'s 
pending economic reform package and its impact on the 
populace, and said MCA would \"ease the pain\" of such reforms. 
 Williams noted that FM Al-Qirbi had made similar comments 
about the tough hurdle MCA qualification represented in his 
recent meeting with the Secretary, who had responded that the 
point of the challenge was to provide incentives for 
governments to undertake the necessary tough reforms - which 
is why it is called a challenge. 
 
ARAB LEAGUE REFORM:  YEMEN\'S LIMITED SUCCESS 
 
11. (C) Turning to Arab League reform, DFM Noman said the 
most important objective the Yemenis achieved at the recent 
Arab League Ministerial in Egypt was to change the 
decision-making vehicle to a majority vote, rather than 
consensus.  He added that some did not like the Yemeni 
proposal for an Arab League Parliament, and Yemen\'s Arab 
Security Council proposal \"was not liked by others.\"  He said 
a committee would be formed after the Tunisia Summit that 
would take a year to review all the proposals for overhaul of 
the Arab League.  Noman commented that the Saudi/Egypt/Syria 
proposal was more a statement of principles than a call for 
reform. 
 
12. (C) During the meeting with Noman, CDA delivered relevant 
reftel b points on transition and progress towards a 
democratic and prosperous Iraq.  Noman favorably received the 
information and subsequently requested that the USG provide 
the compendium in Arabic. 
 
DEMOCRACY:  PROGRESS, BUT POLITICAL WILL FOR REFORM NOT 
ALWAYS STRONG 
 
13. (U) At 3/14 lunch, Williams and select members of 
parliament (MPs), journalists, and civil society discussed 
Yemen\'s democratic experiment, particularly the need for 
parliamentary reform.  Several MP\'s from both the majority 
political party (GPC) and the main opposition party (Islah) 
noted the lack of knowledge and skills of many MPs who need 
training, and requested assistance for Parliament.  Attendees 
commented that reform needs to continue, but political will 
is not always strong and donor assistance and encouragement 
would help.  Looking at press freedom and case of Saed Thabet 
-- the MPs went to the court in support of Thabet -- one MP 
said that while press freedom in Yemen is better than 
elsewhere in the region, there is still a long way to go. 
 
USG DEVELOPMENT PROMOTES EDUCATION AND PRESERVES CULTURE 
 
14. (U) On 3/15, Williams visited a girls\' school in Amran 
built with money from USDA\'s 416(b) program.  (Note:  The 
school opened in 2003, at a final cost of $244,333.  End 
Note).  Officials told Williams that, since its opening, 
enrollment has risen over 200 percent due largely to the fact 
that it is a single-sex school and more families have allowed 
their daughters to attend.  Students at the school were 
enthusiastic and eager, stating that they want computers and 
internet access to learn about the world.  The same day, 
Williams met with women at the Yemen Adult Life Skills and 
Literacy Education Project in Amran to discuss their 
activities and the women also stated that they would like to 
have computers.  Williams\' final development site visit was 
to an infrastructure project in Thula, a nearby village, 
where USG assistance repaved the town\'s historical main 
entrance. 
 
ASSISTANCE TO THE YEMENI CENSUS 
 
15. (U) CDA, AID Representative, DPM, and the Chairman of the 
Central Statistics Organization, Dr. Amin Muheeddin, signed a 
\"Memorandum of Understanding Between The Republic of Yemen, 
Central Statistical Organization, and the United States of 
America, Agency for International Development, for 
Cooperation to Support the 2004 Census of Population and the 
Decentralization of Statistical Information.\"  Comment:  USG 
is the lead donor for Yemen\'s national census, which will 
provide data essential for the ROYG to achieve its poverty 
reduction and decentralization goals and to improve 
development planning, economic growth, civil registration, 
elections, good governance, democratization, and investment. 
USG assistance to the ROYG Central Statistical Organization 
will be provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census with ESF 
funding programmed by USAID/Yemen.   End Comment.

SUBJECT: PRESENTATION OF INCOMING LEGATT TO MINISTER OF 
INTERIOR 
 
Classified By: CTC AUSTIN G. GILREATH, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (U) Summary:  On 27 March 2004, The Ambassador met with 
ROYG Minister of the Interior Rashad al-Alimi to present 
newly arrived LEGATT and discuss security subjects.  Alimi 
warmly welcomed LEGATT, and listed a number of issues on 
which MOI sought cooperation with LEGATT.  Also present at 
the meeting were MOI Office Director Sunidar, DCM, ARSO and 
Embassy Counterterrorism Coordinator.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
LEGATT WELL-RECEIVED 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C)  Minister Alimi welcomed LEGATT warmly and stated 
that a new chapter of cooperation was beginning in ROYG-USG 
relations.  Alimi identified MOI Office Director General 
Sunidar as the LEGATT\'s primary point of contact for future 
interaction.  As a first instance of cooperation, Alimi 
requested LEGATT/FBI assistance in investigating the case of 
a Yemeni arrested in December 2003 who confessed to stabbing 
three foreigners (none U.S. citizens) in Sana\'a.  The man 
claimed extreme religious views and was found to be in 
possession of $60,000 USD, but the MOI was unclear as to his 
true motives or connection to outside financial support and 
requested assistance to include a possible polygraph 
examination.  Alimi further requested LEGATT assistance in 
the formation of MOI\'s nascent counter-terrorism unit and CT 
Operations Center. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
OTHER SECURITY ISSUES 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (U)  The Ambassador informed Alimi that the 
American-supplied Yemeni Coast Guard (YCG) boats would be 
officially commissioned in a ceremony in Aden on 7 April 
2004.  The YCG would assume total responsibility for 
maintaining maritime security on the two refineries and free 
port zone in Aden.  The Ambassador and Alimi both agreed that 
the YCG would serve well to increase interest and 
international support in Yemeni maritime security issues. 
 
4. (C)  The Ambassador thanked Alimi for the additional 
security provided by the MOI to the Embassy in March during 
the ROYG\'s highly successful CT/security operations in Abyan 
and during the aftermath of the Shaykh Yassin assassination. 
 
5. (C)  The Ambassador briefed Alimi on the proposed 
INL-sponsored anti-riot training module that would be 
provided to police forces in Sana\'a.  Alimi was very 
receptive to the proposed training and acknowledged that it 
was sorely needed given past performance.  (Comment:  Alimi 
was likely referring to anti-U.S. demonstrations that 
occurred approximately 1/4 mile from the Embassy on March 2, 
2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, resulting in the death 
of several protesters and injuries to police.  End comment) 
 
6.  (U)  CT Coordinator briefed Alimi on an upcoming Export 
and Border Security (EXBS) Conference to be held in Malta on 
11-14 May, and invited the ROYG to identify 4-6 individuals 
for sponsored participation.  Alimi responded favorably. 
 
7. (C)  The Ambassador briefed Alimi that the Embassy would 
be holding a regional chiefs of mission conference in Sana\'a 
in late April.  Alimi commented that such a conference was a 
positive step and would be well-received.  He offered 
assurance of security escorts and assistance as needed. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
IRAN EXPLOITING YASSIN ASSASSINATION 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8. (C)  Alimi told the Ambassador that recent extremist 
activity and anti-U.S. vitriol at the grand mosques in Sa\'dah 
and Sana\'a was due to Government of Iran (GOI) involvement. 
Alimi said the GOI was providing instructors and financial 
assistance to elements who sought to exploit and expound 
anti-Western sentiment, particularly in the aftermath of the 
Yassin assassination. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
ABU SHAHEED FOLLOW-UP 
------------------------------------------ 
9. (C)  Alimi confirmed that the Political Security 
Organization (PSO) had recently arrested Abu al-Shaheed and 
had begun questioning him on his involvement in terrorist 
activities in Yemen.  Alimi commented that Shaheed had openly 
wept during interrogation and expressed his desire at 
reconciliation.  Alimi said he himself had interviewed 
Shaheed, but that Shaheed remained in PSO custody.  Because 
Shaheed had given himself up after negotiations with ROYG 
Security Forces, and was cooperating with interrogators, 
Alimi said he believed that this may indicate a positive 
future trend in which those suspected of terrorist activities 
would turn themselves in rather than be subjected to ROYG 
manhunts.

1. (s) On April 7, Pol/Econ Chief discussed reftel guidance 
on U.S. policy on nations\' non-lethal military equipment 
exports to Libya with MFA\'s Deputy Chief of the Arab World 
Department, Plenipotentiary Minister Saleh al-Nashad.  As in 
previous meetings, al-Nashad expressed interest in U.S. 
intentions toward Libya, but was not surprised that the U.S. 
has not lifted its prohibitions on U.S. defense sales to 
Libya.  He also asked about Libya\'s removal from the state 
sponsors of terrorism list.  Pol/Econ Chief responded that 
IEEPA sanctions on Libya remain in place and that the U.S. is 
closely monitoring Libya\'s progress in fulfilling its 
commitments, especially with respect to terrorism and human 
rights.  Note:  Reftel b points on the extension of IEEPA 
were delivered by Pol/Econ Chief and Poloff on January 7 to 
al-Nashad, who provided no substantive comment at the time. 
End note. 
 
2. (s) Al-Nashad confirmed that trade between Yemen and Libya 
is limited and assured Pol/Econ Chief that Yemen does not 
intend to provide any lethal military equipment or 
WMD-related materials to Libya.  He joked that any press 
reports of Yemen sending military items to Libya are 
completely false.  Comment:  This was likely a reference to 
December 2003 reporting in a Spanish paper that Yemen 
purportedly delivered scud missiles to Libya.  The allegation 
was soundly denounced by the ROYG\'s official Saba news agency 
as \"baseless and fabricated,\" which added that the shipment, 
intercepted by the Spanish navy in December 2002, remained in 
the possession of the Yemeni military.\"  End comment.

1. (u) This is an action request. Please see para 6. 
 
2. (u) Post received original PLC request in reftel on March 
8.  The purchaser is the Fadel Al-Husseini Trading Group. 
The enduser is the Republican Guard of Yemen.  The enduser 
site is the training and storage facilities of the Yemeni 
Republican Guard camps. 
 
3. (sbu) Fadel Al-Husseini, the chairman of the purchasing 
company, in consultation with the Republican Guard, arranged 
for the extrancheck on March 21.  On March 20, twelve hours 
before the inspection, a Republican Guard officer informed 
the Commerce Specialist that the Embassy should request the 
meeting directly from the Republican Guard.  On March 21, 
Post sent a letter requesting assistance from the Republican 
Guard via fax to the Office of Commander, Staff Colonel Ahmed 
Ali Abudllah Saleh. 
 
4. (sbu) On March 24, Fadel Al-Husseini provided the bill of 
lading and receipts to Post\'s Commercial Office.  That same 
day, al-Husseini also faxed a letter to arrange an 
appointment for the inspection.  After several calls, 
however, a Republican Guard officer told Commercial 
Specialist to send diplomatic note to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs requesting that the Ministry of Defense work with the 
U.S. Embassy to schedule the inspection of the cargo trucks 
and its facilities for cargo truck maintenance. 
 
5. (sbu) On March 31, Post delivered a dipnote to the MFA 
requesting assistance from the Ministry of Defense.  That 
same day Emboffs met with Major Mohammed al-Arar, Director of 
Equipment at the Republican Guard camp outside of Sanaa. 
During the meeting, Emboffs discussed the requirements of the 
extrancheck, explained why the USG performs extranchecks, and 
offered to connect Arar with other Yemeni organizations and 
companies who have experienced an extrancheck so he could be 
more familiar with the process.  During a one hour meeting, 
Emboffs requested to see the cargo trucks the Republican 
Guard purchased and the maintenance shop.  Arar pointed out 
the window to cargo trucks approximately 200 yards away and 
said, \"see, there they are.\"  When Emboffs asked to get 
closer to the trucks, Arar at first refused.  Later, Arar 
agreed Emboffs could see cargo trucks, but said they needed 
to go to a camp 20 kilometers away on an unpaved road. 
Emboffs told Arar that they wanted to examine the cargo truck 
at the second site.  After making a phone call, Arar said 
Emboffs could not see the trucks, the maintenance shop nor 
the camp. 
 
6. (sbu) Comment/Action request:  The Republican Guard has 
been somewhat cooperative, but is hesitant to allow Post to 
inspect their existing cargo trucks and facilities.  USDOC 
office in Abu Dhabi confirms that the site check for the 
trucks and the parts previously purchased are essential to 
this pre-license check.  Post has actively pursued 
investigating this matter, but due to bureaucratic delays 
cannot meet the April 7 deadline.  Post requests four 
additional weeks to see the Republican Guard site before 
submitting a definitive response to the extrancheck request.

REF: STATE 75508 
 
 1. (SBU) Ambassador, accompanied by LEGATT and NCIS rep, 
carried out demarche reftel with Minister of Interior Alimi 
on Wednesday, April 7.  Ambassador noted his intention to 
reiterate points to prosecutor general early week of April 
10.  Alimi confirmed that prosecutor general is appropriate

2. (SBU) In response to Ambassador\'s request for rendition of

that it would prosecute, but not render Yemeni citizens 
accused of terrorist acts.  In turn, Alimi requested that USG 
render to Yemen for prosecution Nashiri and Khalad bin

these individuals as they continue to provide important 
intelligence on al-Qa\'ida.  Alimi speculated that the ROYG 
might try them in absentia. 
 
3. (SBU) Alimi expressed ROYG desire to cooperate fully with 
USG in pending prosecutions where US citizens are victims. 
He noted Yemeni law accords victims\' families or 
representatives extensive privileges, including presence at 
trial and sharing of prosecution\'s information.  When 
Ambassador inquired about continued access to defendants, 
Alimi replied that is a question for the prosecutor general 
to resolve. 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT:  Embassy/FBI/NCIS have some experience with 
Yemeni prosecution procedures based on trial in Ibb of 
murderer of US medical personnel in December 2002.  FBI rep 
was present during this trial and gained significant access 
to prosecution\'s case file, but not access to defendant 
himself.  We will be following up with prosecutor general to 
gain specifics for upcoming trials and possible access to 
detainees.

1. (c) Summary:  On 4/10, Ambassador and Pol/Econ Chief met 
with Minister of Human Rights Amat al-Alim al-Suswah at her 
request to discuss the ROYG\'s response to the 2003 Human 
Rights Report (HRR), additional ROYG actions to quantify and 
combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP), the Amnesty 
International (AI) delegation visit and her proposed trip to 
Washington  in May to accept an award and meet Department 
officials and NGOs.  Al-Suswah handed over new data from the 
Ministry of Interior on cases of women and children being 
trafficked and gave a progress report that reflects increased 
cooperation within the ROYG on current investigations and 
on-going or pending prosecutions; she was receptive to the 
Ambassador\'s message not to punish the victims but the 
persecutors.  Ambassador and the Minister agreed that the 
message to AI should reflect Yemen\'s progress on human rights 
in tandem with increasing counter-terrorism cooperation and 
security.  Both were critical of inaccurate press reporting 
and discussed their attempts at remedial action.  Ambassador 
provided a copy of the April 2004 Freedom House report on 
Yemen.  End summary. 
 
TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN AND CHILDREN:  INTERAGENCY COOPERATION, 
ON-GOING INVESTIGATIONS, PROSECUTIONS EXPECTED 
 
2. (c) Apologizing that she still does not have complete 
information on some of the issues raised during preparations 
for input for the TIP report, al-Suswah provided 
documentation (in Arabic) that she received from the Ministry 
of Interior (MOI).  Note: This information is being 
translated and reviewed by the Embassy; the Minister 
specifically requested that the names of victims and 
perpetrators be withheld to protect their privacy.  End note. 
 The Minister explained that for the first time, the MOI has 
coordinated with other ROYG entities to record the cases of 
women and children being trafficked in three governorates 
(Hajjah, Mahwhit, and Saada) from 2002 to 2003. 
 
3. (c) Al-Suswah commented that the TIP phenomenon in Yemen 
is still new, and that the root of the problem is poverty. 
She described most of the children\'s cases as a desperate 
economic measure by families forced to send children outside 
the country to beg.  Al-Suswah remarked that this practice is 
prohibited by Yemeni law, and said that the vast majority of 
children identified by the MOI have already been returned 
home and the cases are being prosecuted.  She also cited a 
recent public announcement by the Ministry of Social Affairs, 
which is launching a Child Protection Program aimed at 
providing care, rehabilitation and education services to 
needy children. 
 
4. (c) She characterized the majority of the women\'s cases as 
involving prostitution which, in addition to prompting moral 
objections and religious prohibitions, is also against the 
law.  Acknowledging the change in visa policy for Iraqis (ref 
b), al-Suswah said that Yemen\'s \"eyes are open to address 
issues,\" but that the problems are complex.  Stating that 
there have been 13 deportations of women involved in 
prostitution, mostly due to health concerns, Al-Suswah 
advocated for clear legal measures and coordination among 
security agencies to address the issue, and assured the 
Ambassador that the ROYG is commited to tracing the source of 
the problem and to prosecuting perpetrators.  She expressed 
that the criminals engaged in this activity are not 
well-organized or well-established.  Ambassador emphasized 
that the focus should be on punishing the criminals, rather 
than the victims.  He also indicated that preliminary 
responses from Washington were supportive of Yemen\'s efforts, 
that it is unlikely that Yemen will be named in any of the 
tiers, and that it needs to continue to pursue the issue and 
put pressure on the traffickers. 
 
MESSAGE FOR AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL:  HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
SECURITY, NOT A ZERO-SUM GAME 
 
5. (c) The Minister shared her thoughts -- and the text of 
her opening remarks -- on the 2-day conference co-sponsored 
by Amnesty International (AI) and the Yemeni National 
Organization for Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms (HOOD) 
to focus attention and organize in support of the detainees 
at Guantanamo and in Yemen.  She said that she tried to be 
diplomatic in her message that it is possible to balance 
human rights and security interests.  She was pleased that 
the AI delegation arrived after the announcement that the USS 
Cole attackers will be prosecuted.  Al-Suswah expressed her 
approval of the dialogue process headed by Judge al-Hitar 
(ref e) to educate detainees that they have no right to 
jihad, but mentioned that conference attendees were vocal in 
their opinion that the ROYG is unfairly detaining suspected 
terrorist activists. 
 
6. (c) Ambassador mentioned that he would be meeting with the 
AI that afternoon (septel).  He and al-Suswah agreed that 
they want to convey substantially the same message:  Terror 
is a world-wide problem with no easy solution, but there can 
be a balance between security and human rights and over the 
past two years Yemen has proven that a country can make 
progress on Human Rights and counter-terrorism.  The Minister 
said that the Ministry is arranging meetings for the 
delegates with the Presidential Office, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, the Presidential Security Office (PSO) and 
the Ministry of Justice; she noted that the Ministry of 
Interior declined to meet with the delegation. 
 
HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT RECEIVED WITH \"RESPECT\" - FREEDOM OF THE 
PRESS REQUIRES RESPONSIBILITY 
 
7. (c) Minister al-Suswah said that, except for the Women\'s 
National Committee, she has received all the government\'s 
comments on the HRR.  Saying the report has been received 
with \"respect, she requested a joint meeting or press 
conference in conjunction with the Ambassador once she has 
compiled all of the reactions.  Ambassador responded that we 
benefit from the comments and he is pleased with Yemeni 
efforts to improve the dialogue. 
 
8. (c) Al-Suswah complained that the state Saba News agency 
misrepresented the HRR as \"full of lies.\"  Upon 
investigation, she said she learned the journalist used the 
previous year\'s printed description to improperly 
characterize the 2003 HRR.  Accordingly, she requested a 
published correction to reflect that the report is favorable 
toward Yemen.  She expounded that journalists should be 
punished for false reporting, but are not properly trained 
and often unduly influenced by political affiliations.  The 
Minister is planning to meet with the journalists syndicate 
to discuss the future of the press and the laws governing it, 
especially so-called \"crimes\" of the press, and to begin to 
develop a \"charter of ethics\" for journalists. 
 
9. (c) Ambassador relayed a recent problem Post had with the 
moderate Islamist weekly mouthpiece for the Popular Forces 
Union Party, al-Shura, publishing inflammatory reports on the 
anniversary of the March 2003 anti-war demonstrations at the 
Embassy (ref a).  He emphasized that ROYG forces only 
returned fire when fired upon and did not instigate the 
resulting violence.  Ambassador noted that the Post\'s PAO 
wrote an explanatory letter that was published, but only with 
defensive commentary.  Ambassador and al-Suswah agreed that 
the media should not create its own version of history and 
that security forces should be credited for acting 
appropriately and admonished and corrected if they act 
improperly. 
 
FREEDOM HOUSE REPORT CITES YEMEN AS \"AN EXAMPLE FOR THE 
ARABIAN PENINSULA\" 
 
10. (c) Ambassador shared the newly-released Freedom House 
report on 30 countries at the crossroads of reform (available 
at www.freedomhouse.org/research/crossroads/cac. htm).  He 
commented favorably on Minister al-Suswah\'s facilitation of 
the September 2003 visit by consultant Brian Katulis, who 
drafted the report. 
 
MINISTER TO TRAVEL TO ISTANBUL IN APRIL AND WASHINGTON IN MAY 
 
11. (c) Al-Suswah stated she is attending the Congress of 
Democrats from the Islamic World (CDIW), organized by the 
National Democratic Institute, along with FM Abu Bakr 
al-Qirbi, Presidential Advisor Abdul Karim al-Iryani, the 
Chairman of the Supreme Committee on Election and Referenda, 
and influential representatives from the three main political 
parties.  She said she also plans to travel to Washington, DC 
around May 15 to receive an award, along with three other 
women, from Vital Voices.  The Minister is planning to stay 
several additional days for meetings with the Department and 
NGOs.  She expressed regret that she missed meeting U/S 
Dobriansky in Geneva in March, but understood how difficult 
it can be to connect during conferences.  Ambassador pledged 
assistance in facilitating her travel and appointments.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S 4/10 MEETING WITH AMNESTY 
INTERNATIONAL DELEGATION 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull 
 
1. (sbu/nf) Summary:  In a lengthy 4/10 meeting with 
Ambassador, a four-person Amnesty International delegation 
appealed for increased information and access for the 
families of Yemenis detained at Guantanamo.  The far-ranging 
and amicable discussion included Yemen\'s progress on the 
mutually-reinforcing goals of counter-terrorism cooperation 
and human rights, the detention of Yemenis in country, 
training of Yemeni law enforcement and security personnel and 
the imminent trials of a number of suspects in the 2000 
terrorist attack on the U.S. Cole.  AI\'s pitch for increased 
access included complaints that Washington inquiries are not 
being answered and that human rights groups, pleas for 
access to Guantanamo have been denied.  Ambassador advised 
delegation to work through and to try to improve the existing 
channel provided by the International Red Cross for 
information on detainees.  When pressed for a conduit in 
Washington on this issue, the Ambassador recommended 
Ambassador Pierre Prosper (S/WCI) as an interlocutor.  The 
delegation was in Sana\'a April 10-11 to attend a 2-day 
conference on \"Human Rights for All\" organized by AI and a 
Yemeni human rights organization.  All agreed that the 
discussion was off the record and that any public statement 
by AI would be provided to the Ambassador for his review 
prior to its release.  End Summary. 
 
FAMILIES OF GUANTANAMO DETAINEES ARE \"SUFFERING\" FROM LACK OF 
INFORMATION/CONTACT 
 
2. (sbu/nf) The delegation, led by human rights campaigner 
Dr. Terry Waite (well-known as a hostage negotiator illegally 
detained in Lebanon for almost five years), requested the 
appointment with the Ambassador to discuss the human rights 
situation in Yemen post-9/11.  Other delegation members were 
Researcher (North America) Rob Freer, Researcher (Middle 
East) Dr. Lamri Chirouf and AI USA Board of Director Member 
Farah Brelvi; Pol/Econ Chief was present as notetaker.  Dr. 
Waite opened by stating that the families of the Guantanamo 
detainees, who are being held without regard for due process, 
are suffering from a lack of information and that he is also 
concerned about the damage the situation is causing to the 
U.S. image as a \"defender of freedom and human rights.\" 
Freer also complained that it took over a year to get a 
denial in response to AI\'s request for access to Guantanamo. 
When the delegation asked about ROYG visits to Guantanamo, 
the Ambassador told them that there was one visit for both 
consular and intelligence purposes. 
 
3. (sbu/nf) The delegation spoke extensively about the 
families and lawyers they interacted with at the first day of 
the conference, \"Human Rights for All,\" hosted by AI in 
cooperation with the Yemeni National Organization for Defense 
of Human Rights and Freedoms (HOOD).  (Note:  In addition to 
lawyers and families of detainees, attendees included human 
rights activists from the U.S., Canada, Australia and other 
Gulf States.)  In the opening ceremony, Amat al-Alim 
al-Suswah, Minister of Human Rights, delivered a speech 
noting September 11\'s affect on human rights and that that 
Yemen has been economically and politically harmed by 
terrorist acts such as the attacks on the USS Cole and the 
Limburgh, a French oil tanker.  (Note: Ambassador\'s 4/10 
meeting with al-Suswah reported septel.)  They also noted 
that over a third of Guantanamo detainees are from Gulf 
countries and estimated that there are 85 Yemenis being held. 
 Ambassador commented that Yemen\'s hosting of the event is a 
positive development given the \"allergy in the region to 
international human rights groups.\" 
 
4. (sbu/nf) Ambassador broadened the discussion to include 
the improved human rights situation in Yemen and chastised 
the international human rights organizations that write 
reports on Yemen \"at a distance,\" failing to focus on the 
progress as well as the problems.  He suggested an alternate 
approach that covers the full spectrum of issues and presents 
a more accurate, balanced picture.  Acknowledging significant 
progress on rights in Yemen over the past ten years, Dr. 
Chirouf said that he fears that post-9/11 there is a risk 
that these benefits will \"disappear completely.\"  When 
Ambassador noted a number of areas of success, i.e., women\'s 
freedoms, electoral reforms, more open press, membership in 
international conventions, and the institutionalization of 
human rights, Dr. Chirouf admitted that AI\'s concern is 
arrests and detentions. 
 
5. (sbu/nf) Even after the Ambassador explained that the 
Department of Defense is responsible for the process at 
Guantanamo, the delegation requested that he press Washington 
for more information for the families.  Ambassador strongly 
encouraged AI and the families to work through and to try and 
strengthen existing channels of communication established by 
the International Red Cross (IRC), which has been given 
access to Guantanamo.  Freer noted dissatisfaction because 
information from IRC is limited by its own policies and by 
measures to address security concerns that make the system 
less effective, e.g., requirements that prisoners write 
letters in English, even though many lack any proficiency in 
the language.  When pushed to provide a name in Washington, 
the Ambassador suggested AI contact Ambassador Pierre Prosper 
for information on the process.  He also promised to convey 
the delegation\'s concerns on behalf of the families back to 
Washington. 
 
U.S.-YEMEN SECURITY COOPERATION AND PROGRESS ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
- NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE 
 
6. (sbu/nf) Dr. Waite and Freer commented on U.S.-Yemen 
security cooperation and the November 2002 drone attack that 
left five dead.  Ambassador emphasized that the U.S. is at 
war against al-Qaida and explained that the action was taken 
in full cooperation with the ROYG, against known al-Qaida 
operatives after previous attempts to apprehend the 
terrorists left 18 Yemenis dead.  Citing the progress on both 
rights and security, the Ambassador commented that Yemen is 
an example of how counter-terrorism efforts and human rights 
can be mutually reinforcing.  Dr. Waite countered that Yemen 
is detaining people and complained that it is doing so under 
pressure from the U.S.  Ambassador pointed out that Yemen has 
repeatedly privately and publicly stated that it is in its 
own security and economic interests to fight terror.  After 
extensive discussion, there was an agreement to disagree 
given the divergent viewpoints on the balance between 
security cooperation and human rights. 
 
7. (sbu/nf) Dr. Chirouf inquired about press reports that 800 
people have been arrested for making anti-American statements 
at the Grand Mosque in Sana\'a during Friday prayers. 
Ambassador requested that AI tell anyone who asks that this 
was not done at his direction and that we have not been given 
any information about the incidents.  Brelvi specifically 
requested that the Ambassador make a statement against the 
arrests. 
 
U.S. TRAINING OF YEMENI LAW ENFORCEMENT/SECURITY FORCES 
ENHANCES HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
8. (sbu/nf) Dr. Chirouf also asked whether the FBI or USG law 
enforcement has been permitted to interrogate the Yemenis 
detained by the ROYG.  Ambassador made clear that he was not 
at liberty to discuss details of intelligence cooperation, 
but elaborated on the U.S. role in providing programs, 
training and equipment to improve law enforcement 
capabilities and security information sharing. 
 
9. (sbu/nf) Brelvi produced a letter to the Ambassador 
concerning the Leahy Law requirement that Post maintain a 
database on human rights violations committed by local 
security forces and asked about Post\'s practices in this 
regard.  (Note: Ambassador did not receive the letter prior 
to the meeting, but assured the delegation Post will review 
current practices to ensure full compliance with legal 
requirements.)  Dr. Chirouf expressed particular concern 
about the Presidential Security Office (PSO), which he claims 
operates extra-judicially and is responsible for 
legally-deficient deportations (reported in AI\'s September 
2003 report) and improper detentions and interrogations. 
Ambassador explained that Post carefully vets candidates for 
training and U.S.-provided programming.  On the issue of 
deportations, the Ambassador commented that the ROYG had 
sufficient cause to review the immigration status of students 
and found that a number were out of status or pursuing a 
course of Islamic extremism.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, PREL, IZ, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM 
SUBJECT: YEMEN TO TRY TERRORISTS/COLE BOMBING SUSPECTS 
 
1.  (U) Summary:  On 11 April 2004, The Ambassador met with 
ROYG Attorney General (AttGen) Dr. Abdullah Al-Ulfi to 
discuss progress on turning over terrorist cases for 
prosecution, formally request rendition of Cole Bombing 
suspects Al-Badawi and Al-Quso, and to request/offer USG 
participation in any upcoming trials.  The AttGen told the 
Ambassador that 15 individuals involved in 5 cases (2000 Cole 
bombing, 2002 Qadissiya attack, 2002 Hunt Oil Company 
helicopter attack, 2003 plot to assassinate the Ambassador, 
2002 M/V Limburg bombing) were to be prosecuted in the near 
term by the ROYG Prosecutor General.  The meeting concluded 
with a discussion of access to the prosecution team and their 
evidence against the accused, and an offer of 
assistance/sharing of evidence gathered by U.S. investigatory 
bodies.  Also present were ROYG Justice Ministry Chief of 
Staff Ahmad Al-Jundubi, LEGATT, FPD and Embassy 
Counterterrorism Coordinator.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
RENDITION OF BADAWI AND QUSO 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  The Ambassador formally presented the USG\'s request 
for rendition of U.S.S. Cole bombing suspects Jamal Muhammad 
Ahmad  Ali Al-Badawi and Fahd Muhammad Ahmad al-Quso.  As 
these two men have been specifically charged with acts of 
terrorism against American targets, the USG has interest to 
see them tried in the United States.  Failing rendition, the 
Ambassador requested a swift trial in the Yemeni courts 
system for the same crimes. 
 
3.  (U)  The AttGen told the Ambassador that rendition 
remained a constitutional issue, but that all requests would 
be taken under advisement.  The AttGen requested that such a 
request be followed-up in a diplomatic note and routed 
through the MFA.  (note:  the Embassy is doing so.  End 
note.) 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
TRANSFER OF CASES 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4. (U)  The AttGen informed the Ambassador that his office 
had formed a special team on 8 April to receive the transfer 
of files on 15 individuals currently incarcerated in 
Political Security Organization (PSO) jails for charges of 
terrorism.   The prisoners were to remain in PSO custody 
throughout the trial period.  Transfer of all files was 
expected to be completed on/about 15 April.  This team would 
then review the files in preparation for transfer to 
individual prosecutors.  These prosecutors would then 
supervise the cases through the investigation (which began on 
10 April) and trial phases.  Modeled on the French system, 
two different judges would preside over 
pre-trial/investigation period and the actual trial itself. 
Venue for trial was not yet decided but was expected to be 
either the criminal court or the court of appeals, both 
secure locations.  When pressed for a notional timeline for 
onset/completion of the trials, the AttGen demurred but said 
that 6-8 weeks was possible.  He made clear to the Ambassador 
that the trials would be swift and just.  The AttGen 
recommended USG hire a Yemeni lawyer to assist US team. 
 
5.  (U)  The 5 cases are:  the attack on the U.S.S. Cole of 
October 12, 2000; the plot against American interests which 
culminated in the explosion in the Al-Qadisiyya district of 
Sana\'a on August 9, 2002; the plot to assassinate the 
Ambassador circa Fall/Winter 2002; the rocket attack on the 
Hunt Oil Company helicopter of November 3, 2002; the bombing 
of the M/V Limburg October 6, 2002. (note:  The Embassy 
requested the identities of the 15 charged with these crimes 
in a diplomatic note sent on 13 April, 2004.  End note.) 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
USG PARTICIPATION IN THE TRIALS 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (U)  Speaking generally, the AttGen told the Ambassador 
that the ROYG Justice Ministry was open to any requests made 
by the Embassy regarding access during the trials and would 
do its best to include American representatives.  This 
participation would be based in two capacities:  access as 
representation of the victims and access as assistance to the 
prosecution.  Of the former, appropriate and named 
representatives for the victims would be allowed 
participation via the prosecutor to bring questions against 
the accused, present and view existing evidence, and would 
have a role in sentencing.  The AttGen noted that these 
privileges were standard in the Yemeni court system and did 
not constitute an exceptional request.  Concerning assistance 
to the prosecution, the LEGATT suggested that the Embassy 
would present one team of experts from the FBI and Department 
of Justice that would interact and liaise with the 
prosecution team, share evidence and provide forensic 
assistance as required.  NCIS would also be represented on 
the team for all trials of Cole suspects. 
 
7.  (U) Action requested:  USG should constitute ASAP a team 
to represent USG and victims\' interests in all phases of the 
judicial investigation, trial and sentencing.  The official 
U.S. representation should have a written mandate from or on 
behalf of the victims to document that role.  Official USG 
representation should be assigned for the duration of the 
process -- one team from beginning to end.  Embassy will 
designate LEGATT and NCIS representatives as its 
representatives.  DOJ/FBI should also prepare for sharing 
with Yemeni prosecutors appropriate evidence or documents to 
strengthen prosecution in cases where we have such materials.

1. (c) On April 12, Pol/Econ Chief met with Ministry of

Abdul-Malik Abdul-Ghani Saleh and his Deputy, Dirham al-Saidi 
to review the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) 
Statement of Interdiction Principles (SOP) and request that 
the ROYG make a public statement of support for both in 
advance of the anniversary meeting in Krakow (ref a). 
Pol/Econ Chief provided an additional copy of the questions 
and answers on PSI (ref d) and reminded Saleh and al-Saidi 
that the previous director had assured her that the 
information on PSI was passed to the responsible parties in 
the foreign minister\'s office, the prime ministry, and the

earlier requests for the ROYG\'s views on how the principles 
could be incorporated into counter-terrorism efforts, as well 
as whether there are legal or other impediments to supporting 
PSI or the SOP.  Saleh and al-Saidi did not provide any 
substantive comment, but requested the SOP in Arabic as soon 
as possible.  On April 13, however, al-Saidi called Pol/Econ 
Chief to confirm that the USG request had been forwarded to 
the Foreign Minister. 
 
2. (c) Neither Saleh nor al-Saidi were aware of the September 
2003 letter from the UK Ambassador to Yemen to FM Qirbi 
requesting that Yemen publicly support the PSI.  On April 14, 
Pol/Econ Chief spoke with British Ambassador Frances Guy, who 
confirmed that the UK has not received a response to either 
her September 14, 2003, meeting with FM Qirbi or the 
subsequent letter.  She said she followed-up with Deputy 
Foreign Minister for Europe, the Americas and International

yet delivered on his assurances to get her a response. 
 
3. (c) Comment:  The lack of any response, despite US efforts 
and UK appeals directly to the FM, indicates that Yemen may 
not be entirely comfortable with the PSI and its SOP.  Post 
will continue to work with our British counterparts and other 
G-8 partners, as appropriate, to seek Yemeni support for the 
initiative.  End comment.

1. (c) Pol/Econ Chief delivered reftel talking points to 
Deputy Foreign Minister for Europe, the Americas and 
International Organizations Mustapha Noman on 4/21.  Saying 
that he just signed off on a memo regarding Yemen\'s 
participation, Noman strongly hinted that Yemen would be 
represented at the OIC meeting in Kuala Lumpur, but probably 
not at the Foreign Minister level. 
 
2. (c) On the issue of UN envoy Brahimi and his mission, 
Noman noted that Brahimi is a well-respected, personal friend 
and that he expected Yemen, and the OIC, to support his 
efforts.  (Comment:  Brahimi is well-known in Yemen because 
he was a UN envoy during Yemen\'s 1994 civil war.  End 
Comment.)  Noman focused on the point \"we support Israel\'s 
right to defend itself\" and responded that Yemen also 
supports Israel\'s right to defend itself, but \"within its own 
borders.\" 
 
3. (c) Noman delivered a strong message on the U.S. 
administration\'s public position and announcements on 
Palestine-Israel.  He criticized the language of the demarche 
as inappropriate because different words were used to 
describe similar acts, e.g., Israel\'s assassinations of 
Shaykh Yassin and Rantisi are not called \"terrorist acts.\"

1. (c) Summary: On 4/21, Pol/Econ Chief delivered talking 
points (ref b) and GMEI paper package (ref c) to DFM Noman. 
While pledging to support the reforms, Noman\'s initial 
reaction included a reminder that the USG\'s credibility vis a 
vis reform is being adversely impacted by the 
Administration\'s public statements on the Israel-Palestine 
issue and the recent killing of Hamas leaders.  Specifically, 
he criticized the lack of a strong condemnation of Israel 
following the Rantisi assassination.  Embassy Sana\'a will be 
taking broad soundings -- including the ROYG, civil society, 
NGOs and businesspeople -- on GMEI to provide further 
reporting in advance of the June Sea Island meeting.  End 
summary. 
 
GMEI REFORMS IMPORTANT, BUT U.S. HAS \"ALIENATED\" THE ARAB 
WORLD BY FAILING TO CONDEMN ISRAELI VIOLENCE 
 
2. (c) Before he even reviewed the GMEI papers, the Deputy 
Foreign Minister for Europe, the Americas and International 
Organizations Mustapha Noman launched into concerns that the 
GMEI will get mired down in a debate about the U.S. position 
on Israel-Palestine.  He said the U.S. Administration\'s 
statements following the Bush-Sharon meeting, and the Rantisi 
assassination less than 48-hours later (and only 72-hours 
after Egyptian President Mubarak left the U.S.) make it 
difficult for liberals, such as himself, to push forward 
reforms.  Even after Pol/Econ Chief reiterated that reform 
cannot be held hostage to the Arab-Israeli peace process, he 
maintained that any reforms labeled U.S. are unlikely to be 
supported, even if parties agree with the ideas.  Without a 
shift in U.S. public statements, he does not believe the 
opposition parties in Yemen will support adopting the ideas 
in the GMEI, even if they support the principles.  (Comment: 
This is in sharp contrast to what Post has heard from the 
National Democratic Institute (NDI)\'s Deputy Country 
Director, who believes that the majority of moderate Islahis 
will support the initiative regardless of U.S. statements 
(4/21 meeting reported septel).  End comment.) 
 
3. (c) Noman relayed stories of his 6-year old son asking him 
about Dr. Abdul Aziz (Rantisi)\'s death and a 15-year-old 
student\'s assertions that U.S. support for Israel is the 
equivalent to an anti-Arab policy to support his position 
that the U.S. needs to convince the Arab street that it is 
credible.  Citing the backdrop of the 9/11 hearings and the 
built-up alienation between the U.S. and the Arab World, he 
contrasted British PM Blair\'s \"blunt condemnation\" of the 
killing to the U.S. Administration \"turning a blind eye.\" 
Claiming that he was reluctant to use the term \"double 
standard,\" he nonetheless suggested that any statement 
condemning Israel\'s acts, especially the murders of Shaykh 
Yassin and Rantisi, would strengthen both our position on 
reform and our call to Palestine to control the violence. 
 
4. (c) Indicating his personal support for the principle and 
substance of the reforms encompassed by GMEI, Noman promised 
to circulate the papers broadly.  He also recommended that 
Post approach the major political parties and university 
figures to get reactions to the proposals.  (Comment: Despite 
his lengthy diatribe on U.S. faults on public handling of the 
Arab-Israel conflict, Noman is progressive and projected a 
strong commitment to seizing the opportunity for input to the 
evolving GMEI.  End comment). 
 
5. (u) Over the next 6 to 8 weeks, Post has a strategy to 
take the pulse of government officials, civil society, NGOs 
and business on GMEI proposals and will provide reporting in 
septels.

TAGS: KPAO, OIIP, YM 
SUBJECT: Meeting with information Minister and 
National TV Chairman 
 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY:  On March 24, PAO held meetings 
with the Director of Yemen TV and the Minister of 
Information to brief them on upcoming media 
training programs sponsored by the Embassy and to 
discuss further cooperation in the information 
sector. Both interlocutors expressed readiness to 
work with the Public Diplomacy Section and 
presented a number of requests. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) In a meeting with Yemen TV Director Abdul 
Ghani Al-Shamiri, PAO John Balian proposed a 
number of programs to be acquired by State TV, 
such as \"American Passages\", \"Democracy: A History 
of US\" and others.  PAO also told Mr. Shamiri that 
USAID Yemen may be able to acquire rights to 
\"Sesame Street\" in Arabic from Cairo and that 
program might be available to Yemen TV, if 
desired.  Mr. Shamiri welcomed these offers, but 
insisted these were piecemeal propositions. 
Instead, he presented his own plan, which he said 
would cement the cooperative relationship between 
the US Mission and Yemen TV.  His plan for 
cooperation (i.e. U.S. assistance) consists of 
three parts: a) Training/Preparation of Cadres; b) 
Programs; c) Equipment. 
 
3.  (U) Training: Mr. Shamiri asked that the 
Embassy provide Yemen TV with US television 
experts who could train his staff in all aspects 
of television broadcasting, including journalistic 
techniques, cameramanship, production, 
newscasting, documentary techniques and 
programming in general. He would also like to have 
the newsreaders of his budding English-language 
news program to get some training in the United 
States to improve their English and their delivery 
techniques. He said he lacks the cadres to 
implement real reforms at Yemen TV.  If possible, 
he would also like to send a few promising young 
cadres to study broadcasting in the United States. 
Mr. Shamiri said he currently sends his workers to 
Syria to train at the broadcasting institute 
there, but that he is not satisfied with that 
training. 
 
 
4.  (U) Programs: Mr. Shamiri asked that we make 
available to Yemen TV some commercial American TV 
programs that illustrate law enforcement and the 
rule of law.  He specifically mentioned the 
Reality-TV show \"Police\" and \"Law and Order\" as 
well as other reality shows that present an 
unvarnished picture of one aspect of life in 
America.  He said these would be very popular in 
Yemen and would raise the people\'s esteem of the 
United States.  He also asked that we provide 
English language instruction videotape series so 
he could start a TV-based English teaching 
program.  Additionally, Mr. Shamiri would like to 
have scientific and nature related programs 
produced in the United States. 
 
5.  (U) Equipment: Mr. Shamiri would like the 
Embassy to donate two digicam or betacam cameras 
(or one of each) to Yemen TV to be devoted, he 
said, to covering U.S. sponsored activities in 
Yemen and the shooting of documentary programs on 
U.S. projects in the country.  He would also like 
us to provide Yemen TV with state of the art 
editing equipment (together with training on how 
to use them).  He would also like Worldnet to 
replace the satellite dish (provided by Worldnet) 
that is now out of commission and the accompanying 
decoder so he may resume pulling down programming 
for broadcast.  Mr. Shamiri said the French 
Embassy had provided Yemen TV with equipment to 
cover French projects in Yemen as well as to teach 
French on TV.  He said that as a consequence, he 
had opened a \"French\" office at Yemen TV that 
would deal exclusively with French programming. 
He said the Germans are now sponsoring several of 
his workers for training in Germany. And he said 
other foreign representations have also approached 
him with offers of assistance. 
 
6.  (U) Comment: Television is the most important 
medium in Yemen and Mr. Shamiri\'s proposed 
cooperation would give us unprecedented access to 
that medium.  Mr. Shamiri\'s request for equipment 
and access to programs would only cost an 
estimated 250 to 300 thousand dollars, a small sum 
by any standards for what the Mission would get in 
return.  Post does not have the funds to cover 
these costs.  Given Washington\'s interest in the 
electronic media, we are requesting that 
additional resources be tapped to take advantage 
of this window of opportunity. Mr. Shamiri\'s 
request for training could be handled through 
existing exchange programs (special IVPs and 
Speakers). 
 
7.  (U) Meeting with Information Minister: Prior 
to the meeting with the Director of National TV, 
PAO John Balian met with Minister of Information 
Hussein Al-Awadhi (an alumnus of U.S. educational 
exchange programs) to inform him of upcoming media 
training programs sponsored by the Embassy.  Mr. 
Awadhi appreciated the efforts of the Public 
Diplomacy Section to organize a media-training 
workshop in mid-May and a radio production 
workshop in mid-July.  In turn, he asked for U.S. 
assistance for some projects his Ministry is 
contemplating. 
 
8.  (U) Regional FM Radio Stations:  The Minister 
said the government wants to established small FM 
radio stations in some regions of the country.  He 
said the government has already allocated the 
necessary funds but need our assistance in finding 
suppliers for the needed equipment in the United 
States and a U.S. expert to advise them on the 
setup of the radio stations.  He asked if we could 
finance the trip of such an expert to Yemen. 
 
9.  (U) A Radio Museum: Mr. Awadhi also said he 
wants to convert a building next to the Ministry\'s 
main building into a \"Radio Museum\".  He said the 
first centerpiece of the proposed museum will be 
the equipment that was used at the very start of 
radio broadcasts in Yemen in 1940.  He said the 
equipment was donated by the United States and he 
feels the United States should participate in the 
setup of the museum in light of this fact. 
Therefore, he would like some financial assistance 
as well as technical advice on how to set up the 
museum properly. 
 
10.  (U) Training for TV Announcers/Hosts: 
Additionally, the Minister would like us help him 
send some promising TV announcers and program 
hosts to improve their presentation skills.  He 
would like them to get hands on training on how 
best to read the news, how to conduct talk shows, 
how to organize roundtable discussions, and so on. 
He would also like to see some working journalists 
sent to the United States for advanced studies in 
journalism. 
 
11.  (U) Comment: The Minister\'s request for 
assistance with the proposed FM stations could be 
easily met.  AID has experience with community 
radio stations and local broadcasting and knows 
experts who have set up such programs. AID could 
also help in identifying U.S. equipment suppliers. 
The Minister\'s request for training could also be 
handled through existing exchange programs with 
some more funding.  Post is not so enthusiastic 
about the proposed museum project.

1. The Yemeni Female Media Forum declined 
acceptance of a MEPI small grant in the amount of 
$16, 500 in protest of U.S. policies in the 
region.  The president of the Forum, Ms. Rahma

Yemeni papers and websites (see paragraph 3) 
carried the text of her withdrawal letter, which 
follows: 
 
2. Begin text. 
The Yemeni Female Media Form is thankful for all 
the sincere efforts you have made to support us, 
which makes us believe that there are avenues that 
we both can walk down together to reach an Arab 
and American dialogue that will shut off the 
opportunity of Zionists fishing in dirty water and 
will lead the region to stability, a goal that we 
thought we share in common. 
 
However, the ongoing events in Palestine since the 
return of Sharon from his latest visit to the 
U.S., where he received the green light to ignite 
war in the region with American support, have made 
us realize that we have been trying to fool 
ourselves and create a common ground with your 
government.  The U.S. government has common 
interests with the criminal interests of the 
Zionist entity, which have led our efforts to 
create peace with you to failure. 
 
As we recognize and thank your efforts here, we 
condemn your covering for the Zionist crimes and 
your hideous attacks on women and children in 
Iraq. 
 
We remind you that we are part of this human 
family and the Arab nation where you have chosen 
to shed the blood of strugglers.  This forces us 
to choose resistance.  After we have fooled 
ourselves a lot with the idea of peace with 
Israelis and their allies, your government does 
not leave us any option or excuse to cooperate 
with you in light of your vast cooperation with 
the war criminals in Israel. 
 
Therefore we notify you that we are withdrawing 
our request for MEPI small grant funding, IV 
program consideration, and Yemen American Language 
Institute sponsorship, and we reject the support 
of the U.S. to our Forum unless the U.S. adjusts 
its oppressive policy in the region. 
 
This rejection may forgive our helplessness 
towards our brothers and free us from the penalty 
of conscience. 
 
We thank you for your previous cooperation with us 
but be assured that we hold your government 
responsible for the crimes and massacres against 
our peoples in Palestine and Iraq. 
 
Wishing you all peace and prosperity.

Classified By: DCM Alan G. Misenheimer for reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1. (u) This is an action request; see paragraph 4. 
 
2. (c) Following up on a 4/22 meeting and email exchanges, 
Pol/Econ Chief met with Deputy Foreign Minister for Europe, 
the Americas and International Organizations Mustapha Noman 
on 5/2 to discuss the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) 
Statement of Interdiction Principles (SOP).  Noman thanked 
Pol/Econ Chief for translation of PSI-related documents, 
including the SOP.  He said that he forwarded the documents 
to Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi with his comments and a 
recommendation that the ROYG support/approve the SOP, with 
the proviso that Israel \"is included.\"  When questioned on 
this point, Noman clarified that Israel would need to 
officially support the SOP, as Yemen has been requested to 
do, and that without this condition his recommendation would 
not be taken seriously. 
 
3. (c) Noman inquired about the overlap between the SOP and 
UN Security Council Resolution 1540, as adopted on April 28, 
2004.  He was specifically interested operative paragraphs 1 
and to of UNSCR 1540 that state: 
 
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 
 
     (1) Decides that all States shall refrain from providing 
any form of support to non-State actors that attempt to 
develop, acquire, manufacture, possess, transport, transfer 
or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their 
means of delivery; 
 
     (2) Decides also that all States, in accordance with 
their national procedures, shall adopt and enforce 
appropriate effective laws which prohibit any non-State actor 
to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, 
transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and 
their means of delivery, in particular for terrorist 
purposes, as well as attempts to engage in any of the 
foregoing activities, participate in them as an accomplice, 
assist or finance them; 
 
Pol/Econ Chief explained that, at first glance, the two 
documents appear mutually reinforcing and that there is 
nothing in the SOP that would contradict the UNSCR 
requirements, but that the SOP provides additional detailed 
commitments with regard to all actors.  It is Noman\'s opinion 
that the UNSCR language is sufficient and that signing on to 
the SOP would be redundant. 
 
4. (u) Action request:  Understanding that the PSI is 
intended to complement other non-proliferation regimes but 
may be \"informed by efforts in other fora\" and does not

AMMAN; ARABIC LEAGUE ATTITUDES TOWARD REFORM; POSSIBLE ARAB 
FORCE DEPLOYMENT IN IRAQ 
 
 
Classified By: AMB Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Ambassador called on FM Qirbi 5/12 to urge 
his attendance at WEF Amman and discuss AL attitudes toward 
reform post-Cairo and pre-Tunis.  Qirbi will not/not attend 
WEF Amman.  Yemen will be represented by DFM Mustafa Noman, 
who has been a receptive interlocutor on GMEI and warrants 
some USG attention.  Qirbi sees the AL moving toward a 
posture generally receptive to U.S. and G8 reform ideas, and 
believes deployment of Arab forces in Iraq is possible if 
certain conditions are met.  End Summary. 
 
--------------- 
DFM Noman to Head Yemeni Del at WEF Amman 
--------------- 
 
2. (C) Ambassador Hull called on FM Abubaker al-Qirbi 12 May 
to urge the Minister\'s attendance at WEF Amman.  Qirbi said 
he had received an invitation from Jordanian FM Muasher but 
will not/not attend.  He will send DFM Mustafa Noman to 
represent Yemen.  (Comment: Noman, Yemen\'s former Ambassador 
to Canada, is a polished, thoughtful interlocutor.  He has 
taken the lead in MFA discussions with us on GMEI, taking a 
constructive, upbeat attitude.  In fact, Noman is engaged 
with Yemeni intellectuals outside the ROYG who are advocating 
reform ideas consistent with GMEI concepts.  Post recommends 
that the U.S. delegation engage with Noman as a favorably 
disposed interlocutor.  End comment.) 
 
--------------- 
AL Attitudes on Reform: Evolving Positively 
--------------- 
 
3. (C) Qirbi provided a detailed readout of discussions at 
the Cairo AL ministerial, characterizing it overall as 
\"constructive.\"  There was of course much discussion of Iraq, 
including negative focus on the prison abuse scandal and 
speculation on nature of the 6/30 handover of sovereignty. 
On the issue of reform, in particular, he sees Arab attitudes 
moving toward acceptance of concepts included in the now 
widely circulated U.S. and G8 papers.  Despite Saudi and 
other objections to positive references to multi-party 
systems and some petty wordsmithing --  e.g. substitution of 
the Arabic word \"tatwir\" (lit: to cause to develop/evolve) in 
place of \"islah,\" the usual Arabic term for reform; agreement 
to combine the word \"democracy\" with the Arabic term \"shura\" 
(lit: \"consultation\"); and substitution of \"NGOs\" for \"civil 
society\" -- Qirbi said he saw increasing receptiveness to the 
principle of reform.  Syria conspicuously rowed against this 
tide, but did not succeed in efforts to dilute favorable 
draft communiqu language on the Sanaa and Alexandria 
Declarations by adding mention of SARG-sponsored meetings on 
the role of women in Syria.  The AL summit in Tunis is 
tentatively set for 5/22-23, although Qirbi noted that it was 
unlikely Saleh would be able to attend in that timeframe 
because Yemen\'s National Day is May 22. 
 
--------------- 
Arab Troops in Iraq: Possible Under Certain Conditions 
--------------- 
 
4. (C) Qirbi said there was extensive discussion of possible 
deployment of Arab troops in Iraq.  There was acceptance of 
the concept, with emphasis on defining preconditions.  There 
was loose consensus on several points: (a) no troops from 
any/any of the countries neighboring Iraq; (b) must be within 
framework of a UN mandate; and (c) command must be acceptable 
-- i.e. not subordinate to non-Arab commander.

Ref. Subject:  The GMEI and the G-8\'s Proposed Pilot 
Microfinance Program in Yemen 
 
Dear Mr. EDSON, 
 
Thank you for your letter of May 6, 2004 on the above 
subject.  I am pleased to inform you that Yemen welcomes the 
Greater Middle East Initiative (GMEI) and express our 
willingness to host a pilot program of the G-8\'s proposed 
microfinance initiative within the Greater Middle East 
region. 
 
Yemen is also willing to participate in the proposed \"Forum 
of the Future\" which would bring together officials from the 
G-8 and regional ministers of Finance, Trade and Foreign 
Affairs. 
 
As I conveyed to you in our last meeting in Washington and in 
the conversation we had earlier last week, Yemen has since 
the mid-1990s embarked on a rigorous program of reforms 
across socio-economic and political fronts, that received the 
respect and admiration of the international community but 
with little development assistance. 
 
Despite progress on reforms, Yemen has a long way to go in 
terms of achieving long-term economic growth and sustainable 
employment and poverty reduction.  Yemen has increasing trust 
that the international community and Washington in particular 
would now consider enhanced development aid to assist Yemen 
maintain the reform process and provide much needed financing 
to confront socio-economic challenges.  Yemen remains one of 
the least ODA recipient countries among LDCs. 
 
 
Again, it is our understanding that US-led initiatives would 
eventually contribute towards addressing the region\'s 
economic and social needs in a more positive way. 
 
We trust your support and look forward to working together on 
making this pilot exercise a model in our part of the world. 
Best regards. 
 
Sincerely,

1. (u) Summary.  Reftel c requested a pre-license check (PLC) 
of the cargo trucks and spare parts of the Republican Guard 
of Yemen.  Despite repeated attempts, Post did not get the 
full cooperation of the Republican Guard and was not able to 
access facilities to conduct the PLC as requested by 
Department of Commerce (DOC).  Over a period of 60 days, with 
the help of a four-week extension (ref a) on the original 
deadline (ref c), Post explained the PLC process and 
consequences of noncompliance to the Republican Guard of 
Yemen through both diplomatic and military liaison channels. 
After having consulted with DOC officials, Post will send a 
diplomatic note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and 
the Republican Guard outlining the possible repercussions, 
including loss of the license to receive these export 
commodities.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2. (u) Post received original PLC request in reftel c on 
March 8.   The purchaser is the Fadel Al-Husseini Trading 
Group.  The enduser is the Republican Guard of Yemen.  The 
enduser site is the training and storage facilities of the 
Yemeni Republican Guard camps. 
 
3. (sbu) In reftel b, Post requested an extension of four 
weeks to pursue investigating the extrancheck request.  USDOC 
granted a four-week extension until May 10 (ref a). 
 
------------------------------------ 
ATTEMPTS THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (u) Starting March 13, Emboffs made repeated attempts 
through emails, telephone calls, and faxes (per Republican 
Guard request) to arrange a pre-license check visit (ref b). 
On March 31, Post submitted a diplomatic note to the 
Republican Guard through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) requesting cooperation on the extrancheck.  Post 
repeatedly notified all parties that the extrancheck is a 
requirement of the agreement to purchase these commodities. 
Emboffs contacted many parties at the MFA and the Republican 
Guard including the following: Major Walid al-Eryani, Deputy 
Office Manager of the Commander Ali\'s office; Zaid 
al-Wareeth, MFA Protocol; and, Hadi Haidarah Qassem, MFA 
Protocol.  In their comments, the parties demonstrated 
understanding but did not allow Emboffs to inspect any cargo 
trucks or the maintenance shop for the trucks. 
 
5. (u) Based on consultations with DOC officials, Post will 
send a diplomatic note to the MFA and the Republican Guard 
informing them of the consequences of noncompliance, which 
include placement on the interagency list of \"unverified 
parties\" and potential non-issuance of this or future 
licenses. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
ATTEMPTS THROUGH MILITARY LIASON CHANNELS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. (sbu) Post recruited the assistance of the Operational 
Control Element in Sanaa (OCE-S) from the United States 
Special Operations Force.  Jeffrey Cuiper, Officer in Charge 
of  OCE-S, and James Holmes, OCE-S Chief of Operations, train 
and supply military equipment to the Special Operations Force 
of Republic of Yemen (Y-SOF).  The head of the Yemeni Special 
Operations Force is also the head of the Republican Guard, 
Ahmed Ali, son of President Saleh.  Since April 13, OCE-S has 
made repeated requests to Ahmed Ali\'s office through Captain 
Rajeh, liason officer of Y-SOF and the Republican Guard. 
With our assistance, OCE-S provided all vehicle 
identification numbers (VINs) of the cargo trucks the 
Republican Guard has already received from American companies 
through the Al-Husseini Company.  Post requested to see any 
five cargo trucks of 17 VINs provided.  OCE-S\'s requests for 
inspection of parts and cargo trucks has so far gone 
unanswered despite notification that if the Republican Guard 
blocks this inspection, this order may not be shipped and 
that all future military equipment from the U.S. Department 
of Defense may also be jeopardized. 
 
----------------- 
CONTACTS WITH DOC 
----------------- 
 
7. (u) In a April 3 teleconference, Emboff consulted Mary 
O\'Brien, Department of Commerce employee in Abu Dhabi, 
regarding the extrancheck.  Post faxed her the bills of 
lading and other documents provided by Fadel Al-Husseini. 
She indicated that inspection of cargo trucks and spare parts 
in the maintenance shop are essential to this pre-license 
check. 
 
8. (sbu) Per a May 11 teleconference with Tom Andrukonis, DOC 
Office of Enforcement, Post obtained an outline of possible 
consequences of noncompliance with the pre-license check. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (sbu) Despite being notified of the potential consequences 
of non-compliance, the Republican Guard has been 
uncooperative with Post\'s requests to allow the pre-license 
check.  Post utilized multiple channels of inquiry to assist 
the Republican Guard with this purchase.  Nevertheless, the 
Republican Guard failed to allow access to the facilities and 
equipment as requested.  Post has limited confidence that 
this most recent diplomatic note will improve the situation.

1. (C) Summary: Embassy Sanaa continues to engage government, 
civil society and business leaders on the Greater Middle East 
draft proposals (ref a).  While most interlocutors express 
opposition to the idea of reform being \"imposed from outside 
the region,\" the discussion generated by the GMEI appears to 
have spurred increased attention on reform efforts within 
Yemen.  The acceptance by President Saleh to attend the G-8 
summit and to host the pilot microfinance project proposal 
(refs c and d), along with reform efforts by non-government 
actors, point towards increased willingness to allow 
practical considerations to override reluctance stemming from 
anger over Iraq, the MEPP and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. 
Ongoing reform efforts in Yemen, including economic reform 
and the parliament\'s recent increased attention on government 
corruption, illustrate that the seeds of reform are already 
growing in Yemen. Few interlocutors have indicated opinions 
on any of the specific proposals, preferring to make general 
comments and/or concentrate on what is needed in Yemen.  End 
Summary. 
 
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP REACTION 
 
2. (C)  Ambassador met with Senior Presidential Advisor and 
former Prime Minister Dr. Abdul Karim al-Iryani 5/11.  Iryani 
said he sees a \"positive evolution\" in Arab attitudes towards 
GMEI that he expects to be reflected in the outcome of the 
Arab summit May 22-23.  He said he understood that Arab 
Foreign Ministers have agreed on a generally positive 
position on reform, without necessarily any reference to 
GMEI.  He noted one sticking point has been (and possibly 
remains) Saudi refusal to endorse multi-party democracy. 
Iryani noted a \"healthy ferment\" on reform in Yemen.  He 
raised two concerns on GMEI.  He asked if there was \"any 
meat\" to the proposals, to which Ambassador noted the 
microfinance initiative (ref d).  He said Arab public opinion 
continues to perceive GMEI as a dodge for engaging seriously 
the Palestinian issue, whether or not that is the case. 
 
3. (C) With the exception of Prime Minister Ba Jammal, 
reactions at the highest levels of the ROYG are indicative of 
support, with President Saleh accepting the invitation to Sea 
Island and Deputy Prime Minister Sofan noting support in a 
written letter (refs c and d).  The PM, however, made a 
statement in the press that the only reform Yemen needs is 
unification.  Comment:  The PM is notorious for making 
statements outside the ROYG norm and is currently under 
pressure from a corruption scandal.  End Comment. 
 
4. (U) The Consultative (or Shura) Council, Yemen\'s appointed 
111-member upper house, held a conference 5/17-18 to discuss 
the 2003 Arab Human Development report and the GMEI papers 
that was attended by high-ranking ROYG officials (including 
DPM Sofan, FM Qirbi and al-Iryani), political parties, NGOs, 
academics and others. 
 
NGOS AND THINK TANKS ACTIVE ON ISSUE; POLITICAL PARTIES 
 
5. (U) Several NGOs and think tanks have recently held 
seminars and discussions on reform in Yemen.  For example, 
the Yemen Institute for Democratic Development (YIDD) held a 
workshop in late April, attended by political parties, 
journalists and other intellectuals at which the Foreign 
Minister spoke.  The tenor of discussion centered around 
fueling reform within Yemen while not allowing reform to be 
imposed by the outside. A prominent think tank leader Dr. 
Fares al-Saqqaf held discussions with government, opposition 
and non-partisan Yemenis, with Emboffs invited to listen. 
Although a few references were made to the absence of 
Israel-Palestine solutions in the initiative and a rejection 
of reform from the outside, most of the discussion focused 
practically on reforms needed within Yemen.  Dr. al-Saqqaf 
told Pol/Econ Deputy that he formed a committee of 
government, political party and NGO leaders, including Deputy 
Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman (ref b), to formulate a 
\"National Initiative for Political Reform.\" 
 
6. (C) Prominent NGO leader Izzedine al-Asbahi of the Human 
Rights Training and Research Center (HRITC) echoed several 
other interlocutors when he told Pol/Econ Deputy that he was 
concerned that the recent scandals regarding abuses at Abu 
Ghraib lessened the credibility of the U.S. in pushing for 
reform, which he saw as a disappointing development for the 
region. 
 
7. (U) Opposition political parties took the opportunity 
presented by GMEI to put pressure on the ROYG for continued 
reform within Yemen, despite most parties publicly rejecting 
any reform initiatives coming from the West.  The Yemen 
Socialist Party (YSP) is most supportive among political 
parties.  The YSP Secretary General Ali Saleh Obad Muqbil was 
quoted in a speech given to his Central Committee 5/6 
(printed in the party newspaper), \"this motion created by 
international initiatives for reforms in the region provides 
a valuable opportunity for the will of reform and change at 
the national levels of all Arab and Muslim states. 
Therefore, we have to rush to seize the moment to generate a 
strong pressuring force to accomplish real reforms.\"  YSP 
leaders in Taiz, the third-largest city in Yemen, echoed this 
sentiment to Pol/Econ Deputy, noting that outside pressure 
was useful in their fight for Yemeni reform but also 
expressing hope that the initiatives would be practical 
rather than just rhetorical.  The second-largest opposition 
party Islah displayed skepticism at the central level about 
whether the GME would \"end up supporting the regime or the 
reform seekers,\" while Islah moderates in Taiz expressed 
cautious support to Pol/Econ Deputy. 
 
COMMENT 
 
8. (C) Embassy interlocutors seem torn between wanting to 
support GMEI for their own reasons, i.e., watering the seeds 
of Yemeni reform, and being reluctant to support any 
initiative that comes from the outside.  Several noted a 
decided lack of credibility stemming from the recent prison 
abuse scandal in Iraq and the absence of the Palestinian 
issue.  The widespread exploration of the reform agenda 
regardless probably stems from a typically Yemeni willingness 
to be practical, internal and external political calculations 
and the desire by Yemen to maintain what it perceives as its 
leadership in political reform in the region.  End Comment.

1. (S/NF) Embassy Sanaa warmly welcomes your first visit to 
Yemen.  You will find President Saleh and senior ROYG 
officials keen to hear from you the Washington perspective on 
bilateral and regional CT cooperation as well as the broader 
GWOT.  Since 9/11 Saleh has met with President Bush in 
Washington, received a visit from VP Cheney (March, 2002) and 
multiple visits by DCI Tenet, and FBI Director Mueller.  In 
addition to Saleh (whom you will meet in the Red Sea port 
city of Hodeidah), you will meet with: 
 
-- Acting Foreign Minister Mohieddin al-Dhabi (FM al-Qirbi 
represented Yemen at the AL summit and has not yet returned); 
 
-- Minister of Interior Dr. Rashad al-Alimi (responsible for 
both the Central Security Forces (CSF) and the Yemen Coast 
Guard (YCG), both key CT assets); 
 
-- Political Security (i.e. intelligence) Chief GEN Ghalib 
al-Gamish (who oversees ongoing intel exchange and holds 
security detainees); and 
 
-- Deputy Prime Minister/Minister of Finance Alawi Salah 
al-Salami (time permitting) 
 
2. (SBU) Your visit is especially timely as Saleh has 
accepted President Bush,s invitation to visit Sea Island in 
conjunction with next month\'s G-8 summit.  Saleh will also 
see Kofi Annan in NYC and stop in Washington for TBD meetings 
with U.S. officials.  We recommend that your visit conclude 
with a brief airport press conference highlighting the strong 
U.S.-Yemen CT relationship and drawing attention to Saleh\'s 
acceptance of the POTUS invitation to Sea Island. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CT Cooperation: Yemen a Partner in GWOT 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (S/NF) Your basic message on Yemen\'s continued progress is 
simple: Yemen is a valued partner in the Global War on 
Terrorism.  Saleh sees Yemen,s pro-U.S. stance in the GWOT 
as a vital Yemeni interest, particularly since the 11/02 
attack on the oil tanker M/V Limburg off Yemen,s southern 
coast.  Security in Yemen is vastly improved compared to a 
year or two ago, and the ROYG continues to log important 
progress, including: 
 
-- The March recapture of USS Cole suspects Jamal Muhammad 
Ahmad  Ali al-Badawi and Fahd Muhammad Ahmad al-Quso; 
 
-- Aggressive CT deployment in the Abyan region involving 
coordination among military and MOI assets (including a 
U.S.-equipped force). 
 
-- The imminent trial of terrorist suspects in four cases: 
the 9/02 incident in an al-Qaida safehouse in Saaa; the 10/02 
M/V Limburg bombing; the 11/02 Hunt Oil Company helicopter 
attack; and an al-Qaida cell rolled up in fall 2003 with a 
long list of targets in Yemen, including the U.S. Ambassador. 
 The trial of the Cole suspects has been delayed until after 
this trial. 
 
4. (S/NF) Since the awkward period of friction with the FBI 
at the outset of the USS Cole investigation, Saleh has made 
critical decisions to align with the U.S. and confront 
al-Qaida,s in-country presence.  In the face of stiff 
domestic criticism he acknowledged the 11/3/02 Predator 
strike as a joint Yemeni-U.S. operation despite unilateral 
U.S. disclosure that initially embarrassed the ROYG.  At 
present the USG is training the CSF and Yemen,s Special 
Forces.  FMF and IMET funds continue the revitalization of 
Yemen\'s armed forces and have created the YCG, which hit the 
water last month with eight 44-foot U.S. EDA boats.  Fruitful 
post-9/11 security cooperation set the stage for the return 
of USAID last year and the launching of an ambitious 
development assistance program designed to complement our 
direct CT engagement. 
 
5. (U) The following paragraphs provide background on topics 
likely to arise during your visit. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Terrorist Financing and Zindani: Need ROYG Action 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
6. (S) Despite nascent efforts to build an effective 
anti-money laundering regime, the ROYG,s capability to stop 
the flow of money is limited.  Since the 2003 passage of a 
money laundering law, Central Bank officials, MFA contacts 
and representatives of private banks have made repeated 
requests for U.S. assistance to build their infrastructure. 
Nevertheless ROYG officials tend to view terrorist financing 
as a problem more for regional neighbors than for Yemen, and 
have expressed to us concern over Gulf financing of extremist 
charities operating in Yemen (ref A).  ROYG officials would 
welcome any information you may wish to offer on U.S. 
strategy to interdict and deter terrorist financing in the 
region. 
 
7. (C) The ROYG\'s non-supportive public posture on the UN 
action freezing Sheikh Abdul Majid al-Zindani\'s assets 
reflects the domestic sensitivity of his position as a public 
figure widely seen more as a fund-raiser for Palestinian 
humanitarian relief rather than a terrorist.  Saleh dislikes 
him, however, and in February a senior aide told us there was 
\"no disagreement or difference\" between Yemen and the U.S. on 
Zindani (ref B).  Presidential Advisor Dr. Abdul Karim 
al-Iryani told the Ambassador in March that the ROYG had 
apprehended two couriers with Gulf money intended for 
Zindani.  To date, that is the only visible indication of 
ROYG compliance with the UN sanctions.  The ROYG has used the 
excuse of requesting legal documentation on Zindani\'s 
culpability and Gulf charities mentioned above to delay 
further action.  With Saleh and (if you see him) Salami you 
may wish to underscore the ROYG,s UN-mandated obligation to: 
 
-- freeze Zindani\'s financial assets and ensure that funds 
are not made available to designated individuals; 
 
-- prevent Zindani from traveling within the region; and 
 
-- share information on ROYG actions pursuant to UNSCR 1267 
and 1526 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Grey Arms: Need Improved Border Control 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8. (S/NF) In recent months Yemen and Saudi Arabia have 
announced joint efforts to tighten border security, but 
improvement to date appears limited and uneven.  Past 
examples of weapons smuggled from Yemen turning up at attack 
sites in KSA and elsewhere are well known, so the security of 
the country,s land and maritime borders must be a priority 
concern.  You might underscore this point with Interior 
Minister Alimi as well as Saleh.  The USG has installed the 
pisces system here and just initiated the EXBS program for 
further assistance. 
 
9. (S/NF) Saleh may mention the case of light weapons seized 
from a dhow of the coast of Yemen by a U.S. Navy ship.  Crew 
and boat were returned to the ROYG, but the weapons remain 
aboard a U.S. vessel required for duty elsewhere.  Saleh 
wants the guns.  In coordination with CENTCOM, we reached 
agreement with the Yemenis that the weapons might/might be 
handed over to Yemen pending a joint USG -ROYG investigation. 
 Should President Saleh raise it, we suggest you praise the 
U.S.-Yemeni cooperation to date on the incident and stress 
that both must work together to ensure that these weapons do 
not fall in the wrong hands. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Future Areas for Law Enforcement Cooperation 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) Embassy Sanaa has two requests in the area of law 
enforcement cooperation which, as appropriate, you could 
raise: 
 
-- (S/NF) Full biographical data, including photographs and 
fingerprints, for ROYG detainees.  Yemen has emulated Egypt 
in conducting systematic \"dialogue\" with terrorist suspects 
and releasing those who (a) have committed no crime and (b) 
repent their extremist leanings.  About 200 were released 
last winter, and we have requested biodata on remaining 
detainees prior to any further release.  This is an issue for 
both Interior Minister Alimi and PSO Chief Gamish. 
 
-- (S/NF) Rendition of Badawi and Quso.  The ROYG provided a 
temporizing response -- requesting further documentation -- 
to the formal U.S. rendition request we presented last month. 
 Rendition of Yemeni citizens is forbidden under the Yemeni 
constitution, so a \"Yes\" is not likely.  You might 
nevertheless probe Alimi on the issue and underscore that 
they are indicted in the United States. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Needed: Funding to Strengthen CT Cooperation with Yemen 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
11. (SBU) Your exchanges with Saleh and other senior ROYG 
officials will have a strong, positive impact on the CT 
relationship.  There is another step that could increase that 
impact back in Washington.  Current foreign assistance 
legislation prohibits use of FMF for training or equipping 
non-Ministry of Defense forces.  This stricture hurts us in 
Yemen, where the CSO, a paramilitary force of the MOI, is the 
CT unit of choice and has proven itself repeatedly.  State 
and Defense are engaged in seeking a legislative remedy.  An 
additional push from the NSC could help sustain the CT 
engagement that has borne fruit for U.S. interests in Yemen 
since 9/11.

REF: A) STATE 187026 B) SANAA 5295 
 
1.  The Society for the Development of Women and Children 
SOUL   has   concluded   its  training   project   titled 
\"Institutional NGOs Capacity Building\" This  project  was 
performed in three phases: 
 
           The first phase was the institutional assessment of 
          local organizations to be selected for the training. 
    The second was the implementation of the training 
program. 
    The third phase was the follow up process for 
targeted NGOs 
 
2.   SOUL\'s team carried out institutional assessment  of 
NGOs  in  seven  governorates to assess the  situation  & 
training   needs  of  Yemeni  local  NGOs.  Outcomes   of 
assessment  were  used by SOUL & PAS to select  potential 
organization in the targeted governorates.  According  to 
a  set  of  criteria agreed in advance, 40  NGOs  in  all 
governorates were nominated for assessment; but  10  NGOs 
only  were  selected for the training.  This  phase  took 
approximately one month and half. 
This phase incorporated the following procedures: 
      Development a questionnaire for assessment 
    Identification the targeted governorates by PAS  & 
SOUL 
    Suggestion criteria of selecting NGOs By PAS  & SOUL 
    Identification the indicators and the weights of 
NGOs institutional assessment 
    Communication offices of Ministry of Social Affairs 
and SOUL to get lists of NGOs in each governorates 
    Conducting the institutional assessment for targeted 
NGOs 
    Sorting the overall questionnaires using the 
specified indictors & weights 
    Selection the potential NGOS 
 
SOUL  &  PAS  representative nominated  NGOs  from  seven 
governorates: Sana\'a, Amran, Sada\'a, Aljawof,  Hadramout, 
Shabwa & Marib. 
 
PAS  worked  with  the  SOUL  team  to  put  emphasis  on 
\'quality\'  as the foremost merit of the project;  thus  a 
number  of  procedures  were  integrated  throughout  the 
project\'s implementation process to ensure this value. 
 
 
3.  The training commenced on September 27,2003 and 
continued to October 9,2003.  This 2- week training 
incorporated three main issues:  NGO management, 
personnel skills & developing a project proposal.  It was 
implemented via the following methods: 
 
  1.   Giving theoretical background of the subjects 
2.   Holding workshops & group discussions 
3.   Conducting a role play 
4.   Arranging for field visit to SOUL 
5.   Inviting some international NGO representatives as 
guest speakers to talk about their experience in Yemen, 
from local & donor NGOs 
6.   Pre-training evaluation for participants on each 
subject 
7.   Post-training evaluation for participants on each 
completed subject at the end of each training day 
 
The  training focused on the application method more than 
theoretical method. In addition, participants were  asked 
to   prepare  project  proposals  and  look  for  funding 
agencies with SOUL\'s cooperation. 
 
4.   The  last  step was the follow up or post  -training 
evaluation  of trained NGOs.  This step was set  up  from 
November  20-  December  15, 2003.   While  the  training 
program  was implemented, the participants were asked  to 
prepare  a  plan  of action through which  the  evaluator 
could  assess  the  advantages that the participants  got 
from  the  training as well as the improvement that  took 
place in the organization. 
 
The Follow-up & Evolution Phase (FEP) aimed to assess the 
participants    benefits    from      training    course. 
Furthermore, it aimed to follow the implementation of the 
plan  of  actions  developed by participants  during  the 
training 
 
After the process of NGOs evaluation, the evaluator  came 
up with the inal ranking for the NGOs based on the extent 
of  benefit,  application of the  plan  of  actions,  and 
improvement in the NGOs\' performance.

5.  Evaluation Outcomes: 
 
Through the process of evaluation for the NGOs, a  number 
of observations appeared as follows: 
 
       Only 8 NGOs out of 10 were visited and evaluated. 
     One of the organizations \"Abraad Environment Protection \" 
     did not attend the training course and \"The Yemen Women 
     Media Forum\" was in the process of finding an office for 
     their  activities, therefore evaluation process  was 
     postponed. 
         Participants  got  benefit  from  the  training 
     demonstrated in their work 
    A number of NGOs rely on determent persons that a 
situation threaten the sustainability of the NGO 
    Most NGOs perform charitable activities through the 
whole year 
    Most NGOs have no filling system so that it was hard 
to promptly get information 
    Most NGOs have no an accounting records for 
s for 
financial transactions as well as no financial systems 
    Most NGOs have no stable financial resources in 
order to continue achieving their objectives

OFFICIALS 
 
REF: SANAA 1261 
 
Classified By: Ambassador E.J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (b. and d.) 
 
1. (S) Summary: On 5/26 DNSA Townsend reviewed CT cooperation 
with MOI al-Alimi, PSO Director al-Gamish and NSB Officer 
Saleh and highlighted recent inconsistencies in the 
relationship.  Dominating discussion, Alimi affirmed the 
strength of the CT partnership, and noted that differences of 
opinion do not diminish its strength.  Townsend sought 
enhanced intelligence sharing and access to CT detainees and 
trial suspects.  Declaring that all requests have been 
granted, Alimi agreed to look into information provided by 
Townsend that a Yemen CT detainee may be engaged in attack 
planning.  Townsend pressed the ROYG to facilitate pending 
extradition and rendition requests and raised concerns over 
Yemen\'s controls over small-arms.  In reply, Alimi offered 
access to the weapons storehouse and reviewed Yemen\'s efforts 
to halt weapons smuggling.  End summary. 
 
2. (S) Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating 
Terrorism Frances Townsend opened her 5/26 meeting with 
Minister of Interior Dr. Rashad al-Alimi, Political Security 
Director GEN Ghalib al-Gamish and National Security Bureau 
Officer Amar Saleh by saying that at times Yemen has been a 
\"wonderful\" partner, but at other times it is inconsistent. 
She stated that she traveled to Yemen to make cooperation 
stronger in the areas of intelligence sharing, renditions and 
arms trafficking.  Alimi said from the Yemeni perspective, 
Yemen and the U.S. are \"standing together in this effort to 
stop terror.\"  Alimi expressed appreciation for Townsend\'s 
openness and transparency, but said that the ROYG had a 
different, more positive view of its cooperation.  He added, 
\"different opinions do not detract from the partnership.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Intelligence Sharing; Trial and Evidentiary Access 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3. (S/NF) Townsend cited \"helpful\" instances where USG 
officials were allowed access to detainees.  According to 
Townsend, these meetings were a direct result of FM Qirbi\'s 
February visit to Washington.  However, Townsend said, since 
March the ROYG has allowed no visits to detainees or 
terrorist trial suspects.  (Note: USS Cole suspects Badawi 
and Quso were re-captured in March.)  Alimi responded that 
all information on ROYG detainees suspected of terrorism is 
shared with the US and said that USG officials have conducted 
interviews.  Townsend interjected that \"not everything\" has 
been shared and said \"repeated requests have been denied.\" 
Gamish offered that visits were granted, but that poor 
FBI/CIA coordination led to an unfair impression of 
cooperation. 
 
4. (S/NF) Townsend pursued the question of FBI access to 
suspects in the USS Cole trials and combined trials for four 
terrorist attacks (Ref A).  Both Gamish and Alimi maintained 
that the LEGATT should direct requests to visit trial 
suspects through the Prosecutor General\'s office, which 
controls suspects and evidence.  Townsend countered that USG 
officials should have been able to conduct interviews with 
the suspects when the Embassy asked, while the suspects were 
in PSO custody.  Townsend added, \"this is not a fair way to 
treat a partner.\"  Gamish replied that the CIA had full 
access and complained that the USG did not coordinate its 
requests.  Townsend clarified the distinction between law 
enforcement and intelligence information requests, 
underscoring that both are necessary.  (Note: Now that the 
trials have begun, USG officials are unable to conduct 
interviews.) 
 
5. (S/NF) To emphasize the importance of intelligence 
sharing, Townsend illustrated the case of Mustafa al-Ansari, 
who was detained and released in Yemen.  Ansari later was 
killed perpetrating the 5/1 Yanbu terrorist attack.  Alimi 
replied that Ansari was detained in 1999 on counterfeiting 
charges, served a one-year jail sentence and was released. 
Gamish claimed the Saudis dismissed earlier 
information-sharing attempts because they believed the 
persons in question were religious clerics and not criminals. 
 Alimi and Gamish agreed that the Saudis took information 
more seriously after the May 2003 Riyadh attacks.  Townsend 
offered that information such as fingerprints and 
photographic evidence shared with partners could avert future 
terrorist attacks. 
 
6. (S/NF) Townsend highlighted particular concern over 
information that a ROYG detainee may be involved in planning 
a terrorist attack.  Townsend said if an attack occurred and 
was linked to planning in Yemen, \"it would be a great tragedy 
and have terrible consequences for what should be a wonderful 
relationship.\"  Alimi replied that he did not believe such 
contact was possible, but he \"expected\" the U.S. to share 
information on terrorist threats.  Alimi promised to 
investigate the information provided. 
 
----------------------- 
Extraditions/Renditions 
----------------------- 
 
7. (S) Describing both national and personal significance to 
seeing the perpetrators of the USS Cole bombing brought to 
trial in the U.S., Townsend asked that Alimi \"do everything 
in his power\" regarding pending U.S. extradition requests for: 
 
-- USS Cole suspects Jamal Muhammad Ahmad  Ali al-Badawi and 
Fahd Muhammad Ahmad al-Quso; 
 
-- Jaber al-Bannah (Lackawana suspect and American citizen) 
 
Townsend also requested assistance in rendering Abu 
Atta/al-Sharqawi and Hadi Dulqum to 
third countries.  Alimi responded that extradition in Yemen 
is governed by its constitution, and that America should 
understand why a nation must respect its own constitution. 
(Note: The constitution prohibits extradition of Yemeni 
citizens.) 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Alimi: Access to Weapons Buy-Back Warehouse 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (S) Turning to small-arms smuggling, Townsend raised 
concerns over large amounts of Polish and Chinese arms 
shipments to Yemen\'s Ministry of Defense.  Townsend said if 
one totaled the past three years of arms shipments, each 
soldier in Yemen would have 4 or 5 long-guns, not including 
previously-held MoD stockpiles.  Townsend continued that the 
USG has evidence that weapons traced back to Yemen\'s MoD were 
used in the May 2004 attack in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia; and 
MANPADS from Yemen were used in the 2002 attack in Mombassa, 
Kenya and the 2003 attack in Saudi Arabia, and the 2003 Hunt 
helicopter attack in Yemen.  Townsend commented that visiting 
storehouses is not sufficient, and said full accountability 
of weapons with serial numbers and inventory controls are 
necessary. 
 
9. (C) Townsend proposed that foreign assistance for Yemen\'s 
buy-back program would be easier to obtain if the ROYG could 
assure donors of ROYG inventory controls and security at 
storage facilities.  Alimi replied that \"you may visit the 
warehouse tomorrow.\"  Alimi detailed recent ROYG actions to 
limit weapons smuggling, including the closure of the Saada 
arms-market, promulgation of legislation, and 6 billion 
Riyals spent in weapons buy-back. (Roughly 33 million USD.) 
 
10. (C) Noting that discussions with Saudi Arabia on 
arms-smuggling are underway, Alimi offered that Mohammed bin 
Naif was in Yemen that day to meet with National Security 
Bureau Officer Saleh to discuss this issue.  Alimi said that 
the ROYG has made repeated requests to Saudi Arabia to return 
captured Yemeni arms smugglers, but there has been no 
response.  Alimi added that they want Saudi Arabia to take 
its share of responsibility on this issue. 
 
------- 
Zindani 
------- 
 
11. (C) Townsend raised Yemen\'s obligations to freeze the 
assets of Sheikh Abdul Majid al-Zindani under UNSCR 1267 and 
said that there is no evidence yet of compliance.  Alimi 
referred her to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (S) Comment: The two hour meeting covered several, if not 
all, outstanding USG CT requests for cooperation.  Alimi and 
Gamish remained cordial even as difficult points on access to 
suspects/detainees and improved cooperation were discussed. 
Embassy Sanaa will follow up on assurances made in the 
meeting.  End comment.

1. (U) Summary: DCM called on Minister of Human Rights Amat 
Alim al-Suswa 6/14 to deliver country narrative and talking 
points in reftel on the release of the Trafficking in Persons 
(TIP) report.  The Minister detailed further actions taken by 
the ROYG to combat TIP, including the formation of an 
inter-agency ROYG commission.  They also discussed President 
Saleh\'s visit to the United States for the G-8 summit and 
other meetings, the new U.S. program to train Yemeni police 
in riot control and the past and future activities of the 
Ministry of Human Rights (MHR).  End Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
ROYG Progress on TIP 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Minister thanked DCM for notifying her of Yemen\'s 
place in the TIP report as a special case.  She said that 
trafficking in persons was a new issue for Yemen that was not 
widely understood.  She agreed that, although information was 
fragmentary on the scope of the problem, actions must be 
taken to address the issue.  She noted excellent cooperation 
with the Embassy, thanking Post for helping the ROYG 
understand the problem.  She said she was happy that other 
ROYG ministries took the previously \"not known\" issue 
seriously when it was raised in detail in the last year, 
particularly praising the cooperation of the Ministry of 
Interior (MOI).  DCM noted the recent signing of a Memorandum 
of Understanding (MOU) with MOI for the INL riot control 
training program with police, which the Minister welcomed. 
DCM also emphasized the importance of MOI in the prevention 
and prosecution of traffickers. 
 
3. (C) She said the ROYG formed a commission to fight TIP, 
consisting of the Ministries of Human Rights, Interior, 
Social Affairs and Labor and other relevant agencies such as 
the Prosecutor General.  Al-Suswa also praised the rising 
interest of parliament in the issue of child trafficking and 
shared a copy of a letter in Arabic she wrote responding to a 
parliamentary inquiry.  Drawing on information gained from 
the ongoing UNICEF survey on child trafficking conducted in 
cooperation with ROYG ministries, she said the letter 
described what is known about the problem thus far and what 
the ROYG is doing about it. (Note: Post will translate the 
letter and report as necessary.) 
 
---------- 
MHR Update 
---------- 
 
4. (C) The Minister said June 23 was the one-year anniversary 
of the creation of the Ministry of Human Rights.  She 
provided an English copy of the Ministry\'s Performance 
Report, covering progress from June 2003 to March 2004.  She 
noted again good relations with ministries important to 
resolving human rights abuses, including MOI, Ministry of 
Justice and the prosecutor general.  She said that with the 
support of these ministries, she was able to persuade the 
cabinet to vote to have the Ministry of Finance provide the 
MHR its full fiscal year monies instead of quarterly to 
facilitate the ministry\'s development.  (Comment:  This is 
highly unusual and a surprising victory in a government where 
the Ministry of Finance controls the purse strings.  End 
comment) 
 
5. (C) In addition, the Minister highlighted several areas of 
progress from the Performance Report: 
 
-- a commission established to study Yemeni legislation to 
make recommendations to ensure compliance with international 
human rights standards; 
 
-- the \"almost done\" first draft of the first Yemen human 
rights report developed by the government in cooperation with 
non-government experts, which she said she hoped would be 
objective and accurate; 
 
-- the mechanism by which the MHR works with other ministries 
to respond to human rights complaints from citizens and 
others; and 
 
--  the development of legal assistance mechanisms, including 
a hotline to help with requests for help.

1.  (S/NF)  Summary: Ambassador convened an EAC 6/19 to 
discuss the security situation for official and non-official 
Amcits in light of the killing of Amcit Paul Johnson in 
Riyadh (ref a).  ORCA reported no specific threat information 
for Yemen.  Post disseminated a Warden Message 6/19 
containing the public announcement in ref b, and  EAC decided 
to hold a town meeting on 6/23.  EAC also discussed security 
ramifications related to rental cars for Embassy personnel 
and made several recommendations for RSO follow-up.  EAC 
decided that no change to the Embassy\'s current stringent 
security posture for official Americans was warranted.  Key 
offices and personnel represented included: AID, CDA, CONS, 
DAO, FPD, MSG, MO, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, OCE-Yemen, and 
RSO.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  EAC discussed the security threat to non-official 
Amcits in light of the killing of Paul Johnson (ref a), the 
public announcement warning (ref b) and the risk of \"copycat\" 
attacks.  Post released the public announcement as a Warden 
Message early on 6/19.  EAC decided to hold a town meeting on 
6/23 to reinforce the Warden Message.  The meeting will reach 
out to the wider community, with increased efforts to 
encourage persons beyond the wardens to attend, particularly 
representatives of American-affiliated NGOs and businesses. 
3.  (SBU) Ambassador requested that the RSO develop 
wallet-sized laminated security guidance cards to disseminate 
at the town meeting, to include important reminders such as 
vary routes and times, be vigilant, pay attention to any 
surveillance attempts, avoid Western-affiliated areas and 
places, etc. 
 
4.  (S/NF) EAC discussed the security issues related to 
rental cars driven by Embassy personnel.  RSO agreed to 
explore removing any stickers or other identifying marks from 
rental vehicles, hold security dialogues with Hertz and 
Europcar on how they can spot any attempt to use the 
companies as a source for terrorist targeting information and 
double-check to ensure that license plates contain no 
indication that the car is a rental.  EAC also decided to 
look into whether it would be prudent to have Embassy car 
rental contracts be signed with only the Embassy on the 
contract and not any individual\'s name.

) 
 
1. (c) Embassy Sana\'a welcomes the opportunity to engage with 
AF Bureau on counter-terrorism issues and on developing a 
more comprehensive CT strategy for the region.  Post is 
concerned with border and maritime security as well as the 
movement of people and arms between Yemen and East Africa, 
particularly Somalia, as highlighted by the recent seizure of 
a dhow carrying a shipment of weapons from Yemen.  As 
requested in reftel, below is an outline of Post\'s 
counter-terrorism (CT) programs that will boost ROYG 
effectiveness in combating terrorism and potential for 
participating in regional security cooperation. 
 
2. (c)  Post\'s ongoing military/counter-terrorism cooperation 
includes: 
 
   - counter-terrorism training and modernization for Yemeni 
Special Forces; 
 
- U.S. Military Training Teams (MTTs) in country to train 
ground and maritime forces; 
 
- equipment, including 8 EDA (Excess Defense Articles) patrol 
boats that were commissioned in April 2004, training, and 
guidance to establish Yemeni Coast Guard (YCG) capabilities; 
 
- equipment and training for Yemen\'s Terrorist Interdiction 
Program (TIP), the on-line system for monitoring entry and 
exit from all of Yemen\'s air, land, and sea ports.  The 
program is currently in Phase III (of 4 phases) and has 
established monitoring portals at 24 border crossing points 
in Yemen; 
 
- training under the Anti-terrorist Assistance (ATA) program, 
e.g., the Department of State and the FBI jointly sponsored a 
terrorist crime scene investigation training course for ROYG 
officials in summer 2003.  Recently a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) with Ministry of Interior (MOI) for an 
INL crowd control training program with Yemeni police 
officers; 
 
- an interagency Export and Border Security (EXBS) team visit 
in December 2003; the trip report is still pending, but Yemen 
is slated to receive approximately $470,000 to fund sending 
ROYG officials to a Senior Export Control Seminar, a workshop 
on controlled/dual-use items, land and sea interdiction 
training, and basic equipment and border patrol vehicles; 
 
- a Department of Energy (DOE) Radiological Threat Reduction 
team visited in May 2004 and negotiated approximately $47,000 
in contracts for upgrades to make radiological source storage 
sites more secure; and 
 
Post believes that there is real benefit to continued 
capacity building for both counter-terrorism forces, border 
control and law enforcement through all of the programs 
listed above and is continually exploring additional funding 
sources to maintain U.S. efforts. 
 
3. (s)  Post is also engaged in sensitive intelligence 
programs to increase cooperation and information sharing. 
 
RETURN ON INVESTMENT:  SUCCESSFUL YEMEN CT OPERATIONS 
 
4. (c) These collaborations are producing tangible successes. 
 In mid-September 2003, the ROYG disrupted an al-Qaida cell 
operating in Sana\'a, Yemen and targeting Western interests, 
Yemeni officials trained by the FBI during the ATA program 
participated in the take-down of the cell, which was headed 
by Afghanistan-trained \'Amr al-Sharif, who was trying to 
reconstitute al-Qaida in Yemen. 
 
5. (sbu) In June 2003, the newly-formed Central Security 
Forces (CSF) CT unit was dispatched to the Hattat mountains 
in Abyan province to hunt down and bring to justice those 
responsible for an attack on a military medical convoy the 
week before.  The area commander put this unit, trained by 
British and U.S. forces, at the lead of this effort when 
Ministry of Defense forces became bogged down by harassing 
gunfire from the surrounding hills.  Over a 3-day period, the 
CSF unit engaged those responsible and completed their 
mission.  In May 2004, international forces intercepted a 
dhow with a substantial shipment of weapons on board; after 
careful negotiation the confiscated weapons were returned to 
the ROYG for outfitting counter-terrorism and special forces 
for future operations. 
 
FUTURE EFFORTS:  INCREASING MARITIME SECURITY AND REGIONAL 
COORDINATION ON TIP 
 
6. (c) Post sees two key areas for increased regional/HOA 
cooperation: maritime security and regionalizing the TIP 
program.  Increased Yemeni cooperation with TF-150 and 
regional maritime forces could contribute substantially to 
regional maritime security efforts since enhanced regional 
cooperation would better control routes and impede terrorist 
movements.  Regionalizing the PISCES/TIP border monitoring 
program to allow greater information exchanges would improve 
the ability of all countries in the region to stem the 
movement of terrorists or criminals, as well as illegal 
immigration that contributes to the threat of terrorism. 
Moreover, Post believes that Yemen\'s leadership recognizes 
the need to increase contacts and coordination with its 
neighbors in the interest of enhancing stability and economic 
growth in the region, as demonstrated by Yemen\'s recent 
efforts to reach out to Ethiopia and the Sudan and create 
tripartite cooperation, and is likely to be receptive to the 
initiatives outlined above.

Classified By: DCM Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) Summary and Comment: Over the course of several 
months, Members of Parliament (MPs) have conducted an 
investigation into government corruption regarding an oil 
deal that dates back to 1997.  The investigation was 
spearheaded by two members of the Oil and Resources 
Committee, one from the ruling General People\'s Congress 
party and one from the main opposition Islah party.  In the 
first action of its kind, these MPs rallied parliamentary 
support across party lines to try to hold the government to 
account.  Extensive press coverage of the scandal and the 
factual evidence of government corruption could assist in 
combating widespread corruption in Yemen.  However, a more 
likely result of the success of these efforts is Parliament\'s 
increased willingness and effectiveness in conducting 
oversight of the executive.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
------------- 
The Oil Deal 
------------- 
 
2. (C) In 1997, ROYG issued a Production Sharing Agreement 
(PSA) in Block 53 to a company named Dove Energy over other 
multinational companies such as Can-Oxy Petroleum.  Over 
concerns regarding Dove Energy\'s capability to operate the 
PSA, Parliament launched a preliminary inquiry into the sale 
in 1997-1998.  Opposition press articles from that time claim 
that the owners of Dove are the wife of the Yemen Ambassador 
to the UN and the daughter of the former Yemeni Ambassador to 
Lebanon.  (Note: Emboffs did several background checks on the 
company and found only address listings in the UK, little 
else on Dove.)  Ministry of Oil officials at that time 
reportedly justified the issuance of the PSA to Dove because 
25% of the Dove contract was to be given to the state owned 
Yemen Exploration and Production Company (YEPC), thus 
enhancing state revenue. 
 
3. (C) After hearing rumors that the YEPC sold sixty percent 
of its share to Gulf investors using the name Pacific in 
September 2003, Parliament began another investigation in 
late 2003.  The report from the Oil and Resources Committee 
concluded that: 1) the loss to the state treasury was ten 
million dollars a year for the next 18 years and 2) the sale 
was unconstitutional according to article 18 of the Yemen 
constitution which says that Parliament oversees \"natural 
resources.\"  (Comment: In an era of declining oil revenue for 
the ROYG, this loss to the state revenue is significant.) 
Ministry of Oil justified the deal saying that the loss was 
overestimated and that the ROYG needed to attact Gulf 
investors.  Sanaa is rife with rumors surrounding 
al-Husseini, the Gulf investor behind all of this.  Several 
officials told pol/econoffs that al-Husseini paid off several 
high level ROYG officials (usually naming Prime Minister Ba 
Jammal and Oil Minister Ba Rabah specifically) to make this 
deal.  (Comment: Ba Rabah is widely viewed by western oil 
interests as among the most corrupt and ineffective of the 
Ministers.) 
 
4. (C) The oil committee called Prime Minister Ba Jammal 
repeatedly to answer questions.   Ba Jammal never agreed to 
show up, agruing that Parliament had no legal authority to 
call him.  On May 18, Parliament issued a two week notice to 
the ROYG to cancel the deal.  Three weeks later, the ROYG 
issued a statement that the sale would be cancelled in sixty 
days.  However, the exact details of the agreement to cancel 
are unclear. 
 
-------------------------- 
Machinations in Parliament 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Because the scandal implicated high-level members of 
the ROYG, including Prime Minister Ba Jammal and Oil Minister 
Ba Rabah, many parliamentary and government leaders 
maneuvered to quash the scandal, including attempts to keep 
the discussion of the Committee report from Parliament\'s 
agenda.  At one point, the MPs even made 200 copies of their 
committee report themselves after they found parliamentary 
staff under pressure not to do so.  However, the two MPs 
leading the investigation -- Sakar Ahmed Abass al-Wajih from 
the GPC and Ali Hussein Ashal from Islah -- succeeded in 
keeping the issue on the table by rallying other MPs to fight 
corruption, including the creation of an informal multi-party 
reformist coalition interested in fighting corruption 
generally (including members of the ruling party). 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) The success of the investigation showed MPs, the ROYG 
and citizens that Yemen\'s Parliament has more power in 
overseeing the executive than most realized or were willing 
to exercise, which should bode well for continued 
institutional democratic progress.  The upcoming MEPI-funded 
parliament program is particularly timely.  At the same time, 
the zeal engendered by this success may have negative effects 
on other natural resources deals, as evidenced by the recent 
announcement that U.S. Hunt Oil Company\'s extension on its 
Block 18 PSA will be reviewed by Parliament. End comment.

Classified By: A/RSO Jonathan M. Cullen, for reasons 1.5 (B), (C) and ( 
D) 
 
1.  (S/NF)  SUMMARY: On 6/22/04, a U.S. non-governmental 
organization (NGO) representative forwarded an incitement 
letter to the RSO, explaining that copies were delivered 
anonymously to an Islah party leader.  The letter calls for 
supporting Jihad with money and fighting Jews and Christians. 
 The NGO representative assessed that the message was 
intended for Islah leaders who have condemned terrorism.  The 
Islah leader believes the author may be Iranian.  The 
translated text is provided below.  RSO notified appropriate 
Embassy and host nation officials.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU)  On 6/22/04, the Sanaa-based director of a U.S. 
NGO, who has resided in Yemen for the last three years, 
passed the RSO a letter entitled \"Iraqis Girls are being 
raped by the American Soldiers.\"  The letter specifically 
calls upon \"scholars of the nation\" to support Jihad by 
providing money and \"fighting our enemies the Jews and the 
Christians and their supporters.\" 
 
3.  (S/NF)  According to the NGO representative, an 
unidentified, presumably Yemeni individual placed 
approximately 11 copies under Islah Party Director Mohammed 
Qahtan\'s door.  The letters were addressed to senior Islah 
members, including Sheikh Zindani and Sheikh Abdullah 
Al-Ahmar.  (Note: Islah is an Islamic-oriented political 
party, constituting the main opposition to the leading 
General People\'s Congress party.) 
 
4.  (SBU)  The NGO representative opined that the letter is 
intended to send a message to influential Islamists in Yemen 
who, since the bombing of the USS Cole in 10/2000, have 
published statements condemning acts of terrorism. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Qahtan told the NGO representative that he 
believes the author could be Iranian based on the tone and 
diction of the Shia-oriented language.  Further, the letter 
is written in high-level Arabic by an educated individual. 
Finally, one of the addressees has been dead for three years. 
 
6.  (U)  The letter opens with one verse each from the Quran 
and the Hadith.  In addition, five icon-size photographs 
depicting Iraqi prisoner abuse in Abu Graib prison are 
attached to the top of the page. 
 
7.  (U)  Begin translated text: 
 
In order to clear our conscience, we write this letter to the 
heirs of the prophets, to the keepers of the land and leaders 
of the nation, who received the leadership role from the 
supreme leader prophet Mohammed who at the time of his 
leadership expelled the Jew of Qaino\'qa and took their women, 
children, money and lands as spoils of war because they 
exposed a Muslim woman\'s loin.  But where are those who hold 
the leadership position from the Prophet Mohammed when the 
honor of Muslim women in Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, 
Chechnya, Iraq and other places is assaulted. 
 
Don\'t you see?  Aren\'t you ardent about your religion and 
your sisters?  We ask you to think and don\'t be like those 
living who don\'t recognize it.  Wake up; scholars of the 
nation, without you the nation will never rise.  Realize the 
dimension of the danger and the rapid momentum of events that 
are going on.  Apply the duty assigned to you by Allah to 
defend the religion and save the nation, by supporting Jihad 
with money, incitation and fighting our enemies the Jews and 
the Christians and their supporters. 
 
You should learn that the best Jihad is a righteous and true 
word to an unjust Sultan (ruler). 
 
People of interests and corruption, what is more of a blight 
than destroying the foundation of Islam and assaulting our 
honor.  We say to those who mouth isn\'t able to speak the 
truth and who are unable to prevent hard descending on their 
families, leave us alone, we are moving on with the 
protection of Allah.  End translated text.

2. (c) Summary:  In a 6/23 meeting with the Ambassador, 
Yemen\'s National Atomic Energy Commission (NATEC) Director 
Moustapha Bahran renewed earlier requests for assistance on 
border security and radiological detection equipment 
(reftels).  Bahran initially cited alleged \"promises\" by the 
Departments of State and Energy, but when pressed by the 
Ambassador acknowledged that an agreement to cooperate does 
not equate to promises of specific deliverables.  While 
acknowledging that the May visit of a Radiological Threat 
Reduction (RTR) team was a positive step and that Yemen is 
not as high a priority as Eastern Europe, Bahran continued to 
push for increased cooperation on border security, 
specifically radiological detection equipment for key points 
of entry and technical training.  He suggested that Yemen 
could be a regional model on radiological safety/security and 
made a general offer to discuss assistance on 
non-proliferation issues with U/S Bolton.  End summary. 
 
DEBUNKING NATEC\'S VIEW OF DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY \"PROMISES\" - 
YEMEN AS A REGIONAL MODEL? 
 
3. (c) After some initial exchanges, Bahran launched into an 
explanation of his request for enhanced cooperation on border 
security and what he characterized as \"promises\" from the 
Department of Energy made during his July 2003 trip to 
Washington.  He provided a copy of his June 1 letter to 
Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham (ref a - see para. 7 for 
 
SIPDIS 
text) and said he is \"pleading\" with Secretary Abraham to 
move forward on borders.  Ambassador firmly suggested that 
Bahran should not say \"promises have been made\" when there is 
no documentation to support any official commitment and NATEC 
has not worked through the Embassy on the request.  Bahran 
pushed back, saying that his 2003 trip to the U.S. was 
coordinated through the Embassy and there was discussion of 
what commitments were made at that time.  (Note:  According 
to ref e, Bahran requested border monitoring equipment from 
NNSA and \"DOE officials expressed interest in the request for 
joint cooperation and pledged to provide a formal answer 
pending prioritization of other Second Line of Defense 
projects.\"  A negative response was formally provided by 
reftel c, which Post provided to NATEC on April 3 and NATEC 
acknowledged receiving.) 
 
4. (c)  Ambassador explained that there is no record of 
specific commitments (ref e), and trying to make general 
expressions of support into something more does not encourage 
cooperation.  Bahran maintained that there were promises to 
help, but eventually acknowledged that there were not 
commitments to specific items.  He also said it is good to 
engage in dialogue and finally admitted that \"for the sake of 
security\" he may have let his expectations shape Washington\'s 
responses as promises.  Bahran reiterated his request for 
four radiological monitoring devices at four points of entry 
(Sana\'a airport, Aden and Mukullah ports and the land border 
crossing at Haradh) that could cost upwards of $150,000 each. 
 Discussing Deputy Administrator of the National Nuclear 
Security Administration Longsworth\'s March letter to NATEC 
(ref b), he and the Ambassador agreed that while Yemen is not 
as high a priority as Eastern Europe, it could possibly be a 
model for the region because there is value in setting a 
standard to increase security.  Bahran noted that the letter 
also promised a response to Yemen\'s request for a Memorandum 
of Understanding (ref d), and renewed his oft-repeated 
request for a U.S.-Yemen MOU to facilitate additional 
cooperation. 
 
NATEC DIRECTOR OFFERS PERSONAL SUPPORT FOR NON-PROLIFERATION 
 
5. (c) At the end of the meeting, Bahran requested 
Ambassador\'s help in arranging for him to talk to 
Undersecretary Bolton.  He said he is willing to play \"any 
role allowed by the ROYG system\" in aiding non-proliferation 
efforts.  Ambassador commented on the Arab world\'s 
\"requirement\" to focus on Israeli capabilities and asked how 
this would affect any role Bahran might play.  Bahran 
confirmed that this is a concern, but said he would be a 
strong advocate for practical approaches to non-proliferation 
and is open to discussion about what he can/cannot do. 
 
U.S. SUPPORT FOR YEMEN AS A REGIONAL MODEL? 
 
6. (c) Comment/action request: Once the issue of purported 
promises was sorted out, Dr. Bahran forcefully made the case 
that Yemen needs both equipment and technical assistance. 
While Yemen is not a high threat for supplying radiological 
materials for a \"dirty bomb,\" it is a transit country for 
conventional weapons, especially to the Horn of Africa, and 
there is deterrent value in assisting to secure its borders. 
Post would therefore support such an effort to the extent it 
complements other counter-terrorism programs.  Accordingly, 
Post requests a response to Bahran\'s specific requests to the 
Department of Energy, as outlined in reftel a (see text in 
para. 8) with an eye toward using Yemen to set the standard 
for other Gulf countries.  End comment/action request.

Subject:  Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources 
 
Dear Mr. Secretary of Energy, 
 
The National Atomic Energy Commission (NATEC) presents its 
compliments to you.  This is in reference to the letter 
received from Mr. Paul Longsworth, Deputy Administrator for 
Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation at NNSA, of March 12, 2004 
and the recent visit of the DOE team to Yemen during (16-19) 
May 2004 regarding the above subject.  NATEC appreciates the 
US government interest in assisting the Republic of Yemen in 
upgrading the safety and security of radioactive sources. 
 
It is well known that the Republic of Yemen has a strong 
interest in the safety and security of radioactive sources in 
the Republic of Yemen, the Region and the World at large. 
This is reflected when one takes a first hand look at the 
Yemeni National System of control of radioactive sources as 
well as Yemen\'s leading role in the international arena in 
bringing this issue to the attention of the world\'s 
community.  In particular, Yemen has been closely working 
with governments such as the US, the European, and the 
Australian governments in drafting and adopting by consensus 
all related IAEA GC resolutions for the last three years.  In 
fact NATEC has started its international effort on this very 
important subject one year prior to the 9/11 tragic events. 
 
This is based on our stated goal to be a model in this area 
not only in the region but also to become a universal model. 
In order to do that, we have been successful as far as 
establishing a strong control system of safety and security 
of radioactive sources in Yemen. Yet, we can not claim 
neither perfection, nor complete effectiveness.  The reason 
is that we still need to monitor and control our borders as 
far as radioactive sources are concerned. As of today we do 
not have a system in place controlling possible illicit 
trafficking of nuclear and radioactive materials. 
 
During visits, discussion, and letters we have asked the US 
government (State Department, DOE, NNSA and NRC) and the IAEA 
for help.  We have studied our priorities in this regard. We 
know what needs to be done.  What we need urgently is the 
following: 
 
  1 - Border radiation monitoring equipment (stationary and 
portable). 
  2 - Training of relevant personnel to carry out this task 
and maintain the equipment. 
 
Promises has (sic) been verbally made, but till today nothing 
has materialized.  Furthermore, I had the honor of sending 
you a proposed MOU, which was acknowledged by Mr. Longsworth, 
but I am still waiting for a positive answer.  The proposed 
MOU will create an umbrella through which strong partnership 
can be formalized. True, we are already partners, but this 
partnership is yet to be formalized. 
 
As much as I express gratitude for your excellent cooperation 
on this subject and many others to come, I believe that 
additional efforts are needed such that our common and noble 
goals can be realized. 
 
The National Atomic Energy Commission of the Republic of 
Yemen avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the 
Department of Energy of the United States of America the 
assurance of its highest consideration.  Thank you and please 
accept my best regards 
 
Yours Sincerely, 
 
Dr. Moustafa Bahran 
Science and Technology Advisor to the President of the 
Republic 
Chairman - National Atomic Energy Commission

SUBJECT: DEMOCRACY IN ACTION: TEACHERS DEMONSTRATE AGAINST 
OPPOSITION HARDLINERS 
 
REF: SANAA 1611 
 
1. (U) Summary: The Al-Quds Girls Public School in Sanaa 
received a computer lab with brand-new equipment through a 
Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) grant.  After an 
American Embassy delegation visited the school, reports 
appeared in local newspapers stating that the female 
principal forced the students to uncover their heads for the 
delegation.  During Friday sermons at local mosques two 
opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) denounced the 
principal demanding her ousting and encouraging other mosques 
to do so as well, and advocated mandating the \"hijab\" (veil) 
and a more conservative uniform for female students.  In 
response, the school principal rallied a large number of 
teachers to resist publicly the hard-line MPs\' efforts.  End 
Summary. 
 
MEPI HELPS SPARK DEBATE 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U) On April 6, the Ambassador opened a MEPI-funded 
e-learning Internet Classroom at the Al-Quds Girls School, a 
local public school.  After the inauguration, visiting MEPI 
officers and American Embassy staff accompanied the school 
principal to visit a few of the classrooms to talk to the 
students about their science education, textbooks, requests 
for improving their educational experience, etc.  A local 
newspaper later reported that some of the schoolgirls claimed 
that the principal demanded they uncover their heads for the 
delegation. 
 
3. (SBU) On the following Friday, imams Shaykh Hazza\'a 
Al-Maswari and Shaykh Mohammed Al-Hazmi, both Members of 
Parliament affiliated with the opposition Islah Party, 
denounced the principal and demanded she be removed from her 
post.  (Note:  Al-Hazmi has also made anti-American 
statements and Emboffs have been informed that a government 
committee is being formed to investigate the al-Hazmi issue, 
see reftel.)  On May 18, newspapers came out on both sides of 
the issue.  Al-Balagh (independent Arabic weekly) wrote an 
op-ed piece calling for the dismissal of the principal. 
Al-Meethaq (GPC-affiliated Arabic weekly) criticized 
inaccurate information circulated by some press regarding the 
Al-Quds school and the Islah-affiliated imams for allegedly 
slandering the principal.  It also noted that the principal 
has filed an anti-slander lawsuit in court against the press. 
 
4. (U) Al-Motamar Net (GPC-affiliated Arabic news website) 
reported on June 13 that the Al-Quds school e-learning issue 
had turned into a political argument between the ruling 
party, the General People\'s Congress Party (GPC), and the 
opposition Islah Party.  According to the site, claims that 
the principal forced girl students to unveil were manipulated 
by Islah to institute more conservative public school 
uniforms. 
 
TEACHERS DEMONSTRATE AGAINST MPs 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) On June 9, female teachers staged a demonstration, 
marching to Parliament to protest offensive statements 
allegedly made by the two MPs.  (Note: Press estimates of the 
crowd range from \"hundreds\" to two thousand to 20 thousand.) 
As reported in the Yemen Observer (independent English 
weekly) June 12 issue, the demonstrators asked Parliament to 
strip the two men of their parliamentary immunity and bring 
them to justice for the insults they allegedly directed at 
the principal and certain schoolteachers.  A press statement 
issued by the protesters stated that the two MPs launched a 
campaign of slander against female teachers and the girls, 
school principal as a ploy to impose more conservative 
uniforms in public schools, including the hijab. 
 
6. (U) According to a few press reports, some of the teachers 
did not know why they were marching.  When informed by press 
of the subject of the demonstration, some teachers allegedly 
disagreed with the demonstration\'s organizers and withdrew 
from the protest.  Others confessed that they had taken part 
in the rally under threat of salary reductions.  The families 
of the female students marched in counter-protest.  Reports 
indicated they were organized by the Islah Party to protest 
the GPC\'s campaign to institute a more liberal school 
uniform, which would leave the girls, faces uncovered. 
 
7. (SBU) DCM and PD Chief met with the Minister of Education 
Abdul Salam al-Jowfi, who said that the Internet classrooms 
were not the issue in the dispute.  In fact, information 
gathered by PD showed that the problem arose prior to the 
e-learning classroom inauguration. 
 
8. (SBU) COMMENT: While the MEPI program did not directly 
encourage this democratic action, American presence in the 
schools was exploited to garner public support against the 
GPC-supported school principal.  The teachers\' demonstration 
against parliamentarian pressure is an example of Yemen\'s 
nascent democracy.  End Comment.

 1. (U) Summary:  After several delays (reftel), Sanaa was 
the venue for a significant religious gathering June 20-24, 
the \"Mutamar al-Irshad al-Awal\" (First Guidance Conference), 
which brought together Muslim clerics, scholars, and 
ministers of religious affairs from Arab and Muslim states. 
The main purpose of the conference was to promote the 
moderate and tolerant aspects of Islam and to disassociate it 
from ideas of extremism and terrorism.  The ROYG Prime 
Minister Ba Jammal addressed the participants at the opening 
session, while President Saleh addressed them upon receiving 
them at his palace.  The conference made a number of 
recommendations at its conclusion (see para 6), demanding, 
among other things, the convening of an international 
conference to define the phenomenon of terrorism, its causes, 
and means of tackling it.  ROYG Deputy Minister of Awqaf 
(Endowments) and Guidance presented a booklet titled 
\"Terrorism: Its Threats and Means of Combating It\" (see para 
7).  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Conference Proceedings 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) More than 270 Muslim clerics, thinkers and some 
ministers from the Arab and Muslim world attended the 
four-day conference (June 20 - 24), which was organized by 
the ROYG Ministry of Awqaf and Guidance after several delays 
because of regional developments (reftel).   Speeches 
delivered at the opening session by prominent figures, such 
as the Chairman of Al-Azahar University, Sheikh Tantawi and 
the Sudanese Minister of Awqaf and Guidance, called for 
underscoring the true teachings of Islam that are based on 
tolerance and acceptance of the other.  The two scholars also 
criticized extremist ideas and acts of violence that are 
carried out in the name of Islam and asserted that these acts 
are alien to Islam and that Islam totally rejects them.  The 
Al-Azahar Chief, at one point, harshly attacked the acts of 
beheading (without specifically mentioning AmCit Paul 
Johnson, whose beheading took place in the same week) and 
said these acts fatally defame Islam and Muslims. 
 
3. (U) Over the course of the conference, topics discussed 
included the unity of the nation and ways of achieving it; 
crisis of contemporary thought and the inevitability of 
modernization; missionary work and Islamic thought; 
regulations of recompense in Islam; and differentiation 
between the concept of terrorism and the legitimate struggle 
(see para 6). 
 
4. (U) According to the GPC ruling party weekly newspaper May 
22, during one session, Sheikh Abdul-Majeed al-Zindani, the 
Head of the Shura Council of the opposition Islah Party and 
Chairman of al-Iman University, expressed his reservations 
regarding the condemnation of terrorism.  Zindani explained: 
\"Terrorism is using weapons beyond the Shari\'a and the law, 
but using weapons within the framework of the Sharia and the 
law is not considered an act of terrorism.\" 
 
------------------------- 
President Saleh,s Remarks 
------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Hosting the participants at his palace, President 
Saleh lectured them on the effects of what he said was a 
misinterpretation of Islamic teachings.  He harshly attacked 
those Ulema (Muslim clerics) who mobilized Muslim youth 
wrongly and said the foreign intervention in the affairs of 
Islamic world is a result of this wrong education.  According 
to government daily al-Thawra newspaper, President Saleh said 
\"the support that was rendered at certain periods to the 
extremist schools was to confront the expansion of communism 
in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East region.  However, 
peoples are paying the price.\"  He also said that \"when we 
notified the young men that their ideas were wrong, they told 
us why didn\'t we ask the ulema or clerics who taught them and 
that they were only victims.\" 
 
-------------------------- 
Conference Recommendations 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The conference came up with the following main 
recommendations: 
 
-- Adoption of a scientific method to define the phenomenon 
of terrorism, its causes and ways of dealing with it through 
an international conference that will differentiate between 
terrorism and the rights of peoples to resist occupation; 
 
-- Rebuff of terrorism in all its forms for the threats it 
brought to the world in general and the Muslim world in 
particular; 
 
-- The need for adopting perceptive guidance based on the 
Quranic evidence, clarification, and persuasiveness in 
spreading Islamic religion; 
 
-- Consolidation of human rights awareness that has been 
conveyed by Islam and the need for giving attention to 
women,s rights and issues; 
 
-- The need for a rejuvenation of Islamic thoughts. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Deputy Minister of Awqaf and Guidance Paper On Terrorism 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
7. (U) Post received a booklet written by Sheikh Yahya Ahmed 
al-Najjar, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Awqaf and 
Guidance called \"Terrorism: Its Threats & Means of Combating 
It\" published by the Ministry.  Post will pouch both the full 
text Arabic original and the 15-page English translation done 
by Post to the desk.  Intended to promote moderation and 
combat terrorism, the five-part paper covers the following 
topics: 
 
-- Part One attempts to define terror and terrorism from 
several sources, including the Quran, Arab language 
dictionaries, academic analysis, English encyclopedias and 
dictionaries, the Arab League and the United Nations; 
 
-- Part Two describes the characteristics of terrorism and 
its motives, using five different terrorist acts (including, 
for example, Oklahoma City and 1995 Khobar Towers) to draw 
conclusions; 
 
-- Part Three describes why terrorism is bad, i.e., the 
threats of terrorism on religious, political, economic and 
security in the Muslim and Arab world; 
 
-- Part Four covers Islam\'s position on terrorism, including 
historical descriptions of war in Islam, quotes from Shari\'a 
and the Quran and detailing seven specific human rights 
afforded by Islam; 
 
-- Part Five outlines the means of combating terrorism, 
including listing the treatment of political, economic and 
social problems necessary, detailing specific suggestions on 
how to combat it and providing six guiding principles for the 
role of preachers and religious institutions.

Comment

8. (C) This conference is part of efforts by the ROYG to 
promote its brand of reform and moderation through the 
convening of international conferences, such as the January 
2004 conference on Democracy, Human Rights and the Role of 
the International Criminal Court.  While it remains to be 
seen whether there is additional practical follow up, the 
ROYG has been engaged since before 9/11 in promoting 
moderation in religious schools.  Recently the ROYG also 
announced it will be closing unlicensed religious schools and 
that schools may not deviate from a government-approved 
curriculum (septel).  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary/Comment: Senior Ministry of Planning official 
Nabil Shaiban confirmed that President Saleh has decided to 
delay economic reform, but reiterated the ROYG\'s long-term 
committment to implementation.  The decision comes in spite 
of the recent IMF mission headed by Senior Economist Saad 
Chami, which heavily encouraged advancing the reforms.  The 
delay is no surprise; for the average Yemeni, economic reform 
equals price increases and there has been no attempt by the 
ROYG to justify the reforms to the populace.  Several 
contacts cited Parliament\'s newfound strength from the recent 
oil-scandal (ref a) and many MPs were outspoken in their 
opposition.  Blunt messages from the IMF and donors on the 
necessity of economic reform may sway reform-minded 
ministers, but the tough political decision to implement 
reforms remains with President Saleh who seems to have 
calculated that the political climate is not ready for an 
economic austerity package.  End summary/comment. 
 
2. (SBU) Background:  The economic reform package (ref b) 
consists of five measures designed to wean Yemen away from 
depending on oil for state revenue, trim a bloated civil 
service and enhance the investment climate.  The five aspects 
are a) General Sales Tax (GST); b) reduction of the diesel 
subsidy; c) civil service reform to include wage increases; 
d) customs and tariff reform; and e) investment law reform. 
While not legally necessary, the ROYG has submitted the 
package to Parliament for approval.  The reforms were widely 
expected to go into effect this summer.  End background. 
 
------------------------ 
Whither Economic Reform? 
------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) On 7/11 Ministry of Planning and International 
Cooperation Director General for the Americas and Europe 
Nabil Shaiban told Pol/Econoff that Saleh summoned Prime 
Minister Ba Jammal and Deputy Prime Minister and Minster of 
International Cooperation Sofan for intensive discussions 
over the diesel subsidy reduction and advised them that he 
has decided to \"postpone implementation for a few months.\" 
Shaiban added that DPM Sofan told Saleh that \"We need to 
rally public support on the positive aspects of the economic 
reforms.\"  Shaiban said that Saleh wants to build public 
trust and counter opposition to the programs.  Closing the 
subject, Shaiban reiterated that ROYG\'s plan to implement the 
economic reforms.  He added that DPM Sofan asked British 
Department for International Development (DFID) to \"study the 
socio-economic impact\" of reducing the diesel subsidy. 
 
---------------------------------- 
IMF DELIVERS BLUNT MESSAGE TO ROYG 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) On 7/7, IMF Middle East Director Saad Chami 
summarized to Ambassador the results of the IMF\'s latest 
consultations with ROYG officials, saying his team delivered 
a \"blunt, direct message to ROYG officials that they must 
implement the reforms.\"  ROYG officials cited \"regional 
circumstances,\" especially the security situation to Chami as 
justification to delay most aspects of the reform package 
(ref a), except for the civil service wage increase.  Chami 
said that IMF understands Yemen\'s \"difficult circumstances\" 
and accepted the ROYG argument, but warned officials that 
failure to implement reforms could produce serious economic 
consequences in 5-6 years. 
 
5. (SBU) According to Chami, powerful businessmen convinced 
Parliament to delay GST implementation until July 1, 2005. 
However, Chami is encouraged that former Minister of Finance 
and present Shura Council member, Mohammed Junaid, was tapped 
to lead a GST study committee.  The new committee will review 
the proposed GST and submit a report explaining its impact to 
President Saleh in March 2005.  Chami commented that a year 
delay in the GST is not a significant setback because it is 
intended to compensate for projected state revenue losses due 
to declining oil production.  In response to a question 
regarding ROYG transparency regarding GST implementation, IMF 
team member Bin Latifa interjected that the business 
community is \"pretending not to understand\" the GST, noting 
their real objection is that they would be subject to audits. 
 
6. (SBU) Turning to the oil subsidy, Chami stated that high 
oil prices now cost the ROYG 5.5 percent of GDP or roughly 
725 million USD per year to subsidize fuel.  According to 
Chami, ROYG officials including PM Ba Jammal, Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minster of Finance Salami, DPM Sofan and the 
Head of the Shura Council, all acknowledged the ROYG\'s 
declining oil revenue and understood the necessity for 
serious economic reform.  However, Chami added, \"very 
powerful\" people are blocking the diesel subsidy. 
 
7. (SBU) Director of Payment Systems for the Central Bank of 
Yemen Omar Bazara confirmed on 7/16 to economic specialist 
that the IMF had delivered a tough message to ROYG officials. 
 Bazara said that ROYG officials are keeping the negative 
information very quiet and were \"astonished\" at the poor 
economic picture portrayed by the IMF.

1. (c) At the opening of a 7/18 meeting, Dr. Ahmed Alwan 
Mulhi, Deputy Director of the Department of International 
Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
preempted subject demarche by launching a tirade against the 
U.S. position on Israel and \"ineffective\" U.S. efforts to 
persuade Israel to cease construction of the security 
barrier.  Before Pol/Econ Chief was able to broach the 
subject of the ICJ advisory opinion, Mulhi stated that the 
USG should \"challenge\" the GOI and convince Israel to accept 
existing UN resolutions.  Mulhi came prepared with copies of 
all of the UN resolutions on Israel-Palestine and recited a 
list of them going back years to make his point.  He sharply 
criticized the Bush administration for not taking action to 
stop the \"massacres\" in Palestine. 
 
2. (c) Noting that President Bush endorses a vision of two 
states, Pol/Econ Chief refocused the meeting on the ICJ 
advisory opinion (ref a), especially U.S. concerns with the 
referral of the matter to the ICJ, the effect of such a 
referral to a negotiated settlement and the legal reasoning 
of the Court\'s opinion.  Mulhi was very familiar with the 
issue and in response to our urging for a vote against the 
resolution or an abstention, stated unequivocally that \"the 
U.S., Israel and maybe one or two banana republics\" would 
cast the lone votes against the resolution when it comes to a 
vote on Monday or Tuesday.\"  He went on to say that the U.S. 
should be more reasonable and balanced in its approach, and 
less supportive of Sharon.  When Pol/Econ Chief noted that 
the opinion does not address Palestinian security 
responsibilities, Mulhi said that the UN is the proper venue 
for discussing the subject and if it were put to a vote in 
the security council there would be 14 votes in support of 
the ICJ\'s ruling. 
 
3. (c) Comment:  While it is not unusual to get some 
criticism of U.S. policy toward Israel, usually along the 
lines of the U.S. applying a \"double standard,\" the vehemence 
of Mulhi\'s argument was surprising.  The basic tenor at the 
end of the meeting was that we need to agree to disagree. 
Needless to say, Yemen is very likely to support the UN 
resolution endorsing the advisory opinion.  End comment.

discussions was \"difficult\" and \"not good for the U.S.\" 
Pol/Econ Chief explained that the U.S. has taken the 
allegations against the perpetrators of abuse at Abu Ghraib 
seriously and following investigations has commenced 
prosecuting criminal behavior, as demonstrated by the recent 
court martial proceedings. 
 
2. (c) In subsequent email exchanges on 7/14 and 7/16, Noman 
clarified that the Article 98 agreement has not been ratified 
for \"administrative reasons\" and promised to provide status 
updates on any changes.

1. (C) President Saleh received me July 20 for my farewell 
call.  In his remarks, he expressed satisfaction with 
US-Yemeni relations and particularly the progress on counter 
terrorism in Yemen over the past three years.  Saleh added 
appreciation for my efforts and acknowledged that he had at 
times been somewhat harsh in dealing with me. Yemen is a 
small poor country, he explained, and needed to use the 
American ambassador to send strong messages to a U.S. 
government that was preoccupied with important issues 
worldwide.  In turn, I thanked Saleh for his leadership on 
counter terrorism which had won the support of the Yemeni 
people, and I praised him for the positive steps taken 
towards establishing democracy in Yemen.  What remained to 
do, I stressed, was serious economic reforms that would 
provide effective government services, create jobs and reduce 
corruption. 
 
2. (C) Noting continuing government operations in Sa\'ada 
against al Huthi, Saleh again made a plea for USG technology 
to locate al Huthi via his use of the telephone.  Al Huthi 
had conducted an extended interview with BBC July 19, Saleh 
noted.  Saleh also asked me to follow up on licenses for 
F5/C130 spare parts, expressing an understanding that the US 
military supply process was often a slow one. 
 
3. (C) I then provided Saleh with the Secretary\'s letter on 
manpads (reftel) and an Arabic translation of it.  Saleh 
perused the document and commented that the Yemeni military 
is currently confiscating many weapons, for example RPGs, 
from al Huthi\'s supporters.  I noted that the Secretary\'s 
focus was on manpads, and Saleh said he would study it 
carefully. 
 
4. (C) After being presented with the customary gift -- a 
Yemeni unity medal -- I took my leave.

Summary and Comment: 
-------------------- 
 
1. (S)  After an estimated 400-500 deaths, a large number of 
injured on both sides and roughly 400 al-Houthy supporters 
detained, the fighting in the Sa\'da region in the north of 
Yemen remains inconclusive. A cease-fire was recently 
announced by the Government but non-official accounts 
indicate that the fight continues. Rumors abound concerning 
the role of the tribes in the region, the fate of al-Houthy 
himself and the possible spread of the fighting beyond the 
Merran mountains into the urban areas of Sa\'da. The ROYG has 
accused al-Houthy of having procured foreign connections and 
funding and would have us believe that this is, therefore, a 
fight against international terrorism. Post cannot verify 
such claims nor justify such a conclusion. Nevertheless, the 
conflict has developed into a major test of the state\'s 
ability to exert its authority and crush a rebellion that, in 
the eyes of many here, has already caused rifts that could 
lead to serious sectarian and/or tribal strife. (Comment: It 
is not in the U.S. interest to allow President Saleh to be 
personally humiliated in this fight nor the state 
institutions to become weakened as a result of it). End 
summary and comment. 
 
------------------------ 
Origins of the conflict: 
------------------------ 
 
2. (S) Per ref(a), al-Houthy\'s provocations date back two 
years when his lectures/sermons turned more radical and 
lambasted the government for its \"encouragement of foreign 
invaders.\" al-Houthy\'s sloganeering (death to America, death 
to Israel) led to demonstrations against the U.S. which 
resulted in the arrest of some of his supporters. Having 
first supported al-Houthy\'s break with the Islamist al-Haq 
party and the formation of a new \"Shabab al-Mou\'mineen\" (The 
Believing Youth) group, our contacts and interlocutors differ 
on what led to President Saleh\'s about-face with al-Houthy. 
Many refer to a presidential visit last year to Sa\'da while 
enroute to performing \"Omra\" in Mekka. It is said that Saleh 
was practically turned away from speaking at a local mosque 
with anti-American and anti-Israeli chants. Other stories 
speak of a confrontation between al-Houthy and the Governor 
of Sa\'da in which Saleh took the side of his Governor and 
ordered the arrest of al-Houthy. Some say al-Houthy was 
simply \"invited\" to appear before Saleh, an offer which he 
turned down, precipitating a confrontation with the soldiers 
who were dispatched to escort al-Houthy to Sanaa. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
al-Houthy\'s movement: Sectarian or ideological in nature? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
3. (S) The ROYG would have us believe that they are engaged 
in a fight against international terrorism because of 
al-Houthy\'s purported regional connections. Saleh has 
personally described al-Houthy\'s \"rebellion\" as inspired by 
Iran. His ministers have endorsed this view but have also 
pointed at times to possible support from Saudi Arabia. The 
Saudi Government has recently issued a statement denying any 
involvement and supporting Saleh in his quest to restore law 
and order in Sa\'da. Iran has also distanced itself from 
al-Houthy (FM Qirbi received a phone call to that effect from 
the Iranian ambassador to Sanaa while he was at lunch with 
Ambassador and DCM last week. The Iranian ambassador promised 
a statement but we have not yet seen it). Regardless of 
claims and counter claims, we have not seen any intelligence 
confirming al-Houthy\'s alleged links to international 
terrorism or to official Iranian support. Further, 
conversations with the moderate Islamist party, al-Islah, 
have revealed a very strong distaste by this Sunni movement 
to what they describe as a Shia (Zaidi) rebellion. The 
socialist YSP, although critical of Saleh for rushing into an 
armed conflict, have also described al-Houthy\'s movement as 
sectarian and a potential threat to national unity. Saleh and 
his ministers, in fact, unselfconsciously refer to al-Houthy 
supporters as Shia, indicating that they think of them as a 
religious rather than a political faction. Several 
independent interlocutors have referred to the  Zaidis as 
ardent believers, still, in the return of the Imamate under 
Zaidi control and on that bases reject the legitimacy of the 
republic. 
 
----------------------------- 
What\'s at stake for the ROYG? 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (S) Regardless of the origins of this fight and of any 
possible outside connections for al-Houthy, the confrontation 
between him and President Saleh has taken on a dynamic of its 
own with serious consequences for both sides. Several hundred 
al-Houthy followers are currently in Sanaa jails. They are 
reportedly being \"interviewed\" by Supreme Court Judge 
al-Hitar who has thus far failed to persuade any of them to 
denounce al-Houthy. Should al-Houthy fall into government 
hands, the Government intends to charge him with serious 
crimes against the state, but promises a fair trial. This, of 
course, provided he survives his capture. Despite continued 
talk of mediation efforts, for Saleh, the al-Houthy rebellion 
has lasted too long and cost too many lives to allow for a 
negotiated settlement. The challenge is not only personal for 
the president, it has also put the prestige of the state on 
the line. If al-Houthy, reportedly with some tribal support 
(jealous over their turf being trampled by the government), 
can evade the arm of the law with impunity it would set a 
very bad precedent for other Zaidis and possibly tribes and 
political factions around the country who may also entertain 
questions regarding the legitimacy of the republic. Religious 
strife between Sunnis and Zaidis may also, according to some 
local observers, be a dangerous outcome of a failure to 
suppress al-Houthy\'s movement. Such scenarios cannot but ring 
alarm bells for the Saleh regime at a time when he is 
desperately trying to promote Yemen as a partner to the U.S. 
and the European countries in development and democratization 
projects in the Middle East. Saleh has personally asked us, 
the French and the Saudis for public statements of support 
for his government in its confrontation with al-Houthy. 
 
---------------------------- 
What\'s at stake for the USG? 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (S) Pending further information, post cannot confirm or 
rule out any links of al-Houthy to international terrorism. 
That said, al-Houthy\'s rhetoric and behavior are dangerous 
for internal stability and for U.S. interests in Yemen and 
the region. Antipathy for the U.S. is clearly very strongly 
felt by al-Houthy and his followers. Further, a failure to 
bring the al-Houthy movement under control would risk having 
the Sa\'da region wriggle out of the central government\'s 
control and would encourage tribes in the region to assert 
their own rejection of the state\'s writ in their areas. the 
Saleh government, for all its shortcomings, has committed 
itself to fighting regional terrorism and to implementing 
political and economic reforms in cooperation with the USG 
and the EU. A discredited and weakened regime would not be 
able to follow through on such commitments. 
 
-------------- 
Policy Comment: 
-------------- 
 
6. (S) Whereas U.S. assistance to Yemen on the social, 
political and economic fronts has been substantial and 
unabashed, assistance on the military front (particularly as 
related the recent Sa\'da fighting) has been more low key and 
low-profile. This, in our view, is as it should be, given the 
balancing act Saleh has to perform in cementing his ties with 
the west while retaining the posture of the leader of an 
independent and sovereign country. Our support also needs to 
drive a balance between supporting stability and security 
without encouraging the rash use of force while disregarding 
human rights and the rule of law.

1.  (C)  Embassy sources contradict press accounts that ROYG 
forces encircled extremist Shi\'ite leader Hussein al-Houthi 
in the northern region of Marran on August 5.  Rather it

continues to be particularly bloody for the ROYG.

saying ROYG forces controlled the Jabal al-Hakimi area where 
al-Houthi and his aides were reportedly holed-up.  Despite 
high casualties, failed cease-fires, and rising concerns over 
sectarian strife and tribal intervention, the ROYG maintains 
that the conflict will soon be resolved positively. Press 
accounts cite low casualty numbers and repeatedly talk of 
mediation efforts. 
 
3.  (C)  Comment:  The ROYG\'s optimistic portrayal of events 
is likely designed to mask the Central Government\'s

large scale fighting and reported tribal discontent could 
threaten Saleh\'s careful balance between tribal and political

1. (SBU) Summary/Comment: On an 8/4-8/6 introductory visit to 
Aden, CDA met Deputy Governor Shaif, representatives of 
political parties, businessmen, security and Coast Guard 
officials and members of civil society.  The recent firing of 
a corrupt official running the Aden Free Zone, some increase 
in transshipment rates through the Free Port, and new 
investment opportunities bring renewed hope for Aden\'s 
future.  However, expats and local businessmen expressed 
continued frustration over corruption and bureaucratic delays 
at the Free Zone and Port.  Opposition party representatives 
underscored downward trends in democratic development and 
press freedom, but noted clear improvements in Aden\'s 
infrastructure and economic development.  The ROYG\'s new 
attention to long-standing management issues at the Aden Free 
Zone and Free Port indicate that the ROYG may now be taking 
Aden\'s significance to continued long-term economic stability 
seriously.  A visit to the independent daily \"al-Ayyam\" 
provided an opportunity to reinforce Mission message on USG 
policy goals in Yemen. End summary/comment. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Aden: Still Recovering from 1994 Civil War 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On 8/4 Deputy Governor of Aden and General People\'s 
Congress Party Chairman Abdulkarim Shaif described to CDA 
Aden\'s infrastructure development projects, including 
improvements to roads, electricity and telecommunication 
networks.  Rebuilding after the 1994 civil war, Shaif said, 
was a great challenge and the local government is working to 
alleviate several remaining problems, including the issue of 
19,000 families living in nationalized houses whose owners 
want to return. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
New Management for Aden Free Zone and Free Port 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (U) After the 2002 attack on the French tanker Limburg, 
shipping traffic through the Aden Free Port decreased by 75% 
to roughly 12,000 Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) per 
month as a result of a 300% increase in insurance rates for 
transshipment.  In June 2003, the ROYG struck a deal to 
reduce insurance prices and shipping is slowly returning to 
Aden.  Today, an estimated 24,000 TEUs per month pass through 
the Aden Free Port, roughly 35% of the pre-Limburg rate of 
60,000 TEUs per month.  In early 2004, the ROYG bought out 
the Singapore operator of the Free Port and separated the 
management of the Free Port from the Free Zone.   A Dutch 
company, under contract by the ROYG, will soon be issuing an 
international tender for the running of the port. 
 
4. (U) Shaif referred to the 7/20 firing of the notoriously 
corrupt former Director of the Aden Free Zone General Dirham 
Noman as a positive step and explained that Governor Shu\'aibi 
is now temporarily in charge of the Free Zone.  Shaif 
continued that the Port faced stiff competition from Dubai 
and Oman, but was confident that Aden\'s prime location would 
soon win back companies and trade would expand.  Shuaibi is 
presently writing a report on the Free Zone\'s future and will 
submit his recommendation to the Prime Minister and 
President. 
 
5. (U) General Manager of Aden International Marine 
Corporation Mohammed Assara, who operates a factory in the 
Aden Free Zone, said the Free Zone \"is not what was 
expected.\"  Assara added that he now employs only 180 
persons, but had originally planned for 500.  Complaining 
that there was no central customs organization for the Free 
Zone,  Assara said he continuously looses 3-5 days in his 
shipping time working through needless bureaucratic hassles. 
While several Yemeni businessmen and members of civil society 
expressed optimism over the changes to the Free Port and Free 
Zone, expats were adopting a \"wait and see attitude.\"  A PSI 
Shipping Agent told Pol/Econoff that while shipping rates 
seem to be higher, he expects them to drop significantly next 
month. He was pessimistic that management changes at the Free 
Port and Free Zone would alleviate long-standing problems. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Mixed Reviews on Democratic Progress; 
NGOs Seek Enhanced USG Support 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Islah Political Party Deputy Chairman Dr. Jamal 
al-Lawzi and Yemen Socialist Party Chief Ali Munnasar 
expressed concern over what they viewed as a downward trend 
in democratic development in Yemen.  Noting that the joint 
working party between Islah and the Socialist was \"a work in 
progress,\" both pointed to what they viewed as an increased 
concentration of power by the GPC.  Pointing to GPC 
interference with counting procedures during the 2003 
parliamentary elections, Lawzi and Munnassar saw the GPC as 
the main source of corruption in Yemen.  In a separate 
meeting with Aden based NGOs,  representatives described 
their agendas to CDA, including poverty alleviation and 
empowerment of women.  CDA expressed willingness to work with 
members of civil society to encourage reforms and encouraged 
NGO leaders to form internal and regional networks in order 
to make better use of capacity-building training programs. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Al-Ayyam Editor Concerned over Shrinking Press Freedom 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7. (U) On 8/6 Basha Basharheel, editor-in-chief of Aden based 
al-Ayyam newspaper, interviewed CDA on a wide range of 
bilateral and regional subjects.  The interview allowed CDA 
to reinforce Mission message on political and economic 
reforms as well as on U.S.- Iraq policy.  In an earlier 
conversation, Basharheel said press freedom is \"shrinking 
considerably\" and that self-censorship is practiced daily in 
editorial meetings.  In some cases, Basharheel added, 
Al-Ayyam has received a call from the President\'s office 
informing al-Ayyam that it is unacceptable to report on an 
issue, as in the case of the al-Honeish islands dispute. 
Other matters, such as Ali Muhsen Al-Ahmar\'s and Zindani\'s 
roles in cultivating religious extremism prior to the 1994 
civil war, Basharheel said, are simply understood as off 
limits.  Turning to Aden\'s overall development, Basharheel 
observed that many people have lost confidence in local 
councils because there is no visible accomplishment. 
However, Basharheel affirmed that Governor Shu\'aibi is making 
progress in Aden and that his efforts to build infrastructure 
were widely praised.

the Minister of Defense maintained that the conflict would be

Defense Minister\'s Surprise appearance at MFA 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (S)  Charge was summoned on August 11 by Foreign Minister 
Abubakr Abdullah al-Qirby and Minister of Interior Rashad 
Mohammed al-Alimi to discuss \"bilateral issues.\"  Upon 
arrival at the MFA, the FM informed Charge that al-Alimi had 
a pressing engagement and presented, instead, Minister of 
Defense Abdullah Ali Alaiwa and his Intelligence Chief 
Siyanni. 
 
3.  (S)  Al-Qirby stressed the importance of U.S.- Yemeni 
cooperation in the combating of terrorism, and launched into 
a request for specific U.S intelligence information to aid 
the ROYG in the on-going and increasingly bloody conflict 
between ROYG forces and the supporters of al-Houthi in the 
northern Sa\'da region.  The FM quickly added, however, that 
the situation in general is \"under control.\" 
 
4.  (S)  Defense Minister Alaiwa continued that the ROYG 
needed specific U.S. intelligence assistance to locate 
elements of al-Houthi supporters in \"other areas\" of the 
country by eavesdropping on their wireless and hand-held 
radio communications.  He said that Yemen did not have the 
technical capability to listen to these communications, but 
could provide specific \"numbers\" and \"frequencies\" for the 
U.S. to target.  When pressed by DATT, Alaiwa could not offer 
further information as to the type of wireless or radios. 
 
5.  (S)  Charge responded that the USG would like to assist 
if it can, but that several issues would first have to be 
addressed, including, whether we had the capability, if it 
was currently available in the region, and whether it would 
be possible to share such information.  Charge and DATT 
promised to pass the request through the appropriate 
channels. 
 
Al-Houthi \"Surrounded on Three Sides\" 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Charge asked Defense Minister Alaiwa for an update 
of the situation in Sa\'da.  Alaiwa reported that his forces 
now controlled approximately ninety-eight percent of the area 
where the fighting has been taking place, except for portions 
of Jabal Salman (north-western portion of the area of 
engagement).  Charge asked if it was true that the Army has 
al-Houthi surrounded, as reported in the press.  \"He is 
surrounded on three sides,\" responded Alaiwa insisting that 
he was certain that al-Houthi had not escaped from the Jabal 
Salman area, and added that the two sides continue to 
exchange small arms fire, separated by 200 to 300 meters of 
rugged and difficult terrain.  Al-Alaiwa said al-Houthi had 
200 to 300 fighters left.  When the Charge expressed surprise 
at the small number, Intelligence Chief Siyanni shook his 
head and interrupted \"no, more than that.\" 
 
7.  (C) Comment:  On the margins, the Defense Minister told 
Charge that if the requested intelligence information was not 
provided in the next three or so days, it would be 
unnecessary, as the fighting would be over.  This has been a 
consistent ROYG message throughout the two-month long 
conflict.  In our view, the fighting is not likely to end 
anytime soon.  This request for intelligence assistance 
suggests that the ROYG is not only shaken by its inability to 
defeat al-Houthi quickly, but fears the conflict may spread 
to other areas of the country.  End Comment.

1.  (C)  Begin Summary:  The CDA convened an EAC 
meeting on August 11, 2004, to share security 
concerns with regard to recent incidents in the Al-Jawf 
region and to remind the Embassy community to remain 
vigilant in light of recent threat reporting and to 
report all security related incidents immediately to 
the RSO. EAC members noted no specific threats against 
Embassy Sanaa The American community continues to remain 
in a high state of security awareness even in the absence 
of specific threat against Americans or the Embassy. 
Key offices and personnel represented included:  FPD, 
OMC, ORCA, POL/ECON ,HU, CCE-Yemen, and RSO. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  (C)  CDA referred EAC members to recent incidents 
in the Al-Jawf region.  On July 28th, 2004, members 
of ADRA (USAID contractors) traveling in the Al-Jawf 
region were stopped in what appeared to be an attempted 
car-jacking and forced to return to their point of 
origin. The following day on July 29, 2004, ADRA 
members were fired upon while attempting to enter 
the same region.  No injuries were incurred. 
 
3. (C/NF) FPD discussed two Aug 7, 2004 incidents while 
traveling in the Al-Jawf region.  During a refueling stop 
a large crowd gathered around an FPD motorcade and several 
local villagers began chanting \"the Americans are here, it 
is a good day to die.\"  FPD and CCE members left the area 
immediately. Several hours later while approaching a school, 
the FPD motorcade was fired upon by a burst of three rounds 
believed to be from an AK-47. FPD and CCE members were 
subsequently informed by a local Sheikh the shots were 
meant as a warning to deter travelers from entering the area. 
 
 
4.  (C)  CDA emphasized that any incidents regarding 
security regardless of how insignificant it may seem at 
the time should be reported to the RSO in order 
to analyze trends in regard to both terrorism related 
matters and incidents relating to crime.  CDA added 
that creating a threat composite would also give the 
community a better understanding of the threat environment 
and allow the Embassy to make more informed recommendations 
to the Department concerning the need to either upgrade, or 
downgrade Post\'s security posture. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Post Advisory Actions 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C)  CDA recommended convening an EAC meeting once a 
month regardless of any direct threat against the Embassy. 
RSO was asked track increases or decreases in security 
incidents 
and present findings to EAC members.

Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY DCM NABEEL KHOURY, FOR REASONS 
1.5 (a) and (d) 
 
-------- 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
1. (SBU) On his second working day in Sanaa, Ambassador 
Krajeski presented his credentials to President Ali Abdallah 
Saleh in a ceremony that included seven other Ambassadors, 
some of whom had waited three months to be invited to present 
their papers. The ceremonies, full of all the appropriate 
pomp and circumstance, included a courtesy meeting with Saleh 
and Foreign Minister Qirbi. Beyond the expected opening 
welcoming remarks, President Saleh did step lightly into a 
couple of substantive remarks on U.S.-Yemeni relations. 
Ambassador used the opportunity to ask Saleh directly to meet 
with A/S Bloomfield as soon as his schedule permitted. End 
Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
Beyond the formalities: 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) Ambassador Krajeski expressed his personal delight at 
assuming his responsibiilties in Sanaa and conveyed President 
Bush and Secretary Powell\'s greetings and good wishes to 
President Saleh. In his turn, President Saleh welcomed 
Ambassador Krajeski and promised him the full cooperation of 
the MFA and other Yemeni ministries and institutions to 
assist him in supporting U.S. interests and in furthering 
U.S.-Yemeni cooperation. President Saleh said, \"We have been 
excellent partners in the war against terrorism, now let\'s do 
the same in the economic and commercial fields to combat 
poverty and create jobs for the young and unemployed.\" Saleh 
also unexpectedly made a seemingly cryptic comment on how the 
U.S. Embassy sets the tone for other diplomatic missions in 
Yemen and that its sticking closely to proper channels 
encourages others to do so. He added, \"Oh we know you will 
have your own sources and that\'s fine, but please check your 
stories with official channels for the sake of accuracy in 
your understanding and reporting of Yemeni developments to 
Washington.\" 
 
3. (C) DCM later called FM Qirbi to provide answers on a 
couple of queries the Minister had made earlier in the week 
and used the opportunity to ask the FM for a clarification of 
what the President meant in his remarks about official 
channels. Qirbi said that the President meant to remind us to 
coordinate carefully on any travel outside Sanaa. When 
pressed by the DCM on the political aspect of the remark, 
Qirbi confirmed that the President was referring to remarks 
and opinions we might hear from others and wanted to make 
sure those were properly balanced with the ROYG\'s official 
point of view. 
 
--------------------- 
The Bloomfield Visit: 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C) Ambassador raised with Saleh the upcoming A/S 
Bloomfield visit and how important it was for the President 
to see Bloomfield to get our bilateral discussions on MANPADS 
off to a good start. Saleh replied that the 24th of August 
was not possible as he was leaving to the U.K. for an 
official visit. A meeting in London was also not desirable as 
Saleh\'s schedule is already tight. Saleh recommended instead 
a meeting anytime after August 30th. Post will convey this 
message in separate reporting to ARP and the A/S in order to 
coordinate and fix a date for the visit.

Classified By: DCM Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.5 (b), (d). 
 
1. (S) Summary.  The conflict continues between ROYG forces 
and armed-supporters of rebel Shi\'ite cleric al-Houthi.  The 
fighting remains concentrated in the northern Marran 
mountains, although some fighting has been reported in urban 
centers in the Sa\'da governate.  Although the crisis has yet 
to spin out of control, senior ROYG officials continue to 
express concern that pockets of al-Houthi supporters are 
operating in other areas of the country.  End Summary. 
 
Where is the Fighting? 
---------------------- 
 
2. (S/NF) ROYG forces continue to battle armed supporters of 
rebel Shi\'ite cleric al-Houthi in the mountainous Marran area 
around Sa\'da.  Fighting remains concentrated on two main 
peaks, but Yemeni press reports indicate for the first time 
that fighting has extended to the suburbs of Sa\'da, causing 
non-combatant casualties and material damage.  (Note: DATT 
and CT Advisor have been aware for some time of isolated 
fighting in urban Sa\'da.  Additionally the Yemen Air Forces\' 
use of MIGs to bomb al-Houthi encampments in Marran is 
causing considerable collateral damage, without achieving 
substantial military gains.  End Note.)  Contrary to ROYG 
public statements, we believe there are roughly 20,000 Yemeni 
Regular Army and Central Security Forces in the region 
engaged with around 4000 insurgents. 
 
Saleh Fears Expansion of the Conflict 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (S/NF)  Saleh continues to press for U.S. assistance to 
quell the insurgency.  Expressing anxiety that the conflict 
may expand, senior ROYG officials have requested U.S. 
intelligence support to locate \"isolated pockets\" of 
al-Houthi supporters in \"other areas\" of the country.  (Note: 
 The USG has already provided military assistance to the 
Yemenis by training the Ministry of Interior\'s Special 
Central Security Forces and Army Special Forces, as well as 
providing Falconview Mapping technology.  We have not seen 
evidence of the technology being put to use, but the Minister 
of Interior told Ambassador and DCM in a August 18 meeting 
that the Special CSF forces were being deployed north that 
evening.  End Note). 
 
4. (C)  In an effort to circle the wagons, Saleh gathered 
Sa\'da tribal sheikhs, dignitaries, and local officials in the 
capital on August 16, urging them to \"play their role to 
eradicate this evil seed and to control extremism\" in their 
region.  The Sa\'da elite had a mixed-response, ranging from 
affirmation that the al-Houthi trend was dangerous to the 
state and to Islam, to complaints that the Sa\'da leadership 
was not consulted until the situation got out of control. 
 
Could \"al-Houthism\" Spread? 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Comment:  It is unlikely that al-Houthi\'s Shia 
teachings, modeled on the Iranian Twelver Imam school of 
thought, will take root in majority Sunni Yemen or gain a 
true following beyond the loyal students who make up his 
vanguard.  Underlying political support for al-Houthi among 
Yemenis, where it exists, may be attributed to an 
undercurrent of anti-regime sentiment, and perhaps a certain 
joy in seeing Saleh\'s nose bloodied.  The heavy casualties 
sustained by the ROYG forces so far can be politically 
absorbed if the state prevails in the near future.  A 
prolonged conflict and/or a a runaway al-Houthi may make 
Saleh\'s regime vulnerablity to other potential rebels around 
the country.

REF: SANAA 1738 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Krajeski for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (S) Summary.  Citing potential backlash from the tribes, 
price gouging by the merchants, and opposition from the 
street, National Security Bureau Deputy Ammar Saleh asked 
that any U.S. provided technical and financial assistance to 
buy-back illicit Yemeni MANPADS be kept secret. Ammar also 
shared information on ROYG procedures for collecting illicit 
weapons, discussed current ROYG official stocks, and proposed 
a joint plan to store MANPADS after collection and before 
destruction.  Ammar stressed that ROYG would not accept an 
inspection of its own official MANPAD stock.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
The Case of the Missing MANPADS 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (S)  President Saleh\'s point-man on illicit MANPADS, 
Ammar Saleh, met with DATT and Pol/Econ Chief on August 18. 
Saleh discussed the on-going question of the missing 1000 
plus MANPADS (Note:  In July 2003 EmbOffs viewed 1100 MANPADS 
recovered from the illegal market, compared to just 79 in a 
July 2004 inspection. End Note).  He explained that the 
Ministry of Defense (MOD) distributed these systems to its 
own forces, adding \"they bought them, they own them, they can 
do what they like with them.\"  As for the 79 still in the 
warehouse, Ammar said these would not be deployed to the army 
but sold and destroyed as part of the tabled 
buy-back.(Comment: We are not surprised by this largesse as 
most of the 79 systems are obsolete. See Reftel. End Comment). 
 
------------------ 
The Official Stock 
------------------ 
 
3.  (S/NF)  As for a serialized current account of official 
MANPADS stock, Ammar told us this information was \"top 
secret\" adding, \"Why would you want to know?\"  DATT suggested 
 
SIPDIS 
that our interest stemmed from the leakage of official Yemeni 
MANPADS into the hands of al-Qa\'ida terrorists in Kenya, 
Saudi Arabia and Yemen.  Saleh agreed that this must be 
prevented in the future, claiming that these systems were 
smuggled out of Yemen during the chaos of the 1994 civil war. 
 As for a good estimate of the number of illicit MANPADS in 
Yemen,\"Impossible!\" says Ammar, \"We just don\'t know.\" 
 
--------------------------------- 
Please Keep Your Assistance Secret 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (S)  Saleh requested that the role of the U.S. in 
financing the proposed buy-back be kept secret.  The arms 
merchants, he said, will increase their prices if they know 
that U.S. money is behind the program.  As for the tribal 
Sheikhs -- they may be willing to sell their MANPADS to the 
ROYG, but not necessarily to the USG.  The opposition Islah 
party, he added, would use U.S. participation to rally public 
opinion against the President. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
The \"Big Fish\"  How the ROYG conducts Buy-Backs 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.  (S)  Ammar produced a list of 29 names which he described 
as the \"big fish\" Yemeni arms merchants.  These individuals 
collect illicit weapons of all types and then sell them to 
the Ministry of Defense.  In addition to MANPADS, the 
merchants collect all types of SA/LW and explosives.  As for 
the price list, \"Ammar showed us an old one in Arabic\" 
adding, \"but in truth it depends on which dealers have the 
best relationship with MOD officials.\" 
 
-------------------------- 
To Avoid a Bait and Switch 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (S) Ammar said he did not want MANPADS collected under the 
new U.S.-funded buy-back to be stored in MOD warehouses, 
where official and non-official stock may get \"mixed-up.\" 
Instead, he proposed that the NSB would buy land near Sanaa, 
if the U.S. would be willing to build a storage facility 
there -- the purpose being to properly store MANPADS until 
they can be destroyed. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (S)  The meeting with the NSB served as an initial 
discussion of our expectations and a first go at coordinating 
the A/S visit.  A scenesetter will follow to suggest an 
itinerary for the visit.  We should consider Ammar\'s 
no-inventory assertion as an opening not a final position, 
although we can expect our proposal to be met with great 
suspicion. We will also have to push back firmly on his 
suggestion to rely on arms merchants in the buy-back process. 
The idea is to wean the ROYG from old habits, not reinforce 
them.  End Comment.

1. Summary.  In Yemen, children augment family and household 
incomes as street vendors and workers in family businesses or 
on the family farm.  Slavery, child prostitution and 
trafficking are not major issues in Yemen.  Some donors 
express concern that child trafficking may be on the rise. 
Government officials and NGOs are working together to provide 
basic education, counseling, vocational training,  and to 
eliminate the employment of children in hazardous jobs and 
arrive at a joint strategy to eliminate child labor 
altogether.  Last year, Parliament and the Ministry of Human 
Rights gave increasing focus and recognition to the issue of 
child trafficking.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
2004 YEMEN CHILD LABOR UPDATE 
----------------------------- 
 
2. Begin update: 
 
A)   DOES YEMEN HAVE ADEQUATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
PROSCRIBING THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR? 
 
Update: Pending donor funding, the ROYG will review all of 
its laws regarding child labor to ensure coordination between 
the different ministries.  The law will clarify the 
ministries\' roles and insure that they comply with 
international conventions.  Last year\'s update noted that the 
ROYG would be completing this effort but international 
funding for such a project was not secured (ref d).  The 
Ministry of Labor (MOL) conducted a baseline survey of child 
labor in Yemen, collecting information from trade unions, 
chambers of commerce and MOL branch offices.  MOL estimates 
that there are close to half a million working children, ages 
6 to 14, and that working children comprise 10 to 15 percent 
of the total work force. 
 
B) DOES YEMEN HAVE ADEQUATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR THE 
IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF PROSCRIPTIONS AGAINST THE 
WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR?  ARE THERE ANY RECENT 
GOVERNMENTAL OR JUDICIAL INITIATIVES TO STRENGTHEN CHILD 
LABOR LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS? 
 
Update: Adequate enforcement of regulations remains weak in 
many government ministries, not only in the MOL.  Due to 
serious resource constraints, the MOL employs less than 
twenty child labor inspectors to investigate crimes 
throughout the entire country and was not able to hire 
additional inspectors as reported last year (ref d). 
 
C) HAS YEMEN ESTABLISHED FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS TO 
INVESTIGATE AND ADDRESS COMPLAINTS RELATING TO THE WORST 
FORMS OF CHILD LABOR? 
 
No update required. 
 
D) WHETHER SOCIAL PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO PREVENT 
THE ENGAGEMENT OF CHILDREN IN THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR, 
AND TO ASSIST IN REMOVING CHILDREN ENGAGED IN THE WORST FORMS 
OF CHILD LABOR? 
 
Update: Under the auspices of the Mayor of Sanaa and 
supported in part by funds from the U.S. Department of Labor 
to the ILO, ILO/IPEC opened a rehabilitation center for 
victims of child labor in 2002.  In the past year, IPEC began 
offering remedial education, vocational training, and some 
counseling in addition to the ongoing effort to re-integrate 
child laborers into mainstream schools. 
 
E) WHETHER THE COUNTRY HAS A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY AIMED AT 
THE ELIMINATION OF THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR? 
 
No update required. 
 
F) WHETHER THE COUNTRY IS MAKING CONTINUAL PROGRESS TOWARD 
ELIMINATING THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR? 
 
Update: The issue of child labor enjoys the focus and concern 
of the ROYG and several of its ministries, such as the MOL 
and the Ministry of Education.  Nonetheless, the ROYG needs 
increased coordination between child labor officials in its 
ministries and with NGOs and international organizations. 
Progress is slow and child labor remains a significant 
problem for Yemeni society. 
 
----------------------------- 
ADDENDUM ON CHILD TRAFFICKING 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  While the incidence of child trafficking appears limited, 
the ROYG and NGOs report that child smuggling in Yemen needs 
to be more closely examined (ref c).  In recent months, the 
press occasionally reported incidents of child trafficking to 
Saudi Arabia.  The English language weekly, \"Yemen Times,\" 
reported that 40 Yemeni children a month are detained by 
Saudi police for street begging and repatriated.  Jeddah 
reported on this phenomenon in ref b. 
 
4.  The ROYG acknowledges a possible problem and has taken 
action against child smuggling.  The ROYG and UNICEF are 
currently working on a project to examine the nature and 
extent of possible internal and external child smuggling.  In 
the past year, two child traffickers were prosecuted.  One 
received a three-year prison sentence, a concrete example pf 
the ROYG\'s efforts to combat child trafficking. 
Nonetheless, the ROYG\'s capabilities suffer from serious 
limitations, including extreme poverty, porous borders with 
Saudi Arabia and along its 1,400 km coastline, lack of 
training for police and security officials in identifying and 
preventing cases of trafficking, and a cultural acceptance of 
working children.  To assist in the outreach against child 
trafficking, Post is currently seeking USG funding to launch 
a trafficking awareness campaign with the cooperation of the 
ROYG.

Classified By: Ambassador Thomas Krajeski for reasons 1.4 (b and d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Ongoing trials for 15 al-Qa\'ida associates 
(Trial One) and the USS Cole (Trial Two) defendants are 
expected to end in the last week of August.  While Trial One 
has been chaotic and presided over by an ineffective judge, 
the USS Cole trial exemplifies effective U.S.-Yemen 
cooperation.  U.S. presence and cooperation in the trial has 
been conducted according to traditional Yemeni roles for 
victims\' families in the courts.  Post expects both Judges to 
issue their decisions by mid to late September.  The appeals 
process could take six to twelve months.  Post will work with 
PA and FBI to create appropriate press guidance and carefully 
monitor the security situation closer to the announcement of 
the sentences.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
Trial One: A Judge Overwhelmed 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) On the first day of the trial of 15 terror suspects 
accused in the Limburg bombing and planning of attacks on 
U.S. and other Western diplomats, Judge Ahmed al-Jarmouzi was 
forced to appoint lawyers for the defendants, quell the 
spirited responses of families and manage a courtroom 
unsuited for a high-profile trial (ref A).  While some 
improvements were made in courtroom organization and 
security, the trial remains disorganized.  At times, the 
defendants shouted in unison, \"No God but God and Usama Bin 
Laden is God\'s beloved,\" \"America is the enemy of God,\" and 
\"We want bin Ladin as our only leader, no one else will 
satisfy us.\"  Al-Jarmouzi repeatedly ordered the defendants 
to stop their shouting and leave the courtroom, but often 
relented and kept the defendants in the courtroom.  At one 
point during Trial One, prosecutors Saeed Aql and Ali Samet 
(who are also prosecuting the USS COLE trial) walked out of 
the proceedings because al-Jarmouzi did not silence the 
chants.  Al-Jarmouzi also failed to effectively manage 
defense attorneys who have left the proceedings three times 
to protest the refusal of the judge to provide them with 
photocopies of evidentiary files.  According to Yemeni law, 
defense attorneys may have access to, but not copies of 
evidence.  The Minister of Human Rights recently made 
statements in support of the defense attorneys right to have 
access to the files. 
 
3. (U) The defendants are all believed to be al-Qa\'ida 
associates and are charged with involvement in: 
-- the 9/02 explosion in an al-Qa\'ida safehouse in the 
al-Qadissiya neighborhood of Sanaa where 13 crates of 
explosives were found; 
-- the 10/02 M/V Limburg bombing; 
-- the 11/02 Hunt Oil Company helicopter attack; 
-- the al-Qa\'ida cell rolled up in fall 2003 with plans to 
target the U.S., British, French and Cuban Embassies. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
USS COLE Trial: Expanded Use of Evidence 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In contrast to the chaotic atmosphere of Trial One, 
Judge Nagib al Qadari quickly established order in the USS 
COLE trial.  Qadari is the same judge who sentenced Aden Abya 
Islamic Army Chief, Abdul Hasan al-Mihdar, to death for the 
1998 hostage taking that resulted in the deaths of three 
western tourists.  In July, Qadari fined the defense 
attorneys 2,000 Riyals (21 USD) for repeatedly asking for 
photocopies of the evidentiary files and claiming that they 
could not proceed with the case without the information in 
question.  In what the Legatt\'s office characterized as a 
fair decision, Judge Qadari ruled the he would provide 
photocopies of the material on a case-by-case basis. 
However, defense attorney al-Anisi still insists on receiving 
complete copies of files and said he would appeal the case 
based on the judge\'s ruling.  Qadari dismissed al-Anisi from 
the courtroom.  To date, al-Anisi has not returned to the 
trial. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
The Defense: Conspiracy, Emotion and Little Proof 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5. (C) Defense attorneys al-Anisi, al-Samawi and al-Alawi are 
the primary defense attorneys for both trials.  Basing his 
cases on emotion,  al-Anisi often directs arguments towards 
the journalists rather than refuting state\'s evidence. 
(Note: President Saleh appointed al-Anisi as Sheikh Mohammed 
al-Moayed\'s defense attorney.  In November 03, al-Moayed was 
extradited from Germany to the United States and presently is 
awaiting trial on charges of supporting al-Qa\'ida.  Al-Anisi 
received his visa on 8/18 and is making preparations for 
travel to the U.S.  End note).  Al-Samawi, who spent 33 years 
in Parliament, uses conspiracy theories involving other 
alleged perpetrators in an attempt to prove the innocence of 
his clients. 
 
6. (C) In Trial One the three defense attorneys have offered 
no rebuttal and instead focused on their claims for full 
access to evidence.  Their USS COLE defense can best be 
summarized as follows: 
-- How could Yemenis blow up a huge, powerful American ship? 
-- The explosives used in the operation (RDX/TNT) are only 
made in Israel and America, therefore Yemenis could not be 
responsible. 
-- Taliban/al-Qa\'ida forbid the use of video cameras on 
religious grounds, therefore Yemenis trained in Afghanistan 
by al-Qa\'ida could not have video taped an operation. (This 
defense argument received laughter in the courtroom). 
-- The ROYG is prosecuting these suspects because they are 
unable to produce the real culprit. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
The Prosecution: A Barrage of Evidence 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Lead prosecutor Aqel and his deputy Samet are 
prosecuting methodically built cases based on evidence from 
investigations, lab reports and confession statements.  Samet 
gained experience in terrorist cases prosecuting al-Mihdar 
under Judge Qadari.  While both cases are gaining positive 
reviews in the official press, al-Aqel and Samet have 
received threats and are under 24/7 surveillance.  Near the 
end of June, a grenade was thrown at Aqel\'s house burning his 
car.  Steady, but at times uneven, cooperation between Legatt 
and ROYG greatly contributed to what one local newspaper 
called the prosecution\'s \"barrage of evidence\" implicating 
the USS COLE suspects. 
 
--------------------- 
Justice, Yemeni Style 
--------------------- 
 
8. (C) Prior to these two trials, terrorism cases were 
investigated by the Political Security Organization (PSO), 
who either handed defendants over to Supreme Court Judge 
al-Hitar for dialogue (ref A), or were turned over to the 
Prosecutor General for trial.  If the case went to trial, the 
prosecution initiated a new investigation.  Since the 
prosecution rarely had access to PSO files and could not 
conduct new investigations, government efforts usually relied 
on confessions for conviction.  In the ongoing terrorism 
trials, FBI representatives helped the prosecution develop 
stronger indictments and provided support in understanding 
ways to link evidence producing tighter cases.  Legatt 
believes the USS COLE trial is the first time DNA evidence 
will be used in a Yemen court of law.  At times, FBI 
cooperation helped ROYG investigators identify connections 
and develop new leads as Yemeni investigators had little 
experience building evidentiary based cases. 
 
9. (C) American presence at the trials is based on the 
traditional role of the victim\'s families in the Yemeni 
Judicial system.  Justice Department representatives have 
acted as family spokespersons and made clear that any 
assistance provided to the ROYG falls under their role as 
advocates for the family.  Legatt advises that future 
cooperation in Yemeni terrorism trials be characterized in 
this manner. 
 
10. (C) Attorney General al-Olafy asked Legatt, as 
representatives for the families, to stand in court and 
recommend a sentence for the USS COLE trial.  In order to 
avoid the public exposure of Americans speaking at trial, the 
judge and prosecutor agreed that the Legatt\'s office could 
reply via letter.  The letter expressed the following: 
 
-- The Legatt office is present at the trials to represent 
the families of the victims. 
-- The USG expects the defendants to be tried under Yemeni 
law. 
-- If the defendants are found guilty, the USG asks that they 
be punished to the full extent of Yemeni laws. 
 
------------------ 
What Happens Next? 
------------------ 
 
11. (C) Both trials are expected to conclude by the last week 
in August.  Most observers believe that the judges will issue 
their decisions by the end of September.  Defense attorney 
al-Anisi has repeatedly claimed that based on Qadari\'s 
decision concerning evidence in the USS COLE trial, he will 
appeal.  Appeals are also likely in Trial One.  The appeals 
could take six-twelve months. 
12. (C) Comment: Post expects all defendants to be found 
guilty.  Sentences may vary from capital punishment in one or 
two cases, to a range of prison terms for the rest.  Post 
anticipates increased anti-American sentiment around the time 
the verdicts and sentences are announced.  In preparation, 
post is developing press guidance and will closely monitor 
any increased threats.  End comment.

1.  (C) Summary and Comment:  Ambassador delivered invitation 
to FM Qirbi to attend the September 23-24 G-8 Forum for the 
Future preparatory meeting on the margins of the UNGA.  Qirbi 
accepted the invitation, stressing that it is important for 
the Forum to produce results and not just words on paper. 
Post expects Yemen\'s active participation to continue because 
the G-8 provides the ROYG a visible venue in which to tout 
its position as a leader in Arab democratic development.

2.  (SBU) Ambassador delivered invitation and talking points 
to Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi on August 22 (reftel). 
The FM said that he looked forward to the September 24 
ministerial in New York and would designate an official to 
serve as the ROYG\'s representative to the Forum for the 
Future.  Qirbi stressed that the Forum needs to produce 
tangible results.  Ambassador replied that as current G-8 
chair, the U.S. takes its commitment to reform in the Middle 
East very seriously. 
 
3.  (C) Qirbi told Ambassador that he plans to attend an 
initial meeting in Ankara on September 8 to begin work on the

determined to be enemy combatants, but emphasized that press 
interest in the tribunal process is intense.  Qirbi nodded, 
saying, \"I think it will eventually become public -- it 
cannot be avoided.\"  The FM asked that we continue to give 
advance notification of CSRT determinations involving 
Yemenis, explaining that having the information before it 
becomes public allows the ROYG to manage popular reaction and 
to provide consular/legal support to their citizens held in 
Guantanamo.

ROYG SUPPORT FOR IIG 
 
REF: STATE 174644 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski; reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
      1.  (C)  Summary.  On August 22 Ambassador raised the 
upcoming visit of PM A/S Bloomfield with Foreign Minister 
al-Qirbi.  Discussion centered on A/S Bloomfield\'s visit, the 
need to control MANPADS and SA/LW in Yemen, and ROYG support 
for the Interim Iraqi Government (reftel).  Guantanamo 
demarche and G-8 Forum for the Future invitation reported in 
septel.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
A/S Bloomfield Visit/MANPADS 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Ambassador informed FM that PM A/S Bloomfield will 
arrive on 8/30 to hold consultations on MANPADS buy-back. 
Qirbi responded that he welcomes the visit and that \"we are 
all committed to embark on a policy to remove all types of 
arms from the hands of ordinary people.\"  However, he 
continued, to succeed, Yemen must overcome tribal tradition 
and popular opposition -- \"like your National Rifle 
Association.\"  Qirbi suggested that the best way to change 
Yemeni tradition and public opinion is through education and 
public awareness to the danger of individuals holding arms. 
\"Ultimately,\" he said, \"we must succeed for our own security.\" 
 
3.  (S)  Ambassador replied that the U.S. has a history with 
this issue -- the right to bear arms -- and that we deal with 
it by regulating the export, import, manufacturing and 
ownership of weapons.  Ambassador emphasized that the USG 
understands the comprehensive nature of the SA/LW 
proliferation problem in Yemen, but the purpose of A/S 
Bloomfield\'s visit is MANPADS, which we consider to be 
extremely dangerous.  \"We must make sure they do not get into 
terrorist hands as has happened in the past,\" said 
Ambassador.\" 
 
------------------------------ 
ROYG Political Support for IIG 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C)  In the context of the Saudi Proposal for Muslim 
Forces in Iraq, Ambassador raised the need for ROYG support 
for the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG), saying that we 
welcome all contributions of our regional partners.  Qirbi, 
who expressed skepticism about a pan-Arab security force in 
the Ambassador\'s introductory meeting on August 12, 
responded, \"We don\'t support this and I don\'t think you want 
them either!\"  Ambassador said that the IIG is relying on the 
UN and international organizations to organize elections, on 
the U.S. and the Coalition for security.  The IIG needs the 
political support of its Arab neighbors.  \"Arab support,\" he 
continued, \"will help ensure a smooth and complete transition 
to a government elected by the Iraqi people.\" 
 
------------------------ 
VISIT OF IRAQI FM ZUBARI 
------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  Qirbi said the ROYG is supporting the IIG as 
evidenced by the upcoming visit of IIG Foreign Minister 
Zubari on the 7 or 8 of September.  \"Everyone,\" he added, 
\"has a role in helping the Iraqis get out of this quagmire.\" 
The FM said he was encouraged by the Iraqi National 
Conference which went \"better than expected\" and that he 
hoped the Iraqis were \"recovering their sense of direction\" 
and that there would be less violence in the near future.

SIPDIS 
 
FOR PM A/S BLOOMFIELD 
 
E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/21/2014 
TAGS: PARM, MASS, PREL, ASEC, PTER, YM, OVID, COUNTER TERRORISM 
SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR VISIT OF A/S BLOOMFIELD TO YEMEN 
 
REF: STATE 180556 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski; reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Embassy Sana\'a warmly welcomes the visit of PM 
Assistant Secretary Bloomfield to Yemen.  You will find 
President Saleh and senior ROYG officials ready to discuss 
the proposed USG buy-back and destruction assistance for 
illicit Yemeni MANPADS.  The ROYG wants this program, and 
they want to keep it running.  Be prepared for the ROYG to 
seek extending the buy-back to cover other weapons systems. 
Although your primary goal is ROYG buy-in and cooperation in 
this limited buy-back, the timing is right to push for 
greater SA/LW inventory controls and a rational ROYG 
acquisition policy.  Should you arrive with C-130 licensing 
agreements in your pocket it will buy good-will by removing a 
long-standing irritant in U.S. - Yemeni military cooperation. 
 
2. (C) You can expect at least initial ROYG resistance to 
sharing a serialized inventory of their official MANPADS 
stock, as well as to any appearance of outside interference 
in their acquisitions policy.  The ROYG has asked that we 
keep the U.S. role in providing technical and financial 
assistance for MANPADS recovery and destruction secret -- 
citing potential backlash from the tribes, price gouging by 
the merchants, and opposition from the street.  Although the 
fact of your visit will be public, we should not publicize 
its main purpose. 
 
--------------- 
President Saleh 
--------------- 
 
3. (C) In the last two years, President Ali Abdullah Saleh 
transformed Yemen\'s domestic security picture with  major 
counter-terrorism achievements:  the 11/02 apprehension of 
al-Qa\'ida HVT Abu-Assem al-Mekki, aggressive CT operations 
against the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army, and the 9/03 round-up of 
an emerging al-Qa\'ida cell with plans to target the U.S. 
Ambassador and other American and Western interests. 
 
4. (C) Saleh\'s modus operendi vis-a-vis CT cooperation is to 
leverage these successes into further U.S. military and 
security cooperation, intelligence support, development 
assistance and food aid.  Saleh has determined that his 
interests lie in his pro -U.S stance in the GWOT.  The 
MANPADS buy-back is part of our continuing CT partnership, as 
well as an opportunity to build on the relationships 
established by his visit to Sea Island and participation in 
the G-8 Summit. 
 
5. (S) Saleh is now embroiled in an armed-struggle against 
the supporters of rebel Shi\'ite cleric al-Houthi in the 
northern Sa\'da region.  His difficulty in quelling the 
conflict, and his reported fury at discovering the insurgents 
are better armed with more advanced weapons than ROYG forces, 
may lead to a realization that the traditional arms-loving 
Yemeni culture, if unchecked, can seriously threaten regime 
interests.  However, while such thinking aids our push for 
greater controls over the flow of illicit SA/LW in and out of 
Yemen, it also feeds the ROYG hunger for acquiring new more 
advanced weapons for its own arsenal.  (Note:  Saleh has 
requested Embassy assistance both for vehicular and airborne 
countermeasures to defeat SAMs.  End Note.) 
 
----------------- 
Notional Schedule 
----------------- 
 
6. (C)  We have not scheduled meetings outside the Embassy 
for August 30.  On August 31 you will meet with President 
Saleh, Deputy Director of the National Security Bureau Ammar 
Saleh (in charge of illicit weapons recovery in Yemen), 
Minister of Defense Abdullah Ali Alaiwa, and Minister of 
Interior Rashad al-Alimi.  The Presidential Palace will 
likely inform us on the timing of your meeting with Saleh 
shortly before it occurs, and your subsequent meetings will 
follow.  A working lunch with key players is expected to take 
place at one of the Ministries.  The Ambassador would like to 
host a small dinner at his residence on August 31 or 
September 1 with Ministers of Defense, Interior, Foreign 
Affairs, NSB Deputy Ammar Saleh, and Dr. Iryani.  We are 
waiting for ROYG response to the invitation.   We have 
requested to tour MANPADS storage sites on September 1, and 
it may be possible for you to visit a weapons souk outside of 
Sana\'a, pending resolution of security and logistical issues. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Ammar Saleh and the National Security Bureau 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) In response to the Secretary\'s letter, President Saleh 
tapped his nephew, Deputy Director of the National Security 
Bureau (NSB) Ammar Saleh, as the ROYG lead for MANPADS 
buy-back (Note: Ammar Saleh\'s lead was confirmed to Charge by 
Foreign Minister al-Qirbi and Defense Minister Alaiwa.  End 
Note.)  Ammar Saleh is expected to take the reins as NSB 
Director soon.  He will have his work cut out for him 
wrestling NSB\'s new portfolio from the other security 
organizations, chiefly the Political Security Organization 
(PSO). 
 
8.  (S/NF) Ammar is charged with the illicit weapons recovery 
account, and is already engaged in his own buy-back of all 
sorts of materiel.  On August 23 he told us he recently met 
with an arms dealer who claimed there are Strela 1, 2 and 3\'s 
as well as Stingers for sale on the Yemeni black market. 
Ammar gave him the funds to purchase them.  All MANPADS 
recovered would become part of our buy-back.  (Note:  He was 
not convinced on the Stingers, but promised to inform us 
immediately if he recovers any.  End Note.)  Ammar reported 
that he is also buying back C-4 and explosives detonators 
from the market. 
 
9. (S/NF) Ammar is a frank and direct interlocutor.  In 
private he speaks about his difficulties in dealing with the 
Ministry of Defense, which he often describes as an 
impediment.  The ROYG envisions the NSB operating as a joint 
NSC-CIA type organization modeled on the Jordanian GID.  Our 
main CT interlocutor, PSO Chief Gamish, will be the unseen 
elephant in the room during your discussions with NSB.  You 
can capitalize on this tension -- Ammar needs to succeed in 
this, his first major assignment. 
 
------------------------------- 
The Case of the Missing MANPADS 
------------------------------- 
 
10.  (S) The ROYG is ready to sell and destroy the 79 systems 
it currently claims are its only illicit MANPADS stock.  Your 
challenge will be getting the ROYG to provide a serialized 
inventory of their official MANPADS stock. 
 
11.  (S) ROYG cooperation rises and falls along a predictable 
\"what have you done for me lately\" pattern.  After an initial 
July 2003 inspection, the ROYG rebuffed Embassy requests to 
inventory ROYG recovered MANPADS stocks.  Following delivery 
of Secretary Powell\'s letter, offering assistance to buy-back 
and destroy MANPADS, we were allowed to view current stocks 
in July 2004.  In the latest inspection, Emboffs viewed 79 
SA-7\'s which appeared inoperable, vice 1,100 in the same 
storage facility in 2003.  (Note: You will be touring this 
facility during your visit.  End Note.) 
 
12.  (S/NF)  NSB Ammar Saleh told us on August 18 that the 
Ministry of Defense re-distributed all usable systems to its 
own forces.  \"They bought them, they own them, they can do 
what they like with them,\" said Ammar.  As for the remaining 
79, they will be destroyed as part of the tabled buy-back. 
He assured us that all U.S. buy-back funds will be handled by 
his organization and promised complete control of the systems 
from collection to destruction. 
 
13. (S/NF) Ammar has developed his own proposal for storage 
and control of recovered MANPADS under the U.S. proposal.  He 
has twice raised his idea for a joint USG-NSB effort.  \"You 
build the warehouse, I\'ll buy the land.\"  He wants to use 
non-Ministry of Defense facilities to prevent acquired 
illicit MANPADS from becoming \"mixed up\" with MOD stocks. 
 
--------------------------- 
Official Inventory Controls 
--------------------------- 
 
14.  (S/NF)  You can expect Minister of Defense Alaiwa to 
balk at our request for a serialized account of official 
MANPADS stocks.  Ammar described this information as \"Top 
Secret\" and exclaimed \"Why would you want to know?\"  Your 
 
SIPDIS 
answer is simple:  MANPADS leaked from Yemen\'s official stock 
were used in al-Qa\'ida operations in Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and 
Yemen.  The ROYG position is that these weapons were smuggled 
out during the chaos of the 1994  civil war, but that current 
controls are much better.  However, in reality they share our 
concern and are highly motivated to prevent any recurrence 
given the damage it could do to the U.S. - Yemeni CT 
partnership and therefore their growing USG development 
assistance account.  Ammar Saleh has suggested that our 
demand for a serialized inventory account would be better 
received if couched in an offer of technical assistance to 
modernize and computerize inventories of the Yemeni Armed 
Forces arsenal. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Continued Acquisition and Destruction of Illicit MANPADS 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
15.  (S/NF)  Presently, the ROYG uses a list of 29 approved 
arms dealers to collect illicit weapons from the grey market. 
 MANPADS buy-back will create an additional demand in the 
local arms market.  This is to our advantage if we can 
destroy additional non-Yemeni systems floating in from HOA. 
What we want to avoid, however, is a secondary arms market 
for cheap North Korean MANPADS that cost less to produce than 
what we are offering to pay for recovered systems.  Given 
that the ROYG has violated its bilateral agreement not to 
deal with North Korea, we should impress upon them our 
concerns regarding control of future buy-back acquisitions. 
 
---------------- 
New Acquisitions 
---------------- 
 
16.  (S/NF) President Saleh will claim the sovereign right to 
determine Yemen\'s defense needs.  You will want to press 
Saleh and Alaiwa that the purpose of this buy-back is not to 
fund illegitimate acquisitions of more advanced MANPADS 
systems for ROYG forces. (See other channel reporting.) 
 
17. (C)  The ROYG described initiatives to Senior Advisor 
Bodine and NSC Deputy Townsend in 2003 to negate all current 
end-user licenses and increase MFA involvement in the 
acquisitions process by issuing new certificates through 
overseas embassies -- there has been no action on this 
commitment. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Proliferation of SA/LW beyond MANPADS 
------------------------------------- 
 
18.  (C)  Ammar is hoping this buy-back will lead to other 
SA/LW buy-backs -- which will expand his portfolio.  He and 
the ROYG are motivated for success in the hope that 
additional buy-backs for SA/LW will follow.  This visit is an 
opportunity to study the greater issue of weapons 
proliferation in Yemen. 
 
19.  (C) Yemen has a gun loving culture and has long been a 
regional center for weapons smuggling.  A dhow interdicted by 
the U.S. Navy in early May with a shipment of 500 AK-47s 
bound for Somalia underscores the continuing problem.  Saleh 
must balance political support from the northern tribes with 
the fact that so many of them are heavily involved in weapons 
smuggling operations. 
 
--------------------------- 
Grey Arms:  Border Control 
--------------------------- 
 
20. (C) Yemen and Saudi Arabia have announced joint efforts 
to tighten border security, but improvement and application 
to date is limited and uneven.  The security of Yemen\'s land 
and maritime borders remains a priority concern.  The USG has 
installed the Pisces system here and just initiated the EXBS 
program for further assistance.  The Yemeni Coast Guard is up 
and running.  Still, tackling the issue remains well beyond 
Yemen\'s current border control capacity, particularly along 
the long and largely unregulated boarder with Saudi Arabia. 
 
-------------------- 
The Al-Houthi Factor 
-------------------- 
 
21. (S/NF) The difficulty of the Yemeni Army and Central 
Security Forces to end the bloody conflict with the armed 
supporters of rebel Shi\'ite cleric al-Houthi in the northern 
region of Sa\'da is causing some ROYG officials to rethink its 
traditional hands-off policy on SW/LA flow in and out of 
Yemen.  It appears al-Houthi supporters are better armed with 
newer weapons than ROYG forces.  This thinking presents us 
with a double-edged sword.  We can capitalize on it by 
pressing for strong cooperation on illicit MANPADS recovery. 
At the same time, it is likely to feed ongoing ROYG efforts 
to acquire new, technologically advanced weapons.

1. (C) Assistant Prosecutor Ali al-Samet confirmed to Emboff 
that the verdict and sentencing for 15 defendants in the 
Limburg Trial (trial one) will be announced on Saturday 
August 28.  The defendants are all believed to be al-Qa\'ida 
associates and are charged with involvement in: 
 
-- the 9/02 explosion in an al-Qa\'ida safehouse in the 
al-Qadissiya neighborhood of Sanaa where 13 crates of 
explosives were found; 
-- the 10/02 M/V Limburg bombing; 
-- the 11/02 Hunt Oil Company helicopter attack; 
-- the al-Qa\'ida cell rolled up in fall 2003 with plans to 
target the U.S., British, French and Cuban Embassies. 
 
An article in the English Language Yemen Times reports that 
the defendants expressed \"surprise\" at the fact that the 
annoucement would come next week. 
 
2. (C) Comment: In reftel, post reported that Judge 
al-Jarmouzi was expected to study the case for a month and 
announce his decision in September.  Government pressure to 
preempt security problems and negative press likely 
contributed to moving up the sentencing date.  Post will 
monitor security situation and hold EACs as warranted.  End

Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski; reasons 1.4 (b), (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Despite repeated government claims that the fighting 
in Sa\'da is in its final stages, the last week has been 
increasingly bloody for both sides.  The ROYG has stopped 
discussing casualty rates publicly, but local media reports 
that 15 soldiers were killed on August 24 including Lt. Col. 
al-Hitar, brother of Supreme Court Judge al-Hitar who heads 
the Government Dialogue Committee. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Al Jazeera reported August 25 that dozens of 
government forces were killed in clashes with al-Houthi two 
days earlier.  Reuters reported 11 dead.  In fact, 135 were 
killed when a group of soldiers dressed in civilian clothing 
attempted to infiltrate a suspected al-Houthi hideout and 
fell victim to a Yemeni Air Force strike.  (Note: 
Coordination between the Army, Air Force and Central Security 
Forces has been poor throughout this conflict.  Post has 
suspected prior incidents of friendly fire.  However, this is 
the first case we can confirm.  End Note.) 
 
3.  (S) Al Jazeera also reported that the bodies of 120 
al-Houthi supporters were found in a hideout after it fell 
under government control.  120 dead rebels in one operation 
is quite plausible given Post\'s estimate that 1,500 al-Houthi 
supporters and approximately 2,500 government forces have 
died since the fighting began over seventy days ago -- 
official numbers remain at one-tenth of this.

1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened a 
core EAC meeting on August 28, 2004, to share security 
concerns with regard to potential tensions in Yemen. 
Attention to Emergency Action Plan (EAP) awareness and 
updating were also addressed.  Embassy employees were 
reminded to remain vigilant in light of recent threat 
reporting and to report all security related incidents 
immediately to the RSO. EAC members noted no current 
specific threats against Embassy Sanaa. The American 
community continues to remain in a high state of security 
alertness even in the absence of specific threat against 
Americans or the Embassy. Key offices and personnel 
represented included:  DCM, FPD, OMC, ORCA, POL/ECON ,HU, MO, 
CCE-Yemen, DAO, and RSO. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  (C)  EAC members began their discussion with a 
review of the security situation in light of recent 
events in Yemen.  The Ambassador emphasized communication 
between EAC members and stressed the need for each 
section to complete the update of the EAP and to 
review emergency procedures. 
 
3. (S/NF) DCM referred to the recent issuance of a 
general public warning for the Middle East.  DCM 
noted that the large turnover of personnel at 
Embassy Sanaa has increased the need to update the 
Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and to review the 
updated version for accuracy.  DCM also stated that 
an EAC core group of six to seven people should meet 
on a monthly basis regardless of any direct threat 
reporting.  The information shared by this core 
group will be disseminated to the members of each 
section and discussed openly at country team meetings. 
 
4.  (C)  The Ambassador expressed his desire to have a 
warden meeting in September. CONS also stressed the need 
to share information with the American community to 
include NGOs and AMCITS in Aden. 
 
5. (S/NF)  DCM pointed to several events that have 
the potential to affect the American community 
including the upcoming trial of an alleged Yemeni 
Al-Qaida member in Guantanamo Bay, and the sentencing 
today of Yemenis convicted in the attack on the 
French supertanker Limburg and for plotting to attack 
the U.S. Embassy and other foreign missions in Yemen. 
DCM also noted the increased reporting concerning threats 
against maritime interests which were also of great 
concern. 
 
6.  (C)  In view of increased security concerns, the 
Ambassador asked EAC members to assess the level of 
cooperation and communication each section has with 
their respective contacts in the ROYG in order to how they 
would gauge the Yemeni governments level of assistance in 
the event of a crisis such as hostage taking or an 
evacuation. 
 
7.  (S/NF)  RMO stated hospitals have been identified 
in the event of an emergency but medical care would be 
substandard.  RMO added that the medical portion of 
the EAP has been updated and a first responder exercise 
has recently been conducted with the Regional Security 
Office. 
 
-- RSO reported excellent working relationship with 
Yemeni officials in relation to law enforcement and 
security matters. 
 
--AID reported good contacts with officials in the 
regional provinces.  AID added that they will be 
increasing their staff in Yemen which will raise 
their profile. 
 
--DAO and ORCA conveyed the reluctance of 
Yemeni officials to share information. ORCA added 
however that their information sharing with the 
Yemenis is above average compared with that of 
other embassies. 
--FBI stated their contacts with the Ministry 
of Interior were mixed but noted their 
communication with the newly created National 
Security Bureau (NSB) have so far been positive. 
 
-- OMC and CCE-Y section heads have recently 
arrived in Yemen and will be pursuing closer 
cooperation with their Yemeni counterparts. 
 
--MO noted he was part of the Embassy Sanaa 
evacuation in 1994 and the assistance from 
governmental officials was excellent.

PRESIDENT MANSOUR 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski; reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (U)  Summary:  Ambassador paid a courtesy call on Yemeni 
Vice President Abd-Rabo Mansour Hadi on August 28. 
Discussions centered on U.S. - Yemeni cooperation in the 
GWOT.  Hadi emphasized that long-term success in the war 
against terror in Yemen would also require improved social 
services, economic reform, and democratization.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  VP Hadi highlighted the importance of U.S. - Yemen 
cooperation in the GWOT, saying that Yemen had suffered a 
great deal politically and economically from terrorist acts 
committed on its soil (namely the USS Cole and M.V. Limburg 
bombings).  He stressed that, in addition to CT support, 
winning the long-term battle against terrorism in Yemen would 
require U.S help in reducing poverty, achieving economic and 
democratic reform, and attracting foreign investment. 
Ambassador responded that the U.S. - Yemen partnership in the 
GWOT continues to log important successes, and agreed that 
long-term change in Yemen, as well as the region, required 
improved economic conditions and increased political 
participation. 
 
3.  (U)  Mansour outlined the ROYG\'s six development 
priorities since 1996: education, health, roads, water, 
electricity, and telecommunications.  Progress, he continued, 
has been slow due to disagreements between the ruling GSP 
party and the opposition Islah.  Ambassador assured the Vice 
President of the USG\'s commitment to U.S. - Yemeni 
cooperation, \"economically, militarily, and politically.\" 
 
4.  (C)  Comment:  A reputed champion of reform, Mansour\'s 
position as Vice President is largely ceremonial and does not 
lend him much influence with ROYG decision makers.  Although 
from the southern Abyan region, Mansour led the campaign 
against YSP secessionists and served as Minister of Defense 
during the civil war.  His post-unification appointment in 
1994 is considered a reward for his services to the North.

1. (C) Summary and comment: Deputy Attorney General Sharaf 
al-Mahbashi and Chief Prosecutor Saeed al-Aqel told DCM on 
8/29 that the prosecution has already filed for an appeal 
over the 8/28 Trial One (reftel) sentences for the now 
convicted al-Qa\'ida associates.  The prosecutors will seek 
harsher penalties for all the defendants, including death 
sentences for the perpetrators of the M.V. Limburg bombing. 
Aqel expects the USS COLE trial to conclude after two or 
three more sessions, (i.e. two to three more weeks). 
Expressing surprise at the light sentences for some of the 
defendants, the DCM complimented the Attorney General\'s 
office for their excellent work and their cooperation with 
Embassy FBI staff.  DCM stressed that the USG shared ROYG 
interest in a transparent trial in which convicted felons 
receive punishments to the full extent of Yemeni law. End

2. (U) On 8/28 Judge Ahmed al-Jarmouzi issued sentences in 
the group terrorism trial, but did not issue a written 
verdict.  Al-Jazeera reported the following, which Post 
assesses to be the most accurate accounting of the sentences: 
 
 
Ten Years in prison for the 2002 attack on the French tanker 
M.V. Limburg: 
-- Omer Sa\'id Jarallah 
-- Fawzi al-Hababi 
-- Mohammed al-Ammari 
-- Fawzi al-Wajih

Ten Years in prison for plotting to attack the Civil Aviation 
and Meteorology Authority (i.e. Hunt Helicopter attack): 
-- Fawaz al Rabi\'ea 
-- Abu Bakr al-Rabi\'ea 
 
Five years in prison for plotting to attack foreign embassies 
in Sanaa and for planning to kill the U.S. Ambassador to 
Yemen: 
-- Ibrahim al-Howeid 
-- Aref Saleh Mujalli 
-- Mohammed Ali al-Daylami 
-- Qassem al-Rayni 
-- Abdul-Ghani Dhayfan 
 
Three years in prison for forging documents:

One sentenced to death for killing a Ministry of Interior 
policeman while fleeing the attack on the Hunt helicopter: 
-- Hizam Mujallad

ROYG to Appeal Light Sentences 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) On 8/29 DCM and Pol/Econ officer called on Assistant 
Attorney General Sharaf al-Mahbashi and Lead Prosecutor Saeed 
al-Aqel to gauge ROYG reaction to the 8/28 sentencing 
announcement.  Cautioning the DCM not to believe press 
reports until the court issues the final written verdict, 
Aqel said that his office was surprised at the light 
sentences and has already filed an appeal seeking more 
stringent punishments.  For those convicted in the M.V. 
Limburg bombing, Aqel is aiming for the death penalty and 
will request 10-year prison terms for those accused of 
plotting against Western embassies and trying to kill the 
U.S. Ambassador, the maximum punishment under Yemeni law. 
 
4. (C) Aqel expects the appeal process to be short, but said 
that he will work to enhance his case for the appeal 
hearings.  Commenting that the sentences were not logical, 
Aqel said that Mujallid received the death penalty and his 
partner, Fawaz al-Rabi\'ea, received ten years for the same 
crime.  Aqel added that the ROYG believes all fifteen 
defendants\' crimes are linked and criticized the judge\'s 
decision to issue separate sentences for connected terrorist 
activities.  Mahbashi affirmed that the whole process has 
been free of political pressure and that his office will make 
every effort to see that the defendants are punished to the 
utmost extent of Yemeni law. 
 
------------------------ 
USS COLE Trial Continues 
------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Turning to the ongoing USS COLE trial, Aqel said he 
expects two to three more hearings before the defense will 
rest its case.  DCM raised allegations made by defense 
attorneys on 8/25 that a former Minister issued USS COLE 
defendant al-Harazi a pass allowing free movement through 
checkpoints.  Questioning the pass\' veracity, Aqel said that 
the defense only submitted a poor copy of the document and 
speculated that the document may be forged.  Mahbashi 
interjected that the defense has constantly tried to confuse 
the issue through surprises and political diatribes. 
Explaining that Yemeni law does not recognize copies of 
documents, Aqel said the defense has failed to produce an 
original document so the issue has been ruled inadmissible. 
Aqel said he believes the defense, whatever the verdict, will 
also appeal the decision.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAGR, EAID, ASEC, YM, ECON/COM 
SUBJECT: YEMEN REQUEST - FY05 USDA FOOD ASSISTANCE, PL480 
TITLE I 
 
REF: SECSTATE 172525 
 
1. Summary: USDA food assistance in Yemen is enhancing 
infrastructure, funding agricultural research projects, and 
teaching horticultural marketing and livestock management 
skills.  Since 2000, USDA assistance constituted the bulk of 
USG development aid to Yemen.  In conjunction with USAID 
technical assistance, USDA food assistance programs help 
achieve greater security and stability within Yemen and 
improve bilateral relations.  Yemen is a key U.S. partner in 
the global fight against terrorism.  Post, therefore, 
requests $20.5 million in USDA support for FY 2005. 
 
------------------------ 
PL-480 REQUEST FOR YEMEN 
------------------------ 
 
2. Post\'s request for the FY05 PL-480 Title I Grant Program 
is $20.5 million.  Wheat, wheat flour, and soybean oil will 
be easily absorbed into the local market.  If these 
commodities are not available, corn and soybean meal are 
excellent alternative choices for the PL-480 grant program in 
Yemen.  Tier 1 commodities are preferred over tier 2 
commodities due to larger market demand. 
 
Based on current Yemeni market prices, Post requests the 
following commodities: 
 
Tier 1             Amount     Est. Value 
 
Wheat              60,000 MT  $9.0 million 
Wheat Flour        30,000 MT  $7.5 million 
Refined Soybean Oil 5,000 MT  $4.0 million 
 
TOTAL              95,000 MT  $20.5 million 
 
 
Tier 2             Amount     Est. Value 
 
Corn               20,000 MT  $3.4 million 
Soybean Meal        7,000 MT  $1.9 million 
 
3. MARKET DISPLACEMENT: Yemen is a poor country in which only 
the lowest priced commodities will sell.  Yemen imports 1.7 
million MT wheat and 400,000 MT flour.  The majority of wheat 
is imported from India and Australia.  Post,s request of 
90,000 MT would only account for five percent of Yemen,s 
total imports of wheat and flour and will not interfere with 
commercial sales.  Yemen traditionally imports soft white 
wheat, which is used for both milling and direct sale to 
consumers.  Domestic milling capacity is steadily increasing, 
which is reducing the demand for imported flour.  Therefore, 
Post requests a greater ratio of wheat-to-wheat flour. 
 
4. Since the introduction of U.S. flour through the 416(b) 
program, consumers have been exposed to the quality of U.S. 
wheat.  Because the price of U.S. wheat is significantly 
higher than subsidized European flour, Yemeni importers do 
not purchase U.S. flour on the market.  PL-480 would expose 
more Yemeni consumers to higher quality U.S. wheat and in the 
future could expand the market for U.S. agricultural 
products. 
 
5. Yemen remains a net importer of refined vegetable oil, 
bulk palm oil, corn and soybean meal.  Yemen imports refined, 
packaged oil for direct consumer sales.  For food products, 
bulk palm oil and refined vegetable oil are used for 
manufacturing and packaging.  Oil importers who manufacture 
and distribute brand-name oil products may combine refined 
vegetable oils with palm oil to make the finished products. 
Annual imports of corn and soybean meal are approximately 
300,000 MT for corn and 80,000 MT for soybean; these are 
primarily used for chicken feed production.  The Yemeni 
market would absorb PL-480 donations of corn and soybean 
meal. 
 
6. LOCAL PRODUCTION: With its rocky, mountainous terrain, 
Yemen\'s food production is limited to isolated mountain 
terraces.  Only three percent of Yemen,s land is cultivated, 
with water scarcity severely limiting its expansion.  As a 
result, Yemen will remain import-dependent for the majority 
of its grain and crop demands.  Yemen produces less than 
150,000 MT of wheat annually and this is unlikely to increase 
substantially over the long term.  Yemen imports nearly all 
of its wheat, wheat flour, corn, rice, and soybean oil and 
meal requirements.  With a birthrate of 6.7 children per 
woman and an annual population growth rate of nearly 3.5 
percent.  Demand for agricultural products will continue to 
increase. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
THE YEMEN PL-480 PROGRAM: SPRINGING OFF PAST SUCCESS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7. USG development strategy in Yemen focuses on agriculture, 
health and education in the most rural and underserved 
regions of Yemen.  Post will continue to support ongoing core 
development objectives; past and ongoing PL-480 assistance is 
complementary and integral to the mission\'s overall 
development strategy.  Recognizing the practical results 
achieved from past PL-480 projects, stakeholders such as 
farmers, rural communities, and the Government of Yemen 
continue to request expanded development services. 
8. PAST FOOD ASSISTANCE SUCCESSES: Based on continuing USG 
development objectives outlined in paragraph 10, USDA food 
aid programs are currently funding extremely successful rural 
development projects on which future PL-480 grants will 
expand.  The following are a few examples: 
 
-- The FY 2002 416(b) program financed a pilot irrigation 
project in Marib governorate that significantly cut the cost 
of pumping water, reduced water wastage, and is increasing 
yields due to more efficient water usage.  In addition, the 
food assistance program financed the construction of health 
facilities in many regions of the country and the training of 
medical staff. 
 
-- A large-scale municipal drainage project underway in the 
city of Sana\'a will allow rainwater to be directed to 
surrounding farmland for irrigation purposes. 
 
-- The FY03 PL-480 program is financing a project that takes 
research and extension of productivity to the village level 
in eight districts, where multi-disciplinary teams directly 
address the problems faced by farmers and helps introduce 
expanded income opportunities. 
 
The FY 2005 Food for Progress will allow the USG to expand 
these projects to more remote and vulnerable areas. 
 
9. Through a transparent tendering process, PL-480 
commodities received under a Food for Progress program will 
be sold to the private sector.  A Joint Working Group (JWG) 
oversees the USDA food assistance program, consisting of one 
member each from the U.S. Embassy, Ministry of Planning and 
International Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture and 
Irrigation, and Ministry of Finance.  The JWG monitors the 
tendering and execution of the food assistance programs and 
approves all project proposals utilizing PL-480 proceeds. 
 
10. CONTINUING AND STRENGTHENING USG DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES: 
With FY 2005 PL-480 grants, the JWG plans to continue 
directing PL-480 proceeds to rural development projects, 
primarily in tribal areas.  Three main factors influence JWG 
project decisions. 
 
-- First, poverty afflicts the rural areas to a greater depth 
and breadth than the urban areas; most of the Yemen labor 
force lives and works on small, subsistence family farms. 
PL-480 activities must have a measurable, positive effect on 
poverty alleviation and employment generation. 
 
-- Second, water resources continue to diminish and remain 
constrained; water conservation and rain-fed agriculture 
should be given utmost consideration in project frameworks. 
 
-- Third, projects should generate increased economic 
opportunity through agricultural productivity along with 
viable opportunities for women. 
 
In keeping with these objectives, the 2005 PL-480 program 
will fund successful projects designed to expand sustainable 
production of agricultural products, expand markets for 
agricultural products, improve the framework for economic 
growth, and improve health and living conditions in rural 
areas: 
 
a. Sustainable Agricultural and Livestock Sectors: Improve

access to health care and clean water and improve sanitation. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
YEMEN,S QUALIFICATION FOR PL-480 PROGRAM 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11. SYSTEMIC POVERTY AND UNDERDEVELOPMENT: Yemen is one of 
the least-developed countries (LDCs) in the world and is the 
poorest country in the Middle East.  According to 2004 UN 
estimates, the per capita income in Yemen is $508 a year. 
Yemen ranks 152 out of 174 nations on the UN,s World 
Development Index.  Approximately 40 percent of the 
population lives below the poverty line.  The median age in 
Yemen is 15 years and the rapid population growth is coupled 
with low rate of enrollment in basic education, just 61.3 
percent for boys and 41.1 percent for girls.  The low level 
of basic education leads to high illiteracy rates with 
varying estimates of 65 percent literacy for men and 35 
percent literacy for women. 
 
12. ROYG EFFORTS TO STEM POVERTY AND INCREASE FOOD SECURITY: 
The ROYG is currently implementing its second Five)Year 
Economic and Social Development Plan (from 2001 to 2005) and 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PSRP). Both focus on 
reducing poverty and seek to address national concerns such 
as water scarcity, the absence of infrastructure to support 
agriculture and industrial development (including a reliable 
transport system), rational utilization of the country,s 
fish resources, as well as to increase enrollment in basic 
education (especially for girls) and access to healthcare and 
other social services.  The projects supported by the Food 
for Progress program will complement the objectives of the 
PRSP and the Economic and Social Development Plan. 
 
13. PREPARATIONS FOR WTO ACESSION: Yemen applied for 
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in July 2000. 
 In 1995, Yemen began executing an IMF structural reform 
program and has taken measures to stabilize its economy.  Due 
to this guidance, basic commodities subsidies have been 
removed.  The IMF and World Bank have welcomed this and other 
reform measures implemented to date.  To prepare for WTO 
accession, Yemen will examine reducing import restrictions 
and opening its agriculture sector to the global market. 
 
14. FINANCIAL HEALTH AND STABILITY: Over 90 percent of 
Yemen,s export revenues derive from oil exports.  Record 
high world oil prices over the past year have restored 
Yemen,s depleted foreign currency reserves.  While current 
reserves hover around $5 billion, they could be in danger of 
dramatically collapsing should oil prices fall.  In addition, 
Yemen brought its indebtedness to a sustainable level due in 
part to &exit treatment\" at the Paris Club meetings in June 
2001 and a July 2002 Yemen-U.S. agreement to reduce and 
reschedule $73 million in debts.  The current debt burden 
represents 48 percent of its GDP.  Therefore, Yemen meets the 
basic criteria established for the Food for Progress program. 
 
15. LIMITED PARTICIPATION FROM PRIVATE VOLUNTEER 
ORGANIZATIONS (PVOs) AND INTERNATIONAL DONORS: Many PVOs and 
international donors are slowly returning their assistance to 
Yemen.  Much of the low level of participation can be 
attributed to security concerns starting from the 1990 Gulf 
War, the Cole attack, and other events.  Nonetheless even 
European and Japanese aid levels are not high.  In fact, 
Yemen receives a comparatively low level of foreign 
assistance per capita than other LDCs.  The difficulty of 
operating in Yemen,s rugged, mountainous and rural 
environment where security is not easily maintained, 
contributes to reduced donor support.  Without a 
comprehensive PVO/NGO infrastructure, Post continues to 
support a government-to-government program.  Sales of these 
PL-480 commodities can converted to liquid funds for 
JWG-selected projects.  The JWG, which includes Embassy 
representation, identifies projects for support, administers 
transparent tendering processes in which local contractors 
compete, and reviews the progress and outcome of all PL-480 
projects. 
 
16. AN EMERGING DEMOCRACY: Yemen is one of a handful of 
Middle Eastern countries that have adopted a serious and 
sustained program of democratic form.  Following unification 
in 1990, the first Parliament elected by universal suffrage 
convened in 1993.  In 1999, Yemen held its first Presidential 
election, and in February 2001, the first election of local 
councils began the move towards decentralization. The 2003 
Parliamentary elections were technically sound and judged 
&generally free and fair8 by international observers.  In 
addition, the ROYG is cooperating with the USG on sensitive 
counter-terrorism efforts.  Continued assistance through 
PL-480 serves U.S. interests in buttressing democratic reform 
and complementing counter-terrorism efforts by enhancing 
income-generating activities in the rural, tribal areas of 
Yemen where extremists may take refuge. 
 
17. ...AND A COUNTER-TERRORISM PARTNER: The ROYG has 
supported Middle East peace efforts, distanced itself from 
Iraq, and been an active ally of the Operation Enduring 
Freedom coalition against Al Qa,ida.  Most importantly, 
Yemen has cooperated on the investigation into the terrorist 
bombing of the USS Cole in Aden in October 2000, and expanded 
its counter-terrorism efforts following President Bush,s 
November 2001 meeting with President Saleh.  A sign of 
Yemen,s commitment to democratic progress, President Saleh 
attended the June 2004 Sea Island G-8 Conference.  As a 
result, Yemen will co-sponsor with Turkey and Italy the 
Democracy Assistance Dialogue.  Development assistance, 
especially in tribal areas, is important to extend government 
control and deny safe havens for Al Qa,ida.  Ongoing U.S. 
Food for Progress assistance will reinforce U.S. goals of 
democratic reform and counter-terrorism cooperation. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
18. USDA food aid continues to exemplify the USG,s overall 
commitment to support Yemen as an emerging democracy and a 
key partner in the war against terrorism.  U.S. assistance 
has expanded USG leverage in both the political and economic 
development spheres.   Post recommends that Yemen be 
considered a very strong candidate for the Food for Progress 
program at a level consistent with PL-480 programs of recent 
years.  This aid is a vital step toward meeting 
well-documented humanitarian needs and will strengthen 
Yemen,s own ability to resist and combat extremist ideology 
in the country and the region.  End comment.

SUBJECT: FIRST KIDNAPPING IN THREE YEARS RESOLVED QUICKLY 
 
REF: SANAA 2225 
 
Classified By: DCM Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Five oil workers were kidnapped on 8/31 in 
Ma\'rib governorate for three hours.  The Ma\'rib Governor sent 
in troops who, after brief gunfire, freed the three hostages. 
 All men are safely back in Sanaa.  While Post has no/no 
indication that the kidnapping was terrorist related, it may 
signal increased tribal restiveness as ROYG security forces 
are preoccupied with fighting in the north. Post will monitor 
closely to see if a pattern is emerging in terms of a return 
to tribal tensions and lawlessness. End summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Five Oil Workers Kidnapped for \"Lunch\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Occidental Petroleum Yemen Manager Richard Schmitt 
confirmed to Pol/Econ Deputy on 9/1 that one Australian, two 
Omanis, and two Yemenis were detained for three hours on 8/31 
while driving back to Sanaa from the field.  Schmitt said 
that 10 kilometers outside of Ma\'rib city a pick-up truck 
full of armed tribesmen overtook the oil workers\' SUV and 
forced the five men to an \"undisclosed location.\"  After 
lunch the five were moved again.  Schmitt stated that the men 
were employees of a subcontractor of Occidental, the Omani 
drilling company MB. Schmitt reported that the tribesmen 
called the MB company and demanded jobs for six of their 
tribesmen.  According to Schmitt, MB used to employ members 
of the Jedan tribe, which is believed to be responsible for 
the kidnapping. 
 
3. (C) Once informed of the ransom, Schmitt said 
representatives from MB called the Governor of Ma\'rib as well 
as his chief of security, to request a quick resolution. 
According to Schmitt, the Governor\'s men moved in and 
resolved the situation peacefully.  A Yemen Hunt security 
official told Pol/Econ deputy that upon the military\'s 
arrival there was a brief exchange of gunfire. 
Characterizing the incident as an \"aggressive kidnapping,\" 
Schmitt asserted that the event is not \"benign.\"  Schmitt 
will press the ROYG for \"immediate, aggressive action\" 
against the perpetrators.  Yemen Hunt said that they are 
monitoring the situation carefully, but have not yet moved to 
change their security posture. 
 
------------------------- 
ROYG Downplaying Incident 
------------------------- 
 
4. (C) German CDA told Pol/Econ Deputy on 8/31 that the 
National Security Bureau (NSB) is attempting to spin the 
story as a simple robbery, and commented that in his opinion 
it is \"definitely a kidnapping.\"  The Governor of Ma\'rib 
denied to al-Sawha net that the kidnapping took place.  A 
prominent Ma\'rib Sheikh Rabish told Saba news agency that the 
Australian engineer was simply hosted by the \"Jed\'an tribe in 
Ma\'rib for lunch.\" 
 
------------------------- 
Spike in Tribal Violence? 
------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The kidnapping comes on the heels of three tribal 
incidents involving expats in the past six weeks.  All 
incidents occurred in the al-Jawf governorate and none of the 
incidents resulted in injuries. 
 
-- On 7/27 American contractors of the Adventist Relief and 
Development Agency were fired upon while driving in the 
region. 
 
-- On 8/4 Embassy officers were waived off from visiting a 
northern village with gunfire; 
 
-- On 8/31 two Yemeni contractors refused to stop to pick up 
a tribesman who shot up the car the men were riding in. 
 
In addition to the ongoing conflict in Sa\'da (reftel), Post 
is aware of another stand-off between the ROYG and tribes in 
the al-Jawf governorate.  Press reports indicate that the 
government is holding one tribal leader and the tribes are 
holding a government soldier hostage.  Al-Jawf tribal sheikhs 
told an Amcit NGO worker that the government is afraid to 
release the tribesman for fear he will join al-Houthi in his 
conflict against the government in the North. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  The successful resolution of the kidnapping 
demonstrates the ROYG\'s resolve to maintain its record of no 
westerners kidnapped since 2001.  Tribal kidnapping to gain 
jobs, schools or other economic incentives is a tradition 
rooted in Yemeni society.  Post does not/not believe this was 
related to terrorism.  However, the fact that this incident 
occurred while the ROYG is embroiled in an ongoing struggle 
in Sa\'da, when combined with the other incidents against 
expats described above, indicates renewed tribal muscle 
flexing in the provinces.  Yemen is actively seeking to 
transform its former \"wild west\" image into that of a stable, 
emerging democracy safe for foreign investment.  If the 
tribes return to their previous custom of holding foreigners 
for ransom (of whatever sort) it will negatively impact on 
foreign investment so desperately needed in Yemen.  Post will 
monitor such incidents and closely report as appropriate. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT SALEH TO A/S BLOOMFIELD \"NO NEW MANPADS\" 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski; reasons 1.4 (b), (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary.  Assistant Secretary of State for Political 
Military Affairs Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr. discussed proposed 
U.S. MANPADS buyback and destruction initiative with Yemeni 
President Ali Abdullah Saleh on September 1.  Saleh not only 
agreed to move forward with the modalities of the buyback, 
but pledged to A/S that the ROYG would not seek to buy any 
new systems.  Despite Saleh\'s attempt to extract more money 
out of the buyback offer, Post expects/hopes to conclude an 
agreement in the next two weeks.  A/S Bloomfield\'s August 31 
meeting with Minister of Interior al-Alimi, Chief of Military 
Staff al Qassemi, and National Security Bureau Saleh covered 
septel.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Saleh -- \"We Have to Get Them Off the Market\" 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  A/S Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr. and Ambassador met 
with Yemeni President Saleh on September 1 to discuss the 
proposed U.S. MANPADS buyback initiative.  Saleh welcomed A/S 
Bloomfield\'s visit and the MANPADS initiative, describing it 
as part of continuing U.S. - Yemeni joint security efforts in 
the Arabian Gulf and the Middle East.  A/S Bloomfield thanked 
the President for his country\'s cooperation and partnership 
in the GWOT, emphasizing that MANPADS in particular pose a 
grave threat to U.S. and Yemeni global security interests 
should they fall into terrorist hands.  Saleh readily agreed, 
adding \"these weapons in the hands of al Qa\'ida or Jihadists 
threaten Yemen\'s security forces.  We have to get them off 
the market.\" 
 
3.  (C)  A/S Bloomfield outlined the MANPADS buyback 
initiative, explaining it was a very specific proposal to 
purchase and destroy systems collected by the ROYG.  In 
addition to compensation for each system, U.S. technical 
training and assistance would be provided to ensure the 
safety of MANPADS collection and transportation, and to 
conduct destruction.  A/S Bloomfield stressed that there was 
a 90-day window in which to buy and destroy current ROYG 
illicit stocks, and that while the program did not have a 
time limit -- the funding was, indeed, finite. 
 
4.  (S)  Saleh told A/S Bloomfield that the ROYG was 
currently in possession of 1435 MANPADS including 500 he had 
recently collected from \"private people\" just prior to his 
departure to London for an official visit on September 25. 
The President made clear that these systems would be offered 
up for sale and destruction according to the proposed 
initiative, adding that he estimated there were another 150 - 
200 still in private hands which the ROYG is targeted for 
collection.  (Note:  On August 31 A/S Bloomfield viewed 79 
recovered MANPADS stored in a MOD facility.  The 1435 appear 
to be some combination of these 79, plus the other 1029 
emboffs observed in the same facility in 2003, and a number 
of other illicit systems we were unaware had been collected. 
We will seek clarification on these numbers from NSB Deputy 
Director Ammar Saleh.  End Note.) 
 
5.  (C)  President Saleh assured A/S he was serious about 
cutting off the possibility of MANPADS leakage from official 
stocks.  He said he had given the order to collect all 
systems from the Yemeni Armed Forces in the field and return 
them to storage immediately.  A/S commended the President\'s 
actions to get \"these dangerous missiles out of dangerous 
hands,\" emphasizing that Yemeni MANPADS must remain under the 
lock and key of the authorities.  \"Actually,\" Saleh 
responded, \"we don\'t need them.\" 
 
-------------------------------- 
Saleh Promises No New MANPADS... 
-------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Saleh pledged to A/S Bloomfield that Yemen\'s 
national defense did not require MANPADS; to the contrary, 
the current crisis in Sa\'da proves \"it was a big mistake\" to 
allow such weapons to fall into the hands of our enemies 
where they can be used against our own forces.  \"I assure 
you,\" said the President, \"there will be no new deals, we 
will not trade in them.\"  Bloomfield responded, \"you have 
made a very important statement, that MANPADS are more useful 
to terrorists than to your military.\" 
 
7.  (S)  A/S told Saleh he is engaged in ongoing discussions 
with source country governments in Eastern Europe to stop 
exporting MANPADS, but that we have indications arms dealers 
claiming to represent Yemen continue to shop in these markets 
for advanced MANPADS.  Saleh advised, \"You cannot prevent 
(North) Korea, China, Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus from 
producing or selling weapons.  I do not believe you will be 
successful.\"  \"Although,\" he continued, \"maybe you can 
convince them to sell through official government contracts 
and not through brokers.\"  A/S Bloomfield agreed that 
controlling weapons production was not easy, but explained 
that arms firms in nations working with the U.S. to limit 
production of MANPADS report that Yemen remains a potential 
client.  \"No,\" replied Saleh, we do not need them.\" 
 
8.  (S)   A/S Bloomfield asked the President \"if our friends 
in Eastern Europe tell me they have a contract with Yemen, 
may I tell them \'no, you do not\'\"?.  Saleh replied. \"yes, 
tell them the contract is canceled -- stop it -- no one has a 
deal to sell such weapons to Yemen unless they talk to me.\" 
 A/S replied that Saleh\'s pledge not to acquire new MANPADS 
should not be underestimated, as it would enhance Yemen\'s 
reputation in Washington and the international community. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
...In Exchange for One Million Dollars 
-------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  \"Rest assured,\" Saleh continued, \"Yemen will not 
have such weapons anymore, but everything has a price.  You 
will have to pay...one million dollars for each strela!\" 
(Note:  After an awkward silence, Saleh laughed, indicated he 
was exaggerating, and promised the price would come down.  In 
fear some uncertainty remained, the Palace translator turned 
to A/S saying, \"I feel it is my duty to make sure you 
understand this is a joke.\"  End Note.)  \"How much are you 
willing to pay?\" pressed the President.  A/S responded that 
that the price for each MANPAD was fixed and not negotiable. 
\"Fixed, but well above what we believe to be the market 
price.\" 
 
--------------------------- 
Al-Houthi - Lessons Learned 
--------------------------- 
 
10.  (S)  Saleh told A/S that the recent events in Sa\'da, 
(where ROYG forces are embroiled in an increasingly bloody 
fight against the well-equipped supporters of rebel Shi\'ite 
cleric al-Houthi) has proven that it was a \"big mistake\" to 
allow these weapons to reach enemy hands.  Saleh reported to 
A/S that 250 soldiers had been killed and 1000-1500 injured 
in addition to 300-350 rebels.  (Note:  Post believes the 
number of ROYG casualties to be much higher.  End Note.) 
 
11. (S)  A/S Bloomfield replied that the U.S. was aware of 
the cost to Yemen of the recent fighting and that \"this hurts 
us too.\"  A/S told Saleh that the Embassy is looking to see 
how else we can help. 
 
----------------------- 
...And the Kitchen Sink 
----------------------- 
 
12.  (S)  As expected, Saleh raised extending the buyback to 
include other types of weapons.  He reported that the ROYG 
has been buying back all types from the grey market since 
9/11, including SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missiles, 
machine-guns, anti-tank missiles, mines, RPGs, and 
explosives.  \"We have already paid 9 billion rials 
(approximately 49 million USD) to keep these weapons out of 
al Qa\'ida hands,\" claimed the President we are ready to 
destroy them.  We hope you will not limit the program to 
MANPADS.\"  (Note: the ROYG claims it has collected 32 million 
USD in assorted SW/LA and is seeking to recover this expense. 
 Although we doubt the claim of 32 million, we understand 
from MOD and NSB contacts that the ROYG has yet to reimburse 
the arms dealers it contracted to collect these weapons and 
Minister of Defense Alaiwa is under considerable pressure to 
make good on the deal.  End Note.) 
 
---------------------------- 
Inventory Control Assistance 
---------------------------- 
 
14.  (S)  A/S emphasized that the program on the table is 
urgent and specific; it targets  several countries with large 
numbers of these dangerous systems.  He stressed that the 
current proposal is for MANPADS only, and he is offering to 
buy them for significantly more than market price.  \"We hope 
that this important first step will be completed as soon as 
possible,\" said A/S, adding, that he was prepared to explore 
ways the U.S. can assist the ROYG in controlling its official 
stocks such as providing inventory controls, computer 
systems, stockpile security, and training.  Saleh replied 
that he looked forward to learning the details of this 
assistance. 
 
----------------------- 
Give Us Our Spare Parts 
----------------------- 
 
15.  (C)  Saleh complained to A/S of ongoing licensing 
difficulties which had grounded F-5\'s, and Augusta 
helicopters, and rendered M-60 Tanks and M109 artillery 
inoperable.  \"We have made request after request,\" he said, 
\"Why doesn\'t the U.S. respond?\"  The President repeated a 
common theme, telling A/S Bloomfield that he pays a high 
political price in the region and internally for his CT 
cooperation with the U.S.  \"Our cooperation\" he said will be 
commensurate with yours, \"As much as you move, we will move.\" 
 
16. (S) A/S Bloomfield responded that the USG appreciates its 
cooperative relationship with Yemen in the GWOT, and pointed 
out that, \"as a demonstration of our trust, yesterday I gave 
Military Chief of Staff Qassemi a C-130 licensing agreement.\" 
 \"No, interrupted Saleh, \"that is a transport plane.  We need 
our F-5 in Sa\'da.\"  A/S assured the President that he would 
personally look at each Yemeni licensing request when he 
returned to Washington and would make sure that they received 
full consideration. (Note:  When A/S Bloomfield handed the 
C-130 license to Chief of Staff Qassemi on August 31, the 
General said sarcastically \"these few parts to a transport 
plane represent the biggest step forward in our military to 
military cooperation in years.\"  End Note.) 
 
------------------------------ 
Comment: \"What, Won\'t Haggle?\" 
------------------------------ 
 
17.  (S)  All joking aside, Saleh appears serious in trying 
to push up the price per system.  It is hard to imagine a 
shrewd operator like the President paying more than market 
price for Strela 2\'s, approximately 2000 USD.  It would be 
true to style for Saleh to try to extract as much possible 
from the USG in exchange for his security cooperation.  On 
the margins of the meeting, NSB Deputy Director, and Saleh\'s 
nephew, Ammar Saleh recommended A/S Bloomfield send the 
President a follow-up letter to our meeting listing other 
benefits to Yemen that may result from the agreement, and 
urging him not to break the deal over prices that cannot/will 
not change.  End Comment.

TAGS: KMPI, PGOV, KDEM, PHUM, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM, HUMAN RIGHTS 
SUBJECT: YEMENI WOMEN DEMAND GREATER PARTICIPATION IN PARTY 
POLITICS 
 
1.  Summary: On August 25 nineteen female members of the 
three major Yemeni political parties overcame substantive 
political differences to sign a joint-declaration calling on 
their parties to accept a quota for women candidates in the 
2006 municipal and 2009 parliamentary elections. The 
culmination of a MEPI/NDI workshop, the declaration calls for 
greater inclusion of women in their parties\' decision making 
process, improved media coverage of women\'s political 
activism, and party support for a women\'s department in the 
Supreme Commission for Elections and Referenda. The women 
expect to release the declaration at a press conference on 
Wednesday, September 8.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Challenges: Identifying the Road Ahead 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  Nineteen female members of the General People\'s Congress 
(GPC), The Yemeni Congregation for Reform (Islah), and the 
Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) participated in the August 21-25 
NDI workshop.  According to NDI Yemen Country Director Yemen 
Robin Madrid, reaching consensus on the declaration was not 
easy.  NDI conference facilitators had to overcome the fear 
of participants that the majority GPC women would dominate 
the process.  Interestingly, according to Madrid, it was the 
Islah women who were more politically astute, more 
progressive vis a vis women\'s rights, and more accustomed to 
fighting in order to defend their position. 
 
3. During the conference, the women identified some of the 
difficulties they faced in daily political life.  Primary 
among their frustrations was their exclusion from access to 
decision making gatherings, including evening party 
assemblies (which some were not allowed to participate in 
because of their families), meetings with tribal Sheikhs, and 
Qat chews. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Reforms: Putting on the Pressure 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. In addition to approving the declaration, the participants 
identified needed projects to facilitate reform.  These 
ranged from conducting a public opinion survey to determine 
the attitudes of male and female party members attitudes 
towards women\'s participation in local councils and improving 
party fundraising capacity. They also identified the 
substantive step toward implementing these reforms.  The 
women also identified three principal goals they needed to 
collectively achieve: Enhancing personal power, increasing 
women\'s strength within political parties, and developing a 
national message and strategy to promote women\'s political 
participation. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Next Steps: Keeping up the Momentum 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  To ensure follow-up on the conference and the ensuing 
declaration, NDI will appoint a resident political party 
expert to visit the various party branches in September to 
advice on implementation of the proposed reforms, assist in 
the development of enhanced intra-party communication, and 
help lobby for the implementation of the declaration. 
 
6.  Comment.  Both the declaration and workshop come at a 
time when Yemeni women have been losing political ground 
within the ROYG.  Since unification in 1990, societal norms 
and political parties\' systematic hindrance of female 
candidates have chipped away at women\'s political 
representation.  Since 1990, women have lost ten out of 11 
seats in Parliament.  However, at the same time that their 
numbers in Parliament have declined, Yemeni women have 
increased their participation in voting and party activities. 
 Capitalizing on the growing political awareness of women in 
Yemen, this MEPI program is helping women develop the 
necessary tools for women to regain and exceed their previous 
levels of representation in elected bodies.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: PM BA JAMMAL (VAINLY) AFFIRMS HIS ROLE TO 
AMBASSADOR 
 
REF: SANAA 1537 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski; reasons 1.4 (b and d.) 
 
1. (C) Summary: In a 9/6 introductory call on Prime Minister 
Ba Jammal, Ambassador was treated to a wide-ranging and 
somewhat rambling review of Yemen\'s development obstacles and 
affirmed the ROYG\'s support for G8 reform initiatives.  Ba 
Jammal is widely rumored to be on his way out, but held court 
with the Ambassador and blatantly tried to show hewas still 
in control.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
PM Endorses BMENA; Seeks Help with Boarder Security 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (C) Ba Jammal expressed support for the Broader Middle 
East and North Africa Initiative (BMENA) and explained that 
he will gather Foreign Minister Qirbi, Deputy Prime Minister 
and Minister of Finance Salami and Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Sofan 9/7 
to discuss Yemen\'s participation at upcoming G8 BMENA 
meetings.  Characterizing himself as pragmatic, Ba Jammal 
expressed a willingness to work with the U.S. and held forth 
with Ambassador and accompanying Emboffs on Yemen\'s history. 
Blaming Yemen\'s development challenges on late oil discovery 
-- some fifty years after the KSA, Ba Jammal also stated that 
Yemen\'s 150 year separation compounded Yemen\'s difficulties. 
Ba Jammal highlighted Yemen\'s long coast-line and newly 
demarcated borders as areas where security assistance is 
needed. 
 
3. (C) Attributing Yemen\'s stable financial situation to his 
own policies, Ba Jammal underscored Yemen\'s poverty, noting 
an annual 4 billion USD budget for a population of 20 
million, compared to oil-wealthy Gulf countries who have 
significantly smaller populations to support. (Comment: 
Deputy Prime Minister Salami is the architect of Yemen\'s 
monetary policy.  Ba Jammal reportedly interferes with and 
tries to derail Salami\'s fiscal initiatives. End Comment). 
Ba Jammal further identified himself as Yemen\'s lead drafter 
for the third poverty reduction strategy.  (Note: Ministry of 
Planning is believed to have lead on this project).  In 
closing, Ba Jammal, affirming that he was a Dewey pragmatist, 
reiterated his commitment to work with the U.S. in practical 
ways and expressed hope for closer cooperation between the 
two nations. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Bio Note: Prison, Former Oil Minister and Heart Surgery 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
4. (C) Bio note:  Explaining he recently returned from his 
annual check up, Ba Jammal openly discussed a single heart 
bypass surgery he underwent last summer in England.  Ba 
Jammal added that he suffered nerve damage from transporting 
heavy cement blocks while serving in prison with a hard labor 
sentence in the South during 1986-1990. As a result, he has 
lost 20-30 percent of feeling in his hands, is undergoing 
physiotherapy and may have to undergo surgery. 
 
---------------------- 
Ba Jammal\'s Last Gasp? 
---------------------- 
 
5. (C) Comment: Prime Minster Ba Jammal presented a strong 
but friendly face to Ambassador.  His claims of credit for 
policies that are his rivals\' (i.e. fiscal stability and 
poverty reduction) indicate that Ba Jammal was anxious to 
appear in command.  Appearances aside, however, the 
Ambassador\'s first meeting with the Prime Minister could be 
the last.  Sanaa is rife with rumors that Ba Jammal will be 
sacked in the coming weeks for his involvement in the oil 
scandal (reftel).  A major cabinet reshuffling, which had 
been delayed, may be back on, perhaps to deflect attention 
from the ongoing ROYG involvement with al-Houthi.  If true, 
Ba Jammal may be the first to go, but a well-qualified former 
Southern Yemeni will have to be picked to take his place thus 
maintaining the Cabinet\'s careful balance between North and 
South.  End comment.

Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski for reasons 1.4 (b and d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Planning and International Cooperation warmly welcomed 
Ambassador to Yemen on 9/6. After reviewing recent progress 
in development cooperation and touching on the negative 
economic effects of the al-Houthi problem, Sofan and 
Ambassador discussed pending development issues: MCA 
Threshold status, TIFA, and the Broader Middle East and North 
Africa (BMENA) Initiative.  Smoothing over potential snags in 
the bilateral relationship, Sofan demonstrated his 
willingness to be an open and effective interlocutor. End 
Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
U.S.-Yemeni Cooperation Building 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Sofan welcomed Ambassador 
to Yemen, saying, \"I want to assure you of our full 
commitment to improve the relationship with the U.S.\" 
Ambassador pledged to DPM that he will always be available 
for consultations.  Ambassador said while security issues are 
important, he will also focus on development and commerce 
issues. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Al-Houthi Causing More than Just Military Problems 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3. (c) Sofan complained that Yemen\'s image abroad does not 
accurately reflect reality, adding that the situation 
concerning al-Houthi is \"misunderstood from the outside,\" and 
contributes to the impression that Yemen is a haven for 
terrorism.  In addition to the human losses from al-Houthi, 
Sofan said tourism is down this year and the ROYG is facing 
financial constraints from the loss of tourism dollars and 
the increased budget expenditures for military action. 
 
------------------- 
BMENA, TIFA and MCA 
------------------- 
 
4. (C) Turning to the current U.S. - Yemen development 
agenda, Ambassador passed to Sofan Secretary Snow\'s 
invitation to the 10/1 Middle East Finance Ministers Meeting 
(reftel).  Sofan mentioned that Treasury Undersecretary 
Taylor called on 9/5 to discuss the meeting and request 
Yemen\'s feedback.  Commenting that Lebanese Finance Minister 
Siniora, Middle East Agenda Coordinator, may not fully 
understand Yemen\'s needs, particularly in the area of 
microfinance, Sofan said he will provide input on the agenda. 
 
5. (C) Recalling Yemen\'s offer to host the first Trade 
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks, Deputy Prime 
Minister described the U.S.-Yemen Trade Relationship as a 
marathon with the finish line being a Free Trade Agreement. 
Ambassador replied that Post is working on the first step, 
finalizing dates for the first round of TIFA discussions. 
Aware of round two Millennium Challenge Cooperation 
competition, Sofan said he is reviewing Yemen\'s scores and 
plans to focus on the judiciary, business development, 
election processes, and human rights.  Sofan commented that 
many of the indicators are intertwined, and change in one 
sector will likely effect scores across multiple indicators. 
 
------------------------------- 
Relations with China Expanding? 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Sofan raised the upcoming visit of Chinese Foreign 
Minister Li Zhaoxing, and said Yemen won an agreement from 
China\'s Export/Import Bank for 450 million USD in facility 
guarantees, 8-10 million of which is in supply credits. 
Sofan explained that China is watching African and Gulf 
Economies, adding that the Gulf should see 5-8 percent 
regional growth.  (Comment: Yemen\'s economic growth rate of 
around 3.5 percent falls far short of its Gulf neighbors. 
Still, the economic relationship between Yemen and China is 
growing  Not a week goes by without a new press article 
discussing new business relationships particularly in the oil 
and gas sector. End comment). 
 
------- 
Comment

7. (C) Comment: Sofan took care to skirt sensitive issues, 
(i.e. TIFA and MCA Threshold status) and did not repeat his 
usual refrain on the paucity of USG Development assistance. 
Sofan and his Ministry are fundamental components of our 
development relationship with Yemen.  His support is also 
needed to advance USG objectives in Yemen such as continued 
economic and democratic reform.  End comment.

1.  (C)  Summary.  Ambassador took the opportunity of his 
introductory meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister Mustafa 
Noman to deliver refs A and B.  Noman listened carefully to 
both messages and asked questions, but offered no immediate 
response.  Discussions on G-8 BMENA process covered septel. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF) Ambassador delivered ref A to Deputy Foreign 
Minister Noman on September 7.  He stressed that out of the 
six state sponsors of terrorism, the roles of Syria and Iran 
are the most damaging to peace and stability in the region. 
Ambassador noted Syrian support for HAMAS, Hizballah, and 
other dangerous terrorist organizations.  Moving to Iran, the 
most active state sponsor of terrorism in the world, 
Ambassador said direct and indirect support for terrorist 
elements operating in Iraq is increasing.  Ambassador noted 
Yemeni suspicions regarding Iranian support for al-Houthi. 
Noman nodded but offered no immediate response. 
 
3.  (S)  Ambassador thanked the DFM for his Ministry\'s 
assistance during A/S Bloomfield\'s August 31 - September 2 
visit to Yemen.  The visit, he reported, was successful on 
many levels, and we hope to have an agreement on the MANPADS 
buyback initiative soon.  Continuing on the subject of the 
danger posed by man-portable shoulder-fired weapons, 
Ambassador shared with Noman that the USG has information 
that the ROYG is interested in purchasing thermobaric 
rocket-propelled grenade launchers and grenades from Russia 
(ref B).  These weapons, Ambassador emphasized, are easily 
transported and operated by a single individual and pack 
significant destructive power, making them an ideal terrorist 
weapon.  Ambassador urged the ROYG not to add these dangerous 
systems to its arsenal. 
 
4.  (S)  Noman sought clarification as to the nature of 
thermobaric weapons, and asked which countries are the main 
manufacturing nations.  Ambassador replied that our 
information suggests the ROYG is looking to buy them from 
Russia.  The DFM promised to pass the information to the 
Cabinet to ensure they are aware of the risk posed by these 
weapons.

2.  (C)  Ambassador discussed ROYG plans to participate in 
follow-on initiatives to the Sea Island G-8 BMENA Plan of

No\'man on September 7.  No\'man confirmed Foreign Minister 
Qirbi\'s plans to participate in the September 24 Forum for

SEPTEMBER 10 RAID 
 
REF: SANAA 2225 AND PREVIOUS. 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski; reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary.  Anti-American rebel Shi\'ite cleric 
al-Houthi was killed on September 10 in an early morning raid 
on his cave hide-out in the Sa\'da Goverornate.  The ROYG has 
announced an end to the 10-week insurgency, which resulted in 
well over 1000 deaths.  ROYG forces have already begun 
redeployment from the north, although it remains unclear 
whether or not al-Houthi supporters will regroup.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF) Rebel cleric Hussein Badr Eddine al-Houthi was 
killed early morning on September 10 near Haidan in the Sa\'da 
Goverornate.  His death came at the end of a two-day siege 
conducted by Yemeni Central Security Forces (CSF) on caves 
defended by al-Houthi supporters near Haidan.  A USG-trained 
CSF Counter Terrorism (CT) team led the operation, resulting 
in the fatal shooting of al-Houthi and the loss of one member 
of the CT unit, and two regular CSF.  After identification by 
family members, al-Houthi\'s body was transported to an 
undisclosed Army medical facility in Sanaa. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Saleh Healing Inter-Service Wounds 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh officially 
congratulated ROYG Military leaders on their victory over 
forces of rebel cleric Hussein Badr Eddine al-Houthi on 
September 10, declaring an end to the 10-week long rebellion. 
 In his statement, Saleh commended the Minister of Defense 
Alaiwa, Minister of Interior al-Alimi, Commander of the 
Northwest Region Al-Ahmar, Commander of the Air Force Mohamed 
Saleh, and Central Security Forces (CSF) Chief Yahya Saleh. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  The failure of ROYG forces to quickly and 
decisively end the rebellion when it broke out in June sent 
shockwaves through the military and security apparatus. 
During the increasingly bloody conflict, MOD sources reported 
bitter finger pointing between President Saleh\'s cousin, 
al-Ahmar, and his son and Commander of the Special Forces 
Ahmed Saleh, as well as clashes between the MOD and MOI on 
field tactics and deployment techniques. 
 
----------------------- 
Premature Redeployment? 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (S) Anxious to put this painful episode to bed, the ROYG 
leadership was quick to declare victory.  CSF were redeployed 
to Sana\'a on September 11.  It will take longer for the 7000 
Army troops to redeploy from the north, but efforts are 
already underway.  No fighting was reported since al-Houthi\'s 
death, but it may be premature to assume all pockets of 
al-Houthi supporters will fade back into their surroundings. 
(Comment:  Al-Houthi\'s religious teachings may not resonate 
widely with the Yemeni population, but his rebellion may have 
enjoyed some public support due to anti-Americanism or latent 
anti-regime sentiment.  It is premature to rule out the 
possibility remnants of al-Houthi supporters could regroup to 
exploit ROYG weaknesses, or even target western and/or 
foreign interests should the opportunity arise.  End Comment). 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
MOI Please, But Downplaying Role of USG CT Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6.  (S/NF)  Minister of Interior Alimi told DCM that 
commanders in the field attributed the victory directly to 
USG CT training.  \"Had it not been for your training the CSF 
unit that stormed the cave, we could have suffered more than 
forty casualties.\"  The evening of September 11, however, 
DATT was visited in his home by a representative of the 
Directorate of Military Intelligence who asked that any 
public credit for ending the long and bloody conflict go to 
MOD and not MOI.  (Comment:  It will be interesting to see if 
Saleh, who has publically tried to spread his praise, will 
privately acknowledge the role of U.S. assistance.  End 
Comment). 
 
7.  (S/NF) Other channel reporting confirms a minimum of 135 
CSF casualties due to just one incident of friendly fire, 
indicating severe weaknesses in ROYG forces tactical 
coordination and command, control and communication 
capabilities.  (Comment: Future FMF and security-assistance 
programs should consider addressing these shortcomings in 
ROYG forces\' abilities.  End Comment). 
----------------------------- 
ROYG vulnerabilities revealed 
----------------------------- 
 
8.  (S/NF)  Although the actual number of dead and wounded 
soldiers, rebels, and civilians is unknown, Post believes the 
number to be in the low thousands.  ROYG officials complained 
to Emboffs and senior U.S. officials throughout the conflict 
that their forces were ill prepared for this fight, asking 
repeatedly for intelligence and security assistance. 
President Saleh told visiting A/S for Political Military 
Affairs Bloomfield that ROYG forces were not properly 
equipped to defeat al-Houthi, and confided to CENTCOM 
Commander General AbiZaid that the fighting in the north had 
become unbearable in human, material, and political cost. 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
9.  (S)  While al-Houthi and his followers may not have had 
the capability to severely or permanently weaken the regime, 
the ongoing and costly nature of the conflict demonstrated 
ROYG vulnerabilities which either remaining al-Houthi 
supporters or other regime rivals, be they tribal or 
ideological, may still seek to exploit.  Requests made by 
President Saleh and other senior ROYG officials for U.S. 
security assistance and intel sharing (reftels) should not be 
dismissed due to al-Houthi\'s death.  Post recommends these 
requests be reviewed in the context of U.S. interests in 
regime stability and increased U.S.-Yemeni cooperation in the 
GWOT.  End Comment.

still has a ways to go to improve its human rights situation.

first meeting with Ambassador.  Soswa said that she has just 
begun to address human rights issues in Yemen and that she 
has \"no intention of quitting no matter how difficult the

septel), saying that recent government pressure to muzzle the 
press was \"not justified.8   Soswa revealed she had 
contacted the paper and offered to attend any subsequent 
court hearings if they so requested. 
 
4.  Ambassador commended the Minister\'s recent speech in 
which she called for equality in political participation and 
representation for all citizens.  Soswa suggested that a 
quota for women,s seats in parliament might be a solution to 
redress under-representation, but forecast that getting

5.  On the issue of detainees suspected of ties to terrorism 
being held by ROYG authorities without due process, Soswa 
accepted that &exceptional8 measures were required.  She 
reported that the cases of many of these detainees are in the 
process of being settled, but did not offer a figure for how 
many remained in custody. Ambassador assured her that the 
Guantanamo Bay process was also moving forward and that a 
second Yemeni delegation would soon be permitted to visit 
with Yemeni detainees.  Soswa urged that the USG remember it 
is considered a leading nation in respect for human rights 
and that it not minimize its role as an example for other 
nations. 
 
----------------------- 
Invitation to AS Craner 
----------------------- 
 
6.  Al-Soswa extended an invitation to Assistant Secretary of 
State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Lorne Cramer to 
visit Yemen, and also expressed an interested in possible USG 
human rights training for all levels of the security forces. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  Comment: The Ministry of Human Rights, significant 
progress in the short time since its creation is a direct 
reflection of Soswa,s fortitude.  Several Yemeni human 
rights activists praise Soswa for her ability to influence 
established institutions in Yemen.  Many local observers 
attribute her effectiveness not so much to the strength of 
the Ministry, but rather to other Ministers taking her 
criticisms personally and seeking to avoid them.  End Comment.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
------------------ 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Demonstrations 
 
A. Are there any ethnic or religious communities in country 
that are capable of carrying out significant anti-American 
demonstrations? 
 
There are not organized, clearly defined communities as 
such, but ad hoc groupings of Yemeni fundamentalists and/or 
some members of the Zaidi sect are predisposed to oppose 
U.S. policy in Palestine/Israel, Iraq and elsewhere, 
and occasionally demonstrate to express their views. 
 
B. Have there been anti-American demonstrations in the 
country within the last 12 months? 
 
On May 29th, 2004 a demonstration took place at Tahrir 
Square protesting U.S. involvement in Iraq.  Between 1500 
and 2000 individuals took part in the demonstration. 
 
There were small demonstrations at mosques in Sanaa to 
protest al-Moayad\'s extradition to the U.S. in Fall 2003. 
 
Since September 2003, there have been regular reports, in 
the press and from other sources, of arrests following 
clashes between police and worshippers at the Grand Mosque 
in Sanaa. The disturbances during sermons include 
protesters shouting \"death to America death to Israel\" 
and other anti-American and anti-Jewish slogans.  Many of 
these mosque-based demonstrations have been associated 
with a sect led by Zaidi scholar al-Horthi killed in 
September 2004 by ROYG forces during an insurection. 
 
On March 21, 2003, a march of 5-7,000 people protesting the 
war in Iraq was stopped by police approximately 1/4 mile 
from the U.S. Embassy; the demonstrators initiated 
violent confrontations that resulted in the death of 
several police and protesters. 
 
On March, 2003, Yemenis held several demonstrations 
opposing war in Iraq, most near the UN headquarters complex 
in Sanaa, Tahrir Square and Old Airport Road, all several 
miles from the Embassy. 
 
In Winter 2002 - 2003, Yemeni women held demonstrations in 
front of the German Embassy protesting the arrest of Sheikh 
al-Moayed in Frankfurt, Germany, on terrorism charges. 
 
C. Have these demonstrations taken place near or in front 
of U.S. diplomatic facilities? 
 
The usual sites for anti-American gatherings are in areas 
of Sanaa away from the Embassy; however, the 
above-mentioned March 21, 2003 event took place nearby. 
 
D. What is the average size of an anti-American demonstration? 
 
Depending on the location, up to several hundred people. 
Peaceful demonstrations protesting the war in Iraq have 
ranged from approximately 1,000 to 100,000, by some media 
accounts.  Local press routinely carry inflated estimates 
ranging from half a million to one million-plus. 
 
E. Are these anti-American demonstrations usually triggered 
by U.S. foreign policy initiatives, military actions, or by 
domestic issues? 
 
U.S. foreign policy initiatives and military/law 
enforcement and counter-terrorism endeavors, as well as 
ROYG cooperation with same. 
 
F. Are these demonstrations generally violent or peaceful? 
 
Generally peaceful.  Demonstrations must be coordinated and 
approved by ROYG in advance; consequently, the vast 
majority are peaceful.  If not approved in advance, ROYG 
forces will forcibly disband a demonstration. 
 
G. If violent, have any demonstrations resulted in damage 
to USG property or injuries to USG employees? 
 
No; however, Yemeni police and protester fatalities 
in March 2003 were due in large part to the intervention of 
host government security protecting the U.S. Embassy. 
 
H. If violent, have any demonstrations ever penetrated our 
perimeter security line? 
 
No. 
I. Have there been anti-government demonstrations in the 
country within the last 12 months? 
 
Yes, directed at specific policies, including child labor, 
education and bringing mosques under government control. 
Several anti-government demonstrations occurred in Sanaa 
and Aden. 
 
J. Have these demonstrations taken place near or in front 
of U.S. diplomatic facilities? 
 
No. 
 
K. What is the average size of an anti-government 
demonstration? 
 
Fairly small, approximately 50 to 200 individuals, similar 
to anti-U.S. protests. 
 
L. Are these demonstrations generally violent or peaceful? 
 
Generally peaceful. 
 
M. If violent, have any demonstrations resulted in damage 
to USG property? 
 
No. 
 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Macro Conflict Conditions 
 
A. Is the host country currently engaged in an interstate 
or intrastate conflict? 
 
Yes, Yemen is engaged in an internal conflict.  Host 
country is cooperating with U.S. efforts to identify 
and stop/attack terrorist targets within Yemen. 
The ROYG is concluding large-scale military 
operations against supporters of Shi\'ite (Zaidi) scholar 
al-Houthi in Sa\'da, killed in September 2004 by ROYG 
military forces.  Pockets of resistance remain around 
Sa\'da. 
 
B. If an intrastate conflict, is it an insurgency that is 
limited to a specific region or a country-wide civil war? 
 
Yes, Sa\'da Governate 
 
C. If limited to a specific region, are any U.S. diplomatic 
facilities located in this region? 
 
There are no diplomatic facilities in this region. 
 
D. Have any of the factions involved in these intrastate 
conflicts signaled or demonstrated an anti-American 
orientation? 
 
Yes, al-Houthi criticized Sunni scholars for ordering 
people to obey cruel rulers who cooperate with America. 
(Sanaa 1686) 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Host Country Capabilities 
 
A. Are law enforcement agencies professional and well-trained? 
 
U.S. assistance has enabled Yemen to develop a competent 
counter-terrorism strike force (see below), but regular 
police/law enforcement are often corrupt, poorly trained 
and underpaid.  For example, an average officer earns 60 
USD per month.  A captain with 20 years experience earns 
only 120 per month.  A Brigadier General earns 300 USD 
per month.  This economic condition -- reflecting Yemen\'s 
widespread poverty (average per capita income is less than 
USD 400 countrywide) -- fosters widespread corruption that 
possibly could be diminished with increased remuneration. 
 
Further, law enforcement agencies face numerous challenges 
regarding planning, coordination and execution of complex 
counter-terrorism operations.  Reliance on manpower is 
emphasized over the use of technology.  Agencies have 
difficulty maintaining operations security and have 
difficulty operating in a nighttime environment. 
On the other hand, Yemeni law enforcement agencies have 
shown a willingness to cooperate with U.S. and Western 
law enforcement agencies -- e.g. in the relatively 
proficient forensic investigation of the M/V Limburg attack 
in October 2002.  The United States has provided equipment 
and extensive training to the Central Security Forces 
(CSF), a para-military unit of the Ministry of Interior. 
In mid-September 2003, the ROYG disrupted an 
al-Qa\'ida-affiliated cell operating in Sanaa targeting 
Western interests.  The cell was headed by Afghanistan- 
trained Amral-Sharif.  The government provided further 
information on the ROYG\'s investigation into the cell\'s 
activities and members, particularly information on several 
arrests in Yemen and Saudi Arabia.  (Note: see answer to 
Transnational Terrorist Indicators question 6B for 
additional information). 
In cooperation with Yemeni officials, the FBI actively 
participated in the investigation of the December 30, 2002 
shootings of three American health care workers in Jibla. 
The perpetrators -- Abed Abdulrazak al-Kamel, the shooter, 
and Ali Ahmed Mohamed Jarallah, the planner -- were tried, 
convicted and sentenced to death in separate trials in 
2003.  On December 1, 2003, a three-judge panel affirmed 
the death sentence of al-Kamel, who will appeal the 
decision to the Yemen Supreme Court.  Court officials 
expect that the conviction will be upheld and passed to 
President Saleh, who is likely sign off on the order 
to carry out the sentence.  Post representatives attended 
al-Kamel\'s trial and appeal proceedings, which were 
relatively transparent and openly reported in the local 
media. 
 
Al-Kamel coordinated the attack with Ali al-Jarallah, who 
was convicted of both the Amcit murders and the 
assassination of Yemeni Socialist Party Deputy 
Secretary-General Jarallah Omar in a separate trial 
 
SIPDIS 
in Sanaa in October 2003.  Al-Jarallah is also expected 
to appeal his conviction and sentence. No specific date 
has been set for the executions. 
 
B. Have they been trained by U.S. agencies? 
 
Some officers have received DS/ATA training, however, the 
full impact of this training will be manifest only over the 
long term.  The Regional Security Office does maintain 
high-level contacts within the Ministry of Interior who 
received ATA training. 
 
In July - August 2003, 24 host government police 
investigators from across the country participated in a 
two-week DS/ATA Terrorist Crime Scene investigation course 
taught by Evidence Response Team FBI special agents. 
 
The CSF is the counter-terrorism (CT) arm of the Central 
Security Organization (CSO).  The CSF has been equipped by 
the U.S. and trained by U.K./U.S. personnel for the past 
year and will continue into the next fiscal year.  They 
are ROYG\'s intended primary CT force. 
 
In June 2003, the newly-formed CSF CT unit was dispatched 
to the Hattat mountains in Abyan province ostensibly to 
hunt down and bring to justice those responsible for an 
attack on a Red Crescent medical convoy the week before. 
However, this was a cameo appearance.  In fact, front-line 
CSO troops were actually engaged.  CSO troops were at the 
lead of this effort when Ministry of Defense forces became 
bogged down by harassing gunfire from the surrounding 
hills. Over a three day period, CSO troops engaged those 
responsible and completed their mission.  CSO was sent 
out the following week to complete mop-up operations. 
 
Beginning in early March 2004, Yemeni counter-terrorism 
operations were conducted by the CSF and Ministry of 
Defense forces in the Abyan region for approximately 
one week.  Yemeni authorities informed Post of the 
capture of al-Qaeda element Raouf Naseeb on March 3, 2004. 
The Minister of Interior and Yemen Special Operations 
Forces commander noted on March 8,2004, the capture of 
four USS Cole escapees from Aden prison. 
 
In August 2004, ATA funded attendance of 18 senior ROYG 
officials to attend the Senior Crisis Management Seminar 
in the United States.  Also, ATA sponsored a Terrorist 
Interdiction course for 24 mid-level ROYG officials in 
Sanaa. 
 
In September 2004, ATA sponsored an Airport Security 
Seminar in Sanaa for 27 ROYG officials. 
C. Are law enforcement agencies confronted with serious, 
widespread corruption inside their agencies? 
 
Yes, see question 3A. 
 
D. Are the intelligence services professional and capable 
of deterring terrorist actions? 
 
The intelligence services are moderately professional. 
Despite ongoing engagement and considerable CT successes, 
they have limited capability. 
 
E. Have the intelligence services been cooperative with 
U.S. Embassy requests or information and support? 
 
Yes, but often grudgingly.  Intelligence services rarely 
volunteer information.  Yet on some occasions the ROYG takes 
the initiative to inform the USG of CT developments -- e.g. 
in the case of ROYG success in September 2003 in disrupting 
a Sanaa-based al-Qaeda cell. 
 
F. Assuming there have been significant terrorist threats 
in recent years, have host country security services been 
able to score any major anti-terrorism successes? 
 
Yes. 
 
G. Has host country been responsive (re: timeliness and 
allocation of resources) to Embassy requests for protective 
security? 
 
Yes. 
 
H. How does the Embassy assess the overall security at 
major airports in the country? 
 
Poor, but the ROYG is receptive to additional U.S.-funded 
equipment and security training.  This view is corroborated 
by an October 2003 visit to Sanaa by a two-person 
Transportation Security Administration assessment team. 
 
I. How effective are customs and immigration controls 
agencies? 
 
Ineffective but improving.  Since February 2002, Somali and 
Ethiopian refugees have been entering Yemen at a reported 
rate of approximately 1,500 per month, adding to the 60,000 
refugees previously registered.  They are settling on the 
southern and western coasts, forming criminal and 
prostitution rings along clan lines.  Criminal related 
violence is on the rise.  With USG assistance, the customs 
and immigration services are attempting to standardize and 
modernize equipment and coverage. 
 
J. How effective are border patrol forces? 
 
In the recent past ineffective; however, a current surge of 
more than 7,000 troops from MOI/MOD resources and increased 
cooperation by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (to include 
collaboration on intelligence and smuggling information) 
has generally improved the effectiveness of border patrol 
forces. 
 
 
-------------------- 
INDIGENOUS TERRORISM 
-------------------- 
 
4. (S/NF)  Anti-American Terrorist Groups 
 
A. Are there indigenous, anti-American terrorist groups in 
country? 
 
Yes. 
 
B. If yes, how many? 
 
Four are known: Aden-Abyan Islamic Army (AAIA); Yemen 
Islamic Jihad; al-Qaeda Sympathizers; Yemen Hizballah. 
The Shi\'a Shabab al-Mou\'urineen (Believing Youth Group) 
(Sad\'a), is considered anti-American but not classified 
as a terrorist group. 
 
C. Have these groups carried out anti-American attacks 
within the last 12 months? 
 
No. 
 
D. Were any of these lethal attacks? 
 
N/A. 
 
E. Have these groups attacked U.S. diplomatic facilities? 
 
N/A. 
 
F. Have these groups attacked U.S. business, U.S. military, 
or related targets? 
N/A. 
 
G. Have these groups limited their attacks to specific 
regions or do they operate country-wide? 
 
N/A. 
 
H. If their attacks are limited to regions, are there any 
U.S. diplomatic facilities located in these regions? 
 
N/A. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Other Indigenous Terrorist Groups 
 
A. Are there other indigenous terrorist groups (not 
anti-American) in country? 
Yes. 
 
B. If yes, how many? 
Two: National Liberation Front (MAWJ) and the Right to 
Self-Determination Movement (HATM). 
 
C. Have these groups carried out attacks in the capital 
or in areas where U.S. diplomatic facilities are located? 
 
No known incidents of this type. 
 
D. Were these attacks lethal and/or indiscriminate? 
 
None known. 
 
E. Have any Americans ever been killed or injured in these 
attacks? 
 
No. 
 
----------------------- 
TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM 
----------------------- 
 
6. (S/NF)  Transnational Terrorist Indicators 
 
A. Are there any foreign terrorist groups that have a 
presence in country? 
 
Yes.  Al-Qaida, Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), al-Gama\'a 
al-Islamiya (AKA: The Islamic Group), Libyan Islamic 
Fighting Group (LIFG), Algerian Islamic Group GIA), Salafi 
Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), Hamas, Palestinian 
Islamic Jihad, PFLP, Hizballah.  The Iraqi Intelligence 
Service maintained a presence in Yemen prior to Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. 
 
In late February 2004, information indicated that the 
militant wing of PLO faction al-Fatah was at a 
meeting/seminar hosted by Kan\'an, a charity organization 
headed by President Saleh\'s nephew that supports 
Palestinian causes. 
 
B. How does the EAC assess this presence? Is it an 
operational cell?  Financial cell?  Support cell? 
Propaganda cell? 
 
Al-Qaida: all of the above.  Other groups may have links or 
cooperate with al-Qaeda. 
 
On 09/28/2003, the ROYG Minister ofInterior held a meeting 
with the U.S. Ambassador and various other Western 
ambassadors to discuss ROYG\'s disruption of a Sanaa-based 
al-Qaida cell targeting U.S, other Western and Yemeni 
objectives.  Highlighted was the targeting of the U.S. 
Ambassador\'s motorcade and the British Embassy in Sanaa. 
 
Per reftel F, on 02/14/2004, ROYG Minister of Interior held 
a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to advise that ROYG 
officials were investigating a possible plot to attack the 
Ambassador. 
 
C. Is the host government sympathetic to these groups? 
 
The Yemeni government is an active partner of the USG in 
the GWOT.  ROYG officially supports Palestinian groups, 
including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Lebanese Hizballah, 
but support is mainly rhetorical and does not extend to 
operational activities. 
 
D. Are there suspect non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
in the country that may have a relationship with any of these 
groups? 
 
 
Organization, Nationality. 
-- Al-Haramain al-Sharifain Foundation, Saudi Arabia 
-- Al-Ihsan Association, Saudi Arabia 
-- World Assembly for Muslim Youth, Saudi Arabia-- 
Dar al-Arqam Stationary for Printing and Publication,

-- Omar Bin Yousuf, UAE 
-- Qatar Charitable Association, Qatari 
-- Islamic Relief, UK 
-- Dubai Charitable Association, UAE 
-- Al-Fikrah Center, UAE 
-- Al-Islah Association, Kuwait 
 
E. Are there any ethnic or religious communities in country 
that are sympathetic to these groups? 
 
Yes, Salafi groups and mosques.  Public sympaty for pro- 
Palestinian/anti-Israeli groups is widespread. 
 
F. How does the EAC assess the level, intent, and scope of 
hostile intelligence services (Iran, Iraq, Syria, Serbia, 
Sudan, et. al.) in country relative to potential 
anti-American terrorist acts? 
 
Foreign hostile intelligence services, e.g. Syria, Egypt, 
Sudan and Iran. Primarily focused on information gathering 
for their own countries\' interests, not to assist 
anti-American groups in country with terrorist activity. 
Iran however is believed to be supporting the Shi\'a 
Believing Youth. 
 
G. How does the EAC assess the availability of weapons and 
explosives in country or from nearby countries for hostile 
terrorist elements? 
 
Yemen likely has among the highest number of weapons per 
capita in the world, with easy access to varieties of 
explosives.  Weapons and explosives are easily attainable. 
Gun markets are large and well stocked. 
 
Though Yemen is awash in numerous types of weapons, the 
Yemeni cabinet approved a series of amendments to a 1992 
gun control law intended to bolster regulation of weapons 
possession and trafficking.  These amendments must gain 
approval by the Yemeni Parliament before becoming law. 
Parliamentary opposition to the amendments remains 
significant; more than 150 MPs have reportedly signed a 
petition to quash the gun control law that is still under 
discussion.  Accordingly, Speaker of the Parliament Sheikh 
Abdullah al-Ahmar has publicly described possession of 
weapons as a Yemeni symbol of manhood. 
 
In a separate effort, the ROYG has initiated a weapons 
buy-back program, at a reported cost of 38 million USD 
to include rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) and a variety 
of other heavy weapons from civilian weapons markets. 
ROYG also intends to sign a Man Portable Air Defense 
Systems (MANPADS) buy-back agreement with the U.S. 
Citing the acquisition of over 1,400 MANPADS from January 
to June 2003, ROYG says the program is a success.  There 
are problems, however, such as: 1) cataloguing weapons; 2) 
ROYG paying over market value; and 3) the sustainability of 
the weapons buy-back program.

SENTENCED TO ONE-YEAR IN PRISON

     B. SANAA 2472 
 
Classified By: DCM Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (U)  Summary: On September 6, a Sanaa court closed 
opposition newspaper as-Shura for six-months and sentenced 
its editor Abdulkarim al-Khaiwani to one year in prison for 
violating the 1990 Press Law.  This latest incident, in what 
some are calling a bad year for freedom of the press in 
Yemen, led opposition journalists to accuse the ROYG of a 
systematic attempt to rein in the press.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  Abdulkarim al-Khaiwani, Editor-in-Chief of 
opposition newspaper as-Shura, was sentenced to one year in 
prison and his paper closed for six-months for violating 
Yemen\'s Press Law.  Following the verdict, he was immediately 
taken into custody and remains in prison currently, pending 
appeal (Note: Deputy Foreign Minister Noman told DCM 
September 21 that he expects Khaiwani will be released within 
the next few days.  End Note).  Police and Political Security 
Organization (PSO) officers surrounded the newspaper\'s 
headquarters directly after the ruling, ransacked the 
offices, and threatened staff members before closing down the 
newspaper\'s operations. 
 
3.  (U)  Article 103 of the 1990 Press Law prohibits members 
of the media from printing, publishing or broadcasting 
anything which: prejudices the Islamic faith; spreads a 
spirit of strife among the people; harms national unity; 
undermines public morals; or criticizes the person of the 
head of state.  By international standards, the law is vague 
and overly broad, allowing too much room for discretion in 
its implementation.  Khaiwani was found guilty of \"supporting 
the so-called al-Houthi in his rebellion,\" publishing reports 
damaging to the public interests, and \"public humiliation\" of 
the President. 
 
--------------------------------- 
YEMENI PRESS TESTS ROYG RED LINES 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  The Yemeni media are not subject to 
prior-publication state censorship.  The press commonly 
criticizes the government on a wide range of issues, 
including calls for economic and democratic reform.  Like 
others in the region, however, Yemeni journalists practice 
self-censorship and understand the red lines -- such as 
directly criticizing the President. 
 
5. (U)  Beginning in March, the ROYG has stepped up its 
efforts to influence the press.  Journalists and human rights 
activists report harassment by the PSO and by the newly 
formed National Security Bureau (NSB).  Three Sanaa 
journalists were given prison sentences ranging from three to 
five months for their articles on corruption and other 
controversial attacks on the ROYG, and in April Al-Quds 
correspondent Said Al-Thabet was fined and banned from 
writing for six months for allegedly investigating an 
assassination attempt against the President\'s son.  His case 
is also under appeal (Ref A). 
 
---------------------------- 
THE YEMENI PRESS FIGHTS BACK 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (U)  The opposition and independent press condemned the 
Khaiwani verdict, calling it a \"contravention of democracy.\" 
The Yemeni Journalists Syndicate has conducted several 
sit-ins in Sanaa to focus attention to Khaiwani,s plight, 
and the opposition carried out a one-week publication strike. 
 The Public Forces Union, a small socialist political party, 
called the verdict \"a reflection of the bogus democracy which 
the government declares and tries to promote abroad.\" 
 
---------------------- 
Saleh\'s Mixed Messages 
---------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  In recent speeches, the President warned the press 
that journalists covering the rebellion in Sa\'da may be 
charged with treason for questioning his actions.  In a 
another more bizarre remark, Saleh said he, \"knows who is 
paying papers,\" and criticized, \"those who hang around the 
doors of embassies and talk about democracy.\"  Noting those 
people are the same ones whose \"sons and daughters are 
recruited inside the American Embassy and they are the ones 
who say \'death to America.\"  (Comment:  Although the 
President pledged an end to the detention of journalists in 
June, ROYG difficulties in ending the Al-Houthi rebellion may 
have increased his sensitivities to press criticism 
throughout the summer as the conflict dragged on and 
casualties mounted.  End Comment). 
 
------------------------------------- 
Where is Al-Soswa?  Where is the USG? 
------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  In the midst of these attacks, noticeably absent 
from the public scene is Yemeni Human Rights Minister Amat 
al-Aleem al-Soswa.  In a meeting with Ambassador on the day 
of the verdict, she expressed that ROYG actions against the 
as-Shura newspaper were \"not justified.\"  She further 
revealed that she had contacted the paper and informed them 
she was willing to attend court hearings with them if they 
requested (ref B). Al-Soswa, however, has yet to make a 
public comment. 
 
9.  (U)  In the weeks since the verdict, local human rights 
attorneys, journalists, and activists have expressed their 
disappointment that the U.S. has not made a public statement 
against the verdict and deterioration of press freedoms in 
Yemen.  One prominent human rights attorney noted that the 
U.S. \"culture of democracy\" remains his hope and called for 
the USG to \"live up to its ethical responsibility to help 
Yemen in its pursuit of press freedoms.\" 
 
10.  (C)  Comment: It may be premature to judge whether 
recent ROYG actions comprise a systematic attempt to roll 
back press freedoms, or if they are a reaction to press 
criticisms during a painful and costly military episode -- 
the ten-week long armed struggle in Sa\'da.  While the press 
may be accused of bringing it on themselves by violating some 
clearly stated provisions of the press code; the ROYG is 
missing an important chance to demonstrate that it is ready 
to tolerate a genuinely free press even in difficult times. 
The press can truly push the envelope by lobbying to legally 
challenge the constitutionality of the current press code. 
End Comment.

WITH DCM 
 
REF: SANAA 2411 
 
Classified By: DCM Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary.  On September 21 Deputy Foreign Minister 
Mustafa Noman discussed with DCM the BMENA Forum for the 
Future Summit, ROYG support for the IIG, and recent 
Presidential statements and actions to rein in the Yemeni 
press.  Noman also offered condolences for the murder of 
American hostage Armstrong in Iraq.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
BMENA Forum for the Future Summit -- Not in Sanaa 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2.  (C)  Deputy Foreign Minister Noman immediately raised the 
ROYG\'s offer to host the BMENA Forum for the Future Summit 
(reftel).  DCM responded that, although a final determination 
has not been made, it is unlikely that the Summit will be in 
Sanaa.  Clearly displeased, Noman stressed that the ROYG 
would be extremely frustrated to see the Summit hosted by 
another state after President Saleh had \"taken a high risk\" 
by attending the Sea Island Summit.  Noman expressed concern 
that \"those who were against the President\'s participation\" 
in the G-8 initiative to promote reform in the region might 
use this tp influence Saleh to change course. 
 
3.  (C)  DCM told Noman that Yemen\'s G-8 BMENA participation 
was well regarded at the highest levels of the USG and 
advised that the ROYG not waste the opportunity to be a 
leader of dynamic change in the region over the issue of who 
hosts the meeting, adding that the decision of where to hold 
the meeting should not be interpreted as a weakening of USG 
support for the ROYG.  Noman nodded, but stressed that he 
understands the \"Yemeni psychology\" and expected many in the 
ROYG would indeed take it personally.  DCM responded that it 
was in Yemen\'s national interests to continue to play an 
active role in the BMENA G-8 process. (Note: Last minute 
requests from the ROYG to host conferences and receive 
high-level visitors are common.  The January Sanaa conference 
was organized at the last minute and, while successful, would 
have been strengthened with concerted long-term planning. 
End Note). 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Noman Condemns \"Horrendous Act\" Against American 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4.  (C)  Turning to Iraq, Noman offered the ROYG\'s 
condolences for the beheading of American hostage Eugene 
Armstrong in Iraq.  \"It is a horrendous act, and our hearts 
are with the family and friend of the victim and the American 
people.\"  DCM thanked Noman for his kind words. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Yemeni political and media support for IIG 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) Characterizing the recent visit of IIG Foreign 
Minister Zebari as an important first step, DCM said the ROYG 
could do more to provide political support for the IIG.  The 
message coming from the ROYG, noted DCM, should be one of 
encouragement for the political transition taking place in 
Iraq. Instead, DCM pointed out, official newspaper \"al 
Thawra\" continues to use the term \"resistance\" in referring 
to terrorist and criminal elements in Iraq.  These groups, he 
said, kill ten times more Iraqis than westerners and hurt the 
Iraqi economy by making investment in Iraq life threatening. 
DCM also objected to the continued reference to coalition 
forces as \"the occupation.\" 
 
6.  (C)  Noman agreed that there is no true \"resistance\" 
movement in Iraq.  As for the tone of al Thawra, he said, it 
represents a sentiment in Yemen and the region.  No one 
really controls the Yemeni press, the DFM continued, \"I will 
pass the message to the President, and see what I can do to 
get them to stop using these terms.\" 
 
-------------------------------- 
ROYG Campaign Against the Press? 
-------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  DCM raised USG concerns over the arrest of as-Shura 
newspaper editor Khaiwani for printing articles \"humiliating 
to the person of the head of state\" (septel).  DCM 
underscored his hope that this incident was not part of a 
trend.  \"Personally,\" replied Noman, \"I think this arrest was 
a mistake,\" adding that he believed Khaiwani would be 
released within days. 
 
--------------------- 
What is Saleh Saying? 
--------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  On related matters, DCM highlighted President 
Saleh\'s recent statements threatening the press and calling 
attention to FSN employees.  (Note:  In one speech Saleh 
warned the press that journalists covering the rebellion in 
Sa\'da may be charged with treason for questioning his 
actions.  In a another the president said \"We know who is 
paying papers,\" and criticized, \"those who hang around the 
doors of embassies and talk about democracy,\" adding, \"these 
people are the same ones whose sons and daughters (are) 
recruited inside the American Embassy and they are the ones 
who say \'death to America.\"  End Note). 
 
9.  (C)  Noman attributed Khaiwani\'s arrest and Saleh\'s 
warnings to the press as reactions to the painful military 
episode this summer in Sa\'da, rejecting the notion that the 
ROYG was implementing a systematic policy to roll-back press 
freedoms.  He predicted that, come October and Ramadan, a 
calmer approach would prevail.

------- 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
1 (S) General Lance Smith paid a visit, September 22, to 
Sanaa and met in a joint session with Minister of Interior 
Allimi and MOD Chief of Staff General Qassemi. Discussion 
focused on military cooperation between the U.S. and Yemen in 
light of the recently concluded fighting in Sa\'da  and the 
need to elevate that cooperation to meet the various regional 
challenges. Both ministers confirmed requests made before the 
fighting ended and stressed maritime challenges particularly 
in the Straits of Bab al-Mandab and the Red Sea. Practical 
steps were suggested to set up a joint operations center to 
monitor and react to maritime threats. General Helland and 
General Qassemi agreed to take the issue in their next 
meeting. End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
You have our attention: 
----------------------- 
 
2. (S) General Smith, in a joint session with MOI and MOD, 
September 22, opened with an overview of challenges Centcom 
was facing in Afghanistan and Iraq. Without underestimating 
the challenges, he stressed that we were on the right course 
and commended Iraqi PM Allawi\'s leadership and policies in 
trying to reach an Iraqi solution to the security obstacles 
in the path of planned democratic elections in January. 
General Smith then turned to Yemen and told his interlocutors 
that General Abizaid\'s and A/S Bloomfield\'s recent visits to 
Sanaa, coupled with Post\'s efforts, have raised Yemen\'s 
profile in Washington and that requests for increased 
military cooperation are receiving very favorable and high 
level attention in Washington. The General noted American 
officials\' sensitivity to casualties and difficulties 
suffered by the ROYG in recent fighting in the Sa\'da region 
and congratulated the Yemeni armed and special forces on 
recent successes in quelling the rebellion. General Smith 
concluded that the U.S. and Yemen faced common threats from 
international terrorism and that the U.S. was ready to help 
raise the level of cooperation in this regard. 
 
----------------------- 
The Strait\'s the thing! 
----------------------- 
 
3. (S) Minister of Interior Allimi, thanking General Smith 
for U.S. friendship and assistance, said that U.S.-Yemeni 
cooperation was needed more than ever in the aftermath of the 
Sa\'da fighting. \"We will certainly continue to face internal 
challenges,\" said Allimi, \"but we\'d like to turn your 
attention to our small Coast Guard (CG) and the large 
challenges it is facing in the Straits, coming mainly from 
our neighbors across the Red Sea.\" Allimi said that incidents 
of piracy, illegal immigration and drug trafficking have 
risen to alarming rates and could bring with them untold 
dangers in terms of terrorist infiltration and reestablishing 
of cells already destroyed by U.S.-Yemeni cooperation over 
the past three years. \"I am afraid,\" said the Minister, \"all 
the good work we have done over the past few years could be 
rolled back if we don\'t do something quickly about the rising 
threat from the sea.\" Allimi said that boats were regularly 
dumping illegal immigrants coming mainly from the Somali 
coast and that only some of those are being caught and 
interrogated before being returned. \"Many are simply poor and 
seek jobs but others are here for drug-trafficking, 
prostitution and arms smuggling. The situation is ripe for 
exploitation by new terrorist cells and criminals.\" 
 
4. (S) MOD Chief of Staff, General Qassemi, joined in to 
support his colleague\'s plea for maritime cooperation and 
assistance saying that the Yemeni CG has been able to detect 
smuggling and dumping of illegal aliens but usually too late 
to stop operations and, in any case, lacked the weaponry to 
intervene effectively. \"With all the Coalition naval vessels 
in the area, you would be in a much better position, not only 
to alert us but also to interdict and stop these boats,\" said 
Qassemi. \"Perhaps,\" added Qassemi, \"if you stop a few, others 
would get the message that they can\'t get away with this any 
more.\" 
 
---------- 
Joint Ops: 
---------- 
 
5. (S) Both Allimi and Qassemi offered that a joint 
operations center should be set up, either on Yemeni soil or 
elsewhere (perhaps Djibouti) so that U.S. and Yemeni forces 
could monitor and jointly react to piracy, smuggling and 
possible infiltration by terrorists trying to use Yemen as a 
safe-haven or base. \"At a minimum,\" stressed Allimi, \"Yemeni 
CG needs to be able to communicate with U.S. ships in the 
region to alert and be alerted by them to approaching illegal 
or hostile boats.\" Qassemi suggested that practical steps 
ought to be taken to translate what is clearly a common 
interest for the U.S. and Yemen into an actionable strategy. 
 
---------------------- 
We\'re in this together: 
---------------------- 
 
6. (S) General Smith agreed with his Yemeni hosts and said 
that he had no problem with the maritime coordination being 
proposed. General Helland, also participating in the meeting, 
said that he would be willing, on his next visit to Sanaa, to 
sit down for a working level meeting with General Qassemi and 
Minister Allimi to discuss the proposal in detail. The 
meeting ended with General Smith assuring Allimi and Qassemi 
that \"we\'re all in this together\" and that the U.S. and Yemen 
shared common threats and a common goal of dealing with 
security challenges in order to allow for the implementation 
of the broader, more important long-term goal, of democracy 
and development. 
 
7. (S) Generals Smith and Helland concluded their visit by 
attending a live-fire demonstration by CSF forces of a 
take-down of a sheltered target. Under the supervision of 
their CJTF (HOA) CT trainers, a CSF platoon went through 
their exercises flawlessly and were commended by the visiting 
U.S. Generals. Colonel Yahya Saleh, the head of CSF, thanked 
Generals Smith and Helland for the training which, he said, 
saved many lives in the recent take-down of rebel al-Houthy.

1. (U) On September 20 Ambassador, AID Rep and United Nations 
Development Program Resident Representative Flavia Pansieri 
signed a 1.59 million USD agreement to support the UNDP 
Decentralization and Local Development Support Project. 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minster of Planning and 
International Cooperation Ahmed Sofan and Minister of Local 
Administration Sadeq Abu Ras witnessed the signing. MEPI is 
contributing 1.2 million and USAID 390,000 USD to this 
program implemented by USAID-Yemen is designed to assist the 
ROYG carry out is stated goal of fiscal and political 
decentralization. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Decentralization Important For Long Term Development 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. (U) In early 2004, the Ministry of Local Administration 
requested US Embassy participation in this program to further 
its goals and encourage other donors to join their effort. 
Fiscal decentralization is a necessary factor in Yemen\'s 
continued long term democratic and economic development. 
Begun in 2001, local councils in Yemen have achieved limited 
success due to poorly trained members and lack of national 
fiscal and administrative suport.  The Local Councils Grant 
will support decentralization at the national level at the 
Ministry of Local Administration and support pilot activities 
at the pilot level in al-Jawf and Abyan governorates.  At the 
national level, the program will focus on developing laws and 
procedures to institutionalize transparent local tendering 
and citizen participation in decentralized Public Expenditure 
Management.  In Abyan and al-Jawf the program will support 
local councils to implement the tendering process. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Buttresses Overall USG Development Strategy 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The grant compliments Post\'s ongoing agricultural, 
health and education projects designed to train ministries to 
move professional planning and budget making to the director 
general offices in the Mission\'s five target governorates. 
Post\'s development strategy focuses on al-Jawf, Marib, 
Shabwa, Amran and Sa\'ada.  Abyan was added to the local 
council program because it is similarly poor and tribal to 
the other five governorates, but as a legacy from the former 
South Yemen, boasts higher education rates  and several 
active women\'s groups who could participate in a strong, 
active local council. 
 
4. (SBU) Comment: With the signing of the decentralization 
program, Post can more actively advocate for continued ROYG 
decentralization, which while accepted as a national goal 
faces opposition from strong central government bureaucrats 
loath to give up their power.  A fundamental component of 
Post\'s development strategy is bringing basic government 
services to remote, impoverished tribal areas.  Part of that 
process must be citizen involvement in local decision making. 
 By professionalizing local councils, the joint MEPI/USAID 
program will be providing the tools for disenfranchised 
Yemenis to make smart decisions about resource allocation to 
enable them to participate in the democratic processes.  End 
comment.

destruction of a minimum 1,435 Yemeni MANPADS.  Foreign 
Minister Dhabbi and Ambassador commented on the agreement\'s 
symbolic and strategic importance to the bilateral

2.  (S)  Deputy Foreign Minister Mohie al-Dhabbi and 
Ambassador signed a USG MANPADS buyback and destruction 
agreement at the Foreign Ministry on September 28.  National 
Security Bureau (NSB) Deputy Director Ammar Saleh, lead ROYG 
official on illicit weapons recovery, was present at the 
signing.  Dhabbi commented that \"this achievement reflects 
the seriousness and commitment of both sides\" to step up 
security cooperation, adding his hope that this level of 
cooperation will be achieved in other areas.  (Note:  Dhabbi 
commonly points out the need for increased development 
assistance, in addition to CT assistance, as necessary to the 
long term success of the ROYG\'s efforts to fight terrorism. 
End Note).  Ambassador concurred, saying that the region is 
now a safer place as a result of the agreement between the 
two sides. 
 
3.  (S)  Dhabbi also reiterated the ROYG request that the 
agreement remain confidential in order to avoid any internal 
public backlash while the program is ongoing.  Following the 
signing, DAO and head of USG technical team met with NSB 
Deputy Director Saleh to discuss  modalities for this and 
future operations.  Ammar confided that there are more 
systems out there and that the ROYG continues its efforts to 
locate and purchase them. 
 
4.  (S)  Comment.  The USG - ROYG MANPADS agreement has 
important bilateral and tactical implications.  When the 
process began September 1, President Saleh told visiting A/S 
Bloomfield \"we don\'t want, and we don\'t need\" MANPADS.  ROYG 
recognition, sparked its struggle with the al-Houthi 
rebellion, that Yemeni illicit weapons threaten internal 
stability, could result in ROYG willingness to be a more 
consistent partner in the GWOT.  At them same time, removal 
and destruction of at least 1,435 of these dangerous weapons 
favored by terrorists, is a significant tactical CT success.

Classified By: DCM Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary and Comment: On September 25 Parliament and 
the Shura Council voted by a clear majority to reject the 
ROYG\'s five year economic plan, which included several hotly 
debated economic reform proposals.  The economic package 
failed because there was no presidential initiative, no 
strategy to offset the economic consequences of reforms, and 
parliament\'s ongoing frustrations over executive branch 
corruption.  At the same time, the UK\'s Department For 
International Development (DFID) released initial results of 
a study on the impact of reducing oil subsidies and found, 
contrary to ROYG claims, that the effects on the poorest 
Yemenis would be minimal.  After a summer of blackouts and a 
long military campaign in the north, the Parliament\'s 
reversal of a corrupt government oil deal, and a rumored 
cabinet shuffle may signal a new focus on reform.  Until 
Saleh commits to reducing corruption, however, and presents a 
comprehensive plan that faces harsh economic realities, 
cabinet shuffles and reform initiatives will do little to 
help the average Yemeni.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Economic Reform Proposals Flatly Rejected 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) On September 22, the first day of a two-day joint 
Shura Council and Parliament session to discuss the 
Government\'s five-year plan, Prime Minister Ba Jammal was 
ushered out of the building as body guards of MPs shouted 
angry slogans at the unpopular prime minister. Local press 
reported that the group shouted  \"Down with Ba Jammal,\" Down 
with Salami\" and \"Oh Parliament, Oh Shura, Ba Jammal is the 
biggest swindler.\"  Returning to the joint session on 
September 25, Ba Jammal and his ministers attempted to 
explain the benefits of the reform package.  Members 
responded with harsh criticisms of government corruption, 
unemployment, and the state of the economy. 
 
3. (C) Background:  The economic reform plan (refs A and C) 
would have reduced diesel subsidies, rolled back customs 
fees, implemented a new General Investment Law, established a 
General Sales Tax, and streamlined the civil service.  The 
IMF, World Bank and most donors strongly encouraged the 
ROYG\'s adoption of the reforms.  In an attempt to provide 
political cover, the Cabinet asked Parliament to vote on the 
package in January.  Since February, however, Parliament, 
emboldened by their dominant speaker Sheikh al-Ahmar\'s 
absence from the country for medical treatment, has been 
asserting its role vis-a-vis the Executive on economic 
issues.  The Executive, on the other hand, has failed to make 
a convincing case for reform.  End Background. 
 
-------------------- 
No Push from the Top 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) While economic reform was one of the most actively 
debated issues in the press and at qat chews over the past 
year, President Saleh made few public statements supporting 
the reforms, and never argued publicly to cut the diesel 
subsidy.  In talks with senior USG officials, Saleh often 
predicted \"revolution in the streets\" if the oil subsidies 
were reduced.  Former Member of Parliament Saad bin Talib 
commented to Emboffs that there was no push from the 
President for passage of the economic reform package.  Shura 
Council Member and former Minster of Labor Mohammed al-Tayyeb 
described a disorganized GPC effort, with only a few 
loyalists supporting the reforms.  Some observers commented 
that the ROYG miscalculated in its attempt to gain 
Parliamentary approval for the economic reform package. 
Talib said he was \"shocked\" that the economic reforms did not 
pass, commenting that previously Parliament would have 
\"rubber stamped\" any executive initiative. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Impact on Poor Minimal -- Cost to Military High 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (C) Across town at the Ministry of Planning, initial 
results of the UK\'s DFID study on the impact of reducing the 
diesel subsidy in Yemen were released to donors and the ROYG 
on September 22.  According to the study, the poorest twenty 
percent of the population would see only a four percent rise 
in prices.  The DFID study cites price gouging by merchants 
as a more serious problem.  Noting the negative effects on 
farmers who rely on diesel to power water pumps, the study 
also points out significant fears among the populace as to 
the consequences of ending the diesel subsidy.  It quotes one 
participant in the study as saying if the diesel subsidy were 
eliminated, \"I would die.\" (Note: Fifty percent of Yemenis 
are employed in the agricultural field).  To counter this 
widespread misperception, the study recommends implementing 
an effective public awareness strategy on the true effects of 
the subsidy, as well as enhancing the social safety net. 
 
6. (C) Beneath the surface of debate on the effects on the 
poor, is the reality that diesel smuggling in Yemen is big 
business.  In arguing for the reform package, Deputy Prime 
Minster and Minister of Finance Salami said as much as 70 
percent of diesel is smuggled out of the country and high oil 
prices have pushed the ROYG to spend 5 percent of its GDP 
(more than is spent on education or health care) to maintain 
the subsidy.  Parliament is also actively discussing a nearly 
1 billion USD budget supplement, largely to offset losses 
from the diesel subsidy. 
 
7.  (C)  World Bank and Ministry of Finance sources all point 
to the military as the largest smuggler of diesel.  Many 
suspect the dire predictions of senior officials of the 
negative consequences of ending the subsidy are overstated, 
and hold that the military\'s reliance on diesel smuggling is 
likely the real reason behind ROYG reluctance to push for 
this reform.  (Comment:  along with tribal support, loyalty 
of the armed forces has always been one of the mainstays of 
the Saleh regime.  End Comment). 
 
------------------------------- 
\"The al-Houthi Cabinet Shuffle? 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Rumors that a cabinet reshuffle is in the works 
continue, including rumors that Ba Jammal will be the first 
to go.  Some newspapers point to three leading candidates to 
succeed the Prime Minister: Governor of Aden Shuaibi, Deputy 
Prime Minister Sofan, and rector of Sanaa University Salah Ba 
Sura.  Ministry of Planning Senior Advisor Jalal Yaqoub 
referred to possible changes as the \"al-Houthi cabinet 
shuffle.\" Insiders and observers alike point to corruption, 
daily blackouts in the city of Sanaa, and frustration over 
stagnant economic growth to be the issues fomenting a cabinet 
change.  Prominent GPC leader and Shura council member 
Mohammed al-Tayyeb, however, told Pol/Econ Deputy he did not 
think a change in government is likely for at least six 
months, believing that Saleh would wait until this cabinet 
had served two years to make sweeping changes. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) While Parliament is slowly finding its democratic 
legs, it is unfortunate that it chose to flex its muscles by 
voting to reject an otherwise desirable economic reform 
package.  The fault lies mainly in the ROYG\'s poor strategic 
economic planning.  For seven years the ROYG has been 
grappling with the diesel subsidy, without making any serious 
attempt to \"spin\" the changes or investigate ways to mitigate 
the effects of doubling the price of diesel and gas.  Three 
projects to build energy plants have languished in corrupt 
tendering processes for years which, had the ROYG moved 
forward on, could have easily small farmers\' reliance on 
diesel.  Parliament\'s protest vote rejecting economic reform 
demonstrates strong opposition to the status quo, 
particularly what is widely understood as pervasive 
government corruption; it did not offer and alternative 
package, nor does it currently possess the power to carry one 
through.  Economic reform in Yemen will likely continue to 
stagnate until the President commits to follow through on 
vague promises to reduce corruption and focus on painful, 
long-term economic solutions.  End comment.

such as the Air Force, are less likely to comply fully than 
others.  Poor inventory controls mean that some ROYG military

Yemeni military agencies.

thirty days are enough to comply with the checks.  However, 
if a military organization does not which to cooperate it

Classified By: Ambassador Krajeski for reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1. (S) Summary: In a follow-on meeting from his recent visit 
to UNGA, FM Qirbi raised questions on BMENA process with 
Ambassador on October 4.  Noting successful and positive 
meetings in Washington, Qirbi promised to look into recent 
irritants in the bilateral relationship including recent 
setbacks over intelligence sharing agreements.  Ambassador 
broached ROYG obligations under UNSCR 1526 to freeze 
Zindani\'s assets.  Qirbi replied that he was still waiting 
for proof from Washington of Zindani\'s guilt. End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
BMENA - Process Should Reflect Democratic Goals 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (C)  Expressing surprise over the process that chose 
Morocco as the next Forum for the Future host, Qirbi 
emphasized that substance was still the most important issue 
at hand for the Broader Middle East and North Africa 
Initiative (BMENA).  Nevertheless, Qirbi complained that the 
way the decision was made and presented to the Middle East 
Ministers  (i.e. as a fait accompli) creates the \"wrong 
impression among countries that were present at the outset.\" 
Qirbi pointed out that Morocco was among several nations who 
did not attend the Sea Island conference and suggested that a 
Forum for the Future based on democracy should have clear and 
transparent processes.  The Morocco decision, Qirbi added, 
puts Morocco in a difficult position and raises questions 
over how they will promote the USG agenda.  Ambassador agreed 
with Qirbi that substance is more important than location and 
underscored that Washington considers Yemen a regional leader 
in promoting reform. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Ambassador Calls for Consistent Cooperation 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (S)  Qirbi said that his New York meetings, particularly 
with U/S Grossman were \"very positive.\"  Ambassador took the 
opportunity to reply to Qirbi\'s request for expanded USG 
assistance for Yemen, ref A.  Highlighting progress in 
security, human rights and democracy, Ambassador said the 
Yemen-U.S. relationship now rests on a solid foundation. 
But, Ambassador continued, some smaller issues that have 
great resonance in Washington are complicating the overall 
relationship.  Ambassador cited recent hiccups over requests 
to expand intelligence-sharing as an example.  After 
al-Houthi was captured, Ambassador said President Saleh, MoD 
Chief of Staff Qassimi, and Minister of Interior Alimi all 
agreed to maintain the request for expanded intelligence 
sharing.  In response, USG proposed U-2 mission to gather 
intelligence requested by ROYG.  This mission was rejected by 
MoD,s General Gassemi.  Such a response, Ambassador said, 
generated some in Washington to question the overall 
relationship.  Responding that he was \"surprised by changes 
in attitude,\" Qirbi promised to look into the matter further 
and to overcome \"little obstacles\" in the relationship. 
 
4. (C) Raising recent problems between Yemeni ministries 
resulting in the cancellation of US Mission in-country 
travel, Ambassador requested more coordination to ensure that 
USG teams did not waste time and money waiting for permits. 
Qirbi asked that Post consult with the relevant governors and 
appropriate ministries to ensure coordination, but added that 
he would also talk to the Ministry of Interior about these 
issues. 
 
-------------------------------- 
ROYG still not moving on Zindani 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (S) Ambassador inquired if the ROYG had taken any action 
from the March designation of Zindani under UNSCR 1526 as a 
terrorist financier.  Qirbi replied that Zindani and his 
associates no longer travel outside of Yemen out of fear that 
they may be arrested.  Recalling earlier requests for 
complete evidence on Zindani\'s financial activities (ref B), 
Qirbi said that until the ROYG receives a full explanation of 
his guilt, they will not take action.  Ambassador closed by 
raising Yemen\'s UN obligation to freeze Zindani,s assets. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (S) FM Qirbi was clearly pleased with his Washington 
meetings and appeared willing to consider Ambassador\'s 
requests for more consistency in the relationship.  We will 
continue to push this theme with key ROYG officials, 
including Saleh.  While the issue of Zindani is contentious, 
the ROYG believes the ball is in our court and will likely 
not take any action to freeze his assets in the near term.

Classified By: RSO Tim Laas, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary: The Chief of Mission (COM) 
convened an EAC meeting on October 3, to assess recent threat 
information and discuss security-related issues followed by a 
review of the Emergency Action Plan.  EAC members concluded 
the meeting in agreement that no imminent threat was 
discernable.  Additionally, the COM called for a town meeting 
to review community security concerns and directed the RSO to 
raise awareness among Employees regarding the security 
environment following an increase in regional chatter 
indicating attack planning.  Also, on the agenda was 
potential fallout from fighting between Republic Of Yemen 
Government forces and a Shiite strongman in Sa\'da, as well as 
the verdicts in the \"Gang of Fifteen\" and \"USS Cole\" trials 
in Sanaa.   Key offices and personnel represented at the 
meeting included: COM, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, MO, PD, RSO, 
POL/MIL, SOC YEMEN, AND LEGAT and IMO.  End summary. 
 
2.    (C) The EAC began with a review of the overall threat 
environment noting the potential for serious security 
incidents following a series of major events in Yemen and the 
region to include the end of several weeks fighting between 
ROYG forces and a Shiite rebel Al-Huthi, who was killed in 
combat, as well as the handing down of severe sentences to 
USS Cole trial defendants.  Numerous events raise the 
spectrum of retribution by family or friends of victims and 
defendants although no imminent threats are now known. 
 
3.    (SBU)  The DCM pointed to media coverage of angry 
reactions to the Cole verdict by family members of the 
convicts and the EAC discussed increased chatter within the 
region that indicates the potential for a series of soft 
target attacks against westerners and local government 
officials cooperating with the United States Government in 
the war on terrorism.  The EAC noted already high and 
appropriate levels of security from RSO assets. 
 
4.    (SBU)  PER REFTEL, RSO advised the EAC of one incident, 
cable Sanaa 2539, whereby the Surveillance Detection Team 
identified a man filming the Hadah residential compound 
(where many official Americans live) on October 1.  No 
specific recommendations for improving security coverage 
resulted from the EAC.  EAC members agreed that Mission 
personnel should again be urged to vary their times and 
routes and avoid a predictable pattern in any other way and 
the COM directed the Consular officer to arrange a town 
meeting to review security with the community.  The town 
meeting is scheduled for October 10, 2004. 
 
5.    (SBU) The EAC discussed the recent degradation of 
Embassy perimeter security, reftel Sanaa 2475, resulting from 
ROYG,s unilateral removal of ram resistant barriers.  RSO 
advised EAC members that a diplomatic note went forward 
requesting ROYG to secure the now open perimeter with 
barriers.  The COM informed the EAC that he discussed the 
matter with the Minister of Interior during a state sponsored 
dinner on September 30th, receiving assurances that ROYG 
would provide a final solution soon regarding perimeter 
security.  EAC members discussed the possible impact that the 
loss of perimeter security might have on Embassy receptions 
held behind the Ambassador,s residence and agreed that the 
propriety of events at that location will depend on ROYG 
commitment to lock down the street with positive physical 
security measures to prevent the possible forcing of vehicle 
born improvised explosive devices VBIEDs.  RSO noted a recent 
DS assessment that the Embassy, EMR and MSG have excellent 
structural reinforcements but an outdoor reception close to 
the exterior wall might result in heavy casualties if a VBIED 
were placed against the wall during an event such as the 
Marine Ball. 
 
6.    (SBU)  The RSO noted DS funded physical security 
construction at the Yemen American Language Institute to 
install a public screening point where by the public could 
not force their way into YALI past unarmed Embassy guards. 
Unfortunately, Yemen city planning officials have threatened 
to arrest contract workers doing the upgrade despite MOI,s 
acceptance of the work.  RSO noted a Thursday, September 30, 
incident whereby a student failed the exams and returned to 
the school with angry and armed family members.  MOI 
personnel arrested the aggressive family members and secured 
the institute with additional armed guards.  RSO is working 
with the MOI to resolve the standoff on the needed security 
upgrade in the school. 
 
7.    (SBU)  EAC members discussed the recent alleged 
Al-Qaida tapes released by Al-Jazeera and the DCM requested 
actual text of the statement to review for Yemen specific 
references.  RSO provided the DCM a Reuter\'s report that read 
an audio tape attributed to Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qa\'eda\'s 
2nd in command, called on Muslims to organize resistance 
against \"crusader America\" and its allies throughout the 
world.  \"We should not wait until U.S., British, French, 
Jewish, South Korean, Hungarian or Polish forces enter Egypt, 
the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen and Algeria before we resist,\" 
said the tape. 
 
8.    (SBU) At the conclusion of the EAC, the DCM led a 
section by section review of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) 
canvassing the EAC for Emergency Action Committee input.  EAC 
members made numerous recommendations for improvements and 
reviewed current \"trip wires\".  The DCM directed EAC members 
to complete their review and EAP updates within 48 hours.

Classified By: DCM Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Reports of a ROYG crackdown on undocumented 
refugees are circulating amidst rumors the Ministry of 
Interior (MOI) released an internal report calling for more 
stringency in dealing with undocumented refugees in Yemen, 
particularly from the Horn of Africa (HOA).  It is yet 
unclear whether this current sweep resembles past actions, 
which resulted in few if any refugee deportations, or whether 
it represent a shift in ROYG policy towards refugees and 
illegal aliens.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Reports difficult to confirm 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) There are reports that ROYG has cast a wide net across 
the country to round up and deport undocumented aliens and 
refugees, particularly from Ethiopia and Eritrea.  Although 
the scope of the crackdown is difficult to gage, anecdotal 
evidence and press reports suggest increased activities of 
the security forces against aliens. 
 
3. (C) An official at the Ministry of Human Rights (MHR) 
confirmed an ongoing sweep of refugees in Aden and Sanaa.  He 
added that in addition to undocumented HOA refugees, the 
sweep also targets Sudanese nationals, and undocumented Iraqi 
women, many of whom are purportedly trafficked to Yemen for 
prostitution, ref A.  According to the official, the MHR does 
not know how widespread the round up is because undocumented 
refugees are afraid to come to the government for help. 
 
4. (U) Non-governmental sources close to the refugee problem 
in Yemen could not confirm a major change in direction in how 
the ROYG handles refugees.  An official at the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) noted that the ROYG 
tends to conduct annual sweeps of undocumented aliens, but 
usually just registers and releases them.  Refugees from 
Ethiopia and Eritrea are particularly vulnerable as they are 
not granted prima-facie refugee status.  This contrasts 
sharply with Somali refugees who are more granted prima-facie 
protection.  (Note: According to UNHCR, there are only 
approximately 2,000 registered Ethiopian and Eritrean 
refugees, far below the actual number which is unknown.  End 
Note). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Is the ROYG ready to change its tone on refugees? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5. (C) The current sweep follows unconfirmed reports of a 
August 3 MOI internal report on refugees rumored to state 
that there are terrorists and HIV positive individuals among 
the refugee population and recommending measures to address 
the situation.  According to a UNHCR official familiar with 
the report, these measure include eliminating the 
differentiation between Somali and other refugees, excluding 
refugees from employment and citizenship no matter the 
legitimacy of their claim, activating  security, committees 
nationwide to deal exclusively with refugee matters, creating 
a detention center to help facilitate more immediate 
deportation of refugees, and increasing the restriction of 
movement of refugees. 
 
6. (C) The internal MOI report sparked debate between MOI and 
other Ministries, namely MFA and MHR.  According to 
officials, MOI had become increasingly hard-line on refugee 
issues following the Sa\'da insurgency in the North, refs B 
and C.  Most recently, the MOI blocked the creation of six 
Permanent Refugee centers throughout Yemen to help house and 
facilitate Horn of Africa refugees. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C)  It is premature to judge whether or not this current 
sweep represents a new, stiffer ROYG refugee policy.  Human 
Rights Minister Amat Aleem as-Soswa has noted several times 
privately and publicly that international aid must increase 
if Yemen is to continue to take refugees.  What is clear is 
that the ROYG is serious about controlling and preventing 
further Iraqi women, probably trafficked, from taking up 
illegal residence here as prostitutes.  Post will continue to 
follow this issue as it relates to the status of refugees and 
TIP in Yemen.  End Comment.

1. (C) Post offers the following response corresponding to 
the letter of the questions asked in reftel. 
 
(a) Contact information for TFCO: Post\'s Terrorist Financing 
Coordination Officer is DCM Nabeel Khoury.  Post\'s Terrorist 
Financing Action Officer is Pol/Econ Deputy Jill Hutchings, 
who may be reached via classified email at 
HutchingsJE2@state.sgov.gov and unclassified at 
HutchingsJE@state.gov.  She may be contacted at all times 
through the Embassy switchboard: 967-1-303-155 ext. 2156. 
 
(b) Brief description of TFCO process at your post: At this 
time Post does not have a terrorist financing coordinating 
committee, but coordinates terrorist financing issues on an 
ad hoc basis. Action officer works closely with all offices 
at post including newly established LEGATT and Visas Viper 
process.  Post may stand up a committee in the future, if 
necessary. 
 
(c) What does post attempt to accomplish in its TF working 
group meetings? At this time Post does not have a TF working 
group. 
 
(d) Suggestions on how to improve coordination among TFCO: 
Post believes regional meetings and training on specific 
issues, e.g. hawalas, or nascent terrorist financing systems 
would be extremely beneficial.  Much of the training is 
targeted on countries with advanced banking systems, rather 
than countries like Yemen who are only starting to regulate 
the flow of money through its country. 
 
(e) Suggestions on how to more effectively engage in public 
diplomacy: Public understanding of the the terrorist 
designation process is minimal.  Our colleagues often ask 
whether a designated person will soon be deported to the U.S. 
 Background information on the designation process in Arabic 
would be extremely useful for our outreach efforts. 
 
(f) Indication if TFCO and deputy have received FSI or other 
training on combating terrorist financing; Terrorist 
Financing Action Officer Jill Hutchings attended the Summer 
03 training course at FSI.  To date, no other officers have 
received training. 
 
(g) What post needs from Washington agencies to make its TF 
work more effective? Post requests additional training for 
Yemenis on terrorist financing issues including,assistance in 
establishing a terrorist financing intelligence unit and 
training related to improving interagency cooperation.  Post 
assesses the capabilities of the ROYG to be extremely limited 
in their ability to track the flow of illicit funds.

2.  (S)  FM Qirbi nodded, saying \"I think you have a real 
problem.\"  Ambassador replied \"we\" have a problem, noting 
that Yemen is on record supporting a peaceful political 
transition in Iraq, and that stability in Iraq and the region 
is in Yemen\'s interest.  Qirbi told Ambassador that Yemen\'s 
statements at the UN call on \"all parties not to interfere in 
Iraqi affairs and to help Iraq achieve elections and full 
sovereignty.\"  Qirbi added that, in his analysis, the most 
difficult problem for the IIG is the presence of pro-Iranian 
elements inside IIG\'s institutions, making it difficult for 
PM Alawi by either opposing or shelving many IIG initiatives. 
 
3.  (S) Ambassador pressed Qirbi to live up to Yemeni pledges 
of support for the political process in Iraq by making it 
clear to the GOI that its efforts to undermine Iraqi security 
and weaken the IIG are a threat to regional interests. 
 
4.  (S) Pol/Econ Chief also raised this issue with Deputy 
Foreign Minister Noman.  Noman offered that some inside the 
ROYG are concerned over possible Iranian support for the 
recently ended al-Houthi insurgency in the north.  He said 
that the ROYG could approach the GOI \"in a brotherly way,\" 
but that it has little, if any, leverage with Iran.

1.  (S)  Summary. On October 16 Ambassador delivered reftel 
demarche to Foreign Minister Qirbi and called on the ROYG to 
live up to its CT commitments (reftel).  Ambassador stressed 
that ROYG failure to provide the USG with prior information 
on Ramadan releases of terrorism-related security detainees 
would be a major step backward in our GWOT partnership. 
Several hours later, Deputy FM Mustafa Noman informed 
Ambassador that the list would be provided October 17.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (S)  Background.  In an October 14 meeting, Minister of 
Interior al-Alimi informed Ambassador that the ROYG plans to 
release security detainees in a traditional Ramadan amnesty. 
Alimi said some of the individuals were associated in the 
past with al-Qaida, but all had been successfully 
\"reeducated.\"  Ambassador urged Alimi to provide the USG a 
list of the individuals for our review well before any 
releases.  The Minister of Interior promised to provide with 
a list as soon as possible, adding that previous releases 
were \"very successful\" and that as in the past, individuals 
released would be subject to \"constant surveillance\" and 
prohibited from traveling outside of Yemen. 
 
3.  (S)  Characterizing the potential release of 
terrorism-related security detainees an issue of urgent 
concern, Ambassador delivered reftel demarche to Foreign 
Minister Qirbi on October 16.  Ambassador told the FM that 
Interior Minister Alimi committed to providing the Embassy an 
advance list during an October 14 meeting \"as soon as 
possible.\"  In addition to names, Ambassador requested 
photos, dates of birth and other identifying material for 
review and comment.  Qirbi replied that he believed the ROYG 
would be able to comply with our request, and would consult 
with Minister Alimi and Political Security Organization (PSO) 
officials.  Ambassador stressed that failure to provide this 
information in a timely manner would be a major step backward 
in the our cooperative CT relationship with the ROYG.

SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING - OCTOBER 17, 2004 
 
Classified By: RSO Tim Laas, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary: The Chief of Mission (COM) 
convened an EAC meeting on October 17, to address security 
concerns as post moves closer to the U.S. election date and 
enters Ramadan, raising the possibility of major attacks. 
COM stated there was currently no information that there will 
be attacks in Sanaa but the holy month of Ramadan combined 
with the lead up to U.S. elections made caution warranted. 
COM stated it was essential that post employees inform the 
RSO if they planned large gatherings during Ramadan, 
especially non-official social events.  EAC discussed 
security concerns regarding upcoming Marine Ball at post and 
a planned Halloween party at post employee\'s residence.  RSO 
advised EAC to consider the merits of post\'s policy placing 
the local Russian Club off limits to embassy personnel.  Key 
offices and personnel represented at the meeting included: 
COM, A/DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, MO, RSO, POL/MIL, OMC, DAO, MED, 
LEGATT and IMO.  End summary. 
 
2.    (SBU) The EAC began with a discussion regarding the 
upcoming Marine Ball to be held at post in November.  COM and 
RSO agreed that current security plans are sufficient to 
support having the Marine Ball on the embassy compound, 
provided the local Ministry of Interior complies with RSO 
request to strengthen the embassy perimeter and to control 
vehicular access surrounding the embassy grounds.  RSO 
advised EAC that post is in close contact with host 
government regarding supplemental security for the Marine 
Ball. 
 
3.    (SBU)  RSO advised EAC that a Halloween party was being 
planned by an embassy employee with a potential list of over 
a hundred guests.  RSO stated that access control at the 
residence would be difficult to manage and the party would 
present a good target during Ramadon.  A German expatriate 
recently hosted a party at a private residence with a large 
contingent of western guests and security/access control was 
not sufficient in the RSO\'s view.  EAC determined that 
currently it did not appear to be a good time to host such a 
party and it was cancelled. 
 
4.    (SBU)  RSO asked the EAC to examine the merits of 
post\'s policy banning embassy personnel from visiting a local 
Russian club in Sanaa.  It was noted that, unlike other 
social clubs and hotels in the area, the Russian Club is 
located inside \"Tourist City\" compound with poor access 
control.  The club\'s high number of expatriate patrons 
combined with alcohol and a perception of inproprities 
between men and women highlight security concerns for the 
club.  COM did not desire to officially ban embassy personnel 
from frequenting this establishment but recommended advising 
personnel to heighten their awareness regarding the security 
of public places to include the Russian club.  EAC members 
agreed with this assessment. 
 
5.    (SBU)  At the conclusion of the EAC, COM reminded 
personnel to keep the RSO informed regarding any plans to 
have large gatherings at local restaurants, clubs, etc.  COM 
asked CONS to work with RSO in developing a warden message to 
be released to the community regarding the increased 
potential threat to westerners during the month of Ramadon in 
advance of the U.S. elections.

SUBJECT: MEETING WITH MOI AL-ALIMI: HOLD ON AL-BANNA AND 
DULQUM 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Krajeski for Reasons 1.4 b and d. 
 
1.  (S/NF) Summary.  At 18 October meeting with Minister of 
Interior al-Alimi, Ambassador urged continued detention of 
Jaber al-Banna and Hadi Dulqum.  Alimi said there were no 
current plans to release either of the detainees and promised 
to inform Ambassador prior to any decision to release them. 
Ambassador repeated USG request to render al-Banna to USG 
custody for trial in the U.S.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF) Jaber al-Banna:  Ambassador and Legatt stressed to 
Alimi our desire to have al-Banna, a dual U.S.-Yemeni 
citizen, rendered to USG for trial in the U.S.  Alimi stated 
that the Yemeni constitution would not allow for the 
rendition of a Yemeni national to a foreign government.  He 
claimed that the ROYG is facing increasing internal pressure 
to either present al-Banna for trial or release him.  Alimi 
said the USG failed to provide the ROYG with enough 
information to prosecute al-Banna and indicated that the ROYG 
may not be able to keep him in jail much longer unless the 
USG provides solid evidence of his alleged terrorist 
activities. 
 
3.  (S/NF) Hadi Dulqum:  Ambassador expressed the USG\'s grave 
concern regarding recent indications that the ROYG intends to 
release Dulqum.  Ambassador explained that sensitive 
collection and detainee interviews led the USG to judge 
Dulqum dangerous and that we want to see him remain behind 
bars.  Alimi was less committal as to whether the ROYG 
intended to release Dulqum, stating that Dulqum should not be 
of major concern for the USG, as the ROYG did not consider 
him to be a terrorist.  Alimi acknowledged that Dulqum may 
have supplied USS COLE bombers with explosives, but did not 
believe that this constituted evidence of Dulqum\'s guilt 
since he \"did not know the explosives were for al-Qaida 
operations.\"  He joked that if the ROYG arrested everyone who 
illegally sold explosives or weapons in Yemen, then 
\"thousands of Yemenis would be in jail.\"  Ambassador 
disagreed and stressed that the USG had reliable information 
regarding Dulqum\'s al-Qaida affiliations and his involvement 
in plots against U.S. and Saudi interests. 
 
4.  (S/NF) Legal Issues:  Alimi suggested that Legatt provide 
a list of charges and indictment files on al-Banna as soon as 
possible.  Once these documents were presented to the 
Attorney General, and if the ROYG deemed the evidence to be 
credible, then they would try al-Banna.  Legatt replied such 
documents had already been provided to the ROYG, but the USG 
received no response and no action was taken.  Alimi claimed 
that the documents did not go to the appropriate authorities 
and requested Legatt re-submit evidence to the MOI and the 
office of the Attorney General.  Legatt agreed to translate 
and deliver the documents within one week.  As for Hadi 
Dulqum, Alimi said that rendition to the U.S. or the KSA was 
a non-starter, adding that Dulqum was a Yemeni citizen and 
would be tried in Yemen, but only if the USG provides enough 
evidence to convict him.  Alimi also suggested the issue of 
Dulqum be discussed further between ORCA and PSO. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Comment:  Alimi repeatedly and unequivocally 
refused to permit rendition of al-Banna to U.S. custody.  In 
his view, the only option is trial in Yemen.  We can continue 
to insist on rendition, but it is our opinion that door is 
closed.  Legatt will present (again) details of evidence 
against al-Banna to the Yemeni Attorney General\'s office.  We 
have Alimi\'s assurance that the ROYG will not release Dulqum 
in the near future, however, his continued claim that Dulqum 
is an innocent arms dealer with no ties to AQ is troublesome. 
 We have presented the ROYG with substantial information 
linking Dulqum to AQ and will do so again.  End Comment.

1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Despite mounting pressure on the ROYG to 
release opposition newspaper editor Abdulkarim al-Khaiwani, 
he remains in prison.  The local press reported that the ROYG 
offered Khaiwani freedom in exchange for an apology for 
publishing articles that the ROYG considers personal attacks 
on President Saleh.  Khaiwani publicly refused to back down 
although government officials deny any such offer is on the 
table.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
ROYG to Khaiwani Say Sorry? 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  The local press alleges that the ROYG offered to 
release imprisoned opposition newspaper editor Abdulkarim 
al-Khaiwani if he resigns as editor of as-Shura newspaper and 
apologizes to the government.  Khaiwani has been imprisoned 
since his September 5 conviction for several violations of 
the Yemeni Press Law including 
\"supporting al-Houthi in his rebellion,\" publishing reports 
damaging to the public interests, and \"public humiliation\" of 
the President.  (Ref A.)  Attorneys for Khaiwani contend that 
the ROYG is attempting to resolve the matter in \"traditional 
Yemeni fashion\" by using family, party 
members, and alternative interlocutors. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Khaiwani associates report that he was visited in 
prison by a well-dressed and unnamed representative from the 
\"President\'s office\" offering to release him in exchange for 
a public apology and his resignation.  Khaiwani remains 
defiant, stating publicly that he has no 
intention of complying with the governments wishes.  ROYG 
officials deny such an offer was made. 
 
----------------- 
Pressure Mounting 
----------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Since Khaiwani,s arrest, pressure on the ROYG is 
intensifying. Several newspapers have dedicated entire issues 
to the case, and international organizations, including the 
United Nations International Federation for Human Rights and 
the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, have 
petitioned the ROYG for his release.  Domestically, 
opposition parties have held numerous meetings to discuss the 
matter and Parliament\'s Committee for Culture and Information 
has opened its own investigation.  Journalists report that 
they hope to plan a protest march to the President\'s house in 
the near future. 
 
5.  (C)  According to an official at the Ministry of Human 
Rights, HR Minister as-Soswah has discussed the Khaiwani case 
with President Saleh on more than one occasion pressing him 
to resolve it.  Other members of the Cabinet, however, have 
expressed disagreement with the arrest but 
refuse to weigh in.  (Ref B.) 
 
----------------- 
We want cartoons! 
----------------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  Opposition and independent journalists now 
consider Khaiwani\'s case a symbol of their struggle for press 
freedoms.  Journalists admit they are pushing the envelope by 
crossing traditional red lines, but note that the time has 
come to expand freedom of the press in Yemen.  One journalist 
commented that although the Khaiwani case may cause some in 
the media to increase self-censorship, it has 
also served to give hope to a growing circle of Yemeni 
journalists.  \"Our dream,\" he said, \"is to publish political 
cartoons of President Saleh in the near future.\" 
 
7.  (C)  Comment.  Some ROYG insiders believe that the 
President may have acted rashly to quell criticisms of his 
actions during the sensitive time of the al-Houthi 
insurgency.  One MFA official confided that Khaiwani would 
never been arrested if Presidential Advisor Dr. Iryani, ill 
at the time, had been by Saleh\'s side to \"calm him down.\" 
The ROYG now finds itself in a difficult position.  Currently 
convicted under the Press Law, releasing Khaiwani in exchange 
for an apology is tantamount to admission that the judicial 
system is an afterthought of the Executive.  However, 
continuing to hold him emboldens the opposition  and presents 
the media with a potent symbol in its fight to expand press 
freedoms.  A solution to the ROYG\'s dilemma may be a \"Ramadan 
Reprieve\" for Khaiwani.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: YEMEN\'S TENDERING SYSTEM - A TEST OF PATIENCE 
 
 
1. Summary:  Yemen\'s non-transparent government procurement 
process tops the list of frustrations for Western companies 
interested in investing in Yemen.  The poorest and least 
developed country in the Middle East, government projects offer 
one of the better ways for foreign companies to invest in Yemen. 
A drawn-out tendering process that is often overturned for 
\"political reasons\" discourages foreign companies.  On the 
positive side, unlike its Gulf neighbors, Yemen has no laws 
explicitly favoring Yemeni companies.  Foreign companies are 
permitted to bid alongside their domestic competitors.  In 
practice, however, domestic companies usually manage to win the 
contracts often acting as the major partner to an international 
company.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Political Pressure Takes Precedence Over Laws 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. As part of an IMF-directed economic reform initiative, the 
ROYG issued Law Number 7 of 1997 by presidential decree to 
organize government procurement.  In addition to establishing a 
government tendering process and procurement system, the law 
created the High Tendering Board, chaired by the Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Finance, and is composed of the 
Ministers of Planning and International Cooperation, Public Works 
and the appropriate line Minister.  The law gives authority to 
the Ministry of Finance to supervise the tendering process and 
the Ministry of Public Works to oversee technical aspects of the 
tender. (Note:  MOD Procurements are governed by another process. 
End Note).  The High Tendering Board considers tenders between 
150 million Yemen Riyals (YR) and 450 million YR (850,000 to 2.5 
million USD).  The entire cabinet votes on government tenders 
above 2.5 million USD.  Ministry level committees handle all 
tenders below YR 150 million Riyals (850,000 USD). 
 
3. In certain cases, the ROYG may issue a \"limited tender\" 
reducing the competition to three or more contracts for the 
following reasons: the need to maintain privacy, the risk of 
endangering public safety, urgent need, when there are only a few 
contractors who are able compete for the bid, and if the tender 
has been advertised twice without eliciting winning bid. 
 
4.  Despite the law, in practice the President can intervene on 
any tender and award the contract to a party of his choosing. 
The President and other high-placed officials have interfered 
several times to give tenders to parties of their choosing, 
rather than to the parties the High Tendering Committee awarded 
the contract. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Foreign Applicants Restricted In Practice 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. While the law treats foreign applicants equally, in practice 
Yemeni firms are treated favorably.  According to the tender law, 
the ROYG can conduct a \"pre and post- qualification process\" to 
verify that foreign bidders meet the terms of the contract. 
Foreign companies must appoint an agent or an authorized 
representative to be present when the bid is submitted. 
Investment Law Number 22 of 2002 gives preference to local 
agricultural and industrial products and allows the ROYG to issue 
a winning contract to those tenders that are as much as fifteen 
percent above the lowest bid if local materials and or 
contractors are used. 
 
6. This past summer revisions to the commercial law were 
announced that favor Yemenis.  Details about the law remain 
unclear, but as proposed, the law states that Yemenis must own a 
51 percent interest in all companies.  When asked to explain the 
new law, several ROYG contacts admit that they are equally 
confused and are seeking clarification.  If enacted this law 
could have a negative effect on future business. 
 
 
 
----------------- 
Tendering Process 
----------------- 
 
7. Tenders are advertised through international and local media. 
The ROYG employs local advertising only when the Ministry or High 
Tendering Committee determines that local contractors using 
locally procured products can carry out the project.  Foreign 
contractors may still bid on these projects, but they are not 
advertised internationally.  All government tenders are 
advertised in the government paper \"al-Thawra.\"  Tenders are not 
presently advertised on government websites, although the ROYG is 
developing its e-business capabilities and could do so in the 
future. 
 
8. The tendering law outlines standardized timelines, but in 
practice they do not exist.  The law stipulates that tenders are 
to be opened publicly a minimum of one month after the tender is 
announced.  Bids are to be submitted with bank guarantees of 2.5 
percent of its price.  Article Six of the tendering law states 
that \"all respective authorities ensure equally fair treatment 
for all tender competitors, and any applicant, contractor or 
importer, can challenge the chief of that authority or any higher 
official or resort to judiciary when prone to any harm or damage 
as per stated in this law and the regulating by-laws.\"  Due to 
weaknesses in the judiciary, however, this is not a viable 
recourse. 
 
-------------------- 
Yemeni Firms Favored 
-------------------- 
 
9. While the tendering law is generally fair as written, in 
reality American and Western firms face substantial 
discrimination.  Post has heard allegations that American firms\' 
secret bids were given to local companies who were then able to 
 
SIPDIS 
submit lower bids.  In one case an American company won a tender 
but no date was ever announced for its award. In Yemen, once a 
tender is awarded it is by no means final.  Intervention, 
cancellation, and recall are common. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. Comment: Post has engaged the ROYG at the highest levels 
concerning non-transparent and unfair bidding practices.  While 
Yemeni officials continually seek to bring in more Western 
investment, they have yet to heed Post\'s advice that attracting 
foreign investors requires that the ROYG first live up to 
international standards on transparency and accountability. 
Until the ROYG reforms its tendering system to allow foreign 
firms to compete, Government procurement will remain only a 
potential market for American firms.  End comment.

1. (S/NF) Pol/Econ chief discussed pending Ramadan prisoner 
releases with Deputy Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman on 
October 27.  Thanking the ROYG for providing the USG a list 
of potential Ramadan releases in advance, Pol/Econ Chief 
urged Noman to continue in this cooperative vein by taking 
seriously USG objections to the release of 30 of the list of 
138 pending further investigations into their al-Qaida 
connections.  She noted that Hadi Dulqum and Jaber al-Banna 
were of special concern to the USG, and that their unilateral 
release would cast a shadow on our partnership in the GWOT. 
 
2. (S/NF) Noman acknowledged the seriousness of the issue. 
The Dulqum case is particularly sensitive, said the DFM, \"I 
don\'t see how we could ever try Dulqum.\"   Pol/Econ Chief 
responded that al-Banna has been indicted in U.S. Federal 
Court for providing material support to al-Qaida, and Dulqum 
is a known and dangerous AQ supporter.  We are asking that 
the ROYG not release them in the coming days and weeks and 
allow us to find a way to deal with their cases without any 
time constraints. 
 
3. (S) Referring to upcoming TIFA talks, Noman lamented, 
\"it\'s too bad we cannot keep security issues separate from 
economic development efforts.\"  Pol/Econ chief agreed, 
confirming that his assessment was correct -- should the ROYG 
decide to proceed with plans to put known al-Qaida supporters 
back on the street, it would indeed have a detrimental 
impact, not just on security cooperation but possibly on our 
bilateral efforts across the board.

SUBJECT: INTERIOR MINISTER ALIMI ON RAMADAN RELEASES 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Summary.  DCM pressed Interior Minister al-Alimi 
on October 26 not to proceed with ROYG plans to release all 
138 security detainees, Hadi Dulqum, and Jaber al-Banna in a 
Ramadan Amnesty in the next days and weeks.  A decision to go 
forward, said DCM, may have serious consequences for 
U.S.-Yemen partnership in the GWOT..  DCM urged Alimi to 
continue to hold 30 of the 138, plus Dulqum and al-Banna, 
while we work together to investigate and build legal cases 
against them.  Alimi agreed in principle to cooperate and 
also recommended we work directly with the attorney general 
on the al-Banna and Dulqum cases to explore the possibility 
of prosecution; the MOI cautioned, however, that President 
Saleh\'s deadlines stood and any review of cases had to be 
accomplished within the set timeframe.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Eleventh Hour Meeting 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  DCM, COS, Legatt and Pol/Econ Chief (notetaker) 
met with Interior Minister Alimi at 2300 on October 26 to 
discuss the pending Ramadan release of 138 security 
detainees, Hadi Dulqum, and Jaber al-Banna.  DCM made clear 
the negative mood in Washington and possible consequences for 
the ROYG vis-a-vis USG cooperation and assistance on all 
fronts should Yemen release these known al-Qaida associates 
before a legal case against them can be assembled.  Alimi 
repeated the ROYG\'s position that the releases could be 
prevented only if the USG provided solid case evidence that 
could be used in a Yemeni court.  He added that we should 
trust the strong measures the ROYG would take to ensure that 
those releases stay out of trouble. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  COS responded that information on USG objection 
to the release of 30 of the 138 individuals would be provided 
the next morning (October 27), however, he stressed, it was 
incumbent upon the ROYG to build a legal case, according to 
Yemeni law.  DCM proposed a joint effort by USG and ROYG 
officials to review together the evidence against the 30 
detainees, Dulqum and al-Banna, in order to find a legal 
solution.  Alimi agreed in principle, but insisted that the 
ROYG had no other information and was relying on the U.S. to 
provide evidence. 
 
------------------- 
Dulqum and al-Banna 
------------------- 
 
4.  (S/NF)  In response to Alimi\'s claim that the ROYG 
possesses no evidence on Dulqum and al-Banna\'s links to 
al-Qaida, Legatt showed Alimi a 52-page dossier on al-Banna 
and promised to provide an Arabic translation within days. 
(Note:  the dossier represents the latest of several 
summaries of al-Banna\'s federal indictment shared by legatt 
with the ROYG.  End Note).  Information that links Dulqum 
directly to AQ, said COS, has been shared with the ROYG.  We 
do not believe that information is true, retorted Alimi, and 
we cannot try Dulqum on the evidence we currently have. 
EmbOffs pressed the danger in going ahead with the releases, 
pointed out several cases where the ROYG released individuals 
who went on to perpetrate suicide and other terrorists 
attacks in the region. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  \"We have laws,\" said Alimi, \"a Constitution, a 
Parliament to which we are responsible.  There are 
journalists, human rights groups, families of detainees we 
must answer to; we cannot continue to hold these men 
indefinitely without bringing them to trial.\"  DCM agreed, 
saying the U.S. is asking the ROYG to show it is serious 
about our partnership in the GWOT by not releasing known AQ 
associates while we work together to build a legal case 
against them.  \"The door is open,\" replied Alimi, but the 
President\'s deadlines stand and we have to work within those 
limits. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (S/NF)  During his phone call with NSC CT Advisor 
Townsend, Saleh agreed to postpone any releases until the 
20th day of Ramadan (November 3), and to hold Dulqum and 
al-Banna until Ramadan is over.  Neither Saleh nor Alimi, 
however, are showing signs of backing-down.  The ROYG 
continues to demand the USG provide solid case evidence to 
prevent the releases.  Although Saleh has in the past offered 
to hand over al-Banna in exchange for 5 million in rewards 
for justice program funds, the current ROYG stance, that 
Yemen law prevents extradition of citizens to other 
countries, in concert with their claim that he has not 
violated Yemeni law, leaves us at a stand-still on a legal 
solution for al-Banna.  We will report further developments. 
End Comment.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S TRIP TO ADEN AND TAIZ 
 
1. Summary.  Ambassador visited the port city of Aden and the 
city of Taiz October 11-13.  Aden and Taiz, the two former 
capitals of North and South Yemen respectively, are the two 
largest and most commercially vibrant of Yemeni cities 
outside the capital Sanaa.  NGOs, social activism, commercial 
expertise, and governmental innovation are a hallmark of the 
two cities.  Ambassador met with Aden Governor Yahya 
Al-Shu\'aibi, Taiz Governor Ahmed Abdullah Al-Hajjari, 
business people, academics, military officials, community 
leaders, and women\'s NGOs to share his goals for his tenure 
in Yemen and to hear their concerns and ideas.  End Summary. 
 
------------------- 
Taiz Water Projects 
------------------- 
 
2.  Taiz suffers from a lack of attention from the ROYG. 
International donors have stepped up to provide much of the 
needed municipal services.  The World Bank has devoted a 
large part of its 100 million USD water infrastructure 
development budget to projects in Taiz.  Taiz Governor Ahmed 
Abdullah Al-Hajjari, prominent businessman and local sheikh 
Ali Mohamed Saeed, and the Executive Director of the Water 
Authority Adel Magaref raised Taiz\'s dire water needs with 
Ambassador, explaining that while underground fresh water 
reserves in Sanaa can be reached with 300 meter drilling, 
authorities in Taiz must drill over 1,000 meters to reach the 
hot, salty, brackish water under the city.  This water must 
be mixed with clean water which is brought from outlying 
areas, however, the resulting water still does not meet clean 
drinking water standards.  The city of Taiz requested 
international donor support to improve drinking water in 
Taiz.  Taiz authorities believe building a desalination plant 
in the ocean side city of Mokha over 100 kilometers over the 
mountains from Taiz, and building a pipeline to bring in the 
water, is the only long-term solution. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
MEPI e-Learning Internet Classrooms Inaugurated 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3.  In Aden Ambassador inaugurated five Internet-ready 
computer classrooms that will provide Internet access and 
other education tools to over 4,000 students in five Aden 
schools.  This MEPI-funded program focuses on providing the 
information exchange and research tools necessary for 
building democratic society. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Aden Governor Shu\'aibi: Economic and Trade Development 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4.  Ambassador met with Aden Governor Shu\'aibi, widely 
considered one of the most effective and least corrupt ROYG 
administrators.  Since entering office two years ago, 
Shu\'aibi has improved decaying port and container facilities, 
repaired pot-holed and crumbling city streets, brought more 
consistent electricity services to the city grid, improved 
school buildings and equipment, and significantly decreased 
graft and corruption in the municipality. 
 
5.  Ambassador and Shu\'aibi discussed prospects for 
commercial development through the Aden Free Zone (AFZ) and 
the Aden Container Terminal (ACT) in the Port of Aden.  Both 
projects have stalled in recent years but show promise of 
reviving.  The Governor praised the U.S. program to develop 
the Yemeni Coast Guard (YCG), saying that without the 
presence of coastal security the port would be a commercial 
wasteland. 
 
----------------- 
Yemen Coast Guard 
----------------- 
 
6. Colonel Saleh Makullah, General Director of the Yemen 
Coast Guard (YCG), thanked Ambassador for US Coast Guard 
(USCG) assistance in establishing the Yemeni Coast Guard. 
After the Limburg attack, very few containers entered the 
Aden Port, however, said Makullah, since the YCG came into 
existence a year ago, the Port of Aden has enjoyed 280,000 
TEUs through its terminals.  Without the presence of coastal 
security, the Port of Aden could not have improved its 
security presence, enjoyed the lowering of commercial 
shipping insurance rates, and seen the return of some 
commercial shipping traffic. 
 
7.  In a major move, in recent weeks two Coast Guard ships 
moved to the Hodeidah port area to start patrolling on the 
Red Sea coastline significantly enhancing maritime security 
in the area. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Ambassador\'s Meeting with Women Activists 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8.  Ambassador met with Women\'s Rights activists in Aden to 
discuss their work in journalism, child labor, female 
workers\' rights, and democracy building.  Organizations 
represented at the meeting included the Yemen Women\'s Union, 
the Salvation Center for Women Care, Arab Foundation for the 
Support of Women and Juvenile Issues, Center of Human Rights 
and Democracy for Women, Association for Fighting Child 
Labor, and the Supreme Council for Maternity and Childhood. 
 
9. Activist Radia Shamshir shared her experience running as 
an independent candidate in the 2003 parliamentary elections 
after being passed over as a candidate for her party, the 
Yemen Socialist Party (YSP).  Ambassador noted that despite 
the many viable candidates, only one woman was elected to 
Parliament in the last elections.  The women described plans 
for addressing this problem by instituting a quota system, 
but complained that the ruling General People\'s Congress 
(GPC) party pays lip-service to the issue of women\'s 
participation in Yemeni political life. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Haifan Village: What a Little Water Can Do 
------------------------------------------ 
 
10.  Ambassador visited the Haifan Village Water Catchments 
Project in Haifan Village near Taiz.  Ahmed Al-Barakani, the 
Assistant Manager of the Public Works Project Taiz Branch 
Office, who helped execute the construction, conducted the 
tour.  The project, funded by 416-B funds, collects water 
from the rocky hillside and distributes it to irrigation 
points and water pump sites throughout the village.  This 
project has dramatically raised the standard of living in 
this 300-inhabitant village by improving productivity so much 
so that agricultural products, such as sorghum, have replaced 
qat cultivation as the primary crop.  (Note: this success 
story is an example of what will be lost without 416-B food 
aid programs in Yemen.  The major impact will be on poor 
rural villages where even a small donation of $80,000 can 
bring significant and dramatic improvements to food security, 
access to water, and prosperity.  End Note).

SUBJECT: HUMANITARIAN DEMINING ASSISTANCE TO YEMEN HELPS 
USG POLICY 
 
1.  This is an action request.  See paragraph 2. 
 
2.  Summary and Action Request.  Funds for the USG Yemeni 
Humanitarian Demining Program (HDP) may be cut entirely in FY 
05. Approaching its seventh year, Yemen\'s HDP (YHDP) is an 
example of how USG humanitarian assistance can successfully 
help meet USG policy goals in the region.  Ending assistance 
to the YHDP at this time would have a negative impact on 
Yemen\'s ability to attain self-sufficiency in demining in the 
near future, and on USG CT and PD goals in the region.  Post, 
therefore, urges continued funding for FY 05.  End Summary 
and Action Request. 
----------------- 
Program successes 
----------------- 
 
3.  Since the USG began contributing to the Yemen\'s National 
Mine Action Center\'s (NMAC) demining efforts, over 80,900 
Unexploded Ordinances (UXOs) and 1,000 assorted mines from 
more than 86 minefields have been cleared.  All areas in 
Yemen that were considered to be high impact (where the 
presence of mines significantly changes the daily activities 
of a community), and 40 percent of all medium impact areas 
are now considered mine-safe.  The program was also the first 
in the world to have a civilian and a military component and 
to complete a Level One Survey which takes into account the 
social impact of mine locations.  With USG help, the Yemen 
NMAC has developed a strategic plan with an achievable end 
state of self-sufficiency. 
 
--------------------------- 
HDP promotes U.S. interests 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  HDP has also served as an effective method to extend U.S. 
public diplomacy to remote areas of the country at a time 
when hostility to U.S. policy in the region is high.  The 
NMAC readily acknowledges and teaches local populations that 
the USG is the longest sustaining and single donor to the 
program.  Locally affected populations regularly thank 
Emboffs who visit mine-affected areas for USG support.  It is 
noteworthy that during the 2000 attack on the USS Cole, 
U.S.-trained Yemeni demining troops were the first on the 
scene, and worked tirelessly to aid U.S. sailors. 
 
--------------------------- 
Humanitarian considerations 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  In the past year YHDP has worked diligently on the 
approximately 700 square kilometers of mid and low level 
areas where populations are negatively impacted economically 
by mine ridden and therefore fallow land.  The last year has 
also seen NMAC clear 517 mines and 6,691 UXOs from 
significantly tougher terrain than in previous years. 
 
------------ 
Almost there 
------------ 
 
5.  While the Yemen HDP is close to becoming self-sustaining, 
there is no doubt that it still requires US aid to remain 
vital through to self-sufficiency.  USG funding currently 
comprises 12 percent of its yearly funds and, over the course 
of its support, has provided 50 percent of all its equipment. 
 The NMAC staff has a solid end state in mind and a 
restructuring underway to met it.  Cutting USG funding at 
this time will have a negative impact on reaching demining 
self-sufficiency in Yemen. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  Yemen HDP funding is a diplomatic and operational success 
in a core country in the GWOT.  While humanitarian concerns 
have decreased significantly due to the program\'s previous 
successes, the need for continued CT cooperation, public 
diplomacy efforts, and the long-term success of the Yemeni 
demining program make continued USG HDP support vital. 
Furthermore, mines and UXOs still significantly affect the 
country\'s economy.  Post urges continued funding from this 
program for FY 05.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: IPR IN YEMEN: NEW LAWS AND ENHANCED ENFORCMENT NEEDED 
 
REF A O3 Sanaa 2776 
 
1. Summary.  Intellectual Property Rights Laws in Yemen need to 
be updated to meet Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights Standards (TRIPS), and existing laws should be enforced. 
Although it is not a major transit point or purchaser for 
illicitly produced goods and is not on USTR Special 301 watch 
list, Yemen does not have adequate IPR laws.  The Ministries 
charged with enforcing IPR regulations suffer from poorly trained 
staff and offer little incentive to pursue IPR violations.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. Yemen is not on USTR\'s Special 301 Watch List as a country of 
concern for Intellectual Property Rights violations.  The amount 
of smuggled and pirated goods is growing, however, and illegal 
copies of software, DVDs and music can be purchased at some 
stores in major cities.  At this time, Post is unaware of any 
pirated goods being produce illegally Yemen.  Most pirated 
products are likely smuggled from other countries and sold in 
Yemen.  Due to Yemen\'s extreme poverty, however, the market for 
such items is limited. 
 
----------------------- 
\"Tite\" Still on Shelves 
----------------------- 
 
3. The Tide/Tite issue (Ref A) is a case-study on the failure of 
IPR enforcement in Yemen.  Proctor and Gamble (P&G) initiated 
court proceedings against the local manufacturer of Tite laundry 
detergent in 1999 for violating their Tide patent.  Having won 
three cases (including a Supreme Court ruling in 2003), Tite 
laundry detergent is still on supermarket shelves and P&G is in 
private arbitration talks.  Continued discussions with the 
Ministry of Industry\'s Office of Patent Enforcement have produced 
no effective response.  In the Tide case, Yemen\'s laws worked 
(albeit slowly), but the Supreme Court\'s decision was not 
enforced and there is no political will to resolve this 
outstanding IPR issue. 
 
-------------------------- 
New IPR Legislation Needed 
-------------------------- 
 
4. Yemen\'s IPR laws are not WTO compliant and legislation 
designed to address many Trade Related aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights Standards (TRIPS) languishes in Parliament. 
Yemen\'s patent, industrial design, and copyright laws all must be 
revised to meet international standards.  The U.S. submitted 
several specific questions on Yemen\'s Memorandum of Foreign Trade 
Regime aimed at TRIPS compliance for patent and copyright laws. 
The Ministry of Culture and Tourism submitted to Parliament an 
amended copyright law that addressed specific concerns over 
software piracy and is TRIPS compliant, but Parliament still has 
not ratified the adjustments.  Gaps such as geographical 
indicators, topographies (integrated circuits layout), 
undisclosed information (especially those related to trade 
secrets), and anti-competitive behavior in contractual licenses 
 
SIPDIS 
still need to be addressed in future legislation. 
 
------------------ 
Who Controls What? 
------------------ 
 
5. The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) controls patents and 
trademarks.  The World Intellectual Property Organization 
provided computers and other English language training for Patent 
officers. Four IPR departments reside in MIT: Patents and 
Industrial Designs; Trademark Registration; Trademark Depository; 
and Public Awareness.  The offices suffer from lack of English 
training, limited awareness of IPR trends and insufficient 
equipment to carry out their functions. 
 
6. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism enforces copyright laws. 
The Ministry is less adept at enforcing its laws that MIT and 
suffers from inadequate resources.  Executives from Microsoft 
along with the private NGO the Business Software Alliance are 
lobbying the ROYG to adopt the changes to the copyright laws 
concerning software piracy.  If such a law is drafted, Microsoft 
will open an office in Yemen.  Enforcement of the laws falls to 
Ministry of Interior and Customs, with little interaction, except 
if encouraged by companies. 
 
7. In July, President Saleh announced an anti-smuggling 
initiative aimed at fighting software piracy and asked Yemen\'s 
Chamber of Commerce to raise awareness regarding the problem. 
Post has seen no movement to extend enforcement, take readily 
available pirated software off the shelves, or pass legislation 
to enhance enforcement. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Untrained Officials Enforcing Little Understood Laws 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8. Judges and prosecutors lack training to prosecute IPR cases. 
Cases take years to wind their way through Yemen\'s judicial 
systems; decisions, as in the Tide case, are not enforced. 
Further complicating the situation in Yemen is the combination of 
laws from both the former South and North.  Judges from the South 
often did not receive training in the new commercial laws they 
are required to enforce.  The ROYG is taking small steps to 
address the problem and is looking at upgrading the commercial 
courts in both Sanaa and Aden to meet business needs. 
 
9. Companies who bring IPR complaints to various ministries 
receive attention, but the ministries charged with enforcing IPR 
laws do not take action.  Several businessmen note that once they 
inform the Customs Authority of a problem, officials are helpful 
and usually act to seize goods.  On the flip side, there seems 
little political will to initiate cases of IPR enforcement. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
New Laws, Enhanced Enforcement Equals Revenue 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
10. Comment:  With declining oil revenues and high unemployment, 
even small steps toward improving Yemen\'s investment climate are 
important to encourage foreign investment.  Until now, the IPR 
message is usually linked to the far off WTO accession goal and 
not the fact that expanded IPR protections will directly benefit 
Yemenis.  The pitch for expanded IPR enforcement and new laws 
should focus on the benefits of job creation and expanded tax 
revenue Yemen would receive should they take necessary steps 
toward WTO accession.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: LABOR RIGHTS IN YEMEN:  LAW VERSUS REALITY 
 
1.  Summary.  As is common to poor underdeveloped countries 
with former socialist influences, Yemen has many laws on the 
books to protect the rights of workers.  In practice, 
however, the ruling General People\'s Congress (GPC) party has 
neutralized the major trade unions by placing party-appointed 
leaders in their ranks.  This summer the ROYG resorted to 
using police force to shut-down unionization efforts.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
The Labor Code:  What\'s on the Books 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  A 1995 Presidential Order and a major 1997 amendment to 
the Labor Code provide for the collective agreements, 
termination of contracts, wage determination, penalties and 
disciplinary measures for violations of the law.  The Code 
applies to all workers except public servants, foreigners, 
\"casual workers\" (day-laborers), and domestic servants. 
Article Five states that \"work is the natural right and duty 
of every citizen on the basis of equal conditions and 
opportunities, without discrimination on the grounds of sex, 
age, race, color, beliefs or language.\" 
 
3.  According to the Labor code, non-Yemenis may not 
constitute more than 10 percent of any employer\'s workforce. 
In practice, not all firms can abide by this provision, 
particularly in sectors where skilled and technical labor is 
required such as oil exploration, and service and hotel 
industry.  Yemen lacks a skilled, technically proficient, 
English-speaking native labor force.  The literacy rate in 
Yemen hovers around 65 percent for men and 35 percent for 
women.  Most foreign companies make separate agreements with 
the ROYG to keep their predominantly foreign technical 
workforce and agree to slowly convert foreign held jobs to 
Yemenis by implementing training and skills-building 
programs.  The ROYG enforces government regulations 
sporadically and often for political reasons -- particularly 
where oil revenues are involved.  The paucity of skilled 
labor effects government and private businesses.  Businessmen 
complain that this is one of their biggest challenges in 
Yemen. 
 
4.  Article 42 of the Labor Code stipulates that women are 
equal to men in conditions of employment and employment 
rights.  However, women activists and NGOs report that 
discrimination is a common practice in both the public and 
private sectors.  Mechanisms to enforce equal protection are 
weak or non-existent. 
 
5.  Under Article 32 of the Code, the ROYG may invalidate any 
collective agreement \"damaging the economic interests of the 
country.\"  This article gives the government wide leeway to 
interfere with or discourage collective agreements and 
unionization.  If a labor dispute cannot be settled amicably, 
the law calls for the dispute to be submitted to an 
arbitration committee for resolution.  If arbitration fails, 
workers may strike under specified conditions.  Each worker 
must announce his/her intention to strike by wearing a red 
armband for three consecutive days before the commencement of 
the strike (Article 146). 
 
6.  The Labor codes cover a great diversity of additional 
labor issues including: 
 
- Wages and allowances, including minimum wage and overtime

Recent Episodes Illustrate ROYG Intervention 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  In reality, the labor situation in Yemen is much bleaker 
than the laws suggest.  Two recent incidents illustrate the 
ROYGs willingness to manipulate or circumvent the Labor Code. 
 On July 5, a disagreement between management of the 
government-owned Yemenia airlines and its pilots erupted into 
a full-blown strike.  An undisclosed agreement was reached 
between management and the pilots, but subsequently pilots 
complained that the administration did not honor their 
commitments.  The pilots further allege that the airlines 
instructed its physicians to find the strike leaders \"unfit 
to fly.\" 
 
8.  In another recent incident, Sanaa Airport technicians 
decided to unionize to protect themselves from what they saw 
happen to the Yemenia pilots.  Deputy Minister of Labor 
Muhammed Ali Ba-Musallam agreed to be present at the 
technicians\' vote for unionization.  News articles and other 
sources reported that Prime Minister Abdul Qadir Ba-Jammal 
instructed airport police to block Deputy Labor Minister 
Ba-Musallam from reaching the meeting site.  Ba-Musallem 
called the technicians to meet him on the airport road to 
conduct the vote.  The result of the vote for unionization 
was never made public.  Ba-Musallem fled to his home province 
for \"vacation,\" has subsequently been sidelined, his 
responsibilities delegated to other officials, and he is 
expected to resign or be fired for his unionization efforts. 
 
9.  Comment:  Many labor unions in Yemen are under the 
indirect authority of the ruling GPC party.  They do not 
function as a check on the government authorities or on 
management practices.  Even in Aden, which enjoys a long 
tradition of workers rights, beginning with the establishment 
of the first Yemeni labor union in the 1880s, the port 
workers\' union, the GPC has placed party loyalists in union 
leadership positions.  The only organized professional group 
that has shown significant independence from the GPC is the 
Yemeni Journalists Syndicate (YJS).  The YJS has been vocal 
in condemning recent ROYG actions to close several 
publications and to jail an editor for publishing articles 
critical of President Saleh.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: INVESTMENT CLIMATE CHANGES, CHALLENGES AHEAD FOR 
FOREIGN INVESTORS IN YEMEN 
 
REF: SANAA 2521 
 
1. Summary.  Corruption and non-implementation of existing 
laws and regulations make the investment climate appear 
nontransparent and arbitrary to most foreign investors. 
Concerns over security and ROYG non-movement on a critical 
economic reform package (ref A) create an inhospitable 
picture for investors.  Although the ROYG adopted in the late 
1990s marginal measures to reduce state intervention in 
commercial activities, the ROYG must now focus on economic 
diversification, civil service reform, eliminating the last 
of the petroleum subsidies, and attracting foreign 
investment.  A September 2004 World Bank report warned of the 
imminent collapse of the economic reform package that the 
country has been implementing since 1995.  Last month\'s 
report stressed unsatisfactory and tardy reform 
implementation.  Most recently, a September 30 Presidential 
decree significantly strips down foreign investors\' rights in 
Yemen gained by the 2002 Investment Law.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Trade Policy Devolution 
------------------------ 
 
2. Excessively complex customs procedures make foreign 
investors wary of Yemen,s commercial climate and act as a 
significant trade barrier.  Customs reform is one of the key 
areas of concern cited by the World Bank, foreign investors 
and donors.  Most foreign investors are forced to obtain the 
intermediary services of a local Yemeni agent to navigate the 
complicated and nontransparent system of corruption, 
government regulations, and business practice in Yemen. (See 
septel on Customs Laws.) 
 
3.  While there are no provisions in the investment code 
regarding agency, many foreign firms work with Yemeni agents. 
 Econ/Commoff has spoken to a few of these firms who act as 
an agent for Western companies.  These businesspeople mention 
that American firms request that they sign an agreement that 
they will adhere to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 
with full knowledge and implicit understanding that the US 
company has hired the agent to facilitate their joint 
commercial interests in Yemen by whatever means necessary. 
As is common practice in corruption-ridden economies, 
American firms hire agents as an additional legal safeguard 
against allegations of contributing to corruption in foreign 
countries. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Investment Law and Recent Changes 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. The ROYG hopes that by streamlining investment laws and 
procedures, Yemen will attract more foreign investment.   In 
2002, the General Investment Authority (GIA) was given a new, 
expanded mandate to promote and regulate investment.  The 
2002 Investment Law granted nearly equal treatment to all 
investors, domestic and foreign, yet a Presidential decree in 
recent weeks may significantly threaten this treatment (See 
para 6).  While the written laws and regulations encourage 
foreign investment, in practice, laws and regulations are not 
enforced equally nor consistently.  The foreign investment 
community in general does not view the GIA as an effective 
promotion nor regulation body.  While advocating for American 
companies, proposals, it has become clear to the Embassy 
that the GIA cannot approve or influence approval of major 
investment projects in Yemen without the verbal or written 
approval from more powerful political entities, such as the 
President for petroleum projects.  The GIA situation 
represents a basic fact of political life in Yemen where 
decision-making power has been centralized to a few key 
political figures, without whose approval most projects and 
initiatives cannot move forward. 
 
5. Most foreign investment focuses in the oil and natural gas 
sector.  Production-sharing agreements (PSAs) are negotiated 
with all exploration and production activity by the Ministry 
of Oil and are usually allocated by tender.  A few sectors 
are prohibited from foreign investment: arms and explosives, 
banking, currency exchange, industries that could damage the 
environment, and wholesale and retail imports.   As for 
capital flows, the ROYG does not restrict payments and 
transfers in and out of country for foreign investors; 
foreign exchange accounts are permitted. 
 
6. On September 30, President Ali Abdullah Saleh issued a 
Republican decree amending Article 28 of the Investment Law 
32/1991, banned non-Yemenis from conducting business in the 
Republic of Yemen &unless they have Yemeni partner(s) with a 
capital share of no less than 51%.8  The law excludes 
non-Yemenis working in small businesses.  Foreign 
businesspeople in Yemen report to the Econ/Commoff that the 
GIA has already notified them that this amendment will impact 
their proposed investments before the GIA. 
 
----------------------------- 
Ineffective Commercial Courts 
----------------------------- 
 
7. Discussions regarding investment cannot be complete 
without serious consideration of the commercial court system. 
 Resolution of commercial disputes can be reported to take as 
much as seven years and even then, decisions are not 
regularly enforced by law enforcement.  One businessman 
shared with the Econ/Commoff that when the police went to 
enforce a court order at a factory, its owner commanded his 
private guards to shoot back at the police.  Outgunned, the 
police retreated and declined to re-attempt the court order 
enforcement. 
 
8. Most businesspeople resort to extra-judicial resolution 
arenas, such as consultations with tribal sheikhs and others, 
to solve their business disputes. In the last year, the Taiz 
Chamber of Commerce initiated arbitration services for 
businesspeople in its district.  Arbitration programs in Taiz 
and Sanaa are making some progress and several donors are 
considering expanding projects to help improve Yemen,s 
investment climate. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. The Embassy faces a difficulty in encouraging investors to 
come to Yemen.  Without a highly-attractive incentive, such 
as Yemen,s natural gas and oil resources, most foreign 
companies will find the investment climate unappealing.  It 
is widely known that even the major Yemeni businesses take 
their earnings and invest abroad, not within Yemen.  When 
examining the investment laws, Yemen rates relatively well 
but when it comes to practice of implementing the 
regulations, promoting foreign investment, the ROYG has not 
succeeded in combating corruption and creating a fertile 
investment climate.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: WTO UPDATE FOR YEMEN - FIVE YEARS AND COUNTING 
 
1. Summary/Comment. While accession to the World Trade 
Organization is still five to seven years out, with the first 
working party meeting to be held in Geneva on November 30 Yemen 
will enter a new, more difficult stage of trade negotiations. 
Through the Integrated Framework (IF) process sponsored by the 
Dutch, the ROYG and donors developed an action plan for joining 
the WTO.  Supporters of accession now must garner support from 
ROYG Ministries, Parliament, and powerful business interests to 
adopt measures necessary to accede.  End summary/comment. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
First Working Party Meeting in November 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. Yemen was granted observer status to the WTO in 1999.  In July 
2000 the WTO set up a working party process for Yemen\'s 
accession.  Yemen submitted its Memorandum of Foreign Trade 
Regime in 2000 and will hold its first working party meeting 
November 30 in Geneva. Nagib Hamim, WTO Technical Advisor at the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade, (MIT) explained, \"this is when 
the hard work begins.\"  Hamim will travel to Washington as part 
of the ROYG delegation to the Trade Investment Framework 
Agreement (TIFA) talks in November.  MIT has the lead in 
preparing for accession and acts as secretariat for the Council 
of Ministers that approves all major documents. 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
Integrated Framework Rejuvenated? 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. Yemen concluded the diagnostic phase of the World Trade 
Organization\'s Integrated Framework (IF) Process with the 
completion of the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study in June 
2003.  Due to bureaucratic delays, Yemen is now beginning to 
implement the action plan.  The ROYG is planning to conduct an IF 
workshop to integrate WTO accession planning with Yemen\'s most 
significant economic planning document: the Poverty Reduction 
Strategy (PRS) for 2006-2010.  Until it is integrated into the 
PRS, WTO accession will remain an afterthought to those outside 
of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. 
 
4. The European Union is presently spending seven million Euros 
over five years to help Yemen accede by providing training, 
computers and technical advisors.  USG assistance compliments the 
EU assistance program and will likely focus on Customs Valuation 
reform and reforming Yemen\'s competition law. 
 
------------------- 
What Must Yemen do? 
------------------- 
 
5. The most significant step the ROYG will have to take is 
garnering Parliamentary support for several key legislative 
changes, to include: 
-- Upgrading IPR laws (septel); 
-- Redrafting the competition law to dilute the power of big 
companies; 
-- Revising a new commercial law that limits non-Yemenis to a 49 
percent share a company (septel); 
-- Opening the telecommunications and financial sectors\' and 
-- Amending provisions of the labor law that hinder private 
companies from hiring persons of their choice and limit the 
number of foreigners to 10 percent of total employment 
 
6. Aside from legal amendments, Yemen must also \"bind its tariff 
structure,\" and implement the General Investment Law of 2002 
which provides for equal treatment of foreigners and domestic 
investors and protects against nationalization. 
 
7.  Planning for WTO accession is beginning to gain momentum 
outside of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  The upcoming 
Trade Investment Framework Talks have encouraged Deputy Prime 
Minister Sofan to take up the trade reform and he is actively 
encouraging other ministries to adopt necessary changes for 
accession.  Most experts agree that WTO accession is \"stretching\" 
limited ROYG resources due to lack of well trained civil 
servants, limited English capacity, and coordination problems 
between ministries. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
Businessmen Hold Key to Success 
------------------------------- 
 
8. Yemen\'s powerful business community is fearful of accession 
and is capable of blocking necessary legislative reforms if they 
fear their business interests might be harmed.  In 2004, the 
Yemen Federation of Chambers of Commerce lobbied effectively to 
delay implementation of Yemen\'s General Sales Tax, designed to 
reduce Yemen\'s dependence on oil revenue for state income.  The 
government must also take significant steps to improve the 
investment climate for businessmen so they can see tangible 
benefits in joining international trade regimes.  The first 
priority for Yemen\'s business community is reducing smuggling. 
In some cases, as much as fifty to seventy percent of one market 
is dominated by smuggled goods and legitimate Yemeni business 
suffer.  If WTO accession and reduced smuggling can be linked, 
the business community may be swayed to support accession.

SUBJECT: Services in Yemen: Legally Open For Investment 
 
REF: SANAA 1763 
 
1. Summary and comment: Insurance, telecommunications and the 
banking industry are all possible fields for American investment 
in Yemen.  The insurance industry is steadily growing and open to 
investment.  With only 1.3 million fixed lines, potential exists 
for the telecommunications services to expand.  The banking 
industry is likely the least hospitable to foreign investors 
because Yemen\'s commercial courts are not able to ensure a sound 
investment climate.  Yemen\'s three main service industries are 
still plagued by government inefficiency and lack of qualified 
employees to carry out government\'s regulatory role. End summary 
and comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Insurance Industry: Open, but Few Are Willing to Risk It 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2. Insurance enterprises are subject to the Supervision and 
Control of Insurance Companies Law 37 of 1992.  In 1997, Law 9 
and Law 22 for Commercial Companies amended the law in accordance 
with the 1995 economic reform package.  Twelve insurance 
companies operate in Yemen and a thirteenth is applying for a 
license to issue health insurance.  Insurance companies must have 
100 million Riyals (550,000 USD) to begin operation.   Current 
amendments under consideration would raise the minimum to 400 
million Riyals (2.2 million USD).  The most common type of 
insurance in Yemen is life and fire.  According to the Ministry 
of Industry and Trade (MIT) officials who regulate the insurance, 
the industry is steadily growing in Yemen. 
 
3. A ministerial decision by MIT can suspend a company\'s 
activities for less than a year if the company fails to show 
their records and documents for review.  The company can appeal 
to the court in order to plea against the suspension decision, 
although Post is unaware of any suspension orders issued by MIT. 
MIT also reviews annual reports of all insurance companies, 
although with only three inspectors their capacity is limited. 
For an insurance company to open, the company must deposit ten 
percent of the capital with MIT, an exception may be granted if 
the company seeks to invest its capital outside of the ministry. 
Foreign companies are allowed to own up to 25 percent of a local 
insurance company, although presently foreign investors only own 
about ten percent of any insurance company operating in Yemen 
 
4. A draft law at the ministry would allow foreign companies to 
own up to 49 percent of an insurance company.  According to 
existing laws, foreign companies are free to operate in the 
reinsurance sector, where companies act as a guarantee for 
smaller insurance companies.  No foreign companies are presently 
in the reinsurance business.  According to Law 37, a majority of 
the companies\' board of directors should be Yemeni nationals. 
Yemeni citizens cannot directly or indirectly insure any of their 
locally based property in any company outside the country, 
although the Minister of Industry and Trade may grant an 
exception. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Telecommunications: Potential For Growth 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. With 1.3 million fixed phone lines and 500,000 internet users 
the telecommunications industry in Yemen is steadily expanding. 
Teleyemen, the state monopoly operated by France Telecome, still 
controls domestic fixed and international lines and is investing 
in CDMA technology to expand rural use.  Two mobile operators 
exist in Yemen, and Yemen plans to issue a tender for a third 
license for a company this year, reftel.  Two state-run internet 
companies operate, and the ROYG is working to expand internet 
usage.  Foreign investment is allowed and occurs only in 
partnership with the government as in the case of the French 
operating alongside Teleyemen to operate.  To date, there are no 
plans to break-up the state monopoly. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Banks in Yemen: Serving the Rich 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. Eighteen banks currently operate in Yemen including the 
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY), which oversees banking regulation 
and currency exchange.  Of the eighteen banks, two are fully 
state-owned and two are partially state-owned.  Nine are private 
domestic banks (including four Islamic banks), and four are 
private foreign banks.  The largest bank operating in Yemen is 
the state-owned National Bank of Yemen, which is considered a 
prime candidate for privatization.  The three other state-owned 
banks are also being considered for unification under a World 
Bank reform program, with the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development likely to be next on the list.  While there is much 
talk about banking privatization, no progress has been made in 
the past few years. 
 
7. The average Yemeni does not have a bank account and relies on 
the Hawala (informal) system to transfer money to friends and 
relatives.  Central Bank officials estimate that only three 
percent of Yemenis have bank accounts and due to current economic 
constraints, rapid growth is unlikely.  Typically, Yemen\'s banks 
do not handle large transfers or have a wide customer base.  Due 
to the limited nature of domestic banks capabilities, small 
businessmen and women have difficulty obtaining loans if they do 
not know the owners of banks personally.  Banks are reluctant to 
loan money to those they do not know because they cannot resort 
to commercial courts to retrieve bad loans.  The locally owned 
banks cannot compete against the larger international or state- 
owned banks because they do not have the high-rate of 
capitalization to undergo such projects.  In the mid-90s, Yemen\'s 
commercial banks suffered from a large number of under performing 
loans, but an effort to reform the banking system has reduced the 
number of bad loans. 
 
8. American banking in Yemen ended with the closure of Citibank 
in 1984.  Today, the only large international banks operating in 
Yemen are Arab Bank and Credit Agrigcole S.A. (The two other 
foreign banks Rafadeen Bank (Iraq) and Gulf Bank).  Commercial 
Banks are allowed to purchase foreign exchange domestically from 
customers and tourists and to hold a percentage of foreign 
exchange purchased to effect import payments on behalf of the 
Central Bank.  There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or 
sales of foreign exchange.  Under Yemen\'s Investment Law, 
investors are permitted to hold foreign-currency accounts in 
Yemeni banks.  Commercial banks are authorized to open letters of 
credit for the importation of most goods, provided that such 
imports are self financing; these banks may accept licenses 
issued by MIT without approval from the central bank. 
 
9. Banks are subject to the Central Bank of Yemen organizing law, 
the Commercial Banks law and the Commercial Companies Law.  One 
group or investor may borrow fifteen percent of a bank\'s capital 
and twenty five percent of the banks assets may be liquid at any 
one time.  Out of concern for the lack of capitalization, the 
Central Bank Governor is proposing increasing the rate of 
capitalization to Six Billion Riyals -- approximately 30 million 
USD from 2 Billion Riyals or 10 million USD.  The Central Bank of 
Yemen does not insure individual\'s deposits in the banks they 
oversee. 
 
10. Commercial bankers complain that the Central Bank is more 
interested in maintaining a stable Riyal and does not promote 
open banking.  One example is that the highest currency is the 
1, 000 Riyal note (5.50 USD), harming cash flows and limiting the 
ATM machine capacity.  Yemen\'s Banking regulations also allow 
board of directors to take advantage of the bank\'s facilitations; 
use deposits and shares as long as they are decision makers. 
Confidence in the banking system is limited, and it is common for 
profits to be used to replenish deficits incurred by bad debts. 
 
11. Commercial bankers complain that the Central Bank is more 
interested in maintaining a stable Riyal than working to expand 
Yemen\'s banking capabilities.  The largest bill the Central Bank 
authorizes is the 1,000 Riyal note (5.50 USD), which harms cash 
flow and ATM capacity.  Confidence in the banking system is 
limited, and it is common for profits to be used to replenish 
deficits incurred by bad debts.  One possible area for USG 
assistance would be to strengthen the Central Bank\'s regulatory 
capacity and work to encourage policies that promote the 
stability and integrity of banking, such as establishing a 
deposit insurance.

Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  At November 1 meeting, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Dhabbi expressed concern that the US plans to join 
European missions in criticizing the ROYG publicly for the 
detention of journalist al-Khaiwani.  Ambassador responded 
that no such discussion had taken place and the US would not 
at this time comment on the case.  Ambassador confirmed that 
the US was following the case closely, and was concerned 
about its implications for freedom of the press.  Ambassador 
noted the larger context, specifically the ROYG\'s planned 
prisoner release during Ramadan.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Deputy Foreign Minister Dhabbi requested a meeting 
with Ambassador to deliver a message from President Saleh. 
Saleh was concerned, said the DFM, about the possibility that 
the US would join with the Europeans in criticizing the 
ROYG\'s conviction and imprisonment of \"as-Shura\" editor 
Abdulkarim al-Khaiwani (reftel).  Dhabbi met earlier the same 
day with three European Ambassadors who, according to the 
DFM, reported that a statement was \"still under discussion.\" 
 
3.  (C)  Ambassador told Dhabbi he had not yet been 
approached by European missions, and was not planning to 
speak out on the case at this time.  Nevertheless, he did not 
rule out such a move in the future.  He stressed that both 
the Embassy and Washington were following the Khaiwani case 
closely and were concerned about deteriorating press freedoms 
in Yemen.  Ambassador said the ROYG had been developing a 
good record in the region on press freedoms and expressed his 
hope that this did not represent a negative trend. 
 
4.  (C)  Dhabbi explained that Khaiwani was not in prison for 
exercising free speech but for provoking the rebellion of 
Al-Houthi in Sa\'ada, and for encouraging social and religious 
divisions in the country.  Yemen could not risk a threat to 
its unity as in 1994, said Dhabbi, and did not need the 
encouragement of any new forms of Islam.  Dhabbi also said 
that it was the courts which imprisoned Khaiwani and not the 
government.  He pointed to the behavior of the U.S. media 
during the war in Iraq, suggesting that the Yemeni press 
should also support its President during times of war. 
 
5.  (C) This case, Dhabbi claimed, has received undo 
attention because Khaiwani is a member of the media. 
Ambassador stressed that the US supports the unity of Yemen 
and its right to defend itself, but that there is a larger 
context.  The ROYG, said Ambassador, is currently weighing 
releasing security prisoners to which the US has serious 
objections.  The USG, he continued, is invested in the growth 
of democracy in Yemen and press freedoms are a big part of 
this effort.  Perhaps, said Ambassador, Khaiwani would be a 
more appropriate recipient of a compassionate release than 
the known al-Qaida associates currently on the list.

 1. (C) Summary: In a candid and wide ranging discussion on 
November 2, Deputy Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman advised 
Pol/Econ Chief and Deputy that Post should convey to 
high-level ROYG officials the perils of corruption.  Noman 
advised the Embassy to communicate to journalists and 
businessmen more about Yemen\'s scores on the Millennium 
Challenge Account, and underscore the USG\'s commitment to 
avoiding political choices and sticking to the indicators. 
Noman offered insights into the recent failure of the 
economic reform package and noted Parliament\'s frustration 
over progress by the government to address serious concerns 
about where the ROYG\'s budget is spent. End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
MCA: \"Tell Them How Bad We Are\" 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Noman called in Pol/Econ Chief and Deputy to discuss 
Yemen\'s Millennium Challenge Cooperation (MCC) threshold 
status.  Noting that Yemen\'s MCC scores are qat chew talk, he 
said that the journalists are questioning the U.S commitment 
to stick to the indicators.  In response to Pol/Econ Deputy 
affirming that the indicators are solid, Noman interjected 
\"tell them (the government) how bad we are doing.\"  Noman 
explained that several Presidential advisors focus on Yemen\'s 
positive scores in Economic Freedom.  According to Noman, the 
real message that Yemen is failing in the \"Governing Justly\" 
category and that corruption is rising is not reaching 
President Saleh.  Noman said the Embassy in Washington began 
discussions with the Mongolians to understand how they were 
able to qualify for MCC and said the ROYG is looking for best 
practices.  Noman urged Post to brief journalists and 
businessmen on MCA qualification and what reforms the ROYG 
needs to take to qualify. 
 
----------------------------- 
\"Corruption is the New Value\" 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Turning to corruption, Noman took note of Transparency 
International\'s new corruption index, where Yemen now ranks 
112 out of 145 countries and said, \"I\'m depressed.\" 
Characterizing corruption as spreading like \"fire,\" Noman 
said, \"corruption is the new value.\"  Pointing to three 
million dollar houses, Noman commented that some people 
question a persons\' intelligence if he works for the 
government and does not boast houses and a wealthy lifestyle. 
 Jalal Yaqoub at the Ministry of Planning told Pol/Econ 
Deputy that when the TPI scores came out, many in the Yemen 
government were actually pleased and believed the new scores 
more accurately reflect the situation. 
 
4. (C) Noman raised a critical letter to President Saleh that 
appeared briefly on the website \"Allaf\" (NFI) in Saudi Arabia 
from a Saudi businessmen complaining about tendering 
procedures in Yemen.  The letter described his attempt to 
secure a contract with a governor in Yemen, who asked for a 
40 percent cut of the project\'s profit.  Noman said that the 
letter was on the website at four pm on November 1, but taken 
off that same evening when he checked again.

Reform failed Because Government 
Placed Whole Burden On Poor 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Noman said he believes economic reform failed because 
the government did not explain to Parliamentarians what they 
were going to do with the money and placed the burden of 
reform on the poor.  Saying \"everyone knows we have to cut 
the subsidy,\" Noman reported that Parliamentarians complain 
that the Government was not taking commensurate cut backs on 
the reform package.  Noman noted real worries about the 
impact of the diesel subsidy reduction on Yemen\'s poor, but 
said Ba Jammal focused only on the economic benefits of 
diesel subsidy reduction and not where the money saved would 
be going or what the government itself was doing to reform. 
Noman said he was confident the reductions and economic 
reform would eventually pass and that Yemen faced a \"hard 
deadline\" on 
economic reform. 
 
6. (C) On the long-delayed tenders, Sofan said \"yes everyone 
thinks Siemens will win\" the  power contract, but Parliament 
will likely call corruption and make it the new Block 53, 
referring to Parliament\'s investigation into a corruption 
scandal. 
 
7. (C) Comment: Once again, DFM Noman proved to be one of 
posts\' most candid and pro-reform ROYG interlocutors.  Noman 
mentioned that he had been in his job at the Ministry for a 
year and signs of his frustration are evident.  Yemen\'s new 
corruption scores are likely more reflective of the current 
state of affairs in Yemen. Post is looking into ways to work 
with G-8 colleagues to create a consistent message (and 
perhaps a common plan) that the ROYG must deal with 
corruption in the coming years or risk Yemen\'s democratic and 
economic progress.  End comment.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, ETRD, YM, ECON/COM 
SUBJECT: CUSTOMS MAKING PROGRESS 
 
1. Summary: Yemen\'s existing customs and tariff schedule is 
calculated under the Brussels Definition of Value, which is not 
compliant with WTO standards.  As part of the ROYG\'s economic 
reform package, reductions to customs and tariffs are being 
considered, but further revisions will be required for full WTO 
compliance.  In 2003, imports of goods and services amounted to 
USD 4.561 billion.  The United States is the fourth biggest 
exporter, contributing 6.3 percent of total imports. The Customs 
Administration contributes 20 million USD annually to the ROYG\'s 
3 billion USD budget.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Customs Valuation Assistance Needed 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. Based on the Brussels Definition of Value, national tariffs 
use nomenclatures issued by the World Customs Organization (WCO) 
and the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System 
(HS1996). In other words, while international standards for 
coding goods are used, to comply with WTO standards Yemen still 
must adopt the GATT Agreement on Customs Valuation and 
restructure its customs fees.  As part of the ROYG\'s economic 
restructuring, tariff schedules were reduced in 
1995 and customs procedures streamlined. 
 
3. Customs duties are calculated according to C.I.F. (Customs 
Insurance and Freight) valuation for all imports on the date of 
the customs registry declaration. The tariff structure consists 
of ad-valorem duties of 5, 10, 15 and 25 percent on a total of 
6,237 items. Duties on most food products are levied at 15 
percent.  Fifty-one percent, or 3,134 items are subject to the 10 
percent tariff rate.  Yemen does not apply countervailing duties, 
anti-dumping duties and safeguard measures.  All goods and 
services are allowed for import into Yemen except those items 
deemed to conflict with Islamic guidelines, environmental 
interests, health, or national security. 
 
4. Car tariffs are currently at the highest band, 25 percent, and 
are one of the tariff reductions under Parliamentary 
consideration.  Foreign goods of any origin and source are 
allowed to transit the Aden Free Zone duty-free, but the 
transporter is charged a \"service fee\" for use of the Zone. 
Goods that enter Yemen from the Aden Free Zone are charged 
regular customs rates.  If a company is eligible for tax breaks 
under Yemen\'s General Investment Law, fisheries, livestock and 
agricultural productions inputs are exempted from customs duty. 
Production inputs on other projects are exempted for 50 percent 
of customs duty.  (Comment: Because implementation of the 
Investment Law is spotty at best, few companies have been able to 
take advantage of this credit. End comment.) 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Customs Making Steady Progress With ASYCUDA 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. In 2001, the Customs Authority (CA) installed the Automated 
System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA), financed by the U.K. and 
supervised by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD). The system aims at increasing revenue, reducing illegal 
trade, facilitating procedures, and enhancing transparency. Since 
installation, processing time at the entrances has been reduced 
from several days to 2-4 hours, smuggling illegal substances has 
become difficult, and importers report that they are more 
confident in the system\'s valuation credibility.  In 2004, CA 
began testing an electronic clearance processing service for the 
most trusted traders.  By 2005, all entry posts, including the 
Aden Free Zone, will use the electronic system. 
 
6. Yemen purchased a $ 23-million Container-Vehicle X-Ray System 
from China, and is installing the system at entry posts including 
the Aden Free Zone and Sanaa Airport.  The new system will be 
connected to ASYCUDA processing measures, and will assist in 
combating smuggling. 
 
----------------------------- 
Smuggling Undermines Progress 
----------------------------- 
 
7. Yemen\'s Industrialist Union estimates that 56 percent of all 
available goods in Yemen are smuggled -- a total loss of 133 
Billion Yemeni Riyals (720 million USD or 1/4 of total budget) to 
the public treasury.   Nearly one-fifth (YR 27bn) of all smuggled 
products pass through official entry posts, and the transit of 
such goods is likely facilitated by government employees. 
Businessmen cite smuggling as one of their greatest problems, and 
blame high customs and tariff rates and ineffective enforcement 
for exacerbating the problem.  In addition to the influx of 
smuggled goods, ROYG officials are increasingly concerned that 
foreign countries are dumping expired goods in Yemen.  Smuggled 
and \"dumped\" medicine is a particular concern because it is often 
exposed to extreme heat and unsanitary conditions, weakening or 
destroying its effectiveness. 
 
------------------ 
Dispute Resolution 
------------------ 
 
8. According to Yemen\'s Customs Law, if a dispute arises between 
the CA and a shipment owner, it must be referred within 8 days to 
two experts, one appointed by the authority and the other by the 
owner of the goods.  If both experts agree, their decision is 
final. If an agreement cannot be reached, an arbitration 
committee is formed consisting of a permanent representative of 
the Minister of Finance or two CA and Yemen Standards and 
Metrological Organization (YSMO) representatives.  The 
arbitration committee\'s decision is final and binding, and the 
losing party incurs the arbitration expenses.  (Comment: Most 
disputes are resolved privately and Post is unaware of frequent 
use of the arbitration option.  End comment.) 
 
------------------------------ 
Consumption or Value Added Tax 
------------------------------ 
9. A consumption tax or a value added tax (VAT) is levied on 
certain imported commodities, including those manufactured in the 
free zones.  Imports for domestic consumption are taxed at the 
same rate as locally produced goods..  The VAT varies according 
to product type. For various oil derivatives, for example, the 
tax ranges between 0.5 percent and 2 percent for each liter 
depending on price and quality.  For local and imported 
lubricants, however, the tax charged is a set 2 percent of price. 
Movie tickets and video sales and rentals are taxed at 15 
percent. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  Comment: Yemen\'s customs regime has the potential to raise 
revenue and reduce smuggling.  With a proven track record of 
reform, the Customs Administration could be a venue for future 
U.S. assistance.  MEPI and USAID are currently considering 
assistance for Yemen\'s customs valuation system.  Other needs 
include additional inspection equipment, training of agents and 
inspectors, and increased interagency cooperation.  End comment.

TAGS: ECON, EAGR, SENV, EWWT, YM, ENVIRONMENT/S&T 
SUBJECT: TOP 3 YEMEN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES: WATER, WATER, 
WATER 
 
1. Summary/comment.  Several critical environmental issues 
face Yemen: overgrazing, soil erosion, desertification, 
sandstorms and summer dust storms.  The most crucial issue, 
however, is the lack of potable water which affects the 
majority of Yemen\'s workers and future export sectors.  By 
most estimates, fresh water resources are expected to reach a 
crisis situation in the next five to ten years.  Without 
serious attention to declining water resources, Yemen will no 
longer be able to rely on agriculture as a primary source of 
employment.  End summary/comment. 
 
------------------------- 
WATER, WATER, ... NOWHERE 
------------------------- 
 
2. According to the World Bank, Yemen,s agricultural sector 
accounts for 21.6 percent of GDP, employs fifty percent of 
the workforce and could be considered as a potential sector 
for export growth.  The agricultural sector draws 
approximately 90 percent of the water resources.  Yemen 
boasts the highest fertility rate in the Middle East: 6.7 
children per woman.  Some international observers in Yemen 
believe the unofficial birthrate to be even higher and expect 
the population to double again in ten years.  This explosive 
growth rate, coupled with estimates of water withdrawals at 
approximately 125 percent of actual renewable water 
resources, creates a rapidly accelerating water crisis in the 
years to come. Ref A explains the water situation in the 
central city of Taiz. 
 
3. The water situation in Sanaa, while not as severe as in 
Taiz, also suffers from a low underground water basin.  One 
businessman mentioned that ten years ago, when he was 
building his house, the well he dug hit water 60 meters down. 
 In the last year, he dug 300 meters to reach underground 
water.  Municipal services in Sanaa, such as, water, 
electricity and sanitation do not connect to most homes with 
any consistency in frequency or coverage. 
 
------------------------------------ 
YEMEN,S ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN DETAIL 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. Yemen enacted the Environmental Protection Law under Law 
No. 26 in 1995.  This law established an environmental 
protection council to prepare a national policy for 
environment protection and to coordinate that policy with 
other relevant government bodies.  The law contained 
extensive provisions on the protection of water, soil and use 
of pesticides; regulation of environmentally damaging 
activities such as hazardous waste handling; and marine 
pollution.  On July 13, 2004 the Council of Ministers 
approved a significant by-law for the Ministry of Water and 
Environment, which now oversees the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA).  The regulations enhanced and strengthened the 
ministry\'s role in development of water resources and efforts 
at increasing strategic planning, international cooperation, 
and inter-agency cooperation.  At the same time, the by-law 
enacted measures to prevent the pollution of the environment 
and to ration, protect, and conserve natural resources. 
 
5. Yemen is party to the following international agreements: 
Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Environmental 
Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer 
Protection, and the Kyoto Protocol. 
 
6. Articles 6 through 14 of the comprehensive 1995 
Environmental Protection Law regulate the protection of 
water, soil and use of pesticides.  Article 9 prohibits any 
activity that directly or indirectly damages the soil or its 
fertility.  Article 14 prohibits any activity to the 
vegetation of any area that causes desertification.  This 
includes the cutting or removal of any forest tree, shrub or 
bush without permission from government authorities. 
 
7. Articles 15 through 21 regulate the handling and use of 
pesticides.  For instance, Article 17 provides for the 
registration period of any pesticide for a period of five 
years and extensions thereof.  Article 19 stipulates the 
conditions for storage and warehouse sites as \"far away\" from 
populated areas, commercial zones, or foodstuffs 
manufacturing. 
 
8. Articles 22 through 44 provide detailed guidelines for the 
control of environmentally damaging activities, environmental 
disasters, standards and licensing.  As to the handling of 
hazardous wastes and materials, Articles 45 to 55 specify 
such regulations as: the state shall bear the direct and 
indirect expenditures which arise from the measures to 
prevent improper disposal of hazardous waste. 
 
9. Articles 62 to 64 govern marine pollution issues and 
define the discharge of pollutants in the territorial waters, 
the continental shelf of the exclusive economic zone to be an 
offense. 
 
10. Articles 75 to 95 specify environmental damage 
violations, liability, punishment and compensation.  For 
example, Article 83 outlines the liability for environmental 
risk to correlate to compensations for damages that arise due 
to polluting materials and shall be applied according to the 
rules of Sharia Islamic law and others. 
 
11. As is with the case with many laws in Yemen, the Ministry 
and the EPA have solid legal grounds to carry out 
environmental policy.  Government agencies, however, suffer 
from poor central government support and inadequate budget 
resources for law and regulatory enforcement.   Examples of 
poor enforcement include the turtle poaching on the Indian 
Ocean coast, clear-cut forests and countless roads built 
without environmental impact statements and EPA coordination.

visited Khaiwani on Saturday 11/06 also told Pol/Econoff that 
Khaiwani,s condition is \"deteriorating.\"  Other sources note 
that his morale has reached an all time low, but believe his 
condition is \"non-life threatening.\" 
 
4. (U) Since 10/19 all journalists have been barred from 
visiting Khaiwani.  Prison authorities told representatives 
of the Yemeni Journalist Syndicate (YJS) that orders barring 
them from visitation came from, \"higher officials.\" (Note: No 
one is sure who exactly is barring the visits. End note.) 
 
5. (U) Reports are circulating around Sanaa that the European 
Union embassies plan to visit Khaiwani in prison as well as 
petition President Saleh for his release, (Ref C).  An EU 
diplomat close to the issue has told Pol/Econoff, however, 
that despite meetings, they still have not agreed to a common 
message to issue. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Ministers to Talk to Journalists Tonight 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The Ministers of Information and Interior will hold an 
Iftar dinner on 11/09 for all local editor-in-chiefs, 
selected correspondents and representatives of the YJS to 
discuss the Khaiwani case.  Most Journalists tell Pol/Econoff 
that they do not anticipate much from the meeting citing the 
ROYG\'s tendency to justify its actions rather than enter into 
a serious dialogue on the matter. 
 
-------------------------------- 
ROYG Ready to Tighten the Noose? 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) A Ministry of Information official confirmed to a 
leading journalist that the ROYG has indefinitely suspended 
issuing press licenses to new papers.  An independent 
journalist told Pol/Econoff that his colleagues believe that 
this is being done in anticipation of the ROYG,s effort to 
pass a new more restrictive press law.  Sources note that the 
law is being written \"behind closed doors\" and they expect 
the ROYG to railroad it through parliament.  (Note: To 
counter the new law some journalists have discussed drafting 
a bill themselves in order to lessen the anticipated blow. 
However, it does not appear that they will be able to garner 
enough support until after the Eid holidays.  End note). 
 
------------------------------- 
Comment: Case Too Close to Call 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Comment.  Despite increased local and international 
pressure, journalists are not sure at this time if the 
President will interfere in Khaiwani,s case and grant a 
Ramadan Amnesty.  Our own sources tell us Khaiwani\'s name is 
not on any list of detainees to be released.  Several 
journalists and attorneys close to the case agree that 
although Saleh has a heightened sensitivity to being called 
to the carpet on this case, he is taking the matter of a 
perceived slight by Khaiwani very personally.  As such, 
speculation is that Saleh will not bow to any pressure to 
release Khaiwani anytime soon.  End comment.

Classified By: RSO Tim Laas, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (S/NF) Begin Summary:  On October 26, 2004, the Chief Of 
Mission chaired a core Emergency Action Committee meeting 
with COM, DCM, ORCA, DATT, FPD, LEGAT, SOC-Yemen, OMC, CONS, 
POLECON, PDO and RSO in attendance.  The topic of discussion 
was the possible release of 138 prisoners from Republic of 
Yemen (ROYG) custody that has been held on various charges to 
include indigenous and transnational terrorism.  EAC members 
reviewed what if any negative impact such a release would 
have on the American community and the current security 
profile.  It was the consensus of EAC members that some of 
the prisoners on ROYG,s list were particularly dangerous and 
their release could seriously and negatively impact security. 
 No new security measures have been recommended.  End Summary. 
 
2. (S/NF) EAC members reviewed the security impact of the 
Republic of Yemen,s prisoner release program noting: 
-     The release could expose western personnel to terrorist 
acts perpetrated by released detainees who are angry over the 
perceived influence that the American government had 
regarding their length stay in prison and/or driven by 
extremist ideology. 
 
-     LEGAT listed several instances where Yemen detainees 
committed terrorist acts against American citizens and 
interests after being released. 
 
-     Terrorists planned attacks in 2002 and 2003 against 
American and British interests but were interdicted by ROYG 
and US counter-terrorism efforts. 
 
-     A warden message was determined to be appropriate with 
possible modifications to Yemen,s Travel Advisory. 
 
-     The initial stand-down of various US government 
programs outside of the capital city to lower the exposure of 
US citizen contractors in remote or isolated areas. 
 
-     RSO noted soft targets within Sanaa where NGO programs 
are concentrated but EAC members did not see an immediate 
threat in the capital city not requiring Sanaa based programs 
to scale back. 
 
-     Embassy officers are unable to verify who is actually 
detained and who is moving in and out of the penal system 
despite ROYG claims regarding specific detentions. 
 
-     Travel by USG personnel should continue to be reviewed 
by RSO prior to approval to better ensure proper security 
consideration in a changing security environment. 
 
 
3. (S/NF) The EAC had no specific threat information 
associated with the release of detainees. 
 
4.(S/NF) The COM advised the EAC that follow-on EAC meetings 
would be required as the security situation unfolded in light 
of ROYG decisions on prisoner releases. 
 
5. (S/NF) RSO met with the MOI Chief of Staff Brigadier 
General Sunidar following the meeting.  BG Sunidar confirmed 
ROYG deliberations to determine who would be among released 
detainees and assured RSO that past release programs were 
successful and did not result in any recidivism by &reformed 
and released8 detainees.  (RSO:  Comment USG statistics show 
that in fact released prisoners have in the past been 
involved in terrorism following their release by Yemen 
authorities. 
 
6. (S/NF) The Ambassador concluded the EAC meeting by 
stating that follow-up EAC meetings would be held as 
necessary to adjust security programs to the impact of any 
releases by ROYG and impact to bi-lateral relations by USG 
actions in light of the releases.  The COM directed the RSO 
to ensure visible security measures as appropriate to the 
current threat environment.

SUBJECT: TRANSPARENCY OF MILITARY SPENDING IN YEMEN 
 
REF: STATE 239929 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary.  According to the standards defined by the 
1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, the military 
budgets in Yemen is not transparent.  The MOD is not 
accountable to any civilian auditing authority, and has only 
limited control over revenues and expenditures within 
branches of its own administration.  Yemen faces significant 
security challenges which necessitate military spending.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
General Overview of Auditing Procedures 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  The Ministry of Defense presents a budget annually 
to the Ministry of Finance for approval.  MOF reviews the 
budget, as it does for all ministries, and allocates 
resources on a six-month basis.  Differences arising between 
ministries are resolved by the President\'s office.  Military 
expenditures are not subject to external audit.  Spending in 
each section of the MOD is monitored ad hoc by deputy 
ministers, and monitoring and enforcement falls to military 
intelligence.  Ultimately, responsibility for military 
spending resides with the MOD. 
 
3.  (SBU)  There is no legislation or official policy 
regarding audits of military expenditure.  The MOD is 
fiercely independent, and not subject to the same auditing 
rules as other ministries.  In some instances, the weak 
central government is unable to monitor military spending 
within its ranks, especially in remote regions, due to 
limited capacity.  In the case of the official budget, the 
absence of an auditing process is intentional.  Criticism of 
MOD spending is considered crossing a political red line. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
On-Budget and Off-Budget Revenues and Expenses 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4.  (SBU)  Yemen\'s defense budget does not include all ROYG 
security forces, some of which are located outside the MOD. 
There are considerable off-budget military receipts, which 
are not audited. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Comment:  The ROYG faces considerable challenges 
in both development and security.  There is cooperation 
between government ministries and donors to prioritize 
development objectives, with an understanding that security 
is fundamental to success in this effort.  Substantial 
military investment is necessary to provide the stability 
needed for broader growth.  Yemen is a partner in the Global 
War on Terrorism.  End Comment

1.  There have been no reports incidents of anti-Semitic acts 
against Jews or Jewish property in Yemen since July 1, 2003. 
 
2.  There are between two and three hundred Jews remaining in 
Yemen.  The ROYG issued a press release in June accusing Jews 
living in northern Yemen of backing the rebellion in Sa\'da 
(ref B).  The statement, carried by the local media, was 
retracted by the government shortly thereafter.  The Yemeni 
media is prone to conspiracy stories involving Jews and 
Israel.  For example, articles this month claimed that Israel 
was poisoning Yemenis through pesticides used on qat, a 
widely used narcotic. 
 
3.  All non-Muslims are banned from running for Parliament. 
This policy of the General Election Committee was reached 
after the ruling GPC party tried to run a Jewish candidate.

SUBJECT: VP HADI SHARES ROYG CONCERNS ABOUT ERITREA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski for reason 1.4 b and d. 
 
1. (C) Summary. Vice President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi 
convoked Ambassador on November 23 to express ROYG concerns 
over a November 21 exchange of gunfire between Yemeni troops 
and four suspected Eritrean military boats off the Yemeni 
Hunaish Islands.  Hadi pressed Ambassador for information on 
what the USG knew of the incident, and of a potential 
Eritrean military build-up off the Eritrean coast. 
Ambassador responded by stressing the importance of continued 
USG-ROYG military cooperation, and said that the USG would do 
all it could to maintain calm in the area.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On November 23 Ambassador, accompanied by DATT, COMC, 
and Pol/EconOff (notetaker) met with Yemeni Vice President 
Abu Rabbu Mansour Hadi at the Ministry of Defense.  Hadi 
expressed ROYG concern over a November 21 incident involving 
three to four small, unidentified military boats fired on by 
Yemeni troops as they approached the island of Greater 
Hunaish.  (Note: Yemen and Eritrea almost went to war over 
the Hunaish Islands in 1995.  The USG played a vital role in 
allaying tensions between the two nations. End Note). Hadi 
also said that one or two unidentified, military capable 
helicopters have twice approached the island since the 
incident.  He asked if the USG knew the identity of the 
helicopters and boats. (Note: Hadi expressed suspicion that 
one of the helicopters was on a French reconnaissance 
mission.  The French did not reply to a ROYG inquiry on the 
matter. End Note). 
 
3. (C) DATT told the VP that on November 22 he asked the 
Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) about 
the incident. CJTF-HOA confirmed that a French ship fifty 
kilometers north of the island aided a small Eritrean 
military boat with nine passengers on board.  The nine 
passengers, who requested water, food and fuel, admitted to 
stealing the boat from Eritrea, claiming they were destined 
for Saudi Arabia.  DATT said he too suspected the other boats 
were Eritrean, but could not confirm this.  There were no 
U.S. or Coalition reports of aircraft sighted in the vicinity 
of the Islands. 
 
4. (C) Hadi told Ambassador the ROYG was concerned about a 
suspected military build up of 10,000 troops at Ras Therma, 
Eritrea.  Ambassador replied that he had no knowledge of such 
a buildup, but that the USG would continue to focus on 
maintaining calm in the area.  Hadi emphasized the 
sensitivity of the Hunaish Islands to the ROYG.  The ROYG 
acted in full compliance with international law, said the VP, 
as well as with the utmost restraint.  Hadi expressed ROYG 
frustration with Eritrea\'s behavior, referring to it as a 
\"thawra\" (revolution) rather than \"dawla\" (country), \"They 
fight with everyone,\" he quipped. 
 
5. (C) Hadi attributed the ROYG,s ability to act with 
restraint to its military cooperation with the USG in the 
Bab-al-Mandab straits, confiding that the ROYG does not fully 
monitor its coast due to confidence in the U.S. presence in 
HOA.  He asked that the USG exert pressure on Eritrea to 
provide liaison officers to CJTF-HOA, and to act within 
internationally recognized standards.  Ambassador assured the 
VP that he would express his concerns to Washington and 
CJTF-HOA in Djibouti. 
 
6. (C) Comment: A plausible explanation for the incident is 
that the stolen military boat was being pursued by the 
Eritrean military, which therefore came close to the Hunaish 
Islands.  The meeting with Hadi, and particularly the urgency 
with which it was called, underscores the fragility of the 
ROYG\'s relations with Eritrea, and the mistrust that 
prevails.  End Comment.

1.  (S)  Summary.  Post believes that the 28 plus 2 Ramadan 
detainees who\'s release we objected to have been put on an 
\"extended hold\" pending transfer from PSO custody to that of 
the Attorney General (AG).  As of November 24, however, we 
have received no confirmation from the AG that the transfers 
have taken place.  The AG has officially requested the 
transfer of Jaber al-Banna and he believes it will happen 
soon.  Although the AG is not optimistic that the 
investigation of al-Banna will result in his prosecution, it 
does mean al-Banna will remain in custody for weeks or months 
while an FBI team is allowed to join the investigation.  Hadi 
Dulqum continues to be detained by the ROYG but no agreement 
has been reached on how to proceed in his case.  End Summary.

2.  (S)  Post has been told by MOI, NSB, and a contact close 
to President Saleh that a decision has been made to extended 
the deadline on the release of the 28 security detainees of 
concern to us, plus Jaber al-Banna and Hadi Dulqum. 
President Saleh has reportedly instructed that their release 
continue to be delayed pending further cooperation between 
the USG and the Yemeni Attorney General\'s office (OAG).

Jaber al-Banna

3. (S)  In a November 7 meeting with DCM and LEGATT, Deputy 
Attorney General Sharraf and Chief Prosecutor al-Alq declined 
an FBI invitation to travel to the U.S. to review al-Banna\'s 
case files, but invited FBI case agents to Sanaa to work 
directly with the Office of the Attorney General on Abdullah 
al-Rimi, a case the FBI has been waiting on for months, and 
al-Banna, pending confirmation of the transfer of the 
detainees from PSO to OAG.  The AG hinted that perhaps a deal 
could be arranged to hand over al-Banna if, during 
interrogation, he indicated that he preferred to go to the 
United States.  AG was quick to point out, however, that a 
deal of this sort would not be within his department but 
needed to be worked out with \"others.\"

Hadi Dulqum 
----------- 
 
4. (S)  Despite gaining incremental extensions on the 
detention of Hadi Dulqum, there is, as of yet, no agreement 
with the ROYG on a long-term solution to his case.  The ROYG 
still holds that the shared information on Dulqum is not 
sufficient to try him for any crime, and the PSO continues to 
insist it has no information to add.

\"publishing reports damaging to the public interests,\" and 
\"public humiliation of the President\" (ref A).  Both 
interlocutors expressed concern over the harm that Khaiwani\'s 
case was causing, noting the possible negative effect on 
Yemen\'s MCA scorecard.  They pointed out that Freedom 
House,s condemnation of the arrest and detention of Khaiwani 
was particularly alarming to the ROYG. 
 
------------------------------------- 
The straw that broke the camel,s back 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) The advisor informed Ambassador that the 
editor-in-chief was arrested because of a specific comment in 
one of his newspaper\'s op-ed pieces that stated \"any 
president who arises from the common people has no 
legitimacy.\"  Interlocutors furthered that Khaiwani\'s 
\"royalist, Hashimite leanings\" had been tolerated up to that 
point, but that Saleh considered the \"no legitimacy\" comment 
as going too far.  (Note: Although post has closely followed 
articles in Khaiwni\'s paper, we are unable to find this 
particular quote in print.  End note). 
 
4. (C) Ambassador informed interlocutors that the USG was 
increasingly concerned about reports of mistreatment and 
beatings of Khaiwani in prison, (ref B) and that speaking out 
publicly would have to be the next step (ref C).  Both noted 
that Khaiwani would not be exonerated or pardoned but 
released on parole. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
MOI promises to ease Khaiwani,s condition 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C)  Minister of Interior al-Alimi told Journalists at an 
iftar dinner on 11/09 that he would follow up on the case, 
and would assure that Khaiwani,s conditions of incarceration 
would be eased.  Nevertheless, two female journalists who 
disguised themselves as relatives in order to visit him in 
prison, reported, after Alimi\'s promise, that Khaiwani,s 
condition continues to deteriorate and that he is in pain 
from his last beating (ref B). (Note: There is a current ban 
on journalists visiting Khaiwani. End note). 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) It is unclear whether the actual comment referred to 
by these two closely connected officials was indeed the red 
line that caused Saleh to call for Khaiwani,s arrest; it was 
not cited in the numerous charges against him (ref A).  His 
arrest and continued imprisonment demonstrates that, despite 
Saleh\'s promises earlier this year to end imprisonment of 
journalists, the President has no intention to cease using 
the justice system against those whom he feels are attacking 
him.  On the positive side, interlocutors expressed concern 
about MCA funding in particular, indicating that the program 
does have the ability to affect the thinking of decision 
makers.  End Comment.

COUNTER TERRORISM-UNIT 
 
REF: STATE 242948 
 
Classified By: DCM Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.4 b and d. 
 
1.  (C)  This message is in response to reftel request for 
additional information on USG assistance for the Yemeni 
Central Security Forces for the purpose of assessing the best 
funding mechanism.  USG training for the CSF-CTU is an 
integral part of U.S.-ROYG cooperation in the GWOT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Central Security Forces Counter Terrorism Unit 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2.  (S)  The Yemeni Central Security Force (CSF) is a 
paramilitary counter-terrorism, emergency reaction, and 
counter-coup force that can provide reinforcement to the 
Yemeni armed forces.  Its primary missions are internal 
security and counter-terrorism operations.  Within the CSF, 
only the Counter-Terrorism Unit (CSF-CTU) is tasked with the 
primary domestic counter-terrorism mission; no CSF units 
conduct foreign internal defense.  The CSF-CTU does not 
expect to be used outside the territory or territorial waters 
of Yemen.  The CSF-CTU acknowledges that only the Yemeni 
Special Operations Forces (YSOF), who belong to the Ministry 
of Defense, will ever be used outside Yemen. 
 
-------------------- 
CSF-CTU Capabilities 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (S)  Current Country Team planning does not contemplate 
assistance to any part of the CSF, other than the CSF-CTU. 
Similarly, Post is not aware of, and advises against, any 
plans to assist any other parts of the CSF, other than the 
CSF-CTU. 
 
4.  (S)  According to a National Ground Intelligence Center 
(NGIC) assessment, conducted in 2002, the CSF contains 
approximately 20,000 members organized into two different 
types of battalion-sized organizations: Special Forces 
Battalions (Al-Quwat al Khasa) and Commando/Ranger Battalions 
(Quwat Al-Sai,qa).  The general number of personnel in each 
battalion varies from 450-750.  Each battalion possesses 
several pick-up-type trucks with a 12.7mm machine gun mounted 
on the back.  Each truck is crewed by six personnel. 
Individual weapons are the AK-47-type assault rifle and 9mm 
Markarov pistol.  The CSF-CTU is separate from these 
organizations, but does draw recruits/volunteers from them. 
The CSF-CTU has approximately 150 members, divided between 
three CT platoons and a small headquarters element.  The 
CSF-CTU is equipped in a similar manner to the rest of the 
CSF.  Expertise and demonstrated capability in hostage 
rescue, high-value target operations, close quarters battle 
and forced entry are what differentiates the CSF-CTU from its 
parent organization. 
 
------------------- 
Command and Control 
------------------- 
 
5.  (S)  The CSF falls under the authority of the Minister of 
Interior, Dr. Rashad al-Alimi.  The CSF Director is Brigadier 
General al-Tayyeb and the Chief of Staff is Colonel Yahya 
M.A. Saleh.  Colonel Yahya Saleh is the nephew of Yemeni 
President Ali Abdallah Saleh.  A ministerial-level committee 
comprised of the ministers of Interior, Defense, plus 
Military Intelligence and the director of the Political 
Security Organization (PSO) conducts planning for 
counter-terrorism operations.  Once a plan is created, it is 
given to the appropriate CSF unit for execution.  CSF units 
find it difficult to communicate operationally because their 
equipment lacks signal strength and the rough terrain limits 
their line of site (LOS) signal systems.  The CSF-CTU suffers 
from the same command control deficiencies as the generic 
CSF. CSF-CTU Command, Control and Communications (C3) 
deficiencies are excellent projects for future FMF, PKO or 
OGA funding. 
 
------------------------------------ 
CSF-CTU Training and Equipment Needs 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (S)  CSF training requirements for the period of FY 05-07 
are as follows: 
 
-- FY 05 training requirements:  One 4-man Counter-Terrorism 
Training Team from November 2004 until May 2005.  One 6-man 
Counter-Terrorism Training Team from May to September 2005. 
Emergency and Extraordinary Expense (EEE) funding has been 
approved by the SECDEF in the amounts of $250,000 for this 
11-month period. 
-- FY 06:  One 6-man Counter-Terrorism Training Team from 
October 2005 to September 2006. 
 
-- FY 07: One 6-man Counter-Terrorism Training Team from 
October 2006 to September 2007. 
 
7.  (S)  CSF Equipment requirements for FY 05-07:  OGA has 
been solely responsible for equipping the CSF-CTU up until 
very recently.  It is Embassy Sanaa,s understanding that OGA 
is reconsidering equipment expenditures for CSF for FY 2005 
and beyond.  As of September 04, 4.1 million USD of PKO funds 
have been approved and used to open a &pseudo8 FMS case to 
procure ambulances, mobile C2 vans and both armored and 
un-armored vans for the transportation of the CSF-CT Unit. 
Use of these PKO funds was considered and approved as a 
&one-time8 occurrence.  If, however, normal FMF is to be 
the principal vehicle used to fund the CSF-CTU in the future, 
and OGA funding is in doubt, it will be necessary to request 
that 4.5 million USD be budgeted/ear-marked for the CSF-CTU 
for both FY,s 06 and 07.  FY 06 funds would be used to 
procure secure, tactical communications equipment and 
additional armored vehicles; FY 07 funds would be used to 
procure a new Yemeni National Terrorism Coordination Center. 
If CSF-CTU funding requirements are not reflected in 
increased FMF budgets, a re-prioritization of FMF funding 
allocations will be required. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Prioritization of CSF-CTU Funding Requests 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (S)  The CSF-CTU should be considered as the co-priority 
for FMF funds, along with the Yemeni Coast Guard (YCG) and 
before the Yemen Army, Navy and Air Force.  Yemen has 
under-utilized its FMF budget for the past several years. 
Because FMF funds are &5-year8 money, this has resulted in 
an un-allocated amount between 14-17 million USD remaining 
unspent and currently available for reallocation to new 
projects such as the CSF-CTU.  Including the CSF-CTU in 
out-year FMF budgets will have a negligible effect on current 
or future, Yemen Army, Navy and Air Force budgets since the 
Yemen Ministry of Defense is extremely unsophisticated in its 
understanding and use of FMF.

1. (C) Summary.  DCM delivered ref A and B demarches on 
keeping weapons out of Sudan (ref A) and encouraging support 
for full participation in Iraqi elections to Deputy Foreign 
Minister Noman on December 1.  Pointing to President Saleh\'s 
on-again, off-again support for Coalition and IIG efforts, 
DCM pressed for a more consistent, positive ROYG support for 
the IIG and political process.  In response, Noman suggested 
that a phone call from Iraqi PM Allawi to President Saleh 
might break the ice between the two leaders.  On Sudan, Noman 
assured DCM that the ROYG has no plans to for a weapons deal 
with Khartoum.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
ROYG does not intend to sell weapons to Khartoum 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (C) DCM shared USG concerns over the flow of weapons to 
Sudan, particularly at a time when progress in Darfur is 
fragile and the Africa Union mission to stabilize western 
Sudan ongoing, (ref B).  Noman replied that in an effort to 
ease the crisis Yemen has frequent diplomatic contacts with 
Khartoum, but that the ROYG does not intend to supply weapons 
to any party in the conflict. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Saleh runs hot and cold on IIG... 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Pointing to President Saleh\'s recent and contradictory 
statements concerning the IIG and coalition efforts in Iraq, 
DCM said it was critical that the ROYG join its neighbors and 
G8 partners by showing consistent support for the political 
process and for January 30 elections, (ref A).  (Note: During 
his recent European tour, Saleh harshly criticized the 
assault on Fallujah calling it a \"massacre\" and a \"big 
mistake,\" and said the U.S. commitment to democracy is \"in 
word only.\"  In an interview only days later, however, the 
President touted Yemen\'s partnership in the GWOT.  On Iraq, 
Saleh stated his support for coalition efforts and even 
offered to help in keeping the election process on time.  End 
Note). 
 
------------------------------- 
...And all Politics is Personal 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Noman affirmed that the ROYG supported a peaceful 
transition.  DCM reflected that FM Zubari\'s visit to Sanaa 
took considerable groundwork but in the end was worthwhile. 
Noman suggested that an Allawi visit would be premature but 
that a phone call from the Iraqi PM reaching out to President 
Saleh might improve the President\'s tone.  \"Saleh has a 
personal dislike for the man,\" confided the DFM,  \"and 
everything for the President is personal.\"  DCM promised to 
share the idea with Washington and the IIG through their 
Embassy in Sanaa, adding that, personal feelings aside, it in 
the interest of all Iraqis, including Sunnis, and all 
regional players, including Yemen, to encourage the political 
process and timely elections in Iraq.

Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  President Saleh convoked Ambassador December 
6 to request that he convey Saleh\'s strong desire to visit 
Washington to personally congratulate President Bush on his 
reelection and meet with newly appointed senior officials. 
Citing important new developments in the region \"that can 
only be discussed face to face,\" Saleh said he also plans to 
raise U.S. - ROYG CT cooperation.  Saleh also discussed USG 
military assistance, SA/LW in Yemen, and the status of 
pending security detainee releases.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Saleh: I Must Meet the President Face to Face 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) President Saleh emphasized his desire to be among the 
first foreign leaders to personally congratulate President 
Bush on his reelection, and said he needed to meet with 
Secretary of State designate Dr. Rice and other newly 
 
SIPDIS 
appointed senior officials to raise new regional developments 
that can only be discussed \"face to face.\"  Ambassador 
promised to convey Saleh\'s message to the White House, 
cautioning that a visit could not be arranged before 
inauguration and all new cabinet posts had been filled and 
confirmed.  Only then would we be able to discuss the 
possibility of a Saleh visit to D.C. 
 
3. (S) True to form, Saleh launched into a list of what he 
believes the U.S. owes him.  \"Where is the money for the 
Army, and what about my spare (F-5) parts?\" Saleh demanded. 
Ambassador promise to follow up on this matter.  (Note: OMC 
reports difficulties in getting MOD to follow through with 
the necessary paperwork on parts and equipment in order to 
spend the 17 million USD in Yemen\'s FMF account.  End Note.) 
 
----------------- 
Controlling SA/LW 
----------------- 
 
4. (S)  Pointing out that any meetings with senior U.S. 
officials would quickly turn to the subject of Yemen\'s huge 
grey market in SA/LW, Ambassador told Saleh that Yemen needs 
to gain control over the huge flow of these weapons in and 
through the country.  Washington is very concerned about this 
issue and ready to help the ROYG tackle it, added Ambassador. 
 \"I will do it!\" Saleh exclaimed, insisting that he was 
already \"cracking down\" on the SA/LWs market.  The President 
pointed to the MANPADS buyback program, saying that he had 
made the hard and  \"right\" decision, over MOD objections, to 
include in the buyback program all ROYG-recovered MANPADS, 
including those systems the MOD wanted to retain for its own 
arsenal. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Ramadan Releases: \"We are Waiting for You\" 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (S) Saleh raised the 28 security detainees, meant to be 
released in the Ramadan amnesty, who the ROYG has agreed to 
continue to hold based on USG objections.  Saleh told 
Ambassador that the 28 were arrested under suspicion of AQ 
membership, having returned to Yemen from Saudi Arabia or 
Afghanistan, but that after investigation there was no 
evidence they were involved in terrorist acts.  \"We are 
waiting for information from you,\" said Saleh.  Ambassador 
replied that we had already provided all the information 
currently available.  The problem, said Ambassador, is 
continued ROYG refusal to exchange information.  Ambassador 
reiterated that we have asked repeatedly for the evidence 
that led the ROYG to conclude these 28 should be released. 
Surely there must be case files, transcripts of interviews, 
investigation notes, pressed Ambassador, yet the ROYG 
maintains it has no information on these suspects. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Hadi Dulqum: \"The Saudis are Crazy for him\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (S)  Saleh stuck to his line that Hadi Dulqum is just a 
\"simple arms dealer.\"  The Saudis want Dulqum, said the 
President, \"they are crazy for him.  What do you expect?\" he 
asked, \"if we arrest every arms dealer in the country,  we 
will have hundreds of them in prison.\"  The USG agrees with 
the Saudis, said Ambassador, adding that Dulqum\'s connections 
with AQ are too extensive for him to be simply another Yemeni 
arms dealer.  Saleh offered to conduct joint interrogations 
of Dulqum with the USG and said he would instruct the PSO to 
share its files on Dulqum.  (Note:  This is the third time 
Saleh has made such a promise.  The PSO continues to insist 
it has no information on Dulqum.  End Note.) 
 
7. (S) Comment: Saleh gave no indication that the 28 would be 
released soon, but he is clearly under considerable pressure 
to do so.  His acute awareness of the Saudi position on 
Dulqum, (which previously senior ROYG officials have 
dismissed as not credible) indicates the Saudis have 
approached him, directly or indirectly, on the matter. 
 
8. (C) Comment Continued.  Saleh wants to visit Washington 
and meet with President Bush and senior USG officials 
annually.  To the extent we can offer bilateral meetings with 
senior officials here in Sanaa, elsewhere in the region, or 
even D.C., we should consider it, but an official visit to 
Washington so soon after Sea Island should wait until we have 
resolved to our satisfaction the prisoner release issue, and 
have renewed Yemeni commitment on counter-terrorism.  End 
Comment.

1.1.  (S/NF) Begin Summary:  On December 6, 2004, the Chief 
Of Mission chaired a core Emergency Action Committee meeting 
with COM, DCM, POLMIL, DATT, FPD, LEGAT, SOC-Yemen, OMC, 
CONS, POLECON, PDO and RSO in attendance.  The topic of 
discussion was security conditions for the American community 
in Yemen following the attack on the American Consulate in 
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.  The Political Military Office briefed 
members on the incident and reported no specific threat 
against Americans in Yemen.  The RSO briefed the EAC on 
current security activities intended to thwart a similar 
attack in Sanaa.  After a review of security, EAC members 
recommended no change in current security policy and measures 
following regional incidents.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (S/NF)  EAC members reviewed current security conditions 
and measures as follows: 
 
-  The RSO briefed EAC members on security at the Chancery 
noting that American Embassy Sanaa: It was note that American 
Embassy Sanaa utilizes a vehicle trap and pedestrian trap at 
both compound gates and at the Embassy entrance; Both 
perimeter vehicle gates utilize a double Delta barrier system 
at each gate and two ram-resistant electric sliding 
vehicles/anti-personnel gates.  No perimeter gate, vehicle or 
pedestrian gate is open unless the other one is closed, 
insuring a trap to prevent intrusion.  Additionally perimeter 
gates are fortified by hardened bullet resistant guard 
booths; MSG,s standing guard orders require immediate lock 
down from Post 1 of any entrance that experiences an 
incident; For the Chancery building, RSO has had one entrance 
permanently locked down since 2002, operating only one 
entrance to concentrate access security screening at that 
point reducing the possibility of an intrusion; and finally 
the Chancery entrance utilizes a personnel trap. 
 
-  EAC reviewed the integrity of Embassy walls.  RSO advised 
EAC members that during past reviews of this wall it was 
determined that the structure utilized anti-ram knee walls 
and were of a design that would be very difficult to breach 
with even multiple attacks due to the collapse of debris. 
 
- The EAC reviewed procedures that will be followed by this 
community after any report of an incident regionally that may 
have ramifications for the security of the community in 
Sanaa.  The EAC noted that the COM had decided not to change 
the security profile following today\'s incident in SA, i.e. 
he did not call for a standfast of community members. 
However, EAC members with the COM concurrence agreed that in 
future incidents such as seen in SA, an EAC meeting would be 
convened immediately to gather all sources of information and 
make a determination as to whether to standfast, request 
additional Yemen government support or take other appropriate 
action. 
 
-  POLMIL advised EAC members that no specific information 
exists which would indicate a possible attack/specific threat 
against the American community in Sanaa.  POLMIL noted 
possible surveillance in Jeddah prior to this attack and also 
discussed the possibility that the attack was in retaliation 
for a recent success by SA forces against a terrorist 
safehouse. 
 
-  RSO noted one surveillance incident within the past ninety 
days against the Hadda Apartment Compound.  The MOI advised 
RSO that the vehicle use to conduct the possible incident was 
owned by a Tunisian diplomat who is believed to have left 
town as part of a permanent change of duty station, but left 
the vehicle with unknown persons to sell the car.  MOI found 
the current owner of the vehicle but assessed that the owner 
was not the surveillant and was not a threat to the American 
community. 
 
-  RSO informed EAC members about a security review conducted 
with all RSO program team leaders of their programs to 
include the Marine Security Guard Detachment, LGF, 
Surveillance Detection Team and RSO Investigators as well as 
ROYG perimeter security commanders.  Team chiefs reviewed 
lessons learned from the incident in Jeddah in an attempt to 
ensure proper conduct of policies and procedures as well as 
proper function of all physical security equipment.   The 
review mentally walked team chiefs through attack scenarios 
and should bolster perimeter security and internal defense 
reactions in the event of a serious incident. 
 
-  The EAC was advised by the COM that RSO would conduct an 
intruder drill within the Embassy compound this week during 
hours of operation.   It was noted that an intruder drill had 
not been conducted with Embassy personnel for several months. 
 
 
-  RSO advised EAC members that an internal warden meeting 
would be held on 7 December 2004 for Embassy wardens to 
review all emergency scenarios. 
 
-  EAC members discussed the likelihood that multiple attacks 
could occur in the region as has been seen in the past. 
 
-  COM mission asked RSO to pass lessons learned from the 
Jeddah incident to MOI during his weekly meeting with the 
Chief of Staff and the Embassy\'s ROYG security commanders 
from Central Security Organization as well as the Political 
Security Organization.   Lessons learned include the 
terrorists use of official uniforms and police vehicles to 
surreptitious enter security perimeters.  (RSO Comment:  ROYG 
vehicles are not allowed onto the Embassy compound and ROYG 
officials do not carry weapons onto the compound when 
entering the Embassy perimeter.) 
 
-  COM instructed section chiefs to allow their staff to 
stagger their arrival times to prevent bottle necking at the 
Embassy perimeter gate where vehicle inspections are held. 
In 2003 RSO moved the inspection point further from the 
public street with a lower profile, putting one layer of ROYG 
security personnel between the screened vehicle and the 
public and providing better concealment from the street. 
 
-  RSO agreed to pass the concerns of EAC members to MOI 
regarding a key choke point (traffic circle) down from the 
Embassy. 
 
-  The EAC directed the RSO to put out a security advisory 
reminding community members about best practices when 
commuting and a note on participating in the weekly radio 
check conducted by Post 1. 
 
-  EAC asked the RSO for an update on routes used by the 
community shuttle.  The RSO discussed vehicle with the EAC 
ensuring members that his last review of routes was as of the 
last week in November and that review showed a good variation 
of both COM motorcade routes and community shuttle routes. 
Additionally, EAC members were advised that RSO recently 
reconfirmed with the motorpool supervisor that armored 
vehicles must be utilized for transporting American Embassy 
officers in clusters.  (RSO Comment:  Locking devices are 
becoming problematic on Embassy armored vehicles and GSO has 
vehicle repair parts on order.) 
 
-  The COM directed the Management Office to update the 
Telephone Tree.   (RSO Note:  The Radio Emergency and 
Evacuation network, by far the best method of emergency 
communications has serious problems with transmissions within 
Sanaa\'s mountainous terrain, and has been extremely stilted 
due to ROYG unwillingness to cooperate with the Embassy in 
the upgrade of current networks, not allowing the Embassy to 
purchase additional frequencies and install new repeaters in 
strategic locations.) 
 
-  The GSO briefed EAC members on the status of the armored 
vehicle fleet. 
 
3.  (U) The EAC had no specific threat information regarding 
Yemen at the time of the meeting and no public warden message

1. (C) Summary. Assistant Attorney General (AAG) Sharaf 
al-Mahbashi told Legatt on 10/06 that the Limburg appeal 
began with arguments from the first eight appellees, that 
briefs have been submitted to Court of Appeals in the Cole 
case although the court has not yet set a date to hear 
arguments, and that the AG\'s office has still not received 
the case file on U.S. fugitive Jabar Al-Banna. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) In a 12/06 meeting AAG Sharaf Addin Al-Mahbashi shared 
with Legatt and FPD details of the appeals in the M.V. 
Limburg and Cole cases (ref. A, B) as well as on the status 
of Yemeni detainee and U.S. fugitive, Jabar al-Banna. 
 
-------------- 
Limburg Appeal 
-------------- 
 
3. (U) According to AAG Mahbashi, eight of the fifteen 
appellees presented oral arguments to a three-judge panel in 
the Court of Appeals on 12/04.  Mahbashi noted that the eight 
appellees, arguments were the same. They presented 
confessions to their crimes, which were also written, signed 
and sealed with a fingerprint, coupled with a plea for mercy 
and request for a reduction in sentence. All appellees also 
assured the court that they would not be repeat offenders. 
The prosecution retorted in all eight cases, asking that the 
court raise the sentences to the maximum the law allows. 
(ref. b). Mahbashi anticipates that the panel will likely 
uphold the sentences as they stand. End Note. 
 
4. (U) The eight Appellees who presented oral arguments on 
12/04 were: 
 
-- Omer Sa\'id Jarallah (ten years for the 2002 attack on the 
MV Limburg) 
 
-- Mohammed al-Ammari (ten years for the 2002 attack on the 
MV Limburg) 
 
-- Fawzi al-Wajih (ten years for the 2002 attack on the MV 
Limburg) 
 
-- Ibrahim al-Howeid (five years for plotting to attack 
foreign embassies in Sana\'a and for planning to kill the U.S. 
Ambassador to Yemen) 
 
-- Qassem al-Rayni (five years for plotting to attack foreign 
embassies in Sana\'a and for planning to kill the U.S. 
Ambassador to Yemen) 
 
-- Abdul-Ghani Dhayfan (five years for plotting to attack 
foreign embassies in Sana\'a and for planning to kill the U.S. 
Ambassador to Yemen) 
 
-- Mohammed Ali al-Daylami (five years for plotting to attack 
foreign embassies in Sana\'a and for planning to kill the U.S. 
Ambassador to Yemen) 
 
-- Kahled al-Juloab (three years for forging documents) 
 
 
5. (C) The AAG presented copies of the confessions, which 
were read verbatim to the panel, but would not hand over 
copies to Legatt, promising to do so only after all the 
appeals were completed.  He said the confessions were 
detailed and \"completely\" in line with the crimes that each 
Appellee was charged with.  The AAG affirmed that he was 
pleased with the outcome of the case, particularly after the 
12/04 hearing, adding that he will make every effort to see 
that the court sentence the remaining five defendants to the 
maximum sentence allowed by Yemeni law. 
 
6. (C) Both media and family members were present during the 
Appeals Court session.  Mahbashi described the feeling in the 
court chamber as subdued and speculated that the family 
members present, who created substantial commotion during the 
initial trial, now realized that the charges against the 
defendants were true.  (Ref A).  No date has been set for the 
remaining appellees but Mahbashi assured that the process 
will move along and promised to keep Post updated. 
 
----------- 
Cole Appeal 
----------- 
 
7. (C) On the Cole Appeal, (ref. B) AAG noted that the four 
appellees have submitted their briefs to the Court of Appeals 
but that his office was still not informed of a date to 
present oral arguments. 
 
-------------- 
Jabar Al-Banna 
-------------- 
 
8. (C) Finally, Mahbashi affirmed that the case files of 
Jabar Al-Banna has not been handed over to the AG,s office 
for investigation.  He also said that he did not anticipate 
any movement on the file until the end of the year. 
 
 
9. (C) Legatt reiterated his offer to bring case agents with 
knowledge on Al-Banna to Yemen to help the AG,s office in 
developing a case.  Mahbashi replied that there was no need 
for any assistance until the file was turned over to the AG\'s 
office and case had been reviewed.

SHEIKH AL-AHMAR 
 
Classified By: DCM Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary.  Ambassador paid a courtesy call on Speaker 
of Parliament and head of the Islah opposition party Abdullah 
al-Ahmar on December 11.  Al-Ahmar refused to address 
pressing domestic issues, including much-needed economic 
reforms, Parliament\'s agenda, and Islah\'s political agenda, 
instead insisting that the Palestine and Iraq are \"the 
biggest and most important\" issues facing the Yemeni People. 
 
2.  (C)  The 71-year-old leader of the Hashid tribal 
federation, the largest and most powerful northern federation 
of which Saleh is a member, appeared relatively well, having 
just returned to Sanaa after almost a yearlong absence from 
the scene for medical treatment.  Ambassador asked the Sheikh 
for his views on pressing economic reforms, issues before 
Parliament, and for his thoughts on how Yemen could most 
benefit from U.S. cooperation and assistance.  Al-Ahmar 
preferred to discuss regional issues, characterizing 
U.S.-ROYG relations as \"good\" but, as for the Yemeni people, 
\"their most important concern is the Palestinian problem,\" 
and they blame the U.S. 
 
3. (C)  Ambassador said the U.S. is fully committed to a two 
state solution and resumption of the peace process, adding 
that it is difficult to believe that the biggest problem 
facing the average Yemeni citizen is the situation in 
Palestine.  \"It is,\" relied al-Ahmar, \"and it is the reason 
for terrorism.\" 
 
4. (C) Ambassador raised President Saleh\'s BMENA 
participation and the ROYG\'s commitment to regional 
leadership on democratic reform.  Not taking the bait, 
al-Ahmar replied that the friendliness of Arab leaders toward 
the United States is not genuine but based on their fear of 
American power.  Ambassador asked the Sheikh if that was true 
for Yemen.  \"Its true for all Arab Governments,\" replied the 
Sheikh, \"except maybe Jordan,\" which is a U.S.-British 
creation.  Al-Ahmar conceded that the U.S. can play a 
positive role in Yemen through economic aid, but advised that 
a change in regional policy would go much further with the 
street.  \"It is better to gain the respect of the people than 
that of their rulers,\" he said. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) Al-Ahmar appeared well, putting to rest numerous 
rumors circulated about supposed amputations and dire health. 
 His posture at the start of the meeting was stiff, but 
loosened up as it went on.  He stressed at the end that 
despite his criticisms, s he favored a dynamic dialogue with 
the USG.  Al-Ahmar is more a tribal leader and entrenched 
member of the Yemeni Establishment than Parliamentarian or 
opposition figure.  He is a major stakeholder in the status 
quo, an importer of arms, and a leader in the oil and gas 
services industry; his leadership of the Islamic opposition, 
perhaps by design, practically ensures that Parliamentary 
challenges to the Executive as well as his party\'s agenda 
will be measured and limited.  End Comment.

2. (C) Noman said he received the same demarche from the 
Dutch December 13.  The DFM confided that he agreed with the 
USG position on both the Canadian-sponsored Third Committee 
Resolution (ref B), as well as to abstain on a no action 
motion in the Plenary (ref A).  Noman said he would lobby the 
ROYG to abstain, but could not promise results. 
 
2. (C) Deputy FM Noman said he had fought against Yemen\'s 
decision to switch its usual Third Committee vote from 
abstention to a \'no\' vote in the 2003 and again this year, 
arguing that it was inconsistent with Yemen\'s position on 
human rights.  Noman claimed he did not know the reason for 
the change in policy, but that the decision to vote against 
the resolution was made jointly by Foreign Minister al-Qirbi 
and Prime Minister Bajammal. 
 
3. (SBU) What Noman referred to as a \"change in policy\" from 
previous votes may be overstating the case.  In the 56th 
UNGA, Yemen did not actually abstain but was \'absent\' from 
the Third Committee vote and on the Turkmenistan and Iran 
votes the ROYG \'refused to vote,\' stating that 
\"politicization of human rights issues, using them as a tool 
to target specific States while ignoring others\" is rejected 
by Yemen as a double standard.\"

SUBJECT: AL-JAZEERA TV PROGRAM: \"THE UNTOLD WAR STORY\" - 
YEMENI-U.S. COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION 
 
 
1. SUMMARY:  Al-Jazeera TV broadcast a documentary on 
Thursday, December 9, 2004, titled \"The Untold War Story\" 
addressing the impact and repercussions of U.S.-Yemeni 
counterterrorism cooperation at the economic, social and 
political levels.  The documentary included impressions 
from a wide variety of Yemeni officials. Al-Jazeera, 
although fairly critical of American policy in the Middle 
East, appeared to be more balanced than usual in its 
assessment of the U.S. counter-terrorism effort in the 
region. END SUMMARY 
 
2.  INTRODUCTION:  The program opened with the U.S.S Cole 
bombing of October 2000, which killed 17 U.S. sailors, as 
well as the court sentences passed recently against those 
responsible for the attack.  It noted U.S. \"pressure\" on 
Yemen to postpone the trial a number of times.  Lawyer 
and human rights activist, Badr Basunaid, spoke of the 
trial as a \"black mark\" on Yemen\'s human rights record 
that he said the Americans would one day note in their 
human rights reports.  He slammed the Americans for what 
he called \"taking part in faulty court proceedings.\" 
 
3.  U.S./YEMENI RELATIONS/COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION: 
Al-Jazeera touched on U.S.-Yemeni relations which 
\"stagnated\" following 9/11, because of \"unlimited U.S. 
demands on Yemen\" with regard to the U.S.S Cole; due to 
Yemen\'s reservations on the case; and Yemen\'s stance 
towards Iraq and Palestine \"with which the U.S. was 
unsatisfied.\" 
 
4.  RELATIONSHIP TO AL-QAEDA:  The program showed footage 
of Bin Laden\'s birthplace in Hadhramout and showed how 
\"Yemenis\" constituted a key element within al-Qaeda 
making it (Yemen) a possible U.S. target after 9/11. 
\"Yemen was labeled after 9/11 as a dangerous country and 
a source of threat to America\'s national security\" 
analyst al-Sabri said.  An excerpt of a speech made by 
Shura Council Chairman Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani was played 
in which Abdul-Ghani pointed out that \"President Saleh\'s 
visit to Washington on November 24, 2001 was a turning 
point in U.S.-Yemeni relationships, as the outcome of the 
visit completely changed the whole situation.\" 
 
5.  MILITARY COOPERATION:  One part of the documentary 
highlighted U.S. military support to Yemen in terms of 
training and equipment.  \"We feel in Yemen that the 
number of people trained is not sufficient, as Yemen 
needs more training to protect all of Yemen, not only the 
capital and its surroundings,\" Foreign Minister al-Qirbi 
said.  Al-Jazeera then showed a statement by former U.S. 
State Department Spokesman-at-Large Phillip Reeker, who 
met with Yemeni media representatives during a non- 
official visit to Yemen in November 2003, declaring that 
\"the primary responsibility (to protect Yemen) is Yemen\'s 
and the U.S. will offer as much help as it can.\" 
Political analyst Al-Sabri criticized the U.S.-Yemeni 
anti-terror cooperation, which he said, \"is a war that 
protects the interests of others and not Yemen\'s, even if 
Yemen claims otherwise.\" 
 
6.  ECONOMY:  Aden Governor Yehya al-Shu\'aibi indicated 
that Yemen\'s economic situation is improving and is 
\"slowly\" restoring pre-Limburg bombing levels. 
 
7.  DIALOGUE:  Unfavorable views were expressed in the 
program concerning the government\'s theological dialogue 
with extremists and al-Qaeda prisoners.   Several 
commentators also expressed frustration with the 
practicalities of the dialogue program. 
 
8.  WAR ON TERROR RESULTS:  The program highlighted that 
Yemen\'s cooperation with the U.S. war against terror has 
resulted in: 
 
- The arrest of \"dozens\" of people including some of the 
Afghan Arabs. 
- Government clamping down on mosques, traders, religious 
schools and money transactions. 
- Confrontations between the government and tribes, 
between al-Qaeda and the government, and between the 
government and opposition parties, leading subsequently 
to a possible \"split\" in national unity. 
- Deteriorating government-tribe relations and resentment 
about U.S. Embassy contacts with tribes.  In this part, 
Speaker of Parliament Shaikh Al-Ahmar was shown in an old 
interview criticizing former U.S. Ambassador Edmund 
Hull\'s meetings with tribal sheikhs and his visits to 
certain areas in Yemen which al-Ahmar called, \"a breach 
of norms agreed upon by countries . and which no 
ambassador has the right to do.\" 
 
On one hand, a number of the interviewees held the view 
that the war on terror harmed Yemen\'s security and 
generated a situation worse than what had been hoped for. 
On the other hand, some believed that an indication of 
the success of the anti-war terror is that it has put al- 
Qa\'eda on the defensive. 
 
9.  MULTIPLE VIEWS:  It is interesting to note that the 
program showed both accusations and counter-accusations, 
such as:  the YSP accusing the government of having used 
terrorists to get rid of its rivals (before and during 
the 1994 war); the government (Prime Minister Bajamal) 
accusing the opposition of supporting terror cells 
responsible for the murder of former YSP senior figure 
Jarallah Omar and murder of the three U.S. medics in 
Jiblah; and government-reformed figures accusing former 
YSP figures - currently holding government positions - of 
encouraging the government to attack, in the name of the 
War on Terror, those (Arab Afghans) who had sided with 
the government forces in its war in 1994 against the 
YSP\'s secession plans. 
 
10.  CONCLUSION:   The program concluded with footage of 
Yemeni Special Forces maneuvers, with the presenter\'s 
voice citing Yemenis\' \"fears\" that the War on Terror (in 
Yemen) might be endless given the secrecy of U.S. demands 
from Yemen in this regard.

TAGS: ECON, ETRD, PGOV, YM, ECON/COM 
SUBJECT: DPM SOFAN SEEKS U.S. POLITICAL COMMITMENT FOR 
YEMEN\'S WTO ACCESSION 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary. Deputy PM and Minister of Planning and 
International Cooperation Ahmed Sofan reviewed development 
cooperation and sought strong political support for Yemen\'s 
WTO accession bid from visiting Deputy Assistant Secretary 
Philo Dibble on December 15.  Sofan complained of a lack of 
Saudi-Yemeni economic cooperation, affirmed the importance of 
economic reform, and said that WTO accession was the key to 
expanding direct foreign investment in Yemen. End summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Sofan: Security Costs Money, Economy Down 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) After praising U.S.- Yemen development cooperation, 
Sofan raised what is becoming a persistent theme among senior 
ROYG officials -- enhancing security to fight the GWOT costs 
money and development funding suffers.  Sofan blamed high 
inflation in Yemen and large budget deficits on the necessity 
to fund two Ministries, Interior and Defense, in order to 
meet Yemen\'s security requirements.  (Note: Yemen\'s inflation 
problems are not merely a result of military spending, Yemen 
is very susceptible to international price fluctuations 
because 76 percent of its food is imported.  For instance, 
last year bread prices doubled due to high international 
demand for wheat.) 
 
3. (SBU) \"Yemen needs U.S. advice and cooperation,\" said 
Sofan, \"but the challenges are great.\"  Highlighting Yemen\'s 
development needs, Sofan claimed that Yemen receives only 30 
USD per capita in development assistance, whereas Egypt 
receives 1,200 USD and Zambia 120 USD.  Warning that Yemen\'s 
budget deficit is growing, and this year will surpass last 
year\'s deficit of just around 3 percent of GDP, Sofan claimed 
that high oil prices are not enough to cover Yemen\'s costs. 
(Note: Most experts predict a steady decline in oil 
production and revenue in the next five years.  End Note.) 
Sofan told DAS that the only way to address high poverty and 
a 31 percent unemployment rate is to move ahead with economic 
reform and reduce subsidies. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Riding on the Thobe-tails of Saudi Arabia 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Sofan explained recent Yemen forays to expand Yemen 
- Saudi economic cooperation, sharing that the ROYG had 
presented a paper to the Saudis outlining suggested 
investment packages, alternative work sectors for Yemeni 
laborers, and turning Yemen into an open market for Saudi 
investment.  Sofan said he traveled to Riyadh seeking 
economic assistance and argued that regional stability will 
be greatly enhanced by a prosperous Yemen.  Expressing 
concern for the many Yemeni workers who are losing jobs due 
to Saudiazation, Sofan said he proposed Yemen and KSA work 
together to find alternative jobs for Yemeni guest workers. 
KSA promised to \"study\" the proposal, but Sofan said that 
since the offer was made five months ago, the ROYG has heard 
nothing. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Sofan on WTO Accession: \"Run Don\'t Walk\" 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU)  Sofan petitioned for the USG to give Yemen the same 
attention and commitments on WTO accession as Iraq, and for 
Yemen to be included in a \"fast-track initiative\" on 
accession.  Sofan suggested that if the U.S. wants the Middle 
East to prosper, economic support must extend beyond Iraq and 
asked for a \"political commitment\" from the United States to 
speed Yemen\'s accession through the WTO.  (Note: Post is 
unaware of an Iraq \"fast track\" initiative on WTO accession. 
End Note.) 
 
6. (SBU) Sofan pointed to WTO accession as a way to attract 
foreign direct investment. Admitting that the government has 
not explained its WTO accession plan well internally, Sofan 
said the ROYG will hold workshops to help Parliamentarians 
understand the meaning and benefits of accession.  Sofan 
added that Yemen\'s private sector is not as advanced as other 
countries\' and therefore not pushing for accession.  Sofan 
said that he has urged the Minister of Industry and Trade to 
\"run not walk to accession.\"  In addition to political 
support, Sofan asked for technical assistance, as was offered 
on the margins of the November 18 Trade Investment Framework 
Agreements (TIFA) Talks at USTR in Washington. 
 
-------------------------- 
Sofan Raising Expectations 
-------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  Following TIFA talks last month, Sofan 
seems heavily engaged in Yemen\'s WTO accession and is pushing 
the rest of the ROYG to follow suit.  His appeal for USG 
political support at Geneva, suggests that Sofan sees WTO 
accession as a political, rather than a practical and 
technical challenge.  However, Yemen still has much to do on 
the technical side.  It must redraft laws, gain Parliamentary 
approval and prepare its offers on key WTO areas such as 
telecommunications, insurance and banking services.  Sofan 
sees WTO accession as a step to a coveted Free Trade 
Agreement.  End comment.

SUBJECT: YEMEN BIOSAFETY STATUS - CARTAGENA PROTOCOL ON 
BIOSAFETY, ROUND TWO 
 
REF: SECSTATE 259661 
 
1. Ref A asked posts to help identify a small number of 
countries in order to engage them in more detailed bilateral 
discussions over the coming months over issues related to the 
Cartagena Protocol.  Since the conclusion of the February 
2004 First Meeting of Parties (MOP-1) to the Cartagena 
Protocol on Biosafety, the ROYG has not enacted or initiated 
any new laws, regulations or practices regarding US 
agricultural and living modified organisms (LMO) trade. 
 
2. A draft law banning LMO products was introduced by the 
Cabinet over a year ago.  After consideration, the Cabinet 
decided to send the draft law to the Yemen Standardization, 
Metrology and Quality Control Organization (YSMQCO), a 
regulatory agency comprised of agricultural, meteorological 
and other scientists.  The YSMQCO recommended banning LMO 
agricultural imports and sent this recommendation to the 
Minister of Industry and Trade, Dr. Khaled Rajeh Sheikh. 
Minister Sheikh froze the draft law until further study could 
be made.  YSMQCO Vice Director General Ahmed Al-Bashah noted 
that the ROYG would like to observe the experiences of other 
Arab countries and coordinate with them on these biosafety 
issues.  (Comment: Post believes Minister Sheikh is sitting 
on the recommendation as he does not want to stifle trade 
relations or bring greater attention to this matter with 
prominent countries who trade LMO products.  End Comment) 
 
3. Discussion on LMO issues continues through the ROYG 
interagency Biosafety Committee.  Mr. Al-Bashah cited ongoing 
and sporadic press coverage of the anticipated dangers of 
genetically modified organism (GMO) products.  While GMO 
policy formulation is in its infancy in Yemen, the USDA 
Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) has actively supported the 
ROYG\'s ongoing efforts on this issue. 
 
4. In early December 2004, ATO sponsored the travel of two 
standardization working level officials to Cairo for a LMO 
Middle Eastern forum for discussions with 14 Middle Eastern 
and North African government officials including Yemen 
represented by Al-Bashah.  Al-Bashah said he appreciated 
hearing about his colleagues\' work on LMO regulations and 
would use this knowledge as a resource for Yemen\'s biosafety 
policy making.  He specifically cited the experience of the 
Gulf countries, Egypt, and Jordan as examples. 
 
5. Overall, Yemen continues to tread water on LMO issues 
while its decisionmakers await further guidance from 
countries in the region and more input from interlocutors 
such the U.S.

Terrorist Attacks and Prosecutions 
---------------------------------- 
 
There were no reported terrorist attacks against Westerners 
in Yemen in 2004.  An economically motivated kidnapping of 
five oil workers, including one western national occurred on 
August 31 in the Ma\'rib Governorate.  The incident was 
resolved in a matter of hours without injuries or deaths, 
following intervention by the local authorities.  All 
indications point toward this kidnapping being economically 
motivated and not a terrorist incident.  The hostages were 
employees of the Omani oil drilling company that had 
previously employed members of the tribe responsible for the 
kidnapping. 
 
The Republic of Yemen Government continued to cooperate with 
U.S. law enforcement and took action against al-Qaida and 
local extremists in 2004 by arresting several individuals 
suspected of having al-Qaida ties.  Most notable, however, 
was the government\'s prosecution of the perpetrators of 
several terrorist acts.  Two terrorism-related prosecutions 
were conducted in 2004. 
 
On August 28 the Sanaa Primary Court convicted 14 al-Qaida 
associates in one trial for various terrorism related 
charges.  Convictions were handed down for the following 
crimes:  the October 2002 attack on the French tanker the V/M 
Limburg; the murder of a Ministry of Interior officer during 
the November 2002 attack on an oil company helicopter, a plot 
to attack the Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority; a 
plot to attack four foreign embassies in Sanaa and to kill 
the U.S. Ambassador; and, for forging documents for the 
purpose of carrying out terrorism.  Two defendants received 
death sentences, one in absentia.  The other defendants were 
sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to ten years. 
Under Yemeni law, both defendants and the prosecution have 
the right to appeal rulings.  The defendants have all 
appealed their sentences, as has the prosecution.  The latter 
arguing that some of the sentences were too light.  The 
appeals process is expected to conclude in early 2005. 
 
On September 10 the Sanaa Primary Court concluded the trial 
of five defendants for the October 12, 2000 attack on the USS 
COLE in Aden that killed 17 U.S. sailors and injured 35.  On 
September 29, the court issued two death sentences for the 
ringleaders of the bombing.  Three others were convicted and 
sentenced to prison terms ranging from five to ten years for 
their roles in the attack.  This case is also currently under 
appeal. 
 
In both terrorism trials, the USG was able to assist in the 
prosecution by assuming the victims, families, right under 
Yemeni law to participate on behalf of the families.  The 
Yemeni Attorney General,s office cooperated extensively with 
the USG under this provision of the law and ensured that 
adequate evidence was collected against all the defendants. 
 
The Yemeni Supreme Court heard appeals on the death sentences 
of Abed Abdulrazak al-Kamel and Ali Ahmed Mohamed Jarallah 
for the December 30, 2002 shootings of three American 
citizens in Jibla.  No final decision has been issued on 
al-Kamel,s case.  Court officials expect that the conviction 
will be upheld and passed to President Saleh, who they 
believe is likely to sign the order to carry out the 
sentence.  Post representatives attended al-Kamel,s trial 
and appeal proceedings, which were relatively transparent and 
openly reported in the local media. 
 
Security and CT Cooperation 
--------------------------- 
 
Yemen publicly expresses its support for the global war on 
terrorism. In meetings with senior U.S. officials, President 
Saleh underscores Yemen,s determination to be an active 
counterterrorism partner.  Work remains to be done to improve 
Yemen\'s counterterrorism capabilities and to increase border 
security.  Yemen attended the IISS Gulf Security Dialogue 
Conference in Bahrain in December 2004 during which the 
participants agreed to increase regional counter terrorism 
cooperation. 
 
Over the past year, Yemen has increased its maritime security 
capabilities.  The USG provided extensive training and eight 
boats to the Yemeni Coast Guard, which is now a visible 
patrolling force along the coastline and may well become a 
model for other Horn of Africa nations.  The Coast Guard is a 
long way from having the skill, technology, equipment and 
training to maintain a continuous patrolling presence along 
the entire maritime border, or even to continually cover 
potential hot spots.  Yemen has expressed a willingness to 
fight international terrorists by denying them the use of its 
territorial seas and ports.  It is expanding Coast Guard 
operations to stem the use of Yemen as a &way station8 for 
smuggling of persons, drugs, weapons and explosives.    This 
effort remains constrained by a lack of capacity, capability, 
and financial support. 
 
Land border security along Yemen\'s extensive frontier with 
Saudi Arabia remains a major concern.  In February, Yemen and 
Saudi Arabia agreed to bolster cooperation in order to combat 
cross border arms and persons smuggling.  The two countries 
also agreed to establish joint patrols and increase 
monitoring.  In November 2004, Yemen and Saudi Arabia began 
looking at joint military exercises and ways to expand border 
checkpoints, but this cooperation is still in the discussion 
stage and much work remains to be done to expand the 
relationship.  The Ministry of Defense is exploring the 
possibility of extending command control and communications 
links to the Saudi border.  In 2003, in keeping with a 
bilateral security agreement, Sanaa and Riyadh exchanged 
prisoners and terror suspects, including the handing over by 
Yemen of an individual on the Saudi\'s most-wanted list. 
Although there are reports that the two governments are 
arranging another prisoner exchange, this has not occurred as 
of December 2004. 
 
The Yemeni Central Security Force-Counter Terrorism Unit 
(CSF-CTU) has greatly improved its CT capabilities as a 
direct result of US assistance and training.  Yemen also 
continues to cooperate with the USG under its Terrorist 
Interdiction Program, designed to ensure cooperation between 
ministries to strengthen military capabilities and tighten 
border posts and checkpoints in tribal and border areas.  The 
program is currently enjoying limited success as a result of 
U.S. aid. 
 
In 2004, the government\'s capacity for stemming terrorism 
financing remained limited.  In February, the United Nations 
Sanctions Committee designated prominent Yemeni Sheikh and 
opposition Islah party leader Abdul Majid al-Zindani as a 
person who provides material support to al-Qaida.  Despite 
repeated requests, the Yemeni government has taken no action 
to freeze his assets in compliance with their UN obligations. 
 Zindani continues to appear prominently at public events. 
 
There were no reported arrests by Yemeni authorities of any 
high-profile al-Qaida associates in 2004. 
 
In November 2003 authorities arrested Muhammad Hamdi al-Ahdal 
(a.k.a. Abu Asim al-Makki) who supported mujahedin and 
terrorist operations throughout the Middle East and in 
Chechnya.  He remains in custody. 
 
In 2003 authorities arrested al-Qaida operative Fawaz 
al-Rabi\'ea (a.k.a. Furqan) and al-Qaida associate Hadi 
Dulqum.  Al-Rabi\'ea was sentenced to ten years in the M/V 
Limburg trial for plotting to attack the Civil Aviation and 
Meteorology Authority.  Hadi Dulqum remains in detention.  In 
2003 the Yemeni government also apprehended suspected 
al-Qaida associate Jabber al-Banna who has an outstanding 
Federal indictment as well as an Interpol warrant for 
providing &material support8 to terrorism related to the 
&Lackawana Six8 terrorist cell in Buffalo, New York.  He 
also remains in custody. 
 
In March 10 Yemeni authorities apprehended USS Cole bombing 
suspects who had escaped from an Aden prison in April 2003. 
Of those that were recaptured, Jamal al-Badawi and Fahad 
al-Quso have both been tried convicted, their cases are 
currently on appeal. 
 
In August 2002 Yemen formed the Islamic Dialogue Committee 
headed by a leading judge.  In 2004 the committee continued 
its dialogue with detainees arrested for connection to 
terrorist groups and extremist elements, including many 
Yemeni returnees from Afghanistan.  According to the Ministry 
of Interior, before detainees are released they are screened 
by Yemen,s Political Security Organization, and make 
commitments to uphold the Yemeni constitution and laws, the 
rights of non-Muslims, and the inviolability of foreign 
interests.  In a 2004 Ramadan Amnesty the government released 
over one hundred security detainees claiming they had been 
rehabilitated. 
 
In June, the Ministry of Vice and Religious Guidance 
sponsored the first \"Guidance Conference,\" bringing together 
more than 270 Muslim clerics from across the Middle East to 
promote moderate and tolerant aspects of Islam.  The 
conference dealt with several issues including the 
differentiation between terrorism and legitimate struggle. 
The conference concluded with five primary recommendations to 
combat extremism in Islam. 
 
Several terrorist organizations continued to maintain a 
presence in Yemen throughout 2004.  HAMAS and Palestinian 
Islamic Jihad (PIJ) are recognized as legal organizations and 
HAMAS maintains offices in Yemen.  Neither organization has 
engaged in any known terrorist activities in Yemen, and PIJ 
does not have any known operational presence.  HAMAS conducts 
extensive fundraising through mosques and other charitable 
organizations throughout the country.  While al-Qaida 
operational structure in Yemen has been weakened and 
dispersed, concerns remain about attempts to reconstitute 
operational cells in Yemen 
 
Other international terrorist groups with a presence in Yemen 
include remnants of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al-Gama,a 
al-Islamiyya. Despite a major offensive by the Yemen 
government in 2003, the Aden Abyan Islamic Army also 
maintains a presence in the country. 
 
Yemen is a party to eight of the 12 international conventions 
and protocols relating to terrorism.

submission to the annual terrorism report.  The text of the 
report and the addendum have also been forwarded to CT POCs 
via e-mail.  Report sent septel. 
 
The M/V Limburg Trial 
--------------------- 
 
2. For more detailed information on the M/V Limburg trial see 
refs B and C.  Details of convictions as follows: 
 
-- Omer Sa\'id Jarallah, Fawzi al-Hababi, Mohammed al-Ammari, 
Fawzi al-Wajid Yasser Ali al-Madani were sentence to ten 
years in prison for their role in the 2002 attack on the 
French tanker the M/V Limburg. 
 
-- Fawza al-Rabi\'ea and Abu Bakr al-Rabi\'ea were sentence to 
ten years in prison for plotting to attack the Civil Aviation 
and Meteorology Authority. 
 
-- Ibrahim al-Howeid, Aref Saleh Mujalli, Mohammed Ali 
al-Daylami, Qassem al-Rayni, and Abdul-Ghani Dhayfan were 
sentenced to five years in prison for plotting to attack 
foreign embassies in Sanaa and to kill the U.S. Ambassador to 
Yemen. 
 
-- Salim al-Dulaymi and Khalid al-Juloab were sentence to 
three years in prison for forging documents for the purpose 
of carrying out terrorist attacks. 
 
-- Hizam Mujallad was sentence to death for the killing of a 
Ministry of Interior police officer while fleeing the attack 
on a Hunt Oil helicopter. 
 
The USS Cole Trial 
------------------ 
 
3. For more detailed information on the USS Cole trial see 
ref D.  The FBI provided the Attorney General\'s office with 
extensive case and DNA evidence to assure that the ROYG has 
all information required for prosecution, and assisted with 
courtroom security.  Details of convictions as follows: 
 
-- Ring leaders Jamal Badawi and Abd al-Rahim Nashiri (in 
absentia) received death sentences. 
 
-- Fahd al-Quso was sentence to ten years in prison for 
involvement in planning the attack. 
 
-- Ali Muhammed al-Murrakkab and Murad al-Surouri received 
were sentence to five years in prison for indirect 
involvement in planning the attack. 
 
-- Mamoun al-Mussawah was sentence to 8 years in prison for 
planning the attack. 
 
Jabber al-Banna 
--------------- 
 
4. Al-Banna is a dual U.S. - Yemeni national.  Despite 
Post,s continued calls for his extradition to the U.S., the 
ROYG maintains that it is constitutionally precluded from 
allowing it.  Post continues to work for his extradition. 
 
Response of Judicial System to Terrorism 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. The judicial system is slow and prosecution of terrorism 
cases is conducted on an ad-hoc basis.  The judicial system 
is subject to frequent interference by the Executive Branch. 
There is no term for terrorism under Yemeni law and CT 
related cases are prosecuted in the same manner as all 
criminal cases, with the exception that they are tried in a 
special penal court for \"public danger.8  There are reports 
that the Ministry of Interior is authoring a new Terrorism 
Law, but it has yet to be considered by Parliament. 
 
Major Impediments to Prosecution 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. On paper the Attorney General\'s Office (AG) is the primary 
investigative body.  In practice, the Ministry of Interior\'s 
(MOI) Political Security Organization (PSO)  conducts a 
\"mirror process\" and like the AG\'s office, the PSO has its 
own detention and investigation procedures.  PSO holds 
suspects indefinitely, whereas the AG must make a case 
against an individual or release him within 180 days. There 
is little or no cooperation between the PSO and the AG and 
often the cases of terror suspects are passed to the AG from 
the PSO to make a determination on prosecution without the 
sharing of any case evident. 
 
Extradition and assistance to U.S, requests 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7. It is extremely difficult to extradite a suspect with 
Yemeni citizenship.  The Yemeni Constitution specifically 
prohibits extradition.  Negotiations are currently under way 
between the ROYG and USG redress the situation. 
 
Use of intelligence in investigation 
------------------------------------ 
 
8. It appears that the Cole and Limburg trials were conducted 
without the use of intelligence, although the suspects were 
in PSO custody prior to trial.  There are no restrictions on 
wiretapping and interception of communication. 
 
ROYG efforts to investigate terrorism 
------------------------------------- 
 
9. A new unit was created in the Ministry of Interior to 
investigate terrorism in November of this year.  Post does 
not know yet if this unit will be effective.  LEGATT has 
requested to establish a cooperative relationship with the 
new unit. 
 
Insurgency not related to GWOT 
------------------------------ 
 
10. From June until early September, the ROYG Military and 
the Central Security Forces (CSF) were engaged in an 
increasingly bloody effort to put down an uprising in the 
Northern region of Sa\'ada.  The insurgency was led by 
anti-American Shi\'ite cleric Hussein Badr al Dein al-Houthi. 
Several hundred died on each side before the conflict ended 
September 10 with the fatal shooting of al-Houthi by Yemeni 
forces CSF attempting to capture him.

SUBJECT: DAS DIBBLE MEETINGS WITH ROYG MINISTERS: YEMEN 
NEEDS MORE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE

Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Ambassador and Visiting NEA/ARPI Deputy 
Assistant Secretary Philo Dibble met separately with Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Qirbi, Minister of Interior Alimi, and 
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Sofan on 
December 15.  The Ministers worked from the same talking 
points: thank you for U.S. security and development 
assistance -- but we need more, disappointed with lack of 
assistance from GCC countries-- please help, and, we want 
economic and security cooperation from Saudis -- they are 
your friends, talk to them.  DAS\'s discussion with Sofan on 
TIFA talks and WTO accession covered in ref A.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) On December 15 Ambassador and visiting NEA/ARPI DAS 
met separately with FM Abubakr Abdullah al-Qirbi, Interior 
Minister Rashad Mohammed al-Alimi, and Deputy Prime Minister 
and Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Ahmed 
Sofan.  In addition to appeals for increased USG security and 
development assistance, discussion focused on reaching MCA, 
results of the BMENA Forum for the Future, financial and 
political pressures on reform, joint CT efforts, combating 
SA/LW smuggling, and security detainees. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Appreciate US Support, Need More 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) DAS thanked all three interlocutors for Yemen\'s 
partnership in the GWOT, emphasizing that there was still 
room for the relationship to be closer.  He pointed to the 
December 6 attack in Jeddah, saying it clearly illustrates 
the importance of continuing and strengthening US - Yemen CT 
cooperation.  The Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Planning 
agreed that security was paramount, however expensive, and 
therefore development in Yemen was suffering.  Predictably, 
the Minister of Interior complained that he was forced to 
compete for funds with much needed development programs, such 
as the President\'s initiative to alleviate poverty. 
 
4. (C) Alimi expressed his gratitude for USG security 
assistance, pointing to the creation and ongoing training of 
the Coast Guard, and the training and equipping of the 
Central Security Forces Counter-Terrorism Unit (CSF-CTU). 
The positive results of our security cooperation, Alimi told 
DAS, are \"widespread\" but we need greater assistance, 
particularly for the CSF-CTU (ref B). 
 
5. (C) Qirbi told DAS that the ROYG had made great strides in 
fighting terrorism in Yemen and in dealing with AQ, but 
\"a\'-Qaida is not the end of the road.  There will always be 
more groups,\" said the FM, segueing into an appeal for 
increased US economic and development aid to combat the root 
causes of terrorism.  DAS agreed that the CT struggle has 
several dimensions, emphasizing that security is essential as 
the threat is now.  The other dimensions -- fighting 
extremism through democratic reform and economic development 
-- go hand in hand with security efforts.  Combating 
terrorism by changing political, social and economic 
conditions in the region is a long term endeavor, he told the 
FM, and we continue to look for ways to address this. 
Passing from threshold to MCC status is an important 
opportunity.  The ROYG should not miss out on it, DAS 
advised, by failing to significantly address the issues of 
rule of law and corruption. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Forum for the Future: Get Serious, Widen the Tent 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
6. (C) FM Qirbi shared his impressions of the FfF meeting in 
Rabat, saying that the meeting was important, but too short. 
He criticized \"some Arab states\" for neglecting to tackle 
substantive issues, saying that the Forum was in danger of 
becoming an arena for states in the region to defend their 
reform records instead of formulating next steps.  Qirbi 
suggested that membership be expanded to include problem 
states such as Somalia and Sudan.  \"Participation is better 
than exclusion,\" he said, adding that he was pleased to see 
Syria was there.  DAS agreed the FfF needed more meat, saying 
that he hoped the next meeting in Bahrain would produce more 
tangible results.  DAS said he understands there is suspicion 
among participants as to US and G-8 motives, however, the 
Forum is designed to be a mechanism for us to work together 
to promote your own reform initiatives. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Qirbi: I Want My Democracy Center 
--------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) As expected, Qirbi made a plug for the creation of a 
democracy center in Sanaa to support the BMENA Democracy 
Assistance Dialogue (DAD).  (Note: Qirbi is keen to establish 
a permanent DAD body -- complete with secretariat, a concept 
not supported by the USG and Italy.  End Note.)  The Foreign 
Minister said that Italy and Turkey are \"at a loss\" for who 
will pay for the center, claiming that \"if DAD is not 
supported by an organization, it will be a waste of time.\" 
Qirbi said he had talked with NDI and other US NGOs regarding 
the project.  DAS responded that we are still examining the 
follow-up on various FfF issues, including this one, and 
pointed to MEPI as a possible avenue. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Regional Cooperation, Need Your Help... 
--------------------------------------- 
8. (C) Qirbi, Alimi, and Sofan all raised the need for GCC 
countries to step up assistance to Yemen.  The FM and 
Minister of Planning pressed for US help in persuading Gulf 
states to provide more economic and development aid (ref A). 
\"If we are to move forward with economic reforms,\" said 
Sofan, \"we need a cushion to allay the fears of the Yemeni 
people that they will suffer.\"  (Comment:  President Saleh 
recently undertook a fund-raising tour of Europe and some 
Gulf states and is clearly disappointed with the results. 
End Comment.) 
 
9. (C) Alimi briefed DAS on his participation in the IISS GCC 
Regional Security Conference in Bahrain earlier this month 
and requested that the US lobby GCC members to provide 
security assistance to Yemen.  He said that the Bahrain 
conference was a positive development that should be built 
upon.  Alimi said that participants made a commitment to 
regional cooperation in the GWOT, and understands that the 
fight against terrorism cannot be won unilaterally, 
nevertheless, he complained, GCC security aid to Yemen has 
not been forthcoming. 
 
------------------------------- 
...Particularly with the Saudis 
------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Moving from the GCC in general to Saudi Arabia, all 
three Ministers said that the KSA was not being as helpful as 
it should.  A prosperous Yemen is in our neighbor\'s interest, 
said all three interlocutors.  Sofan pointed to specific 
proposals he had made to the Saudis to alleviate the negative 
effect of Saudiazation on Yemeni guest laborers and to 
increase Saudi investment in Yemen.  Sofan complained that 
the Saudis never responded to these proposals. 
 
11. (C) Alimi also lamented about the lack of Saudi 
cooperation in the realm of stemming SA/LWs smuggling across 
the Saudi-Yemeni border.  \"We made two proposals to the 
Saudis,\" he reported, \"assist the ROYG to purchase weapons 
and explosives from private hands and arms dealers in tribal 
areas near the Saudi-Yemen border, and finance the creation 
of a MOI border security force.  I made these proposals to 
Prince Nayef and he was enthusiastic,\" said Alimi, but that 
was two years ago and still nothing. \"You are our friends, 
and the Saudis are your friends,\" said Alimi, \"Maybe you 
could talk to them?\"  The Minister of Interior suggested 
establishing a US-Saudi-Yemen dialogue on Saudi-Yemeni 
security cooperation, DAS promised to explore the idea. 
 
--------------------------- 
Iran and the Future of Iraq 
--------------------------- 
 
12. (C) DAS raised US concerns on Iran with Foreign Minister 
Qirbi.  Iran has strategic interests to promote, he relayed, 
and it chooses to do so in a way that does not enhance 
stability in the region.  Qirbi said Iranian-Yemeni relations 
are good, but that unfortunately, Teheran is unpredictable. 
The FM said that Iran believes upcoming Iraqi elections will 
serve its interests due to the Shia majority, and that it 
expects to forge closer relations with the new Iraqi 
government.  Shi\'ites within Iraq are also concerned about 
Iranian influence, Qirbi added, because they have a secular 
component they want to preserve.  Qirbi said many in the 
region see the Iraqi elections as an end, rather than a means 
to produce a stable, united Iraq and eliminate violence and 
terrorism.  \"If they can create stability internally,\" he 
said, \"then the home grown elements of the insurgency should 
die away.\"  A long time advocate of Democratic reform in 
Yemen, Qirbi said that Arab governments have a responsibility 
to \"help the IIG ensure real elections occur and real 
democracy is established in Iraq.\"  \"The US presence in Iraq 
will be short,\" he said, \"five to ten years, but in the end 
you will leave and there will still be KSA, Turkey, Iran -- 
Iraq must have good relations with its neighbors without 
interference in internal affairs.\"  (Note: Saleh\'s statements 
of support for the IIG and for January 30 elections run hot 
and cold, Qirbi\'s view is not consistently reflected in ROYG 
behavior on Iraq.  End Note.) 
--------------------------- 
Gotta Get Control of SA/LWs 
--------------------------- 
 
13. (S) DAS thanked Qirbi and Alimi for ROYG cooperation in 
the recent weapons buyback, describing the effort as a \"major 
success.\"  However, he continued, the flow of SA/LWs into and 
through Yemen remains a significant problem -- for you, for 
us, for your neighbors.  Given how high the stakes are, said 
DAS, Yemen needs to be very serious about getting smuggling 
under control.\"  Both Ministers immediately pointed to what 
the ROYG claims was a 40 million dollar effort to buy back 
all types of SA/LW as well as explosives from the grey 
market.  Yemen cooperates with Saudi Arabia to stem arms 
smuggling, said Qirbi, but as long as there is money to buy 
and a market like Iraq, some smuggling will continue. 
 
14. (S) Alimi said he was pleased that Yemen and the US had 
reached a solution for removing specific weapons from the 
market, but \"I still have a lot of anxiety about what remains 
out there.\"  \"Yemen has a huge amount of weapons,\" continued 
Alimi, because of the cold war, and the 1994 civil war in 
\"which regional players were involved.\" \"So,\" continued the 
MI, \"we all bear the responsibility.\" 
 
----------------- 
Prisoner Releases 
----------------- 
 
15. (S) DAS expressed USG appreciation to the Minister of 
Interior for ROYG cooperation in delaying the release of 
security detainees suspected of ties to AQ, but stressed that 
the ROYG needs to fulfill its promises and provide a complete 
exchange of information with the USG.  Alimi claimed he had 
already complied by passing the detainees files to the Office 
of the Attorney General (AG) for prosecution. (Note: To 
Post\'s knowledge no files, evidence or information on the 
detainees garnered during PSO detention has been shared with 
the AG. Security Chief Gamish continues to insist that the 
PSO has no information.  End Note.)  Alimi told DAS he 
favored a legal solution, but if the AG finds there is no 
evidence these individuals have violated Yemeni law, \"we 
cannot continue to hold them indefinitely.  We have a 
constitutional obligation, and I am under pressure from 
Parliament, civil society groups and human rights advocates 
to release them.\"

discussion with Abdul Wahab Thabet, Chairmen of the Thabet 
brothers, the second largest company in Yemen.  Thabet 
vigorously criticized three of the most powerful ROYG 
ministers for corruption, and stated that on economics 
President Saleh, \"doesn\'t get it.\"  Thabet was very 
forthcoming on corruption problems, and said that opposition 
to economic reform will cease if the ROYG made real progress 
on corruption and administrative reforms.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Minister of Finance: The Biggest Obstacle to Change 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (C) According to Thabet, Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Finance al-Salami represents the biggest obstacle 
to economic reform and real progress on tackling corruption. 
Thabet explained that attempts by the Central Bank to 
reorganize are thwarted by the Minister of Finance.  Salami, 
he said, also forced out the former Customs Chairman Hafedh 
Mayed for trying to reduce tariffs, particularly on cars. 
The new customs chairman, Dr. Zobaidi Thabet is, according to 
Thabet, \"worthless and not focused on stopping smuggling.\" 
And in any case, questioned Thabet, is it really smuggling if 
the government officially allows it to happen?\" Thabet 
thought it unlikely that Salami was on his way out, but 
removing him is the only way to affect real change in Yemen. 
(Comment: Salami is likely going nowhere except perhaps up, 
although his departure would signal a sea-change in Yemen 
economic development.  End comment.) 
 
------------------------------------ 
Prime Minister Ba Jammal -- \"Useless\" 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Characterizing Prime Minister Ba Jammal as \"useless,\" 
Thabet said he was supposed to be out two months ago.  (Note: 
Ba Jammal\'s rumored departure is talked about openly in all 
circles and most interlocutors report that it is only a 
matter of time. End note.)  When queried about possible 
successors, Thabet dismissed rumors that Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Planning Ahmed Sofan may take the 
PM\'s place.  According to Thabet, the most commonly mentioned 
candidate is Sanaa University Rector Salah Ba Surah, whom 
Thabet dismissed as \"incompetent.\"  He noted that the third 
rumored successor, Aden Governor Shuaibi, should not be 
elevated to PM because Aden Governorate was the \"size of a 
job he can handle.\" Thabet said that several businessmen are 
lobbying for Foreign Minister Qirbi to take over as PM. 
(Comment: Qirbi as PM would change the post-unification 
tradition of having a PM from the South.  Thabet said that 
Qirbi being from the al-Bayda region -- on the border -- 
would likely be acceptable for both Southerners and 
Northerners.  End comment.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Sofan Involved with Aden Port Tender Mismanagement 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (C) Claiming that Sofan is all talk and short on 
follow-through, Thabet complained that while he may be the 
darling of some Western officials, in his opinion he was part 
of the problem.  Thabet claimed that Sofan and PM Ba Jammal 
are in cahoots, interfering with transparancy efforts in the 
tender process for the Port of Aden.  Thabet said that under 
the auspices of the Rotterdam Management Group, several 
companies were short-listed for the tender to operate the 
Port -- Dubai and Hutchison Whampoa were the leading 
contenders.   According to Thabet, Sofan and Ba Jammal 
convinced the tendering board to approve all 13 bidding 
companies for final review, including their own company, the 
former operator of the Port, which has been roundly 
criticized as inept and corrupt.  Thabet implied that Sofan 
and Ba Jammal\'s company may win the contract.  (Comment: 
Specific accusations aside, Post assesses this to be an 
accurate accounting of the corrupt tendering process and 
notes that it is common for Ministers to ensure their own 
companies win lucrative tenders. End Comment) 
 
5. (C) Thabet appealed for the embassy to lobby for a clean, 
transparent process and said that he along with his brother, 
a prominent MP, plan to  seek an audience with the President 
urging him to consider the Hutchison Whampoa group. (Note: 
The Thabets who are heavily involved in marine businesses 
would probably benefit from Hutchison. End Note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
On Economic Reform -- Where\'s the Money Going? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5. (C) In Thabet\'s analysis, no one at the top really 
understands the changes needed for necessary economic 
reforms.  On a positive note, Thabet noted that Saleh 
recently announced the creation of a committee to investigate 
diesel smuggling (septel), but remarked that the last time 
someone was fired for corruption, he was promoted to a higher 
position a week later.  Thabet said he and other members of 
the Chamber of Commerce would stop opposing economic reforms 
if the government could clearly account for where the money 
that would be saved by ending subsidies would be spent -- how 
would it benefit the Yemeni people. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
President Saleh -- The Old Man Doesn\'t Get It 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) In response to the question, \"who understands the 
economic situation?\" Thabet relied, \"The old man doesn\'t get 
it, and the people around him feed him bad information.\" 
Complaining that the President is more and more inconsistent 
in his speeches, Thabet said recent attempts by the Saleh to 
combat corruption are laughed off by most observers.  Thabet 
said only the US, UK and EU donor nations were capable of 
convincing Saleh of the need for economic reforms.  \"Maybe 
the old man will listen,\" said Thabet, \"athough he only 
understands tribal and security issues.\" Thabet confided that 
he could think of only two potentially honest brokers, 
Minister of Labor Affairs and Social Fund Director Arahabi, 
and former Minister of Oil and Minister of Finance al-Wajih. 
 
7. (C) Comment. Thabet is a long-time Embassy interlocutor 
whose frustration is clearly mounting along with negative 
economic indicators and growing corruption.  Thabet is not 
the first to point to the inability of the senior ROYG 
leadership to get through to Saleh on dire economic trends. 
Securing a viable international operator for the Port of Aden 
is one of the few hopes for Yemen\'s economy.  If Thabet\'s 
allegations surrounding the Port of Aden contract are true, 
the ROYG will be missing a rare opportunity to bring in much 
needed direct foreign investment into Yemen. 
 
8.  Comment Continued.  At a dinner meeting with MOPIC 
Minister Sofan and visiting MCC threshold team, Ambassador 
told Sofan that donor countries and the international 
business community would closely watch the Aden Port tender. 
It was very important for Yemen\'s reputation, Ambassador told 
the Minister, that the process be transparent, fair, and 
result in award of the contract to a reputable company. 
Sofan agreed completely but confirmed that the tender 
committee would consider all bidders, there is no shortlist.

Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski for reasons 1.4 b and d. 
 
1. (SBU) Summary. The December 8-10 visit to Sanaa by 
Eritrean president Isayas Afewerki is being touted as marking 
\"a new page\" in Yemen-Eritrea relations.  Since a fishing 
dispute over the Hunaish Islands erupted into armed conflict 
in 1995, Yemen-Eritrea relations have been icy.  Although the 
dispute was resolved through international arbitration in 
favor of Yemen in 1998, the ROYG has viewed Eritrean motives 
in the Horn of Africa (HOA) with mistrust.  During the visit, 
the two Presidents signed a fisheries agreement, held 
discussions on mutual security, and committed to signing 
eight additional cooperative agreements in Asmara in January. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (U) At a December 10 joint press conference, President 
Saleh claimed Afewerki\'s trip was unrelated to the 
unconfirmed skirmish between the two countries in the waters 
of the Hunaish Islands several weeks earlier (reftel).  Saleh 
told the press discussions with Afewerki focused on a new 
joint fisheries initiative and eight new bilateral agreements 
on investment, taxation, culture, trade and security. 
According to local press reports, the two Presidents had a 
closed-door meeting to discuss security and regional 
stability. 
 
3. (U) In an interview with Eritrean TV, Saleh offered his 
services as go-between for Eritrea and Ethiopia saying, \"I do 
not call myself a mediator, but I am ready to help the two 
sides.\"  The next step in improving relations will be the 
January &Sanaa Gathering\" meeting in Khartoum to be attended 
by Yemen, Ethiopia and Sudan.  (Note:  Saleh stated that the 
Sanaa Gathering is not against Eritrea but an economic 
meeting open to all.  In statements following the last 
gathering meeting in December of 2003, the Eritrea Government 
said the gathering \"aims to asphyxiate Eritrea.\"  End Note.) 
 
4. (C)  Comment.  Afewerki\'s visit was scheduled on the heels 
of a November 21 incident during which the ROYG fired shots 
at an alleged Eritrean vessel that entered Yemeni territorial 
waters of the Hunaish Islands (reftel).  Immediately 
following the incident, Ambassador was called in by Vice 
President Hadi who requested U.S. Forces in HOA share any 
information they might have collected on the alledged 
Eritrean vessel, as well as on a possible Eritrean Naval 
buildup.  The timing of the Eritrean President\'s visit to 
Sanaa was likely no accident.  It may signal recognition by 
both sides that confidence-building measures are called for 
to prevent future maritime incidents from escalating 
unnecessarily.  End Comment.

PROMOTE ECONOMIC REFORM 
 
REF: SANAA 2521 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski for reasons 1.4 (b. and d. 
) 
 
1. (C) A recent series of local press articles may signal 
that the ROYG is finally taking initial steps to address 
corruption, particularly in the area of diesel smuggling, one 
of the main reasons Parliament was able to successfully stall 
implementation of an economic reform package.  In a meeting 
to determine Yemen\'s MCA threshold proposal, Anti-Corruption 
Committee point man Ali al-Anisi affirmed that fighting 
corruption is a top priority for the ROYG. In September, 
(reftel) Parliament (with the blessing of the President) 
voted down a series of cost cutting and revenue enhancing 
measures, saying that until the executive did more to address 
administrative abuses and corruption, the reforms would not 
pass.  Parliament is now debating the 2005 budget, which has 
attached to it the pending economic reforms.  The reform 
package includes reducing diesel subsidies, and instituting a 
general sales tax and civil service reform. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Saleh Forms New Anti-Corruption Committees 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) Press reports have focused on a move by President 
Saleh to form two investigative committees to look at the 
issues of oil smuggling and over-staffing at the Ministry of 
Education.  The committee investigating the oil subsidies 
will be composed of members from Parliament\'s Oil Committee 
(responsible for this past year\'s corruption investigation on 
block 53) and members of the Central Organization for Control 
and Audit. An article in the government daily \"al-Thawra\" 
specified companies to be investigated.  Deputy Foreign 
Minister Noman told Pol/Econ Chief that all contracts with 
the companies in question have been canceled until the 
investigation is completed.  (Background: One of the 
arguments in favor of reducing the subsidy is that diesel 
fuel is smuggled to neighboring countries and sold for 
profit.  Most of smugglers are affiliated with the military 
and benefit from the subsidies.) 
 
3. (SBU) The second committee will address a controversial 
and public problem, over staffing at Ministry of Education. 
It is rumored that as many as 50 percent of people who 
collect salaries from the Ministry of Education do not 
actually report to work. 
 
--------------------- 
Press Supports Reform 
--------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) On December 12 \"al-Thawra\" ran a front-page 
commentary noting that diesel subsidies cost the ROYG 670 
million USD a year.  \"Those who were against the reforms are 
corrupt and benefit from the low diesel prices,\" the article 
criticized, accusing politicians who oppose reducing oil 
subsidies for \"not assuming and responsibility for the 
national interest.\" (Note: The 2005 ROYG Budget is about 4.5 
billion USD, the amount in diesel subsidies is in excess of 
what the government spends on healthcare and education 
combined.  End Note). 
 
5. (SBU) Deputy Minister of Planning Mohammed al-Sabry told 
Pol/Econ Deputy he was pleased at the \"strong words\" of this 
article and believed it indicated increased attention to 
promoting reforms.  Sabry himself penned an article that 
appeared in the paper \"Jaridat al-Nas,\" affiliated with the 
opposition party Islah, saying that the \"doses\", as the 
economic reforms are commonly referred to, will not affect 
the people.  Sabray analyzed the effect on the poor, and 
concluded that while inflation will grow, more money will be 
used for development.  Sabry said that his article was the 
first in a series that will directly address the concerns of 
the average citizen over the effects of the economic reform 
package. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Anisi Says Saleh Personally Involved With Issue 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (C) To demonstrate the ROYG\'s commitment to 
anti-corruption measures, Deputy Prime Minister Sofan 
arranged for Ambassador and visiting MCA Threshold Program 
representative to meet with Director of the Presidential 
Office and Deputy Director of the Supreme Committee for 
Combating Corruption Anisi 12/20.  Prime Minister Ba Jammal 
heads the Supreme Committee.  Anisi affirmed Yemen\'s 
committment to fighting corruption and produced a German 
financed study outlining measures the ROYG has to enforce its 
existing anti-corruption laws.  Anisi said President Saleh is 
personally involved with anti-corruption measures and that 
the government understands the issue.  To close, Anisi 
claimed that Yemen wants to take a leadership role in 
fighting terrorism, promoting democratic reform and fighting 
corruption.  (Note: Anisi\'s committee is openly derided among 
most Yemenis as worthless, and he is known to be one of the 
more corrupt members of Saleh\'s inner circle.   End note.) 
 
7. (C) Comment: Embassy contacts are pointing to these 
initial steps with pleasure, but note healthy skepticism at 
what might be achieved.  Anisi\'s committee has done nothing 
in the past two years to actually stem the rising tide of 
corruption.  It is significant to note that for the first 
time a Deputy Minister is appearing on the front lines 
advocating for economic reform.  Until a Minister or the 
President directly appeals for these changes, however, we too 
remain skeptical about how much impact this new public 
campaign will have on reforms.  Nevertheless, high level 
bureaucrats have taken up the call to promote reforms, and 
the President\'s establishment of two committees to 
investigate corruption are both important steps.  Post will 
continue to encourage follow-through on these initiatives and 
push for additional concrete steps to address corruption, 
which is crucial as Yemen aims for MCC status in 2006.  End

2. (U) The Yemeni financial system is not yet well developed. 
Thus, the extent of money laundering is not known. The prevalence 
of hawala makes Yemen vulnerable to money laundering, although 
they are technically subject to limited monitoring by the Central 
Bank of Yemen (CBY). The banking sector is relatively small with 
17 commercial banks, including four Islamic banks. The Central 
Bank of Yemen (CBY) supervises the country\'s banks. Local banks 
account for approximately 62 percent of the total banking 
activities, while foreign banks cover the other 38 percent. 
Yemen is a founding member of the Middle East and North African 
Financial Action Task Force MENA_FATF established this year in 
Bahrain. 
Yemen\'s parliament passed a comprehensive anti-money laundering 
legislation in April 2003. The legislation criminalizes money 
laundering for a wide range of crimes, including narcotics 
offenses, kidnapping, embezzlement, bribery, fraud, tax evasion, 
illegal arms trading, and money theft, and imposes penalties of 
three to five years of imprisonment. There is no specific 
legislation relating to counterterrorist financing in Yemen. But 
terrorism is covered in various pieces of legislation that treat 
terrorism and its financing as serious crimes.  As of 2004 no 
significant changes or additions have been made to the anti-money 
laundering legislation and no persons have been prosecuted for 
money laundering.  The Anti-money Laundering Committee prepared 
the draft executive bylaws, which have been forwarded to the 
cabinet for approval. - The committee prepared an anti-money 
laundering procedural directory, which will be distributed to all 
public and private financial institutions. The directory explains 
how to monitor and control laundering cases. The April 2003 law 
requires banks, financial institutions, and precious commodity 
dealers to verify the identity of persons and entities that 
desire to open accounts or deal with them, to keep records of 
transactions for up to ten years, and to report suspicious 
transactions. In addition, the law requires that reports be 
submitted to an information-gathering unit within the CBY. The 
unit acts as the financial intelligence unit (FIU), which in turn 
will report to the Anti-Money Laundering Committee (AMLC). The 
AMLC is composed of representatives from the Ministries of 
Finance, Justice, Interior, and Industry and Commerce, the CBY, 
and the board of banks, and is authorized to issue regulations 
and guidelines and provide training workshops related to 
combating money laundering efforts. 
The CBY conducted several training workshops on the new 
legislation in 2003 and 2004.  The law grants the AMLC the right 
to exchange information with foreign entities. The head of the 
committee can ask local judicial authorities to enforce foreign 
court verdicts based on reciprocity. Also, the law permits the 
extradition of non-Yemeni criminals in accordance with 
international treaties or bilateral agreements. 
Prior to passage of the anti-money laundering law, in April 2002, 
the CBY issued Circular 22008, informing banks and financial 
institutions that they must verify the legality of all proceeds 
deposited in or passing through the Yemeni banking system. The 
circular stipulates that financial institutions must positively 
identify the place of residence of all persons and businesses 
that establish relationships with them. The circular also 
requires that banks verify the identity of persons or entities 
that wish to transfer more than $10,000 through banks at which 
they have no accounts. The same provision applies to 
beneficiaries of such transfers. Banks must also take every 
precaution when transactions appear suspicious, and report such 
activities to the CBY. The circular was distributed to the banks 
along with a copy of the Basel Committee\'s \"Customer Due 
Diligence for Banks,\" concerning \"Know Your Customer\" procedures. 
In 2003, DHS/ICE agents in New York conducted an investigation of 
a company suspected to be involved in the smuggling and 
distribution of pseudoephedrine. The investigation disclosed 
employees at the business were sending a large number of 
negotiable checks to Sanaa, Yemen. Analysis of the documents 
seized as a result of search warrants and bank records revealed 
that the suspects had also wire transferred money to an 
individual with suspected ties to the al-Qaida organization. ICE 
agents also initiated an investigation pursuant to an outbound 
seizure of suspected hawala generated funds seized en-route to 
Yemen, concealed in jars of honey. The investigation disclosed 
that the courier, and the reputed owner/broker of the funds, was 
actively involved in a hawala network. 
In response to UNSCR 1267/1390/1452 and Yemen\'s Council of 
Ministers\' directives, CBY issued a number of circulars to all 
banks operating in Yemen, directing them to freeze accounts of 
144 persons, companies, and organizations, and to report any 
finding to CBY. As a result, one account was immediately frozen 
with a balance equal to $33. In September 2003, the CBY issued 
Circular No. 75304 containing a consolidated list of all persons 
and entities belonging to al-Qaida (182) and the Taliban (153). 
The ROYG did not issue the circular again in 2004. 
A law was passed in 2001 governing charitable organizations. This 
law entrusted the Ministry of Pensions and Social Affairs with 
overseeing their activities. The law also imposes penalties of 
fines and/or imprisonment on any society or its members convicted 
of carrying out activities or spending funds for other than the 
stated purpose for which the society in question was established. 
Yemen is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and has signed, 
but not yet ratified, the UN Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime. Yemen is a party to the Arab Convention for the 
Suppression of Terrorism. 
Yemen is making progress in enforcing its domestic anti-money 
laundering program While passage of the 2003 law was a first 
step, development of the FIU and international cooperation with 
criminal investigations are still in the development stage. Since 
the February 2004 designation of Sheikh Abdul Majid Zindani by 
the United Nations under UNSCR resolution 1267 the ROYG has made 
no known attempt to enforce the sanctions.  The CBY is still 
organizing its enforcement mechanism. Its effectiveness will 
demonstrate the authorities\' commitment to ending money 
laundering. Yemen should also examine the prevalence of 
alternative remittance systems such as hawala and trade-based 
money laundering. As a next step, Yemen should also enact 
specific legislation with respect to terrorist financing and 
forfeiture of the assets of those suspected of terrorism. Yemen 
should become a party to the UN International Convention for the 
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.

approval by the Somali Parliament.  In response to the FM\'s 
request for a public statement of US support for the forum, 
and for Yemen\'s efforts as founder and likely driving force 
behind several of the initiatives, Charge said we would 
explore the idea of a statement, but noted that the USG 
continues to have serious concerns about security in 
Mogadishu and the readiness of other parties to accept the 
new government without the eruption of violence.  As for 
Sudan\'s promise to honor the time table for a peace the peace 
agreement and facilitate the access of international relief 
agencies to alleviate the deteriorating humanitarian 
situation in Darfur -- the GOS has repeatedly failed to honor 
such pledges -- the time is now, Charge told Qirbi, for Sudan 
to live up to its commitments with concrete actions on the 
ground.  (Comment: Saleh received ref A demarche points 
before leaving for Khartoum and may be seeking credit from 
USG for inclusion of the Bashir commitments in the joint 
communique.  End Comment.) 
 
5. (C) Qirbi passed a copy of the summit\'s joint communique. 
In additional to the three items listed above, the members of 
the gathering condemned terrorism and affirmed their 
commitment to cooperate in the GWOT, expressed satisfaction 
with the conclusion of the Somali peace process and called on 
the international community to commit funds to enable the 
interim government to establish its authority in Somalia, 
called for a resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
process, and reaffirmed members support for an independent 
democratic Iraq and the role of the UN in reconstruction. 
 
6. (C) Comment and Action Request.  Saleh\'s contributions to 
the summit, particularly his proposals for a formal dialogue 
between Eritrea and Ethiopia and between Eritrea and Sudan to 
resolve outstanding disputes, come as no surprise.  Saleh has 
been looking for opportunities to wear the hat of regional 
statesmen, beginning with his Sea Island attendance and 
efforts to play a lead role in the region on BMENA reform. 
The ROYG is also seriously concerned the impact of prolonged 
instability in Somalia on Yemen\'s own stability.  Post 
requests department guidance on: A) whether or not a general 
statement of support for the Sanaa Forum\'s work in Khartoum 
(and kudos to Yemen as a primary diplomatic force behind it) 
is appropriate at this time; and B) how USG might react to an 
AU-Arab League supported move by Yousef to Mogadishu.  End 
Comment and Action Request.

1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Charge convened a 
core EAC meeting on December 28, 2004, to share 
information regarding the recent attempt to attack 
Embassy personnel and to assess recent threat 
information. Embassy employees were reminded to remain 
vigilant in light of recent threat reporting and to 
report all security related incidents immediately to 
the RSO. EAC members noted no current additional specific 
threats against Embassy Sanaa. Key offices and personnel 
represented included:  CDA, FPD, OMC, RMAS, POL/ECON ,MO, 
CCE, DAO, AID, PD, LEGATT and RSO. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  (C)  The Charge began the discussion with a review 
of the details concerning the recent attempt  to 
attack Embassy personnel during a Christmas Eve dinner 
at an Embassy residence. Charge commended the 
Ambassador\'s bodyguards and Yemeni CSF members who 
foiled the attempt and apprehend the perpetrators. 
Charge shared information provided by the Minister of 
the Interior to include the arrest of the perpetrator 
who admitted to wishing to hurt \"foreigners\" and to 
having at least two possible collaborators.  The Embassy 
expects a full report from the MOI on the ongoing 
investigation. A request by the Embassy to participate 
in the interrogation is currently under consideration. 
Charge stressed that that EAC members should not discuss 
this  matter or any details concerning the ongoing 
investigation in order not to jeopardize efforts for 
additional arrests in the case. Charge emphasized the 
need for communication and  information sharing between 
EAC members and stressed and stressed the need for each 
section to constantly review their personal security 
measures. 
 
3. (S/NF) RSO reviewed efforts to increase counter- 
surveillance measures around Embassy residences and 
consideration is being given to moving those Embassy 
personnel whose residences are in more vulnerable areas. 
 
4.  (U)  LEGATT noted that due the fact no American 
American security officials are directly involved in the 
investigation, the information received by the Embassy 
from Yemeni security officials may not be totally 
accurate.  LEGATT suggested strong pressure on the MOI 
to allow American investigators access to suspects 
connected to the case as soon as possible for 
questioning. LEGATT added that although no connection may 
exist, the end of the year has typically been a time in 
Yemen where attacks against westerners occur. 
 
 
5.  (S/NF) EAC members discussed general security 
precautions.  RMAS added that community members should 
not rely solely on host government security but should 
make assessments and take an active interest in  there own 
personal security. RMAS also emphasized the need to have 
primary and secondary means of communications and 
recommended a test of the Embassy phone tree system in the 
near future. 
 
 
6.  (S/NF)  EAC members agreed that recent events did not 
warrant cancellation of the Embassy New Year\'s party to be 
held on the Embassy compound or restriction of travel 
throughout the country.  The Charge concluded the EAC 
meeting by reminding members to be vigilant in observing 
their environment and reporting any unusual developments or 
changes near their residences to the RSO.  The implications 
of recent events will be further reviewed as more 
information comes in.  EAC and Washington will be informed 
accordingly.

SUBJECT: MCC VISITS SANAA: YEMEN ON THE THRESHOLD 
 
1. (SBU) Summary. USAID Millennium Challenge Account 
Secretariat Representatives Bryan Kurtz and Steve Feldstein 
 
SIPDIS 
and MCC Threshold Country Managing Director Kevin Saba 
briefed senior level ROYG officials at the Ministries of 
Planning, Justice, and Human Rights December 16-19 on 
requirements for Yemen\'s MCA Threshold proposal.  MCC 
representatives made clear to ROYG MCC lead Ministry of 
Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) that 
significant funding is available, but the initiative for 
reform must come from the ROYG.  The delegation told their 
interlocutors that to qualify for threshold funding it was 
critical that Yemen\'s proposal addressed seriously the issues 
of corruption and rule of law.  (Note: ROYG officials report 
taking this message on board, but the proof will be in the 
proposal due to MCC January 31.) End Summary. 
 
-------------- 
Yemen\'s Scores 
-------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Background: While a threshold country, Yemen\'s 
scores in the \"Ruling Justly\" category fall far below median 
indicators in all categories except the corruption indicator. 
 This year\'s Transparency International Report, however, 
dropped Yemen\'s scores on corruption to reflect what many 
officials tell us privately is a more accurate score. 
Yemen\'s score in the Rule of Law category also falls below 
the 25 percent margin, reflecting serious shortcomings in the 
execution of justice. 
 
------------------------------- 
Planning in Charge of Threshold 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Planning Ahmed 
Sofan, head of the lead Ministry on MCC told the visiting 
delegation that his Ministry plans to use the MCC process as 
a springboard for wider reforms.  MOPIC formed a technical 
committee to handle threshold and MCC, drawing on broad 
representation from the ministries and civil society.  Jalal 
Yaqoub, Assistant Deputy Minister, MOPIC, chairs the 
committee.  Yaqoub has shared his concerns with Emboffs that 
the committee is unwieldy, comprising a range of concerns. 
The technical committee reports to a ministerial committee 
for implementation, making the process even more cumbersome. 
During a meeting with MCC officials, a member of the 
committee complained that the Threshold process does not give 
them enough time to deal with the sweeping reforms called 
for.  Comment: On the other hand, the committee is creating 
cross-ministerial buy-in to the MCC concept and tackling much 
needed reform issues.  End comment. 
 
4. (SBU) MCC representatives told ROYG officials that to 
qualify for threshold funding, MCC and USAID want to see 
immediate action on some important steps, such as the 
implementation of existing laws, as good-faith (and 
cost-free) demonstration of ROYG commitment.  There is $5-10 
million in threshold funding Yemen may draw on to aid its 
efforts to achieve MCC status, they explained.  But the funds 
will not be granted unless Yemen\'s proposal makes the grade. 
(Note: The Mission must first sign off on threshold proposal 
and staff have made very clear that Post will not forward to 
Washington a proposal that does not seriously address 
shortcomings in corruption and rule of law. End Note). 
 
5. (SBU) In several discussions with Deputy Prime Minister 
Ahmed Sofan, the MCC delegation stressed the centrality of 
the corruption and rule of law indicators to Yemen\'s success. 
 Sofan agreed that these were crosscutting issues, and said 
he understood that dealing with corruption was the key to 
eliminating many of the obstacles to reform.  Mindful of the 
difficulties he will have in taking on such a deeply routed 
issue as corruption in Yemen, Sofan broadened the MCC 
discussions to include general poverty, the investment 
climate, and the role of women in society.  He welcomed what 
he characterized as a renewed role of aid in U.S. foreign 
policy, and explained that tradition and lack of education in 
Yemen make reform difficult, but not impossible. 
 
6. (SBU) One MOPIC official confided on the margins of the 
meetings that the ROYG may start with smaller anti-corruption 
measures.  In their view, he said, going after high-level 
abuse would create more problems than it would solve. 
Instead, he believes MOPIC will pursue smaller measures in 
its proposal, such as placing signs in ministries and 
fostering more press freedom on the issue of corruption with 
the aim of gaining popular support for a \"culture of honesty\". 
 
------------------------------------- 
Ministers of Justice and Human Rights 
Explain Yemen\'s Constraints 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Minister of Justice Adnan Al-Jafri described his 
five-year plan for judicial reform, including extensive 
support for commercial courts, training for judges, and 
faster trials. Claiming to have the full support of President 
Saleh in his efforts, Jafri expressed commitment to make 
needed judicial reforms. Minister of Human Rights Amat 
al-Soswa  emphasized the importance of MCC\'s \"girls\' 
education\" indicator as the basis for political participation 
and the advancement of human rights in society.  According to 
Yaqoub, advancing women\'s roles in society will be a 
significant part of Yemen\'s Threshold proposal. 
 
8.  (SBU) Comment. The visiting delegation clearly 
communicated to the relevant ROYG officials what MCC expects 
from Yemen\'s proposal for threshold funding, and were 
impressed that MOPIC has chosen to utilize MCC as an vehicle 
for reform, whether or not Yemen qualifies for MCC.  All 
parties agree that MCC indicators reflect the most important 
challenges in Yemen, and that the countries future depends 
ultimately on progress in these areas.  Sofan, his 
subordinates, and several interlocutors see MCC threshold as 
a way to encourage the ROYG to make what they characterize as 
long-over due reforms.  MCC is providing the venue to discuss 
these issues and address critical shortcomings in the areas 
of governance and corruption.  The content of Yemen\'s 
Threshold funding proposal, due in January, will speak 
volumes as to whether the ROYG can meet the pace and achieve 
the focus necessary in the short run, and then it must 
sustain this momentum in the long run.  End comment.

Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.5 b and d. 
 
1. (C) Summary.  USCENTCOM Commander General Abizaid met with 
President Saleh on January 4.  Discussions centered on Iraqi 
elections, regional security, and U.S.-Yemen cooperation in 
the GWOT.  Both agreed that U.S.-Yemen joint security efforts 
should continue and increase in the new year, with Abizaid 
pressing for enhanced information sharing, particularly on 
fighting al-Qa\'ida. Discussions with Ministry of Defense and 
Yemeni Coast Guard officials were useful in specifying areas 
for bilateral military cooperation. Failure to clear the 
General\'s communications equipment through airport security, 
however, pointed to continuing opaqueness of the ROYG\'s 
Political Security Organization (PSO). End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Iraqi Elections: Engage the Ba\'thists 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Getting right to the point, President Saleh advised 
General Abizaid that the Iraqi elections be postponed, 
warning that holding elections now guarantees a Shia-heavy 
government and, therefore, he said, a divided society.  \"It 
is no shame, advised Saleh, to talk with the Sunni Ba\'thist 
opposition.\" He proposed that the U.S. engage in dialogue 
with Iraqi Ba\'thists and other Sunni supporters of the 
insurgency with to goal of holding \"a more balanced election 
in the future.\"  By isolating the Iraqi Ba\'thists Saleh 
continued, \"you force them into the Zarqawi camp.\"  General 
Abizaid responded that the U.S. is willing to talk to anyone 
in Iraq with the exception of al Qa\'ida, Zarqawi and other 
terrorists.  To postpone the elections, however, would be a 
victory for terrorism.  Saleh reiterated the need to bring 
the Iraqi Sunnis and Ba\'thists inside the tent and suggested 
that the USG employ Syrian Ba\'athists to facilitate such a 
dialogue.  Saleh also  offered his own good offices to 
establish such contacts, suggesting that his Iraqi ex- 
Ba\'thist military advisors could serve as conduits to 
Ba\'thists inside Iraq.\"think about it,\" he said, \"and let me 
know if I can help.\"  Despite his view that elections should 
be postponed, Saleh confirmed that the ROYG would be sending 
Yemeni election observers to Iraq for the January 30 
elections in coordination with the Canadian government. 
 
-------------- 
CT Cooperation 
-------------- 
 
3. (S) Abizaid told Saleh he had just had a useful meeting 
with Minister of Defense Alaiwa and Chief of Staff Qassemi in 
which he expressed his support for continued and increased 
security and counter-terrorism cooperation in 2005.  Saleh 
agreed, saying that he hoped U.S.-Yemen joint efforts in the 
GWOT as well as economic and military cooperation would 
expand.  Abizaid referred to earlier ROYG requests for 
intelligence sharing, saying that the U.S. remained ready to 
provide such assistance.  (Note:  Saleh had requested U.S. 
military aircraft reconnaissance flights over the areas of 
the al-Houthi rebellion.  After interagency agreement, 
however, the ROYG declined the assistance saying the 
insurgency had already been put down. End Note). Emphasizing 
the importance of ROYG intel-sharing to our joint security 
interests, Abizaid assured President Saleh that the U.S. 
would continue to be forthcoming.  General Abizaid 
complimented the ROYG (and the MOI in particular) on recent 
CT related arrests and pressed for full information sharing 
and coordination with the USG Embassy on those arrests. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Did you pack all that luggage yourself? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (S) Belying the friendly and useful discussions General 
Abizaid had with ROYG officials at MOD, YCG (details septel) 
and President Saleh, was a standoff at Sanaa airport between 
the General\'s staff and airport officials over the clearance 
of the General\'s luggage and communications equipment through 
customs. Embassy high level contacts managed to get the 
traveling party\'s personal luggage released, but not the 
communications gear. Airport officials insisted that they 
needed a letter from President Saleh personally to allow the 
equipment in - a permission which is not routinely required 
and which was impossible to obtain on such short notice. 
(Comment: The Deputy Director of the President\'s office told 
CDA that he personally appealed to General Gamesh, the crusty 
old guard Director of the Political Security Organization 
(PSO) in this matter. That Gamesh did not authorize the 
release of the equipment is not surprising, given the lack of 
transparency and trust we regularly experience in our 
dealings with this organization. More troubling, is the 
possibility that Saleh himself may have been informed of this 
situation and failed to give his instructions to resolve it. 
End comment).

1. (C) Summary. During a rancorous Parliamentary session on 
December 26, Prime Minister Ba Jammal\'s bodyguards ushered 
him out of the building while he was trying to give a speech 
promoting the government\'s 2005 budget. Attached to the 
budget are much needed economic reforms including reduction 
of the diesel subsidy, implementation of a general sales tax, 
and amendments to the customs and general investment laws. 
After what newspapers are calling an \"attack,\" Parliament was 
shut down for two days before reconvening the contentious 
budget debate December 29.  Also on December 29, President 
Saleh announced judicial reforms that may well signal his 
first attempt to respond to Parliamentary demands that the 
executive get serious about addressing corruption. End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Ba Jammal Returns -- Ousted Again -- Parliament Shut Down 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (SBU) On December 26, Prime Minister Ba Jammal made a 
second attempt at defending economic reforms, now attached to 
the ROYG\'s 5 Billion USD 2005 budget plan.  Ba Jammal\'s 
bodyguards, sensing a physical threat, swiftly removed the 
widely unpopular PM from Parliament.  In violation of 
constitutional law, Parliament was shut down for two days and 
several MPs staged sit-ins in front of the building. 
Parliament reopened on December 29.  (Note: In September he 
was also whisked out of Parliament under threat of violence 
while advocating for the reforms package, at that time being 
considered separately from the budget proposal.  End note). 
 
3. (SBU) According to several contacts close to Parliament, 
on the day of the ruckus, many MPs raised conditions for 
approving the budget, including calling on the executive to 
fully implement the Local Councils Law.  (Note: In effect, 
this would mean that fifty percent of national investment 
budget would be obligated to local councils in 2005 as 
opposed to the current 11 percent.  Many councils scarcely 
receive any budget and several, including in the Marib 
governorate, have never met. End note).  Other 
Parliamentarians demanded amendments to the budget to limit 
the power of the Ministry of Finance to disburse funds, and 
anti-corruption amendments to the tendering law. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Saleh Announces Judicial Reforms 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) In a December 29 speech to the higher judicial 
council, Saleh announced judicial reforms including the 
dismissal of 22 judges for misconduct and the retirement of 
108 elderly judges.  Saleh sent eight judges to the so called 
\"accountability council\" for misconduct, and added several 
new undersecretaries to the Ministry of Justice.  The 
Judicial Inspection Commission was also granted increased 
staffing and funding to enhance its oversight capabilities. 
State run press referred to these changes as \"sweeping.\" 
 
------------------------------- 
Rumors of Riots and Price Hikes 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Sanaa this past week was riddled with rumors that the 
government is raising prices on all foodstuffs, diesel prices 
will double overnight and mass demonstrations will occur 
downtown.  The Joint Meeting Party, a coalition of eight 
opposition parties, announced their objection to the \"doses,\" 
and called on Yemenis to oppose price hikes.  According to a 
senior Yemeni NGO democratic expert, Northern tribes and 
members of the military who benefit from diesel smuggling are 
fueling the opposition to economic reform.  Northern Brigade 
Commander Ali Muhsen, rumored a potential successor to Saleh, 
is said to be behind the opposition and many in Sanaa note 
that it is his papers that are predicting economic disaster 
if such reforms are implemented. 
 
6. (SBU) PM Ba Jammal announced on January 6 that Parliament 
passed the government\'s budget late the previous evening by a 
majority of 161 votes, versus 25 opposing, and six 
abstaining.  Many from the opposition Islah and YSP parties 
simply walked out during the session.  (Note: Details of this 
session will be covered septel.  Semi-official al-Thawra 
daily bannered \"no increases in oil or oil or gas 
derivatives.\"  End Note). 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
7. (C) Although the executive in Yemen is not required to 
seek approval of its budget program from Parliament, Saleh 
put the budget before Parliament with the economic reform 
package attached in a likely attempt to delay implementation 
and gain political cover for reforms that are not popular 
with the public.  Parliament seized the opportunity to 
leverage some of their long-standing complaints on corruption 
and fiscal decentralization.  Post believes that most MPs 
simply oppose reforms because they will personally lose 
revenue, however, there are several reform minded MPs working 
to stop the reform package because they believe the ROYG is 
not doing enough to fight corruption.  Saleh, who has stayed 
out of the high-volume debate, allowed Parliament to voice 
its opposition and was able to put off frustrated World Bank, 
IMF and Donor reps calling for the economic reform package. 
Mission\'s MEPI and USAID funded activities in 
decentralization and parliamentary strengthening will serve 
to buttress the continued effort to reform. 
 
8. (C) Comment continued. While Parliament\'s central goal to 
decentralize is still actively being debated, Saleh\'s 
announcement on judicial reform is likely a concession to 
Parliament\'s long-standing corruption complaints.  Removing 
the diesel subsidy and implementing the general sales tax 
would have seriously affected tribal and business interests, 
crucial to Saleh\'s balance of power.  The political will to 
take on those measures is still clearly not there. 
Nevertheless, Parliament continues to gain momentum on issues 
of corruption and decentralization and the liberal minded at 
least are proving to be a positive force against 
state-corruption, even as the majority are still blocking 
needed economic reform.  Senior ROYG officials hoping to gain 
democratic cover for their self interested policies have 
unwittingly unleashed an increasingly vocal and active 
Parliament.  End comment.

SUBJECT: CENTRAL BANK OF YEMEN USING \"MORAL PERSUASION\" FOR 
ENFORCEMENT 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: During a MEPI-sponsored assessment of the 
Yemen banking system, representatives of the Financial 
Services Volunteer Corps engaged in lengthy discussions with 
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) Sub-Governor for Control Abdullah 
Ulafi and Payment Systems Director Omar Bazara.  Both 
officials gave candid assessments of the weaknesses of the 
Yemeni banking system: Prevalent insider lending, over-use of 
short-term loans, limited CBY oversight authority and 
capacity, and intervention of the Ministry of Finance in CBY 
regulatory policy.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Commercial Banking: Short-term loans for \"trade finance\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2. (SBU) According to Ulafi, Yemen,s fourteen commercial 
banks, four of which are Islamic, lend about one-third of 
their capital to \"trade-finance\" projects with terms under 
one year.  Ulafi claimed commercial lending is on the rise 
and that the liquidity of Yemen\'s banks is not a problem 
since the commercial banks are heavily invested in Treasury 
Bills.  Ulafi said that deposits are increasing 25 percent a 
year due to point-of-sale purchases.  Most of the banking 
sector, however, contends that lending remains stagnant 
because of a lack of legal enforcement against defaulters and 
the absence of a reliable credit rating system.  (Note: only 
three percent of Yemenis hold bank accounts.  End Note). 
Ulafi said that Islamic banks are the fastest growing sector 
of the market. 
 
3. (SBU) The banking law requires Yemeni banks to have a 
minimum capital adequacy ratio of 8 percent, and the Central 
Bank requires ten percent of bank liquidity to be held in 
Yemeni Riyals (YR) and twenty percent in foreign currency. 
Existing capital requirements are 6 billion Riyals, roughly 2 
million USD. 
 
----------------------------------- 
CBY Enforcement: \"Moral Persuasion\" 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The Central Bank has seventeen bank examiners 
located at the bank to do monthly on site inspections.  Ulafi 
affirmed that insider lending, with banks lending to their 
own boards of directors and close associates, is the biggest 
problem facing the banking system.  Ulafi said the CBY uses 
\"moral persuasion\" to reduce these practices, complaining 
that the CBY,s oversight powers as defined in the banking 
law, were watered down due to the influence of powerful 
Yemeni banking families.  (Comment: Most of Yemen,s banks 
are essentially vaults for the major families and their 
business associates to place their money, they are by and 
large reluctant to lend to anyone unknown to them.  End 
comment). 
 
5. (SBU) The CBY uses the Capital, Assets, Management, 
Earnings and Liquidity (CAMEL) system to rank their banks 
from 1 (best) to 5 (worst).   Ulafi admitted that two banks 
in Yemen ranked a five and one a 4. (Note: One FSVC volunteer 
said that these three banks should be shut down. End note.) 
Ulafi said 85 percent of banks in Yemen rank at one or two on 
the scale.  If a bank scores a five the CBY prohibits it from 
distributing profits or opening new accounts or branches. 
Ulafi characterized the two poorly performing banks as 
suffering from non-performing loans, low capital and bad 
management. 
 
6. (SBU) The CBY does not have an arbitration office, and 
maintains only a limited credit bureau.  The CBY revoked one 
bank\'s license for issuing bad loans after several depositors 
were unable to withdraw their deposits.  Because they 
exceeded the bank\'s capital, the ROYG took over these loans. 
Complicating the situation Yemen,s weak commercial courts 
are unable to enforce claims on collateral.  Without strong 
commercial courts, Ulafi asserted, insider trading is 
encouraged and banks are reluctant to expand business. 
 
--------------------------- 
T-Bills crowding out Loans? 
--------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Ulafi discussed IMF concern that the CBY is over 
reliant on Treasury Bills and therefore crowding out other 
investments.  Ulafi contended that this is not a problem and 
that T-Bills are a low risk option for banks. (Note:  Ulafi 
may be correct, but as liquidity is not an issue for most 
banks they should have sufficient funds for both T-Bill and 
other investments. End note).  T-bills are sold at 3 month, 6 
month and 1 year increments.  This year the CBY sold 500 
Million YR in T-Bills as opposed to last year,s sales of 700 
million YR.  Ulafi said that Yemen\'s monetary policy applies 
indirect measures to maintain monetary stability and to 
forecast liquidity in an effort to bring inflation down.  The 
Central Bank Law mandates that inflation control and exchange 
rate stability are the two priorities of Yemen\'s monetary 
policy.  It accomplishes this by selling T-Bills to reduce 
the money supply and by selling foreign currency.  Due to 
negligible borrowing in Yemen, the CBY cannot regulate 
monetary policy by raising or lowering interest rates. 
 
8. (SBU) Omar Bazara, Payments Systems Director for CBY, 
noted that T-Bills are often used by commercial banks when 
balance sheets show an end-of-the-day deficit.  Rather than 
disclose their financial status to competitors in order to 
receive bridge loans (a normal practice in healthy banking 
systems), banks sell back T-Bills to the CBY.  Members of 
FSVC pointed out that a strong central bank would discourage 
this practice, which should not be one of its core functions. 
 The CBY purchases T-Bills at near market price, however, so 
there is little incentive for the banks to change this 
practice. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Draft Banking Law to Strengthen Central Bank 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Ulafi was optimistic the draft banking law (when 
passed) would give the CBY new powers to remove incompetent 
bank management, even at private banks.   Ulafi said that the 
World Bank had advised the CBY and Ministry of Finance to 
create a new law focusing on non-performing loans and 
low-capitalization and offered to assist in its drafting. 
Ulafi said that while the CBY is independent according to the 
1998 banking law, in practice the powerful Minister of 
Finance regularly interferes with monetary policies. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (SBU) The CBY\'s authority is constrained by the 
interference of the Ministry of Finance and by its role as a 
commercial bank for government employees.  FSVC volunteers 
recommend that the Central Bank cease functioning as a 
commercial bank and focus instead on oversight and management 
of Yemen,s poorly performing banking sector.  Unfortunately, 
the CBY, under the thumb of the Minister of Finance, seems to 
be moving in the opposite direction.  The ROYG has moved the 
direct deposit of public salaries from commercial banks back 
to the CBY, where they are paid in cash.  This perpetuates 
Yemen\'s cash economy and maintains MOF\'s control over payroll 
(which is often abused).  The CBY is even considering 
installing its own ATM machines.  MOF is also looking to 
expand its reach into the insurance and accounting sectors. 
These actions increase MOF\'s involvement with the CBY and 
serve to weaken its focus on performing core functions.  End 
Comment.

TAGS: EAGR, EAID, SENV, TBIO, YM, ENVIRONMENT/S&T 
SUBJECT: YEMEN REPORT - ACCESS TO GENETIC RESOURCES AND 
BENEFIT SHARING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 269625 
 
1. Per request in reftel and in preparation for the February 
2004 Seventh Conference of the Parties of the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD), EconCommoff interviewed the CBD 
point of contact for Yemen, Mahmoud M. Shidiwah, Chairman of 
the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), and Dr. Mohamed 
Al-Nassiri, Director General of the Agricultural Research and 
Extension Authority (AREA).  A least developed country, Yemen 
is in the embryonic stages of Access and Benefit Sharing 
(ABS) legislation and regulation.  This report will address 
four parts of the study of ABS, Mutually Agreed Terms (MAT), 
and Prior Informed Consent (PIC). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Part 1: LEGISLATION AND REGULATION OF BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
2. Two ROYG interagency committees are responsible for 
dealing with the issue of biological and genetic resources: 
the Genetic Resources Committee, comprised of government 
officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the Agricultural Research and Extension 
Authority (AREA), and the Scientific Committee, comprised of 
university researchers, representatives of 
university-associated research centers, and some government 
officials.  Both Committees have yet to fully address the 
issue of ABS at the national level.  Government officials 
such as EPA Chair Mahmoud Shidiwah and AREA Director General 
Dr. Mohamed Al-Nassiri seek U.S. technical assistance to 
address the legislative and regulatory needs surrounding ABS 
issues in Yemen.  State and local level government agencies 
are not responsible for the issuing of research and 
collection permits. 
 
3. There are no current laws or procedures regulating 
biological and genetic resources in Yemen, with the exception 
of EPA bylaws regulation the biological resources of Socotra, 
a large inhabited island in the Red Sea off Yemen\'s coast.  A 
1995 Environmental Protection Law is the only national 
legislation under which genetic resources and their 
regulation might fall, but the issues are not specifically 
mentioned in the law.  The interagency committees are looking 
into extending the existing regulatory bylaws for Socotra to 
the rest of the Red Sea, as well as mainland Yemen, but no 
current laws or procedures regulating the biological and 
genetic resources of the rest of the country. 
 
4. Researchers interested in working with Socotra\'s resources 
must submit a research proposal to the EPA.  The proposal 
must specify the research plan, aim, expected results, 
methodology, and equipment to be used.  With the proposal, 
the researcher must provide a letter of recommendation for 
their proposal from their governing research authority, e.g. 
affiliated university, research center, or company.  The 
Environmental Council, a group of EPA and other government 
officials, deliberate on the proposal for a maximum of two 
weeks before giving their approval or refusal.  If the 
Environmental Council approves the research study, then the 
researchers must sign an agreement with the EPA to comply 
with the terms outlined in the environmental code. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Part 2: MOVEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. Researchers operating in Socotra must register all 
biological specimens they intend to remove from the Island. 
Specimens may not be used for commercial purposes. 
Conditions regarding non-CITES export appear fairly simple. 
Only dead specimens of fauna, including insects, can be 
exported.  For flora, the reproductive capability of the 
plant must be removed.  The EPA submits a letter to airport 
and customs authorities to accompany the specimens out of the 
country.  For non-CITES import conditions, no foreign species 
can be brought to Socotra Island except for circus animals. 
A health certificate must accompany all imported species. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Part 3: NEGOTIATING MAT ACCESS AND USE OF GENETIC RESOURCES 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
6. Researches working in Socotra must list the species and 
number of specimens they intend to remove from Socotra.  Then 
the EPA branch in Socotra must approve the list. 
 
7. The government divides the regulation of research of 
biogenetic resources between two agencies: the Ministry of 
Agriculture governs agricultural research and the EPA governs 
all other biological research.  No clear regulations 
regarding commercial research and development exist. 
(Comment: In reality there is little or no regulation of the 
activities of foreign researchers in Yemen.  The ROYG has 
neither the resources nor expertise to supervise or regulate 
foreign researchers.  End comment.) 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Part 4: STATUS OF MAT AND PIC IN YEMEN 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. ROYG officials are not well informed on ABS, MAT and PIC 
issues.  EPA Chair Shidiwah could not easily identify the 
national authority responsible for negotiating specific 
contracts to provide access to genetic resources, either for 
research or for commercial purposes.  It does not appear that 
EPA or AREA has dealt with any such cases to date.  According 
to Shidiwah, he and other government officials are still 
uncertain how to approach this issue, and there are no 
provisions in place to receive financial benefits from ABS 
contracts or to establish conservation trust funds.  The ROYG 
makes available copies of bylaws and a simple contract 
between the EPA and researchers.  Those seeking general 
information on research, collection, import and export 
permits should contact the EPA offices directly:

SUBJECT: COMMERCIAL BANKS IN YEMEN: WHOM CAN THEY LEND TO? 
 
REF: SANAA 56 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Nabeel Khoury for reasons 1.5 b and d. 
 
1. (U) Summary.  Commercial banks are underutilized in Yemen, 
slowing the flow of capital and preventing investment in 
domestic development.  Few Yemenis deposit their savings with 
banks, and loans are available only to an elite few.  The 
lack of lending stems from a weak judicial system, poorly 
defined property rights, the absence of a viable credit 
rating system, and mutual suspicion between banks.  During a 
MEPI-sponsored visit by the Financial Services Volunteer 
Corps, the delegation visited most of Yemen,s major 
commercial banks, as well as the Ministry of Finance, the 
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY), and the Aden Development 
Authority (CBY meetings covered reftel). End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Banks irrelevant to most Yemenis 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Banking in Yemen is still in its infancy and well 
below international banking sector standards.  There are 
currently 17 commercial banks, four of which are Islamic and 
four that are government owned.  Of these, only the 
International Bank of Yemen, Tadhamun, Arab Bank, and the 
Calyon investment bank can be considered credible banking 
institutions.  The others lack basic capital requirements, 
the technical capacity to link their branches, or the 
management expertise to do core banking.  The capital base of 
most Yemeni banks is small, and only three percent of Yemenis 
hold bank accounts.  There are a total of 500,000 accounts in 
all of Yemen\'s banks combined, and many of these belong to 
the same customers.  Trust in banks is growing, but low 
incomes, a cash economy, and the inefficiency of the banking 
system make banks irrelevant to most Yemeni citizens. 
 
3. (U) Lending makes up only a very small part of commercial 
banking in Yemen.  For instance, loans make up only about six 
percent of the National Bank of Yemen\'s (NBY) portfolio 
(formerly the Central Bank of South Yemen).  Arab Bank lends 
only eight percent of total deposits.  The NBY, like other 
Yemeni banks, makes the bulk of its investments, 
approximately 80 percent, in government T-bills).  Barring a 
complete collapse of the government, these guaranteed 
investments provide return without risk.  Contrary to 
statements by the CBY (reftel), Ahmed Hamdani, Chairman of 
Watani Bank, believes that T-bills dry up investments in 
other projects.  Loans in Yemen are approved mostly for trade 
financing and not for smaller investments, such as home or 
small business loans.  Almost all loans are short-term, 
usually a year or less, with high interest rates (over 20 
percent, with a margin of 10-15 percent), making it difficult 
for small borrowers to finance investments.  Businesses 
familiar to the banks are able to obtain automatic renewals 
of short-term loans, allowing them to finance larger 
investments. 
 
-------------------- 
Obstacles to Lending 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) Bankers and ROYG officials agree that the biggest 
obstacle to lending is a weak judicial system.  Banks have 
little confidence that they will be able to collect on 
delinquent loans when they know such cases may be tied up in 
court for as long as ten years.  Even when the courts rule in 
their favor, the authorities generally do not enforce 
collection.  Mahdi Alawi, Director of Arab Bank in Yemen, 
claimed that judges are corrupt, saying a standard bribe is 
10 percent of the final award.  Even honest judges will often 
rule that charging interest is against Islam and award 
lenders only the principle of the loan. 
 
------------- 
Mafia Tactics 
------------- 
 
5. (C) Because of these obstacles, executives at the 
International Bank of Yemen (IBY) confessed that they have 
resorted to \"mafia tactics\" to collect outstanding loans. 
There is a Bank Arbitration Center in Sanaa, which is 
supposed to conduct extra-judicial mediation, but Ahmed 
al-Absi of IBY said that since borrowers know they can get 
off the hook in court, it is not widely utilized.  As a 
result, banks lend almost entirely to customers they know 
personally.  Alawi contended that Yemen needs an entirely new 
generation of judges that are both honest and schooled in 
modern commercial law.  The Ministry of Finance also 
acknowledged this problem to FSVC and suggested special 
banking courts with non-Yemeni judges. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Possession is Nine-Tenths of the Law 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (U) Since property titles are often duplicated or 
disputed; there is no reliable form of collateral in Yemen. 
Such property disputes are often resolved by force.  The ROYG 
has not passed a specific law on property and, according to 
Alawi, Yemen is the only country where it is considered 
against Islam to use land as collateral.  Property holdings 
are not recognized by the CBY when it calculates a bank\'s 
capital ratio (the hard assets a bank has against its 
liabilities) and the CBY decides how much risk a bank may 
take on.  Since the ROYG does not recognize the legal value 
of property, neither do banks. 
 
7. (C) Banks have few tools to determine the credibility of 
its customers.  Most businesses in Yemen practice poor 
accounting.  Officials at all the banks agreed that local 
CPAs and tax auditors are widely considered untrustworthy and 
corrupt, willing to falsify balance sheets in exchange for 
bribes.  There is also no functioning credit bureau.  The CBY 
keeps a blacklist on borrowers who have defaulted, and 
commercial banks are required to provide this information to 
the CBY, but the system is not effective.  The list only 
includes bad loans of over 5 million riyals, so there is no 
information on small borrowers.  According to Alawi, powerful 
figures sometimes physically threaten officials of the CBY 
and private banks in order to keep their names off the list. 
Hamdani confirmed this, saying that an independent credit 
bureau is similarly impossible because of the potential for 
tribal violence in response to bad ratings.  Without a 
centralized credit bureau, each bank must rely on its own 
records, which it is unlikely to share. 
 
8. (U) Alawi said in many cases banks are their own worst 
enemies, lending to bad borrowers because of personal 
friendships, or for fear of losing customers to other banks. 
The Banking Law forbids insider lending, but this is rarely 
enforced in the case of character loans. 
 
-------------------------- 
No lending, no Development 
-------------------------- 
 
9. (U) Ahmed Ghaleb at the MOF boasted that because of the 
Ministry,s 1997-8 reforms, all Yemeni banks are now liquid. 
However, liquidity is no longer the main problem.  By law, 
banks are required to be 30 percent liquid, but most are 
between 60-70 percent because they cannot find reliable 
places to lend the money they have.  This means that Yemeni 
banks are sitting on cash that could be used to stimulate the 
dormant economy through lending. 
 
10. (U) Officials at the MOF and the CBY say that commercial 
banks are hurting development with their unwillingness to 
take any risk through lending.  There are few viable 
businesses, however, to which banks can lend.  Applicants 
rarely have collateral or feasibility studies for their 
investments.  Most are one-man-shows that depend on personal 
relationships to obtain loans or credit.  Alawi said that the 
ROYG could improve this by establishing real property 
registries and passing a leasing financing law.  That law is 
currently being drafted at the CBY, but Alawi remained 
pessimistic about its implementation. 
 
11. (C) Development is also hampered by a lack of trust 
between individual banks, which are afraid to reveal their 
financial status and therefore will not lend to each other 
(reftel).  Alawi believes this distrust could be eliminated 
if the CBY had a competent oversight capacity and its 
auditors were not subject to corruption.  (Note:  The CBY 
inspects the banks annually, but their techniques are 
predictable and little information is released to the public. 
End Note.) 
 
12. (U) Banks have difficulty undertaking joint financing of 
large development projects, and as result they are generally 
funded from abroad.  This problem is evident in Aden, where 
Yemeni banks are unable to finance private development 
projects for the Aden Port and the Aden Free Zone, both 
critical to Yemen\'s economic future.  Representatives of Aden 
banks formed a committee to tackle this problem, but 
according to Mohamed al-Muflehi at the Aden Local Development 
Office, so far the banks have failed to overcome their mutual 
distrust.  The lack of cooperation is especially evident in 
the bankers associations, each of which Hamdani reports, 
operates like the personal domain of the powerful banking 
families.  Such rivalry prevents the associations from 
reforming their own practices or lobbying the ROYG. 
 
------------------------- 
Attempts at Modernization 
------------------------- 
 
13. (U) Comment: Yemen\'s major banks are attempting to find 
strategies to encourage Yemenis to use the banking system. 
NBY is offering new high-yield investment funds.  Watani is 
looking to offer 2-3 year medium-term loans to small and 
medium-sized businesses.  IBY is opening ATMs and launching 
point-of-sale purchases as well as debit cards.  Many banks 
are offering Islamic lending products (common in GCC 
countries) as a means of avoiding prohibitions against 
interest.  Some banks now cooperate with government 
ministries to offer medium-term loans, with monthly 
deductions taken directly from employees\' paychecks.  These 
efforts, however necessary and well meaning, are unlikely to 
have much of an impact without major improvements in the 
financial system, including rule-of-law, effective CBY 
oversight and modernization, and a viable credit system to 
support lending.  End Comment.

to the Iraqi elections, discussions focused on relations 
between the ROYG and its opposition in Parliament and media,

Iraqi Elections 
--------------- 
 
2. (C) CDA delivered ref A demarche points to Prime Deputy 
Foreign Minister Dhabbi on January 8, emphasizing the need 
for ROYG support for the political process in Iraq.  Dhabbi 
listened to the message without comment, but affirmed that 
the ROYG plans to send election observers.  (Comment: 
President Saleh advised visiting General Abizaid that the 
elections should be postponed pending greater dialogue with 
Sunni elements to ensure their participation in the 
elections, ref B.  While a public statement of support for 
the January 30 date is not likely, MFA officials affirm ROYG 
policy is to support the political process in Iraq, saying 
that the alternative would be disastrous for the entire 
region.  End Comment). 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
ROYG - Opposition Relations are \"Boiling...\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Dhabbi told CDA that that the government\'s relations 
with opposition elements are extremely tense.  He attributed 
tensions to ROYG efforts to push through tough but necessary 
economic reforms and said the opposition is taking advantage 
of public apprehension about the cost of reforms by \"playing 
a very negative role.\"  Our relations with the opposition are 
\"boiling,\" Dhabbi complained, \"and at the same we are trying 
to fight terrorism and arrest terrorist suspects.\"  Implying 
that the ROYG takes considerable heat from the opposition for 
its partnership with the U.S. in the GWOT, Dhabbi raised the 
reason he had asked for this meeting: \"When diplomats and 
foreigners talk frequently to opposition leaders and 
journalists, he told CDA, \"you give them the impression that 
they have your support.\"  CDA responded that the Embassy 
maintains relationships and has routine contact with members 
of the opposition and the press as a matter of course, and 
that we would continue to do so.  Dhabbi replied that he 
understood, but complained that when U.S. diplomats meet 
with, for example, the press syndicate and discuss the case 
of jailed journalist Khaiwani (ref C), \"they take this to 
mean you support them against the government.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Khaiwani Prosecuted According to the Law 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Dhabbi confided to CDA that he personally, along with 
others in the ROYG, did not agree with the jailing of 
Khaiwani, however, the as-Shura editor was tried and 
imprisoned according to the law.  The DFM said that the ROYG 
was working on amendments to the Press Law, including banning 
the arrest of journalists for expression, but said it would 
take some time for a new law to be drafted and approved.  CDA 
responded that the Embassy\'s position on Khaiwani\'s continued 
imprisonment was clear -- \"it\'s a bad idea.  Those calling 
for Khaiwani\'s release do have our moral support even if we 
have so far refrained from making a public comment on the 
issue.\"  CDA told Dhabbi that the U.S. remains concerned 
about the Khaiwani case, as well as the arrest, detention and 
intimidation of other journalists.  He told Dhabbi that these 
events represent a government crackdown on the media dating 
back to the al-Houthi insurgency last summer.  It is damaging 
to Yemen\'s reputation in the international community, advised 
CDA, and may affect qualification for the MCA and other 
international development assistance programs. 
 
------ 
SA/LWs 
------ 
 
5. (S) CDA raised U.S. concerns about SA/LWs proliferation in 
Yemen, pointing out that despite Saleh\'s repeated pledges, 
arms dealers continue to pursue weapons deals on behalf of 
the ROYG that far exceed the needs of the Yemeni Armed 
Forces.  Dhabbi said that following A/S Bloomfield\'s meeting 
with Saleh last September, the President declared it illegal 
for dealers to buy weapons from eastern European or FSU 
countries.  Nevertheless, pressed CDA, this practice is 
occurring as we speak, and the only reason to bring in excess 
arms into Yemen is to sell them on the regional black market. 
 These weapons end up in terrorist hands, said CDA, and the 
USG remains prepared to help Yemen close this revolving door 
and get control of its weapons smuggling problem.  Dhabbi 
agreed the issue must be tackled. \"Those people,\" he said, 
\"are making fortunes regardless of the damage to Yemen.\" 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Abizaid\'s Luggage/Communications Equipment 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) CDA told Dhabbi that although the General\'s meetings 
with President Saleh and ROYG military officials went quite 
well, the visit was in many ways dominated by the refusal of 
the Yemeni authorities to clear the party\'s communications 
equipment.  CDA characterized the incident as disturbing, 
demonstrating the level of the ROYG\'s mistrust for the U.S. 
Dhabbi said he had heard about the incident after General 
Abizaid had departed, and that there seems to have been some 
confusion over the unusual amount of equipment accompanying 
Abizaid.  CDA said that it was not unusual at all for General 
Abizaid to have his personal communications equipment when 
overnighting off base.  CDA added that General Abizaid will 
be reluctant to make another overnight visit to Yemen in the 
near future. 
 
7. (C) Dhabbi disputed that the luggage fiasco was intended 
as a political message from the highest levels of the ROYG, 
it was, he insisted the unfortunate result of the Yemeni 
bureaucratic \"mentality.\"  We are not accustomed to anyone 
but the President traveling with such equipment, he said. 
Dhabbi suggested that next time the Embassy work face-to-face 
with the MFA, in addition to submitting all the necessary 
paperwork to customs authorities.  CDA responded that we 
would do so, however, we do interpret the decision to hold 
the luggage and equipment as emanating from the highest 
levels of the ROYG, and that it was not taken well here or in 
Washington and may well have unfortunate repercussions. 
 
8. (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Noman, a western-leaning 
reformer, agreed it was an appalling incident.  In a January 
9 meeting with Pol/Econ Chief he reported that both FM Qirbi 
and Presidential Advisor Iryani were in the room with 
President Saleh when he gave the green light to release all 
of Abizaid party\'s luggage and equipment.  Noman said that 
according to Iryani, Saleh\'s words were, \"let it all in, just 
make sure that it all leaves with him.\"  Noman said it was 
possible, however, that the President said this only to 
appease Qirbi and Iryani, or that someone else later 
convinced him to reverse his decision.  Noman agreed with 
Dhabbi\'s assessment that it is ultimately a problem of 
\"mentality.\" 
 
9. (C) Comment.  Post has become accustomed to occasional 
injunctions against meeting with the opposition, injunctions 
which reflect increased sensitivity on behalf of the ROYG to 
the activism of the opposition and the impact of this 
activism on Yemen\'s international image.  ROYG\'s acting out 
against the opposition by trying to intimidate the media, and 
letting their suspicions of the USG get the better of them by 
holding up a VIP\'s personal luggage and equipment is self 
defeating and harms both their image and interests in the 
international community.  End Comment.
