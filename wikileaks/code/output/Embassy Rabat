(1) MOROCCO

(2) RELATIONSHIP WITH PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION: 
THE PLO HAS HAD A DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN RABAT SINCE 
1971.  GOM-PLO RELATIONS SOURED IN 1987 OVER THE SEATING 
OF A POLISARIO REPRESENTATIVE AT THE PALESTINIAN 
NATIONAL COUNCIL MEETING IN ALGIERS, RESULTING IN THE 
DOWNGRADING OF RELATIONS AND DEPARTURE OF PLO BUREAU 
CHIEF ABOU MARWAN.  RELATIONS WERE NOT BROKEN, HOWEVER, 
AND PLO RABAT BUREAU ACTING CHIEF MOHAMMED AL-ALAMI 
PRESIDES OVER A STAFF OF A HALF DOZEN, INCLUDING A PRESS 
ATTACHE, TWO SECURITY OFFICERS AND TWO SECRETARY- 
COMMUNICATORS.  THE BUREAU\'S ACTIVITIES, WHICH 
ARE MONITORED BY THE GOM, INCLUDE THE SUPPORT OF 
PALESTINIANS STUDYING IN MOROCCO AND PROMOTION OF PLO 
VIEWPOINTS IN THE MOROCCAN MEDIA.  EXPATRIATE PLO BUREAU 
STAFF MEMBERS ENJOY DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES AND ARE 
ACTIVE INTHE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY.  ACCORDING TO 
KNOWLEDGEABLE SOURCES, THE BUREAU MAKES EVERY EFFORT 
TO STAY OUT OF INTERNAL MOROCCAN POLITICS AND, TO THE 
BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, TAKES NO PART IN ANY ACTIVITY 
RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IN KEEPING WITH 
THIS POLICY, THE LOCAL BUREAU WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE 
CASE OF A PLO SPLINTER GROUP, INVOLVING FOUR TERRORISTS 
WHO CAME FROM TUNISIA IN AUGUST 1986 AND WERE PROMPTLY 
ARRESTED IN CASABLANCA.

REF:  A) STATE 363024, B) STATE 31797 
 
1.  FOLLOWING IS POST\'S CONTRIBUTION TO DEPARTMENT\'S 
ANNUAL REPORT ON TERRORISM: 
 
IN 1989 THE UNITED STATES AND MOROCCO SIGNED AN 
AGREEMENT ON JOINT COOPERATION IN FIGHTING AGAINST 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, ORGANIZED CRIME AND THE 
ILLICIT PRODUCTION, TRAFFICKING AND ABUSE OF 
NARCOTICS (REF B).  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF 
THIS AGREEMENT, THE UNITED STATES HAS ENJOYED EXCELLENT 
COOPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO IN COUNTERING 
TERRORISM. 
 
IN 1983 THE UNITED STATES AND MOROCCO NEGOTIATED A 
MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE CONVENTION (WHICH INCLUDES 
EXTRADITION PROVISIONS).  THE AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED 
BY THE UNITED STATES, BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN SIGNED BY 
MOROCCO. 
 
MOROCCO SUFFERED FROM LIBYAN SUPPORTED DOMESTIC 
TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES, BUT AS A 
RESULT OF A CHANGING DOMESTIC/REGIONAL POLITICAL 
ENVIRONMENT, THERE IS NO LONGER ANY SIGNIFICANT 
THREAT OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED TERRORISM IN MOROCCO. 
THE GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO, AND KING HASSAN II PERSONALLY, 
ARE ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM.  THE PLO HAS MAIN- 
TAINED DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION IN MOROCCO SINCE 1971, 
AND MOROCCO CONTINUES TO PROVIDE STRONG DIPLOMATIC AND 
POLITICAL BACKING FOR ARAFAT AND THE PLO MAINSTREAM. 
MOROCCO COUNSELS MODERATION TO THE PLO, AND MOROCCAN 
POLICY SEEKS TO PROMOTE A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT TO 
THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT.  THE MOROCCAN GOVERNMENT, 
THEREFORE, DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY KIND OF SUPPORT  FOR 
TERRORIST GROUPS, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE PLO 
UMBRELLA. 
 
THERE WERE NO ACTS OF TERRORISM IN MOROCCO IN 1989, AND 
SO, NO PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING TERRORISM.

REF:    STATE 346420 
 
1.  POST RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS LISTED IN REFTEL PARA 
5. 
 
A)  THERE WERE NO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM THIS YEAR.  THE MOROCCAN JUDICIARY HAS 
CHARGED 29 STUDENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST 
ORGANIZATION \"JUSTICE AND CHARITY\" AT OUJDA UNIVERSITY WITH THE 
KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF AT LEAST TWO STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY 
IN EARLY NOVEMBER. 
 
B)  NO EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WERE CARRIED OUT OR 
REQUESTED IN 1991. 
 
C)  THERE ARE NO IMPEDIMENTS TO GOM PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS. 
MOROCCO DOES NOT HAVE AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE U.S., BUT 
WOULD LIKELY COOPERATE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH ANY REQUEST 
FOR THE EXTRADITION OF A TERRORIST. 
 
D)  THE MOROCCAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED A 
WILLINGNESS TO RESPOND TO SECURITY CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY THOSE 
INVOLVING POTENTIAL TERRORIST THREATS.  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
GULF WAR, THE GOM UNDERTOOK EXCEPTIONAL SECURITY MEASURES TO 
PREEMPT POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIONS IN MOROCCO, AND PROVIDED 
ENHANCED SECURITY FOR U.S. FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL.  THE GOM, 
HOWEVER, PREFERS TO HANDLE THESE ISSUES QUIETLY AND DOES NOT 
GENERALLY ISSUE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON SECURITY MATTERS. 
 
E)  THE GOM PARTICIPATES AS AN OBSERVER IN THE ANNUAL MINISTERIAL 
CONFERENCE OF THE TREVI GROUP.  THE GOM ALSO PARTICIPATED IN 
SEPTEMBER 1990 IN A REVIEW OF THE U.S.-MOROCCO BILATERAL 
AGREEMENT ON COUNTERTERRORISM, NARCOTICS AND ORGANIZED CRIME, 
PART OF AN ONGOING BILATERAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES 
ON COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES. 
 
F)  THE GOM DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, EITHER 
RHETORICALLY OR MATERIALLY. 
 
G)  MOROCCO IS LINKED TO LIBYA BY BOTH COUNTRIES\' MEMBERSHIP IN 
THE ARAB MAGHREB UNION, AS WELL AS BY EXTENSIVE COMMERCIAL TIES. 
 
THE GOM HAS SOUGHT THE LIFTING OF SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA, BUT 
HAS NOT SUPPORTED LIBYA ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.  MOROCCO STRONGLY 
SUPPORTS THE PALESTINIANS\' CLAIM TO SELF-DETERMINATION, AND 
CONSIDERS THE PLO TO BE THE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  MOROCCO HAS LONG WORKED TO MODERATE THE PLO, 
HOWEVER, AND SUPPORTS A PEACEFUL, NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT OF THE 
ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT.  THE GOM ENCOURAGES THE PLO TO LIVE UP TO 
ITS COMMITMENT TO RENOUNCE TERRORISM. 
 
H)  THE GOM DEMONSTRATED HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY TO TERRORIST 
THREATS RESULTING FROM THE GULF WAR.  THIS HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY 
HAS CONTINUED INTO THE POST-WAR PERIOD, RESULTING IN INCREASED 
RESPONSIVENESS TO USG SECURITY CONCERNS.  THE GOM IS ALSO 
INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM, BOTH AS THE RESULT OF EXTREMIST OPPOSITION TO MIDDLE 
EAST PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AND THE RECENT STUDENT VIOLENCE BETWEEN 
ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST AND LEFTIST STUDENT FACTIONS.

A.  WE ARE AWARE OF NO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN 1992. 
 
B.  WE KNOW OF NO EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS THAT WERE 
CARRIED OUT OR REQUESTED IN 1992. 
 
C.  THERE ARE NO IMPEDIMENTS TO GOM PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS. 
MOROCCO DOES NOT HAVE AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE U.S., BUT 
WOULD LIKELY COOPERATE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH ANY REQUEST 
FOR THE EXTRADITION OF A TERRORIST. 
 
D.  THE GOM HAS CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS TO 
RESPOND TO SECURITY CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING 
POTENTIAL TERRORIST THREATS.  IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, THE GOM 
PREFERS TO HANDLE THESE ISSUES QUIETLY AND DOES NOT ISSUE PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS ON SECURITY ISSUES.  IN APRIL 1992 MOROCCAN 
REPRESENTATIVES TO THE UNSC DID PUBLICLY CONDEMN THE ATTACK BY AN 
ORGANIZED MOB ON THE VENEZUELAN EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI, WHICH 
FOLLOWED THE PASSAGE OF UN SECURITY COUNCIL (UNSC) RESOLUTION 
731.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THE GOM REPRESENTATIVES URGED 
THAT THE UNSC TAKE NOTE OF LIBYAN PROMISES TO BRING TO JUSTICE 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE, PROVIDE COMPENSATION AND OFFER PROTECTION IN 
THE FUTURE.  IN SEPTEMBER 1992 THE MOROCCAN PRESS REPORTED THAT 
THE GOM HAD PROTESTED TO SUDANESE AUTHORITIES (AUG/SEP 92) THE 
PRESENCE OF MOROCCAN OPPOSITION ELEMENTS IN SUPPOSED IRANIAN 
BACKED TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS IN SUDAN. 
 
E.  THE GOM PARTICIPATES AS AN OBSERVER IN THE ANNUAL MINISTERIAL 
CONFERENCE OF THE TREVI GROUP.  THE U.S. AND MOROCCO MAINTAIN AN 
ONGOING BILATERAL DIALOGUE ON COUNTER-TERRORISM ISSUES. 
 
F.  THE GOM DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, EITHER 
RHETORICALLY OR MATERIALLY.  MOROCCANS ARE ALWAYS PROUD TO 
ANNOUNCE THAT NO TERRORIST INCIDENT HAS EVER OCCURRED IN MOROCCO. 
 
MOROCCO STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE PALESTINIANS\' CLAIM TO SELF- 
DETERMINATION AND CONSIDERS THE PLO THE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE 
OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  MOROCCO HAS LONG WORKED TO MODERATE 
THE PLO, HOWEVER, AND SUPPORTS A PEACEFUL, NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT 
OF THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT.  MOROCCO HAS REGULAR HIGH-LEVEL 
CONTACT WITH THE PLO LEADERSHIP.  THE GOM ENCOURAGES THE PLO TO 
LIVE UP TO ITS COMMITMENT TO RENOUNCE TERRORISM AND PARTICIPATE 
FULLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS. 
 
G.  THE GOM HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, NORTH KOREA OR SYRIA ON TERRORISM ISSUES. 
NEITHER HAS THE GOM EVER MADE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
LIBYA ON TERRORISM ISSUES, BUT THE GOM HAS OFTEN STATED ITS 
BELIEF THAT LIBYA HAS REFORMED ITS WAYS AND ABANDONED SUPPORT FOR 
TERRORISM, AND THAT THE U.S. AND U.K. SHOULD ENTER INTO DIALOGUE 
WITH LIBYA.  MOROCCO ABSTAINED FROM THE UNSC\'S VOTE ON RESOLUTION 
731 ON 31 MARCH 1992 AND APPARENTLY RAISED NO OBJECTIONS TO THE 
MAGHREB ARAB UNION\'S NOVEMBER 11 SUMMIT COMMUNIQUE CONTAINING 
LANGUAGE URGING THE UNSC TO \"RECONSIDER\" ITS SANCTIONS STANCE 
AGAINST LIBYA. 
 
H.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDE ON THE 
PART OF THE GOM SINCE 1991. IT REMAINS OPPOSED TO TERRORISM. 
 
I.  MOROCCO IS LINKED TO LIBYA BY BOTH COUNTRIES\'S MEMBERSHIP IN 
THE ARAB MAGHREB UNION, AS WELL AS BY EXTENSIVE COMMERCIAL TIES. 
 
PARTLY BECAUSE OF THESE TIES, THE GOM HAS SOUGHT THE LIFTING OF 
SANCTIONS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME FOLLOWING MOST OF THEM.  WE 
RECALL THAT LAST JANUARY, MOROCCO AS A UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
MEMBER, VOTED FOR THE SANCTIONS RESOLUTION AGAINST LIBYA.  ALL 
FLIGHTS BETWEEN MOROCCO AND LIBYA CEASED AS OF 15 APRIL.  THE 
LIBYAN AIRLINES OFFICE IN CASABLANCA REMAINS OPEN, BUT DOES NOT 
SELL TICKETS OR BOOK RESERVATIONS TO LIBYA.  THE LIBYAN 
DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE (18 LIBYAN DIPLOMATS AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
PERSONNEL) IN RABAT, HOWEVER, HAS NOT BEEN REDUCED.  APPARENTLY 
THE GOM IS CONCERNED THAT AN EFFORT TO FORCE A REDUCTION IN THE 
LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE WOULD RESULT IN LIBYAN RETALIATION, 
WHICH WOULD IN TURN IMPACT ON THE GOM\'S ABILITY TO PROTECT 
MOROCCAN RESIDENTS IN LIBYA.  (COMMENT:  THE GOM CLAIMS THAT 
THERE ARE CA. 100,000 MOROCCANS LIVING IN LIBYA.)

TERRORISM REPORT. 
 
KING MOHAMMED VI AND THE GOM STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE 
ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11 AND HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF 
THE ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST AL-QAIDA AND THE TALIBAN. 
FOLLOWING THE ATTACKS, KING MOHAMMED PLEDGED MOROCCO\'S 
FULL COOPERATION IN THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM. 
 
AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS SUPPORT, THE GOM SIGNED THE UN 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE 
FINANCING OF TERRORISM ON SEPTEMBER 24, AND IT IS 
COMPLYING WITH UNSCR RESOLUTIONS ON TERRORIST FINANCING. 
 
B)  THER WERE NO THWARTED TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR 
TERRORIT CELLS DISRUPTED BY THE GOM THAT WERE MADE 
PUBLICLY KNOWN IN 2001.  HISTORICALLY, THE GOM HAS BEEN 
EXTREMELY VIGILANT IN REGARD TO SUSPECT TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES AND HAS STRONGLY REACTED TO POTENTIAL 
THREATS.  IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
IS LARGELY UNHEARD OF IN MOROCCO. 
 
C)  IN 2001, THE GOM DID NOT ISSUE ANY SIGNIFICANT NEW 
LAWS CONCERNING TERRORISM.  THE PENAL CODE REGARDING 
SUSPECT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAS ALWAYS WEIGHED HEAVILY 
TOWARDS SECURITY CONCERNS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO 
U.S. INTERESTS IN MOROCCO. 
 
D)  THERE WERE NO REQUESTS ON THE PART OF THE GOM FOR 
THE EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN 2001. 
 
E)  ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN THE 
USG AND GOM, POST DOES NOT PERCEIVE THERE WOULD BE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO GOM PROSECUTION AND/OR 
EXTRADITION OF KNOWN TERRORIST THAT ARE NOT MOROCAN 
NATIONALS. 
 
F)  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, KING 
MOHAMMED ISSUED A STRONG PUBLIC CONDEMNATION AGAINST 
THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THE ATTACKS AND TERRORIST ACTS IN 
GENERAL.  THE GOM TRADITIONALLY ISSUES PUBLIC STATEMENTS

CLASSIFIED BY: DCM HELEN LA LIME.  REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  COMMENTING ON THE MAY 16 BOMBINGS ON 
MOROCCAN TELEVISION MAY 18, PM DRISS JETTOU INDIRECTLY 
CRITICIZED THE LEGAL ISLAMIST JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY 
(PJD), AS WELL AS THE LEFTIST MOROCCAN HUMAN RIGHTS 
ASSOCIATION (AMDH), FOR THEIR PAST CRITICISM OF THE 
GOVERNMENT OVER ALLEGED MISTREATMENT OF DETAINEES BELONGING 
TO WHAT JETTOU CALLED \"THE SALAFIYAH JIHADIYAH MOVEMENT.\" 
ALSO MAY 18, JUSTICE MINISTER MOHAMED BOUZOUBAA ASSOCIATED 
THE MAY 16 BOMBINGS WITH THE GROUP \"SIRAT AL MOUSTAQIM\" (THE 
RIGHT PATH).  SALAFIYAH JIHADIYAH AND SIRAT AL MOUSTAQIM, 
ALONG WITH \"TAKFIR WAL HIJRA\" (RENUNCIATION AND REPUDIATION), 
ARE TERMS USED BY THE PRESS AND SOMETIMES THE GOVERNMENT TO 
DESCRIBE VIOLENT ISLAMIST FRINGE GROUPS, WHICH BURST ONTO THE 
SCENE IN MOROCCO WITH A SERIES OF VIOLENT ACTS IN 2002 
LEADING TO A NUMBER OF ARRESTS (REFTELS).  WHILE MANY 
MOROCCANS HAVE BEEN HORRIFIED BY THE NATURE OF THE CRIMES 
ATTRIBUTED TO THESE GROUPS, AND THE PJD HAS REGULARLY ACCUSED 
THE GOM OF MISTREATING DETAINEES IN THE NAME OF COUNTERING 
THEM, CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HAS MAINTAINED THAT (1) SUCH GROUPS 
HAD NO NATIONAL ORGANIZATION, LEADERSHIP, OR CHAIN OF 
COMMAND, NO LINKS WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH FOREIGN 
ORGANIZATIONS, AND ESSENTIALLY CONSISTED OF DISORGANIZED, 
RAGTAG BANDS, AND (2) THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD THE THREAT 
WELL IN HAND.  THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY HAVE TO BE REVISED, IF 
THE MAY 16 BOMBERS TURN OUT TO BE DRAWN FROM THIS FRINGE, AS 
THE STATEMENTS BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND JUSTICE MINISTER 
SEEM TO INDICATE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  IN TELEVISED COMMENTS MAY 18, PRIME MINISTER DRISS 
JETTOU CRITICIZED, WITHOUT NAMING THEM, THOSE WHO, IN THE 
NAME OF HUMAN RIGHTS, HAD CRITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS 
HANDLING OF THE RECENT TRIALS OF MEMBERS OF THE \"SALAFIYAH 
JIHADIYAH MOVEMENT.\"  ALSO IN TELEVISED COMMENTS THE SAME 
DAY, JUSTICE MINISTER MOHAMED BOUZOUBAA SAID THAT SOME OF THE 
MAY 17 TERRORISTS WERE LINKED TO A GROUP CALLED \"SIRAT AL 
MOUSTAQIM\" (THE RIGHT PATH).  THE PRECISE MEANINGS OF THE 
TERMS \"SALAFIYAH JIHADIYAH\" AND \"SIRAT AL MOUSTAQIM\" CAN BE 
DIFFICULT TO DEVINE, AS THEY TEND TO BE USED INTERCHANGEABLY 
IN THE MEDIA AND BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO REFER TO A 
VIOLENT ISLAMIST FRINGE, ON WHICH THE EMBASSY HAS PREVIOUSLY 
REPORTED (SEE REFTELS). 
 
3.  (U)  FOR EXAMPLE, IN FEBRUARY 2002 IN A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD 
OF CASABLANCA, A BAND OF RELIGIOUS FANATICS OPERATING UNDER 
THE NAME \"SIRAT AL MOUSTAQIM,\" LED BY SPIRITUAL LEADER 
MILOUDI ZAKARIA, STONED TO DEATH A RESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT 
WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY QUARRELED WITH A MEMBER OF THE BAND OVER 
THE ISSUE OF ALCOHOL USE BY THE VICTIM.  ZAKARIA AND 13 
COMPANIONS WERE TRIED AND CONVICTED IN CASABLANCA FOR THE 
MURDER.  IN MAY 2002 FEZ MOSQUE PREACHER MOHAMED ABDELWAHED 
RAFIKI (ABU HAFS) WAS ARRESTED AND SENTENCED TO SIX MONTHS IN 
PRISON (SUBSEQUENTLY REDUCED TO THREE MONTHS) FOR, AMONG 
OTHER INFRACTIONS, INCITING FOLLOWERS TO ATTACK INDIVIDUALS 
PERCEIVED TO BE BEHAVING IN AN UN-ISLAMIC MANNER.  ABU HAFS 
HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE PRESS AS A LEADER OF THE SALAFIYAH 
JIHADIYAH. 
 
4.  (U)  YOUSSEF FIKRI, DESCRIBED AS THE \"EMIR\" (RELIGIOUS 
LEADER) OF THE SALAFIYAH JIHADIYAH, AND ALSO AS THE LEADER OF 
THE MOVEMENT \"TAKFIR WAL HIJRA\" (RENUNCIATION AND 
REPUDIATION), WAS ARRESTED IN JUNE 2002 ALONG WITH EIGHT 
FOLLOWERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY TRIED FOR A SERIES OF BLOODTHIRSTY 
CRIMES, COMMITTED IN VARIOUS CITIES IN MOROCCO, WHICH 
INCLUDED KILLING VICTIMS AND DISMEMBERING THEM.  (THIS GROUP 
BEGAN A HUNGER STRIKE WHILE IN PRISON IN MAY 2003.)  THE 
COMMON THREAD UNITING MILOUDI\'S, HAFS\', AND FIKRI\'S GROUPS IS 
VIGILANTE ACTION AGAINST INDIVIDUALS PERCEIVED TO BE ENGAGING 
IN UN-ISLAMIC BEHAVIOUR. 
 
5.  (U)  MOST MOROCCANS WERE SHOCKED, NOT ONLY BY THE DETAILS 
OF THESE CRIMES LAST YEAR, BUT ALSO BY THE VERY EXISTENCE OF 
SUCH GROUPS IN THE MOROCCAN BODY POLITIC, HERETOFORE 
UNSUSPECTED.  (AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS HAFS\' ARREST IN MAY 
2002, THE EXISTENCE OF THE AL QAIDA CELL THAT PLANNED ATTACKS 
ON U.S. SHIPPING IN THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR WAS REVEALED.) 
INEVITABLE COMPARISONS WITH ALGERIA CAME UP.  AMONG 
TRADITIONAL ISLAMISTS, HOWEVER, AND PARTICULARLY THE LEGAL 
JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY (PJD), THERE WAS A TENDENCY TO 
SEE THE ARRESTS AND THE NEWS REPORTS AS A PLOT FABRICATED BY 
THE GOVERNMENT TO DISCREDIT ALL ISLAMISTS IN THE RUN-UP TO 
SEPTEMBER 2002 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE 
PJD, JOINED BY THE FAR LEFT, AS REPRESENTED BY THE MOROCCAN 
HUMAN RIGHTS ASSOCIATION (AMDH), KEPT UP A STEADY DRUMBEAT OF 
CRITICISM OF THE GOM FOR ALLEGED MISTREATMENT OF DETAINEES 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE VIOLENT ISLAMIST FRINGE.  IT WAS THESE 
CRITICISMS THAT PM JETTOU REFERRED TO IN HIS COMMENTS OF MAY 
18. 
 
6.  (C)  WHILE SOME MOROCCANS WERE ALARMED BY THE EMERGENCE 
IN MOROCCO OF THE VIOLENT ISLAMIST FRINGE AND OTHERS THOUGHT 
THE WHOLE PHENOMENON A GOM FABRICATION, THERE HAS BEEN UNTIL 
NOW A GENERAL CONSENSUS AROUND TWO MAIN POINTS.  THE FIRST 
WAS THAT THERE WAS NO COHERENT NATIONAL ORGANIZATION TO WHICH 
MEMBERS OF THE FRINGE BELONGED, AND NO OVERALL LEADER OR 
CHAIN OF COMMAND.  THE THINKING WENT THAT THE THREAT, SUCH AS 
IT WAS, WAS POSED BY A FEW RAGTAG BANDS, WITH NO LINKS TO 
EACH OTHER OR TO FOREIGN ORGANIZATIONS.  THE SECOND PIECE OF 
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM WAS THAT THE GOM, AND SPECIFICALLY THE 
INTERIOR MINISTRY, HAD THE GROUPS WELL IN HAND AND UNDER 
CONTROL.  BOTH ASSUMPTIONS WILL NOW HAVE TO BE REVISED, IF 
THE MAY 16 BOMBERS INDEED PROVE TO BE DRAWN FROM THESE 
VIOLENT GROUPS.  WHILE THERE IS MUCH THAT REMAINS TO BE 
REVEALED BY THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER WOULD PUBLICLY 
ASSOCIATE THE SALAFIYAH JIHADIYAH AND THE SIRAT EL MOUSTAQIM 
WITH MAY 16 UNLESS THERE WERE EVIDENCE POINTING IN THAT 
DIRECTION. 
 
7.  (C)  MANY ON THE LEFT, WITH SEPTEMBER 2003 MUNICIPAL 
COUNCIL ELECTIONS IN MIND, WILL ATTEMPT TO TAR THE PJD WITH 
THE MAY 16 BRUSH.  IF THE PERPETRATORS ARE ULTIMATELY PROVEN 
TO BE MEMBERS OF THE VIOLENT ISLAMIST FRINGE, THE PJD WILL 
HAVE SOME BACKFILLING TO DO.  WE WILL EXAMINE IN SUBSEQUENT 
REPORTING REACTIONS TO MAY 16 BY THE PJD AS WELL AS BY THE 
JUSTICE AND CHARITY ORGANIZATION (JCO), MOROCCO,S OTHER 
PRINCIPAL (AND SEMI-LEGAL) ISLAMIST ORGANIZATION.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, MO 
SUBJECT: MOROCCO: 2003 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 301352 
 
1.  Post responses are keyed to reftel. 
 
(A) Significant actions taken by host government to support 
the global coalition against terrorism. 
 
The government of Morocco (GOM) continues to provide strong 
support for the global coalition against terrorism. 
Following the May 16, 2003 bombings in Casablanca, the GOM 
acted swiftly in an effort to address perceived shortcomings 
in the Moroccan judicial and security systems to combat 
terrorism.  These measures included enacting legislation 
affording the government a range of stricter measures and 
introducing a series of domestic reforms that will make it 
more difficult in the future for terrorists to operate and 
repeat their earlier attacks.   Specifically, on May 21, 
Morocco,s parliament passed a government-sponsored 
anti-terrorism bill which expands the definition of terrorism 
and related criminal activities, enhances the authority of 
internal security institutions to investigate, track and 
prosecute terrorists in Morocco, including the investigation 
of terrorism financing, and provides for CT cooperation with 
other countries. 
 
Two new bills specifically focused on banking and 
money-laundering are currently under discussion and will 
serve to further enhance the ability of the GOM to address 
terrorist financing.   Parliament is currently studying a 
Banking and Financial Sector bill and Embassy contacts have 
indicated that this bill will likely be passed before the end 
of the current session (January).    The Anti-Money 
Laundering legislation is in the interagency process and 
should be submitted to Parliament by early January.  The 
current session of Parliament may be extended in order to 
ensure the passage of this legislation.  GOM officials have 
asked for U.S. and international technical assistance on 
anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing. Two 
Department of Treasury Office of Technical Assistance 
Training Missions were enthusiastically welcomed by the GOM 
in June and November 2003 and Moroccan officials have 
requested additional USG technical assistance and training. 
 
(B)  Describe the response of the judicial system to acts of 
international and/or significant acts of domestic terrorism 
during 2003. 
 
The Casablanca bombing on May 16, 2003 claimed the lives of 
45 people and injured over 100. The bombings prompted the GOM 
to move aggressively against internal extremist 
organizations.  As a result of the galvanizing nature of the 
May 16 attacks and the passage of the terrorism law, Moroccan 
authorities detained over  900 suspected Islamic extremists 
and prosecuted over 400 (including 10 who have been sentenced 
to death). 
 
 (C)  Did the host government extradite or request the 
extradition of suspected terrorists for prosecution during 
the year? 
 
The GOM has sought the extradition from Spain of individuals 
suspected of involvement in the May 16 terrorist attacks. 
Following a meeting with his Spanish counterpart, the 
Minister of Justice announced December 10 that Spain will 
soon hand over five Moroccans wanted in connection with these 
attacks. 
 
(D)  Describe any significant impediments to host government 
prosecution and/or extradition of suspected terrorists. 
 
None. 
 
(E)  Discuss host government responses other than prosecution. 
 
The Moroccan Government is fully supportive of the global war 
on terrorism. Following the Casablanca bombing King Mohammed 
VI addressed the nation and said Morocco would remain 
faithful to its international commitments to fight terrorism. 
He also reminded the nation that jihad was \"an effort to 
disseminate good rather than spread the seeds of discord or 
murder\" and that tolerance \"is one of the characteristics of 
Islam, which forbids bloodshed.\"  The King also promptly 
condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Istanbul. 
 
GOM authorities have tried to address the root causes of 
extremism, beginning a nationwide literacy campaign 10 days 
after the attacks and launching new housing projects in poor 
neighborhoods. 
 
Morocco is actively engaged in the Barcelona 5 5 process, 
which among other goals seeks to increase security in the 
Euro-Mediterranean area by reducing trafficking in persons 
and narcotics, and impeding the movement of terrorists into 
the region. Following Spanish PM Jose Maria Aznar\'s visit to 
Morocco in December, the two countries announced joint sea 
patrols to curb trafficking and prevent terrorism. 
 
 The Department of State and Department of Homeland Security 
Customs have a robust Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program 
designed to assist Morocco better protect its borders. 
 
(F)  Describe major CT efforts undertaken in 2003 by the host 
government, including steps taken in international fora. 
 
Morocco has thus far ratified ten of the twelve UN 
Conventions/Protocols on terrorism.  The conventions 
remaining to be ratified are the Convention against the 
Taking of Hostages and the Convention for the Suppression of 
Terrorist Bombings.  The remaining conventions are on track 
for full ratification.  As recently as January 2003, the GOM 
announced that it had ratified two additional UN Conventions 
on Terrorism in 2002 (Convention on the Physical Protection 
of Nuclear Material and the Convention for the Suppression of 
the Financing of Terrorism).   Morocco sent four officials 
from the Ministries of Defense, Interior and Foreign Affairs 
to a USG-sponsored counterterrorism seminar in Bamako, Mali 
in October. 
 
(G) Describe any significant host government support for 
international terrorism, terrorists, or terrorist groups. 
 
None. 
 
(H)  Has the host government made any public statements in 
support of a terrorist-supporting country on a terrorism 
issue? 
 
No. 
 
(I)  Describe any significant change since 2002 in the host 
government,s attitude towards terrorism. 
 
The May 16 terrorist attacks in Casablanca and the subsequent 
investigations that led to the arrest of more than 900 
suspects and the prosecution of over 400 people for terrorism 
and acts of sedition shattered the myth in Morocco that 
terrorism was a phenomenon that affected other countries and 
could never happen here.
