1.  LOCAL PRESS AUGUST 19-20 CARRIED SPLASHY REPORTS 
OF COORDINATED POLICE RAIDS IN IZMIR AND ANTALYA 
WHICH NETTED A TOTAL OF 22 ACCUSED PKK TERRORISTS. 
(A TOTAL OF MORE THAN FIFTY WERE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY 
INITIALLY BUT ONLY 22 ACTUALLY WERE HELD.)  ALSO SEIZED 
WERE A VARIETY OF EXPLOSIVES, HANDGUNS, AND WRITTEN

SUBJECT: ARREST OF PKK MEMBERS IN IZMIR 
 
REFS:  (A)  ANKARA 10958, (B) IZMIR 710 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  CHIEF PROSECUTOR OF THE IZMIR STATE SECURITY 
COURT, HULUSI OGUTCU, TOLD POL/ECONOFF AND VISITING 
DESK OFFICER HUGGINS ON AUGUST 31 THAT IT WAS THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S VIEW THAT THE ARRESTS REPORTED IN REFTELS 
HAD CLEARED THE PROBLEM OF POTENTIAL PKK ACTIVITY IN 
TOURIST AREAS OF THE AEGEAN.  HE SAID THAT THERE 
SHOULD BE NO MORE DANGER IN CITIES LIKE IZMIR OR 
ANTALYA TO TOURIST FACILITIES.  OGUTCU ALSO SAID 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT TOOK MORE SERIOUSLY THE PROPAGANDA 
ACTIVITIES OF WHICH THESE 9 PERSONS STAND ACCUSED 
THAN THE BOMB WHICH THEY REPORTEDLY SET, PARTICULARLY 
AS THE BOMBS WERE INEFFECTIVE AND HAVE CAUSED NO DEATHS. 
 
3.  (COMMENT:  WHILE  OGUTCU  COULD BE ON AN OFFICIAL 
LEVEL EXPECTED TO TAKE A VIEW THAT THERE WOULD BE NO 
FURTHER PROBLEMS, WE HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT HE MAY 
BELIEVE IT.  IF SO, THE VIEW CERTAINLY SEEMS OVER 
OPTIMISTIC TO US, IN VIEW OF THE RESERVE OF MANPOWER 
IN THE EAST WHICH THE PKK COULD USE IF IT IS REALLY 
PLANNING A CAMPAIGN TO DISRUPT TURKEY\'S TOURIST 
INDUSTRY.  ON THE OTHER HAND, SINCE THE THREATS AGAINST 
TOURISM WERE MADE BY A SPLINTER GROUP,IT MAY BE THAT 
THE POLICE FEEL CONFIDENT THEY HAVE CAPTURED ALL THAT 
GROUP\'S LOYALISTS.) 
 
4.  OGUTCU RECENTLY MOVED INTO HIS POST AFTER FOUR 
YEARS IN A SIMILAR POST IN DIYARBAKIR.  CERTAINLY, 
AS HE POINTED OUT HIMSELF, PKK ACTIVITY IN IZMIR 
AND THE AEGEAN AREA IS MINUSCULE COMPARED TO THAT 
IN THE EAST. 
 
5.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO DEVELOP INFORMATION 
ON THIS TOPIC FROM OTHER CONTACTS.

SUBJECT: LIBYANS RETURN TO IZMIR; THEY ARE WELCOME AS LONG AS 
THEY BRING DOLLARS 
 
1. UNLIKE THE FIRST LIBYAN SHIP TO VISIT IZMIR AFTER A LONG HIATUS, 
WHICH ARRIVED WITHOUT FANFARE, (REFTEL), THE SECOND SHIP ARRIVED TO 
AN OFFICIAL GREETING BY THE MAYOR OF KONAK, AND REPRESENTATIVES 
OF SEVERAL MERCHANT\'S ASSOCIATIONS. THE DEBARKING PASSENGERS WERE 
MET BY THE MUNICIPALITY BAND AND LOCAL OFFICIALS WITH WELCOMING 
GIFTS. MAYOR SARISIN NOTED IN HIS REMARKS THAT AFTER SUCESSFUL 
MEETING WITH THE LIBYAN AMBASSADOR IN ANKARA, AN AGREEMENT WAS 
REACHED FOR REGULAR LIBYAN FERRY VISITS TO IZMIR WITH A GOAL OF ONE 
SHIP A WEEK AND A PASSENGER TOTAL OF ALMOST TWO THOUSAND EACH 
MONTH. LOCAL OFFICIALS OPTIMISTICALLY HOPE THAT THE LIBYAN 
TOURISTS WILL LEAVE IZMIR MERCHANTS RICHER TO THE TUNE OF $50 
MILLION EACH MONTH. 
 
2. THE RESUMPTION OF THE LIBYAN FERRY SERVICE TO IZMIR IS WELCOMED 
BY MANY IZMIR MERCHANTS, MANY OF WHOM FIND BUSINESS SLOW, PARTLY 
DUE TO THE SLOW TOURIST SEASON. THESE LIBYAN FERRIES BRING 
SHOPPING TOURISTS WHO COME TO BUY EVERYTHING FROM STAPLES LIKE RICE 
AND FLOUR IN BULK, TO HOUSEHOLD ITEMS, CLOTHES AND LARGE 
APPLIANCES. THEY ALSO BRING THEIR CARS, OFTEN PUSHING THEM OFF 
THE FERRY FOR NEEDED REPAIRS. WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT MANY LOCAL 
DENTISTS AND DOCTORS HAVE AN ACTIVE PRACTICE CATERING TO THESE 
LIBYAN TOURISTS. 
 
3. COMMENT: WHILE THE EXPECTATIONS OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM 
THESE LIBYAN SHOPPING TOURS ARE SOMEWHAT INFLATED, THEIR PRESENCE 
IS WELCOMED BY LOCAL MERCHANTS, ESPECIALLY DURING A SUMMER SEASON 
WHEN MANY RESIDENTS OF IZMIR PLAN VACATIONS INSTEAD OF PURCHASES, 
AND LEAVE FOR THEIR SUMMER QUARTERS ALONG THE SEA.  WITH FEW 
TOURISTS THIS YEAR, LIBYAN DOLLARS ARE DOUBLY WELCOME.

SUBJ: TERRORIST KILL FOUR POLICEMEN IN ANTALYA 
 
1.  DECEMBER 8 EDITIONS OF ALL MAJOR DAILIES REPORT ATACKS ON TWO 
POLICE SHUTTLE BUSES IN ANTALYA AT APPROXIMATELY 1830 ON DEC 7. 
UNIDENTIFIED GUNMEN (NUMBER CHANGES FROM 3 TO 10 BY DIFFERENT 
PAPERS) SHOT AT THE BUSES CARRYING 50 POLICEMEN IN THE CITY CENTER 
IN THE VICINITY OF THE SECURITY FORCES\' RESIDENTIAL BUILDING SITE. 
FOUR POLICEMEN, INCLUDING A POLICE CHEIF, WERE SHOT TO DEATH.  THE 
TERRORIST ALSO SHOT AT THE HOUSES BELONGING TO THE POLICEMEN AND 
STARTED FIRES IN TWO BUILDINGS.  NO ORGANIZATION HAS YET CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKES. 
 
2.  IN TWO SEPARATE INCIDENTS LAST WEEK, HEP (PEOPLES LABOR PARTY) 
POVINCIAL BOARD MEMBER, IDRIS CELIK, AND A REGISTERED HEP MEMBER, 
YUSUF SOLMAZ, WERE SHOT TO DEATH IN ANTALYA.  SECURITY OFFICIALS 
BELIEVE THAT THE MURDER IN BOTH ASSASSINATIONS IS THE SAME 
PERSON.  YUSUF SOLMAZ WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY BY THE POLICE RECENTLY 
ON CHARGES OF COLLECTING FUNDS FOR HEP.  HIS BROTHER IS REPORTED TO 
BE AN ACTIVE PKK MILITANT. 
 
3.  CONTACTS IN THE ANTALYA MAYOR\'S OFFICE HAVE CONFIRMED THE 
INCIDENTS AND THE DETAILS DRAWN FROM THE PRESS ARTICLES REPORTED 
ABOVE.  ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCES, THERE IS NO APPARENT CONCERN 
AMONG THE PUBLIC THAT SUCH INCIDENTS MIGHT HAMPER NEXT SEASON\'S 
TOURISM INDUSTRY IN THE REGION,  THOUGH THE POLICE INCREASED ITS 
SECURITY MEASURES EXTENSIVELY IN THE CITY.  THE ATTACK ON THE 
SECURITY FORCES IS NOT THE FIRST ACT OF VIOLENCE IN ANTALYA; 
HOWEVER, IT IS REPORTED TO BE THE FIRST NON-KURDISH TARGET 
RECENTLY.  PAST INCIDENTS INVOLVED CLASHES BETWEEN KURDISH 
SEPARATIST AND LOCAL SECURITY FORCES OR THE RAISING OF THE PKK FLAG 
IN THE CITY\'S TOURIST ATTRACTION CENTERS.
