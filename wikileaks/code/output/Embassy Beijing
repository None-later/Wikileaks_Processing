TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REFS:  (A) STATE 54781 (B) STATE 42378 
 
1.  PEOPLE\'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
 
2.  THE PEOPLE\'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 
COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT PALESTINIAN GUERRILLAS AND TO 
RECOGNIZE THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION.  CHINA 
ESTABLISHED CONTACTS WITH THE PALESTINIAN OPPOSITION IN 
1963 EVEN BEFORE IT HAD BEGUN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE AGAINST 
ISRAEL.  ON MARCH 22, 1965, A PLO DELEGATION VISITING 
CHINA SIGNED A JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE CHINESE PEOPLE\'S 
INSTITUTE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (WHICH COMES UNDER THE 
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS), IN WHICH BOTH SIDES AGREED 
THAT THE PLO WOULD ESTABLISH AN OFFICE IN BEIJING IN 
ORDER TO STRENGTHEN MUTUAL COOPERATION.  IN MAY OF THE 
SAME YEAR, A PLO OFFICE ENJOYING DIPLOMATIC STATUS WAS 
FORMALLY ESTABLISHED IN BEIJING. 
 
PLO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN YASSIR ARAFAT VISITED 
CHINA IN 1964, 1970, 1981 AND 1984; AND IN MAY 1985, 
HE LED A JOINT PLO-JORDANIAN DELEGATION TO CHINA.  OTHER 
PALESTINIAN LEADERS, INCLUDING THE PFLP\'S GEORGE HABASH, 
THE DFLP\'S NAYIF HAWATMEH, AND THE PLO\'S FARUQ QADDUMI 
HAVE ALSO MADE VISITS TO CHINA.  IN AN APRIL 24, 1986, 
MEETING WITH QADDUMI, FOR EXAMPLE, THEN GENERAL SECRETARY 
HU YAOBANG CRITICIZED THE U.S. FOR ITS \"BIAS TOWARD 
ISRAEL AND IGNORING THE REASONABLE DEMANDS OF THE 
PALESTINIANS.\"  HU ADDED THAT THE \"CHINESE PEOPLE WILL 
STAND BY THE PALESTINIANS TILL THEIR FINAL VICTORY, 
RESOLUTELY SUPPORT THE PLO, THE ONLY LEGITIMATE REPRE- 
SENTATIVE OF THE PALESTINIANS, AND FIRMLY DEMAND THE 
RESTORATION OF ALL THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHTS.\" 
 
CHINESE LEADERS HAVE ALSO MET WITH PALESTINIAN LEADERS 
ON VISITS OVERSEAS.  DURING A 1986 VISIT TO TUNISIA, 
THEN PREMIER ZHAO ZIYANG MET WITH YASSIR ARAFAT ON 
JULY 25 IN TUNIS AND REITERATED SUPPORT FOR THE PLO 
AS THE SOLE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PALESTINIAN 
PEOPLE.  ZHAO ALSO CALLED FOR ARAB AND INTERNAL PLO UNITY 
AND ADVISED ARAFAT TO PAY GREATER ATTENTION TO POLITICAL 
STRUGGLE. 
 
ACCORDING TO THE MFA\'S \"GENERAL REVIEW OF CHINA\'S 
FOREIGN RELATIONS\" (ZHONGGUO WAIJIAO GAILAN, 1987), 
CHINA HAS MANY TIMES SINCE 1964 INVITED PALESTINIAN 
FIGHTERS, MASS ORGANIZATIONS, STUDY GROUPS AND DELE- 
GATIONS TO VISIT CHINA AND HAS FURTHERMORE PROVIDED THE 
PLO AND PALESTINIAN FIGHTERS WITH WEAPONS, MONEY, 
MEDICINE, MATERIAL AND OTHER ASSISTANCE. 
 
THE MFA DIPLOMATIC LIST SHOWS FOUR PLO REPRESENTATIVES 
WORKING AT THE PLO MISSION IN BEIJING, ALL OF WHOM 
APPARENTLY HAVE FULL DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES, INCLUDING 
IMMUNITY AND THE USE OF THE POUCH.  THE PLO MISSION 
REGULARLY DISTRIBUTES NEWS BULLETINS OF THE PLO NEWS 
ORGANIZATION WAFA THROUGHOUT THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY.

SUBJECT: CIVAIR: AIR MONGOLIA - THE \"DO IT YOURSELF\" 
- AIRLINE 
 
1. SUMMARY: THE RECENTLY INAUGURATED WEEKLY AIR 
MONGOLIA NON-STOP SERVICE BETWEEN ULAANBATAAR (U-B) 
AND BEIJING APPEARED TO US, AT FIRST BLUSH, TO BE 
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF MANNA FROM HEAVEN. 
PRIOR TO THE EXISTENCE OF THIS FLIGHT, TRAVEL BETWEEN 
BEIJING AND U-B REQUIRED A 36 HOUR (ONE-WAY) TRAIN 
RIDE. THE EMBASSY\'S EFFORTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THIS FLIGHT, BOTH IN SUPPORT OF EMBASSY U-B AND TO 
FACILITATE TRAVEL OF DELEGATIONS TO U-B, HAVE 
ACHIEVED MIXED RESULTS, AT BEST. WE CANVASSED LOCAL 
AMMRICAN BUSINESSMEN TO FIND THAT THEY TOO REGARD THE 
FLIGHT WITH SOME TREPIDATION. A TELEPHONE CALL TO THE 
MONGOLIAN EMBASSY IN BEIJING REVEALED THAT 
ALTHOUGH THEIR AMBASSADOR MOONLIGHTS AS THE AIR 
MONGOLIA REPRESENTATIVE, HE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR 
COMMENT ON THE AIR SERVICE. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. IN EARLY JUNE THE EMBASSY ATTEMPTED TO DESPATCH 
OUR FIRST OFFICIAL TRAVELER, THE RSO, VIA AIR 
MONGOLIA TO U-B ON A POUCH RUN. THE RSO ARRIVED AT 
BEIJING AIRPORT OVER TWO HOURS AHEAD OF THE SCHEDULED 
DEPARTURE TIME. UNABLE TO FIND ANYONE TO CHECK HIS 
LUGGAGE THROUGH TO U-B, THE RSO MANAGED TO OBTAIN A 
BOARDING PASS AND PROCEEDED TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
DEPARTURE AREA. HE WAS ASSURED THAT HE WOULD BE 
CALLED WHEN THE FLIGHT WAS READY TO DEPART. IN THE 
WAITING LOUNGE, THE RSO ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL TOURISTS 
ALSO WAITING FOR THE FLIGHT TO U-B, AND THE GROUP 
DECIDED TO WAIT TOGETHER. AS THE DEPARTURE TIME 
APPROACHED, THE RSO BECAME CONCERNED AND MADE 
INQUIRIES OF THE AIRPORT STAFF; HE WAS TOLD THAT THE 
PLANE WOULD TAKE OFF \"SOON\". ALMOST AN HOUR AFTER 
THE DEPARTURE TIME, THE RSO AGAIN ASKED ABOUT THE 
FLIGHT; HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE AIRCRAFT HAD ALREADY 
TAKEN OFF WITHOUT PASSENGERS OR CARGO. THE TOWER 
TRIED TO CALL THE PLANE BACK WITHOUT SUCCESS; IT WAS 
ONLY LATER WHEN FACILITATING THE TRAVEL OF TWO 
DELEGATIONS TO U-B IN AUGUST THAT WE BEGAN TO 
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS FACING AIR MONGOLIA. 
 
3. ON AUGUST 22, TWO EMBASSY ECON OFFICERS 
ACCOMPANIED CODEL DORNAN AND STAFFDEL OLIN TO CAPITAL 
AIRPORT TO ASSIST THEM IN CHECK-IN AND BOARDING FOR 
AIR MONGOLIA (OM) FLIGHT 152 TO U-B. ALTHOUGH MOST 
AIRPORT PERSONNEL REPLIED ONLY WITH QUIZZICAL LOOKS 
WHEN ASKED WHERE TO BOARD THE FLIGHT TO MONGOLIA, 
ECONOFFS WERE ABLE TO FIND THE DESIGNATED DEPARTURE 
GATE (RIGHT NEXT TO A FLIGHT TO PYONGYANG) WELL 
BEFORE THE SCHEDULED 17:10 DEPARTURE TIME. (THERE 
WAS A BRIEF HOLD-UP WHEN AIRPORT PERSONNEL DISCOVERED 
THAT THEY HAD GIVEN THE CODEL AND STAFFDEL BOARDING 
PASSES FOR THE NORTH KOREAN AIRLINES FLIGHT TO 
PYONGYANG, BUT THIS WAS QUICKLY RESOLVED.) HOWEVER, 
AS 17:10 CAME AND WENT, THERE WAS NO SIGN OF EITHER 
THE AIR MONGOLIA PLANE OR ITS FLIGHT CREW. AFTER 
ASKING THE AIRPORT PERSONNEL ABOUT THE STATUS OF 
FLIGHT OM 152, WE WERE TOLD THAT IT HAD JUST BEEN 
CANCELLED. NO REASON WAS GIVEN FOR THE CANCELLATION 
AND ECONOFFS WERE NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE PLANE 
HAD ACTUALLY ARRIVED FROM MONGOLIA. THE ONLY 
INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN WERE TO TRY AGAIN TOMORROW AT 
9:00. 
 
4. BY THIS TIME, THE TWO DELEGATIONS HAD MET THE 
ONLY OTHER PASSENGERS WAITING FOR OM 152, FOUR 
AMERICAN BIG GAME HUNTERS GOING TO MONGOLIA FOR SHEEP 
HUNTING. NO ONE IN THE HUNTING GROUP SPOKE CHINESE, 
SO THEY JOINED UP WITH THE EMBASSY GROUP AND STARTED 
THE PROCESS OF LEAVING THE AIRPORT. SINCE EVERYONE 
HAD ALREADY BEEN STAMPED OUT OF CHINESE EMIGRATION, 
THEY HAD TO HAVE THEIR EXIT STAMPS CANCELLED. THE 
GROUPS\' EFFORTS TO RECOVER THEIR LUGGAGE WERE 
UNSUCCESSFUL, AS AIRPORT PERSONNEL TOLD THE GROUPS, 
\"YOU DON\'T NEED IT\". 
 
5. AT 8:00 ON AUGUST 23, ECONOFF AGAIN HAD THE TWO 
DELEGATIONS AT THE DESIGNATED GATE READY TO DEPART ON 
FLIGHT OM 152. IN ADDITION TO THE TWO DELEGATIONS 
AND THE AMERICAN BIG GAME HUNTERS, THERE WERE ALSO 
ABOUT 10 JAPANESE TOURISTS WAITING FOR THE PLANE. 
(HOW DID THEY KNOW NOT TO SHOW UP FOR THE FLIGHT THE 
DAY BEFORE?) AIRPORT PERSONNEL ASSURED THE GROUP 
THAT THE FLIGHT HAD NOT YET ARRIVED FROM U-B, BUT WAS 
STILL EXPECTED TO DEPART AT 9:00. THE GROUP CALMLY 
WAITED. 
 
6. AS 9:00 CAME AND WENT, ECONOFF STARTED TO PANIC. 
REMEMBERING EMBASSY RSO\'S STORY, HE FEARED THAT THE 
TWO DELEGATIONS WOULD BE STRANDED. AT ABOUT THIS 
TIME, STAFFDEL OLIN AND ONE OF THE JAPANESE TOURISTS 
SPOTTED A SMALL TWIN ENGINE PLAN ON THE FAR SIDE OF 
THE TARMAC. AS NO ONE WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS 
PLANE AND THE AIRPORT PERSONNEL DENIED ITS EXISTENCE, 
ECONOFF DECIDED THE PLANE WAS PROBABLY OM 152, 
PREPARING FOR DEPARTURE. EXERCISING THE PRIVILEGES 
OF THE EMBASSY\'S AIRPORT PASS, HE WALKED ACROSS THE 
TARMAC TO THE PLANE. THE PLANE, AN AN-24/PB, WAS THE 
AIR MONGOLIA FLIGHT. AFTER A BRIEF DISCUSSION WITH 
THE MONGOLIAN FLIGHT CREW, ECONOFF DISCOVERED THAT 
THEY SPOKE NEITHER OF HIS LANGUAGES - CHINESE OR 
ENGLISH - ONLY RUSSIAN AND MONGOLIAN. HOWEVER, 
THROUGH GESTURES AND NODS, ECONOFF WAS ABLE TO 
DETERMINE THAT THE PILOT WAS WAITING ON FUEL, 
PASSENGERS, AND BAGGAGE. BECAUSE THE MONGOLIANS 
COULD NOT COMMUNICATE WITH THE AIRPORT PERSONNEL, 
THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO GET ANY OF THESE. 
 
7. AS EVERYTHING WAS RUNNING LATE AND THE MONGOLIANS 
SEEMED TO HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO GET WHAT THEY NEEDED, 
ECONOFF BORROWED THE BICYCLE OF ONE THE CHINESE 
AIRPORT STAFF AND WENT IN SEARCH OF FUEL, PASSENGERS 
AND BAGGAGE. FUEL WAS RELATIVELY EASILY FOUND AND 
DELIVERED TO THE PLANE. A BUS TO TRANSPORT 
PASSENGERS WAS MORE DIFFICULT. SINCE THE CHINESE 
AIRPORT PERSONNEL CONTINUED TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF 
THE MONGOLIAN PLANE, THEY SAW NO REASON TO SEND A 
VEHICLE TO TRANSPORT THE PASSENGERS TO THE PLANE. 
AFTER A SHORT ARGUMENT AND ANOTHER BIKE RIDE ACROSS 
THE TARMAC, ECONOFF WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE THE AIRPORT 
STAFF THAT THE PLANE HAD ARRIVED AND THAT THE 
PASSENGERS SHOULD BE SENT OUT. AFTER A SLIGHTLY 
LONGER DISCUSSION THE AIRPORT STAFF AGREED TO SEARCH 
FOR THE BAGGAGE FOR THE PLANE. 
 
8. EVENTUALLY, ABOUT 17 HOURS BEHIND SCHEDULE, 
ECONOFF (ON A BIKE) AND DELEGATIONS (IN A BUS) 
ARRIVED AT THE FUELED-UP PLANE. THE BAGGAGE ARRIVED 
SHORTLY AFTER. A SHORT ARGUMENT BROKE OUT BETWEEN 
THE MONGOLIAN FLIGHT CREW AND THE CHINESE BAGGAGE 
HANDLERS; BUT, SINCE THE MONGOLIANS SPOKE ONLY IN 
MONGOLIAN AND RUSSIAN AND THE CHINESE ONLY IN 
CHINESE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT WAS DISCUSSED. 
FINALLY, AT 10:25, FLIGHT OM 152 TOOK OFF FOR U-B. 
(ONE OF THE TRAVELERS LATER REPORTED THAT IN-FLIGHT 
SERVICE CONSISTED OF A STEWARDESS IN BLACK FISHNET 
STOCKINGS, A CHOICE OF BAD WINE OR VODKA, AND AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT -- SOMEWHERE DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE 
CIRCA TWO HOUR FLIGHT -- THAT THE PLANE WAS \"SEVEN 
MINUTES FROM THE MONGOLIAN BORDER\".) 
 
9. OF THE AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN WHO ATTEMPTED TO FLY 
OR TO SHIP CARGO VIA AIR MONGOLIA TO U-B, THOSE WHO 
DISCUSSED THEIR EFFORTS WITH THE EMBASSY REPORTED A 
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT FAILURE RATE. CARGO, IN 
PARTICULAR, SEEMS TO BE DIFFICULT TO SHIP TO U-B. 
THE MONGOLIAN FLIGHT CREWS CANNOT READ THE 
ENGLISH/CHINESE CARGO MANIFESTS AND FREQUENTLY REFUSE 
TO ACCEPT THE BILLS OF LADING; THEY ARE UNABLE TO 
ASCERTAIN FROM THE CHINESE (DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED 
LANGUAGE BARRIER) WHETHER THERE IS CARGO TO BE 
SHIPPED; OR THE CHINESE REFUSE TO LOAD THE CARGO 
(ACCORDING TO ONE U.S. BUSINESSMAN) UNTIL AIR 
MONGOLIA PAYS SOME OF ITS LANDING AND GROUND HANDLING 
BILLS. THE SAME BUSINESSMAN COMMENTED THAT IN HIS 
(ADMITTEDLY BRIEF) EXPERIENCE, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR 
AIR MONGOLIA TO DROP OFF PASSENGERS FOR BEIJING AND 
IMMEDIATELY TAKE OFF AGAIN (WITHOUT A RETURN LOAD) IN 
ORDER TO AVOID CHINESE AIRPORT OFFICIALS WITH DUNNING 
NOTICES. 
 
10. ECONOFF CONTACTED THE MONGOLIAN EMBASSY TO LEARN 
THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY AND TO REQUEST A BRIEFING ON 
THE STATUS OF THE MONGOLIA-PRC CIVIL AIR TREATY. 
AFTER SOME DISCUSSION, THE MONGOLIAN EMBASSY OFFICER 
ADMITTED THAT THEIR AMBASSADOR ALSO SERVED (CLEARLY, 
IN HIS SPARE TIME) AS THE AIR MONGOLIA REPRESENTATIVE 
IN BEIJING, BUT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT ON THE 
AIR SERVICE. THE MONGOLIAN DIPLOMAT SAID THAT HE WAS 
NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE EXISTENCE OF A CIVIL AIR TREATY 
BETWEEN MONGOLIA AND THE PRC, BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO 
INVESTIGATE AND ADVISE FURTHER. HE FINALLY REFERRED 
ALL OF ECONOFF\'S QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE AIR SERVICE 
TO THE MAIN OFFICE OF THE CIVIL AVIATION 
ADMINISTRATION OF CHINA (CAAC) WHICH SERVES AS AIR 
MONGOLIA\'S AGENT IN CHINA.

SQUARE IN SECOND NIGHT OF DEMONSTRATIONS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS FROM BEIJING 
UNIVERSITIES FLOODED TIANANMEN SQUARE IN CENTRAL 
BEIJING FOR A SECOND NIGHT ON APRIL 18.  THEY CROWDED 
AROUND THE BASE OF THE MARTYRS MONUMENT AT THE CENTER 
OF THE SQUARE CHANTING PRO-DEMOCRACY SLOGANS AND 
SINGING PATRIOTIC SONGS.  TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
PEACEFUL BUT SYMPATHETIC ONLOOKERS SURROUNDED THE 
CORE OF STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS.  LATE IN THE EVENING 
BETWEEN TWO AND THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS MARCHED TO 
THE ZHONGNANHAI LEADERSHIP COMPOUND SEVERAL BLOCKS 
FROM THE SQUARE AND SAT AT THE GATE.  ALTHOUGH POLOFF 
AT THE SQUARE WITNESSED NO VIOLENCE, THE XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY REPORTED ON APRIL 19 THAT A POLICE OFFICER 
SUSTAINED A MINOR INJURY WHEN A SMALL NUMBER OF 
STUDENTS ATTEMPTED TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO 
ZHONGNANHAI IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. 
DEMONSTRATORS AT ZHONGNANHAI REPORTEDLY DISPERSED 
BETWEEN 4:00 AM AND 5:00 AM ON THE MORNING OF 
APRIL 19.  NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED. 
 
3.  LAST NIGHT\'S DEMONSTRATION WAS AMONG THE LARGEST 
UNOFFICIAL GATHERINGS AT THE SQUARE SINCE HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF BEIJINGERS FLOODED TIANANMEN TO 
COMMEMORATE THE DEATH OF ZHOU ENLAI AND PROTEST THE 
GANG OF FOUR IN APRIL, 1976.  TIANANMEN WAS ALSO THE 
SCENE OF PRO-DEMOCRACY STUDENT GATHERINGS IN LATE 
1985 AND LATE 1986.  A STUDENT ATTEMPT TO DEMONSTRATE 
THERE FIZZLED IN MID-1988.  THIS TIME STUDENTS 
APPEARED BETTER ORGANIZED THAN IN THE PAST, AS 
EVIDENCED BY THE PREVALENCE OF STUDENTS WEARING DARK 
MOURNING CLOTHES, COORDINATION OF THE ZHONGNANHAI 
MARCH, AND SLOGANS APPARENTLY AGREED UPON IN ADVANCE. 
 
4.  THE DEATH OF POLITBURO MEMBER AND OUSTED PARTY 
SECRETARY GENERAL HU YAOBANG PROVIDED DISCONTENTED 
STUDENTS WITH A CONVENIENT PRETEXT FOR DEMONSTRATING. 
THAT STUDENTS WERE ALLOWED TO GATHER AT THEIR 
UNIVERSITIES TO ORGANIZE THE DEMONSTRATION AS WELL AS 
THE SURPRISINGLY LIGHT POLICE PRESENCE AT TIANANMEN 
SUGGEST THAT THE AUTHORITIES WILL TOLERATE STUDENT 
SENTIMENT FOR THE MOMENT.  AN OFFICIAL MOURNING 
CEREMONY FOR HU YAOBANG IS SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 22. 
AUTHORITIES MAY WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE CEREMONY BEFORE 
MOVING TO STOP THE DEMONSTRATIONS.  LIKE ITS 
PREDECESSORS, THIS OUTPOURING MAY VERY WELL INTENSIFY 
PRESENT LEADERSHIP DEBATES OVER POLICY AND PERSONNEL 
ISSUES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE CROWD AT TIANANMEN 
---------------------- 
5.  THE APRIL 15 DEATH OF FORMER PARTY GENERAL 
SECRETARY HU YAOBANG CONTINUES GENERATE STUDENT 
ACTIVITY ON BEIJING CAMPUSES AND AT TIANANMEN 
SQUARE.  ON APRIL 18, A CORE CADRE OF STUDENTS SPENT 
THE ENTIRE DAY AT THE MARTYRS MONUMENT, A TALL STELA 
AT THE HEART OF TIANANMEN SQUARE.  THEY WERE JOINED 
IN THE EARLY EVENING BY OTHER STUDENTS FROMBEIJING, 
QINGHUA, AND PEOPLE\'S UNIVERSITIES.  POLOFF PRESENT 
AT TIANANMEN ALSO SAW STUDENTS FROM THE BEIJING 
ENGINEERING UNIVERSITY ARRIVE AT THE SQUARE AT ABOUT 
9:00 PM.  AT 9:30 PM STUDENTS THAT HAD PACKED 
SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER AT THE BASE OF THE MONUMENT 
NUMBERED BETWEEN TWO AND THREE THOUSAND 
PEOPLE.  A PEOPLE\'S UNIVERSITY STUDENT TOLD POLOFF 
THAT THE STUDENTS FROM HIS SCHOOL ALONE NUMBERED OVER 
700. 
 
6.  MOST DEMONSTRATORS AT THE MONUMENT WORE DARK 
CLOTHES OF MOURNING.  THEY CHANTED SUCH SLOGANS AS 
\"LONG LIVE DEMOCRACY\" AND \"OPPOSE OFFICIAL 
CORRUPTION.\"  AT ONE POINT STUDENTS WHO HAD CLIMBED 
THE MONUMENT\'S PEDIMENT RAISED A BANNER STATING 
\"OVERTHROW AUTOCRATIC BUREAUCRACY.\"  AT THE CENTER OF 
THE MONUMENT FLEW A THIRTY FOOT BANNER RAISED BY 
BEIJING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHICH STATED \"ALWAYS 
REMEMBER COMRADE HU YAOBANG.\"  AT THE BANNER\'S CENTER 
STUDENTS HAD PAINTED THREE LARGE CHARACTERS FOR THE 
PHRASE \"CHINA\'S SPIRIT\" (ZHONGGUO HUN). 
DEMONSTRATORS ALSO ENTHUSIASTICALLY SANG PATRIOTIC 
SONGS SUCH AS THE \"INTERNATIONALE.\" 
 
7.  BETWEEN 10 AND 15 THOUSAND CURIOUS BEIJINGERS OF 
ALL AGES AND ALL OCCUPATIONS THRONGED THE SQUARE 
SURROUNDING THE STELA.  THE ONLOOKERS WERE PEACEFUL 
BUT APPEARED LARGELY SYMPATHETIC TO THE STUDENTS. 
THEY CHEERED EACH TIME A STUDENT CLIMBED THE 
MONUMENT\'S HIGH PEDIMENT TO PLACE A MOURNING WREATH 
OR A BANNER.  ON OCCASION, A LARGE NUMBER OF THE 
ONLOOKERS CLAPPED OR SHOUTED IN APPROVAL OF THE 
PRO-DEMOCRACY SLOGANS CHANTED BY THE DEMONSTRATORS. 
SMALL GROUPS OF YOUTHS AND OTHERS GATHERED IN TIGHT 
HUDDLES AROUND THE SQUARE TO DISCUSS POLITICS. 
POLOFF WITNESSED A CROWD GATHER SPONTANEOUSLY AROUND 
A MIDDLE AGED MAN WHO BEGAN TO DISCUSS WITH HIS 
FRIEND THE PROS AND CONS OF THE STUDENTS\' ACTIONS. 
 
THE MARCH TO ZHONGNANHAI 
------------------------ 
8.  AT 9:45 PM A CROWD OF BETWEEN 500 TO ONE THOUSAND 
DEMONSTRATORS CARRYING A WREATH DESCENDED FROM THE 
BASE OF THE MONUMENT AND PROCEEDED NORTH THROUGH THE 
SQUARE TO CHANGAN AVENUE, BEIJING\'S MAIN 
THOROUGHFARE.  FOLLOWED BY A HUGE NUMBER OF 
ONLOOKERS, THEY TURNED TO MEET A PARADE OF BETWEEN 
ONE AND TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED 
AT THE SQUARE FROM THE UNIVERSITY DISTRICT IN BEIJING\'S 
NORTHWEST SUBURBS, A TWO TO THREE HOUR MARCH AWAY. 
THE MARCHERS, WHO APPEARED TO HAIL MOSTLY FROM BEIJING 
AND QINGHUA UNIVERSITIES, CARRIED ANOTHER WREATH AND 
A LARGE PRO-DEMOCRACY BANNER.  THE COMBINED CROWD 
MARCHED ONCE AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE SQUARE AND 
HEADED FOR THE XINHUA GATE, THE SOUTH ENTRANCE TO THE 
ZHONGNANHAI LEADERSHIP COMPOUND.  (NOTE: A WESTERN 
REPORTER ESTIMATED THE SIZE OF THE MARCH AT 4 
THOUSAND PEOPLE, BUT THIS IS ON THE HIGH END OF THE 
SCALE.  TWO TO THREE THOUSAND SEEMS MORE LIKE IT. 
END NOTE.) 
 
9.  REACHING ZHONGNANHAI AT ABOUT 10:45 PM, THE LEAD 
MARCHERS PLACED TWO OR THREE WREATHS HONORING HU 
YAOBANG BEFORE THE DOORS OF THE GATE.  THEY THEN SAT 
DOWN TO CHANT SLOGANS AND SING.  SEVERAL THOUSAND 
ONLOOKERS CROWDED THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AVENUE AS 
LATE NIGHT TRAFFIC IN THE AREA GROUND TO A HALT.  AS 
OF POLOFF\'S DEPARTURE FROM THE SCENE AT 11:45 PM, THE 
CROWD AT THE GATE HAD CONFINED ITSELF TO VERBAL 
DISPLAYS OF ITS SYMPATHIES.  HOWEVER, AN APRIL 19 NEW 
CHINA NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA) RELEASE REPORTED THAT AT 
12:20 AM \"A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE\" HOLDING WREATHS 
WERE STOPPED BY GUARDS AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO ENTER THE 
GATE.  THERE WERE THREE SUCH ATTEMPTS, ACCORDING TO 
THE ARTICLE.  THE STORY ALSO STATED THAT ONE GUARD 
WAS LIGHTLY INJURED WHEN SOME DEMONSTRATORS BEGAN 
THROWING BOTTLES AND SHOES. 
 
10.  AT 4:20 AM ON WEDNESDAY, LOUDSPEAKERS IN THE 
AREA BROADCAST A BEIJING CITY GOVERNMENT NOTICE 
URGING MARCHERS TO RETURN HOME, ACCORDING TO THE 
XINHUA STORY.  THE ARTICLE QUOTES THE NOTICE AS 
STATING THAT \"IT IS ILLEGAL AND IMPERMISSIBLE TO 
BREAK INTO PARTY AND GOVERNMENT ORGANS.\"  THE ARTICLE 
REPORTED THAT BETWEEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND ABOUT 
5:00 AM, THE CROWD DISPERSED AND ORDER IN THE AREA 
HAD BEEN RESTORED.  WE BELIEVE THAT A CORE GROUP OF 
STUDENTS REMAINED AT THE MONUMENT THROUGHOUT THE 
NIGHT.  WE HAVE JUST HEARD REPORTS THAT AS OF MID-DAY 
APRIL 19, SEVERAL THOUSAND STUDENTS REMAIN IN 
TIANANMEN. 
 
POLICE PRESENCE DISCREET 
------------------------ 
11.  SURPRISINGLY, UNIFORMED POLICE WERE ALMOST 
ENTIRELY ABSENT FROM TIANANMEN SQUARE ITSELF 
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING\'S FESTIVITIES.  HOWEVER, 
JUDGING FROM THE NUMBER OF OFFICIAL VEHICLES PARKED 
IN FRONT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MUSEUM WHICH FLANKS THE 
EAST SIDE OF THE SQUARE, A LARGE CONTINGENT OF PUBLIC 
SECURITY OFFICERS MAY HAVE GARRISONED THE MUSEUM\'S 
SPACIOUS INTERIOR COURTYARD.  UNARMED POLICE ON THE 
STREETS SURROUNDING TIANANMEN SQUARE MAINTAINED A 
FORCE LEVEL SUFFICIENT ONLY TO DIRECT TRAFFIC.  MORE 
PUBLIC SECURITY OFFICERS, AGAIN UNARMED, CIRCLED THE 
CROWD OF DEMONSTRATORS AS THEY SAT BEFORE THE GATE AT 
ZHONGNANHAI, BUT THEIR NUMBERS REMAINED INSUFFICIENT 
TO CONTROL DEMONSTRATORS IN THE EVENT OF VIOLENCE. 
POLOFF WITNESSED NO OVERT FRICTION BETWEEN 
DEMONSTRATORS AND POLICE THROUGHOUT HIS STAY ON THE 
SQUARE.  POLOFF ALSO SAW NO ARRESTS.  AS FAR AS WE 
KNOW, NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY THE PRESS. 
 
STUDENTS SHOW IMPROVED ORGANIZATION 
----------------------------------- 
12.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE APRIL 18 DEMONSTRATION TO 
HAVE BEEN AMONG THE LARGEST UNOFFICIAL GATHERINGS AT 
TIANANMEN SINCE THE APRIL, 1976 RIOTS, WHEN 
BEIJINGERS FLOODED THE CITY\'S CENTRAL SQUARE TO SHOW 
SUPPORT FOR DECEASED PREMIER ZHOU ENLAI\'S POLICIES. 
STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED AT TIANANMEN IN SEPTEMBER, 1985 
AND AGAIN IN DECEMBER, 1986.  IN JUNE, 1988 HUNDREDS 
OF POLICE SUCCESSFULLY CORDONED OFF THE SQUARE TO 
PREVENT PRO-DEMOCRACY BEIJING UNIVERSITY 
DEMONSTRATORS FROM GATHERING. 
 
13.  LAST NIGHT THE STUDENTS DISPLAYED A DEGREE OF 
ORGANIZATION HIGHER THAN IN PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS. 
HUNDREDS OF DEMONSTRATORS CROWDING THE MONUMENT FROM 
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS ALL WORE DARK CLOTHING.  STUDENTS 
SEEM TO HAVE AGREED THAT THEIR SLOGANS SHOULD REMAIN 
GENERAL AND NOT DIRECTLY STRIKE AT THE PARTY OR AT 
INDIVIDUAL LEADERS.  IT APPEARS UNLIKELY THAT THE 
MARCHERS WHO ARRIVED AT THE SQUARE LATE IN THE 
EVENING TO LINK UP WITH THEIR CLASSMATES ALREADY 
THERE COULD NOT HAVE PARADED AROUND THE SQUARE AND 
HEADED FOR ZHONGNANHAI SMOOTHLY WITHOUT PRIOR 
PLANNING. 
 
WHY NOW? 
-------- 
14.  THIS AND PAST DEMONSTRATIONS SUGGEST THAT 
STUDENT FRUSTRATION WITH LEADERSHIP POLITICAL 
RIGIDITY AND WITH THEIR OWN LOW PROSPECTS AND 
STANDARD OF LIVING RUNS DEEP.  IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT 
THEY WILL SCRIBBLE MORDANTLY CRITICAL BIG CHARACTER 
POSTERS AND THREATEN TO DEMONSTRATE WHENEVER GIVEN 
THE CHANCE.  LAST YEAR, BEIJING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS 
NEARLY TOOK TO THE STREETS AFTER A GANG OF 
DELINQUENTS MURDERED A GRADUATE STUDENT IN A SCUFFLE 
OFF CAMPUS.  THIS YEAR, DISCONTENT HAD ALREADY MADE 
ITSELF FELT DURING THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED NPC, WHEN 
BEIJING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TACKED UP PRO-DEMOCRACY 
POSTERS AND HELD UNAUTHORIZED POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS 
ON CAMPUS. 
 
15.  THE DEATH OF HU YAOBANG, WHO WAS WIDELY THOUGHT 
TO HAVE CHAMPIONED DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AS WELL AS 
INTELLECTUAL AND STUDENT CAUSES, HAS PROVIDED 
STUDENTS WITH A CONVENIENT PRETEXT FOR ACTION. 
STUDENT GRIEF OVER HU\'S PASSING HAS BEEN EVIDENT AND 
SINCERE.  BUT A STRONG DESIRE TO SEE SPEEDIER 
DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR OWN 
SITUATIONS LIES AT THE BASE OF THESE CURRENT 
DEMONSTRATIONS.  PRO-DEMOCRACY SLOGANS FAR OUTNUMBER 
STUDENTS\' VOCAL EXPRESSIONS OF GRIEF FOR THE FALLEN 
POLITBURO MEMBER.  THE KNOTS OF PEOPLE ABOUT THE 
SQUARE WERE TALKING POLITICS, NOT EXCHANGING HU 
YAOBANG REMINISCENCES. 
 
WHAT\'S THE PARTY TO DO? 
----------------------- 
16.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEADERSHIP HAS AT LEAST 
TACITLY DECIDED TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO BLOW OFF STEAM 
AT THE SQUARE AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT TURN VIOLENT, DO 
NOT DIRECTLY ATTACK THE PARTY, AND GATHER OSTENSIBLY 
TO MOURN HU YAOBANG.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT BEIJING 
UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN UNDER PARTICULARLY TIGHT CONTROL 
BY SECURITY ORGANS SINCE THE 1985 DEMONSTRATIONS. 
OFFICIAL INTIMIDATION OF WOULD BE DEMONSTRATORS 
APPEARS TO HAVE GREATLY HINDERED STUDENT ORGANIZING 
SINCE THEN.  THAT BEIJING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ARE OUT 
IN FORCE THIS TIME INDICATES TO US THAT UNIVERSITY 
OFFICIALS AND SECURITY ORGANS MAY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO 
PLAY IT COOL.  LIGHT POLICE PRESENCE ON THE SQUARE 
ALSO SUGGESTS LEADERSHIP TOLERANCE OF THE 
DEMONSTRATIONS FOR THE TIME BEING. 
 
17.  THE LEADERSHIP MAY BE HOPING THAT THE FRENETIC 
STUDENTS, MANY OF WHOM APPEAR TO HAVE CAMPED OUT ON 
TIANANMEN FOR THREE DAYS NOW, MAY SIMPLY TIRE OUT AND 
CALL IT QUITS.  THE AUTHORITIES HAVE DECIDED TO HOLD 
AN OFFICIAL MEMORIAL CEREMONY FOR HU YAOBANG ON 
SATURDAY, APRIL 22.  THIS WOULD BE THE LOGICAL DATE 
BEYOND WHICH LEADERS COULD CEASE TO TOLERATE STUDENT 
ACTIVISM.  THEY WOULD PROBABLY THEN CLAIM THAT THE 
LEGITIMATE MOURNING PERIOD FOR HU HAD FINISHED AND 
THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR FURTHER ACTIVITIES.  THE 
PEOPLE\'S UNIVERSITY STUDENT TOLD POLOFF THAT HE 
THOUGHT STUDENTS WOULD GATHER AT THE SQUARE UNTIL THE 
MEMORIAL CEREMONY. 
 
18.  HOWEVER THE PARTY SEEKS PUBLICLY TO CHARACTERIZE 
THE ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE SO FAR CULMINATED IN THE 
APRIL 18 DEMONSTRATION, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE STUDENTS 
ARE VOICING SENTIMENTS ABOUT HU YAOBANG, THE 
AUTOCRATIC BUREAUCRACY, AND INCREASED OFFICIAL 
CORRUPTION THAT MANY REGULAR BEIJING CITIZENS SEEM TO 
SHARE AT LEAST QUIETLY.  LIKE ITS PREDECESSORS, THIS 
OUTPOURING MAY VERY WELL INTENSIFY PRESENT LEADERSHIP 
DEBATES OVER POLICY AND PERSONNEL ISSUES.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  BETWEEN 10 AND 20,000 STUDENTS OCCUPIED 
TIANANMEN SQUARE AT NOON ON MAY 21.  THE ATMOSPHERE 
WAS FESTIVE AND THEY APPEARED CONFIDENT.  ONLOOKERS 
NEAR THE SQUARE NUMBERED BETWEEN 50,000 AND 80,000. 
ACCORDING TO A STUDENT ON THE SQUARE, 100-200 HUNGER 
STRIKERS REMAIN.  STUDENTS CONTINUE TO CONTROL MUCH 
OF CENTRAL BEIJING IN THE AREA OF TIANANMEN.  THEY 
CONTROL ACCESS TO THE CITY THROUGH AN ELABORATE 
SYSTEM OF BLOCKADES.  STUDENT ORGANIZERS APPEAR TO BE 
IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH DEMONSTRATORS MANNING THE 
ROADBLOCKS AND CAN DISPATCH REINFORCEMENTS TO WEAK 
POINTS.  THIS SUGGESTS TO US THAT DEMONSTRATORS MAY 
BE GETTING SUPPORT FROM NEIGHBORHOOD PARTY AND 
GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
3.  AT 11:00 PM, MAY 20, A POLITICAL DECISION WAS 
MADE TO MOVE TROOPS INTO TIANANMEN AT 2:00 AM, 
MAY 21.  THE ORDER WAS RESCINDED BETWEEN 1:00 AM AND 
2:00 AM, ACCORDING TO DAO BEIJING.  AT PRESENT, 
STUDENTS APPEAR TO FEAR AN ASSAULT ON THE SQUARE 
EITHER FROM BEIJING\'S TUNNEL SYSTEM OR VIA MILITARY 
TRAIN INTO THE CITY. 
 
4.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HELD A 
MEETING BETWEEN MAY 19 AND MAY 21 AT WHICH AT LEAST 
ONE MEMBER STRONGLY OBJECTED TO MARTIAL LAW.  WE HAVE 
BEEN UNABLE TO CONFIRM THIS.  PEOPLE\'S DAILY COVERAGE 
OF THE EVENTS OF THE LAST TWO DAYS SUGGESTS CONTINUED 
RESISTANCE TO LI PENG IN THE MEDIA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE SCENE ON TIANANMEN AS OF 12:15 PM, MAY 21 
--------------------------------------------- 
5.  STUDENTS REMAIN IN CONTROL OF CENTRAL BEIJING. 
ACCORDING TO POLOFFS ON TIANANMEN SQUARE, THE NUMBER 
OF ONLOOKERS IN THE AREA ROSE BETWEEN 10:00 AM AND 
NOON.  APPROXIMATELY 50-80,000 ONLOOKERS CROWD 
CHANGAN AVENUE FROM THE BEIJING HOTEL IN THE EAST TO 
THE WEST SIDE OF THE SQUARE.  POLOFFS HAVE REPORTED 
THAT STUDENTS ON THE SQUARE ITSELF NUMBER BETWEEN 10 
AND 20,OOO.  A STUDENT GUARD ON THE SQUARE TOLD 
POLOFFS THAT BETWEEN 100 AND 200 HUNGER STRIKERS 
REMAIN.  THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE SQUARE IS FESTIVE. 
MANY ONLOOKERS STROLL ABOUT IN THEIR SUNDAY BEST. 
STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS APPEAR CONFIDENT, POLOFFS 
REPORTED. 
 
6.  THE PATTERN OF ACTIVITY ON THE SQUARE HAS 
REMAINED FAIRLY CONSTANT OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. 
GENERALLY, THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AT TIANANMEN DWINDLE 
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING AND BEGIN TO RECOVER DURING 
THE AFTERNOON.  CROWDS BEGIN ARRIVING DURING THE 
EVENING BETWEEN 7:00 PM AND 8:00 PM AND PEAK IN THE 
LATE EVENING. 
 
ABOUT BARRICADES 
---------------- 
7.  AS REPORTED EARLIER, STUDENTS APPEAR TO CONTROL 
ACCESS TO THE CENTRAL PART OF THE CITY THROUGH A 
SYSTEM OF BARRICADES AROUND THE SECOND AND THIRD RING 
ROADS AND AT OTHER MAJOR ROAD APPROACHES TO THE 
CITY.  AT TIMES, WE HAVE SEEN BARRICADES OF PEOPLE OR 
VEHICLES ON THE CLOSER APPROACHES TO TIANANMEN SQUARE 
AS WELL. 
 
8.  POLOFF VISITING ONE SUCH ROADBLOCK AT THE 
INTERSECTION OF THE THIRD RING ROAD AND JIANGUOMENWAI 
AVENUE REPORTED THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 50 BUSSES IN 
THE AREA.  FOURTEEN BUSSES BENEATH THE JIANGUOMENWAI 
AVENUE OVERPASS CONTROL PASSAGE ON THE THIRD RING 
ROAD, WHICH RUNS NORTH-SOUTH.  THE BUSSES HAVE LEFT A 
ONE LANE OPENING ALONG THE ROAD AND CAN EASILY BLOCK 
TRAFFIC BY DRIVING INTO THE LANE.  SEVERAL OTHER OF 
THE BUSSES BLOCK BOTH ENDS OF THE OVERPASS.  MANY OF 
THE REMAINING BUSSES PARKED ALONG JIANGUOMENWAI UP TO 
XIDAWANG ROAD COULD BE PULLED INTO THE AVENUE TO 
BLOCK TROOPS, ACCORDING TO POLOFF. 
 
9.  POLOFF REPORTED THAT CITY BUS DRIVERS ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR MOVING THEIR VEHICLES AT THIS 
BARRICADE.  ONE APPARENTLY FEARLESS DRIVER WITH WHOM 
POLOFF TALKED STATED THAT HE AND HIS FELLOWS ARE 
CONFIDENT THAT THEIR BLOCKADES WILL STOP PLA TANKS. 
(BUT WE DOUBT IT.)  HE ADDED THAT DRIVERS INTEND TO 
REMAIN AT THE INTERSECTION AND WILL NOT RETURN TO 
WORK ON MAY 22. 
 
10.  ACCORDING TO A STUDENT AT QINGHUA UNIVERSITY WHO 
SPOKE WITH AN EMBASSY FCS OFFICER PRESENT AT THE 
CAMPUS THIS MORNING, STUDENTS ON CAMPUS ARE IN CLOSE 
TOUCH WITH DEMONSTRATORS MANNING THE BARRICADES AND 
ARE ABLE TO DISPATCH REINFORCEMENTS TO WEAK SPOTS IN 
THE SYSTEM.  EMBOFFS HAVE WITNESSED LARGE CONVOYS OF 
CIVILIAN MOTORCYCLES ON CHANGAN AVENUE.  IT IS 
POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS ONE METHOD OF COMMUNICATION 
BETWEEN STUDENT ORGANIZERS AND DEMONSTRATORS. 
APPARENTLY STRONG COOPERATION AMONG WORKERS, 
STUDENTS, AND OTHERS AT THE BLOCKADES SUGGESTS TO US 
THAT DEMONSTRATORS MAY BE GETTING SUPPORT FROM 
NEIGHBORHOOD PARTY AND GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
MILITARY SITUATION 
------------------ 
11.  DAO HAS REPORTED EXTENSIVELY ON THE MILITARY 
SITUATION  (REFS. B-E).  BASED ON DAO OBSERVATIONS OF 
PLA ACTIVITIES AND ON DAO CONVERSATIONS WITH MILITARY 
PERSONNEL, AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 PM, MAY 20, A 
POLITICAL DECISION WAS MADE TO MOVE ON TIANANMEN AT 
2:00 AM.  THE ORDER APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN RESCINDED 
BETWEEN 1:00 AM AND 2:00 AM ON MAY 21.  ACCORDING TO 
DAO OBSERVERS, TROOPS AT GUCHENG, ON THE WESTERN SIDE 
OF THE CITY, STOOD DOWN FROM THEIR TRUCKS AND BEGAN 
MINGLING WITH THE LOCAL POPULACE AT ABOUT 8:15 AM. 
IT IS RUMORED THAT AT ABOUT 6:15 AM ON MAY 21 LI PENG 
ANNOUNCED THAT THE ORDER HAD BEEN RESCINDED. 
 
12.  AS OF LATE MORNING, PLA TRUCKS CONVOYING 
SOLDIERS AT GUCHENG HAD TURNED AROUND TO PARK FACING 
IN A DIRECTION AWAY FROM THE CITY.  STUDENTS AT 
TIANANMEN SQUARE AND AT BEIJING UNIVERSITIES 
REPORTEDLY FEAR THAT THE PLA WILL ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE 
SQUARE TONIGHT VIA BEIJING\'S UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
NETWORK OR VIA A MILITARY TRAIN THROUGH BEIJING 
STATION. 
 
13.  AN AMERICAN CITIZEN REPORTED TO EMBASSY 
AFTERNOON OF MAY 21 THAT  PLA TROOPS HAD TAKEN OVER 
BEIJING\'S CENTRAL RAILWAY STATION.  POLOFF WHO 
SUBSEQUENTLY WENT TO THE STATION SAW NO SIGNS OF A 
PLA PRESENCE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE STATION.  HE 
DID NOT, HOWEVER, OBSERVE THE PLATFORM AREAS, WHICH 
REQUIRE A TICKET TO ENTER.  ALTHOUGH CHINESE STUDENTS 
IN THE VICINITY OF THE STATION ASSURED HIM THAT THE 
SOLDIERS WERE THERE, THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY HAD 
NOT THEMSELVES SEEN THEM.  ONE STUDENT ON TIANANMEN 
SQUARE REPORTED THAT TROOPS HAD ALREADY LEFT THE 
STATION. 
 
14.  AN AMERICAN STUDENT AT BEIJING UNIVERSITY 
REPORTED TO EMBASSY THAT HE WITNESSED TANKS AND PLA 
SOLDIERS AT AN INTERSECTION IN THE VICINITY OF 
BEIJING UNIVERSITY ON THE MORNING OF MAY 21. 
STUDENTS WERE CIRCULATING AMONG THE SOLDIERS, 
ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN.  HE DID NOT SAY HOW MANY 
TANKS WERE PRESENT.  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM 
THIS REPORT.  THE FCS OFFICER AT QINGHUA REPORTED 
WITNESSING LARGE CROWDS OF STUDENTS AT THE GATES OF 
BEIJING AND PEOPLE\'S UNIVERSITIES.  HE DID NOT REPORT 
HAVING SEEN ANY PLA TROOPS IN THE VICINITY OF 
BEIJING\'S UNIVERSITY DISTRICT, HOWEVER. 
 
ANONYMOUS CALLER REPORTS CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
15.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PARTY CONVENED A CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE (CCPCC) MEETING SOMETIME BETWEEN THE NIGHT 
OF MAY 19 AND EARLY THIS MORNING AT WHICH MEMBERS 
DISSENTED WITH THE DECISION TO EMPLOY THE PLA TO 
RESTORE ORDER IN BEIJING.  AN ANONYMOUS CALLER WHO 
PHONED CONGEN SHENYANG ON THE MORNING OF MAY 21 SAID 
THAT THE PARTY HAD CONVENED A CCPCC MEETING AND THAT 
CHAIRMAN OF THE ALL CHINA FEDERATION OF LABOR UNIONS 
NI ZHIFU CONDEMNED THE DECISION TO IMPOSE MARTIAL LAW. 
 
16.  ACCORDING TO THE CALLER, NI DEMANDED AN END TO 
MARTIAL LAW AND A POSITIVE REASSESSMENT OF THE 
STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS.  HE ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT HOLD TALKS WITH STUDENT LEADERS.  THE 
CALLER CLAIMED THAT NI THREATENED TO LEAD A GENERAL 
STRIKE IF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE FAILED TO ACCEPT HIS 
DEMANDS.  THE CALLER DID NOT STATE WHEN OR WHERE THE 
MEETING WAS HELD OR IF OUT-OF-TOWN MEMBERS ATTENDED. 
 
 
PEOPLE\'S DAILY COVERAGE SUGGESTS LI PENG GOVERNMENT 
HAS INCOMPLETE CONTROL OVER PRESS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
17.  THE MAY 20 AND 21 EDITIONS OF THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY 
INDICATE THAT LI PENG MAY NOT HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER 
THE PRESS.  THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MAY 20 EDITION 
SHOWS COVERAGE OF THE LI PENG AND YANG SHANGKUN 
SPEECHES OF MAY 19.  IT SHOWS PICTURES OF YANG AND 
LI.  HOWEVER, THE UPPER RIGHT SIDE OF THE FRONT PAGE 
DISPLAYS A LARGER PICTURE OF ZHAO ZIYANG ADDRESSING 
STUDENTS AT TIANANMEN ON THE MORNING OF MAY 19. 
BENEATH A HEADLINE STATING THAT ZHAO AND LI PENG 
VISITED THE STUDENTS, BOLDFACED CHARACTERS ANNOUNCE 
THAT \"PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY ZHAO SINCERELY HOPES 
THAT STUDENTS WILL LIVE TO SEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS.\" 
 
18.  THIS EDITION MUST HAVE BEEN PRINTED AFTER ZHAO\'S 
RUMORED RESIGNATION/REMOVAL AND AFTER LI AND YANG 
DELIVERED THEIR MAY 19 CALLS FOR THE RESTORATION OF 
ORDER IN THE CAPITAL.  THE COVERAGE OF ZHAO\'S VISIT 
TO TIANANMEN, AS WELL AS THE USE OF HIS FORMAL TITLE 
FURTHER CLOUD THE QUESTION OF ZHAO\'S PRESENT STATUS 
AND WHEREABOUTS. 
 
19.  THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MAY 21 EDITION OF THE 
PEOPLE\'S DAILY HEADLINES THE IMPOSITION OF MARTIAL 
LAW AND THE ISSUANCE OF BEIJING MUNICIPAL 
IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, A SMALL BOX 
IN THE LOWER LEFT OF THE PAGE HEADLINED \"THE FIRST 
DAY OF MARTIAL LAW\" REPORTS THAT AS OF 4:30 AM, MAY 
21, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS CONTINUED TO 
OCCUPY TIANANMEN SQUARE AND THAT MARCHERS STILL ENTER 
THE SQUARE DURING THE DAY.  WE READ THIS ARTICLE AS A 
SIGNAL TO PROVINCIAL READERS THAT MARTIAL LAW HAS SO 
FAR FAILED TO CONTROL THE SITUATION IN BEIJING. 
CONGENS SHANGHAI AND GUANGZHOU HAVE REPORTED THAT 
THERE IS A NEWS BLACKOUT ON EVENTS IN BEIJING IN 
THESE CITIES.  WE DO NOT KNOW IF TODAY\'S EDITION OF 
THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE OF 
BEIJING, HOWEVER.

TO 300,000 OR MORE ON THE EVENING OF MAY 21;

REF:  BEIJING 14053 AND PREVIOUS 
 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  ACTIVISTS AND ONLOOKERS RETURNED TO 
TIANANMEN SQUARE IN LARGE NUMBERS ON THE EVENING OF 
MAY 21 AMID WIDESPREAD RUMORS THAT PLA TROOPS WOULD 
ATTACK THE SQUARE IN THE EARLY HOURS OF MAY 22.  BY 
2100 (LOCAL TIME), THE CROWD HAD GROWN TO OVER 
300,000.  THERE WERE AT LEAST 50,000 ACTIVISTS IN THE 
SQUARE, WITH MORE ARRIVING EVERY MINUTE.  THE 
GOVERNMENT DENIED CLAIMS BY STUDENTS THAT PREMIER LI 
PENG HAD ORDERED THE ARMY TO MOVE INTO THE SQUARE AT 
O500 ON MAY 22 AND KILL OR CAPTURE ALL THE STUDENTS 
THERE.  STUDENTS HAD A BUS IN POSITION TO BLOCK THE 
POSSIBLE EMERGENCE OF TROOPS FROM THE WEST EXIT OF 
THE TRAIN STATION, AND WERE USING LARGE CONTINGENTS 
OF ACTIVISTS TO BLOCK MAJOR INTERSECTIONS NEAR 
TIANANMEN SQUARE.  MEDIA SOURCES REPORTED THAT THREE 
AIDES TO ZHAO ZIYANG HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, AND THAT THE 
MILITARY HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF PEOPLE\'S DAILY AND 
CCTV.  EARLIER IN THE DAY, FOREIGN NEW AGENCIES 
PREDICTED THAT THEIR LINES WOULD BE CUT SOON.  THEY 
ARE USING TRAVELLERS TO GET VIDEO MATERIAL OUT OF THE 
COUNTRY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
TIANANMEN CROWD NUMBERS 300,000 AT 2100 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  AT 1900 ON MAY 21, THE CROWD AT TIANANMEN WAS 
RELATIVELY LIGHT, NUMBERING ABOUT 150,000 TO 
200,000.  ABOUT 50,000 OF THAT NUMBER WERE ACTIVISTS 
ON THE SQUARE.  STUDENTS WERE SPREADING THE WORD OF 
\"LI PENG\'S THREE POINTS\" (SEE BELOW), CALLING ON 
ONLOOKERS TO SUPPORT THEM WHEN THE SOLDIERS ARRIVED 
EARLY ON MAY 22.  STUDENTS TOLD EMBOFFS THAT THE 
CROWD WOULD INCREASE IN NUMBER AFTER NIGHTFALL, IN 
EXPECTATION OF THE ARMY\'S ARRIVAL.  BY 2100, THE 
CROWD HAD GROWN TO ABOUT 300,000.  ACTIVISTS WERE 
BEING FERRIED IN BY TRUCKS, BUSES, AND CARS. 
ONLOOKERS WERE BICYCLING INTO THE TIANANMEN AREA. 
AT 2100 ONE OF THE OUTER GRANDSTANDS AT THE 
NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE SQUARE WAS FULL. 
 
 
GOVERNMENT DENIES ATTACK ORDERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.  ALL THROUGH THE DAY ON MAY 21, STUDENTS IN THE 
SQUARE WERE SPREADING THE WORD THAT THE ARMY HAD 
RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO ATTACK THE 
STUDENTS AT O500 (LOCAL TIME) ON MAY 22.  STUDENTS 
CLAIMED THAT SYMPATHETIC SOURCES IN THE GOVERNMENT 
HAD INFORMED THEM THAT TROOPS HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED BY 
PREMIER LI PENG TO CLEAR THE SQUARE, \"EVEN IF 200,000 
STUDENTS WERE KILLED.\"  PRISONS WERE BEING CLEARED TO 
HOUSE STUDENTS, STUDENTS SAID, AND CLEAN-UP CREWS 
ALERTED TO TIDY UP THE SQUARE AS SOON AS THE STUDENTS 
WERE REMOVED.  CNN REPORTED THIS INFORMATION ON MAY 
21, CITING STUDENT SOURCES.  AT 2230 ON MAY 21, THE 
GOVERNMENT ISSUED A DENIAL THAT ANY SUCH ORDER HAD 
BEEN GIVEN.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S STATEMENT, REPEATED 
SEVERAL TIMES OVER RADIO AND TELEVISION, RECOUNTED 
EACH ELEMENT OF THE ALLEGED \"ORDER\" AS DESCRIBED BY 
THE STUDENTS AND DENIED THAT ANY PART OF IT WAS 
TRUE.  CITIZENS WERE WARNED TO BEWARE OF RUMOR 
MONGERS. 
 
 
THE CROWD\'S MOOD:  STUDENTS PREPARED TO DIE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  EMBOFFS SPOKE TO QINGHUA UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO 
WERE GUARDING ONE EXIT FROM THE QIANMEN SUBWAY.  THE 
STUDENTS, EXPECTING TO BE ATTACKED IN THE EARLY 
MORNING HOURS OF MAY 22, SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT 
USE VIOLENCE AGAINST THE SOLDIERS.  THE YOUTHS SAID 
THEY WERE PREPARED TO DIE TO STOP THE ARMY FROM 
CLEARING TIANANMEN SQUARE OF STUDENTS.  THE 
ONLOOKERS AND STUDENTS SEEMED ENERGETIC AND 
DETERMINED IN THE MID-EVENING HOURS OF MAY 21. 
 
 
TRAIN STATION:  WEST EXIT BLOCKED 
--------------------------------- 
 
6.  AS NOTED SITREP 7, THERE ARE CONFIRMED REPORTS 
OF A TROOP TRAIN AT THE TRAIN STATION.  STUDENTS ON 
THE SQUARE TOLD EMBOFFS THAT THEY HAD SENT 
EMISSARIES TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION AT THE 
BEIJING TRAIN STATION.  BETWEEN 2130 AND 2145, 
EMBOFFS SAW AN EMPTY BUS BLOCKING THE WEST EXIT OF 
THE TRAIN STATION, THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE TO THE 
SQUARE FROM THE STATION.  EMBOFFS ESTIMATED THAT UP 
TO SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE IN THE VICINITY OF THE 
TRAIN STATION.  THE TRAINS APPEARED  TO BE RUNNING 
NORMALLY DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS OF MAY 21. 
EMBOFFS MET A WORKER IN THE SQUARE WHO HAD ARRIVED 
BY TRAIN FROM NANJING THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 21.  THE 
WORKER HAD SEEN SOLDIERS CARRYING  RIFLES AND 
AMMUNITION ON HIS TRAIN, BUT HE SAID THAT THEY WERE 
FEW IN NUMBER.  AT 2200, EMBOFFS WITNESSED ORDINARY 
TRAVELERS EMERGING FROM THE BEIJING STATION, 
CARRYING LUGGAGE. 
 
 
CHONGWENMEN BLOCKADE:  STUDENTS TAKE THE LEAD 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  EMBOFFS INTERVIEWED STUDENTS AT CHONGWENMEN 
INTERSECTION, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS TYPICAL OF OTHERS 
NEAR THE TIANANMEN AREA.  SIX TO EIGHT THOUSAND 
STUDENTS WERE PRESENT AT THE INTERSEOCTION.  A 
STUDENT FROM XIAN WAS DIRECTING THE CROWD, ABOUT 
HALF OF WHOM WERE STUDENTS.  IN ADDITION TO THE 
CROWD IN THE INTERSECTION, THERE WERE LARGE NUMBERS 
OF PEOPLE BEYOND THE BLOCKADE.  IN TALKING WITH 
PEOPLE AT THE INTERSECTION, EMBOFFS WERE TOLD THAT 
ALTHOUGH LOCAL PARTY COMMITTEES WERE NOT INVOLVED 
MANY PARTY MEMBERS WERE.  THE PARTICIPANTS TOLD 
EMBOFFS THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT THE MILITARY WAS 
GOING TO ADVANCE ON THE STUDENTS IN THE EARLY 
MORNING HOURS OF MAY 22. 
 
 
ZHAO AIDES REPORTEDLY ARRESTED 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  A FOREIGN MEDIA SOURCE QUOTED A CHINESE 
JOURNALIST TO TELL EMBOFF THAT THREE AIDES TO 
GENERAL SECRETARY ZHAO ZIYANG HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. 
THE AIDES WERE IDENTIFIED AS BAO TONG, WU JIAXIANG, 
AND CHEN XIAOLU. 
 
 
PRESS PROBLEMS 
-------------- 
 
9.  UPI AND OTHER AGENCIES EXPECT TO \"HAVE THEIR 
PLUGS PULLED\" ON THE NIGHT OF MAY 21.  ONE NETWORK 
WAS THREATENED MAY 20 WITH HAVING ALL OF ITS IDD 
PHONES CUT OFF, BUT MANAGED TO AVERT THIS THROUGH 
NEGOTIATION.  THE NETWORKS ARE ALL USING TRAVELLERS 
TO GET VIDEO MATERIAL OUT OF THE COUNTRY; THE USE OF 
SATELLITE FOR REPORTING IS OUT OF THE QUESTION, AND 
CCTV FACILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO FOREIGN TV 
NETS.  RUMORS ABOUND THAT THE MILITARY HAS TAKEN OVER 
CCTV AND THAT CENSORSHIP OF THE PRINT MEDIA IS IN 
EFFECT.  A U.S. NETWORK SOURCE REPORTED THAT 75 
MILITARY OFFICIALS IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES TOOK CONTROL 
OF THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY ON THE MORNING OF MAY 21.  NONE 
OF THESE REPORTS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED.

REF:  BEIJING 14054 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  ON MAY 21, ONCE AGAIN STUDENTS AND THEIR 
SUPPORTERS WENT ALL OUT TO BLOCK AN EXPECTED ENTRANCE 
BY PLA TROOPS INTO BEIJING.  ONCE AGAIN, ROADBLOCKS 
WERE SET UP AT ALL MAJOR INTERSECTIONS AND MANNED BY 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEMONSTRATORS.  AND ONCE 
AGAIN, THE ARMY DID NOT SHOW.  THE SENSE OF VICTORY 
WHICH THE WEARY DEMONSTRATORS CELEBRATED AT DAYBREAK 
APPEARED LARGER THAN JUST ONE MORE NIGHT OF DEFIANCE, 
THE NINTH NIGHT OF THE TIANANMEN OCCUPATION.  A 
WIDESPREAD VIEW AMONG DEMONSTRATORS WAS THAT AFTER 
THIS NIGHT AND FORTY-EIGHT SURREAL HOURS OF 
NON-ENFORCED MARTIAL LAW, THE PROVERBIAL \"MANDATE\"-- 
POLITICAL LEGITIMACY--OF THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP HAS 
BEEN LOST.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, OF COURSE, WHETHER 
THE LEADERSHIP AGREES.  WE HAVE JUST BEEN TOLD BY AFP, 
HOWEVER, THAT THEY ARE RUNNING A STORY, WHICH WE 
CANNOT/CANNOT CONFIRM, THAT LI PENG, HU QILI, QIAO SHI 
AND YAO YILIN RESIGNED AT A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING 
LAST NIGHT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ONCE AGAIN AT 1730 ON MAY 21, THOUSANDS OF BEIJING 
RESIDENTS BEGAN STREAMING TOWARD TIANANMEN AND TOWARD 
CRUCIAL TRAFFIC INTERSECTIONS.  THE TENSION WAS 
NOTICEABLY LESS THAN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT, SINCE THE 
PREVENTION OF PLA ENTRANCE INTO THE CITY AT THAT TIME 
GREATLY BOOSTED CONFIDENCE.  STILL THERE WAS 
UNCERTAINTY AND A SENSE OF IMPINGING CONFRONTATION.  A 
STORY--PROBABLY APOCRYPHAL--WIDELY CIRCULATING IN 
BEIJING CLAIMED THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD ISSUED AN 
ULTIMATUM ON THE EVENING OF MAY 21 THREATENING 
MILITARY ACTION IF TIANANMEN SQUARE WERE NOT CLEARED 
(QINGLI GUANGCHANG) BY 0500 ON MAY 22. 
 
4.  THE CITY-WIDE NETWORK OF POPULAR-CONTROLLED 
STREETS EXPANDED OVER THE PREVIOUS EVENING, AS BOTH 
MORE PEOPLE GATHERED AT EACH INTERSECTION AND MORE 
INTERSECTIONS WERE \"OCCUPIED\" AND POLICED BY 
DEMONSTRATORS.  THE ROADBLOCKS WERE WELL-ORGANIZED, 
WITH LINES OF DEMONSTRATORS FUNNELLING CARS AND TRUCKS 
INTO A SINGLE LINE AND HEADBANDED YOUTHS CHECKING THE 
OCCUPANTS AND, OCCASIONALLY, THE ID\'S OF VEHICLE 
OCCUPANTS.  THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THESE BEIJING 
RESIDENTS WERE YOUNG WORKERS (LATE TEENS TO LATE 
TWENTIES) OR UNEMPLOYED YOUTHS. 
 
5.  TIANANMEN SQUARE ITSELF WAS QUIETER AND THE CROWD 
SMALLER THAN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT, LESS THAN 100,000. 
THE STUDENT ENCAMPMENT POPULATION WAS DOWN 
CONSIDERABLY, PERHAPS AS LOW AS 20,000.  ALL 
DEMONSTRATORS QUESTIONED EXPLAINED TO EMBOFF THAT THE 
REASON FOR THE LOW NUMBERS WAS THAT MANY OF THE 
STUDENTS HAD GONE TO JOIN ROADBLOCKS ON THE THIRD RING 
ROAD TO \"OPPOSE VIOLENCE WITH THEIR BODIES\" (YONG 
SHENTI KANG BAOLI).  THEY INSISTED THAT THE TOTAL 
\"REGULAR\" STUDENT POPULATION IN THE TIANANMEN 
ENCAMPMENT REMAINED ABOVE 200,000 WHEN THESE ABSENT 
STUDENTS WERE INCLUDED. 
 
6.  STUDENTS STATED THAT THEY HAD SWORN TO REMAIN IN 
THE SQUARE IN THE FACE OF THE 0500 DEADLINE, THE 
REPORT OF WHICH THEY CLEARLY BELIEVED TO BE TRUE.  A 
NUMBER OF DEMONSTRATORS EXPRESSED THEIR CONVICTION 
THAT THIS NIGHT WOULD BE PIVOTAL (JINTIAN WANSHANG SHI 
GUANJIANDE WANSHANG) IN THEIR STRUGGLE.  THE CRY \"DOWN 
WITH DENG XIAOPING, DOWN WITH LI PENG\" (DENG XIAOPING, 
LI PENG, XIATAI) REGULARLY BROKE THE NIGHT AIR. 
 
7.  UNANIMITY WAS THE ORDER OF THE DAY, WITH A LOW 
TOLERANCE FOR DISSENT AMONG THE DEMONSTRATORS.  WHEN 
ONE \"RECENT UNIVERSITY GRADUATE\" EXPRESSED TO EMBOFF 
DOUBT THAT THE PLA WOULD TRY TO ENTER TIANANMEN SQUARE 
THAT NIGHT, HE WAS VICIOUSLY CRITICIZED BY STUDENTS. 
WHEN HE SOUGHT TO EXPLAIN HIS CONCLUSION LOGICALLY, HE 
WAS FORCIBLY EJECTED FROM THE GATHERING.  THE 
DEMONSTRATORS DID NOT WISH ANY NOTE OF DISSENSION TO 
ENTER THEIR DISCUSSION, PARTICULARLY IN THE PRESENCE 
OF A FOREIGNER. 
 
8.  AT 0100, A DELEGATION FROM XINHUA CIRCLED THE 
SQUARE BEHIND A BANNER PROCLAIMING \"LET BLOOD FLOW TO 
OPPOSE FORCE\" (YIXUE KANGBAO).  SHORTLY AFTER, ABOUT 
1,000 MEMBERS OF THE RED-HEADBANDED \"BEIJING RESIDENTS 
DARE-TO-DIE BRIGADE\" (BEIJING SHIMIN GANSIDUI) ARRIVED 
IN THE SQUARE, FORMED THEIR OWN CIRCLE OF HANDS, AND 
BEGAN EXHORTING AND ENCOURAGING EACH OTHER TO THE TASK 
WHICH LAY BEFORE THEM, I.E., THE EXPECTED 0500 
CONFRONTATION.  THEY PROCLAIMED OVER AND OVER, \"WE ARE 
NOT AFRAID\" (WOMEN BU HAIPA) AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO 
SACRIFICE TO THE DEATH.  THIS \"BRIGADE\" WAS FORMED ON 
THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 20 AND, SAY MEMBERS, HAS A TOTAL 
MEMBERSHIP OF OVER 3,000; MEMBERSHIP CONSISTS ALMOST 
ENTIRELY OF YOUNG WORKERS AND UNEMPLOYED MALES.  THE 
\"MOTORCYCLE BRIGADE\" (MOTUOCHE DUI) REGULARLY ROARED 
AROUND THE SQUARE.  STUDENTS EXPLAINED THAT THESE 250 
\"PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURS\" (GETIHU) ARE NOT LIKE AMERICAN 
MOTORCYCLE GANGS (BANG), FOR THEY SERVE AS IMPORTANT 
SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION FOR THE 
STUDENTS. 
 
10.  AT DAWN, THE MOOD BEGAN TO LIGHTEN AND TENSION 
DISSIPATED.  JUBILANT MARCHERS BEGAN PASSING BEFORE 
THE TIANANMEN REVIEWING STANDS AND OF MOTORCYCLES 
RACED THROUGH THE SQUARE, HORNS BLARING IN 
CELEBRATION.  AT 0521, THE STREET LIGHTS IN THE SQUARE 
CLICKED OFF AND CHEERS OF VICTORY BROKE OUT. 
 
11.  AT 0550, THE LONG SILENT GOVERNMENT LOUDSPEAKERS 
ENCIRCLING TIANANMEN SQUARE STARTED UP AGAIN. 
\"CITIZENS OF BEIJING,\" BOOMED THE ANNOUNCER, \"BEIJING 
IS STILL IN DISORDER.\"  THE SITUATION, HE CONTINUED, 
\"MUST BE RESTORED TO NORMAL AT ONCE.\"  THE 
DEMONSTRATORS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER, STUNNED BY THE 
CONTRAST BETWEEN HACKNEYED OFFICIAL LINE AND WHAT THEY 
PERCEIVED TO BE THEIR MOMENT OF VICTORY.  THE 
ANNOUNCER CONTINUED WITH THE GOVERNMENT ORDERS:  \"YI 
(FIRST),\" BEIJING CITIZENS SHOULD RETURN TO THEIR 
NORMAL ORDER OF LIFE.  LAUGHTER RIPPLED THROUGH THE 
CROWD, THEN JEERING BROKE OUT.  \"ER (SECOND)\" ECHOED 
ACROSS THE SQUARE AS THE CROWD TOOK UP THE CHANT OF 
NUMBERS:  CITIZENS SHOULD RETURN TO WORK; \"SAN 
(THREE),\" STUDENTS SHOULD RETURN TO THEIR 
UNIVERSITIES; \"SI (FOUR),\" ETC. 
 
12.  WHEN EMBOFF ASKED THE CROWD AROUND HIM WHAT THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT MEANT, MOST SAID, \"IT MEANS NOTHING.\"  AN 
ELDERLY LADY SAID, \"IT MEANS THEY COULDN\'T ENTER THE 
CITY\" (JINBULAI).  A MIDDLE-AGED WORKER STATED 
SUCCINCTLY, \"IT IS OVER.  THEY ARE DEFEATED\". 
(SUANLE.  TAMEN SHULE).  WHEN THE BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT 
WAS REBROADCAST, IT WAS AT ONCE DROWNED OUT BY 
LAUGHTER AND JEERING. 
 
13.  EMBOFF RETURNED HOME THROUGH A DISORDERLY CITY. 
THERE WAS THE INEVITABLE DEBRIS OF LARGE CROWDS; THERE 
WERE STREET DIVIDER RAILINGS STREWN ABOUT, RIPPED UP 
TO THWART THE PLA ADVANCE THAT NEVER WAS; THERE WERE 
BUSES TURNED SIDEWAYS TO FORM ROADBLOCKS AT MAJOR 
INTERSECTIONS; AND THERE WERE THE PEOPLE, WEARY BUT 
CHEERFULLY GREETING EACH OTHER.  \"NI ZAO\" (GOOD 
MORNING, HOW ARE YOU), THEY CALLED OUT TO STRANGERS IN 
VERY UNBEIJING-LIKE BEHAVIOR.  MARCHING DELEGATIONS 
SALUTED EACH OTHER WITH CHANTS, AND PEOPLE THANKED THE 
DELEGATIONS.  MANY CALLED OUT TO EMBOFF, WHOM THEY 
TOOK TO BE A CORRESPONDENT, \"PLEASE QUICKLY REPORT 
THIS TO THE WORLD.\"  AT EACH CORNER CROWDS GATHERED 
AROUND SOAPBOX SPEAKERS.  THE TONE WAS ONE OF 
VICTORY.  \"TODAY IS THE PEOPLE\'S DAY, TOMORROW IS THE 
PEOPLE\'S DAY, FOREVER IS THE PEOPLE\'S DAY,\" PROCLAIMED 
ONE STUDENT. 
 
14.  MAY 21-22 WAS MORE THAN JUST THE NINTH NIGHT OF 
THE STUDENT OCCUPATION OF TIANANMEN SQUARE.  IT WAS A 
PSYCHOLOGICAL RUBICON; IN THE VIEW OF THE 
DEMONSTRATORS, AT LEAST, THE AUTHORITIES \"LOST.\"  IN 
THE MINDS OF MANY DEMONSTRATORS, THE LEADERSHIP\'S 
FAILURE TO CLEAR THE CITY LAST NIGHT WAS A DEFEAT 
WHICH CONSTITUTED LOSS OF THE PROVERBIAL \"MANDATE OF 
HEAVEN.\"

2.  POLOFFS VIEWED TIANANMEN SQUARE THE MORNING OF 
MAY 22 FROM 1000 TO 1100 HOURS LOCAL.  NO TROOPS 
WERE ANYWHERE IN SIGHT.  NO BUSSES WERE RUNNING, 
BUT PEOPLE APPEARED TO BE MAKING THEIR WAY TO WORK. 
POLOFFS ESTIMATED THAT THERE WERE FEWER THAN 10,000 
STUDENTS INSIDE THE INNER SQUARE ITSELF AND SOME 
40,000 PEOPLE, INCLUDING ONLOOKERS, IN THE AREA. 
 
 
3.  DEMONSTRATING STUDENTS APPEARED TIRED, DIRTY, 
AND GRIM.  SOME LOOKED ILL.  POLOFFS OBSERVED 
SEVERAL STUDENTS ON IV\'S.  THERE WERE CONFLICTING 
ACCOUNTS AS TO HOW MANY STUDENTS WERE STILL FASTING. 
ONE STUDENT SAID NONE, BUT MEDICAL SUPPORT STAFF SAID 
THERE WERE STILL SOME 50 TO 100 FASTING STUDENTS. 
THE INNER SQUARE, WHICH POLOFFS ENTERED, WAS FOUL- 
SMELLING AND NASTY IN APPEARANCE, WITH GARBAGE AND 
LITTER EVERYWHERE.  THE STUDENTS REMAINING IN THE 
SQUARE ITSELF APPEARED TO BE THE DETERMINED HARD CORE 
OF THE DEMONSTRATORS.  ALL STUDENTS EXPRESSED 
CONFIDENCE THAT TROOPS WOULD NOT COME BECAUSE THE 
STUDENTS HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE. 
 
 
4.  STUDENTS WERE EAGER TO TALK TO FOREIGNERS. 
THREE STUDENTS SEPARATELY TOLD POLOFFS THEY WERE 
DISAPPOINTED THAT     U.S. EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT 
FOR THE STUDENTS HAD NOT BEEN STRONGER.  THEY 
SPECIFICALLY CITED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATEMENT AS 
REPORTED ON THE VOICE OF AMERICA THE MORNING OF 
MAY 22. 
 
 
5.  THREE BUSSES IN THE SQUARE  FACING NORTH TOWARD 
THE PORTRAIT OF CHAIRMAN MAO (ABOVE THE ENTRANCE TO THE 
FORBIDDEN CITY) ALL BORE  PICTURES OF LI PENG AS A 
RAT BEING POUNCED ON BY AN EAGLE REPRESENTING THE

1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND HELMETED, ARMED TROOPS 
MOVED TOWARD BEIJING DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY 
EVENING HOURS OF JUNE 3.  AS OF 1930, LARGE CONVOYS 
HAVE BEEN STOPPED AS BEFORE BY BUS AND HUMAN 
BARRICADES.  THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF TROOP 
TRUCKS IS ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE CITY IN FRONT 
OF THE NEW WORLD TRADE CENTER, ABOUT 5-6 KILOMETERS 
FROM TIANANMEN SQUARE.  EMBOFFS SAW AT LEAST TWENTY 
TRUCKS THERE, BUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED HAD BEEN 
SEEN HEADING TOWARD THE CITY ON THAT ROUTE, SO WE 
ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED PLUS TROOP 
TRUCKS AT THAT LOCATION.  THE TROOPS ARE HELMETED 
AND ARE CARRYING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.  MOST OF THEM 
SEEM TO BE STAYING IN THEIR TRUCKS FOR THE TIME 
BEING.  MORE THAN 35 TRUCKS FILLED WITH HELMETED, 
ARMED TROOPS ARE STOPPED AT THE SECOND RING ROAD 
OVERPASS, DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE JIANGUOMENWAI 
DIPLOMATIC HOUSING COMPOUND.  THERE ARE REPORTEDLY 
82 TRUCKS BLOCKED BY FOUR LARGE DUMP TRUCKS ALONG 
THE ROAD TO CAPITAL AIRPORT.  WE ALSO HAVE REPORTS 
OF TWENTY SIX TRUCKS STOPPED AND SURROUNDED BY CITY 
RESIDENTS BETWEEN THE LIDO HOTEL AND THE GREAT WALL 
HOTEL IN THE NORTHEASTERN SUBURBS.  THERE ARE ABOUT 
TWO THOUSAND TROOPS JUST WEST OF THE GREAT HALL OF 
THE PEOPLE IN A STANDOFF WITH CITY RESIDENTS WHICH 
HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE EARLY AFTERNOON.  THE 
POPULATION APPEARS HOSTILE TO PLA MOVEMENTS INTO THE 
CITY. 
 
3.  ELITE AIRBORNE TROOPS ARE MOVING FROM THE SOUTH 
AND TANK UNITS HAVE BEEN ALERTED TO MOVE.  DAO 
OFFICERS ARE OUT CHECKING THE WESTERN SUBURBS.  DAO 
IS REPORTING FURTHER DETAILS TO WASHINGTON.  ALL 
EMBASSY INFORMATION SO FAR SUGGESTS THAT THE UNITS 
OTHER THAN THE AIRBORNE TROOPS ARE FROM THE 39TH 
ARMY. 
 
4.  THE TROOPS HAVE OBVIOUSLY NOT YET BEEN GIVEN 
ORDERS PERMITTING THEM TO USE FORCE.  THEIR LARGE 
NUMBERS, THE FACT THAT THEY ARE HELMETED, AND THE 
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS THEY ARE CARRYING SUGGEST THAT THE 
FORCE OPTION IS REAL.

2.  SUMMARY:  THE JUNE 3 EDITION OF THE PEOPLE\'S 
DAILY CARRIED A FRONT PAGE ARTICLE INDICTING \"A SMALL 
GROUP OF PEOPLE\" WHO ALLEGEDLY INCITED THE PRESENT 
TURMOIL IN BEIJING AND JUSTIFIED MARTIAL LAW.  THE 
ARTICLE WAS ISSUED BY THE BEIJING MUNICIPAL PARTY 
COMMITTEE, PROBABLY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF 
CONSERVATIVE POLITBURO MEMBER LI XIMING.  LI APPEARS 
TO BE SPEARHEADING THE ATTEMPT TO BRAND ZHAO ZIYANG 
AS A COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY. 
 
3.  THE EVENING TELEVISION NEWS ON JUNE 3 BROADCAST A 
STERNLY WORDED MARTIAL LAW HEADQUARTERS ANNOUNCEMENT 
STATING THAT TROOPS WILL USE ANY AND ALL MEANS TO 
ENFORCE MARTIAL LAW IN BEIJING.  AS THIS CABLE IS 
DRAFTED, THE MARTIAL LAW HQ IS WARNING BEIJING 
CITIZENS TO STAY OFF THE STREETS IN REPEATED 
TELEVISION BROADCASTS.  DEFENSE MINISTER QIN JIWEI 
ALSO APPEARED ON THE EVENING NEWS.  QIN, WHO IS 
RUMORED TO HAVE OPPOSED MARTIAL LAW, MAY HAVE BEEN 
REHABILITATED BY DENG XIAOPING IN ORDER TO COUNTER 
ENHANCED INFLUENCE AMONG PARTY ELDERS.  THE TV NEWS 
ALSO BROADCAST A BAFFLING ADDRESS BY LI PENG ON 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. 
 
4.  TENSION MOUNTED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON AS 
BEIJING RESIDENTS VENTED THEIR ANGER BY HARASSING 
MILITARY AND POLICE PERSONNEL AND ATTACKING THEIR 
VEHICLES.  STUDENTS DISPLAYED CAPTURED WEAPONS, 
MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES, INCLUDING IN FRONT 
OF THE ZHONGNANHAI LEADERSHIP COMPOUND.  AN EFFORT TO 
FREE STILL CAPTIVE MILITARY PERSONNEL OR TO CLEAR THE 
SOUTHERN ENTRANCE TO ZHONGNANHAI MAY HAVE BEEN THE 
CAUSE OF A LIMITED TEAR GAS ATTACK IN THAT AREA 
AROUND 1500 HOURS LOCAL.  AROUND THE SAME TIME 
SEVERAL THOUSAND UNARMED, BUT HELMETED, TROOPS TOOK 
UP POSITIONS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE GREAT HALL OF 
THE PEOPLE.  EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON, STUDENT 
LEADERS AND THE FOUR HUNGER STRIKERS HELD A PRESS 
CONFERENCE IN WHICH THEY THANKED THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR 
SUPPORT. 
 
5.  THE AMBASSADOR HAS REQUESTED THAT ALL EMBASSY 
PERSONNEL NOT ENGAGED IN REPORTING TO REMAIN AT 
HOME.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
PEOPLE\'S DAILY ARTICLE CONDEMNS CONSPIRATORS, 
JUSTIFIES MARTIAL LAW 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  THE FRONT PAGE OF THE JUNE 3 PEOPLE\'S DAILY 
CARRIED A LONG ARTICLE ISSUED BY THE BEIJING MUNICIPAL 
PARTY COMMITTEE PROPAGANDA BUREAU INDICTING THE \"SMALL 
GROUP\" OF CONSPIRATORS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING 
TURMOIL IN THE CAPITAL AND JUSTIFYING MARTIAL LAW AND 
THE POSSIBLE USE OF TROOPS.  THE OPENING SECTION OF 
THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE 
PLANNED TO CREATE TURMOIL FROM AS EARLY AS LATE LAST 
YEAR.  THESE PEOPLE\'S POLITICAL GOAL IS TO NEGATE THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY AND THE SOCIALIST SYSTEM. 
THEY PLANNED SECRETLY IN COLLUSION WITH INTERNAL AND 
DEMOCRATIC LEAGUE AND THE PUBLISHERS OF CHINA SPRING 
MAGAZINE.  AFTER THE DEATH OF HU YAOBANG, THE 
CONSPIRATORS SPREAD RUMORS TO ENFLAME THE SITUATION, 
ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE.  FINALLY, THESE PEOPLE 
MALEVOLENTLY TRAMPLED DEMOCRACY AND LAW TO SPREAD 
SERIOUS SOCIAL DISORDER. 
 
7.  IN A SECOND SECTION, THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS THAT 
DESPITE THE CESSATION OF THE MAY 13-21 STUDENT HUNGER 
STRIKE, THE CONTINUATION OF MARTIAL LAW IS NECESSARY 
TO RESTORE ORDER AND TO COUNTER THE MACHINATION OF 
THE \"SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE.\"  A FINAL SECTION EXHORTS 
READERS TO \"UNITE WITH THOSE WHO CAN BE UNITED AND 
EXPOSE THE SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE INCITING TURMOIL.\" 
IT VOWS THAT THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE 
DIALOGUE WITH STUDENTS AND OTHER GROUPS WITH 
GRIEVANCES.  IT NOTES THAT SOME WORKERS, CITIZENS, 
AND CADRES WHO SUPPORT THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT AND 
WHO MAY HAVE PARTICIPATED IN DEMONSTRATIONS WILL NOT 
BE PURSUED.  THOSE GROUPS OF \"HOOLIGANS\" SUCH AS THE 
\"FLYING TIGERS\" MOTORCYCLE BRIGADE AND THE \"SUICIDE 
BICYCLE BRIGADES\" WILL BE PUNISHED, THE ARTICLE 
STATES.  FINALLY, THE ARTICLE DEMANDS THAT THE \"SMALL 
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO INCITED THE TURMOIL\" BE EXPOSED. 
 
8.  WE BELIEVE THE ARTICLE TO HAVE BEEN DRAFTED UNDER 
THE GUIDANCE OF POLITBURO MEMBER AND BEIJING PARTY 
COMMITTEE SECRETARY LI XIMING.  AS WE HAVE REPORTED 
IN THE PAST, THE ARCH CONSERVATIVE LI HAS RESOLUTELY 
SIDED WITH LI PENG AND THE ELDERS AND APPEARS TO BE 
SPEARHEADING THE ATTEMPT TO LABEL ZHAO ZIYANG AS A 
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY.  IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING AN 
IDEOLOGICAL BASIS FOR MARTIAL LAW, THE ARTICLE 
EMPLOYS A VENOMOUS TONE THROUGHOUT IN ITS ATTEMPT TO 
TO ESTABLISH CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE SMALL GROUP OF 
CONSPIRATORS -- READ ZHAO ZIYANG AND HIS FOLLOWERS -- 
WITH ALLEGEDLY ANTI-PARTY AND ANTI-GOVERNMENT 
ACTIVITIES OF STUDENTS AND DEMONSTRATORS.  THE 
ARTICLE EVEN QUOTES ANTI-DENG AND ANTI-LI PENG BIG 
CHARACTER POSTERS PUT UP ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES SINCE 
THE DEATH OF HU YAOBANG. 
 
 
BEIJING MARTIAL LAW HEADQUARTERS ANNOUNCES THAT THE 
PLA WILL USE ANY AND ALL MEANS TO IMPLEMENT ORDERS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
9.  THE JUNE 3 CCTV EVENING NEWS REPORTED THAT 
MARTIAL LAW HEADQUARTERS ISSUED AN ANNOUNCEMENT 
CONCERNING THE ENTRY OF SOME TROOPS INTO THE BEIJING 
CITY CENTER ON THE NIGHT OF MAY 2 (SEE REFS. A AND 
B).  THE ANNOUNCEMENT CLAIMED THAT THE PLA IS BACKED 
BY THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE, BUT FEW HOOLIGANS 
INSULTED, HELD, AND BEAT PLA TROOPS WHO ENTERED THE 
CITY.  SOME PEOPLE EVEN STOLE WEAPONS, THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT SAID.  IT FURTHER STATED THAT NO ONE HAS 
THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE WITH TROOPS ATTEMPTING TO 
IMPLEMENT ORDERS.  THE PLA WILL USE ANY AND ALL MEANS 
TO ENFORCE MARTIAL LAW IN THE CAPITAL.  ANYONE 
ORGANIZING RESISTANCE TO THE TROOPS WILL SUFFER THE 
CONSEQUENCES, THE ANNOUNCEMENT STATED.  AS THIS CABLE 
IS DRAFTED, BEIJING TELEVISION IS REPEATEDLY 
BROADCASTING A MARTIAL LAW HQ WARNING TO BEIJING 
CITIZENS TO STAY OFF THE STREETS. 
 
 
DEFENSE MINISTER QIN JIWEI APPEARS 
---------------------------------- 
 
10.  CCTV NEWS ALSO REPORTED THAT ON JUNE 3, DEFENSE 
MINISTER QIN JIWEI VISITED PLA TROOPS ENCAMPED 
OUTSIDE OF BEIJING.  QIN WAS WIDELY BELIEVED TO HAVE 
OPPOSED THE MAY 20 MARTIAL LAW DECLARATION.  HOWEVER, 
HIS APPEARANCE FOLLOWS BY SEVERAL DAYS A SIMILAR 
APPEARANCE BY PARTY CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION 
MEMBER HONG XUEZHI, WHO ALSO WAS RUMORED TO OPPOSE 
MARTIAL LAW.  QIN WAS SEEN IN THE COMPANY OF A GROUP 
OF HIGH RANKING PLA OFFICERS CASUALLY CHATTING WITH 
TROOPS. 
 
11.  THE TV NEWS QUOTED QIN AS DELIVERING GREETINGS 
FROM DENG XIAOPING AND YANG SHANGKUN.  THE 
APPEARANCES OF BOTH QIN AND HONG STRONGLY SUGGEST 
THAT THEY HAVE CUT A DEAL WITH AT LEAST DENG XIAOPING 
IN WHICH THEY SUPPORT SOME FORM OF MARTIAL LAW IN RETURN 
FOR THEIR CONTINUED POLITICAL HEALTH.  IT HAS BEEN RUMORED 
IN BEIJING THAT DENG MAY NEED THE TWO IN ORDER TO 
COUNTER THE INCREASED INFLUENCE OF PARTY ELDERS, 
PERHAPS INCLUDING YANG SHANGKUN, IN THE WAKE OF 
ZHAO ZIYANG\'S POLITICAL DEMISE. 
 
 
LI PENG DISCUSSES ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES (|?) 
------------------------------------------- 
 
12.  THE LEAD ITEM ON THE JUNE 3 EDITION OF THE 
NIGHTLY TELEVISION WAS RESERVED FOR PREMIER LI PENG, 
WHO APPARENTLY DELIVERED AN ADDRESS ON CHINESE 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ON THE SAME DAY.  LI WAS SHOWN 
SITTING STIFFLY AT A TABLE WITH A MICROPHONE.  HE 
FACED THE CAMERA RIGIDLY AND READ FROM A TELEPROMPTER 
WITH A TONE OF VOICE SIMILAR TO THAT OF HIS MAY 19 
SPEECH ON THE NEED FOR LAW AND ORDER.  WE WERE 
BAFFLED BY THIS APPEARANCE, IN WHICH THE PREMIER MADE 
NO OBVIOUS REFERENCES TO THE SITUATION IN BEIJING. 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A NOT VERY REFINED ATTEMPT TO SHOW 
THAT LI IS IN CHARGE AND STILL ABLE TO FOCUS ON 
DAY-TO-DAY STATE COUNCIL BUSINESS.  HOWEVER, THE 
BEIJING MARTIAL LAW HQ ANNOUNCEMENT IMMEDIATELY 
FOLLOWED THIS SEGMENT. 
 
 
THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 3 
---------------------- 
 
13.  TENSION MOUNTED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON ALL 
OVER BEIJING AS RESIDENTS VENTED THEIR ANGER OVER THE 
ENTRANCE OF TROOPS IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF 
JUNE 3.  EMBOFFS ENCOUNTERED A NUMBER OF INCIDENTS IN 
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN WHICH CROWDS HARASSED MILITARY 
OR POLICE PERSONNEL, FORCED THEIR VEHICLES TO TURN 
AROUND, JEERED AT DISPLAYS OF CAPTURED MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT, OR VANDALIZED CAPTURED MILITARY VEHICLES. 
ONE OF THE HOTTEST AREAS WAS ON CHANGANDAJIE BETWEEN 
THE SOUTH ENTRANCE OF THE ZHONGNANHAI LEADERSHIP 
COMPOUND AND THE BUS-BARRICADE AT THE XIDAN 
INTERSECTION.  A BAMBOO TRIPOD SET UP DIRECTLY IN 
FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE TO ZHONGNANHAI BORE CAPTURED 
MILITARY EQUIPMENT INCLUDING A BAYONET, A TENT STAKE, 
MILITARY SHOES AND CLOTHING.  FURTHER DOWN THE STREET 
TOWARD THE XIDAN INTERSECTION A DISABLED MILITARY BUS 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET ALSO DISPLAYED CAPTURED 
EQUIPMENT. ON TOP OF THE BUS A SMALL TABLE HAD BEEN 
PLACED ON WHICH THERE WAS A MACHINE GUN ON A TRIPOD, 
TWO AK-47S, A HELMET, A PLA HAT, AND A BANNER (ONLY 
PARTIALLY VISIBLE) READING \"THIS IS LI PENG\'S...\" 
THOUSANDS OF ONLOOKERS CROWDED AROUND THE DISPLAYS, 
TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS AND CHEERING THE IMPROMPTU 
SPEECHES DENOUNCING THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
 
A STRIKE PLANNED? 
----------------- 
 
14.  A BEIJING REVIEW JOURNALIST STOPPED ONE POLOFF 
NOT FAR FROM THE XIDAN INTERSECTION, EAGER TO EXPLAIN 
THE DAY\'S EVENTS.  THE JOURNALIST REPORTED THAT A 
MASSIVE DEMONSTRATION WAS PLANNED FOR 1400 HOURS 
LOCAL AND HE SAID IT HAD BEEN PROPOSED THAT A GENERAL 
STRIKE BE CALLED. 
 
 
STUDENT PRESS CONFERENCE 
------------------------ 
 
15.  EARLIER IN THE DAY AROUND NOON LOUDSPEAKERS IN 
TIANANMEN SQUARE BROADCAST A LENGTHY SPEECH BY 
SOMEONE IDENTIFYING HIMSELF AS A JOURNALIST REPORTING 
ON THE ENTRANCE OF TROOPS INTO THE CITY.  THOUSANDS 
OF BYSTANDERS LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AS THE JOURNALIST 
DESCRIBED HOW STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS EVENTUALLY 
PERSUADED THE SOLDIERS TO TURN AROUND.  AT 1300 HOURS 
LOCAL THE STUDENTS HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE NEAR THE 
\"GODDESS OF FREEDOM.\"  STUDENT LEADER WUERKAIXI LED 
OFF THANKING THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR 
CONCERN.  HE ALSO THANKED THE REPORTERS WHO AT \"GREAT 
RISK\" HAD COME TO COVER THE CONFERENCE.  HE THEN 
INTRODUCED THE FOUR HUNGER STRIKERS.  LIU SHAOBO, A 
DOCTOR OF LITERATURE AT BEIJING NORMAL UNIVERSITY, 
THANKED THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE 
STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY DURING THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WHEN 
LI PENG, UNDER THE \"RUSE OF ENFORCING MARTIAL LAW,\" 
HAD SENT IN ARMED TROOPS.  LIU SAID EVERYONE HAD A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO UPHOLD THE IDEAL OF DEMOCRACY FOR 
WHICH THE PEOPLE LONGED.  LIU SAID THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE.  HE SAID IT WAS CONTROLLED 
BY A SMALL MINORITY AND DID NOT REFLECT THE WISHES OF 
THE PEOPLE. 
 
16.  TAIWAN-RAISED MUSICIAN HOU DEJIAN ANNOUNCED THAT 
DONATIONS FROM THE MAY 27 CONCERT FOR FREEDOM IN HONG 
KONG HAD SO FAR TOTALLED 13,700,000 HONG KONG 
DOLLARS.  SUCH SUPPORT, HE SAID, SHOWED THE 
IMPORTANCE AND THE CORRECTNESS OF THE MOVEMENT. GAO 
XIN, BEIJING NORMAL UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND 
COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBER, SPOKE ABOUT HOW AS A PARTY 
MEMBER HE WAS DOING THE CORRECT THING BY FASTING.  HE 
WAS RESPONDING TO THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE WHICH WAS 
WHAT THE PARTY AND ITS MEMBERS WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. 
 
17.  IN RESPONSE TO A REPORTER\'S QUESTION,  LIU 
XIAOBO SAID THE MOVEMENT MUST CONTINUE ITS PEACEFUL 
METHODS TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS AND THAT THE PEOPLE MUST 
DO NOTHING OUT OF ANGER.  THE PRESS CONFERENCE ENDED 
WITH WUERKAIXI BEING RAISED UP ON OTHER STUDENTS\' 
SHOULDERS AND CARRIED AROUND THE SQUARE. 
 
 
A TEAR GAS ATTACK 
----------------- 
 
18.  ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, A FEW PLA SOLDIERS 
REMAINED CAPTIVE THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON ABOARD 
THEIR DISABLED BUSES IN THE FUYOUJIE INTERSECTION 
BETWEEN ZHONGNANHAI AND XIDAN.  AN EFFORT TO FREE 
THESE TROOPS MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF A TEAR GAS 
ATTACK IN THE AREA SOMETIME AFTER 1500 HOURS LOCAL. 
IT MAY HAVE ALSO BEEN AN EFFORT TO CLEAR JEERING 
CROWDS FROM THE FRONT OF ZHONGNANHAI.  IN EITHER 
CASE, IT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN A LIMITED ATTACK. 
THERE WERE ALSO SOME UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF BEATINGS. 
 
19.  ABOUT THE SAME TIME, SEVERAL THOUSAND TROOPS, 
UNARMED BUT WEARING HELMETS, APPEARED ON THE WEST 
SIDE OF THE GREAT HALL OF PEOPLE WHERE THEY SAT IN 
ROWS TWO-TO-THREE MEN DEEP.  THEY APPEARED 
WELL-DISCIPLINED.  SEVERAL BYSTANDERS WERE OBSERVED 
THROWING THINGS AT THE TROOPS, BUT THEY DID NOT 
RESPOND.  MEANWHILE THE EAST SIDE OF THE GREAT HALL, 
ON TIANANMEN SQUARE REMAINED RELATIVELY NORMAL. 
 
 
EMBASSY SECURITY 
---------------- 
 
20.  THE AMBASSADOR HAS REQUESTED THAT ALL EMBASSY 
EMPLOYEES NOT ENGAGED IN POLITICAL OR MILITARY 
REPORTING AND DEPENDENTS TO REMAIN AT HOME.  SECTION 
HEADS HAVE PASSED THE WORD TO EMPLOYEES.  EMBOFF IN 
VICINITY OF TIANANMEN SQUARE IS NOTIFYING ALL 
AMERICANS THAT HE ENCOUNTERS IN THE AREA TO LEAVE.

2.  SUMMARY:  AS OF 0145, ABC NEWS REPORTERS ON THE 
SQUARE REPORTED THE PRESENCE OF TROOPS AND RIOT 
POLICE ON THE SOUTHERN END OF TIANANMEN.  TEAR GAS 
AND GUNFIRE WERE REPORTED ON THE SQUARE.  EMBOFF SAW 
TRACERS BEING FIRED OVER THE SQUARE.  ABC JOURNALISTS 
SAID THAT TWO ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS WERE ON FIRE 
AT THE NORTHEAST AND NORTHWEST CORNERS OF THE 
SQUARE.  A BARRICADE NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF 
FUXINGMEN AND THE SECOND RING ROAD WAS BREACHED AS 
TROOPS ADVANCED ON THE SQUARE FROM THE WEST.  AS OF 
0250, THE SITUATION IN THE CENTER OF THE CITY WAS 
VERY CONFUSED.  TROOPS APPEAR TO BE ATTEMPTING TO 
CLEAR THE SQUARE FROM WEST TO EAST.  WE HAVE NO

DOUBT WILL BE HIGH (##) 
DEMONSTRATOR WHO LAID DOWN IN FRONT OF AN 
ADVANCING APC AND WAS RUN OVER.  UNCONFIRMED ACCOUNTS 
CITE SEVENTY DEAD AND MANY WOUNDED.  GIVEN THE 
AGGRESIVE PLA MOVES REPORTED BY ABC NEWS REPORTERS, 
WE EXPECT FINAL COUNTS OF DEAD AND INJURED TO BE VERY 
HIGH.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  STUDENTS SET DEBRIS THROWN ATOP AT LEAST ONE 
ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER AND LIT THE DEBRIS, 
ACCORDING TO EMBOFF NEAR THE SCENE.  ABC REPORTED 
THAT ONE OTHER ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER IS AFLAME. 
AT LEAST ONE BUS WAS ALSO BURNING, ACCORDING TO ABC 
NEWS REPORTERS ON THE SQUARE AT 0120.  THE 
EYEWITNESSES REPORTED THAT TROOPS AND RIOT POLICE 
WERE ON THE SOUTHERN END OF THE SQUARE AND TROOPS 
WERE MOVING TO THE SQUARE FROM THE WESTERN SIDE OF 
THE CITY.  THEY REPORTEDLY BROKE THROUGH A BARRICADE 
NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF FUXINGMEN AND THE SECOND 
RING ROAD.  DEMONSTRATORS\' BARRICADES HAVE SLOWED BUT 
NOT STOPPED THE TROOPS\' ADVANCE.  THERE HAS 
REPORTEDLY BEEN INDISCRIMINATE GUNFIRE BY THE TROOPS 
ON THE SQUARE.  WE CAN HEAR GUNFIRE FROM THE EMBASSY 
AND JIANGUOMENWAI DIPLOMATIC COMPOUND.  EYEWITNESSES 
REPORT TEAR GAS ON THE SQUARE, FLARES BEING FIRED 
ABOVE IT, AND TRACERS BEING FIRED OVER IT. 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO UNCONFIRMED REPORTS, SEVENTY HAVE 
BEEN KILLED AND LARGE NUMBERS WOUNDED.  ANOTHER 
REPORT CITED NINE DEAD AND OVER ONE-HUNDRED WOUNDED 
AT THE FUXING HOSPITAL.  THE CHILDRENS\' HOSPITAL 
INDICATED THAT IT HAD 11 DEAD.  WE HAVE A FIRM REPORT 
THAT AT LEAST ONE HAS DIED, HAVING BEEN RUN OVER BY 
AN APC.  EYEWITNESSES SAID THAT AN APC MOVING TOWARD 
THE SQUARE FROM THE EAST CRASHED THROUGH A BARRICADE 
AND PLOWED RIGHT THROUGH A CROWD ON CHANGAN STREET. 
FINAL NUMBERS OF DEAD AND WOUNDED COULD BE VERY HIGH, 
BASED ON EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF THE ARMY\'S ACTION 
THUS FAR. 
 
5.  THE SITUATION IN THE CENTER OF THE CITY IS VERY 
CONFUSED.  POLOFFS AT THE BEIJING HOTEL REPORTED THAT 
TROOPS ARE PUSHING A LARGE CROWD OF DEMONSTRATORS 
EAST ON CHANGANJIE.  ALTHOUGH THESE TROOPS APPEAR NOT 
TO BE FIRING ON THE CROWD, POLOFFS REPORT FIRING 
BEHIND THE TROOPS COMING FROM THE SQUARE. 
 
6.  A LARGE CONVOY OF MILITARY VEHICLES IS COMING 
TOWARD THE CITY FROM THE WESTERN SIDE OF BEIJING. 
 
7.  SOME UNITS HAVE NOT ADOPTED SUCH AGGRESIVE 
MOVES.  AT 0124, AN EMBASSY SPOUSE SAW TROOPS AT THE 
JIANGUOMENWAI OVERPASS NEXT TO THE DIPLOMATIC HOUSING 
COMPOUND TALKING CALMLY WITH THE CITY RESIDENTS 
BLOCKING THEIR PATH.  CONVERSELY, PANIC REPORTEDLY 
SET IN AMONG PEOPLE ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE CITY 
WHERE THE VIOLENCE HAS BEEN WORST THUS FAR.

E.O.12356:N/A 
TAGS:  PINS, PGOV, PHUM, CH 
SUBJECT:  CHENGDU STALEMATE 
 
REF:  CHENGDU 619 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.   SUMMARY:  AS OF 1600 ON 6/5, THERE IS A 
STALEMATE IN DOWNTOWN CHENGDU BETWEEN PROTESTERS WHO 
FLOOD THE STREETS AND CONTINUE TO BURN SOME VEHICLES, 
AND TROOPS WHICH HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN THE MUNICIPAL 
OFFICE COMPOUND AND OCCASIONALLY LOB TEAR GAS 
INEFFECTIVELY INTO THE CROWD.  STUDENTS REPRESENT A 
DISTINCT MINORITY OF THE CROWDS.  MANY WORKERS SAID 
THAT THEIR FACTORIES HAVE ALREADY UNOFFICIALLY GONE 
ON STRIKE, AND THE NUMBERS OF SPECTATORS FAR 
SURPASSES USUAL LEVELS ON THE MIDDAY STREETS.  NO NEW 
CASUALTIES ARE REPORTED, BUT DEATH TOLLS FROM THE 6/4 
RIOT CONTINUE TO MOUNT.  OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL AREA 
AROUND CHENGDU\'S MAO STATUE, CITY ACTIVITY APPEARS 
NORMAL, EXCEPT THAT NO POLICE OR TROOPS ARE IN 
EVIDENCE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   NO NEW FIGHTING OR CONFRONTATIONS HAVE TAKEN 
PLACE IN CHENGDU AS OF 1600 ON JUNE 5.  TROOPS FROM 
THE PEOPLE\'S ARMED POLICE AND FIRE-FIGHTERS 
ESSENTIALLY ABANDONED THE DOWNTOWN AREA AROUND THE 
MAO STATUE AS WELL AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE STILL 
SMOULDERING PEOPLE\'S MARKET AT APPROXIMATELY 0900, 
NOR ARE THE REGULAR POLICE EVIDENT ANYWHERE IN TOWN. 
THEY HAVE RETREATED TO THE SANCTITY OF THE MUNICIPAL 
GOVERNMENT COMPOUND NEXT TO THE MAO STATUE.  A FEW 
ON-LOOKERS HIJACKED A MUNICIPAL BUS, PARKED IN THE 
ENTRANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL COMPOUND TO CUT OFF EGRESS, 
AND SET IT ON FIRE AT ABOUT 1100.  THIS BURNED-OUT 
VEHICLE JOINS THE OTHER BUSES, FIRE ENGINES AND 
MILITARY VEHICLES BURNED ON 6/4.  CROWDS HAVE SET 
FIRE TO SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES AT AN EVER-EXPANDING 
RADIUS FROM THE CENTRAL MAO STAUTE DURING MIDDAY 
6/5.  TROOPS HAVE SEVERAL TIMES LOBBED TEAR GAS FROM 
THE MUNICIPAL COMPOUND INTO THE CROWD BUT WITHOUT 
NOTICEABLE EFFECT. 
 
3.   CROWDS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA NUMBER UP TO 10,000 
PEOPLE, MOSTLY WORKERS OR UNEMPLOYED YOUTHS.  THEY 
ARE FAR GREATER THAN WOULD BE USUAL ON A MONDAY AT 
MIDDAY, AND THEY HAVE CUT OFF ALL VEHICULAR TRAFFIC 
IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA NEAR THE MAO STATUE.  THERE ARE 
STUDENTS PRESENT, BUT THEY REPRESENT A DISTINCT 
MINORITY.  CONTRARY TO EARLIER RUMORS, THERE ARE NO 
TROOPS VISIBLE AT THE GATES OF ANY OF THE MAJOR 
CHENGDU-AREA UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, AND FOREIGN 
EXPERTS DO NOT REPORT ANY ON-CAMPUS PRESENCE. 
OUTSIDE THE SEVERAL BLOCKS AROUND THE MAO STATUE AND 
RENMIN NANLU -- THE TRADITIONAL DEMONSTRATION SITES 
-- LIFE IN THE CITY APPEARS TO BE NORMAL, WITH PEOPLE 
GOING ABOUT THEIR USUAL WORK AND ALL BUT A FEW 
GOVERNMENT-OWNED STORES OPEN FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL. 
MANY AMERICAN FOREIGN TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ARE NOW 
ATTEMPTING TO REUTRN TO THE U.S. IN THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS, A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE SCHEDULED COMPLETION OF 
CLASSES.  THEY REPORT THAT MANY STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY 
LEFT CAMPUS TO RETURN HOME OR TO JOIN THE PROTEST 
MOVEMENT. 
 
4.   SOME WORKERS IN THE CROWD SAY THEY HAVE ALREADY 
GONE ON STRIKE, ALBEIT UNOFFICIALLY, AND WILL NOT 
RETURN TO WORK UNTIL THE SITUATION HAS BEEN 
RESOLVED.  THE CITY GOVERNMENT ISSUED A NOTICE TO ALL 
WORK UNITS ON 6/5 REQUIRING THEM TO ORGANIZE THEIR 
WORKERS EFFECTIVELY TO PROTECT PROPERTY AND TO ENSURE 
EVENING GUARD DUTY.  THE REGULATIONS ALSO PROHIBIT 
CITIZENS FROM INTERFERING WITH THE FLOW OF POLICE 
TRAFFIC OR FROM RUSHING TO THE SITES OF FIRES OR 
UNREST.  MANY SHOPS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA REMAIN 
CLOSED. 
 
5.   ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN NO NEW REPORTED 
CASUALTIES SO FAR ON 6/5, APART FROM ONE UNCONSCIOUS 
YOUTH RUSHED FROM THE MAO STATUE TO A NEAR-BY 
HOSPITAL WITH NO APPARENT WOUND (PERHAPS OVERCOME BY 
TEAR GAS OR THE HEAT), THE 6/4 DEATH TOLLS FROM 
APPARENTLY CONFIRMED ACCOUNTS INCREASE.  A WORKER AT 
THE WEST CHINA MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL SAID THAT 
HIS HOSPITAL ALONE HAD HAD SEVEN DEATHS FROM THE 6/4 
RIOT, INCLUDING TWO STUDENTS OF THAT UNIVERSITY, AS 
WELL AS 35 INJURED STUDENTS.  A SENIOR OFFICIAL OF 
SICHUAN UNIVERSITY TOLD FOREIGN EXPERTS THAT NINE 
SICHUAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE NOW BEEN CONFIRMED 
DEAD, AND MANY MORE MISSING.  REPORTS OF GUNFIRE BY 
THE TROOPS ON 6/4 CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE AND GROW MORE 
SPECIFIC ABOUT THE TIME AND PLACE, BUT THESE REMAIN 
UNCONFIRMED. 
 
6.   THE STALEMATE CONTINUES AND THE RESTLESS CROWDS 
AWAIT EVENTUAL POLICE REACTION, PROBABLY SOME TIME 
DURING THE NIGHT.  DE WILDE.  END QUOTE.

SUBJECT:  LATIN AMERICAN DIPLOMAT EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT 
OF JUNE 3-4 EVENTS ON TIANANMEN SQUARE 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY  DURING A RECENT MEETING, A LATIN 
AMERICAN DIPLOMAT AND HIS WIFE PROVIDED POLOFF AN 
ACCOUNT OF THEIR MOVEMENTS ON JUNE 3-4 AND THEIR 
EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF EVENTS AT TIANANMEN SQUARE. 
ALTHOUGH THEIR ACCOUNT GENERALLY FOLLOWS THOSE 
PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THEIR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES PROVIDE 
ADDITIONAL INSIGHT AND CORROBORATION OF EVENTS IN THE 
SQUARE.  THEY WERE ABLE TO ENTER AND LEAVE THE SQUARE 
SEVERAL TIMES AND WERE NOT HARASSED BY TROOPS. 
REMAINING WITH STUDENTS BY THE MONUMENT TO THE 
PEOPLE\'S HEROES UNTIL THE FINAL WITHDRAWAL, THE 
DIPLOMAT SAID THERE WERE NO MASS SHOOTINGS OF 
STUDENTS IN THE SQUARE OR AT THE MONUMENT.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  DURING A RECENT MEETING, CHILEAN SECOND SECRETARY 
CARLOS GALLO AND HIS WIFE (PLEASE PROTECT) PROVIDED 
POLOFF AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR MOVEMENTS ON JUNE 3-4 AND 
THEIR EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF EVENTS AT TIANANMEN 
SQUARE.  ALTHOUGH THE GALLO\'S ACCOUNT GENERALLY 
FOLLOWS THOSE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THEIR UNIQUE 
EXPERIENCES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSIGHT AND 
CORROBORATION OF EVENTS IN THE SQUARE. 
 
4.  GALLO SAID THEIR EVENING BEGAN AROUND 2100 HOURS 
WHEN THEY FIRST HEARD THAT TROOPS WERE ENTERING THE 
CITY.  THE CHILEAN AMBASSADOR WAS HAVING DINNER AT 
THE DRAGON SPRING MOVENPICK HOTEL IN FAR WESTERN 
BEIJING; THE GALLOS WERE DISPATCHED IN THEIR OWN CAR 
TO ALERT THE AMBASSADOR AND BRING HIM HOME.  TAKING A 
CIRCUITOUS ROUTE NORTH OF THE CITY, THEY DID NOT SEE 
MUCH EVIDENCE OF THE VIOLENT EVENTS TO COME UNTIL 
THEY REACHED WESTERN BEIJING ON THE ROAD TO THE 
MOVENPICK HOTEL.  THE ROAD WAS FILLED FIVE ABREAST 
WITH MILITARY VEHICLES INCLUDING TANKS, APCS, AND 
TRUCKS FILLED WITH TROOPS HEADING INTO THE CITY. 
ONCE THE GALLOS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS DIPLOMATS, 
THE COUPLE WAS ALLOWED TO INCH ALONG THE SHOULDER OF 
THE ROAD; MRS. GALLO DROVE WHILE HER HUSBAND WALKED 
AHEAD OF THE CAR ASKING THE MILITARY VEHICLES TO MAKE 
SOME ROOM FOR THEIR CAR.  THEY REACHED THEIR 
AMBASSADOR AND MADE THEIR WAY BACK TO THEIR EMBASSY 
IN THE SANLITUN DIPLOMATIC AREA. 
 
5.  ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE SQUARE, 
THE GALLOS, AGAIN IN THEIR OWN CAR, DROVE TOWARDS 
TIANANMEN.  ALTHOUGH THEY ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL 
CIVILIAN MANNED BARRICADES AND PEOPLE WARNED THEM NOT 
TO GO ANY FURTHER AS THE ARMY WAS COMING, THEY WERE 
ALLOWED TO PROCEED.  THEY EVENTUALLY PARKED THEIR CAR 
JUST TO THE EAST OF THE MUSEUM OF THE CHINESE 
REVOLUTION AND WALKED TO THE SQUARE VIA AN ALLEY JUST 
SOUTH OF THE MUSEUM. 
 
6.  THE GALLOS POSITIONED THEMSELVES NEAR THE RED 
CROSS STATION AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS TO THE 
MUSEUM.  INITIALLY NOT MUCH WAS HAPPENING IN THE 
SQUARE AS MOST OF THE FIGHTING WAS TAKING PLACE TO 
THE WEST.  BODIES AND WOUNDED, HOWEVER, BEGAN TO 
ARRIVE AT THE RED CROSS STATION INDICATING THE EXTENT 
OF THE FIGHTING AND THE FACT THAT REAL BULLETS WERE 
BEING USED.  AS THE MILITARY BEGAN TO REACH THE 
OUTSKIRTS OF THE SQUARE AND SHOTS WERE FIRED IN THE 
VICINITY OF THE RED CROSS STATION, MRS. GALLO DECIDED 
SHE WANTED TO LEAVE.  THE GALLOS MADE THEIR WAY BACK 
TO THEIR CAR AND DROVE BACK TO THEIR APARTMENT IN 
SANLITUN.  GALLO DROPPED OFF HIS WIFE AND DROVE BACK 
TO THE SQUARE, AGAIN PARKING EAST OF THE MUSEUM. 
 
7.  CONTRARY TO THE EXPERIENCES OF MOST AMERICANS ON 
THE SQUARE, GALLO SAID THAT HE ESSENTIALLY WAS 
ALLOWED FREE PASSAGE AROUND THE SQUARE, EVEN WHEN 
SIGHTED BY TROOPS.  HE SAID AT ONE POINT HE WAS 
STANDING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF CHANGAN JIE, JUST WEST 
OF THE SQUARE, WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF TO THE REAR OF 
TROOPS ENTERING THE SQUARE FROM THE WEST.  HE SAID 
ALTHOUGH HE WAS SEEN, THE TROOPS PAID NO ATTENTION TO 
HIM AND HE EVENTUALLY PASSED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS 
TROOP LINES A COUPLE OF TIMES.  ANOTHER CHILEAN 
DIPLOMAT WHO STAYED AROUND XINHUAMEN AT ZHONGNANHAI 
HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE.  GALLO GUESSED THAT SINCE 
MOST OF THE TROOPS WERE FROM THE PROVINCES AND DID 
NOT USUALLY DEAL WITH FOREIGNERS, THEY FOLLOWED THE 
GENERAL PRACTICE OF LEAVING FOREIGNERS ALONE.  HE 
ALSO NOTED THAT HE WAS NOT CARRYING A CAMERA. 
 
8.  GALLO EVENTUALLY ENDED UP AT THE RED CROSS 
STATION, AGAIN HOPING THAT TROOPS WOULD NOT FIRE ON 
THE MEDICAL PERSONNEL THERE.  HE WATCHED THE MILITARY 
ENTER THE SQUARE AND DID NOT OBSERVE ANY MASS FIRING 
OF WEAPONS INTO THE CROWDS, ALTHOUGH SPORADIC GUNFIRE 
WAS HEARD.  HE SAID THAT MOST OF THE TROOPS WHICH 
ENTERED THE SQUARE WERE ACTUALLY ARMED ONLY WITH 
ANTI-RIOT GEAR--TRUNCHEONS AND WOODEN CLUBS; THEY 
WERE BACKED UP BY ARMED SOLDIERS.  AS THE MILITARY 
CONSOLIDATED ITS CONTROL OF THE SQUARE\'S PERIMETER, 
STUDENTS AND CIVILIANS GATHERED AROUND THE MONUMENT 
TO THE PEOPLE\'S HEROES.  GALLO SAID WOUNDED, 
INCLUDING SOME SOLDIERS, CONTINUED TO BE BROUGHT TO 
THE RED CROSS STATION. 
 
9.  THE TROOPS BEGAN A SLOW ORDERLY APPROACH TO THE 
MONUMENT FROM THE NORTH WITH SOLDIERS ON FOOT 
PRECEEDING APCS.  FROM WHAT HE COULD SEE, GALLO FELT 
THAT MOST OF THE TENTS ON THE SQUARE WERE EMPTY WHEN 
THE ARMORED VEHICLES ROLLED OVER THEM.  THE FIRST 
LINE OF TROOPS TO REACH THE MONUMENT AREA, PASSED BY 
THE RED CROSS STATION AND IGNORED THE MEDICAL 
PERSONNEL AND WOUNDED.  AS A SECOND LINE OF TROOPS 
APPROACHED, THEY CIRCLED THE RED CROSS STATION AND 
BEGAN YELLING AND THROWING STICKS AND DEBRIS OVER THE 
HEADS OF THE PEOPLE AT THE STATION.  THE MEDICAL 
PERSONNEL PANICKED AND FLED, LEAVING BEHIND THE 
WOUNDED.  MOST PEOPLE, INCLUDING GALLO, FLED TO THE 
MONUMENT AREA WHERE THE STUDENTS WERE GATHERED. 
 
10.  ALTHOUGH GUNFIRE COULD BE HEARD, GALLO SAID THAT 
APART FROM SOME BEATING OF STUDENTS, THERE WAS NO 
MASS FIRING INTO THE CROWD OF STUDENTS AT THE 
MONUMENT.  WHEN POLOFF MENTIONED SOME REPORTEDLY 
EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF MASSACRES AT THE MONUMENT WITH 
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, GALLO SAID THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH 
SLAUGHTER.  ONCE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED FOR THE 
STUDENTS TO WITHDRAW, LINKING HANDS TO FORM A COLUMN, 
THE STUDENTS LEFT THE SQUARE THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST 
CORNER.  ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE, INCLUDING GALLO, 
LEFT.  THE FEW THAT ATTEMPTED TO REMAIN BEHIND WERE 
BEATEN AND DRIVEN TO JOIN THE END OF THE DEPARTING 
PROCESSION.  ONCE OUTSIDE THE SQUARE, THE STUDENTS 
HEADED WEST ON QIANMEN DAJIE WHILE GALLO HEADED EAST 
TO HIS CAR.  THEREFORE, HE COULD NOT COMMENT ON 
REPORTS THAT STUDENTS WERE AMBUSHED AND SLAUGHTERED 
IN THE ALLEY JUST WEST OF THE SQUARE NEAR THE BEIJING 
CONCERT HALL. 
 
11.  LATER THE MORNING OF JUNE 4, GALLO AND HIS WIFE 
MADE THEIR WAY BACK TO THE SQUARE, AGAIN VIA THE 
ALLEY TO THE SOUTH OF THE MUSEUM OF THE REVOLUTION. 
HE SAID THAT FOR NO APPARENT REASON THAT ALLEY WAS 
THE ONLY ONE NOT SEALED OFF.  FROM THE ALLEY THEY SAW 
TROOPS CLEARING THE SQUARE PILING UP LARGE PLASTIC 
BAGS AND DRAGGING THEM TO HELICOPTERS.  THEY COULD 
NOT COMMENT ON WHETHER THE BAGS CONTAINED REFUSE OR 
BODIES.  AT THE TIME, THEY SAID, THEY COULD NOT 
IMAGINE THE BAGS CONTAINED BODIES AND HAD ASSUMED IT 
WAS GARBAGE.  ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT ACTUALLY WITNESS 
ANY LARGE SCALE SHOOTINGS ON THE SQUARE PROPER, GALLO 
SAW MANY CASUALTIES BROUGHT INTO THE SQUARE AND DID 
NOT DOUBT THAT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN BEIJING WERE 
KILLED BY THE ARMY ON JUNE 3 AND 4.  HE SAID THAT A 
SPANISH TELEVISION CREW MIGHT HAVE FOOTAGE OF THE 
REPORTED MASSACRE AT THE BEIJING CONCERT HALL AND 
THAT THE SPANISH AMBASSADOR WOULD BE HOLDING A 
SCREENING FOR OTHER AMBASSADORS WHEN HE RECEIVED A 
GOOD COPY.  APPARENTLY AN EARLIER VERSION OF THE TAPE 
HAD BEEN BADLY BUTCHERED BY EDITORS IN SPAIN WHO HAD 
SPLICED TOGETHER PIECES OF THE VIDEO IN THE WRONG 
SEQUENCE.

E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR 
TAGS: PGOV, CH 
SUBJECT:  PRC GOALS AFTER TIANANMEN:  THE 
          OFFICIAL VIEW FROM THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  ACCORDING TO A MINISTRY OF JUSTICE 
OFFICIAL, THE PRC NOW HAS FOUR PRESSING GOALS: 
COMPLETE ERADICATION OF \"COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY 
ELEMENTS\"; CONTINUATION OF ECONOMIC OPENNESS AND 
REFORM; POLITICAL EDUCATION OF THE MASSES; AND THE 
WEEDING OUT OF CORRUPTION.  ZHAO\'S LAXITY AND 
ACCEPTANCE OF FOREIGN PRINCIPLES HAD LED TO 
COUNTER-REVOLUTION, A MISTAKE THAT THE NEW LEADERSHIP 
WOULD NOT REPEAT.  WELCOMING SECRETARY BAKER\'S 
MEETING IN PARIS WITH FOREIGN MINISTER QIAN, THE 
OFFICIAL STRESSED THAT CHINA\'S POLICY OF OPENNESS TO 
THE OUTSIDE WORLD REMAINED UNCHANGED DESPITE EFFORTS 
TO PUNISH THE PRC FOR EVENTS OF JUNE 3-4.  WHILE THE 
OFFICIAL REPEATEDLY STRESSED THE LEADERSHIP\'S 
DETERMINATION TO CHECK CORRUPTION, HE REVEALED THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT YET DRAWN UP THE REGULATIONS 
TO IMPLEMENT THE CAMPAIGN -- AND TACITLY ADMITTED 
THAT THOSE REGULATIONS WOULD HAVE LOTS OF LOOPHOLES 
WHEN THEY WERE FINALLY PROMULGATED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ON AUGUST 8, POLOFFS MET WITH ZHANG YAOCHEN, 
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT OF 
THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE.  ZHANG, A PRE-CRACKDOWN 
CONTACT OF THE EMBASSY, HAD CAREFULLY PREPARED A 
LENGTHY PRESENTATION ON THE STEPS THE PRC LEADERSHIP 
HAS TAKEN SINCE THE TIANANMEN CRACKDOWN TO SOLIDIFY 
COMMUNIST PARTY RULE. 
 
CRUSHING THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  ZHANG NOTED THAT THE CCP HAD WON A \"DECISIVE\" 
VICTORY AGAINST THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS 
WHO WERE TRYING TO OVERTHROW CHINA\'S SOCIALIST 
SYSTEM.  THE AUTHORITIES HAD RESTORED ORDER 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND THE SITUATION HAD 
STABILIZED.  STILL, THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO CONTINUE 
ITS EFFORTS. 
 
5.  ZHANG SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT YET 
ARRESTED ALL THOSE WHO HAD HELPED ORGANIZE THE 
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY CONSPIRACY, ADVOCATED BOURGEOIS 
LIBERALIZATION, LIAISED WITH HOSTILE FOREIGN 
ORGANIZATIONS, OR ENGAGED IN LOOTING, ARSON, AND 
MURDER.  SO LONG AS THAT WERE THE CASE, MARTIAL LAW 
WOULD CONTINUE IN BEIJING.  ZHANG NOTED THAT CHINESE 
PEOPLE WERE NOT NEARLY AS CONCERNED AS FOREIGNERS 
ABOUT HOW LONG MARTIAL LAW WOULD REMAIN IN EFFECT. 
ACCORDING TO ZHANG, MOST CHINESE VIEWED MARTIAL LAW 
MERELY AS A MEANS TO ENSURE THAT THE SITUATION 
REMAINED CALM. 
 
6.   ZHANG REFUSED TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH LONGER IT 
WOULD TAKE THE GOVERNMENT TO ROUND UP ALL THE 
UNDESIRABLES AND WEAPONS.  HE ALSO SAID HE DID NOT 
KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN ARRESTED OR SENT TO 
PRISON AND WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO ESTIMATE HOW MANY 
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES REMAINED AT LARGE. 
 
ECONOMIC REFORM AND OPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  ZHANG STRESSED THAT ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC REFORM HAD 
LED TO SOME SOCIAL PROBLEMS, SUCH AS UNEVEN 
DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH, IT WAS THE ONLY PATH THAT 
CHINA COULD FOLLOW.  ECONOMIC OPENNESS MUST CONTINUE 
IF CHINA WERE TO DEVELOP.  ACCORDINGLY, CHINA WOULD 
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ITS RELATIONS WITH THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD. 
 
8.  THUS, THE PRC LEADERSHIP WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT 
\"DISTORTED\" ACCOUNTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA OF 
THE TURMOIL IN BEIJING HAD LED SOME WESTERN COUNTRIES 
TO IMPOSE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.  IN CONTRAST, ZHANG 
SAID, MOST OF THE THIRD WORLD HAD SUPPORTED CHINA\'S 
POSITION THAT THE TIANANMEN INCIDENT HAD BEEN 
STRICTLY AN INTERNAL AFFAIR.  SANCTIONS WERE DOOMED 
TO FAIL, ZHANG SAID.  HE NOTED THAT WESTERN NATIONS 
WERE ALREADY RESUMING NORMAL CONTACTS WITH BEIJING 
AND WERE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD \"REALLY\" 
HAPPENED IN BEIJING.  ZHANG POINTED, IN PARTICULAR, 
TO FOREIGN MINISTER QIAN\'S MEETING WITH SECRETARY 
BAKER WHICH, ZHANG ASSERTED, STRONGLY UNDERLINED THE 
FUTILITY OF TRYING TO ISOLATE CHINA. 
 
9.  ZHANG MORE THAN ONCE REITERATED HIS DESIRE FOR 
FRIENDLY SINO-U.S. RELATIONS.  HE REGRETTED THE 
CANCELLATION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S VISIT TO 
CHINA, BUT SAID THAT THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE LOOKED 
FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONTACT WITH THE U.S.  ZHANG 
STRESSED THAT, WHILE TWO COUNTRIES MIGHT DISAGREE ON 
CERTAIN ISSUES BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERENT HISTORIES, 
CULTURES, AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS, CONTINUED DIALOGUE WAS 
NECESSARY. 
 
EDUCATING THE MASSES 
-------------------- 
 
10.  ACCORDING TO ZHANG, WHEN DENG XIAOPING  HAD 
BEGUN HIS POLICY OF OPENNESS TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD, HE HAD INSISTED THAT IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING 
WOULD HAVE TO BE EMPHASIZED IN ORDER TO INSULATE 
CHINA FROM CORRUPTING FOREIGN INFLUENCES. 
UNFORTUNATELY, ZHANG NOTED, ZHAO ZIYANG, WHILE HE WAS 
GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE PARTY, HAD SADLY NEGLECTED 
IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING OF THE MASSES. 
 
11.  THE NEW LEADERSHIP HAD LEARNED FROM ZHAO\'S 
MISTAKES AND WOULD RELENTLESSLY PUSH FORWARD WITH 
IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING.  THE TRAINING WOULD EMPHASIZE 
THE FOUR CARDINAL PRINCIPLES:  KEEPING TO THE 
SOCIALIST ROAD; UPHOLDING THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE 
PROLETARIAT; UPHOLDING THE LEADERSHIP OF THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY; AND UPHOLDING MARXISM-LENINISM AND 
MAO ZEDONG THOUGHT.  ZHANG NOTED THAT PROPAGANDA 
MEETINGS WOULD HAVE TO BE A CONTINUOUS PROCESS.  \"THE 
LESSONS THEY TEACH ARE FORGOTTEN QUICKLY.\" 
 
12.  ZHANG SAID THAT HE SAW NO CONTRADICTION BETWEEN 
A PROFESSED POLICY OF OPENNESS AND A CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
BOURGEOIS LIBERALIZATION.  HE ARGUED THAT THE THE 
LATTER WAS NOT INTENDED TO EXCLUDE ALL WESTERN 
THOUGHT, BUT RATHER TO EDUCATE THE CHINESE PEOPLE SO 
THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ANALYZE AND REJECT 
UNSUITABLE IDEAS. 
 
ROOTING OUT CORRUPTION 
---------------------- 
 
13.  ZHANG LAID GREATEST EMPHASIS ON THE CENTRAL 
LEADERSHIP\'S DETERMINATION TO WEED OUT CORRUPTION. 
CORRUPTION, WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN A PROBLEM IN 
POST-LIBERATION CHINA, HAD FLOURISHED UNDER ZHAO, WHO 
LOOKED UPON IT AS \"INEVITABLE\" IF CHINA WERE TO 
PURSUE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  IN CONTRAST, ZHANG 
SAID, THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP REALIZED THAT 
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS HAD USED THE 
CORRUPTION ISSUE TO UNDERMINE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT.  CORRUPTION THUS HAD TO BE BROUGHT UNDER 
CONTROL. 
 
14.  ZHANG MAINTAINED THAT ONE IMPORTANT REASON WHY 
THIS ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN WOULD SUCCEED WHILE THE 
1987 ONE HAD FAILED WAS THAT IT WOULD START AT THE 
VERY HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND WORK ITS WAY 
DOWN.  PEOPLE WOULD SEE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
SERIOUS ABOUT FIGHTING CORRUPTION AND SPECIAL 
PRIVILEGES AMONG HIGH-LEVEL CADRES, AND WOULD THUS BE 
INSPIRED TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE CAMPAIGN AT LOWER 
LEVELS. 
 
15.  ZHANG ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD 
NOT YET PREPARED THE REGULATIONS NECESSARY TO 
IMPLEMENT THE 7-POINT ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN WHICH 
THE POLITBURO HAD ANNOUNCED ON JULY 28.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
IT WAS DIF FICULT TO DETERMINE WHO SHOULD BE AFFECTED 
BY THE BAN ON HIGH-LEVEL CADRES\' CHILDREN ENGAGING IN 
BUSINESS -- AND INDEED, WHAT KIND OF BUSINESSES 
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE BAN.  (NOTE:  THE POLITBURO 
ANNOUNCEMENT SINGLED OUT THE CHILDREN AND SPOUSES OF 
MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL POLITICAL BUREAU, THE 
SECRETARIAT AND THE STANDING COMMITTEE -- A 
FORMULATION THAT WOULD NOT INCLUDE DENG XIAOPING\'S 
CHILDREN, NOR A HOST OF OTHERS WHO HAVE PROFITTED 
FROM OFFICIAL CONNECTIONS.)  SIMILARLY, THE BAN ON 
THE IMPORT OF FOREIGN-MADE CARS ALSO COULD NOT BE 
INTERPRETED TOO RIGIDLY.  \"THAT, TOO, COULD LEAD TO A 
WASTE OF MONEY.\"  ZHANG SAID THAT THE MINISTRY OF 
JUSTICE, ALONG WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AND PARTY 
ORGANIZATIONS, WAS STUDYING THESE QUESTIONS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16.  ZHANG\'S REMARKS WERE A CAREFULLY PREPARED 
PRESENTATION OF CCP GOALS DURING THE POST-CRACKDOWN 
PERIOD.  ZHANG SPOKE VIRTUALLY NON-STOP FOR ALMOST 
NINETY MINUTES, NOTING THAT ANY QUESTIONS POLOFFS 
MIGHT HAVE WOULD BE ANSWERED IN THE COURSE OF HIS 
COMMENTS.  READERS OF THE CHINESE PRESS WILL FIND 
MOST OF HIS COMMENTS FAMILIAR.  ZHANG, LIKE THE 
PRESS, WAS LONG ON THEORY AND SHORT ON DETAILS AND 
FACTS.  HIS PRESENTATION, HOWEVER, MADE IT CLEAR 
THAT THE PRC VIEWS THE ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN AS 
KEY IN ITS EFFORTS TO REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE 
CHINESE PEOPLE.  THUS, WE WERE STRUCK THAT NEARLY TWO 
WEEKS AFTER AFTER THE POLITUBRO ANNOUNCED ITS 
SEVEN-POINT ANTI-CORRUPTION PROGRAM, THE CAMPAIGN, AT 
LEAST AS PRESENTED BY THE JUSTICE MINISTRY,  CONSISTS 
LARGELY OF RHETORIC -- WITH PLENTY OF LOOPHOLES FOR 
WELL-CONNECTED CADRES AND THEIR RELATIONS.

THE CASE OF WANG ZONGXIAO -- A CONVICTED NARCOTICS 
TRAFFICKER WHO WAS ALLOWED TO GO TO THE U.S. TO 
TESTIFY IN A NARCOTICS CASE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY FILED 
A CLAIM FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM THAT IS UNDER 
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW IN THE U.S. -- MIGHT WELL

TERRORISTS. 
 
D. RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION:  THE CHINESE 
OFFICIAL POSITION IS THAT THE PRC GOVERNMENT IS 
OPPOSED TO ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM AND DOES NOT 
SUPPORT OR HARBOR TERRORISTS.  THIS POSITION WAS 
MOST RECENTLY REITERATED BY A MINISTRY OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS SPOKESMAN REPLYING TO ALLEGATIONS IN THE 
INDIAN PRESS THAT ASSAMESE TERRORISTS WERE BEING 
TRAINED IN CHINA.  DURING THE GULF WAR THE CHINESE

POSSIBLE TARGETS FOR TERRORIST ATTACK.

1.  A PUBLISHED DELEGATE LIST FOR THE RECENT NATIONAL 
PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS LISTED POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE 
MEMBER HU JINTAO AS A DELEGATE REPRESENTING THE TIBET 
AUTONOMOUS REGION.  HU WAS REPLACED AS TAR PARTY 
SECRETARY ON DECEMBER 1, 1992 AND HAS NOT RESIDED IN 
TIBET FOR AT LEAST 18 MONTHS.  WITH HIS ELECTION TO 
THE POLITBURO LAST FALL AND HIS REPLACEMENT AS TAR 
SECRETARY, WE THOUGHT HIS DIRECT TIBET INVOLVEMENT 
HAD ENDED, BUT THIS IS APPARENTLY NOT TRUE. 
/ 
2.  THE TIBET DAILY LISTED HU JINTAO AMONG THE 17 
TIBET DELEGATES (THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY GAVE THE DELEGATE 
COUNT AS 19) TO THE NPC.  THE TIBET DAILY, REPORTING 
A MARCH 16 MEETING BETWEEN THE DELEGATION AND JIANG 
ZEMIN, IDENTIFIED CURRENT TAR PARTY SECRETARY CHEN 
KUIYUAN AS DELEGATION LEADER, BUT MENTIONED THAT HU 
JINTAO PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING AS A TAR DELEGATE. 
THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY ACCOUNT OF THE MEETING SAID HU 
JINTAO BRIEFED JIANG ZEMIN ON TIBET CONDITIONS. 
/ 
3.  CONGENOFF RECENTLY ASKED A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF 
THE TAR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICE DURING A VISIT TO 
LHASA WHY HU JINTAO, WHOSE SEPARATION FROM TIBET 
AFFAIRS HAS LONG BEEN COMPLETE IN PHYSICAL TERMS 
AND WAS RECENTLY SEVERED IN OFFICIAL  TERMS, WAS 
ON THE TAR DELEGATION TO THE NPC.  WE WERE TOLD 
THAT HU, DUE TO HIS LONG EXPERIENCE IN TIBETAN 
AFFAIRS, WAS ESPECIALLY QUALIFIED TO REPRESENT TAR 
INTERESTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. 
/ 
4.  COMMENT:  IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE TIBET CONNECTION 
FOR HU JINTAO WILL LINGER ON DESPITE HIS ELEVATION TO 
THE POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE.  WE SUSPECT THAT 
HIS EXPERTISE WILL GIVE HIM THE PRIMARY VOICE IN 
TIBET POLICY AMONG THE LEADERSHIP.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: CODEL ACKERMAN MEETING WITH ASSISTANT MINISTER 
         OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS YANG JIECHI, JANUARY 28 
 
1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY WILLIAM A. STANTON, POLMINCOUNS. 
REASONS: 1.5 B AND D. 
 
2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IN AN OTHERWISE CORDIAL JANUARY 28 
BREAKFAST MEETING WITH CONGRESSMAN ACKERMAN, ASSISTANT 
MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS YANG JIECHI PASSIONATELY 
ARGUED THAT CHINA HAD NOT REPEALED THE HONG KONG BILL OF 
RIGHTS.  CHINA, YANG SAID, WAS MERELY TRYING TO MAKE THE 
BILL OF RIGHTS COMPATIBLE WITH THE SUPREMACY OF THE BASIC 
LAW.  THE BASIC LAW, HE STATED, ALREADY PROVIDED FOR 
HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND FREEDOM 
OF THE PRESS.  YANG COMMENTED HONG KONG\'S SUCCESSFUL 
REVERSION TO CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY COULD PERHAPS BE THE 
MODEL FOR RESOLVING THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN.  NOTING CHINA\'S 
ECONOMIC SUCCESSES AND THE EXPECTATION THAT FOREIGN TRADE 
WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW, YANG EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT WITH 
\"FEWER RESTRICTIONS\" SINO-U.S. TRADE WOULD ALSO 
INCREASE.  YANG SAID HE WAS PLEASED THAT CHINA AND THE 
UNITED STATES NOW SHARED A MORE COMMON UNDERSTANDING ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS.  WITH EVIDENT PRIDE, YANG NOTED THAT THE 
CHINESE PRESS WAS NOW SO RELIABLE THAT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT USED FIGURES PROVIDED BY THE CHINESE MEDIA IN 
ITS HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ON CHINA.  AS FOR TAIWAN, YANG 
SAID THAT HONG KONG\'S SUCCESSFUL REVERSION TO CHINESE 
SOVEREIGNTYCOULD PERHAPS SERVE AS THE MODEL FOR 
RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. 
 
3.  (C)  ACKERMAN ASSURED YANG THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS 
NOT SIDING WITH BRITAIN AGAINST CHINA ON THE ISSUE OF 
HONG KONG.  THE UNITED STATES WAS CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE 
PEOPLE OF HONG KONG AND THEIR LEVEL OF FREEDOMS FOLLOWING 
REVERSION.  ACKERMAN AGREED THAT THE CHINESE ECONOMY WAS 
DOING WELL, AND HOPED THAT WITH FAIR MARKET ACCESS, 
SINO-U.S. TRADE WOULD GROW.  ON HUMAN RIGHTS, ACKERMAN 
SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT MFN AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS SHOULD BE LINKED, IT WAS NONETHELESS IMPORTANT 
THAT CHINA CONTINUE TO SHOW PROGRESS IN THIS AREA IF IT 
HOPED TO AVOID THE ANNUAL MFN REVIEW.  END SUMMARY. 
 
4.  (U)  ON JANUARY 28 ASSISTANT MINISTER OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS YANG JIECHI HOSTED A BREAKFAST MEETING FOR 
REPRESENTATIVE GARY ACKERMAN.  DAVID ADAMS (SPECIAL 
ASSISTANT T0 ACKERMAN), REGGIE LIU (ASSISTANT TO 
ACKERMAN), POLMINCOUNS AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER) ACCOMPANIED 
ACKERMAN.  NORTH AMERICAN AND OCEANIAN AFFAIRS DEPUTY 
DIRECTOR GENERAL LIU XIAOMING, FIRST SECRETARY XIE FENG, 
CPIFA EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER XIAO HOUDE ACCOMPANIED 
YANG. 
 
5.  (C) NOTING THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT THE CONGRESSMAN HAD 
HAD A SUCCESSFUL MEETING WITH VICE PREMIER/FOREIGN 
MINISTER QIAN QICHEN THE PREVIOUS DAY, YANG EXPRESSED THE 
HOPE THAT THE CONGRESSMAN WOULD ENCOURAGE HIS COLLEAGUES 
ON THE HILL TO VISIT CHINA IN ORDER THAT THEY TOO MIGHT 
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION IN CHINA.  ACKERMAN, 
THANKING YANG FOR HOSTING THE BREAKFAST, ASSURED YANG 
THAT HE WOULD DO S0. 
 
HONG KONG 
--------- 
 
6.  (C) ACKERMAN, NOTING THAT HE HAD JUST COME FROM HONG 
KONG, OBSERVED THAT THE HONG KONG BUSINESS COMMUNITY 
SEEMED CONFIDENT THAT THE TRANSITION WOULD PROCEED 
SMOOTHLY.  SOME OF ACKERMAN\'S CONTACTS IN HONG KONG HAD 
EXPRESSED SOME APPREHENSION, HOWEVER, BECAUSE CHINA WAS 
RESCINDING THE BILL OF RIGHTS.  NO ONE, ACKERMAN SAID, 
COULD TOLERATE FREEDOMS BEING TAKEN AWAY.  IN ADDITION 
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO APPARENT THREAT TO THE HONG KONG 
GOVERNMENT, IT APPEARED THAT CHINA HAD ARBITRARILY TAKEN 
THIS ACTION.  ACKERMAN STATED THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THE 
PEOPLE OF HONG KONG WERE PAWNS BETWEEN TWO SQUABBLING 
POWERS -- CHINA AND BRITAIN. 
 
7.  (C) VISIBLY ANNOYED, YANG COUNTERED THAT CHINA WAS 
NOT RESCINDING OR REPEALING THE BILL OF RIGHTS.  IN FACT, 
CHINA WAS ONLY TRYING TO MAKE THE BILL OF RIGHTS 
COMPATIBLE WITH THE SUPREMACY OF THE BASIC LAW.  YANG 
BLAMED THE WESTERN MEDIA FOR THE INCORRECT PERCEPTION OF 
THE ACTIONS CHINA HAD TAKEN.  YANG STATED THAT THE 
WESTERN MEDIA WERE ALWAYS CRITICAL OF CHINA\'S ACTIONS IN 
HONG KONG AND RARELY CRITICAL OF BRITAIN.  ACCORDING TO 
YANG, THE BASIC LAW ALREADY PROVIDED FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, 
INCLUDING THE FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND FREEDOM OF THE 
PRESS.  NOTING THAT BRITAIN DID NOT HAVE A BILL OF 
RIGHTS, YANG ASKED RHETORICALLY WHY HONG KONG NEEDED A 
BILL OF RIGHTS IF BRITAIN DID NOT. 
 
8.  (C) YANG MAINTAINED THAT THE BRITISH, \"BELIEVING THAT 
THEY COULD DO WHATEVER THEY LIKED,\" HAD MADE THE BILL OF 
RIGHTS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE BASIC LAW.  THIS WAS IN 
DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF THE AGREEMENT THAT CHINA AND THE 
U.K. SIGNED IN 1984.  YANG EMPHATICALLY STATED THAT CHINA 
WOULD \"NOT SWALLOW\" BRITAIN\'S ATTEMPTS TO PUT CHINA \"IN 
ITS PLACE.\"  \"THIS IS NOT THE OPIUM WAR.  WE WILL THROW 
IT BACK,\" YANG DECLARED.  YANG, WITH OBVIOUS ANGER, GAVE 
A THUMBNAIL SKETCH OF THE OPIUM WAR AND REITERATED THAT 
CHINA WOULD NOT AGAIN BE PUSHED AROUND. 
 
9.  (C) ACKERMAN ASSURED YANG THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS 
NOT TAKING SIDES WITH THE BRITISH AGAINST CHINA.  HE 
EMPHASIZED THAT HIS ONLY CONCERN WAS THAT THE PEOPLE OF 
HONG KONG SHOULD BE TREATED FAIRLY.  BEIJING SHOULD 
REASSURE THE PEOPLE OF HONG KONG THAT THEIR WAY OF LIFE 
WOULD REMAIN THE SAME FOLLOWING REVERSION. 
 
10.  (C) YANG SAID THAT CHINA HOPED TO MAINTAIN GOOD 
BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN AFTER JULY 1997.  TOWARD 
THAT END, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER HESELTINE HAD VISITED 
CHINA ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS.  RECENTLY, DEFENSE 
MINISTER CHI HAOTIAN HAD ST0PPED IN LONDON ON HIS WAY TO 
THE UNITED STATES.  IN FEBRUARY, FOREIGN MINISTER QIAN 
WOULD MEET WITH FOREIGN MINISTER RIFKIND AT THE ASEM 
MEETING IN SINGAPORE.  ONCE THE \"HIST0RICAL LEGACY\" OF 
HONG KONG WAS RESOLVED, YANG FORESAW NO REASON WHY 
SINO-U.K. RELATIONS WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. 
 
TRADE 
----- 
 
11.  (C) YANG PROVIDED A BRIEF OVERVIEW 0F CHINA\'S 
ECONOMY, POINTING OUT THAT LAST YEAR THE ECONOMY HAD 
GROWN BY 9.7%     IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, 12IN 
THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR, AND 8IN THE SERVICE SECTOR. 
CHINA\'S BILATERAL TRADE REACHED USD 300 BILLION, PLACING 
IT LLTH IN THE WORLD, YANG SAID.  PREDICTING THAT CHINA\'S 
ECONOMY WOULD CONTINUE TO EXPAND, YANG EXPRESSED THE HOPE 
THAT CHINA\'S BILATERAL TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES WOULD 
ALSO INCREASE.  FOLLOWING A DECADE OR SO OF STRUCTURED 
REFORM, MANY U.S. COMPANIES --  FOR EXAMPLE BOEING -- 
WERE IN A POSITION TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE FOR CHINA\'S 
BUSINESS.  YANG SAID THAT WITH \"FEWER RESTRICTIONS\" 
NORMAL TRADE SHOULD INCREASE. 
 
12.  (C) YANG MAINTAINED THAT THE U.S. AND CHINESE 
ECONOMIES WERE COMPLEMENTARY, IN CONTRAST TO THE U.S. AND 
JAPANESE ECONOMIES WHICH WERE COMPETITIVE.  ACCORDING TO 
YANG, MANY LARGE U.S. COMPANIES, INCLUDING BOEING AND 
AT&T, WERE DOING WELL IN CHINA.  NOTING THAT NEW YORK WAS 
AN INDUSTRIAL \"POWERHOUSE IN QUITE A FEW AREAS,\" YANG 
ENCOURAGED CONGRESSMAN ACKERMAN TO LOOK TO CHINA AS A 
PLACE TO DO BUSINESS. 
 
13.  (C) ACKERMAN RESPONDED THAT HE WAS ENCOURAGED BY 
YANG\'S REFRESHING VIEWS, ADDING THAT HE AGREED WITH 
ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT YANG HAD SAID.  WHILE HE ALSO 
WANTED T0 INCREASE BILATERAL TRADE, ACKERMAN STATED THAT 
HE WAS NONETHELESS CONCERNED ABOUT FAIR MARKET ACCESS. 
ANOTHER CONCERN WAS HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA. 
 
14.  (C) CONTINUING, ACKERMAN SAID THAT HE BELIEVED THAT 
MFN AND HUMAN RIGHTS SHOULD NOT BE LINKED.  HOWEVER, IT 
WAS IMPORTANT THAT CHINA CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS IN 
HUMAN RIGHTS IF IT HOPED TO AVOID THE ANNUAL MFN REVIEW. 
AS U.S. CONFIDENCE IN CHINA VIS-A-VIS HUMAN RIGHTS GREW, 
SINO-U.S. RELATIONS WOULD ALSO IMPROVE.  RESPONDING, YANG 
EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT PERMANENT MFN FOR CHINA WOULD NOT 
BE TOO FAR OFF. 
 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
------------ 
 
15.  (C) ON HUMAN RIGHTS, YANG SAID THAT HE WAS PLEASED 
THAT THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA NOW SHARED A MORE COMMON 
UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ISSUE.  SEVERAL YEARS BACK, THE 
UNITED STATES DEFINED HUMAN RIGHTS ONLY IN TERMS 0F CIVIL 
RIGHTS, YANG SAID.  IN CONTRAST, THE UNITED STATES NOW 
RECOGNIZED THAT THE PEOPLE\'S LEVEL 0F SUBSISTENCE AND 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WERE ALSO IMPORTANT.  YANG MADE THE 
POINT THAT MUCH OF CHINA\'S BAD IMAGE IN THE UNITED STATES 
ON THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS WAS DUE TO BIASED AMERICAN 
REPORTING.  CITING A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL, YANG SAID THAT HE AGREED WITH SEVERAL AMERICAN 
SCHOLARS QUOTED IN THE ARTICLE THAT T0O 0FTEN \"THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE STORY\" IN CHINA, THE MORE POSITIVE STORY, WAS 
NOT REPORTED. 
 
16.  (C) ACKERMAN REPLIED THAT WHILE NO GOVERNMENT OR 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL LIKED TO BE CRITICIZED, A FREE PRESS 
WAS NECESSARY TO INSURE THAT GOVERNMENTS DID NOT BECOME 
OPPRESSIVE.  THE PRESS, HE SAID, HAD AT TIMES CAUSED HIM 
SOME PAIN, BUT HE NONETHELESS BELIEVED THAT A FREE PRESS 
MUST BE ACCOMMODATED. 
 
17.  (C) YANG SAID THAT THE CHINESE PRESS WAS TRYING TO 
COMPETE WITH THE FOREIGN PRESS AS A CREDIBLE SOURCE OF 
INFORMATI0N.  T0WARD THAT END, THE CHINESE MEDIA 
REGULARLY AND TRUTHFULLY REPORTED ON ISSUES SUCH AS LOCAL 
CRIME.  WITH EVIDENT PRIDE, YANG SAID THAT \"EVEN THE U.S. 
HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT\" USED FIGURES PROVIDED BY THE CHINESE 
MEDIA WHEN REPORTING ON ISSUES SUCH AS VILLAGE ELECTIONS 
AND ABUSES OF POWER BY THE POLICE.  THE CHINESE PRESS WAS 
NOT MERELY PROPAGANDA -- \"LIKE IN THE OLD DAYS\" -- YANG 
ASSERTED. 
 
TAIWAN 
------ 
 
18.  (C) YANG MAINTAINED THAT TAIWAN PRESIDENT LEE 
TENG-HUI WOULD FAIL IN HIS EFFORTS TO SLOW TRADE BETWEEN 
THE MAINLAND AND TAIWAN.  ACCORDING T0 YANG, THE RECENTLY 
ANNOUNCED DIRECT SHIPPING ROUTES WERE ANOTHER BOOST TO 
BILATERAL TRADE.  YANG SAID THAT HONG KONG\'S SUCCESSFUL 
REVERSION TO CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY COULD PERHAPS SERVE AS 
THE MODEL FOR RESOLVING THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN. 
 
19.  (U) REPRESENTATIVE ACKERMAN DID NOT HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR THIS CABLE.

SUMMARY

1.  (C)  VFM YANG JIECHI CALLED IN THE AMBASSADOR 
NOVEMBER 12 TO PROTEST SECRETARY RICHARDSON\'S VISIT TO 
TAIWAN AND THE DALAI LAMA\'S WASHINGTON MEETINGS WITH 
PRESIDENT CLINTON AND OTHER SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS.  YANG 
DESCRIBED BOTH ACTIONS AS \"CATEGORICALLY UNACCEPTABLE\"

INTERESTS TO KEEP BILATERAL RELATIONS IN \"GOOD SHAPE.\" 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  VFM YANG JIECHI CALLED IN THE AMBASSADOR 
NOVEMBER 12 TO REGISTER PROTESTS REGARDING SECRETARY 
RICHARDSON\'S VISIT TO TAIWAN AND THE DALAI LAMA\'S 
WASHINGTON MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND OTHER SENIOR 
U.S. OFFICIALS.  (YANG ORIGINALLY ASKED TO SEE THE 
AMBASSADOR ON NOVEMBER 11, BUT A MEETING COULD NOT BE 
ARRANGED.  MFA, HOWEVER, WAS DETERMINED TO REGISTER ITS 
PROTEST THAT DAY AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL CHEN 
MINGMING DID SO THAT EVENING WITH THE ACTING DCM.) 
 
\"SERIOUS CONCERN AND STRONG RESENTMENT\" 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  YANG COMPLAINED THAT, BY SENDING SECRETARY 
RICHARDSON TO TAIWAN AND ALLOWING THE DALAI LAMA TO VISIT 
THE UNITED STATES, THE U.S. HAD DISREGARDED CHINA\'S 
OPPOSITION AND REPRESENTATIONS (REFTEL).  YANG EXPRESSED 
CHINA\'S \"SERIOUS CONCERN AND STRONG RESENTMENT AT THESE 
WRONG ACTIONS.\"  HE ADDED THAT HE HAD BEEN \"INSTRUCTED TO 
MAKE A PROTEST\" WHICH HE HOPED THE AMBASSADOR WOULD 
REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO WASHINGTON. 
 
TAIWAN:  VIOLATION OF THREE COMMUNIQUES 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  ON TAIWAN, YANG RESTATED CHINA\'S OPPOSITION TO 
ANY OFFICIAL CONTACT OR DEVELOPMENT OF OFFICIAL RELATIONS 
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND TAIWAN, ESPECIALLY CABINET- 
LEVEL VISITS.  YANG \"DEMANDED\" THAT THE UNITED STATES 
LIMIT ITS RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN TO UNOFFICIAL TIES.  YANG 
PROTESTED SECRETARY RICHARDSON\'S VISIT, HIS MEETINGS WITH 
LEE TENG-HUI AND OTHER SENIOR TAIWAN OFFICIALS, AND 
RICHARDSON\'S \"OUTRAGEOUS REMARKS ON MANY OCCASIONS.\" 
THIS WAS A VIOLATION OF THE THREE COMMUNIQUES AND THE 
U.S. COMMITMENT NOT TO HAVE OFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH 
TAIWAN. 
 
TIBET:  SUPPORT FOR SEPARATISM 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  ON TIBET, YANG DESCRIBED THE DALAI LAMA AS A 
\"POLITICAL EXILE ENGAGED IN SPLITTISM WHO ADVOCATED 
TIBETAN INDEPENDENCE.\"  YANG SAID THE DALAI LAMA WAS 
USING THE PROSPECT OF CONTACTS AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
BEIJING TO CARRY OUT \"PROPAGANDA\" AND TO DISGUISE HIS 
\"DECEPTIVE TRICKS.\"  ACCORDING TO YANG, THE U.S. 
WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THE DALAI LAMA\'S VISIT AND TO 
ARRANGE MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT AND 
SECRETARY OF STATE, AMOUNTED TO \"FLAGRANT CONNIVANCE AND 
SUPPORT FOR THE DALAI LAMA\'S SPLITTIST ACTIVITIES.\"  THIS 
WAS A VIOLATION OF U.S. STATEMENTS THAT IT RECOGNIZED 
TIBET AS PART OF CHINA AND DID NOT SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE 
FOR TIBET, YANG ALLEGED. 
 
YANG SAYS U.S. SHOULD \"CORRECT ITS MISTAKES\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  SUMMING UP, YANG SAID THAT THE U.S. ACTIONS 
CONTRAVENED INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF NON-INTERFERENCE 
IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS, MUTUAL RESPECT FOR TERRITORIAL 
SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY, AND \"HURT THE FEELINGS\" OF THE 
CHINESE PEOPLE.  HE VOICED \"STRONG OPPOSITION\" TO THE 
\"CATEGORICALLY UNACCEPTABLE\" U.S. ACTIONS.  YANG SAID 
THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT INTERFERE IN OR 
ENTRENCH UPON CHINA\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS.  HE \"DEMANDED\" 
THAT THE UNITED STATES ABIDE STRICTLY BY THE THREE 
COMMUNIQUES AND THE BASIC PRINCIPLES GOVERNING 
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  YANG CLOSED BY CALLING ON THE 
UNITED STATES TO \"CORRECT ITS MISTAKES\" AND FURTHER 
IMPROVE U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS WITH CONCRETE ACTIONS. 
ADDING A \"PERSONAL THOUGHT,\" HE STRESSED THE SENSITIVITY 
OF TAIWAN AND TIBET TO BEIJING AND CAUTIONED US AGAINST 
MAKING \"WRONG CALCULATIONS\" AND NOT \"REPEAT PAST 
MISTAKES.\"  IT WAS IN OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS, YANG SAID, TO 
KEEP THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP IN \"GOOD SHAPE.\" 
 
7.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR ASSURED VFM YANG THAT CHINA\'S 
VIEWS WOULD PROMPTLY BE REPORTED TO WASHINGTON. 
 
8.  (C)  VFM YANG TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF A SUBSEQUENT 
MEETING NOVEMBER 12 WITH U/S HOLUM (SEPTEL) TO SIMILARLY 
PROTEST THE DALAI LAMA AND RICHARDSON VISITS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C)  AS WAS THE CASE WHEN WE RECEIVED OUR LAST 
PROTEST FROM YANG ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO (REFTEL), HIS 
PRESENTATION TODAY WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND FREE OF 
EMOTION.  THE MEETING HAD THE ADDED VIRTUE OF BREVITY, AS 
YANG WENT THROUGH HIS POINTS IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES. 
THIS IS NOT TO DOWNPLAY, HOWEVER, BEIJING\'S UNHAPPINESS 
WITH THESE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS.  MFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
GENERAL CHEN MINGMING TOLD ACTING DCM NOVEMBER 11 THAT 
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION HAD BEEN GIVEN TO CANCELING U/S 
HOLUM\'S ON-GOING BEIJING TALKS TO DEMONSTRATE BEIJING\'S 
DISPLEASURE.  ACCORDING TO CHEN, THIS OPTION WAS REJECTED 
AS THE AMERICAN AFFAIRS DIVISION CONVINCINGLY ARGUED THAT 
STOPPING THE TALKS WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

REFS:  A) BEIJING 6941, B) FBIS OW2207035699, 
 
(U)  CLASSIFIED BY JAMES F. MORIARTY, ACTING DEPUTY CHIEF 
OF MISSION.  REASON:  1.5(D). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  IMPLEMENTING A DECISION OF THE POLITBURO STANDING 
COMMITTEE, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ON JULY 22 OFFICIALLY 
ANNOUNCED A BAN ON THE FALUN GONG SECT, DECLARING IT AN 
\"ILLEGAL\" ORGANIZATION.  THOUSANDS OF SECT MEMBERS TOOK 
TO BEIJING\'S STREETS IN DEMONSTRATIONS THAT WERE 
NOTEWORTHY FOR THE GENERAL RESTRAINT AMONG PROTESTERS AND 
POLICE ALIKE.  FEW PRACTITIONERS OFFERED RESISTANCE AS 
POLICE CORRALLED AND LOADED THEM ONTO BUSES.  MANY 
REPORTEDLY ARE BEING HELD IN STADIUMS IN WESTERN BEIJING, 
ALTHOUGH FOR NOW WE BELIEVE THESE ARE TEMPORARY HOLDING 
SITES, FROM WHICH PROTESTERS WILL SOON BE SENT HOME.  THE 
REGIME\'S STRATEGY APPEARS TO BE TO SEEK TO NEUTRALIZE THE 
FALUN GONG BY DECAPITATING ITS CORE LEADERSHIP, WHILE 
REFRAINING FROM REPRESSION OF ORDINARY MEMBERS.  ALTHOUGH 
BEIJING CLEARLY HOPES THAT THE CULT WILL DISAPPEAR 
WITHOUT RESISTANCE, IT MAY HAVE TO RECONSIDER THIS 
STRATEGY IF PRACTITIONERS CONTINUE TO TAKE TO THE STREETS 
AND GATHER IN PARKS FOR DAILY EXERCISES.  END SUMMARY. 

FALUN GONG OFFICIALLY ILLEGAL 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C)  DURING A NATIONAL BROADCAST AT 3:00 P.M. ON JULY 
22, CHINA CENTRAL TELEVISION (CCTV) ANNOUNCED AN OFFICIAL 
BAN ON THE FALUN GONG MOVEMENT.  CCTV READ A CIRCULAR 
ISSUED BY THE MINISTRIES OF CIVIL AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC 
SECURITY WHICH DECLARED THAT FALUN GONG WAS AN \"ILLEGAL\" 
ORGANIZATION AND BANNED FURTHER PUBLIC GATHERINGS. 
CHINESE MEDIA REPORTEDLY PLAN TO REPEAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT 
REGULARLY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  AN MFA SPOKESWOMAN 
ALSO ANNOUNCED THE BAN DURING THE MINISTRY\'S REGULAR 
PRESS BRIEFING THIS AFTERNOON. 
 
POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE DECISION 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C)  ACCORDING TO A WELL-CONNECTED SOURCE, THE 
POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE APPROVED THE SUPPRESSION OF 
FALUN GONG DURING A JULY 19 MEETING.  AS REPORTED REF A, 
SECURITY FORCES ARRESTED DOZENS OF SECT LEADERS 
NATIONWIDE THE NEXT DAY.  AS OF JULY 21, GOVERNMENT AND 
PARTY OFFICIALS HAD BEGUN TO ATTEND MANDATORY SESSIONS TO 
STUDY AN AUTHORITATIVE STATEMENT ON THE FALUN GONG 
DELIVERED BY STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBER HU JINTAO ON JULY 
19.  HU REPORTEDLY ASSERTED THAT THERE WERE 2.1 MILLION 
FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS, OF WHOM ONE-THIRD WERE PARTY 
MEMBERS.  THE OFFICIAL GUIDANCE INSTRUCTED PARTY MEMBERS 
WHO PRACTICED FALUN GONG EITHER TO HALT THEIR INVOLVEMENT 
IN THE SECT OR RESIGN FROM THE PARTY.  THOSE WHO FAILED 
TO COMPLY WOULD BE EXPELLED FROM THE PARTY. 
 
JIANG \"PREOCUPPIED\" BY FALUN GONG 
--------------------------------- 
 
4 (C)  IN HIS STATEMENT, HU JINTAO REPORTEDLY CITED KEY 
REMARKS ON THE FALUN GONG BY PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY 
JIANG ZEMIN.  ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE, JIANG ASSERTED 
THAT HE HAD RECENTLY BEEN \"PREOCCUPIED\" WITH THE PROBLEM 
OF FALUN GONG BECAUSE ITS FOUNDER, LI HONGZHI, WAS A 
\"SWINDLER OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.\"  THE PARTY GENERAL 
SECRETARY REPORTEDLY ACCUSED LI HONGZHI OF EXPLOITING 
\"DECEITFUL TRICKS AND HERESY TO CONFUSE PEOPLE AND TALK 
NONSENSE.\"  \"SOME\" PRACTITIONERS, JIANG CLAIMED, 
\"OBSTINATELY STUCK TO THE WRONG COURSE,\" AND FALUN GONG 
WAS AN \"IMMENSELY HARMFUL\" (WEIHAI JIDA) GROUP. 
 
FOCUSING ON THE LEADERSHIP 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C)  MEDIA REPORTS SUGGESTED THAT THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT HAD DETAINED THOUSANDS ACROSS CHINA ON JULY 21 
AND 22, AS PRACTITIONERS TOOK TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST 
THEIR LEADERS\' ARRESTS.  AFP ANNOUNCED THAT LARGE 
DETENTION CENTERS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN STADIUMS IN 
WESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN BEIJING (REF B).  OUR WELL- 
CONNECTED CONTACT PREDICTED THAT THE AUTHORITIES WOULD 
RELEASE THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THESE PERSONS. 
CITING A TRADITIONAL CHINESE SAYING THAT A MASS OF 
DRAGONS WAS EASILY COWED WHEN IT HAD NO LEADERS (QUN LONG 
WU SHOU), HE ASSERTED THAT BEIJING BELIEVED THE SECT 
COULD EASILY BE CONTROLLED ONCE ITS CORE LEADERSHIP WAS 
NEUTRALIZED.  HU JINTAO, HE NOTED, HAD DECLARED THAT THE 
PARTY INTENDED TO STRIKE HARD AGAINST \"A VERY SMALL 
NUMBER\" OF PRACTITIONERS. 
 
FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS:  BUSINESS AS USUAL 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C)  DESPITE THE CRACKDOWN, HUNDREDS OF FALUN GONG 
MEMBERS AGAIN GATHERED IN MAJOR CITY PARKS THIS MORNING 
TO CONDUCT THEIR DAILY PROGRAM.  POLOFFS OBSERVED GROUPS 
NUMBERING AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED IN THE TEMPLE OF 
EARTH, TEMPLE OF HEAVEN, AND PURPLE BAMBOO GARDEN PARKS 
(IN NORTHERN, WESTERN, AND SOUTHERN BEIJING, 
RESPECTIVELY).  AS USUAL, PRACTITIONERS OF OTHER SCHOOLS 
OF QIGONG REMAINED DISTINCTLY SEPARATE FROM THE FALUN 
GONG AND EACH OTHER.  IN THE TEMPLE OF EARTH PARK, POLOFF 
WATCHED AS PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY PERSONNEL OBSERVED AND 
VIDEOTAPED FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS.  APPARENTLY 
UNCONCERNED ABOUT THIS OFFICIAL ATTENTION, THE SECT 
MEMBERS WORKED THROUGH TO THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR PROGRAM 
AND SOCIALIZED BRIEFLY BEFORE QUIETLY BREAKING UP. 
 
PROTESTS NEAR ZHONGNANHAI CONTINUED 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (C)  THE AUTHORITIES WERE, NONETHELESS, WELL-PREPARED 
TO DEAL WITH CONTINUED PROTESTS.  AT ABOUT 8:00 A.M., 
POLOFF OBSERVED A CROWD OF APPROXIMATELY 500 
PRACTITIONERS GATHERED ON XI\'ANMEN STREET NEAR THE 
NORTHWESTERN CORNER OF THE ZHONGNANHAI LEADERSHIP 
COMPOUND.  ITS MEMBERS WERE PACKED SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER 
ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE DEEP ON THE SIDEWALK, WITH THEIR BACKS 
TO THE SHOPS ALONG THE STREET.  ABOUT 200 UNIFORMED 
POLICE OFFICERS SURROUNDED THEM ON THE OTHER THREE SIDES. 
OBSERVING THIS STAND-OFF FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, POLOFF 
WITNESSED NO VIOLENCE FROM EITHER SIDE.  THE 
PRACTITIONERS REMAINED LARGELY SILENT, WHILE THE POLICE 
OFFICERS MOSTLY CHATTED AMONG THEMSELVES.  THE POLICE 
PERMITTED REGULAR PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE TRAFFIC TO PASS 
THE AREA UNHINDERED. 
 
FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS ALLOWED TO COME AND GO 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
8. (C)  THE ATMOSPHERE AT THIS SITE WAS COMPARATIVELY 
RELAXED.  IN FACT, POLICE OFFICERS PERMITTED ABOUT A 
DOZEN PRACTITIONERS TO CROSS THE SECURITY PERIMETER AND 
LEAVE THE SCENE AND ANOTHER DOZEN OR SO TO JOIN THE 
CROWD.  POLOFF OBSERVED PRACTITIONERS ENGAGING IN BANTER 
AND EVEN EXTENDED CONVERSATIONS WITH POLICE OFFICERS. 
 
FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS CHEERED AS BUSED AWAY 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
9. (C)  TWO LARGE ARTICULATED BUSES ARRIVED AT THE SCENE 
AT ABOUT 8:15 A.M., AND POLICE OFFICERS PROMPTLY BEGAN 
LOADING THE CROWD ONTO THEM.  FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS 
APPARENTLY BOARDED VOLUNTARILY.  WHEN THE FULLY-LOADED 
BUSES PULLED OUT, THEIR PASSENGERS AND SECT MEMBERS 
REMAINING ON THE STREET CHEERED AND APPLAUDED.  THIS 
SCENE REPEATED ITSELF APPROXIMATELY EVERY 15 MINUTES, 
UNTIL BUSES HAD CARRIED AWAY THE REMAINDER OF THE CROWD. 
 
PROTESTERS FROM THE NORTHEAST, GOING BACK 
----------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) DURING A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF, A POLICE 
OFFICER ON BREAK SAID HE HAD BEEN AT THE SCENE SINCE 
ABOUT 6:00 A.M.  AT ITS PEAK, THE OFFICER STATED, THE 
CROWD HAD TOTALED APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND 
PRACTITIONERS.  MOST, HE STATED, WERE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE 
BEIJING MUNICIPAL REGION. (AN ELDERLY RESTAURANT WORKER 
SEPARATELY TOLD POLOFF THAT THE PROTESTERS WERE FROM 
NORTHEASTERN CHINA).  ASKED WHERE THE BUSES WERE CARRYING 
THE PRACTITIONERS, THE PSB OFFICER SAID MERELY THAT THE 
PROTESTERS WOULD BE SENT BACK TO WHERE THEY HAD COME 
FROM. 
 
ONE INCIDENT OF STRONG-ARM TACTICS 
---------------------------------- 
 
11. (C)  POLOFFS OBSERVED ONLY ONE ACT OF POLICE VIOLENCE 
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY.  AT A POLICE STATION NEAR 
ZHONGNANHAI, OFFICERS REPEATEDLY STRUCK A 60-YEAR OLD MAN 
ON HIS BACK WITH A NIGHT STICK WHEN HE REFUSED TO BOARD A 
BUS.  THE MAN QUICKLY GAVE IN AND JOINED HIS FELLOW 
PROTESTERS ON THE VEHICLE. 
 
SCENE REPEATED THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
--------------------------------- 
 
12. (C)  WE BELIEVE THAT PROTESTS OCCURRED THROUGHOUT 
BEIJING DURING THE COURSE OF JULY 22.  A WESTERN NEWS 
MAGAZINE\'S BUREAU CHIEF TOLD US THAT SHE HAD OBSERVED 
POLICE DETAIN AND BUS AWAY A CROWD THAT INITIALLY 
NUMBERED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE.  DRIVING THROUGH 
DOWNTOWN BEIJING IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON, POLOFF COUNTED 
DOZENS OF EMPTY BUSES PARKED ALONG CHANG\'AN BOULEVARD -- 
THE MAIN EAST-WEST ARTERY -- IN DOWNTOWN BEIJING.  THE 
POLICE HAD SET UP TEMPORARY POSTS AT INTERSECTIONS, AND 
POLOFF OBSERVED OFFICERS STOPPING PEDESTRIANS AND 
INSPECTING THEIR IDENTIFICATION CARDS.  ACROSS THE STREET 
FROM THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO ZHONGNANHAI, POLOFF WATCHED AS 
POLICE LOADED APPROXIMATELY EIGHT CITIZENS INTO A POLICE 
VAN.  TWO OF THE EIGHT BRIEFLY ARGUED WITH THE POLICE, 
BUT NONE OFFERED ANY PHYSICAL RESISTANCE AND ALL QUICKLY 
BOARDED THE VEHICLE. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (C)  THE CRACKDOWN ON FALUN GONG IN BEIJING TODAY 
APPEARED TO BE REACTIVE, AS AUTHORITIES DETAINED 
PRACTITIONERS WHO TOOK TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST THE JULY 
20 ARRESTS.  ALTHOUGH WE DOUBT THAT THE INCIDENT CITED IN 
PARA 11 WAS THE SOLE OCCASION WHEN POLICE EMPLOYED 
VIOLENCE, BOTH THE FALUN GONG AND THE POLICE DISPLAYED 
NOTEWORTHY RESTRAINT IN WHAT WAS CLEARLY A POTENTIALLY 
UNSTABLE SITUATION.  FOR NOW, WE ARE INCLINED TO ACCEPT 
OUR CONTACT\'S ASSERTION THAT THE AUTHORITIES WILL SOON 
RELEASE THE MANY RANK-AND-FILE FALUN GONG MEMBERS 
DETAINED SO FAR DURING THE PROTESTS.  THE SITUATION 
NONETHELESS WILL REMAIN FLUID FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN, FOR INSTANCE, IF FALUN GONG 
PRACTITIONERS -- HOWEVER ORDERLY -- REFUSE TO RETURN HOME 
AND ABANDON THEIR PROTESTS?  NOW THAT FALUN GONG 
ACTIVITIES ARE BANNED, HOW WILL THE REGIME DEAL WITH CULT 
MEMBERS WHO OPENLY GATHER IN PARKS TO CONDUCT DAILY 
EXERCISES?  BEIJING SURELY HOPES THAT THE SECT WILL GO 
QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT, BUT THIS ALMOST CERTAINLY IS 
WISHFUL THINKING.  ZHONGNANHAI MAY SOON DECIDE IT HAS NO 
CHOICE BUT TO ABANDON ITS COMPARATIVE RESTRAINT IN FAVOR 
OF A TOUGHER APPROACH.

SUBJECT: CHINA:  2000 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 217248 
 
1.  BELOW IS THE 2000 TERRORISM REPORT FOR CHINA. 
RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO REFTEL PARAGRAPH THREE 
REQUIREMENTS. 
 
2.  A)  THERE WERE NO ACTS OF TERRORISM COMMITTED 
AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS IN CHINA THIS YEAR. 
CHINESE MAINLAND AND HONG KONG MEDIA OCCASIONALLY REPORT 
ACTS OF TERRORISM BY INDEPENDENCE ACTIVISTS IN CHINA\'S 
WESTERN PROVINCE OF XINJIANG AND, LESS FREQUENTLY, IN 
THE TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGION.  PUBLICLY, THE PRC TENDS TO 
DOWNPLAY THESE INCIDENTS AS THE ISOLATED ACTIONS OF A 
NEGLIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, OR ATTRIBUTES THEM TO 
AMORPHOUS \"FOREIGN FORCES BENT ON UNDERMINING CHINA.\" 
PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE JUDICIAL RESPONSE TO 
THESE TERRORISTS IS HARSH, RANGING FROM LENGTHY PRISON 
SENTENCES TO EXECUTION. 
 
B,C)  THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY IN FORCE BETWEEN 
THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA.  IN JUNE, 2000, THE U.S. 
AND PRC SIGNED A MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT THAT 
WOULD ALLOW FOR ENHANCED COOPERATION IN THE APPREHENSION 
AND PROSECUTION OF CRIMINALS; CHINA, HOWEVER, HAS NOT 
TAKEN THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PUT THE AGREEMENT INTO 
FORCE. 
 
IN AUGUST, CHINA SUCCESSFULLY OBTAINED FROM KAZAKHSTAN 
THE EXTRADITION OF TWO ETHNIC UIGHUR SEPARATISTS WHO 
WERE CHARGED WITH ILLEGAL TRANSPORTATION OF WEAPONS. 
 
D)  THE PRC GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS, AND HAS 
REPEATEDLY VOICED ITS OPPOSITION TO TERRORISM IN PUBLIC 
FORA.  WHEN ASKED, GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN CONSISTENTLY 
VOICE CONCERN ABOUT, OR OPPOSITION TO, ACTS OF TERRORISM 
IN OTHER COUNTRIES. 
 
E)  ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND SEVERAL CENTRAL ASIAN 
COUNTRIES, CHINA IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE 
SHANGHAI FORUM, WHICH ATTEMPTS TO PROMOTE 
COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION IN CENTRAL ASIA.  CHINA 
ALSO DISCUSSES COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION IN BILATERAL 
DIPLOMATIC DISCUSSIONS. 
 
F)  ALTHOUGH CHINA DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORISM, 
TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS, IT DOES MAINTAIN 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ALL THOSE COUNTRIES DESIGNATED 
BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE AS STATE SPONSORS OF 
TERRORISM. 
 
G)  CHINA HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT 
OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. 
 
H)  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1999 IN 
CHINA\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM. 
 
I)  THE UNITED STATES HAS NO COUNTERTERRORISM 
INITIATIVES WITH CHINA.

REF: (A)STATE 176853, (B)BEIJING 10287 
 
(U)  CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JON 
ALOISI.  REASONS 1.5 (B), (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) AN MFA OFFICIAL ON OCTOBER 12 REPORTED THAT 
CHINA\'S POSITION ON THE FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN WAS 
SIMILAR TO OURS, AS DESCRIBED IN REF A DEMARCHE. 
BEIJING BELIEVED THE NEXT GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN 
SHOULD BE BROADLY BASED, REPRESENT ALL ETHNIC GROUPS, 
PURSUE FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH ALL OTHER COUNTRIES, AND, 
OF COURSE, OPPOSE TERRORISM.  THE OFFICIAL ALSO STRESSED 
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN 
DETERMINING AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  EMBOFFS MET OCTOBER 12 WITH LI JUNHUA, DIRECTOR 
OF THE MFA INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION DEPARTMENT\'S 
POLITICAL DIVISION, TO DISCUSS REFTEL DEMARCHE ON 
AFGHANISTAN\'S POLITICAL FUTURE.  WE LEFT THE TALKING 
POINTS BEHIND AS A NONPAPER. 
 
-------------------------------- 
CHINA\'S POSITION SIMILAR TO OURS 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  AFTER LISTENING TO OUR PRESENTATION, LI 
RESPONDED THAT CHINA SHARED MOST OF OUR VIEWS.  BEIJING 
BELIEVED THE NEXT AFGHAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE BROADLY 
BASED, INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL ETHNIC GROUPS, AND 
BE FRIENDLY TO ALL COUNTRIES.  LI REPEATED THE LAST 
POINT, EMPHASIZING THAT AFGHANISTAN SHOULD NOT BE 
HOSTILE TO ANY OTHER COUNTRY.  FINALLY, OF COURSE, IT 
SHOULD OPPOSE TERRORISM. 
 
-------------------- 
IMPORTANT ROLE OF UN 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  LI CONTINUED THAT CHINA ATTACHED GREAT 
IMPORTANCE TO THE ROLE OF THE UN IN DETERMINING 
AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE.  THE PRC WELCOMED THE APPOINTMENT 
OF LAKHDAR BRAHIMI AS THE SECRETARY GENERAL\'S SPECIAL 
ENVOY TO AFGHANISTAN.  CHINA WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH 
BRAHIMI AND HOPED THAT THE UN, PARTICULARLY THE 
SECRETARY GENERAL HIMSELF, WOULD TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE 
IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
5.  (C)  \"LAST BUT NOT LEAST,\" SAID LI, THE NEXT AFGHAN 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE AFGHAN PEOPLE. 
IT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
TO CREATE A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE AFGHAN PEOPLE 
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.  CHINA WAS READY TO WORK WITH THE 
U.S., PAKISTAN, IRAN, AND OTHERS TO WORK OUT A SOLUTION 
TO THE AFGHANISTAN ISSUE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  LI\'S REMARKS AND VFM WANG YI\'S EARLIER COMMENTS 
ON THE SAME SUBJECT TO A/S KELLY (REF B) REFLECT AN 
INITIAL CONSENSUS WITHIN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ON THE 
FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN.  WE KNOW FROM OTHER SOURCES THAT 
THE PRC HAS BEEN WORKING OVERTIME TO FORMULATE A 
POSITION ON THE ISSUE (ONE SOUTH ASIA SCHOLAR SAID HE 
HAD BEEN ATTENDING MEETINGS WITH THE MFA EVERY DAY). 
BEIJING\'S FIRST PRIORITY IS A STABLE AFGHANISTAN, WHICH 
THE PRC WILL DEFINE AS ONE THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO 
PAKISTAN, ABLE TO MAINTAIN STABILITY ON THE CHINESE- 
AFGHAN BORDER, AND DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO SEPARATISM IN 
CHINA\'S WEST.  THE PRC WILL ALSO BE ALERT TO ANY HINT 
THAT THE U.S. MIGHT EXPLOIT THE CURRENT CRISIS TO 
UNDERMINE CHINESE INFLUENCE IN CENTRAL ASIA.

1.  BELOW IS THE 2001 TERRORISM REPORT FOR CHINA. 
RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO REFTEL PARAGRAPH TWO 
REQUIREMENTS. 
 
2.  A)  CHINA STRONGLY AND PROMPTLY CONDEMNED THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, WHICH PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN 
DESCRIBED ON SEPTEMBER 12 AS AN ATTACK BOTH ON THE 
UNITED STATES AND ON WORLD PEACE.  IT PROVIDED STRONG 
SUPPORT FOR THE PASSAGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1368 
AND 1373.  AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF U.S. MILITARY 
ACTION IN AFGHANISTAN, THE MFA STATED THAT CHINA 
SUPPORTED ACTION THAT STRIKES AT TERRORISM, WHILE NOTING 
THAT RELATED MILITARY ACTIVITY SHOULD BE DIRECTED AT 
SPECIFIC TARGETS AND AVOID HURTING INNOCENT CIVILIANS. 
CHINA ALSO TOOK STEPS TO TIGHTEN CONTROL OF ITS BORDERS, 
ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN.  AS HOST 
OF THE 2001 ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION FORUM, 
CHINA JOINED IN THE APEC LEADERS\' STATEMENT ON 
COUNTERTERRORISM, WHICH CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, 
PLEDGED TO FULLY IMPLEMENT UNSCRS 1368 AND 1373, AND 
CALLED FOR THE EARLY RATIFICATION OF THE UNIVERSAL ANTI- 
TERRORIST CONVENTIONS.  AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, THE PRC 
AGREED TO UNDERTAKE REGULAR COUNTERTERRORISM 
CONSULTATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES TO DISCUSS WAYS TO 
IMPROVE BILATERAL COOPERATION AGAINST TERRORISM.  TWO 
ROUNDS HAVE BEEN HELD THUS FAR.

C)  THERE WERE NO ACTS OF TERRORISM COMMITTED IN CHINA 
THIS YEAR AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.  ALTHOUGH 
THERE WERE A FEW REPORTS OF BOMBINGS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF 
CHINA DURING THE YEAR, THESE APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN 
CRIMINAL ACTS, RATHER THAN POLITICAL TERRORISM. 
 
D,E)  EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ANY EXTRADITIONS OR REQUESTS 
FOR EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS TO OR FROM CHINA IN 2001. 
THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY IN FORCE BETWEEN THE U.S. 
AND CHINA.  ON MARCH 8, A MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA ENTERED INTO FORCE. 
THE MLAA WILL ALLOW FOR ENHANCED COOPERATION IN THE 
APPREHENSION AND PROSECUTION OF CRIMINALS, INCLUDING 
TERRORISTS. 
 
F)  AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, CHINA SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED 
INFORMATION SHARING IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, INCLUDING 
THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT CHANNELS, CONCERNING PERSONS 
POSSIBLY RELATED TO TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. 
 
G)  CHINA HAS REPEATEDLY EXPRESSED IN INTERNATIONAL FORA 
ITS OPPOSITION TO TERRORISM.  IN ADDITION TO THE PRC\'S 
REACTION TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, CHINESE 
OFFICIALS CONSISTENTLY EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO ACTS OF 
TERRORISM IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND 
OTHER CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES, CHINA IS A MEMBER OF THE 
SHANGHAI COOPERATION ORGANIZATION, WHOSE STATED 
OBJECTIVES INCLUDE COMBATING TERRORISM.  CHINA ALSO 
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ITS DISCUSSIONS OF 
COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES IN ITS BILATERAL DIPLOMATIC 
DISCUSSIONS WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER NATIONS. 
 
H)  CHINA DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORISM, TERRORISTS OR 
TERRORIST GROUPS, BUT IT DOES MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS WITH ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES DESIGNATED BY THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. 
 
I)  CHINA HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENT IN SUPPORT 
OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. 
 
J)  CHINA BEGAN PLACING A HIGHER PRIORITY ON 
COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS EVEN PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 11. 
THIS WAS PROBABLY THE RESULT OF UNEASE ABOUT THE 
SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN, CENTRAL ASIA, AND NEARBY 
AREAS, INCLUDING NORTHWEST CHINA, AND OVER CONCERNS 
ABOUT POSSIBLE TERRORIST THREATS TO THE 2001 APEC FORUM 
IN SHANGHAI AND THE BEIJING OLYMPICS IN 2008.  AFTER THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, THE PROMINENCE AND INTENSITY OF 
CHINA\'S COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. 
 
K)  AS DISCUSSED IN SECTION A ABOVE, THE U.S. AND CHINA 
HAVE HELD TWO ROUNDS OF COUNTERTERRORISM CONSULTATIONS 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, AND ARE COOPERATING TO SHARE 
INFORMATION AND FURTHER COUNTERTERRORISM WORK IN THE 
UNITED NATIONS.  CHINA HAS ALSO PLEDGED TO FULLY 
IMPLEMENT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF UNSCR 1373, INCLUDING 
THE FREEZING OF TERRORISTS\' ASSETS.  ON DECEMBER 6, THE 
MFA ANNOUNCED THAT A \"SERIOUS INVESTIGATION\" HAD 
DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO ASSETS LINKED TO 
TERRORISTS IN CHINA. 
 
L)  N/A 
 
M)  AT U.S. REQUEST, CHINESE AUTHORITIES CLOSED 
SIDEWALKS AND STREETS AROUND U.S. GOVERNMENT FACILITIES 
IN CHINA AFTER SEPTEMBER 11.  CHINESE AUTHORITIES ALSO 
PLEDGED TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY TO SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR 
ACTIONS, AND DID SO ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) MOST CHINESE HAVE LITTLE IDEA OF HEIR-APPARENT 
HU JINTAO\'S PERSONAL VIEWS, BUT INSIDERS DESCRIBE HU AS 
A TALENTED BUREAUCRATIC PLAYER WITH SOLID CREDENTIALS TO 
SUCCEED JIANG ZEMIN.  THEY REPORT THAT HU HAS STAKED OUT 
A MULTI-FACETED AND SUBSTANTIVE POLICY ROLE IN IMPORTANT 
AREAS OF PARTY AND GOVERNMENT WORK.  A MASTER AT 
NETWORKING, HU MAINTAINS PERSONAL TIES THAT HAVE ALREADY 
HELPED HIM STAVE OFF THREATS TO HIS ADVANCEMENT, WHILE 
EARNING \"CHITS\" FROM JIANG ZEMIN THAT WILL HELP ENSURE 
JIANG DOES NOT ACT AGAINST HIS INTERESTS IN THE 
COMING MONTHS.  CHINESE POINT TO HU\'S CLOSE ASSOCIATION 
WITH HU YAOBANG, AND HIS CURRENT ROLE IN ENLIVENING THE 
CENTRAL PARTY SCHOOL, AS EVIDENCE THAT HU MAY WELL 
PURSUE A REFORMIST AGENDA AFTER TAKING THE REINS OF 
PARTY AND STATE OVER THE NEXT 15 MONTHS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
HU TAKES ON A HUMAN FACE 
------------------------ 
 
2.  (U) HU JINTAO HAS LONG BEEN THE LEAST VISIBLE MEMBER 
OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S 
POLITBURO.  MOST OBSERVERS EXPLAIN THIS AS A CALCULATED 
RESULT OF BUREAUCRATIC CAUTION.  AS DENG\'S SELECTION AS 
THE \"FOURTH-GENERATION\" SUCCESSOR, HE IS A NATURAL 
TARGET FOR THE JEALOUS AND AMBITIOUS.  WITH HIS OCTOBER 
28-NOVEMBER 12 VISIT TO RUSSIA, BRITAIN, FRANCE, SPAIN 
AND GERMANY (REF A), HOWEVER, HU MADE HIS MOST PROLONGED 
AND PUBLIC APPEARANCE TO DATE -- AND MADE OFFICIAL THE 
UNDERSTANDING THAT HE IS DESTINED TO BECOME THE \"CORE\" 
OF CHINA\'S FOURTH-GENERATION LEADERSHIP. 
 
3.  (C) CHINESE SOURCES AND OUR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS 
ALIKE AGREE THAT THE \"MYSTERIOUS\" HU IS, IN FACT, AN 
APPROACHABLE, LIKEABLE LEADER WITHOUT PRETENSIONS WHO 
TALKS AS EASILY WITH STAFFERS AS HE DOES WITH THEIR 
BOSSES.  ACCORDING TO BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH DIPLOMATS, 
HU WAS CONSTANTLY ENGAGED THROUGHOUT HIS TRIP, ASKING 
THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES.  HE 
REPORTEDLY DISPLAYED A REMARKABLE MEMORY THAT ALLOWED 
HIM TO MAKE ALL HIS SPEECHES WITHOUT CUE CARDS. 
EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS ALSO NOTED HIS ANALYTICAL ABILITY AND 
COMMAND OF DETAIL, PARTICULARLY ON ECONOMIC MATTERS.  ON 
A MORE PERSONAL LEVEL, THE BRITISH FLATLY DENIED REPORTS 
THAT HU COULD SPEAK ENGLISH, ALTHOUGH HE APPARENTLY HAS 
A LIMITED ENGLISH READING CAPABILITY. 
 
HU\'S RELATIONS WITH JIANG 
------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) MOST CHINESE CONTACTS AGREE THAT JIANG ACCEPTS 
HU AS HIS SUCCESSOR, DESPITE OCCASIONAL FOREIGN MEDIA 
REPORTS TO THE CONTRARY.  SOURCES HAVE POINTED OUT THAT, 
SINCE 1992, JIANG HAS GRADUALLY GIVEN HU INCREASING 
RESPONSIBILITY IN ORDER TO PREPARE HIM TO ASSUME JIANG\'S 
POSITIONS.  HU WAS IN SUCCESSION MADE CENTRAL PARTY 
SCHOOL PRESIDENT (1993), HEAD OF THE CENTRAL LEADING 
GROUP FOR PARTY-BUILDING WORK (1994), STATE VICE 
PRESIDENT (1998), AND VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE CCP\'S CENTRAL 
MILITARY COMMISSION (1999).  HE HAS ALSO BEEN GIVEN 
POLICY LEADERSHIP OVER ISSUES AS DIVERSE AS THE 
MILITARY\'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, PLANNING 
FOR THE 16TH PARTY CONGRESS AND, MOST RECENTLY 
(ACCORDING TO WHAT HU TOLD BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 
BLAIR), AFGHANISTAN.  IN ADDITION, HU HAS HELD IMPORTANT 
POSITIONS IN PROVINCIAL CAPITALS.  IN SUM, JIANG HAS 
ENSURED THAT HU HAS THE BROADEST BASE OF EXPERIENCE OF 
ANY MEMBER OF THE FOURTH GENERATION; THIS, IN TURN, HAS 
BOLSTERED HU\'S POSITION AS THE INDIVIDUAL MOST CAPABLE 
OF SERVING AS THE NEXT LEADERSHIP\'S CORE. 
 
5. (C) AS JIANG\'S SUCCESSOR-IN-WAITING, HU HAS LOYALLY 
CARRIED OUT HIS DUTIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, HU HEADED THE 1995 
\"CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION\" OF THEN-BEIJING PARTY 
SECRETARY CHEN XITONG, ONE OF JIANG\'S STRONGEST 
POLITICAL OPPONENTS.  IN DOING SO, HE REPORTEDLY 
PROTECTED MEMBERS OF DENG XIAOPING\'S FAMILY WHO MAY HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED IN WRONGDOING, AND PERSUADED JIANG TO 
REPLACE CHEN WITH THE MORE \"NEUTRAL\" WEI JIANXING, 
RATHER THAN WITH HUANG JU OR ANOTHER MEMBER OF JIANG\'S 
SHANGHAI FACTION.  HU ALSO PROVED HIS LOYALTY TO JIANG 
BY NOT OPPOSING THE GENERAL SECRETARY\'S MOVE TO FORCE 
QIAO SHI\'S RETIREMENT FROM THE CCP\'S STANDING COMMITTEE 
DURING THE 1997 15TH PARTY CONGRESS -- DESPITE THE FACT 
THAT QIAO WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INFLUENCES IN 
HU\'S METEORIC RISE. 
 
6.  (C) A VICE-MINISTERIAL-RANK OFFICIAL CURRENTLY 
STUDYING AT THE CENTRAL PARTY SCHOOL AND KNOWS HU 
PERSONALLY REPORTS AN \"ANHUI ANGLE\" TO THE HU 
RELATIONSHIP WITH JIANG (AND ZHU RONGJI).  THIS SOURCE 
RELATED THAT HU, JIANG AND ZHU COMMONLY -- AND PUBLICLY 
-- JOKED THAT THEY WERE AN \"ANHUI TRIO.\"  HU\'S FAMILY 
WAS FROM THE SOUTHERN CITY OF JIXI, ZHU\'S WAS ORIGINALLY 
FROM NORTHERN ANHUI, WHILE JIANG\'S GRANDPARENTS 
REPORTEDLY MIGRATED TO YANGZHOU (JIANGSU PROVINCE) FROM 
EASTERN ANHUI.  DESPITE HIS ANHUI ROOTS, \"CHAIRMAN JIANG 
ALWAYS PUTS DOWN \'YANGZHOU\' AS HIS HOMETOWN ON HIS PARTY 
PERSONNEL DOCUMENTS, BUT HU JINTAO PROUDLY LISTS HIMSELF 
AS A PERSON FROM JIXI.\"  THIS CONTACT ALSO ASSERTED THAT 
HU WAS A DISTANT RELATIVE OF FAMED CHINESE INTELLECTUAL 
HU SHI. 
 
A MASTER NETWORKER... 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (C) HU HAS SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING A SERIES OF 
RELATIONSHIP NETWORKS WHICH HAVE MADE HIM A PLAYER IN 
HIS OWN RIGHT WITHIN THE PARTY\'S TOP HIERARCHY.  THESE 
NETWORKS INCLUDE: 
 
-- THE QINGHUA CLIQUE.  HU STUDIED AT QINGHUA, CHINA\'S 
PREMIER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY, BETWEEN 1959 
AND 1964.  QINGHUA HAS LONG TAKEN PRIDE IN DEVELOPING 
STUDENTS WHO ARE BOTH TECHNICALLY EXPERT AND 
IDEOLOGICALLY \"RED\" BY SELECTING PARTICULARLY PROMISING 
STUDENTS TO BECOME UNDERGRADUATE \"POLITICAL ADVISORS.\" 
HU WAS SUCH AN ADVISOR AND, UPON GRADUATING, STAYED ON 
FOR THREE MORE YEARS AS A POLITICAL INSTRUCTOR.  WELL- 
INFORMED CHINESE SOURCES CONFIRMED THAT, IN THESE 
POSITIONS, HU CAME TO KNOW MOST OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES AT 
QINGHUA WELL, INCLUDING CURRENT MINISTER OF JUSTICE 
ZHANG FUSEN, CCP UNITED FRONT WORK DEPARTMENT DEPUTY LIU 
YANDONG, MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY JIA CHUNWANG, AND 
SHAANXI PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARY TIAN CHENGPING. 
 
-- THE GANSU FACTION.  IN 1968, HU ESCAPED THE WORST OF 
THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION BY VOLUNTEERING TO \"GO DOWN\" TO 
GANSU PROVINCE, WHERE HE SERVED ON CONSTRUCTION TEAMS. 
HU WAS PROMOTED RAPIDLY THROUGH THE RANKS UNTIL HE CAME 
TO THE ATTENTION OF PARTY SECRETARY SONG PING.  HU ALSO 
MET OTHER MEMBERS OF SONG PING\'S \"GANSU FACTION,\" 
INCLUDING CURRENT VICE PREMIER (AND PREMIER ZHU RONGJI\'S 
PROBABLE SUCCESSOR) WEN JIABAO AND MINISTER OF 
SUPERVISION ZHANG XUEZHONG.  SONG PING WAS INSTRUMENTAL 
IN HU\'S INTRODUCTION TO HU YAOBANG AND HIS 1992 
PROMOTION TO THE POLITBURO\'S STANDING COMMITTEE. 
 
-- THE COMMUNIST YOUTH LEAGUE (CYL).  THE CYL IS LIKE A 
MINIATURE COMMUNIST PARTY WITH A NATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT 
MIMICS THE CCP\'S OWN ORGANIZATION.  IT HAS BEEN A 
SPRINGBOARD TO PROMOTION FOR LEADERS, SUCH AS HU 
YAOBANG, WHO SUBSEQUENTLY ROSE TO SENIOR POSITIONS. 
HU\'S CONTACTS FROM HIS YEARS AS CYL PRINCIPAL DEPUTY 
(1982-1984) AND FIRST SECRETARY (1984-1985) INCLUDED: 
HENAN GOVERNOR (AND ONE OF HU\'S CLOSEST PERSONAL 
FRIENDS) LI KEQIANG, FUJIAN PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARY 
(AND ANOTHER CLOSE FRIEND) SONG DEFU, MINISTER OF PUBLIC 
SECURITY JIA CHUNWANG, STATE COUNCIL NATIONALITIES 
AFFAIRS\' COMMISSION CHAIRMAN LI DEZHU, AND XINJIANG 
PARTY SECRETARY WANG LEQUAN.  HU YAOBANG, WHO WAS 
GENERAL SECRETARY WHILE HU WAS AT THE CYL, SUBSEQUENTLY 
INTRODUCED HU TO QIAO SHI.  QIAO, IN TURN, LIKE SONG 
PING, WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GIVING HU\'S CAREER A NUMBER OF 
BOOSTS. 
 
8.  (C) SUCH NETWORKS ARE NOT UNUSUAL IN RELATIONSHIP- 
ORIENTED CHINA AND, INDEED, MOST PARTY MEMBERS NEED 
THESE NETWORKS FOR POLITICAL SURVIVAL AND ADVANCEMENT. 
WHAT IS UNUSUAL, HOWEVER, IS THE BREADTH AND VARIETY OF 
HU\'S BACKING.  HIS MULTIPLE NETWORKS, IN TURN, HAVE 
ALLOWED HIM TO CAPITALIZE ON HIS STATUS AS THE HEIR 
APPOINTED BY DENG AND HIS SKILLS AS A CONSENSUS-BUILDER, 
AND TO AVOID LINKING HIS FATE TOO CLOSELY TO ANY ONE 
FACTION WITHIN THE THIRD GENERATION.  HU\'S GENERAL 
ABILITY TO AVOID DISABLING ENTANGLEMENTS HAS, ACCORDING 
TO AT LEAST ONE WELL-INFORMED SOURCE, ENHANCED THE VICE 
PRESIDENT\'S REPUTATION AS A CONSENSUS-BUILDER AND 
STRENGTHENED HIS SUPPORT AMONG DIVERSE FACTIONS WITHIN 
THE PARTY.  IT WAS THIS STRENGTH, ACCORDING TO THIS 
SOURCE, THAT ALLOWED HU TO BLUNT JIANG\'S EFFORTS DURING 
THE 2000 CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM TO WIN ZENG QINGHONG\'S 
PROMOTION TO THE POLITBURO. 
 
9.  (C) NONETHELESS, HU\'S RECORD IN GAINING THE SUPPORT 
OF IMPORTANT FACTIONS IS NOT PERFECT.  A PARTY 
PRINCELING GROUP HEADED BY HE GUANGWEI REPORTEDLY 
ENGINEERED HU\'S SUMMARY DEPARTURE FROM THE CYL IN 1985 
AND HIS APPOINTMENT AS PARTY SECRETARY OF POVERTY- 
STRICKEN GUIZHOU PROVINCE.  CONTACTS ATTRIBUTED THIS 
INCIDENT BOTH TO JEALOUSY OF HU AND TO THE FACTIONAL 
INFIGHTING THAT EVENTUALLY LED TO HU YAOBANG\'S DEMISE. 
WHILE NONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE SINCE RISEN ABOVE 
THE VICE-MINISTER LEVEL, IT IS UNCLEAR TO WHAT DEGREE 
THE AFTERMATH OF THIS INCIDENT COULD AFFECT HU\'S FUTURE 
RELATIONS WITH OTHER PARTY PRINCELINGS. 
 
IS HU A CLOSET REFORMER? 
------------------------ 
 
10.  (C) HU HAS BEEN CAREFUL SINCE 1992 NOT TO DIVERGE 
FROM JIANG ON THE ISSUE OF POLITICAL REFORM.  YET HINTS 
FROM HIS PAST SUGGEST THAT HE MAY HAVE REFORMIST 
INCLINATIONS, SOURCES REPORT.  ACCORDING TO A WELL- 
CONNECTED ACADEMIC, WHILE IN GUIZHOU (1985-1988), HU 
ENCOURAGED HIS SUBORDINATES TO EXPERIMENT WITH ECONOMIC 
AND LIMITED SOCIAL REFORMS.  HU\'S ECONOMIC POLICIES AT 
THAT TIME WERE IN LINE WITH THE REFORMS BEING INTRODUCED 
ALONG CHINA\'S COASTAL REGIONS, BUT WERE CONSIDERED TO BE 
UNIQUE IN AN INTERIOR PROVINCE.  AS CYL FIRST SECRETARY, 
HU WAS AT THE FOREFRONT OF DEFENDING HU YAOBANG\'S 
REFORMS AGAINST CONSERVATIVE ATTACKS AS \"SPIRITUAL 
POLLUTION.\"  FURTHERMORE, AS PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL 
PARTY SCHOOL, HE HAS MOVED TO PROFESSIONALIZE THE 
CURRICULUM, AND ENCOURAGED THE SCHOOL TO BRING IN MORE 
OUTSIDE EXPERTS AND TO RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES TO 
TRADITIONAL SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY.  MANY ALSO POINT TO THE 
HEAVY INVOLVEMENT BY CENTRAL PARTY SCHOOL LEADERS IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF JIANG\'S \"THREE REPRESENTS,\" AND HU\'S OWN 
ROLE AS ONE OF THE CHIEF CHEERLEADERS FOR \"JIANG 
THOUGHT.\" 
 
11.  (C) WHILE MOST CONTACTS CONCUR THAT HU RECOGNIZES 
THE NEED FOR CHANGE, THE TYPE AND PACE OF REFORM HE 
MIGHT FAVOR IS STILL UNCLEAR.  SOME CONTACTS ASSERT 
WISTFULLY THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT\'S SUPPORT THE 
FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF \"JIANG THOUGHT\" IS GENUINE, AND 
THAT HE VIEWS THOSE CONCEPTS AS STEPPING STONES TO MORE 
SUBSTANTIAL REFORMS.  STILL OTHERS MAINTAIN THAT HU\'S 
CULTURAL REVOLUTION EXPERIENCE HAS SENSITIZED HIM TO THE 
DESTABILIZING DANGERS OF TOO-RAPID CHANGE AND THAT HE 
WILL CONTINUE TO \"GO SLOW.\"  NO MATTER WHERE HU STANDS 
ON REFORM, HOWEVER, ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO HU\'S FRIENDS HAS 
SUGGESTED THAT HU\'S STRATEGIES FOR IMPLEMENTING CHANGE 
WILL LIKELY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAVY- 
HANDED \"CAMPAIGN\"-STYLE TACTICS THAT JIANG HAS FAVORED 
IN MOVING FORWARD HIS OWN AGENDA. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12.  (C) WHILE HU JINTAO APPEARS WELL-GROOMED TO TAKE ON 
THE CHALLENGE OF GUIDING CHINA INTO THE 21ST CENTURY, 
HIS ABILITY TO AFFECT CHANGE WILL IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS 
DEPEND UPON HIS ABILITY TO PERSUADE THE 63 MILLION PARTY 
MEMBERS THAT CHANGE IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST.  AT THE 
VERY LEAST, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT HU WILL BE ABLE TO 
AFFECT ANY MAJOR CHANGES FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER HE 
TAKES OVER THE \"CORE\" LEADERSHIP ROLE.  EVEN IF HU\'S 
TRANSITION GOES SMOOTHLY, HE WILL STILL NEED TO SPEND 
SEVERAL YEARS CONSOLIDATING HIS POSITION AMONG THE 
PARTY\'S MEMBERSHIP -- MOST OF WHOM WOULD IMMEDIATELY 
BLOCK ANY REFORM-ORIENTED ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THE 
PERKS THEY HAVE COME TO TAKE FOR GRANTED.

REF:  BEIJING 585 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY JON ALOISI, POLITICAL MINISTER- 
COUNSELOR.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) CHINESE MEDIA ARE GIVING INCREASING PROMINENCE 
TO HU JINTAO IN A CLEAR SIGNAL TO CHINA\'S DOMESTIC 
AUDIENCE THAT HE HAS CONSOLIDATED HIS POSITION AS 
CHINA\'S NEXT PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY AND STATE 
PRESIDENT.  WE EXPECT HU\'S PUBLIC PROFILE TO CONTINUE TO 
RISE AS CHINA MOVES CLOSER TO THE 2002/2203 LEADERSHIP 
TRANSITION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBER AND STATE 
VICE PRESIDENT HU JINTAO IS WIDELY EXPECTED TO REPLACE 
JIANG ZEMIN AS PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY (AT THIS FALL\'S 
16TH PARTY CONGRESS) AND STATE PRESIDENT (DURING THE 
MARCH 2003 10TH NATIONAL PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS).  OVER 
RECENT WEEKS, CHINESE MEDIA HAVE INCREASED THEIR 
COVERAGE OF HU\'S ACTIVITIES.  A YEAR AGO, PRESS COVERAGE 
OF HU, WHO RANKS FIFTH IN THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP, 
FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON HIS ACTIVITIES AS PRESIDENT OF THE 
CENTRAL PARTY SCHOOL.  TODAY\'S COVERAGE IS MUCH MORE 
LIKELY TO PORTRAY HU IN LEADING ROLES. 
 
3. (U) WHILE CHINA\'S STATE-RUN MEDIA HAS NOT ALTERED THE 
FORMAL ORDER DICTATING THAT COVERAGE OF HU COMES AFTER 
THAT OF JIANG ZEMIN, ZHU RONGJI, LI PENG AND LI RUIHUAN, 
HU JINTAO\'S INCREASINGLY PROMINENT ROLE IS CLEAR IN THE 
CONTENT AND LENGTH OF HIS COVERAGE.  THE AUTHORITATIVE 
FEBRUARY 4 TV EVENING NEWS BROADCAST, FOR EXAMPLE, BEGAN 
WITH A SEVEN-MINUTE REPORT ON HU\'S SPEECH -- 
REPRESENTING THE PARTY\'S CENTER, THE STATE COUNCIL AND 
THE CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION -- AT A SPRING FESTIVAL 
RECEPTION FOR HUNDREDS OF RETIRED SENIOR CADRES. 
 
4. (U) A REVIEW OF THE OFFICIAL PRINT AND BROADCAST 
MEDIA OVER THE PAST MONTH CONFIRMS THAT HU\'S ACTIVITIES 
ARE APPEARING MORE FREQUENTLY AND PLACED MORE 
PROMINENTLY.  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, HU HAS 
BEEN REPORTED MAKING APPEARANCES AND \"IMPORTANT 
SPEECHES\" AT A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT OCCASIONS.  THESE 
INCLUDE HIS \"IMPORTANT SPEECH\" JANUARY 11 TO THE 
NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PARTY PROPAGANDA CHIEFS (JIANG 
MADE THE KEYNOTE SPEECH IN 2001) AND HIS JANUARY 21 
MEETING WITH PROMINENT AMERICAN VISITORS -- HIS FIRST 
SUCH ENCOUNTER (REFTEL). 
 
5. (U) FURTHER REFLECTING HIS ELEVATED STATUS, HU 
RECEIVED TOP-RANK BILLING AT THE JANUARY 25 CONFERENCE 
COMMEMORATING THE SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF JIANG\'S \"EIGHT- 
POINT PROPOSAL\" (WHERE QIAN QICHEN PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS 
TO CHINA\'S CROSS-STRAIT POLICY).  HE ALSO PARTICIPATED - 
- ALONGSIDE JIANG -- IN A FEBRUARY 2 CENTRAL MILITARY 
COMMISSION RECEPTION HONORING RETIRED MILITARY CADRES 
AND WAS \"IN CHARGE\" AT CEREMONY THAT SAME DAY JOINTLY 
SPONSORED BY THE PARTY AND THE STATE COUNCIL HONORING 
OUTSTANDING SCIENTISTS. 

COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C) WHILE CHINA HAS MOVED QUITE FAR BEYOND THE DAYS 
WHEN ANALYSTS POURED OVER PICTURES IN THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY 
TO PUZZLE OUT LEADERSHIP TRENDS, THE REGIME REMAINS 
SURPRISINGLY RIGID IN ITS MEDIA TREATMENT OF ITS 
LEADERS.  FOR DAILY VIEWERS OF THE CHINESE-LANGUAGE 
NEWS, HU\'S RISE IN STATURE IS A CLEAR INDICATION THAT 
THE LEADERSHIP TRANSITION IS PROCEEDING ACCORDING TO THE 
EXPECTED PLAN.

SUBJECT: CHINA:  2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 201772 
 
1.  BELOW IS THE 2002 TERRORISM REPORT FOR CHINA. 
RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO REFTEL PARAGRAPH TWO 
REQUIREMENTS. 
 
2.  A)  CHINA TREATS DESIGNATIONS OF TERRORISTS UNDER 
EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH THOSE 
DESIGNATED BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  THE PRC REGULARLY 
INSTRUCTS ITS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SEARCH FOR AND 
FREEZE ASSETS OF DESIGNATED TERRORIST ENTITIES.  CHINA 
HAS RATIFIED TEN OF THE TWELVE INTERNATIONAL 
COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS.  IT HAS SIGNED THE 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST 
FINANCING, BUT THE AGREEMENT HAS NOT YET BEEN SUBMITTED 
TO THE NATIONAL PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS FOR RATIFICATION. 
CHINA HAS NOT SIGNED THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE 
MARKING OF EXPLOSIVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETECTION. 
 
B)  THERE WERE NO ACTS OF TERRORISM COMMITTED IN CHINA 
THIS YEAR AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.  THERE 
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL REPORTS DURING THE YEAR OF BOMBINGS IN 
VARIOUS PARTS OF CHINA; IT IS UNCLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER 
THESE WERE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ACTS OF TERRORISM OR 
CRIMINAL ATTACKS. 
 
C,D)  EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ANY EXTRADITIONS OR REQUESTS 
FOR EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS TO OR FROM CHINA IN 2002. 
 
E)  CHINESE OFFICIALS AT ALL LEVELS REGULARLY DENOUNCE 
TERRORISM, BOTH IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA.  IF ASKED TO DO SO, WE BELIEVE CHINA 
WOULD GENERALLY COOPERATE WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
F)  CHINA REGULARLY PARTICIPATES IN SECURITY COUNCIL 
DISCUSSIONS ON TERRORISM AND JOINED IN STATEMENTS 
DENOUNCING TERRORISM AT THE 2002 APEC MEETING, THE ASEAN 
REGIONAL FORUM, AND THE ASEAN PLUS 3 MEETING.  CHINA 
ALSO ATTENDED THE MUNICH CONFERENCE ON SECURITY POLICY. 
 
G,H)  CHINA DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORISM, TERRORISTS OR 
TERRORIST GROUPS.  IT HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A 
TERRORISM ISSUE, BUT DOES MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
WITH ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY 
OF STATE AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. 
 
I) THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN CHINA\'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM IN THE PAST YEAR. 
 
J)  THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA HOLD SEMI-ANNUAL 
COUNTERTERRORISM CONSULTATIONS, AS WELL AS EXPERT LEVEL 
CONSULTATIONS ON THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF TERRORISM. 
CHINA ALSO ATTENDED THE SOUTHEAST ASIA COUNTERTERRORISM 
CONFERENCE IN HONOLULU.  AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM A, CHINA 
TREATS DESIGNATIONS OF TERRORISTS UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13224 ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH THOSE DESIGNATED BY THE 
UNITED NATIONS.  THE PRC REGULARLY INFORMS ITS FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS TO SEARCH FOR AND FREEZE ASSETS OF 
DESIGNATED TERRORIST ENTITIES.  THE UNITED STATES AND 
CHINA ALSO SHARE INFORMATION IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, 
INCLUDING THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT CHANNELS, CONCERNING 
PERSONS POSSIBLY INVOLVED WITH TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. 
 
CHINA AGREED IN 2002 TO PERMIT THE FBI TO OPEN AN OFFICE 
IN BEIJING.  THAT OFFICE IS NOW OPEN AND WILL HELP 
COORDINATE WITH THE PRC ON TERRORISM-RELATED ISSUES. 
 
THE UNITED STATES HAS ALSO ASKED CHINA TO PARTICIPATE IN 
THE CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE (CSI).  DURING HIS 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH IN CRAWFORD, TEXAS, 
PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN ANNOUNCED ACCEPTANCE OF THE CSI. 
DETAILS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT.

SUPREME PEOPLE\'S COURT (SPC) AND SUPREME PEOPLE\'S 
PROCURATORATE (SPP).  WHILE THE NPC\'S ROLE IN THIS 
PROCESS IS LITTLE MORE THAN THAT OF A RUBBERSTAMP, THE 
VERY FACT THAT THE VOTING RESULTS WILL BE MADE PUBLIC 
FORCES THOSE WHO ARE REALLY CALLING THE SHOTS TO 
NOMINATE TECHNICALLY \"QUALIFIED\" CANDIDATES WHOSE 
SELECTION CAN BE DEFENDED.  RELATIVELY LOW \"VOTING\" 
OUTCOMES WILL ALSO INDICATE DELEGATES\' CONFIDENCE, OR 
LACK THEREOF, IN THE NEW LEADERS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB THAT DELEGATES WILL 
PERFORM AT THE NPC SESSION, WHICH WILL BEGIN MARCH 5, IS 
THE SELECTION OF CHINA\'S NEW STATE LEADERS. 
SPECIFICALLY, DELEGATES MUST APPROVE IN A CONFIRMATION- 
LIKE \"ELECTION\" CHINA\'S STATE PRESIDENT AND VICE 
PRESIDENT, CHINA\'S NEW PREMIER, VICE-PREMIERS, STATE 
COUNCILLORS, HEADS OF STATE COUNCIL MINISTRIES AND 
COMMISSIONS (CURRENTLY 29 BODIES, THOUGH THIS WILL 
CHANGE AS A RESULT OF A RESTRUCTURING PLAN WHICH WILL 
ALSO BE INTRODUCED AT THIS NPC SESSION), THE STATE 
COUNCIL SECRETARY-GENERAL, THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF 
THE CMC, THE MEMBERS OF THE NPC\'S STANDING COMMITTEE, 
THE NPC STANDING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND CHAIRMEN OF THE 
LEGISLATURE\'S 14 FUNCTIONAL COMMITTEES, THE SPC 
PRESIDENT AND THE SPP PROCURATOR-GENERAL.  THIS PROCESS 
WILL END THE TWO-PART GENERATIONAL TURNOVER OF LEADERS 
WHICH BEGAN WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S (CCP\'S) 16TH 
NATIONAL CONGRESS LAST NOVEMBER. 
 
3.  (C) NOTWITHSTANDING THE NPC\'S CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE 
TO SELECT LEADERS AND MEMBERS OF CHINA\'S HIGHEST STATE 
ORGANS, DELEGATES IN REALITY WILL ONLY BE ASKED TO 
RUBBERSTAMP CANDIDATE NAMELISTS FINALIZED DURING THE 
FEBRUARY 24-26 SECOND PLENUM OF THE CCP\'S CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE.  MANY OF THOSE ELECTED INTO THE PARTY\'S TOP 
BODIES (I.E., THE STANDING COMMITTEE AND POLITBURO) 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER LAST NOVEMBER\'S PARTY CONGRESS WILL 
ASSUME GOVERNMENT POSITIONS COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR 
PARTY RANK (I.E., PREMIER, VICE PREMIER OR STATE 
COUNCILLOR).  MOST OF THE REMAINING CANDIDATES ON THE 
LISTS PRESENTED TO NPC DELEGATES WERE PREVIOUSLY PLACED 
IN POSITIONS WHICH WILL ALLOW THEM TO EMERGE DURING THE 
NPC SESSION AS THE \"MOST QUALIFIED\" CANDIDATES. 
 
EMPHASIS ON QUALIFICATIONS, NOT PARTY CONNECTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4.  (C) OUR CONTACTS CONCUR, HOWEVER, THAT THE DYNAMICS 
OF THE GOVERNMENT TURNOVER DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THE 
PARTY LEADERSHIP TRANSITION.  MOST IMPORTANT IN THIS 
REGARD IS THAT, UNLIKE THOSE PARTICIPATING IN THE PARTY 
CONGRESS, NPC VOTE TOTALS ARE MADE PUBLIC.  WHILE CHOSEN 
FOR THEIR POLITICAL RELIABILITY, EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN 
THAT SOME NPC DELEGATES ARE WILLING TO VOTE \"NO\" OR TO 
ABSTAIN IN CASES WHERE THE CANDIDATES ARE UNPOPULAR. 
THIS PUTS PRESSURE ON PARTY LEADERS TO NOMINATE 
TECHNICALLY \"QUALIFIED\" CANDIDATES WHOSE SELECTION CAN 
BE DEFENDED TO NPC DELEGATES.  OTHERWISE, THE PARTY 
RISKS SEEING ITS CHOSEN CANDIDATES RECEIVE 
EMBARRASSINGLY LOW (I.E., BELOW 90 PERCENT) SUPPORT 
RATES, THOUGH THE NPC HAS NEVER REJECTED OUTRIGHT ANY OF 
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S \"OFFICIAL\" CANDIDATES. 
 
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) GIVEN JIANG ZEMIN\'S PHASED RETIREMENT THAT BEGAN 
WITH HIS RELINQUISHING THE CCP\'S GENERAL SECRETARY 
POSITION LAST NOVEMBER, THE BIG PRIZE AT THIS NPC 
SESSION WILL BE HIS STATE PRESIDENT POSITION.  THE 76 
YEAR-OLD PRESIDENT HAS SERVED HIS CONSTITUTIONAL TWO- 
TERM LIMIT.  JIANG CONFIRMED TO SECRETARY POWELL ON 
FEBRUARY 24 THAT HE WILL, AS EXPECTED, TURN OVER HIS 
STATE POSITION TO 60 YEAR-OLD CCP GENERAL SECRETARY HU 
JINTAO (REF B).  EMBASSY SOURCES CONCUR THAT JIANG\'S 
PROTEGE, FIFTH-RANKED STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBER ZENG 
QINGHONG, WILL TAKE OVER HU\'S VICE PRESIDENCY.  WORTH 
WATCHING WILL BE THE NUMBER OF VOTES RECEIVED BY BOTH 
MEN; A LOW APPROVAL LEVEL FOR ZENG, PARTICULARLY IF HU\'S 
POSITIVE VOTE IS HIGH, COULD PROVE EMBARRASSING TO 
JIANG. 
 
STATE COUNCIL LEADERSHIP POSITIONS 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) THERE WILL BE A CONSIDERABLE TURNOVER AT THE TOP 
LEVELS OF CHINA\'S (GOVERNMENTAL) STATE COUNCIL THIS 
YEAR.  PREMIER ZHU RONGJI, TWO OF FOUR VICE PREMIERS (LI 
LANQING AND QIAN QICHEN), THREE OF FIVE STATE 
COUNCILLORS (CHI HAOTIAN, ISMAIL AMAT AND WANG ZHONGYU), 
AND THE STATE COUNCIL SECRETARY-GENERAL (ALSO WANG 
ZHONGYU) ARE ALL WELL OVER THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE 
OF 65.  THE REMAINING TWO VICE PREMIERS (WU BANGGUO AND 
WEN JIABAO) AND STATE COUNCILLOR LUO GAN ARE ALL MEMBERS 
OF THE CCP\'S NEW STANDING COMMITTEE, INDICATING THAT 
THEIR RETIREMENT IS NOT IMMINENT.  WU YI, THE REMAINING 
STATE COUNCILLOR AND THE ONLY WOMAN AT THE TOP LEVELS OF 
CHINA\'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, WAS ELECTED TO FULL 
POLITBURO MEMBERSHIP (ALBEIT NOT TO THE STANDING 
COMMITTEE) AT THE 16TH PARTY CONGRESS. 
 
7.  (C) EMBASSY CONTACTS ARE ALSO IN AGREEMENT THAT WEN 
JIABAO, WHO HAS BEEN PERFORMING MANY OF THE PREMIER\'S 
RESPONSIBILITIES SINCE LAST NOVEMBER, WILL REPLACE ZHU. 
THEY ALSO AGREE THAT SIXTH-RANKING STANDING COMMITTEE 
MEMBER HUANG JU WILL REPLACE LI LANQING AS EXECUTIVE 
VICE PREMIER, WHILE POLITBURO MEMBERS WU YI, ZENG PEIYAN 
AND HUI LIANGYU WILL ALL BE \"ELECTED\" VICE PREMIERS. 
 
8.  (C) WITH THE EXCEPTION OF POLITBURO MEMBER AND 
PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY GENERAL CAO GANGCHUAN, WHO 
SEEMS CERTAIN TO REPLACE CHI HAOTIAN, THERE IS LESS 
CERTAINTY OVER THE NEW STATE COUNCILLORS.  VARIOUS 
SOURCES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT POLITBURO MEMBER (AND 
MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY) ZHOU YONGKANG (60), AND 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS TANG JIAXUAN (65), DOJE CERING 
(63), DAI BINGGUO (62) AND HUA JIANMIN (63) ARE POSSIBLE 
CANDIDATES.  HUA, WHO HAS BEEN SERVING AS THE DIRECTOR 
OF THE OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S LEADING GROUP 
FOR FINANCE AND ECONOMICS, MIGHT ALSO BE A CANDIDATE TO 
REPLACE WANG ZHONGYU AS STATE COUNCIL SECRETARY-GENERAL. 
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS, SOURCES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT HUANG 
JU, WHO SUFFERS FROM A REPUTATION FOR CORRUPTION AND 
IMMORAL BEHAVIOR, AND ZHOU YONGKANG, WHOSE CONTROVERSIAL 
ASSIGNMENT LAST DECEMBER AS MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY 
IS SEEN BY MANY AS REVERSING A 20-YEAR EFFORT TO 
DECREASE HIS MINISTRY\'S POWER, ARE MOST LIKELY TO 
RECEIVE LOW NPC VOTES. 
 
COMMISSIONS AND MINISTRIES 
-------------------------- 
 
9.  (U) NINETEEN OF CHINA\'S 29 MINISTERS AND COMMISSION 
DIRECTORS ARE OVER 60.  SIX ARE OVER OR NEARING 
RETIREMENT AGE.  THESE ARE:  MINISTER OF NATIONAL 
DEFENSE CHI HAOTIAN (73), MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
TANG JIAXUAN (65), MINISTER OF RAILWAYS FU ZHIHUAN (65), 
MINISTER OF INFORMATION INDUSTRY WU JICHUAN (65), STATE 
DEVELOPMENT PLANNING COMMISSION DIRECTOR ZENG PEIYAN 
(64) AND STATE COMMISSION OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND 
INDUSTRY FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE DIRECTOR LIU JIBIN (64). 
IN ADDITION, MINISTER OF CIVIL AFFAIRS DOJE CERING (63) 
HAS SERVED MORE THAN ONE FULL TERM.  (WHILE SERVING MORE 
THAN ONE TERM DOES NOT NECESSARILY DISQUALIFY A MINISTER 
FOR REMAINING IN OFFICE, IT DOES SUGGEST THAT THE 
INDIVIDUAL IS LIABLE TO BE REASSIGNED.) 
 
10.  (C) WORKING-LEVEL CONTACTS AT THE MINISTRY OF 
FINANCE (MOF) HAVE INDICATED THAT CURRENT FINANCE 
MINISTER XIANG HUAICHENG (64) WILL BE REPLACED BY STATE 
ADMINISTRATION OF TAXATION (SAT)_DIRECTOR JIN RENQING. 
XIANG WILL TAKE OVER MANAGEMENT OF THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT\'S SOCIAL SECURITY FUND FROM FORMER FINANCE 
MINISTER LIU ZHONGLI.  ADDITIONAL MOF SCUTTLEBUTT NAMES 
JIN\'S SUCCESSOR AT THE SAT AS XIE XUREN, A VICE MINISTER 
OF THE STATE ECONOMIC AND TRADE COMMISSION WHO 
PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS A VICE MINISTER OF FINANCE AND AS A 
VICE SECRETARY OF THE CCP\'S FINANCIAL WORK COMMISSION. 
IN ADDITION, PEOPLE\'S BANK OF CHINA GOVERNOR ZHOU 
XIAOCHUAN, WHO ONLY ASSUMED HIS POST AT THE END OF 
DECEMBER, WILL BE RECONFIRMED AS HEAD OF CHINA\'S CENTRAL 
BANK. 
 
11.  (C) GIVEN EFFORTS AT THE PARTY CONGRESS TO PUT 
SIGNIFICANTLY YOUNGER CADRES IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS, A 
CENTRAL PARTY SCHOOL DIRECTOR SUGGESTED THAT THE 
TURNOVER COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL, EVEN OF LEADERS WHO ARE 
STILL SEVERAL YEARS AWAY FROM MANDATORY RETIREMENT AND 
EVEN WITHIN THOSE MINISTRIES UNAFFECTED BY THE 
RESTRUCTURING PLAN.  OTHER SOURCES DISAGREE, SUGGESTING 
THAT MANY OF THESE 60-SOMETHING INDIVIDUALS IN FACT HAVE 
BEEN IN PLACE LESS THAN A FULL TERM AND ARE THUS LIKELY 
TO REMAIN FOR AT LEAST A FEW MORE YEARS.  SUPPORTING THE 
LATTER ANALYSIS IS THE FACT THAT FEW OF THE EXECUTIVE 
VICE MINISTERS WHO WOULD MOST LIKELY REPLACE OUTGOING 
MINISTERS ARE FULL OR ALTERNATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
MEMBERS. 
 
12.  (C) EMBASSY CONTACTS HAVE PICKED CAO GANGCHUAN TO 
REPLACE CHI HAOTIAN, EXECUTIVE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER LI 
ZHAOXING TO REPLACE TANG AND DEPUTY STATE COUNCIL 
SECRETARY-GENERAL MA KAI TO TAKE OVER FROM ZENG PEIYAN 
AT A RESTRUCTURED STATE DEVELOPMENT AND PLANNING 
COMMISSION.  SOURCES AT THE MINISTRY OF CIVIL AFFAIRS 
CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT EXECUTIVE VICE MINISTER LI 
XUEJU, ALTHOUGH NOT A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER OR 
ALTERNATE, MAY REPLACE DOJE CERING. 
 
CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION 
--------------------------- 
 
13.  (C) SINCE THE 1970\'S, THE MEMBERSHIPS OF THE STATE 
AND THE PARTY CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSIONS HAVE BEEN 
IDENTICAL; NO CHANGES IN THIS REGARD ARE LIKELY AT THE 
10TH NPC.  JIANG ZEMIN TOLD SECRETARY POWELL ON FEBRUARY 
24 THAT HE WILL RETAIN HIS CMC CHAIRMANSHIP, DESPITE 
SOME SPECULATION TO THE CONTRARY.  REMAINING STATE CMC 
MEMBERS WILL BE THE SAME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SERVING ON 
THE PARTY CMC. 
 
NPC POSITIONS 
------------- 
 
14.  (U) PROBABLY THE LARGEST TURNOVER OF PERSONNEL WILL 
BE OF THOSE WHO WILL LEAD THE NPC.  STANDING COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMAN LI PENG, WHO IS 74, WILL DEFINITELY RETIRE, 
ALONG WITH 17 STANDING COMMITTEE VICE CHAIRMEN (ALL BUT 
THREE OF WHOM ARE WELL OVER 65) AND AT LEAST 13 OF 14 
CHAIRMEN OF THE NPC\'S FUNCTIONAL COMMITTEES.  THE NEW 
NPC DELEGATES MUST ALSO ELECT A NEW STANDING COMMITTEE 
(CURRENTLY 136 MEMBERS). 
 
15.  (C) WHILE EMBASSY SOURCES AGREE THAT CCP STANDING 
COMMITTEE MEMBER WU BANGGUO WILL REPLACE LI PENG, 
SOURCES ARE LESS CERTAIN ABOUT WHO WILL REPLACE THE 
OTHERS.  SOUTHERN WEEKEND ON FEBRUARY 27 SUGGESTED THAT 
LEADERS MAY SEEK TO ADD TWENTY \"SPECIAL MEMBERS\" WHO ARE 
BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE NPC FROM GOVERNMENT POSITIONS 
DURING THE \"PEAK OF THEIR CAREERS\" IN ORDER TO CREATE A 
MORE PROFESSIONAL, TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT STANDING 
COMMITTEE, BUT DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY NAMES.  SOURCES HAVE 
INDICATED THAT MANY DELEGATES ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE 
LESS-THAN-DYNAMIC WU AS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL GUIDE 
THE NPC OVER THE COMING YEARS, BUT NOBODY EXPECTS THE 
VOTE FOR WU TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR AS LOW AS THAT FOR THE 
LIKELY NEW CPPCC CHAIRMAN, JIA QINGLIN (REF C). 
 
SUPREME PEOPLE\'S COURT AND SUPREME PEOPLE\'S 
PROCURATORATE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
16.  (C) EMBASSY SOURCES CONCUR THAT XIAO YANG (64), THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE SPC, AND HAN ZHUBIN (71), PROCURATOR 
GENERAL OF THE SPP, ARE BOTH LIKELY TO RETIRE.  SPC 
OFFICIALS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT XIAO\'S EXECUTIVE VICE 
PRESIDENT, CAO JIANMING, IS MOST LIKELY TO REPLACE HIM, 
THOUGH CAO IS NOT A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER.  SOURCES 
OUTSIDE THE SPC HAVE SUGGESTED THAT CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
MEMBER AND FORMER MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY JIA 
CHUNWANG (64) COULD REPLACE HAN.

SUBJECT: TAIWAN: CHINA\'S NEW LEADERSHIP TO CONTINUE 
\"MODERATE\" APPROACH 
 
REF:  BEIJING 3082 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JON 
ALOISI.  REASONS: 1.5 (B/D). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) A PROMINENT PRC ANALYST TOLD US HE EXPECTS 
BEIJING\'S POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN TO SHOW CONTINUITY, WITH 
THE NEW LEADERSHIP CONTINUING TO PURSUE A RELATIVELY 
MODERATE APPROACH FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING ECONOMIC AND 
OTHER UNOFFICIAL LINKS.  OUR CONTACT SUGGESTED THAT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF HU JINTAO\'S MARCH 11 SPEECH TO THE NPC 
TAIWAN DELEGATION WAS THE WAY HE PACKAGED TOGETHER A 
NUMBER OF MODERATE POINTS, EACH OF WHICH HAD BEEN MADE 
BEFORE BUT SEPARATELY RATHER THAN TOGETHER.  BASED ON 
HIS ANALYSIS OF TAIWAN\'S POLITICAL DYNAMICS, THE ANALYST 
WAS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS FOR 
OPENING DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORTATION LINKS.  HIS 
THINKING CLOSELY TRACKS WITH THAT OF OTHER KNOWLEDGEABLE 
EMBASSY CONTACTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) GUO ZHENYUAN, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE MFA- 
AFFILIATED CHINA INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, 
RECENTLY DISCUSSED WITH US CROSS-STRAIT DEVELOPMENTS, 
INCLUDING THE TAIWAN POLICY OF BEIJING\'S NEW LEADERSHIP. 
GIVEN PRC POLITICAL DYNAMICS, GUO EXPLAINED, THERE WILL 
BE A HIGH DEGREE OF CONTINUITY IN POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN 
DESPITE THE CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP.  IN ONE SENSE, PARTY 
GENERAL SECRETARY HU JINTAO\'S MARCH 11 \"IMPORTANT 
SPEECH\" ON TAIWAN POLICY TO THE NATIONAL PEOPLE\'S 
CONGRESS \"TAIWAN DELEGATION\" CONTAINED NOTHING NEW, GUO 
SAID.  EACH OF THE POINTS MADE BY HU HAS BEEN STATED 
SEPARATELY IN THE PAST BY VARIOUS CHINESE LEADERS AND 
OFFICIALS.  WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT HU\'S MARCH 11 REMARKS, 
GUO STRESSED, IS THE WAY HE PACKAGED TOGETHER FOR THE 
FIRST TIME WHAT ARE BEING CALLED THE \"FOUR POINTS\" AND 
\"THREE WHATEVERS\" OF HIS TAIWAN POLICY. 
 
3.  (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, DURING HIS MARCH 11 
REMARKS HU JINTAO DISCUSSED \"TAIWAN WORK UNDER THE NEW 
CIRCUMSTANCES.\"  HU\'S \"FOUR POINTS\" ARE: 
 
-- ALWAYS ADHERE TO THE ONE-CHINA PRINCIPLE; 
 
-- SPARE NO EFFORTS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL 
EXCHANGES ACROSS THE TAIWAN STRAIT; 
 
-- FURTHER IMPLEMENT THE PRINCIPLE OF PLACING HOPES ON 
THE TAIWAN PEOPLE; AND, 
 
-- UNITE COMPATRIOTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TAIWAN STRAIT 
TO JOINTLY PUSH FORWARD THE GREAT REJUVENATION OF THE 
CHINESE NATION. 
 
ACCORDING TO HU\'S \"THREE WHATEVERS,\" BEIJING SHOULD 
SPARE NO EFFORT IN DOING WHATEVER BENEFITS: 
 
-- THE INTERESTS OF THE TAIWAN PEOPLE; 
 
-- THE UNIFICATION OF THE MOTHERLAND; AND, 
 
-- THE \"GREAT REJUVENATION\" OF THE CHINESE NATION. 
 
4.  (C) IN HIS FIRST MAJOR STATEMENT ON TAIWAN POLICY, 
HU CLOSELY FOLLOWED AND ENDORSED THE LINE SET BY JIANG 
ZEMIN, BUT ALSO PUT HIS PERSONAL STAMP ON POLICY BY 
PACKAGING HIS MESSAGE IN A NEW WAY.  CHINESE MEDIA 
CHARACTERIZED HU\'S REMARKS AS MODERATE AND CONCILIATORY, 
FOCUSING ON POSITIVE THEMES SUCH AS INCREASING ECONOMIC 
AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES, HELPING TAIWAN INVESTORS, 
PROMOTING DIRECT TRANSPORTATION LINKS, AND EXCHANGING 
VIEWS WITH PARTIES AND PERSONALITIES IN VARIOUS CIRCLES 
FROM TAIWAN.  ACCORDING TO GUO, THE MODERATION EVIDENT 
IN HU\'S REMARKS WAS A GOODWILL GESTURE TO TAIWAN.  IN 
ONE PHRASE EMPHASIZING THE SHARED INTERESTS OF TAIWAN 
AND THE MAINLAND, HU STATED THAT \"CHINA BELONGS TO 
COMPATRIOTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STRAIT AND IS OUR 
COMMON HOMELAND.\"  PREMIER WEN JIABAO ECHOED THE SAME 
THEME IN HIS MARCH 19 PRESS CONFERENCE (REFTEL), QUOTING 
A POEM IN WHICH A DECEASED KMT VETERAN HAD DESCRIBED HIS 
LONGING FOR HIS HOMETOWN ON THE MAINLAND. 
 
5.  (C) GUO ACKNOWLEDGED OUR OBSERVATION THAT HU JINTAO 
NOW APPEARS TO BE IN CHARGE OF TAIWAN POLICY AND THAT 
ZENG QINGHONG ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE A PROMINENT ROLE.  GUO 
VOLUNTEERED THAT JIANG ZEMIN IS STILL INFLUENTIAL ON THE 
ISSUE.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT OFFICIALS BELOW THE TOP 
LEADERSHIP INVOLVED IN TAIWAN AFFAIRS, GUO CITED STATE 
COUNCIL TAIWAN AFFAIRS OFFICE (TAO) DIRECTOR CHEN 
YUNLIN, ADDING THAT HE HAD NOT HEARD OF ANY CHANGES 
BEING MADE IN THE TAO LINEUP.  COMMENT: GUO\'S REMARKS 
TRACK GENERALLY WITH RECENT PRESS REPORTS THAT SUGGEST 
HU JINTAO AND ZENG QINGHONG HAVE SUCCEEDED JIANG ZEMIN 
AND QIAN QICHEN AS DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE 
PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S TAIWAN AFFAIRS LEADING GROUP. 
OTHER KNOWLEDGEABLE EMBASSY CONTACTS ALSO AGREE ON THIS 
LINEUP.  END COMMENT. 
 
6.  (C) GUO WAS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR A 
BREAKTHROUGH ON THE OPENING OF DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT 
TRANSPORTATION LINKS PRIOR TO THE MARCH 2004 TAIWAN 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  ACCORDING TO GUO\'S ANALYSIS, 
CHEN SHUI-BIAN IS UNLIKELY TO OPEN DIRECT LINKS AT THIS 
TIME BECAUSE HE CALCULATES THE MOVE WOULD COST HIM 
POLITICAL SUPPORT FROM \"INDEPENDENCE FUNDAMENTALISTS,\" 
WHILE CREDIT WOULD GO TO OPPOSITION POLITICIANS RATHER 
THAN HIMSELF.  GUO SUGGESTED THAT IT IS STILL TOO EARLY 
TO PREDICT ELECTION TRENDS AND THAT, AS INCUMBENT 
PRESIDENT, CHEN SHUI-BIAN IS STRONGER POLITICALLY THAN 
IN 2000.  IF THE LIEN/SOONG TICKET WINS, GUO PREDICTED, 
CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS WOULD BE MORE STABLE BECAUSE LIEN 
WOULD BE MORE POSITIVE TOWARD DIRECT LINKS.  GUO ALSO 
STATED THAT LIEN \"ACCEPTS\" THE 1992 CONSENSUS ON ONE 
CHINA AND PREDICTS HE WOULD NOT, IF ELECTED, SUGGEST 
COMPETING CONSTRUCTS SUCH AS \"ONE COUNTRY ON EACH SIDE.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C) THE NEW CHINESE LEADERSHIP WANTS TO KEEP THE 
CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONSHIP ON ITS CURRENT RELATIVELY 
STABLE COURSE, HOPING THAT ECONOMIC AND OTHER UNOFFICIAL 
LINKS WILL WORK TO BRING THE TWO SIDES TOGETHER.  RECENT 
CONCRETE SIGNS OF A RELATIVELY POSITIVE APPROACH BY 
BEIJING INCLUDE ITS APPROVAL FOR TAIWAN AIRLINES TO FLY 
THROUGH PRC AIRSPACE DURING THE IRAQ WAR AND THE PLA\'S 
PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF WITHDRAWING 
MISSILES FROM AREAS OPPOSITE TAIWAN.  DESPITE ITS 
RELATIVELY POSITIVE APPROACH, BEIJING REMAINS \"VIGILANT\" 
TO TRY TO HEAD OFF POSSIBLE MOVES BY TAIWAN THAT COULD 
\"FORCE\" IT TO REACT IN WAYS LIKELY TO HAVE DAMAGING SIDE 
EFFECTS.  SPECIFIC PRC CONCERNS INCLUDE \"BREAKTHROUGHS\" 
BY TAIWAN IN MILITARY RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES 
AND U.S. VISITS BY SENIOR TAIWAN LEADERS.  CURRENT 
CRITICISM OF TAIWAN LEADERS OVER THE PRC\'S MISHANDLING 
OF SARS COULD ALSO SPARK A NEGATIVE REACTION FROM 
BEIJING, ESPECIALLY IF MAINLAND CRITICS PICK UP THE 
CALL.

TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, PGOV, CH 
SUBJECT: CHARISMATIC MUSLIM CLERIC SHUT DOWN BY KUNMING 
ISLAMIC ASSOCIATION 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Bleyle. 
Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  An independent Muslim cleric in 
Kunming, Yunnan Province, was banned from preaching by 
local Islamic officials after he began to attract 
large crowds to his mosque.  Although qualified as an 
Imam, the cleric got on the wrong side of Chinese 
officialdom after he traveled as a youth to study at a 
madrasa in Pakistan without permission.  End Summary. 
 
Popular Imam Banned in Kunming 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) The local Islamic Association in Kunming, 
capital of Yunnan Province, has banned a popular 
independent Muslim cleric from preaching and teaching, 
the cleric\'s wife told ConGenOff recently.  The 
cleric, Ma Jingxin (strictly protect, had been drawing 
crowds to his sermons at the Wang Qi Yin Mosque, 
northeast of Kunming\'s city center.  Official 
tolerance for Ma ran out earlier this year, when he 
was told he could no longer serve as an Imam at the 
mosque. 
 
Increased Attendance Drew Attention 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Before Ma began teaching at the Wang Qi Yin 
Mosque in early 2001, only a few dozen men would 
appear for Friday prayers and the madrasa had only 
about ten students.  Under his guidance, the mosque 
thrived, Ma\'s wife told us.  Hundreds would show up on 
Fridays, and madrasa enrollment increased to around 
seventy.  Attendance began to decline again after Ma 
stopped leading the congregation.  Ma was not 
prevented from visiting the mosque, and still goes 
there almost daily to pray and meet with other 
adherents. 
 
A \"Bad Element\" 
--------------- 
 
4. (C) As a youth, Ma had traveled to Pakistan-- 
without official permission--to study in a madrasa. 
When he returned to China, he was declared ineligible 
for government employment and barred from leadership 
roles in China\'s officially sanctioned Islamic 
organizations.  Although qualified as an Imam, and 
respected as such by many of his peers, he was 
prevented from serving as one.  Many others who went 
abroad to study Islam had been similarly blackballed, 
Mrs. Ma stated. 
 
Background Note 
--------------- 
 
5. (C) ConGenOff first met Ma, a Chinese Muslim or 
\"Hui,\" during a personal visit to Kunming in 1996, 
when Ma offered to sell him some examples of his 
calligraphy.  Ma uses traditional Chinese materials 
(paper, ink and brush) to write prayers and sayings in 
Arabic, creating a unique form of Islamic art with 
Chinese characteristics.  Ma was not at home when 
ConGenOff sought him out during a recent visit to 
Kunming, but his wife was eager to share his story. 
 
6. (C) The area where Ma lives, in the heart of the 
former Muslim quarter, has been greatly diminished in 
the past seven years.  Most of the quarter\'s old 
houses were torn down to make way for a park that 
serves occupants of adjacent high-rise apartments.  A 
small neighborhood mosque still stands, though Ma\'s 
family has had conflicts with its leadership. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Historically, relations between Hui and non- 
Muslim Chinese in Yunnan have been rocky and, 
occasionally, violent.  As an \"unlicensed\" Imam, Ma 
was able to preach as long as he did not attract 
attention to himself.  When the crowds grew too large, 
authorities apparently stepped in to shut him down. 
Presumably, recent global events have also led local 
authorities to be more mindful of Islamic activism, 
particularly when coupled with unsanctioned teachings 
from foreign schools.

Classified By: Acting Political Minister Counselor Kin Moy. 
Reason. 1.5 (b), (d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The new \"Hu-Wen\" government is attempting to 
push openness in a number of areas, both to 
demonstrate its closeness to the people and as an 
antidote to corruption, according to Beijing 
University Institute of Political Development and 
Governance Director Xie Qingkun.  That agenda has 
suffered setbacks recently with the tightening of 
media controls and the Politburo Standing Committee\'s 
rejection of an initiative to require financial 
disclosure statements from officials.  Xie tied the 
media tightening to caution in advance of the Party 
Plenum and also recent criticism of Jiang Zemin.  He 
opined that initiatives aimed at curbing corruption 
are being hampered by vested interests.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) In a wide-ranging discussion of the current 
political scene with poloff September 19, director of 
Beijing University\'s Institute of Political 
Development and Governance Xie Qingkun echoed the 
views of other contacts here that both President and 
Party General Secretary Hu Jintao and Premier Wen 
Jiabao (referred to as the \"Hu-Wen government\") are 
pushing for greater openness in government and party 
operations in order to promote closeness to the people 
and as an antidote to corruption.  Xie noted that the 
SARS crisis had helped them push this agenda, but that 
recent attempts to push transparency have encountered 
setbacks. 
 
Media Clampdown 
--------------- 
 
3.  (C) While Hu had taken some small steps to make 
the media more \"relevant\" after assuming office, Xie 
stated that media controls have now been tightened, 
referring to a recent party directive to avoid 
discussions of political reform (refs).  He believes 
this is directly tied to a perceived need to show 
unity in advance of the October Party Plenum by 
limiting public debate.  Xie also believes that Party 
authorities are concerned about criticism of Jiang 
Zemin in newspapers, and especially on some web sites, 
in advance of the decision to include the Three 
Represents in the Chinese constitution is an 
additional factor behind the tightening. 
 
Financial Disclosures Rejected 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) Xie also reported that an initiative of the 
\"Hu-Wen government\" to require financial disclosure 
statements from high-level government officials and 
their families was rejected by the Politburo Standing 
Committee, with only Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao voting 
in support of the measure.  Xie noted that this shows 
that Hu has not consolidated power in the Politburo, 
and that its members remain wedded to opacity where 
their own sources of income are concerned.  Such a 
measure would particularly threaten the children of 
high-level leaders, Xie said. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (C) Reforms in China rarely proceed in a 
straightforward manner.  While Hu effectively used 
greater media openness during the SARS epidemic to 
forestall criticism against the Party, such moves are 
certain to cause concern among those who fear that 
more open discourse will \"get out of hand\" and spark 
widespread anger against the Party itself.  Similarly, 
financial disclosure is not a new concept in China; 
various initiatives have been announced over the 
years.  What is most interesting in Xie\'s comments is 
the strong belief, shared by many of our contacts, 
that Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao form a team, and that 
this team is pressing for systemic change within the 
system against resistance within the Party.  Such 
sentiments are the basis of the growing popular 
support for Hu Jintao, in particular.

Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) Director 
General Wang Zhenyao (strictly protect) has helped 
arrange three of Premier Wen Jiabao\'s domestic trips 
since last year and reports that Wen\'s intellectual 
curiosity and impatience with bureaucratic practices 
can cause \"headaches\" for his staff and handlers when 
the Premier travels.  Wang said Wen has modest 
personal needs, but constantly queries subordinates 
about his itinerary and often deviates from his 
schedule because he is consumed with getting an 
\"unfiltered\" view of local areas.  End Summary. 
 
Just the Facts 
------------- 
 
2.  (C) MOCA Department of Disaster and Socal Relief 
Director General Wang Zhenyao told oloff November 6 
that, from his experience heping to arrange three of 
Premier Wen Jiabao\'s recent trips to disaster areas, 
he has concluded that Wen\'s natural intellectual 
curiosity and impatience with standard bureaucratic 
practices make him a formidable traveler for whom to 
make arrangements.  Wang said Wen dislikes 
choreographed schedules and frequently deviates from 
the itinerary set by his aides.  Citing an example, 
Wang recalled that earlier this year in Shaanxi, Wen 
frequently ordered his driver to stop suddenly so that 
he could talk to villagers about their lives.  \"Wen 
does not chitchat in these conversations, but asks 
very specific questions about living standards,\" Wang 
said.  For example, Wen asked villagers about the 
amount of grain they harvested per unit of farmland, 
the cost of transporting their yield to market and the 
price they got per unit sold.  Wen does not want to 
hear only from the local Party leaders, who tend to 
gloss over blemishes, but from the peasants 
themselves, Wang offered. 
 
Itinerary Changes 
----------------- 
 
3.  (C) Such impulsiveness can be a \"headache\" for 
schedulers because Wen is constantly questioning his 
itinerary.  \"If you arrange for him to visit one 
village, he asks why he wasn\'t scheduled to visit 
another nearby village,\" Wang said.  According to 
Wang, Wen fears that he will hear \"prettified and 
filtered views\" on his trips, so he insists on 
injecting spontaneity into his travels. 
 
\"Let\'s Make a Deal\" 
------------------- 
 
4.  (C) To illustrate Wen\'s distaste for the common 
practice among Chinese officials of woodenly reading 
their work reports, Wang recounted an incident from 
Wen\'s travel to several central provinces last winter, 
while he was still a Vice Premier.  During this trip, 
which Wang also arranged, Wen listened to a local 
mayor drone on and on about his city\'s successful 
handling of emergencies.  According to Wang, Wen 
became so frustrated with the mayor\'s monotone 
presentation that the following exchange took place: 
\"Mr. Mayor, can you deliver your report without 
referring to your text,\" Wen asked.  \"Mr. Vice 
Premier, I refer to my manuscript because it contains 
a lot of statistics,\" the mayor replied.  \"Mr. Mayor, 
you have been an official in this city for several 
years now.  Surely you must have a command of the 
statistics that reflect how life is for the city\'s 
residents,\" Wen chastised.  \"I\'ll make you a deal,\" 
Wen continued. \"If you put away your text, then I\'ll 
put away mine when it is my turn to speak.\" 
Embarrassed, the mayor pushed his manuscript to the 
side, but continued to take frequent peeks when the 
Vice Premier was not looking, Wang wryly noted.  \"That 
poor mayor,\" Wang remarked.  \"It was the middle of 
winter yet he was perspiring through his shirt.\"  Wang 
stressed that Wen was very polite throughout the 
encounter and did not lose his cool. 
 
Simple Personal Needs 
--------------------- 
 
5.  (C) On the trips that Wang arranged for Wen, Wen\'s 
personal requirements were very simple.  He preferred 
to eat modestly and alone in his hotel room rather 
than take part in fancy banquets, which provincial 
officials would have gladly hosted, Wang recalled. 
The Minister of Civil Affairs, Li Xueju, whom Wang 
noted is close to Hu Jintao, accompanies Wen 
frequently on domestic trips and has relayed similar 
anecdotes about the Premier indicating that he is a 
focused and unpretentious traveler. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) Wang\'s view that the Premier is a detail- 
oriented taskmaster who has simple tastes tracks 
closely with the assessments of others in Beijing who 
have worked with the Premier.

SUBJECT: DECEMBER 9 MFA PRESS BRIEFING HIGHLIGHTS:  WEN\'S 
U.S. VISIT, SIX-PARTY TALKS, SINO-GERMAN PLUTONIUM 
REPROCESSING PLANT PURCHASE AND CIRF\'S POSTPONED VISIT 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  At the regular semi-weekly press briefing, MFA 
Spokesperson Liu Jianchao reported on statements made 
by Premier Wen Jiabao that the objective of his U.S. 
visit is to \"resolve problems\" in bilateral relations 
and not to \"engage in trade wars.\"  While asserting 
that common interests have \"outweighed\" disagreements 
between China and the United States, Liu called on 
Washington to \"adhere to its promises\" with regard to 
a \"one-China\" policy and to oppose Taiwan 
independence.  He remarked that the countries involved 
in the six-party talks on the DPRK nuclear issue have 
made \"positive statements\" aimed at promoting a 
peaceful resolution to the issue but that these 
countries should \"do more\" to continue the talks. 
Commenting on the reported German agreement to sell a 
plutonium reprocessing plant to China, Liu maintained 
that this project would improve the performance of 
China\'s nuclear power facilities and that the purpose 
of such a sale is non-military in nature.  He claimed 
that the U.S. Commission on International Religious 
Freedom (CIRF) postponed its visit to China because 
the group proposed \"an addition\" to the schedule that 
could not be accepted by both the PRC and the United 
States.  Israeli President Moshe Katzav will visit 
China from December 14-20, Liu announced.  End 
Summary. 
 
Wen\'s U.S. Visit 
---------------- 
 
2.  Questions on Premier Wen Jiabao\'s visit to the 
United States dominated the press briefing.  MFA 
Spokesperson Liu Jianchao reported that in a speech to 
members of the U.S. business community, Premier Wen 
asserted that U.S.-China trade relations have formed a 
strong basis for the development of bilateral ties. 
Wen stated that the two countries should handle trade 
matters, in particular the RMB revaluation issue, in a 
\"strategic way\" and should not allow such disputes to 
affect bilateral trade relations, according to Liu. 
Wen stressed that the objective of his U.S. visit is 
to \"resolve problems\" and not to \"engage in trade 
wars,\" Liu stated.  Wen met with UN Secretary General 
Kofi Annan and discussed UN reform, Iraq, the DPRK 
nuclear issue and the Middle East, Liu observed.  Wen 
plans to meet also with President Bush, Vice President 
Cheney, Congressional representatives and Federal 
Reserve Chairman Greenspan, Liu noted. 
 
3.  Queried by a CNN correspondent about the factors 
behind recent improvements in U.S.-China relations, 
Liu responded that common interests and cooperation in 
a number of areas, such as counterterrorism, AIDS and 
environmental protection, have \"outweighed\" 
differences between the two countries.  Beijing 
insists, nevertheless, that Washington \"adhere to its 
promises\" and maintain a \"clear stance\" with regard to 
a \"one-China\" policy, the three joint communiques and 
opposition to \"Taiwan independence.\"  Citing Wen\'s 
recent remarks on Taiwan, Liu said that China would 
make every effort to resolve the issue peacefully. 
 
Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
 
4.  Responding to a question from a China Daily 
reporter, Liu stated that the countries involved in 
the six-party talks on the DPRK nuclear issue have 
made \"positive statements\" aimed at promoting a 
peaceful resolution of the issue.  Beijing is making 
efforts to \"create conditions\" for \"substantive\" 
discussions during a second round of six-party talks, 
 
Liu asserted.  China has issued a proposal on 
convening a second round of six-party talks, and the 
United States, the ROK, Russia and Japan have 
expressed their views, he said, adding that these 
countries have different views on some issues and 
similar views on others.  Liu remarked, however, that 
setting up six-party talks is a \"complicated process\" 
and that participating countries should \"do more\" to 
promote a second round.  Asked by a Japanese reporter 
about dates for a econd round of talks, Liu replied 
that the dates depend on the course of preparations 
for the talks.  In response to a question from AFP, 
Liu confirmed that MFA Asian Affairs Department 
Director General Fu Ying met with an EU delegation in 
Beijing on December 8.  Noting that DG Fu briefed the 
delegation on preparations for a second round of six- 
party talks, Liu remarked that China supports the EU\'s 
role in promoting a resolution to the DPRK nuclear 
issue. 
 
Sino-German Deal on a Plutonium Processing Plant 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5.  Responding to questions from a German news 
correspondent on a reported German agreement to sell a 
plutonium reprocessing plant to China, Liu remarked 
that the issue has been \"exaggerated\" by the media. 
He stated that a Chinese company is negotiating with 
the German company Siemens to buy a plant designed to 
extract MOX, an \"oxide fuel used by nuclear power 
plants.\"  Stressing that over 30 countries use MOX in 
their production of nuclear power, Liu maintained that 
this project would improve the performance of China\'s 
nuclear power facilities and that the proposed deal is 
non-military in nature. 
 
CIRF Visit Postponed 
-------------------- 
 
6.  Asked by VOA about the reported postponement of a 
planned visit by the U.S. Commission on International 
Religious Freedom (CIRF), Liu responded that China 
welcomes the group\'s visit.  He alleged that prior to 
CIRF\'s departure, CIRF proposed \"an addition\" to the 
schedule.  Because the PRC and the United States could 
not agree on the final schedule, CIRF postponed its 
visit to China, Liu claimed.  Beijing \"regrets\" CIRF\'s 
decision, he concluded. 
 
Visit by Israeli President 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  Israeli President Moshe Katzav will visit China 
from December 14-20 at the invitation of President Hu 
Jintao, Liu announced.  Katzav will meet with 
President Hu, NPC Chairman Wu Bangguo and Premier Wen 
Jiabao and will also stop in Hong Kong, Liu noted.

Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Well-connected Xinhua News Agency official Yu 
Jiafu explained on December 16 that Chinese media were 
slow to report the significance of Premier Wen 
Jiabao\'s key U.S. meetings because substantive news 
articles had to be cleared by Wen himself.  The 
leadership is pleased with the Premier\'s U.S. visit, 
which is translating into relatively positive news 
coverage of the United States, at least for now.  Yu 
disclosed that State Council Taiwan Affairs officials 
Chen Yunlin and Zhou Mingwei are under heavy fire 
because of their perceived \"soft\" policy course on 
Taiwan and their failure to predict the outcome of 
Taiwan\'s referendum legislation issue.  Yu identified 
CPPCC Chair Jia Qinglin as a central player devising 
China\'s Taiwan policy.  He noted the recent formation 
of the Leading Group on Hong Kong in the aftermath of 
the July 1 demonstration.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) The head of International Affairs of the 
official Xinhua News Agency, Yu Jiafu (protect), told 
poloff on December 16 that the Chinese leadership is 
very pleased with the trip of Wen Jiabao to the United 
States.  As a result, the official media are being 
encouraged to reflect the current state of strong 
bilateral relations in their products.  Yu cited the 
Chinese media\'s treatment of Saddam Hussein\'s capture 
as an example the current Chinese propaganda line 
(reftel).  (Note: December 15 evening news broadcasts 
provided significantly greater straight news coverage 
of Saddam\'s capture than earlier reports.  The 
important 7:00 P.M. CCTV news program devoted 
approximately seven minutes of the half hour program 
to reports on Saddam, including coverage of 
congratulatory messages from around the world.  End 
Note.) 
 
3.  (C) Yu noted that media coverage of the Wen visit 
was low key compared to previous visits to the United 
States by senior leaders.  This was in accord with an 
order by senior leaders earlier this year to 
\"routinize\" stories about overseas trips, Yu 
explained.  This order was contained in the same 
document that put an end to grand departure ceremonies 
at the Great Hall of the People for traveling senior 
leaders.  Yu acknowledged that the Chinese media was 
slow to report information about Premier Wen\'s meeting 
with the President, particularly their discussions 
about Taiwan.  He attributed this to the \"clearance 
system\" for articles written about the senior 
leadership.  Following the White House meeting, Vice 
Foreign Minister Zhou Wenzhong gave the Chinese media 
a press background briefing.  After the briefing, the 
Xinhua reporter traveling with the party wrote his 
article and cleared it through several layers of 
delegation members.  Wen himself approved the final 
draft, Yu disclosed.  Nearly two days had elapsed by 
the time the Premier approved the official article. 
 
TAO Under Fire 
-------------- 
 
4.  (C) State Council Taiwan Affairs Office Director 
Chen Yunlin and Deputy Director Zhou Mingwei have been 
under fire from senior leaders for their \"mishandling\" 
of the cross-Strait situation, Yu revealed.  In 
addition to being criticized for their policy of \"soft 
responses\" to Chen Shui-bian\'s recent actions, Chen 
and Zhou have been taken to task for not predicting 
the Pan-Blue\'s shift on the referendum issue and the 
outcome of the Legislative Yuan\'s wrangling on the 
referendum law.  Yu noted that while Hu Jintao is the 
nominal chair of the Leading Group on Taiwan, the 
leading voice on cross-Strait affairs belongs to 
Politburo Standing Committee member Jia Qinglin.  As 
chair of the CPPCC, Jia oversees United Front work, 
much of which is Taiwan-related.  Yu predicted that 
Jia would become increasingly involved in the Taiwan 
issue in the coming months. 
 
Hong Kong: Continued Support for Tung 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Yu noted that senior leaders continue to be 
supportive of Hong Kong Chief Executive C.H. Tung and 
expected him to serve out his term, but recognize that 
he is flawed as a manager of Hong Kong\'s problems. 
During Tung\'s December 3 meetings in Beijing, Central 
Government leaders again emphasized to Tung that he 
should do a better job of \"representing the Hong Kong 
people,\" meaning that he should listen to the views of 
a broader array of the Hong Kong population. 
Interestingly, Yu continued, the Central Government 
made a commitment after the July 1 demonstration to 
better understand all segments of Hong Kong society, 
including political parties with whom Tung has had a 
strained relationship.  Through this outreach, the 
Central Government better understands that the 
Democrats represent a very complex array of issues, 
some of which are not necessarily inimical to 
Beijing\'s interests.  Yu predicted that Beijing would 
invite more senior representatives of the Democratic 
Party to Beijing for talks in the future.  Asked about 
democratization, Yu said that senior leaders are 
currently concerned about stability and expressed the 
view that the situation in Hong Kong would have to 
\"calm down\" further before the Central Government 
permitted movement toward universal suffrage. 
 
6.  (C) Yu alluded to the recent formation of the 
Leading Group on Hong Kong as a demonstration of the 
importance of the Hong Kong issue to Beijing.  Prior 
to July 1, the Hong Kong and Macau Work Committee 
(Gangao Gongwei) led by Hong Kong and Macau Office 
Director Liao Hui handled most of the Central 
Government\'s policy decisions on the HKSAR and MSAR. 
Following the demonstration, however, the Work 
Committee was elevated to the status of a Leading 
Group with Hu Jintao as its chair and Vice President 
Zeng Qinghong as the architect of policy.

Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Jon Aloisi. 
Reason: 1.4 (b), (d). 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Premier Wen Jiabao reiterated the \"people- 
centered\" approach of the new Chinese leadership in 
his report to China\'s legislature, the National 
People\'s Congress, on March 5.  With former President 
Jiang Zemin and the current leadership looking on, Wen 
highlighted the new government\'s victory over SARS, 
effectively underscoring the contrast of its approach 
with that of previous regimes.  Wen reaffirmed the 
government\'s seriousness in focusing on rural 
development, social investment and good governance, 
while at the same time continuing economic 
restructuring and maintaining GDP growth at seven 
percent.  Wen glossed over references to political 
restructuring, the Three Represents and military 
modernization, but drew prolonged applause from the 
audience for comments on planned elimination of 
agricultural taxes and hopes for Taiwan\'s early 
reunification with the \"motherland.\"  End Summary. 
 
NPC Stages Its Annual Opening Ceremony 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) China\'s legislature, the National People\'s 
Congress, which is technically China\'s highest organ 
of government, staged its annual opening at the Great 
Hall of the People on March 5.  While largely 
ceremonial, this year\'s NPC session gives China\'s new 
leaders an opportunity to further define their vision 
and agenda.  The 2,904 people\'s deputies, many hailing 
from China\'s distant provinces and some dressed in 
elaborate minority costumes, packed the main floor of 
the hall, along with a sizable People\'s Liberation 
Army (PLA) delegation.  CPPCC members joined 
journalists, diplomats and the PLA band in watching 
the proceedings from the upper decks. 
 
3.  (C) Protocol arrangements for the top leadership 
mirrored those for the CPPCC opening two days earlier. 
President Hu Jintao sat in the center seat, but walked 
in briskly behind a modestly shuffling Jiang Zemin. 
While Hu seemed alert and at ease, Jiang kept his head 
down for most of the session, even while the camera 
was trained on him.  The main event at the NPC 
opening, per tradition, was the delivery of the 
Government Work Report by Premier Wen Jiabao. 
 
Wen\'s Debut Work Report Sets a New Tone 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Wen\'s debut report retained the traditional 
format of reviewing achievements, acknowledging 
problems and outlining plans for the coming year.  The 
speech broke no new ground, reiterating 
accomplishments and policies previewedat last fall\'s 
Party plenum and subsequent wok conferences.  In 
keeping with the government\'s new development concept, 
however, this year\'s report devoted more attention to 
social and rural concerns and inefficient and corrupt 
government. 
 
5.  (C) Wen played to the crowd, raising his voice 
when discussing points he wanted to emphasize (anti- 
corruption, rural problems and Taiwan), and was 
rewarded several times with enthusiastic applause.  In 
contrast to the Three Represents-laden report by CPPCC 
Chair Jia Qinglin on March 3 (reftel), Wen\'s remarks 
glossed over the pro forma mentions of Jiang\'s 
theoretical contribution in favor of a more pragmatic 
tone. 
 
Beating SARS Trumps Growth in List of Achievements 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6.  (C) In touting the new government\'s achievements, 
Premier Wen juxtaposed China\'s victory over SARS with 
its strong overall economic performance in 2003 to 
underscore that the new leadership has shown that it 
can manage tough problems successfully.  His focus on 
the current government\'s determination to act \"in 
consideration of the people\'s vital interests.\" 
 
7.  (C) Wen went on to flag China\'s 9.1 percent GDP 
growth rate, attainment of the benchmark USD 1,000 
per-capita GDP level, and China\'s arrival as the 
world\'s fourth largest trading nation as hallmarks of 
China\'s and the new leadership\'s strong showing.  He 
also called attention to China\'s implementation of its 
WTO commitments, including cutting import tariffs and 
opening China\'s market further to foreign service 
providers, its welcoming attitude to foreign 
investment, and its determination to maintain a stable 
exchange rate for the RMB.  The launch of the 
Shenzhou-5 space capsule, which was highly publicized 
late last year, was mentioned only in passing. 
 
People-Centered Policies 
------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) As expected, Wen used his speech to emphasize 
the \"people-centered\" approach (yi ren wei ben) of the 
new government.  He noted efforts over the past year 
to improve the public health system, rural education 
and the administration of social security.  Progress 
in job creation and measures to assist vagrants and 
beggars (e.g., the elimination of the custody and 
repatriation system) also garnered specific mention. 
 
9.  (C) Before setting out work goals for 2004, Wen 
highlighted critical policy problems facing the 
leadership.  He cited slow growth of rural incomes, 
lack of an effective social security system, job 
creation, and unbalanced development as the most 
serious concerns.  A second set of problems associated 
with China\'s rapid but distorted approach to economic 
growth included environmental degradation, excessive 
and wasteful investment (especially in construction), 
illegal appropriation of farm land, declining grain 
production and the high cost of education and medical 
treatment. 
 
10.  (C) Wen reserved his harshest words for \"some 
government officials,\" who are \"subjective, 
formalistic, wasteful, extravagant, fraudulent, and 
even corrupt,\" noting that the government faces an 
arduous task in fighting corruption.  (Note: 
Interestingly, Wen\'s energetic presentation failed to 
elicit even a murmur of applause from the audience of 
officials.)  In summing up, Wen said the government 
should face \"new tests\" with a \"new outlook\" and \"new 
work style\" and \"must not fail to live up to the 
expectations of the people.\" 
 
Looking Ahead: Balanced Development 
----------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) In 2004, consistent with a scientific 
economic development approach (kexue fazhan guan), Wen 
noted that the government will attempt to improve 
macroeconomic management, reduce economic imbalances 
and address those problems that affect the concrete 
interests of the people.  He envisioned stable 
economic growth at seven percent, a pace that the 
leadership considers consistent with efficient and 
sustainable growth.  This, he said, will require 
forward thinking micro policy adjustments, which will 
enable China to maintain appropriately tight or loose 
policy stances without having to resort to \"stepping 
on the brakes\".  Contrary to an asserted intent for 
the government to rely on market based management 
tools and legal strictures, Wen threatened to use 
administrative measures when necessary to block 
unwanted investments through the use of central 
approval authority and across the board bans on 
rezoning of land or loans to \"unapproved\" investment 
projects. 
 
Dealing with Rural Problems 
--------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) Wen reiterated the central government\'s 
position that dealing with rural problems is its first 
priority.  The government will do this through direct 
measures that will strengthen, support and protect the 
rural sector with the goal of raising rural incomes. 
Aside from strengthening efforts to prevent illegal 
expropriation of farm land, Wen said the government 
will support grain production in core grain growing 
regions, eliminate the specialized agricultural 
products tax and cut the general agricultural tax one 
percentage point per year, eliminating it completely 
by 2007 and increasing central government fiscal 
transfers to rural areas.  The grain market will be 
totally market based in 2004, Wen said, and the 
government will provide RMB 10 billion in direct 
subsidies to gain farmers. 
 
Unequal Funding for Regional Development 
---------------------------------------- 
 
13.  (C) Wen called for more balanced regional 
economic development, while noting that some regions 
obviously will do better than others.  While all 
regions are encouraged to develop, he cautioned the 
western areas to continue implementing environmentally 
friendly policies that will cut back on logging, 
farming, and cattle raising, all to the detriment of 
rural incomes.  Some funding, however, will be made 
available to improve basic education in these areas. 
Central Chinese provinces are likewise given verbal 
encouragement, but no promises of funding support. 
What support these two regions will receive will come 
from informal transfers or investments from \"sister\" 
eastern provinces.  Central Government fiscal support 
in the coming year will be very focused on the 
Northeast, where many SOE restructuring projects will 
be funded, Wen indicated. 
 
Democratization Paired with Stability Concerns 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
14.  (C) Far down the list of priorities for the 
coming year were political restructuring, public 
security and safety and defense modernization.  While 
Wen mentioned improving the legal system and 
\"expanding democracy at the lowest levels of 
government,\" the topic was given fairly short shrift. 
Priority areas for new legislation were listed as 
emergency management, rights of farmers, and social 
security issues.  Wen alluded several times during the 
report to the need to handle \"challenges to internal 
stability\" and mentioned anti-terrorism and anti-cult 
efforts on the part of the security forces.  He also 
touched on military modernization, noting the need to 
improve effectiveness of defense modernization efforts 
and balance defense needs with economic growth. 
 
Improved Governance and Anti-Corruption 
--------------------------------------- 
 
15.  (C) After already speaking for 90 minutes, Wen 
adopted a more aggressive, lecturing tone for a 
section on improving governance.  Advocating 
scientific and democratic decision-making, 
transparency and strict adherence to the law, Wen also 
spoke of the need for oversight of government by the 
media and general public.  In keeping with recently 
published Party discipline guidelines, he condemned 
\"vanity projects,\" wastefulness, false reporting, 
arrogance and other common sins of Chinese cadres. 
 
Crowd Reacts to Taiwan Remarks 
------------------------------ 
 
16.  (C) Wen\'s closing remarks included standard 
comments on upholding the principles governing the 
administration of Hong Kong and Macau, calling for 
strict observance of the Basic Law and support for SAR 
chief executives and governments.  His subsequent, 
well-worn slogans regarding Taiwan and hopes for quick 
reunification were greeted by prolonged applause from 
the delegates. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
17.  (C) Wen\'s speech contained no surprises.  His 
report continues the public promotion and emphasis of 
the new government\'s shift in priorities and its 
people-centered image.  While the document lays down a 
clear marker on commitment to reform, it also hints at 
continuing controversy over policy direction and 
vision in a number of areas.  For example, after 
strongly advocating use of market-based mechanisms for 
economic policy adjustments, Wen retreats by noting 
the government\'s willingness to rely on administrative 
measures that recall old-style planned economy 
approaches.  This points up the ongoing compromises 
that characterize the process of China\'s economic 
transition.  As a political document, Wen\'s report 
indirectly highlights the distinctions between the new 
leadership and the past administration.  In contrast 
to Jia Qinglin\'s CPPCC opening presentation, the 
obsequious overemphasis on Jiang Zemin\'s Three 
Represents was noticeably lacking.

Ref:  A) Beijing 6973   B) Beijing 7059   C) Beijing 7060 
 
1.  (U)  Summary:  Premier Wen Jiabao met with Deputy 
Undersecretary for Labor Affairs Arnold Levine, Special 
Representative of Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, and with 
Labor Ministers attending the China Employment Forum.  D/US 
Levine met with Ministry of Labor and Cooperation Director 
for International Cooperation Liu Xu, and with Administrator 
of the State Administration for Work Safety (SAWS) Wang 
Xianzheng.  End Summary. 
 
2.  D/US for International Labor Affairs Arnold Levine, 
representing Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, and labor 
ministers from 26 countries attending the China Employment 
Forum, met April 29 with China\'s Premier Wen Jiabao.  The 
Premier opened his remarks by quoting \"the first President 
of the United States\" for the proposition that \"the 
impoverished have no freedom.\"  Expanding on that theme, he 
noted that China has now changed to a development strategy 
that puts people first.  He emphasized the size of the 
challenge, especially that of finding jobs for the 100 
million migrant workers flooding the cities.  China must 
create 10 million jobs per year, he said. 
 
3.  Earlier the same day, D/US Levine met with Ministry of 
Labor and Social Security Director General for Bilateral 
Affairs Liu Xu.  D/US Levine reconfirmed the offer made to 
Vice Minister Bu to broaden and deepen cooperation on labor 
issues, and noted that he would convey the invitation to 
visit China to Secretary Chao.  DG Xu thanked D/US Levine 
for informing him, and said he would convey the news 
immediately to his Minister.  He called the decision an 
important one for the relationship between the two 
governments, and for the relationship between the two 
departments.  D/US Levine briefly introduced the possibility 
of funding a China HIV-AIDS in the Workplace program through 
the ILO in the amount of approximately USD 3 million.  He 
noted that DOL intends to work with the MOLSS as lead 
agency, and welcomed collaboration with the Ministry of 
Health as well. 
 
4.  Also on April 29, D/US Levine met with Administrator of 
the State Administration for Work Safety (SAWS) Wang 
Xianzheng, and with Bai Ran, Director, National Center for 
International Exchange and Cooperation (NCIEC), a non- 
governmental organization associated with the State 
Administration for Work Safety.  Administrator Wang thanked 
D/US Levine for the visit two years ago of Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety David Lauritsky, and for 
assistance given to the Ministry in improving its mine 
rescue skills through participation in the mine rescue 
competition.  D/US Levine noted that Administrator Wang will 
travel to the United States in May, and that A/S Lauritsky 
plans to travel to China in June. 
 
5.  The Chinese government has always paid great attention 
to the safety and health of its workers, and the new 
government has increased that attention because of its 
attention to the human aspects of development, the 
Administrator said.  That morning, Wang told Levine, he had 
attended a meeting chaired by Vice Premier Wu Yi.  She told 
the group that the rapid increase in GDP had also had an 
impact on work safety, in part because of insufficient 
management and training.  China hopes to learn from the 
experience of the United States in workplace safety and 
health.  He noted that it will take time for China to 
develop its workplace health and safety programs and 
capabilities.  The new leadership has begun to shift 
emphasis from reducing fatalities to improving occupational 
health, Wang said.  To realize fundamental change, China 
must learn from the experience of other countries, he said. 
In addition, China must improve the safety awareness of 
workers, rely on science and technology to improve 
equipment, and improve the legal system for work safety. 
Within the last several years, SAWS has engaged in 
cooperative projects with 20 countries to improve workplace 
safety and health. 
 
6.  D/US Levine told Administrator Wang that Secretary of 
Labor Elaine Chao had designated him to explore broader, 
deeper cooperation with China in labor-related areas.  He 
told the Administrator that he hopes to explore with SAWS 
the possibility of expanded cooperation in the area of 
occupational safety and health.  In a slide presentation 
NCIEC Director Bai told D/US Levine about cooperation 
projects with Japan, Germany, and the International Labor 
Organization. 
 
7.  This cable was cleared by the Department of Labor 
delegation before leaving Beijing.
