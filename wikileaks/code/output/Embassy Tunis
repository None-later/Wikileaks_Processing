2. LOCAL AND FOREIGN REACTION TO ZINE EL ABIDINE BEN 
ALI\'S APPOINTMENT AS PRIME MINISTER IS GENERALLY 
POSITIVE.  AT HOME, HE IS RESPECTED AS A COMPETENT 
HARD-WORKER SOMEWHAT ALOOF FROM THE USUAL POLITICAL 
SQUABBLES.  HIS MILITARY BACKGROUND AND TENURE AT THE 
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR, HOWEVER, LEAD MANY TUNISIANS TO 
SUSPECT A HARDENING OF GOT\'S POSITION VIS-A-VIS 
DISSENT, AN IMPRESSION THAT BEN ALI\'S INITIAL 
STATEMENT AND RECENT EDITORIALS BASED ON THAT 
STATEMENT HAVE TAKEN PAINS TO DISPEL.  THE FOREIGN 
MEDIA, INCLUDING SUCH CRITICS OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
IN TUNISIA AS \"LE MONDE\", HAVE SPOKEN FAVORABLY OF 
HIS APPOINTMENT.  CHARACTERIZING BEN ALI AS A \"STRONG 
MAN\", LE MONDE OPINED THAT BEN ALI IS THE RIGHT MAN 
FOR THE JOB AT THIS TIME.  GOT SEEMS PARTICULARLY 
GRATIFIED BY THIS ENDORSEMENT FROM THE FOREIGN MEDIA 
AND HAS GIVEN IT PROMINENT COVERAGE. 
 
3. ZINE EL ABIDINE BEN ALI WAS BORN AT HAMMAM SOUSSE, 
A SMALL TOWN NEAR PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA\'S BIRTHPLACE OF 
MONASTIR, ON 3 SEPTEMBER 1936.  HE STUDIED AT THE 
MILITARY ACADEMY OF SAINT-CYR AND THE ARTILLERY 
SCHOOL IN CHALONS SUR-MARNE IN FRANCE AND TOOK THE 
SENIOR FOREIGN OFFICERS INTELLIGENCE COURSE AT FORT 
HOLABIRD, MARYLAND, AND AN ARTILLERY COURSE AT FORT 
BLISS, TEXAS.  HE BECAME DIRECTOR OF MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE IN 1958, A POSITION HE HELD FOR 16 YEARS 
UNDER FOUR DIFFERENT DEFENSE MINISTERS.  IN 1974, BEN 
ALI WAS SENT AS MILITARY ATTACHE TO RABAT.  ACCORDING 
TO JEUNE AFRIQUE, THIS APPOINTMENT RESULTED FROM 
PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA\'S SUSPICIONS WHEN BEN ALI\'S NAME 
APPEARED ON A LIST OF PROJECTED APPOINTMENTS 
RESULTING FROM THE STILL-BORN TUNISIAN/LIBYAN UNION 
AGREEMENT.  KNOWN FOR HIS DISCIPLINE AND COMPETENCE, 
BEN ALI WAS CALLED BACK TO TUNIS TO RUN THE BUREAU OF 
NATIONAL SECURITY (SURETE NATIONALE) JUST BEFORE 
LABOR STRIFE CULMINATED IN GOT\'S VIOLENT CRACKDOWN OF 
THE GENERAL STRIKE OF 1978.  IN 1980 HE REPORTEDLY 
RAN AFOUL OF MRS. WASSILA BOURGUIBA AND WAS SENT AWAY 
TO BECOME AMBASSADOR TO POLAND.  IN THE AFTERMATH OF 
THE VIOLENT BREAD RIOTS OF 1984, BEN ALI WAS RECALLED 
TO THE DIRECTORSHIP OF NATIONAL SECURITY.  ON 28 
APRIL, HE WAS NAMED MINISTER OF INTERIOR AND IN 
MID-MAY WAS PROMOTED TO MINISTER OF STATE. 
 
4.  WHILE HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCE IS SOMEWHAT AUSTERE, 
BEN ALI IN PRIVATE DISPOSES OF CONSIDERABLE CHARM AND 
RADIATES CONFIDENCE.  IN RECENT MONTHS, HE HAS 
INCREASINGLY BEEN CALLED UPON TO EXPLAIN GOT SECURITY 
POLICY IN PUBLIC MEETINGS AND WITH THE FOREIGN PRESS 
AND HANDLED THESE SITUATIONS WELL.  HE HAS LITTLE 
EXPERIENCE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND ECONOMICS, AND WILL 
HAVE TO RELY ON HIS MINISTERIAL COLLEAGUES IN THESE 
AREAS AT LEAST INITIALLY.  HIS TENDENCY FOR 
MICRO-MANAGEMENT OF THE SECURITY SERVICE MUST ALSO 
CHANGE AS INDICATED BY THE APPOINTMENT OF MOHAMED 
KARBOUL, A CAREER INTERIOR MINISTRY OFFICIAL, AS 
DIRECTOR GENERAL OF NATIONAL SECURITY OCTOBER 6. 
 
--------------- 
MAHJOUB BEN ALI 
--------------- 
 
5.  MAHJOUB BEN ALI, THE NEW DESTOURIAN SOCIALIST 
PARTY (PSD) CHIEF, IS THE MOST PROMINENT OF FIVE OR 
SIX HARDLINERS THAT PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA HAS CALLED 
BACK TO SERVICE IN THE RECENT MONTHS.  REACTION TO 
MAHJOUB\'S APPOINTMENT IS GENERALLY NEGATIVE.  THE 
EDUCATED ELITE IN PARTICULAR HAVE A LOW OPINION OF 
HIM.  THEY SNEER AT HIS LACK OF FORMAL EDUCATION AND 
DEEM HIM RIGID AND NARROW-MINDED. 
 
6.  MAHJOUB BEN ALI, 62, WAS BORN IN BIZERTE.  IN 
1952 HE WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF ORGANIZING 
PRE-INDEPENDENCE RESISTANCE TO THE FRENCH IN THE 
NORTH AND BECAME A PRINCIPAL LEADER OF THE RESISTANCE 
MOVEMENT.  MAHJOUB LED THE GUERILLA ATTACK ON A 
BUSLOAD OF FRENCH CIVILIANS IN 1952 THAT BOURGUIBA 
CREDITS WITH SHAKING FRANCE OUT OF ITS COMPLACENCY 
ABOUT TUNISIA.  HE LED THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM 1956 
UNTIL 1967 WHEN HE WAS DISMISSED FOR FAILING TO 
CONTROL ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE WAKE OF 
THE 6 DAY WAR.  HE THEN OCCUPIED A NUMBER OF LESSER 
POSITIONS WHERE HE EARNED A REPUTATION FOR 
HEAVY-HANDEDNESS.  IN THE WAKE OF THE BOMBINGS AT THE 
TOURIST HOTELS LAST AUGUST, HE WAS APPOINTED DEPUTY 
DIRECTOR OF THE PSD IN CHARGE OF THE VIGILANCE 
COMMITTEES.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  BOURGUIBA\'S ABRUPT DISMISSAL OF SFAR AND 
ELEVATION OF INTERIOR MINISTER BEN ALI AGAIN 
DEMONSTRATES PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA\'S PERSONAL CONTROL 
OF POWER IN TUNISIA.  BEN ALI\'S APPOINTMENT PUTS A 
STRONG MAN IN THE PRIME MINISTRY AND A HEARTBEAT AWAY 
FROM THE PRESIDENCY.  IN GOVERNING, BEN ALI WILL HAVE 
SUPPORT FROM SOCIAL AFFAIRS MINISTER BACCOUCHE, CHIEF 
OF STAFF BARKETT AND PRESIDENTIAL COMPANION SAIDA 
SASSI.  ON THE OTHER HAND, BEN ALI WILL PROBABLY BE 
AT ODDS WITH PSD DIRECTOR MAHJOUB BEN ALI.  BEN ALI\'S 
RAPPORT WITH EDUCATION MINISTER SAYAH DESERVES 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION.  ADDITIONAL CABINET CHANGES ARE 
WIDELY RUMORED--THE ECONOMIC MINISTRIES, JUSTICE, AND 
POSSIBLY DEFENSE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  BEN ALI\'S MOST 
DRAMATIC POLICY SIGNAL HAS BEEN A CALL FOR 
RESPONSIBLE DIALOGUE AND DIRECT CONTACT WHICH WAS 
FOLLOWED UP BY MEETINGS WITH HUMAN RIGHTS LEADERS. 
U.S. INTERESTS ARE WELL SERVED BY BEN ALI\'S 
APPOINTMENT SINCE IT WILL ENHANCE STABILITY IN THE 
NEAR AND LONGER TERM.  WHILE HE IS NOT \"AMERICA\'S 
MAN,\"  HE CARRIES NO IDEOLOGICAL BAGGAGE WHICH WOULD 
IMPEDE CLOSE WORKING RELATIONS.  U.S. INTERESTS ARE 
ALSO SERVED BY BEN ALI\'S TENTATIVE OPENING TO CRITICS 
WHICH SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------- 
BOURGUIBA MAINTAINS CONTROL 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (NO FORN) - PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA HAS AGAIN 
DEMONSTRATED HIS PERSONAL CONTROL OF TUNISIAN 
POLITICS BY ABRUPTLY DISMISSING RACHID SFAR AND 
ELEVATING PRIME MINISTER BEN ALI (REFTEL) TO THE 
PRIME MINISTRY.  SFAR\'S DISMISSAL WAS EXPLAINED LAST 
WEEK AS A RESULT OF PRESIDENTIAL DISSATISFACTION WITH 
THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER\'S ATTEMPT TO DESIGNATE HIS 
CANDIDATE, ABDELMALEK AL \'ARIF, AS DIRECTOR OF THE 
RULING DESTOURIAN SOCIALIST PARTY (PSD).  THAT 
EXPLANATION HAS GAINED CREDIBILITY BY THE SUBSEQUENT 
REPORT IN A LEADING NEWSPAPER THAT BOURGUIBA AND SFAR 
FIRST CLASHED OVER APPOINTMENTS SEPT. 10 WHEN SFAR 
PROPOSED AL \'ARIF AS MINISTER OF INFORMATION, ONLY TO 
HAVE THE PRESIDENT OVERRULE HIM AND APPOINT 
ABDELWAHAB ABDULLAH TO THAT POST.  A SIRO SOURCE 
REPORTED THAT BOURGUIBA PROPOSED THE PRIME MINISTRY 
TO BEN ALI SEPT. 13 BUT THE LATTER RECOMMENDED THE 
CHANGE TAKE PLACE AFTER THE MTI TRIAL WHICH CONCLUDED 
SEPT. 27.  NEVERTHELESS, THE CHANGE ITSELF WAS 
HANDLED CLUMSILY WITH THE PRESIDENT PLACING HIMSELF 
IN THE EMBARRASSING POSITION OF APPROVING HIGH-LEVEL 
APPOINTMENTS ONE DAY--I.E PARTY CHIEF, MINISTER OF 
CULTURE ETC.--ONLY TO RETRACT THEM THE NEXT.  BY 
SEVERAL RELIABLE ACCOUNTS, THE PRESIDENT WAS ALSO 
EXTRAORDINARILY ABUSIVE TO FORMER PRIME MINISTER 
SFAR, AT THE CABINET MEETING SEPT. 30, WHO PROTESTED 
ALL ALONG THAT HE HAD ACTED WITH PRESIDENTIAL 
APPROVAL.  HENCE, THE PRESIDENT HAS SIMULTANEOUSLY 
REASSERTED PRESIDENTIAL PREROGATIVES WHILE RAISING 
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS GRIP ON EVENTS. 
 
4.  LIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, BEN ALI\'S RAPPORT WITH THE 
PRESIDENT WILL BE A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN HIS ABILITY TO 
GOVERN.  ON SECURITY ISSUES, HE HAS SHOWN A DEFT 
TOUCH -- E.G. OPPOSING THE CREATION OF MTI MARTYRS 
WITHOUT LOOSING CREDIBILITY.  BEN ALI\'S FIRST 
OFFICIAL STATEMENT CAREFULLY ACKNOWLEDGED 
PRESIDENTIAL PREROGATIVES AND CHARACTERIZED THE PRIME 
MINISTER AS FIRST AMONG EQUALS IN SERVING THE 
PRESIDENT. 
 
---------------------------- 
A STRONGMAN A HEARTBEAT AWAY 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  UNLIKE SFAR, BEN ALI IS NOT VIEWED AS A 
TRANSITIONAL FIGURE.  ANY PRIME MINISTER SERVES AT 
THE PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT AND BOURGUIBA HAS NEVER 
TOLERATED A TRULY POWERFUL PRIME MINISTER IN THE 
PAST.  NEVERTHELESS BEN ALI\'S TENURE IS MORE SECURE 
THAN HIS PREDECESSOR\'S BECAUSE HE IS A PILLAR OF 
TUNISIA\'S INTERNAL SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT -- NOT 
IRREPLACEABLE, BUT NOT EASILY REPLACED.  WITH BEN 
ALI\'S APPOINTMENT, THE ENTIRE SUCCESSION PICTURE HAS 
OBVIOUSLY CHANGED.  INSTEAD OF A WEAK PROSPECTIVE 
PRESIDENT WHO WOULD HAVE INVITED CHALLENGES FROM 
POLITICAL OPPONENTS, THERE IS A STRONG AND VIGOROUS 
SUCCESSOR.  WHATEVER ELSE HAPPENS, THE INTERNAL 
SECURITY SITUATION IS NOT LIKELY TO GET OUT OF HAND 
AS LONG AS THERE IS NO OPEN SPLIT IN THE RULING 
ESTABLISHMENT. 
 
------ 
ALLIES 
------ 
 
4. BEN ALI\'S ALLIES IN THE GOVERNMENT ARE STRONG AND 
WELL PLACED.  FIRST AND FOREMOST IS SOCIAL AFFAIRS 
MINISTER BACCOUCHE WHO ALSO COMES FROM HAMMAM SOUSSE 
AND IS AN OLD PERSONAL FRIEND.  BACCOUCHE IS PRESUMED 
TO BE BEN ALI\'S PRIMARY POLITICAL ADVISOR.  AN ADROIT 
POLITICIAN, BACCOUCHE WAS PSD DIRECTOR (1983-86) AND 
IS CURRENTLY MANAGING TUNISIA\'S NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
LIBYA AND THEIR IMPACT ON HER RELATIONS WITH ALGERIA 
AND MOROCCO.  BACCOUCHE\'S MAJOR LIABILITY IS THE 
PRESIDENT\'S ANTIPATHY FOR HIM WHICH STEMS IN PART AT 
LEAST FROM BACCOUCHE\'S INDEPENDENT ATTITUDE AS PARTY 
DIRECTOR.  SECOND, CHIEF OF STAFF BARKETT THINKS 
HIGHLY OF BEN ALI AND HAS MAINTAINED REGULAR 
CONTACT.  INDEED, BARKETT WAS THE ONLY SENIOR 
MILITARY FIGURE WHO FAILED TO ATTEND A DINNER AT THE 
FRENCH EMBASSY ON THE EVE OF THE GOVERNMENT CHANGE, 
WHICH HAS PRODUCED SPECULATION THAT HE ALONE IN THE 
DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT WAS INFORMED AND CONSULTED BY 
BEN ALI IN ADVANCE.  THIRD, PRESIDENTIAL COMPANION 
SAIDA SASSI WAS OBSERVED AS AN ALMOST DAILY VISITOR 
TO THE INTERIOR MINISTRY IN RECENT WEEKS.  SHE HAS 
EVEN PLACED PHONE CALLS FROM BEN ALI\'S OFFICE.  BY 
SEVERAL ACCOUNTS, BEN ALI SUCCEEDED IN CONVINCING 
SASSI TO COUNSEL MODERATION TO THE PRESIDENT IN THE 
MTI TRIAL.  THE BEN ALI-SASSI CONNECTION DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO BE DEEPLY ROOTED AND MAY NOT ENDURE. 
 
----------- 
ADVERSARIES 
----------- 
 
6. BEN ALI HAS GENERALLY NOT ENGENDERED PERSONAL 
ANTIMOSITY.  NEVERTHELESS, HE HAS POLITICAL RIVALS 
AND PERSONAL ANTIPATHIES. THE NEW PSD DIRECTOR 
MAHJOUB BEN ALI IS THOUGHT TO BE ON A TOTALLY 
DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH THAN THE PRIME MINISTER.  PRIME 
MINISTER BEN ALI IS MORE SUBTLE AND SEES THE NUANCES 
OF A SITUATION.  PSD DIRECTOR BEN ALI IS A BLUNT 
INSTRUMENT.  MOREOVER, THE PSD\'S NEWLY RE-ACTIVATED 
MILITIA\'S ARE HELD IN CONTEMPT BY THE PROFESSIONAL 
SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT AND THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
SEVERAL RELATIVELY MINOR CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE 
TWO GROUPS.  PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA PRESUMABLY 
RECOGNIZED THE INCOMPATIBILITY AND NAMED MAHJOUB IN 
PART AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE NEW PRIME MINISTER. 
PRIME MINISTER BEN ALI ALSO REPORTEDLY DISLIKES 
MINISTER OF TRANSPORT, HOUSING AND EQUIPMENT SKHIRI 
WHO HIMSELF ALMOST CERTAINLY ASPIRED TO HEAD THE 
GOVERNMENT.  SKHIRI HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH 
CORRUPTION IN THE PAST AND HAS REPORTEDLY MISMANAGED 
HIS MINISTRY SO HE IS NOT IN A PARTICULARLY STRONG 
POSITION.  EDUCATION MINISTER SAYAH WOULD BE A MUCH 
MORE FORMIDABLE ADVERSARY GIVEN HIS PERSONAL RAPPORT 
WITH THE PRESIDENT (HE IS BOURGUIBA\'S BIOGRAPHER) AND 
DEEP AND WIDE PARTY CONNECTIONS.  BECAUSE OF HIS 
POLITICAL SKILLS, SAYAH WAS FOR MANY THE LEADING 
CANDIDATE TO SUCCEED SFAR AND EVENTUALLY THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF.  HE NOW FINDS A FORMIDABLE 
OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF THOSE AMBITIONS.  SAYAH\'S ONLY 
HINT OF DISATISFACTION THUS FAR WAS A PUBLIC COMMENT 
PRIOR TO THE GOVERNMENT CHANGE TO THE EFFECT THAT 
TUNISIA HAS BEEN AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE LEAD BY 
CIVILIANS -- A POSSIBLE REFERENCE TO BEN ALI\'S 
MILITARY BACKGROUND.  THE SAYAH-BEN ALI RELATIONSHIP 
BEARS WATCHING. 
 
--------------------- 
MORE CABINET CHANGES? 
--------------------- 
 
7.  SINCE BEN ALI\'S APPOINTMENT, TUNIS\' RUMOR MILLS 
HAVE BEEN WORKING OVERTIME AND FURTHER CABINET 
CHANGES ARE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY EXPECTED.  MUCH OF THE 
SPECULATIONS HAS FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMIC MINISTRIES. 
THE PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY MADE A SLIGHTING REMARK IN 
THE SEPT. 30 CABINET MEETING ABOUT MINISTER OF PLAN 
KHELIL\'S FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE U.S.  (HE HAS BEEN IN 
WASHINGTON FOR IMF MEETINGS.)  BEN ALI, WHOSE 
ECONOMIC EXPERIENCE IS NIL, IS ALSO PERCEIVED TO NEED 
HELP PARTICULARLY IN THIS DOMAIN.  JUSTICE MINISTER 
AYARI IS ALSO THOUGHT TO BE BURNT OUT.  MOREOVER, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS REPORTEDLY NOT PLEASED WITH THE COURSE 
OF THE MTI TRIAL.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S 
DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE PRESIDENT EARLIER THIS SUMMER 
AND TOTAL EXCLUSION FROM RECENT MAGHREB DIPLOMACY 
HAVE ALSO RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS STATUS.  DEFENSE 
MINISTER BALY\'S NAME IS ALSO MENTIONED AS SOMEONE WHO 
MIGHT BE CHANGED TO BRING NEW BLOOD INTO THE GOT. 
ONE LEADING CANDIDATE FOR A MINISTRY IS TUNISIA\'S 
AMBASSADOR TO BONN BEJI CAID ESSEBSI, A FORMER 
MINISTER OF INTERIOR AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS, WHO HAD 
BEEN IN TUNIS THIS PAST WEEK AND IS EXPECTED BACK 
LATER THIS WEEK.  UN PERMREP MESTIRI HAS ALSO BEEN 
MENTIONED AS A CANDIDATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
POLICY CHANGES: DIALOGUE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS LEADERS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8. BEN ALI\'S ONE CLEAR POLICY INITIATIVE HAS BEEN A 
SLIGHT OPENING TO THE REGIME\'S CRITICS.  IN HIS 
INITIAL POLICY STATEMENT AS PRIME MINISTER, HE CALLED 
FOR \"A REINFORCEMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY BASED ON 
BOURGUIBIAN PRINCIPLES OF DIRECT CONTACT, RESPONSIBLE 
DIALOGUE AND CONCORD TO SERVE TUNISIA\'S HIGHER 
INTERESTS AND TO SAFEGUARD TUNISIA\'S STABILITY AND 
INVULNERABILITY.\"  SUBSEQUENTLY, HE MET ON OCT. 6 IN 
SEPARATE AND HIGHLY-PUBLICIZED MEETINGS WITH THE 
LEADERS OF THE INDEPENDENT TUNISIAN HUMAN RIGHTS 
LEAGUE AND GOT-CONTROLLED ASSOCIATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
AND PUBLIC LIBERTIES.  THESE GESTURES HAVE BEEN WELL 
RECEIVED.  OPPOSITION POLITICIANS WITH WHOM BEN ALI 
MAINTAINED CONTACTS AS INTERIOR MINISTER ARE NO DOUBT 
HOPING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER\'S ATTENTION WILL 
EVENTUALLY EXTEND TO THEM.  IF SO, IT WILL BE A 
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT. 
 
-------------- 
U.S. INTERESTS 
-------------- 
 
9.  U.S. INTERESTS ARE WELL SERVED BY BEN ALI\'S 
APPOINTMENT.  IN THE NEAR TERM, IT ENHANCES STABILITY 
AT A TIME WHEN THE MTI CHALLENGE HAS BEEN BLUNTED, 
BUT NOT RESOLVED AND WHEN TUNISIA IS MOVING TOWARD A 
MORE NORMAL AND OPEN RELATIONSHIP WITH LIBYA.  IN THE 
LONGER TERM, SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN TO THE PRESIDENT, 
BEN ALI WOULD BE ALMOST THE IDEAL PERSON TO MAINTAIN 
ORDER IN THE TRANSITION.  HE IS NOT \"AMERICA\'S MAN\" 
-- A WIDELY HELD PERCEPTION IN TUNIS BASED ON BEN 
ALI\'S REPUTATION FOR \"LAW AND ORDER\" AND HIS LIMITED 
STUDY AS A SOLDIER IN THE U.S.  RATHER HE IS 
DISTINCTLY NON-IDEOLOGICAL.  NEVERTHELESS, THE 
ABSENCE OF INTELLECTUAL BAGGAGE--I.E. MZALI\'S 
AMBITION TO BRING TUNISIA CLOSER TO THE ARAB WORLD, 
FOREIGN MINISTER MABROUK\'S FRANCOPHILIA, ETC. -- IS 
AN ADVANTAGE AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED.  ALSO IN 
U.S. INTERESTS IS BEN ALI\'S TENTATIVE OPENING TO THE 
REGIME\'S CRITICS.  AT A MINIMUM, HE HAS ENDORSED THE 
LEGITIMACY OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVITY IN TUNISIA. 
WHETHER HE PROCEEDS FARTHER TOWARD POLITICAL 
PLURALISM WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS -- PRINCIPALLY 
THE PRESIDENT\'S ACQUIESCENCE OR RESISTANCE.  IT IS A 
TENDENCY, HOWEVER, THAT THE U.S. SHOULD ENCOURAGE.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  IN ITS FIRST RAMADAN SINCE COMING TO POWER LAST 
FALL, THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS BROKEN WITH THE 
SECULARISM OF THE PREVIOUS REGIME AND ACTIVELY 
PROMOTED RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES.  IN DOING SO, HOWEVER, 
IT HAS ENCOURAGED TOLERANCE OF NON-FASTING MOSLEMS 
AND TOURISTS.  GOT\'S MEASURES CREATED AN 
UNPRECEDENTED ESPRIT DE CORPS AMONG TUNISIANS WHO 
OBSERVED THE HOLY MONTH.  THE PROMOTION OF SUCH 
RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES REFLECTS NOT ONLY PIETY, BUT 
ALSO A DESIRE TO STEAL THE THUNDER FROM ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------- 
GOT PROMOTES RAMADAN 
-------------------- 
 
3. PRESIDENT ZINE EL ABIDINE BEN ALI AND HIS 
GOVERNMENT HAVE BROKEN WITH THE PREVIOUS REGIME\'S 
SECULAR APPROACH TO RAMADAN.  UNDER BOURGUIBA, GOT\'S 
OFFICIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE HOLY MONTH WAS AT BEST 
NEUTRAL.  ONCE, WHEN THE FORMER PRESIDENT APPEARED ON 
NATIONAL TV DRINKING A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE AND 
DISPARAGING RAMADAN AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO DEVELOPMENT, 
IT WAS OPENLY HOSTILE.  THIS DISTANCING FROM RAMADAN 
OBSERVANCE WAS ALWAYS OUT OF STEP WITH THE FOLKWAYS 
OF THE COUNTRY.  TUNISIANS, HOWEVER, HAD SUCH RESPECT 
FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT THAT HIS SECULARISM DID NOT 
POSE A MAJOR POLITICAL PROBLEM UNTIL LATE IN HIS RULE. 
 
4. BY CONTRAST, THIS YEAR THE GOT HAS ACTIVELY 
REVIVED TUNISIA\'S CUSTOMS AND FOLKWAYS REGARDING 
RAMADAN.  EARLY ON THE GOT DROPPED THE CALENDAR 
METHOD (BASED ON SCIENTIFIC CALCULATIONS) USED BY THE 
PREVIOUS REGIME TO DETERMINE THE ONSET AND END OF THE 
MONTH AND OPTED FOR THE SIGHTING METHOD (BASED ON 
ACTUAL HUMAN SIGHTING OF THE NEW MOON) WHICH IS 
CONSIDERED MORE TRADITIONAL.  (ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISTS HAD LONG CHAMPIONED THE SIGHTING 
METHOD).  GOT ALSO RETURNED TO THE TUNISIAN CUSTOM OF 
USING CANON BLASTS TO ANNOUNCE THE BEGINNING AND 
BREAKING OF THE DAILY FASTS.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE 
FRENCH LANGUAGE TELEVISION STATION CARRIED A LARGE 
NUMBER OF RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS.  FURTHER, GOT ORDERED 
THE REHABILITATION OF 190 MOSQUES AND SPONSORED 
CONCERTS AND OTHER CULTURAL ACTIVITIES AT NIGHT IN 
THE TUNIS MEDINA DURING THE ENTIRE MONTH.  THE 
PRESIDENT AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS PROMINENTLY 
ATTENDED LOCAL CEREMONIES. 
 
5. TOWARDS NON-FASTING MOSLEMS AND TOURISTS, HOWEVER, 
THE GOT FOLLOWED THE TOLERANT POLICY OF THE PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENT.  THIS RAMADAN (17 APRIL - 15 MAY) 
CORRESPONDED WITH THE START OF THE TOURIST SEASON, 
AND THE HOTELS AND OTHER FACILITIES THAT CATER TO 
TOURISTS OPERATED NORMALLY.  AS UNDER BOURGUIBA, 
DRINKING AND SMOKING OUTSIDE CAFES WERE EFFECTIVELY 
DISCOURAGED, BUT THE LARGER CAFES WERE PACKED INSIDE 
WITH NON-FASTING TUNISIANS.  PUBLIC BARS STOPPED 
SERVING ALCOHOL, AND ONE MAJOR BAR DOWNTOWN WAS 
VEILED TO HIDE CLIENTS SMOKING CIGARETTES AND 
DRINKING SOFT DRINKS.  SOME OF THE SMALLER 
RESTAURANTS AND CAFES CLOSED BY PERSONAL CHOICE.  AS 
BEST WE CAN DETERMINE, THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAJOR 
EXCEPTION.  ISLAMISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY HARASSED 
STUDENTS WHO DID NOT OBSERVE THE FAST, BUT SUCH 
HARASSMENT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED TO THE 
CAMPUSES. 
 
--------------------------------- 
FOR THE PUBLIC, A \"LIGHT\" RAMADAN 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. SEVERAL AVERAGE TUNISIANS HAVE DESCRIBED THIS 
YEAR\'S RAMADAN TO US AS \"LIGHT\" (KHFIF), IE, AN EASY 
ONE.  THE MILD WEATHER OVER THE PAST MONTH 
CONTRIBUTED SOMEWHAT.  THE GOT\'S MEASURES, HOWEVER, 
CREATED AN ESPRIT DE CORPS AMONG THOSE WHO BORE THE 
INCONVENIENCE OF THE FAST THAT DID NOT EXIST UNDER 
BOURGUIBA.  EXPLAINING THIS ESPRIT DE CORPS, 
TUNISIANS MENTION THE SIGHTING METHOD WHICH ENABLED 
EVERYONE TO START AND END RAMADAN AT THE SAME TIME, 
THUS AVOIDING THE SOCIAL AWKWARDNESS OF SOME FASTING 
AND OTHERS NOT.  THEY ALSO SAY THAT GOT\'S REVIVAL OF 
LOCAL TRADITIONS, WITH THE NOSTALGIA AND AWARENESS OF 
A SHARED CULTURAL HERITAGE THE TRADITIONS EVOKED, 
FOSTERED A SENSE OF TOGETHERNESS.  PARENTS HAVE 
REMARKED, FOR EXAMPLE, THEIR SATISFACTION IN TAKING 
CHILDREN OUT TO LOOK FOR THE NEW MOON AND EXPLAINING 
ITS SIGNIFICANCE.  BEN ALI\'S APPEARANCE AT RELIGIOUS 
CEREMONIES AND THE UNPRECEDENTED MEDIA COVERAGE 
SHOWED THAT THEY WERE NOT ALONE IN FASTING.  AT 
EMBASSY FUNCTIONS, WESTERNIZED TUNISIANS OF THE ELITE 
WHO ORDINARILY DRINK ALCOHOL ABSTAINED AND REMARKED 
THAT MORE OF THEIR FRIENDS WERE OBSERVING RAMADAN 
THAN BEFORE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
COMMENT: GOT GETS IN SYNC WITH POPULAR RELIGION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. GOT\'S APPROACH TO RAMADAN IS THE LATEST INDICATION 
THAT IT WANTS TO GET IN SYNC WITH POPULAR RELIGIOUS 
SENTIMENT.  EARLIER EXAMPLES INCLUDED BEN ALI\'S 
NUMEROUS GESTURES TO ISLAM AND AND THE HEAVY COVERAGE 
OF THE RELIGIOUS RITES HE PERFORMED WHILE ON A FORMAL 
VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
8. PART OF THIS APPROACH MAY STEM FROM PERSONAL 
PIETY, BUT PART ALSO STEMS FROM A DESIRE TO PREVENT 
ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS FROM BECOMING A GREATER 
POLITICAL FORCE.  GOT HAS ADOPTED THOSE ITEMS OF THE 
ISLAMIC AGENDA THAT MESH WITH TUNISIA\'S TOLERANT 
FOLKWAYS (EG, ISLAMIC INCANTATIONS, VIP ATTENDANCE AT 
RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES, PROMOTION OF RAMADAN, ETC.) BUT 
ESCHEWED THOSE PURITANICAL ITEMS (REVISION OF THE 
PERSONAL STATUS CODE, RESTRICITIONS ON TOURISTS) THAT 
WOULD RADICALLY CHANGE TUNISIA.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  TUNISIA CELEBRATED THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST 7 NOVEMBER WITH FESTIVITIES 
AND CEREMONIES.  TUNISIANS RESPONDED 
ENTHUSIASTICALLY.  IN AN ADDRESS TO THE CHAMBER OF 
DEPUTIES BEN ALI ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENTIAL AND 
LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS WOULD BE HELD 9 APRIL AND 
RECAPITULATED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S ACHIEVEMENTS OVER THE 
PAST YEAR.  TOGETHER WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE 
LEGAL OPPOSITION AND PROFESSIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL 
ASSOCIATIONS HE SIGNED A \"NATIONAL PACT\" TO SERVE AS 
A UNIFYING CREDO.  FOR MOST TUNISIANS BEN ALI HAS 
LIVED UP TO THE PROMISES AND EXPECTATIONS EVOKED LAST 
YEAR.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------ 
7 NOVEMBER: AN OCCASION TO CELEBRATE 
------------------------------------ 
 
3.  THE 7TH OF NOVEMBER WAS THE OCCASION FOR A WIDE 
RANGE OF FESTIVITIES AND CEREMONIES.  PRESIDENT ZINE 
EL ABIDINE BEN ALI HAD SET THE MOOD TWO DAYS BEFORE 
ISSUING A CLEMENCY THAT BENEFITED SCORES OF 
PRISONERS, INCLUDING SUCH PROMINENT OPPOSITION 
FIGURES AS NAJIB CHEBBI AND THE ISLAMIST ABDELFATAH 
MOUROU (SEPTEL).  STREETS WERE RENAMED, CONFERENCES 
HELD, AND PARADES ORGANIZED THROUGHOUT TUNISIA. 
(NATIONAL TV SHOWED THE TUNSIAN CONSUL IN LIBYA 
INAUGURATING A \"7 NOVEMBER AVENUE\" IN TRIPOLI.)  GOT 
LET GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES LEAVE WORK EARLY.  UNLIKE 
PAST PARADES, THE MILITARY ASPECT DID NOT DOMINATE: 
NO WEAPONS WERE DISPLAYED AND NO JETS OVERFLEW THE 
PROCESSIONS.  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TUNISIA\'S 
HISTORY, THE LEGAL OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE ALLOWED TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE PARADES:  THE YOUTH WINGS OF THE 
LEGAL PARTIES HAD FLOATS.  THE MOST PROMINENT FOREIGN 
DIGNITARY AT THE FESTIVITIES WAS LIBYAN COMMANDANT 
KHOUILDY HUMIDI WHO STOOD AT BEN ALI\'S SIDE ON THE 
VIEWING STAND.  HABIB AMMAR, THE RECENTLY FIRED 
INTERIOR MINISTER, WAS ALSO PRESENT AND WAS ONE OF 12 
RECIPIENTS OF A \"ORDER OF 7TH NOVEMBER RIBBON\" 
AWARDED BY BEN ALI THAT DAY.  DIPLOMATS WHO OBSERVED 
AMMAR UP CLOSE, HOWEVER, SAID HE LOOKED DRAWN. 
 
4.  A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE FESTIVITIES TWO 
INDEPENDENT PAPERS ASKED BEN ALI TO TREAT 7TH 
NOVEMBER AS AN ORDINARY DAY SO AS TO BREAK 
DEFINITIVELY WITH THE PERSONALITY CULT OF THE 
BOURGUIBA YEARS.  THIS SENTIMENT WAS NOT WIDESPREAD, 
HOWEVER, AND THE THOUSANDS WHO ATTENDED THE PARADES, 
FIREWORKS, ETC. WERE OBVIOUSLY ENTHUSIASTIC, ALBEIT 
LESS BOISTEROUS THAN SUCH CROWDS WERE ON SIMILAR 
OCCASIONS DURING THE BOURGUIBA ERA. 
 
------------------------------------- 
BEN ALI ADDRESSES CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  IN AN ADDRESS TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES (REF A) 
THE AFTERNOON OF 7 NOVEMBER PRESIDENT BEN ALI 
ANNOUNCED NEW MEASURES AND RECAPITULATED RECENT 
ACHIEVEMENTS.  HE ANNOUNCED THAT EARLY PRESIDENTIAL 
AND GENERAL LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS WOULD BE HELD 9 
APRIL 1989.  (FYI. THIS SUPPLANTS THE ELECTIONS 
SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY AND NOVEMBER 1989. END FYI.) 
OTHER MEASURES INCLUDE:  A SECRETARIAT OF STATE 
CHARGED WITH RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS; A DRAFT LAW 
ABOLISHING FORCED LABOR AS A PRISON SENTENCE; 
RESTRUCTURED AND ENHANCED GOVERNORATE COUNCILS; A 
COMMITTEE TO ENHANCE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY; AND A 
SUPREME COUNCIL OF COMMUNICATION. 
 
6.  BEN ALI MENTIONED THE RECENT POLITICAL REFORMS 
AND THANKED THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE ARAB 
ORGANIZATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS FOR SELECTING TUNISIA 
TO HOST THE ARAB/AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTE.  HE 
REITERATED GOT\'S PLAN TO ARABIZING EDUCATION AND 
OUTLINED PLANS TO TACKLE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS (SEPTEL), 
ESPECIALLY UNEMPLOYMENT: \"OUR MAJOR CONCERN\".  HE 
APPEALED TO HIS FELLOW TUNISIANS TO OVERCOME THE 
\"WAITING ATTITUDE\" AND ADMINISTRATIVE SLOWNESS AND 
ASKED TRADE UNIONIST TO BREAK WITH THE NEGATIVE 
PAST.  AS FOR FOREIGN POLICY, HIS GOVERNMENT ASSIGNED 
PRIME IMPORTANCE TO THE MAGHREB, HAD REESTABLISHED 
THE COUNTRY\'S ARAB DIMENSION, AND HAD REINFORCED 
LINKS WITH OTHER MUSLIM, AFRICAN, MEDITERRANEAN, AND 
NON-ALIGNED STATES.  RESPECT FOR MORALITY, HE SAID, 
IS BINDING ON EVERYONE.  WOMEN, BEING ROLE MODELS FOR 
CHILDREN, MUST PROVE THEY ARE WORTHY OF THE RIGHTS 
THAT THEY HAVE GAINED.  HE CALLED ISLAM A RELIGION OF 
TOLERANCE AND TUNISIA\'S REFUGE AND ASKED THEOLOGIANS 
TO GO HAND IN HAND WITH PROGRESS. 
 
----------------- 
THE NATIONAL PACT 
----------------- 
 
7.  EARLIER IN THE DAY THE LEGAL POLITICAL PARTIES 
AND NATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS SIGNED THE 
\"NATIONAL PACT\" (REF B), A SORT OF NATIONAL CREDO. 
THE PACT IS THE JOINT EFFORT OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM 
THE LEGAL PARTIES, THE TUNISIAN TRADE UNION 
FEDERATION (UGTT), THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (UTICA), 
AND A SYMPATHIZER OF THE ISLAMIC TENDENCY MOVEMENT. 
OF THE FOUR BROAD TOPICS THAT THE PACT DISCUSSES, THE 
ONE ON \"IDENTITY\" IS THE MOST SPECIFIC.  IT AFFIRMS 
FORCEFULLY THE NEED FOR ARABIZATION AND REITERATES 
TUNISIA\'S AVERSION TO POLYGAMY AND SUPPORT FOR EQUAL 
RIGHTS FOR WOMEN IN DIVORCE.  UNDER THE HEADING 
\"POLITICAL REGIME\" THE NEED FOR RESPECTING HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND POLITICAL TOLERANCE IS RESTATED; UNDER 
\"DEVELOPMENT\" THE PACT CALLS ON CITIZENS TO SUBMIT TO 
\"FISCAL DUTY\", ENDORSES AN EQUITABLE SHARING OF 
ECONOMIC SACRIFICES, AND ASSIGNS PRIORITY TO 
AGRICULTURE. THE \"FOREIGN RELATIONS\" SECTION AFFIRMS 
THE URGENCY OF CREATING AN ARAB MAGHREB AND TUNISIA\'S 
ATTACHMENT TO NON-ALIGNMENT AND SUPPORT FOR THE UN 
AND OAU.

COMMENT

8.  WHEN TUNISIANS COMPARE BEN ALI\'S RECORD WITH THE 
PROMISES AND EXPECTATIONS EVOKED LAST YEAR THE 
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY BELIEVE HE HAS DELIVERED.  GOT 
HAS FREED HUNDREDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, ENACTED 
NUMEROUS POLITICAL REFORMS, AND -- PERHAPS MOST 
IMPORTANTLY -- CONVINCED THE AVERAGE MAN THAT IT IS 
HONEST AND COMPETENT.  SIGNIFICANTLY, THE PASSAGE IN 
BEN ALI\'S SPEECH BEFORE THE CHAMBER THAT DREW THE 
MOST APPLAUSE WAS THE SECTION WHERE HE SAID (ALLUDING 
TO HABIB AMMAR), \"NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW...THERE IS 
NO ROOM FOR THE EXPLOITATIONS OF NEPOTISM AND 
FAVORITISM....\"

TAGS:  KSPR, AINF, KPRP, PINR, TS 
SUBJECT:  (U) SPR 0002, TUNISIA\'S RELATIONS WITH 
COMMUNIST COUNTRIES 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  ALMOST ALL COMMUNIST COUNTRIES 
MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN TUNISIA. 
THE SOVIET AND CHINESE REPRESENTATIONS ARE, 
CHARACTERISTICALLY, THE LARGEST.  OVERALL, TUNISIA\'S 
RELATIONS WITH THESE COUNTRIES ARE GOOD BUT NOT 
OVERLY WARM.  1988, TUNISIAN PRESIDENT ZINE EL 
ABIDINE BEN ALI\'S FIRST FULL YEAR IN OFFICE, MARKED 
THE CONTINUANCE OF A PERCEPTIBLE WARMING TREND IN 
TUNISIAN-COMMUNIST BLOC RELATIONS.  THE ROOT CAUSE OF 
THIS TREND PROBABLY LIES IN BEN ALI\'S DESIRE TO 
PRESENT HIMSELF TO HIS MAGHREB NEIGHBORS 
(PARTICULARLY LIBYA) AS A MODERATE, NON-ALIGNED ARAB 
CHIEF OF STATE.  WHILE TUNISIA RETAINS HER 
TRADITIONAL STRONG TIES TO THE U.S., FRANCE, ITALY 
AND OTHER WESTERN POWERS, THE BEN ALI ADMINISTRATION 
HAS MADE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO PLAY DOWN THE 
TUNISIAN-WESTERN RELATIONSHIP TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. 
THIS NOTED, IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST 
COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN MORE COSMETIC THAN SUBSTANTIVE IN 
NATURE.  THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT 
COMMUNIST BLOC COUNTRIES ARE NOT YET PREPARED TO 
OFFER BEN ALI THE KIND OF FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE THAT HE DESIRES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
PART I.  OFFICIAL COMMUNIST REPRESENTATION: 
 
2.  (C) DURING THE CALENDAR YEAR, EMBASSY NOTED NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMUNIST EMBASSY STAFFING OR 
ACCREDITATION LEVELS APART FROM THE NOVEMBER 
ACCREDITATION OF AN EAST GERMAN MILITARY ATTACHE 
(RESIDENT IN ALGIERS, SEE MILITARY RELATIONS BELOW). 
THERE WERE NO COMMUNIST EMBASSY EXPULSIONS DURING THE 
REPORTING PERIOD.  FOLLOWING ARE 1988 ESTIMATES FOR 
SOVIET EMBASSY AND OTHER PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO 
TUNISIA (SPOUSES, CHILDREN NOT INCLUDED): 
--ACCREDITED DIPLOMATS:                          25 
--EMBASSY, CONSULAR, AND CULTURAL CENTER STAFF:  27 
--TRADE STAFF:                                   16 
--GKES (SOON TO BE INCORPORATED WITH TRADE 
            MISSION):                             9 
--AEROFLOT:                                       3 
--JOURNALISTS:                                    3 
--SOVIET EMBASSY GRADE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES:          4 
--TOTAL:                                         87 
(NOTE:  THE REDUCTION FROM LAST YEAR\'S ESTIMATED 
TOTAL OF 120 IS PROBABLY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN STAFF 
VICE OFFICIAL PERSONNEL.  IN ADDITION TO THE 
OFFICIALS LISTED ABOVE, ACCORDING TO A SOVIET 
DIPLOMAT, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 300 SOVIET 
COOPERANTS IN TUNISIA.) 
 
3.  (C)  FOLLOWING ARE 1988 ESTIMATES FOR NON-SOVIET 
COMMUNIST REPRESENTATION IN TUNISIA (TOTAL PRESENCE 
FIGURES UNAVAILABLE UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED): 
--BULGARIA:  7 DIPLOMATS (D), 9 STAFF/TRADE/OTHER (S) 
--CZECHOSLOVAKIA:  7 D, 9 S 
--EAST GERMANY:  6 D (WITH MILATT IN ALGIERS), 5 S 
--HUNGARY:  4 D, 4 S 
--POLAND:  6 D, 3 S 
--ROMANIA:  3 D, 1 S 
--CUBA:  3 D 
--CHINA:  21 D (TOTAL S UNKNOWN BUT ESTIMATED AT 30) 
--ALBANIA:  NON-RESIDENT AMBASSADOR (NRA) 
--NORTH KOREA:  3 D 
--VIETNAM:  NRA 
--YUGOSLAVIA:  3 D, 4 S 
 
PART II.  LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERSHIP: 
 
4.  (C) THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF TUNISIA (PCT) WAS 
LEGALIZED IN JULY 1981 AND HAS APPROXIMATELY 400-500 
ACTIVE MEMBERS AND APPROXIMATELY 2000-3000 
SYMPATHIZERS.  IN 1988, PCT ACTIVITY ON TUNISIAN 
CAMPUSES WAS MINIMAL DUE TO GROWING ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALIST, ARAB NATIONALIST, AND RIVAL LEFTIST 
ACTIVITIES.  THE LEFTIST STUDENTS, WHO STILL VIEW THE 
PCT AS TOO MODERATE, BELONG TO A SMALL GROUP OF 
POORLY ORGANIZED STUDENT COMMUNIST/LEFTIST MOVEMENTS 
THAT ARE LOOSELY UNITED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE 
RECOGNIZED GENERAL UNION OF TUNISIAN STUDENTS (UGET) 
LED BY SELF-AVOWED MARXIST SAMIR LABIDI.  DURING THIS 
REPORTING PERIOD, THE \"HONEYMOON\" BETWEEN THE BEN ALI 
ADMINISTRATION AND PCT LEADER MOHAMMED HARMEL 
CONTINUED.  HARMEL WAS ONE OF SEVERAL LEGAL 
OPPOSITION LEADERS WHO SIGNED THE 7 NOVEMBER 1988 
\"NATIONAL PACT\" (A SYMBOLIC DOCUMENT PLEDGING 
COOPERATION AND FAIR PLAY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT, THE 
RULING PARTY, THE UNIONS, AND VARIOUS OPPOSITION 
PARTIES).  HARMEL SPEAKS RUSSIAN AND MAINTAINS GOOD 
CONTACTS WITH THE SOVIET AND OTHER EAST BLOC 
EMBASSIES AND THE PCT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE CPSU AS A 
LEGITIMATE COMMUNIST PARTY.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE 
PCT WILL BECOME AN APPRECIABLE POLITICAL FORCE IN THE 
NEAR FUTURE.  BEN ALI HAS MANAGED TO TAME THE PCT TO 
POINT OF ALMOST TOTAL CONCILIATION, AND THE PCT\'S 
POSSIBLE STUDENT BASE OF SUPPORT APPEARS TO HOLD 
DISDAIN FOR THIS MODERATE COMMUNIST PARTY.  IN 
ADDITION, THE PCT REMAINS AT ODDS WITH THE BROAD 
POPULAR ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST SECTOR OF TUNISIAN 
SOCIETY.  IN DECEMBER, THE PCT ATTEMPTED TO 
CAPITALIZE ON THE POPULARITY OF THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE 
BY STAGING THREE DAYS OF FESTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF 
THE INTIFADAH UPRISINGS. 
 
5.  (S) DURING THIS REPORTING PERIOD, BEN ALI\'S 
DECISION TO LEGALIZE THE TRADITIONAL UGET STUDENT 
UNION HAS TAKEN THE WIND FROM THE SAILS OF THE MORE 
RADICAL LEFTIST STUDENT GROUPS.  RADICAL LEFTIST 
INFLUENCE CONTINUED TO FLOURISH IN THE FORM OF 
ORGANIZED OPPOSITION TO THE GOT-CONTROLLED GENERAL 
UNION OF TUNISIAN WORKERS (UGTT), HOWEVER, BEN ALI\'S 
ONGOING REFORM PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE ATTRACTING THE 
GREATER MAJORITY OF TUNISIAN WORKERS AWAY FROM THE 
RADICALS.  THERE IS IN FACT AN UNRECOGNIZED COMMUNIST 
WORKER\'S PARTY OF TUNISIA (POCT) WHOSE MEMBERSHIP AND 
INFLUENCE IN THE TUNISIAN UNIONS AND ON CAMPUS 
REMAINS UNKNOWN.  ALTHOUGH COMMUNIST INFLUENCE COULD 
GROW WITHIN THE INCREASINGLY LIBERAL TUNISIAN 
POLITICAL CLIMATE, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT BEN ALI WOULD 
ALLOW THE COMMUNIST/LEFTIST MOVEMENTS TO GO VERY FAR 
BEYOND ACTING AS DE FACTO COUNTERWEIGHTS TO THE 
ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS.  IN SHORT, TUNISIAN 
COMMUNISM, WITH THE ESSENTIALLY WEAK PCT AS ITS 
CENTERPIECE, DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE A VERY PROMISING 
FUTURE. 
 
PART III.  CULTURAL RELATIONS, EDUCATION EXCHANGE: 
 
6.  (LOU) THE SOVIET UNION PROMOTES SOVIET CULTURE IN 
TUNISIA.  ITS CULTURAL CENTER OFFERS A TUITION FREE 
RUSSIAN LANGUAGE PROGRAM AND ALSO SPONSORS FILMS, ART 
AND PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITS, AND MUSICAL PERFORMANCES. 
THERE IS A TUNISIAN-SOVIET FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION 
WHICH SPONSORS SUCH ACTIVITIES AS LECTURES BY 
VISITING SOVIET ACADEMICS.  HE EAST EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES ALSO SPONSOR CULTURAL EVENTS (MID JANUARY 
1988 GAVE US A CZECHOSLOVAK CULTURAL WEEK ALONG WITH 
THE CONCURRENT VISIT OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK CULTURAL 
MINISTER TO TUNIS).  CUBAN SPONSORSHIP OF SUCH EVENTS 
IS USUALLY LIMITED TO ACTIVITIES CO-SPONSORED BY 
OTHER LATIN COUNTRIES REPRESENTED IN TUNISIA. 
CHINESE CULTURAL INFLUENCE IS ALSO PRESENT BUT 
LIMITED AS CHINA TENDS TO CENTER ITS BILATERAL 
RELATIONS WITH TUNISIA ON TRADE, DEVELOPMENT AND 
COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES.  TASS AND THE NEW CHINA NEWS 
AGENCY ARE BOTH REPRESENTED IN TUNIS.  IN ADDITION, 
SEVERAL COMMUNIST JOURNALS, INCLUDING THE SOVIET 
FRENCH LANGUAGE VERSION OF \"MOSCOW NEWS\" ARE 
AVAILABLE AT DOWNTOWN TUNIS NEWSSTANDS.  SOME LOCAL 
VIDEO CLUBS ALSO CARRY SOVIET FILMS FOR VIDEOCASSETTE 
RENTAL. 
 
7.  (C) THE NUMBER OF TUNISIAN STUDENTS STUDYING IN 
COMMUNIST COUNTRIES REMAINED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME IN 
1988.  THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT COMMUNIST 
EDUCATED PERSONNEL ARE ACCEDING TO POSITIONS OF 
AUTHORITY IN THE GOVERNMENT OR THE RULING PARTY. 
REGARDING THE PRC, ACCORDING TO THE ESTIMATE OF ONE 
CHINESE DIPLOMAT, THE MAJORITY OF TUNISIANS IN CHINA 
ARE LANGUAGE STUDENTS.  OVERALL, THE MAJORITY OF 
TUNISIAN STUDENTS WHO STUDY ABROAD DO SO IN WESTERN 
COUNTRIES.  THIS IS DUE BOTH TO THE GENERAL 
PERCEPTION THAT THE QUALITY OF A WESTERN EDUCATION 
CANNOT BE MATCHED ELSEWHERE, AND A CERTAIN TUNISIAN 
CULTURAL AFFINITY TOWARDS THE WEST.  NO NEW MAJOR 
SCIENTIFIC OR CULTURAL AGREEMENTS WITH COMMUNIST 
COUNTRIES WERE SIGNED IN 1988.  ACCORDING TO A SOVIET 
OFFICIAL WITH ALLEGED CONSULAR DUTIES, THE SOVIET 
GOVERNMENT GRANTS APPROXIMATELY 60 FOUR YEAR 
UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS A YEAR AND CLAIMS THAT, AT 
ANY GIVEN TIME, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 400 TUNISIAN 
STUDENTS IN THE USSR.  A BULGARIAN OFFICIAL SAID THAT 
HIS GOVERNMENT GRANTED SEVEN SCHOLARSHIPS A YEAR AND 
THAT THE TOTAL OF TUNISIAN STUDENTS IN HIS COUNTRY 
RARELY EXCEEDED FIFTY (INCLUDING THOSE WHO FINANCE 
THEIR OWN STUDIES).  A CZECHOSLOVAK OFFICIAL SAID 
THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS STUDYING IN HIS COUNTRY 
HAS REMAINED CONSTANT SINCE THE CHANGE OF 
ADMINISTRATIONS IN TUNISIA. 
 
PART IV.  DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR RELATIONS:  NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OTHER THAN THE ACCREDITATION OF 
SOME MILITARY ATTACHES (SEE MILITARY RELATIONS). 
 
PART VI.  APPRAISAL OF POLITICAL/ECONOMIC/MILITARY 
RELATIONS: 
 
8.  POLITICAL: 
 
A.  (S) PRIOR TO BEN ALI\'S LATE 1987 ASSUMPTION OF 
POWER, TUNISIA HAD MAINTAINED CORRECT BUT COOL 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MOST COMMUNIST COUNTRIES 
FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  FORMER PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA 
WAS A STAUNCH ANTI-COMMUNIST AND NOT AVERSE TO MAKING 
HIS PRO-WESTERN VIEWS KNOWN.  DURING THIS PERIOD, IT 
IS PROBABLE THAT THE MAJORITY OF COMMUNIST EMBASSIES 
IN TUNISIA WERE THERE SIMPLY TO CARRY ON RELATIONS 
WITH THE PLO AND MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH THE ARAB 
LEAGUE (BOTH OF WHICH ARE HEADQUARTERED IN TUNIS) 
RATHER THAN TO FOCUS ON BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH 
TUNISIA.  SINCE THE 1987 CHANGE AND ON INTO 1988, 
THERE HAS BEEN A PERCEPTIBLE WARMING TREND IN 
RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION AND OTHER BLOC 
COUNTRIES THAT HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF WITH INCREASED 
CULTURAL ACTIVITIES AND INCREASED COVERAGE OF SOVIET 
INTERNAL EVENTS IN THE TUNISIAN MEDIA.  TUNISIA\'S 
TRADITIONAL REASON FOR MAINTAINING CORRECT RELATIONS 
WITH THE SOVIETS STEMMED FROM THE GOT BELIEF THAT THE 
SOVIET UNION HAD A RESTRAINING INFLUENCE OVER LIBYA 
(WITH WHOM THE GOT REESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
IN DECEMBER OF 1987).  NOW THAT THE TUNISIAN-LIBYAN 
RAPPROCHEMENT HAS CONTINUED FOR ALMOST A FULL YEAR, 
TUNISIA MAY NOT NEED THIS PERCEIVED \"RESTRAINING 
INFLUENCE\" OVER QADHAFI.  GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE 
COMMUNIST COUNTRIES HAVE NEITHER THE RESOURCES NOR 
THE DESIRE TO CONTRIBUTE GREAT AMOUNTS OF FOREIGN AID 
TO TUNISIA, THE WARMING TREND MAY RETAIN ITS PRESENT 
COSMETIC NATURE AND NOT GO MUCH FURTHER.  THE GOT 
WILL CONTINUE TO MARKET PHOSPHATES, FERTILIZERS, AND 
OLIVE OIL TO THE SOVIET BLOC.  THIS SAID, PAST 
EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THESE COUNTRIES TEND TO 
DRIVE HARD BARGAINS WITH TUNISIA.  BEN ALI VERY 
OBVIOUSLY CONTINUES TO PLACE A GREATER EMPHASIS ON 
REGIONAL MAGHREB ISSUES THAN ON EAST-WEST AFFAIRS. 
 
B.  (S) AFTER THE SOVIET UNION, CHINA HAS THE LARGEST 
COMMUNIST REPRESENTATION IN TUNISIA.  OVERALL, 
SINO-TUNISIAN BILATERAL RELATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON 
COMMERCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND LESS ON 
POLITICS PER SE.  ONE CHINESE OFFICIAL VIEWED THE 
POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE 
CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT AS CORDIAL BUT COOL.  DESPITE 
THE LARGE IN COUNTRY PRC REPRESENTATION, THERE ARE 
ONLY A HANDFUL OF TUNISIAN DIPLOMATS IN CHINA.  AS 
WITH MANY EMBASSIES IN TUNIS, THE PRINCIPLE REASON 
FOR THE CHINESE EMBASSY PRESENCE MAY WELL BE THE 
PRESENCE OF THE PLO.  A CHINESE ASSISTANT FOREIGN 
MINISTER VISITED TUNIS IN LATE 1988, HOWEVER ALL 
INDICATIONS ARE THAT HE MET WITH TUNISIAN OFFICIALS 
TO CONVEY CHINESE VIEWS ON MAJOR WORLD EVENTS AND NOT 
TO DISCUSS SUBSTANTIVE BILATERAL ISSUES. 
 
C.  (C) ON THE EASTERN EUROPEAN SIDE, POLITICAL 
RELATIONS APPEAR TO BE GOOD BUT NON-SUBSTANTIVE.  IN 
MID SUMMER, A MEMBER OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK COMMUNIST 
PARTY PRESIDIUM VISITED THE TUNISIAN PARLIAMENT, 
HOWEVER, APART FROM SOME VAGUE PUBLIC EXPRESSIONS OF 
FRATERNITY AND FRIENDSHIP, THE VISIT SEEEMS TO HAVE 
ACCOMPLISHED VERY LITTLE.  THE EARLY 1988 VISIT OF 
THE ROMANIAN PRIME MINISTER APPEARS TO HAVE PRODUCED 
SIMILAR RESULTS AND THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR THE 
MARCH VISIT OF A BULGARIAN STATE COUNCIL VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
 
9.  ECONOMIC: 
 
A.  (LOU) TUNISIA\'S ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL LINKS 
WITH COMMUNIST COUNTRIES ARE SLIGHT IN COMPARISON TO 
THOSE WITH TUNISIA\'S TRADITIONAL TRADING PARTNERS 
AND, DURING 1988, REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT. 
 
-USSR:  IN NOVEMBER, THE TUNISIAN GOVERNMENT 
ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO REINFORCE BILATERAL 
COMMERCIAL TIES WITH THE SOVIET UNION IN 1989.  TO 
THIS END, THE TUNISIAN-SOVIET JOINT COMMISSION WILL 
MEET IN TUNIS IN DECEMBER (WITH THE SOVIET DELEGATION 
LED BY THEIR MINISTER OF PLANS).  ALSO DURING THIS 
PERIOD, THE SOVIETS PROVIDED MATERIAL ASSISTANCE IN 
THE FORM OF TWO LARGE BIPLANE CROP DUSTERS TO ASSIST 
TUNISIA AGAINST THE NORTH AFRICAN LOCUST INVASION. 
THE SOVIET UNION EXPORTS LUMBER, AMMONIA, POTASSIUM, 
AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT, HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION 
MATERIALS, BOOKS AND FILMS TO TUNISIA.  IN 1988, THE 
USSR PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 180,000 METRIC TONS OF 
TUNISIAN TRIPLE SUPERPHOSPHATE (FOR APPROXIMATELY 
U.S. DOLLARS 27 MILLION) AND OLIVE OIL. 
 
B.  (C) EASTERN EUROPE:  BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH 
SEVERAL EAST BLOC OFFFICIALS, THE CHANGE IN TUNISIAN 
GOVERNMENT HAS HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC AND 
COMMERCIAL RELATIONS. 
 
-CZECHOSLOVAKIA:  TRADE FIGURES DROPPED CONSIDERABLY 
FROM U.S. DOLLARS 10 MILLION WORTH OF CZECHOSLOVAK 
EXPORTS TO TUNISIA IN 1986 TO 4.9 MILLION IN 1987. 
TUNISIAN EXPORTS TO CZECHOSLOVAKIA (MOSTLY PHOSPHATE 
BASED PRODUCTS) DROPPED FROM U.S. DOLLARS 11 MILLION 
TO 6.6 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD.  ACCORDING TO 
A CZECHOSLOVAK OFFICIAL, BOTH FIGURES ARE EXPECTED TO 
INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT IN 1988. 
 
-POLAND:  A POLISH OFFICIAL SAID THAT COMMERCIAL 
RELATIONS WITH TUNISIA HAD IN FACT CHANGED FOR THE 
BETTER SINCE THE CHANGE OF POWER.  HE FIRST NOTED 
THAT THE TUNISIAN MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY NO LONGER HAD 
TO GRANT SPECIAL WAIVERS TO TUNISIAN COMPANIES WHO 
DESIRED TO DO BUSINESS WITH POLAND AND THAT THE 
CENTRAL BANK BUREAUCRACY WAS \"MORE COOPERATIVE\". 
THIS NOTED, HE SAID THE TRADE FIGURES REMAINED 
RELATIVELY CONSTANT, I.E. POLISH EXPORTS TO TUNISIA 
REMAINED AT THE APPROXIMATE U.S. DOLLARS 22 MILLION 
LEVEL AND TUNISIAN PRODUCTS IMPORTED TO POLAND 
ACTUALLY FELL TO APPROXIMATELY U.S. DOLLARS 1.5 
MILLION IN 1988.  THE OFFICIAL ATTRIBUTED THIS DROP 
TO ONGOING INTERNAL REFORMS IN POLAND.  HE WOULD NOT 
SPECULATE ON WHAT EFFECT THE PLANNED JANUARY 1988 
ABOLISHMENT OF POLAND\'S CENTRAL EXPORT/IMPORT 
PARASTATAL COMPANY WOULD HAVE ON POLISH-TUNISIAN 
COMMERCIAL RELATIONS.  HE ADDED THAT THE TUNISIAN 
SIDE \"PUSHED\" BARTER TRADE OVER HARD CURRENCY 
PURCHASES. 
 
-BULGARIA:  A BULGARIAN OFFICIAL TOLD THE EMBASSY 
THAT BILATERAL COMMERCIAL RELATIONS REMAINED 
RELATIVELY CONSTANT DURING 1988.  HE ADDED THAT THERE 
WAS NO BULGARIAN ECONOMIC AID FOR TUNISIA (CITING 
LIMITED RESOURCES AS THE REASON) AND SAID HE BELIEVED 
THIS WAS THE CASE FOR OTHER EAST BLOC COUNTRIES. 
 
-ROMANIA:  A ROMANIAN OFFICIAL TOLD US THAT THERE IS 
NO ROMANIAN ECONOMIC AID PER SE TO TUNISIA AND THAT 
ROMANIAN-TUNISIAN COMMERCIAL TIES HAVE REMAINED 
RELATIVELY CONSTANT.  HE NOTED THAT THE 
\"LIBERALIZATION\" OF TUNISIA\'S IMPORT RESTRICTIONS 
COULD INCREASE ROMANIAN TRADE WITH TUNISIA DURING THE 
COMING YEAR. 
 
C.  (LOU) CHINA:  SINO-TUNISIAN ECONOMIC COOPERATION 
HAS CONTINUED MUCH AT THE SAME PACE DURING THIS 
PERIOD AS DURING THE PAST.  BASED ON A 1985 
AGREEMENT, CONSTRUCTION BEGAN IN MID 1988 IN CHINA ON 
A SINO-TUNISIAN-KUWAITI FERTILIZER PROCESSING PLANT. 
TUNISIA\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE VENTURE IS 30 PERCENT 
AND TUNISIA WILL SUPPLY CHINA WITH 250,000 METRIC 
TONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID PER YEAR. 
 
10.  MILITARY: 
 
(S) TUNISIAN MILITARY TIES WITH COMMUNIST COUNTRIES 
ARE MINIMAL.  AS OF THIS REPORT, ONLY ONE COMMUNIST 
MILITARY ATTACHE HAD BEEN ACCREDITED TO TUNISIA (GDR, 
RESIDENT IN ALGIERS).  AS OF LATE NOVEMBER, THERE 
WERE INDICATIONS THAT THE SOVIETS WERE PLANNING TO 
PRESENT THE ACCREDITATION PAPERS OF THEIR OWN 
MILITARY ATTACHE.  IN EARLY DECEMBER, A CHINESE 
OFFICIAL SAID THAT THE PRC WOULD PROBABLY ACCREDIT A 
MILITARY ATTACHE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.  THIS 
MARKS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TUNISIAN-COMMUNIST BLOC 
RELATIONS AS FORMER PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA HAD 
SPECIFICALLY BARRED THE COMMUNIST COUNTRIES FROM 
OPENING MILITARY ATTACHE OFFICES.  AS OF THIS 
WRITING, THERE WERE NO COMMUNIST MILITARY TECHNICIANS 
OR ADVISORS IN TUNISIA.  ASIDE FROM THE SOVIET SHIP 
REPAIR CONTRACT, THERE IS NO KNOWN SIGNIFICANT 
COMMUNIST MILITARY ACTIVITY IN TUNISIA.  THERE HAVE 
BEEN NO CONFIRMED REPORTS OF TUNISIANS TRAVELING TO 
COMMUNIST COUNTRIES FOR MILITARY TRAINING.  COMMUNIST 
BLOC MILITARY AID HAS THUS FAR BEEN NON-EXISTANT. 
THIS NOTED, A CHINESE OFFICIAL SAID THAT, DURING THE 
RECENT MAGHREB TOUR OF A CHINESE MILITARY DELEGATION, 
TUNISIA REQUESTED CHINESE AID IN THE FORM OF 
UNSPECIFIED NAVAL VESSELS.  HE ADDED THAT, AS OF 
DECEMBER, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT YET COME TO 
A DECISION ON THE MATTER.

SUBJECT:  BEN ALI LETTER TO CLINTON 
 
1.  IN A JANUARY 9 MEETING WITH MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL 
FOR AMERICAS AFFAIRS AHMED OUNIAES, POLCOUNS WAS 
GIVEN A LETTER FROM PRESIDENT BEN ALI TO PRESIDENT 
CLINTON.  THE TUNISIAN ENGLISH TRANSLATION FOLLOWS. 
THE ORIGINAL TEXT (ARABIC AND ENGLISH TRANSLATION) 
WILL BE FORWARDED VIA POUCH TO NEA/MAG. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT: 
 
I RECEIVED WITH GREAT PLEASURE YOUR LETTER DATED 29 
NOVEMBER 1994, IN WHICH YOU INFORMED ME OF THE UNITED 
STATES\' PROPOSAL TO INVITE THE PARTIES TO THE MIDDLE 
EAST PROCESS TO A MEETING TO BE HELD IN WASHINGTON ON 
10-11 JANUARY 1995, AS A  FOLLOW UP TO THE 
DISCUSSIONS INITIATED AT THE RECENT CASABLANCA 
ECONOMIC SUMMIT, WITH THE AIM OF SETTING UP A 
REGIONAL BANK FOR DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH AFRICA AND THE 
MIDDLE EAST. 
 
HAVING STEADFASTLY SUPPORTED THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
PROCESS AT EVERY STAGE AND HAVING CONTRIBUTED TO 
EFFORTS AIMED AT BUILDING MUTUAL CONFIDENCE AND 
CONCORD BETWEEN THE PARTIES CONCERNED AND PROMOTING 
AN AREA OF STABILITY AND PEACE, TUNISIA APPRECIATES 
THE INITIATIVE OF CREATING THIS FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTION.  WE BELIEVE THIS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT 
STEP IN THE FULFILLMENT OF OUR AIMS:  THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW REGIONAL ORDER IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST AND THE ARAB MAGHREB BASED ON COOPERATION AND 
THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE REGION IN 
THEIR EFFORTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT. 
 
WHILE SUPPORTING AND SETTING UP A REGIONAL BANK FOR 
DEVELOPMENT AND EXPRESSING OUR READINESS TO 
CONTRIBUTE EFFECTIVELY TO THE REALIZATION OF THIS 
PROJECT, WE WELCOME THE INVITATION OF TUNISIA BY THE 
UNITED STATES TO THE AFOREMENTIONED PREPARATORY 
WASHINGTON MEETING.  TUNISIA WILL BE REPRESENTED BY 
TWO OF ITS HIGH OFFICIALS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN 
EXAMINING POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL ISSUES RELATED TO 
THE CREATION OF THE INSTITUTION. 
 
HAVING PUT FORWARD A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES AIMED AT 
PROMOTING THE PEACE PROCESS AND ANXIOUS TO PURSUE ITS 
ACTIVE ROLE IN THE RECONSTRUCTION OF GAZA AND JERICHO 
AND THE REGION AS A WHOLE AND IN BRINGING THE 
NORMALIZATION PROCESS BETWEEN THE ARAB COUNTRIES AND 
ISRAEL TO MATURITY, TUNISIA IS DETERMINED TO 
CONTRIBUTE IN ESTABLISHING THE STRUCTURES AND 
NECESSARY MECHANISMS TO SET UP A NEW REGIONAL ORDER 
WHICH WILL HASTEN THE CONCLUSION OF THE PEACE PROCESS 
AND PUT AN END TO THE VICIOUS CIRCLE OF VIOLENCE AND 
TERRORISM AS WELL AS ALL SOURCES OF CONFRONTATION IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST; THUS ALLOWING FOR GREATER EFFORTS IN 
FAVOR OF DEVELOPMENT. 
 
WHILE PREPARING FOR THE WASHINGTON MEETING WHICH WILL 
PRESENT US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE VIEWS AND 
HAVE MORE DETAILED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE VARIOUS 
TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT, TUNISIA EXPRESSES 
THE HOPE THAT THIS BANK WILL PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN 
ASSISTING THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION IN PROMOTING 
INVESTMENTS AND INCREASING PRODUCTION. 
 
ALL PEACE LOVING COUNTRIES AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL 
AND REGIONAL FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS 
SHOULD TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO SUPPORT INITIATIVES 
FOR DEVELOPMENT AND COOPERATION TO ANCHOR PEACE 
THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SECURITY, STABILITY AND 
PROSPERITY FOR ALL.

1.  PEACE CORPS?  WE LOVED THEM--AND TUNISIA LOVED 
THEM--FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
DEVELOPMENT THE 2,382 AMERICANS AND THEIR THOUSANDS 
OF TUNISIAN COUNTERPARTS MADE DURING THE 34 YEARS OF 
THEIR COMMON ENDEAVOR TO IMPROVE THE HUMAN CONDITION. 
TUNISIA HAS ATTAINED A LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT THAT 
PRECLUDES OUR CONTINUING TO FUND A PEACE CORPS PROGRAM 
HERE NOW; THE PEACE CORPS FORMALLY LEFT TUNISIA ON 
AUGUST 23, 1996. 
 
2.  FITTED TO THE THREE GUIDELINE QUESTIONS OF REFTEL

SOME OF THE MATERIALS PRESENTED IN THE BROCHURE \"PEACE 
CORPS TUNISIA - THE LEGACY - 1962-1996\" PREPARED HERE 
(AND IN WASHINGTON) TO COMMEMORATE THE PROGRAM AT THE 
END OF ITS MISSION.  WE HAVE ADDED A FOURTH CATEGORY 
AT THE END OF THIS MESSAGE:  THE CONTRIBUTION FORMER 
PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS BRING HOME WITH THEM. 
 
 
3.  ITEM A.L:  THE UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT PEACE 
    CORPS VOLUNTEERS...HAVE PREVIOUSLY MADE: 
 
\"TUNISIA WAS ONLY FIVE YEARS INTO ITS NATIONHOOD WHEN 
PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA CAME TO THE UNITED STATES IN 
MAY 1961.  AS THE FIRST HEAD OF STATE TO VISIT NEWLY 
ELECTED PRESIDENT KENNEDY, ONE OF THE FIRST ITEMS ON 
BOURGUIBA\'S AGENDA WAS THE PEACE CORPS.  PRESIDENT 
BOURGUIBA HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AND TUNISIA AS 
REFORM-ORIENTED AND FORWARD-MOVING BY PLACING A 
HIGH PRIORITY ON WOMEN\'S RIGHTS, EDUCATION, AND 
EMPLOYMENT.  AT THIS FIRST HISTORIC MEETING, BOURGUIBA 
ASKED PRESIDENT KENNEDY FOR AMERICA\'S HELP IN 
FULFILLING THE GOALS OF HIS AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. 
 
\"TUNISIA BECAME THE FIRST ARAB COUNTRY TO REQUEST AND 
RECEIVE PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS.  ENTRY INTO TUNISIA 
WAS GROUND BREAKING AND IT WOULD HELP PAVE THE WAY FOR 
PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS TO WORK IN MANY OTHER NATIONS 
OF NORTH AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THE ISLAMIC 
WORLD.  MUCH OF THE EXPERIENCE IN LANGUAGE TRAINING 
AND CROSS-CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING FIRST GAINED IN 
TUNISIA WOULD GO ON TO HELP THE PEACE CORPS PREPARE 
AND TRAIN VOLUNTEERS FOR WORK IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS 
MOROCCO, OMEN, YEMEN, IRAN, AFGHANISTAN, UZBEKISTAN, 
KAZAKHSTAN, THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC, AND TURKMENISTAN.\" 
 
4.  PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS ASSIGNED TO TUNISIA HAD 
TASKS AS VARIED AS ANY IN THE WORLD.  THE INITIAL 
GROUPS OF PCVS IN TUNIS INCLUDED: 
 
--  ARCHITECTS, TOWN PLANNERS, AND CITY SUPERVISORS, 
    WHO WORKED ON THE COASTAL TOWNS OF SOUSSE AND 
    MONASTIR;

    EDUCATING NEW MOTHERS, FAMILY PLANNING, NUTRITION, 
    HEALTH EDUCATION, WATER AND SANITATION; AND 
 
--  MECHANICS, FISHERIES AND AGRICULTURAL SPECIALISTS, 
    WHO PROVIDED VOCATIONAL TRAINING AT TECHNICAL 
    CENTERS, MARINE FISHERIES, AND TAUGHT FARMING 
    METHODS, BEEKEEPING, AND TREE PLANTING. 
 
IN LATER YEARS, PROGRAMS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE, FOR 
EXAMPLE: 
 
--  ARCHITECTS TEACHING ARCHITECTURE; A SCHOOL OF 
    ARCHITECTURE WAS OPENED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
    TUNIS; 
 
--  THE GOT EFFORT TO IMPROVE URBAN HOUSING WAS 
    ASSISTED BY THE PC SELF-HELP HOUSING PROJECT; 
 
--  PCVS ENTERED THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CENTER; 
    A SPECIAL OLYMPICS WAS INITIATED; A MODEL TRAINING

  ITS PEOPLE AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHENING 
  THE TRADITIONAL RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND 
  COOPERATION BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA AND 
  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
 
END TEXT. 
 
6.   MANY OF THE VOLUNTEERS WHO SERVED IN TUNISIA 
CHOSE NOT TO LIMIT THEMSELVES SOLELY TO THE TASK FOR 
WHICH THEY WERE INITIALLY SENT, BUT EXPANDED THEIR 
ENDEAVORS LATERALLY, THEREBY ALSO DEMONSTRATING A 
DIFFERENT APPROACH TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAN HAD 
PREVIOUSLY BEEN UTILIZED BY THEIR COUNTERPARTS.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, THE BEEKEEPER INVOLVED HIMSELF NOT ONLY IN 
TEACHING THE CARE OF BEES AND INCREASING THE HONEY 
PRODUCTION, BUT ALSO IN DEVELOPING LIP BALM AND OTHER 
BEESWAX BYPRODUCTS INSTEAD OF BURNING OFF THE COMBS IN 
WINTER AS HAD BEEN DONE PREVIOUSLY.  HE INVOLVED THE 
KEEPERS IN ORGANIZING THEIR OWN SMALL BUSINESSES TO 
MARKET THESE PRODUCTS.  THE VOLUNTEER WHO TAUGHT 
CLOTHING CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER SEWING SKILLS TO A 
GROUP OF 15-20 GIRLS LATER FOUND HERSELF DEVISING 
VISUAL AIDS TO TEACH HER SEMI-LITERATE STUDENTS 
QUALITY CONTROL, BASIC ACCOUNTING, MARKETING, AND 
PURCHASING MATERIALS.  THESE GIRLS THEMSELVES LATER 
FOUND THEMSELVES TEACHERS AND LEARNED TO READ AND 
WRITE. 
 
7.   ITEM B.  RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PCVS IN 
     FURTHERING U.S. INTERESTS IN TUNISIA 
 
PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS INCULCATE AMERICAN SOCIAL 
VALUES, EDUCATIONAL VALUES, THE WORK ETHIC, COMMUNITY 
SERVICE, AND SELF-SACRIFICE IN A WAY THAT OUR OTHER 
AGENCIES\' PROGRAMS ARE RARELY ABLE TO ACHIEVE, AND TO 
A TARGET GROUP OUTSIDE OF THE CAPITAL IN REGIONS OF 
THE COUNTRY RARELY EXPOSED TO DIRECT CONTACT WITH 
AMERICANS OR ANY FOREIGNERS. 
 
8.   ITEM C.  WAYS IN WHICH THE ROLE OF THE PEACE 
     CORPS DIFFERS FROM THE ROLE OF OTHER U.S. 
     GOVERNMENT AGENCIES/PROGRAMS IN TUNISIA 
 
TO PLAGIARIZE THE WORDS OF THE FAMOUS BEER COMMERCIAL, 
THE PEACE CORPS REFRESHES THE PARTS THAT OTHER PROGRAMS 
CANNOT REACH.  WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE SOCIAL 
IMPACT OF THE PEACE CORPS PROGRAM.  UNEXPRESSED NEEDS 
AND HIDDEN LONGINGS MAY HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEW HOPE AND 
ENCOURAGEMENT BY THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE PCVS. 
BY WHAT THEY WERE, AS MUCH AS BY WHAT THEY DID, OUR 
VOLUNTEERS DEMONSTRATED AMERICAN IDEALS AND VALUES. 
THAT UNIVERSITY EDUCATED MEN AND WOMEN WOULD LIVE IN 
SMALL TOWNS AND ACTUALLY GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY, RATHER 
THAN SEEK A CUSHY SINECURE WITH THE BUREAUCRACY OR A 
FAMILY FIRM, MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN MIND-BOGGLING. 
SHOCKING THOUGH IT WAS IN 1962-64, ONE WOMAN, PLAYING 
WITH HER PCV COLLEAGUES ON A PREVIOUSLY ALL-MALE 
BASKETBALL TEAM, MAY HAVE DONE MORE WITH HER PRESENCE 
AND THE RESPECT HER TEAMMATES SHOWED HER TO ILLUSTRATE 
THE CAPABILITIES OF WOMEN THAN A HUNDRED LECTURES 
ABOUT WOMEN\'S RIGHTS COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. 
 
 
9.   ITEM D:  THE CONTRIBUTION FORMER PEACE CORPS 
     VOLUNTEERS BRING HOME WITH THEM 
 
ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO CONSIDER THE THIRD 
GOAL OF THE PEACE CORPS IN THE SCOPE OF THIS CURRENT 
REQUEST, LET US NOT NEGLECT THE CONTRIBUTION PCVS 
BRING HOME.  MAJOR INTANGIBLE BENEFITS ACCRUE TO US 
FROM THE MULTIGENERATIONAL IMPACT RETURNING PCVS HAVE 
HAD AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ON THE POLITICAL CULTURE 
OF THE UNITED STATES. 
 
DURING THE NEARLY FOUR DECADES SINCE THE INCEPTION OF 
THE PEACE CORPS, FOREIGN TRAVEL HAS BECOME WIDELY 
AVAILABLE AND INCREASINGLY EASY AND CHEAP.  MILLIONS 
OF AMERICANS HAVE BROUGHT HOME A GLIB AND FACILE 
SURFACE FAMILIARITY WITH THE WORLD THAT IS VASTLY 
DIFFERENT FROM THE PEACE CORPS EXPERIENCE. 
 
PCVS THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN PREDOMINANTLY UNIVERSITY 
EDUCATED YOUNG ADULTS WHO MAY HAVE TAKEN FOR GRANTED 
OR HAVE BEEN NEARLY OBLIVIOUS TO THE MULTIPLICITY OF 
ELEMENTS THAT MAKE UP A SOPHISTICATED AND FREE CIVIL 
SOCIETY.  LIVING WITHOUT A FREE PRESS, A MULTI-PARTY 
POLITICAL STRUCTURE, OR TRADE UNIONS COULD HAVE BEEN 
A SALUTARY EYE OPENER.  ON THE OTHER HAND, TO HAVE 
LEARNED, UP CLOSE AND DIRTY (SOMETIMES DANGEROUSLY 
SO), THAT 
 
           \"THERE ARE NINE AND NINETY WAYS 
           OF CONSTRUCTING TRIBAL LAYS 
           AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM 
           IS RIGHT\" 
 
IS NO MEAN INSIGHT EITHER. 
 
10.  FINALLY, LET\'S NOT FORGET THE CONTINUING ROLE 
FORMER PCVS PLAY IN FOSTERING IMPROVED TIES BETWEEN 
THE UNITED STATES AND THEIR FORMER HOST NATION. 
PCVS, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE HELPED THE AMERICAN-TUNISIAN 
FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION REMAIN ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE 
OF THESE GROUPS IN WASHINGTON.  ALL IN ALL, THE PEACE 
CORPS EXPERIENCE IN TUNISIA WAS WIN-WIN FOR ALL 
CONCERNED.

1.  (C) SUMMARY.  0N JANUARY 22, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER 
ABDELWAHEB ABDALLAH T0LD AMBASSAD0R RAPHEL THE GOT 
H0PED TO USE PRESIDENT BEN ALI\'S UPCOMING VISIT T0 
WASHINGTON T0 PR0MOTE TUNISIA\'S IMAGE AS A T0LERANT, 
OPEN ISLAMIC C0UNTRY AND MODERATE, C0NSTRUCTIVE ACTOR 
ON SUCH REGI0NAL ISSUES AS THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
PROCESS (MEPP).  AMBASSADOR POINTED 0UT THAT, IN 
ADDITI0N TO THESE IMP0RTANT THEMES, HEN ALI SHOULD BE 
PREPARED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON M0RE C0NTR0VERSIAL 
ISSUES SUCH AS THE LONG-PENDING VISA REQUEST FOR THE 
DESIGNATED NEW ISRAELI INTERESTS SECTI0N HEAD. 
ABDALLAH, WHO PRAISED U.S. TRADITION OF A FREE PRESS, 
REITERATED BEN ALI\'S COMMITMENT T0 M0RE OPEN MEDIA, 
BUT CRITICIZED RESISTANCE AM0NG S0ME G0T OFFICIALS AND 
\"SELF-CENS0RING\" J0URNALISTS.  AMBASSAD0R STRESSED 
NEED FOR BEN ALI TO DISCUSS TUNISIA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
SITUATION FRANKLY AND OPENLY BEFORE U.S. AUDIENCES. 
ABDALLAH T0OKQOINT, BUT ALLEGED THAT THERE WERE 
\"MANY EXAGGERATIONS\" IN CRITICISMS BY FOREIGN NG0\'S OF 
G0T\'S HUMAN RIGHTS REC0RD.  HE CITED, AS EVIDENCE OF 
BEN ALI\'S COMMITMENT To DEMOCRATIZATION, MEASURES TO 
ENSURE MULTIPLE CANDIDATES IN THIS YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION AND TO RESERVE AT LEAST 20 PERCENT OF 
PARLIAMENTARY Q F0R THE OPPOSITION IN THE 1999 
LEGISLATIVE CONTEST. AMBASSADOR MADE A PITCH FOR 
RELEASE OF IMPRISONED TUNISIAN HUMAN RIGHTS LEAGUE HEAD 
KHEMAIS KSILA BEFORE THE PRESIDENT\'S VISIT; ABDALLAH 
INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS KSILA\'S REFUSAL TO SUBMIT 
THE REQUIRED STANDARD LETTER TO BEN ALI REQUESTING 
CLEMENCY.  IN THIS WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION, ABDALLAH 
CAME ACR0SS AS A SMOOTH, SAVVY MEMBER OF BEN ALI\'S INNER 
CIRCLE WHO DOUBTLESS WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN MOLDING BEN 
ALI\'S AGENDA FOR HIS WASHINGTON VISIT.  BIO DETAILS IN 
PARA 13.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------- 
HEN ALI\'S WASHINGTON VISIT 
-------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) IN JANUARY 22 MEETING, AMBASSADOR INFORMED GOT 
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR AND SPOKESMAN (MINISTERIAL RANK) 
ABDELWAHEB ABDALLAH THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD FIXED 
MARCH 23 AS THE DATE FOR PRESIDENT BEN ALI\'S OFFICIAL 
WORKING VISIT.  ABDALLAH, WHO CONFIRMED THAT HE WOULD 
BE A MEMBER OF BEN ALI\'S DELEGATION, INDICATED C0NCERN 
THAT THERE BE FULL MEDIA TREATMENT OF THE VISIT. 
ABDALLAH SAID HE HAD MET THE PREVI0US WEEK WITH THE 
ASSOCIATED PRESS REPRESENTATIVE IN PARIS, AND THE 
LATTER HAD EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PREPARING A PRE-VISIT 
ARTICLE 0N TUNISIA.  ABDALLAH INDICATED THAT HE WAS 
ALSO IN TOUCH WITH OTHER U.S. PUBLICATIONS CONCERNING 
POSSIBLE PIECES ON TUNISIA.  IN REMINISCING ABOUT A 
LUNCH WITH KATHRYN GRAHAM AND JIM HOAGLAND OF THE 
WASHINGTON POST SHORTLY AFTER BEN ALI ASSUMED POWER, 
HE MENTIONED POSSIBLY CONTACTING HOAGLAND AB0UT A 
FEATURE STORY. 
 
-------------------------- 
BURNISHING TUNISIA\'S IMAGE 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR 
THE GOT TO BE OPEN TO COVERAGE OF THE VISIT BY ALL 
MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES, NOT JUST A SELECT FEW.  SHE 
WENT ON TO ASK ABOUT THE GOT\'S PRINCIPAL THEMES FOR 
THE PRESIDENTIAL VISIT.  ABDALLAH RESPONDED THAT BEN 
ALI HOPED T0 USE THE VISIT TO PROMOTE TUNISIA\'S IMAGE 
AMONG THE U.S. PUBLIC AS A TOLERANT, OPEN ISLAMIC 
COUNTRY, COMMITTED TO MODERNIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT. 
ABDALLAH SAID THE VISIT WOULD HOPEFULLY HIGHLIGHT 
TUNISIA\'S TRAILBLAZING ROLE IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD IN 
TERMS OF ADVANCING THE STATUS OF WOMEN.  IN THE 
F0REIGN POLICY REALM, ACC0RDING T0 ABDALLAH, BEN ALI\'S 
U.S. SOJOURN WOULD HELP TO UNDERSCORE TUNISIA\'S ROLE 
AS A MODERATE, CONSTRUCTIVE ACTOR IN THE REGION ON 
SUCH KEY ISSUES AS THE MEPP. 
 
4.  (C) AMBASSAD0R P0INTED OUT THAT, WHILE TUNISIA\'S 
PAST EFFORTS IN SUPPORT OF MEPP WERE PRAISEWORTHY, BEN 
ALI COULD EXPECT TO BE ASKED ABOUT UNRESOLVED 
ISSUES--FOR EXAMPLE, WHY THE GOT CONTINUED TO DELAY 
ISSUANCE OF A VISA TO THE DESIGNATED NEW HEAD OF THE 
ISRAELI INTERESTS SECTION HERE.  ABDALLAH ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT THIS WAS A \"COMPLICATED\" QUESTI0N WHICH BEN ALI 
AND HIS TEAM W0ULD NEED TO BE READY TO ANSWER BEFORE 
U.S. AUDIENCES.  IN FAMILIAR GOT TERMS, HE CLAIMED 
THAT THE GOT WAS CONSTRAINED IN ITS EFFORTS T0 PROMOTE 
ITS ISRAELI RELATI0NSHIP BECAUSE 0F UNFAVORABLE PUBLIC 
OPINION HERE AND IN THE ARAB WORLD GENERALLY.  HE 
C0MPLAINED THAT, AS IT WAS, SOME IN THE ARAB WORLD 
BRANDED TUNISIA AS AN \"UN-ISLAMIC\" COUNTRY BECAUSE OF 
ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL AND ITS PROGRESSIVE 
SOCIAL POLICIES (E.G., OUTLAWING OF POLYGAMY). 
 
--------------------------------------- 
DIVISIVE REGIONAL ISSUES--MEPP AND IRAQ 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) ELABORATING, ABDALLAH STATED THAT, WHILE 
TUNISIANS BY AND LARGE SUPPORTED THE GOT\'S ENLIGHTENED 
S0CIAL POLICIES, THEY WERE DIVIDED OVER SUCH KEY 
REGIONAL ISSUES AS THE PEACE PROCESS AND IRAQ.  HE 
ADMITTED THAT SOME STAUNCHLY PRO-IRAQI LOCAL J0URNALS 
HAD BEC0ME LESS SUPPORTIVE OF IRAQ 
LATELY--DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE TYRANNICAL SADDAM 
AND THE SUFFERING IRAQI PEOPLE--BUT NONETHELESS 
REMAINED STRONGLY ANTI-U.S. POLICY IN OUTLO0K, 
REFLECTING THE VIEWS OF MANY TUNISIANS.  ABDALLAH WENT 
ON TO ASSERT THAT WERE IT NOT FOR THE SELF-CENSORSHIP 
PRACTICED BY MANY JOURNALISTS, IN ORDER TO \"AV0ID 
OFFENDING PRESIDENT BEN ALI\" BY ATTACKING A FRIENDLY 
COUNTRY, THEY WOULD BE MUCH HARSHER IN THEIR CRITICISM 
OF U.S. MIDEAST POLICY. 
 
-------------------------- 
U.S. VERSUS TUNISIAN PRESS 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT CRITICISM BY A 
FREE PRESS WAS INEVITABLE, NOTING THE OFTEN-SEVERE 
CRITICISM OF THE USG FOUND IN OUR OWN PRESS.  ABDALLAH 
RESPONDED THAT THE U.S. PRESS, BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAW 
AS ITS UNIQUE HISTORICAL ORIGINS, COULD NOT BE 
COMPARED WITH THAT IN TUNISIA OR ELSEWHERE.  HE 
OBSERVED THAT, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING DATING BACK TO 
COLONIAL TIMES, THE U.S. PRESS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BY 
ORDINARY CITIZENS INTENT ON USING THEIR NEWSPAPERS AS 
VEHICLES FOR FREE AND OPEN EXPRESSION OF VIEWS.  BY 
CONTRAST, HE ASSERTED, IN OTHER COUNTRIES RULING 
ELITES HAD \"IMPOSED FROM ABOVE\" A PRESS THAT HAS 
CIRCUMSCRIBED IN ITS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.  MOREOVER, 
HE ADDED, THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESS IN MANY 
COUNTRIES HAS NOT SO MUCH TO INFORM THE PUBLIC, AS TO 
EARN A PROFIT AS A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE--AGAIN IN 
CONTRAST TO THE U.S. EXPERIENCE. 
 
----------------------- 
SUPPORT FOR FREER MEDIA 
----------------------- 
 
7.  (C) ABDALLAH REPEATEDLY ASSERTED THAT THE GOT 
LEADERSHIP ENCOURAGED THE MEDIA TO BE MORE OPEN, BUT, 
HE INDICATED, SELF-CENSORSHIP REMAINED WIDESPREAD OUT 
OF JOURNALISTS\' CONCERN NOT TO ANTAGONIZE THAT 
LEADERSHIP.  ABDALLAH DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME 
UNNAMED GOT OFFICIALS, WHILE PAYING LIP SERVICE TO THE 
NEED FOR EXPANDED MEDIA FREEDOMS, NONETHELESS 
PROTESTED STRENUOUSLY WHEN THEY THEMSELVES WERE 
AFFECTED BY NEGATIVE TELEVISION OR PRESS COVERAGE. 
(COMMENT:  ABDALLAH DOUBTLESS WAS REFERRING TO 
NEGATIVE REPORTING ABOUT GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, NOT 
SPECIFIC OFFICIALS, AS MEDIA CRITICISM OF OFFICIALS BY 
NAME OR POSITION IS NON-EXISTENT.  END COMMENT.) 
ACCORDING TO ABDALLAH, PRESIDENT BEN ALI HIMSELF WANTS 
TO SEE MORE OPENNESS IN THE MEDIA AND FORBIDS MEMBERS 
OF HIS IMMEDIATE STAFF FROM CONTACTING JOURNALS TO 
PROTEST OFFENDING ARTICLES.  ABDALLAH GAVE ASSURANCES 
THAT THE GOT PRESIDENCY WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR 
FREER TUNISIAN MEDIA IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION BY SOME 
IN THE GOVERNMENT.  HE STRESSED WHAT HE SAW AS THE 
CRUCIAL ROLE PLAYED BY OPPOSITION PARTY JOURNALS IN 
PROMOTING A FREE PRESS, SAYING THE GOT LEADERSHIP 
ENCOURAGED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH JOURNALS, WITH WHAT 
HE DESCRIBED AS THEIR MORE OPEN REPORTING, IN AN 
EFFORT TO WHITTLE DOWN THE PRACTICE OF SELF-CENSORSHIP 
BY THE MEDIA GENERALLY. 
 
------------ 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
------------ 
 
8.  (C) AMBASSAD0R SAID THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR BEN 
ALI TO DISCUSS FRANKLY AND OPENLY TUNISIA\'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS SITUATION DURING HIS U.S. VISIT.  ABDALLAH TOOK 
THIS ON BOARD AND REMARKED THAT FOREIGN NGO\'S AND 
OTHERS HAD VOICED \"MANY EXAGGERATIONS\" IN CRITICIZING 
THE GOT\'S RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS.  HE CITED 
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT POLITICAL PRISONERS HERE AS A CASE 
IN POINT, MAINTAINING THAT THEY WERE NOT BEING HELD 
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR VIEWS, BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE 
TYPICALLY ISLAMIST EXTREMISTS CONVICTED BY THE COURTS 
0F COMMITING ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR BEING INVOLVED IN 
PLOTTING SUCH ACTS.  AMBASSADOR RESP0NDED THAT, WHILE 
RESORTING TO, OR ESPOUSING VIOLENCE AS A P0LITICAL 
TOOL WAS UNACCEPTABLE IN ANY SOCIETY, THE FREEDOM TO 
CRITICIZE AND EXPRESS DISSENTING VIEWS, WHETHER BY 
ISLAMISTS OR OTHERS, NEEDED T0 BE RESPECTED.  ABDALLAH 
REJOINED THAT, FOR THE GOT, THERE WERE NO \"MODERATE 
ISLAMISTS\" WILLING TO ACCEPT DEMOCRATIC N0RMS; 
INSTEAD, THE GOT\'S EXPERIENCE WAS THAT ISLAMISTS, EVEN 
IF PROFESSING SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY, ACTUALLY REJECTED 
IT AND SOUGHT TO IMPOSE AN AUTHORITARIAN ISLAMIC 
STATE. 
 
9.  (C) AMBASSAD0R POINTED OUT THAT FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION AND DEBATE WAS KEY TO ANY EFFORT TO 
DEMOCRATIZE A POLITICAL SYSTEM, DESPITE INEVITABLE 
ABUSES 0F THESE FREEDOMS BY S0ME.  ABDALLAH REITERATED 
THE GOT\'S COMMITMENT T0 DEMOCRATIZATION, CITING BEN 
ALI\'S INITIATIVES, NOW ENSHRINED IN LEGISLATI0N, TO 
ENSURE MULTIPLE CANDIDATES IN THE 1999 PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTIONS AS WELL AS A MINIMUM OF 20 PERCENT OF 
PARLIAMENTARY SEATS FOR OPPOSITION CANDIDATES IN THIS 
YEAR\'S LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS.  ABDALLAH ADDED THAT THE 
GOT\'S COMMITMENT TO UNDERTAKE DEMOCRATIC REFORMS UNDER 
ITS ASSOCIATI0N AGREEMENT WITH THE EUR0PEAN UNION 
REFLECTED ITS \"STRATEGIC CHOICE\" IN FAVOR OF OPEN 
POLITICAL, AS WELL AS ECONOMIC, SYSTEMS. 
 
-------------- 
THE KSILA CASE 
-------------- 
 
10.  (C) AMBASSADOR RAISED THE CASE OF TUNISIAN HUMAN 
RIGHTS LEAGUE VICE PRESIDENT KHEMAIS KSILA, IMPRISONED 
SINCE FEBRUARY 1998 FOLLOWING ARREST AND CONVICTION IN 
COURT FOR CIRCULATING AN ANTI-GOT COMMUNIQUE.  NOTING 
THE QUESTIONABLE GROUNDS FOR KSILA\'S PROSECUTION, 
AMBASSADOR URGED THAT THE GOT LOOK FOR WAYS TO RELEASE 
THE ACTIVIST, POINTING OUT THAT DOING SO PRIOR TO BEN 
ALI\'S WASHINGTON VISIT WOULD BE ESPECIALLY NOTICED BY 
U.S. AUDIENCES.  ABDALLAH RESPONDED, ALONG STANDARD 
GOT LINES, THAT KSILA HAD BEEN PROSECUTED AND 
CONVICTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH TUNISIAN LAW.  (COMMENT: 
IN FACT, THERE WERE SEVERAL IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING 
THE GOT SWITCHING JUDGES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRIAL.) 
NONETHELESS, HE INDICATED THAT THE GOT WOULD BE 
PREPARED TO CONSIDER GRANTING HIM EARLY RELEASE UNDER 
A CLEMENCY ARRANGEMENT SIMILAR TO THAT EXTENDED TO 
OTHER PRISONERS.  THE RUB, ACCORDING TO ABDALLAH, WAS 
THAT SO FAR KSILA HAD REFUSED TO SUBMIT THE STANDARD 
LETTER TO HEN ALI, REQUESTING CLEMENCY, REQUIRED OF 
ALL PRISONERS SEEKING EARLY RELEASE.  ABDALLAH CLAIMED 
THAT WHILE KSILA\'S WIFE HAD URGED HIM TO SUBMIT THE 
LETTER, HE STUBBORNLY REFUSED.  WHEN AMBASSADOR ASKED 
WHY, ABDALLAH RESPONDED THAT KSILA HAD AN OBSTINATE 
CHARACTER AND PERHAPS WISHED TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS A 
MARTYR.  IN RESPONSE T0 AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY, ABDALLAH 
FLATLY DISMISSED KISILA AS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE 
BEN ALI GOVERNMENT, SAYING KSILA HAD NO SIGNIFICANT 
FOLLOWING IN POLITICAL CIRCLES. 
 
-------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  (C) ABDALLAH, WIDELY VIEWED AS A KEY MEMBER OF 
THE PRESIDENT\'S INNER CIRCLE, HAS SERVED IN HIS 
CURRENT POSITION SINCE DECEMBER 1990.  LIKE OTHER 
SENIOR ADVISERS TO BEN ALI, ABDALLAH MAINTAINS A LOW 
PUBLIC PROFILE; DESPITE THE TITLE OF PRESIDENTIAL 
SPOKESMAN, HE RARELY MAKES PUBLIC PRON0UNCEMENTS. 
ABDALLAH IS REGARDED BY SOME TUNISIAN AND DIPLOMATIC 
CONTACTS AS A SHADOWY FIGURE, ORCHESTRATING SECRETIVE, 
AUTHORITARIAN TENDENCIES WITH THE HEN ALI GOVERNMENT. 
HOWEVER, HE PROJECTED A FAR DIFFERENT IMAGE IN HIS 
CONVERSATI0N WITH THE AMBASSADOR, COMING ACROSS AS 
SM0OTH, SELF-CONFIDENT, AND ENGAGING INTERLOCUT0R.  HE 
SEEMED WELL-DISP0SED T0WARD THE U.S., RECALLING WARMLY 
HIS DEALINGS OVER THE YEARS WITH A SUCCESSION OF U.S. 
AMBASSAD0RS, JOURNALISTS, AND 0THERS.  ABDALLAH 
APPEARED TO BE WELL-INFORMED ABOUT THE U.S. MEDIA 
ESTABLISHMENT; HE SPOKE FONDLY OF A 1987 MEETING HERE, 
AS INFORMATI0N MINISTER, WITH THE WASHINGTON POST\'S 
KATHRYN GRAHAM.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THE 
ABILITY OF ABDALLAH AND HEN ALI TO IMPLEMENT A SERIOUS 
COMMITMENT TO A MORE OPEN MEDIA, ASSUMING THEY HAVE 
SUCH A COMMITMENT; VARIOUS CONTACTS HAVE ALLEGED THAT 
IT IS ABDALLAH HIMSELF, NOT OTHER UNNAMED OFFICIALS HE 
CITED, WHO IS RESISTANT TO A FREER TUNISIAN MEDIA. 
 
12.  (C) ABDALLAH\'S PREDICTABLY EXAGGERATED PORTRAYAL 
OF BEN ALI AS ENERGETIC, REFORM-MINDED LEADER 0F A 
MODERNIZING, TOLERANT ISLAMIC COUNTRY SERVED AS A 
FORETASTE OF THE GOT\'S MEDIA CAMPAIGN SURROUNDING THE 
UPCOMING WASHINGT0N VISIT.  ABDALLAH SEEMS TO REALIZE, 
THOUGH, THAT PROMOTING THIS PRESIDENTIAL IMAGE WILL 
REQUIRE BEN ALI TO BE ARTICULATE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD 
IN ADDRESSING THE TOUGHER ISSUES BEF0RE U.S. 
AUDIENCES--SUCH AS THE G0T\'S LESS-THAN-PERFECT HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD AND THE GOT\'S FAILURE OF LATE TO BE AS 
SUPPORTIVE AS IN THE PAST OF U.S. EFFORTS ON THE 
MEPP.  END C0MMENT. 
 
13.  (C) BIO DETAILS:  ABDALLAH, BORN IN 1940, WAS 
EDUCATED AS A LAWYER IN FRANCE.  HE IS A VETERAN 
JOURNALIST AND ACTIVIST IN THE RULING PARTY.  PRIOR TO 
HIS CURRENT POSITION, HE SERVED AS AMBASSAD0R TO 
BRITAIN (1988-90) AND INFORMATI0N MINISTER (1987-88). 
AMONG HIS EARLIER POSITIONS:  DIRECTOR OF TUNISIA\'S 
NATI0NAL PRESS SERVICE (1986-87), PUBLISHER OF 
FRENCH-LANGUAGE DAILY \"LA PRESSE DE TUNISIE\" 
(1979-86), AND CHIEF OF STAFF TO INFORMATION MINISTER 
(1978-79) AND TO CULTURE MINISTER (1976-78).  ALTHOUGH 
HE APPEARS TO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, HE C0NVERSED WITH 
AMBASSADOR IN FRENCH; HE ALSO SPEAKS ARABIC.

------------------- 
SUMMARY AND C0MMENT 
------------------- 
 
1.  (S)  IMMEDIATE SUCCESSI0N ISSUES ARE LESS 0F A C0NCERN IN 
TUNISIA THAN S0ME 0THER C0UNTRIES IN THE REGI0N.  GIVEN HIS 
R0BUST HEALTH, THE 62-YEAR-0LD BEN ALI IS EXPECTED ALC (##)F0URTH 
TERM OF OFFICE UNTIL WELL INT0 HIS THIRD.  IN THE CASE 
0F THE DEATH 0R INCAPACITATI0N 0F BEN ALI, THE C0NSTITUTI0N 
CALLS F0R THE PRESIDENT 0F THE CHAMBER 0F DEPUTIES T0 BE 
APP0INTED AS A INTERIM PRESIDENT WITH LIMITED P0WERS UNTIL NEW 
ELECTI0NS CAN BE SCHEDULED.  THIS W0ULD PR0BABLY BE F0LL0WED 
SCRUPUL0USLY, GIVEN RULING PARTY DISCIPLINE AND L0YALTY AND 
TUNISIA\'S LARGELY AP0LITICAL. H0M0GENE0US P0PULATI0N.  WHILE 
RULING PA\"QM[BW9VQB THAT THE LACKLUSTER 
OPPOSITION FIGURES WOULD POSE ANY SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO THE 
POWERFUL (AND POPULAR) RCD PARTY MACHINE.  MOREOVER, THE ONCE 
STRONG ISLAMIC MOVEMENT REMAINS TOO WEAK TO THREATEN AN 
RCD-ANNOINTED SUCCESSOR TO BEN ALI IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  THE 
MILITARY DOES NOT PLAY AN INDEPENDENT POLITICAL ROLE.  IN 
SHORT, WE DO NOT SEE SUCCESSION POSING ANY SERIOUS THREAT TO 
TUNISIA\'S INTERNAL STABILITY OR ITS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE 
UNITED STATES.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
BEN ALI:  IN VIGOROUS HEALTH, 
HE CAN SERVE OUT A NEW FIVE-YEAR TERM -- AND BEYOND? 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
REPORTEDLY DYING, PREDECESSOR.  ALL EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT BEN 
ALI, UP FOR RE-ELECTION ON OCTOBER 24, WILL BE ABLE TO SERVE 
OUT HIS THIRD FIVE-YEAR TERM AS PRESIDENT.  (BEN ALI HAS BEEN 
IN OFFICE SINCE NOVEMBER 1987, BUT IN THE PERIOD BEFORE 1989 
ELECTIONS HE WAS FINISHING OUT BOURGUIBA\'S FINAL TERM.) 
 
3.  (S)  WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CURRENT HEALTH CONSTRAINTS 
WHICH WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM SERVING WELL BEYOND THAT TERM\'S 
EXPIRATION IN 2004, ALTHOUGH A FOURTH TERM WOULD REQUIRE A 
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.  THIS WOULD NOT LIKELY BE AN OBSTACLE, 
AS BEN ALI\'S RULING RCD PARTY WILL CONTROL ENOUGH SEATS IN THE 
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AFTER THE OCTOBER 1999 ELECTIONS TO AMEND 
THE CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW BEN ALI TO RUN AGAIN, OR HE COULD USE 
A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION ALLOWING PLEBISCITES FOR ISSUES 
OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE TO ARRANGE FOR \"POPULAR DEMAND.\"  BUT 
WELL-INFORMED TUNISIANS ARE DIVIDED OVER WHETHER, IN FACT, BEN 
ALI WOULD WANT A FOURTH TERM IN OFFICE, AND HE HIMSELF MAY NOT 
BE SURE.  GIVEN HIS CAUTIOUS TEMPERAMENT AND DESIRE TO WEIGH 
ALL MAJOR DECISIONS CAREFULLY, TOGETHER WITH HIS CONCERN NOT TO 
BECOME A \"LAME DUCK\" PREMATURELY, THE ODDS ARE THAT BEN ALI 
WILL NOT REVEAL HIS HAND UNTIL WELL INTO HIS NEXT TERM OF 
OFFICE. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
LEGAL MECHANISMS FOR SUCCESSION IN PLACE: 
WEAK INTERIM PRESIDENT TO OVERSEE ELECTIONS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (U)  IF THE TUNISIAN PRESIDENT DIES IN OFFICE OR IS SUBJECT 
TO TOTAL INCAPACITATION (\"EMPECHEMENT ABSOLU\"), ARTICLE 57 OF 
THE TUNISIAN CONSTITUTION STIPULATES THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES WILL ASSUME THE FUNCTIONS OF PRESIDENT \"PAR 
INTERIM\" FOR A PERIOD WHICH MAY VARY BETWEEN 45 AND 60 DAYS.  A 
POSITION WEAK BY DESIGN, THE INTERIM PRESIDENT IS RESTRICTED 
FROM PERFORMING SOME FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS DISSOLVING PARLIAMENT, 
CALLING FOR REFERENDUMS, OR DISMISSING THE GOVERNMENT.  THE 
INTERIM PRESIDENT IS TO OVERSEE ELECTIONS WHICH WILL ELECT THE 
NEW PRESIDENT FOR A FULL FIVE-YEAR MANDATE.  EVEN IF THE 
INTERIM PRESIDENT RESIGNS, HE IS NOT PERMITTED TO RUN IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. 
 
5.  (C)  BEFORE THIS SUCCESSION ARRANGEMENT WAS INSTITUTED VIA 
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON JULY 25, 1988, THE TUNISIAN 
CONSTITUTION STIPULATED THAT ALL POWERS AND DUTIES WOULD 
DEVOLVE TO THE PRIME MINISTER IN THE CASE OF DEATH OF 
INCAPACITATION OF THE PRESIDENT, AND THAT THE PRIME MINISTER 
WOULD SERVE AS PRESIDENT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
TERM.  THIS CLAUSE WAS INVOKED ON NOVEMBER 7, 1987, WHEN 
THEN-PRIME MINISTER BEN ALI NUDGED ASIDE BOURGUIBA, WHO WAS 
DECLARED BY DOCTORS AS MENTALLY UNFIT TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE, IN 
THE BLOODLESS COUP NOW KNOWN IN ARABIC AS \"THE BLESSED 
CHANGE.\" 
 
6.  (S)  IN THE EVENT OF THE DEATH OR INCAPACITATION OF THE 
PRESIDENT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS 
EXPLAINED ABOVE WOULD BE SCRUPULOUSLY FOLLOWED, AS WOULD 
PROVISIONS FOR ELECTIONS SHOULD BEN ALI STEP DOWN IN 2004, AS 
THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES.  ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THERE WILL BE 
ELECTIONS, AND THE RCD-ANNOINTED CANDIDATE WILL LIKELY WIN 
(EVEN IF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN PERIOD AND ELECTIONS PASSED OUR 
MOST RIGOROUS TEST OF \"FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS\"):  THE RULING 
RCD PARTY AND MILITARY/POLICE ARE VERY WELL DISCIPLINED AND 
DEV0TED T0 THE CURRENT STRUCTURE AND ARE LIKELY T0 F0CUS 0N A 
SINGLE CANDIDATE RATHER THAN SPLINTERING INT0 RIVAL GR0UPS. 
THE PARTY REMAINS P0PULAR, AS M0ST TUNISIANS CREDIT IT F0R 
BRINGING PR0SPERITY AND STABILTY.  (A SHARP RISE IN 
UNEMPL0YMENT 0R SERI0US EC0N0MIC RECESSI0N C0ULD CHANGE THE 
F0RMULA, BUT S0 FAR EC0N0MIC GR0WTH REMAINS S0LID.) 
 
7.  (S)  M0RE0VER, THE GENERALLY AP0LITICAL TUNISIAN P0PULATI0N 
IS H0M0GENE0US AND FREE 0F ETHNIC/RELIGI0US/TRIBAL DIFFERENCES 
WHICH IN S0ME C0UNTRIES HAS LED T0 M0RE LIVELY P0LITICS 0R 
D0MESTIC INSTABILITY.  THE 0NCE STR0NG ISLAMIC 0PP0SITI0N IS 
WEAK, ITS LEADERS EXILED 0R IN PRIS0N, AND IN N0 P0SITI0N T0 
TAKE ADVANTAGE 0F A SUCCESSI0N.  THE LEGAL 0PP0SITI0N PARTIES 
WILL INCREASE THEIR PRESENCE IN THE CHAMBER 0F DEPUTIES AFTER 
0CT0BER ELECTI0NS BECAUSE 0F A C0NSTITUTI0N CHANGE INITIATED BY 
BEN ALI T0 RESERVE 20 PERCENT 0F CHAMBER SEATS F0R 0PP0SITI0N 
PARTIES.  H0WEVER, THEY ARE IN N0 P0SITI0N T0 WIN THE 
PRESIDENCY IN ELECTI0NS AGAINST THE WELL 0RGANIZED AND P0PULAR 
RCD -- N0R D0 THEY HAVE THE ABILITY T0 SEIZE THE REINS 0F 
G0VERNMENT BY F0RCE.  IN SH0RT, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A SUDDENLY 
VACATED PRESIDENCY W0ULD LEAD T0 CHA0S, BECAUSE THERE IS N0 
APPARENT BASIS F0R`KL[_QUAN 0BVI0US SUCCESS0R BY NAME. IN FACT, 
FOR RCD (##)G0T 0FFICIALS T0 ACCUMULATE T00 MUCH P0WER IN THEIR 
HANDS IS N0T A CAREER-ENHANCING M0VE:MANY PE0PLE THINK THAT THE 
RECENT REM0VAL 0F FINANCE MINISTER JERI AND ENVIR0NMENT MINISTER 
STEMMED AT LEAST IN PART FR0M THEIR INDEPENDENT P0WER BASES (AS 
MLIKA WELL AS PLAUSIBLE ALLEGATI0NS 0F C0RRUPTI0N).  INDEED, AM0NG 
THE CURRENT CR0P 0F G0T MINISTERS, M0ST ARE TECHN0CRATS WH0 
R0SE THR0UGH THE BUREAUCRACY AND N0T P0LITICIANS WITH P0WER AND 
P0PULARITY IN THEIR 0WN RIGHT.  JUSTICE MINISTER KALLEL, 0NCE 
AN EXTREMELY CL0SE C0NFIDANT T0 BEN ALI, WAS RUM0RED T0 HAVE 
BEC0ME S0 STR0NG IN HIS PREVI0US P0SITI0N AS AN ADVIS0R T0 THE 
PRESIDENT THAT HE WAS \"SIDELINED\" T0 A MINISTRY WHERE HIS 
RESP0NSIBILITIES WERE M0RE NARR0WLY DRAWN.  THE PRIME MINISTER 
IS A MUCH WEAKER P0SITI0N THAN IT WAS WHEN BEN ALI WAS IN THAT 
0FFICE. 
 
9.  (C)  TODAY, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORS MOHAMED JEGHAM AND 
ABDELWAHEB ABDALLAH ARE PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL IN BEN ALI\'S 
IMMEDIATE CIRCLE, BUT THEY, TOO, DERIVE THEIR POWER FROM BEN 
ALI AND DO NOT ENJOY THE SORT OF INDEPENDENT POWER BASE WHICH 
BEN ALI HAD BEFORE THE NOVEMBER 7, 1987 COUP.  OF THE 
MINISTERS, MINISTER OF DEFENSE HABIB BEN YAHIA HAS SUCCEEDED IN 
PLACING PROTEGES AS BOTH MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND HEAD 
OF THE RCD, BUT HE IS A CAREER DIPLOMAT, NOT A POLITICIAN. 
MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT FAIZA KEFI IS ONE OF THE MOST 
AMBITIOUS, SAVVY POLITICIANS WE KNOW, BUT TUNISIA, FOR ALL ITS 
PROGRESSIVE POLICIES, IS NOT READY FOR A WOMAN PRESIDENT. 
WHILE MRS. BEN ALI HAS MANAGED TO INSERT CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS 
INTO INFLUENTIAL POSITIONS. THE RESULTING CORRUPTION, TOLERATED 
WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS BY BEN ALI, HAS LED TO REVULSION AMONG 
MANY TUNISIANS.  THEREFORE, WE STRONGLY DOUBT ANY OF HER 
RELATIVES WOULD GET THE BLESSING OF THE RCD LEADERSHIP TO 
SUCCEED BEN ALI. 
 
----------------------------------- 
NO SERIOUS THREAT TO U.S. INTERESTS 
----------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO OBVIOUS HEIR 
APPARENT WHO WOULD SERVE AS AN RCD CANDIDATE IN SUCCESSION 
ELECTIONS, WE DO NOT ENVISION A SERIOUS THREAT TO U.S. 
INTERESTS IN TUNISIA\'S EVENTUAL TRANSITION FROM THE BEN ALI 
ERA.  TUNISIANS ARE GENERALLY PLEASED WITH THE DIRECTION OF 
THEIR COUNTRY, AND ANY FORSEEABLE SUCCESSOR TO BEN ALI CAN 
EXPECT TO FACE STRONG RESISTANCE FROM BOTH ELITES AND THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC TO ANY ATTEMPT TO DEVIATE FROM TUNISIA\'S 
MODERATE POLICIES AND ITS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED 
STATES AND EUROPE.  WHAT WE HOPE TO SEE BY THE TIME OF ANY 
SUCCESSION IS A BROADER AND DEEPER DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  WE 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO USE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE THE GOT 
TO EXPAND PLURALISM AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PRESS, IN 
ORDER TO GIVE THE GENERALLY MODERATE AND PRO-WESTERN TUNISIAN 
CITIZENS THE OPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN, AND REINFORCE, A 
SMOOTH SUCCESSION OF POWER THAT REFLECTS DEMOCRATIC NORMS.

WHICH THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY RECEIVED FROM OTHER SOURCES). 
MORE DETAILS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE COMING DAYS, AND WE

FINANCE TAOUFIK BACCAR, MINISTER OF CULTURE ABDELBAKI

IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT KEY INTERLOCUTORS HAVE SIMPLY CHANGED 
PORTFOLIOS, SUCH AS FOREIGN MINISTER HABIB BEN YAHIA AND

WORKING WITH THE NEW PRIME MINISTER IN HIS PREVIOUS POSITION.

SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT SHAKE-UP:  OBSERVERS SEE INCREASINGLY 
TECHNOCRATIC CABINET AS SIGN OF BEN ALI\'S TIGHT GRIP ON 
DECISION-MAKING. 
 
REF: TUNIS 191 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  IN NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS SINCE THE JANUARY 23 
GOVERNMENT RESHUFFLING (REFTEL), TUNISIAN AND DIPLOMATIC 
OBSERVERS HAVE ALMOST INVARIABLY DESCRIBED THE SHAKE-UP AS 
SOMETHING OF A GAME OF MUSICAL CHAIRS AND A SIGN OF PRESIDENT 
BEN ALI\'S FIRM PERSONAL CONTROL OVER THE POLITICAL SITUATION 
IN THE COUNTRY.  SEVERAL HAVE DESCRIBED THE SHIFTS AS 
INDICATING THAT THE CABINET IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY 
TECHNOCRATIC, BUT ARE OF TWO MINDS ABOUT THE IMPLICATION OF 
THIS.  ON ONE HAND, MINISTERS AND, ESPECIALLY, SECRETARIES OF 
STATE (JUNIOR MINISTERS) ARE INCREASINGLY INDIVIDUALS WHO 
HAVE COME UP THROUGH THE BUREAUCRACY AND ARE SEEN AS 
COMPETENT IN THEIR FIELD, A PLUS FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF PROGRAMS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT MEANS, ACCORDING TO 
SOME OBSERVERS, THAT THEY ARE ONLY IMPLEMENTERS OF POLICY 
DECISIONS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT, NOT DECISION-MAKERS OR 
POLITICAL FIGURES THEMSELVES, MEANING A GREATER CONSOLIDATION 
OF POLITICAL DECISIONS IN BEN ALI\'S HANDS.  WE SHARE THE 
ASSESSMENT OF MANY THAT THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FIGURES IN THE 
TUNISIAN LEADERSHIP ARE OUTSIDE THE CABINET.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------- 
INCREASINGLY TECHNOCRATIC 
CABINET--FOR BETTER OR WORSE 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE SPECULATION ABOUT 
PRESIDENT BEN ALI\'S JANUARY 23 GOVERNMENT RESHUFFLING, IN 
WHICH THREE SENIOR MINISTERS LEFT GOVERNMENT, NINE MOVED 
LATERALLY TO OTHER POSITIONS, AND 11 NEW JUNIOR MINISTER 
POSITIONS WERE CREATED (FOR A TOTAL OF 30 FULL MINISTERS AND 
24 JUNIOR MINISTERS).  SOME OBSERVERS, BOTH TUNISIAN AND 
FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, DESCRIBED THE CHANGES AS LITTLE MORE THAN 
MUSICAL CHAIRS, BUT MANY SAW A PURPOSE BEHIND THE JUGGLING. 
AN EGYPTIAN EMBASSY OFFICER AND FRENCH EMBASSY POLITICAL 
COUNSELOR EACH OPINED THAT BEN ALI ENGAGED IN SUCH JUGGLING 
BOTH IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE REMAINS FULLY IN CHARGE 
AND, ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE, TO GIVE BROADER EXPERIENCE IN 
GOVERNMENT TO SEASONED MINISTERS.  WHILE BOTH COLLEAGUES 
PRAISED THE COMPETENCE AND EXPERTISE OF THE INCREASINGLY 
TECHNOCRATIC CABINET, THEY SAW IT AS A CLEAR SIGN THAT ALL 
POLICY DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THE PRESIDENT IN CONSULTATION 
WITH A CLOSE CIRCLE OF ADVISERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT 
MINISTERS.  THE MINISTERS ARE THERE TO IMPLEMENT DECISIONS 
MADE ELSEWHERE. 
 
3.  (C)  ALONG THE SAME LINES, TAIEB ZAHAR, PUBLISHER OF THE 
WEEKLY INDEPENDENT MAGAZINE, \"REALITES,\" TOLD LABATT THAT HE 
SEES THE LATEST RESHUFFLING AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF BEN ALI\'S 
GRADUAL MOVE TO FILL THE CABINET WITH TECHNOCRATS WHO ARE 
GOOD AT IMPLEMENTING DECISIONS BUT PLAY NO REAL POLITICAL 
ROLE.  HE SAID THAT WITH THE DEPARTURE FROM THE CABINET OF 
MINISTER OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS, CHADLI NEFFATI, THERE WAS 
VIRTUALLY NO ONE LEFT (EXCEPT MINISTER OF DEFENSE DALY JAZI 
AND MINISTER OF EDUCATION,  MONDER ROUISSI) WHO CAME INTO THE 
CABINET FROM OUTSIDE THE BUREAUCRACY.  THERE IS NO ONE, HE 
ARGUED, WHO ROSE THROUGH A PRIVATE ASSOCIATION (COMMENT:  THE 
TWO WOMEN MINISTERS ARE AN EXCEPTION, AS THEY ROSE THROUGH 
THE RCD-AFFILIATED NATIONAL UNION OF TUNISIAN WOMEN.  END 
COMMENT), THE LABOR UNION MOVEMENT, OR EVEN BUSINESS.   ZAHAR 
ARGUED THAT, EVEN IN OTHER NON-DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES, ONE CAN 
SEE WITHIN A CABINET EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL TENDENCIES OR 
\"FIEFDOMS,\" WHETHER REGIONAL OR PERSONAL, BUT THAT BEN ALI 
HAS VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED ANYONE\'S ABILITY TO BUILD ANY 
INDEPENDENT POLITICAL OR EVEN REGIONAL LOYALTIES.  ZAHAR 
ARGUED THAT TECHNOCRATS ARE IMPORTANT TO IMPLEMENT THE 
POLICY, BUT THAT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD 
BE IN THE MINISTERIAL MIX AS WELL. 
 
---------------- 
OUT IS NEVER OUT 
---------------- 
 
4. (C) WHILE MANY FOREIGN PRESS REPORTS ON THE SHAKE-UP 
FOCUSED ON THE DEPARTURE OF FORMER MINISTER OF INTERIOR 
ABDULLAH KALLEL OR THE MOVEMENT OF DALY JAZI FROM 
PRESIDENTIAL COUNSELOR TO THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE (NOT 
CONSIDERED BY SOME A KEY PORTFOLIO BECAUSE, IN THIS VIEW, 
PROFESSIONAL, APOLITICAL MILITARY OFFICERS IN SENIOR 
POSITIONS ACTUALLY RUN THE MINISTRY), TUNISIAN OBSERVERS 
GENERALLY DISMISS EFFORTS TO INTERPRET THESE MOVES AS 
INDICATIVE OF AN INDIVIDUAL\'S RISE OR FALL IN FAVOR.  MANY 
CURRENT AND FORMER GOVERNMENT MINISTERS HAVE MOVED IN AND OUT 
OF THE CABINET OVER THE YEARS.  OBSERVERS HAVE NOTED THAT 
THIS FOLLOWS BEN ALI\'S DESIRE TO KEEP PEOPLE MOVING.  ZAHAR 
AND MONDER KALAI, A PRESS OFFICER AT THE MINISTRY OF 
EDUCATION, IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION, EACH SAID HE BELIEVED 
THAT BEN ALI WAS IN FACT MOVING SOME OF HIS CLOSEST 
COUNSELORS OUT OF MINISTERIAL POSITIONS SO THAT THEY COULD 
FOCUS ON ADVISING HIM WITHOUT BEING BURDENED BY THE 
DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS OF A MINISTRY.  ZAHAR CITED KALLEL AS 
AN EXAMPLE:  HE REMAINS A CLOSE SECURITY ADVISER TO BEN ALI, 
BUT AS MINISTER OF INTERIOR WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE GOVERNORS AND 
DISTRICT COMMISSIONERS, ALL OF WHOM REPORT UP TO THE 
MINISTER.  KALAI WENT FURTHER, REFERRING TO BEN ALI\'S 
ADVISORS AS HIS \"SHADOW CABINET,\" AND NAMED KALLEL, JAZY, 
PRESIDENTIAL MINISTER/COUNSELOR ABDELAZIZ BEN DHIA, AND 
PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ABDELWAHAB ABDULLAH AS AMONG THOSE WHO 
PLAY KEY ROLES IN ASSISTING BEN ALI IN ARRIVING AT DECISIONS. 
  THIS WOULD TRACK WITH THE NOVEMBER 1999 DECISION TO MOVE 
FORMER PRIME MINISTER HAMED KAROUI TO THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE 
(BUT VERY SENIOR) POSITION OF VICE PRESIDENT OF THE RCD, 
APPOINTING ECONOMIC TECHNOCRAT MOHAMED GHANNOUCHI (WHO ONLY 
RECENTLY JOINED THE POLITBURO OF THE RCD) TO RUN THE 
GOVERNMENT AS PRIME MINISTER. 
 
----------------- 
SPECULATION ABOUT 
PLANNING FOR 2004 
----------------- 
 
5.  (C) ZAHAR CITED ANOTHER FACTOR IN THE GOVERNMENT 
RESHUFFLING AND THE SHAKE-UP IN LEADERSHIP AT THE RULING 
PARTY THAT OCCURRED THE SAME WEEK:  PLANNING FOR THE 2004 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  IN THE LAST MONTH OR TWO SEVERAL 
OPPOSITION LEADERS, RANGING FROM ISMAIL BOULAHIA OF THE 
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT (MDS) AND MOHAMED BOUCHIHA OF THE 
POPULAR UNITY PARTY (BOTH SEEN AS CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT) TO 
RACHID KHACHANA OF THE PROGRESSIVE SOCIALIST RALLY (RSP) HAVE 
TOLD LABATT THAT THEY BELIEVE BEN ALI IS PREPARING THE GROUND 
WORK FOR A POPULAR REFERENDUM EXEMPTING HIM FROM THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL THREE-TERM LIMIT AND \"DEMANDING\" THAT HE RUN 
FOR A FOURTH (ELECTED) TERM IN 2004.  UNDER THIS ANALYSIS, 
ACCORDING TO BOTH ZAHAR AND KELAI (AND THE OPPOSITION 
LEADERS) BEN ALI IS GATHERING AROUND HIMSELF THE PEOPLE WHO 
WOULD ORGANIZE THIS MOVE POLITICALLY AND JURIDICALLY.  ZAHAR 
CITED BEN DHIA (WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES AS CHIEF OF STAFF WERE 
SPLIT OFF TO AHMED IYADH OEDERNI) AS THE \"LAWYER\" WHO WOULD 
MAKE SURE ALL WAS DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, WHILE 
KALLEL PLAYS HIS TRADITIONAL ROLE OF \"ENFORCER\" (ASSISTED BY 
SECRETARY OF STATE GHANZOUI, WHO REMAINS NUMBER TWO AT THE 
MINISTRY) TO PREVENT DISSENT WITHIN THE PARTY OR OTHER RANKS. 
 
------------------------ 
RUMORS ABOUT PERSONAL/ 
REGIONAL TIES TO BEN ALI 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) AS WITH ALL DEVELOPMENTS IN TUNISIA, THERE HAS BEEN A 
WEALTH OF SPECULATION AND RUMOR ABOUT ALLEGED TIES CERTAIN 
INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO THE PRESIDENT, HIS WIFE, OR HIS HOME 
REGION OF SOUSSE.  CONTACTS RANGING FROM EMBASSY FSN\'S TO 
EUROPEAN AMBASSADORS HAVE ATTRIBUTED ABDERAHIM ZOUARI\'S 
STICKING POWER (JUST NAMED AS MINISTER OF YOUTH AND SPORTS, 
HE HAS BEEN SHIFTED FROM MINISTRY TO MINISTRY AND WAS 
SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE RCD UNTIL DECEMBER 2000), DESPITE 
LESS THAN STELLAR PERFORMANCES, TO THE FACT THAT HE SERVED AS 
AMBASSADOR TO MOROCCO WHEN BEN ALI WAS MILITARY ATTACHE THERE 
IN THE 1970\'S.  THE GENERAL ASSUMPTION (USUALLY STATED AS 
\"FACT\") IS THAT ZOUARI MUST HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT BEN ALI\'S 
PERSONAL LIFE.  TUNISIAN AND DIPLOMATIC OBSERVERS HAVE 
REFERRED ALSO TO A POSSIBLE FAMILY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BEN 
ALI AND THE NEW GOVERNOR OF THE CENTRAL BANK, AND BETWEEN 
MRS. BEN ALI AND THE NEW DIRECTOR OF TUNISIE TELECOM. 
SEVERAL INTERLOCUTORS SAID THAT THE NEW MINISTER OF INTERIOR 
ROSE RAPIDLY THROUGH THE SERVICE BECAUSE OF TIME SPENT IN BEN 
ALI\'S HOME TOWN OF HAMMAM SOUSSE, ON THE CENTRAL COAST, 
DURING WHICH HE WAS REPORTEDLY ATTENTIVE TO BEN ALI\'S MOTHER. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C) APART FROM THE SPECULATION ABOUT PERSONAL TIES AND 
RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH WE CANNOT VERIFY, MUCH OF THE ANALYSIS 
MAKES SENSE.  THERE IS A POSITIVE SIDE TO THE INCREASINGLY 
TECHNOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION--TUNISIA HAS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK 
TO DO IF IT IS TO MODERNIZE ITS GOVERNMENT, ECONOMY, AND 
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  ON THE 
POLITICAL SIDE, IT IS CLEAR THAT SOME OF BEN ALI\'S CLOSEST 
ADVISORS DO NOT HAVE CABINET POSITIONS.  SPOKESMAN ABDULLAH 
IS WIDELY SEEN AS THE HARD-LINER ON FREEDOM OF PRESS ISSUES; 
FORMER PRIME MINISTER KAROUI, WHO CURRENTLY HOLDS NO 
GOVERNMENT POSITION, HAS FREQUENTLY REPRESENTED BEN ALI AT 
INTERNATIONAL FUNCTIONS; PRESIDENTIAL COUNSELOR BEN DHIA, WHO 
RAN BEN ALI\'S 1999 CAMPAIGN, AND WAS SEEN AS FADING, IS STILL 
ACTIVE IN THE POLITICAL DOMAIN.  WE BELIEVE IT IS TOO EARLY 
TO PREDICT WHAT BEN ALI WILL DO IN 2004, BUT HE IS FIRMLY IN 
CONTROL OF HIS GOVERNMENT AND HIS POLITICAL PARTY, AND THERE 
IS NO SIGN THAT HE IS EITHER GROOMING A SUCCESSOR OR 
PREPARING THE PUBLIC FOR HIS DEPARTURE IN 2004.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S FAREWELL CALL ON PRIME MINISTER 
GHANNOUCHI 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Rust M. Deming, Embassy Tunis 
Reason:  1.5 (B) and (C) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, paid a 
farewell call July 22 on Tunisian Prime Minister Mohamed 
Ghannouchi.  In a wide-ranging review of US-Tunisian 
bilateral relations, the Ambassador encouraged the GOT to 
build on its impressive record of economic and social 
development and to continue efforts to integrate Tunisia and 
its regional partners into the global economic and political 
system.  PM Ghannouchi noted the historic ties between the 
two countries, and expressed appreciation for US economic and 
development assistance dating from the earliest days of 
Tunisian independence.  The PM said that Tunisia continued to 
place great value on its relationship with the United States, 
even if it disagreed at times with US policies in the region. 
 He agreed that a consensus existed in Tunisia on the need to 
build a more democratic society, but argued that this must be 
undertaken at a measured pace to avoid \"mistakes.\"  The GOT 
looked forward to the first Trade and Investment Framework 
Agreement (TIFA) roundtable in Washington in the fall, and 
said the Minister of Development and International 
Cooperation would likely lead the Tunisian delegation to the 
talks.  On regional issues, the PM underlined the need for 
continued US engagement in efforts to resolve the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and urged the US to put Q place 
an interim Iraqi government and proceed quickly with the 
reconstruction of the country and the reintegration of Iraq 
into the global economy.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador paid a farewell call on Tunisian Prime 
Minister Ghannouchi on July 22.  During his tenure as Prime 
Minister, Ghannouchi has served as the coordinator of GOT 
economic policy and the conversation focused on economic 
issues.  The Ambassador expressed optimism about the state of 
US-Tunisian relations, and noted that even during periods of 
disagreement on regional issues, Tunisians kept their longer 
term interests in mind and maintained an open channel of 
communication with US officials.  The PM replied that 
US-Tunisian ties were longstanding, and he expressed deep 
appreciation for the historic role of the United States in 
assisting Tunisian development from the earliest days of the 
country\'s independence.  Noting the role of USAID and other 
USG agencies in Tunisia, the PM said these infrastructure and 
development projects had made the Tunisian economy \"better 
armed\" to face the increasing demands of globalization.  The 
PM added that the GOT remained concerned about the future, 
particularly in view of the world economic downturn, but his 
government was committed to staying the course on support for 
education, infrastructure development and private sector 
reform. 
 
3. (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s comment that there 
appeared to be a large consensus within the Tunisian 
political class on the need to build a more open political 
and economic system and a more democratic society, the PM 
said the only point of contention was on the speed of reform. 
 Agreeing that there was \"no debate\" in Tunisia on the need 
to safeguard the country\'s achievements in the social and 
economic sectors (particularly with regard to the rights of 
women), the PM stated that the GOT did \"not have the freedom 
to make mistakes,\" and \"must remain vigilant\" to the threat 
from the secular extremists on the left and the religious 
extremists on the right.  PM Ghannouchi added that the GOT 
was committed to maintaining the \"tolerant, moderate and 
progressive\" character of the Tunisian state, but that this 
required a gradual approach.  Appealing for understanding 
from the west about the measured pace of political opening in 
Tunisia, the PM joked that \"even in the US you have speed 
limits on your highways!\" 
 
4. (C) On the economic front, the Ambassador said that he 
hoped to see increased US investment in Tunisia, and that in 
this regard, it would be important to resolve 
Algerian-Moroccan bilateral differences over the Western 
Sahara in order to reinvigorate the moribund Arab Maghreb 
Union (UMA, in French).  The PM agreed that the slow pace of 
regional economic integration placed Tunisia and its partners 
at a disadvantage, but he expressed the hope that UMA could 
be revived and that Tunisia would attract increased foreign 
direct investment, particularly from US companies.  Reviewing 
Tunisia\'s efforts to build a \"larger economic space,\" 
Ghannouchi reitrated the GOT commitment to the Barcelona 
Process, the 5 plus 5 dialogue, and the expansion of free 
trade agreements between Europe and North Africa. 
 
5. (C) Turning to other bilateral and regional issues, the PM 
said that Tunisia looked forward to the first TIFA roundtable 
in Washington in the fall, and confirmed that the Minister of 
Development and International Cooperation would likely lead 
the GOT delegation.  On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
Ghannouchi said the success of the process hinged on 
continued US engagement.  On Iraq, the PM underlined the 
importance for Tunisia and the rest of the Arab world of the 
establishment of an interim government headed by Iraqis, 
adding that the reconstruction of Iraq and the reintegration 
of the country into the world economy were equally critical. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  There are rumors rampant of a significant 
government reshuffle following the ruling RCD party congress 
next week, so the Prime Minister may be replaced, along with 
many members of his government.  Despite this, we expect the 
broad lines of Tunisian domestic and foreign policy to remain 
constant.  Tunisia places a high value on its bilateral 
relationship with the United States, and before the conflict 
in Iraq, senior GOT interlocutors assured us that the 
relationship would weather the storm.  This has proven to be 
the case, and Ghannouchi\'s comments reflect the broad view 
within the GOT that it is important to move quickly to resume 
business as usual.  The Tunisians see the upcoming TIFA 
discussions as part of this, and the GOT looks forward to an 
enriched bilateral dialogue on a range of issues.
