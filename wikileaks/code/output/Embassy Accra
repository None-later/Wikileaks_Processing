INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, NOR WERE THERE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM. 
 
B)  ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT (JANUARY 1988) OFFICIAL 
GOG DIP LIST, WHICH REPLACED ONE ISSUED IN 1984, THE PLO 
IS NOW OFFICIALLY LISTED AS AN EMBASSY.  ITS CHIEF OF 
MISSION, IBRAHIM KHALIL OMAR, IS LISTED AS AEP IN THE 
ORDER OF PRECEDENCE, WHICH STATES HE PRESENTED CREDENTIALS 
ON JULY 17, 1986. 
 
C)  GHANA HAS MADE NO OFFICIAL PUBLIC STATEMENT IN 1988 
IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A 
TERRORISM ISSUE.

1.  MOST OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT TERRORISM ARE NOT 
PERTINENT TO THE GHANAIAN SITUATION.  HOWEVER, GHANA 
HAS HAD CLOSE RELATIONS WITH LIBYA; GOOD RELATIONS 
WITH IRAN, CUBA, AND NORTH KOREA; AND RECOGNIZES THE 
\"GOVERNMENT OF PALESTINE.\"  GHANA IS NOT KNOWN TO 
HAVE BEEN A SPRINGBOARD FOR AN ATTACK BY A TERRORIST 
GROUP, AND THE GOG IS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE ALLOWED 
TERRORISTS TO OPERATE WITHIN THE COUNTRY. 
 
--  LIBYA:  THE DIPLOMTIC LIST SHOWS EIGHT PEOPLE 
ACCREDITED TO THE PEOPLES\' BUREAU IN ACCRA; THE TOTAL 
NUMBER OF LIBYANS IN-COUNTRY IS ESTIMATED AT 50. 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS 
WITH LIBYAN REPRESENTATIVES SUCH AS THE GHANA LIBYAN 
ARAB HOLDING COMPANY, GHANA LIBYAN ARAB MINING 
COMPANY, LIBYA ARAB AGRICULTURAL HOLDING COMPANY, 
VARIOUS GREEN BOOK STUDY CLUBS, AND THE 
LIBYAN-SPONSORED ISLAMIC CALL SOCIETY WHLCH IS ACTIVE 
ON THE RELIGIOUS FRONT.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT GHANA IS 
ALSO A TRANSIT POINT FOR PEOPLE FROM OTHER PARTS OF 
WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA TRAVELLING TO LIBYA. 
 
--  PLO:  GHANA HOSTS A TWO-PERSON EMBASSY OF THE 
\"STATE OF PALESTINE\" IN ACCRA.  PLO RECEIVES 
FAVORABLE AND SYMPATHETIC PRESS COVERAGE (E.G., 
ANNIVERSARY OF ESTABLISHMENT OF THE \"STATE OF 
PALESTINE\" AND ARAFAT COMMENTS ON RECENT ISRAELI 
SHOOTINGS IN JERUSALEM); PLO ENVOYS ARE RECEIVED BY 
CHAIRMAN RAWLINGS; AND THE PLO CONDUCTS AN ANNUAL 
COMPUTER CAMP (\"COMPUCAMP\") ATTENDED BY YOUNG PEOPLE 
FROM SEVERAL WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES.  GHANA GENERALLY 
SUPPORTS PLO POSITIONS ON THE MIDDLE EAST SITUATION 
IN INTERNATIONAL FORA (BUT ABSTAINS ON THE \"ISRAELI 
CREDENTIALS\" ISSUE). 
 
-- IRAN HAS A SMALL BUT ACTIVE EMBASSY IN GHANA.  A 
RECENT DELEGATION INITIATED AN IRAN-GHANA JOINT 
COMMISSION.  IRAN PROVIDES MODEST ASSISTANCE TO THE 
AGRICULTURAL AND HEALTH SECTORS, AND SPONSORS 
SEMINARS FOR ISLAMIC GROUPS. 
 
-- GHANA-CUBA RELATIONS ARE GOOD.  SEVERAL HUNDRED 
GHANAIAN YOUTHS ARE STUDYING IN CUBA; GHANA HAS 
ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE THE CUBAN COMMITTEES FOR 
DEFENCE OF THE REVOLUTION; AND GHANAIAN LEADERS 
RESPECT CASTRO\'S REVOLUTIONARY STANCE.  THE CUBANS 
HAVE PROVIDED SEVERAL TECHNICAL TEAMS--TEACHERS, 
DOCTORS, AGRICULTURALISTS, ETC.--TO WORK IN RURAL 
GHANA. 
 
-- NORTH KOREA HAS A SMALL EMBASSY IN ACCRA.  THERE 
IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF NORTH KOREAN ASSISTANCE TO GHANA 
AND DELEGATIONS HAVE EXCHANGED VISITS DURING THIS 
PAST YEAR (ONE GHANAIAN DELEGATION WAS LED BY PNDC 
MEMBER JUSTICE DANIEL K. ANNAN).  GHANA AND THE DPRK 
HAVE A JOINT COMMISSION WHICH MEETS INFREQUENTLY. 
OCCASIONALLY, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT-OWNED PRESS 
CARRIES FEATURE STORIES COMMENTING FAVORABLY ON 
ASPECTS OF THE NORTH KOREAN POLITICAL-ECONOMIC 
SYSTEM. 
 
-- IRAQ - GHANA HAS NO SUBSTANTIVE RELATIONS WITH 
IRAQ AND CONDEMNED THE IRAQ INVASION OF KUWAIT.

1.  THE GOVERNMENT OF GHANA HAS ALWAYS TAKEN A STRONG 
STANCE AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE GOG HAS BEEN COOPERATIVE 
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN SHARING INFORMATION AND IN OTHER 
EFFORTS TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  HOWEVER, 
GHANA\'S PRIENDSHIP WITH IRAN AND LIBYA HAS SOMETIMES LED 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO URGE MODERATION AND COMPROMISE 
IN INTERNATIONAL REACTIONS TO ALLEGED INSTANCES OF 
TBRRORISM SPONSORED BY THOSE STATES. 
 
2.  THE RESPONSES BELOW ARE KEYED TO POINTS IN PARA 4 OF 
REFTEL: 
 
A.  THE GOG HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN THE PROSECUTION OF 
AMY INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS, 
HOWEVER, PROSECUTED FOUR PEOPLE FOR BOMBINGS THAT 
OCCURRED IN GHANA AFTER THE 1992 ELECTIONS. 
 
B.  GHANA NEITHER EXTRADITED NOR REQUESTED THE 
EXTRADITION OF ANY INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS IN 1993.  IT 
DID, HOWEVER, EXPRESS WILLINGNESS TO EXTRADITE A 
DETAINED INTERNATIONAL HIJACKER IF SO REQUESTED BY THE 
COUNTRY OF THE AFFECTED AIRLINE.  THE SITUATION WAS 
RESOLVED IN A MANNER WHICH LED TO THE HIJACKER\'S CURRENT 
PRO&ECUTION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
 
C.  THE GOVERNMENT OF GHANA WILL, IN GENERAL, ONLY 
EXTRADITE INDIVIDUALS TO COUNTRIES WITH WHICH IT HAS AN 
EXTRADITION TREATY. 
 
D.  THE GOG HAS BEEN VERY WILLING TO ASSIST IN 
INVESTIGATION OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST INCIDENTS. 
 
E.  THE GOG HAS COOPERATED IN THE INVESTIGATION AND 
RESOLUTION OF SEVERAL INCIDENTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM OF DIRECT INTEREST TO THE UNITED STATES. 
 
F.  THE GOG HAS NOT PROVIDED ANY SUPPORT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS. 
 
G.  THE GOG HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE UN SHOULD ACCEPT 
LIBYA\'S OFFER TO HAVE ITS TWO CITIZENS ACCUSED OF THE 
PAN AM 103 BOMBING TRIED IN A NEUTRAL COUNTRY. 
 
H.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE GHANAIAN 
GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS TERRORISM SINCE 1992.

PARAGRAPH 3 OF REFTEL: 
 
A.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS 
INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN 1996. 
 
B.  THE HOST GOVERNMENT DID NOT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE 
EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN 1996. 
 
C.  THE US AND GHANA DO NOT HAVE AN EXTRADITION TREATY. 
HOWEVER, EXTRADITION IS POSSIBLE UNDER GHANAIAN LAW. 
 
D.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC STATEMENTS  OR 
INVESTIGATIONS IN 1996. 
 
E.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS 
UNDERTAKEN. 
 
F.  THE GOVERNMENT OF GHANA HAS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
WITH LIBYA, IRAN AND CUBA.  WITHIN THE PAST YEAR THE 
GOVERNMENT OF IRAN HAS ESTABLISHED ABOUT A DOZEN ISLAMIC 
HEALTH CLINICS.IN GMANA.  THERE HAS BEEN A WIDESPREAD 
PERCEPTION OF ARAB AMBASSADORS ASSIGNED TO GHANA THAT 
THESE CLINICS ARE ACTUALLY TRAINING FACILITIES FOR 
TERRORISM OR THE EXPORT OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM. 
THESE PERCEPTIONS HAVE BEEN VOICED DIRECTLY TO 
AMBASSADOR BRYNN.  TO DATE WE HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE TO 
CONFIRM THESE OPINIONS.  HOWEVER, THESE SUSPICIONS MERIT 
FURTHER INVESTIGATION. 
 
G.  IN SEPTEMBER 1996, DURING THE RECENT CRISIS IN IRAQ, 
PRESIDENT  RAWLINGS MADE A VERY PUBLIC TRIP TO LIBYA AND 
MET WITH COL. AL-QADHDHAFI.  ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT MADE 
NO SPECIFIC STATEMENTS ON IRAQ OR TERRORISM, HIS TIMING 
WAS SEEN AS INAPPROPRIATE. 
 
H.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1995 IN 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM. 
 
I.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS OR 
INITIATIVES WITH RESPECT TO GHANA. 
 
J.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS NOT SOUGHT COOPERATION FROM 
GHANA DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OR 
PROSECUTION OF ANY ACT OF TERRORISM.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/07 
TAGS: PREL, PINR, PGOV, GH 
SUBJECT: A CLOSE LOOK AT GHANA\'S PRESIDENT RAWLINGS 
 
REF: ACCRA 01142 
 
CLASSIFIED BY EDWARD BRYNN, COM, REASON 1.5(B) AND (D) 
 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE NETHERLANDS\' DEPARTING AMBASSADOR 
TO GHANA, HEIN PRINCEN, SPENT A FULL WEEK-END IN CLOSE 
QUARTERS WITH J. J. RAWLINGS, AND CAME AWAY BOTH 
FASCINATED AND A BIT UNNERVED.  PRINCEN\'S SPOUSE, A 
TRAINED SOCIAL WORKER, SAW INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE OF 
DRUG USE BY THE PRESIDENT.  RAWLINGS COMPLAINED THAT HIS 
ADVISORS KEEP HIM IN THE DARK.  HIS WIFE WAS PRESENT, 
AND RAWLINGS WAS DEFERENTIAL TOWARDS HER, BUT IT WAS 
CLEAR THAT THEY ARE SEEN TOGETHER ONLY FOR FAMILY 
REASONS OR REASONS OF STATE.  PRINCEN FOUND RAWLINGS 
TIRED OF HIS PUBLIC PERSONA AND EASILY PERSUADED THAT 
PEOPLE WERE WORKING BEHIND HIS BACK.  RAWLINGS SEEMS 
CAUGHT BETWEEN A DESIRE TO BRING HIS CHIEF OF STATE 
TENURE TO A CLOSE ON ONE HAND, AND A LIVELY FEAR OF THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF SO DOING ON THE OTHER.  PRINCEN SAW 
RAWLINGS\' NEWEST EMINENCE GRISE UP CLOSE, AND DID NOT 
LIKE HIS BALEFUL INFLUENCE IN THE AREA OF GHANAIAN 
ECONOMIC POLICY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) THE SETTING:  VERY OCCASIONALLY RAWLINGS INVITES 
AN ACCREDITED DIPLOMAT TO JOIN HIS FAMILY FOR WEEK-END 
RELAXATION AND CONVERSATION ON THE MODEST BUT 
COMFORTABLE PRESIDENTIAL YACHT ANCHORED IN VOLTA LAKE 
ONE HUNDRED MILES NORTHEAST OF ACCRA.  (THE LAST HONOREE 
WAS AMERICAN AMBASSADOR KENNETH BROWN ON THE EVE OF HIS 
DEPARTURE IN MID-1995.)  ALSO PRESENT WERE RAWLINGS\' SIX 
CHILDREN, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR ANTHONY AIDOO (MORE 
LATER), AN UNNAMED GERMAN ENGINEER/BOAT CAPTAIN, AND A 
COUPLE OF MILITARY STAFFERS.  GUESTS SO HONORED ARE 
ENJOINED NOT TO DISCUSS THE ADVENTURE INSIDE GHANA, AND 
PRINCEN  ASSURED ME THAT I ALONE (IN GHANA) WAS PRIVY TO 
WHAT FOLLOWS. 
 
3.  (C) THE PRIVATE PERSONA:  AMBASSADOR PRINCEN\'S WIFE 
CONCLUDED EMPHATICALLY THAT RAWLINGS IS A DRUG-USER. 
PERIODS OF HIGH-LEVEL ENERGIZING WERE FOLLOWED BY 
RAWLINGS\' DISAPPEARANCE FOR THIRTY MINUTES, AND UPON HIS 
RETURN HE WAS SUBDUED AND EVEN MELLOW.  HE PERSPIRED 
PROFUSELY AT SHORT NOTICE, AND CONSUMED LARGE QUANTITIES 
OF NON-ALCOHOLIC DRINKS.  PRINCEN REINFORCED MY OWN 
IMPRESSION THAT RAWLINGS\' ATTENTION SPAN HAS SHORTENED 
OF LATE.  BUT THE PRINCENS FOUND THE PRESIDENT OPEN, 
INDULGENT TOWARDS HIS CHILDREN, AND EXTREMELY 
DEFERENTIAL - EVEN OBSEQUIOUS - TOWARDS HIS SPOUSE.  THE 
TENOR OF THEIR CONVERSATION REINFORCED THE WIDESPREAD 
IMPRESSION THAT THEY SEE EACH OTHER ONLY IN PUBLIC OR IN 
THE CONTEXT OF THIS RETREAT TO LAKE VOLTA.  (RAWLINGS 
SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST FAMILY GATHERING THIS YEAR.) 
RAWLINGS WATCHED VIDEOS, LISTENED TO MUSIC, AND CHATTED 
UP HIS GUESTS SIMULTAMEOUSLY.  PRINCEN NOTICED WHAT ALL 
OF US OBSERVE AS INTERLOCUTORS:  RAWLINGS\' INCREDIBLE 
INABILITY TO RECALL NAMES, EVEN THOSE OF ADVISERS 
CONSTANTLY AT HIS ELBOW. 
 
4.  (C) RAWLINGS\' CIRCLE OF ADVISORS:  SINCE 
PRESIDENTIAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS LAST DECEMBER 
WE HAVE PUSHED THE THEME THAT PRESIDENT RAWLINGS SEEMS 
TO HAVE BEEN STRIPPED OF A CIRCLE OF CONFIDANTS WHOSE 
COLLECTIVE WEIGHT, WHILE FAR FROM BRILLIANT, APPEARED TO 
MODERATE RAWLINGS\' TENDENCY TO OVERACT AT FIRST EVIDENCE 
OF SOME UNPALATABLE DEVELOPMENT.  WE ARE NOW WELL INTO A 
NEW PHASE, WHERE IT APPEARS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS FAR 
FROM WELL INFORMED AS TO WHAT TRANSPIRES IN HIS NAME. 
HE WAS MANIFESTLY OUT TO LUNCH ON THE PNG OF OUR PUBLIC 
AFFAIRS OFFICER IN MAY.  WORLD BANK AND IMF VISITORS 
COMPLAIN THAT HE SEEMS PROFOUNDLY UNINFORMED ON ECONOMIC 
MATTERS, EVEN AS HIS MINISTER OF FINANCE IS SEEN BY 
FINANCIAL EXPERTS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GHANA AS ALARMINGLY 
INCOMPETENT.  INTO THE VACUUM HAS MOVED ANTHONY AIDOO, 
WHOSE CONSPIRATORIAL DEMEANOR ENCOURAGES DARK 
SPECULATION ABOUT HIS MALIGN INFLUENCE ON RAWLINGS. 
AIDOO IS KNOWN TO US PRINCIPALLY FOR HIS ENTRENCHED 
LEFTIST LEANINGS, HIS ANTI-IMPERIALIST RHETORIC WHILE A 
PROFESSOR AT CAPE COAST UNIVERSITY, AND HIS AFFECTION 
FOR THE LIKES OF QADAFI AND CASTRO.  AMBASSADOR 
PRINCEN\'S OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH AIDOO AT CLOSE QUARTERS 
WAS FAR FROM REASSURING.  AIDOO SEEMED TO REINFORCE 
RAWLINGS\' FEARS THAT SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE 
CONSPIRING TO HIDE THINGS FROM THE PRESIDENT.  AIDOO\'S 
OBSEQUIOUS BEHAVIOR TOWARDS MRS. RAWLINGS ALSO 
REINFORCED THE IMPRESSION HERE IN ACCRA THAT SHE IS IN 
SOME DEGREE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ALIENATION OF THE 
PRESIDENT\'S TRADITIONAL FRIENDS, WITH AIDOO NOW FILLING 
THE VOID. 
 
5.  (C) IMPACT ON ECONOMIC POLICY:  ACCORDING TO PRINCEN 
THE ONLY SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON 
GHANA\'S CURRENT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  PRINCEN WAS 
INTRIGUED TO SEE RAWLINGS NODDING IN ASSENT AT AIDOO\'S 
PRONOUNCEMENT THAT HIGH INFLATION WAS CAUSED BY 
IRRESPONSIBLE ELEMENTS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND THAT 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR SHOULD FIND A SOLUTION.  AIDOO ALSO 
FED RAWLINGS THE NOTION THAT THE NORTH CAROLINA SUMMIT 
ON GHANA\'S COMPETITIVENESS IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE WAS 
A CAMOUFLAGED ATTACK ON RAWLINGS\' NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC 
CONGRESS.  PRINCEN REMONSTRATED, BUT HE THOUGHT WITH 
LIMITED EFFECT. PRINCEN DID GAIN RAWLINGS\' ATTENTION BY 
REGISTERING IMPRESSIONS CIRCULATING IN ACCRA THAT THE 
WORLD BANK AND IMF ARE INCREASINGLY DISSATISFIED WITH 
THE PERFORMANCE OF BOTH THE INCUMBENT MINISTER OF 
FINANCE PEPPRAH AND THE LARGER ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE 
POST-DECEMBER GOVERNMENT.  RAWLINGS RESPONDED BY LASHING 
OUT AT MEMBERS OF HIS OWN GOVERNMENT - SOME WERE CITED 
BY NAME - WHO DELIBERATELY CONCEAL PROBLEMS FROM HIS 
ATTENTION.  RAWLINGS BUILT UP A HEAD OF STEAM ON THE 
GHANA ELECTRICAL COMMISSION\'S ANNOUNCEMENT TWO WEEKS AGO 
THAT RATES WOULD RISE UP TO 300, RETROACTIVE TO MAY 1; 
THIS WAS DESIGNED TO DESTABILIZE HIS GOVERNMENT, HE 
THOUGHT.  THE LARGER IMPRESSION, HOWEVER, WAS THAT 
PRESIDENT RAWLINGS WAS NOT WELL INFORMED OF RECENT 
UNSETTLING ECONOMIC TRENDS. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  THE IMPRESSIONS REGISTERED ABOVE ARE 
THOSE OF A VETERAN CAREER DIPLOMAT (PREVIOUSLY 
AMBASSADOR IN PERU AND NOW OFF TO SRI LAMKA) WHOSE 
CONFIDENTIAL OBSERVATIONS ON OTHER OCCASIONS HAVE HELD 
UP WELL.  PRINCEN\'S OBSERVATIONS ECHO IMPRESSIONS I 
RECORDED EARLIER THIS YEAR (REFTEL).  IF THEY HOLD 
WATER, WE MUST SEE IN THEM A GIANT STEP BACKWARDS IF 
CLOSE CONFIDANTS LIKE ANTHONY AIDOO ARE PREJUDICING THE 
PRESIDENT AGAINST THE TRADE AND INVESTMENT INITIATIVE 
LAUNCHED AT CHAPEL HILL IN EARLY JUNE.  AND, IN A LARGER 
ARENA, IF AS A RESULT OF FATIGUE OR ISOLATION OR 
UNHEALTHY PERSONAL PRACTICES PRESIDENT RAWLINGS FAILS TO 
EXERCISE LEADERSHIP SKILLS DURING HIS SECOND 
CONSTITUTIONAL TERM, THERE MIGHT BE DELETERIOUS 
REPERCUSSIONS FOR ALL THAT TOUCHES ON THE ECONOMY:  THE 
GROWTH OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS;  THE CONTINUATION OF 
AN ERA OF DOMESTIC PEACE;  THE EMERGENCE OF A PRIVATE 
SECTOR ABLE TO INVITE SIGNIFICANT OUTSIDE INVESTMENT AND 
PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  AMBASSADOR 
PRINCEN NOTED THAT RAWLINGS PLANS TO MARK MY OWN 
DEPARTURE WITH A SIMILAR WEEK-END ADVENTURE.  BUT AS IT 
NOW STANDS THAT MAY NOT COME SOON, LEAVING MUCH TIME FOR 
ANTHONY AIDOO TO BREW A POISONOUS POTION IN THE CASTLE.

THE GOG CONDEMNED, PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY, THE SEPTEMBER 
11 ATTACKS AGAINST THE U.S, AND EXPRESSED ITS SYMPATHY, 
AGAIN PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY, FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE 
ATTACKS.  GOG SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE, 
FROM INCREASED SECURITY AT MISSION FACILITIES, TO 
ENHANCED SHARING OF INFORMATION FROM POLICE, 
IMMIGRATION, MILITARY AND OTHER CONTACTS.  THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT TO ASSIST IN THE SUPPRESSION OF 
TERRORIST FINANCING BOTH BY SIGNING THE CONVENTION TO 
SUPPRESS TERRORIST FINANCING THIS MONTH, AND BY ITS 
WILLINGNESS TO SHARE INFORMATION ON, AND REQUEST 
ASSISTANCE WITH, ITS CAPACITY TO MONITOR SUSPICIOUS 
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ARRESTED 
SEVERAL SUSPICIOUS THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS TRANSITTING 
THE COUNTRY, AND SHARED INFORMATION FROM THOSE ARRESTS 
WITH US.  IT HAS AGREED UPON THE IMPORTANCE OF ADOPTING 
THE FIVE REMAINING ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS (INCLUDING 
THE CONVENTION TO SUPPRESS TERRORIST FINANCING, WHICH 
MUST NOW BE RATIFIED BY PARLIAMENT), AND HAS SET UP AN

B.  CASE STUDIES OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS:

C.  RESPONSE OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO 2001 ACTS OF 
INTERNATIONAL/DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
 
THE GHANAIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM DID NOT HAVE OCCASION TO

TERRORISM IN 2001. 
 
D. EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:

THE GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM HAS BECOME 
MORE FOCUSED AND RESULTS-ORIENTED, WITH CLOSE 
COOPERATION WITH THE MISSION ON LOCAL SECURITY AND 
TRANSIT OF SUSPICIOUS THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS. 
 
K.  U.S. COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS WITH THE HOST 
GOVERNMENT: 
 
THE U.S. HAS ASKED FOR, AND RECEIVED, VERY CLOSE 
COOPERATION FROM GHANAIAN SECURITY FORCES IN THE 
AFTERMATH OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS.  TO THE EXTENT 
POSSIBLE UNDER EXISTING LAWS, GHANA HAS AGREED TO 
TIGHTEN ITS OVERSIGHT OF SUSPICIOUS FINANCIAL 
TRANSACTIONS.  IT HAS ALSO AGREED THAT SUBSTANTIAL 
REVISION OF ITS LAWS REGARDING MONEY-LAUNDERING AND 
SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS IS NECESSARY AND SHOULD BE 
PURSUED, AND HAS ASKED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN DOING 
SO.  THE MISSION HAS LOBBIED THE GOG EXTENSIVELY ON THE 
NECESSITY OF ADOPTING THE FIVE REMAINING INTERNATIONAL 
ANTI-TERRORIST CONVENTIONS, AND THE GOG HAS BEGUN THE 
PROCESS OF ADOPTION. 
 
L.  COOPERATION DURING PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN 
INVESTIGATION/PROSECUTION OF TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST 
AMERICAN CITIZENS/INTERESTS: 
 
ASIDE FROM THE COOPERATION DETAILED ABOVE REGARDING THE 
EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, THE GOG MADE STRONG COOPERATIVE 
STATEMENTS FOLLOWING THE EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN EAST 
AFRICAN IN 1998, AND ASSISTED WITH ENHANCED SECURITY FOR 
MISSION FACILITIES. 
 
M.  COOPERATION DURING PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN PREVENTION 
OF TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS/INTERESTS: 
 
SAME AS PREVIOUS ANSWER.

2001 ATTACKS AGAINST THE U.S., AND EXPRESSED ITS SYMPATHY, 
AGAIN PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY, FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE ATTACKS. 
IN THE YEAR SINCE THE ATTACKS THE GOG HAS ON SEVERAL 
OCCASIONS RENEWED ITS CONDEMNATIONS AND EXPRESSIONS OF 
SYMPATHY.  FOR EXAMPLE, HIGH LEVEL DELEGATIONS, LED BY MUSLIM 
VICE PRESIDENT ALIU MOHAMMED, ATTENDED THE MISSION\'S 
THREE-MONTH AND ONE-YEAR COMMEMORATIVE CEREMONIES, AND MADE 
VERY SUPPORTIVE REMARKS.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO BEEN VERY 
SUPPORTIVE IN CONCRETE TERMS AS WELL, FROM INCREASED SECURITY 
AT MISSION COMPOUNDS, TO HEIGHTENED SHARING OF INFORMATION 
FROM POLICE, IMMIGRATION, MILITARY AND OTHER CONTACTS.  THE 
GOVERNMENT WELCOMED ASSISTANCE IN THE SUPPRESSION OF 
TERRORIST FINANCING, AND HELD USEFUL MEETINGS WITH US 
TREASURY OFFICIALS ON MONITORING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.  THE 
GOG ADOPTED FIVE ANTI-TERRORIST CONVENTIONS TO WHICH IT WAS 
NOT YET A MEMBER IN JULY, INCLUDING THE CONVENTION TO 
SUPPRESS TERRORIST FINANCING, AND NOW SUBSCRIBES TO ALL 12 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS ON TERRORISM.  AT THE SAME TIME, IT 
ALSO ADOPTED THE OAU CONVENTION AGAINST TERRORISM.  IT IS IN 
THE PROCESS OF DRAFTING LOCAL LEGISLATION TO PUT ITS CRIMINAL 
CODE AND FINANCIAL MONITORING REGIMES IN HARMONY WITH THESE 
VARIOUS CONVENTIONS.  KEY SECURITY OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO 
INDICATE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW U.S. AIR AND NAVAL ASSETS 
TO TRANSIT GHANA, OR MAKE USE OF LOCAL FACILITIES, IF NEEDED 
(AS DEMONSTRATED BY THEIR GREAT COOPERATION IN THE USE OF 
KOTOKA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN ACCRA FOR THE RECENT 
EVACUATION OF U.S. CITIZENS FROM COTE D\'IVOIRE). 
 
B.  RESPONSE OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO ACTS OF 
INTERNATIONAL/DOMESTIC TERROR: 
 
THE GHANAIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM DID NOT HAVE OCCASION TO RESPOND 
TO ANY ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERROR IN 2002. 
 
C.  EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: 
 
THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT RECEIVE ANY REQUESTS TO EXTRADITE, NOR

D.  SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO EXTRADITION:

SUBJECT: TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT - GHANA 
 
REF: STATE 22225 
 
 1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The following is AmEmb Accra\'s response to 
the tasker requesting information for the second annual 
Trafficking in Persons Report. In summary, Ghana has problems 
with both domestic and international human trafficking.  The 
GOG and local NGOs have so far combined efforts to focus on 
combating domestic trafficking in children and the cultural 
complacency that allows such trafficking and the resulting 
child labor to occur.  Efforts to combat international 
trafficking have been hampered by a number of factors: slow 
action on enacting appropriate legislation criminalizing 
trafficking, changes in the directorship of the agencies that 
lead GOG efforts on the issue, and the simple lack of 
resources common to most developing nations. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (SBU) The following responses are keyed to Ref A. 
 
----------------- 
Para 16: Overview 
----------------- 
 
A. (U) Ghana is both a country of origin and a destination 
for internationally trafficked persons.  However, internal 
trafficking is more common than cross-border trafficking. 
The Government does not have official figures on the number 
of trafficked persons, either domestic or cross-border, and 
estimates are difficult to come by and of limited 
reliability. 
 
B. (U) Domestically, most trafficking is in children, with 
northerners more likely to be trafficked than southerners. 
Boys are sent from the Northern Region to work in the fishing 
communities in the Volta Region, and girls from the Northern 
and Eastern Regions to the cities of Accra and Kumasi to work 
as domestic helpers, porters, and assistants to local 
traders. 
 
Internationally, the majority of trafficking involves 
children between the ages of seven and seventeen being 
shipped to and from the neighboring countries of Cote 
d\'Ivoire, Togo, and Nigeria to work as laborers or household 
help, or young women who are shipped to Western Europe, 
mostly to work as prostitutes.  Ghana is also a transit 
country.  There is a growing trade in Nigerian women 
transiting Ghana on their way to Western Europe to work in 
the sex industry, and there is reportedly some trafficking in 
persons from Burkina Faso, going through Ghana on their way 
to Cote d\'Ivoire. 
 
C. (U) Due to a lack of current reliable data, we have not 
been able to detect any appreciable changes in the direction 
or extent of trafficking over the past year. 
 
D. (U) The most detailed studies on child trafficking have 
been done by the African Center for Human Development (April 
2000), and the Ministry of Manpower and Employment in 
conjunction with the ILO (February 2001).  Other local and 
international organizations, both governmental and 
non-governmental, have looked at the issue of trafficking in 
persons, but mostly in the broader context of child labor. 
 
E. (U) Ghana is not a major destination for international 
trafficked victims.  Those trafficked domestically are used 
primarily for labor, such as farming, fishing, housekeeping, 
street vending, and other menial work.  They are either not 
paid at all, or are given very low wages.  Because trafficked 
children are often sent away by families unable to support 
them, and sometimes in exchange for cash payments, they 
cannot easily return home despite their maltreatment. 
 
F. (U) Children from impoverished rural backgrounds are the 
primary victims of trafficking from Ghana to other countries. 
 Much of the recruitment of children between the ages of 
eight and fifteen is done with the consent of the parents, 
who are sometimes given an advance payment or promised 
regular stipends from the recruiter.  The parents are told 
the children will receive food, shelter, and often some sort 
of training or education.  Some children are sent to work for 
extended family members in urban areas, who may treat the 
children relatively well.  Many, however, are given to 
professional recruiters, who, upon reaching the cities, hand 
the children off to those who will be their actual employers. 
 At that point, the children begin their work as housemaids, 
hawkers, shop assistants, etc.  In many cases, the children 
never receive the education or vocational training the 
recruiters promised.  Young Ghanaian women are also 
reportedly targeted by international traffickers promising 
jobs in Western Europe.  They are sent directly from Ghana to 
Europe, mostly Germany, Italy or the Netherlands, or they may 
be transshipped through neighboring countries.  Once at their 
final destination, they are commonly forced into 
prostitution.  Some young women also end up in the Middle 
East, where they work in menial jobs or as domestic help. 
 
G. (U) The Ghanaian Government continues to show an increased 
awareness of the problem of trafficking and the political 
will to address it. The GOG hosted a Meeting of Experts 
Against Trafficking In Persons on October 23-24, 2001, which 
was sponsored by the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations Office for Drug 
Control and Crime Prevention (UNODCCP). GOG attorneys served 
as principal drafters and organizers of the conference. 
 
The resulting \"ECOWAS Initial Plan of Action to Combat 
Trafficking in Persons\" for 2002-2003, called on member 
states to ratify international and regional anti-crime 
conventions, adopt uniform laws against trafficking in 
persons, implement measures to protect and assist the 
trafficking victims, sensitize and educate government and law 
enforcement officials to view trafficking as a crime, and 
discourage the demand for trafficked persons in their 
countries.  The ECOWAS Plan mandated that states establish an 
operational National Task Force on Trafficking by June 2002 
and begin national awareness campaigns. 
 
Since the ECOWAS conference, the largest area of action has 
been in prevention through public outreach campaigns. 
Several high-level GOG officials have responded publicly to 
implement Ghana,s National Plan to Combat Trafficking and 
raise public awareness on the issue.  The Vice President 
formally launched Ghana,s National Task Force on Trafficking 
in Persons three months ahead of the ECOWAS deadline at an 
ILO-sponsored conference on child trafficking in Ghana.  This 
conference was attended by a high-level delegation, including 
five ministers.  The Ministry of Justice leads the Task 
Force, which is made up of representatives from the 
Ministries of Manpower Development and Employment, Ministry 
of Women and Children,s Affairs, the National Police, Ghana 
Immigration, and members of Civil Society. 
 
In other examples of public outreach, the Minister of Women 
and Children\'s Affairs and some Members of Parliament seized 
the opportunity presented by commemorative events such as the 
OAU Day of the African Child (June 16, 2002) and National 
Children,s Day (Aug 21, 2002) to heighten national awareness 
of trafficking in children.  A Supreme Court Justice has been 
quoted in the press warning of the dangers and penalties for 
exploiting children.  The Justice, who chairs a National 
Multi-Sectoral Child Protection Committee, was inaugurating a 
branch of the committee in the Brong-Ahafo Region. 
 
Government and law enforcement officials have participated 
extensively in public awareness outreach campaigns as well as 
training programs sponsored by the USG and 
local/international NGOs.  Last Spring, INS Accra and Post 
RSO recommended a rising Ghana Immigration official to attend 
an International Visitor Program on Human Trafficking. 
Several months after the program, that official rose to the 
top to become the Director of Ghana Immigration.  Impressed 
by the program, she helped organize seminars for immigration 
officers to sensitize them on the issue of trafficking. 
Officials from the Ministry of Manpower Development and 
Employment, Social Welfare Division have been engaged in 
ILO/IPEC training and awareness projects on combating child 
labor - the most common form of human trafficking within 
Ghana. GOG officials have worked side-by-side with NGOs in 
distributing posters and bumper stickers, presenting 
theatrical messages in local communities, and encouraging 
school art and essay competitions.  Officials from the 
Department of Social Welfare attended an ILO/IPEC 
\"train-the-trainers\" workshop on child labor monitoring in 
December 2002. 
 
Second, the GOG has worked closely with NGOs to provide 
protection - focusing on rescue and rehabilitation of 
internally trafficked children.  ILO/IPEC and the Ministry of 
Manpower Development and Employment are currently embarking 
on an initiative to return street children (many of whom are 
runaway trafficking victims) back to their homes in the 
north. This Street Children initiative is part of the 
government,s Poverty Reduction Program funded by a loan from 
the World Bank. Out of the 30 children selected for the 
project, only 18 appeared for the return trip.  Both ILO/IPEC 
and the Ministry are looking for ways to provide more 
counseling and education to the children before attempting to 
repatriate them to their communities.  As the Ministry,s 
Social Welfare Department has limited resources such as 
children,s homes, vehicles, and counselors, the government 
is tapping into the (also limited) resources of local NGOs. 
 
The International Organization for Migration, funded through 
PRM, has begun an initiative to rescue, rehabilitate, and 
return child trafficking victims who are working in fishing 
villages in the Brong-Ahafo Region.  The programs seeks to 
encourage fishermen to release the children in exchange for 
training or equipment that would enable them to fish without 
the use of children.  It is interesting to note that many 
organizations are seeking to address domestic trafficking 
outside the formal legal system.  The problems listed in the 
following paragraph may explain this. 
Prosecution efforts have been the slowest to materialize. 
Many government/law enforcement officials and NGOs complain 
that the lack of specific laws against trafficking impedes 
prosecution of traffickers (who are prosecuted under other 
laws, see para 18, A). Last year,s TIP report noted that 
Ghana,s National Plan involved amending the Ghanaian 
criminal code to define trafficking in persons as a crime. 
The Ministry of Justice has explained that the delay in 
enacting the legislation is due to a decision to draft 
in-depth stand-alone legislation criminalizing trafficking 
rather than amending existing laws. The first draft, which 
among other things would establish specific penalties for 
trafficking is nearly completed.  It is scheduled to soon go 
to stakeholders for comments, and be submitted to Parliament 
for action by Fall 2003.  (COMMENT: Even if Ghana enacts 
anti-trafficking legislation soon, actual prosecution of 
traffickers will likely be slow in coming. The judicial 
system in Ghana is completely under-resourced, (most courts 
lack information technology capability, for example), 
creating an incredible backlog of cases waiting to go to 
trial. END COMMENT) 
 
H. (U) There is no evidence that Government authorities, or 
individual members of government forces, act to facilitate, 
condone, are complicit, take bribes, or assist in trafficking 
operations. 
 
I. (U) The Government is limited in addressing the problem of 
trafficking by both culture and resources.  Child trafficking 
in Ghana is difficult to define.  Children from rural 
communities are commonly sent by their parents to work as 
housemaids for distant relatives in cities.  Given the severe 
poverty that many rural families face, sending a child to 
work for well-off relations in the city, with the hope that 
the child will receive some vocational training or education, 
is regarded as a genuine attempt to improve that child\'s 
opportunities.  The idea that sending children to live with 
extended family under these circumstances is  \"trafficking\" 
would make no sense to many Ghanaians.  Other, more 
exploitative forms of trafficking, such as cross-border 
trafficking or situations where the children are recruited by 
professionals who traffic them for profit, are recognized as 
problems by the Government, but law enforcement authorities 
are not equipped with adequate training or financial 
resources to deal with the problem. 
 
------------------- 
Para 17: Prevention 
------------------- 
 
A. (U) With the adoption of the ECOWAS Plan in October 2001, 
the GOG has openly acknowledged that trafficking is a 
problem, and with the development of its National Plan, has 
begun to address the problem on a coordinated and systematic 
basis (see para 16, G). 
 
B. (U) See para 16, G. 
 
C. (U) A local NGO, The African Center for Human Development 
(AFCHD), has taken several full-page newspaper advertisements 
on their efforts to combat child trafficking within Ghana, 
and on their new rescue and rehabilitation centers for 
rescued children. They have held numerous workshops for local 
leaders, traditional rulers, social workers and law 
enforcement, as well as radio shows in local languages 
discussing the consequences of trafficking and child labor. 
They report an overwhelming response to their efforts. 
Families and trafficked children are seeking out the 
assistance of the ACFHD.  There are even some local fishermen 
who have volunteered to return trafficked children who work 
for them to their families. 
 
The ILO International Program the Elimination of Child Labor 
(ILO/IPEC) has specific programs to combat trafficking.  They 
also use radio and television programs in local languages to 
sensitize communities in what they call \"recruitment areas.\" 
ILO/IPEC is currently working on flyers of information - 
designed to address the cultural underpinnings of child 
trafficking - to pass out to communities, local 
transportation owners and officials, which should be 
completed by Spring 2003. In addition, they are working with 
the Ghana National Drama Company to portray a television 
drama on trafficking using nationally recognized stars.  This 
film will also be used in sensitization and training 
programs. 
 
U.S. Embassy in Accra funds several gender-based NGOs through 
its Democracy and Human Rights Fund.  These organizations run 
empowerment and education workshops on violence against women 
and children.  INL program funds, administered by the local 
UNDP office in coordination with the Embassy, have funded 
several NGOs as well as the Women and Juvenile Police Unit 
(WAJU), focusing on crisis center establishment, counseling, 
police training and community outreach on abuse of women and 
children.  Although these projects are not specifically 
targeted at trafficking in persons, they are crucial to 
tackling the underlying culture that supports crimes against 
vulnerable populations, such as trafficking in women and 
children.  All of the above efforts have been successful in 
the sense that real needs are being addressed, so much so 
that NGOs and local authorities are starting to feel pressure 
on their resources to adequately deal with rescue, 
rehabilitation and reintegration of trafficked children to 
their homes. 
 
D. (U) The Government of Ghana has agreed to pay ten percent 
of the cost of an ILO/IPEC program called \"Combatting 
Trafficking in Children for Labor Exploitation in West and 
Central Africa,\" which includes both training of government 
and NGO officials in the rehabilitation of trafficked 
children and a public relations campaign.  In addition, the 
GOG supports programs designed to empower women and children 
that indirectly help prevent trafficking.  Certain components 
of the Government\'s National Poverty Reduction Program are 
designed to alleviate child poverty and improve children\'s 
access to education, and the Ministry of Women\'s Affairs runs 
programs which serve to educate women on the importance of 
children\'s education. 
 
E. (U)  The Government does support programs (see above), 
though scarcity of resources is always a problem. 
 
F. (U) The Government\'s relationship with NGOs, international 
organizations, and civil society is constructive. 
 
G. (U) The Director of Ghana Immigration is committed to 
combating human trafficking and has begun training officers 
to detect human trafficking.  However, the GOG does not have 
the required resources to adequately monitor and control 
Ghana\'s lengthy land borders.  The lack of sufficient data to 
monitor immigration patterns, for example, stems from the 
lack of communication infrastructure between border posts and 
their regional offices. 
 
H. (U) See para 16, G. 
 
I. (U) See para 16, G.  In addition, the Ministry of Manpower 
Development and Employment has conducted studies on child 
labor with the ILO which touch on the problem of trafficking 
in children. 
 
J. (U) The GOG does have a National Plan to Combat 
Trafficking as well as a National Task Force made up of the 
Ministries of Justice, Manpower Development and Employment, 
and Women and Children,s Affairs, the National Police, Ghana 
Immigration, and members of Civil Society.  The Task Force 
has had a slow start after the initial inauguration, in large 
part because of changes in directorships in important 
Ministries such as Manpower Development and Employment. 
However, most of the same actors are involved in a joint 
GOG-ILO/IPEC Steering Committee to Combat Trafficking at a 
lower, more functional level, which helps coordinate 
trafficking programs nationwide. 
 
K. (U)  The Ministry of Justice has the lead on developing 
the new law against trafficking.  The Ministry of Manpower 
Development and Employment takes the lead on the program 
level to combating child labor as well as child trafficking. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Para 18, Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
A. (U) There is no specific provision in Ghanaian law 
outlawing trafficking in persons.  There are laws against 
slavery, prostitution, rape (or child rape, termed 
\"defilement\"), use of underage labor, manufacture of 
fraudulent documentation, etc.  Traffickers are prosecuted 
under these statutes.  However, the Ministry of Justice is 
currently finalizing a draft law criminalizing human 
trafficking that will soon go out to stakeholders for 
comment.  It is estimated the draft legislation will go to 
Parliament in the Fall 2003. 
B. (U) There are currently no specific penalties for 
trafficking, but penalties for related offenses range from 
six months to 25 years (see above). 
 
C. (U) In June 1998, Parliament passed comprehensive 
legislation to protect women and children\'s rights.  The bill 
doubled the mandatory sentence for rape, making it punishable 
by 5 to 25 years in prison.  It also banned the practice of 
ritual servitude, criminalized indecent assault and forced 
marriage, and raised the punishments for defilement, incest, 
and prostitution involving children.  There is no specific 
penalty for trafficking in persons, although a specific 
penalty is envisioned for the trafficking law being drafted. 
 
D. (U) Traffickers have been prosecuted under statutes listed 
in para 18, A.  Penalties imposed range from several months 
to many years in prison. Sentences for rape or defilement, 
for example, are often 10 to 15 years in length.  Information 
on sentencing of traffickers is not kept separately from 
other data on sentencing for rape, kidnapping, and other 
offenses for which traffickers can be prosecuted. 
 
E. (U) Within Ghana, brokers or recruiters procure children 
from rural areas and move them to the locations where they 
will work (see para 16, F).  These recruiters may move as 
many as ten children at one time.  Internationally, some 
trafficking groups are reportedly taking advantage of Ghana\'s 
growing international air links by moving Nigerian women 
through Ghana to Europe as a way of avoiding stricter airport 
controls in Nigeria. 
 
F. (U) Local law enforcement does not use any special 
techniques in the detection or investigation of trafficking; 
however, there are several current cases involving detection 
of trafficking by police through tip-offs by local residents, 
and arrests have been made (under the related offenses 
mentioned above). 
 
G. (U) The National Plan to Combat Trafficking includes a 
training component for police and immigration officials. 
Presently, Ghana Immigration does attempt to identify 
traffickers and trafficked persons through the detection of 
fraudulent documentation.  In the past year, Ghana 
Immigration Service (GIS) has been successful in stopping 
child traffickers in the north of Ghana.  INS Accra and Post 
RSO recommended three candidates from GIS and the National 
Police to participate in the International Visitors\' Program 
for training in connection with human trafficking.  The 
candidates traveled in the Spring of 2002. This program 
inspired the GIS official, who shortly after the IVP program 
rose to Director, to provide seminars to her officers. INS 
Accra, as well as the immigration services of other Embassies 
in Ghana, have trained GIS officials in the detection of fake 
documents such as passports and visas.  GIS has been 
receptive to such training, and has called on INS and 
Consular officials on many occasions when they have had 
questions about travelers going to the U.S. who they suspect 
may be victims of trafficking.  Many government officials and 
law enforcement agencies have attended training sponsored by 
local and international NGOs in the past year. 
 
H. (U) See para 16, G, for discussion of GOG cooperation with 
its neighbors in the ECOWAS sub-region.  In addition, Ghana 
Immigration has been very receptive to training in the 
detection of fake documents and other techniques to prevent 
trafficking and various forms of illegal immigration (see 
above). 
 
I. (U) We have no examples of the extradition of accused 
traffickers. 
J. (SBU) There is no evidence of government involvement in or 
tolerance of international trafficking.  However, it is more 
difficult to assess the Government\'s position on domestic 
trafficking.  It is commonplace for poor children from rural 
areas to go to cities to work as domestic help for extended 
family relations.  This is not viewed as \"trafficking\" and is 
not illegal in Ghana, but is seen as a way of giving the 
children improved opportunity. 
 
K. (U) We are unaware of any Government officials involved in 
trafficking. 
 
L. (U) Ghanaian Parliament ratified ILO Convention 182 in May 
2001.  Ghana ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child in 1989, becoming one of the first countries do so. 
The Government passed a Children\'s Act in 1998, which 
specifies the rights of children in Ghana and codifies the 
law in such areas as child custody, health, and education. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Para 19, Protection and Assistance to Victims 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
A. (U) Any protection or shelter given to the victims of 
trafficking, either international or domestic, is done on a 
case-by-case basis, as resources are limited.  In many cases, 
the authorities do try to reunite trafficked and abused 
children with their families.  NGOs have sought to provide 
services the police and social services cannot by 
establishing a few crisis centers. However, as awareness of 
the problem grows and trafficking victims seek assistance, 
the limited resources for providing such assistance becomes 
more strapped. 
 
B. (U) See para 17, D. 
 
C. (U) If they are arrested, the victims of international 
trafficking are prosecuted on an occasional, case-by-case 
basis, for offenses such as possession of altered travel 
documents.  In 2000, Ghana Immigration officials detained six 
PRC nationals with fake U.S. visas who were being trafficked 
through Accra from Hong Kong to the United States.  The PRC 
nationals were prosecuted for possession of counterfeit 
documents and sentenced to six months in a local prison. 
 
D. (SBU) We are unaware of trafficking victims\' being 
encouraged to seek redress against traffickers. 
 
E. (U) The Government does not provide specific protection 
for victims of trafficking beyond those available to all 
crime victims or witnesses. 
 
F. (U) Aside from Ghana Immigration,s internal trafficking 
seminars, Post is not aware of any other GOG funded training. 
Much of the specialized training for officials in the past 
year has been sponsored by NGOs with outside donor funds. 
The Women and Juvenile Unit (WAJU) of the National Police, 
using INL funds, is currently working on internal training as 
well as community outreach initiatives on trafficking and 
domestic violence issues. 
 
G. (U) Repatriated victims of trafficking are given 
assistance on an ad hoc basis.  Though the Government has no 
formal program to provide assistance to victims of 
trafficking per se, WAJU assists victims of abuse and 
violence, including trafficking victims.  Crisis centers are 
extremely few. The Department of Social Welfare has a few 
children,s homes and remand homes, but these are generally 
inappropriate and inadequate to deal with trafficking 
victims. Many NGOs, working closely with local authorities, 
are beginning to step in where official resources are lacking 
to provide safe havens, counseling and transportation back 
home. 
 
H. (U) Several NGOs, both local and international, work with 
trafficking victims.  African Centre for Human Development, 
Save the Children UK, Children in Need, Action Aid, Catholic 
Action for Street Children, the Gender and Human Rights 
Documentation Center, Catholic Relief Services, Street Girls 
Aid, ILO/IPEC and UNICEF all work in the areas of child labor 
and support for street children.  These organizations, as 
well as the University of Ghana\'s Center for Social Policy 
Studies, conduct studies into trafficking as part of their 
broader agenda, perform some rescue operations for street 
kids, provide training and education for victims of 
trafficking and abuse, and in some cases, assist with family 
reunification.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/01/2013 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, GH, taxes 
SUBJECT: WAGES AND TAXES:  WEEK\'S EVENTS SET STAGE FOR 
TENSION ON WAGES 
 
Classified By: EconChief F.Day for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (U) Summary: The government is in a very difficult 
position with its ongoing wage negotiations with government 
employees. Its new agreement with the IMF caps the wage bill 
at a 22 percent increase, but it has accepted a 28.6 percent 
increase in the minimum wage.  Holding the average increase 
to 22 percent is going to be difficult, particularly as 
public employees are expecting generous raises to compensate 
for the doubling of petrol prices last January.  Ghana\'s HIPC 
program will be endangered, however, if the GoG does not 
succeed in holding the line on its wage bill.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) Wage negotiations in Ghana typically begin with 
agreement on a new minimum wage.  The rate of increase in 
that wage becomes the benchmark for the rest of the public 
sector, which in turn influences the private sector.  After 
an abortive attempt by the GoG to unilaterally move the 
minimum wage up 26 percent to 9,000 cedis per day ($1.05), 
government, employers and the unions have agreed to 9,200 
cedis.  This is quite a bit less than the 12,000 cedis unions 
had been demanding, and it is not clear that the rank and 
file will accept it. 
 
3. (U) Negotiations on public sector pay above the minimum 
rate have not begun, but Finance Minister Osafo-Maafo\'s 
presentation to Parliament February 27 clarified the fiscal 
constraints within which they will be conducted.  He 
announced many measures to enhance revenue, among them a 7 
1/2 percent \"national reconstruction levy\" on banks that was 
to lapse but which will be continued, a 5 percent levy on 
re-exported goods, the abolition of non-government lotteries 
to give the government lottery a monopoly, direct taxation of 
tro-tro drivers, etc.  Many observers were surprised by the 
absence of an increase in the VAT; we had been told by a 
senior minister it would go up 5 percent.  In fact, 
Osafo-Maafo did announce a 2 1/2 percent increase, but buried 
it in the speech so deftly (under the National Health 
Insurance Scheme)that not even trained economic analysts 
caught the fleeting mention of an increase in levies on 
\"expenditures and transactions,\" i.e., the VAT.  We were 
alerted by an official who knew where in the speech it had 
been inserted. 
 
4. (U) The Minister also announced increases in two taxes on 
petrol:  the road maintenance levy and the debt recovery 
levy; together, these will raise prices at the pump by more 
than 10 percent on top of January\'s near doubling of the 
price. 
 
5. (C) Protectionist tariffs on rice and frozen chicken were 
also added to the package at the last minute, four days 
before the speech.  According to a source at the central 
bank, practically no one knew these were coming.  The IMF is 
said to be upset with these tariffs for a number of reasons: 
it didn\'t like being blindsided, the reversion to 
protectionism seems regressive, and the last minute nature of 
the decision raises governance issues. Particularly so, in 
the view of our central bank source, as the chicken tariff is 
nearly certainly the work of Kwabena Darko, a wealthy and 
very well connected chicken farmer (comment:  we concur in 
this assessment).  These tariffs will raise the cost of 
living for ordinary Ghanaians. 
 
6. (U) The IMF agreement limits the GoG\'s ability to offer 
more in salary increases than can be afforded with these new 
revenue measures but without increased borrowing. The 
mutually agreed upon limit is 22 percent.  Since the increase 
at the bottom end of the scale was nearly 29 percent, other 
workers will be asked to settle for somewhat under 20 
percent.  Workers certainly do not know this yet, and labor 
negotiators trying to boost the minimum wage increase did not 
realize (or perhaps accept) the zero sum nature of what they 
were doing. The more successful they were, the less other 
workers might get later. 
 
7.  (U) Comment:  We may be entering a contentious period. 
There is unsettled business left over from the petroleum 
increases; people are expecting pay raises.  Given Ghana\'s 
current situation, unrealistic expectations may run into 
unpleasant reality--the government simply cannot afford more. 
 Furthermore, a number of provincial officials we have spoken 
to recently have termed a VAT increase on the heels of the 
petrol hikes \"political suicide,\" but fiscal exigencies left 
the GoG no real choice. 
 
8. (U) Comment Continued. While no one noticed the VAT 
increase in Osafo-Maafo\'s address, people will notice it in 
their pockets (store clerks will receive instructions on 
collecting it), and may be even more annoyed at the seemingly 
non-transparent manner in which it came about. They may also 
notice the smallish bump in gas prices. Additionally, 
electricity and water rates were scheduled to go up March 
1st. The stakes are high; ng the line on government borrowing 
is a firm IMF condition on renewal of Ghana\'s HIPC program. 
However, we note a near non-reaction to the doubling of fuel 
prices save two modest labor marches and the usual radio talk 
show froth. The agreement on the minimum wage has also seen 
little protest. Fiscal discipline must balance with domestic 
political concerns--so far the government is keeping its 
balance. End Comment.

1.  (C)   Summary.  Talks between signatories to the 
Marcoussis Accords broke up at 4 a.m. March 7 without 
reaching final agreement on the composition of the new 
government.  Allocation of ministerial portfolios continued 
to be the sticking point, with mechanisms to attribute the 
Defense and Interior portfolios unresolved.  Talks will 
resume midday in the absence of President Kufuor, who left 
today for Burkina Faso, and President Gbagbo, who returned to 
Cote d\'Ivoire yesterday.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) Talks hosted by the GOG with the signatories to the 
Marcoussis Accords began at 12:30 p.m. in Accra at a local 
beachside hotel.  President Gbagbo, invited by the GOG to 
attend Ghana\'s 46th independence day celebrations, waited at 
the Castle (the presidential compound) as President Kufuor 
welcomed the delegations and asked them to work 
conscientiously for peace in Cote d\'Ivoire.  Prime Minister 
Diarra, ECOWAS General Secretary Chambas, UN Representative 
Tevoedjre, various military representatives and others also 
attended. 
 
3.  (C)  Initial rather stale presentations of official 
position papers by the ten delegations were accompanied by 
some \"hard feelings,\" according to GOG Foreign Ministry 
sources emboffs spoke with.  After departure of President 
Kufuor, the delegations commenced discussions on constructing 
a government.  As in the past, a primary sticking point 
remained allocation of the defense and interior portfolios. 
An initial proposal put forward for consideration had Prime 
Minister Diarra assuming direct responsibility for the 
Defense Ministry, with Interior divided in separate 
functions.  Gbagbo\'s representatives apparently did not 
accept this. A subsequent configuration, under which a 
National Security Council, under Diarra\'s direction, with 
representatives of all signatories to the Marcoussis Accords, 
would jointly administer Defense and Interior, was also 
rejected by Gbagbo\'s representatives.  According to our GOG 
sources, Gbagbo insisted on exercising direct control of the 
Council. 
 
4.  (C) The talks, originally scheduled to conclude at 6 p.m. 
continued far into the night and the early morning hours. 
President Kufuor returned to the beachside hotel, to help 
guide discussions (which had proved unwieldy with ten 
delegations present).  He left at approximately 3 a.m., and 
the talks broke up at shortly after 4 a.m.  In an early 
morning radio interview by Ghanaian Foreign Minister 
Owusu-Agyeman, conducted as he saw off President Kufuor on 
his trip to Burkina Faso, the Minister gave the delegations a 
bare \"fifty-fifty chance\" of resolving the impasse.  Speaking 
rather somberly, he offered this brief assessment of where 
the fundamental problem lay: \"Gbagbo has to move.\"  In a 
later brief conversation with Polchief, ECOWAS Executive 
Secretary Chambas said, \"its not quite so hopeless as some 
 
SIPDIS 
are saying,\" and \"we will give it one more shot.\"  Originally 
scheduled to depart today, Chambas has decided to remain and 
continue to work with the delegations. 
 
5.  (C) Comment.   We have the sense from our GOG sources 
that while the \"rebels\" are willing to make some compromises 
(they agreed to accept the Communications and Territorial 
Administration Ministries), they will not accept Gbagbo 
exercising control over the Defense and Interior Ministries. 
Other parties appear ready to accept some mechanism whereby 
the two ministries are put in \"neutral\" hands, but so far not 
the Gabgbo government.  When talks resume at midday, they 
will do so without Gbagbo or Kufuor in Accra to either 
authorize agreement (for the former) or cajole results (for 
the latter).  Fifty-fifty may be optimistic.  End comment. 
 
Abidjan minimize considered.

1. (C)  Ambassador Yates delivered reftel B demarche on 
possible NAM involvement in a UNGA Special Session on Iraq to 
Foreign Minister Hackman Owusu-Agyemang on March 19. 
Ambassador stressed the counterproductive nature of any such 
session while the Security Council remains seized with the 
issue, and that the USG and its coalition partners had 
sufficient legal authority to disarm Iraq under several 
Security Council resolutions.  The Minister replied that 
Ghana was, \"off the record,\" in sympathy with the USG on 
Iraq.  Given what he termed \"national politics\" and the 
tremendous pressure the GOG was under from various sources, 
NAM, Africa Group and others to oppose any intervention in 
Iraq, the GOG would not make any public statement on Iraq. 
 
2. (C)  Owusu-Agyemang noted the confusion in the local media 
over a false report of a call from the Presidency to the 
White House expressing support for USG actions to disarm 
Iraq.  There had been no such phone call made, he said. 
Additionally, in violation of the GOG\'s decision to remain 
silent publicly on Iraq, statements by a Presidency press 
spokesman stating that more time should have been given to UN 
inspectors had been repudiated by the Chief of Staff in later 
remarks to the press, he noted.  Owusu-Agyemang said that the 
local \"anti-war machinery\" was in \"overdrive,\" and his 
government had to exercise caution.  However, in regard to 
any public demonstration that might threaten or impinge upon 
Mission activities (none are planned that this Mission is 
aware of), \"it would be well contained.\" 
 
3. (C)  Ambassador also delivered reftel A demarche on Iraqi 
agents to the Foreign Minister, who pledged to communicate 
our concerns to GOG security forces \"immediately.\"  The 
Ambassador thanked the Minister for the fine level of 
cooperation on security matters.  The Minister concluded by 
saying, \"we recognize the depth of conviction of the United 
States on Iraq,\" and reaffirmed the GOG\'s cooperation on 
security matters.  He said he would be briefing the President 
this afternoon on the details of these demarches.

SUBJECT: PRM/DAS KELLY RYAN\'S MEETINGS WITH OPE STAFF 
 
 
1.  Summary:  PRM/DAS Kelly Ryan visited Accra, Ghana on 
February 28 - March 4 to review U.S. Resettlement 
Program (USRP) operations in West Africa.  This cable is 
one in a series of cables outlining meetings, 
discussions and impressions gleaned from the visit. 
Provided with various opportunities for consultations 
with Overseas Processing Entity (OPE) staff over the 
five-day period, Ryan came away with an appreciation of 
numerous challenges faced following the events of 9/11. 
Increased security checks, the implementation of RAVU, 
limited access to refugee camps and expired medical 
reports added to a significant delay in processing. 
Despite the obstacles nearly 20,000 refugees were 
processed in FY02 indicating the motivation and 
professionalism is there among OPE colleagues to move 
the program in the right direction.  Addressing OPE 
concerns with WRAPS will also keep momentum going.  As a 
result, DAS Ryan came away with a feeling of optimism 
that once the backlog of stalled cases are cleared, the 
operation will move more quickly. End summary. 
 
OPE BRINGS NEW STAFF ON BOARD TO FACE POST 9/11 
CHALLENGES 
 
2.  In background discussions with Refcoord, DAS was 
debriefed on the history of OPE/Accra\'s office.  Only 
two years old, OPE inherited processing responsibilities 
from the Joint Voluntary Agency (JVA) in Nairobi.  Both 
OPE and JVA were awarded cooperative agreements under 
the auspices of Church World Service (CWS) based in NY. 
Within this brief two year period, CWS changed the 
leadership at OPE by replacing previous OPE Director 
Regine McCalla with current Director Frances Tinsley. 
Arriving with a strong background in domestic refugee 
resettlement, Tinsley\'s posting in January of this year 
provided a much-needed boost to OPE operations as it had 
been without a permanent director for nearly six months. 
Tinsley\'s ability to hit the ground running allowed OPE 
to confront processing issues needing immediate 
attention.  Tinsley\'s deputy, Lucie Gagne also brings 
extensive refugee experience to OPE as she has worked at 
both UNHCR and JVA in W. African operations over the 
past six years. 
 
FY 02 OBSTACLES TO SPEEDIER PROCESSING 
 
3.RAVU - Refcoord explained the myriad of issues and 
policy concerns that surfaced following the events of 
9/11.  Acknowledging OPE\'s efforts to address the 
rapidly changing USG policy on resettlement, Refcoord 
informed DAS that despite some Herculean efforts, 
refugees were not moving through the pipeline very 
quickly.  With the much-needed creation of the Refugee 
Access Verification Unit (RAVU) at INS, now called the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), all Priority 3 
(P3) cases were being reviewed for fraud and thus, 
thousands of cases were stalled, while relationship 
claims are being verified with DHS records.  Department 
and DHS expect final resolution of the cases within the 
coming month with word that approval rate of cases 
reviewed by RAVU may be less than 50 per cent.  Once 
this backlog of file review is finalized, OPE and other 
processing partners look forward to processing refugees 
in a timelier manner and with a lower rate of fraud. 
 
4.  Increased Security Provisions  - The USRP has seen a 
number of new security initiatives enacted in the wake 
of 9/11.  As efforts to vet security advisory opinions 
(SAOs) became more cumbersome, OPE as well as other 
processing entities, saw a slow-down in the movement of 
refugees while SAOs trickled in. 
 
5.  Restricted Access to Refugee Camps - Throughout the 
past fiscal year DHS interviews have been limited to 
sites approved by both the post regional security 
officer (RSO) and the DHS.  As a result, much time and 
effort was spent securing acceptable interview sites in 
Accra, Conakry, Banjul and Abidjan.  Collaboration on 
these efforts were laudable as evidenced by the DHS 
circuit ride in Abidjan last year.  When DHS could not 
get to the refugees, the refugees were brought to them. 
Partners successfully moved and processed over 4,000 
refugees residing in camps in the north of Cote d\'Ivoire 
by moving the caseload to Abidjan for adjudication. The 
caseload consisted almost entirely of P-3 Liberians with 
one UNHCR P-1 referral.  Further collaboration allowed 
the processing of smaller caseloads at 
embassies/consulates in Nigeria, the Central African 
Republic, Mali and Niger.  Some of those cases had been 
waiting for processing for years. 
 
6.  Ban on Priority One Cases from UNHCR - Following the 
resettlement scandal at UNHCR/Accra, the Department 
placed a ban on all processing of P-1 Referrals in W. 
Africa.  This ban was in effect for most of FY 02 and 
contributed to the slowing down of processing and 
departures.  Upon DHS review of all UNHCR/Accra cases 
and implemented investigative/corrective measures by 
UNHCR, the Department lifted the ban late last year. 
 
7.  Expired Medical Reports - The majority of refugee 
medical examinations have a validity period of one year, 
with certain cases only having six months.  The 
cessation of departures inevitably led to thousands of 
cases needing second medical exams as the validity 
period came and went.  OPE worked closely with the 
International Office of Migration (IOM) to sift through 
records to determine at which point the case cleared 
RAVU and then needed another medical examination. 
Following the review, thousands of applicants throughout 
W. Africa were rescheduled for medical examinations with 
country panel physicians. 
8.  Cross-Referenced Cases - Due to the high number of 
cases that were linked, OPE soon discovered that if one 
family was not cleared for departure either for waiting 
for security approval, medical re-examination or RAVU 
approval, neither case would be allowed to travel. 
Acknowledging the size of many refugee families, this 
obstacle proved significant in the slowing down of 
processing.  (Comment: This issue is being tackled in 
part, by Tinsley who maintains that many cases were 
inappropriately hard cross-referenced by OPE staff prior 
to her arrival. End comment) 
 
DESPITE OBSTACLES, 20,000 PROCESSED IN FIVE MONTHS 
 
9.  Despite the numerous challenges faced by OPE and 
partners during the past fiscal year, 19,500 refugees 
were processed in just five months.  In addition, 
interviews were conducted in nine countries throughout 
W. Africa.  Consolidation of Visas 92 and Visas 93 
efforts at OPE has also nearly eliminated a 10 year 
backlog at post. Initially handed approximately 600 
Visas 92 and 93 cases, OPE has sifted through the 
caseload and in collaboration with Post, resolved most 
of the cases.  OPE expects to move all several hundred 
eligible Visas 92 and 93 cases this fiscal year. 
 
FY 03 - RESOLVING OLD ISSUES, STREAMLINING FUTURE 
OPERATIONS 
 
10. RAVU Revoked cases - OPE informed DAS Ryan that 
approximately 70 per cent of previously approved cases 
in W. Africa are expected to be revoked in the coming 
months.  Furthermore, of those cases not yet 
interviewed, at least 50 per cent will never make it 
past RAVU to the INS interview stage.  While this 
reduction in the pipeline will affect previous 
projections significantly, OPE believes it can still 
complete processing for and move 4,000 people this 
fiscal year. 
 
11. WRAPS Needs Tweaking - OPE data staff provided DAS 
Ryan with an overview of concerns regarding the newly 
implemented World Wide Refugee Admissions Processing 
System (WRAPS).  While seeing WRAPS as a necessary 
improvement from the old system, OPE outlined technical 
delays in design construction that have caused 
difficulty in maneuvering through the system.  Refcoord 
confirmed with OPE that most concerns involved technical 
improvements scheduled for the future that had not been 
made in what OPE viewed as a timely manner.  DAS Ryan 
took OPE\'s concerns on board and promised to raise 
concerns with Washington upon her return.  (Note: 
Refcoord has raised OPE\'s concerns with WRAPS program 
Manager Amy Nelson who is considering sending an 
additional team to OPE/Accra as a follow up to initial 
installation.  A similar effort was successfully made in 
Moscow to tweak the system and provide a training review 
for OPE staff. End Note) 
 
12.  Cultural Orientation - Cultural Deputy Director 
Emily Russ provided DAS Ryan with an overview of 
operations in W. Africa.  Confirming that refugees were 
only scheduled for CO after clearing RAVU, Russ 
described the curriculum, which includes a heavy 
emphasis on self-sufficiency and U.S. law.  Russ was 
pleased to be developing a new section for youths. 
 
13.  Comment:  It is clear that the obstacles facing OPE 
and the USRP as a whole during FY 02 were significant. 
While these obstacles contributed to frustration among 
partners, domestic voluntary agencies and refugees 
alike, it appears that the frustration may soon ebb. 
Methodically and collaboratively working through the 
challenges and resolving the thousands of cases pending 
RAVU and security clearances will release the logjam in 
the system.  Despite OPE\'s concerns with the WRAPS 
network, it appears that the problems as outlined are 
scheduled to be resolved as each successive build is 
completed.  In the interim, the possibility of a second 
WRAPS TDY support visit might be just the trick needed 
to tweak the system and assuage OPE concerns.  End 
comment.

1. Summary: USDA representatives met with numerous Ghanaian 
officials to seek support for the US position on food aid and 
market access in the WTO Agricultural Negotiations, to 
highlight US efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa and to confirm 
invites to the Ministerial Conference and Expo on 
Agricultural Science and Technology. With the March 31 
deadline for modalities on the agriculture agreement, USG 
officials urged the Ghanaians to move on these issues before 
time runs out. End Summary. 
 
2. Patricia Sheikh, Deputy Administrator of International 
Trade Policy at the USDA, Emiko Purdy and Joseph Lopez, 
International Trade Policy economists and Jamie Rothschild, 
the Regional Foreign Agricultural Service Officer, held 
bilateral discussions with GoG officials in Accra on March 
17. The session was opened by Deputy Minister of Agriculture 
Dr. M.K. Antwi, who stated that Ghana needed to be allowed 
further access to outside markets. 
 
---------------- 
WTO Negotiations 
---------------- 
 
3. Sheikh, Purdy and Lopez were focused on delivering the USG 
message on current WTO Agricultural Negotiations, 
specifically, concerning the strengthening of the modalities 
proposed by Stuart Harbinson, the chair of the agricultural 
negotiations. Ghana has not stated its position on food aid. 
Patricia Sheikh suggested that as a recipient of food aid, 
Ghana should use its influence in the Africa group to support 
the US suggestion that non-governmental organizations and 
legitimate government-to-government food aid be allowed to 
continue. Essentially, if Ghana derives some benefit from 
food aid, its WTO representative should speak up in support 
of food aid. Sheikh carefully pointed out that the US 
supports preventing food aid from displacing commercial sales 
and disrupting local production. However, the experts in Rome 
at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations are those best equipped to determine whether and what 
kind of food aid is market-distorting, not the WTO. Ghanaian 
officials appeared seized by the idea and promised to 
carefully consider the US position on the issue. 
 
4. Harmonization is key to the US position on domestic 
support and market access and the Harbinson text is not 
ambitious enough. Too much trade distorting domestic support 
is allowed for many countries (i.e. the EU) and the tariff 
reduction formula does not address the high protection levels 
of tariffs. Domestic supports reduction should be reworked to 
address the serious disparity between the EU and the rest of 
the world. Regarding tariff rediction, USDA officials 
supported the Swiss formula for cutting tariffs which would 
bring tariffs down to no more than 25 percent. The Ghanaians, 
while agreeing with the need to reduce domestic supports that 
rich countries give their farmers, quickly pointed out 
tariffs are the only option they have to protect their 
domestic farm industry. US negotiators then pointed out that 
the bottom line on the two issues is--for the US to give up 
something, other countries must do their share and give up 
something too. The EU must be able to move on the domestic 
support issue. Poor countries should be able to move on the 
tariff issue. Otherwise, negotiations will not go forward. 
Ghanaian officials said they would rely on their Geneva 
colleagues (one of whom was present) to provide further 
guidance on the two issues. 
 
------------- 
US Assistance 
------------- 
 
5. In response to the need expressed by the Ghanaian 
contingent for assistance in improving sanitary and 
phyto-sanitary regulations, Purdy pointed to the nine 
regional training and information seminars that the USDA had 
conducted in sub-Saharan Africa over the past two years. She 
also told Ghanaian officials that an Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS) agent being assigned to Accra. The 
agent will be a part of the West African Trade Hub and will 
assist with technical assessment of agricultural products 
destined to the US. USDA cautioned that the due diligence on 
marketing will not be done by the APHIS agent. That, Sheikh 
said, is up to the Ghanaians. Assessing their own 
competitiveness on a given product should be carefully 
considered when developing agricultural exports for the US 
market. 
 
---------------------- 
Ministerial Conference 
---------------------- 
 
6. US Agriculture officials also clarified the schedule of 
activities and logistics for the upcoming Ministerial 
Conference and Expo on Agricultural Science and Technology to 
be held in Sacramento June 23-25 and hosted by Agriculture 
Secretary Ann Veneman. Ghanaian officials wanted further 
 
SIPDIS 
details on the schedule of events in order to determine which 
Ministers would derive the most benefit in attending. They 
promised to inform the Embassy who will attend before the May 
registration deadline.

2.  (C)  Summary: Regional Refugee Coordinator (Refcoord) for

Immigration Officer Elizabeth Snow to discuss refugee

(P-3) cases.  Upon review, the Canadians would consider some 
for eventual admission to the Canadian refugee program. 
Asked whether the possibility existed to share information on 
the reason for revocation/denial, Snow stated fraudulent 
relationships would not necessarily rule applicants out. 
Refcoord promised to convey request to Washington.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Refcoord paid a courtesy call on Elizabeth Snow of 
the Canadian High Commission to discuss refugee issues in 
West Africa.  Following background discussion, Snow explained 
that due to heavy domestic political pressure, she had been 
given a message to quote shake the trees unquote to find more 
numbers for the refugee resettlement program in Canada.  With 
a world wide ceiling of 7,300 of which 400 are slated for W. 
African admissions, Canada expects at the current rate to 
come up quite short for the admissions year which ends in 
December.  Commiserating that UNHCR Priority one (P-1) 
referrals were slow in coming, Snow asked whether the USG 
would be interested in sharing information on RAVU 
revoked/denied P-3 cases.  Not promising large scale 
resettlement, Snow opined that after reviewing a sampling of 
cases and disregarding relationship fraud, as opposed to 
direct misrepresentation, the Canadians could possibly 
resettle some 1,000 of the USRP\'s W. African P-3 caseload. 
Refcoord promised Snow that her proposal would be conveyed to 
the appropriate figures in the USG. 
 
3.  (C) Comment: It appears that the U.S. is not the only 
country experiencing domestic political pressure to increase 
refugee arrivals.  At first glance, sharing case file 
information under current MOU\'s with Canada with the aim of 
eventually resettling this caseload may be a good opportunity 
to burden-share with our neighbor.  However, given that this 
P-3 caseload in W. Africa is anchor-based, albeit often 
fraudulently so, the USG may eventually have to contend with 
the effects of secondary migration. 
 
4.  (C) Action Request: Post requests Department guidance on 
the Canadian proposal to share information on RAVU 
denied/revoked P-3 cases for possible resettlement in Canada.

1. (C) SUMMARY:  The National Reconciliation Commission (NRC) 
continues the balancing act of assembling a historical record 
of human rights abuses while avoiding politically charged 
proceedings.  It faced its most difficult public proceedings 
yet when the independent journalist Kwaku Baako deviated from 
his expected testimony to offer hearsay evidence.  He said 
that former President Jerry John Rawlings, in unrelated 
incidents, ordered and supervised torture sessions and the 
extra-judicial killing of a former colleague.  The testimony 
invoked cheers and jeers from spectators ) the first hint of 
the political circus that the NRC is struggling to avoid. 
The NRC has invited former President Rawlings to submit a 
written  response to the various allegations.  The opposition 
NDC party, complaining about the admission of hearsay 
evidence, fears (or claims to fear) the witch hunt has begun. 
The NRC would welcome public testimony from Rawlings, and 
Rawlings himself told Poloff in a March 20 meeting that he 
will appear if asked.  Such testimony could be a useful 
exploration of a very violent period in Ghana\'s history; it 
could also polarize political factions.   END SUMMARY 
 
-------------------------- 
Journalist Testimony 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) On March 11, Kwaku Baako testified as a witness in 
the torture case of the late Mawuli Goka (son of a Nkrumah 
government Finance Minister) who was tried for treason and 
executed.  While not an eyewitness to the torture, Baako was 
imprisoned with Goka and saw the scars on his body.  He 
offered very compelling and disturbing testimony on the 
abuses heaped on those imprisoned. During the testimony, 
Baako also alleged that former President Rawlings ordered and 
supervised torture sessions, and also executions, in cases 
not before the Commission that day.  None of these comments 
were based upon personal knowledge.  His testimony, before a 
packed house, evoked strong reaction from the crowd, and some 
hostility to probing questions put to him by opposing 
attorneys.  Much discussion ensued in local newspapers and 
radio stations on the testimony, and Rawlings\' NDC party 
issued a formal statement criticizing the Commission for 
allowing such uncorroborated hearsay testimony to transpire. 
 
3. (C) Poloffs met with NRC Executive Secretary Ken Attafuah 
March 21 to discuss the Baaku testimony and further 
proceedings.  Attafuah initially noted that the NRC was a 
quasi-judicial body designed for victim reconciliation as 
much as formal fact finding.  As such, the rules of evidence 
used in a court of law were not binding, but used only as \"a 
guide\".  The healing function of the NRC, he said, made it 
necessary to afford victims the full opportunity to express 
themselves. 
 
4.  (C) Although disconcerted by Baaku\'s sudden straying into 
matters not before the Commission, Attafuah said that 
Commission members were generally hesitant to interrupt 
witnesses who offered hearsay testimony in the midst of 
emotional recitations of events.  This might be construed as 
\"inappropriately stifling\" testimony.  Such evidence would be 
admissible, he said, but would only be used in the findings 
of the NRC if the weight of further testimony and 
investigation warranted it.  Generally speaking, NRC 
procedures sought to avoid the surprises seen in Baako\'s 
testimony, he further explained.  Those testifying are asked 
to put their testimony in writing, allowing the accused 
advanced warning and preparation.  Baako did not submit his 
free-ranging and unconnected accusations about Rawlings to 
the NRC in advance.  Attafuah asserted that the Commission 
was anxious to avoid the circus-like atmosphere that often 
prevailed at the human rights commission hearings in Nigeria, 
and he and Commission members were not about to let such 
\"straying\" occur regularly. 
 
------------------------------ 
Possible Rawlings\' Testimony 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Turning to the subject of former President Rawlings\' 
possible testimony, Dr. Attafuah stated that the NRC has sent 
a letter to Rawlings requesting a written response to the 
Baaku accusations.  The Commission had also sent several 
other letters on unrelated cases, also inviting a response. 
The Commission had yet to invite Rawlings to appear 
personally before the Commission, and would not consider 
doing so before it had heard from a number of other 
witnesses. Any decision requesting his appearance would not 
be based solely upon the as-yet unsubstantiated hearsay 
testimony of Baaku. 
 
6.  (C) Attafuah suggested that Rawlings would likely be 
eager to appear, and would make a compelling witness.  There 
were a number of people in contact with the Commission, he 
commented, who would attest to their lives being saved by 
Rawlings during the very turbulent times when Rawlings first 
came to power.  Rawlings was the central figure in the 1979 
and 1981 coups, he commented, and led the PNDC government for 
12 years, a period when many abuses occurred.  No testimony 
from Rawlings, he said, would significantly diminish the 
impact and the work of the Commission. 
 
-------------------- 
Rawlings\' Meeting 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Polchief met with Rawlings and an aide March 19, and 
confirmed that Rawlings had received letters from the 
Commission inviting written responses.  Regarding the Kwaku 
Baaku testimony, the former President said his legal team 
(led by former Speaker and Supreme Court Justice D. F. Annan) 
would essentially reply that \"I don\'t comment on hearsay 
testimony.\"  Although much perturbed by the Kwaku Baaku 
submissions, Rawlings said that if invited to appear before 
the Commission, he would do so \"willingly.\" 
 
8. (C) Rawlings, agitated and emotional, said repeatedly that 
he had only witnessed a single execution during his time as 
an officer in the Air Force, and, later, as Head of State: 
that of a fellow member of the armed forces involved in the 
murder of Ghanaian judges in 1982 who had been properly tried 
and found guilty.  He denied overseeing torture sessions.  He 
saw the Kwaku Baaku testimony, he said, as \"one more example 
of the NPP trying to ruin the NDC and myself.\"  He also 
asserted that, should he appear, he would have ample examples 
of how he in fact restrained \"the boys\" during a time when 
many abuses did indeed occur, and many more killings \"could 
easily have happened.\" 
 
----------------- 
Comment 
----------------- 
 
9.  (C) Comment.  Kwaku Baaku, local journalist and political 
gadfly, runs a local paper in which he attacks Rawlings in 
nearly every issue. The Commission could easily have 
anticipated Baaku \"straying\" from his anticipated testimony. 
Perhaps it simply chose to let him proceed, and raise 
explosive issues that it must, in time, examine in more 
comprehensive fashion. In any case, the issue is now joined, 
and both the Commission and Rawlings\' handlers assert they 
are ready and willing to have him testify in open session. 
Rawlings, still a very skilled and charismatic speaker, will 
be no pushover. 
 
10.  (C) Comment continued.  Testimony by Rawlings on his 
role in the 1979 and 1981 coups, and on abuses during his 
time as head of state, will make great political theater.  If 
he is indeed allowed to tell his story as he sees it, and 
bring witnesses to support him, the Commission may, through 
that testimony, and the testimony of the many victims who 
suffered grievously, shed an accurate light on some very dark 
moments in Ghanaian history.  However, avoiding descent into 
catcalls and general chaos will require a firmer 
administrative hand on proceedings than that exhibited during 
the Baaku testimony. End comment.

SUBJECT: IMF REP\'S PRIMARILY POSITIVE READOUT 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Mary Carlin Yates for reasons 1.5 (b) 
 and (d) 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Ambassador Mary Carlin Yates and econoff 
visited Enrique de la Piedra, the IMF Resident Representative 
on March 20. De la Piedra offered a positive readout of the 
Budget now under Parliamentary review and Multiple Donor 
Budget Support. The Resident Representative finds affinity 
with his working level colleagues and leadership in the Bank 
of Ghana and the Ministry of Economic Planning and Regional 
Cooperation, finds it occasionally difficult to work with the 
Ministry of Finance and is wary of the messages put out by 
the Minister of Trade and Industry.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
The Budget 
---------- 
 
2. (U) Despite the surprise tariff increases, de la Piedra 
was very positive about the Budget (septel). The IMF was 
looking for adequate revenue mobilization (i.e. taxes) effort 
and zero domestic debt financing. The IMF also is seeking 
better expenditure controls.  There are revenue enhancement 
measures in the budget that please the IMF. He also noted 
that the government understands that it cannot encourage 
investment if banks realize bigger gains assuming government 
debt instead of lending to local businesses. The GoG\'s 
spending will have to come under control. De la Piedra was 
slightly concerned about timing, as control of domestic debt 
and expenditure and revenue mobilization are usually more 
difficult in an election year. 
 
-------------------------- 
Multi Donor Budget Support 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The Ambassador asked about Multi Donor Budget Support 
(MDBS) in Ghana and pointed out that better coordination 
between donors is a logical step.  The Resident 
Representative sees Multi Donor Budget Support as an overall 
plus for both sides. The Government of Ghana saves on 
transaction costs for financing projects and the donors 
increase their clout in Ghana and the region. De la Piedra 
cautioned that the only way MDBS will work is if the GoG uses 
the funds adequately to address the needs of the Ghanaian 
people. The money will not be available in the future if the 
funds are misused now. The Ambassador did not share the 
current position of USAID that the USG will not be able to 
sign this framework agreement but this was stated at the 
March 24 Mini-CG held in Accra. 
 
------------- 
Bank of Ghana 
------------- 
 
4. (U) De la Piedra, The International Monetary Fund Resident 
Representative, described himself as a link between the IMF 
team in Washington, the Government of Ghana and the donor 
partners. He has good relations with his interlocutors at the 
Bank of Ghana (BOG), noting that Bank Governor Paul Acquah 
and his special assistant, Mahamadou Bawumia speak the same 
language as the IMF. He commented that the Bank Governor is 
doing well in a difficult job. De la Piedra noted how the 
tables have turned for Acquah, a 20-year veteran of the IMF, 
now answering to Ghana\'s market and political pressures as 
well as the donor community. Overall, de la Piedra believes 
the BOG is on the right track. It is keeping monetary policy 
under tight control and working to improve the financial 
market (i.e., Acquah\'s work to improve the FOREX market). 
 
5. (U) The more difficult issue, according to de la Piedra, 
is restructuring the Bank of Ghana itself. Ambassador Yates 
noted Acquah\'s concern about capturing more of the funds that 
are currently outside the banking system. De la Piedra 
responded, saying that the primary concern should be the 
market itself, i.e., what is in the banking sector, not what 
is not. The Bank needs to create incentives for people to 
bring their money into the formal banking sector. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Ministry of Economic Planning and Regional Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6. (C) De la Piedra\'s primary concern is the linking of the 
Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy to the Budget, a difficult 
task due to the internal wrangling between Minister of 
Economic Planning and Regional Cooperation Paa Kwesi Nduom 
and the Minister of Finance, Yaw Osafo-Maafo. De la Piedra 
also confided that there is some suspicion that Nduom, a 
minority party candidate (Convention People\'s Party) from 
Cape Coast, was awarded his position because he was \"robbed\" 
of the Parliamentary seat. Nevertheless, Nduom is doing well 
with a small but talented staff. De la Piedra also weighed in 
the Cabinet shake-up rumors that have plagued the Kufuor 
Administration for the last year and half by noting that 
Nduom has been mentioned as a replacement Minister of Finance 
should Osafo-Maafo stumble. 
 
------------------- 
Ministry of Finance 
------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) While he found the BOG pragmatic, he observed the 
Minister of Finance Osafo-Maafo and his Special Assistant 
Tony Osei to be primarily politically motivated. De la Piedra 
noted that during the rocky period between the IMF and the 
GoG last fall, it was difficult to get on the same page as 
the Finance Minister regarding the problems with the budget 
overruns. 
------------------------------ 
Ministry of Trade and Industry 
------------------------------ 
8. (C) Most worrying to de la Piedra is the Minister of Trade 
and Industry Kofi Konadu Apraku. De la Piedra sees a trend in 
Apraku\'s public speeches and comments that is not good. De la 
Piedra saw the rice and chicken tariff increases in the 
budget as the handiwork of Minister Apraku. De la Piedra 
warned that we (the international donor community) need to 
apply more pressure on the tariff issue to ensure that Ghana 
does not go that route. (Note: The Ambassador raised the 
issue and our concerns about the augmented tariffs on rice 
and poultry with the Minister of Agriculture on March 26, but 
with little satisfaction.) The domestic content bill is 
another example of Apraku\'s artful vilification of trade 
liberalization policies. While the bill will conform in 
language to Ghana\'s bi- and multi- lateral contractual 
obligations, domestic firms will be given more help 
(unspecified).

SUBJECT: RULING PARTY WINS FOURTH BY-ELECTION IN A ROW 
 
 
Classified By: Polchief Richard Kaminski, reason 1.5(B/D). 
 
NPP Wins Big 
------------ 
 
1.  (U) On March 25 the Ruling NPP party won its fourth 
consecutive by-election since assuming power in January 
of 2001, handily defeating the leading opposition 
candidate of the NDC, and two small party candidates. 
By a vote of 12,220 to 4,929 for the NDC (with 3,705 for 
the PNC candidate and 241 for the DPP nominee), the NPP 
retained the far northern constituency of Navrongo. While 
the NPP parliamentary majority remains slim (102 NPP MPs 
to 90 for the NDC, with seven small party and independent 
MPs split between the two), the strength of the victory 
underscores the present dominance of the NPP, which is able 
to marshal significantly superior resources and play 
local politics to perfection. 
 
Powers of Incumbency 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Since the advent of the Fourth Republic in 1993, 
the Navrongo constituency has been hotly contested between 
the NPP and NDC, the seat changing hands several times in 
very close votes in both general and by-elections (required 
this time after the NPP MP perished in a car accident 
several months ago). In anticipation of another close 
contest, the NPP national executive set up shop in the 
Navrongo constituency well before any of the other parties, 
and conducted an intensive door-to-door campaign from 
start to finish.  The Vice President, Aliu Mahama, a 
northerner, scoured the constituency the final two full 
days of the campaign, opening projects, promising 
assistance, and pressing for support.  Teams of workers 
from the Electricity Company of Ghana busied themselves 
hooking up electricity to small and previously neglected 
communities up to the day before the vote.  On election 
day, teams of NPP bicyclists wheeled the elderly and 
infirm to the polls.  Senior officials of the party and 
the government patrolled the polling stations, offering 
handshakes and backslaps to party agents overseeing 
votes (the agents attended four separate training 
sessions on their election-day duties).  Neither the DNC 
nor the two smaller parties could match the 
NPP campaign steamroller. Continuing splits within the 
NDC also hurt its chances, as it played catch-up without 
a full complement of campaign personalities on hand to 
offset the NPP\'s circulating collection of ruling party 
luminaries. 
 
Not All Was Squeaky Clean 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Before, during and after the election, the NDC 
made its now traditional accusations of vote buying, 
suggesting the NPP freely distributed roofing tin, sacks 
of rice, clothing, and other items of use to impoverished 
constituents, as well as making cash payments to village 
elders and traditional leaders.  While these accusations 
are unconfirmed, they are a traditional part of Ghanaian 
politics, and a practice the NDC excelled in when they 
ran the government.  Indeed, all parties quietly engage 
in such petty trading with the electorate.  Such 
pot-calling-the-kettle-black complaints do not register 
greatly with the Ghanaian public. 
 
4.  (SBU) Of greater concern for the integrity of the 
campaign, the Ghanaian National Police required the NDC 
to \"reschedule\" a series of campaign rallies for the 
duration of the Vice President\'s visit, the last two 
full days of the campaign.  The ostensible reason for 
the ban on NDC rallies was the need to avoid \"clashes\" 
between the two camps.  In effect, the NDC sat on its 
hands while the NPP brought in its heaviest campaign 
artillery at the very end of the contest.  This was the 
third time out of four by-elections the NPP government 
imposed such \"rescheduling,\" once again mirroring tactics 
employed by the NDC when it held the reins of power. 
 
5.  (SBU) There were also many rumors of the use of 
\"Macho Men,\" campaign thugs, to intimidate the opposition. 
Both the NDC and NPP feared the use of such bullying 
tactics, and NPP officials told us they did indeed bring 
\"youths\" to town, strictly out of concern, so they 
claimed, for NDC thugs intervening at polling stations. 
However, Polchief circulating on election day saw little 
sign of such Macho Men.  Election Commission officials 
ran a competent and secure process, and police, army, 
and other security personnel oversaw polling in a neutral 
and even-handed manner. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) With four by-election victories in a row (only one 
a close contest), the NPP appears nearly unbeatable in such 
concentrated contests, in which it can pour in resources 
and personnel far beyond the capacity of the other 
parties.  While Vice Presidential visits, last minute 
electricity hook-ups, and even \"honorariums\" for local 
dignitaries are traditional campaign practices, enforced 
\"rescheduling\" of opposition political rallies is another 
order of political shenanigan entirely.  It also appears 
to have been unnecessary, given the wide margin of 
victory.  There are two more by-elections pending in the 
near future, one an NPP seat and one an NDC constituency. 
NPP victories in those campaigns will thoroughly discourage 
an opposition already psychologically on the ropes.  The 
NPP is a popular government, its campaign team is 
experienced, well-resourced and determined, and it is 
intent on keeping its string of victories intact. 
Opposition success will be hard to come by.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  West African Regional Refugee Coordinator 
for Admissions met with International Organization for 
Migration (IOM) Head of Mission to discuss the findings of 
the recent inspector general\'s investigation at IOM branch 
office Banjul.  The team concluded that fraud concerns only 
reached the Canadian resettlement program.  While no solid 
evidence of wrongdoing was uncovered, the IG team left Banjul 
sufficiently suspicious to recommend a down-sizing and 
restructuring of the office to include the removal of the 
staffer in question.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Upon his return from consultations in Geneva, HOM 
Antonio Palosa debriefed Refcoord on the findings of the 
recent IG investigation of IOM Branch Office Banjul. 
Relieved that the concerns outlined in ref a. only reached 
the Canadian program, Palosa appeared confident that fraud 
had not tainted the US Refugee Program (USRP).  Providing a 
brief readout of the investigation, Palosa relayed concerns 
about lack of corroborating testimony from refugees.  Upon 
hearing of the arrival of the investigatory team, refugees 
deliberately maintained a very low profile providing little 
concrete testimony of the alleged fraud perpetrated by 
staffer Gomez.  Despite the lack of detailed testimony, the 
IG uncovered other, potentially damaging evidence that 
something was amiss at the office.  Specifically, Gomez had 
over 20 refugee case files for the Canadian program in her 
desk drawer that should have been handed over to the 
Canadians.  The files were at various stages of the 
resettlement process and there was no reasonable explanation 
as to why these specific cases were held up. 
 
3.  (C)  Palosa expects that the IOM/Banjul office will be 
re-shuffled and down-sized.  Although the IG staff 
recommended the firing of Gomez, their recommendation must be 
approved by their IG superiors in Geneva.  Assuming this 
approval will come through, Palosa believed that Gomez will 
be one of a significant number of staff to lose their job. 
Noting that there are not many cases left in Banjul that need 
to depart, IOM is using this opportunity to down-size and 
leave a more appropriately sized staff of only two or three 
to run operations. 
 
4.  (C) Comment:  While it is certainly good news that IOM 
does not believe the alleged fraud reached the USRP and also 
that remedial action is being taken, refugee watchers should 
maintain close scrutiny of the office.  As little evidence 
was provided by affected refugees, IOM has not managed to 
discover the true depth of the alleged fraud.  Furthermore, 
given the refugees\' reluctance to speak, it remains to be 
seen if there has been some sort of quid pro quo for their 
silence.  End comment.

Once More With Feeling 
---------------------- 
 
1.  (U)  Thirteen days after its convincing by-election win 
in Navrongo (reftel), President Kufuor\'s ruling New Patriotic 
Party (NPP) won by a similarly large margin in the Gomoa East 
by-election March 8.  The NPP candidate received 11,380 votes 
to the NDC\'s 5,356 (a minor party candidate received 175 
votes).  With this victory, the fifth consecutive win over 
former President Rawling\'s NDC in parliamentary by-elections, 
the NPP held a seat vacant since the death of its MPP in a 
car accident several months ago. 
 
NDC Claims Electoral Fraud 
-------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  In increasingly histrionic terms, the NDC has 
claimed electoral fraud and voter intimidation.  Rawlings, 
the day before the by-election, held an emotional press 
conference in which he alleged \"incredible electoral 
malpractices,\" including \"officially-sanctioned violence,\" 
which, he alleged, were \"brazen and seemingly 
institutionalized.\"  Immediately after the announcement of 
the results by the Electoral Commission, the NDC General 
Secretary Dr. Josiah-Aryeh announced his party\'s rejection of 
 
SIPDIS 
the results (without specifying what, if any, actions he or 
other party officials would take as a result).  Rawlings also 
called upon Ghanaians to join a \"March for Survival\" called 
by the NDC to protest the NPP government\'s \"disastrous 
economic policies,\" \"entrenched nepotism,\" and \"gross abuse 
of incumbency.\" 
 
3.  (SBU)  However, the election was in fact largely peaceful 
and uneventful, but for a few isolated shouting matches 
between rival party supporters.  Emboffs circulating on 
election day saw no sign of harassment or intimidation of 
voters.  In an election with a relatively low turnout by 
Ghanaian standards, approximately 40 percent, many election 
officials had little to do during long hours of slow voting 
on a hot and humid day (all polling stations located out of 
doors) but fan themselves and find a bit of shade.  Officers 
from the British Mission had observations similar to our own. 
 A nine-member team from a prominent local NGO, the Center 
for Democratic Development, declared the results to be \"free 
and fair despite some incidents.\" 
 
NPP Takes No Prisoners 
---------------------- 
 
 4.  (SBU)  The NPP government does employ its powers of 
incumbency without hesitation.  As in Navrongo, Vice 
President Aliu Mahama toured the constituency for several 
days just before the election as part of an \"official\" trip 
to the Central Region, and police canceled 
previously-scheduled NDC rallies ostensibly for his 
\"security\" (this time the NDC refused to reschedule several 
of them).  Crews from the government-owned Electricity 
Company of Ghana feverishly hung poles and strung wire from 
community to community up to and including election day, and 
extra road crews worked on farms roads across the area. The 
funeral of the deceased MP, two days before the vote, became 
an extended NPP roadshow, with the coffin taken from town to 
town, and President Kufuor attending services.  Direct cash 
payments to traditional leaders, and \"gifts\" of roofing tin, 
fuel, cloth and other items to constituents, while difficult 
to confirm, are common practice by all political parties. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (C)  One more by-election comes in two weeks time, this 
in a constituency vacant after the NDC MP resigned for 
\"personal reasons.\"  Some of those reasons include division 
and disenchantment within NDC ranks.  While the NPP devotes 
considerable resources to by-elections, the NDC, out of 
power, out of money, and out of favor with the electorate, 
strains to compete.  Local reaction to former President 
Rawlings broad attack on the Kufuor government has been 
relatively muted; his comments simply do not reflect the 
actual experience of Ghanaians.  One worry: while the NPP 
takes great delight in handing the NDC yet another crushing 
loss, the level of emotion on the part of some NDC activists 
is rising; they are beginning to substitute hot-headed 
threats for cool analysis of their own poor showing.  Another 
stinging defeat may be coming their way.  End comment.

SUBJECT: UNHCR/ACCRA READOUT ON POSSIBLE P-2 GROUP IN GUINEA 
 
 
 (U)  1.  Summary:  UNHCR/Accra officer Catherine Hammon 
provided a read-out on her recent trip to Guinea to assess 
refugee groups on possible resettlement needs.  Hammon was 
positive that some 600 refugees from both Conakry and Dabola 
could be categorized and identified clearly as a Priority 2 
group for referral to the USG.  While hard-file case review 
would need to be conducted due to shortcomings in 
registration efforts, if given the proper attention, UNHCR 
could work speedily to identify the group for resettlement. 
USG support for this effort is encouraged in order to not 
only help this group in need but also to strengthen the 
legitimacy of UNHCR/Accra\'s regional resettlement role in 
West Africa.  End summary. 
 
 (U)  2.  Regional Refugee Coordinator for Admissions met 
with Catherine Hammon and Peter Trotter of UNHCR/Accra\'s 
regional resettlement division to discuss findings from 
Hammon\'s recent mission to Guinea.  The purpose of Hammon\'s 
trip was to assess the potential for identifying groups in 
the country for third country resettlement. Hammon focused on 
Liberian refugees who had been multiply displaced within 
Sierra Leone and Guinea.  Hammon determined that some 200 
were living in Conakry while another 400 resided in Dabola. 
 
(U) 3.  The 200 Liberian refugees in Conakry have been 
through a registration but the electronic data gathered on 
them by UNHCR is minimal.  Since UNHCR sees the condition of 
quote multiply displaced end quote as the identifier in 
recognizing these refugees as a set group it is imperative to 
research hard copy files to determine the extent to which 
they were displaced. 
 
(U) 4.  The 400 Liberian refugees in Dabola have also been 
through a registration and once again, the electronic data 
gathered is minimal.  Hammon believes the actual number of 
refugees in this group might be smaller than the commonly 
accepted figure of 650, as some may have registered twice in 
hopes of getting additional ration cards.  As a result, 
Hammon has asked the UNHCR officer in Dabola to conduct an 
informal information gathering exercise of the Liberians in 
the camp to determine actual numbers and history of flight. 
Hammon stressed that the exercise was not/not conducted in a 
manner that would indicate an interest by UNHCR in eventual 
resettlement of the population.  While the totals are not in, 
Hammon expects the number of 650 to reduce to approximately 
400 who would meet the definition of multiply displaced. 
 
(U)  5.  Since the UNHCR database for both groups does not 
capture the origin of displacement, Hammon feels it would be 
necessary to cross-reference hard copy files that are being 
stored in Conakry.  In addition, she feels that 
UNHCR/Freetown could be called upon to assist as well since 
it maintains some old documents on this caseload from when it 
was in Sierra Leone.  Acknowledging that it could be a 
tedious task, Hammon nevertheless is optimistic that the 
necessary information could be gathered within a couple 
months. 
 
(U) 6.  Comment:  Hammon\'s assessment mission to Guinea is 
the first in hopefully more missions to come from 
UNHCR/Accra\'s regional resettlement office.  Indeed, this is 
the signal that needs to be sent out indicating a tangible 
change in UNHCR thinking on resettlement in the region. 
While the population is not necessarily large in comparison 
to past P-2 groups, it is important that the USG support this 
effort in order to not only assist this needy group but to 
further legitimize UNHCR/Accra\'s role in the region and 
capitalize on the momentum set for identifying P-2 groups in 
W. Africa. End comment.

SUBJECT: INFLATION CONTINUES TO CREEP UP 
 
 
1.  Summary:  The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) statistics 
for March show that strong inflationary pressures continue 
to bedevil the Ghanaian economy.  Most analysts believe the 
GoG/IMF inflation target of 9 percent at the end of 2003 is 
unachievable. End Summary 
 
2.  Figures released by the GSS showed that prices rose by 
29.9 percent between March 2002 and March 2003, compared to 
the 29.4 for February 2002 to February 2003.  The official 
inflation rate is currently at its highest level since 
September 2001.  The GSS said a 3.3 percent increase in the 
price of food and beverages and a 5.9 percent rise in the 
cost of housing and utilities during March were the main 
contributing factors. 
 
3.  A sharp rise in the inflation rate from 16.3 percent in 
January to 29.4 percent in February generated a lot of 
controversy over the accuracy of the figures.  This delayed 
the Monetary Policy Committee\'s decision on the Bank of 
Ghana\'s prime rate.  The February figure was finally 
accepted, but it was expected to be a one-time increase and 
thought to be the result of \"turbulent data\" captured during 
the confusion over transport fares after the petroleum 
product price increase in January 2003.  As a result of this 
the MPC cautiously increased the prime rate from 25.5 
percent to 27.5 percent in March. 
 
4.  Contrary to government expectations, inflation has gone 
up again in March 2003.  Economists believe that inflation 
impulses still persist which makes the disinflation process 
hard to achieve.  The rationalization of petroleum products 
and utilities prices and the transmission lag of money 
supply growth of 50 percent in 2002 are still exerting some 
pressures.   The upward revision of the prime rate has been 
followed by an increase in the lending rates, which may lead 
to some cost-push effects. 
 
5.  To most analysts, the GoG/IMF inflation target of 9 
percent at the end of 2003 is unachievable.   There are 
expectations that it may slow down in the second half of the 
year but may still remain between 15-20 percent.  It will, 
however, require a great deal of fiscal and monetary 
tightness in order to get there.

SUBJECT: VALCO SHUTS DOWN LAST POTLINE 
 
1. David Thomas, the Managing Director of Volta Aluminum 
Company Limited (VALCO), contacted Econoff to announce VALCO 
will voluntarily curtail its one operating potline effective 
May 5. The company took the decision, according to Thomas, in 
light of the current 237.80 foot level of Volta Lake. Given 
this level, said Thomas, the Volta River Authority (VRA), 
which provides hydropower from Akosombo Dam to VALCO, would 
probably have to curtail VALCO\'s power supplies in the coming 
weeks, using force majeure. According to Thomas, the 
curtailment by VALCO will provide the VRA with some 
flexibility in powering the rest of the electrical grid. 
Under its contract, according to Thomas, VALCO will reserve 
the right to obtain power later in the year when the lake has 
somewhat recovered. VALCO sees minimal impact on its current 
workforce and hopes to resume operations later this year. 
VALCO hopes this gesture is seen as a good faith effort to 
assist Ghana during this power crisis.

REF: 2003 STATE 263456 
 
1.  Per reftel request, Post provides the following 
information on the legal and regulatory environment covering 
agricultural biotechnology in Ghana.  The Government of Ghana 
is still developing its biotech policies, so Post will 
provide regular updates, as appropriate. 
 
2.  Ghana currently has no national laws regulating the 
approval, production, importation, and labeling of products 
that may contain the products of agricultural biotechnology. 
However, since the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety became 
legally binding on Ghana, Ghana has drafted a Biosafety 
Guideline and will likely complete a National Biosafety 
Framework by mid 2004. 
 
3.  Under the draft Biosafety Guideline, all GMOs entering 
Ghana will require a permit. The Guideline will govern only 
contained work on biotech products, according to Mr. Alex 
Owusu-Biney, the Project Coordinator of the National 
Biosafety Committee (NBC), which was established to develop 
the National Biosafety Framework. The Guideline has not been 
applied to consumer ready foods.  For biotech feed and seeds, 
either imported or produced in Ghana, permits will be 
required from the Ministry of Environment and Science.  Under 
existing import laws, the Plant Protection and Regulatory 
Services Department (PPRSD) issues phytosanitary permits for 
seeds including grains such as rice and wheat.  The Animal 
Production Department (ARD) issues permits for feed imported 
into Ghana.  Under existing procedures, these two 
institutions refer any feed or seed products thought to 
contain agricultural biotechnology to the Biotechnology and 
Nuclear Agricultural Institute (BNARI) through the NBC for 
risk assessment.  The Guideline does not apply to consumer 
ready foods.  The Food and Drugs Board (FDB), which registers 
all food products imported into Ghana, expects to enforce 
labeling requirements on biotech foods when a law is passed 
governing agricultural biotechnology. 
 
4.  A permit on biotechnology products can also be obtained 
directly through: 
 
The Minister 
Ministry of Environment and Science 
P.O. Box 232 
Accra, Ghana 
Tel:  (233) (21) 666049 
Fax:  (233) (21) 666828 
 
The application should include a signed letter and an 
accompanying dossier on the product.  The dossier should 
contain contact information of the requester and technical 
information describing the GMO, the type of application, type 
of receiving environment, data on environmental impacts, food 
safety and health impacts on receiving environment. The 
information should be sufficient to begin risk assessment. 
 
5.  Ghana,s proposed National Biosafety Framework, which is 
being funded by UNEP/GEF and will be implemented by the 
National Biosafety Committee, has four main components: a 
legislative system or a National Biosafety Law providing 
guidelines and regulations; an administrative system to 
handle permits; a decision making system including risk 
assessment and risk management procedures; and a system for 
information sharing and public participation.  Issues such as 
the use of labels on biotech products, testing of shipped 
products, penalties, and traceability systems are still under 
discussion.  It is likely that labels and special 
documentation will be required for all biotech products.

CORRUPTION/TRANSPARENCY DECLARATION: IDENTIFICATION OF 
PILOT COUNTRIES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 2003 345287 
 
1. Summary. Anti-corruption and transparency are 
critical issues in Ghana.  While the G-8 program could 
add value to on-going anti-corruption and transparency 
initiatives in Ghana, and while we think Ghana could 
ultimately participate successfully, the timing is not 
good for including Ghana as one of the pilot countries. 
2004 is an election year and the Government of Ghana 
(GoG) is heavily engaged in advancing the Ghana Poverty 
Reduction Strategy (GPRS) and developing and 
implementing its various sector strategies. It is 
unlikely the GoG could make the necessary commitments 
to ensure it would serve as a successful pilot partner. 
We are eager to learn more about the program and would 
encourage Ghana to participate in the program once it 
gets underway. We have consulted with our in-country UK 
counterparts, including the Deputy High Commissioner 
and DFID.  They support this conclusion. End Summary. 
 
2.  Post would probably have no difficulties in getting 
the GoG to sign onto such a pilot program. However, 
implementing such an initiative will face a number of 
hurdles. For one, it may be difficult to have the GoG 
assign personnel with the time and skills to engage on 
this to ensure that all of the GoG\'s responsibilities 
are implemented. Moreover, there will likely be 
internal resistance within the civil service to 
following through on such an initiative. In the case of 
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
(EITI), DFID indicates that the GoG has made a number 
of promises, but the government institutions are 
lagging behind in the implementation. Furthermore, DFID 
fears that if Ghana is selected as a pilot country that 
the efforts under the G-8 anti-corruption and 
transparency initiative would duplicate efforts already 
underway in their current EITI project in Ghana. 
 
3. Since 2004 is an election year, the GoG would be 
more than happy to showcase any transparency efforts 
that put them in a positive light but will be less than 
eager to showcase efforts that reflect badly on them. 
The GOG would likely put a positive spin on its 
participation and use the efforts to win political 
favor. The challenge would be to ensure that there is 
real substance behind any actions the GoG is pushed to 
take. 
 
4. Current and ongoing anti-corruption and transparency 
activities include the following: 
      World Bank and DFID program in Public Financial 
     Management; 
    Country Financial and Accountability Assessment in 
2001; 
    World Bank (supported by DFID) program on 
procurement reform; 
    World Bank governance and anti-corruption program; 
    US Treasury Tax Administration Program; 
      USAID funded wide area network and case management 
     system for the Commission on Human Rights and Justice 
     (CHRAJ); 
      USAID program to increase capacity of civil 
     society organizations to work with local government to 
     improve government accountability and responsiveness to 
     citizens, through public hearings on programs, budgets, 
     corruption, and tendering; 
    DFID governance and anti-corruption program; 
    DFID EITI project; 
    DFID public financial management and reform 
program; 
    DFID civil service reform program; 
    GTZ good governance program; 
    Netherlands training for national audit offices; 
and 
    Netherlands anti-corruption capacity building for 
municipalities. 
 
cipalities. 
 
5. It is critical that any anti-corruption initiative 
in Ghana add value to existing initiatives, including 
World Bank support to the implementation of the Public 
Procurement Act and the Country Procurement Assessment 
Review (CPAR) Action Plan and the Ministry of Finance 
and Economic Planning\'s (MoFEP) Short Term Action Plan. 
Furthermore, there are a range of issues that need to 
be addressed to improve the overall anti-corruption and 
transparency environment. These include the following: 
      Developing equitable and meaningful wage policies; 
      Passing comprehensive anti corruption legislation 
     - encompassing a reasonably comprehensive and 
     unambiguous definition of bribery and corruption, 
     credible access to information and whistle-blower 
     encouragement and protection laws, and clear guidelines 
     on conflict of interest; 
    Strengthening the independence and capacity of 
constitutional and statutory oversight bodies; 
    Promulgating and enforcing credible asset 
set 
declaration regulations, especially ones that conform 
to international best practices (such as easy 
verifiability and easy monitoring); and 
      Initiating public service reforms with a view to 
     redressing the culture of secrecy, promulgating a 
     credible wage policy. 
 
6.  While the G-8 initiative appears to be a very 
interesting program, the timing is unfavorable for 
including Ghana as a pilot country.  However, we are 
anxious to know more about the program and would very 
much like Ghana to participate once it gets underway. 
If Ghana is selected for either the pilot or the 
mainstream program, it will be critical to have 
sufficient funds to provide for technical assistance, 
training and management oversight.  USAID/Ghana has no 
resources to draw upon for such a program.  Additional 
funds will be required to provide the appropriate 
program inputs and oversight.

Introduction and Welcome 
------------------------ 
 
1.  Your visit to Ghana provides an opportunity to encourage 
further momentum to Ghana\'s efforts to build capacity to 
address basic health concerns on infant, child and maternal 
mortality and morbidity, and help prevent HIV/AIDS 
transmission and mitigate its impact on Ghana\'s population. 
Ghana\'s childhood immunization coverage has been increasing 
steadily and is currently more than 80 percent. It is 
supported by GOG commitment to vaccine availability and 
program sustainability. Ghana is committed to the 2000 
African Heads of State Abuja Conference goals for malarial 
prevention, including effective treatment of uncomplicated 
cases, intermittent presumptive treatment for pregnant women 
and the promotion and use of insecticide-treated bed nets. 
Ghana\'s HIV/AIDS infection rate, at approximately 3.4 
percent, is well below the critical 5 percent threshold and 
AIDS prevention campaigns, with broad-based support across 
sectors, are widely prevalent. The Ghana AIDS Commission, 
established in 2000 under the leadership of the President, is 
the coordinating body for all HIV/AIDS-related activities in 
Ghana and oversees an expanded response to the epidemic. End 
Introduction. 
 
---------------------- 
USG Interests in Ghana 
---------------------- 
 
2.  U.S. interests center on support for Ghana\'s ten-year-old 
democracy and promotion of open markets.  The long-term 
success of Ghana\'s constitutional democracy is not 
guaranteed.  Government institutions are still evolving, and 
economic challenges, left unresolved, could erode popular 
support for democracy.  A top Mission priority is to 
encourage respect for rule of law, individual rights and 
accessible, open, corruption-free civic institutions.  This 
effort goes hand-in-hand with our support for economic policy 
reform and pursuit of market-based growth, primary education, 
and combating HIV/AIDS.  The events of September 11 have led 
to increased emphasis on anti-terrorism, particularly in 
successfully lobbying the Ghanaian Government on 
anti-terrorism conventions and suggesting improvements to 
Ghana\'s financial systems. 
 
---------------------- 
Development Assistance 
---------------------- 
 
3. Ghana is one of USAID\'s largest programs in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, receiving approximately USD 55 million in grant 
assistance and food aid per year.  USAID works in the 
education, health/population and HIV/AIDS, environment, trade 
and investment, and democracy/governance sectors.  The trade 
and investment program focuses on macroeconomic and trade 
policy reform, and technical assistance to business groups 
and individual entrepreneurs. USAID has also provided 
technical assistance to the GOG in its efforts to conclude an 
agreement for the West African Gas Pipeline and to establish 
a West African Power Pool.  In February 2000, Ghana launched 
a USAID-funded \"Stop AIDS, Love Life\" campaign to help slow 
the rate of infection. 
 
4.  September 2003 marked the Peace Corps\' 42nd anniversary 
in Ghana, the first country in the world to receive Peace 
Corps volunteers.  Ghana currently hosts some 130 volunteers 
who are working as teachers, agro-foresters, small business 
and water/sanitation advisers, and youth development 
volunteers.  The USG-funded African Development Foundation 
supports grassroots development and small-scale 
community-based enterprises, including micro-financing 
projects.  Ghana also participates in the Leland (computer 
and internet connectivity) and Education for Democracy and 
Development (EDDI) initiatives through USAID.  Accra was 
recently the venue for Peace Corps\' annual Africa Region 
Country Directors Conference.  Peace Corps Director Gaddi 
Vasquez visited Ghana, met with the Vice President and 
addressed the conference. 
 
5.  Donor coordination is excellent in Ghana, with active 
coordination groups in 14 sectors including health, 
education, and governance/democracy.  Assistance to Ghana in 
forms of grants and concessional loans from over 20 
multilateral and bilateral donors was approximately USD 1 
billion in 2002.  The United States ranks third among 
bilateral donors and contributes approximately 6 percent of 
that total.  Japan is the largest bilateral donor with 
programs in education, health, and agriculture, and Great 
Britain is second with programs in public administration, 
health, education, rural infrastructure, and agriculture. 
Other major donors to Ghana include the World Bank 
(infrastructure, education, and health), United Nations 
agencies, the European Union, Denmark, the Netherlands, 
Germany, France, Canada, Italy, and Spain.  Ghana signed a 
new IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program 
in May 2003.  Ghana\'s performance under the previous PRGF was 
problematic, but it met all its targets during the September 
2003 review of the new program. 
 
--------------- 
Health Overview 
--------------- 
 
6. In the health sector, Ghana has achieved significant 
results in reducing under-five mortality and total fertility 
rates and has come a long way in addressing the basic health 
needs of its population. USAID/Ghana\'s Health program, at 
approximately USD 17 million per year, focuses on USAID 
priority areas in child survival, reproductive health 
including family planning, and HIV/AIDS, and seeks to support 
and maintain the positive trends of recent years. USAID,s 
program lends leadership in the areas of community health 
service provision and technical assistance to increase 
coverage and quality of services in all areas. The program 
promotes behavior changes and the adoption of positive health 
practices, social marketing and other private sector 
approaches. USAID also has significant comparative advantages 
in the HIV/AIDS care and support area, including the 
introduction of anti-retrovirals, home-based and orphan care, 
establishing voluntary counseling and testing centers, and 
prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Additional areas 
of USAID,s leadership are in highly technical interventions 
such as logistics management, surveillance and program 
monitoring, evaluation and research, including operations 
research, and in mutual health organization/health insurance 
development. USAID,s approach is to maintain and expand 
positive trends in health status building on the SWAP (sector 
wide approach), add limited new interventions based on 
lessons-learned and research, and focus activities 
geographically and programmatically to maximize impact and 
better complement other donor programs. 
 
7. Child Health: In child health, USAID aims to improve 
immunization coverage, use of insecticide treated bed nets, 
care of the sick child, and nutrition. Working with the 
Ministry of Health, UNICEF and WHO, USAID supports increased 
availability of immunization services through outreach and 
expanded service. USAID also supports efforts to promote 
purchase and re-treatment of bed nets from commercial 
suppliers. USAID has supported the development of improved 
guidelines for integrated case management of childhood 
illness, training to disseminate these guidelines and 
activities focused on the household and community to improve 
care of children before they reach health facilities, as well 
as the establishment of an infectious disease surveillance 
capability in the north, currently being expanded to other 
regions. With its partners, USAID is advocating for increased 
attention to the nutritional problems. USAID is supporting 
community-based groups to educate caretakers and the Ministry 
of Health to improve national guidelines and health worker 
training and nutrition. 
 
8. Reproductive Health/Family Planning: Recognized as the 
primary donor in this field, USAID is credited with making 
substantial contributions to the success of national family 
planning efforts in Ghana. USAID,s programs offer technical 
assistance and support for: policy development; improved 
service delivery; information campaigns; training and 
contraceptive commodities. Public awareness of family 
planning is high, and contraceptive use is increasing 
slightly.  USAID,s program works to decrease the abortion 
rate by promoting family planning for married couples, 
educating girls and boys on abstinence and delayed sexual 
initiation, and advocating faithfulness between married 
partners (school-based curricula, Life Choices media 
campaigns and the Church\'s Counseling curriculum are 
examples). The Ghana Health Service and Ministry of Health 
work toward improving health care access, equity and quality 
through several initiatives, including the Community-based 
Health Planning and Services Initiative (CHPS).  USAID 
supports the Ministry in CHPS and technical assistance, 
training and minor equipment for safe deliveries, the 
development of a self-paced safe motherhood curriculum, and 
the review of safe motherhood protocols. The result of all 
our support will be improved provider competency for 
antenatal, delivery and post-natal care and improved access 
to services in the communities. 
 
9. HIV/AIDS/STD Prevention and Impact Mitigation: USAID,s 
strategy to reduce the rate of HIV transmission consists of 
behavior change directed particularly at high risk groups and 
aims at sensitizing audiences to risk perception and the need 
for preventative behaviors. The program also supports 
training of health workers and strengthening laboratory 
capabilities and surveillance. Increasing demands on care and 
support services also mean that USAID,s program has expanded 
in this direction to provide technical assistance and 
strategic support to the establishment of comprehensive 
prevention, care and treatment services to infected 
individuals and their families in the hardest hit areas in 
Ghana. Interventions address prophylaxis and treatment of 
opportunistic infections, home-based care, clinical 
management of HIV-related conditions, voluntary counseling 
and testing, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of 
HIV, prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted 
infections, provision of anti-retroviral therapy and programs 
to serve orphans and vulnerable children. 
 
---------------------------- 
Internal Political Situation 
---------------------------- 
 
10.  President Kufuor took office January 7, 2001, after 
defeating former Vice President John Atta Mills in a free and 
fair election.  His party controls 103 of the 200 seats in 
Parliament.  The National Democratic Congress (NDC) has 89 
seats, and smaller parties and independents hold the 
remaining eight.  Kufuor promised an inclusive government and 
has delivered:  his Vice President Alhaji Aliu Mahama is a 
northern Muslim, and ministers and other appointees come from 
all ten regions of Ghana.  The tone and volume of political 
discourse between the NPP government and the NDC opposition, 
always a vigorous debate, will likely harden as the December 
2004 Presidential and Parliamentary election season unfolds. 
 
11.  The Kufuor government frequently proclaims its 
dedication to the rule of law and to constitutional 
government.  It repealed colonial-era criminal libel laws, 
dropped a number of libel suits against journalists, 
initiated abolition of sometimes abusive community tribunals, 
establish a juvenile justice system, and generally takes a 
more balanced attitude toward individual freedoms and 
personal expression.  The President signed a new labor bill 
into law in October, bringing its law into conformity with 
ILO conventions. 
 
------------------- 
Economics and Trade 
------------------- 
 
12.  In 2000, the Kufuor Government inherited a distressed 
economy: high levels of debt, accelerating inflation, 
interest rates above 50 percent, a plummeting currency (the 
\"cedi\"), all exacerbated by declining world cocoa and gold 
prices (the main foreign exchange earners), and rising crude 
oil prices (heavily subsidized on the local market).  The 
government moved to restore macroeconomic stability, and 
promised a new Golden Age of Business.  It imposed 
badly-needed fuel, water and energy price hikes, and reined 
in spending by deferring some infrastructure projects and 
also by accumulating arrears to creditors.  The GOG\'s moves 
were in good measure successful; the 12-month inflation rate, 
after spiking to 30 percent after increasing fuel prices in 
February 2003, is rapidly declining.  Interest rates were 
reduced to approximately 24 percent, and the cedi has 
stabilized.  The decision  to seek debt relief under the 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program was a 
controversial move, but afforded Ghana roughly USD 250 
million in debt relief in 2002. 
 
13.  The government still has much to do to create its Golden 
Age of Business.  While voicing support for divestiture, the 
government has yet to sell its big assets - the utilities, 
the airline, and telecommunications.  Ghana continues to rely 
on multilateral and bilateral donors to provide over one 
third of its total revenue.  Looming revenue constraints, 
spending pressures, high interest rates, and major 
inefficiencies in agriculture continue to limit growth and 
hamper poverty reduction.  A number of nettlesome commercial 
disputes involving U.S. companies raise questions about the 
long-term investment climate.  While each dispute has its 
unique characteristics, most involve a sustained GOG failure 
to pay creditors in a timely fashion or a failure to abide by 
contractual obligations. 
 
14.  Despite these problems, the United States and Ghana 
experience a relatively dynamic trade relationship.  Ghana 
ranks fifth among African markets for U.S. goods (after South 
Africa, Kenya, Angola, and Nigeria).  In 2002 U.S. exports 
rounded to USD 200 million, principally heavy equipment and 
machinery, building materials, and food.  Ghanaian exports to 
the U.S. in 2002 amounted to some USD 116 million, primarily 
cocoa, gold and timber.  Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), the 
Star-Kist tuna plant owned by Heinz, and the CMS Energy 
thermal power plant are the largest U.S. investments in 
Ghana.  Ghana has taken steps to take advantage of the Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA); it was the first country 
in Africa to receive certification for AGOA apparel benefits. 
 Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans formally opened a 
Department of Commerce office in Accra in November 2002. 
 
---------- 
Corruption 
---------- 
 
15.  The Kufuor government claims a \"zero tolerance\" policy 
for corruption and has pursued some high-profile 
prosecutions, including its Minister of Youth and Sports and 
several former high-level government officials.  In July 
2003, the President established an Office of Accountability 
within his office to ensure government appointees and public 
servants abide by the code of ethics for government 
employees.  It is still unclear, however, if this initiative 
is sufficient for the government to pursue corruption 
effectively against its own senior officials, and if it will 
succeed against working-level corruption pervasive in Ghana\'s 
public sector. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Peacekeeping/Military Cooperation 
--------------------------------- 
 
16.  Ghana\'s military establishment is characterized by its 
allegiance to elected civilian leadership, a rich 
peacekeeping tradition and a close relationship with the 
United States.  Since 1960, 80,000 Ghanaian soldiers and 
police have participated in peacekeeping missions, including 
those who currently serve in the sub-region as well as 
Lebanon and the Congo.  The Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) has 
received peacekeeping training under ACOTA, (the USG\'s Africa 
Contingency Operations, Training and Assistance), and 
Operation Focus Relief.  Many of Ghana\'s top brass have 
benefited from the USG\'s International Military Education and 
Training program, (including all Ghanaian military leaders in 
the recent ECOWAS Liberian Peacekeeping Operation 
deployment), while the Navy received three ships from the 
U.S. Excess Defense Article program.  In addition, DOD/EUCOM 
humanitarian assistance programs have constructed and 
equipped a new clinic in the Western Region, rebuilt a 
destroyed dam in the Upper West Region, and assisted 
small-scale community-based self-help projects throughout the 
country, including an HIV/AIDS hospice in Tamale.  A recent 
four day Naval West African Training Cruise Medical Outreach 
program in the Takoradi area treated over 1,000 patients a 
day in eight villages. 
 
----------------- 
Counter-Terrorism 
----------------- 
 
17. The GOG condemned the September 11 attacks, publicly and 
privately, and expressed its sympathy, again publicly and 
privately, for the victims of the attacks.  Local security 
forces have offered enhanced cooperation, both in terms of 
security of Mission personnel and in exchange of information. 
 The Government in December 2001 signed the Convention on 
Suppression of Terrorist Financing, and has indicated its 
willingness to exercise greater oversight of suspicious 
transactions.  The Bank of Ghana drafted anti-money 
laundering legislation, which is currently waiting 
Parliamentary approval.  The Ministry of Justice is amending 
local laws to bring them into conformity with this and other 
anti-terror conventions.  In July 2002, the GOG ratified the 
five remaining conventions to which it was not yet a party, 
and now subscribes to all 12 conventions.

SUBJECT: HHS DEPUTY SECRETARY ALLEN\'S JANUARY 18-21 GHANA 
TRIP 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Deputy 
Secretary Claude Allen traveled to Ghana January 18-21, 
 
SIPDIS 
accompanying the President and Board members of the Africa 
Development Foundation (ADF).  The purpose of the trip was to 
review ADF projects in Ghana and meet with representatives of 
health and faith-based NGOs to discuss HIV/AIDS and other 
health-related issues.  The HHS/ADF group and Ambassador met 
January 21 with President Kufuor, during which they 
emphasized that the Government of Ghana (GoG) needs to 
improve the investment climate if it expects to compete for 
funding from the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA).  They 
also discussed ways to increase USG/GoG cooperation in the 
health field.  End Summary. 
 
HHS and ADF Visit to Ghana 
-------------------------- 
2. HHS Deputy Secretary (D/S) Claude Allen, ADF President 
Nathaniel Fields, and ADF Board Members Ernest Green, Ephraim 
Batameuze and William Ford, visited Ghana January 18-21, 
2004, to review ongoing and potential ADF projects in Ghana. 
D/S Allen also used the visit to discuss health issues, 
particularly HIV/AIDS, meeting with Ghana\'s Deputy Minister 
of Health, Ghana\'s Country Coordinating Mechanism of the 
Global Fund, and representatives of health and faith-based 
organizations.  The HHS/ADF delegation and Ambassador Yates 
met with President Kufuor on January 21 to discuss ADF,s 
activities in Ghana. 
 
Meeting with President Kufuor 
----------------------------- 
3. On January 21, D/S Allen met with President Kufuor and 
ministers (Private Sector Development Minister Bartels, 
Energy Minister Nduom, Foreign Minister Akufo-Addo, Finance 
Minister Osafo-Maafo, Deputy Health Minister Moses Dani-Bah). 
 Ambassador Yates, ADF President Fields and the ADF members 
also attended.  Discussions centered on HIV AIDS programs and 
Ghana\'s prospects for economic development.  Allen praised 
Ghana\'s commitment on fighting HIV/AIDS, and explored in some 
depth the community philanthropy program of the ADF. 
President Kufuor responded by thanking the USG for its help 
on HIV/AIDS, and welcoming ADF\'s continuing involvement in 
Ghana.  He asked for more USG assistance for Ghana\'s health 
care sector and to address Ghana\'s professional brain drain. 
\"We are a poor country,\" he said, and asked that ADF\'s 
\"one-for-one\" matching funds requirements be relaxed to a 
\"two-to-one\" ratio.  Fields said their organization would 
have 40-50 projects open in Ghana in the coming years, and 
had high praise for Ghana\'s efforts in working with ADF. 
 
4. D/S Allen encouraged Kufuor to contact Senator Bill Frist, 
who has made frequent trips to Africa offering medical 
services, and ask him to assist Ghana,s health care system. 
Allen would also contact the Senator\'s office as well. Allen 
also pledged that HHS would \"take a look\" at Ghana\'s brain 
drain, and offer programmatic support.  He praised Ghana\'s 
good work on Polio eradication, and said the USG stood ready 
to assist Ghana on many health care concerns.  Allen closed 
by noting Ghana\'s potential for qualifying for MCA funds, and 
its need to improve its performance on various criteria.  In 
particular he focused on Ghana\'s business climate, saying 
Ghana needed to do more, and that with \"diligence and hard 
work,\" Ghana could make itself more open to outside business, 
and better qualified for MCA funding. 
 
Media Coverage 
-------------- 
5. D/S Allen and ADF\'s visit enjoyed wide press coverage, 
both in state-owned and private media.  Most reporting 
focused on ADF\'s contributions to Ghana.  President Kufuor 
even mentioned these when listing Ghana\'s 2003 successes in 
his January 22 State of the Nation speech.  Allen\'s praise 
for Ghana\'s democratic achievement, low HIV/AIDS infection 
rate, and efforts to eradicate polio during his meeting with 
President Kufuor also received extensive media attention. 
Several private papers did note that Ghana is not a recipient 
of the USG\'s 2002 USD 15 billion pledge to fight HIV/AIDS 
tuberculosis and malaria, even though this is not new 
information in Ghana.  Allen also gave a lengthy interview 
with the Daily Graphic\'s Health Editor, where he noted 
possible future U.S.-Ghana links in the area of health. 
 
Meeting with Ministry of Health (MOH) 
------------------------------------- 
6. During a January 19 meeting with Deputy Minister of Health 
Moses Dani-Bah, D/S Allen noted the strong collaboration 
between the two countries, evidenced by significant numbers 
of Ghanaians, including health personnel, residing in the 
U.S.  Dani-Bah acknowledged the benefits accorded to Ghana 
through remittances, as well as the development of health 
care skills through higher education in the U.S. 
Nevertheless, he requested USG assistance with stemming the 
\"brain drain\" of health-industry workers by providing or 
funding capacity training for health personnel and trainers. 
Allen noted Ghana,s recent passage of health insurance 
legislation, to which he drew similarities to recent U.S. 
reform on Medicare, and noted the importance of the role of 
the private sector in contributing to objectives and ensuring 
that public funds are use efficiently and appropriately. 
Dani-Bah cited geographic and financial access to health 
services/care as its biggest concern.  He also asserted that 
while HIV/AIDS prevalence in Ghana is relatively low, the GOG 
would remain vigilant. 
 
Meeting with Global Fund Representatives 
---------------------------------------- 
7. D/S Allen me with local members of the Global Fund Country 
Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) to discuss programs in Ghana and 
gauge how the process is working.  CCM members explained that 
while the GoG initially took the lead on establishing the CCM 
and pushing forward Global Fund activities, the CCM is now 
encouraging greater private sector participation.  Of the 44 
current CCM members, only eight represent GoG entities, 
although the GOG\'s Ghana Health Service is leading the 
process.  USAID\'s representative on the CCM commented that 
Ghana is one of the countries where the CCM process is 
working well.  In fact, many of the problems the CCM-Ghana 
has experienced were due to slow disbursements and changing 
guidelines from Geneva.  The CCM just received funding for 
its malaria programs, and is in the process of completing 
Ghana\'s malaria drug policy.  They set up two HIV/AIDS 
treatment centers and anti-retroviral drugs just arrived. 
They are also implementing a TB program, which involves the 
private sector.  One weak area of the local process is that 
NGOs do not coordinate well, and CCM reps wondered if Global 
Fund money could be used to improve NGO cooperation.  Allen 
responded that capacity-building funds may be available, and 
he would look into it upon his return to Washington. 
 
Lunch with Health and Faith-Based Organizations 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
8. D/S Allen lunched January 19 with representatives of MOH, 
Ghana Health Service, faith-based organizations (Papal 
Nuncio, Christian Council, CRS), technical advisors (WHO 
Country Rep, Ghana AIDS Commission), and USAID.  The 
discussion focused on HIV/AIDS, with participants explaining 
that they fight the stigma of AIDS in Ghana through 
dissemination of information, encouraging public discussions 
of HIV/AIDS, and making drugs and support services widely 
available.  The discussion also touched on social change 
interventions targeting cultural practices, and the &a, b, 
c8 approach (\"abstinence, be faithful, condom use\"). 
 
9. The role of faith-based organizations in addressing 
individual practices is important, and participants noted 
that this is a difficult area given deep cultural traditions 
that transcend religious principles.  Much has been learned 
from Africa\'s experience in combating HIV/AIDS to date, 
particularly the significant contribution of abstinence and 
being faithful, alongside appropriate condom use.  HIV/AIDS 
interventions largely target women\'s empowerment, but men are 
a major contributor if not driver of the epidemic.  More 
needs to be done to instill male responsibility, and there is 
an important role for prevention education among the youth to 
begin instilling a change in behavior.  All agreed that more 
work is need to strengthen institutional capabilities of 
on-the-ground organizations working with the infected (or 
affected). 
 
10. Ghanaian representatives asked what insights U.S. 
institutions could provide on Buruli ulcer, an infectious 
disease involving the skin, which has reached epidemic levels 
in Ghana.  D/S Allen indicated he would pursue this with NIH. 
 
January 19 HIV/AIDS Site Visits 
------------------------------- 
11. D/S Allen traveled to the Coca-Cola (CC) bottling plant 
in Accra to learn about its workplace HIV/AIDS policy.  CC 
views HIV/AIDS as a business issue, affecting consumers and 
employees, and feels its corporate responsibility is to enact 
workplace policies to halt the spread and effects of the 
virus and ensure a healthy and safe work environment for 
maximum productivity.  CC,s strategy involves awareness 
programs, using employee training courses, promotions and 
peer educators.  CC also runs an on-site clinic and pays all 
but 10 percent of HIV treatments. D/S Allen also traveled 
just outside Accra to see a site where Living Water 
International (LWI), a U.S. faith-based NGO, provides safe 
drinking water to a facility for disabled children and 
adults, many with cerebral palsy.  LWI is drilling boreholes 
with OPIC-financed equipment. 
 
ADF Programs in Ghana 
--------------------- 
12. ADF is supporting 17 projects in Ghana in its effort to 
support grass-roots economic development to help alleviate 
poverty.  It recently designed and funded four new projects: 
tomato processing and canning, maize grits production, 
organic citrus peel and juice processing, and bamboo 
furniture manufacturing.  ADF officials and Ambassador Yates 
participated on January 20 in a high profile, public signing 
ceremony for the tomato processing company.  Finance Minister 
Osafo-Maafo, Energy Minister Nduom, and Private Sector 
Development Minister Bartels participated for the GoG 
(Comment:  Such high-level engagement is unusual, and is a 
sign of GoG support for ADF\'s work in Ghana.  End Comment). 
ADF President emphasized that ADF is committed to increasing 
its funded-projects in Ghana over the next ten years, with a 
maximum grant support of approximately USD 20 million. 
Including the four recent projects, ADF hopes to invest in 
eight to ten new projects in Ghana by summer 2004. 
 
ADF Focus on HIV/AIDS 
--------------------- 
13. On January 21 D/S Allen and ADF reps visited a community 
in Accra where the ADF-funded group YPEP (Youngsters Peer 
Education Project) promotes adolescent reproductive health 
and development through peer education and youth-friendly 
integrated services.  YPEP is a youth AIDS education project 
where educators provide information on health issues and 
HIV/AIDS.  The goal is to promote responsible sexual behavior 
and control the incidence and spread of HIV among youths. 
 
Comment 
------- 
14. With the extensive media coverage of the HHS/ADF visit, 
especially during D/S Allen\'s meeting with President Kufuor, 
the trip served to raise awareness in Ghana of health issues, 
specifically those related to HIV/AIDS, and highlighted USG 
efforts to assist Ghana in the health sector.  The GoG showed 
itself an enthusiastic partner in the ADF programs in Ghana, 
and appears eager to support efforts to increase ADF 
investment into the country.  Also useful was D/S Allen\'s 
message to President Kufuor that Ghana needs to move past the 
rhetoric of \"The Golden Age of Business\" and take concrete 
steps to improve its investment climate if it is to compete 
for MCA funds and attract greater foreign investment.  End

1. (C) Per reftel instructions, Ambassador Yates convened a 
CTAG meeting on February 2 in Accra.  In attendance on the 
donor side were the G-8 ambassadors or charge d\'affaires in 
Accra, plus the EU and Swiss Ambassadors (the Spanish 
Ambassador was invited but out of country).  National 
Security Coordinator Francis Poku attended for the GOG.  The 
agenda was set in two parts: G-8-plus participants\' 
assessment of the threat and host country\'s needs, and then 
the host country response. 
 
2.  (C)  In the assembled chiefs of mission discussion (in 
advance of Poku\'s arrival), the terrorist threat in Ghana was 
generally assessed as relatively low, with no concrete threat 
emanating from inside Ghana at this time.  However, given 
Ghana\'s open society and benign security forces, the 
potential for terrorists attempting to use Ghana as a base in 
the future could not be discounted.  Particularly with 
Ghana\'s relatively good regional airlinks, indigenous Muslim 
population with some links to outside extremist groups, the 
presence of many major Islamic NGOs, and porous borders, 
watchfulness was called for.  The presence of Muslim clerics 
from Gulf states, Pakistan and other locales pursuing 
fundamentalist agendas in Ghana was also a cause for concern. 
 
 
3.  (C)  Francis Poku briefly gave a similar assessment of 
the situation in Ghana, noting that security forces monitor 
local and expatriate groups throughout the country, and that 
Ghana \"could be a weak link\" regionally if it did not conduct 
\"proper data collection and analysis.\"  Poku specifically 
noted poor contingency planning regionally, with management 
of emergencies being particularly wanting on the Ghanaian 
side.  He also spoke of the difficulties with border control. 
 Poku generally spoke of Ghana\'s need for data analysis 
infrastructure, enhanced training, and added resources to 
monitor events in the region.  He said that the various 
security services were collating their needs, and he would be 
prepared to discuss them at the next CTAG meeting.  Poku 
mentioned that, given the very high priority given to proper 
security for the presidential and parliamentary elections in 
December, he would not have quite the level of resources to 
devote to anti-terrorist activities as he might wish.  \"We 
must use our limited resources appropriately.\" 
 
4.  (C)  Ambassador Yates offered a listing of USG 
contributions to law enforcement in Ghana generally, and 
overt anti-terror needs specifically, including the Pisces 
arrival and departure data system for all border posts in 
Ghana.  She encouraged the assembled chiefs of missions to 
present their own listing of programs and assistance at the 
next CTAG meeting, to compare with the GOG resource 
requirements now being compiled. 
 
5.  (C) The Italian Ambassador provided a copy of a 
confidential document which indicated the following: 
 
SIPDIS 
 
Threat Assessment: 
--Ghana appears to become a transit point for drugs and arms 
trafficking and presence of an active Muslim community 
(Lebanese and Islamic NGOs supported by Iran and Saudi Arabia) 
--Will to cooperate: Ghana has ratified the 12 UN Conventions 
on terrorism 
 
Needs Assessment: 
--A special law on financial means for counter-terrorism 
actions under discussions 
--Introduction of a new identity card system to fight against 
forged documents 
 
Ongoing Assistance: 
Airport Security:  USA, Japan 
Immigration: UK 
Transnational Crime: Italy, France 
Customs Assistance: Japan 
Central Bank/Finance Ministry:  USA 
 
6. (C) The Italian Embassy is one of the few G-8 members in 
Ghana which has an intelligence operation.  The Italian 
Ambassador urged that a mosque and newspaper associated with 
it, the Searchlight, be monitored for any growth of 
fundamentalist or extremist trends.

SUBJECT: ELECTIONS V: TO BE OR NOT TO BE - SMALL PARTIES 
AND THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
 
 
Classified By: Polchief Richard Kaminski, reason 1.5 (B/D). 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  (SBU)  Ghana has two large political parties, two small 
parties, and 6 tiny mom-and-pop operations that exist mainly 
on paper.  Ghana\'s Electoral Commission (EC) hopes to cull 
moribund also-rans from the ranks of registered parties for 
the December national elections.   Some of these parties do 
play a role, however reduced, in Ghana\'s political landscape. 
 Meanwhile, the ruling party will continue to co-opt small 
party luminaries to advance its own interests. End Summary. 
 
National Character Required 
--------------------------- 
2.  (U)  Every political party in Ghana is required by the 
1992 constitution to demonstrate \"national character.\" Each 
must have branches in all 10 regions (and two-thirds of each 
region\'s districts).  National officers must be drawn from 
every region.  Membership or symbols based on \"ethnic, 
regional, religious or other sectional connotation\" are 
forbidden.  Parties must \"satisfy\" the EC that they meet 
these requirements. 
 
Some Found Wanting 
------------------ 
3.  (SBU) After carefully warning political parties for 
months on end, at regular sessions of the EC\'s Inter-Party 
Advisory Committee (IPAC), that it intended to verify names, 
addresses and physical locations of offices, the EC in 
December scoured the countryside hunting up national, 
regional and district offices and officers.  Sometimes led by 
local party officers, sometimes alone, officials poked into 
dozens of dusty towns and villages in the middle of harmattan 
season.  Fresh paint and party symbols often adorned 
structures dedicated to petty commerce: tinroof storefronts, 
small bakeries, seamstresses\' streetside counters.  Anything 
that could remotely be called an office was claimed to be so, 
with EC officials sometimes standing in cobweb-strewn, 
broken-roofed shacks while party officers baldly proclaimed 
continual use by streams of party faithful. 
 
4.  (SBU)  In January, the EC presented its findings to the 
IPAC.  To the satisfaction of the two major parties, 
President Kufuor\'s NPP and former President Rawlings\' NDC, 
both easily met the requirements.  Two small parties, the CPP 
and PNC, with one and three seats in the 200-member 
Parliament, respectively, and debatable claims to national 
reach, missed the targets but came fairly close.  Other small 
party officials sat in glum silence as the EC spelled out 
with great care, using color-coded charts and graphs, just 
how far they fell from the required constitutional standards 
of \"national character.\"   District office totals ranged from 
zero to seven (out of 110); five of the six other parties had 
no national office.  At the conclusion of the EC\'s 
presentation, several of the six parties, feeling at risk, 
tried to dispute the findings, but their efforts were 
half-hearted and unconvincing. 
 
Solution: De-register? 
---------------------- 
5. (C)  By implication, the EC\'s constitutional authority to 
register parties also encompasses the power to de-register 
parties who fail the \"national character\" test.  EC officials 
privately express their wish to clean the electoral slate of 
these nearly non-functioning parties.  Ballots (which usually 
include party symbols and candidate photographs) would be 
simplified, and the EC would spare itself the trouble of 
attempting to communicate with organizations that have barely 
a stamp and envelope to rub together.   However, in public, 
they aver that no binding decisions have yet been reached, 
and \"deliberations\" continue on their findings and 
conclusions.  Several small party officials have told us that 
they will simply re-register, under new names, if the EC 
de-registers them.  \"And what will the EC do?\" said one. 
\"Re-verify party offices?  They don\'t have the time for 
that.\"  Whether the EC would allow this is an open question. 
 
Marginal Voices Cherished? 
-------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) Despite their small-to-infinitismal size, the 
also-rans do figure in Ghanaian politics.  Local media grant 
extensive coverage to their Lilliputian doings.  Four of the 
small parties have tried for some time, unsuccessfully, to 
merge and form a unified \"Nkrumaist\" alternative on the left 
of the political spectrum (all told, these parties polled 6% 
of the vote in the 2000 presidential election).  Petty 
egotism, each party holding fiercely to its own name and 
leaders, proved the merger\'s undoing -- with the convoluted 
ups and downs dutifully documented in print and on the 
airwaves.  Any political event of any consequence, the yearly 
opening of Parliament, ministerial press briefings, lecture 
series by one of Accra\'s prominent NGOs or think-tanks, 
generally includes a sprinkling of small party leaders, who 
bask in the limelight and repeat their standard stump 
speeches, to the attentive if sometimes amused concern of the 
press and hosts. 
 
7. (C) As the small parties squabble amongst themselves, and 
make theatrically unbelievable pronouncements on their 
impeding victory next December, the ruling NPP divides and 
rules, offering senior positions to the most promising and 
talented small party leaders.  The CPP\'s sole MP, Freddie 
Blay, is the First Deputy Speaker in Parliament. Kwesi Ndoum, 
hailing like Blay from the modernist wing of the CPP, has 
held several senior ministerial positions, and is now 
Minister of Energy.  UGM presidential candidate Charles 
Wereko-Brobby headed up the Volta River Authority (he was 
dismissed for poor performance).  One of three PNC MPs, Moses 
Baah, is the Deputy Health Minister, and three independent 
MPs also hold Deputy Ministerial positions.  They serve in 
the NPP government in return for their (or their colleagues) 
votes in Parliament.  Particularly early on, when the NPP had 
only 100 votes in the 200-member Parliament, every extra vote 
counted  -- still true today with the NPP MP count at 103. 
But the NPP also keeps the small parties off balance with 
this pick and choose strategy;  co-opted small party MPs vote 
the NPP party line, while their party officers fume, and 
attempt critiques of the ruling party. 
 
Who Gets the Chop 
----------------- 
8.  (SBU) The CPP, the namesake descendent of first president 
Kwame Nkrumah\'s old pan-Africanist party, and the PNC, rooted 
in the northern half of Ghana, will likely survive any 
Electoral Commission hecatomb.  Having actually managed to 
elect someone to Parliament, and with more-or-less 
respectable district office counts (CPP, 46; PNC, 39) they 
should make the cut.  The rest, the GCPP, NRP, GCPP, DPP, 
UGM, and GDRP, are at clear risk of de-registration, with 
near-zero district office counts, at best sporadic efforts to 
hold required yearly congresses, little obvious support among 
Ghanaians, and little chance of electing anyone to office. 
 
Comment 
------- 
9.  (C) Ghana has essentially a two-party system: the 
business-oriented NPP of President John Kufuor, and former 
president Jerry Rawlings\' semi-populist NDC.  Nkrumaist 
leftists and nativist non-entities play on the margins of 
this two-party political scene.  However circumspect the EC 
proves to be in wielding its constitutional authority, 
several of the smaller parties will not be missed if 
de-registered. Others will continue to attract a loyal if 
very modest following, and cut what deals they can with the 
ruling party for office and influence.  End comment.

SUBJECT: FORMER PRESIDENT CARTER IN GHANA FEBRUARY 3-5: 
GUINEA WORM ERADICATION 
 
1. (SBU) Former President Jimmy Carter and members of the 
Carter Center visited Ghana February 3-5 to rally support to 
eradicate the last one percent of guinea worm cases 
worldwide. Carter attended a Country Team briefing and 
reception hosted by Ambassador Yates, visited guinea worm 
infested areas, met with leaders in the Northern Region and 
President of Ghana John Agyekum Kufuor. Throughout his trip, 
Carter reiterated the need for a concerted effort by the GoG 
to eradicate guinea worm. Harsh in his criticism for the lack 
of concerted effort, Carter would not relent on what he saw 
as a definitive lack of commitment by the current 
administration to effectively tackle this preventable 
disease. However, after meeting with Kufuor, Carter left with 
a sense of Ghana\'s renewed commitment to eradicate Guinea 
worm. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalyn 
Carter brought a delegation from the Carter Center to Ghana 
on February 3-5 to assess Ghana\'s failure to eradicate Guinea 
Worm, a debilitating water-borne disease that afflicts over 
35,000 people. Ghana represents about 27 percent of the 
remaining guinea worm cases. Accompanying President Carter 
from the Carter Center were Jeff Carter, Richard Blum, John 
Hardman, Dr. Ernesto Ruiz-Tiben and Nancy Konigsmark. 
President Carter and his team first met with members of the 
Country Team who briefed him on the current state of Ghana\'s 
economic, political and health affairs. At the end of the 
briefing, Carter\'s primary focus was why Ghana performs so 
poorly in eradicating Guinea worm. The Carter delegation then 
attended a reception hosted by Ambassador Yates giving key 
health officials, including the Minister of Health Dr. Kwaku 
Afriyie, the opportunity to meet with his team. The Carters 
asked that the international community to do all it could to 
ensure GoG commitment to eradicating the disease. Ghana just 
needs a little push said Mrs. Carter. The theme of the trip, 
\"Committed to Finishing the Job,\" became a mantra reiterated 
throughout the visit. 
 
3. (U) On February 4 the Director General of the WHO Dr. 
Jong-Wok Lee and Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF Dr. Kul 
Gautam joined the Carter delegation, the Minister of Health 
and Ambassador Yates on a trip to guinea worm infested areas 
in the Northern Region. Carter visited guinea worm endemic 
villages and watched a demonstration of the simple filtering 
techniques that prevent the disease.  He also met with health 
leaders to get their perspective on the current state of the 
disease. He stated that a lack of boreholes does not 
exculpate Ghana since guinea worm had been eradicated in 
areas where there were no boreholes and no easy access to 
water. He made it clear that he found the excuse unacceptable 
and that more needed to be done to mobilize resources to rid 
Ghana of the often debilitating affliction. 
 
4. (U) During his press conference with a number of 
representatives of international and local press, Carter 
stated that Ghana is not doing enough to eradicate the 
disease. He also did not accept the excuse that the reason 
behind the poor performance was due to a lack of boreholes, 
something leaders in the infested areas told him time and 
again. He noted that drier, poorer countries had managed to 
eradicate the disease and that Ghana could not wait for the 
solution in a borehole and pointed out that even a country at 
war like Sudan was reducing cases. He also noted that 
education and filtering are the key components to eradication 
efforts. 
 
5. (U) After a full day in Tamale, President and Mrs. Carter 
visited President Kufuor who welcomed and thanked them for 
the Carter Center\'s advocacy and support for Guinea worm 
eradication in Ghana. President Carter repeated comments he 
had made throughout the day about Ghana falling behind the 
majority of other countries in eradicating the disease. 
President Kufuor said he knew Ghana could and should do 
better, citing the need for better education and for more 
bore holes. Carter diplomatically responded that he 
understood the importance of deep wells for villages, but 
maintained his mantra that filtering water is all that is 
needed to eradicate the disease. Dr. Gautam told Kufuor that 
one of Ghana\'s most illustrious public servants Kofi Anan had 
made a two-minute video on Guinea worm and pointed out that 
most of the victims are children. President Carter also 
convinced Kufuor to add a 30 second spot of his own. In the 
course of the 30-minute meeting, President Carter invited 
President Kufuor to the Carter Center, and they also 
discussed election monitoring. President Carter offered the 
services of his Center to Kufuor. It was the first meeting 
between these two leaders and very positive and cordial. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: The international media attention was 
focused on Ghana\'s underperformance on Guinea worm and the 
picture was not pretty. Constituting 27 percent of the 
current Guinea worm cases worldwide in an area where poorer 
and drier countries have outperformed were an uncomfortable 
position for Ghana. After having the spotlight shined on its 
problem, Ghana seems ready to tackle this preventable 
disease, using the limited resources necessary to do the job.

SUBJECT: RAWLINGS AT NRC: BIG BUILD-UP, BIGGER LET-DOWN 
 
REF: 2003 ACCRA 0598 
 
1.  (SBU)   Summary.  Former President Jerry Rawlings 
appeared before the National Reconciliation Commission on 
February 12.  Intense media speculation preceded his 
appearance, which had been the occasion of considerable 
jockeying between the Commission and Rawlings\' legal team. He 
answered a short series of questions on video and audio tapes 
of interrogations and executions in the 1980s, and was then 
abruptly, if politely, dismissed.   While the Commission 
successfully secured his attendance, and conducted its 
proceedings in an orderly and fair manner, it largely 
disappointed the Ghanaian public, which had expected a 
thorough-going exchange with Rawlings on human rights abuses 
during his early years in power.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  In answer to a subpoena served upon him earlier in 
the week, Rawlings appeared at the Commission chambers in 
downtown Accra accompanied by his attorneys and senior 
officials of his National Democratic Congress.  Large crowds 
of boisterous supporters made entry difficult as policemen 
sought to keep order.   Once in the hall, Rawlings took an 
oath and then calmly answered questions put to him by a 
Commission staff attorney, his responses carried live on 
Ghanaian television.  Embassy employees circulating in the 
city noticed that entire sections of Accra seemingly came to 
a halt as office workers, pedestrians and market ladies 
clustered around radios and TVs. 
 
3.  (U) The questioning began on his knowledge or possession 
of video and audio tapes allegedly made of interrogations and 
executions in two separate incidents in the 1980s.  Rawlings 
acknowledged making an audio tape of the execution ground 
confession of a condemned officer who participated in the 
1983 murder of three judges.  He also acknowledged having 
briefly viewed portions of a video tape of a suspect in an 
attempted coup d\'etat in 1984.  He denied any knowledge of 
the tapes present whereabouts. 
 
4.  (U) To the astonishment of Rawlings, the crowded 
galleries, and the assembled Ghanaian media, the Chairman of 
the Commission then dismissed Rawlings, subject to his recall 
for further questioning.  Rawlings made his way back through 
the large crowds of supporters outside the chambers, many of 
whom then marched peacefully to his central Accra residence. 
Said one incredulous journalist, \"It took longer for him to 
come and go than to answer their questions.\"  Upon leaving 
the chamber, Rawlings pronounced the just-completed 
proceedings \"polite and decent.\" 
 
5.  (U) Commission officials expressed satisfaction with the 
proceedings, saying the session had gone as they had \"hoped 
and expected.\"  Commission Executive Director Ken Attafuah 
said that Rawlings appearance had been a \"victory for the 
rule of law.\" The former president had been called, he said, 
to answer two specific evidentiary questions, and was not 
expected to testify generally on his knowledge of the 
incidents concerned. 
 
6.  (U)  Rawlings\' appearance before the Commission was the 
subject of mounting speculation in recent weeks, as he and 
his legal team received repeated requests for information, 
and, finally, subpoenas commanding his presence.  The 
Commission has been wrestling with exactly how and when to 
take Rawlings\' testimony since March of last year (reftel). 
His former National Security Advisor, Kojo Tsikata, had been 
called on February 10, and had testified at length on the 
subject of the murdered judges.  Tsikata had offered a 
spirited defense of his actions, denying any involvement. 
Observers had expected Rawlings testimony two days later, on 
the identical petition, to be equally vigorous and assertive. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Comment.  Ghanaians expected dramatic exchanges on 
one of the most notorious incidents from the early years of 
Rawlings\' PNDC government. Instead, they received a brief, 
rather dry discussion on the whereabouts of audio and video 
tapes.  Rawlings is subject to recall, but he travels 
regularly outside the country, and further testimony may be 
weeks away.  The Commission appears content to have secured 
Rawlings\' attendance, and to have conducted his examination, 
however briefly, in a dignified and orderly manner.  However, 
the Commission\'s focus on carefully structured proceedings 
may, this day, have missed the mark.  Rawlings has been 
accused by Commission witnesses of participation in these and 
other murders.  He has yet to account for or defend his 
actions, an opportunity he, and the Ghanaian public, must 
still await.  End comment.

SUBJECT: TSA INSPECTS GHANA AIRWAYS AFTER 6 CANCELLED 
FLIGHTS 
 
REF: ACCRA 139 
 
Classified By: EconChief Chris Landberg for Reason 1.5 (d) 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) officials came to inspect flight security operations 
procedures at Ghana Airways (GA) because of the recent 
incident regarding a banned co-pilot. After enduring six 
flight cancellations, TSA Officials were able to finally 
inspect a Ghana Airways flight on Tuesday February 10. While 
concerned with some procedural and communications 
inconsistencies, TSA was comfortable enough with GA 
procedures to leave. The only concern by TSA now is the 
sustainability of the procedures. Post believes Ghana Airways 
permission to operate to and from the U.S. is worthy of 
further scrutiny. End summary. 
 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
2. (U) Three Transportation Security Administration officials 
visited Accra from February 3-10 expecting to evaluate at 
least three Ghana Airways flights to the U.S. In light of the 
recent banning of a Ghana Airways co-pilot who had flown to 
the U.S. after his name appeared on a No Fly list, TSA 
officials came to Ghana to address what it saw as gaps in the 
level of security scrutiny to which Ghana Airways subjected 
its passengers. (Reftel) 
 
 
Initial Meeting with Ghana Air CEO Owusu, Not Good 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3. (SBU) Econoff accompanied TSA officials to an initial 
meeting with Ghana Airways (GA) CEO Phillip Owusu on February 
4. Cordial and straightforward, TSA officials explained their 
expectations of the evaluation--to witness GA preparation for 
and departure to U.S. airspace, including check in, ground 
security, aircraft search, ground safety and secondary search 
procedures. TSA officials explained that every airline 
operating to and from the U.S. is required to implement all 
Emergency Amendments (EAs) sent out by the TSA. Ghana Airways 
was under scrutiny due to its inconsistent communications 
with TSA regarding EAs and the banning of a Ghana Airways 
co-pilot from flying to U.S. airspace (a reflection of Ghana 
Airways disregard of operating procedures). TSA reps asked 
for assurances that the Acting Head of Security Dennis 
Bassaku could be reached on a 24-hour basis, necessitating a 
mobile phone and consistent computer access at his office. 
Owusu assured TSA that these things would be provided, but 
that is where his cordiality ended. 
 
4. (C) Owusu used the occasion to express his frustration at 
the way the banned co-pilot, who was arrested and taken to a 
holding facility in Maryland, was treated in the U.S. He 
further accused the U.S. Embassy and the TSA of being remiss 
in not notifying him personally that the co-pilot was banned 
from U.S. airspace. Larbi tried to explain that the pilot 
flew to the U.S. after appearing on the No Fly List that 
Ghana Airways itself must vet and cross check before its 
flights leave for the U.S. Larbi explained further that the 
pilot\'s prolonged detention was a surprise to him, but TSA 
has no control over what happens to a person who appears on 
the No Fly List and subsequently flies to the U.S. Owusu 
continued to insist that U.S. authorities were remiss in 
their duties, not Ghana Airways and that he would continue to 
pursue diplomatic action. 
 
 
A Tragedy of Errors 
------------------- 
 
5. (U) The inspection team, expecting to begin work the night 
of their February 3 arrival, was thwarted by a technical 
difficulty that left the Ghana Airways flight grounded in 
Baltimore. The next opportunity to inspect a flight was to be 
the night of February 4, but again, technical difficulties 
prevented the flight from arriving to Accra and the outbound 
flight to the U.S. was cancelled. Four more last-minute 
flight cancellations left TSA wondering whether Ghana Airways 
was trying to prevent inspection. During their inspection of 
preparations for one of the cancelled flights, TSA was 
encouraged that GA security authorities had the correct No 
Fly and Selectee lists. However, they were discouraged by the 
improper procedures for vetting the list and the absence of 
six EAs for which GA Security Chief Bassaku had previously 
acknowledged receipt and implementation. Non-compliant 
airlines can be penalized USD 11,000 per passenger per flight 
for not following all security regulations. The inspectors 
noted that given what they had seen, they would have sent 
their concerns to their superiors in Brussels and Washington. 
Throughout the drama, airline authorities did not notify TSA 
of planned and unplanned flight schedules, instead TSA had to 
call GA operations workers to get this information. 
 
 
Final Meeting with Ghana Airways CEO and Inspection 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
6. (C) Frustrated by what they saw, TSA met with the DCM and 
Econoff on February 10 to explain their message to GA CEO 
Owusu and to consider the consequences of GA\'s non-compliance 
and the cancellation of every flight they were to inspect. 
Econoff accompanied TSA to meet Owusu for a second time. The 
inspectors told Owusu that they must inspect a flight 
operation to the U.S., GA must improve its system of vetting 
the No Fly and Selectee lists and Security Chief Bassaku must 
have 24-hour contact capability (including a cell phone and 
internet capability). In a far less combative mood than our 
previous visit, Owusu assured TSA officials that they would 
see a complete flight operation (wheels up) that day. He also 
admitted that Ghana Airways financial difficulties had 
crippled operations. The officials were able to observe a 
full operation to the U.S. February 10. There were only some 
minor procedural issues that concerned them. Airline security 
employees seemed to grasp what they needed to do to ensure 
compliance. TSA\'s only concern was what would happen after 
they left. They wanted some assurance of sustainability in a 
compliance program for GA and are going to communicate more 
frequently with Security Chief Bassaku. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) After a number of tries, GA security officials sort 
of got it right. However, TSA concerns about sustainability 
of compliance procedures are well taken. GA\'s cash-strapped 
status undermines GA\'s ability to operate flights to and from 
the United States. Owusu has again made a plea to Italian 
officials (this time religious officials) to intervene on 
Ghana Airway,s behalf to \"reschedule\" the 25 million dollar 
debt owed to Alitalia that prevents Ghana Airways planes from 
being serviced.  After 40 plus years in the International Air 
Transport Association (IATA), Ghana Airways was kicked out in 
2002. The GoG, while forcing GA to continue to operate, has 
done little to financially support its operations. TSA 
officials explained that security (handled by them in DHS) 
and safety (handled by FAA) have been operationally 
separated.  At some point, the FAA should make a decision on 
when an airline\'s financial status prevents it from complying 
with safety regulations for flights into the U.S. If past 
performance on security and operations activities are any 
indication, Ghana Airways is an airline deserving of further 
scrutiny. End Comment.

     C. 03 ACCRA 2404 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Mary C. Yates, reason 1.5 (B/D). 
 
1. (C)   Summary. President Kufuor told the Ambassador 
February 23 that he has placed Ghanaian security forces on a 
quiet \"state of alert\" while he attends the AU summit in 
Tripoli.  Concern over the recent activities of former 
President Rawlings, public allegations against Kufuor\'s 
National Security Advisor at the National Reconciliation 
Commission, and alleged grumblings from President Compaore of 
Burkina Faso, have heightened presidential jitters.  While 
these concerns appear overblown, they do reveal the level of 
insecurity the GOG manifests when the subject is Rawlings and 
his supposed ability to make mischief for the Ghanaian 
government.  End summary. 
 
2. (C)  On February 23 President Kufuor invited Ambassador 
Yates to the Castle for an informal discussion on Ghana\'s 
internal security situation (polchief attended as notetaker). 
 Kufuor focused on his imminent departure for the AU summit 
in Tripoli, which coincided with the absence from Ghana of 
National Security Coordinator Francis Poku (in Washington for 
consultations, accompanied by our Regional Affairs Officer). 
High-profile appearances before the National Reconciliation 
Commission by former President Rawlings and, separately, 
Rawlings\' long-serving security advisor Kojo Tsikata (ref B), 
had increased GOG security concerns, said Kufuor.  \"We are on 
a state of alert for the next week or so,\" said Kufuor.  He 
asked the USG to \"use its network\" to \"see if something is 
brewing.\" 
 
3. (C)  Kufuor referred several times to \"the recent attack\" 
on Poku as a threat to national security.  Kufuor appeared to 
be referring to Kojo Tsikata\'s statements before the NRC, 
during which he accused Poku of having supervised abusive 
interrogation sessions when Tsikata was arrested on 
coup-plotting charges in the mid-1970s (the bulk of Tsikata\'s 
testimony concerned his own role in the murder of several 
judges in the early 1980s).  Kufuor took the time to review 
the history of the overthrow of the two previous elected 
Presidents, Busia (69-72) and Limann (79-81), both toppled by 
military coup-d\'etat before the end of their four year terms. 
 He said that Rawlings\' NDC \"knows\" it cannot win the 
December elections fairly, and \"hates\" being in opposition. 
 
4. (C)  Suggestions from unnamed sources had also reached 
Kufuor, he said, that President Compaore of Burkina Faso was 
\"unhappy\" with Kufuor and his government.  Kufuor had no 
details, but he suggested that the \"hidden hand\" of Kojo 
Tsikata was evident in this potential souring of relations 
 
SIPDIS 
with Burkina Faso.  Rawlings\' political party, the NDC, was 
\"in contact\" with the government of Burkina Faso, he said, 
and would \"use anything\" to injure the Kufuor Administration. 
 Tsikata (estranged from Rawlings for several years) had his 
own contacts and would not hesitate to cause trouble for the 
GOG.  Kufuor said he had tried, unsuccessfully, to reach 
Compaore by telephone, but would see him at the AU Summit and 
make a point of speaking to him. 
 
5. (C)  Comment.  As we said recently (ref A), we see no 
serious threat to the security of the Kufuor Administration 
from Rawlings or his supporters.  Compaore\'s level of 
\"unhappiness\" we cannot judge -- we defer to our colleagues 
in Ouagadougou.  The absence of the President and Francis 
Poku, the even-tempered director of the GOG security team, 
means that more nervous observers of the political scene, 
including President Kufuor\'s brother, Defense Minister 
Addo-Kufuor, may grow even more fearful about the alleged 
threat presented by Rawlings. The President seems more 
level-headed.  When the Ambassador shared with the President 
that Rawlings had invited her to meet him informally, Kufuor 
encouraged the Ambassador to do so.  We think nervousness 
within the GOG must be seen in the context of increasing 
election fever in Ghana, and political maneuvering between 
the Kufuor Administration and the opposition NDC. End 
comment.

SUBJECT: 2004 TRAFFICKING IN PERSON REPORT - GHANA 
 
REF: STATE 7869 
 
The following responses are keyed to reftel. 
 
----------------- 
Para 18: Overview 
----------------- 
 
A.  Ghana is both a country of origin and a destination for 
internationally trafficked persons.  Internal trafficking 
appears more common than cross-border trafficking; however, 
internal trafficking has been examined more closely by local 
NGOs and International Organizations than cross-border 
trafficking.  The Government does not have official figures 
on the number of trafficked persons, either domestic or 
cross-border, and estimates are difficult to come by and of 
limited reliability. 
 
B.  Domestically, most trafficking is in children.  Children 
are sent from the coastal areas to work in the fishing 
communities along the Volta Lake, and from the northern 
regions to the cities of Accra and Kumasi to work as domestic 
helpers, porters, and assistants to local traders. 
 
Internationally, the majority of trafficking involves 
children between the ages of seven and seventeen being 
shipped to and from the neighboring countries of Cote 
d\'Ivoire, Togo and Nigeria to work as laborers or household 
help, or young women to work as prostitutes.  Ghana is also a 
transit country.  There is a growing trade in Nigerian women 
transiting Ghana on their way to Western Europe to work in 
the sex industry, and there is reportedly some trafficking in 
persons from Burkina Faso, going through Ghana on their way 
to Cote d\'Ivoire.  Ghana Police Interpol officers have 
recognized a possible trend of Ghanaian expatriates returning 
to Ghana to marry young girls only to engage them in 
prostitution once in Europe. 
 
C. Due to a lack of current reliable data, we have not been 
able to detect any appreciable changes in the direction or 
extent of trafficking over the past year. 
 
D.  The most detailed surveys to date have been done by the 
African Center for Human Development (April 2002) and the 
Ministry of Manpower Development and Employment in conjuction 
with the ILO (February 2001).  Other NGOs have studied 
specific pockets of domestic trafficking sending and 
receiving areas.  No other studies are currently projected. 
Most efforts to combat trafficking in the past year have 
focused on awareness creation, rescue/repatriation of 
domestically trafficked children and poverty reduction. 
 
E.  Ghana is not a major destination for internationally 
trafficked victims.  Those trafficked domestically are used 
primarily for labor.  A February 2002 study funded by the 
Danish government through a local NGO found that the largest 
percentage of trafficked children work in the local fishing 
industry (39 percent), while 30 percent engage in selling, 20 
percent work as domestic laborers, eight percent as porters 
and three percent in farming.  The laborers are either not 
paid at all, or given very low wages.  Many children suffer 
serious abuse, malnutrition, long working hours.  Most are 
denied the opportunity of an education.  Because trafficked 
children are often sent away by families unable to support 
them, and sometimes in exchange for cash payments, they 
cannot easily return home despite their maltreatment. 
 
F.  Children from impoverished rural backgrounds are the 
primary victims of trafficking from Ghana to other countries. 
 Recruited children are usually between the ages of seven and 
fifteen, although there are reports of trafficked children as 
young as four.  Much of the recruitment of children is done 
with the consent of the parents, who are sometimes given an 
advance payment or promised regular stipends from the 
recruiter.  The parents are told the children will receive 
food, shelter, and often some sort of vocational training or 
education.  Some children are sent to work for extended 
family members in urban areas, who may treat the children 
relatively well.  Many, however, are given to professional 
recruiters, who, upon reaching the cities, hand the children 
off to those who will be their actual employers.  In many 
cases, the children never receive the promised education or 
vocational training.  Young Ghanaian women are also 
reportedly targeted by international traffickers promising 
jobs in Western Europe.  As mentioned in Para 18, B, police 
officials have noticed a trend of Ghanaian expatriates 
offering young women marriage and a promising new life in 
Western Europe only to end in prostitution.  They are sent 
mostly to Germany, Italy, or the Netherlands, either directly 
or indirectly through neighboring countries.  Some young 
women also end up in the Middle East, where they work menial 
jobs or as domestic help. 
G.  Despite its enormous resource constraints, the GOG is 
making a good faith effort to seriously address trafficking. 
Political will exists at the highest levels.  Most efforts 
during the year continued to focus on programs outside the 
legal system - prevention and protection of victims. 
Throughout the year, GOG officials collaborated with 
international donors and NGOs to repatriate trafficked 
children, reintegrate them into the formal education system, 
and offer poverty reduction assistance to parents.  NGOs and 
GOG officials repatriated over 1,000 children during the 
year.  UNICEF and the Ministry of Women and Children\'s 
Affairs (MWCA) provided vocational training to girls engaged 
in \"kayayei\" or itinerant portering.  The MWCA also worked to 
encourage parents who sold their children to bring them home 
in exchange for business assistance, vocational training, 
credit facilities, assistance with school fees and school 
uniforms.  The Ministry of Manpower Development and 
Employment worked with Catholic Action for Street Children 
and other NGOs to assist street children.  On June 12 for the 
World Day Against Child Labor, Members of Parliament debated 
the issue of child labor and child trafficking.  In November 
2003, the Vice President condemned the \"slavery and 
trafficking of children for labor\" in a keynote address at a 
conference on the historic slave trade.  In the annual budget 
statement to Parliament, read at the beginning of February, 
2004, the Minister of Finance announced the administration\'s 
intention to submit the Human Trafficking Bill to Parliament 
this year, and highlighted efforts taken in 2003 to combat 
trafficking and child labor, assist street children, and 
alleviate poverty, especially through women\'s development 
programs. 
 
In summer 2003, the World Bank provided a USD 2.3 million 
loan that the GOG has used to assist street children (many of 
whom were likely trafficked) in the major metropolitan areas 
of Ghana (Accra/Tema, Sekondi/Takoradi, Kumasi, and Tamale). 
The Ministry of Manpower Development and Employment continues 
to implement the one-year program, which tests strategies for 
delivering integrated support services (skills development, 
health services, HIV/AIDs awareness, and family services) to 
street children in order to develop a well-rounded policy to 
assist them. 
 
The MWCA established a Women\'s Development Fund, disbursing 
10 billion cedis ($1.1 million) in credit facilities to 
appproximately 20,000 women.  Mothers of trafficked children 
received over 835 million cedis ($95,000) to assist with 
school fees and uniforms and business assistance. 
 
While the mainstay of GOG and NGO actions focused on social 
solutions to trafficking, the GOG also continued to develop 
the Human Trafficking bill.  The Ministry of Manpower 
Development and Employment finally recruited a permanent 
Chief Director in October, who has since called several 
meetings of the National Human Trafficking Task Force to 
discuss how the draft trafficking legislation could be 
improved.  The Chief Director intends to call one more 
meeting (likely in March) to collect stakeholder comments and 
forward them to the Ministry of Justice before the draft bill 
is submitted to Parliament. 
 
H.  There is no evidence that Government authorities, or 
individual members of government forces, act to facilitate, 
condone, or are complicit, take bribes, or assist in 
trafficking operations. 
 
I.  The Government is limited in addressing the problem of 
trafficking by both culture and resources.  Child trafficking 
in Ghana is difficult to define.  Children from rural 
communities are commonly sent by their parents to work as 
housemaids for distant relatives in cities; a practice known 
as \"fostering.\"  Given the severe poverty that many rural 
families face, sending a child to work for well-off relations 
in the city, with the hope that the child will receive some 
vocational training or education, is regarded as a genuine 
attempt to improve that child\'s opportunities.  The idea that 
sending children to live with extended family members under 
these circumstances is \"trafficking\" would make little sense 
to many Ghanaians.  Other, more exploitative forms of 
trafficking, such as cross-border trafficking or situations 
where the children are recruited by professionals who traffic 
them for profit, are recognized as problems by the 
Government, but resources are scarce.   Law enforcement 
authorities are not equipped with adequate training or 
financial resources to deal with the problem.  Police 
officers complain that lack of legislation criminalizing 
trafficking seriously hampers their efforts to combat the 
crime.  The Government is currently vetting a draft bill that 
in addition to criminalizing trafficking, would also 
establish a victims fund for protection and rehabilitation as 
well as prevention efforts. 
 
J.  The Government does monitor anti-trafficking efforts, but 
perhaps more haphazardly than systematically.  The 
International Labor Organization\'s International Program to 
Eliminate Child Labor (ILO/IPEC) frequently holds stakeholder 
meetings and the Ministry of Manpower Development and 
Employment has hosted several National Human Trafficking Task 
Force meetings in the Fall.  The meetings include the 
Ministries of Interior, Women and Children\'s Affairs, 
Manpower Development and Employment, members of the Police 
Service, Immigration Service, Customs, NGOs, IOs, 
international donors, trade unions, and employers 
associations.  While ILO/IPEC programs require such 
stakeholder meetings, in effect, they build the capacity of 
the National Task Force, which includes the same players. 
The draft trafficking legislation is expected to better 
formalize the coordinating and monitoring functions of the 
National Task Force. 
 
K.  Prostitution is illegal. 
 
L.  Forced childhood marriage is illegal and a problem. 
However, child brides are neither bought, sold nor imported 
from abroad, and the government does enforces the law. 
Interpol officers report a recent trend of Ghanaian 
expatriates returning to Ghana to marry young women, who are 
later forced into prostitution in Western Europe.  However, 
these women appear to be tricked into the marriage (not 
bought or sold) in hopes of a better life abroad.  On August 
15, 2003, a Circuit Court in Wa, Upper West Region sentences 
a farmer to prison for 14 years for sexually assaulting and 
marrying a 14 year old girl. 
 
------------------- 
Para 19: Prevention 
------------------- 
 
A.  Yes, the Government acknowledges that trafficking is a 
problem and has begun to address the problem on a coordinated 
and systematic basis (see para 18, G). 
 
B.  The following government agencies are involved in 
anti-trafficking efforts:  the Ministry of Interior 
(responsible for the Ghana Police Service and Ghana 
Immigration Service); the Ministry of Manpower Development 
and Employment (responsible for vocational training programs 
and the Department of Social Welfare); the Ministry of Women 
and Children\'s Affairs (responsible for advocacy of women and 
children\'s rights). 
 
C.  Almost all anti-trafficking information or education 
campaigns have been run either in coordination with NGOs and 
International Organizations (IOs) or by the NGOs or IOs 
themselves.  The Ghana National Commission on Children (GNCC 
- part of the MWCA) has sponsored formal community gatherings 
to discuss the hazards of trafficking.  The WAJU has 
participated in information campaigns in Kokrobite, a coastal 
village known for sending children to work along the Volta 
Lake, as well as two bus/transit stations in Accra, to 
educate drivers on how to identify trafficking victims.  NGOs 
have initiated anti-trafficking poster campaigns, community 
gatherings, and media campaigns. 
 
D.  The Government is very supportive of programs to prevent 
trafficking, but usually relies on outside donor funding to 
maintain them. 
 
The Government of Ghana pays approximately 10 percent of the 
costs of ILO/IPEC programs to combat trafficking and child 
labor, and provides office space to ILO/IPEC staff.  In 
addition, the GOG supports programs designed to empower women 
and children that indirectly helps prevent trafficking (often 
using donated or debt-forgiveness funds).  Certain components 
of the Government\'s National Poverty Reduction Program are 
designed to alleviate child poverty and improve children\'s 
access to education, and the Ministry of Women\'s Affairs runs 
programs which serve to educate women on the importance of 
children\'s education.  The Ghana Education Service has an 
extensive program to promote girl-child education, and 
includes child labor issues in its curriculum. 
 
E.  The Government does support programs (see above), though 
scarcity of resources is always a problem. 
 
F.  The Government\'s relationship with NGOs, international 
organizations, and civil society is very constructive. 
G.  The Director of Ghana Immigration is committeed to 
combatting human trafficking.  However, like police 
counterparts, Immigration officers complain they are 
constrained by the lack of legislation criminalizing 
trafficking.  In addition, the GOG does not have the required 
resources to adequately monitor and control Ghana\'s lengthy 
land borders.  The lack of sufficient data to monitor 
immigration patterns, for example, stems from the lack of 
communication infrastructure between border posts and their 
regional offices. 
 
H.  See para 18, G and J.  The National Task Force on Human 
Trafficking currently works on policy, but is projected to 
become a coordinating body after the passage of legislation 
to combat trafficking. 
 
I.  In the past, the GOG has particpated in Economic 
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) conferences on 
trafficking in persons, however this year, there have been no 
such conferences.  Security and Social Welfare agencies do 
cooperate with their international counterparts. 
 
J.  The GOG does have a National Plan to Combat Trafficking, 
as well as a National Task Force. (Para 18 G and J).  In 
October 2001, Ghana hosted a meeting of ECOWAS Experts 
Against Trafficking in Persons, which resulted in a regional 
plan of action that called for states to establish their own 
action plans, national task forces and national awareness 
campaigns.  The GOG formally launched their task force and 
national plan in March 2002, which was slow to develop due to 
changes in directorships of important Ministries such as 
Manpower Development and Employment.  However, with a 
permanant Chief Director of Manpower Development and 
Employment installed in the summer of 2003, and the UN Office 
of Drugs and Crime offering assistance with the Task Force 
and Plan of Action in the fall, the effort has been revived 
in ernest.  Since then, several Task Force meetings have been 
held to critically review the draft trafficking legislation. 
 
K.  The Ministry of Justice has the lead on developing the 
new law against trafficking.  The Ministry of Manpower 
Development and Employment\'s child labor unit takes the lead 
on programs to combat child labor, and its Social Welfare 
Department offers victims protection.  The Ministry of 
Interior leads law enforcement efforts.  The draft 
trafficking bill will establish the Minister of either 
Manpower Development and Employment or the Minister of Women 
and Children\'s Affairs as the Chair on the National Task 
Force on Human Trafficking. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Para 20: Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
A.  There is no specific provision in Ghanaian law outlawing 
trafficking in persons.  There are laws against slavery, 
prostitution, rape (including child rape, termed 
\"defilement\"), use of underage labor, child stealing, 
kidnapping, abduction, manufacture of fraudulent 
documentation, etc.  Traffickers may be prosecuted under 
these statutes, however, police officials claim they are 
often inadequate.  For example, a child trafficker who has 
obtained the child with the parent\'s consent cannot be 
charged with abduction.  During the fall, the Ministry of 
Manpower Development and Employment organized several 
workshops for stakeholders to review the draft trafficking 
legislation, with the intention of compiling all comments and 
submitting them to the Ministry of Justice to revise the 
draft before it is sent to Parliament.  In February 2004, the 
Minister of Finance announced the administration\'s intention 
to submit the bill to Parliament this year. 
 
B.  There are currently no specific penalties for 
trafficking, but penalties for related offenses range from 
six months to 25 years. 
 
C.  Rape is punishable by 7 to 25 years in prison. 
 
D.  In the past, traffickers have been prosecuted under 
statutes listed in para 20, item A.  Information on 
sentencing of traffickers is not kept separately from other 
data on sentencing for rape, kidnapping, and other offenses 
for which traffickers can be prosecuted.  During the year, 
police arrested four persons for trafficking-related 
offenses, however, none were convicted, police officials say, 
due to the lack of an anti-trafficking law.  Also during the 
year, a couple in the Eastern Region was sentenced to 2 years 
in prison and fined approximately $1,150 for trying to sell a 
neighbor\'s 3-year-old son.  A woman accused of taking four 
Ghanaian girls to work as prostitutes in Nigeria was released 
when the girls failed to show up in court to testify.  A 
court in the Upper East Region arraigned a woman who was 
arrested in 2001 for trafficking eight boys and three girls 
to the Gambia.  The trial is still ongoing, as is a 2002 case 
of traffickers intercepted with 50 children. 
 
E.  Within Ghana, brokers or recruiters procure children from 
rural areas and move them to the locations where they will 
work (see para 18, F.)  These recruiters may move as many as 
ten children at one time.  Internationally, some trafficking 
groups are reportedly taking advantage of Ghana\'s growing 
international air links by moving Nigerian women through 
Ghana to Europe. 
 
F.  Local law enforcement does not use any special techniques 
in the detection or investigation of trafficking, however, 
there are several cases involving detection of trafficking by 
police through tip-offs by local residents. 
 
G.  The National Plan to Combat Trafficking includes a 
training component for police and immigration officers. 
 
H.  As per responses to Paragraph 19, the GOG does cooperate 
with other governments, chiefly through the existing ECOWAS 
Plan of Action.  Post is not aware of any international 
investigations. 
 
I.  We have no examples of the extradition of accused 
traffickers. 
 
J.  There is no evidence of government involvement in or 
tolerance of international trafficking.  However, it is more 
difficult to assess the Government\'s position on domestic 
trafficking.  It is commonplace for poor children from rural 
areas to go to cities and work as domestic help for extended 
family relations.  This is not viewed as \"trafficking\" and is 
not illegal in Ghana, but is seen as a way of giving the 
children improved opportunity.  Increasingly, government 
officials are becoming aware that this traditional fostering 
practice can be exploitative and constitute a human rights 
abuse. 
 
K.  We are unaware of any Government officials involved in 
trafficking. 
 
L.  Ghana ratified the UN Convention on the Rights on the 
Child in 1989 becoming one of the first countries to do so, 
and codified child rights with the 1998 Children\'s Act.  On 
September 24, 2003, Ghana signed the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution, and child pornography.  The 
Government ratified ILO Convention 182 in May 2001 and ILO 
Convention 29 in 1957.  Ghana has not ratified ILO Convention 
105 or the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Para 21:  Protection and Assistance to Victims 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
A.  Social Welfare Offices are present in every Region and 
District in the country.  However, any protection or shelter 
given to the victims of trafficking, either international or 
domestic, is done on a case-by-case basis, as resources are 
limited.  In many cases, the authorities do try to reunite 
trafficked and abused children with their families.  NGOs 
have sought to provide services the police and social 
services cannot by establishing several crisis centers. 
However, as awareness of the problem grows and trafficking 
victims seek assistance, the limited resources available for 
such assistance will be overstretched. 
 
B.  See para 19, D. 
 
C.  Trafficking victims are generally referred to the Women 
and Juvenile Unit of the Police (WAJU) and to the Social 
Welfare Department. 
 
D.  If they are arrested, the victims of international 
trafficking are prosecuted on an occasional, case-by-case 
basis, for offenses such as posession of altered documents. 
There were no cases of trafficking victims prosecuted during 
this reporting period. 
 
E.  We are unaware of trafficking victims being encouraged to 
seek redress against traffickers. 
 
F. The Government does not provide specific protection for 
victims of trafficking beyond those available to all crime 
victims or witnesses. 
 
G.  Much of the specialized training for officials in the 
past year has been sponsored by NGOs with outside donor 
funds.  ILO/IPEC provided training to Ghanaian (and Nigerian) 
security services in October 2003. 
 
H.  The Government provides assistance to repatriated 
trafficking victims on an ad-hoc basis.  There has been a 
strong emphasis on repatriating domestically trafficked 
children and providing their parents with assistance and 
credit facilities to help alleviate poverty and better enable 
the parents to care for their children.  WAJU assists victims 
of abuse and violence, including trafficking victims.  Crisis 
centers are few.  The Department of Social Welfare has a few 
children\'s homes and remand homes, but these are generally 
inappropriate and inadequate to deal with trafficking 
victims.  NGOs, working closely with local authorities, are 
stepping in where official resources are lacking to provide 
safe havens, counseling and transportation back home. 
 
I.  Several national and international NGOs as well as 
International Organizations work with trafficking victims. 
African Center for Human Development, Save the Children UK, 
Children in Need, Action Aid, Catholic Action for Street 
Children, Parent and Child Foundation, Ghana NGO Coalition on 
the Rights of the Child, Coalition for Women in Distress, 
ILO/IPEC, International Organization for Migration and UNICEF 
all work in the areas of child labor and support for street 
children.  These organizations conduct studies into 
trafficking as part of their broader agenda, perform some 
rescue operations for street kids, provide training and 
education for victims of trafficking and abuse, and, in some 
cases, offer family reunification.  National and local 
government authorities collaborate with these NGOs to combat 
trafficking in persons.

 1.  (C)  Ambassador Yate and polchief met with Foreign 
Minister Nana Akufo-Addo at his request on June 2. 
Akufo-Addo told Ambassador Yates that a meeting scheduled for 
June 3 in Abuja, consisting of Presidents Kufuor, Obasanjo 
and Gbagbo, Prime Minister Diarra, and ECOWAS Executive 
Secretary Ibn Chambas, to discuss the political impasse in 
 
SIPDIS 
Cote d\'Ivoire, had just fallen through.  Gbagbo had initially 
agreed to the meeting, said Akufo-Addo, but had just bowed 
out due to a claimed \"invitation\" to travel immediately to 
Washington for undisclosed meetings.  Akufo-Addo asked if the 
USG had issued any invitation to Gbagbo.  \"We want to know if 
Gbagbo is playing games with us,\" said Akufo-Addo. 
Ambassador said she was unaware of any invitation from the 
USG but would verify that with the Department.  When 
Ambassador Yates theorized that perhaps Gbagbo perhaps had 
meetings arranged with the UN in New York, Akufo-Addo said 
that \"Kofi Annan knows about the meeting and wants Gbagbo 
there (in Abuja).\" 
 
2.  (C)  In commenting briefly on the situation in Cote 
d\'Ivoire, Akufo-Addo said that \"Gbagbo must reach an 
accommodation with Soro, Bedie and Ouattara.\"  There was, he 
said, \"no other option.\"  He further commented that the 
Linas-Marcoussis Accords (LMA) would not be subject to any 
\"review or renegotiation.\"  While isolated \"looks\" at 
specific provisions to \"enhance implementation\" was possible, 
there was no interest within ECOWAS, he said, for any 
\"opening up\" of the LMA.  \"There will be no LMA-2,\" he said. 
 
3.  (C) Subsequently Ambassador Yates learned from PDAS 
Bridgewater (ref telecon) that the GOCI had recently employed 
a Washington lobbyist, who had been seeking appointments with 
senior Department officials.  The Department had given the 
lobbyist no encouragement, and no appointments or invitations 
had been given.  Ambassador Yates communicated this 
information to Akufo-Addo in a telephone call, also June 2. 
 
4.  (C)  Comment.  Akufo-Addo was his usual brisk and 
business-like self.  While we leave it to our colleagues in 
Abidjan to decipher Gbagbo\'s true motivation in declining to 
attend the Abuja meeting,  Akufo-Addo took an entirely 
unsympathetic view of what appeared to him to be Gbagbo\'s 
unconvincing explanations.  End summary.

SUBJECT: BACK TO THE FUTURE? ELECTION SEASON UPDATE 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (U) Six months before the December 7 presidential and 
parliamentary elections, the cast of presidential candidates 
resembles that of the 2000 elections, with four repeat 
nominees.  The ruling NPP\'s long-standing co-opting of 
prominent small party officials prompted one small party to 
investigate a \"gang of four\" who support or serve the ruling 
regime.  The major opposition NDC has decided not to field a 
candidate for a vacant parliamentary seat previously held by 
the NPP, avoiding a contest it could not win.  Meanwhile, the 
Electoral Commission\'s voter registration exercise continues 
on course, with only isolated accusations of flawed 
procedures.  End summary. 
 
Presidential Candidates: Once More With Feeling 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
2. (U) On May 30, the northern-based People\'s National 
Convention (PNC), holding three seats in the 200-member 
Parliament, re-selected Dr. Edward Mahama as its presidential 
candidate.  He now joins President Kufuor of the NPP, former 
Vice President Atta Mills of the NDC, and Dan Lartey of the 
miniscule GCPP as repeat candidates for presidency.  So far, 
only the CPP, with one member of Parliament and little 
backing nationwide, has chosen a new candidate.  Other small 
parties, bereft of funds and without significant support, 
have not yet decided whether to select their own candidates 
for the presidency or to support someone else\'s. 
 
Six Times Bitten, Seventh Time Shy 
----------------------------------- 
3. (U) According to its National Chairman, The NDC has 
decided not to contest a June 29 by-election for a seat in 
the Upper Denkyira (Central Region) constituency, vacated in 
early May with the death of the sitting MP.  A previously 
safe seat for the NPP, the NDC faced an uphill struggle 
marshaling resources for a race it likely could not win, and 
which it must refight in December.  Party executives, 
embarrassed to be ceding the seat to the NPP, appealed to the 
Electoral Commission to review the constitutional 
requirements governing by-elections.  The EC politely 
declined -- it has a clear legal duty to hold the election. 
With six consecutive losses to the NPP in by-elections in the 
last two years, discretion here proved the better part of NDC 
valor. 
 
\'Gang of Four\': CPP Neanderthals Threaten Party Homo Sapiens 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
4. (U) In late May, the CPP launched a disciplinary probe of 
the actions of four of its leading members.  Most prominently 
amongst them, Dr. Paa Kwesi Nduom, failed CPP parliamentary 
candidate in 2000, is the Minister of Energy in the Kufuor 
government.  His efforts to secure the CPP nomination once 
again for that seat, while arranging NPP support for his 
election, has riled CPP officers.  Three others are attacked 
for giving aid and comfort to the NPP government -- their 
supposed offense is to have made public statements damaging 
to the CPP.  Nduom in particular represents the modern wing 
of the CPP.  His participation in Kufuor\'s government has 
never been accepted by party ideologues, many of whom march 
resolutely toward the 1960s and Ghana\'s failed pan-socialist 
experience. 
 
Small Parties: Shifting Alliances of the Frail and Ineffectual 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
5. (U)  A \'Grand Coalition\' of the PNC, EGLE, and GCPP 
parties continues to not quite take shape.  Proposals 
circulate on some manner of shared candidacy for presidential 
and parliamentary seats.  While the PNC holds three seats in 
parliament, the other two have none and have little chance of 
winning any.  The three trumpet their shared \"Nkrumaist\" 
vision - a vision shared by few Ghanaians (though the PNC 
does have some strength in the north).  Two other Nkrumaist 
parties, the CPP and the NRP, have intermittently 
participated in these unity efforts, without success. 
 
Voter Registration: Photo-ID Effort Continues 
--------------------------------------------- 
6. (U) The national voter registration exercise continues, 
with photo-ID cards most recently issued in the Volta Region. 
 88.9 per cent of the voters preliminarily registered in 
March turned out to receive their cards.  Other regions have 
recorded slightly higher photo-ID card percentages, in the 
low 90s.  The exercise in the Volta Region, an NDC bastion, 
generated some protests by NDC officials, who feared attempts 
would be made to disenfranchise their supporters.  Changed 
dates for the photo-issuance phase caused particular worry, 
but the final results generally match those of other regions. 
 The EC plans a nationwide \"mopping-up\" exercise to catch 
remaining voters when it finishes with all the regions. 
Voters will not be able to vote in December without the 
identification card. 
 
Comment: December 2004 -- Back to the Future? 
--------------------------------------------- 
7. (U) With the national elections six months off, four of 
the seven men who ran for president in 2000 will run again. 
President Kufour\'s only serious competition remains former 
Vice President Mills.  The NDC\'s apparent decision not to 
contest the empty parliamentary seat reflects its own reduced 
fortunes (it is strapped for funds), as well as a commonsense 
decision not to fight where it would likely lose big.  As 
Ghana\'s small parties worry themselves over electoral 
alliances that will produce little tangible benefit, the 
Electoral Commission continues its workmanlike efforts to 
complete the new voter registration process. End comment.

     B. ACCRA 1171 
 
Classified By: A/DCM Richard Kaminski, reason 1.5 (B/D). 
 
 
 1.  (C)  Mission proposes the following points for use by 
Secretary Powell in his June 11 meeting with President 
 
SIPDIS 
Kufuor.  We recommend a supportive message, which 
acknowledges the Kufuor government\'s leading role in working 
toward peace in the sub-region, particularly Cote d\'Ivoire 
and Liberia, and asks for his counsel on next steps.  We also 
recommend noting our pleasure in Ghana\'s selection for the 
MCA, while indicating that solid proposals for access to the 
MCA funds, and further progress on the business climate and 
good governance, are necessary. 
 
2.  (C) Cote d\'Ivoire 
 
President Kufuor and his administration have expended 
considerable effort in addressing the crisis in Cote 
d\'Ivoire.  Last year\'s Accra II meeting breathed new life 
into the Linus-Marcoussis Accords, and Kufuor and Foreign 
Minister Akufo-Addo continue to consult widely in attempting 
to preserve the peace process. The GOG continues to believe 
that LMA is the proper basis for a resolution to the crisis, 
although adjustments to various provisions to improve 
implementation are probably needed.  As Head of ECOWAS, and 
the President of a neighboring state with a large expatriate 
community in Cote d\'Ivoire, Kufuor has successfully 
functioned as an honest broker, and should be commended for 
his continuing efforts. 
 
-- We were disturbed to see the proposed mini-summit in Abuja 
on June 3 fall through.  Your government\'s effort to 
encourage compromise and positive solutions are laudable and 
valuable. 
 
-- The general feeling here is that Cote d\'Ivoire is at a 
potentially dangerous impasse  -- neither Gbagbo nor the G7 
opposition parties appear very willing to make concessions 
toward resuming business as a true government of national 
unity. 
 
-- Can we ask you what you hoped to accomplish in the Abuja 
meeting? 
 
--   What sort of forum do you envisage for such discussions 
on the proper inplementation of LMA, and what solutions would 
you propose to further that implementation? 
 
3.  (C) Liberia 
 
Ghana hosted the peace conference last summer that led to the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the setting up of the 
National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL).  Ghana 
maintains its troop deployment in Liberia under the UN PKO, 
and Foreign Minister Akufo-Addo travels regularly to the Mano 
River Union area, including Monrovia, to assess the 
situation.  The Ghanaian ambassador to Monrovia, Kwame 
Amoa-Awua, is an experienced and sensible diplomat with close 
ties to the Kufuor administration.  The GOG generally shares 
USG views that while much progress has been achieved, much 
remains to be done. 
 
-- May I first commend you once again for your leadership as 
ECOWAS Chairman on Liberia.  Without Ghana\'s close 
involvement in the peace process, the international community 
might not have been successful in staging a PKO, removing 
Charles Taylor and setting up an interim government. 
 
-- Can we have your assessment on the situation in Liberia? 
How well do you think the National Transitional Government of 
Liberia (NTGL) is functioning? 
 
-- Can the NTGL keep to the October 2005 timeline for 
elections? 
 
-- We know that Interim Chairman Bryant made an impassioned 
plea on the lifting of sanctions on Liberia to the UNSC June 
3.  What is your position on remaining sanctions? 
 
4.  (C) MCA 
 
Ghana is one of five West African nations to qualify for the 
Millenium Challenge Account.  The MCC team arrived in Accra 
on June 6, and will have a wide variety of meetings with 
senior GOG officials, businessmen, members of NGOs and other 
donors.  The GOG sees its selection as yet another 
affirmation both of its close relationship with the US and 
its reformist programs. 
 
-- May I offer our congratulations on Ghana\'s selection for 
the MCA.  While our embassy in Accra and we here in the State 
Department worked hard for Ghana\'s inclusion, the Millenium 
Challenge Corporation is an autonomous entity, and Ghana 
objectively qualified for the program. 
 
-- I know the MCC team has just been in Accra, and is having 
a very positive series of meetings with your government and 
with your NGO and business community. 
 
-- You have cleared the first and most important hurdle -- 
selection for the program.  Now comes the second hurdle: the 
framing of sensible projects the MCC can support. 
 
-- Proposals based upon your government\'s ability to address 
economic growth and reduce poverty, as well as accentuate 
accountability and good governance, will be welcomed. 
 
-- What sectors do you see being the basis for your proposals? 
 
5.  (C) Positive Business Climate 
 
Ghana does not score as highly on evaluations of its business 
climate as other aspects of its reform program, particularly 
receptivity to foreign-owned businesses and foreign 
investment.  Partly this is due to inexperience in dealing in 
a modern business climate.  Ghana also has a long history of 
extensive government oversight of and involvement in the 
private sector -- the government, either directly or through 
parastatals, still owns or controls large segments of key 
industries (railroads, ports, electricity generation and 
distribution, the national airline, water supplies, the cocoa 
market, etc).  We find its policy direction to be sound, but 
it begins from a different stage of economic well-being and 
perception of the government\'s organizing role. 
 
-- Receptivity to foreign businesses and foreign investment 
is the key to any \"Golden Age of Business.\"  What are your 
plans to streamline your procedures to attract foreign 
investors and foreign businessmen? 
 
-- There is a perception in the international marketplace 
that Ghana is not as welcoming as it could be.  Ghana can 
expand its base of interested investors and build a better 
economic future by working with those investors in a 
collaborative and mutually-reinforcing manner. 
 
-- Your upcoming Trade Fair in Atlanta in September in an 
opportunity to put your best foot forward, and display for 
the American business community a renewed receptivity to them.

TAGS: EAID, ETRD, GH 
SUBJECT: TREASURY UNDER SECRETARY TAYLOR AND GHANA TRADE 
MINISTER DISCUSS KIGALI MEETING OF AFRICAN TRADE MINISTERS 
 
REF: ACCRA 1200 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) Treasury Under Secretary John Taylor met May 31 with 
Trade Minister Alan Kyerematen, who had just returned from 
the African Union trade ministers\' meeting in Kigali. 
Responding to recent U.S. and EU WTO proposals, the ministers 
drafted an African strategy for WTO negotiations.  It calls 
for special/differential treatment, greater market access, 
and a timeline for cuts in agricultural subsidies. 
Kyerematen complained that the trade component in Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) is weak and applauded the 
MCA\'s emphasis on growth.  Ghana plans to urge faster trade 
liberalization at the ECOWAS heads of state level.  End 
Summary. 
 
Kigali Consensus 
---------------- 
2. (SBU) Kyerematen said African trade ministers developed a 
proposal for a post-Cancun strategy ) the \"Kigali consensus\" 
) that calls for enhanced market access for African products 
and for specific timelines for reducing and eliminating trade 
distorting supports for agriculture.  The ministers wanted to 
capitalize on recent U.S. and EU indications of flexibility, 
and the idea was to come up with a useful proposal that could 
move the process forward. 
 
3. (SBU) African countries are unable to take advantage of 
market opportunities, Kyerematen said, because of non-tariff 
barriers ) sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and technical 
barriers to trade (TBT).  He asked the U.S. to provide more 
technical assistance to improve African businesses ability to 
meet these difficult developed world requirements.  Taylor 
responded that the U.S. has emphasized trade capacity 
building. 
 
4. (SBU) Kyerematen said the Kigali consensus calls for 
definite timelines for eliminating agricultural export 
subsidies, which the African ministers realize the U.S. 
supports, and also for reducing domestic supports and 
subsidies.  Taylor responded that the U.S. proposal includes 
increasing market access, eliminating export subsidies and 
reducing domestic supports, but accepted Kyerematen\'s point 
that the African ministers were looking for set timelines. 
Kyerematen commented that the EU is prepared to eliminate 
trade distorting supports on products important to developing 
countries, postponing broader reductions.  However, he agreed 
with Taylor that the point is for developing countries to 
eventually become developed, so the African countries do not 
want the EU to develop a fixed list of products that cannot 
be expanded. 
 
5. (SBU) On tariff escalation, Kyerematen said the ministers 
understand the U.S. and EU want developing countries to bind 
tariffs at present levels.  The Kigali proposal reiterates 
calls for special and differential treatment, to allow 
developing countries to build industrial capacity.  He added 
that the ministers expected the EU and U.S. would not 
pressure African countries for immediate or rapid tariff 
reductions. 
 
6. (SBU) Kyerematen was less clear on the Kigali ministers\' 
position on cotton.  They apparently agreed to consolidate it 
into the overall agricultural talks.  However, they proposed 
including it on the priority list and setting a set time 
period for elimination of developed country supports to the 
sector ) three years for subsidies and four years for 
domestic supports.  (Note:  Kyerematen told econoff June 7 
that he understands the U.S. has agreed to the principle of 
time limits, but was not sure if the U.S. had accepted a set 
timeframe.  End Note)  His only comment regarding Singapore 
issues was that the general consensus was to negotiate on 
trade facilitation and postpone the other three issues. 
 
ECOWAS Trade Liberalization 
--------------------------- 
7. (SBU) Ghana is concerned that Nigerian trade barriers and 
export expansion grants are interfering with ECOWAS trade 
liberalization efforts.  Kyerematen asserted that the GoG is 
committed to the ECOWAS common market and will raise this at 
the next heads of state meeting. 
 
Pro-Growth Strategies, Trade, and the MCA 
----------------------------------------- 
8. (SBU) Kyerematen complained that pro-growth strategies, 
especially the trade component of economic development, are 
under-represented in PRSPs, which stress poverty reduction 
and social programs.  Taylor agreed, adding that growth and 
trade were also not main features of the UN\'s Millennium 
Development Goals.  Kyerematen was pleased to hear U/S Taylor 
state that growth is at the heart of the MCA.  (Note:  U/S 
Taylor\'s MCA discussions reported reftel.  End Note) 
 
9. (SBU) Kyerematen pointed to the Kufuor administration\'s 
Presidential Special Initiatives as an example of the GoG\'s 
policies to promote growth.  He disputed criticism that the 
initiative is government intervention in the economy, or 
\"picking winners,\" as is commonly alleged.  Rather, he called 
it government &engagement8 in strategic sectors to foment 
export-driven growth and employment generation.  The GoG is 
focusing on industrial starch, using cassava, oil palm 
products, and industrial salt.  He hopes the salt industry 
will serve as the basis for developing a chemicals industry 
in Ghana.  Kyerematen called it \"government engineering\" of 
the economy:  the GoG is helping to identify bottlenecks, 
organize farmers into cooperatives, and assisting SMEs to 
access technology, financing and professional management. 
 
10. (SBU) Despite the GoG\'s efforts, private sector 
investment, especially foreign direct investment, is growing 
slowly.  Kyerematen blamed this on collateral damage from 
regional instability, which makes it especially difficult to 
attract small and medium sized investment from the U.S. and 
Europe.  He asked the U.S. to help Ghana improve its image by 
promoting success stories.  Ambassador Yates reiterated a 
comment she has delivered before to Kyerematen that Ghana has 
a perception problem:  many investors believe it does not 
have a welcoming investment climate. (Comment: As usual, 
Kyerematen misunderstood the Ambassador\'s criticism of the 
investment environment.  Rather than accept this as an area 
the GoG should work on, he blamed the problem on investors\' 
lack of information on Ghana.  End Comment) 
 
11. (SBU) Kyerematen criticized donors for not really 
understanding or supporting the private sector, and mentioned 
that he has requested assistance from the U.S. Small Business 
Administration (SBA).  He said the SBA has agreed to visit 
Ghana to explore ways to provide assistance.  Taylor agreed 
that many donors are more focused on poverty alleviation, but 
pointed out that in addition to the MCA focus on growth, IDA 
funding can now be used to support the private sector, since 
SME lending was negotiated into IDA 13 (for the first time).

E.O. 12958:  N/A 
TAGS: PREF, PHUM, GH, refugees 
SUBJECT: PRM A/S DEWEY\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH OPE 
 
 
1.  Summary:  A/S Dewey and the Overseas Processing 
Entity (OPE) Representative and Staff held fruitful 
discussions during the recent trip by A/S Dewey to W. 
Africa.  Touching on issues related to 9/11, new 
caseloads, partner relations, efforts to meet the FY 04 
ceiling as well as the many benefits of WRAPS, Dewey was 
presented with a thorough debriefing of OPE operations 
in the region.  Positive words of appreciation and 
encouragement by A/S Dewey were well-received and 
bolstered team efforts to move another 3,000 refugees by 
October 1.  End Summary. 
 
2. During a representational dinner, OPE Director 
Frances Tinsley and A/S Dewey discussed a myriad of 
issues related to OPE processing in the region.  The 
two focused on three general areas of concern: 1) USRP 
progress made since 9/11 on moving cases out of West 
Africa, 2) the need for new caseloads and 3) partner 
relations.  All three points were of keen interest to 
the Assistant Secretary and are detailed below. 
 
3.  9/11 - Getting over the Hurdles.  Due to the hiatus 
in processing following the events of 9/11, numerous 
hurdles arose as the Department struggled to address 
security concerns related to the refugee program. 
Tinsley emphasized that in the last year, the process 
had picked up great speed as many 9/11 related policies 
had been ironed out.  The eventual normalization of the 
RAVU process between Washington DHS, OPE and RPC was 
welcomed recently by all and proved instrumental in 
resolving the fate of thousands of refugees in limbo. 
While the movement on RAVU policy assisted in breaking 
the logjam, partner efforts were redoubled to address 
those cases that had been stuck at various stages 
throughout the year. Underscoring the importance and 
success of the individual trouble-shooting partner 
meetings, the myriad of concerns have eventually 
ameliorated.  Partners continue to convene weekly to 
scrutinize SOPs and dislodge cases through meetings on 
IOM/OPE data reconciliation, cases that fall through 
the cracks, displaced refugees from Ivory Coast and DHS 
policy issue and practical processing meetings. 
 
4.  The Need for New Caseloads - Our Pipeline Runs Dry. 
Tinsley mentioned the increased competition for cases 
in West Africa by other refugee resettlement countries. 
The number of missions now based in Ghana, competing 
for the same caseloads as the US Government include the 
British and Canadians with the Australians preparing to 
establish a presence next year.  In identifying new 
group referrals, Tinsley urged A/S Dewey to push for 
more initial involvement with OPE in order to avoid the 
numerous problems associated with the Abidjan 
operation.  A/S Dewey mentioned the need to move 
processing more towards a \"rescue mission\" as opposed 
to bigger P-2 programs of the past.  Noting there is 
now a more urgent need to have OPE process quickly in 
designated places, Tinsley assured A/S Dewey that OPE 
was up to the task, as evidenced by its recent trip to 
the North of Ghana to pre-screen 400 Sierra Leoneans 
from Krisan camp.  Tinsley made a pitch to allow OPE to 
process Visas 93s in the region as opposed to Accra 
only. (Comment: This proposal was presented by Refcoord 
to PRM and DHS last year and while plausible to PRM, 
appeared a non-starter with DHS Rome and Washington. 
End comment). 
 
5) Partner Relations - A Tone of Collaboration. 
Expressing appreciation for Refcoord\'s past efforts, 
Tinsley emphasized the need for continuity upon the 
appointment of the new refcoord.  Outlining the 
accomplishments of the current refcoord, Tinsley kindly 
attributed the tone for the partner\'s collaboration to 
Nadeau.  Specifically, Tinsley outlined partner efforts 
to find unlocatable cases (many lost during the Ivorian 
civil disturbances) throughout the region that had been 
sitting for months and sometimes years.  While these 
numbers do not represent a significant number of cases, 
the effort to locate and process from a wide variety of 
locations enforced partners\' needs to work 
collaboratively to move difficult caseloads. 
Discussing how OPE has become the \"clearing house\" for 
data exchange with the partner\'s given the advent of 
WRAPS and the thoroughness of OPE pre/post 
efforts, this exchange has encouraged a collegial 
approach to processing by all partners. 
 
6) A/S Dewey toured OPE viewing every corner of the 
operation and providing strong words of encouragement 
to staff along the way.  In a general meeting with 
senior staff, a question and answer session ensued with 
thoughtful discussion on the need to have written 
guidance from Washington in a timely manner, the 
possibility of resettling Sudanese refugees and the 
overall efforts made to increase departures to meet the 
fiscal year ceiling of 8,500.  The OPE team whole- 
heartedly supported the RPC and WRAPS, saying it 
simplifies their work efforts tremendously.  Dewey 
received the new positively stating he was pleased to 
see the team embrace WRAPS. The meeting ended with a 
mutual note of appreciation from OPE staff for the 
Assistant Secretary\'s visit. 
7.  Comment.  Tinsley and OPE staff were clearly 
pleased and appreciative of the A/S\'s visit, mentioning 
at numerous occasions the impact his encouraging words 
had on staff.  While the pressure has been on West 
Africa to bring in numbers, the hurdles presented have 
been met at every stage by OPE staff who have worked 
tirelessly to overcome them.  This was an opportune 
time to illustrate those efforts to the Assistant 
Secretary.  End comment.

E.O. 12958:  N/A 
TAGS: PREF, PHUM, GH 
SUBJECT: PRM A/S DEWEY\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH IOM - \"HOLDING 
THE PROGRAM IN YOUR HANDS ON A DAILY BASIS\" 
 
 
1.  Summary:  A/S Dewey and the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) Chief of Mission held 
fruitful discussions during the recent trip by A/S Dewey 
to W. Africa.  Touching on issues related to security, 
fiscal management and panel physician concerns in the 
region, Dewey was presented with a debriefing of IOM\'s 
role as PRM\'s \"go to\" partner for difficult support 
operations in the region.  End Summary. 
 
2. During a representational dinner and private 
luncheon with IOM COM Antonio Polosa, A/S Dewey was 
briefed on the extensive support that IOM has provided 
to the USRP in the region over the past three years. 
The two focused on three general areas of concern: 1) 
the expanded role of IOM as a result of 9/11, 2) the 
cognizance of fiscal responsibility as sound program 
performance and 3) medical delays and the role of panel 
physicians. 
 
3.  Expanded Role of IOM - Our \"go to\" Partner.  Polosa 
outlined the dramatic increase in IOM responsibilities 
since the events of 9/11.  As a result of ensuing 
security concerns associated with the event, DHS ceased 
interviewing in refugee camps in W. Africa.  The USRP 
then had to bring the caseloads to DHS, which often 
involved bringing thousands of refugees from remote 
areas in the bush to capital cities.  While the 
logistics were challenging enough for IOM, a need to 
have IOM bear the burden of providing infrastructure to 
OPE and DHS during interviews emerged as a top 
priority.  As no other entity could enter into 
fiduciary contracts with vendors outside of Ghana, IOM 
was tapped by PRM to provide everything from building 
leases, to copiers to car rentals. In addition to this 
physical support, IOM routinely stepped in to take up 
the slack of UNHCR efforts in areas where staff was 
limited or where there was no presence whatsoever. 
This support included, but wasn\'t limited to, posting 
notifications for refugees, providing expediting 
services at airports for OPE staff and completing odds 
and ends like photographing refugees.  (Comment: While 
not mentioned in the discussion, it should also be 
noted that IOM has been the entity assigned to conduct 
fingerprinting of all refugees determined in need by 
PRM.  End Comment). 
 
4.  Fiscal Responsibility - Understanding Funding 
Limitations.  A/S Dewey and Polosa discussed the 
current low level of funding in which the admissions 
program finds itself.  Polosa acknowledged PRM\'s 
concerns noting it was well understood within the ranks 
of IOM.  Committed to sound program performance, Polosa 
stated that IOM/Accra was cognizant of ensuring fiscal 
responsibility went hand in hand with project 
development. 
 
5.  Medical Delays - Panel Physicians Still Cause 
Problems.  A/S Dewey queried Polosa about the role IOM 
plays regarding the medical examinations in the region. 
Explaining the support role to panel physicians, the 
conversation eventually turned to the continuing 
problems faced with some panel physicians in the 
region.  Refcoord provided a few glaring examples of 
instances where refugees were delayed for years due to 
panel physician slowness or ineptitude.  Polosa 
reinforced that if the medicals did not come in from 
the panel physicians, then the refugees could not move. 
Refcoord discussed some creative ways the field had 
gotten around problem physicians, noting \"facilitated\" 
exams by IOM doctors sent to posts to \"assist\" panel 
physicians, sending cables to posts encouraging face-to- 
face discussions on poor performance.  Noting that IOM 
was tapped to provide the medical services in Abidjan 
for the recent operation, Refcoord remarked that the 
decision to utilize IOM was not only to benefit the 
very strict timeline, but also because our experience 
with the Abidjan panel physicians were so poor in the 
past that we couldn\'t risk having them jeopardize the 
operation.  Further describing dramatic cost 
discrepancies between fees for the Canadians vs. the 
Americans, Refcoord noted that this was an additional 
issue that needed attention.  For example, in Banjul 
the panel physician charges the USG at least 3 times 
the rate of the same exam for the Canadians. 
 
6.  \"Holding The Program in Your Hands on a Daily 
Basis\".  To summarize the issues, Polosa noted that 
there were so many permutations to the operation that 
one had to hold the program in his hands on a daily 
basis.  A/S Dewey appreciated the comment, carrying it 
through to other meetings throughout the trip.  Voicing 
strong appreciation for IOM efforts, the Assistant 
Secretary yet again provided heartfelt encouragement to 
 
SIPDIS 
the daily efforts of a valued USRP team member.

1. On Wednesday, June 9, PolOff delivered reftel demarche to 
the Director of International Organizations in the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, John Kuleke, regarding Ghana\'s commitment 
to fulfill its national implementation obligations under 
Article VII of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). PolOff 
underscored USG concern that the GoG has not yet enacted 
implementing legislation in accordance with Article VII. 
 
2. Kuleke replied that Ghana viewed such legislation as \"very 
important and pressing\". Toward that end, he has written the 
Ministries of Finance, Environment and Science, and Defense, 
as well as the Attorney General, to request their assistance 
in moving forward on this legislation. Kuleke also said that 
these ministries would be interested to know what form the 
promised \"technical assistance\" from the US would entail. 
 
3. Comment. While Mission does not doubt Kuleke\'s sincerity, 
domestic priorities are likely to take precedence over CWC 
legislation. For the remainder of this year\'s legislative 
calendar, there are many important and some contentious 
pieces of legislation pending before Parliament, including a 
planned FOIA Act, Whistle Blower\'s Act, Disability Act, 
Foreign Entry Act, Long Term Savings Act, Domestic Violence 
Act, and Trafficking-in-Persons Act. End Comment.

Classified By: EconChief Chris Landberg for Reasons 1.5 (B and D) 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (C) Post expects that the economic impact of ending the 
AGOA third country fabric provision (Ref A) would be limited, 
given Ghana\'s (and the region\'s) minor apparel exports under 
AGOA, However, the textile and apparel sector in Ghana (and 
the region) would be devastated, so individual companies and 
workers would suffer.  It would also have a political impact, 
with the U.S. losing some leverage on bilateral and 
multilateral trade issues.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Econ, Commercial, USAID-Ghana and USAID-West Africa 
Regional Program (WARP) officers consulted internally and 
with the GoG and private sector to gauge the economic and 
political impact that failure to extend the AGOA third 
country fabric provision could have on Ghana and the region. 
The consensus is that in both Ghana and other countries in 
the region AGOA is as much a political phenomenon as it is an 
economic program.  Therefore, while there would not be a 
significant economic impact, there would be negative 
political repercussions. 
 
Economic Impact in Ghana 
------------------------ 
3. (C) The Trade Ministry argues that failure to extend the 
third country textile provision would destroy the GoG\'s 
efforts to encourage investment in the sector.  Existing 
companies are also worried.  An Indian firm in Ghana told 
USAID that without access to third country fabric it would 
shut down and lay off 300 workers.  This would probably 
repeat throughout the sector, and the GoG would not welcome 
such job losses so close to the December election. 
 
4. (C) GoG officials\' public comments have led the Ghanaian 
public to believe that AGOA itself, not the third country 
textile provisions, will end September 30.  Post has 
clarified this point to the GoG and press.  Apparel make up 
about ten percent of total exports under AGOA/GSP, but the 
GoG sees it the area with the most possibilities for export 
growth.  Therefore, eliminating opportunities in the sector 
would create the perception in both government and the 
general public that the main benefits under AGOA had ceased. 
 
Bilateral and Multilateral Impact -- Ghana 
------------------------------------------ 
5. (C) The GoG has enacted a Presidential Special Initiative 
(PSI) on textiles and apparel.  Post has previously reported 
on the lack of focus of PSIs and our concerns about the GoG\'s 
ability to \"pick winners\" (Refs B and C). By not extending 
the third country textile provision, the GoG would be able to 
blame the U.S. for both the failure of the Textile/Apparel 
PSI and its inability to deliver on promises of over 100,000 
jobs and increased investment. 
 
6. (C) Reducing Ghana\'s benefits under AGOA would also 
undermine the USG\'s efforts to influence the GoG to maintain 
open-market oriented policies.   The GoG is developing a 
\"National Trade Policy,\" with USAID and other donor help, and 
GoG officials are facing increasing pressure to protect local 
industry.  For example, the Trade Ministry acquiesced to 
demands from Ghanaian poultry companies and limited licenses 
for large scale poultry imports from the U.S. (Ref D).  The 
GoG will be even less disposed to resist protectionist 
demands and ensure the National Trade Policy has a free 
market focus if it loses preferential access into the U.S. 
market. 
 
7. (C) As USTR has highlighted, Ghana was one of the few 
developing countries to play a positive role during the 
Cancun meetings.  Reducing or even eliminating Ghana\'s 
limited gains on increased investment and exports to the U.S. 
would make the GoG less inclined to cooperate on WTO issues 
and would leave it more focused on agriculture as the main 
sector with export growth potential. 
 
Regional Impact 
--------------- 
8. (C) USAID-WARP officers note that approximately 75 percent 
of sub-Saharan African apparel exports under AGOA use third 
country fabric.  There are few viable alternatives:  U.S. 
fabric is 20 to 40 percent more expensive, primary textiles 
produced in sub-Saharan Africa are generally low quality and 
produced in insufficient quantities.  Even textiles from the 
predominant African producer, South Africa, are cost 
prohibitive because of the strong Rand.  Without a prolonged 
phase-out period, apparel firms in West Africa would not have 
the opportunity to build linkages with other AGOA countries 
and invest in local textile production to lower dependence on 
mostly Asian fabric.  Again, while Post believes the regional 
economic impact would be limited because total sales are 
relatively low, the change would effectively cut regional 
apparel firms out of the U.S. market.  Whatever limited 
success AGOA has had in West Africa -- mainly in the apparel 
sector -- will end. 
 
Comment 
------- 
9. (C) The U.S. uses AGOA to prove to African governments 
that we are interested in their economic development.  The 
GoG and other governments in the region have two central 
areas of interest with regards to trade:  apparel and 
agriculture.  Aside from the GoG and other countries\' 
negative reaction to eliminating the third country fabric 
provision, it would encourage them to focus even more on 
agricultural issues in bilateral and multilateral discussions. 
 
10. (C) This sector may disappear anyway, with or without 
AGOA III.  The fierce global competition that will ensue 
following the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Agreement will 
likely put an end to most of the inefficient, local textile 
and apparel producers, with the possible exception of turnkey 
operations (using U.S. cloth).  In this case, however, 
company failures and job losses would not be blamed on a 
change in U.S. Government policies.  End Comment

SUBJECT: VIOLENT ROBBERY OF AMCIT WITH STUDENT GROUP IN 
GHANA 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. Begin summary. A group of 6 students and their staff 
leader from the University of Maryland were \"welcomed\" on 
their first night in Ghana by the appearance of a thief armed 
with a machete at the door of the trip chaperone\'s room at 
university accommodations. The man stole several items from 
the trip leader\'s room and slightly injured her before 
fleeing. The student group did not utilize regular foreign 
student accommodations, which have better security. The 
Embassy and its counterparts at the University of Ghana-Legon 
will continue its coordination to increase security measures 
for visiting American scholars and students. End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
VIOLENT ROBBERY: A COLD WELCOME TO GHANA FOR VISITING STUDENTS 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
2. At 23:57 on Friday, June 4, the Embassy duty officer was 
contacted via Post One by AmCit Kelly Mack, who informed the 
officer that she was the victim of a robbery at the 
University of Ghana-Legon. Ms. Mack stated that she and a 
group of students (whom she was supervising on a trip to 
Ghana) had just arrived in country June 4. She was settling 
into her room at the university \"guest house\" (hotel-style 
lodging on the university\'s campus) when someone claiming to 
be with \"guest services\" knocked at her door. When she opened 
the door, a man wielding a machete forced his way into her 
room, stealing her bag with her passport, cash, traveler\'s 
checks, and credit cards inside. In recounting the details to 
the duty officer, Ms. Mack stated that she was \"cut in the 
scuffle\" but not seriously injured and did not require 
medical attention. 
 
3. The duty officer, RSO, and local law enforcement officials 
worked with the student group from June 4-8 to assist with 
filing a police report, replacing the stolen passport, and 
assessing the circumstances surrounding the robbery. 
 
4. Ms. Mack had originally intended to stay in Ghana for two 
weeks, and the students were planning to stay for two months 
to work with the Nogochi Minority International Research 
Training Program. As of the night of June 5, the group\'s 
plans were changing; Ms. Mack stated that she intended to 
leave Ghana as soon as her passport was replaced, and 
according to Ms. Mack, four of the students intended to leave 
with her while two students wanted to stay. Ms. Mack noted 
that the students\' plans were \"changing by the hour\". By COB 
on June 7, the Embassy was informed that the University of 
Maryland was ordering the entire group to return to the 
United States on June 8 once Ms. Mack\'s passport was replaced. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
SECURITY FOR UNIVERSITY VISITORS: WHAT\'S BEING DONE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
5. On June 7, after being assisted by Post\'s ACS section to 
replace her passport, Ms. Mack met with the RSO to discuss 
the nature of the incident. Ms. Mack confirmed that the 
University of Maryland had not notified the Embassy of this 
group\'s trip to Ghana. As such, RSO and PAS had no 
opportunity to advise the arriving students on security 
matters. The RSO told Ms. Mack that, in the future, the 
University of Maryland should inform the PAS of individual 
students or groups who are coming to study in Ghana so that 
Post can assist them in finding the most secure accommodation 
options possible. Ms. Mack replied that she would take this 
message back to her university. Additionally, PAS and RSO are 
updating the Embassy website to explicitly advise student 
groups intending to come to Ghana to register with the 
Embassy and receive a security briefing on arrival. 
 
6. There have been past incidents involving the security of 
American students studying and Fulbrighters at the University 
of Ghana-Legon. In the past year, RSO and PAS have worked 
closely with university officials to heighten the security 
standards for visiting American students, observing that they 
are naturally at greater risk for thefts and other petty 
crimes in this context. Since these discussions took place in 
October 2003, one dormitory has been designated as a 
higher-security facility for international students and no 
incidents had occurred until June 4. This was not the place 
at which the group visiting from the University of Maryland 
stayed on June 4. The \"guest house\" at which the group 
visiting from the University of Maryland stayed on June 4 is 
just a regular facility for Ghanaian students. 
 
7. Another weakness lies within the university\'s 
communication network. According to university officials 
charged with the responsibility for international students, 
the institute hosting the University of Maryland group - 
coordinated by Ghanaian Professor Mike Wilson - did not 
notify these officials about the group\'s plans. If Professor 
Wilson had notified the appropriate officials, he would have 
been advised about the more secure international student 
dorm. Embassy personnel have urged improved communication 
among university staff regarding the arrival of international 
visitors and groups. 
 
8. Ambassador Yates tried June 9-11 to meet with the 
Vice-Chancellor of the university to discuss the issue of 
student security and to engage the university at the highest 
possible level to underscore the importance of this issue, 
but he was out of town. Instead, the RSO consulted with the 
Dean of International Students on June 11 to assess security 
at campus accommodations. The Ambassador will continue to 
pursue a meeting with the Vice-Chancellor. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
9. The group of students and their staff leader were quite 
traumatized by the incident. Better planning by University of 
Maryland staff prior to arrival, and better procedures for 
ensuring all foreign students are channeled to the foreign 
student dorm, might have averted the incident. Post will 
continue to encourage the University of Ghana to provide a 
secure environment for American students and will redouble 
efforts to ensure that students receive a realistic 
assessment of security concerns before arriving in Ghana. End 
comment.

SUBJECT: PRM A/S DEWEY\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH UNHCR AND 
AMBASSADOR ON REGIONAL AND LOCAL RESETTLEMENT ISSUES 
 
 
Classified By: Refugee Coordinator Carla T. Nadeau for Reasons 1.5 b 
 
1. Summary:  PRM A/S Gene Dewey met with UNHCR branch office 
and regional resettlement personnel while in Ghana on a 
mission to review resettlement operations.  Duly impressed by 
the efforts of the Accra branch office as illustrated through 
two camp visits, Dewey came away with a sound appreciation 
for the commitment and successes of staff to address both the 
assistance and resettlement needs of the thousands of 
refugees in Ghana.  On regional resettlement issues, Dewey 
learned of the slippage in policy agreement between the UNHCR 
Africa Bureau and Resettlement Bureau.  The removal of Thomas 
Albrecht from the helm of the regional resettlement hub has 
resulted in lost momentum with region-wide efforts as the 
knowledge and charisma necessary to keep BOs invested in 
resettlement as a tool of protection.  Noting that the USRP 
could ill afford letting slippage by UNHCR stand in the way 
of a successful resettlement program, Dewey came away 
energized that an intervention by PRM might prove helpful in 
setting UNHCR back on track.  In an out-brief discussion with 
Ambassador Yates, the Assistant Secretary and PRM were hailed 
for the good choice of setting up the Refcoord position at 
post and mutual appreciation for support of refcoord regional 
responsibilities were provided.  End summary. 
 
KRISAN REFUGEE SETTLEMENT -- A MIXED GROUP OF ENTHUSIASTIC 
REFUGEES 
 
2.  Bureau of Populations, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) 
Assistant Secretary Gene Dewey completed a mission to Ghana 
to review resettlement efforts as they related to specific 
resettlement from Ghana through the branch office (BO) and 
broader, regional efforts as spearheaded by the Accra 
regional resettlement hub.  Dewey began his review with a 
visit to Krisan Refugee Settlement in the East of Ghana some 
60 kilometers from the Ivoirian border. The settlement of 
some 2,000 refugees hosts a myriad of nationalities including 
Liberians, Togolese, Sierra Leoneans, and Congolese. The 
settlement, far more remote than Budumburam houses a 
population that is more reliant on formal assistance programs 
including food distribution. Met by BO Representative Thomas 
Albrecht and escorted by the refugee-based Neighborhood Watch 
Patrol, Dewey was provided a tour of the facilities including 
a wood working shop, the Right to Play compound, the medical 
unit, library, child care center and the women\'s organization 
tye and dye shop.  At each stop the Assistant Secretary 
greeted refugees and asked thoughtful questions about their 
efforts in each project. Dewey repeatedly commented at the 
level of enthusiasm and sense of ownership among the refugees 
participating in the numerous operations. The tour concluded 
with a brief question and answer session with a few hundred 
refugees.  A/S Dewey provided remarks outlining his interest 
and concern for the refugees of Krisan.  Noting that he was 
greatly impressed with the efforts of refugees in the various 
projects, Dewey went on to note that their plight received 
the highest attention in Washington as he debriefed the 
Secretary of State regularly on refugee issues in West 
 
SIPDIS 
Africa.  Emphasizing that Secretary Powell would hear about 
the positive aspects of the refugees at Krisan, Dewey\'s 
comments were greeted with rousing cheers and applause. Most 
questions posed by refugees were prefaced with broad thanks 
for the A/S\'s visit and then turned to concern over their 
situation, including their long presence in Krisan and their 
need to be resettled. 
 
BUDUMBURAM REFUGEE SETTLEMENT -- A MODEL OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY 
 
3.  The Assistant Secretary also reviewed operations at the 
Budumburam Refugee Settlement 50 kilometers outside of Accra. 
 The settlement of some 43,000 refugees is comprised 
primarily of Liberian refugees who began arriving in Ghana in 
1990.  The population was initially estimated to be about 
12,000 by the former UNHCR BO rep, however the registration 
exercise conducted last year by Albrecht illustrates that the 
number is nearly quadruple the estimated figure.  Unlike 
Krisan, the settlement does not receive significant 
assistance from UNHCR but does benefit from smaller, more 
targeted responses to vulnerable sectors.  Albrecht has 
routinely pointed out that the large discrepancy in census 
accounting has damaged efforts to provide appropriate levels 
of assistance to the population.  A/S Dewey toured Budumburam 
stopping at points of interest along the way including 
classrooms funded by a special appropriation through PRM, a 
day care center and the newly expanded health clinic.  Also 
escorted by Neighborhood Watch staff, Dewey witnessed 
first-hand the ingenuity of the population which has had to 
exploit its own resources in order to survive.  Completing 
the tour with a press meeting, A/S Dewey answered a few 
questions from refugees concerned about the USG\'s delay in 
responding to Liberia\'s needs and what plans were in place to 
avoid future conflict in the region.  A/S Dewey, focused on 
themes of good governance and anti-corruption efforts when 
responding to concerns.  Numerous local media provided 
detailed stories of the event the following day. 
 
UNHCR W. AFRICAN RESETTLEMENT POLICY -- A NEED TO COMMUNICATE 
 
4.  In separate conversations with Representative Albrecht, 
A/S Dewey explored the policy direction of UNHCR\'s 
Resettlement and Africa bureaus.  Drawing from past, 
extensive experience as the Deputy High Commissioner for 
UNHCR, Dewey had an interactive and fruitful discussion with 
Albrecht on how to ensure resettlement efforts move forward 
within the sometimes bureaucratic entanglement of UNHCR. 
Looking at the policy issues from three points, Albrecht and 
the Assistant Secretary discussed 1) the core policy issues, 
2) the timing and approach for addressing concerns, and 3) 
the linked issues inherent in the policy concerns. 
 
5.  The Core Policy Issues: Voluntary Repatriation vs. 
Resettlement. Albrecht noted that a policy shift was 
underfoot at UNHCR as the concept of a comprehensive approach 
to durable solutions had been replaced with a competition 
between repatriation and resettlement.  Quoting numerous 
papers previously outlining how voluntary repatriation, 
reintegration and resettlement could work simultaneously to 
address the complex needs of refugees, Albrecht was saddened 
that the approach by UNHCR has moved to an \"either/or\" 
situation.  As evidenced by the recent Targeted Response Team 
(TRT) mission to Nzerekore, Guinea, there appears to be a 
schism between the Africa Bureau\'s policy on repatriation and 
the Resettlement Bureau\'s policy on resettlement.  (Note. 
Under the gun to get the Guinea group referral approved by 
the Africa Bureau, the resettlement section pushed PRM to 
commit to begin processing the group of some 2,500 Liberians 
prior to the onset of repatriation exercises slated to begin 
in October. End Note.)  Despite the High Commissioner\'s 
commitment to redouble efforts on resettlement, the current 
UNHCR policy for West Africa is once voluntary repatriation 
begins for Liberians in October, only exceptional individual 
cases will be referred for resettlement.  (Note: UNHCR\'s 2005 
Resettlement Needs Paper indicates some groups of Liberian 
may be referred for resettlement after the October deadline 
for repatriation.  When refcoord brought this up to Albrecht, 
he noted that it was unclear whether the paper, generated by 
the Resettlement Section had received clearance/endorsement 
from the Africa Bureau.  End Note.) 
 
6.  Timing and Approach to Address Schism.  Albrecht and the 
Assistant Secretary discussed possible approaches to address 
the policy concern and contemplated using the Annual 
Tripartite Consultation on Resettlement (ATC) in Geneva as a 
venue for discussion.  Having reviewed the agenda, both felt 
it was an opportune time to insert a series of discussions to 
address the concerns with the Department of International 
Protection (DIP), the Africa Bureau and the High 
Commissioner.  Noting that October was not far away, it was 
explored as to whether a workshop and/or further discussions 
with resettlement countries and NGOs would be fruitful if 
done this summer. (Note. It was later decided after 
consultations with PRM/Admissions that the better venue for 
this discussion would be with Refcoord consulting directly 
with UNHCR staff in Geneva at the end of July. End Note.) 
 
7.  Linked Issues -- Perceived UNHCR Effectiveness and 
Funding.  The Assistant Secretary emphasized the difficulty 
in defending UNHCR efforts to Congress when resettlement 
numbers remain so low.  A/S Dewey specifically outlined PRM\'s 
concerns over six positions in the region that were funded 
since January but still not completely filled.  Cognizant of 
the impression the situation gives, Albrecht acknowledged 
that poor performance and/or ineffectiveness of UNHCR has 
been an ongoing problem.  Because of this, Albrecht pressed 
that getting policy back on track immediately was imperative 
for the bigger funding picture. 
 
8.  Turning to the role of the resettlement hub, Refcoord 
underscored the role Albrecht had played in energizing BOs in 
the region.  Seeing a marked change from just two years ago, 
Refcoord viewed first-hand, his efforts to get reluctant 
representatives on board to consider resettlement for needy 
populations.  As evidenced by successful resettlement 
training conferences and enhanced missions to offices by hub 
staff, the recalcitrance of some West African offices finally 
seemed to be abating.  Unfortunately, earlier this year, 
UNHCR reorganized the resettlement structure worldwide 
forcing Albrecht to relinquish his role.  While the remaining 
hub staff currently working resettlement issues are competent 
and knowledgeable, they lack the institutional memory and 
necessary charisma of Albrecht who, respected by many, 
managed to diplomatically move efforts in the region forward. 
 In a politically pressured environment to move numbers and 
meet ceilings, Albrecht\'s removal, was a strong blow to the 
efforts to keep the regional hub relevant and provide 
consistency to a complicated program. 
 
MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR YATES -- MUTUAL APPRECIATION 
 
9.  In a meeting/debrief with Ambassador Mary Yates, A/S 
Dewey outlined the findings of his visit, emphasizing his 
clear appreciation for the efforts of resettlement partners 
in Accra.  Focusing on UNHCR, Dewey informed Ambassador that 
an intervention by PRM on regional resettlement policy 
concerns was in order. The Assistant Secretary noted that the 
USG could not afford to allow internal bureaucracy to derail 
our resettlement efforts. Lamenting the setback of removing 
Albrecht from his regional responsibilities, A/S Dewey 
queried the Ambassador on her views of his performance. 
Ambassador Yates emphatically described the impressive 
strides made by Albrecht and his team, agreeing that keeping 
the momentum alive was of paramount importance to the 
continuity of the program.  Voicing appreciation for PRM\'s 
decision to establish the Refcoord Office in Accra, 
Ambassador Yates thanked the Assistant Secretary for his 
visit and all the support PRM had provided to refugee 
resettlement operations in the region.  A/S Dewey in turn, 
thanked the Ambassador for her unwavering support of the 
Refcoord and her efforts in West Africa.

CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR ACQUAH 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) Under Secretary Taylor met May 31 with Bank of Ghana 
(BoG) Governor Paul Acquah to review the state of Ghana,s 
economy.  Acquah stated that the GoG is on course to meet IMF 
and World Bank conditions necessary to achieve HIPC 
Completion Point in July.  Acquah reiterated GoG support for 
the West African Monetary Zone, although Ghana is the only 
country close to meeting the convergence criteria.  The GoG 
also fully supports the West Africa Gas Pipeline, but Acquah 
noted there are outstanding issues to resolve.  End Summary 
 
Governor Acquah on Inflation and Monetary Policy 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
2. (SBU) Acquah commented that domestic debt is a major 
constraint on growth, and emphasized the importance of 
foreign financial support to help Ghana pay down its domestic 
debt and force down inflation and interest rates.  Taylor 
responded that the USG has encouraged the World Bank to 
increase its grant assistance.  Grants now total 21 percent 
of total World Bank assistance, and Taylor thought this could 
increase, especially for HIPC countries, thus easing their 
debt burden.  Acquah noted that Ghana must increase its 
investment ratio from the current 18 percent of GDP to above 
the 25 percent level common in the fastest growing developing 
countries. 
 
3. (SBU) Acquah commended robust fiscal policies and higher 
tax revenues for making it easier for the BoG to conduct 
disinflationary monetary policies.  He noted that market 
expectations are converging towards the 2004 target inflation 
rate of 7 to 8 percent, and said the BoG seemed to have 
succeeded in focusing markets on inflation and interest rates 
rather than on the exchange rate.  With annual inflation 
falling from 30 percent in April 2003 to 11 percent in May 
2004, the BoG was able to reduce its prime rate from 27.5 
percent to 18.5 percent, and is considering reducing it 
further. 
 
4. (SBU) In addition to tight monetary policy, Acquah stated 
there are three main reasons for declining inflation.  First, 
the fiscal pillar is increasingly robust, with the Finance 
Ministry committed to public expenditure management and 
controlling finances within the budget framework.  Acquah 
noted that the quality of expenditures has also increased, 
with more spending brought on budget and in-line with 
established priorities.  Second, GoG revenues have increased 
from 17 percent of GDP in 2001 in to almost 23 percent of GDP 
in 2004, almost doubling the amount collected.  This was due 
partially to higher growth but also to improved collection 
capacity.  Finally, by controlling expenditures and 
increasing revenues, the GoG reduced the budget deficit from 
roughly 9 percent of GDP in 2001 to an estimated 3.5 percent 
for 2004. 
 
Status of IMF/World Bank Agreements and HIPC 
-------------------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) Acquah stated that the GoG should be able to meet 
IMF and World Bank conditions in time for their Executive 
Boards to approve HIPC Completion Point in late June/early 
July.  The GoG will soon implement a health insurance levy in 
the form of a 2.5 percent VAT increase, and is also preparing 
an announcement that it will deregulate the petroleum sector 
starting Spring 2005.  (Note:  The GoG sent its draft Letter 
of Intent to the IMF on June 8 -- details reported septel. 
End Note) 
 
Acquah\'s Views on West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
6. (SBU) Acquah commented that there is strong political will 
in Ghana in support of the creation of a central bank and 
common currency (the \"Eco\") among the six ECOWAS nations not 
part of WAEMU (the CFA zone).  Acquah was pleased Ghana was 
chosen as the headquarters of the Central Bank, and considers 
it a great responsibility.  However, he was skeptical about 
prospects for meeting the mid-2005 deadline, pointing out 
that Ghana is the only country close to meeting the 
convergence criteria, and the health of the group -- and 
success of WAMZ -- depends on Nigeria getting its act 
together.  U/S Taylor agreed with Acquah\'s concerns about 
Nigeria\'s financial situation, since Nigeria\'s Central Bank 
is financing the GON deficit.  However, he also commented 
that Nigeria had made recent progress, for example it 
successfully brought official and private interest rates 
closer through its recently established Dutch Auction 
process. 
 
Acquah\'s Views on West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
7. (SBU) In response to U/S Taylor\'s expression of concern 
about the status of WAGP preparations, Acquah said the GoG 
consensus was that the pipeline would be good for Ghana, but 
there are outstanding issues related to costs and financing 
that must be resolved prior to the July 31 final investment 
decision date.  In particular, the GoG is reviewing options 
for financing the USD 80 million it needs to pay for its 16 
percent equity stake in the pipeline.  Acquah said he has 
wondered why the \"sponsors\" -- Chevron Texaco and Shell -- do 
not seem willing to borrow the money for Ghana, since they 
can do so internationally at low rates.  He added that issues 
such as the cost of the project and rate of return the 
operator will receive had not been resolved to GoG officials\' 
satisfaction.  Finally, he said a realistic market analysis 
was required before Ghana could agree to the take or pay 
arrangement.  The GoG is working with the other WAGP 
investors to mitigate risks via MIGA political risk 
insurance. 
 
Comment 
------- 
8. (SBU) U/S Taylor\'s separate meeting with Governor Acquah 
was important to show USG support for the BoG\'s management of 
monetary policy.  Acquah has played a critical role in 
developing the GoG\'s sound economic policies, which have 
resulted in a relatively strong and strengthening economy. 
He is often the lone voice of reason on economic policy, and 
is due credit for the courageous reforms he has spearheaded 
within the Bank of Ghana -- such as reducing the staff by 50 
percent and instituting a Monetary Policy Committee to ensure 
the BoG stays focused on achieving inflation targets.  End 
Comment.

COUNCIL MEETING 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. On June 4, President Kufuor presided over the fifth Ghana 
Investors Advisory Council (GIAC) meeting.  He highlighted 
recent, positive accomplishments, including MCA eligibility, 
and reassured the private sector that the GoG is committed to 
sound fiscal management during the 2004 election year. 
Private sector panelists spoke on priority areas for reform. 
End Summary 
 
Ghana Investors Advisory Council 
-------------------------------- 
2. President Kufuor and other high-level GoG officials met 
June 4-5 with the private sector for the 5th annual GIAC 
meeting.  The GoG invited the diplomatic community for the 
opening session.  The purpose of the GIAC is to give Ghanaian 
and international business leaders the opportunity to 
influence economic policy and propose reforms, and also to 
improve the GoG\'s understanding of the factors important to 
(and hindering) domestic and foreign investors in Ghana. 
 
Success Stories and Accomplishments 
----------------------------------- 
3. In his opening address, Kufuor highlighted positive 
accomplishments over the last eighteen months, including 
Ghana\'s inclusion among the 16 MCA-eligible countries, which 
he saw as an endorsement of the GoG\'s political and economic 
policies and reforms.  He highlighted the serious 
macroeconomic program, which has resulted in strong growth, 
falling inflation and interest rates, a stable currency, and 
record remittances of USD 1.5 billion in 2003 and USD 600 
million so far in 2004.  He predicted Ghana would reach HIPC 
Completion Point soon, bringing USD 3.7 billion in official 
debt forgiveness. 
 
4. Kufuor claimed that Fitch Rating Agency and Standard and 
Poor\'s positive sovereign credit ratings were confirmation of 
the GoG\'s prudent policies and Ghana\'s strong economic 
showing.  Kufuor also commended Ghana for being one of six 
African countries invited to the Sea Island G-8 meeting and 
for being the first African country to undergo the NEPAD peer 
review. 
 
5. On the business side, Kufuor emphasized high profile 
success stories:  1) the booming Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE), 
up 144 percent in 2003; 2) the Anglogold-Ashanti merger and 
its decision to list on the GSE; 3) Newmont Mining\'s half 
billion dollar planned investment; 4) the proposed 
Guinness-Ghana Breweries merger, which would create the 
biggest brewery in the region; 5) significant expansion plans 
of many banks and companies, including Unilever; 6) cocoa 
production expected to exceed 600,000 tons in 2004; and 7) 
the GoG\'s planned purchase of VALCO and its plans to develop 
an integrated aluminum industry.  Kufuor said the GoG would 
soon announce its private sector strategy and implementation 
plan, aimed at further improving the business climate. 
Kufuor ended proclaiming that all this activity would propel 
Ghana\'s economy to meet the GoG\'s medium-term target of USD 
1,000 per capita GDP. 
 
Caveat -- Oil Prices 
-------------------- 
6. Although Kufuor sought to reassure the private sector that 
the GoG was committed to staying within budget during this 
election year, he warned that the high world price of oil was 
a menace to society and could potentially undermine the GoG\'s 
gains over the last three years.  He reiterated his pledge 
not to increase the price of fuel at the pump this year, and 
stated that the GoG had reached agreement with developing 
partners (read:  IMF) to keep a lid on prices for the time 
being.  To pay for the increasing fuel subsidy, the GoG has 
cut costs and raised revenues from parastatal companies:  the 
Cocoa Board, the National Communications Agency (NCA), 
Divestiture Implementation Committee, and the Ports and 
Harbors Directorate. 
 
Private Sector Analysis of Priority Action Areas 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
7. Private sector representatives have divided into five 
working groups to focus on reforms related to land titling, 
financial sector, agriculture/agribusiness, labor, and 
customs and civil service.  Relevant GoG Ministries 
participate in the working groups.  Working Group chairs 
reported on progress made over the last year.  In most cases, 
the working groups are still in the recommendations phase. 
However, Ken Ofori-Atta, CEO of DATABANK and the Chair of the 
working group on financial sector reform, reported 
significant progress. 
 
8. Ken Ofori-Atta stated that the GoG was close to completing 
needed legislation related to the banking system, payment 
system, securities industry, money laundering, insurance 
industry, foreign exchange, and credit bureaus.  Plans for a 
venture capital fund are progressing, with partial funding 
from the GoG.  The Finance Ministry will soon put out a 
tender for private management.  Finance is also about to 
table to Parliament the Long Term Savings bill, which will 
establish programs similar to 401Ks, with the goal of 
increasing domestic savings. 
 
9. Three companies have expressed interest in establishing 
credit rating agencies, but the GoG needs to clarify 
legal/regulatory issues.  The IFC has also shown interest in 
this project, and also in a project to increase savings 
through the postal system.  The IFC (along with other donors) 
is also supporting three African pilot projects to promote 
SME financing -- SME Solution Centers -- one of which will be 
located in Ghana (Note:  the other two will be in Kenya and 
Madagascar.  End Note).  Ofori-Atta ended saying the goal was 
for Ghana to put in place the appropriate legal and 
regulatory structure and create the necessary incentives for 
Ghana to become a regional financial center, similar to 
Mauritius. 
 
Comment 
------- 
10. Both Ghanaian and international business reps seem 
satisfied with the level of importance President Kufuor is 
placing on this annual event.  This is the one time the 
private sector as a group gets to speak candidly and 
privately with Kufuor and his top Ministers, and it appears 
Kufuor is listening to their concerns and is intent on 
pursuing policies beneficial to the business sector.  As Ken 
Ofori-Atta stated during his presentation, with the sovereign 
credit ratings, MCA eligibility, HIPC Completion Point, and 
solid economic reform program, the private sector is feeling 
increasingly confident in the strength of Ghana\'s economy.  A 
new member of the advisors is Chris Kirubi, a Kenyan 
multi-millionaire who heads DHL and Coca Cola in Kenya.  He 
was exceptionally outspoken about including private business 
on more government trips and letting private business take 
the lead in the economy so free enterprise can triumph.  End

HIPC COMPLETION POINT

Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) The GoG submitted its Letter of Intent (LOI) to the 
IMF on June 8, in time for IMF Executive Board meeting to go 
forward as planned on June 30.  The GoG is working to fulfill 
prior actions: 1) impose a 2.5 percent VAT increase; 2) 
adjust water and electricity prices; and 3) complete wage 
negotiations.  The GoG will soon announce its intention to 
deregulate the petroleum sector starting February 15, 2005, 
which is a requirement for reaching HIPC Completion Point 
this July.  End Summary. 
 
Status of IFI Programs 
---------------------- 
2. (SBU) The GoG submitted its Letter of Intent to the IMF on 
June 8, just in time for IMF staff to get it ready for the 
IMF Executive Board meeting June 30.  Post obtained a copy 
from contacts at the Bank of Ghana (emailed to Treasury and 
EB/IFD/OMA).  Based on this draft and the results of the IMF 
and World Bank program reviews in May, both IMF and World 
Bank staffs are circulating documents to their Executive 
Directors related to their programs and HIPC.  According to 
World Bank-Ghana staff, the GoG has met all conditions for 
its Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC).  The GoG still 
has several outstanding prior conditions for the IMF Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and for the IMF Board to 
approve HIPC Completion Point. 
 
Completed Prior Actions 
----------------------- 
3. (SBU) The GoG has fulfilled the following prior actions: 
 
-- The GoG increased water tariffs 16 percent in April to 
reach cost-recovery levels.  Current electricity tariffs are 
appropriate, but both water and electricity prices must be 
reviewed in August and November 2004, and February 2005, and 
adjusted if necessary. 
 
-- The GoG completed wage negotiations to keep salaries in 
line with the 17 percent increase authorized in the 2004 
budget. 
 
-- On June 9, the GoG introduced a legislative instrument in 
Parliament to implement the National Health Insurance Levy. 
The levy automatically goes into effect 21 days after the 
legislative instrument is presented to Parliament, although 
the IMF has allowed the GoG to start charging it on August 1. 
 The levy -- equivalent to a 2.5 percent VAT increase -- 
should raise almost USD 45 million in new revenue. 
 
-- In June the Ministry of Finance imposed spending ceilings 
on ministries and departments. 
 
Pending Prior Actions 
--------------------- 
4. (SBU) The critical outstanding action is the GoG\'s 
agreement with the IMF to announce publicly that it will 
deregulate the petroleum sector to allow market forces to 
determine gas prices.  IMF staff insisted that the press 
release describe the key elements of the new regime and the 
time frame for implementation.  The GoG has prepared a draft 
press release announcing its intention to deregulate starting 
February 15, 2005.  After IMF staff sign off on the 
statement, the Information Ministry will issue it prior to 
the June 30 IMF board meeting.  (Comment:  According to IMF 
and GoG, this announcement should satisfy the final HIPC 
trigger, so should pave the way to achieving Completion 
Point.  End Comment) 
 
5. (SBU) The new regulatory/pricing regime will allow oil 
marketing companies to adjust prices (according to a formula) 
without prior GoG approval.  (Comment: Kufuor has refused to 
increase gas prices during the election year, choosing to 
subsidize the sector.  Higher world prices increased the 
monthly subsidy to USD 18.5 million in May.  The GoG agreed 
to contain the 2004 subsidy at 1.1 trillion cedis, or about 
USD 122 million.  If it exceeds this level the GoG must cut 
spending further.  Right now it is funding the subsidy by 
forcing payments from parastatals and raiding the debt 
recovery levy -- a 640 cedi per liter levy used to pay 
domestic debt.  End Comment). 
 
6. (SBU) It is unclear whether the GoG has satisfied IMF 
concerns regarding a USD 300 million loan, or \"supplier\'s 
credit,\" from a Hong Kong company.  The IMF initially 
demanded that Ghana prove the concessionality of this loan by 
providing evidence that the Chinese government is backing and 
guaranteeing it.  However, it is not mentioned in the draft 
LOI.  (Comment:  Finance Minister Osafo Maafo told Ambassador 
June 9 that the GoG had decided to back away from the loan in 
response to negative public reaction.  For this reason, the 
IMF and GoG may have agreed to leave it out of the LOI.  End 
Comment) 
 
Comment 
------- 
7. (SBU) President Kufuor has empowered Finance Minister 
Osafo Maafo to do whatever it takes to get to HIPC Completion 
Point.  The IMF has made this a much easier job by showing 
great flexibility on both PRGF and HIPC conditions.  We 
expect the GoG will manage to fulfill all prior actions, 
including the public announcement of petroleum deregulation, 
before the June 30 IMF Board meeting, so should achieve its 
goal of reaching Completion Point in July.  However, we 
suspect the 2005 implementation of petroleum deregulation 
will be problematic, especially without the HIPC leverage. 
There is even speculation at mid-levels in the Bank of Ghana 
and Ministry of Finance that the August implementation of the 
2.5 percent VAT increase could slip, due to the expected 
public outcry.  Nevertheless, this government has for the 
most part done a solid job of macroeconomic and structural 
reform, and so far seems to be holding its finances together 
during the election year.  Therefore, Post supports the 
IMF/World Bank position that Ghana meets the basic conditions 
for Completion Point.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE CORPORATION JUNE VISIT TO 
GHANA 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) officials met 
with GoG leaders, donors and Ghana\'s private sector, civil 
society and media during their June 6-9 visit.  Finance 
Minister Osafo Maafo reiterated Ghana\'s intention to use the 
Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) as a framework for 
the MCA compact.  Donors urged the MCC to provide direct 
budget support.  Private sector/civil society supported this 
strategy, but questioned the GoG\'s ability to draft, 
implement and monitor a sound proposal.  The Finance Minister 
wants Ghana to be one of the first to submit a quality 
proposal.  The MCC team agreed to clarify and supplement 
existing guidance on proposal preparation.  End Summary. 
 
MCC Team Lays out Framework 
--------------------------- 
2. (SBU) The MCC team of Drew Luten, Rod Norman and Delia 
Welsh made a three-day visit to Accra, Ghana, June 6-9. 
During multiple meetings with GoG officials, 
Parliamentarians, business leaders, civil society and other 
donors, they introduced the MCA, discussed its concepts, and 
clarified and expanded the guidance for preparing compacts. 
Team leader Drew Luten emphasized that Ghana must take 
ownership of the program and drive the process.  The proposal 
should not be a laundry list of ideas and should not include 
projects that other donors had rejected.  It must provide a 
strategic vision for how it plans to promote faster economic 
growth while at the same time reducing poverty, and explain 
how proposed projects support that vision.  The GoG should 
identify major constraints to growth, and present a plan for 
overcoming these constraints with the help of MCA funds.  The 
GoG must also justify why MCA is the appropriate source of 
funding.  Civil society buy-in and donor coordination are 
critical to the process, and must be reflected in the compact. 
 
3. (SBU) Luten said the GoG should use the MCC website 
guidance to coordinate and develop a proposal that includes 
the strategic vision, specific project proposals, 
implementation plan, plans for monitoring and evaluation and 
accountability, and clear and measurable results.  (Comment: 
The point is to force governments to come up with big impact 
projects that they and civil society believe will have the 
largest impact on the economy, short, medium or long term. 
End Comment) 
 
4. (SBU) The MCC team clarified that there is no deadline for 
proposals, and countries should err on the side of quality 
rather than early completion.  The MCC will move on the best 
proposals first and defer low-quality proposals that require 
extensive consultation.  Luten expects the MCC to receive the 
first proposals within a few months. 
 
Government Reaction and Perspectives 
------------------------------------ 
5. (SBU) Finance Minister Yaw Osafo Maafo lead the GoG side, 
which included Ministers of Trade, Private Sector 
Development, Health, Education, and Roads and Transport.  GoG 
officials said they understood the importance of civil 
society buy-in and donor coordination and were confident that 
they could handle it. Osafo Maafo reiterated earlier 
statements that the GoG would use the GPRS as a guide for 
selecting priority projects and developing a compact.  The 
GPRS is the existing \"strategic vision\" and already has 
society-wide endorsement.  It has principles similar to the 
MCA:  economic stability, growth and employment generation, 
human resource development, good governance, and help for the 
vulnerable and excluded. 
 
6. (SBU) The GPRS was completed over 20 months, during which 
a GoG team identified priorities with community input, 
drafted a policy framework with targets and a monitoring and 
evaluation plan, held national consultations on the draft 
document, and obtained Parliamentary approval of the final 
strategy.  The GPRS is reviewed annually at the National 
Economic Dialogue.  IMF, World Bank, and Multi-Donor Budget 
Support (MDBS) donors use it to guide their programs.  It 
provides the basis for developing the annual budget. 
 
7. (SBU) Osafo Maafo stated the current task is to identify 
specific priorities out of the broader GPRS priorities. 
There is no shortage of ideas.  The Health Minister called 
for assistance to doctors to alleviate the brain drain.  The 
Education Minister commented that most donors support primary 
education, but funding is needed for tertiary levels, 
particularly technical education.  Every ministry is 
promoting its own projects, and even Parliament is working on 
a proposal. 
 
8. (SBU) Osafo Maafo is a strong proponent of education as an 
engine of economic development, but also expressed support 
for using MCA funds to promote private sector development, an 
area neglected by donors focused on poverty reduction.  Trade 
Minister Alan Kyerematen supported this position, and plugged 
a venture capital fund and a Ghanaian Small Business 
Administration, both aimed to alleviate a major constraint to 
growth -- lack of access to capital. 
 
Consultation with Development Partners 
-------------------------------------- 
9. (SBU) IMF, World Bank, and MDBS donors supported using the 
GPRS as the framework and also argued for integrating MCA 
funding into the MDBS process and measuring broad outcomes 
not specific project results.  They claimed that the budget 
is the only instrument capable of absorbing large assistance 
inflows.  Luten downplayed the possibility of providing 
budget support, but promised close consultation with the 
donor community.  He also stressed that MCA money could be 
used to co-finance projects supported by other donors. 
 
10. (SBU) Donors praised the USG for developing an innovative 
assistance vehicle that promotes transparency and 
competition, but cautioned that human capacity issues in 
Ghana could impede implementation.  They also warned against 
overburdening the GoG, which already contends with numerous 
and overlapping donor initiatives -- e.g., MDBS, IMF, World 
Bank, NEPAD and the UN Millennium Development Goals. 
Finally, they commented that it took the World Bank and MDBS 
donors two years to agree on a reform program with the GoG, 
suggesting that the MCC timeline is ambitious. 
 
Meetings with Civil Society, Business and Town Hall 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
11. (SBU) The MCC team also participated in well-attended 
roundtables with business leaders and civil society.  GoG 
officials did not participate in these meetings so as not to 
hinder discussions.  Business and civil society reps 
supported the GoG strategy of using the GPRS as the basis for 
developing a compact, but were skeptical about the GoG\'s 
capacity to develop and implement a good proposal.  On June 
9, the GoG hosted its own private sector/civil society 
roundtable, with similar results. 
 
12. (SBU) Several civil society representatives questioned 
whether the GoG would engage other sectors in the MCA 
process, and expressed a preference for having the MCC play a 
more hands-on role.  They also questioned whether the GoG 
partnership with the MCC would be as one-sided or unequal as 
the World Bank/IMF relationships.  While business leaders 
fully supported the MCA\'s pro-growth orientation, civil 
society supported the GPRS focus on poverty alleviation, and 
raised concerns as to whether growth would be equitable. 
 
13. (SBU) In addition to the GPRS, representatives 
highlighted other public/private consultations, including the 
National Economic Dialogue and the GoG\'s engagement of the 
Private Enterprise Foundation and other private sector bodies 
on the national budget.  Other initiatives include NEPAD and 
the UN Millennium Development Goals and there had been little 
effort to link these to the GPRS.  (Note:  The Finance 
Minister has also commented that the GoG needs to do more to 
harmonize these initiatives.  End Note)  Many echoed donor 
calls to link the MCA to the MDBS. 
 
14. (SBU) The MCC team clarified that funding will go through 
the GoG, which must coordinate the drafting and submission of 
the compact.  (Note:  Some participants asked about local 
media allegations that country selections were linked to 
Article 98 and the International Criminal Court.  Luten 
clarified that Article 98 had no role in the MCA process, 
which is totally transparent and accessible via the website. 
End Note) 
 
15. (SBU) The MCC team also participated in an Embassy-wide 
town hall meeting on June 9 to explain the new assistance 
program to Embassy employees, especially FSNs.  Many local 
employees, especially senior USAID FSNs, raised similar 
concerns regarding funding mechanisms, GoG capacity, 
coordination with other donors, and inclusion of civil 
society. 
 
Next Steps 
---------- 
16. (SBU) The MCC team agreed to review the website guidance 
and supplement or clarify it where necessary -- to narrow the 
range of ambiguity.  They also agreed to consider whether to 
provide broad funding parameters, to give countries a better 
idea of what size projects they should pursue.  Luten told 
Emboffs that MCC staff would also consider providing guidance 
on what is expected in terms of a first draft.  They do not 
want governments to develop detailed proposals that are 
totally off the mark.  Rather, they may first ask governments 
to present something of a scope paper -- more than an 
outline, but less than a proposal. 
 
17. (SBU) Osafo Maafo agreed to identify the key GoG points 
of contact for MCA matters.  While he seemed to understand 
the MCC directive on quality, his clear objective is to be 
one of the first in the queue.  He stated that it was \"clear 
in his mind\" that the GoG proposal should include a 
combination of projects in different sectors.  (Comment: 
Finance Ministry officials reassured Econoffs that Osafo 
Maafo realizes his job is to carefully vet all internal 
proposals and pick the few, high-impact ones that fit within 
the pared down GPRS strategic vision.  End Comment) 
 
Comment 
------- 
18. (SBU) There are many critical questions outstanding, 
including how the funding mechanisms will work, how to ensure 
the governments provide quality proposals with adequate 
societal consultation, and what role, if any, Embassies 
should or can play.  The MCC team clarified that they do not 
expect Embassies to avoid the normal contact and interaction 
with government officials, and said they understood that MCA 
would come up in our conversations.  However, Emboffs should 
restrain from discussing specific proposals and giving 
technical advice.  This limitation does not apply to other 
donors, and Post is aware that mid-level World Bank and GoG 
officials have informally discussed the prospect of using MCA 
money to fund the GoG\'s equity stake in the West Africa Gas 
Pipeline. 
 
19. (SBU) Despite uncertainties and civil societies concerns 
about capacity, the GoG is in relatively good shape to 
develop a decent proposal, or at least a first draft.  The 
GPRS provides a good framework and has broad support. 
Finance Minister Osafo Maafo is one of the strongest 
ministers and is personally overseeing the project 
development process.  Finally, Ghana has the advantage of the 
MDBS process, which has created sophisticated harmonization 
and communication among donors and with the GoG.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: GHANA: BRAIN DRAIN IN HEALTH CARE TAKING ITS TOLL 
 
 
 1. Ghana,s shortage of medical personnel is impacting 
patient care, burdening the economy and threatening to 
cripple the health care system. Ghana graduates 150 doctors 
and 600 nurses per year, but loses an average of 72 doctors 
and 216 nurses a year to migration, according to the WHO; 
other statistics show the losses are much higher.  The 
&brain drain8 is also a factor in education and the 
military, but in light of the investment that international 
donors have made to Ghana,s health sector and the more 
immediate impact of insufficient medical staff, this report 
will focus on the health care sector. 
 
The extent of the problem 
------------------------- 
2. GOG statistics indicate that 31 percent of health 
professionals trained in Ghana between 1993 and 2002 have 
left--an exodus of 3,100 people, including 600 doctors. 
Ghana,s nurse shortage is also severe; MOH estimates the 
number has dropped from 15,000 to 11,000 since the late 
1980,s. 
 
3. The brain drain is not a new phenomenon in developing 
countries, including Ghana. However, the pace in Ghana has 
quickened. The Human Resources Director for the Ghana Health 
Service (GHS), Dr. Ken Sagoe, says Ghana was losing about 
half of each year,s graduating doctors within 5 years of 
graduation in 1980. The incidence has risen to two thirds of 
each class leaving within two years, he reports. 
 
4. Ghana produced 2000-3000 doctors since 1969, yet has about 
the same number of doctors now--1600, including foreign 
doctors--as it did then. Accordingly, the doctor to 
population ratio has worsened, while World Bank data show 
this contrasts Niger, Malawi, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso where 
the ratio improved substantially as the number of doctors 
kept up with population growth. 
 
5. The ratio is most alarming in Ghana,s less developed 
northern regions where there is one doctor for every 66,000 
people. In October 2003, the Ghana Medical Association (GMA) 
reported that in the northern two thirds of Ghana, there were 
5 dentists, 3 surgeons, one obstetrician, and no 
pediatricians. Dr. Sagoe reports that northern medical 
centers experience staffing shortages of 70 percent, compared 
to 50 percent in Accra. MOH estimates suggest that by 2006, 
Ghana will face shortfalls of 1800 doctors, 6700 nurses, 6600 
midwives and 1400 pharmacists. 
 
6. The burden on Ghana,s health care system will worsen. 
Ghana recently launched a National Health Insurance Scheme 
(NHIS), which will offer free and subsidized health care to 
expand coverage. Dr. Adu-Gyamfi, GMA President, says that 
now, about 30 percent of people who should seek hospital 
treatment do, and the NHIS could cause this number to double. 
Dr. Sagoe reports that other developing countries that 
instituted similar schemes show a three to fourfold jump in 
the use of health facilities. NHIS is expected to cost Ghana 
USD 13 million annually, according to the MOH. The GOG plans 
to finance the scheme by raising the VAT by 2.5 percent. 
 
Why are they leaving? 
--------------------- 
7. Poor remuneration and working conditions, especially in 
the public sector, are a major deterrent for medical staff. 
The average doctor in Ghana earns about USD 250 per month, 
and a senior nurse earns about USD 150. There is little 
provision for a livable pension or retirement benefits. 
 
8. In 1999, Ghana (the GoG? MOH?)the GOG introduced an 
additional duty allowance scheme that allows doctors to earn 
USD 400-500 per month in overtime pay. Nurses are limited to 
USD 150 and perceive the discrepancy as unfair, providing 
another incentive to leave the system, says Dr. Sagoe. 
Allowances go only to clinicians; professors of non-clinical 
subjects or administrators are ineligible. The allowances 
also caused problems with the IMF. The Ministry of Finance 
reports that unbudgeted wage increases to health workers was 
a key factor preventing Ghana from meeting IMF targets in 
2002 and caused the World Bank and IMF to withhold USD 147 
million in funds. 
 
9. Ghana,s pay is low even with overtime. The Gambia 
reportedly pays doctors USD 1500-2000 per month, and Nigeria 
pays USD 1000-1200. Ghana hosted dozens of Nigerian doctors 
until 2000, according to Dr. Sagoe, when Nigeria increased 
salaries and 60 Nigerian doctors left Ghana for home. 
 
10. Doctors also emigrate because of Ghana,s limited career 
development opportunities. Doctors seek modern equipment and 
facilities and good post-graduate training opportunities to 
stay current, but Ghana,s health institutions face acute 
shortages of tools, equipment and instructors. Though Ghana 
inaugurated a Post Graduate College in 2003 to provide 
specialist training, Dr. Adu-Gyamfi says that it needs to be 
continually updated or else it will fail to attract people. 
There is even speculation that it could contribute to the 
problem if candidates seek specializations attractive in 
developed countries. 
 
11. Doctors are also deterred by delays in promotions and 
salary, inefficient bureaucracy, a rigid seniority system, 
and political and governance reasons. Nurses often go on 
study-leave abroad and do not return. It is particularly 
difficult for Ghana to entice people to serve in more remote 
areas where there is limited support, infrastructure, 
recreation, schools and services for families. 
 
Where are they going? 
--------------------- 
12. A 1999 study showed that nearly 55 percent of migrating 
medical personnel went to the UK, with 35 percent to the US 
and others to South Africa, Canada and Saudi Arabia. About 
1000 Ghanaian doctors live in the US, with 600 in New York 
alone. 
 
13. EU expansion and the likely migration of Eastern European 
doctors to the UK may give immigrating Ghanaian doctors 
competition. However, aging populations and domestic 
shortages will sustain developed country demands for health 
workers. A 2003 report by a Ghanaian consultant, &The Brain 
Drain and Retention of Health Professionals in Africa8 
conjectured that the UK could need 25,000 more doctors in 
2008 than in 1997. The UK,s Royal College of Nursing 
reported in 2003 that 42,000 nurses in the UK--1 in 12--were 
foreign. 
 
14. In April 2004, the UK and Ghana announced a protocol to 
stem the flow of Ghanaian nurses to the UK. Britain, 
recognizing the serious implications of Ghana,s nurse 
exodus, will seek surplus nurses first from Europe. The 
MOH,s Chief Nursing Office told Econoff that since, 
officially, there is no recruiting by the UK, it is not 
apparent how nurse migration might be prevented. 
 
Impact of the Exodus 
-------------------- 
15. Ghana is not harnessing its substantial investment in 
medical education. MOH 2002 estimates say brain drain costs, 
in terms of lost training costs and costs to hire foreign 
replacements, could be USD 9 million a year over the next few 
years. The costs from doctor emigration alone could be USD 4 
million. The brain drain also means lost contributions to GDP 
and taxes, the costs of illness aggravated by staff shortages 
and costs arising from substituting less qualified staff. 
 
16. The cost to support a Ghanaian medical student is about 
USD 10,000 per year for 6 years. Ghana formerly paid tuition 
for qualified Ghanaians, but in 1998 instituted a 
cost-sharing program where students pay 1.5 million cedis 
(USD 168) per year. Foreign students pay full tuition, and 
Ghanaians who do not qualify academically pay 24 million 
cedis (about USD 2700), but Ghana is still paying most costs 
for Ghanaians. 
 
17. Local media reports frequently on the repercussions of 
health worker shortages. In May 2004, the Tema General 
Hospital labor ward temporarily closed due to lack of 
doctors, forcing women in labor to trek 16 miles to Accra or 
to expensive private facilities. The Accra Psychiatric 
Hospital reports it has 3-4 nurses for 195 patients at any 
given time. In May 2003, the University of Ghana Medical 
School reported that it only had 10 lecturers--with most due 
for retirement within 6 years--instead of the minimum of 30. 
In January 2003, the new Brong-Ahafo regional hospital 
reported it was short 168 health workers out of a required 
workforce of 482. A June 2004 press report attributed poor 
rural health to the lack of health professionals in rural 
areas. 
 
18. With the escalating burden on medical staff, there is 
real concern about burnout, errors, increased staff absences 
and frustration, and reduced productivity. Dismal conditions 
and morale will compound the problem by encouraging early 
retirement or emigration. The head of the Ghana Registered 
Nurses Association (GRNA) fears that overworked nurses will 
cause poor patient care and a possible public outcry; closing 
health facilities may be the only way to avoid such 
confrontation. Faced with a daunting staffing imbalance, it 
is not at all clear that Ghana will be able to achieve its 
Millennium Development health goals of improving maternal 
health, reducing child mortality and combating disease. 
 
19. Since 1990, Ghana has employed Cuban doctors and 
currently hosts 188. Ghana pays each USD 100 per month, and 
likely pays an equal amount to the Cuban government, per Dr. 
Sagoe. Host hospitals add a monthly stipend of USD 50. The 
Cuban Medical Brigade reported in May 2004 that it had 
handled 3.6 million outpatient cases in the last two years in 
Ghana, in addition to 34,000 surgeries and 25,000 births. 
There is some concern about miscommunication since many of 
the Cuban doctors do not speak English. 
 
What Is Ghana Doing About Brain Drain 
------------------------------------- 
20. Ghana cannot compete with developed world salaries but 
needs to find a formula that will entice health workers to 
stay and serve, particularly in rural and deprived areas. Dr. 
Sagoe informally polled doctors and thinks the MOH could 
attract them with a salary of USD 1,000-2,000 per month. But 
Ghanaians also want long-term financial security, something 
that Ghana is only approaching on a piecemeal basis without 
an appealing comprehensive incentives package. 
21. Ghana,s struggle to offer incentives has been challenged 
by stalled negotiations, inefficiency, and lack of resources. 
GHS has been negotiating an appropriate pay structure for 2.5 
years. Car distribution programs--to aid doctors in remote 
areas--have misappropriated cars to non-doctors, GMA 
executives, and political supporters. In 2003, however, 40 
cars did go to deprived areas, and Dr. Sagoe believes that 
420 more will be distributed fairly. Current incentive 
packages (TV, housing, radios, bikes) to deprived area health 
workers cost USD 3.4 million per year. 
 
22. Doctors want the security of owning a home and have 
appealed to the GOG to facilitate home financing assistance. 
Dr. Sagoe told Econoff that the MOH had been in talks with a 
local bank, but current salaries cannot support long-term 
loans and talks collapsed. Dr. Adu-Gyampfi advocates creating 
a fund for housing, pensions, children,s education, or even 
a 10-year bonus, to tie doctors to Ghana. 
 
23. Another strategy to retain higher numbers is to train 
more people (although the potential downside is that more 
money is spent on more graduates who leave). MOH policy is to 
double the annual nurse graduates to 1200 per year, and GOG, 
aided by development partner funding, is expanding training 
centers, capacity. The Head of the GRNA suggests that 
developed countries that poach nurses should help fund 
efforts to increase the graduate pool. GHS is trying to 
increase the doctor pool with a program to guide outstanding 
medical assistants to medical school. The University of Ghana 
Medical School announced in May 2004 that it would increase 
its admission next year from 111 to 135 students to try to 
meet Ghana,s demand for doctors. 
 
24. Though Ghana pays the bulk of medical school costs, it 
has no enforceable mechanism to compel doctors to repay with 
service. After one year of postgraduate training, required 
for registration as a doctor, there is little to hold doctors 
in Ghana. Dr. Sagoe told Econoff that 30 years ago there was 
an unwritten obligation for new doctors to serve 5 years, but 
that is not the case today, and many doctors feel little 
sense of duty. Dr. Adu-Gyampfi said it is easy to skip out on 
any bonding agreement or to simply pay the fine. Generally, 
Ghana can only appeal to patriotism in an effort to encourage 
doctors and nurses to stay. 
 
25. Government efforts at least have been able to forestall 
strikes by health care workers. Dr. Sagoe says that strikes 
occurred every 3 months in the late 1980,s, and every six 
months in the mid 90,s. Since President Kufuor took power in 
2000, his government demonstrated a willingness to listen and 
act, and medical professionals are responding by giving him 
time to implement change. 
 
26. Drs. Sagoe and Adu-Gyampfi believe that using HIPC funds 
to offer higher salaries and incentives would be a boost for 
the efforts to retain doctors and nurses. World Bank and 
donor funds may not be used for salaries, however, but Dr. 
Sagoe maintains that without salary assistance, there may be 
no health system left to salvage in the long run. It is in 
the donors, interest to support Ghana,s efforts to retain 
its medical workforce, since donors have spent millions on 
health care and facilities in Ghana.  A critical factor in 
ensuring that these investments are sustainable is to 
guarantee that there will also be an adequate supply of 
trained health care professionals.

TAGS: ECON, EFIN, GH 
SUBJECT: GHANA: ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS - JUNE 2004 
 
 1. (U) This report covers noteworthy economic events and 
activities in Ghana for the period May 17 - June 25, 2004. 
The issues covered are: 
 
-- Westel/GoG Negotiations Nearing End 
-- Maryland State Trade Delegation 
-- Ghana Meeting on ECOWAS Common External Tariff 
-- Free Enterprise Marathon 
-- U.S. Inaugurates Economic Training for Media 
-- HIPC Debt Relief from France 
 
Westel/GoG Negotiations Nearing End 
----------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) Bill Taylor, the General Manager of Westel, a 
subsidiary of Western Wireless International (WWI), told Post 
that he will make one last try to reach an accord with the 
GoG that will allow Westel to stay in Ghana and avoid 
international arbitration.  The stumbling block is the GoG,s 
recent action to enforce the July 2002 decision to charge all 
mobile operators in Ghana for mobile spectrum, even though 
Westel contends it purchased spectrum as part of its original 
contract.  Westel now faces the prospect of paying USD 27.5 
million for mobile frequencies, on top of the USD 25 million 
fine it has tentatively agreed to pay over 7 years (Note: 
the fine was for failure to meet operating requirements). 
Therefore, Westel might have to pay USD 52.5 million just to 
stay in country. 
 
3. (SBU) WWI has been negotiating the sale of its Westel 
shares with several potential buyers, including South African 
mobile operator MTN.  However, MTN,s main interest is mobile 
operations in Ghana, so the new spectrum fee is a deal 
killer.  Taylor will meet a last time with GoG officials to 
try to work out a deal.  He stated that if he cannot convince 
the GoG to waive or drastically lower the spectrum fee, 
WWI,s plan to sell out of the market would be frustrated and 
its only remaining option would be to shut down and take the 
GoG to international arbitration. 
 
Maryland State Trade Delegation 
------------------------------- 
4. (U) Maryland,s Lt. Governor Michael Steele led more than 
40 public and private sector participants on a trade 
delegation to Ghana on June 17 and 18. The focus of the 
mission was to tap into commercial opportunities for Maryland 
companies created by continuing market liberalization efforts 
in Ghana and AGOA.  The group met with President Kufuor, the 
Minister of Roads and Transport, and the Minister of Trade 
and Industry. They also met with Ghana Airways officials, as 
Maryland is home to the troubled Accra-BWI route. The Embassy 
offered a country team briefing, and the Speaker of the 
Parliament hosted a working lunch for the Lt. Governor, the 
Ambassador and some delegates. 
 
Ghana Meeting on ECOWAS Common External Tariff 
--------------------------------------------- - 
5. (SBU) As part of the development of the ECOWAS Customs 
Union, slated for 2008, Ghana recently completed a report on 
the likely impact of an ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) 
on Ghana.  This report is also the forum to identify any 
temporary exemptions Ghana will request from the CET, such as 
preexisting bilateral free trade agreements or special export 
zones.  On June 22, The Ministry of Finance hosted a 
stakeholder workshop, attended by 20 government officials and 
one industry representative, to discuss the report, which was 
prepared by CEPA (the local Center for Policy Analysis). 
 
6. (SBU) CEPA,s data focused narrowly on existing tariff 
exceptions and the impact of the CET on government revenue, 
without offering an assessment of the CET,s effect on 
industry or key products or how Ghana,s tariffs compared to 
the rest of the West African Economic and Monetary Union 
(WAEMU).  The inadequacies of the report generated 
significant complaints and offered little opportunity for 
discussion.  Ghana,s report to ECOWAS is due June 30, so it 
is unlikely the GoG will make substantial improvements to the 
CEPA document before then.  The GoG is also unlikely to put 
forth substantive requests for exemptions from the CET, which 
would have to be phased out by 2007 anyway.  Despite 
frustrations voiced at the meeting, Ghana,s stakeholders are 
moving ahead with the process of adopting the ECOWAS CET and 
the workshop was a step toward that end. 
 
Free Enterprise Marathon 
------------------------ 
7. (U) Ambassador Yates hosted Jack Shewmaker (former 
President and COO of WalMart) and Robert Rich (President of 
Rich\'s Products) at a June 19 reception to support Students 
In Free Enterprise (SIFE).  SIFE is a university volunteer 
program on 1800 campuses in 40 countries that gives students 
the opportunity to learn, practice and teach the principles 
of the free enterprise system.  The Ambassador attended the 
Ghana National SIFE Championship on June 20 where the 
students presented projects that improved the lives of poor 
communities.  The winning school, University of Cape Coast, 
presented four projects that included teaching savings habits 
in a poor community, establishing a small food processing 
business, teaching bookkeeping to market women, and 
establishing a scholarship fund for poor primary school 
students.  The winners will compete in September at the SIFE 
2004 World Cup in Barcelona. 
 
U.S. Inaugurates Economic Training for Media 
-------------------------------------------- 
8. (U) USAID/Ghana and PAS Accra collaborated in a ceremony 
to mark the beginning of a USD 100,000 journalism and 
training program on economic and financial reporting.  USAID 
contributed the funding and worked with PAS to identify the 
Ghana,s Journalists, Association as the cooperating 
institution.  They designed a nine-month program for 100 
journalists in Accra and in two other regional capitals that 
will include both classroom teaching and 10-day internships 
with financial institutions. 
 
9. (U) The program also coincided with Ghana,s selection as 
one of the countries eligible for Millennium Challenge 
Account (MCA) funding.  When U.S. Treasury Under Secretary 
John Taylor spoke in Ghana recently about developing 
economies and MCA, Ghanaian leaders remarked on the need for 
the media to effectively explain complex poverty reduction 
strategies to the Ghanaian population.  The editor of 
Ghana,s most popular daily applauded the US-sponsored 
training in an op-ed and noted the US Government,s ongoing 
support for the media in Ghana. 
 
HIPC Debt Relief from France 
---------------------------- 
10. (U) France announced it would cancel 116 million Euros 
(USD 140 million) of Ghana,s debt (under HIPC) during a 
2-day visit by France,s Minister delegate for Cooperation, 
Development and Francophony in June.  Ghana and France also 
signed an agreement for a 1.5 million Euro (USD 1.82 million) 
grant to fund feasibility studies on potential priority 
projects in Ghana,s urban and rural development.  The grant, 
provided through France,s development agency, AFD, would 
also be used to finance sector specific studies that 
contribute to institutional reforms.  Since 1985, AFD has 
provided 400 million Euros to finance some 70 projects under 
a series of bilateral cooperation frameworks with Ghana.

SUBJECT: THREE MURDERED JUDGES HONORED; OPPOSITION STAYS 
AWAY 
 
REF: ACCRA 1311 
 
Classified By: Polchief Richard Kaminski, reason 1.5 (B/D). 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) On June 28, the Ghanaian Government honored the 
memory of three judges murdered in 1982, in the turbulent 
early years of former President Rawlings\' PNDC military 
government.  President Kufuor unveiled busts of the three 
executed jurists before a solemn audience of Ghana\'s social 
and political elite -- minus his political opposition. 
Simultaneously, the National Reconciliation Commission took 
additional hearsay testimony that Rawlings and his close 
advisors ordered the killings.  While Commission proceedings 
have been scrupulously non-partisan, and the unveiling 
ceremony made no mention of the politics of the day, the 
political overtones in an election year were unavoidable. 
Meanwhile, opposition politicians quietly discussed the 
December elections with security personnel. 
 
Murdered Judges Busts Unveiled 
------------------------------ 
2. (U) President Kufuor, Chief Justice Acquah, and Speaker of 
Parliament Adjetey unveiled bronze busts of the three 
murdered judges before a large crowd seated on the lawn of 
Ghana\'s Supreme Court Building.  Speaker after speaker 
extolled the courage of the judges (who struck down edicts of 
the then-military government), and recalled the repressive 
atmosphere of the period (while avoiding any mention of who 
actually ruled Ghana in 1982 -- Jerry Rawlings and his PNDC 
government).  Although scattered among the hundreds of 
lawyers, government officials, and social and political 
notables attending the crowd were supporters of the NDC and 
other parties, no \"official\" members of the principal 
opposition attended -- no DNC members of parliament, or 
former ministers, or NDC party officers. 
 
NRC Takes Hearsay Testimony That Rawlings Knew All 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
3. (U) For the previous several weeks, the National 
Reconciliation Commission has renewed its examination of the 
murder of the three judges, recalling former National 
Security Advisor Kojo Tsikata, and a number of others, to 
offer additional testimony on the gruesome events of 1982 
(the three judges were abducted late at night by unknown 
persons, executed, and partially incinerated -- an official 
of the PDNC government and several others were later tried, 
convicted, and executed by the PNDC government itself for the 
murders).  On the day of the ceremony honoring the judges, a 
witness offered hearsay testimony, previously heard from 
other hearsay sources, that Rawlings and Tsikata had 
\"master-minded\" the killings (Rawlings and Tsikata have 
stoutly maintained their innocence on many occasions).  While 
simultaneous to the unveiling ceremony, the timing of the 
testimony appears to have been coincidental. 
 
 
NDC and Security Forces Continue Informal Discussions 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
4. (C) Against the backdrop of these two dramatic public 
events recalling past security force abuses, Former Vice 
President Atta Mills, the NDC candidate for president, and 
other NDC officials, met informally with senior security 
personnel to discuss election security and other topics. 
Deputy Inspector General of Police Patrick Acheampong told 
polchief June 24 that the a 2-hour meeting with police 
commanders in Accra went \"very well,\" and Mills was very 
appreciative of the opportunity to talk at length on the 
upcoming elections.  Mills also told the police commanders 
that he regarded Rawlings as a burden, needing to use him in 
the campaign due to Rawlings continuing personal popularity 
with NDC supporters, but having to manage Rawlings\' 
propensity to shoot from the hip and make outrageous 
statements. 
 
5.  (C) Other NDC officials are also reaching out.  A Muslim 
NDC parliamentary candidate told polchief June 28 that he had 
just met with National Security Advisor Francis Poku, an old 
friend, and had reassured Poku that \"mainstream\" NDC 
candidates and activists wanted a peaceful election season. 
Poku, he said, gave a measured response, pledging security 
force neutrality, but noting that security forces would be 
ready for trouble \"if they needed to be.\" (Note: this 
qualified pledge mirrors Atta Mills\' statement to Ambassador 
Yates on June 22 that he meant to be the candidate of peace, 
but only if \"everyone\" was peaceful. Reftel.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
6.  (C) In honoring the murdered judges, the Kufuor 
government underlines its own commitment to the rule of law 
and ordered government, while reminding everyone (without 
having to spell it out) that Rawlings and his minions were in 
charge when the killings happened.  While no definitive 
answer exists on Rawlings\' personal involvement, testimony 
before the National Reconciliation Commission deepens the 
distinction the present government wishes the public to draw 
between legitimate and illegitimate governments. 
 
7.  (C) The informal NDC boycott of the commemorative 
ceremony reinforces the perception that the principal 
opposition party, as a successor to the PNDC military junta, 
cannot yet break with its anti-democratic past.  Mills is 
making some efforts to establish himself as a candidate 
independent of Rawlings, and his reaching out to security 
forces is a positive development.  Each side, government and 
opposition, remains suspicious of the other\'s electoral 
season intentions, but reason and restraint so far prevail. 
End summary.

SUBJECT: RULING PARTY WINS SEVENTH BY-ELECTION 
 
1.  (U) On June 29, the ruling party NPP candidate won a 
special by-election to fill a vacant seat in Ghana\'s 
200-member Parliament, garnering 85 percent of the vote in a 
modest turnout.  The principal opposition NDC did not field a 
candidate, and neither did most of Ghana\'s other parties (one 
independent and one small party candidate shared the 
remaining 15 percent of the vote).  Considered a safe seat 
for the NPP, the other parties decided to save their 
resources for the national elections in December, when all 
Parliamentary seats will be contested. 
 
2.   (U) A full complement of Electoral Commission officers 
traveled from its Accra headquarters to oversee the 
by-election in Upper Denkyira in the Central Region, and 
security force presence was considerable.  However, the 
election itself was uneventful.  One bar to full 
participation did occur in an isolated corner of the 
constituency: upwards of 1000 women voters were unable to 
cast ballots.  A traditional prohibition on women crossing a 
particular river on certain days meant they could not wade 
across to the voting booths located on the other side (this 
did not affect the final results). 
 
3.  (U) Comment.  This is the NPP\'s seventh consecutive 
victory in mid-term by-elections for vacant seats.  It has 
yet to lose one during President Kufuor\'s term in office. 
Results in Upper Denkyira were never in doubt, particularly 
after the NDC declined to contest.  While the NPP can claim 
no great triumph here (it did increase its margin of victory 
from 2000), it will enter the December parliamentary 
elections with an unblemished record.  End comment.

SUBJECT: FIGHTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING: SOME SUCCESS, BUT 
STILL AN UPHILL BATTLE 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. The scope of the problem of child trafficking in Ghana is 
difficult to ascertain due to a lack of concise data and an 
accurate census of impacted areas. NGOs close to the issue 
estimate the number of children working in hazardous 
conditions, particularly in the Volta River fishing villages, 
as being well into the thousands. The embassy\'s PolOff 
traveled with the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) from June 21-24 to observe their project, funded by 
PRM, that is working to rescue children from the fishing 
villages, reunite them with their parents in their home 
villages, and provide material assistance to parents and 
fishermen while reintegrating the children into schools in 
their communities. Although the project is enjoying modest 
success thus far, at this stage it is winning battles but not 
the war. More needs to be done on the legislative and 
prosecutorial front to curb the problem in Ghana. End summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
300 AMONG THOUSANDS: WINNING BATTLES 
------------------------------------ 
2. On June 21, PolOff traveled with IOM to Yeji, a fishing 
town on the northeast side of the Volta River in the Brong 
Ahafo region. IOM has established a temporary transit camp 
there, where children they have rescued from island fishing 
villages near Yeji receive food, counseling, medical 
assistance, and prepare to be reunited with their parents. 
Previous groups of children have stayed at the transit camp 
for just two weeks. The most recent group of 72 children to 
be rescued stayed for a month, and IOM plans to keep future 
groups at the camp for a month as it better enables the 
children to be rehabilitated. 
 
3. Local government officials have thus far been supportive 
of IOM\'s project to rescue the trafficked children. Toward 
that end, the Yeji District Chief Executive authorized IOM to 
use an abandoned government guesthouse as a transit camp. IOM 
told PolOff that in December 2004, the government will 
reclaim the guesthouse to renovate it and use it for its 
original purpose. At that time, IOM will have to find new 
quarters for its transit camp, a prospect which may move the 
rehabilitation project to the south of Ghana, closer to the 
children\'s home villages. Doing so would have the added 
benefit of moving the children to an area where their native 
language is more prevalent (people in the Yeji area speak a 
different language than people in the southern Volta Region 
where the children are from), as well as closer to their 
parents and IOM headquarters in Accra. Funding for the new 
transit camp is not yet secured. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
\"BUYING\" PARENTS WHO \"SELL\" THEIR CHILDREN? 
------------------------------------------- 
4. A somewhat contentious aspect of the IOM project involves 
their provision of material assistance to both the receiving 
fishermen and the sending parents. Other NGOs who have 
established projects to \'rescue\' children - notably, the 
African Center for Human Development (ACHD), which has 
projects in other areas along the Volta River - stand firm on 
the principle that people who \"sell\" their children and the 
fishermen who \"buy\" cheap labor at the expense of children\'s 
health should not be rewarded with provisions such as cattle, 
chicken coops, and piggeries (in the case of the fishermen, 
with whom IOM establishes contracts to encourage them to 
develop alternative business ventures) or maize, groundnuts, 
smoked fish, and soap (in the case of the parents, to whom 
IOM provides assistance in the form of provisional goods and 
micro-credit loan assistance through rural banks). (Note: The 
terms \'buying\' and \'selling\' have a continuum of meanings; 
typically, the parents and the fishermen (who are often 
distant relatives) negotiate contracts whereby the fishermen 
give the parents a small amount of money to use the children 
for varying lengths of time ranging from one year to several, 
though often these become permanent arrangements. End note.) 
 
5. In reality, however, the provision of material assistance 
to the parents and fishermen seems to be the only approach 
that has thus far ensured that children will not be 
re-trafficked soon after they have been rescued, as has been 
the case in the ACHD project. While IOM has reintegrated far 
fewer children to date than ACHD (IOM has rescued 298 
children, and ACHD claims to have rescued over 800), ACHD 
openly admits that many of their children have been 
re-trafficked and they are frustrated with the lack of 
cooperation of both the sending and receiving villages. In 
some cases, ACHD\'s method of rescuing children by forceful 
intervention (rather than through the voluntary commitments 
that IOM negotiates) has alienated entire villages and local 
police from cooperating with the effort to assist the 
children. Meanwhile, the long-term success of IOM\'s project 
remains to be seen as the follow-up monitoring and evaluation 
phases of their project are currently in progress. 
 
6. In meetings with the fishermen, parents, traditional and 
local government leaders, PolOff found that while many people 
say they want the problem eradicated, there is still wide 
cultural acceptance of the practice. Poverty is widely and 
accurately cited as the main reason for the problem, but NGO 
leaders close to the issue also cite others - polygamy, lack 
of family planning, the low status of children in a very 
hierarchical society, and greed. For example, at the ceremony 
on June 23 to reunite children with the parents who had 
trafficked them, PolOff observed that one of the parents who 
was reunited with six of her children was the Queen Mother - 
the village chief\'s wife, who is considered a person of high 
status and relative wealth in a very poor village. 
 
7. For the fishermen\'s part, they will quickly point to the 
plentiful supply of cheap labor that parents are willing to 
supply them. On June 22, PolOff met with fishermen from one 
very remote island village who also blame the damming of the 
Volta River in the 1960s for \'forcing\' entire villages who 
once depended on oyster farming in the south (rendered less 
fruitful by the dam) to migrate to the north, where the labor 
supply is less plentiful, to engage in the fishing trade. 
Justifications such as these abound, as does chronic poverty 
in Ghana. 
 
8. At this stage, it is difficult to determine the depth of 
support IOM has garnered from their local counterparts. 
Certainly, there are some parents and fishermen who are 
dedicated to improving their own situations and returning the 
children to their home villages so they can go to school and 
resume (or, in some cases with the very young children, 
begin) a normal life. But there are at least equal, if not 
greater, numbers of parents who seem more enthused about the 
financial assistance they receive through this project than 
about being reunited with their children. While IOM will pay 
the children\'s school fees and provide school uniforms for 
the first year of their reintegration, whether the parents 
will or can demonstrate long-term commitment to supporting 
their own children remains to be seen. In a country where 
poverty and polygamy are not going away anytime soon, and 
more children that cannot be supported will be produced, 
parents may see no other alternative than to re-traffick 
their children. 
 
9. One area where IOM has had clear success is in sensitizing 
communities about the issue. In villages where \'child 
trafficking\' is a foreign concept and the practice has 
traditionally not been viewed as inherently wrong, it is a 
sign of progress that increasing numbers of parents, 
fishermen, and traditional leaders now seem to understand 
that this is a practice they should not endorse or engage in. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO FISHERMEN/PARENTS: SOME ABUSES OBSERVED 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
10. Most troubling is the possibility that well-intentioned 
projects, such as those that IOM and ACHD are implementing, 
will be exploited by poor fishermen and parents. IOM has 
devised forms to collect more concise data and to track the 
progress of children they assist. Both parents and fishermen 
sign contracts and provide information about how many 
children they sold/bought, for how much, and the length of 
time for which the agreement was intended. Given that project 
benefits are awarded based upon admission of involvement in 
trafficking, there is a moral hazard: some people will lie to 
reap program benefits. This has already happened in the ACHD 
project, which provided school fees for rescued children; in 
some cases, children who had never been trafficked were 
\"rescued\" by ACHD based on faked confessions by parents. In 
light of the grinding poverty many communities face, these 
programs will generate some deceit and opportunism. 
 
11. At a ceremony held on June 23 in New Bakpa in the Volta 
Region, 70 children (2 of the children ran away in Yeji the 
day before the reunification) were reunited with their 
parents who had previously trafficked them to fishermen in 
the Yeji area (New Bakpa is a 10-hour bus ride from Yeji). 
PolOff observed the ceremony, held with much fanfare and 
celebration, to bring the children home. Amidst the dancing, 
singing, and praises to both IOM and the USG for bringing the 
children home - all of which was publicized by two local news 
crews covering the event - there were in fact a diversity of 
reactions on the part of the parents, many of whom are single 
parents with other children. Some seemed genuinely contrite 
for their actions and warmly welcomed their children back 
into the fold. A few others seemed much more interested in 
the loan assistance meeting (to take place the next morning) 
than the child reunification ceremony. A large majority, 
however, looked ambivalent - happy, on the one hand, to see 
their children again but worried, on the other, that they 
will not be able to support them in their impoverished 
conditions, and that IOM support for one year simply won\'t be 
enough. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
PENDING LEGISLATION: TWO YEARS AND RUNNING 
------------------------------------------ 
12. A fundamental problem is the lack of an anti-trafficking 
law, which has been in progress for well over two years in 
Ghana. A draft bill is currently sitting at the Attorney 
General\'s office, waiting for the Ministry of Women\'s and 
Children\'s Affairs (MOWAC, the ministry with the mandate to 
submit the bill) to put it before Parliament. Citing bad 
timing on the parliamentary calendar (not to mention 
presidential and parliamentary elections later this year), 
MOWAC says the bill is likely to be tabled until 2005. 
13. Some GoG officials cite the normal and lengthy process as 
the reason for the delay. NGO leaders involved in the 
National Task Force to create the bill, however, point to a 
dispute between MOWAC and MMDE over ownership of the bill. 
 
14. The Mission continues to urge its GoG counterparts to 
move the anti-trafficking legislation forward. It has used 
the release of the 2004 TIP report, workshops, meetings, and 
other opportunities, to highlight what the USG sees as steps 
forward on Ghana\'s part but also to remind them that pushing 
ahead on the legislative and prosecutorial fronts will be 
critical in the next year. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
15. The monitoring trip with IOM yielded mixed observations. 
On the one hand, IOM is the most structured, mobilized, and 
(so far) successful program working in both sending and 
receiving villages and has produced measurable results. They 
are rescuing, rehabilitating, and reintegrating children who 
would otherwise probably spend their formative years in 
hazardous working conditions with no access to education or 
medical care. On the other, the apparent apathy and 
indifference expressed by some parents at their children\'s 
return reveal that traditional practices and attitudes run 
deep and are unlikely to be eradicated quickly. So long as 
poverty remains a reality in rural Ghana, projects such as 
IOM\'s will continue to be a short-term fix that can only do 
so much. End Comment.

SUBJECT: STATUS OF THE WEST AFRICAN GAS PIPELINE -- THE 
PERSPECTIVE FROM GHANA 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) The parties involved in the West Africa Gas Pipeline 
(WAGP) are working to keep it on schedule and avoid 
escalating costs.  It appears unlikely they will meet the 
July 31 deadline for \"Final Investment Decision\" (FID), but 
mid-September may be possible.  The \"TO DO\" list is daunting: 
1) World Bank and OPIC insurance reach a decision to insure 
the project, which can only happen after the World Bank has 
posted the Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) on its website for 60 days; 
2) all four states must pass the WAGP Treaty and enabling 
legislation; only Ghana has accomplished both; 3) the parties 
must agree on the price of gas; and 4) all investors must 
make equity payments by FID.  GoG officials are considering 
MCA as a source of funding for Ghana\'s USD 90 million stake. 
End Summary. 
 
The Setting 
----------- 
2. (SBU) Representatives of the West Africa Pipeline Company 
(WAPCo), Chevron Texaco (CTX), Shell, the World Bank, OPIC, 
and the governments of Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and Benin, and 
the ECOWAS Secretariat have met regularly over the last month 
in the hope of completing WAGP negotiations and preparations 
so construction can begin this fall.  The longer the delay 
the more risk that costs will escalate -- by as much as USD 
30 million -- due to higher steel prices and construction 
costs.  WAPCo still clings to the July 31 FID date, or at 
least to a tentative July 31 FID, pending World Bank 
guarantees.  Post considers the July 31 outcome unlikely, but 
believes mid-September conclusion is possible. 
 
3. (SBU) WAPCo\'s spreadsheet outlines 89 separate actions 
that must occur prior to construction.  While not all must be 
accomplished prior to FID, even the September goal is 
ambitious.  Below is Post\'s outline of the state of play. 
 
World Bank Insurance Requirements 
--------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) WAPCo applied for a guarantee from the Multilateral 
Insurance Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and a partial risk 
guarantee from the World Bank.  It initially insisted that 
these guarantees, which cover the contingency that Ghana 
fails to pay for gas delivered, must be confirmed before FID. 
 Before the World Bank can approve the guarantees, it must 
post the regional and country specific EIAs and RAPs for 60 
days.  The World Bank raised numerous questions about the 
EIAs, but recently assured WAPCo officials it would post all 
documentation on its \"InfoShop\" website on or about July 7. 
 
5. (SBU) In a June 7 meeting, WAPCo agreed that in return for 
World Bank assurances to accelerate the review process, WAPCo 
would consider accepting the World Bank\'s Operations 
Committee Meeting Report prior to FID, with the final deal 
pending World Bank Executive Board endorsement. (Note: The 
purpose of the Operations Committee\'s review is to assess and 
mitigate project/country risks and World Bank exposure. End 
Note). 
 
6. (SBU) WAPCo hopes to accomplish all tasks and get 
Operations Committee approval by the original July 31 FID, 
with full Board approval in September.  However, Post\'s 
contacts in the GoG, World Bank and Nexant, the USAID-funded 
advisor to the four states, say it is more likely the 
Operations Committee will meet mid-August, with FID in early 
September and World Bank Board approval in the 
October/November timeframe. 
 
7. (U) As with all its votes on World Bank Group projects 
(including MIGA projects), the US must comply with the Pelosi 
Amendment, which requires that an environmental impact 
assessment be made available both in-country and to the Board 
at least 120 days prior to Board consideration.  Otherwise, 
the US cannot vote in support of the project.  The binding 
constraint on timing is often the date of board availability 
(when the Bank posts the assessment in its InfoShop).  For 
this project, such a posting in July would require a November 
Board date in order to gain a US \"yes\" vote.  In past cases, 
US abstentions based solely on the Pelosi Amendment have not 
generally affected whether a project is approved by the World 
Bank Board. 
 
 
OPIC Political Risk Insurance 
----------------------------- 
8. (SBU) WAPCo also applied for political risk insurance from 
OPIC.  Since the 60-day posting period also applies to OPIC, 
the Bank must post the EIAs and RAPs not later than July 9 
for OPIC\'s Board to vote on the project at its September 9 
meeting.  The USD 200 million coverage that WAPCo is seeking 
constitutes about 35 percent of the total investment.  There 
are three insurance scenarios:  1) MIGA covers USD 75 
million, Partial Risk covers USD 50 million and OPIC covers 
USD 75 million; or 2) MIGA covers USD 75 million and OPIC 
covers USD 125 million; or 3) if the World Bank backs away or 
creates excessive delays, OPIC could potentially cover the 
entire amount. 
 
Government Actions -- WAGP legislation 
-------------------------------------- 
9. (U) Ghana\'s Parliament ratified the WAGP Treaty on June 
30, 2004, and the GoG approved WAGP enabling legislation on 
June 24.  Benin ratified the Treaty on July 5, 2004, but it 
is still pending in Nigeria and Togo.  WAPCo is calling for 
Benin and Togo to meet their full legislative obligations 
prior to FID, but made an exception for Nigeria, since 
Nigeria requires FID approval before ratifying the Treaty and 
passing the enabling legislation.  Even with this exception, 
WAPCo and Nexant officials argue that President Obasanjo will 
have to engage directly to assure passage. 
 
VALCO/Market Forecast/Gas Pricing 
--------------------------------- 
10. (SBU) One of the more contentious and unresolved issues 
is the negotiation of the \"Mid-Market (medium term) Forecast 
(MMF).\"  This is the key component to establishing the price 
of delivered gas.  The situation is complicated by the 
uncertainty related to the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), 
which the GoG has agreed to purchase from Kaiser Aluminum. 
VALCO, which is currently shut down, comprises one-third of 
total power demand in Ghana.  With VALCO closed, the GoG can 
meet most of Ghana\'s energy needs through hydropower.  If 
Valco remains closed, WAGP\'s main customers -- Ghana\'s 
thermal power plants ) would run well below capacity. 
 
11. (SBU) The original MMF included VALCO\'s energy demand in 
the pricing formula.  Greater demand lowers costs per unit, 
and VALCO operating would allow WAGP to deliver gas at a 
lower cost than oil.  Without VALCO, the lower demand could 
lead to gas prices higher than oil prices. 
 
12. (SBU) Since the gas sales agreements are \"take or pay\" 
arrangements, and Ghana is the primary off taker, it is in 
all parties\' interests to ensure the gas price is 
economically and politically sustainable.  Therefore, during 
meetings on June 14 and 23, the parties negotiated three 
pricing scenarios for the Pipeline Development Plan: 
 
a) The lowest tariff scenario assumes VALCO reopening prior 
to \"first gas\" or \"Commercial Operation Date\" (COD), and 
Ghana\'s thermal power plants operating near full capacity. 
The GoG insists this will be the case, although WAPCo and 
World Bank officials are skeptical. 
 
b) The second scenario assumes VALCO remains shut down.  This 
would result in a low utilization rate of Ghana\'s thermal 
power plants, and the cost of gas would rival or exceed oil 
prices.  Since this is untenable for the GoG, WAPCo proposed 
mitigation measures:  1) Ghana, Benin and Togo would commit 
to foregoing new electricity investments until Ghana\'s 
thermal plants reach 80 percent capacity; and 2) the VRA 
would reduce its use of hydropower and increase reliance on 
thermal power, thus allowing Ghana\'s Volta Lake to recover 
and maintaining higher WAGP utilization. 
 
c) A second \"No VALCO\" scenario is dubbed \"Ramp Up,\" where 
the tariffs would increase over time as demand increases. 
This solution would increase WAPCo\'s revenues in later years 
but the higher prices would reduce the Ghana\'s longer term 
benefits.  However, gas prices would be lower in the short to 
medium term.  The GoG balked at entering into an arrangement 
where it would pay higher average prices even if its local 
demand were higher than forecasted or VALCO resumed 
operations subsequent to first gas/COD.  In response, the 
parties negotiated a mechanism under which the price ramp up 
will go into effect only when the gas price is higher than 
oil prices. 
 
Final Investment Decision -- Equity Payments 
-------------------------------------------- 
13. (SBU) The GoG, represented by the Volta River Authority 
(VRA), will take a 16.3 percent ownership share in WAGP, or 
approximately USD 90 million of the estimated USD 550 to 600 
million total investment.  The other major shareholders are 
CTX with 36.7 percent, the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation with 25 percent, Shell with 18 percent, and Benin 
and Togo with 2 percent each.  Most concerns over WAGP 
financing are over Ghana\'s ability to pay its share.  The GoG 
insists it has several financing options, but the reality is 
Ghana is cash-poor and under IMF pressure to cut 
expenditures. 
 
14. (SBU) Bank of Ghana (BoG) officials confirm they are 
prepared to provide a USD 90 million bridge loan to the GoG, 
using foreign reserves.  While this would help the GoG meet 
FID, the IMF\'s ResRep in Ghana says the BoG would have to 
unwind the loan prior to the December IMF review of the 
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.  IMF officials have 
suggested in the past that a waiver of this requirement might 
be possible, especially if the BoG kept ownership of the WAGP 
shares so its Net Foreign Assets Position remained unchanged. 
 During a recent meeting in Benin, GoG Energy Minister Paa 
Kwesi Nduom insisted that Ghana would make the equity payment 
without resorting to a bridge loan.  However, he did not 
provide details and the GoG is short on other sources of 
financing. 
 
15. (SBU) If the IMF is not prepared to grant a waiver, a 
longer-term financing package will be needed.  It is still 
unclear how the GoG will resolve this situation.  The GoG 
approached the IFC about financing, but only for USD 25 
million.  WAPCo, IMF, World Bank and some mid-level GoG 
officials have inquired about the possibility of pursuing MCA 
funds for this purpose.  (Comment:  The GoG\'s point of 
contact on the MCA told Econoff on July 4 that senior GoG 
officials believe WAGP is a top contender among GoG 
priorities for the MCA compact.  End Comment). 
 
Other Pending Actions 
--------------------- 
16. (SBU) A critical element is for Nigeria\'s N-Gas to 
complete gas sales agreements (GSA) with Ghana\'s VRA and the 
Benin Electricity Company (CEB).  Although N-Gas is close to 
reaching a deal with VRA, WAPCo and Nexant are concerned that 
the negotiations with CEB are moving too slowly.  One 
complication is that both VRA and CEB are concerned that the 
GSA draft contract security package does not reflect 
reciprocity and establishes unfair terms between the parties. 
 
 
17. (SBU) The parties must also conclude negotiations started 
by the GoG to reduce or eliminate certain \"eligible 
development costs,\" which would contribute to reducing gas 
tariffs.  The World Bank must also complete an Economic and 
Financial Assessment of the project prior to Operations 
Committee review.  However, it cannot finish the report until 
the parties complete the pricing scenarios.  Part of the 
assessment will be to determine the \"benefits to Ghana,\" 
meaning the savings from the use of WAGP gas (as against 
liquid fuels). 
 
Comment 
------- 
18. (SBU) The four states, WAPCo, World Bank and other 
parties have finally increased the tempo and urgency of their 
discussions.  Coordination has improved and the recent 
meetings resolved several outstanding issues.  Despite the 
goodwill generated during these meetings, however, the number 
and difficulty of the remaining actions will likely delay FID 
until September or later.  This will delay the beginning of 
construction and, consequently, will delay \"first gas\" past 
the June 2005 objective.  Ghana\'s ability to find a long-term 
financing package, either in time for FID or to replace a 
Bank of Ghana bridge loan, is a major concern.  It will be 
interesting to see whether the GoG decides to pursue MCA 
funding to meet this obligation.  End Comment.

1.  (SBU) Summary.  General Charles Wald, Deputy EUCOM 
Commander, accompanied by Ambassador Yates and the Wald 
delegation, called on President Kufuor July 16.  Wald offered 
congratulations on Ghana\'s MCA selection, offered to assist 
with GAF mobility problems, praised Ghana\'s ECOWAS 
leadership, and noted the USG\'s strong interest in seeing 
Africa equipped to respond to security challenges \"at its own 
time and choosing.\"  He also announced Ghana\'s selection for 
the State Partnership Program.  Kufuor spoke warmly of his 
reception at the G-8 Sea Island meeting, thanked the USG its 
continuing security assistance, requested C-130 aircraft for 
Ghana\'s air force, and agreed that a strengthened African 
security structure was in \"everyone\'s interest.\"  Kufuor also 
professed optimism regarding the upcoming Accra III talks on 
Cote d\'Ivoire.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) General Charles Wald, accompanied by Ambassador 
Yates, Polad Snell, Brigadier General Zahner, and other 
members of the embassy and delegation staff, called on 
President Kufuor July 16.  Defense Minister Kwame Addo-Kufuor 
and Chief of Defense Staff Seth Obeng also attended on the 
Ghanaian side.  Wald began by congratulating Kufuor on 
Ghana\'s selection for MCA.  He also praised the strength of 
USG-Ghana military cooperation, welcomed the African Union 
announcement of 5 regional standby forces, commended Ghana\'s 
ECOWAS leadership, extolled General Obeng\'s military planning 
prowess, and endorsed the concept of an African Union 
security system that is equipped to \"respond at its own 
option\" to continental crises.  Wald said that, for a start, 
the USG would \"help with mobility\" for the Ghana Armed 
Forces.  He also announced Ghana\'s selection for the State 
Partnership Program, with Ghana to benefit from North 
Dakota\'s reserve units. 
 
3.  (C) Wald suggested that ECOWAS was \"the model for Africa\" 
in its handling of politico-military challenges, and the USG 
would help Africa replicate that model elsewhere.  Wald also 
said he had been favorably impressed with the increasing 
technical competence of the ECOWAS military staff, with new 
officers from ECOWAS countries coming on board.  The USG, 
said Wald, had been making major efforts to establish 
effective bulwarks against terrorism in North Africa, and he 
hoped to see the same sort of cooperation with ECOWAS, with 
its strengthened planning capability.  The newly announced 
Global Peace Keeping Initiative would be one vehicle for such 
assistance, he suggested. 
 
4.  (C)  President Kufuor thanked Wald for his remarks on 
Ghana\'s contributions to regional security.  He noted his 
pleasure at attending the G-8 Sea Island meetings with other 
African heads of state, saying that \"we wish to provide for 
ourselves,\" but \"we must be realists,\" and keep close 
relations with donor governments.  An effective African 
security system required help from friendly governments, he 
said.  Kufuor thanked the USG for Ghana\'s MCA selection, and 
praised the embassy\'s support and involvement in the process. 
Kufuor praised USG bi-lateral military aid programs, and 
several times asked for provision of C-130 aircraft.  At one 
point, Kufor called departing TV cameramen back into his 
office, and had them tape his request to Wald for the C-130s. 
 Wald responded by once again offering help with \"mobility\" 
and by saying that the USG would \"look at\" provision of 
C-130s scheduled to be taken out of service.  (Note: Press 
articles the following day took their cue from the 
President\'s approach as they headlined, \"Ghana to Receive US 
Transport Planes.\" Expectations may be difficult to fulfill 
with the President\'s prestige on the line.  End note). 
 
5.  (SBU) General Wald announced and detailed Ghana\'s 
selection for the State Partnership Program, which had been 
formally designated that day as a Ghana/North Dakota 
partnership.  Wald\'s home state, said Wald, offered 
outstanding air and engineering reserve units who would work 
with the Ghanaian armed forces to increase their 
effectiveness and expertise.  Kufuor was pleased with the 
news on the SPP and the fact that Ghana was only the third 
country in Africa to qualify. 
 
6.  (SBU) Prompted by a question by Ambassador Yates, Kufuor 
expressed guarded optimism on the Accra III peace talks 
scheduled for July 29 and 30. He expected Presidents 
Obasanjo, Bongo, Kerekou, Toure, Compaore, and possible 
Mbeki, among others, to attend, as well as UNSG Kofi Annan, 
and all the various players in the Ivorien crisis, including 
President Gbagbo.  Although all the various factions would be 
expected to compromise, Gbagbo would be particularly looked 
to for helpful concessions, he said. 
 
7. (C)  Comment.  General Wald\'s praise for Ghana\'s military 
fell on very receptive ears, civilian and uniformed alike. 
USG interest in an effective African security system 
dovetails with Ghana\'s wish for enhanced military 
professionalism and regional reach.  The Ghanaian government 
press corps, unskilled (or uninterested) in the subtleties of 
donor/recipient conversation, promptly reported that Wald had 
promised C-130s to Ghana, something we may have to walk back 
in future press remarks.  However, the level of cooperation 
between our two militaries has never been higher, and seems 
poised for further progress.  End Comment.

1. (C)  On July 21, in a briefing for the diplomatic corps, 
Foreign Minister Nana Akufo-Addo formally announced the

that the GOG had firm commitments of participation from 
everyone he had mentioned. 
 
3.  (C) In response to another question, he said that a 
pre-Accra III negotiation session, involving the Ivorien 
parties, President Kufuor, and Chambas, was planned.  Soro 
would arrive over the weekend, he said, with Bedie and Diarra 
coming the 26th, and Ouattara the 27 (he mentioned no date 
for President Gbagbo). 
 
4.  (C) In the hallways of the conference center after the 
briefing, Ghanaian Foreign Ministry officials told polchief 
that an emissary from President Gbagbo was expected that day, 
bringing an \"important\" (undisclosed) message.  The Moroccan 
Ambassador, who we find usually quite well informed, told us 
later that \"of course it\'s a request to put off the talks.\" 
However, Foreign Ministry Supervising Director Leslie 
Christian said that, although there had been initial 
hesitation from several of the Ivorien parties, \"all\" were 
now willing to attend. 
 
5.  (SBU) Comment.  While acknowledging the potential for a 
postponement, Akufo-Addo advised the diplomatic corps that 
the planning for Accra III continues, a sentiment echoed by 
his ministry colleagues in the hallways afterwards.  Much 
appears to depend upon the ability (and willingness) of 
Ivorien parties to redeem pledges made at the AU summit 
regarding LMA legislation and the like.  End comment.

SUBJECT: DUE DILIGENCE ON COCA COLA-GHANA FOR THE SECRETARY 
OF STATE\'S 2004 AWARD FOR CORPORATE EXCELLENCE 
 
REF: STATE 155706 
 
1. (SBU) In response to reftel request, Post has conducted 
due diligence on the Coca Cola operations in Ghana in order 
to reaffirm the company\'s exemplary conduct.  Econoffs 
discussed reftel questions with government officials, Union 
representatives, AmCham leadership, and also, in a 
non-specific way, with officials from the Coca Cola Bottling 
Company of Ghana Limited. 
 
2. (SBU) Based on our conversations with various parties, 
Coca Cola\'s excellent reputation in Ghana is deserved and the 
company is maintaining the highest business standards.  We 
are not aware of any potential \"downside or embarrassment\" 
that could be caused by selecting Coca Cola-Ghana for the 
Secretary\'s 2004 Award for Corporate Excellence.  The company 
 
SIPDIS 
currently maintains excellent labor relations and is 
unionized, and company management does not foresee labor 
disturbances.  The Company\'s direct beneficial impact on the 
U.S. economy and employment is limited, but there is some 
indirect positive impact. 
 
3. (SBU) Post provides the following detailed responses to 
reftel questions A - D: 
 
A) As outlined above in Para 2, Post is unaware of any 
adverse reports on Coca Cola-Ghana that would cause 
embarrassment to the USG were it to select the company for 
the Corporate Excellence program.  Government and Union 
officials praised the company, as did the President of the 
American Chamber of Commerce. 
 
B and C) Coca Cola-Ghana is a bottling franchise, and serves 
the Ghanaian market and some of the neighboring countries. 
So, its impact on the U.S. economy and employment is 
indirect.  The parent company, Coca Cola Company 
headquartered in Atlanta, is a minority shareholder in the 
Coca Cola Bottling Company of Ghana Limited.  The majority 
shareholder it the Equatorial Coca Cola Bottling Company, 
based in Spain.  Coca Cola-Atlanta is also a minority 
shareholder in the Spanish company.  Coca Cola-Ghana buys 
inputs from the Spanish Coca Cola subsidiary, and Segun 
Ogunsanya, GM of Coca Cola-Ghana, thinks it is possible that 
some of these inputs originate in the U.S.  The U.S. parent 
company also provides most training and all marketing 
materials for the Ghana Company.  It is Post\'s understanding 
that U.S. expatriate workers are not employed at the Ghana 
Company, but sometimes visit to provide technical assistance. 
 
D) Coca Cola-Ghana workers are unionized and two associations 
represent management (one for junior and mid-level and one 
for senior-level).  GM Ogunsanya does not foresee labor 
problems in the near future.  The company is known to spend a 
lot of time on worker training and has good salaries and 
benefits relative to the market.  It also was one of the 
earliest companies to begin HIV/AIDs awareness training, 
voluntary testing, and provision of appropriate health care. 
Mr. Divine Atta Bosompem, the Deputy Chief Labor Officer at 
the Ministry of Manpower, described Coca Cola-Ghana as a very 
credible company and one of the best companies in Ghana in 
terms of labor practice.  The Ministry does not have any 
pending labor disputes involving Coca Cola.  Mr. Gilbert 
Awinongya, Deputy Secretary General of the Operations, 
Industrial and Commercial Workers\' Union also confirmed that 
Coca Cola staff are unionized, and described it as a \"good 
employer.\" 
 
4. (U) In sum, Post believes Coca Cola\'s operations in Ghana 
are reflective of the exemplary qualities looked for under 
the Department of State\'s Corporate Excellence program.

the Cuban-sponsored terrorism resolution to Foreign Ministry 
International Organizations Chief John Kuleke on July 15. 
Kuleke promised to give the matter close examination but 
offered no substantive comments on the demarche points.  He 
indicated the GOG position would be reached in consultation 
with its mission in New York. 
 
2.(C) COMMENT: After two Foreign Minister demarches and DAS 
Bridgewater\'s call, the GoG is certainly aware of the USG 
position, but we suspect Ghana remains reluctant to take any 
strong anti-Cuban position given the continuing assistance 
provided by Cuba in the form of Cuban doctors working in 
country. However, due to our continued strong bilateral 
relations, Ghana is also unlikely to take an anti-U.S. 
position.

1. Summary.  Ghana is preparing a National Biosafety 
Framework, in accordance with its responsibilities under the 
Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety (reftels).  On July 14, 
Ghana\'s Biotech and Nuclear Agricultural Research Institute 
(BNARI) hosted a stakeholder workshop to discuss the final 
components of the framework.  UNEP and the Global Environment 
Facility are assisting Ghana in this effort to develop the 
legal, technical, administrative and information framework to 
address biosafety.  End Summary. 
 
Speakers Support Prudent Biotech Use 
------------------------------------ 
2. Ishmael Ashitey, Minister of State for Trade, Industry and 
Presidential Special Initiatives, opened the seminar speaking 
about the positive impact that a well-regulated biotechnology 
sector would have for Ghana.  Biotech would contribute to 
Ghana\'s food supply by increasing farm yields, reducing 
costs, improving the quality of products, and improving 
environmental management of land and resources.  Ashitey 
challenged the scientists, business representatives and 
government officials in attendance to develop the biosafety 
framework to harness maximum benefit for Ghana.  \"If science 
is kept in the labs,\" he warned, \"it is of no use to the man 
on the street.\" 
 
3. In the keynote address, Food and Agriculture Minister 
Major Courage Quashigah was generally positive about the 
applications of biotech, but cautioned against its unforeseen 
hazards.  \"Biotech is one weapon against hunger,\" he said, 
\"but as with other weapons that can backfire and harm the 
user, biotech needs a safety catch.\"  He spoke of possible 
risks to biodiversity and human and animal health, and the 
potential for greater resistance to antibiotics.  In another 
colorful analogy, he likened biotech use to war, where the 
repercussions from chemical exposure or trauma may not appear 
for years.  He recognized that biotech, geared specifically 
to Ghana\'s needs, could truly improve its food security and 
nutrition, but warned that Ghana could find itself in a 
position in the future where it would be dependent on buying 
seeds from the \"Gene Giants.\"  He reiterated that Ghana has 
already made the decision to \"get on the train\" with biotech, 
but he supported starting now to prepare for unforeseen 
circumstances. 
 
Overview of Biosafety Framework 
------------------------------- 
4. Alex Owusu-Biney, the National Project Coordinator for the 
UNEP/GEF project to develop a National Biosafety Framework, 
gave an overview of the components. (Note: Post can provide a 
copy of the draft framework upon request.)  The objective of 
the framework is to promote research and development, but 
also to avoid negligence, misuse, or irresponsibility.  Ghana 
followed UNEP guidelines and incorporated 5 key elements in 
the current draft framework: 1) a government policy on 
biosafety; 2) an administrative system; 3) a decision-making 
body; 4) a monitoring and evaluation component; and 5) a 
mechanism for public participation and information sharing. 
The framework would apply both in Ghana and for transboundary 
movement for all handling, transit and use of biotech. 
Owusu-Biney recognized that no country has a foolproof 
framework and stated that he expects the framework to evolve 
over time. 
 
5. Owusu-Biney was forthright about the challenges for the 
project, especially since Ghana does not yet have a biotech 
policy.  There is a science and technology policy, which 
contains a biotech component, but he argued that there is an 
urgent need for separate biotech-specific policies. 
Questions regarding labeling and the role of NGOs remain to 
be answered, and there is confusion over how to reconcile 
national policy with other international agreements and 
guidelines.  Owusu-Biney acknowledged that policy makers have 
a lot of work to do, including building capacity, encouraging 
public engagement, training decision-makers, and training 
regulators to handle risk assessment. 
 
6. Owusu-Biney and other drafters of the framework admitted 
that this is a very technical issue and policy makers will 
have to continue to engage Ghana\'s scientists in the 
development of the biosafety framework and biotech policy. 
Owusu-Biney emphasized that the workshop was an important 
opportunity for all stakeholders to contribute to and become 
involved in the process.  (Comment: Econoff was the only 
visible outsider at the workshop and Post was fortunate to 
have an observer at this high-level working group.  The 
general theme of speakers echoed what we have heard in other 
discussions: Ghana does not want to miss the boat on biotech, 
but it also wants to ensure that it does not dive in without 
mechanisms to regulate misuse.  End Comment.)

1. Per reftel, DCM Jerry Lanier met today with the Director 
General of Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), Captain 
(Ret.) Joseph Boachie to hand deliver the letter and the 
accompanying talking points.  Boachie accepted that the FAA 
would be sending a reassessment team and asked that we keep 
him informed of the specific dates.  Boachie also informed 
the DCM that the Ghana Airways plane for which the FAA had 
blocked landing rights, had left for the U.S. this morning 
(prior to being informed of its exclusion) and would arrive 
at BWI at 4PM EST. 
 
Demarche delivered 
------------------ 
2. Using points per reftel, DCM Lanier raised USG concerns to 
Boachie, pointed out that the FAA questioned some of the air 
safety practices of the GCAA.  Noting that the USG was aware 
of the earlier ICAO audit, DCM averred that the concerns 
should not come as a surprise, and that we wanted to work 
constructively with the GoG and the GCCA to address the 
shortfalls.  DCM noted that we considered the meeting to 
constitute consultations under the Article 6 of the 
U.S.-Ghana Air Transport Agreement, and that the FAA would 
like to do an assessment within 45 days of the meeting.  DCM 
also informed Boachie that Ed Jones from the FAA would be 
here later this week to arrange the FAA reassessment. 
 
3. DCM mentioned that the FAA has suspended landing rights 
for a specific Ghana Airways DC-10, and made sure that 
Boachie was aware of that action and would make sure that 
Ghana Airways complied with it. 
 
4. Boachie thanked the DCM for the information, and accepted 
that he had been notified under Article 6 and that the GCAA 
would cooperate with an FAA reaudit.  He expressed some 
surprise that the FAA would come so soon, but said they would 
make every effort to cooperate. 
 
DC-10 Departs for BWI 
--------------------- 
5. Regarding the Ghana Airways DC-10, Boachie said that it 
had taken off early today before instructions not to leave 
could be issued.  Boachie said they had been in conversation 
with the FAA after the plane\'s departure and expected that 
the FAA would allow the plane to land.  He also informed DCM 
that the company which leases the plane to Ghana Airways had 
written today to say that there was a misunderstanding about 
the maintenance records and that all proper tests had been 
done.  He did not offer to share this letter.

Classified By: Polchief Richard Kaminski, reason 1.5 (B/D). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary.  Ambassador Yates met with Foreign Minister 
Akufo-Addo July 27, and spoke on the upcoming Accra III peace 
talks on Cote d\'Ivoire, and the convocation of Liberian 
signatories to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of last 
summer. The minister\'s comments focused largely on the 
mechanics of the two meetings: a \"no frills\" atmosphere was 
envisaged, with (he hoped) attention and agreement on central 
points.  He made one request: the latest information the USG 
has on recent weapons acquisitions by the Gbagbo government. 
End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  For both Accra III and the Liberian talks, only 
heads of state, with selected others (Kofi Annan, Ibn 
Chambas, others) would be participating, he said -- that is, 
no diplomatic observers allowed.  Most of the Ivorien parties 
would be in Accra by Tuesday, July 27, and pre-talks would 
commence on Wednesday, July 28, with some expectation of 
finding common positions on the key issues.  From his 
comments, the minister appeared to suggest that meetings with 
individual delegations would form the bulk of these Wednesday 
consultations, rather than some form of collective meeting. 
Thursday morning, July 29, would see the formal start of the 
talks.  A communique would issue upon the termination of 
discussions. 
 
3.  (C)  Akufo-Addo had one request: could the USG provide 
him with the latest information it had on recent weapons 
acquisitions by the Gbagbo government.  Talk in some CI 
government circles of a \"military solution\" had ECOWAS 
concerned.  Information on weapons acquisition would be \"very 
useful\" at the talks, he said.  Ambassador Yates pledged to 
obtain what information the USG possessed. 
 
4.  (C) Akufo-Addo explained the late-breaking addition of 
Liberian talks as President Kufuor\'s wish to make \"the best 
use\" of UNSG Kofi Annan\'s and AU President Obasanjo\'s 
presence.  While acknowledging that better communication with 
Contact Group members on Liberia would have been preferable, 
he said that Kufuor and ECOWAS wanted to make the best use of 
the assembled heads of state as well.  The Liberian talks 
would begin as soon as the Cote d\'Ivoire III talks finished, 
either on July 29 or 30.  While not directly addressing 
exactly how the review process on the CPA would proceed, he 
said that \"we all feel\" that a firm and directed discussion 
with the various Liberian parties was needed to keep the 
peace process \"on track.\" 
 
5.  (C) Comment.  Akufo-Addo was his determinedly focused and 
attentive self, offering rapid-fire remarks while his aides 
clustered around him.  He offered no substantive insights 
into policy issues on either Accra III or the Liberian CPA 
review, but did promise a complete briefing upon their 
conclusion.  End comment.

Classified By: Polchief Richard Kaminski, reason 1.5 (B/D). 
 
1. (C)  Summary.  According to ECOWAS Executive Secretary Ibn 
Chambas, the Accra III talks will focus on four main points: 
return of dismissed ministers, resumption of the government 
of \"national unity\", passage of LMA legislation, and DDR. 
Legislation will be the most difficult issue, with Article 35 
delineation of presidential eligibility at the heart of 
deliberations -- some \"transitional\" formula must be found to 
avoid a referendum on changing the constitutional provision, 
he said.  The Liberia meeting will bring LURD, MODEL and 
former GOL officials to speak with Presidents Obasanjo and 
Kufuor, and, if possible, Kofi Annan.  Interim Chairman Gyude 
Bryant will be urged to consult more widely, and the three 
factions will be pressured to cease their infighting and 
allow completion of DDR.  Any talks on Sudan will happen on 
the margins of these two ECOWAS-sanctioned meetings, and will 
likely involve only Annan, Obasanjo, AU Commission Chairman 
Konare, and perhaps Kufuor.  Chambas appeared optimistic that 
acceptable formulae would be found to reinvigorate the LMA 
process.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Polchief met with ECOWAS Executive Secretary Ibn 
Chambas July 28.  Chambas said four main issues faced the 
Accra III participants:  return of dismissed ministers, 
resumption of the government of national reconciliation, 
passage of legislation required by LMA, and commencement of 
DDR.  Chambas was confident that acceptable formulations, 
already under discussion in Accra, would be found regarding 
the dismissed ministers: Bedie would be empowered to appoint 
a new minister, as would be the New Forces, with other 
acceptable positions found for the dismissed officials 
(including Soro). Once these formulations were agreed upon, 
return of the G-7 to the government and its resumption of 
duties as a true unity government would follow.  DDR would be 
easier to begin once the government had resumed its 
functioning with G7 participation. 
 
3.  (C)  The heart of the discussions, said Chambas, would be 
LMA legislation and its intersection with the Ivorien 
constitution, most importantly, the constitutional 
stipulation under Article 35 that both parents of 
presidential candidates be Ivorien.  Chambas was adamant that 
a referendum on article 35 be avoided.  The enormous 
difficulty in holding a valid referendum in such a divided 
society, together with the very real potential for a \"No\" 
vote on changing the constitution, meant some form of 
\"transitional arrangement\" had to be found which would 
effectively trump Article 35.  Chambas said he had been 
suggesting that all signatories to LMA who were heads of 
political parties be accepted as presidential candidates. 
Another formulation would be \"all former prime ministers.\" 
Chambas had discussed the issue with GOCI officials in Accra, 
and they had expressed great interest.  However, President 
Gbagbo had been \"holding firm\" on the requirement for a 
referendum in meetings around the region.  Gbagbo had to 
\"give\" on this issue for Accra III to be a success, said 
Chambas. 
 
4.  (C)  On Liberia, Chambas said that Chairman Gyude Bryant, 
LURD leaders Kabinah Janneh, George Dweh and Sekou Konneh, 
former GOL Vice President (and briefly President) Moses Blah, 
and MODEL leaders would meet with Obasanjo, Kufuor, and 
\"possibly\" Annan, if the UNSG\'s schedule permitted.  As 
Obasanjo would leave Accra the morning of July 30, this 
session had to occur either late on July 29 or early the next 
day.  The Comprehensive Peace Agreement would i no way be up 
for amendment or re-negotiation.  ather, ECOWAS  wanted to 
urge Bryant to consult mre effectively and systematically 
(his handling of the central bank goveror\'s departure was a 
cae in point of poor consultation).  The various facions 
would be strongly counseled to cease their factional 
struggles (and identities), and allow DDR to commence 
throughout the country. 
 
5.  (C)  Chambas theorized that any discussions of the crisis 
in Sudan (reftel) would occur informally on the margins of 
the Ivorien and Liberian discussions, with Obasanjo and Annan 
taking the opportunity to compare notes.  Sudan was not on 
the formal ECOWAS agenda for the two sets of talks. 
 
6.  (C) The Ivorien talks would open July 29 with a brief 
plenary session of all the heads of states and Ivorien 
parties, he said, and then break for intensive \"one-on-one\" 
sessions.  He hoped that agreement would be reached \"toward 
the end of the day\" on essential points.  The Liberian 
session would probably begin immediately upon conclusion of 
the Accra III talks. 
 
7.  (C)  Comment.  Chambas appeared moderately upbeat, 
encouraged that the various Ivorien parties had shown 
 
flexibility in recent days, but mindful of how far short of 
expectations the Linas-Marcoussis Accords had fallen.  End 
comment.

that the USD 300 million loan from China New Techniques 
Construction and Investment (CNTCI), which was approved by 
Parliament in April 2004, is dead (see Refs A and B for 
background).  In May 2004, Minister of Finance and Economic 
Planning (MOFEP) Yaw Osafo Maafo told Ambassador Yates that 
the GoG was waiting for a good opportunity to allow the loan 
to die.  More recently, BOG contacts have repeated their view 
that the loan will not be utilized.  However, for political 
reasons, the GoG is still publicly supporting the loan.  On 
June 30, when a motion to rescind the loan approval was 
before Parliament, Osafo Maafo called on the house to reject 
the politically motivated motion, which it did.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Recent Parliament Action 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U)  On June 30, Minority leader Alban Bagbin tabled a 
motion to rescind Parliament\'s April 13, 2004, decision to 
approve the USD 300 million loan and suppliers credit from 
CNTCI, on the grounds that MOFEP and the Bank of Ghana (BoG) 
had misled Parliament.  The rescission motion listed various 
concerns about the proposed loan, including the validity of 
the lender and the terms of the deal.  While Parliament did 
reject the rescission motion at Osafo Maafo\'s urging, the 
event forced the NPP majority to publicly defend the loan. 
 
------------------------- 
Loan Details and Concerns 
------------------------- 
 
3. (C) The loan is intended for high-profile projects, 
including rehabilitation of the eastern rail line, 
improvements on the Accra-Kumasi road, establishing six 
Presidential Special Initiative (PSI) starch factories, and 
finishing the PSI garment village.  It will work more likely 
as a supplier\'s credit than a loan, with CNTCI and associated 
companies doing most of the construction work.  On the 
surface, the loan appears concessional with a 15-year grace 
period, 30-year repayment period, and 0.65 percent interest 
rate.  However, the four percent management fee (USD 12 
million) and CNTCI\'s potential ability to take a 20 percent 
stake in Ghana\'s mineral resources throw into question the 
loan\'s actual concessionality. 
 
4. (C) The dearth of available transparent information, the 
inability to verify the addresses of those involved, and 
alleged ethical questions about the individual reportedly 
behind CNTCI gives the loan a similar appearance to that of 
the infamous USD 1 billion IFC loan of 2002 (Ref C). (Note: 
\"IFC\" is not to be confused with the World Bank\'s 
International Finance Corporation.  End Note). In that loan 
scandal, it was only after considerable pressure from donors 
(including the USG), the opposition, and press, that the GoG 
ultimately decided not to accept what turned out to be a 
fraudulent loan offer.  The GoG responded by admonishing the 
international community for funding shortfalls that forced 
GoG to consider riskier arrangements.  The event tarnished 
key GoG officials\' reputations, including those of BoG 
Governor Paul Acquah and Finance Minister Osafo Maafo, and 
temporarily impaired their relations with donors and 
creditors. 
 
5. (C) Minority leader Bagbin\'s suspicions about the CNTCI 
loan are similar to those held by many in the donor 
community, the media, and some in the BoG and MOFEP.  Public 
skepticism emanates from the lack of transparency surrounding 
the loan, the GoG\'s inability to answer basic structural 
questions about the loan, and the GoG\'s checkered past with 
scam loans.  The debate over the loan has taken on added 
political overtones in the run-up to the December 2004 
elections as the opposition is looking for any opportunity to 
embarrass the NPP by linking it to desperate and 
irresponsible actions.  The June 30 Parliamentary action is a 
perfect example of this. 
/ 
/ 
/ 
/ 
/ 
/ 
/ 
/ 
 
6. (C) The NPP, on the other hand, is determined to 
demonstrate its actions are in Ghana\'s best interests, and it 
sees public backpedaling on the loan agreement as a defeat in 
the face of opposition pressure.  Hence, the NPP appears to 
still be searching for a graceful way to distance itself from 
the loan. 
 
------------------------------ 
Post is told that LOAN IS DEAD 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Prior to his public defense of the loan in Parliament, 
Osafo Maafo told the Ambassador in May that the loan was 
dead.  He said that the GoG was waiting for the opportune 
moment to end its arrangement with CNTCI.  Osafo Maafo has 
steadily worked to distance himself from the loan scandal 
claiming the loan was the work of the Ministers of Trade 
(Kyerematen) and Roads and Transport (Ameyaw Akumfi).  Osafo 
Maafo publicly claimed that he could take responsibility for 
the loan only insofar as he is the ultimate signer of GoG 
checks. 
 
8. (C) Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, Special Assistant to BOG 
Governor Acquah, told Post on several occasions, most 
recently July 16, that the loan is finished.  He told 
EconChief that since the concessionality is unclear, the GoG 
had agreed to verify various elements of the loan in order 
demonstrate to the IMF that the loan met the condition of no 
new non-concessional debt.  The IMF Board approved the second 
review of Ghana\'s PRGF and its HIPC Completion Point on July 
9, apparently indicating that the IMF was satisfied that 
Ghana was compliant with its commitments. (Note: the PRGF 
review is backwards looking, so its approval does not 
necessarily indicate an explicit repudiation of the loan by 
the GoG. End Note) 
 
------- 
Comment: 
------- 
 
9. (C) The on-going fallout from the loan leaves Osafo Maafo 
in a difficult political situation.  He was a central figure 
(along with Minister Kyerematen and Governor Acquah) in the 
\"IFC\" loan scandal and Post expected that he and the GoG 
would have learned from that fiasco.  Now, given the upcoming 
election, we expect Osafo Maafo and other GoG officials to 
attempt to deflect responsibility for the CNTCI loan. 
 
10. (C) The GoG had an opportunity during the Parliamentary 
debate to distance itself from the loan deal and put it 
behind them, some 5-6 months ahead of the elections.  The GoG 
missed that opportunity.  The opposition has promised to 
maintain pressure on the majority party until the deal is 
rejected once and for all, so the GoG is in for continued 
public debate.  The Parliamentary action may have forced the 
GoG to realize that the matter will not fade quietly. 
 
11. (C)  The fact that senior-most GoG officials, including 
the President and the Finance and Trade Ministers, were 
interested in this loan in the first place, is perhaps the 
most interesting commentary.  Post hears frequently from GoG 
officials that they are concerned this government has little 
to show for over three years in power.  They also worry that 
it does not appear that macroeconomic stability has yet 
resulted in improved living standards for average Ghanaians. 
This has led NPP loyalists to increase pressure on the Kufuor 
administration to delay difficult reforms and increase 
spending during this election year. 
 
12. (C) Indeed, there appear to be those in the GoG who, for 
political reasons, are willing to make risky decisions that 
put them at odds with donors and creditors.  This phenomenon 
underlines how delicate the financial condition of the 
government is, and may mean that GoG officials may continue 
to pursue questionable deals.  While Post cannot definitively 
say that the CNTCI loan is rotten, all indications point that 
way and the old adage that \"if it looks too good to be true, 
it probably is\" likely holds in this instance.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: WILL THE GHANA STOCK MARKET EVER SLOW DOWN? 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  African stock markets are attracting greater and greater 
investor attention, and the small Ghanaian bourse is one of 
the fledgling markets leading the way.  In 2003 the Ghana 
Stock Exchange (GSE) was the best performing stock market in 
the world with a return of 144 percent in dollar terms.  For 
the first half of 2004, the GSE is again the world\'s best 
performing market, gaining another 92 percent.  To better 
understand this phenomenon, post toured the stock exchange, 
met its managing director and general manager, the Chairman 
of the Council of the GSE, and several of brokers and 
financial sector leaders.  While the GSE is growing and will 
continue to provide an alternative investment opportunity, 
investing in this market is not for the feint of heart. End 
Summary. 
 
Basic Statistics 
---------------- 
 
2.  Only 27 companies are listed on the GSE.  The number 
listed has grown slowly since the GSE,s inception in 1990, 
but the recent success is attracting newcomers.  Several IPOs 
could get listed in the second half of 2004.  Low valuation 
had helped fuel the recent rise in the market but the current 
price-earnings ratio of 21 is quite high (compared with a 
historical average of 7).  There are few institutional 
investors in Ghana and daily turn over is low.  Officially, 
the market capitalization is now around USD 10 billion, but 
this figure is misleading as a very large recent issue, 
Anglogold Ashanti, distorts the market. Factoring out 
Anglogold, the market cap is closer to USD 2 billion (about 
29 percent of GDP), compared with a capitalization of just 
USD 500 million in 2000.  Using the USD 2 billion figure, the 
GSE is the sixth largest in sub-Saharan Africa. 
 
Recent Strong Growth 
-------------------- 
 
3.  The GSE,s recent performance can be attributed to 
several factors:  strong corporate results, declining 
inflation, falling interest rates, and an overall improvement 
in the macroeconomic environment.  Ken Ofori-Atta, CEO of 
Databank, the major asset manager and brokerage company in 
Ghana, expressed considerable optimism about the stock 
exchange\'s strength.  Ofori-Atta and the other financial 
sector leaders post met were optimistic that the GoG would 
maintain macroeconomic stability and that the low inflation 
and low interest rate regime would continue to stimulate 
business confidence.  He felt that external pressures such as 
the HIPC process and the credit ratings from S&P and Fitch 
helped create external pressure to maintain the good 
performance. 
 
4.  One sign of Ghanaian investors, interest in the GSE, is 
the growth of the mutual fund business.  Databank created 
Ghana\'s first mutual fund, Epack, in 1996.  Epack has enjoyed 
amazing success, gaining 4,393 percent since its inception. 
The number of investors interested in Epack has skyrocketed, 
more than tripling from 5,000 to 18,000 in the past six 
months, and the assets in the fund have increased from 75 
billion to 240 billion cedis (about USD 8 million to USD 26 
million) in the same period.  The establishment of four 
additional Ghanaian mutual funds in the past year is a 
further demonstration of the rising demand for new investment 
instruments in Ghana.    Nearly everyone post spoke with 
during attributed the GSE,s phenomenal growth in part to the 
falling interest rates.  Investors can no longer sit back and 
only hold government T-bills as they have done in the past. 
As investors diversify, they will inevitably fuel demand for 
a more robust capital market structure. 
 
Challenges 
---------- 
 
5.  Healthy development of a stock exchange in any developing 
country or emerging market is always difficult and slow.  The 
same is true in Ghana as it suffers from many typical 
\"Africa-related\" constraints: macroeconomic instability, 
government mistrust and  unpredictability towards the private 
sector, and the \"neighborhood phenomenon\" of being located on 
the same continent with much civil strife, disease and 
poverty.   More specific constraints on GSE,s development 
include:  (i) Lack of liquidity.  Many investors hold their 
shares and trade infrequently, so demand far outstrips 
supply; (ii)  With just 27 companies listed, investors cannot 
easily diversify, so are exposed to potential high 
volatility; (iii) While improving, the quality and 
predictability of regulation is still low; (iv) Trading is 
not automated.  Manual trading slows down trading and 
provides brokers the opportunity to interfere in smooth 
 
transactions; and (v) An unwillingness of companies to expose 
themselves to the required auditing and reporting standards 
mandated by the GSE. 
 
6.  Some of the constraints are slowly being addressed.   The 
Council of GSE is working to press the GoG to allow shares in 
SOEs to trade on the market.  Accelerating the completely 
stalled privatization program would provide the government an 
opportunity to sell its shares in SOEs, thus simulating 
private sector development.  The GSE itself is aggressively 
trying to convince potential companies of the opportunity. 
Many financial sector leaders confirmed post\'s belief that 
the GoG does not have a good understanding of the potential 
of a strong capital market system, and are reluctant to allow 
it to thrive.  The regulators (the SEC) in Ghana are 
improving, but are slow and it can take years to update and 
modernize outdated regulations.  For example, it took six 
years for the GoG to allow the creation of mutual funds. 
Regarding automation, the GSE has begun setting aside some 
funds in hopes of affording a new software platform within 
1-2 years.  The GSE is also looking for external funds for 
this project.  (Comment:  The GSE,s General Manager, Ekow 
Afedzie, asked EconChief for USG assistance to automate the 
exchange.   There is potential here for OPIC, Exim Bank and 
/or African Development Foundation. End Comment) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  The rocketing stock market is bound to attract many new 
investors to the GSE.  While this presents opportunities to 
make money, the GSE remains a risky place to invest, and 
there are signs of \"irrational exuberance\" taking place.  The 
current high valuation is concerning some investors, as the 
market has cooled in recent weeks.  Databank writes in its 
2004 outlook \"Speculation is rife with very little attention 
given to expected return and all the emphasis on 
supply/demand imbalance.\"  The dearth of quality companies in 
which to invest, the illiquid market, and the slowness and 
unpredictability of the regulators all constrain the GSE,s 
healthy development.  However, the potential for the stock 
market is there.  Several years of sustained growth, combined 
with lower interest rates and inflation, could contribute to 
a better appreciation of the market on behalf of the GoG 
policy makers.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: ACCRA III MARCHES ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS - LIBERIA 
REVIEW COMPLETED 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (U) There was slow progress on the first day of the Accra 
III talks on Cote d\'Ivoire. Led by President Kufuor and UN 
Secretary General Annan, all the key parties were in 
 
SIPDIS 
attendance as well as several (mainly West) African heads of 
state, UN, ECOWAS, AU, and Francophone representatives, and 
eleven political parties from Cote d\'Ivoire. The Presidents 
and Secretary-General met behind closed doors with the four 
main leaders from Cote d\'Ivoire - Gbagbo, Bedie, Ouattara, 
and Soro. A press conference scheduled late in the afternoon 
was cancelled. The talks (which were hoped to last only one 
day) resumed on July 30, with Liberia bumped to the morning\'s 
agenda and Cote d\'Ivoire to be resumed later today, due to 
SYG Annan\'s, Nigerian President Obasanjo\'s, and others\' 
travel schedules. Before departing, Obasanjo called for 
continued peace in Liberia, was generally positive on Cote 
d\'Ivoire talks, and urged greater attention to the Darfur 
crisis. A communique summarizing the talks is expected later 
this afternoon. Remainder of talks will be covered in septel. 
End summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
KUFUOR AND ANNAN SET THE TONE 
----------------------------- 
2. (U) SYG Annan urged flexibility and compromise by all 
parties. In a speech distributed to the public on July 29, he 
noted that the following priorities would drive the Accra III 
talks: 
- clarifying the delegation of powers from the President to 
the Prime Minister 
- presidential eligibility 
- adopting and implementing legislation under the 
Linas-Marcoussis Agreement 
- ending human rights violations and establishing a National 
Human Rights Commission 
- setting a comprehensive timetable for Disarmament, 
Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) 
- working with international organizations to restore public 
services 
- setting the stage for free and fair elections in October 
2005 
 
3. (SBU) President Kufuor opened the ECOWAS summit with 
remarks that were not released to the public. He noted the 
past and ongoing efforts to restore peace to Cote d\'Ivoire. 
He identified \"excessive legalities\" as the main barrier to 
the peace process thus far, and stated that \"a new tackle 
that will place more emphasis on a political situation is 
needed.\" Kufuor put the onus on Gbagbo and the Ivorian 
opposition parties to resolve the crisis, and proposed the 
closed-door agenda described in para 1. He additionally 
proposed smaller groups of presidents meeting with the 
various Ivorian parties later in the day, and then regrouping 
to prepare a public communique on the outcome. 
 
------------------------ 
CLOSED DOORS, TIGHT LIPS 
------------------------ 
4. (U) The plenary session on July 29 commenced at 11:00, 
after the key delegates had arrived. Press were permitted 
only for a photo-op, and members of the diplomatic community 
were not allowed in the conference facility. No agenda was 
made public, and the delegates were notably quiet over lunch. 
The SYG, heads of state, Chairperson of the Commission of the 
AU, ECOWAS Executive Secretary Chambas, and the Ivorian 
parties worked behind closed doors through lunch. 
 
5. (U) Only two opposition leaders, Soro and Ouattara, made 
statements to the press while the talks were ongoing on July 
29. Neither of their comments were inflammatory and were both 
cautious in their assessment of the conference\'s progress. 
 
6. (U) Diplomats were invited to a press conference that was 
scheduled for 4:00, but was eventually cancelled as the talks 
continued into early evening. No statement was issued. 
Sources close to the talks implied that mid-level delegates 
(e.g., foreign ministers, West African ambassadors, members 
of Kufuor\'s press office, and Ghana\'s MFA) also felt 
uninformed about the substantive content of the talks. There 
was much speculation, but little information. 
 
7. (U) One press official remarked that the talks were going 
long because \"Gbagbo\'s being difficult\". Another source close 
to the talks commented that the delegation was putting more 
pressure on Gbagbo than on the opposition parties to restore 
peace to Cote d\'Ivoire. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
LIBERIA ON THE AGENDA, AND CONTINUED \'BUZZ\' ABOUT DARFUR 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
8. (U) When it was clear that the Ivorian peace talks would 
carry over to July 30, the Liberia review was shifted up in 
the agenda so SYG Annan, Obasanjo, and others could 
participate before their departures. 
 
9. (U) In spite of rumors about Darfur appearing on the 
program at Accra III, the topic was absent from the formal 
agenda. In Ghanaian Foreign Minister Akufo-Addo\'s words, \"the 
ECOWAS summit is dealing with West African issues. Darfur is 
an African issue, but it is not the focus of this meeting.\" 
He surmised that Darfur would arise as a topic in informal 
discussions but underscored that it would not be on the 
formal agenda. Obasanjo\'s comments on his departure on July 
30, indicate that it did arise on the margins. 
 
10. (U) Obasanjo spoke about three issues on his July 30 
midday departure: 
- On Liberia, he said that the interim government had not 
been consulting other parties as agreed, and had been acting 
unilaterally. A \'mediation committee\' of foreign ministers 
has been set up to ensure that the comprehensive peace 
agreement holds. 
- On Cote d\'Ivoire, Obasanjo said that while he could not 
stay through the afternoon\'s talks, he expected agreement to 
be reached by all parties by the end of the day. 
- On Darfur, he said the recently-returned fact-finding 
mission found the situation in Darfur has \"rapidly 
deteriorated\". African heads of state are urging the GoS to 
ensure peace for all Sudanese people. There is currently 
discussion of sending African troops in to assist with the 
\"woefully inadequate\" security provisions that are there, a 
prospect that the GoS is reportedly open to. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
11. (U) It is too early to draw conclusions on the success or 
failure of the Accra III talks. That there was concerted 
effort by all parties not to say too much publicly suggests 
serious commitment to the substantive work that was taking 
place behind closed doors. End comment.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAIR, GH 
SUBJECT: UPDATE ON GHANA AIRWAYS CRISIS 
 
REF: STATE 160345 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) DCM, EconChief and FAA Regional Rep Ed Jones met 
July 27-29 with the Transport Minister and Ghana Civil 
Aviation Authority (GCAA) and Ghana Airways (GA) officials to 
discuss the recent FAA and Department of Transportation (DOT) 
suspension of GA\'s service to the U.S.  Emboffs also 
presented reftel points re FAA\'s request to conduct a 
reassessment of GCAA safety oversight (reported septel). 
While many passengers, including Amcits, are stranded in 
Ghana and the U.S., GA management has focused more on 
deflecting blame than resolving this situation.  GCAA and GoG 
officials also appear to be in denial.  Post will keep up the 
pressure on GA, GCAA and GoG officials to 1) deal with the 
crisis, and 2) overhaul safety procedures and oversight.  End 
Summary 
 
Sequence of Events 
------------------ 
2. (U) After months of warnings over safety concerns, FAA 
informed GA and GCAA on July 23 that it had barred one of 
GA\'s DC-10s from flying into the U.S.  GA disobeyed this 
order, flying the aircraft into and out of the U.S. on July 
24 and in again on July 26, whereupon the FAA grounded the 
aircraft.  On July 27, DOT notified GA that it had no 
authority to operate to the U.S. because it had allowed its 
Economic Authority (equivalent to operating license) to lapse. 
 
Post Message to GCAA and Ghana Airways 
-------------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) Following consultations with DOT, Post delivered the 
following message to GA and GoG officials:  GA allowed its 
Economic Authority (EA) to lapse and has been operating U.S. 
routes for roughly 2 weeks without this authority.  Before 
the DOT can reauthorize the EA, it must review GA\'s ability 
to provide service to the U.S. in compliance with DOT and FAA 
regulations.  DOT will assess GA\'s financial capacity and 
will consult with FAA on safety issues.  FAA\'s ongoing 
concerns about GoG safety oversight and its decision to bar 
the DC-10 will complicate the DOT\'s assessment.  Post also 
reemphasized that this was a separate (albeit linked) issue 
from the FAA reassessment of GCAA safety oversight (reftel). 
 
Stranded Passengers 
------------------- 
4. (SBU) Post initially received numerous inquiries from 
Amcits stranded in Ghana and contacts throughout Ghanaian 
society, trying to get information and help colleagues, 
friends and family.  Ghana Airways is reportedly not 
answering its telephones and not providing helpful advice to 
increasingly unhappy ticket holders.  The number of calls has 
dwindled in the last 24 hours, and we assume ticket holders 
are creating their own solutions. 
 
5. (SBU) Post is responding to Amcit inquiries that we 
understand GA is exploring alternate means of transport (on 
wet-leased aircraft) and ticket holders should continue to 
try to contact Ghana Air and monitor news announcements. 
However, we are also advising them to investigate other 
options, as it is unclear how quickly GA will be able to 
arrange replacement flights.  (Comment:  We understand DOT 
and State are developing guidance for use with stranded Amcit 
passengers.  End Comment). 
 
Ghana Air comments 
------------------ 
6. (SBU) GA officials were unfamiliar with the Economic 
Authority (or operating license), and asked whether the DOT 
had proactively invalidated the authority (because of safety 
concerns), if the DOT had notified the airline that the EA 
would expire (and whether it should have), the duration of 
the EA, what kind of paperwork was required, and the 
procedure to obtain a re-issuance of the EA.  They also 
inquired how they could work around the lack of the EA in 
order to bring back passengers stranded in the U.S., 
including whether they could wet-lease an aircraft. 
 
7. (SBU) Post clarified that GA was responsible for allowing 
the EA to lapse.  Post also urged them to deal on these 
issues directly with the DOT, especially related to finding 
alternative transport for stranded passengers.  (Comment:  We 
understand from DOT/FAA that GA is not working to resolve the 
passenger situation as aggressively or creatively as they 
should.  End Comment) 
 
GA and GCAA comments about flights 
---------------------------------- 
8. (SBU) GCAA and GA officials argued that they did not 
receive FAA notification early enough to cancel the July 24 
and 26 flights to the U.S.  GCAA\'s Director of Safety 
Regulations, Edward Akohene, stated that the FAA notified him 
by telephone on July 23 and was told to expect written 
confirmation via fax.  He says he waited until late that 
evening and also worked over the weekend, but never saw the 
fax.  GA\'s Head of Flight Operations, Capt. Johnny Yamoah, 
also claims he did not see or hear of the FAA letters until 
Monday morning (July 26), after the GA flight had already 
departed Accra.  (Comment: Akohene says he contacted GA on 
July 23 to alert them of the ban.  Apparently, neither GCAA 
nor GA officials considered the verbal order not to fly an 
unsafe aircraft into the U.S. sufficient to actually cancel 
the flight.  End Comment) 
9. (SBU) Akohene and Yamoah also claimed that GA safety 
officials did a \"walk around\" with FAA officials after the 
plane landed on Monday, July 26, and the plane appeared to be 
in good shape, with no obvious corrosion or leakage.  Yamoah 
provided a letter from the U.S. leasing company, BCI, 
claiming that the appropriate safety checks had been made 
(emailed to State, DOT, FAA). (Comment:  Post will deliver 
DOT/FAA points refuting these allegations, and clarifying 
that FAA has had concerns about the banned DC-10 for months. 
The UK banned this same airplane in early June for similar 
reasons.  End Comment) 
 
Press Reaction 
-------------- 
10. (SBU) Local media have reported the facts relatively 
accurately, relying heavily on DOT\'s press release.  Radio 
coverage, especially on the call-in shows, have been highly 
critical of the GoG and Ghana Airways management.  So far, we 
have not heard negative comments or criticism directed at the 
U.S.  GA and GoG officials have obliquely placed the blame 
for the crisis on the FAA, repeating the above allegations 
that the FAA fax was late and the leasing company endorsed 
the safety inspection report. 
 
Comment 
------- 
11. (SBU) Post is in close contact with GA and GCAA, and is 
strongly urging them to deal with the passenger crisis first, 
and then work with the DOT to find a way to renew GA\'s 
Economic Authority.  Post will emphasize in meetings over the 
next few days that it is incumbent on GA and GCAA to assume 
responsibility for disobeying FAA orders to ground the DC-10 
and explain what remedial steps they will take to ensure this 
never happens again.  Also, the GCAA and GoG need to take 
necessary measures to assure aviation safety, especially in 
light of the upcoming safety FAA reassessment (reftel). 
Unfortunately, GA management is currently spending more time 
avoiding blame than addressing the problems. 
 
12. (SBU) Ghana Air is a sensitive political issue, made more 
sensitive by election year pressures.  This latest action is 
big news here.  We expect GA\'s continuing crisis to get a lot 
of press and public attention in the short term, and hope 
that pressure from the Embassy and Washington will make GoG, 
GCAA and GA officials realize that this crisis is an 
opportunity to overhaul Ghana Air.  Business as usual will 
likely result in the death of the airline.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: MUSLIM WORLD OUTREACH -- GHANA 
 
REF: STATE 155954 
 
Classified By: PAO DQUEEN.  REASONS 1.4 (B & D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Since the events of 9/11/01 Post has made 
special efforts to increase contacts with and outreach to 
Ghana\'s Muslim community.  Post relations with most elements 
of this community, which is far from monolithic, are very 
good and, with some groups, they are excellent.  We have 
focused increasingly on those sects and groups that post has 
identified as being most susceptible to anti-American 
propaganda and maneuvering, with special emphasis on youth 
and students. Paras below keyed to elements outlined reftel. 
END SUMMARY 
 
A.  CONTEXT 
 
2.  (C) Ghana,s Muslim population is approximately 20% of a 
country of 20 million. The rest are primarily Christians, 
representing many denominations, along with a small 
percentage of animists. While the north of the country is 
primarily Muslim, all of Ghana,s large urban areas have 
significant, long-established Muslim populations that have 
mostly migrated from northern rural areas. Ghana,s Muslims 
are divided into four main sects, two of which represent 
different strains of Sunnism, plus smaller groupings of 
Shia,a and Ahmadia.  The Alhussunna Wal-Jama\'a Sunni sect 
hosts Wahabi missionaries and is more fundamentalist than the 
other group, the Tijanniya. Muslims in Ghana generally 
perceive themselves as marginalized from the mainstream 
Christian culture and the economic and political power they 
believe Christians monopolize.  Some Muslims acknowledge that 
this marginalization is a partially self-inflicted distancing 
due to longstanding fear of proselytization and conversion. 
 
3.  (C) The leadership of the middle-of-the-road Tijanniya 
has exerted a moderating influence over its younger, more 
radical elements and, to a certain extent, with the more 
Islamist Alhussunna.  At the leadership level, the two 
factions get along fairly well, although both face resistance 
from younger and more impatient radicals, especially in Accra 
and Kumasi, Ghana\'s second city.  The Shia\'a maintain a 
fairly low profile, accepting assistance from Iran, although 
the Iranian mission does not confine its outreach to Shia\'a. 
In the overcrowded and underserviced urban slums where many 
unemployed Muslim young men live, discontent with U.S. policy 
in the Middle East, and with a government that is viewed as a 
close ally of the U.S., is a potentially volatile and 
exploitable negative force. 
 
4.  (C) Ghana has been predominantly free of the religious 
communal violence that has taken place in other West African 
countries.  For the most part, Christian-Muslim relations are 
good.  Even in the most deprived urban areas, where members 
of all faiths are crowded together, disagreements do not 
escalate into religion-based strife.  Nevertheless, this 
tolerance has in the past been characterized by a degree of 
fragility.  PAO was told by an official of the Christian 
Council of Ghana, which maintains an interfaith working group 
with Muslim religious leaders, that a few years back young 
Muslim men in the poorest sections of Accra had coalesced 
into ad hoc gangs that threatened the peace in their 
neighborhoods.  Only the level-headed leadership of the 
Alhussunna Chief Imam prevented major incidents of violence. 
 
B.  ENGAGEMENT 
------------------------ 
Formal Institutions 
------------------------ 
5.  (C)   Post engages with a number of institutions and 
NGO\'s in the Muslim community, although some are more 
accessible than others.  The National Chief Imam, his office, 
and organizations associated with it, are prime interlocutors 
with mission officers.  These are adherents of the Tijanniya 
sect, espousing moderate interpretations of Islam, although 
many younger Tijanniya have expressed impatience with the 
lack of forcefulness and the relatively pro-American stance 
of the National Chief Imam.  Moreover, the other Muslim sects 
respect the National Chief Imam, but do not necessarily agree 
with his positions or follow his leadership.  Nevertheless, 
his moral authority and his role as titular leader of Ghana\'s 
Muslims, make the institution he heads and its affiliate 
organizations critical contacts for this post.  In a 
high-profile gesture, he and his senior staff recently 
attended the Ambassador\'s July 4th reception. 
 
6.  (C) A smaller structure exists under the Chief Imam of 
the Alhussunna.  They have a less liberal interpretation of 
their religion than the Tijanniya, making them, if anything, 
a more important target for post contact and programs.  The 
Chief Imam himself is a man of good sense and good will, but 
it is not clear how strong a grip he has over the most 
militant factions within his sect, especially the youth. 
Thus, post officers are making a greater effort to engage 
younger Muslim audiences, particularly among the Alhussunna. 
All the Muslim communities have youth organizations and 
NGO\'s, some directly affiliated with the offices of the 
national and regional imams, and some nominally independent. 
Also, there are chapters of the Muslim Student Association of 
Ghana on the university campuses, and serious post efforts 
are directed at them.  It is not always easy to identify 
which groups are the most influential, or have the most 
potential for causing problems.  Despite our limited human 
and financial resources, post is addressing this issue. 
 
C.  CURRENT PROGRAMS 
------------------- 
Representation 
------------------- 
7.  (U) The mission uses a multi-layered approach to engage 
the Muslim community, some of which relies on funding from 
ORCA.  We initiated a series of events that targeted large 
and influential audiences, generating a great deal of 
publicity.  During Ramadan, the Ambassador hosted an Iftar 
dinner for Muslim leaders, also including leaders from the 
Christian denominations.  Working through national and 
regional Imams, the mission funded food distribution in poor 
Muslim neighborhoods in and around Accra.  For youth, we 
organized soccer tournaments in Accra and Kumasi, in 
collaboration with a Muslim NGO, with teams competing for 
prizes.  Last year\'s final game started with a kickoff by the 
U.S. Ambassador and was attended by the Minister of 
Education, Youth and Sports.  Following Ramadan, the DCM led 
a delegation of post officers to present a ram and rice to 
the National Chief Imam, following local custom.  The mission 
worked with the MinEd\'s Islamic Education Unit to provide 
prizes to winners of popular student radio quiz show that was 
specially designed to focus on Islamic history and culture. 
(The prize presentation was held at PAS, with first prize 
going to students from the Iran-funded Islamic University.) 
--------------------------------------- 
DOD Humanitarian Assistance 
--------------------------------------- 
8.  (U) The Office of Defense Cooperation has carried out 
humanitarian projects in Muslim neighborhoods with Navy 
Seabee construction crews (e.g., a community center for the 
Alhussunna near the mosque in the poor Muslim ghetto in 
Accra), that have cemented relationships and received 
positive media attention.  When a post-organized site visit 
by General Charles F. Wald (EUCOM Deputy Commander) fell 
through July 15th, the Ambassador filled in.  All local Imams 
expressed appreciation for U.S. military assistance in 
building their community center in Nima.  At the Islamic 
School donation of U.S. textbooks, the Chief Imam said the 
U.S. military needs to know that they have friends in Nima. 
ODC is working with USAID to identify other projects for the 
Muslim population, including drilling boreholes in the 
water-starved north of Ghana. 
------------------------------------- 
Development and Education 
------------------------------------- 
9.  (U) Still in the public diplomacy domain, post organized 
a series of presentations to inform Muslim leaders of USG 
development programs in Ghana and encourage them to have 
their followers and communities participate.  One was a 
roundtable discussion on education, bringing together USAID, 
Peace Corps and Public Affairs Section to discuss how Muslims 
in every region of Ghana might take advantage of the various 
agencies\' education initiatives.  Our presentations in Accra 
and Kumasi targeted student groups, urban youth organizations 
and civic leaders, providing fora for mission agency heads to 
increase awareness among Muslims of what the USG was doing 
for development in Ghana, how Muslim communities were 
benefiting, and how others might do the same.  PAS has 
brought groups of Muslim students for briefings on services 
provided by the Information Resource Center (IRC) and the 
Education Advising Center.  PAS used the above-mentioned 
prize ceremony to brief Muslim university students on PAS 
services, and sign them up for membership in the IRC.  The 
Mission International Visitor committee targets Muslim 
leaders for IV projects, recently including officials of 
women\'s organizations and the Muslim heads of the youth wings 
of the Ghana\'s two major political parties.  Muslim students 
participated in a SIFE (Students in Free Enterprise) 
competition, an indication that self-enforced isolation is 
being replaced with engagement, thus creating openings for 
increased tertiary education programming. 
-------------------------- 
Individual Outreach 
-------------------------- 
10.  (SBU) Post officers have represented and explained U.S. 
positions and programs to Muslims, one-on-one, to small 
groups and larger audiences.  This has been a 
highly-effective way to engage people in a culture that puts 
great store on face-to-face encounters and personal 
relationships.  It also involves keeping an open door, 
usually at PAS, so that Muslim friends can drop in for a chat 
or have meetings with EmbOffs.  Officers have accepted 
invitations to speak before large groups on issues of policy 
and respond to questions on those areas that particularly 
trouble Muslims.  One officer gave a talk to students at the 
Islamic University, never before visited by an embassy 
officer, at the invitation of students who had participated 
in a program at the IRC. 
-------------------- 
New Initiatives 
-------------------- 
11.  (C) We are expanding and replicating all of the programs 
and events described above to more communities and 
organizations.  We are also planning new initiatives and more 
contact with students and youth, which is crucial to efforts 
to engender longer term trust and mutual understanding.  We 
plan to host a speaker on Muslim life in the U.S. before the 
end of the current FY or early in the next.  Our biggest 
outreach to an entire region will be launched in September, 
when the Ambassador opens an \"American Corner\", i.e., an IRC 
annex, in Tamale, the largest city in the Muslim majority 
north of Ghana.  (Note:  Tamale, over 400 miles from Accra, 
has no other permanent foreign mission presence.)  PAS is 
supplying this facility with $30,000 worth of books, 10 
computers, along with $22,000 supplemented through AF/PD for 
Internet connectivity and other equipment.  This center will 
serve as a platform for all mission officers and agencies to 
program or plan representational events in that region. 
Tamale also is home to a public university, whose students we 
expect to become regular visitors to this facility. 
 
12.  (C) Muslims in Ghana are open to contact and many are 
eager to learn more about the U.S.  Even those who oppose 
U.S. policies look with respect and admiration on America\'s 
social and economic accomplishments.  While there are groups 
and individuals who are worrisome and need to be monitored, 
there is little evidence their numbers are growing.  Post 
outreach efforts are now a significant counterinfluence to 
attempts by the most negative elements within the Muslim 
community to expand their influence.

Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) Ivoirien parties reached late-night agreement July 
30 to revive the Linas-Marcoussis Accords (LMA).  The 
Agreement sets forth four main components: use of 
presidential powers to revise eligibility for the presidency; 
a new DDR timetable; delegation of powers to the prime 
minister; and resumption of the Government of National 
Reconciliation.  Much appears to be have been agreed 
privately, as the agreement itself does not give many 
specifics.  On Liberia, parties agreed to more regular 
consultations, with no communique to be issued, to avoid any 
suggestion that last summer\'s peace agreement had been 
altered or reinterpreted. On Sudan, President Obasanjo issued 
a statement upon his early departure from Accra, calling upon 
the Government of Sudan to end the violence, and noting plans 
to expand the proposed African force.  End summary. 
 
Agreement on Cote d\'Ivoire, But Details Lacking 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
2. (C) Parties to the LMA signed an Accra III Agreement on 
Cote d\'Ivoire at approximately 11:00 p.m. July 30, after 
hours of protracted shuttle negotiations at the Accra 
conference facility.  Ivoirien delegations met repeatedly 
with UNSG Kofi Annan in the final hours, and overcame the 
nearly-two-day impasse.  Most participants attributed the 
extended deliberations to the unwillingness of President 
Gbagbo to accept compromise language on Article 35, the 
section of the Ivoirien constitution governing presidential 
eligibility.  (Late July 29, for example, Gbagbo apparently 
feigned illness to avoid an after-hours meeting with Annan, 
Obasanjo and Kufuor on that topic). 
 
3. (C) Earlier misgivings among ECOWAS and UN staff, as they 
wrestled to compose the text of an Agreement that, in their 
eyes, reflected little real progress in the negotiations, 
perceptibly cleared after the final round of sequential 
deliberations among Annan and Ivoirien leaders (Ouattara, 
Bedie and Soro together, followed by Gbagbo).  \"Gbagbo 
finally gave in,\" said Jimmy Aggrey-Orleans, special 
assistant to UN Special Representive Tevoedjre. 
 
4. (C)  The Agreement provides for the use of Gbagbo\'s 
constitutional powers to \"implement by the end of September\" 
the sections of the LMA governing presidential eligibility 
(i.e., changing the requirement that both parents of a 
candidate be Ivoirien).  Several participants told polchief 
that this referred to \"emergency powers,\" presumably meant as 
an acceptable mechanism for altering the constitution itself 
(and overcoming Gbagbo\'s insistence that the Constitution 
trumps LMA -- he would use his own emergency powers to 
\"adjust\" the constitution).  Parties also agreed upon the 
adoption of all LMA \"legal reform\" proposals, now before the 
National Assembly, by the end of August. 
 
5. (U)  On DDR, parties agreed to \"commit themselves to the 
commencement\" of the disarmament process by October 15.  A 
new timetable forms the basis of the agreement; parties also 
agreed that DDR would cover \"all paramilitary and militia\" 
groups.  Several participants commented that the new DDR 
timetable had been one of the easiest proposals to deal with, 
and one of the first agreed to by the parties. 
 
6. (SBU)  On delegation of powers to the prime minister, the 
Agreement provides for the President to \"undertake to 
translate the terms\" of his December 15 2003 letter on 
delegation into a decree, which \"shall specify the areas 
covered by the delegation.\"  The Agreement notes that the 
president and the prime minister \"agreed on a decree\" for 
that delegation, and for \"adequate additional measures.\" 
(Comment:this language does not seem to clarify the nature or 
extent of delegated powers.  End comment). 
 
7. (U) On resumption of the government, the Agreement 
provides that the various parties \"agreed on the urgency of 
resuming the work of the Government of National 
Reconciliation,\" and further agreed to convene a meeting of 
the council of ministers \"within a week.\" 
 
8. (U) The Agreement also provides for a tripartite 
monitoring body, composed of ECOWAS, AU and UN personnel, 
which is to make \"fortnightly\" reports.  A human rights 
commission, provided for under LMA, is to be established 
\"without further delay.\" 
 
9. (U) Note: the Agreement was faxed to AF/W July 31, and is 
 
 
now available on the net, for example at Abidjan.net. 
 
Liberia:  Meetings, But No Formal Communique 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU)  LURD (Kabineh Janneh, George Dweh, among others), 
MODEL, representatives of the former GOL (including Moses 
Blah) and Interim Chairman Gyude Bryant of the Transitional 
Government met until approximately 7:00 p.m. July 30. 
Ghanaian Foreign Minister Akufo-Addo chaired the latter 
stages of the meetings, with General Abubakar, last summer\'s 
peace talks mediator, also attending.  AU personnel present 
at the deliberations said no communique would be issued, so 
as to avoid any suggestion that the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement had been altered or reinterpreted.  A low-level 
\"report\" of some sort would be issued instead.  The parties 
focused on better communication among the signatories to the 
CPA, with weekly cabinet meetings a possibility.  Attempts 
were also made to  mediate intra-LURD disputes.  LURD 
representatives appeared to accept the concept of better 
consultation as a starting point for a more effective 
government (Janneh with better grace than Dweh, in comments 
to polchief). 
 
Sudan:  Call for Peace, Plans for Bigger African Force 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
11. (U) Upon his early departure from Accra July 30, 
President Obasanjo issued a press release (faxed to AF/W) on 
Sudan.  Noting that a meeting \"on the margins\" of Accra III 
occured to discuss the situation, he called upon the Sudanese 
government to end the violence. Obasanjo also noted efforts 
to insert an African Union force to provide protection of an 
observer mission, and to facilitate humanitarian assistance. 
The statement says that participants \"agreed that this 
African force needs to be significantly expanded.\"  The 
statement closes in calling upon the international community 
to assist with logistics and financial support. 
 
Comment 
------- 
12. (C)  Relief, mingled with fatigue, characterized the 
reactions of many of the UN and ECOWAS personnel present for 
the final late-night signature of the Agreement.  However, 
key details appear to be lacking in the text itself, whatever 
the private understandings may be:  how Gbagbo is to apply 
his emergency powers, how the government is to reconstitute 
itself, and exactly what powers will ultimately be delegated 
to the prime minister.  End comment.

SUBJECT: GHANA ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS JULY 2004 
 
 
1. This report covers noteworthy economic events and 
activities in Ghana for July 2004.  The issues covered are: 
 
-- Launch of Private Sector Development Strategy 
-- Ghana Hosts Talks on ECOWAS Common External Tariff 
-- One to Watch: Economy of Ghana Network Launched 
-- New Fees on Food Imports 
 
Launch of Private Sector Development Strategy 
--------------------------------------------- 
2. On July 14, 2004, President Kufuor launched the National 
medium-term Private Sector Development Strategy (PSDS), which 
aims to fulfill the GoG vision of achieving the \"Golden Age 
of Business\" in Ghana.  Numerous GoG, private sector and 
donor representatives were present and stated their support 
for and commitment to the strategy.  In his speech, Kufuor 
argued that now that the GoG has achieved a level of 
macroeconomic stability, it is time to tackle the 
microeconomic environment, to enable the private sector to 
fulfill its role in powering the economy. 
 
3. The PSDS assesses Ghana\'s current business environment and 
outlines the strategies to achieve economic targets.  The 
strategy promotes broad-based pro-market reforms through 
consultation with the private sector and monitoring by 
development partners.  The strategy identifies four strategic 
objectives as part of the institutional framework: 1) to 
enhance Ghana\'s position in global and regional markets; 2) 
to improve the efficiency and accessibility of national 
markets; 3) to increase the competence and capacity at the 
firm level; and 4) to strengthen the GoG\'s private sector 
policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring and 
evaluation.  The GoG expects the strategy to improve Ghana\'s 
investment rating and to remove barriers to doing business in 
Ghana. 
 
Ghana Hosts Talks on ECOWAS Common External Tariff 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
4. Delegations from Ghana, The Gambia, Guinea, Nigeria, and 
Sierra Leone met July 28-30 to discuss progress and negotiate 
positions on adopting the ECOWAS Common External Tariff 
(CET).  The USAID West Africa Regional Program (WARP) is 
funding this effort to complete the CET, which is based on 
the existing CET shared by the eight member states of the 
predominantly francophone West African Economic and Monetary 
Union (WAEMU).  The five countries plus Cape Verde plan for 
the ECOWAS CET to go into effect January 1, 2005, with each 
country phasing in new tariff levels over three years so that 
all ECOWAS member states have harmonized tariff structures by 
December 31, 2007. 
 
5. Although the CET treaty was originally signed by ECOWAS 
heads of state in 1975, and revised in 1993, the process was 
resuscitated by the EU\'s declaration that it will only 
negotiate trade agreements with or disburse European 
Development Funds to regional groups after 2007, not 
individual countries.  Under the new Cotonou Agreement, the 
negotiation of WTO-compatible new trading arrangements 
between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) 
countries must be completed by 2008.  The European Commission 
proposes that regional reciprocal free trade agreements 
replace the current non-reciprocal preferences in the trade 
relations between the EU and ACP countries. 
 
6. Delegations were expected to report on their progress on 
adopting the CET, propose tariff exceptions and exemptions, 
report their findings on the economic impact of adopting the 
CET, and present specific plans to introduce the new tariff 
structure over the three-year phase-in period. 
Representatives from The Gambia, Guinea and Sierra Leone were 
well prepared for the meeting, and offered comprehensive 
reports on the above subjects.  Larger economies Ghana and 
Nigeria, however, were only prepared to brief on expected 
economic impact, though both expressed commitment to adopting 
the CET within the proposed timeline.  The next round of CET 
negotiations will take place in September 2005. 
 
One to Watch: Economy of Ghana Network Launched 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
7. More than 80 economists, policymakers and industry leaders 
have created the Economy of Ghana Network (EGN), a virtual 
community that promises to become a leading voice on economic 
development in Ghana. The intent of the EGN is to invite 
global participation to ensure that healthy criticism and 
independent external perspectives contribute to Ghana\'s 
economic policy. The network pledges to remain non-partisan 
while providing substantive evaluation of economic proposals 
by all political parties.  Conference papers and future EGN 
activities will be posted soon at www.isser.org. 
 
8. Organizers launched EGN on July 20 at the \"Ghana at the 
Half Century\" conference, an event jointly sponsored by 
Cornell University and the Institute of Statistical, Social 
and Economic Research (ISSER) at the University of Ghana. 
The conference attracted 186 participants from academia, 
government, and the private sector from Ghana, the U.S., UK, 
and Canada. 
 
9. During the three-day conference, speakers and participants 
debated the role the GoG should play in private sector 
development. Several participants spoke of the inadequacy of 
existing institutions, such as the Council of State and the 
judiciary and regulatory bodies, as well as the demoralized 
civil service.  It was also apparent that many participants 
thought that the need for politically palatable macroeconomic 
policies overshadowed the role of pure research in policy 
formulation 
 
10. A speech read on behalf of President Kufuor highlighted 
the need for institution-building and the expectation that 
deliberations would generate ideas on how to fast track 
Ghana\'s economy to a middle-income status by identifying 
critical pathways to poverty reduction and human capital 
development. Though never fully blessing the EGN, Kufuor 
cautiously aligned himself with the conference agenda, 
acknowledging that a large part of Ghana\'s strategy for 
faster growth and development will hinge on deepening Ghana\'s 
knowledge base and using it to strengthen interaction with 
the rest of the world. 
 
New Fees on Food Imports 
------------------------ 
11. Ghana\'s Food and Drug Board announced it will begin 
charging registration fees for all regulated imported goods, 
effective September 1.  The fees will be levied on imported 
food products, such as rice, sugar, poultry, fats and oils, 
tomato paste, juices and flour products. (Note: U.S. rice, 
poultry, and wheat exports to Ghana will be affected.  End 
Note).  The stated goal is to protect the health and safety 
of consumers, and the fees will ostensibly provide funding 
for laboratory analysis of products, post-market surveillance 
activities, and administrative needs.

1. (C) Ambassador Yates delivered reftel points on the USG\'s 
Global 
Defense Posture review to Foreign Minister Akufo-Addo July 
27.  She 
emphasized the collaborative nature of the review, and noted 
that 
a similar demarche would be made upon the Ministry of Defense. 
She said that with the completion of the Exercise Reception 
Facility in Ghana, the concept of cooperative security 
envisioned in the strategy review already had a foundation 
here. 
She also briefly reviewed the status of several MOUs that 
required signature by the GOG (the C-12 basing in Accra, the 
African Fuel Hub Initiative), as examples of cooperative 
arrangements that reflected new security realities in Africa. 
 
Akufo-Addo agreed that Cold War defense arrangements were now 
out of date, and said that the review would be beneficial. 
He promised to review the status of the outstanding MOUs (now 
t the Office of the Attorney General).  If the GOG 
had any substantive response to the demarche points, after 
close 
review within his Ministry, appropriate officials would reply, 
he said. 
 
2. (C) DCM Lanier delivered reftel points to Chief of the 
Defense 
Staff, Lt. General Seth Obeng on July 28.  Lanier noted the 
evolution in the U.S. defense posture and praised Ghana for 
having already participated as a partner and ally in 
strategic readjustment, mentioning the same specific projects 
noted above. Gen. Obeng made it clear he was aware of the 
change 
in defense posture and was quite pleased with the cooperative 
security relations it fostered.  He gently warned, however, 
that the U.S. must be careful to be certain that in Africa the 
increased American presence did not look like occupation. 
He also asked that the assistance and benefits of the new 
U.S.-Ghana relationship be extended to other countries in 
region. 
He seemed concerned that the appearance of an excessively 
close 
relationship with the U.S. could damage Ghana\'s credibilty 
in the region.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, KDEM, GH 
SUBJECT: GHANA NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION 
CONCLUDES: FORMAL REPORT FORTHCOMING 
 
1. Summary. After 22 months of hearings, the National 
Reconciliation Commission wrapped up its formal hearings on 
July 13, with a few high-profile cases ensuring that the 
NRC\'s closing would not pass quietly. In spite of some 
rumblings from the opposition party, most agreed that the NRC 
had done a good job in its proceedings and that witnesses\' 
testimonies were heard fairly and transparently. The formal 
report is now being compiled and will be released to the 
government, and for public review, in mid-October - just over 
a month before national elections. Over 2,000 petitions were 
heard by the NRC during its tenure. End summary. 
 
2. The past few months saw several high-profile cases come 
before the NRC. Most notably, the case involving the murders 
of three High Court judges was of particular interest. 
Allegations were made to the NRC that former president 
Rawlings and his former security adviser, Kojo Tsikata, 
masterminded the murder of the three judges and an army 
officer in 1982. The charges have been denied by Rawlings and 
Tsikata, and even into the waning days of the NRC\'s hearings, 
 
SIPDIS 
Tsikata protested the handling of the hearings pertaining to 
 
SIPDIS 
these cases. Tsikata filed an appeal at the Appeals Court 
with the complaint that the time allocated for his 
cross-examination of his accusers was restricted, and that he 
was denied access to his accusers\' original statements. The 
Appeals Court is expected to pronounce a ruling on Tsikata\'s 
claim before the NRC issues its report in October. 
 
3. In spite of a few contested allegations, the work of the 
NRC seems to have largely accomplished its aim. The NRC\'s 
goal was to provide a forum in which citizens who felt they 
were subjected to state-sanctioned human rights violations 
could openly and freely have their cases heard. Although the 
opposition NDC has argued throughout the process that the NRC 
is merely a politicized stage to win the ruling NPP favor 
with the public, the process has been generally accepted as 
fair and transparent. 
 
4. Although the National Reconciliation Act of 2002 states 
that incriminatory evidence taken during the NRC hearings 
\"shall not be used in any criminal or civil proceedings 
against that person\", former and current NDC members remain 
concerned that the commission\'s report will be used to 
prosecute key figures of the PNDC, under whose rule many of 
the alleged human rights abuses took place. On August 2, an 
NDC Member of Parliament, in a private lunch, told the 
Ambassador that Rawlings was concerned about the possibility 
of being prosecuted for crimes that were revealed during the 
NRC\'s hearings, and that this concern affects his decisions 
about foreign travel. The MP was also critical of the NRC\'s 
handling of the High Court judges case. 
 
5. Comment. The NRC statute does not preclude prosecution 
based upon evidence independently developed by the NRC. 
However, the 1992 Constitution has immunity clauses for acts 
taken in an official capacity. To date, criminal prosecution 
by the NRC has not been a major focus of public (or private) 
discussion of its activites. The immunity language of the NRC 
Act and the Constitution would present significant barriers 
to any attempts to do so. Nonetheless, rumblings about the 
prospect of the role of the NRC in future criminal or civil 
prosecution - mostly from the opposition - persist. It is 
expected that the report\'s release in mid-October will 
provide additional fodder to the pre-election foray. End 
comment.

Summary 
------- 
1. (U) Ghana Air\'s management has finally gained some measure 
of control over the crisis that stranded up to 5,000 
passengers in Ghana, the U.S. and The Gambia (see reftels A, 
C, D, E for background).  The third repatriation flight, on 
wet-leased World Air, left August 9 for Baltimore (BWI).  The 
passenger check-in process was calm and orderly, and Ghana 
Air published flight information and contacted ticket holders 
ahead of time.  Two additional flights to New York/JFK are 
scheduled for August 11-14.  Post has assisted irate and 
frustrated Amcits to get on the correct lists, procure over 
the counter medicines, and get in contact with the often 
unreachable Ghana Air staff.  The Ghana Civil Aviation 
Authority (GCAA) requested in writing that the FAA delay its 
safety reassessment mission until mid-October (Ref A). 
Transport Ministry, GCAA, and Ghana Air officials are 
planning an official trip to the U.S. to meet with USG 
agencies, although no date has been set.  End Summary. 
 
Ghana Air Passenger Repatriation 
-------------------------------- 
2. (U) Every Amcit in contact with Post to date has departed 
Ghana.  This includes two children from Liberia who are being 
adopted by families in the U.S.  The children were first-time 
travelers on Ghana Air, and were therefore rejected by Ghana 
Air staff holding to Department of Transportation\'s (DOT) 
orders that these flights were for returning passengers only. 
 However, DOT, State and Post officers were able to get last 
minute authorization to Ghana Air and the children departed 
on the August 7 flight.  Post is unlikely to receive many new 
requests for assistance because the remaining Amcits appear 
to have reached a sufficient comfort level with the 
repatriation process not to need Embassy support. 
 
3. (U) The repatriation process got off to a rocky start on 
August 4.  Ghana Air put out a public notice to passengers at 
the last minute, and only at Post\'s urging.  Ghana Air 
managers also failed to get representatives out early to deal 
with long lines of passengers waiting to check-in, and then 
did not have adequate security on hand to deal with unhappy 
and confused passengers.  Post\'s RSO had to call in 15-20 
police he had pre-positioned nearby to calm the situation. 
 
4. (U) Ghana Air Acting CEO Ms. Akua Sarpong and other Ghana 
Air managers seemed to learn from their mistakes, and are now 
disseminating information sooner and using more people to 
manage the check-in process and handle passenger inquiries. 
As a result, the August 7 and August 9 flights went smoothly. 
 Sarpong assures Post that Ghana Air is planning additional 
repatriation flights this week, with the first one scheduled 
to depart August 11 for JFK, and the second flight to leave 
near the weekend, also en route JFK airport. 
 
5. (SBU) Ms. Sarpong is concerned that the repatriation 
flight loads are down, and Ghana Air is nearing the point 
where it will not be economical to continue the wet-lease 
arrangement just for returning passengers.  The flights from 
the U.S. are already only half full, and Sarpong expects this 
will also be the case by this coming weekend for return 
flights to Baltimore and New York.  She hopes to reach some 
kind of accommodation from DOT in the near future to allow 
Ghana Air to fly newly ticketed passengers.  Otherwise, Ghana 
Air will need to find cheaper means to return the few 
remaining stranded passengers, such as book them on other 
airlines through Europe. 
 
More Trouble for Ghana Air 
-------------------------- 
6. (SBU) Ghana Air\'s August 8 morning flight to London was 
abruptly canceled due to technical problems with its 
remaining DC-10.  More than 50 stranded travelers besieged 
Ghana Air\'s headquarters and refused to let airline staff 
depart.  Local press referred to it as a hostage situation, 
but Ghana police and security forces, along with officials 
from the airline and Ministry of Roads and Transport, quickly 
defused the situation.  According to Sarpong, Ghana Air has 
grounded the DC-10 indefinitely and is seeking other means of 
transporting the stranded passengers to London.  (Comment: 
Ghana Air is negotiating with Jordanian Air to lease a Boeing 
767 to handle its European routes.  End Comment). 
 
FAA Request to Assess GoG Safety Oversight 
------------------------------------------ 
7. (SBU) Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) finally 
responded to Ref A demarche regarding the FAA request to 
perform a comprehensive reassessment of the GCAA\'s (and 
GoG\'s) safety oversight.  Post has faxed the GCAA\'s written 
response to FAA Rep in Dakar and to Department.  Although FAA 
asked to perform the reassessment within 45 days, GCAA 
Director General, Captain Joe Boachie, has requested a delay 
to mid October or later.  He argues that the new Civil 
Aviation Law will redress many of the FAA\'s concerns, but 
Parliament will not meet to vote on it until early September. 
 Under this timetable, the law would go into effect in late 
September.  Boachie also points out that key GCAA personnel, 
whose presence would be required for the assessment, plan to 
attend the ICAO Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program and 
General Assembly meetings in Montreal, Canada, in September 
(Ref B). 
 
GoG Official Visit to Washington 
-------------------------------- 
8. (SBU) Roads and Transport Minister Dr. Richard Anane has 
indicated a desire to head an official delegation to the U.S. 
to meet with State, DOT, and FAA officials.  The purpose of 
the visit would be to arrange (or finalize) an agreement to 
allow Ghana Air to continue with regular service to the U.S., 
either by continuing with wet-leased aircraft or with its own 
aircraft.  GCAA Director General Captain Joe Boachie and 
Ghana Air Acting CEO Ms. Akua Sarpong would accompany the 
Minister.  Sarpong told Econoff August 10 that the visit is 
on hold pending discussions between Ghana Air\'s lawyers in 
the U.S. and DOT.  (Comment:  In conversations with Econoffs, 
Sarpong has informally requested assistance to improve safety 
standards at Ghana Air and also to get re-authorization to 
fly U.S. routes.  Econoffs pointed out that Post is not the 
appropriate USG entity to handle such requests, and urged 
Sarpong to approach DOT and FAA directly with specific 
assistance requests.  End Comment)

SUBJECT: GHANA INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT -- AUGUST 2004 
UPDATE 
 
REF: A. STATE 141379 
 
     B. 2003 ACCRA 1804 
 
Post is pleased to provide below the mid-year (August) 2004 
update of the Investment Climate Statement for Ghana. 
 
A.1.  Openness to Foreign Investment 
 
Attracting foreign direct investment remains a key objective 
of Ghana\'s economic recovery program, which started in 1983 
under the auspices of the World Bank and the IMF.  President 
Kufuor, who was inaugurated in January 2001, continues to 
encourage foreign investment as an integral part of Ghana\'s 
economic policy.  In his inaugural address he announced, 
\"Ghana is open for business,\" and welcomed foreign investors. 
 
 
As part of his commitment to attracting foreign investment, 
the President relies on advice from the Ghana Investment 
Advisory Council (GIAC), which was established with the help 
of the World Bank.  The 30-member GIAC, which consists of 
multinational and local companies and institutional observers 
(IMF, WB, UNDP), helps shape government policy to create an 
enabling investment environment. 
 
Ghana promotes foreign investment by sending investment 
missions abroad and hosting investment-soliciting events in 
Ghana, including the fifth African/African-American Summit in 
May 1999 and the third Pan African Investment Summit in 
September 1999.  Both generated renewed interest in Ghana. 
 
Ghana embarked on a privatization program in the early 1990s 
that has resulted in the sale of more than 300 of 
approximately 350 state-owned enterprises.  Foreign firms 
comprise most of the bidders for these businesses.  Few local 
investors have sufficient capital to participate in this 
process except as partners with foreign firms. 
 
The Divestiture Implementation Committee is the government 
institution that oversees the privatization of these 
enterprises.  Actual divestiture is usually done through a 
bidding process, and bids are evaluated on the basis of 
criteria including management skills, financial resources, 
and business plans.  New owners are expected to build the 
enterprises into profitable, productive ventures, which 
contribute to tax revenue and increase local employment. 
While there has only been one new divestiture during its 
tenure, the Kufuor administration has publicly stated its 
support for continuing the privatization program. 
 
The Government of Ghana (GoG) recognizes that attracting 
foreign direct investment requires an enabling legal 
environment, and has passed laws that encourage foreign 
investment and replaced some that previously stifled it.  The 
Ghana Investment Promotion Center (GIPC) Act, 1994 (Act 478), 
governs investment in all sectors of the economy except 
minerals and mining, oil and gas, and the free zones. 
Sector-specific laws further regulate banking, non-banking 
financial institutions, insurance, fishing, securities, and 
real estate.  Foreign investors are required to satisfy the 
provisions of the investment act as well as the provisions of 
sector-specific laws.  Generally, the GIPC has streamlined 
procedures and reduced delays.  More information on investing 
in Ghana can be obtained from GIPC\'s website, www.gipc.org.gh. 
 
The GIPC law also applies to foreign investment in 
acquisitions, mergers, takeovers and new investments, as well 
as to portfolio investment in stocks, bonds, and other 
securities traded on the Ghana Stock Exchange. 
 
The GIPC law specifies areas of investment reserved for 
Ghanaians, such as small-scale trading, operation of taxi 
services (except when a non-Ghanaian has a minimum fleet of 
10 vehicles), pool betting businesses and lotteries (except 
soccer pools), beauty salons and barber shops.  The law 
further spells out incentives and guarantees that relate to 
taxation, transfer of capital, profits and dividends, and 
guarantees against expropriation. 
 
Since the enactment of the GIPC law, the GoG has ceased 
screening investments.  The GIPC registers investments and 
provides all the necessary assistance to enable investors to 
become established.  The GoG has no overall economic or 
industrial strategy that discriminates against foreign-owned 
businesses.  In some cases a foreign investment can enjoy 
additional incentives if the project is deemed critical to 
the country\'s development.  U.S. and other foreign firms are 
able to participate in government-financed and/or research 
and development programs on a national treatment basis. 
 
The only pre-condition for investment in Ghana is financial. 
The GIPC requires foreign investors to satisfy a minimum 
capital requirement.  Once this is met and all necessary 
documents submitted, investments are supposed to be 
registered within five working days.  However, according to a 
June 2003 report by the Foreign Investment Advisory Service 
(FIAS), the actual time required for registration can be 
significantly higher (sometimes three to four times) than the 
required time.  Although registration is relatively easy, the 
entire process of establishing a business in Ghana is 
lengthy, complex, and requires compliance with regulations 
and procedures of at least 5 government agencies.  These 
agencies are:  GIPC, Registrar General Department, Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS), Ghana Immigration Service, and Social 
Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT).  This 
processing period often extends up to 100 days. 
Nevertheless, GoG reforms in this area have yielded some 
returns.  The World Bank announced in a March 2004 report 
that Ghana\'s \"Time to Start a Business\" had improved by 34 
percent, from 129 to 85 days. 
 
The minimum capital required for foreign investors is USD 
10,000 (for joint ventures with a Ghanaian) or USD 50,000 
(for enterprises wholly-owned by a non-Ghanaian).  Trading 
companies either wholly or partly-owned by non-Ghanaians 
require a minimum foreign equity of USD 300,000 and must 
employ at least ten Ghanaians.  This may be satisfied through 
remitting convertible foreign currency to a bank in Ghana or 
by importing goods into Ghana for the purpose of the 
investment.  The minimum capital requirement is, however, not 
applicable to portfolio investment, enterprises set up for 
export trading, and branch offices. 
 
The principal law regulating investment in minerals and 
mining is the Minerals and Mining Law, 1986 (PNDCL 153) as 
amended by the Minerals and Mining Amendment Act, 1994 (Act 
475).  This law regulates investment in mining, except for 
small-scale mining, which is reserved for Ghanaians.  It 
addresses different types of mineral rights, issues relating 
to incentives and guarantees, and land ownership.  The 
Minerals Commission is the government agency that implements 
the law. 
 
The Petroleum Exploration and Production Law, 1984 (PNDCL 
84), known as the Petroleum Law, regulates oil and gas 
exploration and production in Ghana.  The law deals 
extensively with petroleum contracts, the rights, duties, 
responsibilities of contractors, and compensation payable to 
those affected by activities in the petroleum sector.  The 
Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) is the government 
institution that administers this law.  Several U.S. 
companies are involved in oil/gas exploration in Ghana at 
present. 
 
There are no major sectors in which American investors are 
denied the same treatment as other foreign investors.  There 
are, however, some areas where foreign investors as a whole 
are denied national treatment.  Those sectors are real estate 
(non-Ghanaians may not own an interest in land for more than 
fifty years), banking, securities, and fishing. 
 
A.2.  Conversion and Transfer Policies 
 
Ghana operates a free-floating exchange rate policy regime. 
There are no restrictions on the conversion and transfer of 
funds with documented evidence to support how the funds were 
gained.  Ghana\'s local currency, the cedi, can be exchanged 
for dollars and major European currencies. 
 
Ghana\'s hard currency needs are met largely through gold and 
cocoa export revenues, donor assistance, and private 
remittances.  The fall in the world prices of these 
commodities in 1999 and increases in oil import bills led to 
a foreign currency shortage in 2000 and subsequent, large 
depreciation of the Cedi.  The Cedi has been less volatile 
since early 2001 and stable since November 2002. 
 
Ghana has no restrictions on the transfer of funds associated 
with investment.  Ghana\'s investment laws guarantee that 
investors can transfer the following in convertible currency 
out of Ghana:  dividends or net profits attributable to the 
investment; payments in respect of loan servicing where a 
foreign loan has been obtained; fees and charges in respect 
to technology transfer agreements registered under the GIPC 
law; and, the remittance of proceeds from the sale or 
liquidation of the enterprise or any interest attributable to 
the investment. 
 
With regard to offshore loans, the Bank of Ghana, Ghana\'s 
central bank, must approve the loan agreement.  The Bank of 
Ghana inspects the terms of the loan, especially the interest 
rate, to see if it conforms to going international rates. 
There is no legal parallel remittance market for investors. 
A.3.  Expropriation and Compensation 
 
Ghana\'s investment laws provide guarantees against 
expropriation and nationalization, although the 1992 
Constitution provides some exceptions to these laws.  While 
providing protection from deprivation of property, the 
Constitution sets out the exceptions and a clear procedure 
for the payment of compensation. 
The GoG may compulsorily take possession or acquire property 
only where the acquisition is in the interest of national 
defense, public safety, public order, public morality, public 
health, town and country planning or the development or 
utilization of property in a manner to promote public 
benefit.  It must, however, make provision for the prompt 
payment of fair and adequate compensation.  The GoG also 
allows access to the high court by any person who has an 
interest or right over the property. 
 
There has been no expropriatory action in recent times, and 
American investors have not been subject to differential or 
discriminatory treatment in Ghana.  There are no known 
instances of \"creeping expropriation,\" and there is no 
pattern of government action that constitutes de facto 
expropriation. 
 
A.4.  Dispute Settlement 
 
There are currently several commercial disputes involving 
U.S. companies, specifically in the areas of aluminum 
smelting, electric power, rice production, and 
telecommunications.  The GoG is trying to settle some of 
these problems, but several remain unresolved.  Contracts 
signed under the previous government have come under renewed 
scrutiny by President Kufuor\'s government. 
 
Ghana\'s legal system is based on British common law.  The 
most important exception for the purpose of investment is the 
acquisition of interest in land, which is governed by both 
statutory and customary law. 
 
The judiciary comprises both the lower courts and the 
superior courts.  The superior courts are the Supreme Court, 
the Court of Appeal, and the High Court.  Lawsuits are 
permitted and usually begin in the High Court.  There is a 
history of government intervention in the court system, 
although somewhat less so in commercial matters.  The courts 
have, when the circumstances require, entered judgment 
against the government.  For example, the Supreme Court 
dismissed an application filed by the government in a case 
that involved an American agricultural trading company. 
However, the courts have been slow in disposing of cases and 
at times face challenges in enforcing decisions, largely due 
to resource constraints and institutional inefficiencies. 
There is a growing interest in alternative dispute 
resolution, especially as it applies to commercial cases. 
The Attorney General\'s office has drafted enabling 
legislation and several lawyers are providing arbitration 
and/or conciliation services. 
 
The government has established \"fast-track\" courts to 
expedite action on some cases.  The \"fast track\" courts, 
which are automated (computerized) divisions of the High 
Court of Judicature, were intended to try cases to conclusion 
within six months.  However, there are indications that these 
courts are increasingly not able to try cases within this 
target time period.  These courts are authorized to hear 
cases which involve banks and investors, human rights, 
electoral petitions, government revenue, prerogative writs, 
defamation, specified commercial and industrial cases, and 
criminal cases involving substantial public money or are a 
matter of extreme public importance.  The government has 
automated the High Courts in Accra, Kumasi, and Sekondi, with 
10 other courts in process. 
 
Enforcement of foreign judgments in Ghana is based on the 
doctrine of reciprocity.  On this basis, judgments from 
Brazil, France, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Senegal, 
Spain, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom are 
enforceable.  Judgments from the United States are not 
enforceable in Ghana at this time. 
 
The GIPC Law as well as the Minerals and Mining Law address 
dispute settlement procedures and provide for arbitration 
when disputes cannot be settled by other means.  They also 
provide for referral of disputes to arbitration in accordance 
with the rules of procedure of the United Nations Commission 
on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), or within the 
framework of a bilateral agreement between Ghana and the 
investor\'s country. 
 
The U.S. has signed three bilateral trade and investment 
agreements with Ghana: the Investment Incentive Agreement, 
the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, and the Open 
Skies Agreement.  These agreements contain some provision for 
investment and trade dispute settlement.  Where the parties 
do not agree on a venue for arbitration, the investor\'s 
choice prevails.  In this regard, Ghana accepts as binding 
the international arbitration of investment disputes.  Ghana 
does not have a bankruptcy statute.  The Companies Code of 
1963, however, provides for official closure of a company 
when it is unable to pay its debts. 
 
In 1996, the privately managed Ghana Arbitration Center was 
established to strengthen the legal framework for protecting 
commercial and economic interests, and to bolster investors\' 
confidence in Ghana.  The American Chamber of Commerce\'s 
(Ghana) Commercial Conciliation Center provides arbitration 
services on trade and investment issues. 
 
Ghana signed and ratified the Convention on the Settlement of 
Investment Disputes in 1966.  Ghana is also a signatory and 
contracting state of the UN Convention on the Recognition and 
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the \"New York 
Convention\"). 
 
A.5.  Performance Requirements and Incentives 
 
Ghana is in compliance with WTO Trade-Related Investment 
Measures (TRIMS) notification. 
 
Generally, Ghana does not have performance requirements for 
establishing, maintaining, and expanding a business. 
However, in its privatization of state-owned enterprises, 
notably the telecommunications sector, companies have to meet 
performance targets or they may have their licenses revoked. 
In the case of banks, the opening of branches requires 
approval from the central bank.  Investors are not required 
to purchase from local sources.  Except for free zone 
enterprises operating under the Free Zone Act, which are 
required to export 70 percent of their products, investors 
are not required to export a specified percentage of their 
output. 
 
Foreign investors are not required by law to have local 
partners except in the fishing, insurance, and mining 
industries.  In the tuna-fishing industry, non-Ghanaians may 
own a maximum of seventy-five percent of the interest in a 
tuna-fishing vessel.  In the insurance sector, a non-Ghanaian 
cannot own more than sixty percent of an insurance company. 
In the case of the Ghana Stock Exchange, a single foreign 
investor cannot own more than ten percent of any security 
listed.  This applies to individuals as well as institutional 
investors.  The total holding of all foreigners in a listed 
security cannot exceed seventy-four percent.  There is 
compulsory local participation in the minerals and mining 
sector.  By law, the GoG acquires ten percent of all 
interests in mining ventures at no cost. 
 
There are no requirements on physical location of 
investments.  However, there are tax incentives to encourage 
investment in specific locations.  There are also no import 
substitution restrictions, but there is an export quota of 
seventy percent for companies operating under the Free Zone 
Act.  The only requirement for compulsory employment of 
Ghanaians is that any investment in a trading enterprise must 
employ a minimum of ten Ghanaians. 
 
There are regulations relating to the transfer of technology 
when it is not freely available in Ghana and where the 
transfer will exceed eighteen months.  The transfer of 
technology is governed by an agreement under the Technology 
Transfer Regulations of Ghana.  Any provisions in the 
agreement inconsistent with Ghanaian regulations are 
unenforceable in Ghana. 
 
Investment incentives differ slightly depending upon the law 
under which an investor operates.  For example, while all 
investors operating under the Free Zone Act are entitled to a 
ten-year corporate tax holiday, investors operating under the 
GIPC law are not automatically entitled to a tax holiday, 
depending upon the sector in which they are operating. 
 
All investment-specific laws contain some investment 
incentives. The GIPC law allows for import and tax exemptions 
for plant, machinery (and parts thereof) imported for the 
purpose of the investment.  Specifically, chapters 82, 84, 
85, and 89 of the customs harmonized commodity and tariff 
code zero-rates (i.e., does not levy import duty) some plant, 
machinery, and parts thereof.  An import duty rate of 5 
percent was recently imposed on some items that were 
previously zero-rated.  The GIPC website (www.gipc.org.gh) 
provides a more thorough description of incentive programs. 
The law also guarantees the investor all the tax incentives 
provided for under Ghanaian law.  For example, rental income 
from commercial and residential property for the first five 
years after construction is exempt from tax.  Similarly, 
income from a company selling or letting out premises is 
income tax exempt for the first five years of operation. 
Rural banks and cattle ranching are exempted from income tax 
for 10 years. 
 
The corporate tax rate is 32.5 percent (the GoG has proposed 
a reduction to 30 percent, effective January 2005) for all 
sectors except: income from non-traditional exports (8 
percent), income from hotels (25 percent), and income earned 
by companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange (30 percent). 
 For some sectors there are tax holidays for a number of 
years.  These sectors include, free zone enterprises and 
developers (zero percent for the first 10 years and 8 percent 
thereafter), real estate development and rental (zero percent 
for the first 5 years and 32.5 percent thereafter), 
agro-processing companies (zero percent for the first 5 years 
and after the five years the tax rate ranges from 0 to 30 
percent depending on the location of the company in Ghana), 
and waste processing companies (zero percent for 7 years and 
32.5 percent thereafter).  Tax rebates are also offered in 
the form of incentives based on location.  A capital 
allowance in the form of an accelerated depreciation 
allowance is also applicable in all sectors except banking, 
finance, commerce, insurance, mining, and petroleum. 
 
The Ghanaian tax system is replete with tax concessions that 
make the effective tax rate generally low.  The incentives 
are specified in the GIPC law and are not applied in an ad 
hoc or arbitrary manner.  The GIPC has no discretion and once 
the investor has been registered under the GIPC law, the 
investor is entitled to the incentives provided by law.  The 
GIPC, however, has discretion if an investor is seeking 
additional customs duty exemptions and tax incentives. 
 
A 12.5 percent VAT is levied on most imports, all consumer 
purchases, services, accommodation in hotels and guest 
houses, food in restaurants, hotels and snack bars, as well 
as advertising, betting and entertainment. The VAT collection 
rate will be 15 percent, starting August 1, 2004, with the 
implementation of the 2.5 percent Health Insurance Levy. 
 
Ghana has no discriminatory or excessively onerous visa 
requirements.  An investor who invests under the GIPC law is 
automatically entitled to a specific number of visas/work 
permits based on the size of the investment.  When an 
investment of USD 10,000 or its equivalent is made in 
convertible currency or machinery and equipment, the 
enterprise can obtain a visa/work permit for one expatriate 
employee.  An investment of USD 10,000 to USD 100,000 
entitles the enterprise to two automatic visas/work permits. 
An investment of USD 500,000 and above allows an enterprise 
to bring in four expatriate employees.  An enterprise may 
apply for extra visas/work permits, but the investor must 
justify why a foreigner must be employed rather than a 
Ghanaian.  There are no restrictions on the issuance of work 
and residence permits to Free Zone investors and employees. 
 
Ghana has no import price controls.  It is pursuing a 
liberalized import regime policy within the framework and the 
spirit of the World Trade Organization to accelerate 
industrial growth. 
 
A.6.  Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
 
The laws of Ghana recognize the right of foreign and domestic 
private entities to own and operate business enterprises. 
Foreign entities are, however, prohibited by law from 
engaging in certain business activities in Ghana (see section 
1, paragraph 6). 
 
Private entities may freely acquire and dispose of their 
interests in Ghana.  When a foreign investor disposes of an 
interest in a business enterprise, the investor is entitled 
to repatriate his or her earnings in a freely convertible 
currency. 
 
Private and public enterprises compete on equal basis with 
respect to access to credit, markets, licenses, and supplies. 
 
A.7.  Protection of Property Rights 
 
The legal system recognizes and enforces secured interest in 
property, both chattel and real, but the issue of clear title 
over land has been a thorny one.  A thorough search at the 
Lands Commission to ascertain the identity of the true owner 
of any land being offered for sale is extremely important. 
Investors should be aware that land records are incomplete or 
non-existent and, therefore, clear title may be impossible to 
establish. 
 
Mortgages exist in Ghana and are regulated by the Mortgages 
Decree.  They are enforced by judicial sale upon application 
to the court.  A mortgage must be registered under the Land 
Title Registration Law, a requirement that is mandatory for 
it to take effect.  Registration with the Land Title Registry 
is a reliable system of recording the transaction. 
 
The protection of intellectual property is an evolving area 
of law.  Progress has been made in recent years to afford 
protection under both local and international law.  Ghana is 
a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO) and the English-speaking African Regional Industrial 
Property Organization (ESARIPO).  The courts have been 
pro-active in the protection of intellectual property rights. 
 Steps are being taken to implement the WTO TRIPS 
(Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) 
Agreement.  All TRIPS-compliant legislation, except the 
Copyright bill, has been passed by Parliament.  . 
 
A.8.  Transparency of the Regulatory System 
 
The policy of trade liberalization and investment promotion 
adopted by the GoG is guiding its effort to create a clear 
and transparent regulatory system.  There has been some 
effort to repeal laws that impede and distort investment, and 
the frequency of labor disputes in recent years has spurred 
review of labor laws.  Parliament passed a new Labor Law in 
July 2003, which reportedly will reduce the incidence of 
labor disputes.  The law went into effect in March 2004. 
 
The GIPC law codified the GoG\'s desire to present foreign 
investors with a liberal and transparent foreign investment 
regulatory regime.  To this end, the Ghana Investment 
Promotion Center has established a \"one-stop shop\" to 
eliminate the bureaucratic bottlenecks for investors.  Under 
the Ghana Trade and Investment Gateway (GHATIG) Program, time 
frames within which government officials must perform 
specific duties have been set and are constantly being 
monitored.  Implementation, however, has not always measured 
up to desired standards. 
 
The GoG has established regulatory bodies such as the 
National Communications Authority, the Energy Commission, and 
the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission to oversee 
activities in the liberalized telecommunications, power and 
water sectors.  These bodies are relatively new and 
under-resourced, which limits their ability to deliver the 
intended level of oversight. 
 
A.9.  Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
 
Private sector growth in Ghana has been constrained by 
limited financing opportunities for private investment. 
Fifteen years after the beginning of financial sector reforms 
in 1988, much remains to be done.  Confidence in the 
financial sector has suffered because of policy interventions 
by the government, many of which have not facilitated the 
free flow of financial resources in the product and input 
markets.  Current high interest rates on bank loans (over 25 
percent) and treasury bills (17 percent) have been a serious 
impediment to raising capital on the local market. 
 
Some recent developments in the non-banking financial sector 
have been encouraging.  Among the non-banking financial 
institutions, leasing companies, building societies and 
savings and loan associations have been innovative in serving 
savers and borrowers.   In addition, the formulation of new 
regulatory policies for the Ghana Stock Exchange (which has 
25 listed companies and 2 corporate bonds at the present 
time, and oversees portfolio investment) has been promising. 
The Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) is still considered one of the 
best performing bourses in emerging markets.  It is open to 
all foreign buyers and subject to the restrictions described 
in section 7.5, paragraph 3.  Both foreign and local 
companies are allowed to list on the GSE.  The Securities 
Regulatory Commission regulates the activities on the 
Exchange. 
 
Banks in Ghana are relatively small.  The largest in the 
country, Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB), has a net worth of 
approximately USD 50 million.  Out of the 18 banks in Ghana, 
the GoG has a partial ownership position in GCB and fully 
owns two other banks.  The GoG is still reviewing options 
regarding divestiture of its remaining interest in GCB. 
 
Although Ghana\'s informal financial sector is large, with an 
estimated 45 percent of all private sector financial savings 
mobilized initially through informal channels, its capacity 
to serve as an intermediary between savers and investors has 
been limited.  This is due in part to Ghanaians\' savings 
behavior (not using the formal banking system), and in part 
to the absence of strong links with the formal sector. 
 
A.10.  Political Violence 
 
Overall, Ghana offers a relatively stable and predictable 
political environment for American investors.  There is no 
indication at present that the level of political risk in 
Ghana will change markedly over the near term.  Peaceful and 
fair presidential and parliamentary elections were held in 
December 2000.  The main opposition party, the National 
Patriotic Party, led by President John Agyekum Kufuor, won 
the elections.  This was the first time in Ghana\'s history in 
which power passed peacefully from one civilian government to 
another through the ballot box.  Presidential and 
Parliamentary elections will be held on December 7, 2004. 
 
A.11.  Corruption 
 
Corruption in Ghana is somewhat less prevalent than in other 
countries in the region, and no U.S. firms have identified 
corruption as the major obstacle to foreign direct 
investment.  Companies cannot expect complete transparency in 
locally funded contracts, however.  A 2003 Transparency 
International global corruption ranking placed Ghana 70th out 
of 133 countries in its Corruption Perceptions Index.  Of 
sub-Saharan countries included in the survey, Ghana rated 
fifth least corrupt country, following Botswana, Namibia, 
Mauritius, and South Africa. 
 
Ghana is not a signatory to the OECD Convention on Combating 
Bribery.  It has, however, taken steps to amend laws on 
public financial administration and public procurement.  The 
public procurement law, passed in January 2004, seeks to 
harmonize the many public procurement guidelines used in the 
country and also bring public procurement into conformity 
with WTO standards.  The new law aims to improve 
accountability, value for money, transparency and efficiency 
in the use of public resources.   A Freedom of Information 
bill developed by civil society may also be passed to allow 
access to public information. 
 
American businesses have reported being asked for \"favors\" in 
the past.  It is easy to make friends in Ghana who can 
facilitate business transactions.  In return, these friends 
may ask for favors, some of which may conflict with U.S. 
business ethics or laws.  U.S. business visitors should make 
clear that U.S. companies operating abroad are subject to the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. 
 
Commercial fraud in the form of scams, especially in gold or 
currency deals, is on the rise in Ghana.  These are commonly 
termed \"419\" scams.  While these cases are exceptions and not 
the rule to doing business in Ghana, U.S. potential gold 
buyers are strongly advised to deal directly with the 
Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC) in Ghana.  Gold 
can be exported from Ghana only through the PMMC.  U.S. firms 
can request a background check on companies and individuals 
with whom they wish to do business, using the U.S. Foreign 
Commercial Service\'s International Company Profile (ICP) 
Service.  Requests should be made through the nearest U.S. 
Department of Commerce U.S. Export Assistance Office.  For 
more information, visit www.export.gov/cs. 
 
The GoG has publicly committed to ensuring that government 
officials do not use their positions to enrich themselves. 
Official salaries are modest, especially for low-level 
government employees.  GoG employees frequently ask 
applicants for licenses and permits for a \"dash\" (tip). 
 
The 1992 Constitution provided for the establishment of a 
Commission On Human Rights and Administrative Justice 
(CHRAJ).  Among other things, the Commission is charged with 
investigating all instances of alleged and suspected 
corruption and the misappropriation of public funds by 
officials, and to take appropriate steps, including providing 
reports to the Attorney-General and the Auditor-General, in 
response to such investigations. The Commission has a mandate 
to prosecute alleged offenders when there is sufficient 
evidence to initiate legal actions. 
In 1998, the GoG also established an anti-corruption 
institution, called the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), to 
investigate corrupt practices involving both private and 
public institutions.  SFO\'s 1999 report to the President and 
Parliament reported cases of economic fraud that resulted in 
over USD 2 million in losses to the country.  The SFO has 
called for a national debate on how to deal with largesse 
acquired through economic crimes since the present punishment 
of dismissal and imprisonment is an inadequate deterrent. 
The GoG has announced plans to streamline the roles of the 
CHRAJ and SFO, in order to remove their duplication of 
efforts. 
 
President Kufuor has declared a \"zero tolerance\" for 
corruption.  He has established an Office of Accountability 
to oversee the performance of senior government 
functionaries.  Several corruption prosecutions are underway 
against former officials of the Rawlings administration, and 
a former minister is now in jail.  Two other ministers are 
also in jail for their role in causing financial loss to the 
state.  Cabinet Ministers recently approved \"Whistle Blowers\" 
legislation for Parliament action, to encourage Ghanaian 
citizens to volunteer information on corrupt practices to 
appropriate agencies. 
 
B.  Bilateral Investment Agreements 
 
Ghana has bilateral investment agreements with the following 
countries: the United Kingdom, Republic of China, Romania, 
Denmark, and Switzerland.  These agreements, which were 
signed and ratified between 1989 and 1992, normally run for 
ten years.  Italy and France are currently negotiating 
similar arrangements.  Agreements with Germany, India, 
Pakistan, South Korea, North Korea, and Belgium are being 
considered.  The U.S. signed three trade agreements between 
1998 and 2000: the OPIC Investment Incentive Agreement, the 
Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), and the Open 
Skies Agreement. 
 
Ghana has met eligibility requirements to participate in the 
benefits afforded by the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
(AGOA), and also qualified for the apparel benefits under 
AGOA. 
 
C.  OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs 
 
OPIC is active in Ghana and OPIC officers visit Ghana 
periodically to meet with representatives of prominent 
American and Ghanaian firms.  OPIC launched the Modern Africa 
Growth Fund and the Africa Infrastructure Investment Fund, 
which are sources of information and financing for investment 
in Ghana.  The African Project Development Facility (APDF) 
and the African investment program of the International 
Finance Corporation are other sources of information.  Ghana 
is a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 
(MIGA). 
 
D.  Labor 
 
Ghana has a large pool of inexpensive, unskilled labor. 
English is widely spoken, especially in urban areas.  Labor 
regulations and policies are generally favorable to business. 
 Labor-management relations are fairly good. 
 
The new Labor law (Act 651) passed in 2003 became effective 
in March 2004.  The new law unifies and modifies the old 
labor laws to bring them into conformity with the core 
principles of the International Labor Convention, to which 
Ghana is a signatory.  All the old labor related laws, except 
the Children\'s law (Act 560), have been repealed. 
 
Under the new Labor Law, the Chief Labor Officer will now 
issue collective bargaining agreements (CBA) in lieu of the 
Trade Union Congress (TUC).  This effectively limits the 
TUC\'s monopoly, since the old CBA provisions implicitly 
compelled all unions to be part of TUC.  Also, instead of the 
labor court, a National Labor Commission has been established 
which will be the medium for resolving labor and industrial 
issues.  Finally, the Tripartite Committee that determines 
the minimum daily wage now has legal backing and public and 
private employment centers can be created to help job seekers 
find work. 
 
There is no legal requirement for labor participation in 
management.  However, joint consultative committees in which 
management and employees meet to discuss issues affecting 
business productivity are common. 
There are no statutory requirements for profit sharing, but 
fringe benefits in the form of year-end bonuses and 
retirement benefits are generally included in collective 
bargaining agreements. 
 
Consulting a local attorney with regard to labor issues is 
recommended.  The U.S. Consulate in Accra maintains a list of 
local attorneys, which is available upon request. 
 
E.  Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports 
 
A Free Trade Zone was established in May 1996.  The free zone 
is a parcel of land near Tema Steelworks, Ltd., in the 
Greater Accra Region and two other sites located at Mpintsin 
and Ashiem, near Takoradi.  The seaports of Tema and 
Takoradi, as well as the Kotoka International Airport, and 
all the lands related to these areas are a part of the free 
zone.  The law also permits the establishment of single 
factory zones outside or within the areas mentioned above. 
Under the law, a company qualifies to be a free zone company 
if it exports more than 70 percent of its products.  Among 
the incentives for free zone companies are a ten-year 
corporate tax holiday and zero duty on its imports. 
 
To make it easy for free zone developers to acquire the 
various licenses and permits to operate, the Ghana Free Zones 
Board provides a \"one-stop approval service\" to assist in the 
completion of all formalities.  A lack of resources has 
limited the effectiveness of the Board, however.  To further 
facilitate operations in the zones, nationals of OECD 
countries, Canada, East Asian countries and the Republic of 
South Africa can, with advance notice, obtain entry visas at 
the airport.  However, all foreign employees of businesses 
established under the program will require work and residence 
permits.

F.  Major Foreign Investors in Ghana 
 
Major foreign investments in Ghana are mainly in mining and 
manufacturing.  Britain is Ghana\'s main foreign investor with 
direct investment exceeding USD 750 million.  Major U.S. 
investors are Volta Aluminum Co. (VALCO) Ltd., owned by 
Kaiser Aluminum and Alcoa, CMS Energy (independent power 
producer), Regimanuel Gray Limited (housing and 
construction), Boeing, Coca-Cola Company, Affiliated Computer 
Services (data processing), Pioneer Foods (Star-Kist tuna), 
Phyto-Riker (pharmaceuticals), Millicom (telecommunications) 
and Western Wireless (telecommunications).  There has been 
recent interest by American companies in acquisition of 
state-owned communications and manufacturing firms slated for 
divestiture, as well as new investments in the 
telecommunications and agricultural sectors.  Also, Newmont 
Mining announced a large investment in 2004. 
 
There are significant investments by other foreign nationals 
made through the GoG privatization program.  These include 
Norwegian interests in Ghana Cement Works (GHACEM), a cement 
manufacturing plant; Bau Nord AG (IBN), a Swiss company and 
the GoG-owned GAFCO; Walter Schroeder, a German company, and 
the GoG-owned West Africa Mills; Telekom Malaysia and Ghana 
Telecom.  South African and Australian companies are active 
in the mining sector. 
 
G.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Statistics 
 
FDI statistics in Ghana tend to be unreliable since the 
promotion and monitoring of FDI in Ghana are carried out by 
several agencies without coordination in arriving at a total 
figure. 
 
Since 1994, however, the Ghana Investment Promotion Center 
(GIPC) has registered over 1281 projects.  GIPC provided the 
following statistics on registered private investments, which 
exclude mining, petroleum and free zones investments. 
 
Foreign direct investment (FDI) (USD million) 
1994 Sep ) 1999 Dec   1,205.46 
2000                   114.91 
2001                    89.32 
2002                    58.93 
2003                    88.06 
2004 (Jan ) Mar)        20.52 
 
*** These figures do not include investments in the mining 
and petroleum industries, which are the major recipients of 
FDI. 
 
Between September 1994 and March 2004, the U.S. ranked fifth 
in terms of number of investment projects (120) after Britain 
(164), India (155), China (141), and Lebanon (122).  The 
services and manufacturing sectors recorded the highest 
number of investment projects.

Developments in Economic, Trade or Investment Policy 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
2. 2003 was a good year for Ghana\'s economy, mainly due to 
sound macroeconomic policies and high cocoa and gold prices. 
Ghana is succeeding in getting the budget under control, 
improving transparency and accountability in its use of 
public resources, and is maintaining fiscal discipline as its 
top economic priority.  Real GDP growth was 5.2 percent for 
2003, up from 4.5 percent in 2002.  The cedi is stable, 
foreign exchange reserves surpassed USD 1 billion, inflation 
is falling, as are interest rates, and Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) flows through June 2003 exceeded FDI for all 
of 2002. 
 
3. Standard and Poor\'s acknowledged the GoG\'s commitment to 
sound economic management in September 2003, when it assigned 
Ghana a \"B-plus\" sovereign credit rating.  Standard and 
Poor\'s based this rating on Ghana\'s macroeconomic performance 
and reforms, political and social stability, and the 
substantial debt reduction expected under the Highly Indebted 
Poor Country (HIPC) initiative.  Fitch Rating Agency 
simultaneously rated Ghana\'s sovereign credit at \"B\" with a 
positive outlook. 
 
4. Ghana reached HIPC completion point in July 2004, and will 
realize significant budgetary savings as a result.  Total 
debt forgiveness from IMF, World Bank, ADB and official 
creditors will exceed USD 3.5 billion.  As one of the few 
stable, democratic countries in the region, Ghana is 
increasingly seen as a gateway to West Africa and a hub for 
international business, NGOs and international organizations. 
 
 
Developments in Major Regional Groupings 
---------------------------------------- 
5. Ghana is participating in talks on the ECOWAS Common 
External Tariff (CET), which is based on the existing CET 
shared by the eight member states of the predominantly 
francophone West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). 
 The CET is supposed to go into effect January 1, 2005, with 
each country phasing in new tariff levels over three years so 
that all ECOWAS member states have harmonized tariff 
structures by December 31, 2007. 
 
5. Although the CET treaty was originally signed by ECOWAS 
heads of state in 1975, and revised in 1993, the process was 
resuscitated by the EU\'s declaration that it will only 
negotiate trade agreements with or disburse European 
Development Funds to regional groups after 2007, not 
individual countries.  Under the new Cotonou Agreement, the 
negotiation of WTO-compatible new trading arrangements 
between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) 
countries must be completed by 2008.  The European Commission 
proposes that regional reciprocal free trade agreements 
replace the current non-reciprocal preferences in the trade 
relations between the EU and ACP countries.  The next round 
of CET negotiations will take place in September. 
 
6. The West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ), comprised of Ghana, 
Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, remains committed 
to launch the West African Common Currency -- ECO -- in July 
2005.  Before this happens, the countries and the West 
African Monetary Institute must first finalize and implement 
plans for statistical harmonization, currency unification and 
West African Central Bank operations.  The countries must 
also meet four preconditions:  single-digit inflation, budget 
deficits under 4 percent of GDP, foreign exchange reserves 
covering over three months\' exports, and domestic debt 
limited to 10 percent of tax revenue.  The West African 
Central Bank, based in Accra, will manage the single monetary 
policy and pooled foreign reserves, and will work to maintain 
price stability. 
 
7. WAMZ\'s goals in introducing the ECO are to create a larger 
regional market, increase cross-border trade and investment, 
achieve lower inflation and stable prices in response to good 
monetary policy and financial discipline, maintain stable 
exchange rates, and attract FDI.  Although donors are 
skeptical about the attainability of the July 2005 launch 
date, they support the process because it provides stronger 
external discipline to fiscal policy. 
PRIVATIZATION EFFORTS 
--------------------- 
8. Ghana embarked on a privatization program in the early 
1990s that resulted in the sale of more than 200 of 
approximately 300 state-owned enterprises.  The GoG\'s 
privatization program stalled due to political sensitivities 
surrounding certain industries, lack of legitimate partners 
for divestiture, and the inefficiencies and management 
concerns that render some industries less appealing.  Refer 
to Refs B, C and D for reporting on Ghana Commercial Bank 
divestiture, water privatization efforts and cocoa sector 
liberalization. 
 
GHANA AND AGOA 
-------------- 
9. Ghana\'s AGOA exports have increased rapidly, although 
overall trade to the U.S. has declined.  2003 AGOA exports 
were USD 40.6 million, compared to total exports to the U.S. 
of USD 83.6 million.  President Kufuor has announced several 
special initiatives ) including textiles and industrial 
starch -- aimed at taking advantage of AGOA, but they are 
thus far small in scale.  The GoG on occasion has extended 
beyond its regulatory mandate of ensuring compliance with 
AGOA regulations, and has sought to select specific companies 
to export under AGOA.  This has caused concern among private 
businesses opposed to government interference.  The 
USAID-funded West Africa Trade Hub is assisting Ghana and 
other countries in the region to take fuller advantage of 
AGOA. 
 
10. Ref E provides updated information for the President\'s 
2003 AGOA report.  Ref F, an AGOA Eligibility Review, 
provided more detailed accounts of AGOA-related trade and 
investment and GoG reform efforts.  Ref G discusses the 
potential impact in Ghana of ending the AGOA third country 
fabric provision. 
 
US TRADE CAPACITY BUILDING EFFORTS 
---------------------------------- 
11. USAID\'s West Africa Regional Program (WARP) provides 
technical assistance to both WAMZ Common Currency and ECOWAS 
Common External Tariff negotiations. 
 
12. In March 2003, the U.S. inaugurated the West African 
Trade Hub, which reinforces regional efforts to enhance trade 
competitiveness.  The USAID/WARP-financed Trade Hub focuses 
on enhancing the potential of West African producers to sell 
to the U.S. market under the Administration\'s Africa trade 
initiative, thereby permitting the region to take greater 
advantage of the increased trading opportunities provided 
through AGOA. 
 
13. The Global Trade and Technology Network (GTN) is a USAID 
funded program that links companies around the world through 
an electronic/internet-trading platform to establish 
international trade and business linkages in the form of 
joint ventures, direct sales or direct purchases, 
agent/distributorships, licensing and franchise agreements. 
 
14. Growth through Engendering Enterprise in ECOWAS Countries 
(ECOGEE) is a three-year USAID/WARP-funded project that began 
in September 2002.  ECOGEE supports West African women\'s 
efforts to overcome barriers to business development and 
regional trade. 
 
15. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) advances 
economic development and U.S. commercial interests in Ghana 
by funding various forms of technical assistance, feasibility 
studies, training, orientation visits and business workshops 
that support the development of a modern infrastructure and a 
fair and open trading environment 
 
16. West Africa International Business Linkages (WAIBL) is a 
USAID/WARP-funded program to increase commercial partnerships 
between U.S. and West African businesses.  These 
relationships can take many forms including export/import 
agreements, joint ventures, and equity partnerships. 
 
17. USAID/Ghana\'s Trade and Investment Reform Program (TIRP) 
is a 5-year activity aimed at improving the investment 
environment and technical/managerial capacity of Ghanaian 
enterprises, reforming regulations that adversely impact 
international competitiveness in sectors with the best export 
potential and promoting non-traditional exports, including 
tourism. 
 
18. USAID/WARP is supporting a USDA-APHIS advisor, to be 
based in Ghana and working in the West Africa region.  The 
advisor will work with WATH, ECOWAS, WAEMU, West African 
governments, and private businesses to assist agricultural 
producers in preparing their products for export to the U.S. 
market.  Such assistance will include the facilitation of the 
design and submission of Pest Risk Assessments, improving 
regional capacity to analyze plant health risks, augmenting 
the trade capacity of regional producers and governments, and 
the dissemination of information regarding U.S. regulations 
on the importation of agricultural goods and the Sanitary and 
Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) regulations of the U.S. and WTO. 
 
19. The USAID/WARP funded Market Information System project 
aims to enhance economic growth in West Africa through 
increased intra-regional trade in agricultural commodities 
and inputs.  This will be accomplished by strengthening 
networks of market information systems and traders\' 
organizations.  This activity will provide critical market 
information like commodity prices through radio broadcasts 
and mobile-phone subscriptions to traders and producers to 
spur trade.  The end result of this effort will be increased 
regional economic integration in West Africa through closer 
economic ties and improved food security. 
 
20. The Department of Treasury also participates in 
capacity-building assistance through the U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection, which in May 2003 conducted a customs 
operation and training needs assessment to assess Ghana\'s 
compliance with AGOA and identify areas that could benefit 
from additional training.  Treasury\'s Debt and Tax teams 
provide resident and intermittent advisors to the GoG.  The 
tax team provides management training to Ghana\'s IRS and VAT 
agencies, and assists with improving customer service and 
taxpayer assistance, expanding the taxpayer base and 
improving delinquent collections. 
 
21. The Treasury debt team\'s resident advisor supports and 
advises the Finance Ministry and Central Bank on domestic 
debt issues.  Projects have included coordinating with the 
rating agencies for Ghana\'s first sovereign credit ratings, 
revising government debt auction procedures, implementing a 
cash forecasting system for use by the GoG, and creating and 
introducing new debt securities to help with the transition 
to a more efficient capital market.  The debt team has also 
provided technical assistance to help design and implement a 
new central depository system for government securities and 
equities.

TAGS: EAIR, GH, aviation 
SUBJECT: PRESIDENT KUFUOR SACKS GHANA AIRWAYS BOARD OF 
DIRECTORS 
 
REF: ACCRA 1644 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. President Kufuor has dissolved The Board of Directors of 
Ghana Airways.  Citing management lapses and eroded public 
confidence, the President replaced the board with a task 
force to \"review and restructure\" the airline.  Meanwhile, 
DOT has extended limited economic authority to Ghana Airways 
for continued flights to the U.S. with wet-leased aircraft 
until August 30.  End Summary. 
 
2. In a press release dated August 12 the President\'s office 
named a four-person task force to run Ghana Airways.  The 
group consists of Gustave A. Mate Azu, Group Captain Frank 
Okyne, Mrs. Frances Adu-Mante and Kojo Andah. 
 
-- Gustave A. Mate Azu worked as a senior officer at KLM\'s 
Ghana office.  Sources say he served KLM for over 25 years 
and carries respectable credentials in the aviation industry. 
 He was described as a key player in reengineering KLM\'s 
operations in Ghana and West Africa. 
 
-- Group Captain Frank Okyne is a retired Ghana Air Force 
officer who served as CEO of Ghana Airways in the 1980\'s.  He 
is perceived as a professional, strong-willed and firm 
decision maker, quick to resist political interference.  One 
source claims he left Ghana Airways in the 1980\'s when he 
tired of political meddling at the airline. 
 
-- Mrs. Frances Adu Mante is a lawyer by profession and has 
worked with ECOBANK since 1989.  She also worked at the 
defunct Bank for Housing  & Construction (BHC) for 15 years. 
She is the wife of Mr. Robert Adu Mante, Financial Consultant 
to Senior Minister J.H. Mensah.  She is close to Minister of 
Finance Yaw Osafo Maafo, and her brother-in-law is the Acting 
Managing Director of Ghana Commercial Bank. 
 
-- Mr. Kojo Andan, a financial consultant, is credited with 
turning around the fortunes of the Department of National 
Lotteries (DNL).  Sales at DNL have increased from 2 billion 
cedis to 5 billion cedis since he became CEO. 
 
3. It is not clear what authority the task force has been 
given.  At this time Ghana Airways\' management structure 
remains intact and interim Chief Executive Akua Sarpong is in 
place.  Sarpong told Econoff the task force met with her and 
requested she continue to repatriate stranded customers and 
cease the sale of tickets for all destinations.  Since both 
of these points were made explicitly in the President\'s press 
release, it remains to be seen what action the task force 
will take. 
 
4. Sarpong also told Econoff that Ghana Air will continue to 
wet lease aircraft from World Airways at least until the 
newly extended DOT passenger repatriation deadline of August 
30.  Post will attempt to meet with task force members to 
reiterate the conditions of Ghana Air\'s limited economic 
authority and the conditions that must be met for Ghana Air 
to recommence ticket sales for U.S. routes.

TAGS: ELAB, PHUM, EIND, ETRD, SOCI, GH, AID 
SUBJECT: GHANA: UPDATE OF CHILD LABOR INFORMATION FOR 
MANDATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 163453 
 
1. This cable responds to the action in reftel to provide 
information on child labor for mandatory DOL reporting 
requirements. The information is presented in question/answer 
format based on the questions asked in reftel. 
 
2. Post\'s responses are as follows: 
 
a) Does the country have adequate laws and regulations 
proscribing the worst forms of child labor? 
 
Ghana ratified ILO Convention 182 on June 13, 2000, and 
passed the Children\'s Act in 1998. The Children\'s Act 
establishes a minimum age for employment and prohibitions on 
night work and hazardous labor and provides for fines and 
imprisonment for violators.  In addition, the legislation 
allows for children aged 15 years and above to have an 
apprenticeship whereby the craftsmen and employers have the 
obligation to provide a safe and healthy work environment 
along with training and tools.  However, child labor laws are 
not enforced effectively or consistently, and law enforcement 
officials - including judges, police, and labor officials - 
often are unfamiliar with the provisions of the law 
protecting children.  Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor 
and Social Welfare are responsible for enforcement of child 
labor regulations, and District labor officers and the Social 
Services sub-committees of District Assemblies are charged 
with seeing that the relevant provisions of the law are 
observed.  They visit each workplace annually and make spot 
checks whenever they receive allegations of violations.  All 
law enforcement and judicial authorities in the country are 
hampered by severe resource constraints and a lack of public 
awareness about the problem. The 1998 Children,s Act defines 
hazardous work as including: going to sea, mining and 
quarrying, portage of heavy loads, manufacturing industries 
where chemicals are produced or used, and work in places such 
as bars, hotels and places of entertainment where a person 
may be exposed to immoral behavior. 
 
 
b) Does the country have adequate laws and regulations for 
the implementation and enforcement of proscriptions against 
the worst forms of child labor? Have there been any recent 
governmental or judicial initiatives to strengthen or enforce 
child labor legislation and regulations? 
 
Existing laws do not provide for protection and 
rehabilitation of the victim in child labor and child 
trafficking cases, and do not specifically define 
\'trafficking\' as a crime. Child trafficking intersects with 
the problem of child labor at several junctions in Ghana. 
Against this background, several government ministries, NGOs, 
and others formed a National Task Force on Human Trafficking 
in 2002. The chief aim of this task force was to draft a 
human trafficking bill that would specifically define 
trafficking as a crime and also to provide protection and 
rehabilitation for victims of trafficking. The final draft of 
the legislation has been approved, and the bill is likely to 
be considered by Parliament in early 2005. 
 
Although there are laws addressing child labor, the Ghanaian 
judicial system labors under an enormous backlog of cases, 
corrupt lower officials, unenforced judgments and general 
lack of faith on the part of Ghanaian citizens. Judicial 
officials have inadequate resources: no law clerks, few 
published decisions in a common law country, no law library 
outside the capital, and very few court reporters are 
available to take notes during trials (most judges take their 
own notes by hand). Enforcement of judgments is a problem; 
therefore, litigants usually do not have much motivation to 
use the courts. Court files can be lost and found and court 
cases can be scheduled and delayed by bribing court clerks. 
Yet, in spite of the obstacles, there are identified 
energetic reformers within the system who are working to 
bring about changes. 
 
 
c) Has the country established formal institutional 
mechanisms to investigate and address complaints relating to 
the worst forms of child labor? 
 
When Ministry of Manpower Development and Employment 
inspectors find infractions of child labor laws during their 
routine monitoring of companies\' labor practices, they 
generally inform the employers about the provisions of the 
law and asked them to make changes.  In 2003, there was no 
record of any prosecutions for child labor resulting from 
these inspections.  Officials only occasionally punish 
violators of regulations that prohibit heavy labor and night 
work for children.  In addition, the inspectors\' efforts have 
generally concentrated only in the formal sector, which is 
not where most child labor is performed. According to 
government officials, child labor is more of a problem in the 
informal sector, which is more difficult to regulate. 
 
 
d) What social programs have been implemented to prevent the 
engagement of children in the worst forms of child labor and 
to assist in removing children engaged in the worst forms of 
child labor? 
 
Within the limits of its resources, the Government is 
committed to protecting the rights and welfare of children. 
The Government spent 5 percent of GDP on education, 
approximately 64 percent of which went toward basic education 
in 2002.  Education is compulsory through primary and junior 
secondary school (the equivalent of grades 1 through 9); 
however, education is not free.  In practice, schools have 
imposed fees of up to $50 (400,000 cedis) per term, despite 
government regulations that these fees should not be more 
than $10 (80,000 cedis). Parents are required to purchase 
uniforms and books, as well as extra items listed in schools\' 
prospectuses.  In addition, teachers have imposed extra 
classes for an additional fee to supplement their incomes. 
In 2002, the Minister of Education directed all fees above 
$10 (80,000 cedis) to be refunded and required bills of 
secondary schools to be vetted by District Directors of 
Education before being sent to parents. 
 
Some children are unable to attend school because they need 
to work to supplement their family\'s income, they have to 
travel long distances to reach the school, or there is a lack 
of teachers, especially in more rural areas.  In addition, 
authorities do not regularly enforce children,s attendance 
at school, and parents are rarely, if ever, sanctioned for 
keeping their children out of school. 
 
Females frequently drop out of school due to societal or 
economic pressures, and there is a significant gap in 
enrollment rates between males and females.  According to 
UNICEF, 80 percent of eligible children (84 percent of males 
enrolled compared with 77 percent of females) were enrolled 
in primary school in 2001-02.  Primary school enrollment 
figures were significantly lower in the rural northern areas; 
in the Northern Region, 65 percent of eligible children (75 
percent of males and 55 percent of females) were enrolled in 
primary school in 2001-02. 
 
According to Ministry of Education (MOE) data for 2001-02, 55 
percent of males and 45 percent of females in the 12- to 
14-year age range were enrolled in junior secondary school. 
The 2001-02 advancement rate from junior secondary to senior 
secondary school was 47 percent.  Enrollment of women at the 
university level in 2002 was less than half that of men. 
The Government has taken some concrete steps to support 
education, including support of \"informal\" schools 
(NGO-sponsored schools that were not regulated by the 
Government and provide nontraditional education), and has 
increased emphasis on assuring that students progressed from 
one school grade to another.  The Government actively 
campaigns for girls\' education, and the Minister of State for 
Primary, Secondary, and Girl-Child Education is responsible 
for addressing gender-related issues in education.  The Ghana 
Education Service (GES) prepared a Five Year Action Plan for 
Girls\' Education in Ghana 2003-2008 and offers the following 
programs during the year: \"Science and Technology and 
Mathematics Education\" clinics nationwide; scholarships for 
girls at the Junior Secondary School and Senior Secondary 
School levels; and incentives for female teachers to teach in 
rural areas and sensitize students, parents, and community 
members on girls\' education.  In addition, the GES has placed 
Girls Education Officers at the regional and district levels. 
 
 
e) Does the country have a comprehensive policy aimed at the 
elimination of the worst forms of child labor? 
 
ILO/IPEC, government representatives, the Trades Union 
Congress, the media, international organizations, and NGOs 
continue to build upon the 2001-02 \"National Plan of Action 
for the Elimination of Child Labor in Ghana,\" by increasing 
institutional capacity to combat child labor.  Education and 
sensitization workshops are conducted with police, labor 
inspectors, local governments, and communities. 
 
In 2004, ILO (in cooperation with the Ministry of Manpower, 
Development, and Employment) hosted a series of workshops to 
launch the new Timebound program, which requires Ghana to 
demonstrate progress on eliminating the worst forms of child 
labor within a specified amount of time. These workshops 
enjoyed support from several government ministries as well as 
NGOs and international organizations. 
 
 
f) Is the country making continual progress toward 
eliminating the worst forms of child labor? 
 
Child labor, especially in the informal sector, remains a 
problem in Ghana. The government is sorely underresourced to 
fight the problem, and faces many limitations in its ability 
to fight and prosecute the problem under existing laws. The 
government and NGOs in Ghana face the additional challenge of 
sensitizing communities to the problem at a very fundamental 
level. While many people say they want the problems of child 
labor and child trafficking eradicated, there is still wide 
cultural acceptance of these practices. Poverty is frequently 
and accurately cited as the main reason for the problems, but 
NGO leaders close to the issues also cite others ) the low 
status of children in a very hierarchical society, lack of 
family planning, and polygamy. But the government and NGOs 
are making progress, as growing numbers of traditional 
leaders, parents, and laborers seem to understand that these 
are practices they should not engage in. 
 
In particular reference to child trafficking, a fundamental 
problem is the lack of an anti-trafficking law, which has 
been in progress for well over two years in Ghana. A draft 
bill is currently sitting at the Attorney General,s office, 
waiting for the Ministry of Women,s and Children,s Affairs 
(MOWAC, the ministry with the mandate to submit the bill) to 
put it before Parliament. Citing bad timing on the 
parliamentary calendar (not to mention presidential and 
parliamentary elections later this year), several government 
sources say the bill is likely to be tabled until 2005. Some 
government officials cite the normal and lengthy process as 
the reason for the delay. NGO leaders involved in the 
National Task Force to create the bill, however, point to a 
dispute between ministries over ownership of the bill.

SUBJECT: WA LEFT WANTING: AMBASSADOR VISITS A NEGLECTED 
REGION IN GHANA 
 
REF: ACCRA IIR 6 835 0082 04 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. The city of Wa, the regional capital of the Upper West 
region of Ghana, received its likely first-ever visit by an 
American ambassador on August 19. Ambassador Yates met with 
the regional minister, local religious and NGO leaders, and a 
small military detachment, all of whom were unanimous in 
their characterization of Wa as the poorest, most 
underresourced, and most neglected region in Ghana. 
Ambassador Yates reiterated the USG\'s commitment to 
development assistance in the region, and specifically 
reached out to Muslim leaders. Conversations with local 
religious leaders indicated that a trend in Islamic \'purism\' 
is being imported from abroad and has raised concerns among 
locals on both sides of the Christian-Muslim divide. Military 
leaders expressed concern about local chieftancy disputes, 
which have grown violent in the past, and the Cote d\'Ivoire 
border area. 
 
2. What would have been a two-day journey by 4x4 vehicle over 
bad roads was made possible by the C-12 DAO plane, which 
enabled Ambassador Yates, ConOff, PolOff, and DAO officers to 
pay a one-day visit to this remote province. Long-term 
resident U.S. missionaries and Peace Corps Volunteers were 
appreciative of the visit and also provided insights into the 
northern region. Several missionaries, resident in Wa since 
the seventies, said that no U.S. ambassador had visited 
during their tenure. End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
THREE CHALLENGES: UNLIKELY TO FADE SOON 
--------------------------------------- 
3. In his courtesy call with Ambassador Yates, the regional 
minister of Wa, Mogtari Sahanun, indicated that the region is 
grappling with three major challenges: lack of water, a poor 
road network, and an underresourced education system. In a 
region that enjoys only one short rainy season a year (most 
of southern and central Ghana have two or three), portable 
water sources are scarce and agricultural conditions are 
sometimes desperate. This also forces the migration of many 
locals to other parts of the country, searching for work. 
With a poor network of roads in the area, such conditions 
further isolate the Upper West from the rest of the country, 
creating an \'island-like\' condition for its population. On 
the education front, the region is sorely in need of 
qualified teachers and is unable to attract more to the area. 
U.S. Peace Corps Volunteers in this region who work in 
secondary schools face significant economic resource 
challenges. 
 
4. As in many parts of Ghana, traditional politics cut across 
central government politics. There are ongoing sensitization 
campaigns in the area calling for peaceful, violence-free 
elections. A traditional opposition NDC stronghold, the 
ruling NPP already faces an uphill battle in this region, and 
this effort is further hampered by the (NPP) regional 
minister\'s refusal to acknowledge the new traditional leader 
of the area (Note: there has been local disagreement about 
who should have been named the new Wa-Na chief). The NPP\'s 
inability to make good on promises for an improved 
north-south road network is a major factor in the campaign 
for this region. The minister described this project as 
\'continuing and ongoing\', alleging 50 kilometers of new roads 
were either paved or under construction since the Kufuor 
administration had begun, but there is little evidence of 
this so far. 
 
----------------------------------- 
ISLAMIC \'PURISM\': A WORRYING IMPORT 
----------------------------------- 
5. Wa remains a strong Muslim municipality with one of the 
most negative intra-religious divides among the Orthodox 
Tijaniyas, the Sunnis, and the Ahmadiyyas. With varying and 
complex spheres of power, Muslim religious leaders in Wa 
zealously guard their positions and retain substantial 
influence on their followers. The overwhelming majority of Wa 
Muslims belong to the mainstream Orthodox and Sunni sects. 
Ahmadis are a significant minority that remain very active. 
Known locally as Ahl ul-Sunna, the Sunni sect is a 
Saudi-trained, Wahhabi-inspired group. It is notorious for 
leading a number of aggressive and bloody confrontations 
across the region. They attack and publicly condemn 
traditional Muslim practices like the production of charms 
and wearing amulets. The brand of Islam they see as \'pure\' is 
that which they were exposed to in Saudi Arabia and other 
parts of the Arab-Muslim world. There have been instances of 
tension and violent confrontations between members of the 
Tijaniya and the Sunnis over doctrinal differences. The 
orthodox sect has persistently resisted the spread of the 
Sunni sect in the Wa area. The latter see themselves as very 
puritan and the right custodians of the Islamic tradition and 
resent taking subordinate roles in the communities. 
6. The Ambassador, PolOff, and U.S. military representatives 
met with the Chief Imam, a dozen other Imams and 
approximately 50 Muslim leaders in an unusual Tijaniya and 
Sunni gathering (Note: Two years ago, embassy PolOffs visited 
with representatives of the Ahmadiyya sect, and the regional 
minister named in para 3 above is an Ahmadi). After prayers, 
the spokesperson said on behalf of the Imams that the 
embassy\'s visit was received as a sign of the high regard 
America has for Islam. He thanked the U.S. for its role in 
ensuring peace in the world and pointed out that Ghana\'s 
northern Muslims are peace-loving. He reiterated that Islam 
stands for peace and said they comdemn acts of terrorism and 
violence in any part of the world. He also requested 
educational assistance for northern Muslims, stating that 
ignorance is Mohammed\'s greatest enemy. The Ambassador 
responded, bringing greetings from the U.S. Government and 
the American people, presented books as gifts and explained 
she had come to listen to their concerns. This visit also 
provided an opportunity to announce the upcoming opening of 
the American Corner Outreach center in Tamale on September 8, 
and to invite the Imams. 
 
7. The Catholic leader of an inter-faith dialogue in Wa, 
Father Aloysius Nuolabong, noted with concern the increase of 
numbers of younger Muslims returning from studies in the 
Arab-Muslim world. He said that youths travel to Saudi 
Arabia, Libya, Iran, and other countries - financed by 
scholarships administered through the countries\' Islamic NGOs 
in Ghana - and subsequently return to Ghana with a newfound 
Islamic identity that challenges the local interpretation of 
Islam. Father Nuolabong also said that this trend has raised 
concern among local Imams (with whom he enjoys a very good 
relationship, to the point that he is referred to as \"Father 
Alhadji\"), who see the trend as potentially leading to 
violence and a breakdown of intra-Muslim relations in the 
region. 
 
8. The 70-year old Bishop of Wa, Reverend Paul Bemile, noted 
that this trend has included new, \'foreign\' attitudes that 
affect the treatment of Muslim women. When younger Muslims 
travel to other countries and see women dress differently, 
and are exposed to the more fundamentalist interpretation of 
the Koran, they return to Ghana and view their local 
interpretation as inferior to the \'pure\' interpretation. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE UPPER WEST/FGM 
----------------------------------------- 
9. The Ambassador raised the issue of female genital 
mutilation (FGM) with several interlocutors because recent 
statistics indicate the practice is on the rise in the Upper 
West. Rumors abound that the illegal practice is much more 
widespread than is currently acknowledged, and that \'cutters\' 
cross the border from Burkino Faso by night to perform FGM on 
young women. A local NGO leader was quick to point out that 
this ritual is often mistakenly viewed as a local Muslim 
practice, when in fact FGM is much more closely connected 
with traditional religions and cultural customs. Many young 
women who were not subjected to FGM at a young age are 
pressured to go through it when they are older, or face 
rejection by their communities. Bishop Bemile said the 
Catholic church is strong in the Upper West and that the 
church has many programs and schools which target female 
education - both formal and informal. 
 
10. In an area where educational opportunities are lacking 
for all, and young women are particularly vulnerable to 
illiteracy, the status of women in the Upper West remains 
quite low. Local and international NGOs have had some success 
in sensitizing local and religious leaders, and improvements 
have slowly emerged. 
 
------------ 
OTHER EVENTS 
------------ 
11. The Ambassador met with Peace Corps Volunteers to learn 
of local educational and environmental challenges from their 
first-hand accounts. She briefed the American missionary 
community, and the ConOff offered valuable American citizen 
services. The meeting with the AmCits and PCVs reinforced 
what had been learned from local officials - that the 
isolation experienced in the Upper West could be dramatically 
improved with better road networks and an infusion of 
investment into infrastructure and education. 
 
12. Ambassador and DAO officers met informally at the airport 
with a GoG military contingent that is usually based in 
Tamale, the capital city in the Northern Region. They are 
currently assigned to Wa to keep peace among local groups 
involved in the Wa-Na chieftancy dispute (see reftel for 
further detail). The military contingent resides at the 
Wa-Na\'s palace in Wa, but because this is a politically 
sensitive site the embassy delegation opted to meet with them 
at the air strip instead. 
 
13. As part of her trip to the Wa area, Ambassador Yates 
commissioned a USAID-funded water well at the village of 
Gudayiri, and specifically conveyed her hope that this 
development would improve the conditions for women in this 
village. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
14. The observations by religious leaders on both sides of 
the Christian-Muslim divide about the import of Islamic 
purism into northern Ghana confirmed what embassy officials 
have heard in Accra. As the USG makes a point of reaching out 
to the far north on other fronts - water assistance, 
advancing the status of women, education - it is important 
that the Mission reach out to members of all Muslim factions 
there as well. In an area where violence and disputes arise 
predominantly from chieftancy and religious issues, it has 
the potential to become a flashpoint if the worrying trend of 
imported fundamentalism continues. The interfaith dialogue, 
under the leadership of a very capable priest, is an 
excellent initiative to address some of these tensions and 
merits USG support. End comment.

SUBJECT: READOUT OF MCC CEO PAUL APPLEGARTH\'S VISIT TO GHANA 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) CEO Paul 
Applegarth visited Ghana August 23-24, conducting site visits 
and meeting with President Kufuor, Finance Minister Osafo 
Maafo, and the Ministry of Finance team in charge of 
preparing Ghana\'s Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) compact. 
 The GoG\'s MCA team outlined a preliminary MCA proposal, 
identifying infrastructure, agro industry, private sector 
development, social infrastructure and good governance as 
possible targets for MCC funding.  They envision a USD 
300-400 million program over four years.  GoG officials 
acknowledged they are in the early stages of the process, but 
aim to sign a compact before year-end.  CEO Applegarth also 
met with donor representatives.  End Summary. 
 
MCC Visit to Ghana 
------------------ 
2. (SBU) MCC CEO Applegarth, John Hewko, VP for Country 
Relations, Maureen Harrington, Senior Advisor to the CEO, and 
Rod Norman, Director, Africa Department, visited Ghana August 
23-24 to conduct meetings with GoG officials and civil 
society representatives.  They also visited sites that 
represent sectors the GoG is considering for MCC funding. 
The Ambassador and Embassy officers accompanied Applegarth 
and MCC staff for the August 24 meeting with President 
Kufuor, where Applegarth congratulated Ghana on its selection 
as an MCA-eligible country and assured the President that the 
MCC was prepared to work with the Finance Ministry team on 
developing a MCA compact.  (Comment:  Kufuor was pleased that 
the visit had gone smoothly and expressed his dedication to 
the MCA principles and intention to push for completion of 
the GoG MCA compact.  However, he was uncharacteristically 
subdued, and was clearly worn out by his constant campaigning 
throughout the country in the run-up to the December 
elections.  End Comment) 
 
August 23 Site Visits Highlight Energy and Agriculture 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
3. (SBU) Applegarth, the Ambassador, and the MCC team visited 
Athena Foods Limited, a fruit juice processing company that 
receives USAID technical assistance.  GoG officials selected 
this site because, as company executives explained, while the 
company is rapidly increasing exports to the U.S. and Europe, 
lack of access to investment capital, congested ports, 
unreliable electricity and water supply, and low worker 
capacity have limited growth. 
 
4. (SBU) The GoG also organized a visit to Akosombo Dam to 
give Applegarth a visual idea of the energy sector issues -- 
inadequate generation and poor distribution -- that make it 
difficult to do business in Ghana.  Joshua Ofedie, CEO of the 
Volta River Authority (VRA), which operates the dam and is 
responsible for power generation and transmission in Ghana, 
explained that the dam, built in the 1960s, no longer 
produces sufficient power to meet Ghanaian demand, which is 
increasing at 10 percent a year.  Although the GoG 
supplemented hydro-power with petroleum-fired thermal power 
plants, high oil prices make it more economical to import 
electricity from Cote d\'Ivoire\'s gas-fired plants.  Ofedie 
made a strong case for completing the West Africa Gas 
Pipeline, which will bring in cheap natural gas from Nigeria 
to power Ghana\'s current and planned thermal plants, and 
would also allow Ghana to export power in support of the West 
Africa Power Pool.  He also argued that major reforms are 
needed to improve transmission and distribution, some of 
which are ongoing with World Bank and other donor support. 
 
GoG Organizational Structure for MCA Compact Development 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
5. (SBU) The Government of Ghana (GoG) has established a 
\"Core MCA Team,\" headed up by a London-based consultant, 
Michael Ansah, to manage the compact development process. 
This team is comprised primarily of Finance Ministry 
officials.  The \"MCA Working Group,\" comprised of private 
sector and civil society representatives, and including the 
core group, will conduct the initial technical review of 
proposed projects and recommend a program to the \"MCA 
Steering Group,\" which is comprised of eight cabinet 
ministers and two representatives of local think tanks.  The 
Steering Group will oversee the MCA Working Group, and will 
finalize the program and will vet it in public forums. 
 
Meeting with MCA Core Team 
-------------------------- 
6. (SBU) On August 24, Finance Minister Osafo Maafo and the 
MCA Core Team members briefed Applegarth on the team\'s work 
to date.  Team leader Ansah presented a preliminary outline 
of the GoG\'s plan to use MCC funds to support its overall 
strategy for economic growth, as outlined in the Ghana 
Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS).  Osafo Maafo emphasized 
that the consultation process is a key feature of their 
program and also explained that considerable consultation has 
already taken place and will continue so that full consensus 
is achieved.  Ansah explained that the components of the 
GoG\'s proposal would address Ghana\'s principal constraints 
and vulnerabilities. 
 
Constraints to Growth 
--------------------- 
7. (SBU) Ansah listed the constraints to growth in Ghana that 
MCA funding would address:  1) inadequate energy, roads, and 
telecommunications infrastructure; 2) financial capital, 
particularly the lack of long term credit; 3) inadequate 
health and education; 4) low agricultural productivity; 5) a 
weak private sector; 6) poor government coordination and 
monitoring; and 7) weak government institutions.  Osafo Maafo 
stressed that financial sector reform is also critical. 
 
Key Economic Vulnerabilities 
---------------------------- 
8. (SBU) Ansah and Osafo Maafo identified a number of 
critical vulnerabilities to growth that call for greater 
diversification of the economic base.  Ghana is heavily 
reliant on foreign exchange earnings from cocoa and gold 
exports, which together bring in 70 percent of total foreign 
exchange.  Crude oil consumes 25 percent of Ghana\'s foreign 
exchange earnings, and 25 percent of oil imports go to 
produce electricity.  Hydro-power is insufficient to cover 
local demand, and the GoG is increasingly concerned about the 
impact on the economy (and government budget) of high energy 
import costs. 
 
GoG MCA Concept -- A Summary 
---------------------------- 
9. (SBU) Ansah stated that the GoG\'s proposal would be 
anchored on investments in infrastructure, particularly in 
energy, roads and telecommunications, as the backbone for 
accelerating sustained growth in agro-based industry and 
private sector development.  The GoG\'s goal is to position 
Ghana as a major player in the ECOWAS market of 250 million 
consumers and would also make Ghana more competitive in the 
world market. 
 
10. (SBU) The GoG plan will also focus on expanding economic 
opportunities in rural areas by developing linkages between 
larger commercial businesses and rural production units.  The 
GoG will support the concept through efforts to develop a 
pro-active policy environment conducive to trade and 
investment.  The strategy would call for complementary 
efforts to strengthen health and education services and to 
develop a stronger institutional framework for addressing key 
economic policy and trade reforms.  The policy framework 
would also address capacity building of democratic 
institutions at all levels: national, regional and local. 
 
11. (SBU) Osafo Maafo echoed VRA CEO Ofedie\'s argument that 
the insecurity in energy supply and the related import bill 
is a serious impediment to growth and investment and, hence, 
to reducing poverty.  Energy will, therefore, figure 
prominently in the GoG\'s MCA compact.  Specifically, the GoG 
will want MCA to support completion of the West Africa Gas 
Pipeline (and gas distribution systems) and construction of 
new thermal power plants.  Other projects mentioned included 
the rehabilitation of Ghana\'s ports, developing large 
commercial farms and related export processing facilities, 
and reforming the financial sector. 
 
Policy Environment 
------------------ 
12. (SBU) Osafo Maafo stressed the GoG\'s commitment to a 
strong policy reform agenda.  He highlighted the ongoing 
effort to reform \"public sector financial management\" and 
stated that the GoG had pushed several laws through 
Parliament recently that were designed to improve financial 
management and auditing, and create a transparent and 
streamlined public procurement process.  The GoG is also 
implementing comprehensive financial sector reforms, 
beginning with new banking and insurance laws, and 
introducing legislation to encourage savings mobilization 
(Long Term Savings Bill) and capital market development (the 
Venture Capital Bill). 
 
Cost, Timeline and Outcomes 
--------------------------- 
13. (SBU) Ansah stated that the GoG\'s proposed budget for the 
program would be between USD 300 and 400 million over four 
years.  Osafo Maafo noted that the Core MCA Team would 
justify the price tag, costing out each of the elements and 
setting up an evaluation and monitoring program to ensure 
measurable results would be achieved.  The GoG\'s long-term 
goals for the MCA program are to increase employment, income 
and foreign exchange earnings.  Ansah estimated that 
investments in the energy sector would result in savings from 
lower oil imports of 15,000 barrels/day, the equivalent of 
about USD 900 million over the four-year period.  He said the 
target increase in foreign exchange earnings from higher 
exports is USD 1 billion/year; the target increase in GDP 
growth rate is 3 percent/year.  Osafo Maafo added that other 
objectives include increasing literacy rates and improving 
health and educational facilities. 
 
MCC Reaction to GoG Draft Proposal 
---------------------------------- 
14. (SBU) Given that this was the first opportunity to 
analyze the state of MCA preparations in Ghana, the MCC team 
limited advice and criticism and focused on pushing GoG 
participants to narrow the scope of their proposal. 
Applegarth noted that the preliminary proposal was very 
broad, covering almost every aspect of the economy.  He and 
other MCC team members argued that the GoG\'s goal should be 
to prioritize the various components and focus on the 
critical projects, their potential impact, and means to 
monitor and evaluate implementation and results. 
 
Next Steps 
---------- 
15. (SBU) The Core MCA Team plans to consult further with the 
MCA Working Group in developing its concept paper, which it 
will then provide to the MCC for review.  The goal for 
completing the concept paper is September 2004.  Following 
additional consultations with stakeholders, the GoG Cabinet 
and the MCC, the GoG will submit a draft proposal to the MCC 
later in the fall.  Ansah commented that the GoG\'s goal was 
to negotiate and sign a compact with the MCC by late fourth 
quarter of 2004. 
 
Donors Push for MCA as Budget Support 
------------------------------------- 
16. (SBU) During a lively dinner with other development partners, 
including the main participants in the Multi-Donor Budget 
Support group, donor representatives argued strongly in favor 
of running MCA funds through Ghana\'s budget.  Their main 
justification is that direct budget support encourages the 
government to take responsibility for managing the funds and 
promotes improved financial management and capacity building. 
 Applegarth responded that the U.S. government believes 
budget support encourages dependency, since the recipient 
government becomes accustomed to using the assistance to fund 
recurrent expenditures and begins to treat it as a reliable 
revenue stream.  However, he stated that he would be willing 
to continue this debate in the future. 
 
Comment 
------- 
17. (SBU) The GoG\'s presentation, while professional, gave 
the impression that MCA funds would somehow result in the 
overhaul of the entire economy.  Minister Osafo Maafo and his 
team agreed with MCC comments that it needs much more 
specificity.  The President and Minister Osafo Maafo are 
committed to the MCA program, and we are sure they consider 
completing a compact one of the GoG\'s top priorities. 
However, they and the entire government are distracted by the 
election campaign.  MCC CEO Applegarth\'s visit should 
reinvigorate the GoG effort, but their timeline may be overly 
ambitious.  End Summary.

SUBJECT: GHANA AIRWAYS HAS NEW AMERICAN PARTNER 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The GoG appears to have made a bold move to 
save Ghana Airways.  Minister of Roads and Transport Richard 
Anane told EconOffs the GoG will sell a portion of Ghana 
Airways to a group of American investors headed by SkyWest 
founder and board member Ralph Atkin, known as Ghana 
International Airways (GIA).  The Minister did not address 
the future of the airlines oft criticized employees. Ghana 
International Airways claimed a week ago that all employees 
would have to be sacked as a pre-condition of the deal.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) EconChief and Econoff spoke with Roads and Transport 
Minister Anane about the conflicting stories surrounding a 
deal between GIA and the GoG for Ghana Airways.  According to 
the Minister, GIA officials, including SkyWest founder Ralph 
Atkin met with President Kufuor and his cabinet Saturday, 
August 21, to hammer out a deal.  The Minister confirmed that 
local media reports of a deal were accurate.  The details 
outlined in the press reports track almost word-for-word with 
what a GIA representative told Econoff last week. 
 
3. (U) According to all sources GIA will hold a 30 percent 
stake in the new Ghana Airways while the GoG retains 70 
percent. The Minister stated that GIA would be given a \"free 
hand\" to operate the airline for 90 days.  To affect this the 
GoG will assume the airline\'s 162-million-dollar debt and not 
intervene in the management of the company for 90 days.  GIA 
is expected to reorganize and lease new equipment during that 
time.  To cover operating costs during this time of 
\"exclusivity\" GIA and the GoG will put up USD 2.1 and USD 4.9 
million in cash, or 30 and 70 percent of USD 7 million, 
respectively. 
 
4. (SBU) At the end of 90 days GIA is expected to inject an 
additional USD 55 million into the airline.  The report makes 
no mention of any additional investment by the GoG.  However, 
GIA\'s representative said that the GoG would contribute about 
the same amount at the end of 90 days. 
 
5. (SBU) Ghana International Airways\' representative was 
emphatic that GIA would maintain full control as the GoG\'s 
interest in the company is reduced to 10 percent of total 
shares over the next five years.  The media and the Minister, 
however, were silent on this issue, although the Minister 
agreed the GoG\'s long term plan was to float its shares on 
the Ghana Stock Exchange. 
 
6. (SBU) Last week GIA\'s primary concern (aside from the 
outstanding debt) was the current 1700-person workforce. 
Ghana International Airways indicated there would be no deal 
if the GoG did not fire every employee.  The Minister claims 
that some cuts will be made before GIA takes over to \"show 
good faith\" and prevent GIA from \"looking like the bad guy\". 
He did not, however, indicate that the cuts would be drastic. 
 It is unlikely that GIA would have dropped this position 
completely since it was a cornerstone of its plan to move 
forward with nothing more than Ghana Airways\' name and some 
exclusive routes. 
 
6. (SBU) The big question is this:  Who controls Ghana 
Airways at the end of 90 days?  Time and again Ghana Airways\' 
problems have been blamed on political meddling and outright 
cronyism, with good reason.  The GoG has proved repeatedly 
over the last few years that it is incapable or unwilling to 
undertake the necessary but politically difficult steps to 
restructure Ghana Airways.  GIA has no intention of entering 
any deal that allows any such interference, but whether they 
can come up with an agreement that will keep those with 
political interests at bay remains to be seen.  In terms of 
attracting passengers, reliable, safe service may be no 
substitute for the super-sized luggage allowances and 
back-door freebies that Ghana Airways has provided for 
personal and political friends.  West Africa\'s only direct 
routes to the U.S. are a prize that will be cumbersome if it 
brings the rest of Ghana Airways\' considerable baggage.

SUBJECT: GROUNDBREAKING SHOWCASES NEWMONT MINING\'S ATTEMPT 
TO SOFTEN IMAGE 
 
1. (SBU) On August 25 DCM and EconOff attended groundbreaking 
ceremonies hosted by Newmont Mining for the first of two 
planned mines in Ghana.  When completed, the 450 
million-dollar project in the Brong-Ahafo region will 
represent the largest foreign investment in Ghana to date. 
Newmont clearly intends to use the project to showcase what 
they claim is a new approach to the business of mining.  It 
will also mean the relocation of over 500 people, although 
local communities seem to be committed to the project. 
 
2.  (SBU) The ceremony was well attended by chiefs and 
community leader from all the villages affected by the 
project.  The atmosphere was decidedly positive.  Newmont CEO 
Wayne Murdy was cheered openly by leaders of youth groups 
from the villages being relocating in the project.  One year 
ago these same young people staged protests and vandalized 
equipment at the site.  Rather than react aggressively, Murdy 
created an open forum, allowing the groups to express their 
concerns about the project on an on-going basis.  Newmont 
also used these discussions to present their plans directly 
to the community, calming fears of closed-door secret deals 
with tribal leaders and politicians.  In another new effort, 
adult community leaders act as consultants in the relocation 
process. According to Newmont\'s resettlement director, this 
has fostered a daily, constructive dialogue between Newmont 
and the affected communities. 
 
3.  (SBU) Despite all the good will, Newmont staff are not 
saying what percentage of the USD 50 million already spent 
has gone towards resettlement projects and worker 
training-programs.  At a lunch hosted by Newmont executives 
after the ceremony there was some grumbling from local 
leaders about negotiated crop settlements that have yet to be 
paid and delays in construction of the resettlement 
communities.  Perhaps more worrisome from Newmont\'s 
perspective is the growing protest from environmental groups 
directed at their next project in Ghana, which will be 
partially built on a national forest preserve in the Ashanti 
region.  If completed, the Ahafo and Ashanti projects 
together will represent a total investment in excess of USD 1 
billion for Newmont and 12.6 million ounces of their 
worldwide gold reserves.  It is clear from their efforts to 
move aggressively that Newmont sees success in Ghana as 
critical to the future success of the company.  So far, 
Newmont\'s effort to obtain the support of local communities 
appears to be working.  However, there is clearly more work 
to be done, and Newmont has its hands full convincing the 
public that the Ashanti project will not harm the 
environment.  Fortunately for Newmont, the Government of 
Ghana strongly supports both investments.

SUBJECT: SURVEY OF GHANA\'S EVOLVING BANKING SECTOR 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) The Government of Ghana\'s (GoG) sound macro policies 
have led to lower inflation and interest rates, paving the 
way for local banks and insurance companies to introduce 
innovative new products and vie for the 95 percent of 
Ghanaians who do not use the formal financial system.  Banks 
can no longer survive on high-interest bearing government 
securities, and must aggressively compete for the relatively 
few low-risk clients for loans and other financial products. 
Banks must contend with the Central Bank\'s recently mandated 
higher capital requirements.  Econoffs surveyed the most 
competitive of Ghana\'s 18 banks, and also met with insurers 
and regulators.  While bankers largely express optimism about 
Ghana\'s economy and their own growth opportunities, they are 
aware that stronger competition and stiffer regulation will 
likely instigate mergers, acquisitions, and failures in the 
next few years.  End Summary. 
 
Background on the Banking Environment 
------------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) Large government deficits and debt, volatile 
inflation, and high interest rates over the last 20 years 
limited development of Ghana\'s financial sector.  This 
macroeconomic instability has been accompanied and 
exacerbated by: (i) government hoarding of the available 
credit, (ii) heavy government ownership in financial sector 
companies, (iii) inconsistent yet excessive regulation, and 
(iv) high (44 percent) reserve requirements.  Given these 
impediments, it is little wonder that the banking system 
serves only five percent of Ghanaian households.  However, 
there have been signs of improvements in the last year.  Post 
met recently with banks, insurance companies and government 
regulators to discuss how the changing macroeconomic 
environment is affecting bank operations, and to gauge 
whether stronger competition and new regulatory requirements 
could provoke a shakeout in the industry. 
 
3. (SBU) Tighter monetary policy and more prudent fiscal 
policies together have forced down inflation and interest 
rates.  The 91-day Treasury Bill, considered the benchmark 
rate in Ghana, fell from a high of 35 percent in 2003 to the 
current 17 percent rate.  The 12-month inflation rate peaked 
at 30 percent in April 2003, and fell to 10.5 percent in 
April 2004.  Year-on-year inflation increased slightly to 
12.4 percent in July 2004 and is expected to stay in the 
10-15 percent for the rest of the year. 
 
4. (SBU) A frequent criticism of Ghana\'s banking sector has 
been that banks have no incentive to lend as long as they can 
be profitable simply holding T-Bills and rolling them over 
every 91 days.  Banks respond that the Bank of Ghana (Central 
Bank) requires them to hold government securities in order to 
fulfill the 35 percent secondary reserve requirement (Note: 
the primary reserve requirement is nine percent.  End Note). 
While true, Ghanaian banks have willingly met these 
requirements, since high interest rates on government 
domestic debt have resulted in Ghanaian banks having among 
the highest return on equity of any banking system in Africa. 
 (Note:  Ghanaian banks also profit from the 10-15 percent 
spreads between lending and saving rates, although this 
should diminish as banks compete to attract new customers. 
End Note) 
 
5. (SBU) With rates edging downwards, margins are shrinking 
and banks are being forced into serving their traditional 
financial intermediary role to maintain profit levels.  At 
the same time, the Bank of Ghana has issued new prudential 
regulations giving banks until 2005 to increase their 
capitalization to 70 billion cedis (about USD 7.8 million). 
Combined, these events may force local banks, especially the 
marginal performers, to reform, merge or fail. 
 
Impact of Lower Interest Rates on Banking Sector 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
6. (SBU) There are 18 banks operating in Ghana, with four of 
them holding 64 percent of assets.  The Bank of Ghana has 
also received several applications to establish new banks. 
Most bankers and the Bank of Ghana bank supervisors believe 
this number is too high for the market, and expect increased 
competition and new capital requirements to force a wave of 
mergers or closures in the next few years.  The regulators 
were noncommittal on whether the GoG would allow bank 
failures or intervene in the market. 
 
Focus on SME Lending 
-------------------- 
7. (SBU) In response to the changing market, the most 
competitive Ghanaian banks -- Ecobank, SG-SSB, Home Finance 
Company (HFC) -- are launching innovative products to attract 
new customers.  Banks are also considering riskier small and 
medium size enterprises (SMEs) because established companies 
and individuals already have banking relationships.  All the 
banks Post conferred with emphasized how important it was now 
to cater to SME clients.  However, Ecobank, HFC and other 
medium-sized but aggressive banks are making this sector a 
priority.  Ecobank is leading the way with over 30 percent of 
its USD 80 million portfolio targeted to the SME sector. 
Large banks in Ghana insist they are maintaining 
profitability through higher fees and increased volume, but 
are also being forced to pursue SME clients.  Even Standard 
Chartered, which traditionally serves blue chip companies, is 
eyeing the SME market. 
 
8. (SBU) SME lending involves more rigorous client 
interaction and more detailed investigation of the quality of 
business proposals.  SG-SSB, a bank in which French company 
Societe Generale recently bought a controlling share, told 
Post that it can take three weeks to process a loan from a 
new SME client, demonstrating how much time and effort is 
needed.  Across the industry, the number of staff and their 
required skills will also need to expand, and banks will also 
have to update software platforms and even move branch 
locations to serve SMEs.  The extra effort will increase 
operating expenses and reduce profitability in the short 
term.  However, in the long run, banks that successfully 
develop these clients without increasing their level of 
non-performing loans (NPLs) should maintain a competitive 
advantage over the less adaptive banks. 
 
9. (SBU) Ghana\'s banks are still recovering from the massive 
devaluation of the cedi in 2000/2001, causing many companies 
to default on their loans.  The NPL rate peaked in 2001 at 28 
percent and has fallen only to about 20 percent (2003 data). 
Defaults are generally higher when interest rates are high. 
As rates become more affordable, a riskier clientele will 
enter the system, but these clients will also have less 
trouble servicing their debts.  So, the quality of bank 
portfolios should improve in a stable, lower-interest rate 
environment. 
 
Concerns Over Currency Risk 
--------------------------- 
10. (SBU) A growing concern among bankers is the growth of 
dollar-denominated loans.  Over the last few years, 
businesses seeking lower interest rates have increasingly 
sought to borrow in dollars.  This violates the banking adage 
that you should borrow in the currency in which you do 
business.  Similar circumstances developed in the late 1990s, 
which contributed to the high NPL rate following the cedi 
depreciation in 2000.  Ghana remains extremely vulnerable to 
external shocks and commodity price shifts, which could in 
turn affect the exchange rate.  Although several bankers 
voiced concerns about the increased currency risks, they also 
acknowledged their limited ability to reject requests for 
dollar loans due to their fear of losing valuable clients to 
competitor banks. 
 
Government Involvement in Financial Sector 
------------------------------------------ 
11. (SBU) Bankers were unanimous in their optimism that the 
GoG will maintain macroeconomic stability.  All cautioned 
that the single-digit inflation projection for 2004 is 
unlikely, but emphasized that consistent and stable inflation 
is a more important goal in the short to medium term.  They 
broadly criticized the GoG\'s ownership position in the 
financial sector, especially in parastatals Social Security 
National Trust (SSNIT) and Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB). 
SSNIT is one of the biggest drags on the financial sector. 
It holds 15 percent of total financial sector assets, yet is 
poorly run and politically influenced.  GoG commitment to 
overhauling SSNIT management would improve overall asset 
quality in the country. 
 
12. (SBU) Although GCB is the largest bank in Ghana, holding 
24 percent of total banking sector assets and 18 percent of 
all assets in the financial system, it is the least 
innovative in the sector.  Until recently, the GoG has been 
reluctant to privatize its ownership share in GCB, and too 
often uses GCB to fund questionable government programs, 
including petroleum subsidies.  Recently, the GoG has 
considered seriously floating GCB shares on the Ghana Stock 
Exchange, which would dilute the GoG\'s ownership percentage, 
and, hopefully, reinvigorate the bank. 
 
Ghana\'s Insurance Industry is Perking up 
---------------------------------------- 
13. (SBU) The insurance sector is growing in Ghana, but has 
been hindered by the poor reputation and quality of the 
government-owned State Insurance Company (SIC).  SIC\'s market 
share has steadily declined (from about 90 to 45 percent) as 
the number and quality of private insurers has increased. 
The GoG has drafted a new insurance bill that will end SIC\'s 
monopoly on providing insurance to state employees. 
Inflation is the biggest enemy of the insurance business, so 
if the macroeconomic environment remains predictable and less 
volatile, the sector should continue to grow.  This would be 
good news for Ghana\'s economy, since insurance companies are 
often the largest sources of domestic investment. 
 
Constraints on Growth 
--------------------- 
14. (SBU) Lower rates alone are not a cure all for Ghana\'s 
financial sector.  Savings rates in Ghana are low, so there 
is a small deposit base.  The GoG\'s Long-Term Savings Bill -- 
currently before Parliament -- aims to remedy this by 
providing incentives for savers.  The credit culture in Ghana 
is weak, with many inexperienced borrowers who simply do not 
intend to repay their loans.  There is also a history of 
borrowers abandoning bad loans at one bank, only to open a 
new account at a different bank where again the loans go 
unpaid.  The Ghanaian bankers association is working to 
establish a credit reference bureau so that new clients can 
be checked. 
 
Comment 
------- 
15. (SBU) In Ghana, macroeconomic stability is slowly working 
its way through the economy and is beginning to impact the 
financial system.  Vast improvements in asset quality and 
private sector growth (through greater access to investment 
capital) will not come over night, but the trend is positive. 
 Individual banks are already beginning to feel, or at least 
worry about, lower profits from debts assets and increased 
competition for good loan clients.  If the downward trends in 
inflation and interest rates continue over the next two to 
three years, Ghana could experience a wave of mergers, 
buy-outs and possibly bank failures.  End Comment.

TPSC SUBCOMMITTEE ON AGOA IMPLEMENTATION 
2004 COUNTRY ELIGIBILITY RECOMMENDATIONS 
STATE SUBMISSION 
 
 
Country: GHANA 
Current AGOA Status: Eligible 
State recommends continued AGOA eligibility for Ghana. 
 
Country Background Summary: Ghana is a constitutional 
democracy dominated by a strong presidency. President John 
Kufuor has governed since taking power democratically in 
January 2001, succeeding Jerry Rawlings who ruled for 19 
years. Ghana,s population in 2003 was approximately 20.1 
million. 2003 GNI was USD 6.5 billion, and per capita GNI was 
USD 320. Gold, cocoa, and timber are the traditional sources 
of export earnings. The Government of Ghana (GoG) is pursuing 
sound monetary and fiscal policies and completed successful 
IMF and World Bank reviews in September 2003. It has 
succeeded in getting the budget under control and has 
improved transparency and accountability in use of public 
resources. The GoG is on target for revenue collection 
through August 2004, but is unlikely to meet expenditure 
targets due to high oil prices.  Maintaining fiscal 
discipline continues to be is its top economic priority. Real 
GDP growth increased from 4.5 percent in 2002 to 5.2 percent 
in 2003. The cedi has remained relatively stable, 
depreciating by 3.5 percent in 2003.  Favorable external 
markets for cocoa and gold in 2003 supported the stability of 
the cedi and increased foreign exchange reserves. The annual 
inflation rate has declined from 30 percent in April 2003 to 
11.2 percent at the end of May 2004.  Ghana reached HIPC 
completion point in July 2004, paving the way for 
approximately USD 3.5 billion in debt forgiveness. 
 
Comments on Eligibility Requirements 
 
I. Market-based Economy 
 
A. Major Strengths Identified 
Ghana has a market-based economy with few barriers to trade 
and investment. The GoG has made strides in the structural 
reform agenda, particularly in eliminating price controls and 
subsidies. The GoG is expected to fully liberalize crude oil 
imports and cede control of petroleum prices after December 
2004. 
Ghana has enjoyed significant reductions in hard currency 
debt payments since reaching HIPC decision point in 2002. 
Private property rights are protected by law, though disputes 
over land ownership are common. Judicial tribunals, long a 
source of abuse, have been abolished, and High Courts in 
major cities are now automated to expedite review of major 
commercial cases as well as of high-profile corruption cases. 
Encouraging foreign investment is a central part of economic 
policy. Ghana has received nearly USD 250 million in direct 
foreign investment since the beginning of the Kufuor 
Administration in January 2001 
Standard and Poor\'s issued Ghana a B plus/B sovereign debt 
rating on September 5, 2003 and Fitch Rating Agency issued a 
B rating with positive outlook. Although the GoG does not 
benefit directly from this rating, the private sector already 
has due to easier access to credit and foreign exchange and 
increased foreign and domestic investment flows into Ghana. 
The rating also serves as a useful benchmark to measure 
economic progress in Ghana. 
The GoG passed five of six proposed IPR bills in December of 
2003.  The last -a copywrite bill- is still pending in 
Parliament. 
The World Bank announced in a March 2004 report that Ghana,s 
&Time to Start a Business8 had decreased by 34 percent 
since 2003. 
 
B. Major Issues/Problems Identified 
The GOG faces serious challenges in continuing structural 
reforms. It has privatized 300 of 350 parastatal companies, 
but the GoG has delayed divestitures of Ghana Commercial Bank 
and Ghana Water Company Limited. 
In anticipation of the upcoming presidential election the GOG 
has not raised fuel prices to cost recovery levels.  This is 
causing parastatal losses of USD10 million per month. 
Domestic credit and subsidies to public utilities continue to 
present quasi-fiscal problems. The GoG has yet to resolve the 
management problems and inefficiencies in the state owned 
utility companies. It has accumulated large arrearages in the 
energy sector, which pose a potential threat to macroeconomic 
stability. 
The GoG has cleared the CMS Energy dispute by paying arrears 
and has shown a good faith effort to make scheduled payments. 
Western Wireless\' Ghanaian subsidiary Westel was able to meet 
directly with President Kufuor and has agreed to pay a USD 25 
million fine to settle their dispute with the GoG.  The 
matter has been complicated by the application of a 
retroactive spectrum fee of USD 26.5 million.  According to 
the GoG the fee is being applied equally to all wireless 
operators in the country.  Post has no indication the fee has 
not been applied evenhandedly.  Westel contends that their 
license was paid as part of their original agreement with the 
GoG.  Westel has stated their intention to file for 
international arbitration to settle the matter, but holds 
hope that an agreement can still be reached through direct 
negotiation. 
The GoG decided to settle its disputes with U.S. firm Kaiser 
Aluminum by purchasing Kaiser\'s large Valco facility. 
Unfortunately the sale has yet to close and the GoG and 
Kaiser are engaged in parallel processes of international 
arbitration and direct negotiation to resolve the sale. 
US firms have expressed concerns regarding the lack of 
transparency in government procurement, although there have 
been no formal complaints to the GoG. The concerns are mainly 
related to 1) undefined timeframes for rendering decisions, 
2) unclear bidding requirements, and 3) allegations of 
favoritism. 
 
II. Political Reform/Rule of Law/Anti-Corruption 
 
A. Major Strengths Identified 
The Kufuor Administration has pledged commitment to the rule 
of law and appears to be living up to that ideal.  The 
President has established an Office of Accountability to 
oversee the performance of senior government functionaries. 
Several corruption prosecutions are underway and a former 
minister is now in jail.  Cabinet Ministers recently approved 
&Whistle Blower8 legislation to protect citizens who report 
corruption. 
The GoG worked to reduce the backlog of its courts by 
automating High Courts authorized to hear cases involving 
banks, investors, human rights, electoral petitions, 
government revenue, specified commercial and industrial cases 
and certain criminal cases. The GoG also drafted legislation 
to promote Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). 
Presidential elections of 2000 were peaceful, free, and 
transparent. Democracy continues to be vibrant, with the two 
major parties vigorously contesting each other and the press 
enjoying unprecedented freedom. 
 
B. Major Issues/Problems Identified 
The integrity of the legal system is compromised by a severe 
lack of financial, human, and material resources. 
There are serious problems with large numbers of remand 
prisoners detained for three to ten or more years before 
going to trial. 
There continue to be credible reports that members of the 
police beat suspects in custody, and that police and some 
elements of the military arbitrarily arrest and detain 
persons. Police corruption is a problem. 
Prolonged pretrial detention remains a problem. Juvenile 
detainees are housed in separate facilities. Inadequate 
resources and a system vulnerable to political and economic 
influence compromises the integrity of the overburdened 
judicial system. 
At times the Government restricts freedom of assembly, and 
police forcibly disperse some demonstrations. 
Some observers question the GoG,s commitment to an 
evenhanded application of the rule of law given the energetic 
scrutiny and investigation of former government officials on 
corruption charges while comparatively few from Kufuor,s 
party are targeted. 
 
III. Poverty Reduction 
 
A. Major Strengths Identified 
Ghana has a poverty reduction plan.  Key to this is 
increasing growth rates in agriculture through exports of 
processed goods. Ghana plans to take advantage of AGOA 
provisions to boost exports of agricultural products to the 
U.S. 
Ghana has aggressively moved to take full advantage of the 
apparel benefit. Ghana received its textile visa in Mid-2002, 
and, received its Category 9 certification for hand loomed 
rugs, scarves, placemats and tablecloths, effective September 
15, 2003. Ghana-based textile firms already have contracts 
with U.S. distributors and are seeking more. 
Ghana reached its HIPC completion point in July 2004, which 
will result in approximately USD 3.5 billion of debt 
forgiveness from official creditors. 
 
B. Major Issues/Problems Identified 
None 
 
IV. Labor/Child Labor/Human Rights 
 
A. Major Strengths Identified 
Despite some problems in its human rights record, the GoG 
continues to improve its human rights practices. Police 
received training in tactics of non-lethal force and human 
rights protection. 
The GoG has increased its efforts to suppress the trafficking 
in persons through cooperation with NGOs and international 
organizations to identify and return internally trafficked 
children. 
Ghana is a signatory to ILO convention 182 on the worst forms 
of child labor. The GoG has made combating child labor and 
trafficking a high priority. Several Ministries worked 
closely with the ILO to conduct studies on child labor 
exploitation and regional trafficking, including the Ghana 
Statistical Service, which published an ILO-financed survey 
of child labor in Ghana in March 2003. 
NGOs, local and national government participate in West 
Africa Cocoa/Agriculture Project (WACAP), an international, 
public-private effort to eliminate the worst forms of child 
labor from the cocoa industry. 
In conjunction with ILO/IPEC, IOM has successfully freed 
hundreds of children as young as four years old from forced, 
hazardous labor in the Lake Volta fishing industry. 
Ghana is working closely with the U.S. and other donor 
countries to assess the extent of the problem of 
international trafficking in women. The GoG and local NGOs 
are continuing on an extensive public education campaign 
begun last year against domestic violence, contributing to 
public debate about draft domestic violence legislation. The 
GoG also strengthened the Women and Juvenile Unit of the 
Police to combat crimes against women and children and the 
courts increasingly gave longer sentences for those crimes. 
Labor unions enjoy substantial legal protections in Ghana, 
and many operate in both the public and private sectors. 
Various affiliates of the Trade Union Congress are actively 
involved in organizing workers in the informal sector around 
issues of health and safety, hours of work, annual leave, and 
medical care. 
In July 2003, the National Labor Commission, an independent 
body that arbitrates labor disputes, was established to bring 
Ghana,s labor laws into conformity with ILO Convention. 
In October a new union, the Union of Industry, Commercia and 
Financial Workers (UNICOF) was incorporated, representing the 
interests of workers at Ghana Commercial Bank, Standard and 
Chartered Bank, Ghana National Procurement Agency, Ghana 
Airways Pilots Association, and Agricultural Development 
Bank, among others. 
 
B. Major Issues/Problems Identified 
There were reports that the GOG was intolerant of opposing 
views and reacted by bringing dissenters in for questioning 
by the Bureau of National Investigations or the National 
Security Agency. Children as young as four years old are 
forced into dangerous work in the fishing industry via 
arrangements in which their parents get around $180 per year 
for their service.  Aided by international organizations, the 
GoG is working to eliminate this practice, and the incidence 
of this practice is declining, but the GoG still has not 
passed an anti-trafficking law despite drafting a bill for 
well over two years. 
Police use of excessive force resulted in several 
extra-judicial killings as well as injuries. Corruption 
amongst police, who set up barriers to bribe motorists, and 
judicial officials, who accept bribes in exchange for 
expedited or postponed cases or losing records, remained a 
serious problem. 
Child labor was a problem in the informal sector, and forced 
child labor and trafficking in persons were problems. 
Trokosi, a traditional form of ritual servitude, was 
practiced on a limited scale in one region of the country. 
 
V. International Terrorism/U.S. National Security 
 
A. Major Strengths Identified 
The GoG has been explicit in its sympathy with the U.S. over 
September 11, and has since ratified or acceded to all 
international anti-terrorism conventions. 
 
B. Major Issues/Problems Identified 
None

SUBJECT:  UNHCR SIGNS REPATRIATON AGREEMENT FOR LIBERIAN REFUGEES IN 
GHANA; REPORT OF FIRST DARFUR REFUGEES 
 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The United Nations High Commission for Refugees 
(UNHCR), the GOG, and the Government of Liberia signed a landmark 
agreement on September 22 in Accra, providing for the voluntary 
repatriation of Liberian refugees living in Ghana. Unlike the flawed 
repatriation attempted during the 1990\'s, prospects for a more 
durable solution for these Liberian refugees now appear brighter. 
We expect few Liberians living in Ghana to repatriate immediately, 
though improving conditions, particularly in the eastern Liberian 
counties, could eventually lead to a larger exodus.  Visiting UNHCR 
Assistant High Commissioner told Emboffs he favored continuing with 
resettlement of Liberian refugees from Ghana in tandem with 
voluntary repatriation.  There have also been media reports of some 
60 refugees from Darfur, Sudan, entering Ghana.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------- 
Come On Home 
------------- 
 
2.  (U) Officials representing the UNHCR, GOG, and GOL signed a 
repatriation agreement on September 22 that proffers a legal and 
operational framework for the orderly, voluntary return of Liberian 
refugees.    Both UNHCR and the International Organization for 
Migration (IOM) will assist with logistics, with most refugees in 
Ghana expected to travel by boat.  UNHCR will provide food, basic 
household items, and tools to refugees upon arrival in Liberia, 
while the GOL will assist with the recovery of property and the re- 
certification of academic credentials. 
 
3.  (SBU)  The agreement is the culmination of many months of 
speculation that have left some refugees apprehensive, since many 
remember the failed repatriation attempts of the 1990\'s.  This time, 
UNHCR is striving for a better organized, more deliberate 
repatriation.  UNHCR reps told poloff and RefCoord that the UNHCR 
plans to sign similar repatriation agreements with Sierra Leone and 
Cote D\'Ivoire within the next week.  UNHCR is also planning to sign 
repatriation memoranda of understanding with other West African 
countries hosting large numbers of Liberians.  This would form part 
of UNHCR\'s assisted repatriation of up to 29,000 refugees from 
throughout West Africa over the next three months. 
 
------------------------ 
Resettlement to Continue 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU)  Visiting UN Assistant High Commissioner for Refugees 
Kamel Morjane told Emboffs that he favored the continuation of 
resettlement efforts while the repatriation was underway, although 
he acknowledged this matter had been a subject of intense internal 
debate during his visit here.  He hoped for USG cooperation in 
establishing more transparent criteria for resettlement in the U.S., 
noting that any refugee in his right mind with hopes of living in 
the U.S. would never opt for repatriation to Liberia.  He and UNHCR 
Ghana representative Thomas Albrecht (protect) said they would not 
want to guess how many Liberians in Ghana would initially seek 
repatriation, although UNHCR has estimated the number at 2,700, in 
addition to 300 who would repatriate on their own without 
assistance.  Morjane expected many refugees to be reticent to 
repatriate in light of their concerns over security in Liberia, 
schooling for their children, health, and the ability to earn a 
livelihood.  However, Albrecht was somewhat more hopeful, saying 
that Liberian refugees in Ghana are cautious but eager to return 
home. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Trickle of Darfur Refugees in Ghana 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Meanwhile, a trickle of refugees from other countries, 
principally Sudan and Cote d\'Ivoire has been arriving in Ghana at 
the rate of about 50 per week for the past several weeks.  According 
to the September 21 Ghana Times, some 60 refugees from Sudan\'s 
Darfur region arrived in Ghana this week.  A member of the Ghana 
Refugee Board confirmed to Refcoord that the GOG has given them 
temporary shelter.  Some Sudanese and Ivorian refugees have settled 
provisionally at the predominantly Liberian Budumburam refugee camp 
west of Accra, while others have opted for the predominantly Sierra 
Leonan camp of Krisna, in Ghana\'s southwestern corner.  While the 
UNHCR has assumed initial responsibility for them, the newly 
reconstituted Ghana Refugee Board will determine whether these new 
arrivals qualify for refugee status.  Morjane told Emboffs that 
Ghana\'s reputation for stability was probably the main drawing card 
for these refugees.  While the Ivorians arrive overland or by boat 
with little difficulty, the Sudanese head south on foot, often aided 
by sympathetic truck drivers and immigration control officers along 
their arduous journey. 
 
------- 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Most Ghanaians will probably welcome the repatriation 
agreement.  Many people here - and most government officials - 
regard the Liberian refugees as an unsustainable burden and there 
are some concerns about criminality among Liberian refugees. 
Nonetheless, there is not significant pressure to be rid of the 
Liberian refugees.  According to Morjane, Ghana\'s Minister of 
Interior told him before the public signing ceremony that, while he 
would have to make some public criticism of the presence of Liberian 
refugees here, he saw these Liberians as \"brothers\" whom Ghana had 
to help.  The Ghanaian Times feature editorial on September 22 cited 
the reported arrival of Darfur refugees as \"certainly 
startling.their arrival has forcefully brought Darfur to our 
doorstep.\" Nonetheless, the editorial did not raise concerns about 
the presence of these refugees here, noting that, together with the 
signing of the Liberian repatriation agreement on UN International 
Peace Day, they serve as \"a reminder to every Ghanaian of the 
necessity of maintaining the relative peace and stability in the 
country.\"  Some observers point out that these refugees require few 
government services and generate business for local shops.  Over the 
near term, we anticipate little enthusiasm among Ghana\'s 42,000- 
strong Liberian community for repatriation, since most of them hail 
from eastern counties that have not yet been declared safe. Most of 
the initial tranche of Liberians voluntarily repatriating are more 
likely to come from other countries in the region.

CAPACITY IN GHANA 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. Two key INL programs moved forward in Ghana recently, with 
the completion of anti-corruption training for the Ghana 
Customs and Excise Protective Service (CEPS) and the donation 
of forty patrol bicycles to the Ghana Police Service (GPS). 
Both programs were well-received and well-attended by host 
government officials and officers, and the bicycle handover 
ceremony garnered significant local press coverage. The use 
of INL funding to support these initiatives enhances the 
capacity for the creation of an internal affairs unit in CEPS 
and a community policing program in the GPS. End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
BUILDING CAPACITY FOR CUSTOMS INTERNAL AFFAIRS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. On August 17-20, two trainers from the US Customs and 
Border Protection and the regional Customs representative in 
Paris conducted anti-corruption training with 35 mid- to 
senior-level officers of the CEPS in Accra. The training 
followed a needs assessment conducted by USCBP in December 
2003 of CEPS\' ability to monitor and control corruption 
within its own agency. A follow-up assessment will be 
conducted in early 2005. 
 
3. In an address to open the training, the Commissioner of 
CEPS, Brigadier-General Richardson E. Baiden said, \"As a 
service determined to create a new corporate image for 
itself, we are determined to prevent and control corruption 
in our midst by the implementation of a range of appropriate 
monitoring and control mechanisms such as internal check 
programs, internal and external auditing, and investigation 
and prosecution regimes.\" Noting that the Ghanaian government 
has committed itself to a \"zero tolerance policy on 
corruption\", Baiden promised to follow through with the 
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning to secure office 
space outside the main CEPS headquarters, which could enable 
the internal affairs unit to operate more efficiently and 
judiciously. 
 
4. The participation of the Customs representative from Paris 
enabled CEPS officers to learn more about the Customs Mutual 
Assistance Agreement (CMAA), a bilateral agreement between 
the USG and GOG signed in December 2003 that is intended to 
assist both countries in the prevention and investigation of 
customs offenses. Although the CMAA had been in effect for 
nearly nine months at the time of the training, virtually 
none of the CEPS training participants were aware that it 
existed. By the end of the training, the officers were better 
informed about the nature of the CMAA and how they could 
incorporate it into their investigations.

BICYCLES FOR COMMUNITY POLICING 
------------------------------- 
 
5. On August 28, the US Embassy donated forty patrol bicycles 
to the Ghana Police Service (GPS) to support its ongoing 
community policing program. This program, established with 
the assistance of ICITAP in 2002, has so far only operated in 
one district in Accra. With the addition of forty bicycles to 
its existing stock, the GPS plans to expand the community 
policing program to the capital of the Ashanti region, 
Kumasi. At the ceremony to hand over the bicycles, the Chief 
Director for the Ministry of Interior, Mr. Edwin Barnes, 
thanked the USG for its ongoing support of this program and 
encouraged the police officers to use the bicycles to 
strengthen community policing in Ghana. A representative of 
the GPS and Embassy\'s PolOff also made remarks to acknowledge 
the donation. 
 
6. The handover received widespread local news coverage, as 
well as requests from both the GPS and the Ministry of 
Interior for further assistance to the police. The GPS 
reportedly plans to train the Kumasi police on the bicycles 
by the end of September. The extensive press coverage of the 
bike handover has reinforced to the public our partnership in 
improving law enforcement. These INL programs should help 
reinforce the anti-corruption message and capabilities in 
Ghana, and enhance efforts at community policing.

1.  (C)  Summary:  On September 21, Charge and poloffs met 
with leaders of the National Reform Party (NRP).  A minor 
party with no presidential candidate in the December 
elections, the NRP is contesting in ten parliamentary seats 
and hopes its anti-corruption/good grassroots governance 
message will influence the political debate.  The NRP 
predicts the eventual decline and break-up of whichever major 
party loses the election.  They hope the USG can help 
convince Ghanaian President Kufuor not to exaggerate security 
concerns in the election and can bolster the efforts of the 
Election Commission.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  On September 21, Charge and poloffs hosted a lunch 
for National Reform Party (NRP) leader Augustus \"Goosie\" 
Tanoh and several other NRP officials to discuss the December 
election and the NRP\'s political views.  Charge noted that we 
were meeting with all the political parties, as well as the 
Election Commission and others, to reinforce our hope for a 
free and fair election in Ghana and to explore what useful 
role the USG might play in the process. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  The NRP was founded in 2000 by a break-away group 
from National Democratic Congress (NDC).  The NRP got only 
about one percent of the vote in the 2000 national elections 
and won no seats in parliament.  However, observers believe 
its participation in the election cost the NDC fifteen 
parliamentary seats, ultimately benefiting the National 
Patriotic Party (NPP) and some independent candidates.  At a 
September 2004 Delegate Congress, the NRP decided that 
because of its severe financial difficulties it would not 
field a presidential candidate in 2004, although it would 
support some parliamentary candidates.  Goosie Tanoh, the 
NRP\'s presidential candidate in 2000, is a former lawyer and 
DCM in the Ghanaian Mission to the United Nations and now 
runs a food exporting company. 
 
NRP Sitting Out This Election 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Tanoh told Charge the NRP would field ten 
parliamentary candidates but would stay out of the 
presidential race and avoid choosing between the NDC and NPP. 
 The NRP was in a \"lifetime pursuit\" of better governance in 
Ghana, stressing greater community involvement, devolution of 
power, and improved public accountability.  The NRP seeks a 
greater policy role for local district assemblies, the direct 
election of district chief executives, and increased capacity 
building and resource devolution at local levels.  Tanoh and 
his colleagues highlighted inadequacies and corruption in 
education and health.  He said the party was still developing 
its manifesto, although it would not change significantly 
from its left-of-center 2000 election manifesto. 
 
A Make or Break Election 
------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) Tanoh opined that the 2004 election would be close 
and peaceful.  He dismissed concerns raised by some in the 
NPP that the NDC was recruiting foreign mercenaries to 
disrupt the upcoming elections.  This was unfounded 
fear-mongering by Ghanaian security forces seeking to bolster 
their own importance, Tanoh said.  Nonetheless, he predicted 
a major post-election realignment.  Both the NPP and NDC are 
split by strong internal divisions which are being suppressed 
for the election campaign, he said.  Some in the NDC see 
presidential candidate John Evans Atta Mills as an outsider 
and some have a strong dislike for former president J.J. 
Rawlings.  Elements in the NPP dislike its candidate, 
President John Kufuor, and foresee a succession crisis when 
he leaves the political stage.  Whichever party loses this 
election will \"begin a long tailspin of disintegration\", 
according to Tanoh.  With so much at stake, corruption is 
rampant in both camps - individuals are paying large sums to 
get party tickets, businesses are being squeezed for funds, 
and voters are being wooed with money and contracts, Tanoh 
alleged. 
 
What the USG Can Do? 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Charge asked Tanoh what useful role he thought the 
USG and other foreign governments can play in the upcoming 
elections.  Tanoh hoped the USG could help convince President 
Kufuor not to exaggerate securty concerns in this election. 
He urged moral supprt for the Election Commission, which he 
criticied as \"very laid back\" about election-related 
prblems.  USG and other foreign obsrvers would help lend 
 
 
credibility to the election process, especially if the 
results are close. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  Without a single parliamentary seat and unable to 
forge an alliance with other small parties, the NRP is at 
present a minor force in Ghanaian politics.  As reported 
reftel, in a lunch former US Ambassador Robinson hosted for 
Tanoh before the 2000 election, the candidate was brimming 
with confidence and outlined a clear stance on a range of 
economic and social issues.   This week he was low-key and 
cynical.  He had difficulty describing the NRP\'s plank and 
appeared to lack hands-on knowledge about party activities. 
He complained about politically-motivated efforts by the NPP 
to undermine his business interests.  He and his colleagues 
appear to be waiting on the sidelines of Ghanaian politics to 
play a more prominent role when, in their estimation, the two 
major parties eventually collapse.  In our view, neither the 
NPP nor the NDC appear on a path toward disintegration any 
time soon.

1.  (C)  Summary: On September 22, Charge and Poloffs hosted 
a lunch for National Democratic Congress (NDC) presidential 
candidate Atta Mills and several senior party lieutenants to 
discuss the upcoming election.  Mills was predictably 
critical of the ruling National Patriotic Party (NPP)\'s 
performance, stating that Ghanaians had not improved their 
economic status under President Kufuor.  Mills criticized the 
voter registration process and said the Electoral Commission 
was indifferent to NDC complaints. He expects a peaceful 
election, noting police cooperation and denying NPP 
allegations that the NDC is working with foreign mercenaries 
to disrupt the polling.  He hoped the USG would help 
strengthen Electoral Commission efforts.  When asked about 
the National Reconciliation Commission, he said that, if 
elected, he would review the NRC report and might implement 
recommendations which are based on findings he views as 
accurate.  However, if the report is biased (as he 
anticipates), Mills would constitute a new commission to 
conduct a fresh investigation.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Charge and Poloffs hosted a lunch on September 22, 
2004 for Professor John Evans Atta Mills, former Vice 
President and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) 
presidential candidate in Ghana\'s upcoming election, along 
with several other senior party officials, to discuss 
election developments. Charge explained that we were meeting 
with all of Ghana\'s political parties, as well as the 
Electoral Commission and civil society members, to express 
our support for a free and fair election and explore what 
role in the process the USG might usefully play. 
 
\"We Tell the Truth\" 
------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Mills believed Ghanaians would vote NDC because \"we 
tell the truth.\"  The truth, he said, was that most people in 
Ghana did not feel their welfare had improved under the 
current NPP government.  On the campaign trail, he was 
hearing frequent complaints about high priced utilities and 
school fees, despite earlier NPP promises to bring down these 
costs.  The NPP was untruthful about its achievements in 
health care, education, agricultural projects and other 
areas, Mills said.  He criticized the NPP as highly corrupt, 
allegedly using funds gotten through the Heavily Indebted 
Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative as a slush fund without 
accountability to Parliament.  The NPP was milking candidates 
and businessmen for money and nurturing nepotism at top 
levels of government, he claimed. 
 
4.  (C)  By contrast, if elected, Mills said he would stand 
for \"truth, sincerity and modesty\".  There would be 
significant continuity in foreign policy, with strong support 
for ECOWAS, the UN, EU and United States.  He would make a 
greater effort to resolve the crisis in the Ivory Coast, 
given efforts by the former NDC government to help in Liberia 
and Sierra Leone.  While the situation in the Ivory Coast was 
not a factor in this election, it has the potential to 
increase the presence of illegal arms in Ghana, which could 
be used in fueling disputes between traditional chiefs, Mills 
noted. 
 
5.  (C)  Poloff asked Mills what an NDC victory would mean 
for the National Reconciliation Commission (NRC), which has 
completed its hearings (but not yet issued a final report) on 
alleged human rights abuses that took place between 1957 and 
1993 (Note: a majority of the alleged abuses occurred under 
the PNDC\'s rule.  End note.)  Mills said he would study the 
NRC report and implement the portions that appeared 
\"logical\".  While not condemning the NR process, he said he 
would not accept thereport wholesale.  If the report is 
biased, he would set up a new, bipartisan commission to give 
the process a fresh start. 
 
Concerns about Fairness 
----------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Mills and other NDC officials revisited 
long-standing suspicions about the fairness and effectiveness 
of the voter registration process organized by the Electoral 
Commission (EC).  The Electoral Commission allowed more time 
for registration in the Ashanti region, stronghold of the 
ruling NPP, than in traditional NDC areas, they claimed. 
Many voters from the northern regions working in the south 
were unable to travel to register.  The NDC reps alleged that 
a three-day strike by some EC workers demanding better pay 
undermined the NDC in certain regions.  In their travels in 
Wa and Bolgatanga, NDC reps witnessed shortages of election 
registration materials.  Thousands in Accra were unable to 
reach remote registration areas.  The NDC is concerned that, 
on election day, some EC officials may arrive late or abandon 
 
 
their positions in NDC-dominated regions. 
 
7.  (C)  The NDC reps said they have raised these concerns 
repeatedly with the EC, so far with little corrective action. 
 While Mills thought the EC was not ill-intentioned, he saw 
them as \"indifferent\" and hampered by insufficient resources. 
 The EC reportedly refused to reopen the registration 
process, as requested by the NDC.  Mills acknowledged that 
the EC had committed to a \"mopping up\" exercise to register 
voters previously unable to provide the photos needed to 
complete the process.  However, Mills said he could not judge 
the success of this effort until the EC publishes its final 
registration roster. 
 
Expects Peaceful Election 
------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Mills expects a peaceful election.  He will insist 
to his party that it conduct itself in a peaceful manner, he 
emphasized, adding that he would nonetheless remain on guard 
against rigging.  The police were \"generally very 
cooperative\", although he thought some new recruits were 
biased toward the NPP.  He emphatically rejected allegations 
made by some in the NPP that the NDC is recruiting foreign 
mercenaries to disrupt the eletions.  The NDC had no need of 
mercenaries, he sid, noting that the paty gave up power 
voluntarly after losing the 2000 election. 
 
What Can the USG Do? 
-------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Charge asked what role the USG might constructively 
play in this election process.  Mills said the USG could 
encourage the Electoral Commission in its mandate to ensure a 
free and fair election.  He hoped we would share concerns 
about the need for adequate election material in all regions. 
 Working through the EC, donors might also help fund the 
participation of party poll watchers from the smaller parties 
unable to afford national coverage.  Charge said we would 
engage the EC in a similar discussion of the 2004 elections. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C)  Mills\' complaints about the registration process 
were similar to concerns expressed in a June meeting with 
Ambassador Yates (reftel).  The registration process has had 
some hiccups and other observers have been critical of the 
Electoral Commission for its perceived lack of diligence.  We 
will be meeting with the EC and others to better assess the 
status of the registration process, which reportedly has been 
extended until September 30.  Mills\' commitment to a peaceful 
election went a step further than during his June meeting. 
He was less compelling when Charge asked why he thought 
Ghanaians should vote for the NDC.  He offered few specifics 
on substantive policy differences with the NPP.  He clearly 
sees the current makeup of the National Reconciliation 
Commission as biased against the NDC and hypocritical 
(President Kufuor was part of the PNDC regime, Mills 
underscored, alleging that some of the perpetrators being 
investigated are members of the current NPP government).  It 
is not clear what the NDC would do with the NRC process if it 
surprisingly wins the upcoming election.

would encourage the New Forces \"to show flexibility and 
goodwill in the requirement for disarmament as per the 
Accord\". 
 
--The Commission commended UNOCI for its assurances on 
contingency plans to handle any reversal of the current level 
of security in Cote d\'Ivoire.  The ECOWAS Authority agreed to 
engage UNHQ regarding the outstanding aviation unit required 
by UNOCI.

based on a figure of 100,000. 
 
--The ECOWAS Authority would be requested to employ its good 
offices to resolve the leadership crisis within the LURD 
faction in Liberia to avoid any conflicts that might derail 
the peace process.

Comment 
------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Participants in the meeting saw this meeting as 
particularly productive and cooperative.  The attendance 
level of Defense Chiefs was excellent.  They agreed on 
pledges for the standby force on the first day of the 
meeting.  In his closing remarks, General Obeng stressed the 
need for ECOWAS to have a positive influence in seeking peace 
in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Cote d\'Ivoire.  Given the 
goodwill expressed at this meeting, Obeng saw the possibility 
of an \"over-subscribed\" standby-force.  Funding and logistics 
for this force will be taken up at the November 22-23 donors 
conference in Abuja. The British official acknowledged to 
poloff that it was appropriate for protocol reasons that the 
request for forces to Darfur be routed via the AU.  A 
representative from Mali approached him privately about 
contributing to a Darfur force.  Dr. Charles Grimm, US 
Advisor for Defense and Security Affairs to ECOWAS, told 
Emboffs he was delighted with the outcome and atmospherics of 
the meeting, although he thought it unlikely ECOWAS would 
offer troops to Darfur, given the lack of available officer 
staff in member countries.  We will forward a copy of the 
final meeting report to desk as soon as possible.

Summary 
------- 
1. (C) Charge and EconChief met with Amcit representatives of 
Ghana International Air (GIA) to discuss its agreement with 
the Government of Ghana (GoG) to create a new airline to take 
over Ghana Air\'s routes.  GIA reps confirmed that the GoG and 
GIA have agreed to form a partnership, with the GoG taking a 
70 percent stake in the new company and GIA taking 30 percent 
with full operational control.  The GoG will be responsible 
for Ghana Air\'s debt and employees.  GIA will seek equity 
investments to fund equipment purchases and aircraft leases. 
It intends to take over Ghana Air\'s U.S., Europe and regional 
routes early in 2005.  The deal has generated much local 
skepticism and opposition, including from the IMF and Ghana 
Air\'s management.  Post raised its own concerns during the 
meeting. End Summary 
 
GIA Reps Outline Deal with Government 
------------------------------------- 
2. (C) Charge and EconChief met September 24 with Kirk 
Heaton, Executive Vice President of Sentry Financial 
Corporation, which handles financial arrangements for GIA. 
Heaton was in Ghana representing the U.S. investors behind 
GIA, led by SkyWest Airline founder Ralph Atkin.  GIA signed 
a Letter of Intent with the GoG on September 1 to create an 
airline company to take over the routes currently flown by 
national air carrier Ghana Air (Note:  see reftels for 
background on Ghana Air.  End Note).  This new airline, to be 
named later, will not take over Ghana Air, so will not have 
responsibility for Ghana Air\'s employees or financial 
liabilities. 
 
3. (C) Under the Letter of Intent, the GoG agrees to wind 
down Ghana Air in preparation for a hand off to a new airline 
in early 2005.  This will entail valuing Ghana Air\'s assets, 
dealing with Ghana Air\'s employees, and assuming Ghana Air\'s 
estimated USD 160 million debt. 
 
4. (C) The GoG will initially own 70 percent of the new 
airline.  GIA will take a 30 percent stake, but will retain 
full operational control.  Heaton stated the GoG will have 
seats on the board of directors, but will participate as a 
\"silent partner.\"  Both sides agreed to put up an initial 
investment of USD 7 million, split 70/30, as operating 
capital. 
 
5. (C) GIA is working to raise an additional USD 30 to 50 
million from equity partners, targeting three types of 
investors:  1) strategic partners, mainly other airlines; 2) 
aircraft leasing companies; and 3) pure equity investors. 
The outside equity will dilute the GoG and GIA\'s holdings, 
lowering the GoG\'s stake below 50 percent.  GoG Transport 
Minister Richard Anane has discussed diluting GoG ownership 
further by floating shares on the Ghana Stock Exchange. 
 
6. (C) The GoG has \"ring fenced\" the USD 160 million debt, 
and will handle all negotiations with creditors (Note:  Post 
has heard that up to two thirds of the debt is owed to GoG or 
quasi-GoG institutions, and only about USD 70 million is owed 
to outside creditors.  End Note).  The GoG has agreed to lay 
off Ghana Air\'s estimated 1200 to 1600 employees.  GIA will 
poach Ghana Air\'s best employees, including most of its 
pilots, and its goal is to operate Ghana Air\'s routes with 
fewer than 250 employees. 
 
7. (C) GIA has also agreed to \"consider\" purchasing some of 
Ghana Air\'s assets from the GoG.  Given that Ghana Air is 
flying all its routes with leased aircraft, its assets are 
likely to have minimal value.  The GoG has stated it will 
liquidate the assets that GIA does not want. 
 
Timeline 
-------- 
8. (C) GIA is coordinating with Ghana Civil Aviation 
Authority (GCAA) to register and certify the new airline. 
Heaton said GIA would submit the appropriate application to 
GCAA within 60-90 days and estimated the GCAA would take two 
months to approve it.  GIA will use this period to raise the 
equity, hire employees, train pilots, and lease six Boeing 
aircraft (two each for the U.S., Europe, and regional 
routes).  After a few years of operations, GIA will approach 
OPIC and ExImBank for assistance with a second round of 
financing to expand the fleet.  GIA will immediately seek to 
establish linkages and join alliances with other airlines, 
with the goal of making the new airline the company of choice 
to partner with for flights to Africa. 
 
Local Reaction 
-------------- 
9. (C) Post has found few supporters of this deal outside 
government.  There are allegations of lack of transparency in 
the bidding process.  KLM, which bid on the deal but dropped 
out, argues that the Transport Ministry did not specify that 
the GoG would assume Ghana Air\'s USD 160 million debt.  Ex 
Ghana Air CEO, Philip Owusu, alleges that GIA has \"secret\" 
Ghanaian partners, who are the true force behind this deal. 
He claims that only GIA knew the GoG would assume the debt, 
so the deal was fixed from the start. 
 
10. (C) Other local observers, especially in the media, argue 
that GIA does not have the capacity or financial wherewithal 
to build a strong Ghanaian airline.  A frequently heard 
criticism is that the GoG should have chosen an established 
airline to save Ghana Air.  Ghana Air\'s current management 
argues this, and lobbied President Kufuor to oppose the GIA 
deal and instead support a Ghana Air partnership with 
Ethiopia Air. 
 
11. (C) IMF Resident Representative Alpha Muttardi also 
opposes the arrangement, and has lobbied the GoG to drop the 
deal.  She told EconChief that GoG assumption of the debt 
could undermine the IMF program.  Heaton claims President 
Kufuor personally intervened to conclude the deal with GIA, 
so the IMF\'s lobbying may have little effect. 
 
Comment 
------- 
12. (C) Charge and EconChief urged Heaton and GIA investors 
to research the problems other investors have experienced in 
Ghana.  Most recent disputes with the GoG resulted at least 
in part because the investors did not adequately document the 
division of rights and obligations with the GoG.  This may 
become a problem with the current deal.  GIA decided to sign 
a letter of intent with the GoG, rather than signing an 
agreement that would require Parliamentary approval. 
Although GIA did this on purpose to avoid Parliamentary 
delays, an approved agreement would provide more security to 
the investors.  GIA\'s tentative agreement to consider buying 
Ghana Air assets may also ultimately be problematic.  GoG 
officials consider verbal assurances tantamount to 
obligations, and have created obstacles to investors who 
failed to follow through on the purchase of local equipment. 
 
13. (C) GIA is following the old model of working directly 
with the President, and is keeping its intentions (and 
identity of its investors) close-hold.  However, Ghana Air is 
one of the more controversial subjects in Ghana, and as 
Kaiser Aluminum has discovered a deal with the President does 
not protect you from the other powerful forces in this 
increasingly decentralized democracy.  Cabinet Ministers, 
Parliamentarians, bureaucrats and private parties are 
increasingly influential, and GIA\'s many opponents may be 
waiting for their opportunity to undercut the new airline. 
 
14. (C) EconChief alerted Heaton of the impending FAA 
reassessment of civil aviation safety oversight, which could 
result in a downgrade to Category Two.  Heaton said he was 
well aware of the upcoming FAA visit and has offered 
technical assistance to the GoG and GCAA to help them retain 
Category One.  End Comment

1.  (C) SUMMARAY: Western Wireless International (WWI) told 
post they filed on September 21 for international arbitration 
to settle subsidiary Westel\'s seven-year-old dispute with the 
GoG.  According to Westel\'s Managing Director Bill Taylor, 
WWI will not fund any further expansion in Ghana and is ready 
to pull out of the country completely if the situation does 
not improve.  Taylor also expressed fears that the GoG may 
retaliate by trying to undermine Westel\'s existing operation. 
 The GoG claims they will comply with their contractual 
obligation to arbitration.  Post will monitor the process. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) WWI is seeking USD 60 million in lost revenue and 
punitive damages, claiming that the GoG\'s failure to provide 
frequencies for Westel\'s wireless operations amount to de 
facto expropriation of WWI\'s investment.  Two years ago 
Westel agreed to pay an \"uncontested amount\" to the GoG of 
USD 25 million to settle all outstanding issues with the GoG, 
but the frequencies were not forthcoming, so the money was 
not paid.  The GoG claims the amount was actually a fine for 
Westel\'s failure to meet its contractual obligations to 
develop their network.  Furthermore, the GoG imposed an 
additional \"spectrum fee\" of USD 27.5 million late last year 
on the valuable 1800 and 1900 spectrum Westel insists it 
needs to be viable.  Westel argues that these fees have been 
imposed retroactively without the due process required by 
their contract.  Westel also claims the fees are arbitrary, 
since the five other wireless operators in Ghana have only 
been assessed USD 20 million each.  Communications Minister 
Kan-Dapaah told DCM and EconOff that none of the wireless 
operators had paid the spectrum fee yet, and that no specific 
enforcement system or plans currently existed if they 
refused.  The Minister said that since Westel has no 
established mobile service it couldn\'t expect to pay the same 
spectrum fees as those who do. 
 
3.  (C) Westel officials met unsuccessfully with President 
Kufuor earlier this year in a last-ditch attempt to reach an 
agreement (reftel).  In June, however, the GoG granted formal 
licenses to mobile operators that were, in Westel\'s opinion, 
squatting on frequencies that the GoG was contractually 
obliged to provide to Westel, effectively locking Westel out 
of the mobile market.  Even then, Westel felt its operation 
could be viable if the spectrum fee were dropped, but the GoG 
would not budge.  According to Bill Taylor, WWI will not 
provide any new resources for the operation in Ghana and is 
considering pulling out all together, thus abandoning the 
3000 land-based customers it already has.  This could 
inconvenience other foreign investors, such as Newmont Gold 
Mining\'s $450 million dollar Bram-Ahafo project.  According 
to Newmont\'s IT manager in Accra, Westel\'s service and 
equipment are the only viable option in Ghana for Newmont. 
State-owned Ghana Telecom (GT) does not provide comparable 
service, regardless of price. 
 
4.  (C) Bill Taylor fears the GoG could use GT to undermine 
Westel\'s existing operations.  To support this he cites a 
string of incidents in which GT has either delayed or simply 
not complied with GoG directives governing the integration of 
Westel\'s land-based systems.  Westel does, however, hold hope 
that a settlement can still be reached if the spectrum fee is 
rescinded. 
 
5. (C) Comment.  Although the facts in WWI\'s complaint are 
accurate, Westel also has some respnsibility for the current 
mess.  It partnered with a questionable parastatel company 
and inadequately documented spectrum in its initial 
agreement.  The problem was exacerbated when Westel agreed to 
pay the USD 25 million uncontested amount, which is 
universally seen as an admission of guilt.  Westel\'s 
agreement to pay without a written agreement on spectrum only 
compounded its problem.  Communications Minister Kan-Dapaah 
said he \"would not stand in the way\" if Westel wanted 
arbitration and added that the matter is now out of his 
hands.  Nevertheless, Post will watch to ensure the GoG lives 
up to its contractual obligation to participate fully in 
international arbitration. End Comment.

1. (SBU)  Summary:  With slightly over two months to go 
before Ghana\'s presidential and parliamentary elections, the 
two major political parties have launched their campaigns, 
published manifestos and announced their vice-presidential 
candidates. Other minor parties remain disorganized.  The 
pre-election mood is relatively calm, despite a few isolated 
incidents of violence. The primaries, which are still 
ongoing, have knocked out several incumbents, including two 
Ministers of State. The Electoral Commission (EC) had some 
difficulties with the voter registration and extended its 
\'mopping up\' registration exercise until September 30. 
Opposition contacts are frustrated with the alleged advantage 
the incumbent President has had in garnering media coverage, 
with the EC\'s problems in the registration process, and with 
its inability to respond convincingly to complaints.  The 
publication of the voter register in mid-October will be an 
important milestone in reinforcing (or further undermining) 
confidence in Ghana\'s election process. End summary. 
 
---------------- 
FOUR IN THE RING 
---------------- 
 
2.  (U)  While candidates cannot submit their official 
nominations to the Electoral Commission until mid-October, at 
this point there are four declared presidential candidates: 
President John Kufuour of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), John 
Evans Atta Mills of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), 
Convention People\'s Party (CPP) leader George Aggudey, and 
Dr. Edward Mahama of the People\'s National Convention (PNC) 
party.  On October 1, the PNC joined with two other small 
parties, the Great Consolidated Popular Party (GCPP) and the 
Every Accountable Ghanain Living Everywhere (EGLE) party to 
form a \"Grand Coalition\" to support PNC presidential 
candidate Mahama.  On October 2, GCPP leader Dan Lartey 
argued he should be the presidential candidate instead of 
Mahama -- and the coalition fell apart.  Although discussions 
between the parties are ongoing, most observers are skeptical 
the coalition will come together with any strength. 
 
---------------------- 
RUNNING MATES DECLARED 
---------------------- 
 
3. (U)  On September 18, President Kufuor announced that he 
would retain as his running mate current Vice President, 
Alhaji Aliu Mahama. Mahama has been criticized as ineffective 
by some in the NPP, most prominently by Victor Newman, a 
founding member of the party.  Nonetheless, Mahama was 
apparently chosen again because, as a northern Muslim, he 
balances the ticket. 
 
4. (U)  On September 23, the opposition NDC officially 
launched its campaign and selected its own northern Muslim, 
Alhaji Mohammed Mumuni, as a running mate for its 
presidential candidate, John Atta Mills. Mumuni\'s selection 
is seen by some as a strategic move by the NDC to capitalize 
on party line divisions between the Andani and Abudu tribes 
in the north.  On September 28 Mumuni was in a car accident 
(he remains in the hospital) effectively removing him as a 
campaign player for the next few weeks. (See bios in paras 
13, 14). 
 
------------------------------------------- 
INCUMBENTS FLAGGING: THE PRIMARIES CONTINUE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U)  Party members continue with the selection of 
parliamentary candidates through primary elections across the 
country\'s 230 constituencies. While many cabinet members won 
their primaries with ease, some incumbent Members of 
Parliament lost their candidacies, including two Ministers of 
State and several MPs with key positions in the ruling 
government. Senior Minister J.H. Mensah, MP for Sunyani East, 
faced a record five opponents and won his primary only after 
intervention by the President and party headquarters. 
 
6. (U)  Constituents from several constituencies have 
complained that senior NPP officials imposed candidates on 
local constituencies without primary elections. Over the past 
month, in a few instances in Greater Accra, NPP mobs 
physically assaulted regional party leaders to protest the 
imposition of candidates. 
 
------------------- 
MANIFESTOS LAUNCHED 
------------------- 
 
7. (U)  On July 31, the NDC launched its manifesto for the 
2004 election. Entitled \"A Better Ghana\", the manifesto 
predictably directs considerable criticism against the NPP. 
The opening message from the party\'s founder, former 
President Jerry Rawlings, states that \"President Kufuor and 
his NPP promised heaven but have landed Ghanaians in the 
burning flames of hell.\" In his opening remarks, Atta Mills 
promised that the NDC would \"remove the current atmosphere of 
suspicion, mistrust, and marginalization of anyone who is 
assumed to be an ally of the present opposition.\" In its 
manifesto, the NDC acknowledges that global institutions such 
as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank cannot be 
\"wished away\" entirely, but it clearly urges Ghanaians to be 
more independent from the policy prescriptions of these 
organizations. On social, foreign, and regional policies, the 
NDC\'s platform does not differ considerably from the NPP\'s. 
 
8. (U)  On September 18, the NPP launched its own manifesto, 
entitled \"So Far, So Very Good\". The macroeconomic 
achievements of the NPP administration feature prominently. 
In contrast to the NDC, the NPP trumpets its successes with 
international donor institutions. The manifesto praises the 
Kufuor government\'s achievement in reaching HIPC completion 
point in 2004. It also underscores Ghana\'s selection as a 
Millennium Challenge Account prospect. The manifesto 
highlights Ghana\'s first-ever invitation to a G-8 meeting and 
President Kufuor\'s role in ECOWAS. It quotes British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair as saying in May 2004, \"President Kufuor 
is a role model in the African continent and a blazing trail, 
who should be followed and emulated.\" 
 
---------------------- 
\'MOPPING UP\' COMPLETED 
---------------------- 
 
9. (U)  The Electoral Commission is still completing the 
voter registration process. It has finished scanning 
registration forms from all ten regions into a centralized 
database of voters. The EC initiated a \'mopping up\' exercise 
September 3-7 to give all voters who registered during the 
initial registration an opportunity to obtain photo 
identification cards (which are required for voting). Faced 
with logistical challenges, the \'mop up\' was extended until 
September 30. The EC has announced it would publish a 
provisional voter\'s register on October 12-17 for public 
scrutiny. 
 
----------------------------------- 
EXPECTATIONS OF A PEACEFUL ELECTION 
----------------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU)  Observers expect that elections will be generally 
peaceful, although there could be scattered incidents of 
violence.  The past month has been filled with events 
promoting peaceful elections, including a prayer meeting 
attended by visiting Nigerian President Obasanjo.  In a 
demonstration of support for the democratic process, the NPP 
and NDC invited all political parties to address their 
conventions. 
 
11.  (U)  Nonetheless, the selection of two northern Muslim 
vice presidential candidates from opposing clans has the 
potential to fan communal friction in the north.  In the 
northern region of Dagbon, the 2002 murder of the Ya-Na 
Yakubu Andani (king) remains a central and highly divisive 
issue. The NDC has leveraged this issue to disadvantage the 
NPP within the Dagbon traditional area, which encompasses 
twelve constituencies.  Questions still remain about the 
government\'s role during the violent clashes in 2002 and its 
inability to find the murderers of the king and forty other 
victims. The Andanis, who support the NDC, continue to accuse 
the government of playing a central role in the murders. The 
Abudus, who support the NPP, deny the allegations.  According 
to radio reports, on October 3, NPP youth in Yendi (the 
traditional capital of Dagbon) attacked NDC supporters and 
set fire to a local chief\'s palace, resulting in some 
injuries.  The situation in the Dagbon traditional area is 
generally volatile and there could be other incidents of 
small-scale violence in the heat of the election. 
 
----------------------------- 
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT FAIRNESS 
----------------------------- 
 
12.  (C)  At an October 4 pre-election lunch for members of 
civil society, hosted by Charge,  several NGO contacts voiced 
concerns about fairness in the election campaigns.  Like our 
small party contacts, they believe the NPP is using its 
incumbency to garner disproportionate media coverage and 
access to state resources for electoral benefit (although 
they concede some of this is inevitable with an incumbent 
candidate).  Reverend Fred Deegbe, General Secretary of the 
Christian Council of Ghana and a member of the Coalition of 
Domestic Election Observers (CODEO), underscored the need for 
observing and auditing during the pre-election period, which 
he thought is more open to manipulation than the polling on 
election day itself.  CODEA is planning to field over 5,000 
domestic observers, not only for polling day but, for the 
first time, also for a period during the pre-election 
campaign.  The lackluster performance of the Electoral 
Commission has some donors and party contacts worried.  A 
number of contacts have shared concerns that as many as 
700,000 people were reportedly unable to register to vote, 
mostly in regions more likely to support opposition 
candidates.  Donors to the Electoral Commission, particularly 
local British, Canadians and Danish officials, are concerned 
that the EC appears unable to account for its budget and 
reportedly will be seeking an additional 5 million USD to run 
the election. They complain that the EC is inaccessible and 
appears overwhelmed by the massive registration process. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (C)  Just over two months before the December 7 
elections, Ghana is relatively calm and the electoral 
rhetoric is moderate.  President Kufuor has been actively 
touring the country, and the NPP has been effective at 
projecting his engagement in the media.  The NDC has yet to 
hit its stride and the smaller parties are weakened by 
on-again-off-again alliances and a lack of funding.  Some in 
the business community voice ambivalence, unhappy with the 
performance of the NPP government but turned off by former 
NDC President Rawlings, who has been active on the NDC 
campaign trail.  The concerns about fairness in the run-up to 
the election -- while not dissimilar to NPP claims before the 
2000 election -- bear watching.  We will engage the Electoral 
Commission on a range of election issues in the next week. 
The completeness and acceptability of the 
soon-to-be-published voter registration list will be an 
important indicator of whether this election seems to be on 
track.  End Comment.

BRIEF BIOS OF THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
14.  (U)  Alhaji Mohammed Mumuni, 55, is a Muslim Dagomba 
(Adani clan) and the Member of Parliament for Kumbunu, an 
important constituency of Dagbon in the Northern Region.  He 
holds a Master\'s degree in law from the University of Ghana 
and worked as a private lawyer in Tamale and as a District 
Magistrate.  After a falling out with the Convention People\'s 
Party (CPP), Mumuni won his first parliamentary seat in 1996 
as an NDC candidate.  He was Minister of Employment and 
Social Welfare (with Cabinet rank) in the previous NDC 
government and is currently the ranking MP for Legal, 
Constitutional and Parliamentary Affairs. 
 
15.  (C)  Alhaji Aliu Mahama, Ghana\'s current Vice President, 
is a Muslim Dagomba from Yendi (Abudu clan) in the Northern 
Region.  He holds a Bachelors of Science in Building 
Technology from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and 
Technology in Kumasi.  He worked for the now-defunct State 
Construction Corporation and later formed his own civil 
engineering and contracting business.  He served as a local 
Assemblyman for the Tamale Municipal Assembly, was active in 
the Dagbon Youth Association, and quietly supported the NPP 
before being nominated as the NPP\'s vice presidential running 
mate in 2000.  As Vice President, Mahama has earned a 
reputation for integrity and congeniality, although his 
detractors see him as ineffective and unschooled in politics.

1.  (C)  Summary:  Charge hosted a lunch on October 1 for 
Convention People\'s Party (CPP) presidential candidate George 
Aggudey and two of his lieutenants.  They highlighted 
Nkrumahist ideals of self-reliance, state-run industry, and 
\"African solutions\".  Aggudey was unhappy with what he saw as 
the dominance of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the 
pre-election campaign and did not see a role for foreign 
observers.  The CPP has only one seat in parliament and is 
unlikely to be much of a player in the December 7 elections. 
End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  On October 1, Charge and Poloff hosted a lunch for 
George Opesika Aggudey, presidential candidate from the 
Convention People\'s Party (CPP), CPP National Chairman Edmond 
Delle, and CPP General Secretary Nii Noi Dowuona, to discuss 
upcoming national elections.  Charge noted that we were 
having similar meetings with other political parties. 
Background 
---------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  The CPP was founded in 1949 by former President 
Kwame Nkrumah and still espouses a distinctly Nkrumahesque 
view of the world.  The CPP sees itself as a mass party 
representing farmers, fishermen, and the villages.  It 
endorses a strong role for the state and a vision of 
Pan-African empowerment  The CPP won less than 2 percent of 
the vote in the 2000 elections and has only one seat in 
parliament (the First Deputy Speaker of Parliament).  In the 
first half of 2004, four prominent CPP leaders (\"the Gang of 
Four\") urged voters to vote for them on a CPP ticket but vote 
for the NPP\'s presidential candidate.  Although they were 
threatened with suspension from the party, the CPP 
Disciplinary Committee recently reinstated the \"Gang of 
Four\".  Aggudey is lawyer and CEO of Gold Crest Security 
Services.  He is reported to have problems with some CPP 
old-timers, who doubt his leadership abilities. 
 
Through the CPP Looking Glass 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Aggudey and his colleagues underscored the need for 
a large state role in Ghana\'s economy.  They insisted they 
were not anti-business and would not want to nationalize 
industry.  However, businesses should locate outside Accra to 
bring jobs to more rural areas.  The state needed to fill the 
gap where private industry has failed.  Ghana needed to 
improve its self-sufficiency, they said, recalling proudly 
that Ghana used to make its own shoes and light bulbs instead 
of importing them.  When asked what he saw as Ghana\'s 
comparative advantage in industry, Aggudey highlighted the 
potential for beer production.  Ghanaians \"lack a sense of 
permanent interests\" and need to return to \"African 
solutions\".  The CPP would like to redirect and redistribute 
resources.  As for foreign aid, \"you are wasting money on 
us\".  The CPP seeks a more even redistribution of educational 
resources.  Aggudey said he would block all Ghanaians from 
receiving visas to the U.S. as a measure to stem the brain 
drain (CPP National Chairman Delle argued for improving the 
job opportunities in Ghana as a better approach to the 
issue.) 
 
The Election:  The Elephant is a Giant 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Aggudey said he was not happy with the election. 
The NPP is using its incumbency to tip the scales, he argued. 
 \"It will take a long time before the word fairness can be 
used in Ghana\", he proclaimed, concluding that \"The NPP has 
gone from an elephant to a giant, out of control.\" (Note: 
the elephant is the NPP party symbol.  End note.)  The CPP 
had been well received on the campaign trail, he contended, 
noting that he had visited 160 constituencies and planned to 
reach the remaining 70 in the coming months.  The CPP was 
hampered by logistics but confident it would do well. 
Aggudey dismissed the friction over the \"Gang of Four\" as \"a 
thing of the past\" exaggerated by opponents to divide the 
CPP.  He expects a peaceful election, noting that for the 
first time the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the CPP 
are talking and joking with each other  The CPP would not 
join a proposed coalition with other smaller parties and 
would play a key role in what Aggudey saw as a likely run-off 
election.  When asked what role foreign observers could 
usefully play in the election process, Aggudey quipped \"What 
would they do?,\" since any possible manipulation would likely 
occur before election day or would be difficult to detect. 
Too much money had been spent on the Electoral Commission and 
the election process, he said, arguing that donor money would 
be better spent strengthening political parties and election 
financing. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  Delle and Dowuona were articulate, if antiquated and 
convoluted in their views.  Candidate Aggudey, on the other 
hand, was incoherent, with little grasp of issues.  He is 
disliked by some within the CPP, which has hampered the 
party\'s fundraising abilities.  We do not see Aggudey or the 
CPP as a significant player in this election, except perhaps 
if there is a run-off round (as happened in 2000).

SUBJECT: GHANA\'S ELECTORAL COMMISSION CONFIDENT ABOUT 
ELECTIONS 
 
 
Classified By: PolChief Scott Ticknor for reasons 1.5 (d and e). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  Electoral Commission (EC) Chairman Kwado 
Afari-Gyan and other EC members are confident that 
preparations are on track for free and fair presidential and 
parliamentary elections in Ghana.  Afari-Gyan said the EC was 
open to party complaints, and that he did not perceive 
disproportionate media access by the ruling New Patriotic 
Party (NPP), as some in the opposition allege.  He hoped the 
published provisional voting register -- due out on October 
12 -- would not generate many requests for changes, which 
could delay election preparations.  The EC is under tight 
time pressure to complete the registration process and 
legalize the election date in Parliament.  The EC welcomes 
foreign observers but is not actively seeking them.  While 
Afari-Gyan\'s reassurances were convincing, the EC could do a 
better job at communicating with the media and the public. 
End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  On October 6, Charge hosted a lunch for Ghana\'s 
Electoral Commission Chairman Dr. Kwado Afari-Gyan and five 
of the other six members of the Electoral Commission (EC). 
Charge noted that the Embassy was meeting with all the 
political parties and members of civil society, in addition 
to the EC, to discuss the upcoming elections. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  Ghana\'s Electoral Commission (EC) was established 
under the 1992 constitution, with primary responsibility for 
conducting all elections in a free and fair manner.  The EC 
has seven members, headed by a Chairman, and a staff of 1,300 
people.  EC members are nominated by the President (with the 
advice of the Council of State, a group of eminent private 
citizens) and they serve until retirement at age 60.  Ghana\'s 
EC has earned a good reputation.  Chairman Afari-Gyan is seen 
as impartial and firm, but has become somewhat of a recluse. 
 
The Election \"A Bit Tight\" 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Afari-Gyan painted a confident picture of the EC and 
preparations for the upcoming election.  He conceded that 
preparations were \"a bit tight\" on time because procedural 
disagreements between the EC and the government had caused a 
six month delay in the voter registration process.  The EC 
completed the registration \'mop up\' exercise, which gave 
registered voters more time to get their photos taken.  Few 
people showed up for the mop-up, perhaps because many of the 
extra names were duplicates, the EC reps said.  The register 
of 10.2 million names with photos will be published on 
October 12-17.  The EC can not accept candidate nominations 
until the register is completed but it has tentatively set 
October 20 and 21 as nomination filing dates, according to 
the EC officials. 
 
5.  (C)  Afari-Gyan is confident the police will act 
impartially on election day and that the parties will abide 
by a Code of Conduct not to deploy \"macho men\" (party thugs) 
to intimidate voters.  He conceded that some materials ran 
short during the registration process because the EC did not 
know how many people would respond in any given area and 
because internal controls on voting material made it 
difficult for EC officials to shift resources.  Election 
participation will be more predictable on voting day and the 
EC will deliver adequate materials to polling booths.  Unlike 
in 2000, this year the EC had budgeted for a possible run-off 
election.  The EC invited participation by foreign observers, 
although it was not actively seeking their involvement. 
 
Responding to Complaints 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C)  Polchief noted some concerns we have heard about the 
accessibility of the EC to complaints from parties. 
Afari-Gyan said the EC met with all the parties once a month 
in the Inter-Party Committee (IPAC) and that he had a steady 
flow of party officials in his office raising issues.  There 
was a formal complaint mechanism, and he met with the media 
when he saw the need, sometimes in seminars.  He said he 
could not possibly respond to every informal issue or 
complaint raised in radio talk shows and other media, nor can 
he respond to every complaint which parties raise, as some 
were frivolous. 
 
7.  (C)  PolChief noted opposition party complaints that the 
incumbent New Patriotic Party (NPP) is using the state media 
to get disproportionate coverage for its candidate, President 
John Kufuor.  Afari-Gyan said this was primarily an issue for 
the Ghana Media Commission, although the EC would take note 
if these concerns were serious.  At this point, he felt that 
parties were being given fair air time, although the media 
would stick to stories they deemed newsworthy.  It was 
 
 
inevitable the President would get more coverage as he moves 
around the country, and at least he was not wearing party 
colors at official functions, as happened in 2000. 
Afari-Gyan pointed out that under the constitution, the state 
media must give equal time to all candidates once the 
campaign has officially launched (after candidates have filed 
their nominations). 
 
EC Concerns 
----------- 
 
8.  (C)  When asked about his worst nightmare, Afari-Gyan 
said too many demands for changes to the voter registration 
list would further delay election preparations.  He grumbled 
that donors had not fulfilled promises to pay for 40 percent 
of the EC\'s election expenses.  He worried about being bogged 
down in minor legal squabbles (he had just returned from 
addressing a group of judges, educating them about the 
electoral process and urging them not to grant frivolous 
election-related injunctions.)  Afari-Gyan\'s biggest headache 
at the moment, however, was legalizing the election date. 
Under the constitution, the EC must submit the date as a 
Constitutional Instrument (CI) to Parliament, which has 21 
days to ratify it.  The EC submitted a CI to parliament on 
October 7.  While the CI is seen as a mere formality, the EC 
is under time pressure since the current session of 
Parliament will only last for about one month. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C)  Afari-Gyan was forceful and confident.  He saw no 
major problems in election preparations and offered credible 
responses to concerns about the registration process.  He was 
surprisingly indifferent to a role for foreign observers. 
Afari-Gyan\'s style is low profile.  If the EC has the 
election preparations under control -- as Chairman Afari-Gyan 
credibly conveyed to us -- it could do a better job of 
convincing civil society and the opposition, many of whom 
view the Commission as inaccessible, unresponsive, and 
inefficient.

SUBJECT: GHANA NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION SUBMITS 
FINAL REPORT 
 
1. (U) On October 12, the Ghana National Reconciliation 
Commission (NRC) submitted its final, five-volume report and 
recommendations to the GoG. The report follows 18 months of 
public hearings on alleged human rights abuses during the 
period of 1957-1993, which includes 20 years of rule by 
former President JJ Rawlings. Dr. Ken Attafuah, who was the 
NRC\'s  Chief Executive until he went on leave in June and who 
authored some chapters of the report, told PolOff on October 
12 that the GoG would review the report and then respond in a 
white paper. The GoG has given no date when the report will 
be released to the public. 
 
2. (U) Both domestic and international human rights 
organizations have lauded the report\'s completion and the 
work of the NRC. Both President John Kufuor and NRC Chairman, 
Mr. Justice K.E. Amua-Sekyi, reiterated the point that the 
work of the NRC was \"not supposed to be persecutory or 
prosecuting\", and that the recommendations focused squarely 
on reparations to the victims of human rights abuses. Mr. 
Amua-Sekyi stated that the report recommended reparations for 
3,000 (of a total 4,311) petitioners. President Kufuor noted 
that \"the government will not go after them (the 
perpetrators) to exact justice, but will leave them to their 
conscience and faith\", and that \"destiny has its own way of 
exacting justice.\" President Kufuor expressed appreciation to 
various institutions, including USAID, for its assistance to 
the work of the NRC. 
 
3. (SBU) The major opposition party, the National Democratic 
Congress (NDC), has publicly criticized the NRC\'s proceedings 
as incomplete and argued that the timing of the release (less 
than two months before elections) is politically motivated. 
The Chairman of the ruling National Patriotic Party (NPP) 
told the Charg that he would try to convince the GoG  to 
hold its response until after the elections. He thought that 
there was not enough time between now and the elections to 
give full consideration to the report and that an earlier 
release would unnecessarily make the NRC report a campaign 
issue.

SUBJECT: A VISIT TO GHANA\'S BUDUMBURAM REFUGEE CAMP 
 
REF:  Accra 1921 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Ref Coord\'s visit on October 6 to the Budumburam 
refugee camp near Accra revealed an atmosphere of utter calm that 
debunked some press claims that its residents were huddled in a 
state of fear under \"martial law.\"  Most Liberian residents, who by 
all appearances are adequately clothed and fed, remain skeptical of 
the United Nations High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR]-assisted 
repatriation program [reftel], preferring instead to resettle in the 
U.S. or even to obtain permanent residence status in Ghana.  The 
camp is regarded as one of the best administered in the region, 
although some problems remain with the availability of potable 
water, trash removal, education, and other areas.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
All Quiet in the Camp 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) In response to spectacular articles that appeared in both 
the Washington Times and local Ghanaian newspapers suggesting that 
martial law had been imposed at the Budumburam refugee camp, Ref 
Coord on October 6 visited the sprawling settlement located in 
Accra\'s western outskirts.  The reportedly \"imposing\" military 
presence consisted solely of a five-man checkpoint along the coastal 
highway near the entrance to the camp.  Once inside, an ambience of 
life-as-usual prevailed.  UNHCR Protection Officer Jane Muigai told 
Ref Coord that initially the checkpoint had caused some anxiety 
within the camp because of the refugees\' negative experiences in 
other countries with the military.  She confirmed that nothing 
resembling martial law had ever been imposed upon the camp. 
 
3.  (U)  Budumburam is different from many other refugee camps 
because of the urban origin of the majority of its inhabitants. 
About 70 percent of the 42,000 residents hail originally from 
Monrovia and its environs; consequently, they had higher levels of 
education and income prior to fleeing Liberia.  The camp 
administrator, a Ghanaian, told Ref Coord that Budumburam is 
popularly regarded as the most \"prestigious\" destination to which a 
refugee in West Africa can aspire. 
 
-------------------------- 
Conditions Reasonably Good 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Budumburam, evaluated in terms of the seven traditional 
criteria used to evaluate refugee camps, is doing relatively well. 
 
SHELTER:  There are some 5,000 small shelters at the camp with an 
average occupancy of eight family members.  Most dwellings have 
concrete floors and walls with tin roofs, although a few structures 
were built using wood.  While not meeting the internationally 
accepted Sphere standards, the structures do provide basic shelter 
from the rain and privacy.  Of the camp\'s twelve zones, three have 
spread beyond the camp\'s traditional boundaries set by the GOG in 
1990.  In two of these zones, refugees rent homes from their 
Ghanaian neighbors; in the third zone, refugees live rent-free with 
the understanding that the houses they have built will be ceded to 
the property owners when the refugees depart.  Rents in the 
Budumburam area are reportedly among the highest [per square meter] 
in the greater Accra area. 
 
HEALTH:  St. Gregory\'s Clinic continues to operate on-site; a new 
wing with three additional rooms was finished earlier this year. 
Medecins Sans Frontieres provides intermittent staffing, with an 
additional French doctor residing full-time in the camp.  The 
facility includes a lab that was added in 2002.  AIDS awareness 
programs and immunization campaigns supplement the overall health 
program in the camp.  Refugees pay twenty cents per consultation, a 
token fee that rises to one dollar if the appointment takes place 
after hours. 
 
Garbage collection and removal continues to be problematic, despite 
UNHCR\'s recent purchase of two garbage trucks.  A large amount of 
refuse strewn about the camp tainted an otherwise orderly picture of 
normalcy as defined in the West African context.  Moreover, there is 
only one toilet per 50 residents, versus the Sphere standard of one 
per 22.  Drainage in the low-lying camp is inadequate.  Potable 
water is only available by purchasing large, 5-gallon drums; 
however, despite hopes of closing the camp by the end of 2006, UNHCR 
has commissioned a feasibility study that could result in the 
drilling of four wells. 
 
NUTRITION:  Ref Coord did not witness any indications of significant 
malnutrition, e.g., grossly underweight children or distended 
bellies.  On the contrary, a sizeable minority of the refugees was 
overweight.  Earlier in 2004, the UN\'s World Food Program began a 
food distribution campaign targeting unaccompanied minors, the 
elderly, single mothers, the chronically ill, and the handicapped. 
Other refugees have the opportunity to grow small plots of 
vegetables. 
 
GBV:  The incidence of gender-based violence has reportedly 
decreased markedly over the past year, having fallen from four cases 
per month in 2003 to the current average of only one case per month. 
Unfortunately, domestic violence remains problematic. 
 
SECURITY:  Since the UNHCR re-assumed responsibility for Budumburam 
in 1992, following a two-year lapse, it has trained 350 volunteer 
neighborhood watchers.  In addition to a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, 
the camp has installed more lighting at night to enhance security, 
and there is a modest Ghanaian police presence.  Judging from the 
lack of complaints to Ref Coord or to UNHCR, these measures appear 
to have been effective in providing refugees with a secure 
environment.  Privately, some neighborhood watchers complained to us 
that UNHCR was not offering them any salary. 
 
EDUCATION:  There are a number of schools within the camp serving 
the 14,000 school-age children.  Still, about 20 percent of primary 
school-age children do not attend classes, with an even higher 
percentage of non-attendance among those of high school age.  [N.B. 
This compares favorably with Ghanaian school enrollment figures of 
only 58 percent at the primary school level.]  At least one NGO 
offers technical training in Budumburam in fields such as carpentry, 
while the German government offers 70 university scholarships each 
year.  Those with the means to do so may attend Ghanaian educational 
institutions outside the camp. 
 
INCOME GENERATION:  There are no official employment statistics, but 
Budumburam is a constant bustle of activity.  The GOG\'s refusal to 
grant them work permits has not prevented many refugees from working 
informally as brick makers, carpenters, shoe repairmen, farmers, 
fishermen, and general laborers, either at the camp or in Accra.  A 
large number run small retail shops.  Remittances are undergirding 
much of the refugee economy:  Western Union has an affiliate at 
Budumburam that receives USD 400,000 per month, with a similar 
amount going to Liberian refugees visiting the Accra branch, 
according to the Agricultural Bank\'s Country Director.  At one 
extreme, Ref Coord learned of one young man who simply pockets his 
cash from abroad every month and spends his time loitering at the 
camp\'s entertainment center, rather than studying or working.  That 
the GOG allows freedom of movement, rather than confining refugees 
behind barbed wire, is certainly a prime factor in accounting for 
the camp\'s vitality. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Repatriation, Resettlement, or Local Integration? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5.  (SBU)  A two-hour meeting with 30 Liberian refugees, including 
representatives of the refugee council and its internal security 
team, focused on the UNHCR-assisted repatriation program to Liberia. 
Most refugees are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward returning 
home, but several expressed a clear preference for resettlement 
elsewhere.  Some would opt for local integration, if given the 
opportunity; one refugee, for example, arrived in Budumburam in 1990 
at the age of nine.  He thus felt no particular attachment to 
Liberia and would prefer to remain permanently in Ghana. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  The first assisted repatriation on October 1 was limited 
to a small group that had friends and relatives in Monrovia who 
could offer them immediate shelter.  As the situation in Liberia\'s 
capital city improves, a modest outflow from Budumburam will likely 
continue, although some refugees seem determined to remain in Ghana 
as long as possible.  Over the medium term, we expect that 
traditional Ghanaian hospitality toward the refugee population will 
continue despite occasional grumbling.  GOG expenditures on behalf 
of the refugees are minimal, whereas the economic impact of the 
remittances -- together with the salaries and rents paid on behalf 
of the burgeoning local and expatriate staff involved in refugee 
assistance -- is considerable. 
 
7.  (SBU)  The Ghanaian welcome mat is, however, not sustainable 
over a longer period of time.  Veronica Ankomah-Tutuh, a member of 
the Ghana Refugee Board and head of an NGO that offers assistance to 
refugees, told Ref Coord privately that about two-thirds of 
Ghanaians oppose the continued presence of refugees, who many 
perceive - fourteen years after their first arrival in Ghana -- as 
having worn out their welcome.  Thus, it is little wonder that UNHCR 
is making plans to repatriate or resettle all Liberian refugees by 
the end of 2006, in the hopes of reducing the total refugee 
population in Ghana from 48,000 to 6,000.  Despite the desire of 
some Liberian refugees to settle in Ghana, legislation to grant 
refugees permanent residence is not in the cards and would not play 
well with the Ghanaian electorate during this election year.

SUBJECT: GHANA\'S ELECTION:  NPP CONFIDENT OF VICTORY 
 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF SCOTT TICKNOR FOR REASONS 1.5 D AND E. 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  Charge met on October 13 with the Chairman 
of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) and several senior 
NPP officials to discuss upcoming elections.  The Chairman 
was confident the NPP would win the election, largely because 
of the government\'s economic performance.  He was pleased 
with the Electoral Commission\'s work to date and predicted a 
peaceful, generally fair election (although he saw the 
potential for some minor election-related fraud).  He was 
cynical about election observers (saying they could easily be 
deceived) and hoped the USG would provide direct funding to 
parties for capacity development.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  On October 13, Charge hosted a lunch for Haruna 
Esseku, Chairman of the NPP, Dan Botwe, General Secretary of 
the NPP, and two other NPP officials, to discuss the December 
7 parliamentary and presidential elections.  Charge explained 
that we were hosting similar events for all of Ghana\'s 
political parties, as well as the Electoral Commission and 
members of civil society. 
 
Background on the NPP 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  The ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) is heir to the 
pre-independence federalist and conservative National 
Liberation Movement (NLM), the post-independence United Party 
(an umbrella grouping of conservative parties) and former 
President (1969-72) Kofi Busia\'s Progress Party.  Dominated 
by timber merchants, lawyers and chiefs in Ashanti and Akyem 
Abuakwa, these parties were essentially organized to oppose 
Kwame Nkrumah and his socialist vision for Ghana.  The NPP 
has ruled Ghana since winning 57 percent of the popular vote 
in a run-off presidential election in 2000.  The NPP has 103 
seats in parliament (out of 200 total).  The party is 
pro-market and pro-Western, with its stronghold in Ashanti 
and Eastern regions. 
 
NPP Confident 
------------- 
 
4.  (C)  NPP Chairman Esseku was confident the NPP would win 
with a comfortable majority in the upcoming elections.  He 
predicted the opposition National Democratic Congress Party 
(NDC) would drop from its current 89 parliamentary seats (out 
of 200) to no more than 50 seats (out of an expanded 230 
total seats).  While Esseku acknowledged that many factors 
can influence voters, he thought the NPP\'s strength was its 
economic performance.  The NDC is focused on attacking the 
government\'s development record, he said.  This message would 
get little traction, he thought, while conceding that the NDC 
will benefit from its extensive party organization, built up 
through its twenty years in power.  However, voters associate 
the NDC with a legacy of fear, Esseku contended.  Unlike 
before the 2000 election, there is now no atmosphere of 
anxiety and fear.  Ghanaians appreciate President Kufuor as a 
caring consensus builder. 
 
Election Issues? 
---------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Esseku was pleased with the performance of the 
Electoral Commission and the ongoing display of the 
provisional voter registration list.  The government would 
\"nip in the bud\" any election-related violence, taking extra 
security precautions in the volatile northern region.  The 
potential for election fraud would be minimized, although 
there was always the potential for some \"die hard criminals\" 
to try to manipulate some balloting.  Botwe noted that the 
fact that some people have been imprisoned for double 
registration indicates that there have already been some 
attempts at election fraud. 
 
6.  (C)  Esseku rejected opposition criticism of the NPP.  He 
debunked some claims that the NPP has been deploying its own 
party police force.  In response to criticism that the NPP 
has gained undue advantage from incumbency, he said any such 
issues with the NPP pale in comparison with the NDC\'s abuse 
of incumbency in the 2000 election campaign.  President 
Kufuor was refraining from using party colors during 
government functions.  The NDC had been unable to 
substantiate its broad allegations of government corruption. 
 
USG Support for Parties 
----------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Esseku and Botwe hoped the USG could facilitate 
nonpartisan capacity building for political parities, 
preferably channeled directly to the parties or through the 
Electoral Commission (not through NGOs), as the Netherlands 
government is doing.  Charge explained that the USG and U.S. 
organizations generally offer support related to the overall 
democratic process, not to specific parties or party 
development. 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C)  While Esseku\'s confident predictions are 
unsurprising, NPP contacts are privately more cautious.  A 
GOG intelligence service survey done in June 2004 reportedly 
predicts that the NPP will poll around 50 percent of the 
popular vote in the presidential race, 14 percentage points 
less than the party\'s internal target.  Esseku admitted to 
poloff privately after the lunch that he is spending a great 
deal of time patching up divisions within the party over some 
parliamentary candidates.  We were somewhat surprised by 
Esseku and Botwe\'s cynicism about election observers.  It 
reflects in part a latent suspicion of NGOs.  Some in the NPP 
also believe foreign election observers in the 1992 and 1996 
elections were too quick to pronounce on the integrity of 
elections which the NPP viewed as flawed.  Despite this 
cynicism, we do not expect the NPP or GOG to put any 
obstacles in the way of observers.

2. (C) Parliament convened October 5 for a shortened session 
prior to the December 7 Presidential and Parliamentary 
elections.  The agenda for this session is jam packed with 
important laws and agreements, many related to the economy. 
Of the close to 20 pending bills, the GoG\'s top priorities 
are the Long-Term Savings Plan and Venture Capital Trust Fund 
Bills.  President Kufuor has hailed these during his campaign 
as proof of the GoG\'s commitment to private sector 
development. 
 
Legislation/Agreements Affecting U.S. Interests

Adjaho, Finance Committee Chair Atta Agyepong, Trade and 
Industry Committee Chair Asante-Frempong, Roads and Transport 
Committee Chair Sarfoh, and Finance Committee minority leader 
Moses Asaga. 
 
4. (C) Four economic bills and agreements that require 
Parliamentary action are of major U.S. interest:  the OPIC 
agreement, the Valco agreement, and the WAGP and civil 
aviation bills.  In all four cases, there could be negative 
repercussions if Parliament does not approve them this 
session.  Paul Asimenu, head of the Finance Ministry\'s Legal 
Department, assured Econoffs September 30 that they were all 
GoG priorities.  Finance is coordinating with the Attorney 
General\'s office to push them through this session.

5. (C) The GoG and OPIC signed the agreement in 1999, but the 
GoG never ratified it.  Finance responded to Embassy pressure 
and submitted it to Parliament in July 2004, but Parliament 
recessed without acting on it.  Econoffs have emphasized that 
the agreement will allow OPIC to operate in Ghana\'s private 
sector without GoG approval of every project, which often 
delays projects by months.  At stake now is OPIC\'s USD 75 
million insurance for WAGP.  The Finance and Trade and 
Industry Committee Chairs conducted a joint committee hearing 
to speed up review.  Post understands the agreement and 
Committee report were laid before the broader House on 
October 15, will be debated October 19, and should pass by 
October 26. 
 
Civil Aviation Bill 
------------------- 
6. (C) Econoffs emphasized that this law is critical for 
Ghana to stand any chance of retaining Category I status 
during the upcoming FAA civair safety reassessment, 
tentatively set for November.  The GoG realizes the 
importance of this bill and has pushed Parliament to act on 
it.  Roads and Transport Chair Sarfoh told Econoffs on 
October 8 that the Committee met out of session to review the 
draft bill and prepare its report.  The bill and Committee 
report were presented to the House October 15, will be 
debated October 19, and should pass by October 26. 
 
West Africa Gas Pipeline Enabling Legislation 
--------------------------------------------- 
7. (C) The WAGP law is a precondition for Final Investment 
Decision, set for late November.  While a GoG priority, it is 
unclear from Post\'s meetings that Parliamentary leaders 
realize how important it is to pass the bill during this 
session. 
 
Valco Purchase Agreement 
------------------------ 
8. (C) Following sustained pressure from Kaiser and Emboffs, 
the GoG presented the agreement to Parliament on October 12. 
The agreement sets the terms for the GoG\'s purchase of Valco 
for USD 18 million.  Finance Committee contacts assured post 
that it will go before the House October 19 and hope for 
approval around October 26.  (Note:  According to Moses 
Asaga, the opposition NDC will use the vote to embarrass the 
NPP; however, Owusu-Agyapong assured EconChief that this is a 
priority, and he is determined to push it through.  End Note) 
 
Trafficking in Persons Legislation 
---------------------------------- 
9. (C) During the October 5 meeting with Minister of 
Parliament Owusu-Agyapong, PolChief raised TIP legislation, 
which has been pending for almost three years.  PolChief 
acknowledged that the draft law is still with government, but 
that it was important for Parliamentary leaders to understand 
the importance of passing a new law as soon as possible. 
Owusu-Agyapong said he would look into the status of the 
legislation, but was not optimistic it could make progress in 
this Parliamentary session. 
 
Minister of Parliament\'s Doubts about Session 
--------------------------------------------- 
10. (C) Minister of Parliament Owusu-Agyapong told PolChief 
and EconChief that he has had trouble ensuring adequate 
representation at the session.  Enough Members of Parliament 
(MPs) have shown to form a quorum, but they are campaigning 
and see the session as an inconvenience.  Owusu-Agyapong has 
had to promise to limit the session to 21 days (ending 
November 2) and allow early afternoon departures.  MPs who 
lost their primary races -- including 13 Committee Chairs 
from the ruling party NPP -- have even less incentive to show 
up.  MPs are also agitating about poor salaries and work 
conditions, further distracting them from the agenda.  The 
result is that the NPP has an uphill fight to make this 
session productive. 
 
Comment 
------- 
11. (C) The GoG has a slight majority in Parliament, so it 
has the power to pass whatever laws and agreements it 
considers a priority.  However, this is an unusual session, 
and it remains to be seen whether the GoG will be able to 
push through even its top priorities.  Post\'s efforts at 
least raised the profile of the items of most importance to 
the bilateral relationship.  End Comment

SUBJECT: GHANA\'S RECORD LEVEL COCOA EXPORTS IN 2004 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) The Government of Ghana (GoG) purchased an all-time 
high of close to 710,000 metric tons of cocoa for the 
2003/2004 season, a 40 plus percent increase over the 
2002/2003 season that should bring in nearly USD 1 billion 
revenue for 2004.  The massive increase reflects higher cocoa 
yields and the movement of cocoa across the border from Cote 
D\'Ivoire.  U.S. importers purchased lower amounts of Ghana\'s 
cocoa, contributing to a widening U.S. trade surplus with 
Ghana.  The record level cocoa revenues will boost 2004 
economic growth, but also exacerbate Ghana\'s vulnerability to 
terms of trade shocks.  End Summary 
 
Phenomenal Increase in 2003/2004 
-------------------------------- 
2. (U) The GoG purchased 707,884 metric tons of cocoa between 
October 2003 and August 2004, exceeding last season\'s total 
by 42 percent.  The total 2003/2004 amount may exceed 720,000 
by September, the formal end of the season.  This crop is the 
largest in the history of the country, surpassing the 591,031 
metric-ton record of 1964/1965 and cementing Ghana\'s position 
as the world\'s second largest exporter of cocoa.  The 
2003/2004 increase extends a trend from the 2002/2003 season, 
which produced 496,846 metric tons.  Cocoa revenues are also 
steadily increasing along with the larger crops.  Initial GoG 
projections for cocoa export proceeds for 2004 were roughly 
USD 930 million, but recent estimates put it closer to USD 1 
billion.  This compares to the USD 818 million revenues in 
2003 and USD 463 million in 2002. 
 
Government Support 
------------------ 
3. (SBU) GoG support for farmers and favorable climatic 
conditions are the main factors contributing to improved 
cocoa yields.  During 2003 and 2004, GoG support included the 
free spraying of cocoa farms for pest and disease control, 
free supply of improved seedlings, and road rehabilitation in 
cocoa growing areas.  In 2004 the GoG spent about USD 93 
million on its improvement program.  Ghanaian farmers have 
also increased the use of fertilizers.  Also, cocoa farming 
is largely rain-fed and favorable rainfall over the last five 
years improved yields significantly.  However, the driving 
force behind increased production is the higher price the GoG 
pays to farmers, known as the farm gate price.  The GoG has 
raised the farm gate price from 3,475,000 cedis per metric 
ton in 2000/2001 to 9,000,000 cedis per metric ton (roughly 
USD 1,000, or about 69 percent of f.o.b. price) in 2003/2004. 
 
 
Cote D\'Ivoire Cocoa Crossing the Border 
--------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Cote D\'Ivoire\'s relatively low farm gate price and 
its political difficulties encouraged the movement of cocoa 
into Ghana.  Some market analysts estimate that 120,000 to 
170,000 metric tons of Ghana\'s 2003/2004 sales originate in 
Cote D\'Ivoire.  Cote D\'Ivoire\'s relatively liberal cocoa 
market allows the farm gate price to fluctuate with the world 
price, whereas the GoG fixes prices in Ghana.  Since 2003, 
the farm gate price of cocoa beans in Cote D\'Ivoire has 
remained at around 350,000 CFA per metric ton as compared to 
the 550,000 CFA equivalent available in Ghana.  The 
relatively stable Ghanaian currency also helped keep the 
Ghanaian price high.  Lower prices in Cote D\'Ivoire reflect 
the relatively low world price, compared to 2003, and are 
also partially the result of high transportation costs in 
Cote D\'Ivoire\'s rebel-controlled areas. 
 
5. (SBU) Traditionally, cocoa is smuggled by individuals 
between Ghana and Cote D\'Ivoire to take advantage of price 
differences between the two countries.  However, the current 
situation is different.  According to sources in Customs and 
companies such as Nestle and Kilian, Ghanaian buyers are 
purchasing Ivorian cocoa on the open market in large 
quantities and trucking it into Ghana with the tacit approval 
of Ghanaian authorities.  Local market observers are 
reluctant to call this \"smuggling,\" since the transactions 
are taking place above board. 
 
6. (SBU) The acting head of research at the Ghana Cocoa Board 
(COCOBOD) said his unit does not capture information on cocoa 
imports from Cote D\'Ivoire, since the GoG forbids the 
importation of cocoa beans.  The GoG therefore records all 
cocoa beans that it purchases in Ghana as Ghanaian.  Although 
he acknowledged that some cocoa is entering from Cote 
D\'Ivoire to take advantage of Ghana\'s current price 
advantage, he thinks the figures quoted in the local press 
are too high.  He declined, however, to estimate the amount 
crossing the border. 
 
7. (SBU) Market analysts at the Ghana offices of Nestle and 
Kilian tell Post they suspect that official data on cocoa 
crops from the Ghana/Cote D\'Ivoire border region have been 
altered to conceal origin.  They also suspect that the buying 
period was extended by 2 months from April to June 2004 to 
accommodate the movement of beans from Cote D\'Ivoire.  (Note: 
 there are generally two buying periods in a season.  The 
largest crop comes in between October and April, and a 
second, smaller crop comes in around August and September. 
End Note) 
 
8. (SBU) Possibly the best indication of wide-scale 
cross-border movement of cocoa is that the premium Ghanaian 
cocoa traditionally commands on world markets has fallen from 
USD 80 to USD 20 per metric ton.  Local market analysts say 
this is mainly a result of mixing high-quality Ghanaian beans 
with lower-quality Ivorian beans, thus eroding the quality of 
the overall crop. 
 
Cocoa - Major Contributor to Lower Exports to U.S. 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
9. (SBU) Ghana\'s exports to the U.S. in 2003 were USD 82 
million, the lowest in more than a decade, and down from USD 
116 million in 2002 and USD 187 million in 2001.  (Note:  the 
U.S. exported USD 210 million to Ghana in 2003.  End Note) 
Lower cocoa and aluminum exports were the main contributors 
to the decline.  The closure of Kaiser\'s Valco smelter 
reduced aluminum exports from USD 14.6 million in 2002 to USD 
0.9 million in 2003.  Cocoa exports to the U.S. fell from 
almost USD 25 million in 2002 to USD 7.3 million in 2003. 
Despite Ghana\'s increasing cocoa production, less of it is 
going to the U.S. market because of competition from Asian 
sources.  Kilian\'s CEO argues that the decline reflects U.S. 
buyers\' strong preference for cheaper product from Indonesia. 
 
GoG Secures USD 850 Million Loan to Purchase Cocoa 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
10. (U) COCOBOD signed an agreement with a group of 32 
offshore and four local banks for a loan of USD 850 million 
to purchase cocoa from farmers in the 2004/2005 season. 
Ghana has borrowed from offshore banks to finance the 
purchase of beans from farmers since 1994.  In the 2003/2004 
season, COCOBOD borrowed USD 650 million for purchases.  The 
increase anticipates significantly higher volume in the 
coming season. 
 
Comment 
------- 
11. (SBU) The current stability of Ghana\'s economy hinges on 
the unprecedented cocoa harvest and the relatively stable 
world cocoa price.  Foreign exchange earnings from cocoa 
increased gross reserves to 1.4 billion, or 4 months of 
imports.  Ghana\'s 5.2 percent real GDP growth rate in 2003 
was achieved in large part because of the 16.4 growth in the 
cocoa sector during the 2002/2003 season.  The even larger 
increase for the 2003/2004 season provides strong support to 
the GoG\'s goal for 2004 of a second consecutive year of plus 
five percent growth, even taking into account large imports 
from Cote D\'Ivoire.  Nevertheless, greater reliance on the 
cocoa crop leaves Ghana even more exposed to external shocks 
due to falling commodity prices.  End Comment.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. On October 27, six men who were convicted in a 
high-profile drug trafficking case in Ghana were sentenced to 
twenty years each in prison. Among the six is Kevin Gorman, a 
UK-US dual national, whom the judge described as \"the wheel 
around which all activities revolved.\" Sentencing came after 
months of court battles, which ultimately ended at the High 
Court. The Executive Secretary of the Ghana Narcotics Control 
Board, the agency chiefly responsible for making the arrest, 
was satisfied with the outcome. End summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
SIX MONTHS OF COURT BATTLES REACHES A CLIMAX 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. On January 7, 2004, the Ghana Narcotics Control Board 
(NCB) and the Ghana Police Service Drug Enforcement Unit 
(DEU) intercepted 588.33 kilograms of cocaine in Ghana\'s 
largest ever drug bust (see reftel A). The raid was possible 
due to the aid of INL surveillance equipment donated in 2003, 
as well as UK intelligence. 
 
3. A lower court initially granted the suspects bail, which 
caused public outcry. Press reports at the time claimed that 
the suspects were being treated favorably because five of 
them were foreign nationals. The suspects were then remanded 
to a medium security prison when the case was sent to the 
High Court for deliberation. All six suspects pleaded not 
guilty to a range of charges, which included engaging in 
criminal conspiracy to commit a drug-related offense, 
possession of illegal narcotics, importing narcotic drugs 
without license from the Ministry of Health, and using 
property for keeping narcotic drugs. 
 
4. On October 27, the presiding judge, Justice F. 
Kusi-Appiah, delivered the sentence in a 50-page verdict 
which took two and a quarter hours to read. Each of the six 
suspects were sentenced to 20 years on each count to run 
concurrently (Note: the minimum sentence for the charges is 
10 years each). The court also ordered that currencies seized 
from the accused persons - US$18,841, 1,150 British pounds, 
9,485 euros, 442 Venezuelan dollars, 40 Thai baht, 10 Swiss 
francs, and 4.2 million Ghanaian cedis - be deposited into a 
government account. 
 
5. Kevin Gorman, named as the operation\'s ringleader, is a UK 
national who also possesses an American passport. The British 
High Commission told the Consular section on October 29th 
that they believe he was previously married to an American 
citizen. Mr. Gorman has not requested American consular 
services throughout the case\'s proceedings and has instead 
received, and continues to receive, services from the British 
HC in Accra. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. This case was the lead story in Ghanaian newspapers on 
October 28. That this high-profile case involving five 
foreign nationals resulted in such a stiff penalty is widely 
regarded here as a success for both counter-narcotics 
authorities and the judiciary in Ghana. The Executive 
Secretary of the Narcotics Control Board, Colonel Isaac 
 
SIPDIS 
Akuoko, told PolOff that he is \"very satisfied and happy\" 
with the outcome of this trial. The court\'s decision will 
hopefully strengthen existing efforts by counter-narcotic 
agencies here in Ghana, as well as discourage attempts by 
illegal smugglers to open up new routes through West Africa. 
It further reinforces the need for continued USG assistance 
in fighting the flow of illegal drugs into and through the 
region. Meanwhile, the counter-narcotics effort continues as 
a 4-week, INL-funded, interagency training aimed at stopping 
the smuggling of drugs through Ghana\'s seaports and airports 
was launched on October 18th. This training also garnered 
prolific local press coverage. End comment.

1.  (SBU) Amcit Rasheed Nouri, country director for GhanAmer 
Farms (reftel), which is the majority owner of the Ghana 
Cotton Company (GCC), is safe after being thrown out of the 
company office by disgruntled employees.  According to Mr. 
Nouri, eleven employees of the Ghana Cotton Company 
accompanied by a union representative entered his office in 
Accra on the afternoon of October 27.  The group read a 
letter detailing employee complaints, told Mr. Nouri he had 
until noon the following day to leave the country and then 
threw Mr. Nouri out of the office and surrounding compound. 
Mr. Nouri contacted USG officials in Washington who in turn 
contacted Post\'s RSO.  RSO made contact with Mr.Nouri in the 
evening of the 27th and determined that he was not a hostage 
nor in immediate physical danger, provided emergency contact 
information and relayed this to Washington. 
 
2. (SBU) EconOff spoke with Mr. Nouri on the morning of 
October 28.  Mr. Nouri stated that, contrary to initial 
reports, he had not been a hostage at any time.  DCM later 
called President Kufuor\'s Chief of Staff Kwadwo Mpiani and 
expressed Post\'s concern for Mr. Nouri\'s safety and hope that 
the dispute between GhanAmer Farms, GCC employees and GCC\'s 
former owner and primary debt holder, the parastatel 
Agriculture Development Bank (ADB), could be resolved in a 
peaceful and businesslike manner.  The Chief of Staff 
promised to speak directly with ADB\'s board of directors that 
day. 
 
3. (SBU) EconOffs also met with ADB CEO and board members to 
express Post\'s concern.  Subsequent follow-up with Mr. Nouri 
on the evening of October 28 confirmed that the workers had 
left and that the ADB board had met with him after hours in 
order to revive the dialogue between the parties.  EconOffs 
will remain in close contact with Mr. Nouri, ADB officials 
and the Chief of Staff\'s office to monitor negotiations.

1.  Summary:  On October 20-21, DCM led an Embassy 
delegation to Takoradi, capital of Ghana\'s Western region, 
to reach out to business and Western military command 
contacts and public diplomacy audiences outside of Accra. 
(We recently did a similar road show in Kumasi, Ashanti 
region).  Emboffs made a public presentation to an audience 
of about 80 people, fielded four radio interviews, visited a 
USAID project, met with Amcits and a wide range of 
political, military, and economic/commercial contacts, and 
DCM hosted a reception for local dignitaries.  The visit 
received extensive media coverage and helped generate good 
will in a key region of the country. The Embassy team 
included DCM, PAO, DATT, Army and Airforce Attaches, USAID 
Project Development Officer (PDO), Political Chief, Peace 
Corps Director, Senior FCS Officer, an economic officer, and 
a consular officer. End summary. 
 
Western Region 
-------------- 
 
2.  The resource rich Western region has roughly ten percent 
of Ghana\'s population (two million people), 44 percent of 
its timber, 40-60 percent of its cocoa production, 
significant plantation crop cultivation, and major deposits 
(and mining) of gold, diamonds, and manganese.  Capital city 
Takoradi has Ghana\'s second-largest sea port and is home to 
a sizeable navy, army and air force presence.  In the 2000 
election, Western region was split evenly between the ruling 
New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Paty 
(NDC), with 9 parliamentary seats each (and one seat to the 
Convention People\'s Party, CPP). 
 
Public Outreach 
--------------- 
 
3.  The entire Mission team met on October 20 with an 
audience of 80 journalists, businessmen, students, and the 
public to explain the function of different Mission 
sections.  Our consular officer explained new visa 
application procedures which should save Ghanaians months of 
time waiting for appointments.  We fielded questions for an 
hour, focused primarily on visa issues and 
commercial/business concerns.  USAID, Peace Corps and Public 
Affairs responded to requests for support for libraries, 
community centers, health programs and other activities. 
 
4.  The PAO and Consular officer gave interviews at four 
radio stations, explaining the purpose of the Mission\'s 
travel to Takoradi and the role of each Mission section and 
agency represented.  Questions focused on U.S. foreign 
policy, the upcoming American elections and, most of all, 
visa policy.  PAO and Consular officer also met with 
students and staff at the dynamic Takoradi Polytechnic, a 
tertiary institution that trains about 4,000 students in 
basic engineering and vocational skills.   DCM and consular 
officer met with a small group of AMCITs, and DCM, USAID PDO 
and Peace Corps Director lunched with four Peace Corps 
Volunteers based in Western Region.  The DCM hosted a 
reception that evening for about 100 prominent members of 
the community, including the Regional Minister, military, 
business, NGO and media contacts. 
 
Economic/Commercial Meetings 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  In meetings with local business contacts, Senior FCS 
Officer found significant interest in purchasing U.S. 
information and communications technology, textiles, 
seafood, and automotive parts. 
 
6.  DCM, Econoff, and FCS Officer visited the U.S. joint 
venture power generating company CMS Energy/Takoradi 
International Company (TICO).  TICO\'s General Manager 
discussed how natural gas from the much-anticipated West 
Africa Pipeline project - once completed - would increase 
its productivity and reduce costs.  FCS and Econoffs also 
toured the Sekondi-Takoradi port, where they were briefed on 
planned port reclamation and expansion. 
 
7.  DCM and USAID rep visited Norpalm Ghana Limited, a palm 
oil processing plant.  Norpalm received USAID assistance as 
part of the Food for Peace program, through USAID\'s local 
partner, TechnoServe, resulting in improved plantation and 
management information systems, and enhanced factory and 
agricultural operations. 
 
Political Meetings 
------------------ 
 
8.  DCM and other Emboffs paid a courtesy call on Joseph 
Aidoo, Regional Minister for Western Region.  Aidoo 
acknowledged strong US-Ghana relations, especially US 
military cooperation, and noted he had a Peace Corps 
Volunteer teacher when he was in school.  He sought USG 
assistance in constructing infrastructure (especially roads 
and bridges) and in encouraging U.S. companies to pursue oil 
exploration in the Western region.  He hoped we would help 
inform the Ghanaian public about visas and noted the 
region\'s promise for tourism development. 
 
9.   Pol Chief met separately with senior contacts in the 
police, Electoral Commission, and human rights community. 
 
10.  DCM and DATT visited the Second Infantry Battalion, 
Western Naval Command, and the Takoradi Airforce base.  They 
also visited Western Region military command for a briefing, 
toured the base and visited buoy tendor ships donated by USG 
(Septel to follow by DAO). 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  The visit strengthened our ties across-the-board in a 
resource-rich, politically important region of Ghana, and 
informing a sizeable section of the Ghanaian public about 
what we do and the services (commercial, consular, and 
other) we offer.  The trip was covered on national 
television and by a number of newspapers.   We plan to do 
similar \"road show\" outreach throughout Ghana in the coming 
year.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Legislation prohibiting human trafficking in Ghana 
has been waiting in the wings for almost three years. In 
post\'s continued efforts to encourage passage of this 
legislation, we do not feel the delay reflects a lack of 
political will to fight human trafficking. Rather, it 
reflects bureaucratic and political frictions between the 
Ministries of Women\'s and Children\'s Affairs (MOWAC) and 
Manpower, Development, and Employment (MMDE). Engagement at 
higher levels within the GoG is important to encourage the 
legislation to move along. Post believes it would be useful 
for the Department to demarche Ambassador Poku in Washington 
on this issue (suggested talking points in para 6). Post also 
proposes to host an anti-trafficking conference in early 2005 
(after Ghana\'s presidential and parliamentary elections in 
December), if funding is available. End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION: WHERE IT STANDS NOW 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (SBU) After two years of working to draft legislation that 
would criminalize human trafficking, Ghana\'s National Task 
Force has put forth a final draft of the bill to the two lead 
ministries - the Ministry of Women\'s and Children\'s Affairs 
(MOWAC) and the Ministry of Manpower, Development, and 
Employment (MMDE) - for their comments. To date, neither 
ministry has returned the bill with their comments (Note: 
This is not expected to happen until after the December 
elections, as many within the GoG, including the Minister for 
Women\'s and Children\'s Affairs, are on the campaign trail). 
 
3. (SBU) There is widespread acknowledgement among those who 
work on the National Task Force (which includes both NGO and 
GoG representatives) that the delay is mainly due to MOWAC, 
which has so far refused to turn over the mandate for this 
legislation to MMDE, a move that was recommended at the last 
stakeholders\' meeting concerning this legislation. In early 
drafts of the legislation, MOWAC was given the mandate for 
this legislation, but stakeholders believe that MMDE would 
see greater prospects for implementation and enforcement of 
the legislation. MOWAC anticipates that the passage of this 
legislation is likely to come with material resources 
attached to it. As a small, underresourced ministry competing 
with other underresourced ministries, MOWAC views this as a 
chance to raise its profile and capacity. 
 
4. (SBU) Unfortunately, while both ministries have thrown 
their public support behind anti-trafficking efforts, the 
lack of agreement over which ministry should have the mandate 
to implement the bill (if passed) has delayed movement on the 
legislative front. 
 
------------------- 
WHAT THE USG CAN DO 
------------------- 
 
6. (U) As the elections draw closer and increasingly dominate 
the GoG\'s agenda here in Ghana, Post believes that engaging 
the GoG from Washington would be helpful and requests the 
Department demarche Ambassador Poku, using the following 
talking points: 
 
(Begin Talking Points) 
 
- We are very concerned about the status of human trafficking 
in Ghana and wish to reiterate our position on the issue of 
trafficking-in-persons. 
 
- As you know, Ghana is one of only two African countries to 
earn Tier 1 status in this year\'s Trafficking-in-Persons 
Report, and is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa on Tier 
1 in 2004. 
 
- A major reason for Ghana\'s Tier 1 status is its ongoing 
effort to draft and pass legislation that would specifically 
criminalize human trafficking. 
 
- We understand that a final draft of anti-trafficking 
legislation has been submitted to the two lead ministries, 
the Ministry for Women\'s and Children\'s Affairs and the 
Ministry for Manpower, Development, and Employment. 
 
- We also understand that the draft bill will not move 
forward until these two ministries can agree on which agency 
should have the mandate to enforce the law should it be 
passed by Parliament. 
 
- Given that Ghana\'s Tier 1 status depends heavily on the 
passage of this pending legislation in early 2005, we urge 
you to work with your colleagues in these two ministries to 
come to an expeditious agreement on any remaining issues 
blocking the bill from moving forward for Cabinet\'s review. 
 
(End Talking Points) 
 
7. (U) It remains to be seen whether the key, senior 
interlocutors on this issue - the Ministers of MOWAC and MMDE 
- will be the same people after December\'s elections. Soon 
after the new government convenes, Embassy officials will 
meet with the two Ministers, the Attorney General, the 
Speaker of Parliament, and other senior GoG officials and 
parliamentarians to urge immediate movement on this issue in 
the new session of Parliament in January. 
 
8. (U) Post also proposes hosting a local conference on 
trafficking in early 2005 that would draw together key 
stakeholders on this issue in Ghana. Such an event would 
raise awareness of this issue and help educate 
parliamentarians who currently do not understand TIP issues. 
This would provide an opportunity to bring together key 
interlocutors of the USG and GoG (either personally or via 
digital video conference) to discuss Ghana\'s anti-trafficking 
efforts. Such a conference would be dependent on funding. 
 
9. (U) Once the anti-trafficking legislation reaches 
Parliament, USAID/Ghana Democracy and Governance partners 
will work to raise awareness among Parliamentarians and civil 
society at large to the critical issues addressed in the 
legislation. This would include stakeholder meetings to 
review the legislation\'s intent and implications, and provide 
recommendations to the relevant committee to strengthen the 
legislation and facilitate its passage. This would also 
include disseminating issue papers and other research to 
Parliamentarians and the media to build understanding of the 
significance of the legislation and the critical role it will 
play in addressing existing trafficking problems in Ghana. 
 
------------------------ 
MEANWHILE, SOME PROGRESS 
------------------------ 
 
10. (U) As the mechanics of a law to specifically criminalize 
trafficking in Ghana continue to be worked out, law 
enforcement officials are using existing laws to prosecute 
trafficking and related activities. According to local press 
reports, in early October, a 62 year-old Dutch national was 
apprehended by police on pornography charges involving young 
Ghanaian women. This prosecution was made using exisiting 
immigration laws, with the allegation that the man had 
entered the country multiple times with unlawful intent. The 
suspect appeared in court on October 18, and was remanded 
until November 1 for further investigation to continue. 
 
11. (U) On August 29, Vice President Aliu Mahama opened a 
conference to discuss the trans-Atlantic slave trade and 
referred to the \"new forms of slavery\" that must be 
addressed. He said the conference should not only examine 
historical forms of slavery in West Africa but also serve as 
a point of discussion about the trafficking of women and 
children to engage in forced and degrading labor in other 
countries. Mahama stated that Ghana would take a lead role in 
repatriating Africans in the diaspora who were victims of 
slavery, through the African Union, NEPAD, and ECOWAS. 
 
12. (U) Ongoing projects coordinated by various NGOs - 
including the International Organization for Migration, the 
African Center for Human Development, and the International 
Labor Organization - continue to enjoy GoG support and 
relative success in sensitizing communities to the problem of 
child trafficking and in reintegrating some trafficked 
children to their home communities. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (SBU) GoG and civil society interlocutors concur on the 
need to combat trafficking in Ghana. The main challenge is 
breaking the deadlock in the inter-Ministry dispute over 
ownership of the bill. Engagement with the GoG at senior 
levels after the December elections should provide an 
opportunity to make the USG\'s position even clearer with 
respect to Ghana\'s Tier 1 status in 2005. Meanwhile, ongoing 
USG support has been effectively utilized by NGOs in the 
absence of a law to assist in enforcement and it appears that 
Ghanaian officials continue to use existing laws to make 
prosecutions on trafficking-related crimes. Post looks 
forward to exploring with the Department possible funding for 
a TIP conference in January or February 2005 in Accra. End 
comment.

1. Summary.  Post sponsored a workshop on grassroots 
democracy for 35 community leaders in the economically 
deprived area of northern Ghana from October 19-21, 2004. 
Representatives from government, non-governmental 
organizations, and the media met to discuss ways to create a 
grassroots constituency, approaches to use in persuading 
legislators to take up their cause and methods of using the 
media to their advantage.  The workshop was enhanced by a 
\"field trip\" to a political rally for Ghanaian President 
John Kufuor, who was in the area campaigning for re- 
election, and it afforded the group an opportunity to 
witness firsthand the ways in which a practiced politician 
can work a recalcitrant crowd.  End Summary. 
 
2. From October 19-21, 2004, post sponsored a workshop in 
Wa, Upper West Region, for 35 community leaders from the 
three, predominantly-Muslim Upper West, Northern and Upper 
East Regions (or districts) of Ghana.  Participants included 
members of the Wa municipal assembly, Tumu town council, non- 
governmental groups that benefit women and orphans, two 
candidates for National Parliament, and three journalists, 
two from the government-run Ghana Broadcasting Corporation 
and one from a local private FM radio station (Radio 
Progress).  Two former IVLP participants, Catherine Amy Bob- 
Milliar, of the Upper West Rural Women\'s Association (2002) 
and Godfrey Bayon, Wa Municipal Chief Executive (2003), 
organized the workshop.  Post used speaker funds to bring to 
Ghana Dr. Kevin Gottlieb, a former high-ranking aide to four 
US Senators and President of Kevin Gottlieb and Associates, 
Inc., a Maryland firm that specializes in training 
individuals and organizations on how to create grassroots 
constituencies. 
3. Dr. Gottlieb, the workshop facilitator, is a persuasive 
and engaging speaker, peppering his talks with local 
examples, adages and other phrases to keep the attention of 
his audience.  He told workshop participants that the most 
effective way to achieve their organizations\' goals is to 
focus on one priority at a time, and to build coalitions, 
internally and externally. Politics is about inclusion, he 
said, not exclusion, and one must be vigilant against 
discriminating against any member of your network on the 
basis of gender, race, age, or sexual preference. He said an 
effective network or grassroots constituency is one that 
values the contributions of all its members, an essential 
quality if the group is to be successful in achieving its 
goals.  He cited as an example the case of eight people 
stuck in an elevator of the World Trade Center towers during 
the terrorist attacks three years ago.  He said not one of 
the high-powered, Wall Street brokers or businesspeople in 
the elevator knew what to do when the elevator became stuck 
in-between floors.  He said they managed to escape because a 
maintenance man, who was also trapped in the elevator, 
improvised and used a pen-knife to cut through an elevator 
wall, allowing the group to escape to safety. 
 
4. Dr. Gottlieb said politics and campaigning is the 
practice of promising items to a constituency but that 
governing is the art of how you deliver on those promises. 
He said effective constituencies hold their leaders 
accountable to promises made.  One workshop participant 
complained that residents of the Upper West, Northern and 
Upper East Regions of Ghana feel marginalized by the focus 
given to southern regions by the central government in 
Accra.  Dr. Gottlieb recommended that legislators in the 
Upper West Region reach out to colleagues in the southern 
Ashanti region for help in securing more resources and 
programs for the north in exchange for providing their 
support to help meet the needs of people in the south. 
 
5. One of the unexpected pleasures for the workshop 
participants and facilitator was a \"field trip\" to a 
political rally by President John Kufuor, who was in Wa at 
the same time.  President Kufuor was not officially a 
candidate for re-election (he filed his papers several days 
after the rally), but the durbar, or gathering of chiefs in 
the region, was clearly political, with vendors selling 
political buttons, banners and sun visors, printed with the 
President\'s face and the red, white and blue colors of the 
ruling New Patriotic Party. 
 
6. The rally proved a valuable example for workshop 
participants of how a veteran politician can work a crowd, 
even one that is not very supportive.  Wa has traditionally 
supported an opposition political party (the National 
Democratic Congress), and the audience for the President was 
noticeably sparse, mostly made up of students bused to the 
parade grounds.  Yet the President smiled, waved and walked 
the inside perimeter of the grounds and shaking hands with 
audience members in the front rows, including our workshop 
participants.  The President even stopped for small talk and 
a photo with Dr. Gottlieb.  Moments later, during his 
speech, President Kufuor told residents he was visiting Wa 
because he wanted see for himself the status of projects his 
government has arranged for the region, and he then 
recounted several public works his government has promoted 
for the region. 
 
7. The next day, Dr. Gottlieb led a spirited discussion with 
workshop participants, dissecting the President\'s speech and 
appearance.  Dr. Gottlieb asked the workshop participants if 
they thought the President realized the crowd was small and 
consisted almost solely of students, to which there was a 
resounding chorus of \"yes.\"  He also asked if they noticed 
that the President mentioned, but did not elaborate on, the 
condition of the main road into town, which has remained 
unpaved for years, and again, most chimed in with \"yes.\" An 
assemblyman from the President\'s party defended Mr. Kufuor, 
saying he did not expand on the road issue because he 
probably did not want to make empty promises about its 
completion.  This prompted groans from other class members, 
and one complained that most members of Parliament and other 
politicians are unresponsive to the needs of their 
constituencies once elected.  Dr. Gottlieb said voters must 
hold their elected leaders accountable.  He urged 
participants to use the locally-based University for 
Development Studies to document how the main road, once 
paved, would promote greater trade and tourism to the 
region.  Dr. Gottlieb also encouraged workshop participants 
to use the news media as a means of pressuring politicians 
to fulfill campaign promises, and to press legislators to 
build coalitions with political leaders in other regions to 
push through the priorities of the northern regions. 
 
8. Results of the three-day workshop were outstanding, with 
participants using the opportunity to exchange phone numbers 
and addresses and to begin to forge coalitions to work 
toward development of the northern regions.  Some suggested 
that the workshop should be offered to higher-ranking 
officials so that they would benefit from the ideas on how 
to create a grassroots constituency and follow through on 
campaign promises.  Some participants recommended that the 
workshop should be longer, with more attention paid to 
ethics in government, but overall, the evaluations by the 
workshop participants were positive with comments such as 
\"excellent\", \"I can better mobilize people at the community 
level\" as a result of attending the workshop and \"I am going 
to share these experiences with my fellow women and men 
friends, and especially my husband.\" 
 
9.  Post appreciates the support of ECA and IIP for their 
assistance in arranging this important workshop, coming only 
weeks before Ghana\'s national elections December 7.  It was 
ECA\'s International Visitors Leadership Program, which 
identified Dr. Gottlieb as a speaker for an IVLP program 
last year in Washington.  That appearance led IVLP program 
participant Mr. Bayon to urge post to seek the IIP Speaker 
Bureau\'s help in arranging for Dr. Gottlieb to be the 
facilitator of a grassroots democracy workshop in Ghana. 
Post recommends hiring Dr. Gottlieb for similar workshops 
elsewhere.  He is a high-energy, low-maintenance speaker, 
who connects well with people of other cultures.

1.  (SBU)  Summary: The International Peace Academy (IPA), 
in association with the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS), held a conference on West Africa conflict 
management and prevention in Accra on October 17-19.  Among 
the specific themes discussed were: the need for ECOWAS to 
play a greater role in conflict prevention and post-conflict 
development; the need for greater ECOWAS coordination with 
the UN; the gains made in Liberia and Sierra Leone; the risk 
of renewed conflict in Cte d\'Ivoire; and the threat to the 
sub-region posed by bad governance in Guinea.  Ghana\'s 
Deputy Foreign Minister stressed Ghana\'s continued 
commitment to helping conflict resolution in West Africa, 
including efforts to deal with tensions in Guinea Bissau. 
End summary. 
 
Peacekeeping Conference 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  The International Peace Academy (headed by former 
U.S. Ambassador to Sierra Leone John Hirsch), in partnership 
with ECOWAS and the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping 
Training Center, hosted a conference October 17-19 on 
conflict prevention and resolution in West Africa.  Among 
the 60-70 participants were: ECOWAS Executive Secretary 
Mohammed Ibn Chambas and Deputy Executive Secretary Cheick 
Oumar Diarra; the UN\'s Special Representatives of the 
Secretary General (SRSG) for West Africa, Sierra Leone and 
 
SIPDIS 
Cte d\'Ivoire; Deputy SRSG for Liberia Abou Moussa; Dr. 
Christopher Landsberg, Director of the Southern Africa 
a 
Development Community (SADC); and a number of NGO 
representatives and academics from across West Africa.  The 
conference was a follow on to similar meetings organized by 
the IPA in Abuja (2001) and Dakar (2002).  The goal of the 
conference was to review the effectiveness of the ECOWAS 
security mechanism and to make recommendations for 
improvements to the African Union and UN. 
 
The Role of ECOWAS 
------------------ 
 
3.  (U)  Participants noted that ECOWAS was set up to deal 
with economic and development issues, and was growing into 
its role in handling conflict situations.  ECOWAS Executive 
Secretary Chambas and others praised ECOWAS\' role in 
 
SIPDIS 
conflict resolution, but stressed the need to do better at 
conflict prevention and post-conflict development.  He 
highlighted the need for a regional standby force with 
possible US training, further development of the 
peacekeeping training center in Mali, expansion of the war 
college in Abuja, and adoption of an ECOWAS small arms 
convention by December 2005.  Conference participants were 
generally pessimistic about the African Union\'s ability to 
play a more effective role in conflict prevention. 
 
Institutional Issues 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (U) Participants highlighted the need to improve 
coordination between ECOWAS and the UN.  ECOWAS will hold 
consultations with the EU beginning on November 8 in Accra, 
with peace and security issues expected to be at the 
forefront. Chambas stated that the International Contact 
Group of Liberia is expanding its mandate to include Guinea- 
Bissau and Cote d\'Ivoire, and will now be called the 
International Contact Group on the Mano River Region. 
Participants discussed the creation of an ECOWAS rapid 
response force. Despite the challenges ECOWAS faces, 
participants noted that ECOWAS has greater institutional 
capacity than most African regional organizations. 
 
5.  (U)  The Program for Coordination and Assistance for 
Security and Development in Africa (PCASED) will be renamed 
the ECOWAS Small Arms Project. Participants discussed 
turning the ECOWAS moratorium on small arms and light 
weapons (SALW) into a convention by December 2005. While 
early warning remains a weakness, Chambas said ECOWAS is 
working with experts from the US, UK and France to improve 
this capacity. Chambas said he expects significant support 
for the SALW unit from the UK, France and the Netherlands. 
 
Regional Conflicts 
------------------ 
 
6.  (SBU)  Abou Moussa, Deputy Special Representative of the 
UN Secretary General (SSRG) in Liberia, told participants 
Liberia was making progress and could recover fully with 
adequate resources and a few years of rebuilding.  While 
acknowledging challenges such as corruption, unemployment, 
political infighting, he said Liberia has made substantial 
improvements in strengthening the rule of law, he said. 
Moussa was confident that the October 2005 elections will go 
ahead as planned.  Rebuilding infrastructure is key to 
strengthening the peace, he said, underscoring the 
importance of speeding the flow of donor aid into the 
country. 
 
7.  (SBU)  With the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) set 
to draw down by December 2005, the country continues to make 
progress, according to Daudi Ngelautwa Mwakawago, SSRG in 
Sierra Leone.  He acknowledged the need to reform the 
judiciary, restructure the army, and improve the 
infrastructure in Sierra Leone, but he presented a generally 
positive picture of a security force and economy rebuilding. 
 
8.  (SBU)  The SRSG for Cte d\'Ivoire Albert Tevoedjre was 
downbeat about the situation in Ivory Coast, saying \"every 
day brings a new crisis\" and that a major crisis could be 
looming several months away.  He opined that next year\'s 
scheduled election could result in new crisis if not well- 
organized because President Gbagbo, who Tevoedjre said 
remains unwilling to compromise, would then have no 
legitimate claim to hold onto power.  Tevoedjre refuted some 
reports that there are divisions among the Forces Nouvelles, 
while asserting that the Cote D\'Ivoire army no longer wants 
to fight. 
 
9.  (SBU)  Participants expressed strong concern about the 
situation in Guinea.  Brigadier-General Charles Mankatah, 
Commandant of the Kofi Annan Center, told poloff privately 
that it was obvious to him Guinea would be the next failed 
state in West Africa.  Some conference participants called 
on Ghanaian President John Kufuor, as Chairman of ECOWAS, 
and Nigerian President Obasanjo (because he is seen as 
respected by Guinea\'s President Cont) to go to Conakry 
soon.  Participants were critical that little was being done 
by ECOWAS or others in the region to try to prevent a Guinea 
crisis.  ECOWAS reps responded that they had met with 
President Cont prior to the 2003 election and found him 
unwilling to compromise. 
 
10.  (SBU)  Ghana\'s Deputy Foreign Minister Kwasi Osei-Adjei 
addressed the conference, highlighting Ghana\'s commitment to 
o 
international peacekeeping and to playing a constructive 
role in enhancing the security environment in West Africa. 
He noted that Ghana had been providing some financial aid 
and diplomatic support, through ECOWAS, to help stabilize 
Guinea Bissau.  President Kufuor continued to \"work behind 
the scenes\" on Guinea Bissau.  When asked why Ghana had not 
succumbed to conflict like so many of its neighbors, he 
responded that Ghanaian politics is inclusive, allowing for 
input from civil society, traditional chiefs and others, who 
have a voice through functioning democratic institutions. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (SBU)  The conference highlighted some of the vexing 
challenges in regional conflict resolution - how to 
reconcile humanitarian intervention with sovereignty issues, 
whether pushing for early elections can exacerbate 
instability, how to improve early warning systems and 
preventive intervention, and how to best coordinate 
multilateral efforts.  Conference participants believed 
ECOWAS recognizes the urgency for and has the capability of 
playing a more effective role in conflict prevention.  There 
were no specific follow-on action items proposed, although 
the IPA will publish a report on the conference in several 
months.

ETHICS\" - AUGUST 13 - SEPTEMBER 5, 2004 - 
EVALUATION 
 
 
1. Summary:  Five members of Ghana\'s 
judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court Chief 
Justice, participated in a three-week funded 
single country International Visitor 
Leadership program under the theme \"Judicial 
Reform and Ethics\". Participant line-up was: 
Justice George Kingsley Acquah, Chief Justice 
of Ghana; Justice Sophia Abena Boafoa Akuffo, 
Supreme Court Judge; Justice Victor Jones 
Mawulom Dotse, Appeals Court Judge; Justice 
Mariama Owusu, High Court Judge; and Judge 
Wilhelmina Hammond, Circuit Court Judge.  The 
Chief Justice and other IVLP participants 
shared conclusions and observations from the 
trip with DCM, POL and PAS personnel at a 
recent luncheon hosted by the DCM at his 
residence. End summary. 
 
2. Description: a) At luncheon given in their honor by 
the DCM and attended by PAS and POL officers, the 
Ghanaian Chief Justice and other high-ranking judges who 
recently returned from an International Visitors 
Leadership Program in the United States, noted that the 
US judicial and legal systems are firmly rooted in the 
principles of law and order, compliance with the law, 
strict enforcement of the law, respect for the rule of 
law and the independence of the judiciary.  The judges 
indicated that their visit was a great success, and 
expressed surprise at the extent to which courts in the 
US were computerized, and especially so at the 
\"Courtroom 21\" in Williamsburg, Virginia. Chief Justice 
Acquah, who heads the Ghanaian judiciary, has 
recommended that, as part of the judicial reforms in 
Ghana, the US Sentencing Commission should be studied 
closely and \"implemented in Ghana\".  He talked about the 
group\'s visit in Washington DC to the Federal Judicial 
Center, the Department of Justice, the American Bar 
Association Center and the offices of \"Judicial Watch\", 
an NGO, where they had first hand knowledge and 
experience in the area of federalism and state, as well 
as a general overview of the state judicial system. 
 
b) Chief Justice Acquah recommended that institutional 
linkages be established between the Faculty of Law of 
the University of Ghana, the Ghana School of Law, and 
\"Courtroom 21\", to enable young Ghanaian attorneys to 
receive further legal training and exposure to the 
latest state-of-the art court technology. 
 
c) The Chief Justice noted that caseload management in 
US courts is \"excellent\", and marveled that there is a 
system in place designed to expedite the hearing and 
determination of cases.  He has proposed that it would 
be worthwhile to incorporate some procedures used in the 
US civil and criminal courts to the new rules being 
designed for Ghanaian courts.  The Ghanaian team also 
noted with interest, that, in the US, experts in a 
particular field of endeavor are appointed as managers 
and receivers of properties that have been placed under 
court injunctions, and that, sometimes the parties 
involved in the case make their own nominations of who 
should manage the properties.  As a result of 
information gleaned from his trip, Justice Acquah has 
proposed to discard the Ghanaian system of appointing 
court registrars as managers and receivers of seized 
properties, and in their place, adopt the \"US way\".  He 
also recommended that the revised Ghanaian code of 
ethics for judges and magistrates should be submitted to 
Professor Steven Lubet, a law professor at the 
Northwestern University in Chicago, for his comments and 
advice. 
 
d) The group noted with fascination, and at the same 
time, regret, that the Cook County jail law library is 
better resourced and equipped than the Ghanaian Supreme 
Court library.  With the same fascination, they talked 
about their visit to the crime laboratory and of 
learning, firsthand, how it operated.  Also of great 
interest to the team were the Mental Health Courts they 
visited in Oklahoma City, where, according to what they 
saw, medical personnel, probation officers, the police 
and all other related offices collaborate to help in the 
rehabilitation of mentally-challenged convicts. 
They lamented that due to bad weather and flight 
problems they were unable to visit the tribal courts in 
Oklahoma.  A visit to those courts, they said, would 
have afforded them the opportunity to learn how the 
formal court system in the US blends with tribal court 
decisions, and how a combination of the two systems 
could be applied to the Ghanaian court system vis--vis 
Ghanaian tribal courts. 
 
e) On Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), the team 
observed that this system is widely used and has been 
integrated into the US judicial system.  Justice Acquah 
noted that JAMS, a local NGO based in California, has 
made great strides in the use of ADR.  He said that the 
appellate mediation program they learned about in 
Philadelphia is a unique system which deserves to be 
studied closely for possible replication in Ghana. 
Another observation by the group was that important US 
institutions like the court system, the Department of 
Justice, the FBI and police are all well-respected and 
adequately resourced, and there are sufficient checks 
and balances to ensure that all these organizations do 
not abuse their powers; stating further that these 
organs of state collaborated very well with prison and 
probation officers and medical personnel. 
f) On home hospitality, Chief Justice Acquah said that 
there were numerous dinner invitations and visits to 
homes, and he expressed the gratitude of the group to 
the organizers of the program for the warm reception. 
The group appreciated the excellent coordination of all 
events and activities, especially mentioning their 
English Language Officer Dr. Raiford, whose help and 
support was invaluable.  They also highly commended 
Judges Anne Claire Williams, of the US Appeals Court in 
Chicago, Vicki Miles-LaGrange, US District Court Judge 
in Oklahoma, and Theodore McKee, US Circuit Court Judge 
in Philadelphia, for their willingness to share valuable 
information, advice and support for the group.  Another 
group they mentioned was the \"very pleasant team\" from 
the Department of State, who met and welcomed them 
during their administrative briefing.  They expressed 
their intention to follow up on discussions with the 
Federal Judicial Center in Washington DC to explore 
possible areas of collaboration and institutional 
linkages. 
 
3.  Cities and Dates:   The program took the 
visitors to Washington DC (08/13 - 20, 2004); 
Williamsburg, Virginia (08/20 - 21, 2004); 
Chicago, Illinois (08/21 - 25, 2004); Oklahoma 
City, Oklahoma (08/25 - 28, 2004); Los 
Angeles, California (08/28 - 09/1, 2004); 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (09/01 - 09/03, 
2004); and New York City (09/02/09/05, 2004). 
 
4.  Justification:  This Single Country Project is a 
further attempt by Mission to help the Ghanaian 
judiciary with its reforms and to help improve access to 
justice in the country.  Mission has supported the 
Ghanaian judiciary since 1997 when a group of Ghanaian 
legal experts visited the US on a Citizen Exchange 
program to learn about ADR, and this group succeeded in 
promoting the use of ADR in the Ghanaian court system 
and in local communities. 
 
5.  MPP Goals:  This program has given a major boost to 
relations between Mission and the office of the Chief 
Justice, and the Ghanaian judiciary as a whole. 
 
6.  Results/Impact:  Excellent.  The Single Country 
Project participants think that this program has been a 
\"great eye opener\".  To Ms. Justice Owusu, this visit 
was her first to the US, and according to her, she was 
not disappointed. 
 
7.  Quality of USG Support: Excellent.  The project was 
fully funded.

SUBJECT: GHANA ELECTION SEASON UPDATE: ONE MONTH TO GO 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) A month before Ghana\'s December 7 presidential and 
parliamentary elections, the campaign is heating up but the 
political atmosphere is generally peaceful.  The ruling New 
Patriotic Party (NPP) appears to have the edge over its three 
party rivals. Poor turnout during the public exhibition of 
the voter register and errors found among those who did show 
up may raise some questions about the legitimacy of the 
registration.  Nonetheless, the Electoral Commission is 
confident it can correct errors on the register.  Most local 
analysts see little potential for polling day rigging and 
believe the conditions are in place for a free and fair 
election.  The election is likely to be peaceful, although 
chieftancy and other disputes could lead to minor 
election-related violence.  The volatile Northern Region is 
quiet at the moment, following an isolated incident of 
violence in early October. End summary. 
 
----------------- 
NPP Likely to Win 
----------------- 
 
2. (U) Four presidential candidates officially filed their 
nominations with the Electoral Commission (EC) between 
October 20-22. The candidates and their running mates are: 
President John Kufuor and Alhaji Aliu Mahama for the New 
Patriotic Party (NPP), John Atta-Mills and Alhaji Mohammed 
Mumuni for the National Democratic Congress, Dr. Edward 
Mahama and Mr. Dan Ofori-Atta of the People\'s National 
Convention, representing the Grand Coalition (which comprises 
three small parties, including the PNC), and Mr. George 
Aguddey and Mr. Bright Kwame Ameyaw. 
 
3. (C) Political analysts here increasingly expect a solid 
NPP victory in both the presidential and parliamentary races. 
 While the NDC still has a hold on some traditional 
strongholds, it is hampered by the convalescence of its vice 
presidential candidate (still recovering from a car accident) 
and by financial difficulties.  It is not clear that the 
prominence of former President J.J. Rawlings in the campaign 
is helping the NDC.  One journalist contact highlighted 
Rawlings\' continued charisma and draw, but other analysts see 
Rawlings as a liability overall, reminding voters of the 
human rights abuses and authoritarian legacy of his years in 
power.  Senior NDC politician Hannah Tetteh Kpodar told 
PolOff on November 3 that \"it would be a miracle if NDC 
stumbles into victory.\"  She also said that the NDC would 
likely lose two seats in Parliament that it currently holds. 
 
4. (C) Academic and NGO political contacts agree that, while 
the economic situation of the average Ghanaian has not 
improved markedly, most voters seem willing to give the NPP 
another four years to deliver.  The NPP reportedly has been 
more active than the NDC in using its wealth and incumbency 
to buy food, bicycles and other items for voters.  High cocoa 
prices and yields should also benefit the NPP.  While the NPP 
is expected to do well, a recent study by the Center for 
Democracy and Development supported other sources in noting 
that the NPP has suffered more than other parties from 
intra-party conflict and corruption in the parliamentary 
primaries. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
The Electoral Commission Still Stumbling 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Since the Electoral Commission (EC) began its 
nationwide voter registration exercise in March 2004, its 
efforts to create a \'clean\' voter register have been hampered 
by resource and organizational problems. The EC\'s recent 
public exhibition of the register was disappointing. 
According to local press reports, turnout to examine names on 
the register was low; some centers recorded only 50 to 60 
percent of voters coming to verify the accuracy of their 
names and registration details. A number of those who 
examined their records found errors. According to a 
journalist contact, ten percent of those who came to check 
the roster in Western region found errors. 
 
6. (U) Representatives from all the political parties have 
called on the EC to hold a second, final exhibition of the 
register. Representatives of the EC told PolOff on November 3 
that it will not do so (and they have stated this publicly), 
but will instead mobilize its efforts to answer the 
challenges raised in the first exhibition. EC officials told 
PolOffs they are confident they will rectify all problems and 
consider any legitimate challenges to the register before the 
election. They acknowledge they are pressed for time, but 
will begin printing ballots next week and tell us they do not 
anticipate a delay in preparations for the election. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Isolated Concerns about Election Violence 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Political contacts expect a generally peaceful 
election, especially given the repeated pleas for peace by 
all political parties.  Nonetheless, there is the potential 
for local chieftancy disputes, personality clashes, 
commercial rivalries and other local issues to result in 
localized incidents of violence.  The Western Regional Police 
Commander recently told PolChief that he is worried about 
such election-related violence and the inadequacy of his 
small police force to respond. 
 
8. (SBU) The Northern Region remains volatile, with large 
quantities of small arms in the area and simmering ethnic 
tensions. An unresolved chieftancy dispute that led to the 
murder of the Ya-Na in 2002 (a case which is still under 
investigation), as well as a two-year state of emergency that 
was only lifted in August, lends added tension to the Dagbon 
and Tamale areas. On October 3, a 14-year-old boy (an alleged 
NDC supporter) was fatally shot during a clash between NPP 
and NDC party supporters in the area. There are many rumors 
and few facts about this case.  After the shooting, police 
raided the suspect\'s home and found in his freezer an AK47 
which matches the type of bullet that killed the boy. The 
suspect, Baba Nkarbo (a well-known NPP activist), and an 
alleged accomplice, Nuhu Nkarbo, are currently in police 
custody while investigations continue.  Observers agree that 
there is the potential for more politically-linked violence 
in the Northern Region in the coming month. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C)  With one month to go, the NPP is not taking a 
presidential victory for granted.  Campaign rhetoric is 
generally civil and the political atmosphere is peaceful. 
The EC\'s problems with the register are troubling and it will 
have to scramble to get ready in the coming month. 
International donors to the EC are frustrated with its 
institutional weaknesses, delays and cost overruns.  Despite 
these problems, which do not appear too major, the Ghana 
election seems likely to be generally peaceful and fair.  End 
Comment.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) PolChief met on November 3 with Ghana,s Attorney 
General and Minister for Justice, Papa Owuso-Ankomah, to 
raise concerns about progress on the draft bill of a 
trafficking-in-persons (TIP) law. Owuso-Ankomah was familiar 
with the pending legislation and its status, and said that if 
the ministries involved could not reach agreement on 
ownership of the bill by January, he would submit the bill 
directly to Parliament himself. However, he said that it was 
highly unlikely that the legislation would be passed by 
Parliament before April due to other, more immediate, demands 
that the newly-elected Parliament will have to address early 
in 2005. End summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
PASSAGE OF TIP LAW BY APRIL UNLIKELY 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Owuso-Ankomah was well informed about the proposed TIP 
law, noting that Cabinet had initially decided to delegate 
development of this legislation to the Ministry of Women\'s 
and Children\'s Affairs (MOWAC).  After consultative 
workshops, the GoG realized that the TIP issue cuts across 
several ministries, including the Ministry of Interior, the 
Ministry of Manpower, Development, and Employment (MMDE), and 
MOWAC. For this reason, he said these ministries needed to 
reach consensus on the draft bill before it is submitted to 
Cabinet for approval.  Owuso-Ankomah acknowledged that the 
MOWAC and MMDE were not in agreement over responsibility for 
this issue, saying he did not want to get involved out of 
&courtesy8 and &respect8 for a democratic bureaucratic 
process.  However, he told PolChief emphatically that if the 
ministries do not reach consensus and move the bill to 
Cabinet by January 2005, he would take the matter out of 
their hands and submit the bill directly to Cabinet himself. 
 
3. (C) PolChief explained that if the bill is not passed by 
April, the USG would likely downgrade Ghana from Tier 1 to 
Tier 2.  Owuso-Ankomah said he saw no way the TIP law would 
be passed in this timeframe, given what he saw as the 
realities of Ghanaian politics in the next six months.  Even 
if the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) wins the election in 
December and even if he submits the bill to Cabinet directly 
himself in January, the Cabinet would be a lame duck body for 
several months. All of the newly-elected president,s Cabinet 
appointments will require parliamentary approval.  This 
approval of the Cabinet posts may not occur until the end of 
the first parliamentary session (January-March), he thought. 
 
4. (C) In addition to approving a Cabinet, the priorities of 
the new legislature will be receiving the new President\'s 
state of the nation speech, passing a budget, and forming 
parliamentary committees.  Owuso-Ankomah did not expect 
Parliament to take up legislation until its second session 
(April-July).  He said he would ensure that the TIP 
legislation would be sent to Parliament (after getting 
Cabinet approval) &as one of our priorities for next 
session8 but because of &timing and priorities8 it would 
not likely be taken up until the April-July period.  PolChief 
noted that the Department would like raise the TIP issue with 
Ambassador Poku in Washington. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) Owuso-Ankomah was uncharacteristically open and 
friendly, making time for PolChief in the midst of his own 
parliamentary campaign and blocking all outside calls during 
our meeting.  Despite the Minister\'s pessimism on the TIP law 
passing before April, we will continue to raise the TIP 
legislation issue with the GOG and in Parliament, especially 
with the new government after the election.  His resolve to 
break the deadlock between the line ministries if necessary 
was welcome news and should help position this legislation - 
which does not appear to be controversial within Ghana - for 
passage within the next year. End comment.

Summary 
------- 
1. (U) Kaiser Aluminum has sold its 90-percent stake in the 
Volta River Aluminum Company (Valco) to the Government of 
Ghana (GoG)for USD 18.5 million.  After Parliament ratified 
the sale agreement on October 28 (septel), GoG and Kaiser 
officials met in London on October 29 to complete the 
official close of the sale.  Both sides also agreed to 
terminate the arbitration case (ref A), which had been 
suspended since the May 2004 signing of the agreement. 
Despite opposition party leaders\' earlier threats to debate 
the legality of the sale (ref B), the agreement passed with 
little debate or difficulty.  The GoG is already negotiating 
a deal with several aluminum companies (including ALCOA) to 
take over VALCO and mine Ghana\'s bauxite.  End Summary. 
 
Parliament Passes VAlCO Purchase Deal 
------------------------------------- 
2. (C) Ministry of Finance contacts told Econoffs that 
Parliament\'s Finance and Energy Committees held two closed, 
day-long joint sessions with the Attorney General to get the 
agreement to the floor in time for a vote.  There was little 
of the promised debate from the opposition (ref C), and the 
agreement passed with a vote of 120 to 1 on Thursday, October 
28.  Kaiser officials raced to close the deal before the end 
of the week, insisting on a meeting in London on Friday.  By 
November 2, the entire USD 13.5 million held in escrow had 
been disbursed.  Just over half the money (USD 9.9 million) 
paid severance packages for VALCO\'s 287 workers. 
 
3. (SBU) There are, however, a few outstanding issues.  The 
Ghanaian Internal Revenue Service claims Kaiser owes back 
taxes on dividend remittances.  According to Kaiser, the sale 
agreement contains a tax indemnity clause, which would 
require the GoG to add the cost of any tax to the purchase 
price.  Kaiser feels this lays the issue to rest and sent a 
letter to the GoG declaring the sale to be complete, 
notwithstanding this last issue. 
 
GoG Negotiations with International Aluminum Companies 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
4. (C) The GoG is anxious to attract an investor to mine and 
process Ghana\'s bauxite reserves, using their stake in Valco 
as equity in a partnership (ref C).  According to Valco\'s 
Resident Director, Dr. Charles Mensa, Rusal Aluminum, BHP 
Billiton, and Alcoa have all submitted bids for projects that 
would include bauxite mining, and an alumina refinery, in 
addition to operating Valco.  Alcoa representatives have 
described their involvement to Econoffs as \"very active,\" 
adding that the total investment could exceed USD 1 billion. 
 
5. (C) Mensa told Econoff that he and a \"team of experts\" 
were currently evaluating the bids for the GoG.  He considers 
Alcoa\'s and Billington\'s to be the strongest.  Mensa hopes to 
get a small portion of Valco up and running by the end of the 
year and to have a deal in place with either Alcoa or 
Billington by the end of January.  Econoff\'s contact at Alcoa 
says Mensa\'s timeline is unrealistic.  Alcoa submitted a 
draft MOU in August, outlining its proposals for VALCO and 
bauxite mining and refining, but has yet to receive any 
comments from Mensa and his team other than that the MOU was 
\"too specific\" about power rates. 
 
Note: Libya\'s Interest in Valco 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Media reports confirm that the GoG signed a Protocol 
on Agricultural Trade with the Government of Libya last week. 
 A statement issued by the MFA in Ghana says the countries 
also agreed to share information on the aluminum industry \"to 
study possible cooperation\".  Mensa was familiar with the 
agreement and claimed the Libyans wanted Valco to become the 
cornerstone of an \"African Aluminum Industry\".  He says 
President Kufuor does not consider Libyan overtures to be 
realistic, adding that Libya has offered no money and even 
less in the way of vialbe plans for Valco\'s future.  End 
Note. 
 
Comment- Power is Key 
--------------------- 
7. (C) Power is the heart of any discussion of Valco. 
Aluminum cannot be smelted profitably without heavy power 
subsidies.  Valco draws one-third of the total power Ghana is 
capable of producing, and the addition of a mine and refinery 
could triple the need.  Currently, Ghana\'s thermal powerplant 
in Takoradi is only run at 25 percent capacity for 6 hours 
per day because the cost of crude oil makes operations 
prohibitive.  To compensate, the GoG imports power from Cote 
d\'Ivoire.  Water levels in Lake Volta are high enough to 
ensure that hydropower can be supplied for the next year, but 
it is the only economic source for Valco.  If the lake\'s 
level falls and the supply from Cote d\' Ivoire is interrupted 
before the West Africa Gas Pipeline is completed the GoG 
could be forced to keep Valco closed for some time.  End

SUBJECT: ALLEGED COUP PLOT THWARTED IN GHANA: SEVEN ARRESTED 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) On November 6, the Ghanaian Criminal Investigative 
Division (CID) arrested seven men for allegedly engaging in 
\'coup plotting\'. Local press reports are conflicting on 
whether there were current and/or active members of the 
military among the seven arrested. The head of the CID, Mr. 
David Asante-Apeatu, issued a press release saying that the 
men were \"planning to commit acts of sabotage and subvert the 
state.\" He denied allegations that there were any active 
military members or former officers arrested. One news source 
reported that four of the seven have been released on bail, 
but this has yet to be confirmed by local authorities. End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
ALLEGED COUP PLOT THWARTED: POSSIBLE MILITARY INVOLVEMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (SBU) A group of seven men were arrested on November 6 for 
allegedly plotting a coup to overthrow the current government 
and disrupt national elections planned for December 7. 
According to a press release from Mr. Asante-Apeatu, head of 
the CID, the alleged coup plotters were found with military 
equipment, a firearm, and ammunition. 
 
3. (U) Press reports about the military connections of those 
arrested are conflicting. The Ghanaian Times, a state-owned 
newspaper considered to be one of the more reliable dailies 
here, reported that there were both \"serving and retired 
military personnel\" among the group arrested. The Ghana 
Review International also quoted a high-level source from the 
president\'s office as saying that the group included \"serving 
and retired military personnel.\" However, other press reports 
either do not address this allegation or dispute it. Mr. 
Asante-Apeatu is quoted in a Reuter\'s story as saying, \"I 
want to emphasize that what we\'ve uncovered had nothing to do 
with the armed forces. The group we arrested on Saturday 
consists of civilians or ex-soldiers.\" 
 
4. (SBU) No names have been released to the public. However, 
three of the four suspects were reportedly detained 
previously on similar allegations and eventually released 
(Note: These three are among the four who are alleged to be 
former military members). A Pol contact reported that the 
police found no weaponry when they searched the suspects\' 
residences. 
 
5. (U) One radio station, Joy News, reported that four of the 
seven have been granted bail, though this has not yet been 
confirmed by local authorities or other press outlets. Under 
Ghanaian law, the suspects can be held for 48 hours to allow 
for initial investigations. If they are not brought before a 
court within 48 hours of arrest, then they must be freed. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
DESPITE SECURITY THREATS, THE SITUATION IS CALM 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (U) Despite this latest incident, the security situation 
in Ghana remains calm. There is no evidence of heightened 
military or police presence as a result of the weekend\'s 
arrests. In his press release, Mr. Asante-Apeatu reassured 
the public that the authorities had been effectively 
monitoring the threat and had reacted appropriately. In a 
separate address in Kumasi, the Minister of Defense, Dr. 
Kwame Addo-Kufuor, further upheld the Ghana Armed Forces as 
being ready to protect and defend the Ghanaian constitution. 
 
7. (U) One local press report quoted an unnamed member of the 
major opposition party, the National Democratic Congress 
(NDC), as denouncing the alleged coup plot as a \'fabricated\' 
scare tactic by the ruling National Patriotic Party to gain 
political leverage in the final weeks before the election. 
(Note: This opinion appears to be an isolated one, and its 
credibility is further reduced by the fact that no NDC 
representatives have gone on the record saying this). 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) In the lead-up to this year\'s presidential and 
parliamentary elections, isolated rumors and incidents of 
violence have cropped up. Regional violence related to 
chieftancy disputes in the north continues to be a concern 
for many. Scattered rumors of mercenaries and coup plotters 
have previously been denied by both major political parties, 
though may/may be partially verifiable by the November 6 
arrests. In spite of these isolated incidents, however, a 
full-scale political coup in Ghana seems unlikely and the 
prospects for free and fair elections in December remain 
optimistic at this point in time. End comment.

SUBJECT: FORMER PRESIDENT RAWLINGS RAISES ELECTION CONCERNS 
WITH POLCHIEF 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Jerry Lanier for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) On November 6, PolChief met with former President (and 
senior National Democratic Party activist) J.J. Rawlings, at 
Rawlings\' request, in his home.  He was joined by his wife 
and two senior NDC party officials.  Rawlings decried what he 
saw as an unlevel playing field in this election, claiming 
the Electoral Commission is biased and the voting register is 
seriously flawed.  If the election is rigged, the military 
could become frustrated and try to stage a coup, he opined. 
He thought the USG was too pro-NPP.  Rawlings hoped foreign 
missions would push for a recheck of the register and would 
post observers in the EC on election day.  PolChief stressed 
our interest in free, fair, peaceful, democratic elections, 
noting that we had met recently with the NDC and all parties, 
and stated that we would be cautious and even-handed in our 
approach to the election.  End summary. 
 
---------------------- 
NO LEVEL PLAYING FIELD 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) Rawlings and his associates expressed serious concerns 
that there was not a fair playing field in the run-up to the 
December 7 presidential and parliamentary elections.   Some 
proportedly nonpartisan NGOs involved in election monitoring 
are biased toward the NPP, they alleged, specifically naming 
Pronet and the Center for Democratic Development (CDD).  The 
NPP is using large sums of money to buy votes, deliberately 
distorting NDC rallies on television to make them look 
smaller than they are, using public buses for party 
propaganda, and other alleged abuses of incumbency. 
 
---------------------------- 
THE ELECTION REGISTER FLAWED 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Rawlings highlighted problems with the voter register. 
 The EC was biased toward and controlLed by the NPP, he 
alleged, contending that it was tampering with the register. 
Specifically, he alleged that the EC had changed the names of 
some elderly voters to known NPP supporters, and left gaps in 
the serial numbers of the register to facilitate fake voting 
on polling day.  Some photos on the register were fading 
because they were poor quality.  Rawlings and his colleagues 
were appalled with the EC\'s admission that 55 percent of 
registered voters did not appear to check the register during 
the October 12-17 exhibition.  (Note: This does not appear to 
be unusually high since the purpose of checking the register 
was merely to confirm information on those who were already 
legally registered). They blamed the EC for mismanaging the 
process, requiring voters to make separate trips to register, 
take photos, and check the registration list, and allowing 
too little time to finalize the register.  They suspect the 
NPP will try stuffing ballots either on election day or 
during vote counting. 
 
------------------------ 
OTHER ATTACKS ON THE NPP 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Rawlings and his colleagues scoffed at the NPP\'s 
proported accomplishments.  The NPP\'s \"So Far, So Good\" list 
of achievements was \"70 percent lies\" or achievements 
initiated by the former PNDC (Rawlings) government.  The 
government of President Kufuor had violated human rights in 
its involvement with the murder of the Ya Na in Dagomba 
(Northern Region) in 2002, was damaging the country\'s 
economy, and was very corrupt, according to Rawlings.  The 
NPP had \"replaced respect with fear of authority\", and unduly 
favoring Akans in the government and army (Kufuor is an 
Ashanti, the dominant Akan tribe).   Worst of all, Rawlings 
said, were the NPP\'s \"party police\" who \"want to create 
havoc.\" 
 
------------------------ 
HINTS OF A MILITARY COUP 
------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Rawlings was confident the NDC would win the upcoming 
election despite these problems.  However, he devoted 
significant time to justifying his own military coups of the 
past and suggested that if this election is seen as rigged, 
some in the military could possibly try to stage a coup, \"and 
no one could hold them back\".  If world opinion had not 
shifted strongly against military intervention, Kufuor would 
have already been overthrown in a coup, he said. 
 
----------- 
USG ACTIONS 
----------- 
6. (C) Rawlings and his colleagues contended that the USG had 
favored the NPP in 2000 because, he said, the U.S. believed a 
change of party was important to validate Ghana\'s democracy. 
In 2000, Western donors were too quick to declare the 
election free and fair, Rawlings asserted, stating \"don\'t be 
intoxicated with the NPP because they are the government in 
power.\"  His wife began the discussion by urging that 
PolChief be \"open-minded about the NDC, unlike some of your 
colleagues.\" 
 
7. (C) PolChief emphasized that the USG\'s interest is that 
the upcoming election be a free, fair, and peaceful 
democratic representation of the will of the Ghanaian people, 
no matter who wins.  He noted that we had met with the NDC 
presidential candidate John Atta Mills and some his senior 
colleagues, as well as senior party leaders from the NPP and 
other parties, the EC, and civil society.  We had also 
traveled widely during the pre-election period and were 
tracking election events closely.  PolChief noted that we 
take the NDC\'s concerns seriously and did raise some of these 
issues about the voting register with the EC.  He noted that 
the Embassy was contributing over $1 million to the EC and 
election-related work, and that we would contribute 
substantially to the pool of foreign Mission observers 
deployed in this election.  We would proceed in a cautious, 
even-handed manner.  PolChief highlighted the role party 
polling agents needed to play to ensure the election was fair. 
 
8. (C) PolChief asked what at this point could be done to 
increase the NDC\'s confidence in the voter register.  \"It\'s 
not too late to do something\", Rawlings said, noting his hope 
that the register would be shared with all the parties soon 
(the parties had the list to review two months before the 
2000 election).  He hoped foreign observers would not just 
deploy in the field but would be present in the EC office on 
election day.  \"Our polling agents will be vigilant and know 
what to do\", he said. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (C) There is an element of drama and paranoia in Rawlings\' 
world view: the USG is against the NDC, the NPP is bent on 
rigging the election, the EC is biased, the military is 
disgruntled.  While generally welcoming, he was often 
distracted, fussing with picture frames, pills, the stereo, 
his cell phone.  Several times he cut off PolChief\'s efforts 
to respond to his points.  His claims about EC register 
manipulation was unsubstantiated and fears of NPP 
manipulation probably overstated.  His talk of military coups 
seemed loose and theoretical, but pointed (\"I want you to be 
clear about what I\'m saying\", he asserted). 
 
10. (C) Nonetheless, his deep distrust of the NPP and of 
preparations for this election are disturbing.  We heard 
similar views from NDC party leaders and activists in Kumasi 
(Ashanti region) over the past few days.  NDC workers claim 
the NPP is tearing down their posters, intimidating their 
candidates, and spreading large amounts of cash to buy votes. 
 Some of these claims appear credible, in that it is clear 
that each major party is removing the posters of the other, 
and one presumes that vote-buying is a feature of practically 
all elections in countries such as Ghana.  Rawlings\' 
frustration with the EC and the voting register, shared to 
some measure by many in civil society, casts some doubt on 
whether the NDC would readily accept an electoral defeat 
(although Atta Mills, who does not necessarily get his 
marching orders from Rawlings, has told us he would accept 
the results).  Rawlings\' thoughts about military coup 
possibilities bear watching, especially in light of the NDC\'s 
fears of a flawed election and eagerness to get back in power 
(and Ghana\'s history of coups), as well as the arrest of 
seven people over the weekend for alleged coup plotting 
(reftel XXX). 
 
11. (SBU) The USG -- through USAID and PAS support for the 
election process, our observer teams, our meetings with all 
the parties and ongoing dialogue with the Electoral 
Commission, and our cautious approach to public statements 
about the election -- has been playing an important role in 
strengthening confidence in and acceptability of the election 
results.  The Rawlings meeting underscores the need to 
continue with these efforts. End Comment.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EINV, EAIR, ENRG, GH, OPIC 
SUBJECT: GHANA: FINAL PARLIAMENT ACTION IN 2004 
 
REF: ACCRA 02044 
 
1. This cable highlights significant legislation that passed 
Parliament during its October 5 - November 4 session and 
follows up on bills of particular US interest, as highlighted 
Reftel. 
 
2. In its final session of 2004, Parliament ratified the 
OPIC-Ghana Investment Incentives Agreement, passed the 
agreement to purchase VALCO from Kaiser Aluminum, and 
approved a new civil aviation law and enabling legislation 
for the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP).  Econoffs pushed 
extremely hard for passage of these four items during early 
October meetings with Parliamentary leaders (see reftel). 
(Note: The Minister of Parliamentary Affairs told the 
Ambassador that he appreciated the nudge from the Embassy on 
these matters.) Parliament also passed the Venture Capital 
and Long Term Savings bills, both priorities for President 
Kufuor and his administration. 
 
3. Parliament ratified the OPIC Investment Incentive 
Agreement between Ghana and the U.S. on October 19.  This 
agreement, which was signed in 1999 but never ratified, 
replaces the 1967 OPIC-Ghana agreement.  The new agreement 
will remove the lengthy GoG approval process that currently 
delays approval of OPIC projects by months,  OPIC will now be 
allowed to operate in Ghana\'s private sector without prior 
GoG approval of individual projects. 
 
4. Parliament passed the Civil Aviation Authority Bill on 
October 28.  This replaces the 1996 civair law and will 
ensure Ghana\'s compliance with obligations under the 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  The new 
law also strengthens the regulatory powers of the Director 
General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA).  (Note: 
 Econoffs stressed to leading Members of Parliament that this 
bill was critical for Ghana to stand a chance of retaining 
Category One status during the FAA safety reassessment later 
this year.  End Note) 
 
5. Following strong lobbying by Finance Ministry, Attorney 
General\'s office, Kaiser Aluminum officials and Econoffs, 
Parliament approved the VALCO Purchase Agreement on October 
28.  This agreement completes the GoG\'s purchase of 90 
percent of the issued shares of Volta Aluminum Company Ltd 
held by Kaiser Aluminum for USD 18.5 million (see septel). 
There was some concern that Parliament\'s minority parties -- 
mainly the NDC --  would not support the agreement because 
the GOG had previously made a payment of USD 5 million to 
Kaiser without prior Parliamentary approval.  However, the 
Attorney General\'s strong support for the agreement during 
several extraordinary meetings with the Finance and Trade and 
Industry Committees overcame any opposition.  The result was 
that the minority parties overwhelmingly supported the 
agreement and it passed with 120 votes in favor and only one 
vote against. 
 
6. Parliament passed the WAGP Bill on November 3.  This bill 
incorporates into Ghana\'s domestic laws the provisions of the 
West African Gas Pipeline Treaty between Ghana, Benin, 
Nigeria and Togo, which Ghana ratified in June 2004. 
Parliament also approved a USD 40 million loan agreement 
between Ghana and Nigeria to help Ghana fund its 16.3 percent 
equity stake in the West Africa Pipeline Company (WAPCo). 
Both actions were critical for WAPCo to achieve final 
investment decision for the pipeline by the end of November. 
 
7. Parliament also passed the Long Term Savings Bill on 
October 28 and the Venture Capital Bill on November 3. 
President Kufuor and Cabinet Ministers publicly stated that 
these two bills were their top priorities for this session of 
Parliament. 
 
8.  The Venture Capital Bill requires the establishment of a 
Venture Capital Trust Fund, which will make capital 
investments in small and medium scale enterprises and promote 
the development of a venture capital industry in Ghana. The 
GoG intends to finance the Trust Fund using approximately 20 
to 25 percent of National Reconstruction Levy. 
 
9. The Long-term Savings Bill passed allows for the formation 
of tax-deductible savings schemes to serve as a supplementary 
savings for retirements, home ownership and education. 
Employers may also make use of the fund to arrange pension 
funds for employees. 
 
10. Comment:  Minister of Parliament Owusu-Agyapong told Econ 
and Poloffs on October 5 that there was little chance 
Parliament would have time to cover its ambitious workplan. 
This was an abbreviated, last session before the December 7 
elections and Owusu-Agyapong doubted his ability to maintain 
a quorum, with most MPs out on the road campaigning.  That 
Parliament cleared its entire docket is a testament to how 
much it has improved as an institution.  That Owusu-Agyapong 
reoriented the schedule to emphasize the four items of 
interest to the U.S. is an indication of the willingness of 
Ghanaian government entities to cooperate with the U.S.  It 
also is an indication of the strong influence in Parliament 
wielded by the Executive Branch.  End Comment

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, GH, economy 
SUBJECT: GHANA:ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS OCTOBER 1-NOVEMBER 5, 
2004 
 
 
1. This report covers noteworthy economic events and 
activities in Ghana for the period October 1 - November 5, 
2004. The issues covered are: 
 
-- S and P\'s Maintains Ghana\'s B Plus Rating 
-- Ghana\'s Corruption Score Improves 
-- FDI Numbers Also Better 
-- New Legislation to Spur Economy 
-- Gold Bringing in More Green for Ghana 
 
S and P\'s Maintains Ghana\'s B Plus Rating 
----------------------------------------- 
2. Standard and Poor\'s announced on October 23 that it was 
reaffirming its B plus long-term and B short term foreign and 
local currency sovereign credit ratings for Ghana.  The 
outlook continues to be stable.  In September 2003, Ghana was 
the first African country to be rated by Standard and Poor\'s 
under the UNDP\'s sovereign credit rating program.  (Note: 
During late-September meetings with DCM and EconChief, 
Standard and Poor\'s representatives expressed some concerns 
about Ghana\'s fiscal reform program, which has slipped 
somewhat during the 2004 election year.  However, this was 
compensated by HIPC Completion Point in July 2004, which will 
bring Ghana roughly USD 3.5 billion in debt relief from Paris 
Club members and the international financial institutions. 
Post also met with Fitch Rating Agency representatives in 
late September.  Fitch has not yet announced the results of 
its first year review of its 2003 \"B\" rating (with \"positive 
outlook\") for Ghana, although Fitch reps advised EconChief 
that they would likely maintain the current rating.  End 
Note) 
 
Ghana\'s Corruption Score Improves 
--------------------------------- 
3. Transparency International\'s (TI) 2004 Corruption 
Perception Index Report, published in October 2004, has Ghana 
improving slightly from last year.  The 146 countries are 
ranked on a scale of 1 to 10, with scores below 3 indicating 
rampant corruption.  Ghana scored a 3.6 this year, against a 
3.3 last year, and ranks 64th among the 146 surveyed, up from 
its 73 ranking in the 2003 TI report.  Ghana is the 7th least 
corrupt among the 26 African countries included in the survey. 
 
FDI Numbers Also Better 
----------------------- 
4. Ghana recorded USD 88.6 million in foreign direct 
investment last year, an improvement over the USD 65.37 
million in 2002, according to the UNCTAD\'s World Investment 
Report.  The increase has been attributed to an improved 
investment climate and renewed confidence in the Ghanaian 
economy.  Specifically, the service sector recorded 58 
projects worth USD 73.24 million and the manufacturing sector 
registered 42 investments worth USD 21.94 million.  The 
Deputy Chief Executive of the Ghana Investment Promotion 
Center (GIPC) noted that Ghana had not reached its potential 
for attracting FDI or domestic investment.  She also noted 
that the Ministry of Trade and Industry had initiated a 
Technology Improvement Program to facilitate transfer of new 
technologies to private sector operations to increase their 
production capacity and competitiveness. 
 
New Legislation to Spur Economy 
-------------------------------- 
5. At the end of October, Parliament passed the Long-Term 
Savings Scheme Bill, intended to be a framework for the 
development of a retirement oriented long term savings plan 
and to provide a vehicle for employees and employers to 
cooperate in establishing supplementary pension funds. 
Supporters hope that the scheme will not only mobilize 
savings but also generate funds as a source of long-term 
investment capital for the economy.  Parliament also passed 
the Venture Capital Trust Fund bill on November 3.  The 
scheme calls for 87 billion cedis to be used as seed money to 
spur medium and small-scale enterprises (MSE), which make up 
approximately 93 of all businesses in Ghana.  MSEs 
traditionally grapple with high interest rates that make 
increased investment unattractive.  A portion of the national 
reconstruction Levy will fund the Trust Fund. 
 
Gold Bringing in More Green for Ghana 
------------------------------------- 
6. President Kufuor announced in early November that he 
expected Ghana to earn about USD 929 million from gold 
production this year, up from USD 750 million in 2003.  He 
forecasted USD 1 billion in gold earning for 2005, saying the 
mining sector was poised to make significant contributions to 
Ghana\'s Golden Age of Business.  He further noted that the 
GoG wanted to broaden the mining base to include limestone, 
manganese, silica sand, natural gas, clay deposits, iron ore 
and bauxite, and the intention to add value to minerals was 
part of the GoG reasoning behind their purchase of VALCO (see 
septel on VALCO deal).  The GoG has received several large 
dividend payments recently from gold companies resident in 
Ghana, including approximately USD  2.5 million dividend 
payment from Anglogold-Ashanti and approximately USD 3.5 
million from GoldFields.

SUBJECT: USG SUPPORT FOR GHANA\'S DECEMBER 7 ELECTION 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) USG support for the upcoming Ghanaian presidential and 
parliamentary elections includes $1,164,000 in USAID and 
STATE funding for election-related programs. PAS has provided 
$35,000 to support election programs related to the media. 
The final transfer of funds was presented on November 10 with 
Ambassadorial participation in the Electoral Commission\'s 
polling agent training. In conjunction with the broader 
diplomatic community, the Mission plans to send 50 volunteer 
observers into the field on election day. The Mission remains 
actively engaged with representatives from all political 
parties, civil society, and the GoG to encourage peaceful, 
free, and fair elections in 2004. End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
FINANCIAL AND PROGRAM ASSISTANCE UPDATE: USAID 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (U) USAID-Ghana manages $1,164,000 in Economic Support 
Funds (ESF) to support Ghana\'s presidential and parliamentary 
elections this year. The breakdown of this total is as 
follows: 
 
$34,000   Ghana Association of the Blind (for tactile ballot 
use training) 
 
$50,000   Ibis/Ghana (women\'s participation) 
 
$450,000  Election Commission (voter registration support) 
 
$450,000  Center for Democratic Development (domestic 
observation and 25 parliamentary candidate forums) 
 
$180,000  Electoral Commission 
* In conjunction with the Royal Netherlands Embassy, this 
program - launched on November 10 - will train polling agents 
to ensure that agents of political parties, candidates, and 
EC staff receive the same information, understand each 
others\' roles, and avoid conflict and confusion on election 
day. As Ambassador Yates noted in a speech to formally donate 
these funds, \"An effective performance by each agent at the 
polling centers will contribute immensely to enhancing 
transparency of the elections and will increase public 
confidence in the outcomes.\" 
 
3. (U) USAID-Ghana\'s local government/civil society program, 
Government Accountability Improves Trust II (GAIT II), will 
support MP candidate debates in 29 constituencies as part of 
their effort to increase local level civil society engagement 
with the GoG. 
 
4. (U) USAID-Washington is working in conjunction with IFES 
on an Electoral Violence Education and Resolution (EVER) 
project. This is a pilot project that will be run in Ghana 
that examines a number of potentially conflict-prone areas. 
IFES will partner with CDD-Ghana and the Institute for Policy 
Analysis in Tamale to send field monitors to conflict-prone 
areas. The EVER project will identify conditions, causes, 
practices, or failures provoking electoral violence in order 
to prevent, manage, or reduce opportunities for friction in 
elections and campaigns. The project will examine electoral 
conflict as a discrete form of conflict with unique causes 
and solutions, while recognizing that it is linked to broader 
social, economic, or criminal motives. In addition, it will 
diagnose how election observation can be a more effective 
tool in election conflict prevention. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
FINANCIAL AND PROGRAM ASSISTANCE UPDATE: PUBLIC AFFAIRS 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5. (U) The Embassy\'s Public Affairs Section has provided 
$35,000 in election-related support, aimed primarily at media 
programs. The breakdown of this total is as follows: 
 
$10,000   Center for Democratic Development (originally 
slated for presidential debates, this money will be 
reprogrammed for other election-related support if a debate 
does not take place this month) 
 
$10,000   Ghana Journalist\'s Association (issue-specific 
media interactions with political party leaders, focusing on 
issues such as the education, economy, and health) 
 
$15,000   Three media training workshops (held in Accra, 
Takoradi, and Kumasi) to work with journalists on reporting 
in an election year. The focus of these workshops was on 
broadcast journalism and touched on subjects such as polling, 
reporting election results, and covering political rallies. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
FINANCIAL AND PROGRAM ASSISTANCE UPDATE: DHRF 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Two grants awarded from the FY04 Democracy and Human 
Rights Fund also supported projects cultivating a peaceful 
election season and greater awareness of the democratic 
process. These projects and allocations are as follows: 
 
$6,110   Women in Broadcasting (supporting programs to 
highlight female parliamentary candidates) 
 
$5,000   Berekum Civic Union (community-wide program to 
promote political tolerance during elections. Note: The 
Berekum CU is also a beneficiary of USAID-Ghana\'s GAIT II 
program ((see para 2 above)), and will be organizing MP 
debates under this program). 
 
7. (SBU) The Mission\'s support for Ghana\'s elections has been 
widely covered in local press and well-received by most. Some 
representatives from civil society, as well as members of the 
major opposition party, the National Democratic Congress, 
have made comments to PolOffs about the substantial support 
provided to the Center for Democratic Development (CDD). Some 
argue that the CDD leans toward supporting the ruling 
National Patriotic Party (NPP). The Associate Executive 
Director of CDD, Mr. Baffour Agyeman-Duah, told PolOff on 
September 30 said that this allegation has no basis in fact. 
(Note: The criticism of CDD from the major opposition party 
reveals an aspect of Ghana\'s developing democracy - that 
there can be limited tolerance for divergent views at times. 
The Mission believes that CDD-Ghana is struggling to take a 
neutral position, and has tried to address the polarized 
nature of the campaign by trying to persuade all parties to 
focus on the issues at stake and how they will address them.) 
 
----------------------------------------- 
PRE-ELECTION AND ELECTION DAY OBSERVATION 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Embassy officers have met with representatives of 
all the political parties, civil society, the Electoral 
Commission, and fellow members of the diplomatic corps to 
discuss the December 7 election and assess what useful role 
the USG might play. On this issue, the sentiment has been 
nearly unanimous: while international observers are welcome, 
the need for them is seen as far less pressing than it was in 
the 2000 elections. As one EC contact put it to PolChief 
\"Ghana is coming of age electorally\". 
 
9. (U) Furthermore, political contacts seem more concerned 
about gaps in monitoring the pre-election process (e.g., the 
voter registration process and the EC\'s response to 
challenges) than monitoring the actual election.  They do not 
see a significant possibility of rigging on polling day. The 
EC and others point to the fact that the CDD, the Catholic 
Church and others are fielding over 8,000 domestic observers 
in this election (compared to 5,000 in the 2000 election). 
CDD, with support from USAID, has been fielding 50 monitors 
to track pre-election political activities. At the same time 
that domestic observer numbers are rising, international 
observers are decreasing. While foreign missions fielded 
approximately 200 election observers in 2000, the UNDP told 
PolOff on November 5 there will be approximately 175 
international observers for this year\'s election. 
 
10. (U) Almost all of the Embassy\'s political contacts have 
said foreign observers can play a useful role in helping to 
legitimize the election result and lend support to the 
democratic process in Ghana. In addition to extensive 
pre-election regional travel and observation, the Mission 
will send approximately 50 American direct-hire, spouses, and 
FSN observers into the field, in conjunction with the wider 
diplomatic community. Foreign observers have been promised by 
other Missions in Ghana, including the British (40 observers) 
and the Australians/Canadians (20-30), under the coordination 
of the UNDP. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11. (U) The increasing emphasis on domestic observers (as 
opposed to international observers) can be taken as a sign of 
increased confidence in the democratic process here. Domestic 
observers present distinct advantages over international 
observers - they often understand the country and its 
politics better; they have local knowledge; and they can 
speak local languages. The upswing in domestic observers is a 
strong sign of capacity development of the civil society and 
suggests increasing local ownership and engagement in the 
process. International observers remain important in places 
where there are limited or no domestic observers and/or where 
local tensions undermine the country\'s confidence in domestic 
observers. 
 
12. (U) The Mission has played an active role in supporting 
free, fair, and peaceful elections in Ghana this year. USG 
assistance for Ghana\'s elections has been well-received and 
well-publicized. Within the Mission, over 100 personnel have 
expressed great interest in serving as election observers on 
December 7. The Mission believes their involvement builds 
both our public image in Ghana and morale within the Mission 
itself. End comment.

TAGS: PGOV, PINR, GH 
SUBJECT: GHANA PRESIDENT ON COTE D\'IVOIRE 
 
REF: YATES/ARIETTI PHONE CON 11/11/2004 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARY C. YATES FOR REASONS 1.5 (A),(D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  President Kufuor told the Ambassador 
November 11 that he would attend the emergency meeting in 
Abuja on November 14 as part of South African President 
Mbeki\'s diplomatic initiative to address the Cote d\'Ivoirian 
crisis. President Gbagbo will be invited but may or may not 
attend. Kufuor thinks Gbagbo may be more flexible because of 
the changed situation with the French on the ground. Kufuor 
believes President Gbagbo should still implement Linas 
Marcoussis agreement and that Gbagbo must force his 
parliament to act. He opined that all current key Ivoirian 
leaders should not be allowed to run for election and that 
new leaders should be given a chance. The killing of the 
French military gave the French the \"pretext\" to take actions 
protecting their citizens and their businesses, but Kufuor 
was not critical of the French.  End Summary 
 
2.  (S)  Ambassador met with Ghanaian President John A. 
Kufuor, along with CJA, Chief of African Division,for 40 
minutes on November 11. The ambassador used the opportunity 
to query the president about the current deteriorating 
situation in Cote d\'Ivoire and possible regional initiatives 
to address the crisis.(Subject of Reftelcon) Kufuor first 
spoke at some length about the generic insecurity problems in 
West Africa and the destabilization of outside mercenary 
forces. Specifically, Kufuor said that in connection with 
South African President Mbeki\'s current diplomatic 
initiative, that he had just been invited by President 
Obasango to a meeting in Abuja scheduled for a two hour 
duration at the airport on Sunday, November 14 and that he 
would attend. He was aware that President Mbeki of South 
Africa, President Wade, and probably the presidents of 
Burkina Faso and Mali would attend.  President Gbagbo would 
be invited and be urged to attend, but Kufuor was not fully 
confident Gbagbo would attend. (Subsequent press reports 
report Libya\'s Khadafi will also be invited.) It was not 
clear whether other Ivoirian leaders would be invited to this 
meeting, but Kufuor said he understood that Ouattara and Soro 
may not have travelled to South Africa to meet with Mbeki 
11/11 as previously planned. 
 
3  (C) When asked what hope was held for this diplomatic 
initiative after Gbagbo\'s failure to advance Accra III 
promises, President Kufuor said Gbagbo was in a more 
difficult and insecure situation because of recent events 
which might make him more receptive to a diplomatic 
initiative than he was during Accra III. He said Gbagbo must 
take \"the bull by the horns\" and stop using the parliament as 
an excuse. He must tell the parliament they have to pass the 
legislation which implements the Linas Marcoussis agreement 
and moves the election calendar forward for all parties. He 
must lead, said Kufuor. Kufuor also opined that the entry of 
French had changed the situation since the Accra III talks, 
and should also change Gbagbo\'s stance. 
 
4. (C) On the political scene, Kufuor repeated several times 
that it was a \"freak\" that Gbagbo had ended up as the 
President of Cote d\'Ivoire since he had always just been a 
minor opposition leader even during President 
Houphouet-Boigny\'s time.  Since Gbagbo did not represent 
either of the two major parties in the country during any 
normal election, he should never have ended up with the 
position. Since happenstance gave Gbagbo this position, 
instead of trying to cling on to power, Gbagbo should 
contemplate his leadership of an entire nation and his 
legacy. Kufuor said emphatically and repeatedly that all 
current leaders in Cote d\'Ivoire (Gbagbo, Ouattara, Bedie, 
and Soro) must give way to new, younger leaders in their 
parties. None of them should be allowed to run in the 
election because none of them can unify and lead the entire 
nation. 
 
5. (C)  On the French intervention, Kufuor said that the 
killing of the French soldiers by the Cote d\'Ivorian military 
gave the French the \"pretext\" they needed to move in and 
protect their citizens and their businesses. Kufuor was not 
critical of the French and quite realistic about their 
current role as contributing to the stability both of their 
citizens, other foreigners and the French and international 
businesses. He even suggested they could play a constructive 
role in getting CI through the next free and fair national 
election, but needed to know when to leave so not to be seen 
as a occupying force. 
 
6. (C)  Comment:  Despite Kufuor\'s reference to Gbagbo as his 
brother, there was clear frustration at Gbagbo\'s lack of 
comprehension of the seriousness of his situation, and 
inability to provide the nation leadership. The Ambassador 
thanked Kufuor for taking time out of his final weeks of 
campaigning to go to Abuja this Sunday. (The president is 
currently on the campaign trail in the interior about five 
out of seven days.)  Kufuor admitted that after all the 
efforts at Accra III, he just felt he had to step back and 
take care of his own country. He seemed relieved that 
President Mbeki had stepped in to play a leadership role.

1.  Per reftel, Emboff met with the head of the political 
department at MFA.  GOG officials assured him that Ghana 
would not object if there were to be a flood of Ivorian 
refugees entering Ghana.  Large numbers could cause 
logistical problems, but the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) 
had the lead on this issue.  In a separate conversation, an 
official at the MOI said that Ghana would maintain its \"open 
door\" policy toward refugees.  The MOI had already 
identified three potential sites near the Ivorian border 
that could be used to house large numbers of refugees 
temporarily. 
 
2.  Partly to assess the situation near the border, Ref 
Coord visited the Krisan refugee camp, located 30 miles east 
of the Ivorian frontier, on November 9.  At that point there 
had been no new admissions of Ivorian refugees.  Thanks to 
active U.S. and Australian resettlement programs, total 
refugee population there had declined from a peak of 3,800 
to less than 1,000, including 500 Togolese, 300 Liberians, 
180 Sudanese, and a smattering of seven other nationalities, 
none of them numbering more than 35.  There was no longer 
any full-time NGO presence at the camp, although a UN 
volunteer continued to provide medical services at the 
clinic. 
 
3.  UNHCR Resettlement Officer Peter Trotter told Ref Coord 
today that 14 busloads of third country nationals had 
entered Ghana from Cote d\'Ivoire over the past week.  Mainly 
Malians and Burkinabes, the passengers were all expected to 
proceed to their countries of origin to wait out the 
cessation of hostilities.  Ironically, somewhere between 
1,500 and 5,000 Ivorians had fled into Nimba County, 
Liberia, where many Liberians who had formerly taken refuge 
in Cote d\'Ivoire now resided.  Trotter confirmed that UNHCR 
had worked with the GOG on a contingency plan, but noted 
that in 2001 they had planned for up to 120,000 Ivorian 
refugees; the actual number of arrivals ended up being only 
120. 
 
4.  Post will continue to keep addressees apprised of any 
significant movement of refugees.

1.  (U)  During a brief overnight visit to Accra on November 
11, U.S. Senator James Inhofe met with Ghanaian President 
John Kufuor and held a private evening meeting.   Embassy 
officers met the Senator at the airport and made 
transportation, hotel and scheduling arrangements. 
 
2.  (C)  The Ambassador, DCM and PolChief accompanied Senator 
Inhofe and two of his staffers in a meeting with President 
Kufuor at the Castle (the President\'s office).  Senator 
Inhoffe greeted President Kufuor warmly, noting he was a good 
friend of the President and had visited Africa four times 
over the past year.  The focus of this trip was two-fold:  1) 
discuss the possible formation of five &regional brigades8 
in Africa, identified by the African Union, which would train 
for counter-terrorism activity, and 2) discuss Gulf of Guinea 
oil issues, with a particular interest in stemming the 
diversion of oil and oil revenues to criminals and 
terrorists. 
 
3.  (C)  Kufuor noted that West Africa was grappling with its 
own security challenges.  The Government of Ghana  believes 
Ghana has significant oil potential, President Kufuor 
remarked,  hoping that the U.S. would help in oil exploration 
in Ghana.  He repeated this request at the end of the 
meeting, saying &we should be talking about oil a lot in the 
next year.8  He said he would want to make more use of 
businessman and presidential confidant Kwabena Darko as a 
point man on oil and economic issues. (Note: Darko was in the 
room and helped in organizing this meeting for Senator 
Inhofe.  Owner of Ghana,s largest chicken business, he 
appears to be a trusted presidential aide on a range of 
issues.  End note.) 
4.  (C)  The Senator said he expected we would be interested 
in assisting Ghana in oil exploration.  He invited President 
Kufuor to the National Prayer Breakfast in the U.S. in 
February, 2005.  The President was noncommittal, saying he 
would have to see if he was reelected.

SUBJECT: INL FUNDING BOOSTS GHANA\'S COUNTER-NARCOTICS 
CAPACITY 
 
REF: ACCRA 02138 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. Using INL funding totalling nearly $80,000, DOJ/ICITAP 
contractors conducted a four-week counter-narcotics training 
in Accra for officers from the Ghana Narcotics Control Board 
(NCB), Ghana Police Service (GPS), Ghana Immigration Service 
(GIS), the Customs and Excise Protective Service (CEPS), and 
the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA). The 
train-the-trainer program, conducted in two 2-week sessions, 
finished on November 12 and was declared a highly successful 
training by both USG and GoG officials. The launch of the 
training on October 18, attended by the DCM, received 
extensive press coverage. While the training was in progress, 
a high-profile narcotics case was prosecuted (see reftel) and 
another drug bust was made at the airport with the assistance 
of INL-funded equipment. End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
COMBATTING DRUG SMUGGLING AT PORTS AND BORDERS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. On October 18, the DCM launched a four-week, INL-funded 
counter-narcotics training, led by DOJ/ICITAP contractors 
Larry Ringler and Robert Clarke. The Chief Director from the 
Ministry of Interior, Mr. Edwin Barnes, also addressed the 
trainees and press members covering the launch. Later, in a 
private (closed to press) classroom address to the officers, 
the Chief Director urged the officers to work together to 
combat the problem of narcotics in Ghana and to set aside 
occasional inter-agency differences that may arise. He 
stressed the need for the Ghanaian law enforcement agencies 
not to let divisions over funding and resources encroach on 
the overall goal of eliminating the smuggling of illicit 
narcotics in and through Ghana. 
 
3. The training took place in two 2-week sessions. The first 
session, consisting of mid- to senior-level officers of the 
NCB, CEPS, GIS, CEPS and GCAA was a \'train-the-trainers\' 
program in which participants were taught how to transfer 
skills and knowledge to junior officers of their respective 
agencies. The second phase of the training, conducted from 
November 1-12, was a basic skills course and consisted of 
junior level officers. Students from the first iteration of 
the program co-taught the basic skills training with the two 
ICITAP coordinators. Both trainings consisted of classroom 
lectures, practical exercises, and field visits to the 
airport. 
 
4. This training, which focused specifically on drug 
interdiction at Ghana\'s airport (and, secondarily, seaports), 
complements material assistance provided last year under the 
same contract. In 2003, the USG donated two itemizers worth 
$80,000 to the NCB to be used for drug detection efforts at 
Kotoka International Airport. In October 2004, the Executive 
Secretary of the NCB, Col. Isaac Akuoko, told PolOff that the 
 
SIPDIS 
itemizers had helped to capture another potential drug 
smuggler transiting through the airport. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. The ICITAP trainers, the NCB (which served as the lead GoG 
agency for coordinating the training), and the training 
participants all regarded this program as highly successful. 
In an outbrief with Ambassador Yates, Mr. Ringler and Mr. 
Clarke advocated further support for Ghana\'s law enforcement 
agencies, noting that the political will for combatting 
narcotics in Ghana is strong and that law enforcement 
officers display enthusiasm and motivation for this mission 
in spite of a fundamental lack of human and material 
resources. The trainers also noted that the Ghanaians 
expressed interest in a canine drug detection course. Further 
courses in basic skills training, airport operations, and 
drug interdiction could also be useful in Ghana. The 
prosecution of Ghana\'s largest drug bust and the October 
interception of narcotics using USG-funded equipment, both of 
which took place during the period of this successful 
training, indicate the continued positive impact of INL 
funding in Ghana. End comment.

SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT OF GHANA\'S MIXED RESPONSE TO WESTERN 
WIRELESS INTERNATIONAL\'S ARBITRATION FILING 
 
REF: ACCRA 01980 
 
1. (SBU) Summary. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has responded 
to Western Wireless International\'s (WWI) filing for 
international arbitration under UNCITRAL rules (reftel).  The 
MoJ claims that WWI is restricted by contract to settling 
disputes with the GoG in Ghanaian courts under Ghanaian law 
and therefore, the GoG will not submit to international 
arbitration.  WWI counters that it has the right to file and 
it will pursue the case regardless of GoG participation.  A 
contradictory statement from the National Communications 
Authority (NCA) on November 22, however, states it will 
respond to Westel\'s desire for arbitration. End Summary. 
 
THE MOJ\'S RESPONSE 
------------------ 
2. (SBU) A letter from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to WWI 
dated November 4, says that Westel\'s License Agreement with 
the GoG requires any arbitration be carried out under the 
Ghana Investment Promotion Act (GIPC) of 1994.  The letter 
states that Westel\'s primary investor, WWI, is therefore also 
bound by the agreement.  The letter concludes by saying the 
MoJ will not submit to UNCITRAL arbitration out of respect 
for the terms of the License Agreement.  WWI\'s response on 
November 12 asserts that WWI and Westel are legally separate 
entities and that WWI, not Westel, filed for arbitration.  In 
addition, WWI quotes portions of the GIPC, which appear to 
give direct investors like WWI the express right to file for 
arbitration under UNCITRAL rules. 
 
MIXED MESSAGE FROM THE NCA 
-------------------------- 
3. (SBU) Westel\'s managing director Bill Taylor told EconOff 
WWI would go forward with the arbitration process regardless 
of GoG participation.  He feels the MoJ\'s refusal to 
participate in arbitration is either a delaying tactic or an 
attempt to call WWI\'s bluff. In response, Westel made its 
case directly to the public November 16 with a full-page 
explanation of its position in Ghana\'s two most prominent 
newspapers: The Ghana Times and Daily Graphic.  The NCA, 
which the bulk of WWI\'s complaint is directed against, 
responded on behalf of the GoG November 22 with similar 
advertisements in both papers.  Both parties stick to their 
previously stated positions (reftel) and neither appears to 
provide room for reconciliation.  In contrast to the MoJ\'s 
letter, the NCA\'s response concludes \"Though it was the wish 
of the NCA to have had a speedy resolution of this matter 
without resorting to the courts or other legal processes, the 
NCA has no choice than to respond to Westel\'s desire for 
arbitration.\" 
 
CHANCE FOR A SETTLEMENT 
----------------------- 
4. (SBU) Bill Taylor says he spoke with Minister of 
Communications Kan-Dapaah --who\'s Ministry nominally controls 
the NCA- at a recent public event and both men expressed the 
hope that a settlement could be reached.  Taylor explained 
Westel would drop its case if the GoG would rescind either 
the USD 25 million penalty or USD 27.5 million spectrum fee 
(reftel).  Kan-Dapaah has not responded formally, but that is 
no surprise with December\'s elections looming. 
 
COMMENT- POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF ARBITRATION 
--------------------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) In Post\'s view the filing for arbitration under 
UNCITRAL rules is a desirable outcome.  Whether the GoG 
eventually decides to participate in the arbitration process 
or not, WWI will go forward.  In any event it is the proper 
venue for the settlement of international investment 
disputes.  If the GoG does not participate they risk a 
considerable adverse award.  WWI is seeking USD 190 million, 
but admits confidentially an award of USD 60 million is more 
likely.  Regardless of the amount, if the GoG refuses to pay 
the consequences could be dire:  Section 527 of the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act mandates that the USG cutoff all 
foreign aid and vote against IFI loans if a country fails to 
pay an arbitration award within 3 years.  It is unlikely the 
GoG would take such a risk for a case that could be settled 
safely out of court after the elections.  Post is concerned 
that the GoG appears to be replaying past mistakes--similar 
efforts were made in an attempt to avoid arbitration over 
VALCO--and will raise our concern with GoG officials. End 
Comment.

SUBJECT: IMF READOUT ON GHANA\'S ECONOMY 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) The IMF has raised 2004 growth estimates for Ghana 
to 5.5 percent.  Inflation should stay at 11-13 percent and 
the balance of payments improved in 2004 due to large cocoa 
exports, donor aid flows and record remittances.  There is 
concern on the fiscal side, with wages and fuel subsidies 
over target and the discovery of \"unidentified\" expenditures 
of over two percent of GDP.  The Bank of Ghana (BoG) 
acknowledges Ghana may need a waiver on expenditures.  The 
IMF still expects petroleum deregulation by February 15, 
2005.  It did not object to the GoG\'s plan to borrow from the 
Nigerian government and Barclays bank to finance the West 
Africa Gas Pipeline, and sent a team to advise the GoG on 
accessing capital markets.  End Summary 
 
IMF\'s Positive Readout of Macroeconomy 
-------------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) IMF Mission Chief Sam Itam positively assessed 
Ghana\'s economy during an October 29 outbrief for donors on 
the October staff review of Ghana\'s Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Facility (PRGF).  The IMF revised 2004 real GDP growth 
up to 5.5 percent, due mainly to larger than expected cocoa 
exports.  While inflation will remain between 11 and 13 
percent -- missing the single digit target -- Itam was 
satisfied with the BoG\'s monetary policies, which have 
succeeded in maintaining price and exchange rate stability. 
 
3. (SBU) The external side is improved, with higher than 
expected export revenues ) mainly cocoa and gold ) record 
level remittance flows (projected at USD 1.4 billion) and 
donor disbursements on time.  The main area of concern is the 
fiscal side.  Although tax revenues were better than 
anticipated and most expenditures are within targets, 
petroleum subsidies may reach USD 200 million, almost double 
the target, and GoG wages will exceed the agreed limit. 
Also, the IMF discovered a huge discrepancy in the draft 2004 
budget accounts totaling over 2 percent of GDP or about 2.2 
trillion cedis (roughly USD 250 million).  Itam referred to 
the discrepancy as \"unidentified expenditures\" and said the 
GoG would recalculate budget figures. 
 
4. (SBU) The BoG disputes the IMF\'s figures, blaming errors 
in methodology.  Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, BoG Governor Paul 
Acquah\'s top advisor, headed up the GoG review of the budget. 
 He told EconChief November 12 that the GoG\'s recalculation 
showed no discrepancy.  He passed the new data to the IMF and 
will travel to Washington in December to resolve the 
differences.  Nevertheless, Bawumia admitted the GoG will 
miss expenditure targets and may need a waiver for the third 
review of the PRGF in April/May 2005. 
 
Petroleum Sector Deregulation ) A HUGE CHALLENGE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
5. (SBU) The IMF has not backed off its insistence on 
petroleum sector deregulation by February 15, despite signs 
that the GoG commitment to the deregulation may be faltering. 
 Itam assured donor reps that the GoG had reiterated its 
commitment to implement a new petroleum pricing regime that 
would incorporate market forces and ensure full cost recovery 
(and end subsidies).  Nevertheless, Finance Minister Osafo 
Maafo cautioned Itam that a large adjustment could spark 
tensions.  (Note: BoG contacts estimate that deregulation 
will result in a 50 percent rise in the price of gasoline. 
End Note) 
 
6. (SBU) Itam reiterated to Osafo Maafo that he expected 
Ghana to stick to the February 15 deadline, but also invited 
the GoG to submit concerns and counterproposals in writing. 
The Danish representative at the IMF outbrief related that 
Osafo Maafo told his Ambassador on October 28 that the IMF 
had agreed on a \"transition phase.\"  Itam said there had been 
no such agreement, but several donors commented that the GoG 
seemed to be setting the stage for a delay, which could delay 
IMF conclusion of the third review.  Donors involved in the 
Multi Donor Budget Support group warned that their 
disbursements were tied to IMF and World Bank disbursements. 
IMF/WB funding delays could provoke a damaging cascade effect 
on GoG finances. 
 
Funding for West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) 
------------------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) Surprisingly, the IMF did not inquire about the 
GoG\'s plans for funding its 16.3 percent share in the WAGP. 
Itam did not appear concerned that Ghana plans to borrow the 
necessary USD 80 to 90 million from the Government of Nigeria 
(USD 40 million) and Barclay\'s bank (the remainder).  GoG 
Energy Minister Paa Kwesi Nduom recently announced that the 
Nigerian loan was zero interest payable over 5 years.  These 
terms would not breach the PRGF ban on non-concessional 
lending, but it seems unlikely that Barclay\'s would loan on 
concessional terms.  Nduom has stated to the press that the 
Barclays loan is a temporary bridge loan and the GoG is 
seeking financing from the French Development Agency (AFD), 
the World Bank and the European Investment Bank to replace 
it. 
 
IMF Technical Assistance on Capital Markets 
------------------------------------------- 
8. (SBU) GoG officials\' desire to access world capital 
markets, now that Ghana has achieved HIPC completion point, 
is well known and cause for concern among some donors.  Itam 
surprised donor reps during the outbrief stating that he had 
agreed to the Finance Minister\'s request for technical 
assistance in this area.  He reassured that the IMF would not 
compromise the debt sustainability attained via HIPC, but 
commented that GoG officials have good arguments for 
borrowing internationally. 
 
9. (SBU) GoG officials point out that they have insufficient 
resources to achieve the millennium development goals.  They 
also make the \"signal and effect\" argument that international 
borrowing will send the message that Ghana has a viable 
economy.  Finally, Itam pointed out that the capital markets 
are already coming to Ghana with proposals for international 
loans.  Itam said the IMF would pursue this carefully, and 
would only consider supporting essential projects that would 
lead to higher growth, employment and improved 
infrastructure.  He noted also that skeptical donors should 
consider it a good sign that the GoG was asking for IMF 
guidance rather than pursuing more questionable opportunities 
such as the notorious \"IFC loan\" and \"China loan.\"  (Note: 
An IMF team arrived around November 21 to hold discussions on 
this topic.  End Note) 
 
Comment 
------- 
10. (SBU) When asked to comment on the IMF\'s plan to provide 
technical assistance, donor reps ) including Econ and USAID 
officers -- unanimously panned the idea.  Most were concerned 
the GoG would misuse the funds and end up back in the Paris 
Club.  Econ Chief suggested that the IMF might want to 
differentiate between country bonds to raise general revenue 
and financing that is project specific and collateralized. 
The latter, which could include funding for energy, telecom, 
water and other infrastructure projects, may make sense to 
support. 
 
11. (SBU) Post is not alone in doubting the GoG\'s ability to 
deregulate the energy sector a mere two months after 
elections.  President Kufuor will likely make cabinet 
changes, including to the key Finance and Energy ministries, 
making the February deadline even less attainable.  It is 
unclear how the IMF would respond to another delay, and the 
possible negative consequences of funding delays are a real 
concern.  End Comment

SUBJECT: GHANA\'S 2004 ELECTION: THE VOLATILE NORTHERN REGION 
 
 
Classified By: PolChief Scott Ticknor for reasons 1.5 d and e. 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  The Northern Region of Ghana has a long 
history of conflict revolving primarily around ethnic, 
chieftaincy, and land disputes.  In this pre-election period, 
intense party rivalries, tensions between claimants to the 
Dagomba tribal throne, and an apparent abundance of arms 
further poison the atmosphere, especially in Tamale and Yendi 
District.  Incidents of violence can flare up at any time 
over the most trivial of issues. Nonetheless, there are some 
positive signs, and officials and civil society activists 
have begun peace-building efforts.  The Electoral Commission 
appears to be effective and well-regarded.  Regional 
authorities are bolstering security for the election and 
there has been no election-related violence in the north in 
the past month.  If security is adequately tight and the 
parties act responsibly, the Northern Region has a good 
chance of having peaceful elections.  The National Democratic 
Convention (NDC) is expected to do well in the northern 
region, especially in Tamale, in part because many perceive 
the rival NPP as ineffective in investigating, and possibly 
complicit in, the 2002 murder of the Ya Na (Andani chief) and 
40 supporters.  In the coming weeks before December 7, we 
will closely monitor the Northern Region, especially the 
Tamale Municipal Assembly and Yendi District.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  In a November 8-10 visit to Tamale and Yendi in 
Ghana\'s Northern region, PolChief and Pol FSN met with 
officials, civil society members, and party representatives 
to assess the atmosphere in Ghana\'s most volatile region 
prior to the December 7 presidential and parliamentary 
elections. 
 
--------------- 
A Fragile Peace 
--------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Northern region has been peaceful since October, 
2004 and was quiet during PolChief\'s visit.  A two-year state 
of emergency in the region was lifted in August, 2004. 
However, all of our interlocutors described the current 
situation in Tamale Municipal Assembly and Yendi District as 
highly volatile, capable of sparking into violence at any 
time with little provocation.  (Note: The rest of the region 
is not particularly volatile. End note.)  Northern Regional 
Police Commander Ephraim Brakatua opined that the \"fragile 
peace\" in Tamale and Yendi could break down any moment, 
highlighting chieftaincy and party tensions. He largely 
attributed the prevailing peace to a government decision to 
ban public political rallies, following the October death of 
a 14-year-old boy in a shooting in Tamale (see below).  The 
District Chief Executive of Yendi and the Director of the 
Northern region Electoral Commission are concerned about 
clashes around (especially on) election day, but were 
confident that security measures would be adequate to prevent 
problems. 
 
-------------------- 
The Roots of Tension 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Our contacts highlighted the following main factors 
contributing to the current state of pre-election tension in 
Tamale and Yendi: 
 
A Long History of Conflict:  The Northern region has a 
centuries-old, complex history of ethnic conflict, mixing 
historical grievances with poverty, and disputes over 
chieftaincy and land.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, the 
Dagomba and other tribes with chiefs enslaved and extorted 
the more numerous Konkomba and other chiefless tribes in the 
north.  British colonial rulers favored and used the Dagombas 
to undermine the chiefless tribes.  After Independence, 
Ghanaian leaders continued to support chiefly groups in their 
land and other claims over leaderless groups, further 
exacerbating ethnic friction in the north.  Since 1980 there 
have been 17 ethnic-based conflicts in the Northern region, 
including the 1994 \"Guinea Fowl War\" between the chiefly 
Dagombas/Nanumbas/Gonjas tribes and the Konkombas, which left 
an estimated 20,000 dead. 
 
The Murder of the Ya Na:  The tensions have taken a new 
dimension in recent years, with intra-Dagomba conflict 
between Abudu and Andani \"gates\" (descendant lines), 
following the 2002 murder of the Andani gate supreme chief, 
the Ya Na, and 40 others, in Yendi.  The brutality of this 
killing (the Ya Na was dismembered), failure to arrest anyone 
in this case and broad suspicions (although no reported 
evidence) of government complicity make this unresolved case 
immensely polarizing in the Northern region.  The regional 
Chairman of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) admitted 
that this one issue made the NPP campaign in Northern region 
difficult. 
 
Party Rivalries:  All parties seek to manipulate ethnic 
tensions for political gain.  It was clear in meetings with 
NPP, National Democratic Congress (NDC), and Convention 
People\'s Party (CPP) leaders in Tamale and Yendi that they 
intensely dislike and distrust each other.  Abudus side with 
the NPP (Ghana\'s Vice President, with the NPP, is Abudu); 
Andanis clearly side with the NDC (NDC vice presidential 
candidate Mumuni is Andani).  The parties clashed in Tamale 
in April.  In Yendi on October 2, verbal taunting between NPP 
and NDC supporters led to the destruction of several stores. 
 
Distrust of Government Authority:  The NDC is convinced the 
police are biased toward the NPP and are being directed from 
Accra to look the other way on cases involving NPP 
supporters.  The NDC is outraged by the Minister of 
Interior\'s recent statement that, if conditions are too tense 
for elections in the northern region, \"Ghana can move on 
without Dagbon.\" The NPP Chairman told us bluntly \"the 
security forces are not doing a good job\", claiming they 
detain many innocent people and fail to stop incidents of 
violence.  Perceptions of impunity in the Ya Na killing 
(including alleged complicity by the Yendi District Chief 
Executive), and the government\'s imposed ban on party rallies 
have also undermined faith in government authorities and 
exacerbated insecurity in the region.  Both the NDC and NPP 
see Tamale as tense and unsafe, and agree that the rule of 
law had broken down in parts of the city.  The Police 
Commander of Yendi confided that, because he had made enemies 
in Accra, he felt he was sent to Yendi to get shot. 
 
Abundant Arms:  Most of our contacts agreed the Northern 
region is awash in guns.  Many are home-made guns and small 
arms, although there are also reportedly some automatic 
weapons.  When asked about this, police in the region said 
they have heard about large arms staches but have so far been 
unable to find many weapons.  (Police Commander said he had 
uncovered only 18 illegal weapons since September).  The 
availability of arms has contributed to recent tensions.  On 
September 16, a business dispute at the Tamale abattoir led 
to a gun fight between butchers, with three injuries.  On 
October 9, a 14-year old boy, who was wearing an NDC campaign 
cap (and returning from an NDC rally), was killed by a bullet 
reportedly fired by a guard at the house of an NPP activist. 
(According to our sources, the NPP activist was a builder 
whose house had been torched and vandalized in the past.  All 
of our contacts believed the boy was hit by a stray bullet 
from guards seeking to protect the building, probably without 
a political motive).  The police found weapons in the house, 
including an AK-47.  Both the NDC and NPP admitted to us that 
they had groups of armed youths standing by to \"defend\" their 
party interests. 
 
Lifting the Ban on Rallies, Phone-Ins:  On November 12, the 
Northern Region Security Council lifted a ban on the 
transmission by Tamale radio stations of political 
discussions and phone-in programs.  The ban was imposed as a 
security precaution following the October killing of the 
14-year-old.  On November 17, the Council also lifted its ban 
on outdoor political activities, imposed for the same reason. 
 According to press accounts, the parties pledged to keep the 
peace, while the Council prohibited firearms at political 
rallies and limited rallies to no later than 5 pm.  It is not 
clear whether the Council\'s decision to lift the bans will 
improve the security environment.  While many in civil 
society opposed the bans because they were undemocratic and 
told us they were urging them to be lifted, officials and 
party activists were very cautious about a possible lifting 
fo the ban on public rallies.  The Police Commander said the 
ban on rallies had helped keep the peace and was unsure 
whether lifting the ban would lead to new flare-ups.  Several 
contacts thought there was no need to lift the ban because 
rallies were ineffective in northern region, given the 
polarized tribal nature of voting.  NDC contacts believe the 
NPP wants to lift the ban to enable Vice President Mahama to 
hold public rallies in northern region (NDC presidential 
candidate John Atta Mills was unable to do so in a recent 
visit to the area because of the ban).  Both the NDC and NPP 
insisted that the ban was imposed on them by the Council but 
that, at this point, they would oppose lifting the ban for 
security reasons. 
 
Some Positive Developments 
-------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Against this backdrop of tension are some more 
positive signs. 
 
Peace-building Efforts:  The police, government and civil 
society are working to encourage peace among the region\'s 
rivaling communities.  The Bishop of Yendi and NGO leaders 
are talking peace in meetings with Abudu and Andani youth and 
women.  The District Commissioner and Police Commander of 
Yendi meets with youth groups, Muslim leaders, and the 
political parties to encourage community harmony.  The Police 
Commander noted a UNDP-supported peace workshop in which 
youths, chiefs, and political and religious leaders pledged 
to resolve conflicts peacefully.  The government formed a 
Northern Region Peace Advisory Council which, with UNDP 
support, is working to bring different stakeholders together. 
 Youth groups in Tamale reportedly want to hold a peace rally 
in the coming weeks. 
 
Expectations of Free, Fair Election:  All of our contacts, 
including the rival parties, were convinced that the upcoming 
election will be free and fair in Northern region, and gave 
high marks to the region\'s Electoral Commission (EC).   The 
regional EC Director told PolChief he had put in place all 
possible measures for free and fair elections (although some 
may try to cheat, he admitted) and the EC had \"done 
everything possible\" to register voters.  He noted that 
around 95 percent of voters in the region had registered and 
that he hoped the EC would allow use of party poll books as a 
backup to the register on election day (all the parties told 
us they would support this as a means to ensure maximum 
possible enfranchisement). 
 
Strong Security Presence:  While recognizing that violence 
could spark at any time, most contacts on the trip were 
optimistic the election would be peaceful if there is a 
robust security presence in Tamale and Yendi.  There has been 
no election-related violence in the past month, even after 
the decision to lift the ban on political rallies.  The 
police also reassured us that election observers would be 
safe in the region.  The regional Police Commander has a 
force of 648 policemen, augmented by 200 police on rotation 
from other regions of the country, and staff from the 
Customs, Prison and Fire services.  He hopes for 300 more 
police reinforcements for the election.  The District Chief 
Executive of Yendi told us he has one military company on 
hand (the military in the region remain in their barracks on 
election day unless needed for a security incident) and is 
also seeking police reinforcements.  Both areas will deploy 
roving patrols of armed police. 
 
NDC Likely to Do Well 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  In the 2000 election, the NDC won 19 of 24 
parliamentary seats (the NPP won 3, and the PNC party won 2 
constituencies).  In a 2001 by-election, the NPP gained an 
additional two seats.  We expect the NDC to do at least as 
well in Northern Region this election.  This year, the NDC 
will benefit from discontent with the NPP over the Ya Na\'s 
murder, and for the first time, the NDC running mate is from 
the north.  The NDC is expected to do well in Tamale, while 
the NPP should do well in Yendi.  The NPP told us it hopes to 
win 13-14 out of 26 total seats (there are two new 
constituencies in the region), pointing to its development 
performance and the advantages of incumbency.  Nonetheless, 
they concede that because of the Ya Na murder, many CPP and 
PNC supporters will vote NDC.  The NDC believes it will win 
20 seats. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  On the surface, Tamale and Yendi feel like poor, 
sleepy towns. They are well-traveled by Embassy officers. 
The Ambassador had a successful visit to Tamale in September, 
launching a new \"American Corner\" library/computer center. 
PAS recently successfully programmed a basketball team in 
Tamale, USAID has been traveling to Tamale for election 
training, and the Peace Corps has 18 volunteers in Northern 
Region and a sub-office in Tamale -- all of which have been 
operating without incident.  A number of international NGOs 
operate in Tamale, given the greater poverty levels in the 
north. 
 
8.  (C)  If the security presence is strong and the political 
parties exercise restraint, the elections will probably go 
off in Northern region without violence.  There was no 
violence in the region during the 2000 election.  However, 
below the surface, there is  significant anxiety in the north 
in this pre-election period.  The parties talk in 
surprisingly dramatic fashion about possible violence.  For 
example, the regional NPP Chairman mentioned rumors that 
Andanis would seek to \"slaughter\" NPP activists on the eve of 
the election.  There is a great deal at stake for Abudus and 
Andanis in particular, especially given the Abudu/Andani 
divide of the NPP and NDC vice presidential candidates. 
Observers will be watching for several possible tripwires in 
the coming two weeks:  will the lifting of the ban on public 
rallies lead to violence?  Will Ghana\'s Vice President or 
President visit the Northern region, as some expect?  Will 
Andanis move to bury the Ya Na before the election, which 
some told us is possible?  These could all further poison the 
atmosphere before the election.  It does not take much to 
trigger violence in Tamale and Yendi and we will watch 
developments in the whole Northern Region closely during this 
potentially volatile election period.

MCA PLANNING 
 
REF: A. STATE 237954 
 
     B. STATE 239160 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Finance Minister Osafo Maafo gave an 
optimistic appraisal of Ghana\'s planning for the Millennium 
Challenge Act (MCA) during a November 22 meeting with 
Ambassador Yates.  In response to concerns raised by the 
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Osafo Maafo 
reconfigured Ghana\'s MCA working group.  The current GoG 
proposal focuses on agri-business, and Osafo Maafo predicted 
his team would submit its draft to the MCC by January 2005. 
The GoG\'s core MCA team now includes several private sector 
representatives and will deepen consultations with civil 
society over December.  The GoG\'s objective is to use MCA 
funds to create a world-class agricultural sector in Ghana. 
End Summary 
 
2. (SBU) Ambassador, USAID Country Director and EconChief met 
November 22 with Finance Minister Yaw Osafo Maafo and key 
advisors to congratulate the Minister in person on Ghana\'s 
inclusion among the 16 eligible countries for the second 
round of MCA funding (Note:  Post delivered Ref A points via 
letter November 10).  The Ambassador noted that several other 
countries were moving forward more rapidly in the process, 
even engaging in early due diligence discussions with the 
MCC.  The Ambassador also commented that while Ghana was 
under no set timeline it would be useful to determine a 
realistic timeline for Ghana to complete its draft compact. 
The Ambassador also asked for an update on how the 
consultation process was progressing, an area of concern 
during the MCC visit in August. 
 
3. (SBU) Osafo Maafo acknowledged that Ghana\'s early concept 
paper was unfocused -- \"a maze of projects\" -- and the 
consultation process inadequate.  However, he argued that he 
started broadly on purpose.  By using the economic priorities 
of the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy as a starting point, 
he achieved buy-in from other Cabinet members.  Starting with 
a more specific concept would have been \"political suicide.\" 
This created a situation where all Cabinet members were vying 
for inclusion of their own pet projects, and the initial 
draft concept paper reflected that. 
 
4. (SBU) Osafo Maafo claimed he won President Kufuor\'s 
support to include non-government representatives on the MCA 
core working group to give credibility to his Ministry\'s 
efforts to focus Ghana\'s concept paper.  (Note: Osafo Maafo 
added business sector representatives to the core team and 
also invited USAID-funded Sigma One Corporation to serve as 
an unofficial advisor to the core team, filling in 
information gaps and serving as a sounding board on key 
issues.  End Note)  The reconfigured core team eliminated 
many of the competing projects and eventually settled on 
agri-business as the prime focus of Ghana\'s MCA compact. 
 
5. (SBU) Osafo Maafo subsequently elaborated in writing on 
his decision to revamp his MCA team (November 23 letter and 
proposal development schedule faxed to MCC).  In his letter 
he states that his intent was to address the issues the MCC 
team raised in August:  1) the initial concept paper was 
unfocused; 2) the process to develop the proposal appeared so 
far to be heavily government driven; and 3) the GoG needed to 
deepen the consultative process.  The restructured and 
private sector-driven core MCA team addressed these concerns 
by expanding consultations with stakeholders, which resulted 
in the selection of agri-business as the proposal focus. 
Osafo Maafo promises to continue with a robust consultation 
schedule to assist the GoG to continue to narrow down the 
proposal. 
 
6. (SBU) The basis for the agri-business focus is that Ghana 
is rare in that a huge percentage -- 85 to 90 percent -- of 
its land is arable.  Osafo Maafo stated the idea was to take 
advantage of this \"natural endowment\" by removing constraints 
to the sector and opening up agricultural areas to 
investment.  He said the GoG\'s objective was to use MCA funds 
to \"promote private sector-led growth through agri-business,\" 
with the end-goal to position Ghana as a world-class 
agricultural-based economy.  He did not want to lose focus of 
the goal of poverty reduction, commenting that MCA funds 
would mostly be used in non-cocoa growing regions, which are 
already benefiting from huge cocoa crops and relatively high 
world cocoa prices. 
 
7. (SBU) Osafo Maafo and Michael Ansah, who heads the GoG\'s 
core MCA team, both indicated that they understood that 
programs to promote the agricultural sector should 
concentrate on removing constraints rather than providing 
direct government supports to private and/or government-owned 
agriculture operations.  As an example Osafo Maafo noted that 
wholly inadequate infrastructure is the main constraint 
facing the Affraim Plains region - which should be a 
\"bread-basket\" for Ghana and is thus a likely selection for 
MCA funding.  Ansah stated that the GoG plans to use a 
\"franchise approach,\" taking the same methodology they 
develop for the MCA proposal and applying it to develop other 
agricultural areas in Ghana -- such as in the northern region. 
 
8. (SBU) Now that they have a focused program, the core team 
is working to complete an \"initial draft proposal,\" which 
they will use in further consultations with civil society. 
The outcome of the consultations should be a more complete 
proposal, which Ansah hopes to submit to the MCC in late 
December.  Osafo Maafo agreed that January is the more likely 
time frame. 
 
9. (SBU) Comment:  While Osafo Maafo insists that the MCA is 
still the most important recent development for Ghana\'s 
economy, the GoG effort to complete a compact clearly lost 
focus in the September-November period.  The main reason is 
that Osafo Maafo and other principle Ministry of Finance and 
GoG officials are fully occupied with the upcoming 
Presidential and Parliamentary elections (on December 7).  It 
is only recently that the core team has made progress, 
primarily because in early November project leader Michael 
Ansah moved from London to Ghana to manage the process 
through completion.  Post is reassured that Ghana will 
develop a more effective, growth-based, private sector-driven 
proposal under his more dynamic leadership   End Comment.

SUBJECT: BASKETBALL CLINICS HELD IN MUSLIM NORTHERN GHANA 
 
1. Summary.  Post, in coordination with the Department\'s 
CultureConnect Program, organized two days of basketball 
clinics for 40 girls in the predominantly-Muslim Northern 
Region of Ghana on November 12-13, 2004.  Cultural Envoys 
and former Georgetown University basketball players, 
Courtland Freeman and Omari J. Faulkner, along with Senior 
Adviser and Special Coordinator for Cultural Programs, Brian 
J. Sexton, conducted the clinics for girls, aged 7-18. 
Twenty-five to 30 percent of girls in the north drop out of 
school by age 13 to get married or have children, and an 
ongoing basketball program in the north is one incentive for 
them to continue their education.  The clinics were covered 
by the national press, and were praised by government 
officials and parents alike for focusing attention on needs 
of the north.  The program forged another link in post\'s 
outreach to Muslim audiences in Ghana. End Summary. 
 
2. Post and the Makarigu Female Basketball Academy, a local 
non-governmental organization, hosted the two days of 
clinics at a secondary school\'s outdoor basketball courts in 
Tamale, capital of the Northern Region.  Mr. Freeman 
supervised basketball clinics for 20 girls, aged 10-18, 
while Mr. Faulkner coached 20 younger girls, aged 7-9.  The 
clinics culminated with a formal awards ceremony and dinner 
at a local hotel, honoring each girl and her parents, 
members of the Basketball Academy and local coaches.  About 
80 people attended the ceremony, in which the girls were 
awarded certificates, given autographed photos of the 
Cultural Envoys and had their pictures taken while holding 
their certificates and flanked by the Envoys, Special 
Coordinator and Embassy staff.  November 13 marked the end 
of Ramadan in Ghana and therefore, Muslims were able to join 
in the celebratory dinner that evening. 
 
3.  Reaction to the two-day event was phenomenal.  The 
program was covered by national television stations, Ghana 
Broadcasting Corporation and TV3, by the nationally- 
circulated Ghanaian Times newspaper, as well as by four 
local FM radio stations (Radio Savannah, Radio Filla, Radio 
Justice, and Diamond FM).  The Envoys and Special 
Coordinator met with the Minister of Works and Housing and 
Member of Parliament from the Northern Region, Mustafa Idris 
Ali, who said the idea of using basketball to encourage 
young girls to remain in school has the full backing of the 
Ghanaian government.  A cab driver with no formal education 
said he was very proud of his two daughters for attending 
school and participating in the clinics.  He said that 
through them, he had interacted with Americans for the first 
time, and was honored as a guest for dinner at the hotel, a 
place he had passed by many times, but never stopped. 
Another father said he had watched the U.S. women\'s 
basketball team compete at the Olympic games in Athens last 
summer and wondered when Ghanaian girls would be playing 
basketball; he said it was a dream to see his 8-year-old 
daughter playing basketball for the first time. 
 
4. Several girls said that before the Basketball Academy 
began operations November 6, 2004 they went to school late 
and had little interest in their studies.  Now that the 
Academy has been organized (practice sessions are held three 
times a week, including two days after school), the local 
coaches report that many girls arrive at school early in the 
morning, hoping to play basketball before classes begin. 
Under the Academy\'s rules, girls are allowed to play 
basketball only if their teachers verify they are attending 
class; once a girl is truant, she is dropped from the 
Academy.  The Basketball Academy is currently training 20 
girls, aged 7-9 years of age, from 10 schools in Tamale and 
the surrounding villages.  Thirty-five percent of the 
Academy trainees are Muslim.  The Academy hopes to expand 
the program if more funding is available; nearly 40 other 
girls who applied to join are on a waiting list. 
 
5.  Post appreciates the support provided by R, AF-PD and 
ECA in organizing and funding these basketball clinics, 
which were very successful and raised post\'s profile among 
Muslim groups in the Northern Region of Ghana.  Post also 
appreciates the additional help provided by Embassy- 
Ouagadougou, especially PAO Haskell, GSO McCarthy and 
expediter Zoungrana, for their assistance in facilitating 
travel by the visitors in Burkina Faso and to Niger, and in 
arranging the group\'s lodging in Ouagadougou.

The new security directors feel obliged to take my life,

This is their method of directing security for the President. 
 I need to be resettled for safety,s sake, following failed

Arrangements to assassinate me in my home came from within 
the offices of the Ivorian presidency, an assassination 
planned by high-ranking persons responsible for presidential 
security. 
 
The Facts 
----------- 
 
During the early morning hours of Wednesday, June 2, 2004, I 
was not expecting anything unusual, but my life was saved 
only by the grace of God after armed killers of the Republic 
descended upon my residence.  I should note first that I have 
faithfully served the state since the era of Feliz Houphoet 
Boigny, Bedie, Guei and now Gbagbo, as part of the GSPR 
(Group for the Safety of the Presidency of the Republic), the 
official and legal security unit created in 1996.  I spent my 
military career without the least reproach from my superiors 
as an assiduous soldier who was respectful of constitutional 
law. 
 
For the alleged good of the new Republic of Cote d,Ivoire, 
several &security8 units were created by some individuals 
with special interests, leading to chronic insecurity at all 
levels of Ivorian society.  The government created a unit 
parallel to the GSPR that fell under the authority of certain 
high-level GSPR officers, including Lieutenant Colonel 
Nathanael Ahouman B.  This group was charged with carrying 
out clandestine missions ordered by Gbagbo, his wife, and the 
leaders of the FPI.  This parallel unit that did not 
officially exist would take control of the GSPR and initiated 
my attempted assassination. 
 
About two in the morning on June 2, five men in military 
uniform, armed with Kalashnikovs and assault rifles, wearing 
black clothes bearing the GSPR emblem, broke into the kitchen 
of my residence as if they were professionals.  They then 
climbed the staircase and cornered my youngest son.  The 
intruders warned the child to keep silent and to respond to 
their questions. 
 
The Guerrilla: Where is your father? 
The Child: He is not here; he is away on a mission. 
 
This response so irritated them that one in the group raised 
his voice and yelled, &You are lying!  We were told that he 
is in the house.8 
 
Oddly, during the morning of June 1, I had received a phone 
call from Koula Doh, a Sergeant Major with the police force, 
who asked about my location.  Yet Doh had no friendship with 
me, which I found intriguing. 
 
After this question, they led the child into the hall and 
shoved him against the wall.  With difficulty the child said, 
&I told you he is on a mission,8 and asked, &Did you see 
his car here?8  The absence of the car seemed to confound 
them. 
 
Angrily, the killers questioned each other about the mission 
in these terms:  &But why did he not verify this and ask us 
to come?8  This admission revealed the truth about who 
orchestrated the murders in Abidjan and who executed them. 
 
Other examples of recent killings include: 
 
      -     The murder of: General Guei, whose torturers 
still form part of the President,s 
            close security unit. 
      -    The assassination of the Captain Dosso 
(Aide-de-camp of ADO (Ouattara)) 
-     The assassination of the Fabien Captain and the family 
of General Guei 
-     The assassination of Mr. Coulibaly Herve 
-     Owners of the Mercedes 600 (sold today in Ghana) and of 
the 4X4 Cherokee of ADO to the palace (used by karate expert 
Bai Patrice) 
-     Wholesale slaughter of the protesters of 25-26 March, 
2004. 
 
The intruders then made the child show them my room.  When my 
wife heard the cries of the child and moved toward the door, 
a guerrilla was waiting with a weapon pointed toward her. 
She was thrown into the hall near the two other guerrillas 
posted in the corridor.  There, she was told to explain her 
husband,s &mission,8 while fearing the worst for herself 
and her children.  She courageously kept silent and prayed to 
God that nothing worse would happen. 
 
Hand-to-hand Combat 
--------------------------- 
 
I awoke at the sound of violence in the hallway and, rather 
than taking the time to deploy my weapon, I resolved to 
engage in hand-to-hand combat.  Seeing the silhouette of the 
first killer entering the room, I managed to punch him in the 
face and knock him to the floor behind the two others.  This 
attack occurred during the night, which the organizers wanted 
because there would be no witnesses.  In the course of this 
struggle, the largest guerrilla lost his left little finger 
and stayed behind so that the others could attack.  This 
combat on the second floor of my house continued into the 
living room, as we tumbled down the staircase.  One of the 
first guerrillas to regain his footing seized his P.A. and 
ordered me to lie down so that he could shoot me.  I answered 
that I would prefer to die on my feet. 
 
At this moment, the idea came to me to make him believe that 
I had reinforcements.  I shouted, &Wait!  Don,t kill me!8 
When the guerrilla diverted his glance, I gave his arm a 
kick.  The weapon flew from his hand and landed not far from 
the one who was missing a finger; he seized his weapon and 
fired in my direction.  The bullet merely grazed my scalp. 
Believing I had been injured, they looked for a light switch. 
 I bounded upstairs to my room, where I had time to arm 
myself and fire a burst.  When they heard the noise, my 
killers fled, saying, &He has a gun.8 
 
After this scene I received threatening phone calls.  For my 
safety, I had to change phones, but the person who kept my 
old phone number continued to receive threats such as, &You 
think you have won, but it is not over.  Next time you will 
not be allowed to leave.8 The call came from a cellular 
phone box located at Yopougon Toits Rouge, in the district 
where I lived before moving to Cocody. 
 
Following this incident, several questions arose concerning 
our brother soldiers who are of the same ethnic group as the 
current President.  The current mantle of power is exercising 
ethnic favoritism among government positions.  However, this 
policy is based on intimidation, subjugation, the &purchase 
of consciences,8 and the elimination of those thought to 
constitute an embarrassment to Laurent Gbagbo.  Such moral 
failings were decried in 1990 upon the advent of multiparty 
democracy in Cote d,Ivoire, but massive human rights 
violations, particularly kidnappings, increased.  (For 
example, the last attempt to kill Mr. Bedie at his residence 
at Daoukro, during the first vacation President Gbagbo took 
in Yamoussoukro, where the MIG 24 launched toward his home 
failed because the government did not have the support of 
ground troops, which an officer of the GSPR had ordered). 
 
I refused to participate in this act, because it was one of 
Ahouman,s ideas. 
 
Such are the intrigues of President Laurent Gbagbo,s 
entourage, which now imperil the Republic with the assistance 
of death squads that are well known to certain secret Ivorian 
units.

ELECTIONS 
 
Classified By: PolChief Scott Ticknor for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  The stage is set for a substantially free, fair, and 
peaceful election on December 7. All political parties have 
publicly and privately committed themselves to promoting 
transparent and violence-free elections. Although the 
Electoral Commission has not managed its budget well, they 
seem on track with distributing ballot papers and other 
materials necessary for Election Day. Ghanaians have 
benefitted from lively discussion and debate on television 
and radio, in workshops and debates. On November 17, Ghana 
saw its second-ever presidential debate.  Although the ruling 
party was absent, the opposition parties discussed a wide 
variety of topics. The volatile Northern region has remained 
generally calm. Ghana\'s security agencies also seem 
well-organized and mobilized to monitor events on Election 
Day. End summary. 
 
------------- 
LIVELY DEBATE 
------------- 
 
2. (U)  Campaign 2004 has been marked by lively discussion 
and debate. Parliamentary candidates have participated in 
local debates throughout the country. Television and radio 
shows have saturated Ghanaians with call-ins and programs 
about the election. PAS has sponsored a series of party 
discussions on different election topics. On November 17, the 
Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) hosted Ghana\'s 
second-ever presidential debate in front of a national 
television and radio audience. 
 
3. (U) The debate included National Democratic Congress (NDC) 
candidate John Atta Mills, the Convention Peoples Party 
(CPP)\'s George Aggudey, and People\'s National Convention 
(PNC) flag bearer Edward Mahama. (The NPP did not 
participate). Questions focused on the economy, good 
governance, and social sector issues. 
 
4. (U) The economy: Mahama said the PNC would take Ghana out 
of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program, boost 
educational and agricultural subsidies, lower fuel prices, 
and improve the efficiency of public sector enterprises. 
Aggudey of the CPP argued that Ghana should stop \"begging\" 
and improve self-sufficiency. Atta Mills of the NDC conceded 
that \"we can\'t wish away Bretton Woods institutions\" but 
argued Ghana should seek more leverage in the implementation 
of IFI programs. Ghana would have to increase fuel prices 
because of world price hikes, he said, although he hoped the 
rise could be moderated by cuts in fuel taxes. He argued for 
greater diversification of exports and industries and lower 
interest rates. 
 
5. (U) Good Governance:  All participants said they would 
fight corruption. Mahama said the PNC would enact a conflict 
of interest law and separate the portfolios of the Attorney 
General and Minister of Justice. He would protect whistle 
blowers and improve the work environment for judges. Aggudey 
(CPP) thought Ghana had sufficient institutions to crack down 
on corruption (although they need strengthening). He would 
reinstate the criminal libel law because of abuses by the 
media. Atta Mills acknowledged the NPP had done some good 
work and the NDC would build on this, not scrap everything 
which came before it. 
 
6. (U) Social Sector:  the PNC and CPP candidates argued for 
free education for all. Atta Mills (NDC) supported free 
primary education for all and improvements to polytechnical 
instutions, stressing the NDC\'s committment to \"social 
democracy\". The PNC candidate highlighted the need to improve 
health care and health insurance. The NDC candidate said jobs 
and youth programs were a priority. Aggudey of the CPP made 
headlines by noting the need to bring more women into 
government to \"bring comfort\" to his administration. All the 
participants were cautious about the pending domestic 
violence bill, favoring traditional ways of handling marital 
rape and domestic violence. The PNC and CPP candidates called 
for prosecuting the killers of the Ya Na (the Dagbon Chief 
murdered in 2002 in Yendi, Northern Region). 
 
--------------------------- 
GENERALLY CALM IN THE NORTH 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (U) The political atmosphere in the Northern Region, the 
region considered most likely to encounter election-related 
violence in the lead-up to December 7, has remained calm. The 
regional authority recently lifted a ban on public rallies 
and call-in radio programs (Note: Although not legally 
binding, the \"ban\" was essentially a warning to radio 
stations not to encourage inflammatory rhetoric on their 
programs; the \"lifting\" was a signal that the government and 
media were working together. End note).  President Kufuor, 
Vice President Mahama, and NDC leaders Atta Mills and JJ 
Rawlings have all visited and addressed public rallies in the 
Northern Region over the past few weeks. 
 
8.  (SBU) While addressing supporters in Tamale, the capital 
of the Northern Region, President Kufuor announced that the 
government supports a burial for the Ya-Na early after the 
elections (Note: the Ya-Na has yet to be buried because the 
Andanis and Abudus, the \"gates\" of the Dagbon tribe, disagree 
about who should take over the chieftancy. End note).  He 
also paid an unexpected stop in Yendi, which helped calm the 
atmosphere in the area. The parties appear to recognize the 
importance of peaceful elections and are exercising 
restraint. Active outreach by civil society and security 
personnel to encourage peace has also been effective. 
 
9. (U) There were only two security incidents over the past 
week. On November 28, two people sustained gunshot wounds 
during a rally featuring Rawlings and NDC vice presidential 
candidate Alhaji Mohammed Mumuni in Tamale. It is not clear 
who fired the weapon. The incident in Tamale followed an 
incident, also involving Rawling\'s convoy earlier in the week 
in Bongo, Upper East region. Mr. Clement Apikiya, the 
District Chief Executive (DCE) of Bongo (near the regional 
capital of Bolgatanga), reported a case of assault by one of 
Rawling\'s bodyguards as Mr. Apikiya tried to drive through an 
area where Rawlings\' convoy had stopped. Local press 
initially reported the incident as an assault on the DCE by 
Rawlings himself, but the DCE later released a press 
statement clarifying his report. Investigations concerning 
the incident are ongoing. 
 
------------------------------------- 
THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION ON LOGISTICS 
------------------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) The Electoral Commission (EC) continues to train 
domestic and international election observers, distribute 
ballot papers and indelible ink throughout the country, and 
has released its final register to the political parties. 
Complaints about the EC\'s handling of the voter register have 
quieted down in the past two weeks.  In response to concerns 
about poor turnout at the exhibition of the register, the EC 
has decided to accept voters who have valid voter ID cards 
and are on the poll book, a separate, more complete list than 
the register.  Representatives of the EC have repeatedly told 
PolOffs that the register and all other logistics are in good 
order for December 7. 
 
11. (C) On budget matters, however, the EC has not performed 
well. At a meeting with international donor partners in early 
November, the Deputy Commissioner of the EC said that if 
their budget did not have enough to sustain a run-off 
election, it would \"go knocking on the door of the Finance 
Minister and ask for more money.\" At another donor meeting on 
November 30, the EC flatly admitted that it had not kept 
track of its incoming donor funds and its expenses and 
requested that donors provide the EC with the amounts they 
have donated and into which accounts. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12. (C)  Ghana has shown it merits its democratic credentials 
in preparation for this election.  The Electoral Commission 
had some difficulties with delays and the massive task of 
creating a new register with photos for 10 million voters. 
Despite these problems and its budget issues, we give the EC 
high marks for impartiality and it will likely pull off this 
election without too many hitches. The run-up to the election 
has been peaceful, with a few exceptions. Ghana\'s security 
agencies have created a National Election Task Force and have 
taken active measures to ensure election day is peaceful. 
Opposition parties have criticized the NPP for abusing 
incumbency, especially in the use of the media. A recent 
study by the Center for Democracy and Governance also argues 
that the NPP has had more access to the media than other 
parties.  The NPP has been more aggressive in spreading 
patronage before this election.  Nonetheless, opposition 
parties have also received widespread media coverage and have 
been actively campaigning in all parts of the country. 
 
13. (C) For the most part, campaign rhetoric and debates have 
been civil.  Civil society groups have organized peace 
marches, prayers for peace, election education campaigns, and 
candidate debates, and are fielding around 10,000 domestic 
observers. While there will undoubtedly be reports of 
irregularities (and post will have 30 teams of observers 
deployed on polling day to watch the process, along with 
around 100 other foreign observers), the stage is set for 
substantially free and fair elections on December 7. The 
election should also be generally peaceful, with the possible 
exception of Tamale in the Northern District, and the 
ethnically and politically volatile town of Bawku in Upper 
East.  End comment.

TAGS: GH, PGOV, PHUM 
SUBJECT: GHANA ELECTION ANALYSIS: NPP LIKELY TO WIN 
 
 
Classified By: PolChief Scott Ticknor for reasons 1.5 d and e. 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  The ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) is 
likely to win Ghana\'s December 7 parliamentary and 
presidential election.  The NPP is well-positioned in its 
traditional strongholds, the heavily populated Ashanti and 
Eastern regions (with 67 combined constituencies out of a 
total of 230.)  The NPP is spending heavily and highlights 
its record of peace and economic growth.  The main opposition 
party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), is strong in 
the Volta, Northern, Upper West and Upper East regions, which 
together have 58 constituencies.  Greater Accra, Brong Ahafo, 
Central and Western regions are close races, reportedly with 
large numbers of undecided voters.  The NDC is focusing on 
the alleged poor performance of the NPP government, but is 
handicapped by poor finances and a legacy of human rights 
abuses.  The election outcome will reflect a mix of 
ethnicity, performance, personality, and other variables. 
End summary. 
 
NPP Strongholds 
--------------- 
 
2.  (C)  The Ashanti region, with 39 parliamentary 
constituencies, is President Kufuor\'s home territory and the 
NPP heartland.  The NPP was founded in Ashanti and won 80 
percent of presidential votes in the 2000 run-off election. 
The party has been actively spreading money, food and other 
resources around the region to cement its support, while 
highlighting its performance in the area over the past four 
years.  Nonetheless, the NPP is unlikely to do as well as in 
2000.  The NDC will probably make small inroads, capitalizing 
on areas of discontent about government performance and 
support from pockets of non-Ashantis living in the region. 
The Eastern region, with 28 constituencies, is also a 
traditional NPP stronghold.  Five out of 19 Cabinet officials 
come from Eastern region, including the Finance and Foreign 
Ministers. 
 
 
NDC\'s Base in the North and East 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  The NDC\'s traditional vote bank has been in the 
Volta region (22 constituencies), where it won 89 percent of 
the presidential vote in 2000.  The hostile reception 
President Kufuor received while campaigning in Volta region 
suggests this largely Ewe area, home to former President JJ 
Rawlings, still strongly distrusts the Ashanti-dominated NPP. 
 
4.  (C)  The NDC should also win in the Northern region (26 
constituencies), as well as the Upper West (10 seats) and 
Upper East (13 seats).  The NDC won narrowly in the Northern 
region in 2000.  However, perceptions of NPP complicity in 
and/or slowness to seek justice for, the 2002 murder of the 
Ya Na (the Dagbon Andani Chief) will likely hurt the NPP in 
this election, even with the recent, conciliatory visit to 
the area by President Kufuor.  Strong NPP candidates and 
inroads by other parties could slightly erode the NDC\'s hold 
on the Upper East, which tipped strongly in the NDC\'s favor 
in 2000. 
 
Four Swing Regions 
------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  The Greater Accra (27 constituencies), Brong Ahafo 
(24), Central (19) and Western (22) regions are more 
difficult to call, with large number of reportedly undecided 
voters and a mixed historical voting record. In Greater 
Accra, the NPP won massively in 2000 but lost in 1996. 
Economic hardships in this predominantly urban area could 
hurt the NPP. 
 
6.  (C)  In Central region, the NPP won decisively in 2000 
and is confident that high cocoa prices and public works in 
the region will bring a repeat victory.  However, the NDC has 
been campaigning hard in this region, presidential candidate 
Atta Mills\' home turf. 
 
7.  (C)  The NPP won 62 percent of the presidential ballots 
in Western region in 2000, with a more even match in 
parliamentary seats.  The NPP appears better organized in the 
region and is spending heavily to repeat their victory. 
While anti-incumbency sentiment could reduce the NPP\'s 
winning margin in the presidential race, it is likely to gain 
some parliamentary seats. 
 
8.  (C)  Brong Ahafo has traditionally been split between the 
NDC and NPP.  The NPP should do well in cocoa and timber 
areas, while the NDC should win in areas with settlers from 
other regions.  The NPP has been spending heavily in this 
region and hopes its 60 percent win in the 2000 presidential 
race will be repeated. 
 
The Big Picture 
--------------- 
 
9.  (C)  The NDC campaign has been slow to build momentum. 
Its vice presidential candidate was knocked out of 
campaigning after being seriously injured in a car accident. 
However, the party has recently energized a door-to-door 
campaign, stressing Kufuor\'s alleged failure to fulfill 
promises.  The NDC has a solid network of party workers but 
its finances are tight, and many voters are reportedly 
uncomfortable with the human rights and economic legacy of 
former PNDC president JJ Rawlings.  Fears about the NDC may 
be reinforced by the final report of the National 
Reconciliation Commission (parts of which were leaked to the 
media), linking Rawlings to the 1982 murder of three High 
Court judges and a retired army officer. 
 
10.  (C)  The NPP has the benefits and handicaps of 
incumbency.  It is better organized and financed, has greater 
access to the media, and has been aggressive at strategically 
distributing money, goods, and projects for electoral gain. 
However, it has suffered from internal squabbles and faces 
criticism about some unfulfilled promises.  According to a 
nationwide opinion poll conducted in June, 2004 by the 
National Commission for Civic Education, the top voter 
concerns (in rank order) are:  educational standards, access 
to affordable health care, the high cost of living, and 
unemployment.  Despite macroeconomic achievements the NPP has 
highlighted in campaign ads, many of our contacts believe 
most Ghanaians do not feel economically better off than four 
years ago.  These voters may still vote NPP, our contacts 
concede, because they are not ready to go back to NDC rule. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (C)  While there are no opinion polls, campaign 2004 
appears to be a competitive match between the NDC (which 
currently has 89 parliamentary seats) and the NPP (with 103 
seats).  At play are a mix of ethnicity, performance, 
personality, legacy, and other factors.  The NPP enjoys an 
overwhelming advantage in distributing resources and using 
the benefits of incumbency.  It also benefits from the fears 
still conjured by the NDC.  One Ghanaian told PolChief she 
was switching her vote from NDC to NPP out of disgust for 
Rawlings\' recent alleged assault on a District Chief 
Executive in Upper East. 
 
12.  (C)  We believe the NPP will do well in both the 
parliamentary and presidential elections.  The NPP is likely 
to win a first round victory in the presidential race (it 
needs to win 50 percent of votes, plus one ballot, to prevent 
a second round run-off).  In 2000, the polling went to a 
second round because five small parties garnered a combined 7 
percent of the popular vote, leaving the NDC with 44.5 
percent and the NPP with 48.1 percent of the total tally. 
This year, only two small parties are competing with the NDC 
and NPP and neither has gained much traction in the 
presidential race.  The Convention Peoples Party (CPP) could 
gain several parliamentary seats (it currently has one), 
while the People\'s National Convention party (PNC) is 
unlikely to improve on its current three seats.

E.O. 12958:  N/A 
TAGS: KPAO, PREL, GH 
SUBJECT:  MUSLIM OUTREACH - WRAP UP OF RAMADAN EVENTS 
 
1.  (U) Summary.  U.S. Mission Accra sponsored a series of 
events during the recent Islamic holy month of Ramadan.  The 
Ramadan program began with an Iftaar dinner hosted by 
Ambassador Mary Carlin Yates, attended by the Vice President 
of Ghana and all of the major Muslim leadership figures in 
Accra.  Emboffs hosted separate Iftaars in Accra for the 
leadership of the various sects.  The Embassy organized a 
number of food donations in underprivileged majority Muslim 
neighborhoods in Accra, nearby Tema and in Kumasi.  Soccer 
tournaments for Muslim youth were held in Accra and Kumasi, 
as well as an Iftaar for Muslim religious leaders and chiefs 
of the Ashanti region, attended by the Regional Minister. 
The Deputy Chief of Mission and other embassy officers made 
courtesy calls on senior Muslim leaders during the course of 
the month, and presented book donations to Muslim-run 
schools in poor neighborhoods.  The Muslim community greeted 
these events enthusiastically and saw to it that they 
received wide media coverage.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U) Ambassador Yates\'s Iftaar dinner on October 25 
brought together the heads of each of the major Islamic 
sects in Ghana, itself an uncommon occurrence, along with 
the Mission\'s Muslim contacts in government and academia. 
Ghana Vice President Aliu Mahama, joined the Imams at the 
Ambassador\'s head table and gave an impromptu speech to the 
guests, stressing the importance of America\'s friendship 
with Ghanaian Muslims.  The Ambassador used the event to 
announce the awarding of a Department of Defense grant to 
fund an office building for Accra\'s Islamic Education Unit, 
an agency responsible for integrating traditional religious 
schools into Ghana\'s secular system.  Ambassador Yates, in 
welcoming remarks, also reviewed the Mission\'s Muslim 
outreach activities over the past year and outlined plans 
for the coming year.  The Public Affairs Officer traveled to 
Kumasi, Ghana\'s second city, with a large Muslim population, 
to represent the embassy at another Iftaar celebration, 
attended by the Ashanti region Islamic leaders, Muslim 
chiefs and the top government official, the Regional 
Minister. 
 
3.  (U) The embassy sponsored major food donations to poor 
communities in Accra and Kumasi that were organized with 
religious leaders and Muslim chiefs at ceremonies attended 
by the DCM and other mission officers.  Another donation was 
co-sponsored with the students association at the Islamic 
University, near Accra.  The food was distributed through 
mosques in neighborhoods of Accra, Tema and Kumasi.  The DCM 
used the Accra event to let the audiences know that 
Americans were aware of the importance of Ramadan, with 
particular emphasis being put on care for the less fortunate 
members of society during the holy month.  Post hopes to 
follow up with a food donation to Muslims in Tamale. 
 
4.  (U)  With Eid el Fitr marking the end of Ramadan, the 
embassy, working with Muslim NGOs, sponsored a soccer 
tournament for Muslim youth from the greater Accra municipal 
area.  Sixteen teams participated to play for a trophy and 
prizes.  A similar soccer tournament was held for teams in 
Kumasi.  The DCM kicked off the ball for the final match and 
awarded the prizes.  Parliamentarians, local government 
officials and Ministry of Sports officials attended the 
games.  These leaders expressed their appreciation for the 
embassy\'s contribution to positive activities for young 
people, many of whom are from the poorest and least 
developed urban areas in and around Ghana\'s capital city. 
 
5.  (U)  On a less public scale, embassy officers reinforced 
their contacts with Muslim leaders through a series of 
courtesy calls during the course of the month of Ramadan. 
These informal get-togethers permit post officers to learn 
about the concerns of the Muslim community and to express to 
the leadership American attitudes of religious tolerance and 
interest in seeing Muslims participate in the development of 
their country.  These included calls on the National Chief 
Imam and the Chief of the Zongo community in Kumasi.  In 
some instances, the Public Affairs Section accompanied the 
visits with book donations to schools affiliated with the 
various Muslim sects. 
 
6.  (U)  Ramadan is the logical time to intensify Mission 
cooperation with the Muslim community of Ghana, but post 
hopes to organize other activities throughout the year.  For 
example, as occurred last year, the embassy will sponsor a 
radio and TV quiz program for Muslim tertiary students, with 
prizes to the school of the winning team.  At the next major 
Muslim holiday, Eid el Adha, in January, the Mission will 
make the traditional presentation of a ram to the National 
Chief Imam.  At this time, post also expects to organize 
similar events in Tamale, the main city in Ghana\'s Northern 
Region, which has a large Muslim population.  PolChief was 
one of only three diplomats attending the national 
conference to launch Ramadan, which was positively received 
by the Muslim community.  Media coverage of these events has 
been quite good and public awareness of post\'s efforts at 
outreach to Ghana\'s Muslims is at a high level.  The embassy 
is regularly being contacted by Muslim organizations, 
including some of the most conservative, to learn more about 
how they can participate in these programs. 
 
7.  (SBU) Comment:  While it is difficult to quantify the 
impact of these programs, anecdotally post has had responses 
from Muslim leaders indicating that they much appreciate the 
Mission\'s outreach, which they view as exhibiting our 
country\'s respect for their religion and their local 
institutions.  In some instances, fundamentalist Imams with 
negative and suspicious attitudes toward the United States 
have softened their language and sought to learn more about 
American policies and values.  This has been evidenced by 
reports of \"before and after\" preaching before congregations 
and by invitations to visit mosques extended to Emboffs. 
Recently, the bimonthly magazine published by the largest 
conservative sect included an article on the role of 
religion in the U.S. elections and a feature article with a 
photo of post PAO speaking to the group\'s leadership on the 
importance of education for Muslim youth.  These 
interactions, and there are numerous similar examples of 
effectiveness, often reflect the personal relationships that 
a number of post officers have developed with Ghana\'s Muslim 
leaders.  They also reinforce the notion that in a 
traditional culture there typically is no better way to 
cement bonds than by dedicating many hours to face-to-face 
discussions, on a small and personal scale.  End comment.

in Ghana.  RSO invited members to a meeting of the Overseas 
Security Advisory Council (OSAC) on December 1 to discuss 
these issues in detail.  EconChief encouraged Amcham members 
to document and report specific cases of corruption to the 
Economic section. 
 
Fitch and Standard and Poor\'s Reaffirm Ghana Ratings 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
3. FitchRatings and Standard and Poor\'s (SP\'s) issued the 
results of their annual reviews of Ghana\'s sovereign credit 
ratings, with both reaffirming their original ratings 
assigned in August/September 2003.  SP\'s announced its rating 
of B plus/stable/B for long and short-term foreign and local 
currency ratings, citing a \"relatively stable political 
environment, strong external liquidity, underpinned by 
current account surpluses and healthy reserves, and moderate 
net public external debt and debt service payments.\"  Fitch 
retained long-term foreign and local currency ratings of \"B\" 
with a Positive Outlook, citing the Kufuor administration\'s 
commitment to macro stabilization and reform. 
 
4. Fitch\'s statement explains that completion of the December 
elections without policy-induced macroeconomic instability 
and significant external debt relief through the HIPC 
framework are factors that could translate the positive 
outlook into a ratings upgrade.  SP\'s cautioned that weak 
fiscal flexibility and expenditure management, high general 
(domestic) government debt, and low level of economic 
development were concerns.  Fitch also notes that soaring oil 
prices had increased Ghana\'s trade deficit and were putting 
mounting pressure on GoG finances due to its refusal to 
eliminate or reduce price subsidies. 
 
World Bank Approves West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) Project 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
5. The World Bank Board of Directors announced November 23 
that it had approved USD 125 million in guarantees for the 
WAGP project.  The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 
(MIGA) will provide USD 75 million political risk insurance 
to guarantee 90 percent of Ghana\'s USD 83 million equity 
investment.  The International Development Association (IDA) 
is providing a USD 50 million partial risk guarantee, 
ensuring Ghana\'s gas purchase payments.  The World Bank\'s 
11/23 press release calls WAGP a \"flagship project\" in the 
push to accelerate ECOWAS economic integration, complements 
the West African Power Pool (WAPP) project, and is a NEPAD 
action plan.  The press release also emphasizes that WAGP 
will \"provide cheap, efficient, and environmentally friendly 
fuel to the consuming countries, which will lower the cost of 
power in these countries and improve the competitiveness of 
goods and services.\" 
 
President Kufuor Opens Coca-Cola\'s New Line 
------------------------------------------- 
6. On November 16 the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Ghana 
Limited\'s (TCCBCGL) celebrated the opening of its new 48,000 
bottle per hour line in Accra.  President Kufuor personally 
presided over the ceremonies, pressing the button to start 
the USD 9 million investment.  Kufuor also praised Coco-Cola 
for its USD 1.7 million investment in water treatment 
facilities for its plants in Accra and Kumasi.  The 
Ambassador and executives from Coca-Cola\'s West Africa team 
also attended.  Company engineers told EconOff they worked 
through the night to ensure the fully automated equipment 
would start without a hitch. 
 
7. Since the company was privatized in 1995, TCCBCGL has 
invested USD 82 million in Ghana.  Its production has grown 
from 3 million cases to more than 18 million and it is 
estimated the company has created, directly and indirectly, 
about 30,000 jobs.  This latest line increases TCCBCGL 
production by almost 20 percent and comes only two years 
after the installation of a similar line in Accra.  EconOff 
observed uncommonly high employee morale and dedication to 
TCCBCGL\'s GM Segun Ogunsanya.  Employees credited Ogunsanya 
with blending training, incentives, delegation and a sense of 
community to create a company atmosphere that is unique in 
Ghana. 
 
Political Parties\' Economic Platforms 
------------------------------------- 
8. The Ghana Journalists Association, with U.S. Embassy 
sponsorship (through Public Affairs), hosted a series of 
dialogues between the media and political parties leading up 
to the December 7 election.  The topic of the November 23 
seminar was the economy, unemployment and poverty reduction. 
Summaries of the main political parties\' economic platforms 
follow: 
 
9. NPP:  Deputy Finance Minister Ashong, representing the 
NPP, stated that it was important to maintain a solid 
macroeconomic environment, with sustainable inflation levels, 
lower interest rates, and higher growth.  He said the NPP 
would generate employment by increasing cocoa production, 
developing infrastructure, supporting small and medium 
enterprises, and funding Presidential Special Initiatives. 
 
10. NDC:  The NDC representative stated that the NDC\'s 
platform of social democracy means empowering Ghana to 
discharge collective welfare.  The NDC would support 
agriculture, industrial technology and agro-processing, 
reduce unemployment with construction and training 
opportunities, provide low-fee housing and medical facilities 
for street traders, reduce taxes, guarantee universal 
education, and decentralize government. 
 
11. PNC:  The PNC representative stated that the PNC is 
committed to self-reliance and economic prosperity now, not 
10 years out.  The PNC wants to cap government spending, 
reduce official corruption and avoid dependence on donors. 
The PNC proposes an economic stimulus package of USD 25 
billion, with USD 2 billion to agriculture, but the 
representative did not explain how the PNC would fund this 
program (nor did he explain the contradiction with the PNC\'s 
goal of capping spending).  The PNC also wants to limit 
export of raw materials and build a gold refinery in Ghana. 
 
Newmont Mining Company\'s Resettlement Snag 
------------------------------------------ 
12. At a forum organized by Ghana\'s Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) to assess Newmont Ghana Limited\'s mining project 
in Brong Ahafo region, a Member of Ghana\'s National 
Parliament criticized Newmont\'s efforts to resettle people 
displaced by the company\'s mining operations.  The MP charged 
that the new houses are inadequate, with rooms too small to 
accommodate large families.  He demanded they be modified. 
Newmont officials say the buildings are being constructed 
according to national building codes, but agreed to discuss 
the issue with the consultative committee, made up of 
representatives of the community and several regulatory 
bodies.  Privately, Newmont officials informed Econoff that 
they were already considering increasing the size of the 
houses. 
 
World Bank to Reward Entrepreneurial Standouts 
--------------------------------------------- - 
13. The World Bank, through the Ghana Development Marketplace 
(GDM) program, is ready to provide 4.5 billion cedis (USD 
500,000) to support 20 entrepreneurs in Ghana.  The amount 
will be disbursed as prizes for the 20 best business 
development plans designed by Ghanaian entrepreneurs.  Mats 
Karlsson, World Bank Country Director, announced that the 
program is designed to tap innovative energies across 
Ghanaian society.  He said since 1998 the Development 
Marketplace program has given out more than USD 25 million 
dollars to support more than 500 innovative projects through 
global and country-level competitions.

1.  (SBU) Summary:  Ghana\'s December 7 presidential and 
parliamentary election was generally peaceful, free and fair, 
as of 4 pm today.  There were isolated incidents of violence 
and some delays caused by shortages of materials and other 
procedural glitches.  We should have final election results 
on December 8.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  Ghanaians went to the polls December 7 to elect the 
country\'s next president/vice president and 230 members of 
parliament.  As of 4 pm December 7, the election appears to 
be generally peaceful, free and fair, with only minor 
procedural glitches and a few isolated incidents of violence. 
 This message draws from media reports and reporting from our 
30 observer teams in the field (including from the Ambassador 
and DCM, who spent much of the day as observers). 
 
Generally Smooth Process 
------------------------ 
 
3.  (SBU)  In most polling stations, voting was smooth, 
orderly, and calm.  In many areas, eager voters lined up 
hours before the polls opened at 7 am.  Turnout appeared to 
be high (an estimated 50-60 percent voted as of around noon). 
 In polling stations we visited, almost all voters were able 
to vote, with very few not appearing on the voter register. 
In these stations, electoral officials and party polling 
agents were satisfied that the process was free and fair. 
Security was visible and appeared adequate.  Our teams saw 
domestic observers at almost all polling stations, as well as 
some observers from other foreign missions. 
 
4.  (U)  A number of polling stations were late in getting 
voting materials or experienced some lapse which caused 
delays in getting started.  Although they raised tensions and 
created initial confusion at some polling stations, almost 
all these glitches were worked out within about an hour.  One 
polling station in Volta region (an NDC opposition stronghold 
area) had not received voting materials as of noon, according 
to press reports.  One Takoradi constituency was missing a 
cover for its presidential ballot box.  As a result, some 
voters reportedly skipped the presidential vote and only cast 
ballots for parliamentary candidates (The missing cover was 
found about two hours after voting started).  According to 
radio reports, voters at one polling station in Kumasi 
(Ashanti Region) cast ballots in plastic bags because the 
ballot boxes never arrived.  One of our observers in Volta 
region noted that no polling booths in her area had tactile 
ballots for the blind.  She saw several blind people voting 
with assistance from relatives. 
 
Mostly Peaceful, but Some Violence 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  Voting was peaceful in most of the country.  Media 
reports noted three incidents of significant violence.  In 
the volatile town of Bawku (Upper East region) gunshots 
briefly disrupted voting, although there were reportedly no 
deaths.  It is not clear why shots were fired, although the 
press speculated it might be related to confusion over the 
registration of a parliamentary candidate.  Radio reports 
indicate there was shooting in Tamale (Northern Region), 
although our two observer teams and DAO reps in Tamale have 
not heard this.  (DAO reps said the only incident they 
witnessed was a car chase near a polling station, while our 
observers report all is calm in Tamale.)  In Volta region, 
one radio program reported that a bodyguard of the Regional 
Minister (roughly equivalent to a U.S. Governor) shot and 
killed two people for reasons which are unclear. (Comment: 
post has up to this reporting time been unable to confirm 
this report. End comment.) 
 
6.  (SBU)  Other reported incidents of tension were isolated 
and minor.  According to media reports, there were scuffles 
in several polling stations in Odododiodio constituency 
(Greater Accra) when party activists from the National 
Democratic Congress (NDC) party and the ruling New Patriotic 
Party (NPP) accused each other of switching ballot boxes 
(there were no reported injuries).   Police quickly 
controlled the situation and made several arrests.  In 
Eastern region, fighting broke out in one constituency over 
alleged stuffing of ballot papers, according to radio 
reports.  In both cases, voting appeared to be unaffected. 
Our observer in the southern Volta region reported seeing men 
with clubs at one constituency and noted that the police 
detained a man taking a knife into a polling station. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  Overall, while not free of violence, this has been 
an impressive election day so far.  Large numbers of excited 
voters waited in long, hot lines, sometimes up to 4-5 hours, 
to cast their votes.  Electoral Commission officials and 
security personnel were present throughout Accra.  Polling 
agents (most were NDC and NPP) took their jobs very 
seriously.  None of our observers witnessed violence or major 
irregularities.  Some of the radio reports of violence may 
turn out to be unfounded rumors.  We will call AF/W around 
11:30 pm Accra time to provide a more complete report on the 
election process as well as preliminary results.  We expect 
final results on December 8.

1.  (SBU)  Summary:  As of 4:30 pm December 8, with slightly 
over half the constituency results reported, President Kufuor 
of the New Patriotic Party is in the lead in Ghana\'s December 
7 election.  The CPP presidential candidate has conceded 
defeat.  So far, the NPP has also done well in the 
parliamentary election. The Electoral Commission has not yet 
announced final results and may not complete its tally until 
December 9.  Some of the alleged incidents of violence we 
reported ref A turned out to be false rumors.  The EC 
Chairman estimates voter turnout may be over 80 percent.  End 
summary. 
 
The Results So Far 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  Ghana\'s next president needs 50 percent of the 
popular vote, plus one vote, to win.  As of 4:30 pm local 
time, JoyFM radio station offered the following results, 
based on counting at 141 of a total of 230 constituencies. 
(Note:  The Electoral Commission is certifying constituencies 
very slowly.  EC Chairman Afari-Gyan told PolChief on 
December 8 that media reports of election results are very 
accurate because they get results from the collation centers. 
 The EC will not likely have final results until December 9. 
End note.)

Incidents of Violence 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  EC Chairman Kwadwo Afari-Gyan told PolChief there 
was not as much violence in this election as he feared. 
There were isolated cases of minor violence on December 7. 
Near Tamale in Northern Region, motorcyclists began shooting 
near a polling station.  Locals burned their motorcycles and 
detained them in the house of a chief until police arrived 
and arrested two of them.  There were minor scuffles in 
isolated polling stations, including in a hotly contested 
seat in Ashanti region.  Electoral officials were pelted with 
stones in one Brong Ahafo collation center and were rescued 
by police. 
 
4.  (SBU)  We have only been able to confirm with some 
certainty two incidents of significant violence in the 
December 7 election.  Our observers in Tamale confirmed with 
local police that an NPP and an NDC activist were killed when 
an NPP party worker shot an NDC worker at a polling station 
and then was beaten to death by another NPP supporter.  As 
reported reftel, in Bawku (Upper East region) gunshots 
disrupted voting when a member of parliament initially could 
not find her name on the voting register.  According to GTV 
(confirmed by the EC Chairman), one soldier was injured.  The 
night before the election, there was an election-related 
shooting in Volta region. 
 
5.  (SBU)  There were many unsubstantiated rumors of 
violence.  The police commander in Dzodze, Volta Region, told 
one of our observers that the radio story reporting that the 
Regional Minister\'s bodyguard had killed two people was a 
false rumor.  He also discounted information which we heard 
from the UNDP that an NDC activist had shot and killed 
someone in Volta region.  He noted that one person with a 
bandage said he had been shot by the NPP but was only hit by 
a sharp object. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Security forces intervened on occasion to prevent 
possible violence.  In Tamale, one observer witnessed police 
round up six men who allegedly were plotting to steal ballot 
boxes, armed with a sword and hand tools  One observer in 
Volta region confirmed that police in the area intervened to 
stop some armed NDC supporters who wanted to disrupt voting. 
According to the local police commander, security forces also 
averted some possible election-related violence at the 
Ghana/Togo border. 
 
Generally Free and Fair Process and High Turnout 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7.  (SBU)  We continued to hear reports of some minor 
irregularities, like ballot boxes which disappeared after 
counting and lapses in voting materials.  Other foreign 
observers (although not our observers) reported numerous 
irregularities at the collation centers, where ballot boxes 
were taken after counting, including missing ballot box seals 
and recounting without the presence of party agents. 
 
8.  (SBU)  While there are no voter turnout statistics yet, 
the EC Chairman estimated turnout at over 80 percent 
nationwide.  Media and other local commentators widely 
praised the election as generally free and fair and 
indicative of deepening maturity in Ghana\'s democracy.  One 
NDC supporter remarked to PolChief after the election that 
\"Ghana is the winner.  We have matured.\"  The EC Chairman 
told PolChief his \"prayers had been heard\" in running a 
smooth election, especially given the massive task of 
deploying 100,000 EC volunteers in 21,000 polling stations. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (SBU)  At this point, it appears that Kufuor will win, 
with strong showings in swing areas of Central and Western 
regions, as well as Ashanti and Eastern regions.  Compared to 
the first round of voting in 2000 (which featured seven 
candidates instead of four), Kufuor is so far polling better 
(he won 48.17 percent of the vote in 2000) and Mills is doing 
worse (he polled 44.5 percent last time).  However, many 
constituencies have not yet reported results, including about 
half of the constituencies in the NDC strongholds of Volta 
and Northern regions.  Although not without some problems, 
this election was truly impressive.  Ghanaians were 
determined to have a good election, as evidenced in the very 
high turnout and the generally positive, peaceful atmosphere 
on election day.  Despite concerns prior to the election, the 
voter register appeared reasonably complete.  Afari-Gyan has 
no doubt that the losing presidential candidate will concede 
defeat peacefully, although this remains to be seen.   A 
number of parliamentary candidates, as well as CPP leader 
George Aggudey, have already conceded defeat.  We cannot 
discount further incidents of violence as the results 
continue to come out.

New Patriotic Party (NPP) remains in the lead in Ghana\'s 
December 7 election. The NPP has won 114 parliamentary seats. 
The Electoral Commission is expected to officially declare a 
winner by late December 9 or early December 10. The NDC has 
challenged JoyFM radio station\'s decision to call the 
election for Kufuor. Despite former President Rawlings\' 
reported attack on the fairness of the election, NDC leader 
Mills is likely to concede defeat peacefully.  We and several 
other missions will issue a statement of support for this

Updated Results

2. (U) JoyFM has already called the presidential race for 
President Kufuor.  However, the opposition NDC disputes this 
finding.  As of 4:30 pm local time, the Electoral Commission

Police Perspective on Violence 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  (SBU)  In a meeting December 8, Ghana\'s Deputy Inspector 
General of Police Patrick Achaempong told PolChief that he 
was pleased there was little violence during the election. 
He clarified that there was one incident of significant 
violence on the eve of the election and three serious 
incidents of violence on election day, resulting in a total 
of six deaths.  On December 6, false rumors spread in one 
constituency of the Volta region that the Regional Minister 
and his campaign manager were thumb printing ballots in the 
campaign manager\'s house.  In response, a mob vandalized the 
house.  A supporter of the local independent candidate was 
killed and three others injured (one of whom later died from 
his injury).  Achaempong confirmed that two people were 
killed on election day in Tolon, near Tamale, although he was 
not clear whether they died from election-related violence or 
from an ethnic dispute.  The Electoral Commission office in 
Tolon was torched.  In the nearby Kumbungu constituency on 
December 7, a group of motorcycling NPP supporters argued 
that minors were being allowed to vote at one polling 
station.  One of them shot to death an NDC supporter and was 
subsequently lynched by a local crowd, reportedly supporters 
of the NDC.  Achaempong also confirmed media reports of a 
shooting in Bawku town, Upper East region, when a 
parliamentarian initially could not find her name on the 
register.  An unknown person shot one of her two soldier 
bodyguards, slightly injuring him. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Achaempong thought it unlikely there would be 
significant violence in the post-election period, especially 
since it appears there will be no second round of voting. 
Tamale remains somewhat tense.  NDC and NPP supporters in 
Tamale fired shots into the air last night, either out of 
jubilation or frustration.  A UNDP contact told PolChief he 
saw around 500 NDC supporters driving through Tamale on the 
evening of December 8.  There were a few other incidents of 
shots being fired with no injuries on election day in the 
Tamale area.   An Electoral Commission office was burnt down 
in Brong Ahafo region on December 8.  There could be other 
minor incidents of election-related violence in the coming 
few days. 
Statements from Foreign Missions 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (U)  We plan to issue a congratulatory statement in 
support of this election once the results are final.  The EU 
and Canada are preparing similar statements.  The UNDP plans 
to issue an informal election report to the Electoral 
Commission.  Some independent British Members of Parliament 
who observed the election may also issue statements. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (SBU)  At this point, Kufuor looks likely to win a first 
round victory.  The NPP has already improved its position in 
parliament (from 103 to 114).  The NPP did well in Central, 
Western, Ashanti, Eastern, and Brong Ahafo regions, while the 
NDC swept Upper East, Upper West, Volta and Northern regions. 
 We will report with more analysis of the results on December 
10. 
 
7.  (C)  NDC leader and former president J.J. Rawlings has 
left Ghana for a previous engagement in Congo Brazzaville. 
On December 8, his Public Affairs Director issued a statement 
that Rawlings questioned the election results and believed 
\"the NPP was hell-bent on stealing the 2004 elections by 
manipulating its outcome through diverse, fraudulent and 
corrupt means.\" It is not clear whether Rawlings authorized 
this statement, although it tracks with statements he made 
before the election.  The NDC has urged patience until the EC 
declares certified results.  Despite Rawlings\' alleged 
ranting, the size of the victory and the generally peaceful, 
free manner of the election (with thousands of domestic 
observers and intense media scrutiny) leave little room for 
the NDC to dispute the overall outcome.  Our statement and 
those of other foreign missions will also reinforce Ghana\'s 
election outcome.  NDC candidate Mills, assuming he loses, 
will likely concede defeat peacefully.

Request for ESF Funding: The Problem 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
----- 
1. Despite the generous provisions of the Africa Growth and 
Opportunity Act (AGOA), West Africa is still unable to take 
advantage of the Act to export significant quantities and 
variety of fresh produce to the U.S. because of non- 
compliance with USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary (SPS) regulations that 
are designed to stop pests and diseases from entering the 
U.S. Before increased trade to the U.S. from Africa can 
occur, the fifteen member states of the Economic Community 
of West African States (ECOWAS) need to develop and apply 
uniform and appropriate SPS standards for the region. 
 
2. With support, ECOWAS could harmonize standards for the 
West Africa region.  The largely Francophone member states 
of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) 
Africa have already begun to develop improved and uniform 
SPS standards, but the remaining seven ECOWAS states, 
including Nigeria which is by far the largest economy in the 
region, are not part of this effort.  Only ECOWAS has the 
authority to harmonize standards across all of West Africa; 
however, it lacks capacity. 
 
3. ECOWAS has demonstrated that it can implement comparable 
Regional Agricultural Policy to the entire ECOWAS region, 
with help from the USAID-supported Permanent Interstate 
Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS). ECOWAS 
has also developed two successful energy programs - West 
Africa Gas Pipeline and the West Africa Power Pool - that 
establish and implement cross-border policies and standards. 
 
Proposed Activity

4.  The funds will be used for medium-term capacity building 
support  to ECOWAS in the area of Sanitary and Phytosanitary 
Regulations.  Specifically, they will allow ECOWAS  to  hire 
and equip an expert in this area for a two-year period.  The 
incumbent would help ECOWAS develop and adopt an appropriate 
set of SPS regulations for the entire region.  The incumbent 
selected  should  also  be able to  provide  ECOWAS  with  a 
limited  level  of  support  in  coordinating  biotechnology 
issues,  another area of tremendous interest to ECOWAS  that 
they are developing with regional technical networks, but in 
which  they  lack technical capacity. This would  complement 
other  medium-term assistance that we plan to give to ECOWAS 
in  the area of biotechnology. Finally, the incumbent  would 
support and coordinate national-level agribusiness proposals 
that  include promoting exports to the U.S. and EU, such  as 
one  currently  being  contemplated by  Ghana  for  its  MCA 
compact. 
 
Mechanism 
--------- 
5.  A mechanism already exists in the form of a PIO Grant to 
the World Bank for making USAID funds available to ECOWAS to 
implement this program, given that ECOWAS is not  yet  in  a 
position  to  directly administer USAID funds.  Through  the 
West  Africa  Trade  Hub, funded by  the  Presidential  TADE 
Initiative, USAID is already providing support to WAEMU  and 
to  national governments in the area of SPS.  In addition an 
APHIS  specialist provided by USDA is located in  USAID/WARP 
with  a mandate to develop Pest Risk Assessments for various 
crops that could be exported from the region to the U.S. 
 
ESF Request 
----------- 
6.    ESF  Request: $400,000 is requested for this  two-year 
program.   This  amount includes salary for  the  expert,  a 
locally  hired  program assistant, related office  equipment 
and  resources to hold a limited number of workshops in  the 
non-WAEMU  countries to which the SPS standards need  to  be 
extended.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAID, EFIN, Transparency 
SUBJECT: GHANA: TRANSPARENCY OF BUDGETS/MILITARY SPENDING 
 
REF: STATE 239929 
 
The following responds to reftel request for a report 
indicating whether Ghana meets the standards set out in U.S. 
Transparency of Budgets legislation.  Post obtained this 
information primarily from officials from the Office of the 
Auditor General.  Answers provided below correspond with 
questions posed reftel. 
 
A. General Overview 
------------------- 
1. Are military expenditures audited? 
 
Deputy Auditor General Kwadwo Akowuah informs post that Ghana 
audits military expenditures, and has done so since 1996. 
For a long time the Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) and the Office 
of National Security resisted submitting to an audit of 
ammunition and aircraft, citing confidentiality and national 
security reasons. However, in 2004, Parliament asserted its 
constitutional authority and directed the Auditor General to 
conduct the ammunition/aircraft audit.  The Auditor General\'s 
office is currently preparing to conduct this audit. 
 
2. By whom are military expenditures audited? 
 
The Auditor-General\'s representative located at the Ministry 
of Defense audits the military expenditures on a routine 
basis. 
 
3. To whom are the audits reported? 
 
The Auditor General\'s representative at the Ministry of 
Defense prepares an annual report, which is reported to Unit 
Commanders, the Chief Director of the Ministry of Defense, 
Chief of Defense Staff, and the Minister of Defense.  It also 
goes to the Auditor General.  The Auditor-General submits 
annual audit reports on all Ministries, Departments, and 
Agencies, including the Ministry of Defense, to Parliament. 
(Note:  although it does not appear that either Parliament or 
the Auditor General publishes the annual audit for the 
public, portions of it usually show up in the national media 
and it is not difficult to obtains copies.  End Note) 
 
4. Are any of the people who receive the audits civilian 
authorities? 
 
Yes.  The Minister of Defense and Parliamentarians are 
civilian authorities.  Also, the Auditor General\'s annual 
report is provided to all Ministers on the Cabinet and to the 
President -- all civilians.  The auditors are also all 
civilians. 
 
5. Is there an existing framework for conducting annual 
audits of military expenditures? 
 
Yes.  The Auditor-General\'s representative, who is 
permanently stationed at the Ministry of Defense, audits the 
expenditures on a routine basis. 
 
6. Is there legislation or an instituted government policy 
that requires annual audits of receipts that fund the 
military? 
 
Article 187 of Ghana\'s Constitution as well as the Audit 
Service Act of 2000 (Act 584) provide the legal backing for 
the auditing of all public accounts, including military 
expenditures.  The Auditor-General submits its reports to 
Parliament, which then debates and, when necessary, appoints 
a committee to deal with issues arising out of the report. 
 
Prior to 1996, the GAF and national security authorities 
would not acquiesce to audits of military and security 
expenditures.  However, Parliament asserted its 
Constitutional authority and demanded the audits be allowed. 
Since 1996, the GAF and national security authorities have 
become more receptive to audits, and prescreened certain 
employees of the Auditor-General\'s Department to allow them 
to audit military spending.  Although access was limited to 
non-ammunition spending until 2004, the Auditor-General, 
through Parliamentary action, now has unlimited access to 
audit all military operations. 
 
Annual audit reports to Parliament were in arrears of 2-3 
years because the Audit Service lacked resources to conduct 
the audits.  The Audit Service mapped out a strategy to 
complete all backlogs, and is currently auditing the 2003 
budget. 
 
(Note:  Deficiencies do not appear to be intentional, rather 
are due to lack of resources and capacity constraints, and 
are not limited to the GAF audits.  Recent improvements are 
in part due to Parliamentary pressure.  Parliament is 
exercising more authority than in the past and is pressing 
the Auditor General to improve quality and speed up audits. 
End Note) 
 
B. Military Budget, On-budget/Off-budget Revenues and Expenses 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
1) Does the country\'s budget include the armed forces and 
security forces? 
 
Yes. 
 
2) To post\'s knowledge are there significant off-budget 
military receipts?  Are they audited? 
 
Significant off-budget expenses are incurred on GAF\'s 
participation in international (mostly UN) peacekeeping 
operations, but the Auditor-General\'s Department could not 
provide figures.  However, the Audit Service recently 
conducted audits for the first time on some of Ghana\'s UN 
peacekeeping operations. 
 
C. The Military Component of the National Budget 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
1) Are productive development objectives prioritized over 
unproductive (e.g. military) objectives? 
 
Yes.  (Note:  Military spending is relatively minor in Ghana. 
 It makes up less than one percent of GDP and about 2.8 
percent of the budget.  (Note:  the combined budget for GAF 
and Office of National Security comprises 1.1 percent of GDP 
and 3.8 percent of the total budget.  End Note)  Ghana is 
under tough spending restrictions under its agreements with 
the IMF and World Bank.  Poverty-related spending is a much 
higher priority than military spending, and the IMF and World 
Bank (and other donors) monitor Ghana\'s budget carefully to 
ensure there is no unapproved transfers to the military 
budget.  End Note) 
 
2) Is there a mechanism for debate over budget priorities, 
such as through legislative assembly (e.g. Parliament)? 
 
Yes.  Parliament debates and approves the annual budget every 
spring.  In 2004, the budget for national security (including 
the GAF) was thoroughly reviewed and discussed when the 
minority party in Parliament was suspicious that the 
government (and majority party) might divert the budget 
increases allocated for 2004 to campaign activities.  (Note: 
Presidential and Parliamentary elections took place December 
7, 2004.  End Note)

TAGS: GH, PREL 
SUBJECT: PRESIDENT KUFUOR REQUESTS POTUS MEETING 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Mary C. Yates for reasons 1.5 d and e. 
 
1.  (C) This message has two requests: 
 
A) A request from President Kufuor for a meeting with 
President Bush, and 
 
B) A request from me for a congratulatory phone call from 
President Bush or senior USG official to Kufuor on his 
reelection. 
 
2.  (C)  Ghanaian President John Kufuor specifically asked me 
December 3 about the possibility of being invited to meet 
with President Bush in Washington.  He was very optimistic 
about his election chances.  On numerous occasions he has 
closely identified himself, his party, and their elephant 
symbol with President Bush and the U.S. Republican party.  He 
did not elaborate on the substance or purpose of the proposed 
meeting. (Comment:  The recent White House visits of the two 
other significant West African presidents, Obasanjo and Wade, 
undoubtedly influenced this request.  End comment.) 
 
3.  (C)  I support such an invitation.  On December 10, the 
Electoral Commission declared President Kufuor the winner, 
with 52.75 percent of the popular vote (the opposition NDC 
party has not yet accepted the results).  Kufuor has 
encouraged strong relations with the United States.  As head 
of ECOWAS for the past two years (his term will expire in 
January 2005) and President of a rare peaceful, prosperous 
democracy in West Africa, he has played a constructive role 
in regional peace efforts. Ghana contributes heavily to 
international peacekeeping efforts, supports our 
counterterrorism agenda, and has cooperated in a growing 
military-military relationship. The recently completed 
national elections were a model for Africa -- generally 
peaceful, free and fair, with around 80 percent turnout, 
supported by a vibrant civil society.  I believe a meeting 
with President Bush would send a strong signal of support for 
democracy and peacebuidling in West Africa. 
 
4.  (C)  In addition to a POTUS meeting, given the impressive 
election process and our good relations with Ghana, I request 
that a senior USG official (President Bush, SecState, or NSC 
Advisor) call President Kufuor and congratulate him on his 
reelection.

which 183,997 were rejected (2.14 percent), leaving a total 
of 8,462,710 valid ballots.  Kufuor won 4.46 million votes, 
compared to Mills\' 3.75 million.  The final voter turnout was 
83.2 percent.  The EC refused an NDC request for a recount of 
the rejected ballots. 
 
4.  (U)  On December 10, President Kufuor addressed the media 
acknowledging the EC\'s decision, thanking Ghanaians, and 
noting that his priorities for the next term are: good 
governance, human resource development, economic growth and 
reforms, and reconciliation in the troubled Dagbon area of 
Northern Region.  As of noon December 10, Mills had not yet 
conceded defeat. 
 
Key Judgments 
------------- 
 
5.  (C)  We will be analyzing this election in detail over 
the coming weeks.  Our initial assessment of these results 
points to the following judgments: 
 
-- President Kufuor won by a comfortable, but not an 
overwhelming, margin.  NDC presidential candidate Mills did 
respectably, scoring about the same as in both rounds of the 
2000 election.  This election reinforced the dominance of 
Ghana\'s two main parties. 
 
-- The CPP and PNC, both in the Nkrumahist political 
tradition, remain small players in Ghanaian politics.  The 
CPP did particularly poorly, in part a consequence of its 
weak presidential candidate.  The CPP won 2 of its 3 
parliamentary races in seats which the NPP did not contest 
(ceding the territory to CPP allies).  Other small parties 
were unable to win a single seat. 
 
-- The NPP position in parliament appears likely to improve 
slightly, increasing from 103 (of 200 seats) to at least 129 
(of 230 seats).  The NDC is slightly weaker, dropping from 89 
(out of 200 seats) to 90 (out of 227 seats at this point.) 
 
--  The election revealed general continuity in the vote 
banks of the NPP and NDC, with some new inroads by the NPP. 
The NPP did well in Ashanti and Eastern regions, while the 
NDC swept its traditional strongholds of Volta, Upper East, 
Upper West, and Northern regions.  The NPP did surprisingly 
well in Central and Greater Accra regions, which most local 
pundits thought would be more evenly split.  The NPP did much 
better than in 2000 in the Western region.  For the first 
time since 1992, the NPP won one parliamentary seat in Volta 
region. 
-- There were no major parliamentary upsets which are likely 
to have a significant impact on U.S.-Ghana relations. 
Prominent parliamentary losers included:  NDC National 
Organizer Samuel Ofosu Ampofo, Alhaji Mustapha Ali Idris 
(Minister of Works and Housing and the only Dagomba tribesman 
in the Cabinet), Elizabeth Ohene (Minister of State for 
Tertiary Education and a close PAS contact), Hawa Yakubu 
(former Minister of Tourism and a representative for Ghana in 
the ECOWAS parliament), Deputy Interior Minister Thomas 
Broni, and Jojo Bruce-Quansah Editor of Palaver newspaper (an 
NDC mouthpiece). 
-- Kufuor will not likely announce decisions about changes in 
his Cabinet after his inauguration on January 7. 
 
-- This election reinforced the reputation of the Electoral 
Commission.  Despite criticism before the election about the 
EC\'s handling of the voter register, its budget and its 
inaccessibility to party complaints, the Electoral Commission 
pulled off an impressive election. 
 
-- As predicted, the results reflect a combination of ethnic, 
personality, performance and other issues.  For many 
Ghanaians, the NPP was a party of peace, while the NDC was 
tainted to some extent by the human rights abuses and 
instability of the Rawlings era.  It is not clear whether 
Rawlings\' prominence in this campaign helped the NDC. 
 
-- The election was generally free, fair and peaceful, with a 
few isolated incidents of violence.  It reinforces Ghana\'s 
democratic credentials and boosts its international image. 
Embassy observers were impressed by the turnout, fairness, 
and genuine democratic commitment of all involved in the 
election. 
 
USG Statement 
------------- 
 
5.  (U)  The Embassy issued the following press release on 
December 10: 
 
Begin Text. 
 
The US Government congratulates the people of Ghana for the 
successful completion of the presidential and parliamentary 
election in a transparent, fair and primarily peaceful 
manner.  This landmark event demonstrates to the subregion, 
the entire African continent, and the rest of the world that 
democratic values and institutions are firmly established in 
Ghana. 
 
We commend the Government of Ghana and the Electoral 
Commission for their actions to ensure a successful voting 
process that allowed the will of the electorate to prevail. 
 
We look forward to working with President John A. Kufuor and 
his administration to pursue the common interests of the 
United States and Ghana in a spirit of cooperation and mutual 
respect. 
 
We call on members of the new Parliament to work 
constructively with one another and Mr. Kufuor to address the 
issues important to the people and the future of Ghana.

SUBJECT: GHANA: POST SUPPORTS TREASURY\'S CONTINUED FUNDING 
OF THE GHANA TAX ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. In 2003 the U.S. Treasury Department, with co-funding from 
USAID, initiated the Ghana Tax Assistance Project, designed 
to improve management and revenue collection for Ghana\'s IRS 
and VAT Service.  USAID will end its financial support of the 
program in February 2005 due to budget constraints and 
because the Swiss will be providing significant assistance to 
Ghana\'s tax arena in the near term.  The Ghanaian agencies 
that have benefited have approached Post to support full 
Treasury funding at least through year-end 2005.  Post 
discussed the program with Treasury\'s tax advisors and 
Government of Ghana (GoG) authorities and concluded the 
benefits are worthwhile.  Post recommends further Treasury 
funding through the end of 2005.  End Summary 
 
Program Background 
------------------ 
2. The U.S. Treasury Department\'s Office of Technical 
Assistance (OTA) initiated a Ghana Tax Assistance Project in 
2002, which was co-funded by USAID.  The project has provided 
training, executive seminars and technical assistance to 
Ghana\'s IRS and VAT Services to improve revenue collection. 
The funding levels were USD 130,000 in CY 2002, USD 270,000 
in CY 2003, and projected USD 300,000 for CY 2004.  USAID, 
however, has ceased its financial support of the OTA program 
due to budget constraints and because the Swiss government is 
planning to provide assistance to Ghana\'s tax agencies in the 
near term.  USAID will continue to work on tax policy issues 
in Ghana.  (Note:  USAID\'s financial support for the program 
officially terminates February 2005, but funding allotted to 
the tax assistance project has already been spent.  End Note) 
 
 
GOG Accolades for Treasury Consultants 
-------------------------------------- 
3. There has been positive feedback from Ghana\'s IRS and VAT 
services as to the value and benefits of the Treasury 
expertise.  In a recent letter, the Commissioner of the VAT 
Service, Mr. J.F. Odartey Blankson, stated that Treasury 
programs and activities contributed significantly to 
improvements in the outlook and appreciation of tax 
management and administration issues of participants in their 
daily activities and to the overall VAT Service planning 
process.  Blankson attributed the VAT Service\'s improved 
performance to their enhanced management capacity and human 
resource capacity.  The latter was strongly linked to 
training programs, which the Treasury program has actively 
supported.  The VAT Service is working to increase human 
resource capacity to continue improvements in service quality 
and tax compliance, and has requested continued Treasury 
assistance towards this end. 
 
4. Ghana\'s IRS expressed gratitude to Treasury and USAID for 
the invaluable assistance they have provided, which has made 
a visible impact on tax administration in Ghana.  In a letter 
from the IRS, Commissioner Janet Opoku-Akyeampong said that 
Treasury consultants advised the IRS in its production of a 
new collection manual which led to a doubling of collected 
revenue in assessed districts during a recent pilot test. 
The IRS also notes that workshops for executives contributed 
to the development of the agency\'s vision and mission 
statements.  Middle level managers lauded the courses on 
management skills.  Currently, Treasury consultants are 
assisting in formulating an appropriate management succession 
plan, an audit manual, gaming legislation, and a collection 
management information system to monitor collection and 
identify areas that need taxpayer education and compliance. 
The IRS has indicated that it requires the continued 
technical assistance of Treasury consultants in order to see 
these projects through to completion. 
 
Treasury\'s Measurable Results 
------------------------------ 
5. In addition to GOG feedback, the Tax Assistance Program 
has produced some impressive statistical results.  In 2003, 
the IRS saw a 43.6 percent increase in revenue collection 
over 2002.  Current estimates for 2004 are for revenue to 
increase almost an additional 50 percent over 2003. Data from 
Ghana\'s Collection Manual Pilot districts are even more 
impressive.  Treasury statistics show that in one district 
the revenue collected between January and July of 2004 was 78 
percent higher than the same period in 2003; the other 
district showed a 56 percent increase. 
 
6. Though current indicators are impressive, Treasury 
consultants expect that revenue collected will continue to 
increase.  Once transportation and telephones are regularly 
available to Collection and Audit Specialist Inspectors, 
increased field visits should facilitate the collection of 
delinquent taxes, the securing of unfiled tax returns and the 
addition of new non-filer taxpayers to the tax rolls, 
ultimately increasing voluntary compliance and tax revenues. 
(Note:  USAID recently donated seven vehicles to the IRS to 
complement the work of the Treasury program, specifically to 
allow IRS officers to do more field work.  Treasury 
consultants expect this donation to result in higher tax 
revenues over the next year.  End Note) 
 
Program Merits Further Funding 
------------------------------ 
7. USAID has indicated that their funding freeze for the 
Treasury support is solely due to budgetary constraints and 
not due to any deficiencies in the program itself.  Post 
believes that terminating the program at this point will 
interrupt the very good work that has been achieved to date. 
Post supports the GOG call for continued funding of the 
program and believes the program benefits are worthwhile. 
Post recommends continued Treasury Department funding of the 
Ghana Tax Assistance Project through at least the end of 
2005.

REF: ACCRA 1447 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) On December 3, the Government of Ghana (GoG) hosted 
symbolic signing and groundbreaking ceremonies of the West 
Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP).  The States had not accomplished 
all conditions necessary for the West Africa Pipeline Company 
(WAPCo) to take Final Investment Decision (FID) prior to the 
ceremonies.  Nigeria and Benin\'s Parliaments approved WAGP 
legislation December 7 and WAPCo signed most commercial and 
World Bank documents December 9-14.  However, WAPCo cannot 
take FID until Ghana\'s Parliament approves the International 
Project Agreement, Consent and Support Agreement (sovereign 
guarantee), and World Bank Indemnity Agreement.  WAPCo\'s 
Board meets December 16 in Abuja to decide on FID.  Costs 
increase after December 21 and all construction contracts 
expire December 31.  Failure to achieve FID December 16 or 
soon thereafter could jeopardize the project.  At WAPCo\'s 
request, Post has raised issue with the GoG and Parliament. 
End Summary 
 
WAGP Signing and Groundbreaking Ceremonies 
------------------------------------------ 
2. (U) The GoG hosted the December 3 signing and 
groundbreaking ceremonies at the CMS Energy and Volta River 
Authority thermal energy plant complex near Takoradi.  GoG 
Energy Minister Paa Kwesi Nduom chaired the signing ceremony, 
accompanied by Nigeria\'s Presidential Advisor on Petroleum, 
Alhaji Jafaru, and the Benin and Togo Energy Ministers. 
Ghana\'s President Kufuor presided over the subsequent 
groundbreaking ceremony. 
 
3. (U) The West Africa Gas Pipeline Authority (WAGPA) 
organized the event and intended to invite all four 
Presidents.  However, the December 3 date was confirmed late 
due to disagreements over whether it would conflict with 
Ghana\'s December 7 elections.  The written invitations were 
sent too late for Presidents Obasanjo, Eyadema, and Kerekou 
to attend. 
 
4. (U) Ambassador Yates and USAID Africa Bureau Deputy 
Assistant Administrator Frank Young represented the USG and 
spoke at both ceremonies.  (Note: Young highlighted USAID\'s 
five years of technical assistance on the project, and 
President Kufuor and Energy Minister Nduom also emphasized 
the critical role USAID assistance played in preparing the 
States and helping them to fulfill their project 
responsibilities on schedule.  End Note)  World Bank Country 
Director for Ghana, Mats Karlsson, and ECOWAS\' Deputy 
Executive Secretary also participated. 
 
Final Investment Decision Still Uncertain 
----------------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) The ceremonies were purely symbolic, as WAPCo did 
not recommend taking FID during its December 2 Board meeting. 
 WAPCo Managing Director Dennis Fahy told EconChief December 
8 that Nigeria, Benin, and Ghana had not passed the 
legislation and agreements necessary for FID.  Nduom and the 
other Energy Ministers signed only the WAGP Act regulations, 
a minor document out of almost 140 total documents awaiting 
signature.  (Note:  While the December 3 ceremonies were not 
as consequential as they would have been post-FID, they 
demonstrated how far the four States have come and how much 
they accomplished in five years, and highlighted how much the 
four governments believe this project will benefit their 
countries and the region.  End Note) 
 
New WAPCo Timetable for FID 
---------------------------- 
6. (SBU) The WAPCo Board meets December 16 in Abuja, followed 
by a Sponsors meeting (Note:  the same officials represent 
the various parties at both meetings.  End Note).  Fahy wants 
to complete all conditions prior to the Board meeting, so 
that the Board can recommend FID and the Sponsors approve 
FID.  They need to take FID by December 16 so that all 
investors will deposit funds into the escrow account by 
December 20.  Fahy\'s priority is to sign the USD 100 million 
line pipe contract by December 21, because the price 
increases USD 9 million on December 22.  All contract bids 
related to the project construction are valid through the end 
of the year.  Fahy estimates costs would increase 
substantially were WAPCo to rebid the contracts in 2005. 
 
7. (SBU) WAPCo, N-Gas (Chevron Texaco, Shell, NNPC), VRA, and 
the Benin Electricity Company (CEB) met in London December 10 
to sign the commercial agreements.  The World Bank\'s lead 
financial officer on the WAGP project, Scott Sinclair, 
informed EconChief December 10 that MIGA and IDA would also 
sign all necessary documentation before the December 16 
deadline.  MIGA plans to supply a comfort letter that will 
allow WAPCo to go forward with FID, with official signings 
following later in December.  IDA will likely fax signed 
documents to WAPCo. 
 
8. (SBU) The Nigerian and Benin Parliaments approved WAGP 
enabling legislation on December 7, completing the last of 
their necessary legislative actions.  Togo had already 
completed all necessary legislation.  Ghana\'s Parliament 
passed all WAGP-related legislation in July and October. 
However, Ghanaian law requires Parliamentary approval of 
commercial agreements the GoG enters into (Note:  this is not 
a requirement in Nigeria, Benin or Togo.  End Note). 
Accordingly, WAPCo and the GoG (with Post support) are 
pushing Parliament to approve three agreements prior to 
December 16: 
 
-- The International Project Agreement (IPA).  The IPA was 
originally attached to the WAGP Treaty, which Parliament 
approved in July.  However, Parliamentary leaders separated 
them and have not yet put the IPA forward for a vote. 
 
-- The Ghana Consent and Support Agreement, the GoG\'s 
guarantee of VRA payments.  WAPCo and GoG lawyers completed 
the agreement December 13 and submitted it to Parliament 
December 14. 
 
-- The World Bank-Ghana \"Indemnity Agreement.\"  World Bank 
and GoG lawyers also completed this agreement December 13 and 
submitted it to Parliament December 14. 
 
9. (SBU) Parliament reconvened December 14, so has only two 
days to approve the agreements.  Parliament\'s Chief Clerk 
told Emboffs that the soonest the appropriate committees will 
deliver the agreements to Parliament for a vote is Thursday, 
December 16.  WAPCo officials are aware that the earliest 
passage date is the same day as the WAPCo Board meeting in 
Abuja, and will monitor developments during the course of 
their meeting. 
 
10. (SBU) WAPCo\'s Dennis Fahy anticipated this time crunch 
and requested Embassy support with the GoG and Parliament. 
In response, EconOffs met with Finance and Energy officials 
and also with Parliament\'s leadership.  Minister of 
Parliament Owusu Agyepong, Parliament\'s majority leader, 
agreed that Parliament should approve the agreements by 
December 16, but did not appear overly optimistic. 
Nevertheless, Energy Minister Nduom and Finance Minister 
Osafo Maafo are pushing for expedited passage of the 
agreements, so passage this week is likely. 
 
11. (SBU) The final step is for Ghana\'s Attorney General to 
provide both WAPCo and the World Bank with a \"legal opinion\" 
on the project, assuring all parties that the WAGP agreements 
are not in breach of any Ghanaian constitutional provisions. 
 
Comment 
------- 
12. (SBU) In requesting USG assistance, Fahy commented that 
even one day\'s delay could upset the entire schedule, and 
there was little flexibility.  Therefore, Ghanaian 
Parliament\'s approval of the three agreements must happen 
this week.  Post believes the Finance Ministry and 
Parliamentary leaders will somehow make this happen, but FID 
will clearly come down to the wire.

CUSTODY 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU)  On December 9, Convention Peoples Party (CPP) 
politician Alhaji Issah Mobila, died in Tamale, capital of 
the Northern Region of Ghana, while in military custody on 
charges of possession of weapons.  The police and military 
are investigating.  The opposition NDC party alleges Mobila 
was abused before his death.  The situation is likely to 
remain under control.  However, Tamale has a history of 
violence, including during the December 7 election, and the 
city remains somewhat tense. End summary. 
 
------------------------- 
DEATH IN MILITARY CUSTODY 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  On December 9, Alhaji Issah Mobila, an Andani 
activist and Northern Regional Chairman of the Convention 
Peoples, Party (CPP), was arrested by the police in Tamale 
on suspicion of dealing in arms. He was accused of helping to 
distribute firearms to a number of communities around Tamale 
prior to the elections. The police later turned him over to 
local military custody. According to Ghanaian military 
sources, the Regional Security Council (REGSEC) announced 
before the election that anyone caught committing violent 
acts during the election would be detained by the military, 
not the police. The decision reportedly reflected a fear that 
police stations were vulnerable to attacks and thus too 
dangerous for detainees during election time. (Note: Such mob 
attacks on police stations to protest detentions have 
happened in the past year in Ghana. End note). Mobila died 
the same night while in military custody, of unknown causes. 
 
3.  (U)  The Inspector General of Police quickly formed a 
commission to investigate the incident. On December 15, he 
sent a team of police investigators to Tamale to look into 
this and other election-related deaths in the city. According 
to local press, a pathologist was sent to the area on 
December 17 to conduct an autopsy. 
 
4.  (U)  The NDC has urged calm while the police 
investigation is ongoing. The party blamed Mobila\'s death and 
the general state of insecurity in the north on NPP 
functionaries and the security agencies. Obed Asamoah, 
National Chairman of the NDC, called on security agencies 
&to protect the life and property of members and supporters 
of the party.\" He warned that if security agencies are 
perceived as either unwilling or unable to do so, an 
explosive situation is in the making.  The NDC has demanded a 
judicial inquiry into Mobila,s death insisting that he died 
in custody as a result of torture at the hands of security 
agencies. The NDC also alleged that it has been subjected to 
abuses and harassment by NPP supporters, particularly in the 
north, following the elections. 
 
5.  (U)  While the NPP initially did not make a statement 
about Mobila\'s death, on December 15, the Minister of 
Information, Nana Akomea, responded to Mr. Asamoah\'s 
accusations, stating that the death of CPP leader Mobila 
should not be politicized by the NDC. He also stated that, in 
addition to the IGP\'s investigation, the region\'s Army 
Commander has set up a Board of Inquiry to determine how and 
why Mobila died in military custody. The CPP has urged calm 
while the police investigate. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Tamale remains somewhat tense, although reportedly 
not as tense as last week. Police have orders from the REGSEC 
to \"return fire for fire\", which is reportedly helping deter 
violence. Local police and military reportedly rounded up 
suspected trouble makers last week, later releasing most of 
them.  According to one NGO contact in Tamale with good 
access to the police, as of December 16, less than 20 of 
those rounded up remained in police detention.  At least one 
group has threatened violent revenge for the Mobila death. 
Civil society groups have been actively urging peace over the 
past few days and Tamale Muslim leaders have urged local 
authorities to retrieve firearms in the city.  Mobila\'s 
funeral later on December 17 may help put some of the 
immediate tensions to rest. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (SBU)  It is rare in today\'s Ghana for someone to be 
detained, much less die, in military custody.  In the 
Northern Region, however, the military has been involved for 
some time in the arrest and detention of civilians suspected 
of inciting violence.  The quickly launched police and 
military investigations in this high profile case are 
encouraging.  The police and military are perceived by many 
in the region as biased toward the NPP, especially in light 
of slow movement toward justice in the 2002 murder of the 
Ya-Na (traditional Dagbon chief). For the moment, with all 
parties urging calm and an active police investigation, the 
situation is likely to remain under control.  However, this 
case is delicate and has the potential to spur other violence 
in the volatile Northern Region.  Mobila\'s Andani identity 
may fan flames of Andani-Abudu animosities (a dispute over 
leadership of the Dagbon chieftaincy.)  In contrast to the 
Tamale tension, the atmosphere in the rest of Ghana 
post-election has been generally peaceful.  Most Ghanaians 
have moved on from election issues to a Christmas mode.

SUBJECT: 2005 NATIONAL TRADE ESTIMATE REPORT FOR GHANA 
 
REF: STATE 240980 
 
1.  This message responds to reftel request for an update of 
the National Trade Estimate (NTE) report.  The following is 
Post\'s input to the 2005 NTE report for Ghana (Note: report 
also sent via email to USTR and State). 
 
TRADE SUMMARY 
 
The U.S. trade surplus with Ghana was USD 128 million in 
2003, an increase of USD 51 million from the USD 76 million 
surplus in 2002.  U.S. goods exports to Ghana in 2003 were 
USD 209 million, up 8.7 percent from the previous year; U.S. 
imports from Ghana were USD 82 million, down 29.6 percent. 
Ghana is currently the 91st largest export market for U.S. 
goods.  The stock of U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in 
Ghana in 2002 was USD 264 million, down from USD 295 million 
in 2001. 
 
IMPORT POLICIES 
 
Ghana has progressively eliminated or reduced its import 
quotas, tariffs, and import licensing requirements through 
the structural adjustment program it initiated in the early 
1980s.  The import licensing regime was eliminated in 1989, 
but some imports such as drugs, mercury, gambling machines, 
handcuffs, condensed or evaporated milk, arms and ammunition, 
and live plants and animals require special permits.  The 
tariff system has been simplified and harmonized to match the 
four tariff levels of the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS) trade liberalization program.  Under this 
system, there are four ad valorem import duties:  0 percent, 
5 percent, 10 percent, and 20 percent.  The standard rate of 
duty is 20 percent.  The zero-rate duty continues to apply to 
agricultural and industrial machinery, solar, wind, and 
thermal energy, and educational materials. A one percent 
processing fee applies to zero-rated goods, except on 
education, health, and agriculture sector goods.  In 2002, 
the government increased the duty from 0 percent to 5 percent 
for imported fish, selected commercial vehicles, and selected 
building materials.  .  Also in 2002, an additional one 
percent examination fee was levied on imported used vehicles. 
 Importers are charged 0.04 percent of the sum of the free on 
board (F.O.B.) value of goods and the value added tax (VAT) 
for the use of the automated clearing system, the Ghana 
Community Network (GCNet), although they have indicated they 
would prefer a flat fee on each transaction. 
 
In 2000, Ghana imposed an additional 0.5 percent ECOWAS levy 
on all goods originating from non-ECOWAS countries.  In 2001, 
under the Export Development and Investment Fund Act (Act 
582), Ghana instituted a 0.5 percent levy on all 
non-petroleum products imported in commercial quantities. 
Since the end of 1998, a 12.5 percent value added tax (VAT) 
has been tacked on the duty-inclusive value of all imports, 
with a few selected exemptions.  In August 2004, Ghana 
introduced the National Health Insurance Levy of 2.5 percent, 
which in effect increases the VAT to 15 percent. 
Additional excise taxes ranging between 5 percent and 140 
percent are applied to malt drink, water, beer, and tobacco 
products. 
 
In August 2002, Ghana abolished its 10 percent tax on 
selected \"non-essential\" imports in an effort to bring its 
tariff structure into harmony with ECOWAS and WTO provisions. 
In February 2003, the government considered adding 20 percent 
to the existing import duty on rice and poultry products but 
decided against it following consultations with its trading 
partners.  However, the government did increase import duties 
from 10 percent to 20 percent on some imported finished 
products for which locally manufactured products are 
available, such as cement, doors, windows and their frames, 
corrugated iron sheets, and nails. In August 2002, the ban on 
importing used vehicles that are more than 10 years old was 
replaced with a system of penalties ranging from 5 percent to 
50 percent of the C.I.F. (cost, insurance, freight) value. 
All communications equipment is subject to import 
restrictions.  Each year between May and October, there is a 
temporary ban on the importation of fish, except canned fish, 
to protect local fishermen during the Sardinella season. 
 
In May 2002, the WTO and Ghana\'s Customs Excise and 
Preventive Service (CEPS) signed an agreement on customs 
valuation and trade facilitation to simplify customs 
procedures and facilitate swift clearance of goods.  In April 
2000, Ghana transitioned from using pre-shipment inspection 
to a destination inspection scheme.  Four inspection 
companies currently have contracts with the government to 
perform the destination inspection. 
 
In order to develop competitive domestic industries with 
exporting capabilities, the Ghanaian government continues to 
support domestic private enterprise with financial incentives 
and tax holidays.  Nevertheless, Ghanaian manufacturers and 
producers contend that the country\'s relatively low tariff 
structure puts them at a competitive disadvantage vis--vis 
imports from countries that enjoy greater production and 
marketing economies of scale.  While tariff reductions have 
increased competition for local producers, the reductions 
have also reduced producer costs for imported raw materials 
and inputs so there is in fact some increasing demand for 
further tariff reductions, especially on inputs used by local 
businesses.  Ghana has responded by reducing the import duty 
on livestock ingredients and inputs for textiles production. 
Tariff information is available on the CEPS website 
(www.cepsghana.org). 
 
The Government of Ghana has indicated its intention to join 
other ECOWAS countries to begin the phased implementation of 
the Common External Tariff on January 1, 2005.  This will 
entail immediately harmonizing 5,100 tariffs (93 percent of 
all tariff lines) with little or no variation from the ECOWAS 
values.  For the remaining seven percent of tariff lines, it 
is likely that Ghana will pursue one or all of the following 
options:  1) phase in over a period of three years the 
remaining 400 tariff lines (constituting a large percentage 
of Ghana\'s overall customs revenues) to the slightly higher 
ECOWAS rates; 2) try to negotiate with ECOWAS a permanent 
exception to some or all of these disputed rates; or 3) agree 
to harmonize the rates over time, but in practice hold onto 
national rates. 
 
STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING AND CERTIFICATION 
 
Ghana\'s domestic standards are currently mandatory.  Ghana 
has issued its own standards for most products under the 
auspices of its testing authority, the Ghana Standards Board 
(GSB), which subscribes to accepted international practices 
for the testing of imports for purity and efficiency.  The 
GSB has promulgated more than 250 Ghanaian standards and 
adopted more than 3,057 foreign standards for certification 
purposes.  The GSB determines standards for all products; 
authority for enforcing standards for food, drugs, cosmetics, 
and health items lies with the Food and Drugs Board.  Ghana 
intends to harmonize more with international standards and 
move away from its mandatory domestic standards, except for 
products that raise environmental or human health or safety 
concerns. 
 
Ghana prohibits the importation of meat with a fat content by 
weight greater than 25 percent for beef, 42 percent for pork, 
15 percent for poultry, and 35 percent for mutton.  It also 
restricts the importation of condensed or evaporated milk 
with less than 8 percent milk fat by weight, with the 
exception of imported skim milk in containers.  Imported 
turkeys must have their oil glands removed.  Coded expiration 
dates on U.S. products cause delays but are accepted by the 
GSB. 
 
GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT 
 
Ghana is not a signatory to the WTO Agreement on Government 
Procurement.    However, in December 2003, Parliament passed 
a public procurement law that codified guidelines to enhance 
transparency and efficiency and give administration of 
procurement to a central body.  In August 2004, the 
government inaugurated the Public Procurement Board; tender 
committees and tender review boards are being formed and 
national dailies are publishing more public procurements. 
Section 60 of the procurement law allows procurement entities 
to give margin of preference to domestic suppliers of goods 
and services.  However, the government has not yet determined 
the margin of preference   or passed procurement regulations. 
 
 
EXPORT SUBSIDIES 
 
The Ghanaian government does not grant direct export 
subsidies but does use preferential credits and tax 
incentives to promote exports.  The Export Development 
Investment Fund administers financing on preferential terms 
using a 15 percent rate of interest, which is lower than 
market rates.  Agricultural export subsidies were eliminated 
in the mid-1980s.  The Export Processing Zone (EPZ) Law, 
enacted in 1995, leaves corporate profits untaxed for the 
first ten years of business operation in an EPZ, after which 
the tax rate climbs to 8 percent (the same as for non-EPZ 
companies); however, business producing traditional exports, 
e.g. cocoa beans, logs and lumber, remain untaxed.  The tax 
rate for non-exporting companies is 32.5 percent. 
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION 
 
Ghana is a party to the Universal Copyright Convention and a 
Member of the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO), the African Regional Industrial Property 
Organization, and the World Trade Organization.  Holders of 
intellectual property rights have access to local courts for 
redress of grievances, although few trademark, patent, and 
copyright infringement cases have been filed in Ghana in 
recent years. In December 2003, Parliament passed five of the 
six bills designed to bring Ghana into compliance with TRIPS 
requirements.  The new laws are: Trade Marks, Patents, 
Layout-Designs (Topographies) of Integrated Circuits, 
Geographical Indications, and Industrial Designs.  The 
government expects Parliament to pass the remaining Copyright 
bill in 2005.  In cases where trademarks have been 
misappropriated, the price and quality disparity is usually 
readily apparent.  Computer software bootlegging does take 
place, but there are no data available to measure this 
practice.  Pirating of videotapes may affect U.S. exports, 
but the evidence suggests that such piracy is not done on a 
large scale.  There is no significant export market for 
books, cassettes, or videotapes pirated in Ghana. 
 
SERVICES BARRIERS 
 
The investment code excludes foreign investors from 
participating in four economic sectors:  petty trading, the 
operation of taxi and car rental services with fleets of 
fewer than ten vehicles, lotteries (excluding soccer pools), 
and the operation of beauty salons and barber shops. 
Provision of services by professionals such as lawyers, 
accountants, and doctors requires membership in a 
professional body.  Requirements for membership are identical 
for both Ghanaians and non-Ghanaians. 
 
Ghana has committed to offering access to foreign 
telecommunications providers for most basic services but has 
required that these services be provided through joint 
ventures with Ghanaian nationals.  The government has allowed 
a duopoly to dominate both domestic and international 
services but in 2004 announced plans to open up the market by 
allowing additional carriers.  The government has adopted a 
reference paper on regulatory principles, which obliges 
Ghana, among other things, to ensure cost-oriented 
interconnection with its major suppliers.  The National 
Communications Authority, established to regulate the market, 
has yet to become an effective mechanism to resolve 
complaints of anticompetitive practices by Ghana Telecom, the 
partially state-owned national telecommunications operator. 
 
Ghana allows up to 60 percent foreign ownership in the 
insurance sector.  This cap does not apply to auxiliary 
insurance services.  Ghana requires a high capital 
requirement for foreign firms to participate in the insurance 
sector but allows them to provide a full range of services. 
 
There are no limits on foreign participation in banking and 
other financial services.  However, shares held by a single 
non-resident foreigner and the total number of shares held by 
all non-resident foreigners in one security listed on the 
Ghana Stock Exchange may not exceed 10 percent and 74 
percent, respectively.  The Central Bank must issue licenses 
for banking and leasing.  For securities trading, a license 
is required from the Securities Regulatory Commission. 
Foreign-owned banking businesses face higher capital 
requirements than Ghanaian-owned banks (50 billion cedis 
versus 25 billion cedis, approximately USD 5.6 million and 
USD 2.8 million, respectively). 
 
INVESTMENT BARRIERS 
 
The 1994 Investment Code (Act 478) eliminated the need for 
prior approval of foreign investor projects by the Ghana 
Investment Promotion Center.  Investment registration, which 
the government undertakes essentially for statistical 
purposes, is supposed to be accomplished within five working 
days.  However, the World Bank and IFC funded Foreign 
Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) conducted an 
\"Administrative and Regulatory Cost Survey\" in 2003 showing 
that the actual time reported by respondents averaged two 
weeks.  The World Bank reported in its \"Doing Business 2004\" 
report that the total time to start a business in Ghana was 
85 days, an improvement from 129 days prior to 2003 but still 
significantly longer than many of Ghana\'s peers. 
 
Investment incentives are no longer subject to official 
discretion; they have been made automatic through 
incorporation into the corporate tax and customs codes. 
Incentives include exemption from import tariffs for plant 
inputs and equipment and generous tax breaks.  Work visa 
quotas for businesses, though relaxed, remain in effect.  The 
following minimum equity requirements apply, in the form of 
either cash or its equivalent in capital goods, for 
non-Ghanaians who want to invest in Ghana:  1) USD 10,000 for 
joint ventures with a Ghanaian; 2) USD 50,000 for enterprises 
wholly-owned by a non-Ghanaian; 3) USD 300,000 for trading 
companies (firms that buy/sell finished goods) either wholly 
or partly-owned by non-Ghanaians.  Trading companies must 
also employ at least ten Ghanaians. 
The Ghanaian government at one point controlled more than 350 
state-owned enterprises, but nearly 300 had been privatized 
by the end of 2000 under the privatization program of former 
President Rawlings.  The Kufuor government has reconstituted 
the Divestiture Implementation Committee, and by the end of 
2003, total divestiture transactions numbered 318. 
Thirty-six remaining state-owned enterprises are slated for 
divestiture. 
 
U.S. direct investment in Ghana is predominantly in the 
mining and energy sectors, but there is also significant U.S. 
investment in seafood, telecommunications, chemicals, and 
wholesale trade sectors.  Wage rates in the mining sector are 
substantially higher than in other industries in the Ghanaian 
economy.  U.S. and other foreign firms in Ghana are required 
to adhere to Ghanaian labor laws, including restrictions on 
the number of expatriates employed. 
 
Several U.S. investors operating in Ghana continue to 
struggle with longstanding investment or trade disputes that 
are both exhausting and expensive.  However, most investors 
do not encounter such disputes. 
 
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 
 
Barriers to electronic commerce are mainly due to a financial 
infrastructure that is inadequate for electronic commerce to 
thrive.  The payment system in Ghana is largely cash-based. 
The legalization of foreign exchange bureaus has made foreign 
currency readily available for small transactions.  Local 
banks can facilitate the transfer of foreign payments abroad. 
 Transfers of large quantities of foreign currency, however, 
can run into significant delays. 
 
OTHER BARRIERS 
 
U.S. businesses interested in Ghana should also be aware of 
other barriers such as limited and costly credit facilities 
for local importers and freight rates that are higher than 
those for potential European competitors. Limited Ghanaian 
purchasing power dampens demand for U.S. goods and services. 
There are frequent problems related to the complex land 
tenure system, and establishing clear title can be difficult. 
 Non-Ghanaians can have access to land on a leasehold basis. 
Frequent backlogs of cargo at the port also hurt the business 
climate.  The Customs Service is still phasing in an 
automated customs declaration system that was established in 
the last quarter of 2002 to facilitate customs clearance.  It 
has not yet had the desired impact because complementary 
services from government agencies, banks, destination 
inspection companies, and security services are not up to 
speed. 
 
The high cost of local financing (with short-term interest 
rates currently above 25 percent) is a significant 
disincentive for local traders, inhibiting the expansion of 
most Ghanaian businesses from their current micro-scale 
operations and constraining industrial growth.  The residual 
effects of a highly regulated economy and occasional lack of 
transparency in government operations create an element of 
risk for potential investors.  Bureaucratic inertia is 
sometimes a problem in government ministries, and 
administrative approvals take longer than they should. 
Entrenched local interests sometimes have the ability to 
derail or delay new entrants, and securing government 
approvals may depend upon an applicant\'s local contacts.  The 
political leanings of the Ghanaian partners of foreign 
investors are often subject to government scrutiny. 
 
Corruption historically has been an issue with which foreign 
firms have had to contend.  However, in keeping with his 
intent to make Ghana an investor-friendly country, President 
Kufuor has instituted a policy of \"zero tolerance\" for 
corruption, and has confirmed his commitment to free markets 
and trade, saying, \"Ghana is open for business.\"

1. This cable provides an update of the Government of Ghana\'s 
(GoG) biosafety activities in 2004 in response to Ref A. 
Post has electronic copies of the below-referenced Biosafety 
Bill and Biosafety Guidelines and can forward them to 
interested parties upon request. 
 
2. In July 2004, the GoG hosted a National Stakeholder 
Workshop to discuss the final draft components of the 
National Biosafety Framework for Ghana (Ref B).  The GoG has 
since submitted the document to UNEP/GEF - the first of 39 
African countries to complete it.  This will form the basis 
of future biosafety regulations. 
 
3. USAID has developed a Program for Biosafety Systems - a 
global program with West African regional components.  USAID 
in Washington awarded management of the program to IFPRI 
(International Food Policy Research Institute), which will be 
working with Ghana to develop policies, training and details 
that will support the GoG\'s biosafety legislation. 
 
4. Minister of Environment and Science Kasanga is currently 
reviewing the draft Biosafety bill and will soon seek Cabinet 
approval, after which the Attorney General will submit it to 
Parliament for approval.  When implemented, the Bill will 
establish the National Biosafety Authority to process 
applications under the Act.  The draft bill delineates the 
following: 
 
Application for Contained Use 
------------------------------ 
5. For applications for contained use, a person shall not 
conduct a contained use activity involving genetically 
modified organisms (GMO) without the written approval of the 
Authority. At least 60 days prior to activities, an applicant 
must submit an application including the location of 
activities; the nature and identity of the GMO involved; the 
nature and purpose of the activities including storing, 
producing, transporting, processing, disposing; a description 
of the potential risks associated with the activity and the 
remedial measure to be undertaken for unintentional release 
and at the activity end. 
 
Application for Import or Introduction into the Environment 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
6. A person or organization intending to introduce a GMO into 
the environment or import or place a GMO on the market must 
first obtain the written approval of the Authority.  An 
application must be submitted to the Authority providing the 
following information: name and identity of GMO and domestic 
classification of the biosafety level of the GMO in the 
country of export; intended date of transboundary movement; 
taxonomic status and technical names, identifier, 
transformations code or event, point of collection or 
acquisition and characteristics of the recipient organism or 
paternal organism related to biosafety; center of origin and 
center of genetic diversity, of the recipient organism and 
the parental organism and the description of the habitat 
where the organism is related to biosafety; common name, 
point of collection or acquisition and characteristics of the 
modification introduced, the technique used and the resulting 
characteristics of the GMO; intended use of the GMO and the 
products of the GMO; quantity or volume of the GMO to be 
transferred and released; the appropriate risk assessment 
report; suggested methods for the safe handling, storage, 
transport and use, including procedures for unintentional or 
accidental release; and a sworn declaration of the applicant 
that the above mentioned information is factually correct. 
 
7. The applicant must also complete a risk assessment that 
entails identification of any of the genotypic and phenotypic 
characteristics associated with GMO that may have an adverse 
effect on the environment.  The risk assessment must also 
include the following: an evaluation of the likelihood of 
these adverse effects being realized, taking into account the 
level and the kind of exposure of the likely potential 
receiving environment of the GMO; an evaluation of the 
consequences should these effects be realized; an estimation 
of the overall risk posed by the GMO based on the evaluation 
of the likelihood and consequences of the identified adverse 
effects being realized; a recommendation as to whether or not 
the risks are acceptable or manageable, including 
identification of strategies to mange the risk; and where 
there is uncertainty regarding the level of risk, the 
governing body of the Authority (the Board) created by the 
bill may request further information on the specific issues 
of concern or may recommend appropriate risk management 
strategies and monitoring of the GMO in the receiving 
environment. 
 
Other Tenets 
------------- 
8. A person or organization intending to transport a GMO 
through Ghana, but which is not destined for use in Ghana, 
must apply for written approval to the Authority. 
 
9. The Authority may exempt a GMO from certain requirements 
above where it is satisfied that sufficient experience or 
information exists to conclude that the GMO or activity does 
not impose a significant risk to the environment.  In 
reaching its decisions, the Board can take into account 
relevant comments submitted by the public and socio-economic 
considerations arising from the impact of the proposed 
activity and the GMO on the environment.  The Board shall 
communicate its final decision to the applicant within 270 
days from receipt of the application.

REF: A. STATE 248987 
     B. STATE 254401 
 
This is post\'s response to reftel A and is the first draft 
for Ghana\'s 2004 International Narcotics Strategy Control 
Report (INCSR). The second part of Ghana\'s submission for the 
2004 INCSR, reporting on money laundering and financial 
crimes, will follow septel per reftel B. 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. Ghana takes steps to combat illicit trafficking of 
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and has mounted 
major efforts against drug abuse. It has active enforcement, 
treatment, and rehabilitation programs; however, lack of 
resources remains a problem. Ghana-U.S. law enforcement 
coordination continued in 2004, and Ghana\'s law enforcement 
agencies took steps to deepen interagency coordination. Ghana 
is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. 
 
----------------- 
Status of Country 
----------------- 
 
2. Ghana is increasingly a transit point for illegal drugs, 
particularly cocaine from South America and heroin from 
Southeast and Southwest Asia. Europe remains the major 
destination, but drugs also flow to South Africa and to North 
America. Accra\'s Kotoka International Airport is increasingly 
a focus for traffickers. Ports at Tema and Sekondi are also 
used, and border posts at Aflao (Togo) and Elubo and Sampa 
(Cote d\'Ivoire) see significant traffic. Nigerian traffickers 
continue to strengthen their presence in Ghana as it becomes 
a major transportation hub. Trafficking has also fueled 
increasing domestic consumption. Cannabis use is increasing 
in Ghana, as is local cultivation. The government has mounted 
significant public education programs, as well as cannabis 
crop substitution programs.  Production of precursor 
chemicals is not a major problem. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Country Actions Against Drugs in 2004 
------------------------------------- 
 
Policy Initiatives 
------------------ 
 
3. The Narcotics Control Board (NCB) coordinates government 
efforts involving counter-narcotics activities. These 
activities include enforcement and control, education, 
prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and social 
re-integration. The NCB\'s counter-narcotics national 
strategy, the &National Plan of Action 1999-20038, was 
never implemented due to lack of funding. However, in 2004 
the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) financed three 
demand reduction projects selected from the National Plan of 
Action: 1) training 110 Ghana Education Service counselors 
(one per district in the country) on drug abuse prevention; 
2) working with the Department of Social Welfare to provide 
vocational training to those completing drug treatment 
programs; and 3) producing a drug education guide for 
teachers throughout the country. Each year since 1999, the 
NCB has proposed to amend the 1990 narcotics law to allow 
stricter application of bail bond system (i.e., no general 
granting of bail when flight is a real possibility; higher 
sureties to assure that defendants appear for trial) and to 
fund NCB operations using a portion of seized proceeds, but 
the Attorney General,s office has not acted on these 
proposals. 
 
Accomplishments 
--------------- 
 
4. Comparing seizure data from the first three quarters of 
2003 and 2004 (based on figures from January-September 2004) 
reveals that quantities of cocaine, heroin and cannabis 
seized have all increased. The number of persons arrested 
with heroin and cocaine has also increased in this period, 
while the number of people arrested with cannabis decreased. 
Overall, 2004 saw the highest number of drug trafficking 
arrests on record. The NCB and other law enforcement agencies 
continued their successful cooperation with U.S. law 
enforcement agencies in 2004, sharing information as well as 
preparing to extradite an American citizen and a Ghanaian 
citizen to be tried in the United States for narcotics 
offenses. In January, the Narcotics Control Board and the 
Ghana Police Service Drug Enforcement Unit, aided by British 
intelligence, intercepted 588.33 kilograms of cocaine in 
Tema, Ghana,s major port city about 20k from the capital 
city. The bust was West Africa,s largest ever drug bust. All 
six suspects, five of whom were foreign nationals, were 
convicted in October and sentenced to significant jail time 
with hard labor. 
 
5. The NCB\'s national drug education efforts continued in 
schools and churches, heightening citizens\' awareness of the 
fight against narcotics and traffickers. On June 27, the NCB 
organized an event in Kumasi to highlight drug abuse in Ghana 
in conjunction with the UN,s International Day Against Drug 
Abuse and Trafficking. At this launch, the UNODC announced 
that it would assist Ghana in establishing rehabilitation 
centers for drug addicts, and a pilot project in Accra has 
since been launched. 
 
6. In October and November 2004, using Department of State 
INL funding, ICITAP trainers conducted a four-week 
counter-narcotics training in Ghana for thirty officers from 
the Ghana Narcotics Control Board, Ghana Police Service, 
Ghana Immigration Service, the Customs and Excise Protective 
Service, and the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority. The 
train-the-trainer program, conducted in two 2-week sessions, 
focused mainly on drug interdiction at air and sea ports and 
was declared a highly successful training, receiving 
widespread press coverage. 
 
Law Enforcement Efforts 
----------------------- 
 
7. In 2004, Ghanaian law enforcement agencies continued to 
conduct joint police-NCB operations against narcotics 
cultivators, traffickers, and abusers. NCB agents, who are 
not armed, rely upon the police\'s Criminal Investigative 
Division\'s (CID) narcotics unit in situations requiring armed 
force. The drug bust in January (see above) was an example of 
such a joint operation. The NCB continued to work with DHL, 
UPS, and Federal Express to intercept packages containing 
narcotics. 
 
8. The NCB reports a slight drop in the prices of cocaine, 
heroin and cannabis from 2003. In 2004, a gram of cocaine 
sells for cedis 168,350 ($18.50 at the current exchange rate) 
compared to cedis 133,350 ($15.30) in 2003. A cocaine booster 
sells for cedis 12,000 ($1.32), while crack cocaine sells for 
cedis 5,000 ($.55). A gram of heroin sells for cedis 145,600 
($16) compared to 173,550 ($20) in 2003. A heroin booster 
sells for cedis 10,000 ($1.10). The price of a small parcel 
of cannabis in 2004 is approximately cedis 5,000 ($.55) in 
2004, while a wrapper or joint sells for cedis 1,000 ($.11). 
There was a sudden increase in the prices of all narcotics 
after the January bust (see above), but the prices dropped 
again soon afterward. 
 
Corruption 
---------- 
 
9. Despite the consistent number of arrests of suspected 
narcotics traffickers, Ghana has an extremely low rate of 
conviction, which law enforcement officials indicate is 
likely due to corruption within the judicial system. As an 
example from one region of the country, between 2001 and June 
2004, of the 667 cases of drug dealers and traffickers 
reported in the Ashanti Region, only 244 persons had been 
convicted and sentenced. The backlog of cases pending trial 
and the limited resources facing the judiciary remain a 
problem in controlling drug trafficking in Ghana. The total 
number of arrests made between January and September 2004 was 
705. The NCB estimates that the Ashanti Region prosecution 
statistics are better than the national average. 
 
10. NCB officials complain that courts often release 
suspected smugglers, including foreign nationals, on bail 
that is often set at only a tiny fraction of the value of the 
drugs found in a suspect\'s possession. The court requirement 
of a surety in addition to bail is often either dropped, or 
court registrars will fraudulently use the identical property 
as surety for multiple cases. In September, the NCB was 
called into contempt of court for withholding the passports 
of suspects charged with drug trafficking who had been 
released on bail. The NCB retained the passports while they 
waited for the Attorney General to file a stay of execution 
on the bail, which was ultimately never filed. The NCB 
eventually had to turn over the passports on a court order. 
At least one of the suspects in this case, a Dutch national, 
has since traveled in and out of Ghana while on bail. 
 
11. Unlike in 2003, there were no cases of possible evidence 
tampering in 2004. 
 
12. In August 2004, four police officers were arraigned and 
charged with taking bribes from drug traffickers in October 
2001.No further action was taken on this case in 2004. 
 
Agreements and Treaties 
----------------------- 
 
13. Ghana is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, the 1971 
UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1961 UN 
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 1972 
Protocol. U.S.-Ghana extradition relations are governed by 
the 1931 U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty, to which Ghana acceded 
at independence. Additionally, Ghana is a party to the 
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Protocol 
Agreement, which includes an extradition provision among 
member states. In 2003, Ghana signed a bilateral Customs 
Mutual Assistance Agreement with the United States. 
 
Cultivation and Production 
-------------------------- 
 
14. Cannabis (also known as Indian hemp) is widely cultivated 
in rural farmlands. The Volta, Brong-Ahafo, Western, and 
Ashanti regions are principal growing areas. Most is consumed 
locally; some is trafficked to neighboring and European 
countries. Cannabis is usually harvested in September and 
October, and law enforcement teams increase their 
surveillance and investigation efforts at these times. In 
2004, combined NCB and police teams continued to investigate 
cannabis production and distribution, and to destroy 
cultivated cannabis farms and plants. 
 
15. In February 2003, the NCB implemented a pilot program 
designed to reduce the area under cultivation, under which 
140 marijuana cultivators volunteered to give up marijuana in 
exchange for government assistance with planting and 
processing new food crops and immunity from prosecution. The 
NCB plans to expand the program to an additional 120 farmers 
that have registered for assistance, although the resources 
were not available to do so in 2004. 
 
Drug Flow/Transit 
----------------- 
 
16. Cocaine and heroin are the main drugs that transit Ghana. 
Cocaine is sourced mainly from South America and destined for 
Europe, while heroin comes mainly from Southeast and 
Southwest Asia on its way to Europe and North America. 
Cannabis is shipped primarily to Europe, specifically to the 
United Kingdom. Narcotics are sometimes repackaged in Ghana 
for reshipment, and the most recent trend in concealment 
method is in carry-on, wheeled luggage. 
 
17. While in absolute terms, drugs transiting Ghana do not 
yet contribute significantly to the supply of drugs to the 
U.S. market, Accra is an increasingly important transshipment 
point from Africa. There are some indications that direct 
shipments into the United States is on the rise. In November, 
two alleged leaders of a drug smuggling ring from Ghana were 
indicted in Columbus, Ohio for shipping heroin for 
distribution across central Ohio, indicating a direct flow of 
illicit narcotics from Ghana into the Midwest U.S. Direct 
flights from Accra play an important role in the 
transshipment of heroin to the U.S. by West African 
trafficking organizations. Because of safety problems, the 
U.S. FAA imposed a ban in July 2004 on flights into the U.S. 
by Ghana,s flagship carrier, the only provider of direct 
flights from Ghana to the U.S. However, according to the NCB, 
this did not reduce the drug trafficking from Ghana to the 
U.S., but re-routed the flow through Europe. The NCB reports 
that narcotics air transit through Ghana has reduced somewhat 
in favor of land routes to Abidjan, largely due to the 
instability in Cote d\'Ivoire, which creates more favorable 
conditions there for narcotics traffickers. The biggest 
challenge in Ghana, however, are the seaports, as most of the 
coastal border is unmonitored and entry points are more 
porous. According to the NCB, the seaports allow greater 
quantities of narcotics to come through at places where there 
are weak patrol systems in place. 
 
Domestic Programs 
----------------- 
 
18. The NCB works with schools, professional training 
institutions, churches, local governments, and the general 
public to reduce local consumption. The Ministries of Health 
and Education further coordinate their efforts through their 
representatives on the Board. Board Members and staff 
frequently host public lectures, participate in radio 
discussion programs, and encourage newspaper articles on the 
dangers of drug abuse and trafficking. Ghana\'s National Day 
Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking was celebrated on 
June 27, in Kumasi, Ashanti Region. Although treatment 
programs have lagged behind preventative education and 
enforcement due to lack of funding, there are three 
government psychiatric hospitals receiving drug patients, and 
three private facilities in Accra, run by local NGOs, also 
assisting drug abusers. 
------------------------------------ 
U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs 
------------------------------------ 
U.S. Goals and Objectives 
------------------------- 
 
19. The USG\'s counter-narcotics and anticrime goals in Ghana 
are to strengthen Ghanaian law enforcement capacity 
generally, to improve interdiction capacities, to enhance the 
NCB\'s office and field operation functions, and to reduce 
Ghana\'s role as a transit point for narcotics. 
Bilateral Cooperation 
--------------------- 
 
20. In 2002, the United States provided the Government of 
Ghana with $84,000 worth of counter-narcotics assistance in 
the form of surveillance and detection equipment, including 
two narcotics detection devices (&itemizers8) installed at 
Kotoka International Airport in December 2003. Similar 
equipment funded in FY2000 and FY2001 is effectively 
maintained and has facilitated a number of drug arrests and 
seizures. FY2002 funding provided training for the Police and 
CEPS to create Internal Affairs Units, which will assist in 
suppressing corruption and strengthening their capacity to 
interdict illegal drugs. FY2002 money also funded a 
four-week, interagency counter-narcotics training focusing on 
drug interdiction at Ghana,s air and sea ports, which took 
place in November 2004. 
 
The Road Ahead 
-------------- 
 
21. Improved narcotics interdiction, investigative 
capabilities, and prosecutorial successes sum up the USG\'s 
major policy goals. A focus on improved oversight of 
financial transactions is a particular concern, given the 
potential for any narcotics financial networks to be used by 
terrorist organizations.

DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS TO FAA NATIONAL HQ WASHINGTON FRED 
DRYDEN 
 
E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/21/2009 
TAGS: EAIR, GH 
SUBJECT: FAA REASSESSMENT OF GHANA: INITIAL READOUT 
 
 
Classified By: EconChief Chris Landberg for Reason 1.5 (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  FAA Safety Inspectors Fred Dryden and David 
Everett completed a three-day review of the Ghana Civil 
Aviation Authority (GCAA) on December 16.  FAA\'s 
representative for Sub-Saharan Africa, Ed Jones, and EconOff 
observed the process.  The team reviewed the new Civil 
Aviation Act, GCAA regulations, as well as certification and 
safety inspection processes for compliance with ICAO 
standards.  FAA in Washington will review their report and 
inform the Embassy of FAA\'s decision within 45 days.  There 
are three possible results:  FAA can immediately downgrade 
GCAA, allow GCAA to maintain Category I status, or 
temporarily downgrade GCAA, with the provision of time to 
come into compliance.  Post belives FAA\'s team will reccomend 
the third option.  If this is the case, it is likely to 
impact planned operations for the new national carrier, Ghana 
International Airways (GIA).  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The recently passed Civil Aviation Act had a large 
impact on the assessment.  In their out-brief FAA team 
members described the law as both comprehensive and 
far-reaching.  Some provisions actually exceed FAA and ICAO 
standards.  The team was also impressed with the detailed 
regulations drafted in the short time since the new law\'s 
passage.  FAA found the GCAA staff to be professional, 
experienced and straightforward in their answers. 
 
3. (C) The team found deficiencies in staff training, record 
keeping, certification surveillance, and enforcement. 
However, the team also felt it was unfair to evaluate the 
GCAA unfavorably based on their compliance with laws that are 
no longer in force and oversight of an airline that no longer 
flies (Ghana Airways).  Team leader Fred Dryden said that if 
GCAA can apply and enforce the new law it could be a 
\"world-class civil aviation authority\" within six months. 
Dryden also felt many problems could be corrected before FAA 
makes a final assessment simply by universally implementing 
the new regulations and inspector handbook. 
 
4. (SBU) The FAA team will forward their assessment and a 
report to the FAA in Washington for review.  There are three 
possible outcomes: 
 
 -FAA finds that GCAA rules, regulations and oversight are so 
deficient that Ghana is downgraded to Category II status, 
banning direct flights from Ghana to the U.S. 
 
-FAA finds GCAA in full compliance and Ghana maintains their 
current Category I status. 
 
-GCAA is found in compliance in some areas and deficient in 
others.  GCAA is temporarily downgraded to Category II and 
given time to come into full compliance. 
 
Although the final decision will be made in Washington, the 
inspection team will probably recommend the third option, a 
sort of provisional status, giving GCAA time to implement new 
regulations. 
 
REASSESSMENT\'S IMPACT ON GHANA INTERNATIONAL AIRWAYS (GIA) 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
5. (SBU) During the assessment GIA CEO Ralph Atkins and 
Country Director Kirk Heaton were in Accra to oversee the 
official registration of the new national carrier, Ghana 
International Airways (GIA).  Atkins and Heaton met with the 
EconOffs before departing on December 17.  Atkins is 
confident the GoG and GIA will deposit USD 7 million in 
start-up funds before December 31.  GIA filed an application 
with the GCAA this week for an Aircraft Licensing Agreement 
(ACL) and hope to move staff to Ghana in January.  They are 
seeking USD 50 million from other carriers and private 
investors for operating costs.  This will dilute the GIA-GoG 
stake in the new company to about 50 percent, split evenly 
between them.  Atkins hopes to have this done by the end of 
March 2005.  Operations should begin in June or July with a 
fleet of 7 aircraft, expanding to 13 in 2 years. 
 
6. (C) All of this is contingent upon Ghana\'s status with the 
FAA.  Even if FAA gives GCAA time to address its deficiencies 
no new flights will be scheduled until GCAA merits Category I 
status.  GIA will not be able to fly directly to the U.S. 
until that time.  This will probably not interfere with GIA\'s 
operations since GCAA could have Category I status before GIA 
begins operations in June or July of 2005.  It may, however, 
interfere with ticketing because GIA will need to start 
selling seats in April, which may be well before FAA can 
properly assess GCAA\'s progress.  Operations could be delayed 
further if GCAA moves slowly to grant GIA\'s license and 
operating certificates as new regulations and FAA\'s findings 
come on line. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. (C) GCAA has the laws and people to be successful. 
Without the support of Government, however, it cannot move 
forward.  GCAA\'s inability to regulate Ghana Airways for 
political reasons was apparent during the assessment.  GCAA 
Director General Group Capt. Boachie retired recently, and 
the GoG has yet to name a permanent replacement.  A strong 
candidate with political clout could establish proper 
oversight of the new national carrier.  With the right 
leadership and support GCAA can use the next few months to 
properly position itself as a true regulator.  Post delivered 
this message to Roads and Transport Minister Anane on 
December 21.  FAA officials expressed an interest in 
providing technical assistance if funds can be found.  Post 
will work with GCAA and FAA to coordinate any possible 
assistance.  This could be the best way to help GCAA 
implement its new regulations and gain support within the 
GoG, without which GIA will be stillborn and we may see the 
end of the only existing direct route from West Africa to the 
U.S.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: ALCOA\'S BID FOR VALCO 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  EconOffs met with Randy Phillips and Jeff 
Heeter of Alcoa December 14.  Phillips and Heeter were in 
Ghana to follow up on Alcoa\'s proposal to purchase a larger 
stake in the Volta Aluminum Company(VALCO) and develop 
Ghana\'s bauxite reserves.  The proposal also includes the 
construction of an alumina refinery adjacent to VALCO. 
Alcoa, which currently owns 10 percent of VALCO, also 
submitted a proposal to restart a portion of the VALCO 
smelter as soon as January.  BHP Billiton (U.K.), RusAl 
(Russia), and Alcan (Canada) have also submitted bids. 
Phillips and Heeter expressed frustration with the process 
and its lack of transparency.  Alcoa submitted a draft MOU in 
August, but has received minimal feedback from the 
International Aluminum Industry Committee set up to review 
the bids.  GoG sources claim Alcoa\'s bid has the support of 
President Kufuor.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Dr. Charles Mensa, who chairs the review committee, 
met with Econ Officers December 26.  He thinks Alcoa\'s 
proposal is the strongest and has the support of President 
Kufuor.  Phillips and Heeter met the President before leaving 
for New York, and, according to Mensa, made a good 
impression.  He said a decision could come as soon as 
January, but warned that some ministers favored the proposals 
from Alcoa\'s competitors.  Moses Asaga, former Deputy Finance 
Minister and current ranking opposition MP on the Finance 
Committee, confirmed in a meeting with EconChief.  The 
Minister of Finance Osafo-Maafo told Asaga that several 
members of the Cabinet oppose the President\'s preference for 
Alcoa. 
 
3. (SBU) Phillips and Heeter said initial tests showed the 
bauxite in Ghana to be of good quality and of sufficient 
quantity to be mined profitably.  The set up, with mine, 
refinery power and smelter is also attractive and fits in 
with Alcoa\'s preferred method of operation.  They stressed, 
however, that all of the MOU\'s submitted propose to study the 
feasibility of bauxite mining and refining over the next 12 
to 18 months.  According to Mensa, the GoG sees this as a 
formality and fully expects the mine and refinery to be 
built.  Mensa also said Alcoa breathed new life into its 
chances by bringing Phillips on board.  During his meeting 
with President Kufuor December 16, Phillips made a personal 
impression on the President that helped erase the negative 
one created by his predecessor\'s handling of a similar 
meeting last year.  Mensa went on to say that Alcoa still 
needed to improve its bid to stay competitive, but had no 
specific suggestions.  Phillips complained that he had 
similar conversations with Mensa, and wondered aloud about 
the transparency of the process and Mensa\'s motivations. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
4. (SBU) Mensa\'s nebulous responses to Alcoa\'s questions may 
indicate the GoG\'s desire to improve its position by playing 
the various bids off against each other.  The GoG intends to 
keep a significant equity stake in any deal to ensure the 
bauxite is mined.  According to Mensa the GoG will not grant 
mining concessions for the same reason.  Despite Alcoa\'s 
obvious enthusiasm, the foundation for a dispute may have 
been laid if the company decides the mine and refinery are 
unfeasible and still tries to hang on to any increased 
interest in VALCO  No matter who wins the bid, the USD 1 
billion-plus investment needed to bring Ghana\'s bauxite to 
VALCO would be the largest ever in Ghana.  End Comment.

REF: STATE 250356 
 
1.  Post is pleased to provide below the 2005 Investment 
Climate Statement (ICS) for Ghana.  This report revises and 
updates the ICS submitted August 2004. 
 
A.1.  Openness to Foreign Investment 
 
Attracting foreign direct investment remains a key objective 
of Ghana\'s economic recovery program, which started in 1983 
under the auspices of the World Bank and the IMF.  President 
Kufuor, re-elected in December 2004, continues to encourage 
foreign investment as an integral part of Ghana\'s economic 
policy. 
 
As part of his avowed commitment to attracting foreign 
investment, the President relies on advice from the Ghana 
Investment Advisory Council (GIAC), which was established 
with the help of the World Bank.  The 30-member GIAC, which 
consists of multinational and local companies and 
institutional observers (IMF, WB, UNDP), helps shape 
government policy to create an enabling investment 
environment. 
 
Ghana embarked on a privatization program in the early 1990s 
that has resulted in the sale of more than 300 of 
approximately 350 state-owned enterprises.  Foreign firms 
comprise most of the bidders for these businesses.  Few local 
investors have sufficient capital to participate in this 
process except as partners with foreign firms. 
 
The Divestiture Implementation Committee is the government 
institution that oversees the privatization of these 
enterprises.  Actual divestiture is usually done through a 
bidding process, and bids are evaluated on the basis of 
criteria including management skills, financial resources, 
and business plans.  New owners are expected to build the 
enterprises into profitable, productive ventures, which 
contribute to tax revenue and increase local employment. 
Although the Kufuor administration has publicly stated its 
support for continuing the privatization program, it has made 
only one new divestiture during its tenure. 
 
The Government of Ghana (GoG) recognizes that attracting 
foreign direct investment requires an enabling legal 
environment, and has passed laws that encourage foreign 
investment and replaced some that previously stifled it.  The 
Ghana Investment Promotion Center (GIPC) Act, 1994 (Act 478), 
governs investment in all sectors of the economy except 
minerals and mining, oil and gas, and the free zones. 
Sector-specific laws further regulate banking, non-banking 
financial institutions, insurance, fishing, securities, and 
real estate.  Foreign investors are required to satisfy the 
provisions of the investment act as well as the provisions of 
sector-specific laws.  Generally, the GIPC has streamlined 
procedures and reduced delays.  More information on investing 
in Ghana can be obtained from GIPC\'s website, www.gipc.org.gh. 
 
The GIPC law also applies to foreign investment in 
acquisitions, mergers, takeovers and new investments, as well 
as to portfolio investment in stocks, bonds, and other 
securities traded on the Ghana Stock Exchange. 
 
The GIPC law specifies areas of investment reserved for 
Ghanaians, such as small-scale trading, operation of taxi 
services (except when a non-Ghanaian has a minimum fleet of 
10 vehicles), pool betting businesses and lotteries (except 
soccer pools), beauty salons and barber shops.  The law 
further delineates incentives and guarantees that relate to 
taxation, transfer of capital, profits and dividends, and 
guarantees against expropriation. 
 
Since the enactment of the GIPC law, the GoG has ceased 
screening investments.  The GIPC registers investments and 
provides all the necessary assistance to enable investors to 
become established.  The GoG has no overall economic or 
industrial strategy that discriminates against foreign-owned 
businesses.  In some cases a foreign investment can enjoy 
additional incentives if the project is deemed critical to 
the country\'s development.  U.S. and other foreign firms are 
able to participate in government-financed and/or research 
and development programs on a national treatment basis. 
 
The only pre-condition for investment in Ghana is financial; 
the GIPC requires foreign investors to satisfy a minimum 
capital requirement.  Once this is met and all necessary 
documents submitted, investments are supposed to be 
registered within five working days.  However, according to a 
June 2003 report by the Foreign Investment Advisory Service 
(FIAS), the actual time required for registration can be 
significantly higher (sometimes three to four times) than the 
required time.  Although registration is relatively easy, the 
entire process of establishing a business in Ghana is 
lengthy, complex, and requires compliance with regulations 
and procedures of at least 5 government agencies including 
the GIPC, Registrar General Department, Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS), Ghana Immigration Service, and Social Security 
and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT).  This processing period 
often extends up to 100 days.  Nevertheless, GoG reforms in 
this area have yielded some returns.  The World Bank 
announced in its \"2004 Doing Business\" report that Ghana\'s 
\"Time to Start a Business\" had improved by 34 percent, from 
129 to 85 days. 
The minimum capital required for foreign investors is USD 
10,000 for joint ventures with Ghanaians or USD 50,000 for 
enterprises wholly owned by non-Ghanaians.  Trading companies 
either wholly or partly-owned by non-Ghanaians require a 
minimum foreign equity of USD 300,000 and must employ at 
least ten Ghanaians.  This may be satisfied through remitting 
convertible foreign currency to a bank in Ghana or by 
importing goods into Ghana for the purpose of the investment. 
 The minimum capital requirement is, however, not applicable 
to portfolio investment, enterprises set up for export 
trading, or branch offices. 
 
The principal law regulating investment in minerals and 
mining is the Minerals and Mining Law, 1986 (PNDCL 153) as 
amended by the Minerals and Mining Amendment Act, 1994 (Act 
475).  This law regulates investment in mining, except for 
small-scale mining, which is reserved for Ghanaians.  It 
addresses different types of mineral rights, issues relating 
to incentives and guarantees, and land ownership.  The 
Minerals Commission is the government agency that implements 
the law. 
 
The Petroleum Exploration and Production Law, 1984 (PNDCL 
84), known as the Petroleum Law, regulates oil and gas 
exploration and production in Ghana.  The law deals 
extensively with petroleum contracts, the rights, duties, 
responsibilities of contractors, and compensation payable to 
those affected by activities in the petroleum sector.  The 
Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) is the government 
institution that administers this law.  Several U.S. 
companies are involved in oil/gas exploration in Ghana at 
present. 
 
There are no major sectors in which American investors are 
denied the same treatment as other foreign investors.  There 
are, however, some areas where foreign investors as a whole 
are denied national treatment.  Those sectors are real estate 
(non-Ghanaians may not own an interest in land for more than 
fifty years, although a lease may be renewed for consecutive 
terms), banking, securities, and fishing. 
 
A.2.  Conversion and Transfer Policies 
 
Ghana operates a free-floating exchange rate policy regime. 
There are no restrictions on the conversion and transfer of 
funds with documented evidence to support how the funds were 
gained.  Ghana\'s local currency, the cedi, can be exchanged 
for dollars and major European currencies. 
 
Ghana\'s hard currency needs are met largely through gold and 
cocoa export revenues, donor assistance, and private 
remittances.  The fall in the world prices of Ghana\'s export 
commodities in 1999 and increases in oil import bills led to 
a foreign currency shortage in 2000 and a subsequent, large 
depreciation of the cedi.  The cedi has been less volatile 
since early 2001 and stable since November 2002. 
 
Ghana has no restrictions on the transfer of funds associated 
with investment.  Ghana\'s investment laws guarantee that 
investors can transfer the following in convertible currency 
out of Ghana:  dividends or net profits attributable to the 
investment; payments in respect of loan servicing where a 
foreign loan has been obtained; fees and charges in respect 
to technology transfer agreements registered under the GIPC 
law; and, the remittance of proceeds from the sale or 
liquidation of the enterprise or any interest attributable to 
the investment. 
 
With regard to offshore loans, the Bank of Ghana, Ghana\'s 
central bank, must approve the loan agreement.  The Bank of 
Ghana inspects the terms of the loan, especially the interest 
rate, to see if it conforms to going international rates. 
There is no legal parallel remittance market for investors. 
 
A.3.  Expropriation and Compensation 
Ghana\'s investment laws provide guarantees against 
expropriation and nationalization, although the 1992 
Constitution provides some exceptions to these laws.  While 
providing protection from deprivation of property, the 
Constitution sets out the exceptions and a clear procedure 
for the payment of compensation. 
 
The GoG may compulsorily take possession or acquire property 
only where the acquisition is in the interest of national 
defense, public safety, public order, public morality, public 
health, town and country planning or the development or 
utilization of property in a manner to promote public 
benefit.  It must, however, make provision for the prompt 
payment of fair and adequate compensation.  The GoG also 
allows access to the high court by any person who has an 
interest or right over the property. 
 
American investors are generally not subject to differential 
or discriminatory treatment in Ghana, and there have been no 
official government expropriatory actions in recent times. 
One U.S. investor recently filed for international 
arbitration against the Government of Ghana, claiming 
expropriation of investment.  This case is ongoing and may 
take several years to resolve. 
 
A.4.  Dispute Settlement 
 
There are currently several commercial disputes involving 
U.S. companies, specifically in the areas of cotton 
production, rice production, and telecommunications.  The GoG 
is trying to settle some of these problems, but several 
remain unresolved.  Contracts signed under the previous 
government have come under renewed scrutiny by President 
Kufuor\'s government. 
 
Ghana\'s legal system is based on British common law.  The 
most important exception for the purpose of investment is the 
acquisition of interest in land, which is governed by both 
statutory and customary law. 
 
The judiciary comprises both the lower courts and the 
superior courts.  The superior courts are the Supreme Court, 
the Court of Appeal, and the High Court.  Lawsuits are 
permitted and usually begin in the High Court.  There is a 
history of government intervention in the court system, 
although somewhat less so in commercial matters.  The courts 
have, when the circumstances require, entered judgment 
against the government.  For example, the Supreme Court 
dismissed an application filed by the government in a case 
that involved an American agricultural trading company. 
However, the courts have been slow in disposing of cases and 
at times face challenges in enforcing decisions, largely due 
to resource constraints and institutional inefficiencies. 
There is a growing interest in alternative dispute 
resolution, especially as it applies to commercial cases. 
The Attorney General\'s office has drafted enabling 
legislation, and several lawyers are providing arbitration 
and/or conciliation services. 
 
The government has established \"fast-track\" courts to 
expedite action on some cases.  The \"fast track\" courts, 
which are automated (computerized) divisions of the High 
Court of Judicature, were intended to try cases to conclusion 
within six months.  However, there are indications that these 
courts are increasingly not able to try cases within this 
target time period.  These courts are authorized to hear 
cases which involve banks and investors, human rights, 
electoral petitions, government revenue, prerogative writs, 
defamation, specified commercial and industrial cases, and 
criminal cases involving substantial public money or a matter 
of extreme public importance.  The government has automated 
the High Courts in Accra, Kumasi, and Sekondi, with 10 other 
courts in process. 
 
Enforcement of foreign judgments in Ghana is based on the 
doctrine of reciprocity.  On this basis, judgments from 
Brazil, France, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Senegal, 
Spain, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom are 
enforceable.  Judgments from the United States are not 
enforceable in Ghana at this time. 
 
The GIPC Law as well as the Minerals and Mining Law address 
dispute settlement procedures and provide for arbitration 
when disputes cannot be settled by other means.  They also 
provide for referral of disputes to arbitration in accordance 
with the rules of procedure of the United Nations Commission 
on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), or within the 
framework of a bilateral agreement between Ghana and the 
investor\'s country. 
 
The U.S. has signed three bilateral trade and investment 
agreements with Ghana: the OPIC Investment Incentive 
Agreement, the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, and 
the Open Skies Agreement.  These agreements contain some 
provision for investment and trade dispute settlement.  When 
the parties do not agree on a venue for arbitration, the 
investor\'s choice prevails.  In this regard, Ghana accepts as 
binding the international arbitration of investment disputes. 
 Ghana does not have a bankruptcy statute.  The Companies 
Code of 1963, however, provides for official closure of a 
company when it is unable to pay its debts. 
In 1996, the privately managed Ghana Arbitration Center was 
established to strengthen the legal framework for protecting 
commercial and economic interests, and to bolster investors\' 
confidence in Ghana.  The American Chamber of Commerce\'s 
(Ghana) Commercial Conciliation Center provides arbitration 
services on trade and investment issues. 
 
Ghana signed and ratified the Convention on the Settlement of 
Investment Disputes in 1966.  Ghana is also a signatory and 
contracting state of the UN Convention on the Recognition and 
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the \"New York 
Convention\"). 
 
A.5.  Performance Requirements and Incentives 
 
Ghana is in compliance with WTO Trade-Related Investment 
Measures (TRIMS) notification. 
 
Generally, Ghana does not have performance requirements for 
establishing, maintaining, and expanding a business. 
However, in its privatization of state-owned enterprises, 
notably the telecommunications sector, companies have to meet 
performance targets or they may have their licenses revoked. 
In the case of banks, the opening of branches requires 
approval from the central bank.  Investors are not required 
to purchase from local sources.  Except for free zone 
enterprises operating under the Free Zone Act, which are 
required to export 70 percent of their products, investors 
are not required to export a specified percentage of their 
output. 
 
Foreign investors are not required by law to have local 
partners except in the fishing, insurance, and mining 
industries.  In the tuna-fishing industry, non-Ghanaians may 
own a maximum of seventy-five percent of the interest in a 
tuna-fishing vessel.  In the insurance sector, a non-Ghanaian 
cannot own more than sixty percent of an insurance company. 
In the case of the Ghana Stock Exchange, a single foreign 
investor cannot own more than ten percent of any security 
listed.  This applies to individuals as well as institutional 
investors.  The total holding of all foreigners in a listed 
security cannot exceed seventy-four percent.  There is 
compulsory local participation in the minerals and mining 
sector.  By law, the GoG acquires ten percent of all 
interests in mining ventures at no cost. 
 
There are no requirements on physical location of 
investments.  However, there are tax incentives to encourage 
investment in specific locations.  There are also no import 
substitution restrictions, but there is an export quota of 
seventy percent for companies operating under the Free Zone 
Act.  The only requirement for compulsory employment of 
Ghanaians is that any investment in a trading enterprise must 
employ a minimum of ten Ghanaians. 
 
There are regulations relating to the transfer of technology 
when it is not freely available in Ghana.  The transfer of 
technology is governed by an agreement under the Technology 
Transfer Regulations of Ghana.  Any provisions in the 
agreement inconsistent with Ghanaian regulations are 
unenforceable in Ghana. 
 
Investment incentives differ slightly depending upon the law 
under which an investor operates.  For example, while all 
investors operating under the Free Zone Act are entitled to a 
ten-year corporate tax holiday, investors operating under the 
GIPC law are not automatically entitled to a tax holiday, 
depending upon the sector in which they are operating. 
 
All investment-specific laws contain some investment 
incentives. The GIPC law allows for import and tax exemptions 
for plant inputs and machinery (and parts thereof) imported 
for the purpose of the investment.  Specifically, chapters 
82, 84, 85, and 89 of the Customs Harmonized Commodity and 
Tariff Code zero-rates (i.e. does not levy import duty) these 
production items.  The GoG recently imposed a five percent 
import duty on some items that were previously zero-rated. 
The GIPC website (www.gipc.org.gh) provides a more thorough 
description of incentive programs.  The law also guarantees 
the investor all the tax incentives provided for under 
Ghanaian law.  For example, rental income from commercial and 
residential property for the first five years after 
construction is exempt from tax.  Similarly, income from a 
company selling or letting out premises is income tax exempt 
for the first five years of operation.  Rural banks and 
cattle ranching are exempt from income tax for 10 years. 
 
The corporate tax rate is 32.5 percent (the GoG has proposed 
a reduction to 30 percent, starting in January 2005) for all 
sectors except income from non-traditional exports (eight 
percent), income from hotels (25 percent), and income earned 
by companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange (30 percent). 
 For some sectors there are tax holidays for a number of 
years.  These sectors include, free zone enterprises and 
developers (zero percent for the first 10 years and eight 
percent thereafter), real estate development and rental (zero 
percent for the first five years and 32.5 percent 
thereafter), agro-processing companies (zero percent for the 
first five years after which the tax rate ranges from 0 to 30 
percent depending on the location of the company in Ghana), 
and waste processing companies (zero percent for seven years 
and 32.5 percent thereafter).  Tax rebates are also offered 
in the form of incentives based on location.  A capital 
allowance in the form of an accelerated depreciation 
allowance is also applicable in all sectors except banking, 
finance, commerce, insurance, mining, and petroleum. 
 
The Ghanaian tax system is replete with tax concessions that 
make the effective tax rate generally low.  The incentives 
are specified in the GIPC law and are not applied in an ad 
hoc or arbitrary manner.  The GIPC has no discretion and once 
the investor has been registered under the GIPC law, the 
investor is entitled to the incentives provided by law.  The 
GIPC, however, has discretion if an investor is seeking 
additional customs duty exemptions and tax incentives. 
 
A 12.5 percent VAT plus a 2.5 percent Health Insurance Levy, 
instituted in August 2004, are levied on most imports, all 
consumer purchases, services, accommodation in hotels and 
guest houses, food in restaurants, hotels and snack bars, as 
well as advertising, betting and entertainment. 
 
Ghana has no discriminatory or excessively onerous visa 
requirements.  An investor who invests under the GIPC law is 
automatically entitled to a specific number of visas/work 
permits based on the size of the investment.  When an 
investment of USD 10,000 or its equivalent is made in 
convertible currency or machinery and equipment, the 
enterprise can obtain a visa/work permit for one expatriate 
employee.  An investment of USD 10,000 to USD 100,000 
entitles the enterprise to two automatic visas/work permits. 
An investment of USD 500,000 and above allows an enterprise 
to bring in four expatriate employees.  An enterprise may 
apply for extra visas/work permits, but the investor must 
justify why a foreigner must be employed rather than a 
Ghanaian.  There are no restrictions on the issuance of work 
and residence permits to Free Zone investors and employees. 
 
Ghana has no import price controls.  It is pursuing a 
liberalized import regime policy within the framework and the 
spirit of the World Trade Organization to accelerate 
industrial growth.  The Government of Ghana has indicated its 
intention to join other ECOWAS countries to begin the phased 
implementation of the Common External Tariff on January 1, 
2005. 
 
A.6.  Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
 
The laws of Ghana recognize the right of foreign and domestic 
private entities to own and operate business enterprises. 
Foreign entities are, however, prohibited by law from 
engaging in certain business activities in Ghana (see section 
1, paragraph 6). 
 
Private entities may freely acquire and dispose of their 
interests in Ghana.  When a foreign investor disposes of an 
interest in a business enterprise, the investor is entitled 
to repatriate his or her earnings in a freely convertible 
currency. 
 
Private and public enterprises compete on equal basis with 
respect to access to credit, markets, licenses, and supplies. 
 
A.7.  Protection of Property Rights 
The legal system recognizes and enforces secured interest in 
property, both chattel and real, but the process to get clear 
title over land is often difficult, complicated, and lengthy. 
 It is important to conduct a thorough search at the Lands 
Commission to ascertain the identity of the true owner of any 
land being offered for sale.  Investors should be aware that 
land records can be incomplete or non-existent and, 
therefore, clear title may be impossible to establish. 
 
Mortgages exist in Ghana and are regulated by the Mortgages 
Decree.  They are enforced by judicial sale upon application 
to the court.  A mortgage must be registered under the Land 
Title Registration Law, a requirement that is mandatory for 
it to take effect.  Registration with the Land Title Registry 
is a reliable system of recording the transaction. 
 
The protection of intellectual property is an evolving area 
of law in Ghana.  Progress has been made in recent years to 
afford protection under both local and international law. 
Ghana is a member of the World Intellectual Property 
Organization (WIPO) and the English-speaking African Regional 
Industrial Property Organization (ESARIPO).  The courts have 
been pro-active in the protection of intellectual property 
rights.  Steps are being taken to implement the WTO TRIPS 
(Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) 
Agreement.  Ghana\'s Parliament has passed all TRIPS-compliant 
legislation, except the Copyright bill. 
 
A.8.  Transparency of the Regulatory System 
 
The GoG\'s policies of trade liberalization and investment 
promotion are guiding its effort to create a clear and 
transparent regulatory system.  There has been some effort to 
repeal laws that impede and distort investment, and the 
frequency of labor disputes in recent years has spurred a 
review of labor laws.  Parliament passed a new Labor Law in 
July 2003, effective March 2004, which should reduce the 
incidence of labor disputes. 
 
The GIPC law codified the GoG\'s desire to present foreign 
investors with a liberal and transparent foreign investment 
regulatory regime.  To this end, the Ghana Investment 
Promotion Center has established a \"one-stop shop\" to 
eliminate the bureaucratic bottlenecks for investors.  Under 
the Ghana Trade and Investment Gateway (GHATIG) Program, time 
frames within which government officials must perform 
specific duties have been set and are constantly being 
monitored.  Implementation, however, has not always measured 
up to desired standards. 
 
The GoG has established regulatory bodies such as the 
National Communications Authority, the Energy Commission, and 
the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission to oversee 
activities in the telecommunications, power, and water 
sectors.  These bodies are relatively new and 
under-resourced, which limits their ability to deliver the 
intended level of oversight. 
 
A.9.  Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
 
Private sector growth in Ghana has been constrained by 
limited financing opportunities for private investment. 
Sixteen years after the beginning of financial sector reforms 
in 1988, much remains to be done.  Confidence in the 
financial sector has suffered because of policy interventions 
by the government, many of which have not facilitated the 
free flow of financial resources in the product and input 
markets.  Current high interest rates on bank loans (more 
than 25 percent) and treasury bills (17 percent) have been a 
serious impediment to raising capital on the local market. 
 
Some recent developments in the non-banking financial sector 
have been encouraging.  Among the non-banking financial 
institutions, leasing companies, building societies and 
savings and loan associations have been innovative in serving 
savers and borrowers.  In addition, the formulation of new 
regulatory policies for the Ghana Stock Exchange (which has 
29 listed companies and 2 corporate bonds at the present time 
and oversees portfolio investment) has been promising.  The 
Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) is still considered one of the 
best performing bourses in emerging markets.  It is open to 
all foreign buyers and subject to the restrictions described 
in section 7.5, paragraph 3.  Both foreign and local 
companies are allowed to list on the GSE.  The Securities 
Regulatory Commission regulates the activities on the 
Exchange. 
 
Banks in Ghana are relatively small.  The largest in the 
country, Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB), has a net worth of 
approximately USD 50 million.  Out of the 18 banks in Ghana, 
the GoG has a partial ownership position in GCB and fully 
owns two other banks.  The GoG is still reviewing options 
regarding divestiture of its remaining interest in GCB. 
 
Although Ghana\'s informal financial sector is large, with an 
estimated 45 percent of all private sector financial savings 
mobilized initially through informal channels, its capacity 
to serve as an intermediary between savers and investors has 
been limited.  This is due in part to Ghanaians\' savings 
behavior (customarily avoiding the formal banking system), 
and in part to the absence of strong links with the formal 
sector. 
 
A.10.  Political Violence 
 
Ghana offers a relatively stable and predictable political 
environment for American investors.  There is no indication 
at present that the level of political risk in Ghana will 
change markedly over the near term.  Peaceful and fair 
presidential and parliamentary elections were held on 
December 7, 2004.  Incumbent President, John Agyekum Kufuor 
of the National Patriotic Party, was reelected for a second 
four-year term, marking a fourth consecutive democratic 
election. 
A.11.  Corruption 
 
Corruption in Ghana is somewhat less prevalent than in other 
countries in the region, and no U.S. firms have identified 
corruption as the main obstacle to foreign direct investment. 
 Companies cannot expect complete transparency in locally 
funded contracts, however.  The 2004 Transparency 
International global corruption ranking placed Ghana 64 out 
of 146 countries in its Corruption Perceptions Index.  Of the 
African countries included in the survey, Ghana rated seventh 
least corrupt country, following Botswana, Tunisia, South 
Africa, Seychelles, Mauritius, and Namibia. 
 
Ghana is not a signatory to the OECD Convention on Combating 
Bribery.  It has, however, taken steps to amend laws on 
public financial administration and public procurement.  The 
public procurement law, passed in January 2004, seeks to 
harmonize the many public procurement guidelines used in the 
country and also to bring public procurement into conformity 
with WTO standards.  The new law aims to improve 
accountability, value for money, transparency and efficiency 
in the use of public resources.   A Freedom of Information 
bill developed by civil society may also be passed to allow 
greater access to public information. 
 
American businesses have reported being asked for \"favors\" in 
the past.  It is easy to make friends in Ghana who can 
facilitate business transactions.  In return, these friends 
may ask for favors, some of which may conflict with U.S. 
business ethics or laws.  U.S. business visitors should make 
clear that U.S. companies operating abroad are subject to the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. 
 
Commercial fraud in the form of scams, especially in gold or 
currency deals, is on the rise in Ghana.  These are commonly 
termed \"419\" scams.  While these cases are exceptions and not 
the rule to doing business in Ghana, U.S. potential gold 
buyers are strongly advised to deal directly with the 
Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC) in Ghana.  Gold 
can be exported legally from Ghana only through the PMMC. 
U.S. firms can request a background check on companies and 
individuals with whom they wish to do business by using the

The GoG has publicly committed to ensuring that government 
officials do not use their positions to enrich themselves. 
Official salaries are modest, especially for low-level 
government employees.  GoG employees frequently ask 
applicants for licenses and permits for a \"dash\" (tip). 
 
The 1992 Constitution provided for the establishment of a 
Commission On Human Rights and Administrative Justice 
(CHRAJ).  Among other things, the Commission is charged with 
investigating all instances of alleged and suspected 
corruption and the misappropriation of public funds by 
officials.  The Commission is also authorized to take 
appropriate steps, including providing reports to the 
Attorney General and the Auditor-General, in response to such 
investigations.  The Commission has a mandate to prosecute 
alleged offenders when there is sufficient evidence to 
initiate legal actions. 
 
In 1998, the GoG also established an anti-corruption 
institution, called the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), to 
investigate corrupt practices involving both private and 
public institutions.  SFO\'s 1999 report to the President and 
Parliament reported cases of economic fraud that resulted in 
more than USD 2 million in losses to the country.  The SFO 
has called for a national debate on how to deal with largesse 
acquired through economic crimes since the present punishment 
of dismissal and imprisonment is an inadequate deterrent. 
The GoG has announced plans to streamline the roles of the 
CHRAJ and SFO, in order to remove their duplication of 
efforts. 
 
President Kufuor has declared a \"zero tolerance\" for 
corruption.  He has established an Office of Accountability 
to oversee the performance of senior government 
functionaries.  Several corruption prosecutions are underway 
against former officials of the Rawlings administration, and 
a former minister is now in jail.  Two other ministers are 
also in jail for their role in causing financial loss to the 
state.  Cabinet Ministers recently approved \"Whistle Blowers\" 
legislation for Parliament action, to encourage Ghanaian 
citizens to volunteer information on corrupt practices to 
appropriate agencies. 
 
B.  Bilateral Investment Agreements 
 
Ghana has bilateral investment agreements with the following 
countries: the United Kingdom, Republic of China, Romania, 
Denmark, and Switzerland.  These agreements were signed and 
ratified between 1989 and 1992.  Italy and France are 
currently negotiating similar arrangements.  Agreements with 
Germany, India, Pakistan, South Korea, North Korea, and 
Belgium are being considered.  The U.S. signed three 
agreements between 1998 and 2000: the OPIC Investment 
Incentive Agreement, the Trade and Investment Framework 
Agreement (TIFA), and the Open Skies Agreement. 
 
Ghana has met eligibility requirements to participate in the 
benefits afforded by the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
(AGOA) and also qualified for the apparel benefits under AGOA. 
 
C.  OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs 
 
OPIC is active in Ghana, and OPIC officers visit Ghana 
periodically to meet with representatives of prominent 
American and Ghanaian firms.  OPIC launched the Modern Africa 
Growth Fund and the Africa Infrastructure Investment Fund, 
which are sources of information and financing for investment 
in Ghana.  The African Project Development Facility (APDF) 
and the African investment program of the International 
Finance Corporation are other sources of information.  Ghana 
is a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 
(MIGA). 
 
D.  Labor 
 
Ghana has a large pool of inexpensive, unskilled labor. 
English is widely spoken, especially in urban areas.  Labor 
regulations and policies are generally favorable to business. 
 Labor-management relations are fairly good. 
 
The new Labor law (Act 651) passed in 2003 became effective 
in March 2004.  The new law unifies and modifies the old 
labor laws to bring them into conformity with the core 
principles of the International Labor Convention, to which 
Ghana is a signatory.  All the old labor related laws, except 
the Children\'s Law (Act 560), have been repealed. 
 
Under the new Labor Law, the Chief Labor Officer will now 
issue collective bargaining agreements (CBA) in lieu of the 
Trade Union Congress (TUC).  This effectively limits the 
TUC\'s monopoly, since the old CBA provisions implicitly 
compelled all unions to be part of TUC.  Also, instead of the 
labor court, a National Labor Commission has been established 
to resolve labor and industrial disputes.  Finally, the 
Tripartite Committee that determines the minimum daily wage 
now has legal backing, and public and private employment 
centers can be created to help job seekers find work. 
 
There is no legal requirement for labor participation in 
management.  However, joint consultative committees in which 
management and employees meet to discuss issues affecting 
business productivity are common. 
 
There are no statutory requirements for profit sharing, but 
fringe benefits in the form of year-end bonuses and 
retirement benefits are generally included in collective 
bargaining agreements. 
 
Consulting a local attorney with regard to labor issues is 
recommended.  The U.S. Consulate in Accra maintains a list of 
local attorneys, which is available upon request. 
E.  Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports 
 
Free Trade Zones were established in May 1996, one near Tema 
Steelworks, Ltd., in the Greater Accra Region, and two other 
sites located at Mpintsin and Ashiem near Takoradi.  The 
seaports of Tema and Takoradi, as well as the Kotoka 
International Airport and all the lands related to these 
areas, are a part of the free zone.  The law also permits the 
establishment of single factory zones outside or within the 
areas mentioned above.  Under the law, a company qualifies to 
be a free zone company if it exports more than 70 percent of 
its products.  Among the incentives for free zone companies 
are a ten-year corporate tax holiday and zero duty on imports. 
 
To make it easier for free zone developers to acquire the 
various licenses and permits to operate, the Ghana Free Zones 
Board provides a \"one-stop approval service\" to assist in the 
completion of all formalities.  A lack of resources has 
limited the effectiveness of the Board, however.  To further 
facilitate operations in the zones, nationals of OECD 
countries, East Asian countries, and the Republic of South 
Africa may with advance notice obtain entry visas at the 
international airport in Accra.  However, all foreign 
employees of businesses established under the program will 
require work and residence permits.

F.  Major Foreign Investors in Ghana 
 
Major foreign investments in Ghana are mainly in mining and 
manufacturing.  Great Britain is Ghana\'s leading foreign 
investor with direct investment exceeding USD 750 million. 
Major U.S. investors are, CMS Energy (independent power 
producer), Regimanuel Gray Limited (housing and 
construction), Boeing, Coca-Cola Company, Affiliated Computer 
Services (data processing), Pioneer Foods (Star-Kist tuna), 
Phyto-Riker (pharmaceuticals), Millicom (telecommunications), 
Western Wireless International (telecommunications), and 
Newmont Mining.  There has been some interest by American 
companies in acquisition of state-owned communications and 
manufacturing firms slated for divestiture, as well as new 
investments in the telecommunications and agricultural 
sectors. 
 
There are significant investments by other foreign nationals 
made through the GoG privatization program.  These include: 
Norwegian interests in Ghana Cement Works (GHACEM), a cement 
manufacturing plant; Bau Nord AG (IBN), a Swiss company, in 
the GoG-owned GAFCO; Walter Schroeder, a German company, in 
the GoG-owned West Africa Mills; and Telekom Malaysia in 
Ghana Telecom.  South African and Australian companies are 
also active in the mining sector. 
 
G.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Statistics 
 
FDI statistics in Ghana tend to be unreliable since the 
promotion and monitoring of FDI in Ghana are carried out by 
several agencies without coordination in arriving at a total 
figure. 
 
Since 1994, however, the Ghana Investment Promotion Center 
(GIPC) has registered over 1281 projects.  GIPC provided the 
following statistics on registered private investments. 
(Note:  These figures do not include investments in the 
mining and petroleum industries and free zones, which are all 
major recipients of FDI.  End Note) 
 
Foreign direct investment (FDI) (USD million) 
 
1994 Sep ) 1999 Dec   1,205.46 
2000                   114.91 
2001                    89.32

2003                    88.06 
2004 (Jan ) Sep)        85.52 
 
Between September 1994 and September 2004, the U.S. ranked 
fifth in terms of number of investment projects (125) after 
Great Britain (171), India (170), China (155), and Lebanon 
(131).  The services and manufacturing sectors recorded the 
highest number of investment projects during this period.

SUBJECT: WAGP INVESTMENT COMPLETED FOLLOWING LAST MINUTE 
DRAMA IN GHANA 
 
REF: ACCRA 2484 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  On December 17 and 20 the West Africa Gas 
Pipeline Company (WAPCo) and West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) 
shareholders completed the final requirements for taking 
Final Investment Decision (FID).  Most investors (excluding 
Togo and Benin) deposited their financial contributions into 
escrow December 20.  However, Ghana was unable to make 
payment until early February 23.  WAPCo reports that the 
Government of Ghana (GoG) delivered a last minute payment, 
and WAPCo was able to sign the major construction contracts 
December 23 in Houston.  Full-scale construction should begin 
in summer 2005, with first gas expected December 2006.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) WAPCo\'s Board of Directors met December 16 in Abuja 
to approve provisional FID, pending Ghana\'s passage of three 
commercial agreements:  the WAGP International Project 
Agreement, the Ghana Consent and Support Agreement (sovereign 
guarantee for gas purchases), and the World Bank Indemnity 
Agreement.  Other pending issues were the resolution of the 
Takoradi Insurance Mortgage Agreement between Ghana\'s Volta 
River Authority (VRA) and WAPCo/N-Gas, and legal opinions 
from VRA and Ghana\'s Attorney General. 
 
3. (SBU) Ghana\'s Parliament passed the three WAGP commercial 
agreements December 17, under intensive pressure from Ghana\'s 
Finance and Energy Ministers and WAPCo representatives, and 
also following World Bank and Emboff lobbying of 
Parliamentary leaders.  This action cleared away the last 
major hurdle to FID, and allowed WAPCo to proceed with its 
request for the investors/shareholders to deposit funds into 
escrow by COB Monday, December 20. 
 
4. (SBU) Randall Ramey, Chevron Texaco\'s WAGP Project 
Director confirmed on December 22 that VRA and the Attorney 
General had rendered satisfactory legal opinions and the VRA 
insurance issue had been resolved.  Ramey also confirmed that 
most investors had deposited funds into escrow.  Neither Togo 
and Benin put up funds at FID to activate their option to 
become shareholders.  The possible result is that Togo and 
Benin will not be included as \"foundation customers,\" and 
therefore would potentially face higher costs for gas. 
According to Ramey, both Benin and Togo requested a six-month 
extension to raise their respective two percent stakes.  The 
WAPCo Board will discuss this at its next meeting in early 
2005.  In the interim, Chevron Texaco paid for and will hold 
Benin and Togo\'s four percent. 
 
5. (SBU)  Post learned late on December 23 that VRA\'s Letter 
of Credit for USD 80 million was not honored by WAPCo\'s bank, 
and, therefore, the GoG was unable pay for its 16.3 percent 
share before the December 20 deadline.  This led to a 
desperate scramble to obtain Government of Ghana funds in 
time to avoid cost increases and even save the project. 
WAPCo sources report that VRA officials held an emergency 
meeting with Ghana\'s President Kufuor to come up with the 
financing.  The method of payment (or guarantee) is still 
unclear, but WAPCo reports that the funds were deposited 
early in the day on December 23. 
 
6. (SBU) With funds reportedly totaling about USD 637 million 
finally in hand, WAPCo is reported to have signed the major 
construction contracts late on December 23, including the 
critical and time sensitive USD 100 million line pipe 
contract.  (Note:  The line pipe contract price was set to 
increase by almost 10 percent on December 22.  However, WAPCo 
was apparently able to negotiate a two-day, no-cost extension 
through 2:00 PM, December 23.  End Note)  The signing took 
place in Houston, Texas. 
 
7. (SBU) Ramey and WAPCo Managing Director Dennis Fahy expect 
full mobilization of the construction companies and resources 
to take up to six months, so the main construction work 
should begin in the summer of 2005.  However, there will be 
some activity started in Tema (one of two entry points in 
Ghana) in March or April, connected with the concrete weight 
coating plant.  Fahy and Ramey expect construction to take 
roughly 18 months, so first gas should be around December 
2006.

SUBJECT: GHANA\'S PRESIDENT AND PARLIAMENT SWORN IN 
 
Classified By: PolChief Scott Ticknor for reasons 1.5 d and e. 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  President John Kufuor was sworn in for a 
second term on January 7.  His inauguration was delayed by 
several hours because of a tug-of-war over the selection of 
the new Speaker of Parliament, Ebenezer Sekyi Hughes.  This 
showdown could sour relations for some time between the two 
major parties in parliament.  We do not expect much policy or 
legislative momentum in the coming month, as politicians 
jockey for positions, the new parliament gets organized and 
new ministers and deputies are vetted through parliament. 
End summary. 
 
President Sworn In 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  On January 7, John Agyekum Kufuor was sworn in for a 
second four-year term as President of Ghana.  The 
inauguration was attended by the presidents of Senegal, 
Nigeria, Togo, Sierra Leone, Equitorial Guinea, Benin and 
Mali, the Prime Ministers of Angola, Guinea, and Burkina 
Faso, Interim Chairman of the Liberation Unity Government of 
Liberia Gyude Bryant, the Vice Presidents of South Africa and 
the Gambia, the Foreign Minister of Morocco, and other 
dignitaries (Ambassador Yates represented for the USG). In 
his inaugural speech, Kufuor highlighted the need for good 
governance, for increasing confidence in public institutions, 
and for boosting education and health care. 
 
Parliament Off to a Bumpy Start 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  The ceremony started almost three hours late because 
parliament, meeting just before the inauguration, could not 
reach consensus on the selection of a new Speaker.  The 
ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) backed President Kufuor\'s 
choice of Ebenezer Begyina Sekyi Hughes, while the opposition 
National Democratic Congress (NDC) pushed for the reelection 
of outgoing Speaker Peter Ala Adjetey.  In an unprecedented 
secret ballot (counted three times because of math errors), 
 
SIPDIS 
Hughes prevailed 134 votes to 96.  Parliament retained 
Freddie Blay as First Deputy Speaker by consensus but then 
again disagreed over the choice of the largely ceremonial 
Second Deputy Speaker position.  The NPP again prevailed in a 
secret ballot vote, with its winning candidate Malik Yakubu 
 
SIPDIS 
Al-Hassan (an NPP MP from Yendi, Northern Region).  With 
these positions selected, the new Speaker swore in 230 new 
Members of Parliament. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
4.  (C)  The GOG badly bungled the protocol of the 
inauguration and related events during the week, damaging 
Ghana\'s reputation for many visitors.  At the inauguration, 
Heads of State and Ambassadors were left waiting for hours 
without explanation.  Some Members of Parliament were left 
standing without seats (PolChief witnessed police threatening 
to beat VIPs if they did not vacate seats).  Kufuor\'s aides 
forgot to bring the sheet of paper with the oath of office, 
forcing the President to repeat the words of the Chief 
Justice.  VIP vehicles arrived and departed chaotically, with 
no protocol officers in sight.  The suddenly arriving thick 
mist of hamattan season added to the atmosphere of confusion. 
 
 
5.  (C)  Parliament is off to an inauspicious start.  The 
selection of Speaker is usually decided before MP\'s come to 
vote.  The secret ballot voting for both Speaker and Deputy 
Speaker was unprecedented.  The results - two NPP choices and 
no one in leadership from the NDC - will likely sour 
relations between the two major parties in parliament.  The 
election of Deputy Speaker Malik Yakubu Al-Hassan is 
controversial.  Formerly Interior Minister, he resigned under 
pressure after the 2002 murder of the Ya Na (Dagbon Chief) in 
his home town.  Speaker Hughes and First Deputy Speaker Blay 
are both from the Akan ethnic group.  Their election 
reinforces the Akan identity of the Kufuor government (Kufuor 
and the Chief Justice are also Akans, but the Speaker has 
traditionally been a Ga.) This could eventually hurt the 
NPP\'s political support among other ethnic groups.  We will 
provide a bio of the new Speaker septel. 
 
6.  (C)  We do not expect much policy or legislative momentum 
in Ghana for at least the next month.  Enthusiasm for 
Kufuor\'s second term could increase after his new ministers 
are in place.  At the moment, however, politicians are busy 
jockeying for positions in the new government.  There are 
currently no ministers (ministries are being run by Chief 
Directors).  All new ministers will need approval from 
parliament, which will be absorbed in the coming weeks with 
forming committees and training (52 percent of MPs are new to 
parliament).  The President is in Gabon for an AU Security 
Summit and, in the next few weeks, will host an ECOWAS Summit 
in Accra and attend an AU Summit in Addis Abbaba.  He will 
likely begin to name Cabinet nominees within the next week, 
but parliamentary approval could take weeks.  The President\'s 
priorities in early February will be the budget and his State 
of the Nation Address (Note: the President\'s January 4 State 
of the Nation address fulfilled, for the first time ever, a 
constitutional requirement that the President address 
parliament before the end of its session about his 
performance.  The February State of the Nation address will 
fulfill another constitutional requirement that the President 
address parliament at the beginning of a session, and is 
likely to be more prospective than the January speech.  End 
note.) The Parliament will adjourn by March 25 for six weeks. 
 We will do more analysis over the coming weeks about what to 
expect from Kufuor\'s second term.
